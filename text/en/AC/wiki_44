<text>The genetic code is the set of rules used by living cells to translate information encoded within genetic material (DNA or RNA sequences of nucleotide triplets or codons) into proteins. Translation is accomplished by the ribosome, which links proteinogenic amino acids in an order specified by messenger RNA (mRNA), using transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules to carry amino acids and to read the mRNA three nucleotides at a time. The genetic code is highly similar among all organisms and can be expressed in a simple table with 64 entries.

The codons specify which amino acid will be added next during protein biosynthesis. With some exceptions, a three-nucleotide codon in a nucleic acid sequence specifies a single amino acid. The vast majority of genes are encoded with a single scheme (see the RNA codon table). That scheme is often called the canonical or standard genetic code, or simply &quot;the&quot; genetic code, though variant codes (such as in mitochondria) exist.

==History==

Efforts to understand how proteins are encoded began after DNA&#x27;s structure was discovered in 1953. The key discoverers, English biophysicist Francis Crick and American biologist James Watson, working together at the Cavendish Laboratory of the University of Cambridge, hypothesied that information flows from DNA and that there is a link between DNA and proteins. Soviet-American physicist George Gamow was the first to give a workable scheme for protein synthesis from DNA. He postulated that sets of three bases (triplets) must be employed to encode the 20 standard amino acids used by living cells to build proteins, which would allow a maximum of amino acids. He named this DNA–protein interaction (the original genetic code) as the &quot;diamond code&quot;.

In 1954, Gamow created an informal scientific organisation the RNA Tie Club, as suggested by Watson, for scientists of different persuasions who were interested in how proteins were synthesised from genes. However, the club could have only 20 permanent members to represent each of the 20 amino acids; and four additional honorary members to represent the four nucleotides of DNA.

The first scientific contribution of the club, later recorded as &quot;one of the most important unpublished articles in the history of science&quot; and &quot;the most famous unpublished paper in the annals of molecular biology&quot;, was made by Crick. Crick presented a type-written paper titled &quot;On Degenerate Templates and the Adaptor Hypothesis: A Note for the RNA Tie Club&quot; to the members of the club in January 1955, which &quot;totally changed the way we thought about protein synthesis&quot;, as Watson recalled. The hypothesis states that the triplet code was not passed on to amino acids as Gamow thought, but carried by a different molecule, an adaptor, that interacts with amino acids. The adaptor was later identified as tRNA.

===Codons===

The Crick, Brenner, Barnett and Watts-Tobin experiment first demonstrated that codons consist of three DNA bases. 

Marshall Nirenberg and J. Heinrich Matthaei were the first to reveal the nature of a codon in 1961. They used a cell-free system to translate a poly-uracil RNA sequence (i.e., UUUUU...) and discovered that the polypeptide that they had synthesized consisted of only the amino acid phenylalanine. They thereby deduced that the codon UUU specified the amino acid phenylalanine.

This was followed by experiments in Severo Ochoa&#x27;s laboratory that demonstrated that the poly-adenine RNA sequence (AAAAA...) coded for the polypeptide poly-lysine and that the poly-cytosine RNA sequence (CCCCC...) coded for the polypeptide poly-proline. Therefore, the codon AAA specified the amino acid lysine, and the codon CCC specified the amino acid proline. Using various copolymers most of the remaining codons were then determined.

Subsequent work by Har Gobind Khorana identified the rest of the genetic code. Shortly thereafter, Robert W. Holley determined the structure of transfer RNA (tRNA), the adapter molecule that facilitates the process of translating RNA into protein. This work was based upon Ochoa&#x27;s earlier studies, yielding the latter the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1959 for work on the enzymology of RNA synthesis.

Extending this work, Nirenberg and Philip Leder revealed the code&#x27;s triplet nature and deciphered its codons. In these experiments, various combinations of mRNA were passed through a filter that contained ribosomes, the components of cells that translate RNA into protein. Unique triplets promoted the binding of specific tRNAs to the ribosome. Leder and Nirenberg were able to determine the sequences of 54 out of 64 codons in their experiments. Khorana, Holley and Nirenberg received the Nobel Prize (1968) for their work.

The three stop codons were named by discoverers Richard Epstein and Charles Steinberg. &quot;Amber&quot; was named after their friend Harris Bernstein, whose last name means &quot;amber&quot; in German. The other two stop codons were named &quot;ochre&quot; and &quot;opal&quot; in order to keep the &quot;color names&quot; theme.

=== Expanded genetic codes (synthetic biology) ===

In a broad academic audience, the concept of the evolution of the genetic code from the original and ambiguous genetic code to a well-defined (&quot;frozen&quot;) code with the repertoire of 20 (+2) canonical amino acids is widely accepted.
However, there are different opinions, concepts, approaches and ideas, which is the best way to change it experimentally. Even models are proposed that predict &quot;entry points&quot; for synthetic amino acid invasion of the genetic code.

Since 2001, 40 non-natural amino acids have been added into proteins by creating a unique codon (recoding) and a corresponding transfer-RNA:aminoacyl – tRNA-synthetase pair to encode it with diverse physicochemical and biological properties in order to be used as a tool to exploring protein structure and function or to create novel or enhanced proteins.

H. Murakami and M. Sisido extended some codons to have four and five bases. Steven A. Benner constructed a functional 65th (&quot;in vivo&quot;) codon.

In 2015 N. Budisa, D. Söll and co-workers reported the full substitution of all 20,899 tryptophan residues (UGG codons) with unnatural thienopyrrole-alanine in the genetic code of the bacterium &quot;E. coli&quot;.

In 2016 the first stable semisynthetic organism was created. It was a (single cell) bacterium with two synthetic bases (called X and Y). The bases survived cell division.

In 2017, researchers in South Korea reported that they had engineered a mouse with an extended genetic code that can produce proteins with unnatural amino acids.

In May 2019, researchers reported the creation of a new &quot;Syn61&quot; strain of the &quot;E. coli&quot; bacteria. This strain has a fully synthetic genome that is refactored (all overlaps expanded), recoded (removing the use of three out of 64 codons completely), and further modified to remove the now unnecessary tRNAs and release factors. It is fully viable and grows 1.6× slower than its wild-type counterpart &quot;MDS42&quot;.

==Features==
===Reading frame===

A reading frame is defined by the initial triplet of nucleotides from which translation starts. It sets the frame for a run of successive, non-overlapping codons, which is known as an &quot;open reading frame&quot; (ORF). For example, the string 5&#x27;-AAATGAACG-3&#x27; (see figure), if read from the first position, contains the codons AAA, TGA, and ACG ; if read from the second position, it contains the codons AAT and GAA ; and if read from the third position, it contains the codons ATG and AAC. Every sequence can, thus, be read in its 5&#x27; → 3&#x27; direction in three reading frames, each producing a possibly distinct amino acid sequence: in the given example, Lys (K)-Trp (W)-Thr (T), Asn (N)-Glu (E), or Met (M)-Asn (N), respectively (when translating with the vertebrate mitochondrial code). When DNA is double-stranded, six possible reading frames are defined, three in the forward orientation on one strand and three reverse on the opposite strand. Protein-coding frames are defined by a start codon, usually the first AUG codon in the RNA, (ATG in DNA) sequence.

In eukaryotes, open reading frames in exons are often interrupted by introns.

=== Start and stop codons ===
Translation starts with a chain-initiation codon or start codon. The start codon alone is not sufficient to begin the process. Nearby sequences such as the Shine-Dalgarno sequence in &quot;E. coli&quot; and initiation factors are also required to start translation. The most common start codon is AUG, which is read as methionine or as formylmethionine (in bacteria, mitochondria, and plastids). Alternative start codons depending on the organism include &quot;GUG&quot; or &quot;UUG&quot;; these codons normally represent valine and leucine, respectively, but as start codons they are translated as methionine or formylmethionine.

The three stop codons have names: UAG is &quot;amber&quot;, UGA is &quot;opal&quot; (sometimes also called &quot;umber&quot;), and UAA is &quot;ochre&quot;. Stop codons are also called &quot;termination&quot; or &quot;nonsense&quot; codons. They signal release of the nascent polypeptide from the ribosome because no cognate tRNA has anticodons complementary to these stop signals, allowing a release factor to bind to the ribosome instead.

===Effect of mutations===
During the process of DNA replication, errors occasionally occur in the polymerization of the second strand. These errors, mutations, can affect an organism&#x27;s phenotype, especially if they occur within the protein coding sequence of a gene. Error rates are typically 1 error in every 10–100 million bases—due to the &quot;proofreading&quot; ability of DNA polymerases.

Missense mutations and nonsense mutations are examples of point mutations that can cause genetic diseases such as sickle-cell disease and thalassemia respectively. Clinically important missense mutations generally change the properties of the coded amino acid residue among basic, acidic, polar or non-polar states, whereas nonsense mutations result in a stop codon.

Mutations that disrupt the reading frame sequence by indels (insertions or deletions) of a non-multiple of 3 nucleotide bases are known as frameshift mutations. These mutations usually result in a completely different translation from the original, and likely cause a stop codon to be read, which truncates the protein. These mutations may impair the protein&#x27;s function and are thus rare in &quot;in vivo&quot; protein-coding sequences. One reason inheritance of frameshift mutations is rare is that, if the protein being translated is essential for growth under the selective pressures the organism faces, absence of a functional protein may cause death before the organism becomes viable. Frameshift mutations may result in severe genetic diseases such as Tay–Sachs disease.

Although most mutations that change protein sequences are harmful or neutral, some mutations have benefits. These mutations may enable the mutant organism to withstand particular environmental stresses better than wild type organisms, or reproduce more quickly. In these cases a mutation will tend to become more common in a population through natural selection. Viruses that use RNA as their genetic material have rapid mutation rates, which can be an advantage, since these viruses thereby evolve rapidly, and thus evade the immune system defensive responses. In large populations of asexually reproducing organisms, for example, &quot;E. coli&quot;, multiple beneficial mutations may co-occur. This phenomenon is called clonal interference and causes competition among the mutations.

===Degeneracy===

Degeneracy is the redundancy of the genetic code. This term was given by Bernfield and Nirenberg. The genetic code has redundancy but no ambiguity (see the codon tables below for the full correlation). For example, although codons GAA and GAG both specify glutamic acid (redundancy), neither specifies another amino acid (no ambiguity). The codons encoding one amino acid may differ in any of their three positions. For example, the amino acid leucine is specified by YUR or CUN (UUA, UUG, CUU, CUC, CUA, or CUG) codons (difference in the first or third position indicated using IUPAC notation), while the amino acid serine is specified by UCN or AGY (UCA, UCG, UCC, UCU, AGU, or AGC) codons (difference in the first, second, or third position). A practical consequence of redundancy is that errors in the third position of the triplet codon cause only a silent mutation or an error that would not affect the protein because the hydrophilicity or hydrophobicity is maintained by equivalent substitution of amino acids; for example, a codon of NUN (where N = any nucleotide) tends to code for hydrophobic amino acids. NCN yields amino acid residues that are small in size and moderate in hydropathicity; NAN encodes average size hydrophilic residues. The genetic code is so well-structured for hydropathicity that a mathematical analysis (Singular Value Decomposition) of 12 variables (4 nucleotides x 3 positions) yields a remarkable correlation (C = 0.95) for predicting the hydropathicity of the encoded amino acid directly from the triplet nucleotide sequence, &quot;without translation.&quot; Note in the table, below, eight amino acids are not affected at all by mutations at the third position of the codon, whereas in the figure above, a mutation at the second position is likely to cause a radical change in the physicochemical properties of the encoded amino acid.
Nevertheless, changes in the first position of the codons are more important than changes in the second position on a global scale. The reason may be that charge reversal (from a positive to a negative charge or vice versa) can only occur upon mutations in the first position of certain codons, but not upon changes in the second position of any codon. Such charge reversal may have dramatic consequences for the structure or function of a protein. This aspect may have been largely underestimated by previous studies.

===Codon usage bias===
The frequency of codons, also known as codon usage bias, can vary from species to species with functional implications for the control of translation. The codon varies by organism; for example, most common proline codon in E. coli is CCG, whereas in humans this is the least used proline codon.

==Alternative genetic codes==
=== Non-standard amino acids ===
In some proteins, non-standard amino acids are substituted for standard stop codons, depending on associated signal sequences in the messenger RNA. For example, UGA can code for selenocysteine and UAG can code for pyrrolysine. Selenocysteine came to be seen as the 21st amino acid, and pyrrolysine as the 22nd. Both selenocysteine and pyrrolysine may be present in the same organism. Although the genetic code is normally fixed in an organism, the achaeal prokaryote &quot;Acetohalobium arabaticum&quot; can expand its genetic code from 20 to 21 amino acids (by including pyrrolysine) under different conditions of growth.

=== Variations ===
There was originally a simple and widely accepted argument that the genetic code should be universal: namely, that any variation in the genetic code would be lethal to the organism (although Crick had stated that viruses were an exception). This is known as the &quot;frozen accident&quot; argument for the universality of the genetic code. However, in his seminal paper on the origins of the genetic code in 1968, Francis Crick still stated that the universality of the genetic code in all organisms was an unproven assumption, and was probably not true in some instances. He predicted that &quot;The code is universal (the same in all organisms) or nearly so&quot;. The first variation was discovered in 1979, by researchers studying human mitochondrial genes. Many slight variants were discovered thereafter, including various alternative mitochondrial codes. These minor variants for example involve translation of the codon UGA as tryptophan in &quot;Mycoplasma&quot; species, and translation of CUG as a serine rather than leucine in yeasts of the &quot;CTG clade&quot; (such as &quot;Candida albicans&quot;). Because viruses must use the same genetic code as their hosts, modifications to the standard genetic code could interfere with viral protein synthesis or functioning. However, viruses such as totiviruses have adapted to the host&#x27;s genetic code modification. In bacteria and archaea, GUG and UUG are common start codons. In rare cases, certain proteins may use alternative start codons.
Surprisingly, variations in the interpretation of the genetic code exist also in human nuclear-encoded genes: In 2016, researchers studying the translation of malate dehydrogenase found that in about 4% of the mRNAs encoding this enzyme the stop codon is naturally used to encode the amino acids tryptophan and arginine. This type of recoding is induced by a high-readthrough stop codon context and it is referred to as &quot;functional translational readthrough&quot;.

Despite these differences, all known naturally occurring codes are very similar. The coding mechanism is the same for all organisms: three-base codons, tRNA, ribosomes, single direction reading and translating single codons into single amino acids. The most extreme variations occur in certain ciliates where the meaning of stop codons depends on their position within mRNA. When close to the 3&#x27; end they act as terminators while in internal positions they either code for amino acids as in &quot;Condylostoma magnum&quot; or trigger ribosomal frameshifting as in &quot;Euplotes&quot;.

The origins and variation of the genetic code, including the mechanisms behind the evolvability of the genetic code, have been widely studied, and some studies have been done experimentally evolving the genetic code of some organisms.

=== Inference ===
Variant genetic codes used by an organism can be inferred by identifying highly conserved genes encoded in that genome, and comparing its codon usage to the amino acids in homologous proteins of other organisms. For example, the program FACIL infers a genetic code by searching which amino acids in homologous protein domains are most often aligned to every codon. The resulting amino acid (or stop codon) probabilities for each codon are displayed in a genetic code logo.

As of January 2022, the most complete survey of genetic codes is done by Shulgina and Eddy, who screened 250,000 prokaryotic genomes using their Codetta tool. This tool uses a similar approach to FACIL with a larger Pfam database. Despite the NCBI already providing 27 translation tables, the authors were able to find new 5 genetic code variations (corroborated by tRNA mutations) and correct several misattributions. Codetta was later used to analyze genetic code change in ciliates.

==Origin==
The genetic code is a key part of the history of life, according to one version of which self-replicating RNA molecules preceded life as we know it. This is the RNA world hypothesis. Under this hypothesis, any model for the emergence of the genetic code is intimately related to a model of the transfer from ribozymes (RNA enzymes) to proteins as the principal enzymes in cells. In line with the RNA world hypothesis, transfer RNA molecules appear to have evolved before modern aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, so the latter cannot be part of the explanation of its patterns.

A hypothetical randomly evolved genetic code further motivates a biochemical or evolutionary model for its origin. If amino acids were randomly assigned to triplet codons, there would be 1.5 × 1084 possible genetic codes. This number is found by calculating the number of ways that 21 items (20 amino acids plus one stop) can be placed in 64 bins, wherein each item is used at least once. However, the distribution of codon assignments in the genetic code is nonrandom. In particular, the genetic code clusters certain amino acid assignments.

Amino acids that share the same biosynthetic pathway tend to have the same first base in their codons. This could be an evolutionary relic of an early, simpler genetic code with fewer amino acids that later evolved to code a larger set of amino acids. It could also reflect steric and chemical properties that had another effect on the codon during its evolution. Amino acids with similar physical properties also tend to have similar codons, reducing the problems caused by point mutations and mistranslations.

Given the non-random genetic triplet coding scheme, a tenable hypothesis for the origin of genetic code could address multiple aspects of the codon table, such as absence of codons for D-amino acids, secondary codon patterns for some amino acids, confinement of synonymous positions to third position, the small set of only 20 amino acids (instead of a number approaching 64), and the relation of stop codon patterns to amino acid coding patterns.

Three main hypotheses address the origin of the genetic code. Many models belong to one of them or to a hybrid:

*Random freeze: the genetic code was randomly created. For example, early tRNA-like ribozymes may have had different affinities for amino acids, with codons emerging from another part of the ribozyme that exhibited random variability. Once enough peptides were coded for, any major random change in the genetic code would have been lethal; hence it became &quot;frozen&quot;.
*Stereochemical affinity: the genetic code is a result of a high affinity between each amino acid and its codon or anti-codon; the latter option implies that pre-tRNA molecules matched their corresponding amino acids by this affinity. Later during evolution, this matching was gradually replaced with matching by aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases.
*Optimality: the genetic code continued to evolve after its initial creation, so that the current code maximizes some fitness function, usually some kind of error minimization.

Hypotheses have addressed a variety of scenarios:
* Chemical principles govern specific RNA interaction with amino acids. Experiments with aptamers showed that some amino acids have a selective chemical affinity for their codons. Experiments showed that of 8 amino acids tested, 6 show some RNA triplet-amino acid association.
* Biosynthetic expansion. The genetic code grew from a simpler earlier code through a process of &quot;biosynthetic expansion&quot;. Primordial life &quot;discovered&quot; new amino acids (for example, as by-products of metabolism) and later incorporated some of these into the machinery of genetic coding. Although much circumstantial evidence has been found to suggest that fewer amino acid types were used in the past, precise and detailed hypotheses about which amino acids entered the code in what order are controversial. However, several studies have suggested that Gly, Ala, Asp, Val, Ser, Pro, Glu, Leu, Thr may belong to a group of early-addition amino acids, whereas Cys, Met, Tyr, Trp, His, Phe may belong to a group of later-addition amino acids. 
* Natural selection has led to codon assignments of the genetic code that minimize the effects of mutations. A recent hypothesis suggests that the triplet code was derived from codes that used longer than triplet codons (such as quadruplet codons). Longer than triplet decoding would increase codon redundancy and would be more error resistant. This feature could allow accurate decoding absent complex translational machinery such as the ribosome, such as before cells began making ribosomes.
* Information channels: Information-theoretic approaches model the process of translating the genetic code into corresponding amino acids as an error-prone information channel. The inherent noise (that is, the error) in the channel poses the organism with a fundamental question: how can a genetic code be constructed to withstand noise while accurately and efficiently translating information? These &quot;rate-distortion&quot; models suggest that the genetic code originated as a result of the interplay of the three conflicting evolutionary forces: the needs for diverse amino acids, for error-tolerance and for minimal resource cost. The code emerges at a transition when the mapping of codons to amino acids becomes nonrandom. The code&#x27;s emergence is governed by the topology defined by the probable errors and is related to the map coloring problem.
*Game theory: Models based on signaling games combine elements of game theory, natural selection and information channels. Such models have been used to suggest that the first polypeptides were likely short and had non-enzymatic function. Game theoretic models suggested that the organization of RNA strings into cells may have been necessary to prevent &quot;deceptive&quot; use of the genetic code, i.e. preventing the ancient equivalent of viruses from overwhelming the RNA world.
*Stop codons: Codons for translational stops are also an interesting aspect to the problem of the origin of the genetic code. As an example for addressing stop codon evolution, it has been suggested that the stop codons are such that they are most likely to terminate translation early in the case of a frame shift error. In contrast, some stereochemical molecular models explain the origin of stop codons as &quot;unassignable&quot;.

| algebraic = formula_1


In mathematics, two quantities are in the golden ratio if their ratio is the same as the ratio of their sum to the larger of the two quantities. Expressed algebraically, for quantities and with , is in a golden ratio to if

formula_2

where the Greek letter phi ( or ) denotes the golden ratio. The constant satisfies the quadratic equation and is an irrational number with a value of

The golden ratio was called the extreme and mean ratio by Euclid, and the divine proportion by Luca Pacioli; it also goes by other names.

Mathematicians have studied the golden ratio&#x27;s properties since antiquity. It is the ratio of a regular pentagon&#x27;s diagonal to its side and thus appears in the construction of the dodecahedron and icosahedron. A golden rectangle—that is, a rectangle with an aspect ratio of —may be cut into a square and a smaller rectangle with the same aspect ratio. The golden ratio has been used to analyze the proportions of natural objects and artificial systems such as financial markets, in some cases based on dubious fits to data. The golden ratio appears in some patterns in nature, including the spiral arrangement of leaves and other parts of vegetation.

Some 20th-century artists and architects, including Le Corbusier and Salvador Dalí, have proportioned their works to approximate the golden ratio, believing it to be aesthetically pleasing. These uses often appear in the form of a golden rectangle.

==Calculation==
Two quantities and are in the &quot;golden ratio&quot; if
formula_3

Thus, if we want to find , we may use that the definition above holds for arbitrary ; thus, we just set , in which case and we get the equation
which becomes a quadratic equation after multiplying by :
formula_4
which can be rearranged to
formula_5

The quadratic formula yields two solutions:

Because is a ratio between positive quantities, is necessarily the positive root. The negative root is in fact the negative inverse , which shares many properties with the golden ratio.

==History==
According to Mario Livio,

Ancient Greek mathematicians first studied the golden ratio because of its frequent appearance in geometry; the division of a line into &quot;extreme and mean ratio&quot; (the golden section) is important in the geometry of regular pentagrams and pentagons. According to one story, 5th-century BC mathematician Hippasus discovered that the golden ratio was neither a whole number nor a fraction (it is irrational), surprising Pythagoreans. Euclid&#x27;s &quot;Elements&quot; () provides several propositions and their proofs employing the golden ratio, and contains its first known definition which proceeds as follows:


The golden ratio was studied peripherally over the next millennium. Abu Kamil (c. 850–930) employed it in his geometric calculations of pentagons and decagons; his writings influenced that of Fibonacci (Leonardo of Pisa) (c. 1170–1250), who used the ratio in related geometry problems but did not observe that it was connected to the Fibonacci numbers.

Luca Pacioli named his book &quot;Divina proportione&quot; (1509) after the ratio; the book, largely plagiarized from Piero della Francesca, explored its properties including its appearance in some of the Platonic solids. Leonardo da Vinci, who illustrated Pacioli&#x27;s book, called the ratio the &quot;sectio aurea&quot; (&#x27;golden section&#x27;). Though it is often said that Pacioli advocated the golden ratio&#x27;s application to yield pleasing, harmonious proportions, Livio points out that the interpretation has been traced to an error in 1799, and that Pacioli actually advocated the Vitruvian system of rational proportions. Pacioli also saw Catholic religious significance in the ratio, which led to his work&#x27;s title. 16th-century mathematicians such as Rafael Bombelli solved geometric problems using the ratio.

German mathematician Simon Jacob (d. 1564) noted that consecutive Fibonacci numbers converge to the golden ratio; this was rediscovered by Johannes Kepler in 1608. The first known decimal approximation of the (inverse) golden ratio was stated as &quot;about &quot; in 1597 by Michael Maestlin of the University of Tübingen in a letter to Kepler, his former student. The same year, Kepler wrote to Maestlin of the Kepler triangle, which combines the golden ratio with the Pythagorean theorem. Kepler said of these:

Eighteenth-century mathematicians Abraham de Moivre, Nicolaus I Bernoulli, and Leonhard Euler used a golden ratio-based formula which finds the value of a Fibonacci number based on its placement in the sequence; in 1843, this was rediscovered by Jacques Philippe Marie Binet, for whom it was named &quot;Binet&#x27;s formula&quot;. Martin Ohm first used the German term &quot;goldener Schnitt&quot; (&#x27;golden section&#x27;) to describe the ratio in 1835. James Sully used the equivalent English term in 1875.

By 1910, inventor Mark Barr began using the Greek letter phi () as a symbol for the golden ratio. It has also been represented by tau (), the first letter of the ancient Greek τομή (&#x27;cut&#x27; or &#x27;section&#x27;).
The zome construction system, developed by Steve Baer in the late 1960s, is based on the symmetry system of the icosahedron/dodecahedron, and uses the golden ratio ubiquitously. Between 1973 and 1974, Roger Penrose developed Penrose tiling, a pattern related to the golden ratio both in the ratio of areas of its two rhombic tiles and in their relative frequency within the pattern. This gained in interest after Dan Shechtman&#x27;s Nobel-winning 1982 discovery of quasicrystals with icosahedral symmetry, which were soon afterwards explained through analogies to the Penrose tiling.

==Mathematics==

===Irrationality===
The golden ratio is an irrational number. Below are two short proofs of irrationality:

====Contradiction from an expression in lowest terms====
This is a proof by infinite descent. Recall that:
If we call the whole and the longer part , then the second statement above becomes

To say that the golden ratio is rational means that is a fraction where and are integers. We may take to be in lowest terms and and to be positive. But if is in lowest terms, then the equally valued is in still lower terms. That is a contradiction that follows from the assumption that is rational.

====By irrationality of the square root of 5 ====
Another short proof – perhaps more commonly known – of the irrationality of the golden ratio makes use of the closure of rational numbers under addition and multiplication. If is assumed to be rational, then , the square root of , must also be rational. This is a contradiction as the square roots of all non-square natural numbers are irrational.

===Minimal polynomial===

The golden ratio is also an algebraic number and even an algebraic integer. It has minimal polynomial
formula_6

This quadratic polynomial has two roots, and .

The golden ratio is also closely related to the polynomial , which has roots and . As the root of a quadratic polynomial, the golden ratio is a constructible number.

===Golden ratio conjugate and powers===
The conjugate root to the minimal polynomial is

formula_7

The absolute value of this quantity () corresponds to the length ratio taken in reverse order (shorter segment length over longer segment length, ).

This illustrates the unique property of the golden ratio among positive numbers, that
formula_8

or its inverse,
formula_9

The conjugate and the defining quadratic polynomial relationship lead to decimal values that have their fractional part in common with :

formula_10

The sequence of powers of contains these values , , , ; more generally,
any power of is equal to the sum of the two immediately preceding powers:
formula_11

As a result, one can easily decompose any power of into a multiple of and a constant. The multiple and the constant are always adjacent Fibonacci numbers. This leads to another property of the positive powers of :

If , then:
formula_12

===Continued fraction and square root===

The formula can be expanded recursively to obtain a simple continued fraction for the golden ratio:
formula_13

It is in fact the simplest form of a continued fraction, alongside its reciprocal form:
formula_14

The convergents of these continued fractions, , , , , , or , , , , , are ratios of successive Fibonacci numbers. The consistently small terms in its continued fraction explain why the approximants converge so slowly. This makes the golden ratio an extreme case of the Hurwitz inequality for Diophantine approximations, which states that for every irrational , there are infinitely many distinct fractions such that,
formula_15

This means that the constant cannot be improved without excluding the golden ratio. It is, in fact, the smallest number that must be excluded to generate closer approximations of such Lagrange numbers.

A continued square root form for can be obtained from , yielding:
formula_16

===Relationship to Fibonacci and Lucas numbers===

Fibonacci numbers and Lucas numbers have an intricate relationship with the golden ratio. In the Fibonacci sequence, each term formula_17 is equal to the sum of the preceding two terms formula_18 and formula_19, starting with the base sequence as the 0th and 1st terms formula_20 and formula_21:

The sequence of Lucas numbers (not to be confused with the generalized Lucas sequences, of which this is part) is like the Fibonacci sequence, in that each term formula_22 is the sum of the previous two terms formula_23 and formula_24, however instead starts with as the 0th and 1st terms formula_25 and formula_26:

Exceptionally, the golden ratio is equal to the limit of the ratios of successive terms in the Fibonacci sequence and sequence of Lucas numbers:
formula_27

In other words, if a Fibonacci and Lucas number is divided by its immediate predecessor in the sequence, the quotient approximates . For example,

{F_{15}} = \frac{987}{610} = 1.6180327\ldots\ &lt;/math&gt; and formula_28 }}

These approximations are alternately lower and higher than , and converge to as the Fibonacci and Lucas numbers increase.

Closed-form expressions for the Fibonacci and Lucas sequences that involve the golden ratio are:

formula_29
formula_30

Combining both formulas above, one obtains a formula for that involves both Fibonacci and Lucas numbers:
formula_31

Between Fibonacci and Lucas numbers one can deduce , which simplifies to express the limit of the quotient of Lucas numbers by Fibonacci numbers as equal to the square root of five:
formula_32

Indeed, much stronger statements are true:
formula_33

These values describe as a fundamental unit of the algebraic number field .

Successive powers of the golden ratio obey the Fibonacci recurrence, .

The reduction to a linear expression can be accomplished in one step by using:
formula_34

This identity allows any polynomial in to be reduced to a linear expression, as in:

formula_35

Consecutive Fibonacci numbers can also be used to obtain a similar formula for the golden ratio, here by infinite summation:
formula_36

In particular, the powers of themselves round to Lucas numbers (in order, except for the first two powers, and , are in reverse order):

formula_37

and so forth. The Lucas numbers also directly generate powers of the golden ratio; for :
formula_38

Rooted in their interconnecting relationship with the golden ratio is the notion that the sum of &quot;third&quot; consecutive Fibonacci numbers equals a Lucas number, that is ; and, importantly, that .

Both the Fibonacci sequence and the sequence of Lucas numbers can be used to generate approximate forms of the golden spiral (which is a special form of a logarithmic spiral) using quarter-circles with radii from these sequences, differing only slightly from the &quot;true&quot; golden logarithmic spiral. &quot;Fibonacci spiral&quot; is generally the term used for spirals that approximate golden spirals using Fibonacci number-sequenced squares and quarter-circles.

===Geometry===
The golden ratio features prominently in geometry. For example, it is intrinsically involved in the internal symmetry of the pentagon, and extends to form part of the coordinates of the vertices of a regular dodecahedron, as well as those of a regular icosahedron. It features in the Kepler triangle and Penrose tilings too, as well as in various other polytopes.

====Construction====
Dividing by interior division
# Having a line segment , construct a perpendicular at point , with half the length of . Draw the hypotenuse .
# Draw an arc with center and radius . This arc intersects the hypotenuse at point .
# Draw an arc with center and radius . This arc intersects the original line segment at point . Point divides the original line segment into line segments and with lengths in the golden ratio.

Dividing by exterior division
# Draw a line segment and construct off the point a segment perpendicular to and with the same length as .
# Do bisect the line segment with .
# A circular arc around with radius intersects in point the straight line through points and (also known as the extension of ). The ratio of to the constructed segment is the golden ratio.
Application examples you can see in the articles Pentagon with a given side length, Decagon with given circumcircle and Decagon with a given side length.

Both of the above displayed different algorithms produce geometric constructions that determine two aligned line segments where the ratio of the longer one to the shorter one is the golden ratio.

====Golden angle====
When two angles that make a full circle have measures in the golden ratio, the smaller is called the &quot;golden angle&quot;, with measure :

formula_39

This angle occurs in patterns of plant growth as the optimal spacing of leaf shoots around plant stems so that successive leaves do not block sunlight from the leaves below them.

====Pentagonal symmetry system====

=====Pentagon and pentagram=====
In a regular pentagon the ratio of a diagonal to a side is the golden ratio, while intersecting diagonals section each other in the golden ratio. The golden ratio properties of a regular pentagon can be confirmed by applying Ptolemy&#x27;s theorem to the quadrilateral formed by removing one of its vertices. If the quadrilateral&#x27;s long edge and diagonals are , and short edges are , then Ptolemy&#x27;s theorem gives . Dividing both sides by yields (see above),
formula_40

The diagonal segments of a pentagon form a pentagram, or five-pointed star polygon, whose geometry is quintessentially described by . Primarily, each intersection of edges sections other edges in the golden ratio. The ratio of the length of the shorter segment to the segment bounded by the two intersecting edges (that is, a side of the inverted pentagon in the pentagram&#x27;s center) is , as the four-color illustration shows.

Pentagonal and pentagrammic geometry permits us to calculate the following values for :
formula_41

=====Golden triangle and golden gnomon=====
The triangle formed by two diagonals and a side of a regular pentagon is called a &quot;golden triangle&quot; or &quot;sublime triangle&quot;. It is an acute isosceles triangle with apex angle and base angles . Its two equal sides are in the golden ratio to its base. The triangle formed by two sides and a diagonal of a regular pentagon is called a &quot;golden gnomon&quot;. It is an obtuse isosceles triangle with apex angle and base angle . Its base is in the golden ratio to its two equal sides. The pentagon can thus be subdivided into two golden gnomons and a central golden triangle. The five points of a regular pentagram are golden triangles, as are the ten triangles formed by connecting the vertices of a regular decagon to its center point.

Bisecting one of the base angles of the golden triangle subdivides it into a smaller golden triangle and a golden gnomon. Analogously, any acute isosceles triangle can be subdivided into a similar triangle and an obtuse isosceles triangle, but the golden triangle is the only one for which this subdivision is made by the angle bisector, because it is the only isosceles triangle whose base angle is twice its apex angle. The angle bisector of the golden triangle subdivides the side that it meets in the golden ratio, and the areas of the two subdivided pieces are also in the golden ratio.

If the apex angle of the golden gnomon is trisected, the trisector again subdivides it into a smaller golden gnomon and a golden triangle. The trisector subdivides the base in the golden ratio, and the two pieces have areas in the golden ratio. Analogously, any obtuse triangle can be subdivided into a similar triangle and an acute isosceles triangle, but the golden gnomon is the only one for which this subdivision is made by the angle trisector, because it is the only isosceles triangle whose apex angle is three times its base angle.

=====Penrose tilings=====
The golden ratio appears prominently in the &quot;Penrose tiling&quot;, a family of aperiodic tilings of the plane developed by Roger Penrose, inspired by Johannes Kepler&#x27;s remark that pentagrams, decagons, and other shapes could fill gaps that pentagonal shapes alone leave when tiled together. Several variations of this tiling have been studied, all of whose prototiles exhibit the golden ratio:
*Penrose&#x27;s original version of this tiling used four shapes: regular pentagons and pentagrams, &quot;boat&quot; figures with three points of a pentagram, and &quot;diamond&quot; shaped rhombi.
*The kite and dart Penrose tiling uses kites with three interior angles of and one interior angle of , and darts, concave quadrilaterals with two interior angles of , one of , and one non-convex angle of . Special matching rules restrict how the tiles can meet at any edge, resulting in seven combinations of tiles at any vertex. Both the kites and darts have sides of two lengths, in the golden ratio to each other. The areas of these two tile shapes are also in the golden ratio to each other.
*The kite and dart can each be cut on their symmetry axes into a pair of golden triangles and golden gnomons, respectively. With suitable matching rules, these triangles, called in this context &quot;Robinson triangles&quot;, can be used as the prototiles for a form of the Penrose tiling.
*The rhombic Penrose tiling contains two types of rhombus, a thin rhombus with angles of and , and a thick rhombus with angles of and . All side lengths are equal, but the ratio of the length of sides to the short diagonal in the thin rhombus equals , as does the ratio of the sides of to the long diagonal of the thick rhombus. As with the kite and dart tiling, the areas of the two rhombi are in the golden ratio to each other. Again, these rhombi can be decomposed into pairs of Robinson triangles.

====In triangles and quadrilaterals====

=====Odom&#x27;s construction=====
George Odom found a construction for involving an equilateral triangle: if the line segment joining the midpoints of two sides is extended to intersect the circumcircle, then the two midpoints and the point of intersection with the circle are in golden proportion.

=====Kepler triangle=====
The &quot;Kepler triangle&quot;, named after Johannes Kepler, is the unique right triangle with sides in geometric progression:
formula_42
These side lengths are the three Pythagorean means of the two numbers . The three squares on its sides have areas in the golden geometric progression .

Among isosceles triangles, the ratio of inradius to side length is maximized for the triangle formed by two reflected copies of the Kepler triangle, sharing the longer of their two legs. The same isosceles triangle maximizes the ratio of the radius of a semicircle on its base to its perimeter.

For a Kepler triangle with smallest side length , the area and acute internal angles are:
formula_43

=====Golden rectangle=====

The golden ratio proportions the adjacent side lengths of a &quot;golden rectangle&quot; in ratio. Stacking golden rectangles produces golden rectangles anew, and removing or adding squares from golden rectangles leaves rectangles still proportioned in ratio. They can be generated by &quot;golden spirals&quot;, through successive Fibonacci and Lucas number-sized squares and quarter circles. They feature prominently in the icosahedron as well as in the dodecahedron (see section below for more detail).

=====Golden rhombus=====

A &quot;golden rhombus&quot; is a rhombus whose diagonals are in proportion to the golden ratio, most commonly . For a rhombus of such proportions, its acute angle and obtuse angles are:

formula_44

The lengths of its short and long diagonals and , in terms of side length are:

formula_45

Its area, in terms of and :

formula_46

Golden rhombi form the faces of the rhombic triacontahedron, the two golden rhombohedra, the Bilinski dodecahedron, and the rhombic hexecontahedron.

====Golden spiral====

Logarithmic spirals are self-similar spirals where distances covered per turn are in geometric progression. A logarithmic spiral whose radius increases by a factor of the golden ratio for each quarter-turn is called the golden spiral. These spirals can be approximated by quarter-circles that grow by the golden ratio, or their approximations generated from Fibonacci numbers, often depicted inscribed within a spiraling pattern of squares growing in the same ratio. The exact logarithmic spiral form of the golden spiral can be described by the polar equation with :
formula_47

Not all logarithmic spirals are connected to the golden ratio, and not all spirals that are connected to the golden ratio are the same shape as the golden spiral. For instance, a different logarithmic spiral, encasing a nested sequence of golden isosceles triangles, grows by the golden ratio for each that it turns, instead of the turning angle of the golden spiral. Another variation, called the &quot;better golden spiral&quot;, grows by the golden ratio for each half-turn, rather than each quarter-turn.

====Dodecahedron and icosahedron====
The regular dodecahedron and its dual polyhedron the icosahedron are Platonic solids whose dimensions are related to the golden ratio. A dodecahedron has regular pentagonal faces, whereas an icosahedron has equilateral triangles; both have edges.

For a dodecahedron of side , the radius of a circumscribed and inscribed sphere, and midradius are (, , and , respectively):

,&lt;/math&gt; and formula_48}}

While for an icosahedron of side , the radius of a circumscribed and inscribed sphere, and midradius are:

}{2},&lt;/math&gt; formula_49 and formula_50}}

The volume and surface area of the dodecahedron can be expressed in terms of :

&lt;/math&gt; and formula_51}}

As well as for the icosahedron:

{2}&lt;/math&gt; and formula_52}}

These geometric values can be calculated from their Cartesian coordinates, which also can be given using formulas involving . The coordinates of the dodecahedron are displayed on the figure to the right, while those of the icosahedron are:

formula_53

Sets of three golden rectangles intersect perpendicularly inside dodecahedra and icosahedra, forming Borromean rings. In dodecahedra, pairs of opposing vertices in golden rectangles meet the centers of pentagonal faces, and in icosahedra, they meet at its vertices. The three golden rectangles together contain all vertices of the icosahedron, or equivalently, intersect the centers of all of the dodecahedron&#x27;s faces.

A cube can be inscribed in a regular dodecahedron, with some of the diagonals of the pentagonal faces of the dodecahedron serving as the cube&#x27;s edges; therefore, the edge lengths are in the golden ratio. The cube&#x27;s volume is times that of the dodecahedron&#x27;s. In fact, golden rectangles inside a dodecahedron are in golden proportions to an inscribed cube, such that edges of a cube and the long edges of a golden rectangle are themselves in ratio. On the other hand, the octahedron, which is the dual polyhedron of the cube, can inscribe an icosahedron, such that an icosahedron&#x27;s vertices touch the edges of an octahedron at points that divide its edges in golden ratio.

===Other properties===

The golden ratio&#x27;s &quot;decimal expansion&quot; can be calculated via root-finding methods, such as Newton&#x27;s method or Halley&#x27;s method, on the equation or on (to compute first). The time needed to compute digits of the golden ratio using Newton&#x27;s method is essentially , where is the time complexity of multiplying two -digit numbers. This is considerably faster than known algorithms for  and . An easily programmed alternative using only integer arithmetic is to calculate two large consecutive Fibonacci numbers and divide them. The ratio of Fibonacci numbers and , each over digits, yields over significant digits of the golden ratio. The decimal expansion of the golden ratio has been calculated to an accuracy of ten trillion () digits.

In the complex plane, the fifth roots of unity (for an integer ) satisfying are the vertices of a pentagon. They do not form a ring of quadratic integers, however the sum of any fifth root of unity and its complex conjugate, , &quot;is&quot; a quadratic integer, an element of . Specifically,

formula_54

This also holds for the remaining tenth roots of unity satisfying ,

formula_55

For the gamma function , the only solutions to the equation are and .

When the golden ratio is used as the base of a numeral system (see golden ratio base, sometimes dubbed &quot;phinary&quot; or &quot;-nary&quot;), quadratic integers in the ring – that is, numbers of the form for and in – have terminating representations, but rational fractions have non-terminating representations.

The golden ratio also appears in hyperbolic geometry, as the maximum distance from a point on one side of an ideal triangle to the closer of the other two sides: this distance, the side length of the equilateral triangle formed by the points of tangency of a circle inscribed within the ideal triangle, is .

The golden ratio appears in the theory of modular functions as well. For formula_56 let
formula_57
Then
formula_58
and
formula_59
where and in the continued fraction should be evaluated as . The function is invariant under , a congruence subgroup of the modular group. Also for positive real numbers and such that

 is a Pisot–Vijayaraghavan number.

==Applications and observations==
===Architecture===

The Swiss architect Le Corbusier, famous for his contributions to the modern international style, centered his design philosophy on systems of harmony and proportion. Le Corbusier&#x27;s faith in the mathematical order of the universe was closely bound to the golden ratio and the Fibonacci series, which he described as &quot;rhythms apparent to the eye and clear in their relations with one another. And these rhythms are at the very root of human activities. They resound in man by an organic inevitability, the same fine inevitability which causes the tracing out of the Golden Section by children, old men, savages and the learned.&quot;

Le Corbusier explicitly used the golden ratio in his Modulor system for the scale of architectural proportion. He saw this system as a continuation of the long tradition of Vitruvius, Leonardo da Vinci&#x27;s &quot;Vitruvian Man&quot;, the work of Leon Battista Alberti, and others who used the proportions of the human body to improve the appearance and function of architecture.

In addition to the golden ratio, Le Corbusier based the system on human measurements, Fibonacci numbers, and the double unit. He took suggestion of the golden ratio in human proportions to an extreme: he sectioned his model human body&#x27;s height at the navel with the two sections in golden ratio, then subdivided those sections in golden ratio at the knees and throat; he used these golden ratio proportions in the Modulor system. Le Corbusier&#x27;s 1927 Villa Stein in Garches exemplified the Modulor system&#x27;s application. The villa&#x27;s rectangular ground plan, elevation, and inner structure closely approximate golden rectangles.

Another Swiss architect, Mario Botta, bases many of his designs on geometric figures. Several private houses he designed in Switzerland are composed of squares and circles, cubes and cylinders. In a house he designed in Origlio, the golden ratio is the proportion between the central section and the side sections of the house.

===Art===
Leonardo da Vinci&#x27;s illustrations of polyhedra in Pacioli&#x27;s &quot;Divina proportione&quot; have led some to speculate that he incorporated the golden ratio in his paintings. But the suggestion that his &quot;Mona Lisa&quot;, for example, employs golden ratio proportions, is not supported by Leonardo&#x27;s own writings. Similarly, although Leonardo&#x27;s &quot;Vitruvian Man&quot; is often shown in connection with the golden ratio, the proportions of the figure do not actually match it, and the text only mentions whole number ratios.

Salvador Dalí, influenced by the works of Matila Ghyka, explicitly used the golden ratio in his masterpiece, &quot;The Sacrament of the Last Supper&quot;. The dimensions of the canvas are a golden rectangle. A huge dodecahedron, in perspective so that edges appear in golden ratio to one another, is suspended above and behind Jesus and dominates the composition.

A statistical study on 565 works of art of different great painters, performed in 1999, found that these artists had not used the golden ratio in the size of their canvases. The study concluded that the average ratio of the two sides of the paintings studied is , with averages for individual artists ranging from (Goya) to (Bellini). On the other hand, Pablo Tosto listed over 350 works by well-known artists, including more than 100 which have canvasses with golden rectangle and proportions, and others with proportions like , , , and .

===Books and design===
According to Jan Tschichold,

There was a time when deviations from the truly beautiful page proportions , , and the Golden Section were rare. Many books produced between 1550 and 1770 show these proportions exactly, to within half a millimeter.

According to some sources, the golden ratio is used in everyday design, for example in the proportions of playing cards, postcards, posters, light switch plates, and widescreen televisions.

===Flags===
The aspect ratio (width to height ratio) of the flag of Togo was intended to be the golden ratio, according to its designer.

===Music===
Ernő Lendvai analyzes Béla Bartók&#x27;s works as being based on two opposing systems, that of the golden ratio and the acoustic scale, though other music scholars reject that analysis. French composer Erik Satie used the golden ratio in several of his pieces, including &quot;Sonneries de la Rose+Croix&quot;. The golden ratio is also apparent in the organization of the sections in the music of Debussy&#x27;s &quot;Reflets dans l&#x27;eau (Reflections in water)&quot;, from &quot;Images&quot; (1st series, 1905), in which &quot;the sequence of keys is marked out by the intervals and and the main climax sits at the phi position&quot;.

The musicologist Roy Howat has observed that the formal boundaries of Debussy&#x27;s &quot;La Mer&quot; correspond exactly to the golden section. Trezise finds the intrinsic evidence &quot;remarkable&quot;, but cautions that no written or reported evidence suggests that Debussy consciously sought such proportions.

Music theorists including Hans Zender and Heinz Bohlen have experimented with the 833 cents scale, a musical scale based on using the golden ratio as its fundamental musical interval. When measured in cents, a logarithmic scale for musical intervals, the golden ratio is approximately 833.09 cents.

===Nature===


Johannes Kepler wrote that &quot;the image of man and woman stems from the divine proportion. In my opinion, the propagation of plants and the progenitive acts of animals are in the same ratio&quot;.

The psychologist Adolf Zeising noted that the golden ratio appeared in phyllotaxis and argued from these patterns in nature that the golden ratio was a universal law. Zeising wrote in 1854 of a universal orthogenetic law of &quot;striving for beauty and completeness in the realms of both nature and art&quot;.

However, some have argued that many apparent manifestations of the golden ratio in nature, especially in regard to animal dimensions, are fictitious.

===Physics===
The quasi-one-dimensional Ising ferromagnet &lt;chem display=inline&gt;CoNb2O6&lt;/chem&gt; (cobalt niobate) has predicted excitation states (with symmetry), that when probed with neutron scattering, showed its lowest two were in golden ratio. Specifically, these quantum phase transitions during spin excitation, which occur at near absolute zero temperature, showed pairs of kinks in its ordered-phase to spin-flips in its paramagnetic phase; revealing, just below its critical field, a spin dynamics with sharp modes at low energies approaching the golden mean.

===Optimization===
There is no known general algorithm to arrange a given number of nodes evenly on a sphere, for any of several definitions of even distribution (see, for example, &quot;Thomson problem&quot; or &quot;Tammes problem&quot;). However, a useful approximation results from dividing the sphere into parallel bands of equal surface area and placing one node in each band at longitudes spaced by a golden section of the circle, i.e. . This method was used to arrange the mirrors of the student-participatory satellite Starshine-3.
The golden ratio is a critical element to golden-section search as well.

==Disputed observations==
Examples of disputed observations of the golden ratio include the following:

* Specific proportions in the bodies of vertebrates (including humans) are often claimed to be in the golden ratio; for example the ratio of successive phalangeal and metacarpal bones (finger bones) has been said to approximate the golden ratio. There is a large variation in the real measures of these elements in specific individuals, however, and the proportion in question is often significantly different from the golden ratio.
* The shells of mollusks such as the nautilus are often claimed to be in the golden ratio. The growth of nautilus shells follows a logarithmic spiral, and it is sometimes erroneously claimed that any logarithmic spiral is related to the golden ratio, or sometimes claimed that each new chamber is golden-proportioned relative to the previous one. However, measurements of nautilus shells do not support this claim.
* Historian John Man states that both the pages and text area of the Gutenberg Bible were &quot;based on the golden section shape&quot;. However, according to his own measurements, the ratio of height to width of the pages is .
* Studies by psychologists, starting with Gustav Fechner , have been devised to test the idea that the golden ratio plays a role in human perception of beauty. While Fechner found a preference for rectangle ratios centered on the golden ratio, later attempts to carefully test such a hypothesis have been, at best, inconclusive.
* In investing, some practitioners of technical analysis use the golden ratio to indicate support of a price level, or resistance to price increases, of a stock or commodity; after significant price changes up or down, new support and resistance levels are supposedly found at or near prices related to the starting price via the golden ratio. The use of the golden ratio in investing is also related to more complicated patterns described by Fibonacci numbers (e.g. Elliott wave principle and Fibonacci retracement). However, other market analysts have published analyses suggesting that these percentages and patterns are not supported by the data.

===Egyptian pyramids===

The Great Pyramid of Giza (also known as the Pyramid of Cheops or Khufu) has been analyzed by pyramidologists as having a doubled Kepler triangle as its cross-section. If this theory were true, the golden ratio would describe the ratio of distances from the midpoint of one of the sides of the pyramid to its apex, and from the same midpoint to the center of the pyramid&#x27;s base. However, imprecision in measurement caused in part by the removal of the outer surface of the pyramid makes it impossible to distinguish this theory from other numerical theories of the proportions of the pyramid, based on pi or on whole-number ratios. The consensus of modern scholars is that this pyramid&#x27;s proportions are not based on the golden ratio, because such a basis would be inconsistent both with what is known about Egyptian mathematics from the time of construction of the pyramid, and with Egyptian theories of architecture and proportion used in their other works.

===The Parthenon===
The Parthenon&#x27;s façade (c. 432 BC) as well as elements of its façade and elsewhere are said by some to be circumscribed by golden rectangles. Other scholars deny that the Greeks had any aesthetic association with golden ratio. For example, Keith Devlin says, &quot;Certainly, the oft repeated assertion that the Parthenon in Athens is based on the golden ratio is not supported by actual measurements. In fact, the entire story about the Greeks and golden ratio seems to be without foundation.&quot; Midhat J. Gazalé affirms that &quot;It was not until Euclid ... that the golden ratio&#x27;s mathematical properties were studied.&quot;

From measurements of 15 temples, 18 monumental tombs, 8 sarcophagi, and 58 grave stelae from the fifth century BC to the second century AD, one researcher concluded that the golden ratio was totally absent from Greek architecture of the classical fifth century BC, and almost absent during the following six centuries.
Later sources like Vitruvius (first century BC) exclusively discuss proportions that can be expressed in whole numbers, i.e. commensurate as opposed to irrational proportions.

===Modern art===

The Section d&#x27;Or (&#x27;Golden Section&#x27;) was a collective of painters, sculptors, poets and critics associated with Cubism and Orphism. Active from 1911 to around 1914, they adopted the name both to highlight that Cubism represented the continuation of a grand tradition, rather than being an isolated movement, and in homage to the mathematical harmony associated with Georges Seurat. (Several authors have claimed that Seurat employed the golden ratio in his paintings, but Seurat&#x27;s writings and paintings suggest that he employed simple whole-number ratios and any approximation of the golden ratio was coincidental.) The Cubists observed in its harmonies, geometric structuring of motion and form, &quot;the primacy of idea over nature&quot;, &quot;an absolute scientific clarity of conception&quot;. However, despite this general interest in mathematical harmony, whether the paintings featured in the celebrated 1912 &quot;Salon de la Section d&#x27;Or&quot; exhibition used the golden ratio in any compositions is more difficult to determine. Livio, for example, claims that they did not, and Marcel Duchamp said as much in an interview. On the other hand, an analysis suggests that Juan Gris made use of the golden ratio in composing works that were likely, but not definitively, shown at the exhibition. Art historian Daniel Robbins has argued that in addition to referencing the mathematical term, the exhibition&#x27;s name also refers to the earlier &quot;Bandeaux d&#x27;Or&quot; group, with which Albert Gleizes and other former members of the Abbaye de Créteil had been involved.

Piet Mondrian has been said to have used the golden section extensively in his geometrical paintings, though other experts (including critic Yve-Alain Bois) have discredited these claims.

<text>A genome is all the genetic information of an organism. It consists of nucleotide sequences of DNA (or RNA in RNA viruses). The nuclear genome includes protein-coding genes and non-coding genes, other functional regions of the genome such as regulatory sequences (see non-coding DNA), and often a substantial fraction of junk DNA with no evident function. Almost all eukaryotes have mitochondria and a small mitochondrial genome. Algae and plants also contain chloroplasts with a chloroplast genome.

The study of the genome is called genomics. The genomes of many organisms have been sequenced and various regions have been annotated. The first genome to be sequenced was that of the virus φX174 in 1977; the first genome sequence of a prokaryote (&quot;Haemophilus influenzae&quot;) was published in 1995; the yeast (&quot;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&quot;) genome was the first eukaryotic genome to be sequenced in 1996. The Human Genome Project was started in October 1990, and the first draft sequences of the human genome were reported in February 2001.

== Origin of the term ==
The term &quot;genome&quot; was created in 1920 by Hans Winkler, professor of botany at the University of Hamburg, Germany. The website Oxford Dictionaries and the Online Etymology Dictionary suggest the name is a blend of the words &quot;gene&quot; and &quot;chromosome&quot;. However, see omics for a more thorough discussion. A few related &quot;-ome&quot; words already existed, such as &quot;biome&quot; and &quot;rhizome&quot;, forming a vocabulary into which &quot;genome&quot; fits systematically.

== Definition ==
The term &quot;genome&quot; usually refers to the DNA (or sometimes RNA) molecules that carry the genetic information in an organism, but sometimes it is uncertain which molecules to include; for example, bacteria usually have one or two large DNA molecules (chromosomes) that contain all of the essential genetic material but they also contain smaller extrachromosomal plasmid molecules that carry important genetic information. In the scientific literature, the term &#x27;genome&#x27; usually refers to the large chromosomal DNA molecules in bacteria.

===Nuclear genome===
Eukaryotic genomes are even more difficult to define because almost all eukaryotic species contain nuclear chromosomes plus extra DNA molecules in the mitochondria. In addition, algae and plants have chloroplast DNA. Most textbooks make a distinction between the nuclear genome and the organelle (mitochondria and chloroplast) genomes so when they speak of, say, the human genome, they are only referring to the genetic material in the nucleus. This is the most common use of &#x27;genome&#x27; in the scientific literature.

===Ploidy===
Most eukaryotes are diploid, meaning that there are two of each chromosome in the nucleus but the &#x27;genome&#x27; refers to only one copy of each chromosome. Some eukaryotes have distinctive sex chromosomes, such as the X and Y chromosomes of mammals, so the technical definition of the genome must include both copies of the sex chromosomes. For example, the standard reference genome of humans consists of one copy of each of the 22 autosomes plus one X chromosome and one Y chromosome.

== Sequencing and mapping ==

A genome sequence is the complete list of the nucleotides (A, C, G, and T for DNA genomes) that make up all the chromosomes of an individual or a species. Within a species, the vast majority of nucleotides are identical between individuals, but sequencing multiple individuals is necessary to understand the genetic diversity. 
In 1976, Walter Fiers at the University of Ghent (Belgium) was the first to establish the complete nucleotide sequence of a viral RNA-genome (Bacteriophage MS2). The next year, Fred Sanger completed the first DNA-genome sequence: Phage X174, of 5386 base pairs. The first bacterial genome to be sequenced was that of Haemophilus influenzae, completed by a team at The Institute for Genomic Research in 1995. A few months later, the first eukaryotic genome was completed, with sequences of the 16 chromosomes of budding yeast &quot;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&quot; published as the result of a European-led effort begun in the mid-1980s. The first genome sequence for an archaeon, &quot;Methanococcus jannaschii&quot;, was completed in 1996, again by The Institute for Genomic Research.

The development of new technologies has made genome sequencing dramatically cheaper and easier, and the number of complete genome sequences is growing rapidly. The US National Institutes of Health maintains one of several comprehensive databases of genomic information. Among the thousands of completed genome sequencing projects include those for rice, a mouse, the plant &quot;Arabidopsis thaliana&quot;, the puffer fish, and the bacteria E. coli. In December 2013, scientists first sequenced the entire &quot;genome&quot; of a Neanderthal, an extinct species of humans. The genome was extracted from the toe bone of a 130,000-year-old Neanderthal found in a Siberian cave.

== Viral genomes ==
Viral genomes can be composed of either RNA or DNA. The genomes of RNA viruses can be either single-stranded RNA or double-stranded RNA, and may contain one or more separate RNA molecules (segments: monopartit or multipartit genome). DNA viruses can have either single-stranded or double-stranded genomes. Most DNA virus genomes are composed of a single, linear molecule of DNA, but some are made up of a circular DNA molecule.

== Prokaryotic genomes ==
Prokaryotes and eukaryotes have DNA genomes. Archaea and most bacteria have a single circular chromosome, however, some bacterial species have linear or multiple chromosomes. If the DNA is replicated faster than the bacterial cells divide, multiple copies of the chromosome can be present in a single cell, and if the cells divide faster than the DNA can be replicated, multiple replication of the chromosome is initiated before the division occurs, allowing daughter cells to inherit complete genomes and already partially replicated chromosomes. Most prokaryotes have very little repetitive DNA in their genomes. However, some symbiotic bacteria (e.g. &quot;Serratia symbiotica&quot;) have reduced genomes and a high fraction of pseudogenes: only ~40% of their DNA encodes proteins.

Some bacteria have auxiliary genetic material, also part of their genome, which is carried in plasmids. For this, the word &quot;genome&quot; should not be used as a synonym of &quot;chromosome&quot;.

== Eukaryotic genomes ==
Eukaryotic genomes are composed of one or more linear DNA chromosomes. The number of chromosomes varies widely from Jack jumper ants and an asexual nemotode, which each have only one pair, to a fern species that has 720 pairs. It is surprising the amount of DNA that eukaryotic genomes contain compared to other genomes. The amount is even more than what is necessary for DNA protein-coding and noncoding genes because eukaryotic genomes show as much as 64,000-fold variation in their sizes. However, this special characteristic is caused by the presence of repetitive DNA, and transposable elements (TEs).

A typical human cell has two copies of each of 22 autosomes, one inherited from each parent, plus two sex chromosomes, making it diploid. Gametes, such as ova, sperm, spores, and pollen, are haploid, meaning they carry only one copy of each chromosome. In addition to the chromosomes in the nucleus, organelles such as the chloroplasts and mitochondria have their own DNA. Mitochondria are sometimes said to have their own genome often referred to as the &quot;mitochondrial genome&quot;. The DNA found within the chloroplast may be referred to as the &quot;plastome&quot;. Like the bacteria they originated from, mitochondria and chloroplasts have a circular chromosome.

Unlike prokaryotes where exon-intron organization of protein coding genes exists but is rather exceptional, eukaryotes generally have these features in their genes and their genomes contain variable amounts of repetitive DNA. In mammals and plants, the majority of the genome is composed of repetitive DNA.

=== DNA sequencing ===
High-throughput technology makes sequencing to assemble new genomes accessible to everyone. Sequence polymorphisms are typically discovered by comparing resequenced isolates to a reference, whereas analyses of coverage depth and mapping topology can provide details regarding structural variations such as chromosomal translocations and segmental duplications.

=== Coding sequences ===
DNA sequences that carry the instructions to make proteins are referred to as coding sequences. The proportion of the genome occupied by coding sequences varies widely. A larger genome does not necessarily contain more genes, and the proportion of non-repetitive DNA decreases along with increasing genome size in complex eukaryotes.

=== Noncoding sequences ===

Noncoding sequences include introns, sequences for non-coding RNAs, regulatory regions, and repetitive DNA. Noncoding sequences make up 98% of the human genome. There are two categories of repetitive DNA in the genome: tandem repeats and interspersed repeats.

==== Tandem repeats ====
Short, non-coding sequences that are repeated head-to-tail are called tandem repeats. Microsatellites consisting of 2–5 basepair repeats, while minisatellite repeats are 30–35 bp. Tandem repeats make up about 4% of the human genome and 9% of the fruit fly genome. Tandem repeats can be functional. For example, telomeres are composed of the tandem repeat TTAGGG in mammals, and they play an important role in protecting the ends of the chromosome.

In other cases, expansions in the number of tandem repeats in exons or introns can cause disease. For example, the human gene huntingtin (Htt) typically contains 6–29 tandem repeats of the nucleotides CAG (encoding a polyglutamine tract). An expansion to over 36 repeats results in Huntington&#x27;s disease, a neurodegenerative disease. Twenty human disorders are known to result from similar tandem repeat expansions in various genes. The mechanism by which proteins with expanded polygulatamine tracts cause death of neurons is not fully understood. One possibility is that the proteins fail to fold properly and avoid degradation, instead accumulating in aggregates that also sequester important transcription factors, thereby altering gene expression.

Tandem repeats are usually caused by slippage during replication, unequal crossing-over and gene conversion.

==== Transposable elements ====
Transposable elements (TEs) are sequences of DNA with a defined structure that are able to change their location in the genome. TEs are categorized as either as a mechanism that replicates by copy-and-paste or as a mechanism that can be excised from the genome and inserted at a new location. In the human genome, there are three important classes of TEs that make up more than 45% of the human DNA; these classes are The long interspersed nuclear elements (LINEs), The interspersed nuclear elements (SINEs), and endogenous retroviruses. These elements have a big potential to modify the genetic control in a host organism.

The movement of TEs is a driving force of genome evolution in eukaryotes because their insertion can disrupt gene functions, homologous recombination between TEs can produce duplications, and TE can shuffle exons and regulatory sequences to new locations.

===== Retrotransposons =====
Retrotransposons are found mostly in eukaryotes but not found in prokaryotes. Retrotransposons form a large portion of the genomes of many eukaryotes. A retrotransposon is a transposable element that transposes through an RNA intermediate. Retrotransposons are composed of DNA, but are transcribed into RNA for transposition, then the RNA transcript is copied back to DNA formation with the help of a specific enzyme called reverse transcriptase. A retrotransposon that carries reverse transcriptase in its sequence can trigger its own transposition but retrotransposons that lack a reverse transcriptase must use reverse transcriptase synthesized by another retrotransposon. Retrotransposons can be transcribed into RNA, which are then duplicated at another site into the genome. Retrotransposons can be divided into long terminal repeats (LTRs) and non-long terminal repeats (Non-LTRs).

Long terminal repeats (LTRs) are derived from ancient retroviral infections, so they encode proteins related to retroviral proteins including gag (structural proteins of the virus), pol (reverse transcriptase and integrase), pro (protease), and in some cases env (envelope) genes. These genes are flanked by long repeats at both 5&#x27; and 3&#x27; ends. It has been reported that LTRs consist of the largest fraction in most plant genome and might account for the huge variation in genome size.

Non-long terminal repeats (Non-LTRs) are classified as long interspersed nuclear elements (LINEs), short interspersed nuclear elements (SINEs), and Penelope-like elements (PLEs). In &quot;Dictyostelium discoideum&quot;, there is another DIRS-like elements belong to Non-LTRs. Non-LTRs are widely spread in eukaryotic genomes.

Long interspersed elements (LINEs) encode genes for reverse transcriptase and endonuclease, making them autonomous transposable elements. The human genome has around 500,000 LINEs, taking around 17% of the genome.

Short interspersed elements (SINEs) are usually less than 500 base pairs and are non-autonomous, so they rely on the proteins encoded by LINEs for transposition. The Alu element is the most common SINE found in primates. It is about 350 base pairs and occupies about 11% of the human genome with around 1,500,000 copies.

===== DNA transposons =====
DNA transposons encode a transposase enzyme between inverted terminal repeats. When expressed, the transposase recognizes the terminal inverted repeats that flank the transposon and catalyzes its excision and reinsertion in a new site. This cut-and-paste mechanism typically reinserts transposons near their original location (within 100 kb). DNA transposons are found in bacteria and make up 3% of the human genome and 12% of the genome of the roundworm &quot;C. elegans&quot;.

== Genome size ==

Genome size is the total number of the DNA base pairs in one copy of a haploid genome. Genome size varies widely across species. Invertebrates have small genomes, this is also correlated to a small number of transposable elements. Fish and Amphibians have intermediate-size genomes, and birds have relatively small genomes but it has been suggested that birds lost a substantial portion of their genomes during the phase of transition to flight.  Before this loss, DNA methylation allows the adequate expansion of the genome.

In humans, the nuclear genome comprises approximately 3.1 billion nucleotides of DNA, divided into 24 linear molecules, the shortest 45 000 000 nucleotides in length and the longest 248 000 000 nucleotides, each contained in a different chromosome. There is no clear and consistent correlation between morphological complexity and genome size in either prokaryotes or lower eukaryotes. Genome size is largely a function of the expansion and contraction of repetitive DNA elements.

Since genomes are very complex, one research strategy is to reduce the number of genes in a genome to the bare minimum and still have the organism in question survive. There is experimental work being done on minimal genomes for single cell organisms as well as minimal genomes for multi-cellular organisms (see developmental biology). The work is both &quot;in vivo&quot; and &quot;in silico&quot;.

=== Genome size differences due to transposable elements ===
There are many enormous differences in size in genomes, specially mentioned before in the multicellular eukaryotic genomes. Much of this is due to the differing abundances of transposable elements, which evolve by creating new copies of themselves in the chromosomes. Eukaryote genomes often contain many thousands of copies of these elements, most of which have acquired mutations that make them defective.

== Genomic alterations ==
All the cells of an organism originate from a single cell, so they are expected to have identical genomes; however, in some cases, differences arise. Both the process of copying DNA during cell division and exposure to environmental mutagens can result in mutations in somatic cells. In some cases, such mutations lead to cancer because they cause cells to divide more quickly and invade surrounding tissues. In certain lymphocytes in the human immune system, V(D)J recombination generates different genomic sequences such that each cell produces a unique antibody or T cell receptors.

During meiosis, diploid cells divide twice to produce haploid germ cells. During this process, recombination results in a reshuffling of the genetic material from homologous chromosomes so each gamete has a unique genome.

=== Genome-wide reprogramming ===
Genome-wide reprogramming in mouse primordial germ cells involves epigenetic imprint erasure leading to totipotency. Reprogramming is facilitated by active DNA demethylation, a process that entails the DNA base excision repair pathway. This pathway is employed in the erasure of CpG methylation (5mC) in primordial germ cells. The erasure of 5mC occurs via its conversion to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) driven by high levels of the ten-eleven dioxygenase enzymes TET1 and TET2.

== Genome evolution ==
Genomes are more than the sum of an organism&#x27;s genes and have traits that may be measured and studied without reference to the details of any particular genes and their products. Researchers compare traits such as karyotype (chromosome number), genome size, gene order, codon usage bias, and GC-content to determine what mechanisms could have produced the great variety of genomes that exist today (for recent overviews, see Brown 2002; Saccone and Pesole 2003; Benfey and Protopapas 2004; Gibson and Muse 2004; Reese 2004; Gregory 2005).

Duplications play a major role in shaping the genome. Duplication may range from extension of short tandem repeats, to duplication of a cluster of genes, and all the way to duplication of entire chromosomes or even entire genomes. Such duplications are probably fundamental to the creation of genetic novelty.

Horizontal gene transfer is invoked to explain how there is often an extreme similarity between small portions of the genomes of two organisms that are otherwise very distantly related. Horizontal gene transfer seems to be common among many microbes. Also, eukaryotic cells seem to have experienced a transfer of some genetic material from their chloroplast and mitochondrial genomes to their nuclear chromosomes. Recent empirical data suggest an important role of viruses and sub-viral RNA-networks to represent a main driving role to generate genetic novelty and natural genome editing.

== In fiction ==
Works of science fiction illustrate concerns about the availability of genome sequences.

Michael Crichton&#x27;s 1990 novel &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; and the subsequent film tell the story of a billionaire who creates a theme park of cloned dinosaurs on a remote island, with disastrous outcomes. A geneticist extracts dinosaur DNA from the blood of ancient mosquitoes and fills in the gaps with DNA from modern species to create several species of dinosaurs. A chaos theorist is asked to give his expert opinion on the safety of engineering an ecosystem with the dinosaurs, and he repeatedly warns that the outcomes of the project will be unpredictable and ultimately uncontrollable. These warnings about the perils of using genomic information are a major theme of the book.

The 1997 film &quot;Gattaca&quot; is set in a futurist society where genomes of children are engineered to contain the most ideal combination of their parents&#x27; traits, and metrics such as risk of heart disease and predicted life expectancy are documented for each person based on their genome. People conceived outside of the eugenics program, known as &quot;In-Valids&quot; suffer discrimination and are relegated to menial occupations. The protagonist of the film is an In-Valid who works to defy the supposed genetic odds and achieve his dream of working as a space navigator. The film warns against a future where genomic information fuels prejudice and extreme class differences between those who can and cannot afford genetically engineered children.

<text>Gaia philosophy (named after Gaia, Greek goddess of the Earth) is a broadly inclusive term for relating concepts about, humanity as an effect of the life of this planet.

The Gaia hypothesis holds that all organisms on a life-giving planet regulate the biosphere in such a way as to promote its habitability. Gaia concepts draw a connection between the survivability of a species (hence its evolutionary course) and its usefulness to the survival of other species. While there were a number of precursors to Gaia hypothesis, the first scientific form of this idea was proposed as the Gaia hypothesis by James Lovelock, a UK chemist, in 1970. The Gaia hypothesis deals with the concept of biological homeostasis, and claims the resident life forms of a host planet coupled with their environment have acted and act like a single, self-regulating system. This system includes the near-surface rocks, the soil, and the atmosphere. These theories are, however, significant in green politics.

== Predecessors to the Gaia theory ==
There are some mystical, scientific and religious predecessors to the Gaia philosophy, which had a Gaia-like conceptual basis. Many religious mythologies had a view of Earth as being a whole that is greater than the sum of its parts (e.g. some Native American religions and various forms of shamanism).

Isaac Newton wrote of the earth, &quot;Thus this Earth resembles a great animal or rather inanimate vegetable, draws in æthereall breath for its dayly refreshment &amp; vitall ferment &amp; transpires again with gross exhalations, And according to the condition of all other things living ought to have its times of beginning youth old age &amp; perishing.&quot;

Pierre Teilhard de Chardin, a paleontologist and geologist, believed that evolution fractally unfolded from cell to organism to planet to solar system and ultimately the whole universe, as we humans see it from our limited perspective. Teilhard later influenced Thomas Berry and many Catholic humanist thinkers of the 20th century.

Lewis Thomas believed that Earth should be viewed as a single cell; he derived this view from Johannes Kepler&#x27;s view of Earth as a single round organism.

Buckminster Fuller is generally credited with making the idea respectable in Western scientific circles in the 20th century. Building to some degree on his observations and artifacts, e.g. the Dymaxion map of the Earth he created, others began to ask if there was a way to make the Gaia theory scientifically sound.

In 1931, L.G.M. Baas Becking delivered an inaugural lecture about Gaia in the sense of life and earth. 

Oberon Zell-Ravenheart in 1970 in an article in &quot;Green Egg&quot; Magazine, independently articulated the Gaia Thesis.

Many believe that these ideas cannot be considered scientific hypotheses; by definition a scientific hypothesis must make testable predictions. As the above claims are not currently testable, they are outside the bounds of current science. This does not mean that these ideas are not theoretically testable. As one can postulate tests that could be applied, given enough time and space, then these ideas should be seen as scientific hypotheses.

These are conjectures and perhaps can only be considered as social and maybe political philosophy; they may have implications for theology, or &quot;thealogy&quot; as Zell-Ravenheart and Isaac Bonewits put it.

== Range of views ==

According to James Kirchner there is a spectrum of Gaia hypotheses, ranging from the undeniable to radical. At one end is the undeniable statement that the organisms on the Earth have radically altered its composition. A stronger position is that the Earth&#x27;s biosphere effectively acts as if it is a self-organizing system which works in such a way as to keep its systems in some kind of equilibrium that is conducive to life. Today many scientists consider that such a view (and any stronger views) are unlikely to be correct. An even stronger claim is that all lifeforms are part of a single planetary being, called Gaia. In this view, the atmosphere, the seas, the terrestrial crust would be the result of interventions carried out by Gaia, through the coevolving diversity of living organisms.

The most extreme form of Gaia theory is that the entire Earth is a single unified organism with a highly intelligent mind that arose as an emergent property of the whole biosphere. In this view, the Earth&#x27;s biosphere is &quot;consciously&quot; manipulating the climate in order to make conditions more conducive to life. Scientists contend that there is no evidence at all to support this last point of view, and it has come about because many people do not understand the concept of homeostasis. Many non-scientists instinctively and incorrectly see homeostasis as a process that requires conscious control.

The more speculative versions of Gaia, including versions in which it is believed that the Earth is actually conscious, sentient, and highly intelligent, are usually considered outside the bounds of what is usually considered science.

== Gaia in biology and science ==
Buckminster Fuller has been credited as the first to incorporate scientific ideas into a Gaia theory, which he did with his Dymaxion map of the Earth.

The first scientifically rigorous theory was the Gaia hypothesis by James Lovelock, a UK chemist.

A variant of this hypothesis was developed by Lynn Margulis, a microbiologist, in 1979.
Her version is sometimes called the &quot;Gaia Theory&quot; (note uppercase-T). Her model is more limited in scope than the one that Lovelock proposed.

Whether this sort of system is present on Earth is still open to debate. Some relatively simple homeostatic mechanisms are generally accepted. For example, when atmospheric carbon dioxide levels rise, plants are able to grow better and thus remove more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Other biological effects and feedbacks exist, but the extent to which these mechanisms have stabilized and modified the Earth&#x27;s overall climate is largely not known.

The Gaia hypothesis is sometimes viewed from significantly different philosophical perspectives. Some environmentalists view it as an almost conscious process, in which the Earth&#x27;s ecosystem is literally viewed as a single unified organism. Some evolutionary biologists, on the other hand, view it as an undirected emergent property of the ecosystem: as each individual species pursues its own self-interest, their combined actions tend to have counterbalancing effects on environmental change. Proponents of this view sometimes point to examples of life&#x27;s actions in the past that have resulted in dramatic change rather than stable equilibrium, such as the conversion of the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere from a reducing environment to an oxygen-rich one.

Depending on how strongly the case is stated, the hypothesis conflicts with mainstream neo-Darwinism. Most biologists would accept Daisyworld-style homeostasis as possible, but would certainly not accept the idea that this equates to the whole biosphere acting as one organism.

A very small number of scientists, and a much larger number of environmental activists, claim that Earth&#x27;s biosphere is &quot;consciously&quot; manipulating the climate in order to make conditions more conducive to life. Scientists contend that there is no evidence to support this belief.

== Gaia in the social sciences and politics ==
A social science view of Gaia theory is the role of humans as a keystone species who may be able to accomplish global homeostasis. Whilst a few social scientists who draw inspiration from &#x27;organic&#x27; views of society have embraced Gaia philosophy as a way to explain the human-nature interconnections, most professional social scientists are more involved in reflecting upon the way Gaia philosophy is used and engaged with within sub-sections of society. Alan Marshall, in the Department of Social Sciences at Mahidol University, for example, reflects upon the way Gaia philosophy has been used and advocated in various societal settings by environmentalists, spiritualists, managers, economists, and scientists and engineers. As Marshall explains, most social scientists had already given up on systems ideas of society in the 1960s before Gaia philosophy was born under James Lovelock&#x27;s ideas since such ideas were interpreted as supporting conservatism and traditionalism. Gaia theory also influenced the dynamics of green politics.

== Gaia in religion ==

Rosemary Radford Ruether, the American feminist scholar and theologian, wrote a book called &quot;Gaia and God: An Ecofeminist Theology of Earth Healing&quot;.

A book edited by Allan Hunt Badiner called Dharma Gaia explores the ground where Buddhism and ecology meet through writings by the Dalai Lama, Gary Snyder, Thich Nhat Hanh, Allen Ginsberg, David Abram, Joanna Macy, Robert Aitken, and 25 other Buddhists and ecologists.

Gaianism, an earth-centered philosophical, holistic, and spiritual belief that shares expressions with earth religions and paganism while not identifying exclusively with any specific religion, sprang from the gaia hypothesis.

==Criticism==
One of the most problematic issues with referring to Gaia as an organism is its apparent failure to meet the biological criterion of being able to reproduce. Richard Dawkins has asserted that the planet is not the offspring of any parents and is unable to reproduce.

<text>The greenhouse effect occurs when greenhouse gases in a planet&#x27;s atmosphere insulate the planet from losing heat to space, raising its surface temperature. Surface heating can happen from an internal heat source (as in the case of Jupiter) or come from an external source, such as its host star. In the case of Earth, the Sun emits shortwave radiation (sunlight) that passes through greenhouse gases to heat the Earth&#x27;s surface. In response, the Earth&#x27;s surface emits longwave radiation that is mostly absorbed by greenhouse gases. The absorption of longwave radiation prevents it from reaching space, reducing the rate at which the Earth can cool off.

Without the greenhouse effect, the Earth&#x27;s average surface temperature would be as cold as . This is of course much less than the 20th century average of about . In addition to naturally present greenhouse gases, burning of fossil fuels has increased amounts of carbon dioxide and methane in the atmosphere. As a result, global warming of about has occurred since the Industrial Revolution, with the global average surface temperature increasing at a rate of per decade since 1981.

All objects with a temperature above absolute zero emit thermal radiation. The wavelengths of thermal radiation emitted by the Sun and Earth differ because their surface temperatures are different. The Sun has a surface temperature of , so it emits most of its energy as shortwave radiation in near-infrared and visible wavelengths (as sunlight). In contrast, Earth&#x27;s surface has a much lower temperature, so it emits longwave radiation at mid- and far-infrared wavelengths. A gas is a greenhouse gas if it absorbs longwave radiation. Earth&#x27;s atmosphere absorbs only 23% of incoming shortwave radiation, but absorbs 90% of the longwave radiation emitted by the surface, thus accumulating energy and warming the Earth&#x27;s surface.

The existence of the greenhouse effect (while not named as such) was proposed as early as 1824 by Joseph Fourier. The argument and the evidence were further strengthened by Claude Pouillet in 1827 and 1838. In 1856 Eunice Newton Foote demonstrated that the warming effect of the sun is greater for air with water vapour than for dry air, and the effect is even greater with carbon dioxide. The term &quot;greenhouse&quot; was first applied to this phenomenon by Nils Gustaf Ekholm in 1901.

== Definition ==
The &quot;greenhouse effect&quot; on Earth is defined as: &quot;The infrared radiative effect of all infrared absorbing constituents in the atmosphere. Greenhouse gases (GHGs), clouds, and some aerosols absorb terrestrial radiation emitted by the Earth&#x27;s surface and elsewhere in the atmosphere.&quot;

The &quot;enhanced greenhouse effect&quot; describes the fact that by increasing the concentration of GHGs in the atmosphere (due to human action), the natural greenhouse effect is increased.

== Terminology ==
The term &quot;greenhouse effect&quot; comes from an to greenhouses. Both greenhouses and the &quot;greenhouse effect&quot; work by retaining heat from sunlight, but the way they retain heat differs. Greenhouses retain heat mainly by blocking convection (the movement of air). In contrast, the greenhouse effect retains heat by restricting radiative transfer through the air and reducing the rate at which thermal radiation is emitted into space.

==History of discovery and investigation==

The existence of the greenhouse effect, while not named as such, was proposed as early as 1824 by Joseph Fourier. The argument and the evidence were further strengthened by Claude Pouillet in 1827 and 1838. In 1856 Eunice Newton Foote demonstrated that the warming effect of the sun is greater for air with water vapour than for dry air, and the effect is even greater with carbon dioxide. She concluded that &quot;An atmosphere of that gas would give to our earth a high temperature...&quot;

John Tyndall was the first to measure the infrared absorption and emission of various gases and vapors. From 1859 onwards, he showed that the effect was due to a very small proportion of the atmosphere, with the main gases having no effect, and was largely due to water vapor, though small percentages of hydrocarbons and carbon dioxide had a significant effect. The effect was more fully quantified by Svante Arrhenius in 1896, who made the first quantitative prediction of global warming due to a hypothetical doubling of atmospheric carbon dioxide. The term &quot;greenhouse&quot; was first applied to this phenomenon by Nils Gustaf Ekholm in 1901.

==Measurement==

Matter emits thermal radiation at a rate that is directly proportional to the fourth power of its temperature. Some of the radiation emitted by the Earth&#x27;s surface is absorbed by greenhouse gases and clouds. Without this absorption, Earth&#x27;s surface would have an average temperature of . However, because some of the radiation is absorbed, Earth&#x27;s average surface temperature is around . Thus, the Earth&#x27;s greenhouse effect may be measured as a &quot;temperature change&quot; of .

Thermal radiation is characterized by how much energy it carries, typically in watts per square meter (W/m). Scientists also measure the greenhouse effect based on how much more longwave thermal radiation leaves the Earth&#x27;s surface than reaches space. Currently, longwave radiation leaves the surface at an average rate of 398 W/m, but only 239 W/m reaches space. Thus, the Earth&#x27;s greenhouse effect can also be measured as an &quot;energy flow change&quot; of 159 W/m. The greenhouse effect can be expressed as a fraction (0.40) or percentage (40%) of the longwave thermal radiation that leaves Earth&#x27;s surface but does not reach space.

Whether the greenhouse effect is expressed as a change in temperature or as a change in longwave thermal radiation, the same effect is being measured.

== Role in climate change ==
Strengthening of the greenhouse effect through additional greenhouse gases from human activities is known as the &quot;enhanced greenhouse effect&quot;. As well as being inferred from measurements by ARGO, CERES and other instruments throughout the 21st century, this increase in radiative forcing from human activity has been observed directly, and is attributable mainly to increased atmospheric carbon dioxide levels.
 is produced by fossil fuel burning and other activities such as cement production and tropical deforestation. Measurements of from the Mauna Loa Observatory show that concentrations have increased from about 313 parts per million (ppm) in 1960, passing the 400 ppm milestone in 2013. The current observed amount of exceeds the geological record maxima (≈300 ppm) from ice core data.

Over the past 800,000 years, ice core data shows that carbon dioxide has varied from values as low as 180 ppm to the pre-industrial level of 270 ppm. Paleoclimatologists consider variations in carbon dioxide concentration to be a fundamental factor influencing climate variations over this time scale.

== Energy balance and temperature ==
=== Incoming shortwave radiation ===

Hotter matter emits shorter wavelengths of radiation. As a result, the Sun emits shortwave radiation as sunlight while the Earth and its atmosphere emit longwave radiation. Sunlight includes ultraviolet, visible light, and near-infrared radiation.

Sunlight is reflected and absorbed by the Earth and its atmosphere. The atmosphere and clouds reflect about 23% and absorb 23%. The surface reflects 7% and absorbs 48%. Overall, Earth reflects about 30% of the incoming sunlight, and absorbs the rest (240 W/m).

=== Outgoing longwave radiation ===

The Earth and its atmosphere emit &quot;longwave radiation&quot;, also known as &quot;thermal infrared&quot; or &quot;terrestrial radiation&quot;. Informally, longwave radiation is sometimes called &quot;thermal radiation&quot;. Outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) is the radiation from Earth and its atmosphere that passes through the atmosphere and into space.

The greenhouse effect can be directly seen in graphs of Earth&#x27;s outgoing longwave radiation as a function of frequency (or wavelength). The area between the curve for longwave radiation emitted by Earth&#x27;s surface and the curve for outgoing longwave radiation indicates the size of the greenhouse effect.

Different substances are responsible for reducing the radiation energy reaching space at different frequencies; for some frequencies, multiple substances play a role. Carbon dioxide is understood to be responsible for the dip in outgoing radiation (and associated rise in the greenhouse effect) at around 667 cm−1 (equivalent to a wavelength of 15 microns).

Each layer of the atmosphere with greenhouse gases absorbs some of the longwave radiation being radiated upwards from lower layers. It also emits longwave radiation in all directions, both upwards and downwards, in equilibrium with the amount it has absorbed. This results in less radiative heat loss and more warmth below. Increasing the concentration of the gases increases the amount of absorption and emission, and thereby causing more heat to be retained at the surface and in the layers below.

=== Effective temperature ===

The power of outgoing longwave radiation emitted by a planet corresponds to the &quot;effective temperature&quot; of the planet. The effective temperature is the temperature that a planet radiating with a uniform temperature (a blackbody) would need to have in order to radiate the same amount of energy.

This concept may be used to compare the amount of longwave radiation emitted to space and the amount of longwave radiation emitted by the surface:

* &quot;Emissions to space:&quot; Based on its emissions of longwave radiation to space, Earth&#x27;s overall &quot;effective temperature&quot; is .
* &quot;Emissions from surface:&quot; Based on thermal emissions from the surface, Earth&#x27;s &quot;effective surface temperature&quot; is about , which is warmer than Earth&#x27;s overall effective temperature.

Earth&#x27;s surface temperature is often reported in terms of the average near-surface air temperature. This is about , a bit lower than the effective surface temperature. This value is warmer than Earth&#x27;s overall effective temperature.

=== Energy flux ===
Energy flux is the rate of energy flow per unit area. Energy flux is expressed in units of W/m2, which is the number of joules of energy that pass through a square meter each second. Most fluxes quoted in high-level discussions of climate are global values, which means they are the total flow of energy over the entire globe, divided by the surface area of the Earth, .

The fluxes of radiation arriving at and leaving the Earth are important because radiative transfer is the only process capable of exchanging energy between Earth and the rest of the universe.

=== Radiative balance ===

The temperature of a planet depends on the balance between incoming radiation and outgoing radiation. If incoming radiation exceeds outgoing radiation, a planet will warm. If outgoing radiation exceeds incoming radiation, a planet will cool. A planet will tend towards a state of radiative equilibrium, in which the power of outgoing radiation equals the power of absorbed incoming radiation.

Earth&#x27;s energy imbalance is the amount by which the power of incoming sunlight absorbed by Earth&#x27;s surface or atmosphere exceeds the power of outgoing longwave radiation emitted to space. Energy imbalance is the fundamental measurement that drives surface temperature. A UN presentation says &quot;The EEI is the most critical number defining the prospects for continued global warming and climate change.&quot; One study argues, &quot;The absolute value of EEI represents the most fundamental metric defining the status of global climate change.&quot;

Earth&#x27;s energy imbalance (EEI) was about 0.7 W/m as of around 2015, indicating that Earth as a whole is accumulating thermal energy and is in a process of becoming warmer.

Over 90% of the retained energy goes into warming the oceans, with much smaller amounts going into heating the land, atmosphere, and ice.
=== Day and night cycle ===
A simple picture assumes a steady state, but in the real world, the day/night (diurnal) cycle, as well as the seasonal cycle and weather disturbances, complicate matters. Solar heating applies only during daytime. At night the atmosphere cools somewhat, but not greatly because the thermal inertia of the climate system resists changes both day and night, as well as for longer periods. Diurnal temperature changes decrease with height in the atmosphere.

== Effect of lapse rate ==
=== Lapse rate ===

In the lower portion of the atmosphere, the troposphere, the air temperature decreases (or &quot;lapses&quot;) with increasing altitude. The rate at which temperature changes with altitude is called the &quot;lapse rate&quot;.

On Earth, the air temperature decreases by about 6.5 °C/km (3.6 °F per 1000 ft), on average, although this varies.

The temperature lapse is caused by convection. Air warmed by the surface rises. As it rises, air expands and cools. Simultaneously, other air descends, compresses, and warms. This process creates a vertical temperature gradient within the atmosphere.

This vertical temperature gradient is essential to the greenhouse effect. If the lapse rate was zero (so that the atmospheric temperature did not vary with altitude and was the same as the surface temperature) then there would be no greenhouse effect (i.e., its value would be zero).

=== Emission temperature and altitude ===
Greenhouse gases make the atmosphere near Earth&#x27;s surface mostly opaque to longwave radiation. The atmosphere only becomes transparent to longwave radiation at higher altitudes, where the air is less dense, there is less water vapor, and reduced pressure broadening of absorption lines limits the wavelengths that gas molecules can absorb.

For any given wavelength, the longwave radiation that reaches space is emitted by a particular &quot;radiating layer&quot; of the atmosphere. The intensity of the emitted radiation is determined by the weighted average air temperature within that layer. So, for any given wavelength of radiation emitted to space, there is an associated &quot;effective emission temperature&quot; (or brightness temperature).

A given wavelength of radiation may also be said to have an &quot;effective emission altitude&quot;, which is a weighted average of the altitudes within the radiating layer.

The effective emission temperature and altitude vary by wavelength (or frequency). This phenomenon may be seen by examining plots of radiation emitted to space.

=== Greenhouse gases and the lapse rate ===

Earth&#x27;s surface radiates longwave radiation with wavelengths in the range of 4–100 microns. Greenhouse gases that were largely transparent to incoming solar radiation are more absorbent for some wavelengths in this range.

The atmosphere near the Earth&#x27;s surface is largely opaque to longwave radiation and most heat loss from the surface is by evaporation and convection. However radiative energy losses become increasingly important higher in the atmosphere, largely because of the decreasing concentration of water vapor, an important greenhouse gas.

Rather than thinking of longwave radiation headed to space as coming from the surface itself, it is more realistic to think of this outgoing radiation as being emitted by a layer in the mid-troposphere, which is effectively coupled to the surface by a lapse rate. The difference in temperature between these two locations explains the difference between surface emissions and emissions to space, i.e., it explains the greenhouse effect.

== Infrared absorbing constituents in the atmosphere ==

=== Greenhouse gases ===
A greenhouse gas (GHG) is a gas which contributes to the trapping of heat by impeding the flow of longwave radiation out of a planet&#x27;s atmosphere. Greenhouse gases contribute most of the greenhouse effect in Earth&#x27;s energy budget.

==== Infrared active gases ====
Gases which can absorb and emit longwave radiation are said to be &quot;infrared active&quot; and act as greenhouse gases.

Most gases whose molecules have two different atoms (such as carbon monoxide, ), and all gases with three or more atoms (including and ), are infrared active and act as greenhouse gases. (Technically, this is because when these molecules vibrate, those vibrations modify the molecular dipole moment, or asymmetry in the distribution of electrical charge. See Infrared spectroscopy.)

Gases with only one atom (such as argon, Ar) or with two identical atoms (such as nitrogen, , and oxygen, ) are not infrared active. They are transparent to longwave radiation, and, for practical purposes, do not absorb or emit longwave radiation. (This is because their molecules are symmetrical and so do not have a dipole moment.) Such gases make up more than 99% of the dry atmosphere.

==== Absorption and emission ====
Greenhouse gases absorb and emit longwave radiation within specific ranges of wavelengths (organized as spectral lines or bands).

When greenhouse gases absorb radiation, they distribute the acquired energy to the surrounding air as thermal energy (i.e., kinetic energy of gas molecules). Energy is transferred from greenhouse gas molecules to other molecules via molecular collisions.

Contrary to what is sometimes said, greenhouse gases do not &quot;re-emit&quot; photons after they are absorbed. Because each molecule experiences billions of collisions per second, any energy a greenhouse gas molecule receives by absorbing a photon will be redistributed to other molecules before there is a chance for a new photon to be emitted.

In a separate process, greenhouse gases emit longwave radiation, at a rate determined by the air temperature. This thermal energy is either absorbed by other greenhouse gas molecules or leaves the atmosphere, cooling it.

==== Radiative effects ====
&quot;Effect on air:&quot; Air is warmed by latent heat (buoyant water vapor condensing into water droplets and releasing heat), thermals (warm air rising from below), and by sunlight being absorbed in the atmosphere. Air is cooled radiatively, by greenhouse gases and clouds emitting longwave thermal radiation. Within the troposphere, greenhouse gases typically have a net cooling effect on air, emitting more thermal radiation than they absorb. Warming and cooling of air are well balanced, on average, so that the atmosphere maintains a roughly stable average temperature.

&quot;Effect on surface cooling:&quot; Longwave radiation flows both upward and downward due to absorption and emission in the atmosphere. These canceling energy flows reduce radiative surface cooling (net upward radiative energy flow). Latent heat transport and thermals provide non-radiative surface cooling which partially compensates for this reduction, but there is still a net reduction in surface cooling, for a given surface temperature.

&quot;Effect on TOA energy balance:&quot; Greenhouse gases impact the top-of-atmosphere (TOA) energy budget by reducing the flux of longwave radiation emitted to space, for a given surface temperature. Thus, greenhouse gases alter the energy balance at TOA. This means that the surface temperature needs to be higher (than the planet&#x27;s &quot;effective temperature&quot;, i.e., the temperature associated with emissions to space), in order for the outgoing energy emitted to space to balance the incoming energy from sunlight. It is important to focus on the top-of-atmosphere (TOA) energy budget (rather than the surface energy budget) when reasoning about the warming effect of greenhouse gases.
=== Clouds and aerosols ===

Clouds and aerosols have both cooling effects, associated with reflecting sunlight back to space, and warming effects, associated with trapping thermal radiation.

On average, clouds have a strong net cooling effect. However, the mix of cooling and warming effects varies, depending on detailed characteristics of particular clouds (including their type, height, and optical properties). Thin cirrus clouds can have a net warming effect. Clouds can absorb and emit infrared radiation and thus affect the radiative properties of the atmosphere.

== Basic formulas ==

=== Effective temperature ===

A given flux of thermal radiation has an associated &quot;effective radiating temperature&quot; or &quot;effective temperature&quot;. Effective temperature is the temperature that a black body (a perfect absorber/emitter) would need to be to emit that much thermal radiation. Thus, the overall effective temperature of a planet is given by

:formula_1

where OLR is the average flux (power per unit area) of outgoing longwave radiation emitted to space and formula_2 is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. Similarly, the effective temperature of the surface is given by

:formula_3

where SLR is the average flux of longwave radiation emitted by the surface. (OLR is a conventional abbreviation. SLR is used here to denote the flux of surface-emitted longwave radiation, although there is no standard abbreviation for this.)

=== Metrics for the greenhouse effect ===
The IPCC reports the &quot;greenhouse effect&quot;, , as being 159 W m, where is the flux of longwave thermal radiation that leaves the surface minus the flux of outgoing longwave radiation that reaches space:

:formula_4

Alternatively, the greenhouse effect can be described using the &quot;normalized greenhouse effect&quot;, , defined as

:formula_5

The normalized greenhouse effect is &quot;the fraction of the amount of thermal radiation emitted by the surface that does not reach space&quot;.
Based on the IPCC numbers, = 0.40. In other words, 40 percent less thermal radiation reaches space than what leaves the surface.

Sometimes the greenhouse effect is quantified as a temperature difference. This temperature difference is closely related to the quantities above.

When the greenhouse effect is expressed as a temperature difference, formula_6, this refers to the effective temperature associated with thermal radiation emissions from the surface minus the effective temperature associated with emissions to space:

:formula_7
:formula_8

Informal discussions of the greenhouse effect often compare the actual surface temperature to the temperature that the planet would have if there were no greenhouse gases. However, in formal technical discussions, when the size of the greenhouse effect is quantified as a temperature, this is generally done using the above formula. The formula refers to the effective surface temperature rather than the actual surface temperature, and compares the surface with the top of the atmosphere, rather than comparing reality to a hypothetical situation.

The temperature difference, formula_6, indicates how much warmer a planet&#x27;s surface is than the planet&#x27;s overall effective temperature.

===Radiative balance===
Earth&#x27;s top-of-atmosphere (TOA) energy imbalance (EEI) is the amount by which the power of incoming radiation exceeds the power of outgoing radiation:

:formula_10

where ASR is the mean flux of absorbed solar radiation. ASR may be expanded as

:formula_11

where formula_12 is the albedo (reflectivity) of the planet and MSI is the mean solar irradiance incoming at the top of the atmosphere.

The radiative equilibrium temperature of a planet can be expressed as

:formula_13
A planet&#x27;s temperature will tend to shift towards a state of radiative equilibrium, in which the TOA energy imbalance is zero, i.e., formula_14. When the planet is in radiative equilibrium, the overall effective temperature of the planet is given by

:formula_15

Thus, the concept of radiative equilibrium is important because it indicates what effective temperature a planet will tend towards having.

If, in addition to knowing the effective temperature, formula_16, we know the value of the greenhouse effect, then we know the mean (average) surface temperature of the planet.

This is why the quantity known as the greenhouse effect is important: it is one of the few quantities that go into determining the planet&#x27;s mean surface temperature.

=== Greenhouse effect and temperature ===

Typically, a planet will be close to radiative equilibrium, with the rates of incoming and outgoing energy being well-balanced. Under such conditions, the planet&#x27;s equilibrium temperature is determined by the mean solar irradiance and the planetary albedo (how much sunlight is reflected back to space instead of being absorbed).

The greenhouse effect measures how much warmer the surface is than the overall effective temperature of the planet. So, the effective surface temperature, formula_17, is, using the definition of formula_6,

:formula_19

One could also express the relationship between formula_17 and formula_16 using or .

So, the principle that a larger greenhouse effect corresponds to a higher surface temperature, if everything else (i.e., the factors that determine formula_16) is held fixed, is true as a matter of definition.

Note that the greenhouse effect influences the temperature of the planet as a whole, in tandem with the planet&#x27;s tendency to move toward radiative equilibrium.

== Misconceptions ==
There are sometimes misunderstandings about how the greenhouse effect functions and raises temperatures.

The &quot;surface budget fallacy&quot; is a common error in thinking. It involves thinking that an increased concentration could only cause warming by increasing the downward thermal radiation to the surface, as a result of making the atmosphere a better emitter. If the atmosphere near the surface is already nearly opaque to thermal radiation, this would mean that increasing could not lead to higher temperatures. However, it is a mistake to focus on the surface energy budget rather than the top-of-atmosphere energy budget. Regardless of what happens at the surface, increasing the concentration of tends to reduce the thermal radiation reaching space (OLR), leading to a TOA energy imbalance that leads to warming. Earlier researchers like Callendar (1938) and Plass (1959) focused on the surface budget, but the work of Manabe in the 1960s clarified the importance of the top-of-atmosphere energy budget.

Among those who do not believe in the greenhouse effect, there is a fallacy that the greenhouse effect involves greenhouse gases sending heat from the cool atmosphere to the planet&#x27;s warm surface, in violation of the second law of thermodynamics. However, this idea reflects a misunderstanding. Radiation heat flow is the &quot;net energy flow&quot; after the flows of radiation in both directions have been taken into account. Radiation heat flow occurs in the direction from the surface to the atmosphere and space, as is to be expected given that the surface is warmer than the atmosphere and space. While greenhouse gases emit thermal radiation downward to the surface, this is part of the normal process of radiation heat transfer. The downward thermal radiation simply reduces the upward thermal radiation net energy flow (radiation heat flow), i.e., it reduces cooling.

== Simplified models ==
Simplified models are sometimes used to support understanding of how the greenhouse effect comes about and how this affects surface temperature.

=== Atmospheric layer models ===
The greenhouse effect can be seen to occur in a simplified model in which the air is treated as if it is single uniform layer exchanging radiation with the ground and space. Slightly more complex models add additional layers, or introduce convection.

=== Equivalent emission altitude ===
One simplification is to treat all outgoing longwave radiation as being emitted from an altitude where the air temperature equals the overall effective temperature for planetary emissions, formula_16. Some authors have referred to this altitude as the &quot;effective radiating level&quot; (ERL), and suggest that as the concentration increases, the ERL must rise to maintain the same mass of above that level.

This approach is less accurate than accounting for variation in radiation wavelength by emission altitude. However, it can be useful in supporting a simplified understanding of the greenhouse effect. For instance, it can be used to explain how the greenhouse effect increases as the concentration of greenhouse gases increase.

Earth&#x27;s overall equivalent emission altitude has been increasing with a trend of /decade, which is said to be consistent with a global mean surface warming of /decade over the period 1979–2011.

== Related effects on Earth ==
===Negative greenhouse effect===
Scientists have observed that, at times, there is a negative greenhouse effect over parts of Antarctica. In a location where there is a strong temperature inversion, so that the air is warmer than the surface, it is possible for the greenhouse effect to be reversed, so that the presence of greenhouse gases increases the rate of radiative cooling to space. In this case, the rate of thermal radiation emission to space is greater than the rate at which thermal radiation is emitted by the surface. Thus, the local value of the greenhouse effect is negative.

===Runaway greenhouse effect===
== Bodies other than Earth ==
In the solar system, apart from the Earth, at least two other planets and a moon also have a greenhouse effect.

===Venus===
The greenhouse effect on Venus is particularly large, and it brings the surface temperature to as high as . This is due to its very dense atmosphere which consists of about 97% carbon dioxide.

Although Venus is about 30% closer to the Sun, it absorbs (and is warmed by) &quot;less sunlight&quot; than Earth, because Venus reflects 77% of incident sunlight while Earth reflects around 30%. In the absence of a greenhouse effect, the surface of Venus would be expected to have a temperature of . Thus, contrary to what one might think, being nearer to the Sun is not a reason why Venus is warmer than Earth.

Due to its high pressure, the CO2 in the atmosphere of Venus exhibits &quot;continuum absorption&quot; (absorption over a broad range of wavelengths) and is not limited to absorption within the bands relevant to its absorption on Earth.

A runaway greenhouse effect involving carbon dioxide and water vapor has for many years been hypothesized to have occurred on Venus; this idea is still largely accepted. The planet Venus experienced a runaway greenhouse effect, resulting in an atmosphere which is 96% carbon dioxide, and a surface atmospheric pressure roughly the same as found underwater on Earth. Venus may have had water oceans, but they would have boiled off as the mean surface temperature rose to the current .

===Mars===
Mars has about 70 times as much carbon dioxide as Earth, but experiences only a small greenhouse effect, about . The greenhouse effect is small due to the lack of water vapor and the overall thinness of the atmosphere.

The same radiative transfer calculations that predict warming on Earth accurately explain the temperature on Mars, given its atmospheric composition.

===Titan===
Saturn&#x27;s moon Titan has both a greenhouse effect and an anti-greenhouse effect. The presence of nitrogen (N2), methane (CH4), and hydrogen (H2) in the atmosphere contribute to a greenhouse effect, increasing the surface temperature by over the expected temperature of the body without these gases.

While the gases N2 and H2 ordinarily do not absorb infrared radiation, these gases absorb thermal radiation on Titan due to pressure-induced collisions, the large mass and thickness of the atmosphere, and the long wavelengths of the thermal radiation from the cold surface.

The existence of a high-altitude haze, which absorbs wavelengths of solar radiation but is transparent to infrared, contribute to an anti-greenhouse effect of approximately .

The net result of these two effects is a warming of 21 K − 9 K = , so Titan&#x27;s surface temperature of is 12 K warmer than it would be if there were no atmosphere.

=== Effect of pressure ===
One cannot predict the relative sizes of the greenhouse effects on different bodies simply by comparing the amount of greenhouse gases in their atmospheres. This is because factors other than the quantity of these gases also play a role in determining the size of the greenhouse effect.

Overall atmospheric pressure affects how much thermal radiation each molecule of a greenhouse gas can absorb. High pressure leads to more absorption and low pressure leads to less.

This is due to &quot;pressure broadening&quot; of spectral lines. When the total atmospheric pressure is higher, collisions between molecules occur at a higher rate. Collisions broaden the width of absorption lines, allowing a greenhouse gas to absorb thermal radiation over a broader range of wavelengths.

Each molecule in the air near Earth&#x27;s surface experiences about 7 billion collisions per second. This rate is lower at higher altitudes, where the pressure and temperature are both lower. This means that greenhouse gases are able to absorb more wavelengths in the lower atmosphere than they can in the upper atmosphere.

On other planets, pressure broadening means that each molecule of a greenhouse gas is more effective at trapping thermal radiation if the total atmospheric pressure is high (as on Venus), and less effective at trapping thermal radiation if the atmospheric pressure is low (as on Mars).

<doc id="12396" wikidata="Q868169" url="?curid=12396" title="Group homomorphism">
<text>In mathematics, given two groups, (&quot;G&quot;,∗) and (&quot;H&quot;, ·), a group homomorphism from (&quot;G&quot;,∗) to (&quot;H&quot;, ·) is a function &quot;h&quot; : &quot;G&quot; → &quot;H&quot; such that for all &quot;u&quot; and &quot;v&quot; in &quot;G&quot; it holds that
:formula_1

where the group operation on the left side of the equation is that of &quot;G&quot; and on the right side that of &quot;H&quot;.

From this property, one can deduce that &quot;h&quot; maps the identity element &quot;eG&quot; of &quot;G&quot; to the identity element &quot;eH&quot; of &quot;H&quot;,
:formula_2

and it also maps inverses to inverses in the sense that 
:formula_3

Hence one can say that &quot;h&quot; &quot;is compatible with the group structure&quot;.

In areas of mathematics where one considers groups endowed with additional structure, a &quot;homomorphism&quot; sometimes means a map which respects not only the group structure (as above) but also the extra structure. For example, a homomorphism of topological groups is often required to be continuous.

== Properties ==

Let formula_4 be the identity element of the (&quot;H&quot;, ·) group and formula_5, then 

:formula_6

Now by multiplying for the inverse of formula_7 (or applying the cancellation rule) we obtain 
:formula_8

Similarly,

:formula_9

Therefore for the uniqueness of the inverse: formula_10.

== Types ==
;Monomorphism: A group homomorphism that is injective (or, one-to-one); i.e., preserves distinctness.
;Epimorphism: A group homomorphism that is surjective (or, onto); i.e., reaches every point in the codomain.
;Isomorphism: A group homomorphism that is bijective; i.e., injective and surjective. Its inverse is also a group homomorphism. In this case, the groups &quot;G&quot; and &quot;H&quot; are called &quot;isomorphic&quot;; they differ only in the notation of their elements (except of identity element) and are identical for all practical purposes. I.e. we re-label all elements except identity.
;Endomorphism: A group homomorphism, &quot;h&quot;: &quot;G&quot; → &quot;G&quot;; the domain and codomain are the same. Also called an endomorphism of &quot;G&quot;.
;Automorphism: A group endomorphism that is bijective, and hence an isomorphism. The set of all automorphisms of a group &quot;G&quot;, with functional composition as operation, itself forms a group, the &quot;automorphism group&quot; of &quot;G&quot;. It is denoted by Aut(&quot;G&quot;). As an example, the automorphism group of (Z, +) contains only two elements, the identity transformation and multiplication with −1; it is isomorphic to (Z/2Z, +).

== Image and kernel ==

We define the &quot;kernel of h&quot; to be the set of elements in &quot;G&quot; which are mapped to the identity in &quot;H&quot;
: formula_11

and the &quot;image of h&quot; to be
: formula_12

The kernel and image of a homomorphism can be interpreted as measuring how close it is to being an isomorphism. The first isomorphism theorem states that the image of a group homomorphism, &quot;h&quot;(&quot;G&quot;) is isomorphic to the quotient group &quot;G&quot;/ker &quot;h&quot;.

The kernel of h is a normal subgroup of &quot;G&quot;. Assume formula_13 and show formula_14 for arbitrary formula_15:
: formula_16
The image of h is a subgroup of &quot;H&quot;.

The homomorphism, &quot;h&quot;, is a &quot;group monomorphism&quot;; i.e., &quot;h&quot; is injective (one-to-one) if and only if }. Injection directly gives that there is a unique element in the kernel, and, conversely, a unique element in the kernel gives injection:
:formula_17

* Consider the cyclic group Z = (Z/3Z, +) = ({0, 1, 2}, +) and the group of integers (Z, +). The map &quot;h&quot; : Z → Z/3Z with &quot;h&quot;(&quot;u&quot;) = &quot;u&quot; mod 3 is a group homomorphism. It is surjective and its kernel consists of all integers which are divisible by 3.

* The exponential map yields a group homomorphism from the group of real numbers R with addition to the group of non-zero real numbers R* with multiplication. The kernel is {0} and the image consists of the positive real numbers.
* The exponential map also yields a group homomorphism from the group of complex numbers C with addition to the group of non-zero complex numbers C* with multiplication. This map is surjective and has the kernel {2π&quot;ki&quot; : &quot;k&quot; ∈ Z}, as can be seen from Euler&#x27;s formula. Fields like R and C that have homomorphisms from their additive group to their multiplicative group are thus called exponential fields.
* The function formula_18, defined by formula_19 is a homomorphism.
* Consider the two groups formula_20 and formula_21, represented respectively by formula_22 and formula_23, where formula_24 is the positive real numbers. Then, the function formula_25 defined by the logarithm function is a homomorphism.
== Category of groups ==
If and are group homomorphisms, then so is . This shows that the class of all groups, together with group homomorphisms as morphisms, forms a category (specifically the category of groups).

== Homomorphisms of abelian groups ==
If &quot;G&quot; and &quot;H&quot; are abelian (i.e., commutative) groups, then the set of all group homomorphisms from &quot;G&quot; to &quot;H&quot; is itself an abelian group: the sum of two homomorphisms is defined by
:(&quot;h&quot; + &quot;k&quot;)(&quot;u&quot;) = &quot;h&quot;(&quot;u&quot;) + &quot;k&quot;(&quot;u&quot;)    for all &quot;u&quot; in &quot;G&quot;.
The commutativity of &quot;H&quot; is needed to prove that is again a group homomorphism.

The addition of homomorphisms is compatible with the composition of homomorphisms in the following sense: if &quot;f&quot; is in , &quot;h&quot;, &quot;k&quot; are elements of , and &quot;g&quot; is in , then 
:    and    .
Since the composition is associative, this shows that the set End(&quot;G&quot;) of all endomorphisms of an abelian group forms a ring, the &quot;endomorphism ring&quot; of &quot;G&quot;. For example, the endomorphism ring of the abelian group consisting of the direct sum of &quot;m&quot; copies of Z/&quot;nZ is isomorphic to the ring of &quot;m&quot;-by-&quot;m&quot; matrices with entries in Z/&quot;nZ. The above compatibility also shows that the category of all abelian groups with group homomorphisms forms a preadditive category; the existence of direct sums and well-behaved kernels makes this category the prototypical example of an abelian category.

<text>In abstract algebra, a group isomorphism is a function between two groups that sets up a bijection between the elements of the groups in a way that respects the given group operations. If there exists an isomorphism between two groups, then the groups are called isomorphic. From the standpoint of group theory, isomorphic groups have the same properties and need not be distinguished.

== Definition and notation==

Given two groups formula_1 and formula_2 a &quot;group isomorphism&quot; from formula_1 to formula_4 is a bijective group homomorphism from formula_5 to formula_6 Spelled out, this means that a group isomorphism is a bijective function formula_7 such that for all formula_8 and formula_9 in formula_5 it holds that
formula_11

The two groups formula_1 and formula_4 are isomorphic if there exists an isomorphism from one to the other. This is written
formula_14

Often shorter and simpler notations can be used. When the relevant group operations are understood, they are omitted and one writes
formula_15

Sometimes one can even simply write formula_16 Whether such a notation is possible without confusion or ambiguity depends on context. For example, the equals sign is not very suitable when the groups are both subgroups of the same group. See also the examples.

Conversely, given a group formula_17 a set formula_18 and a bijection formula_19 we can make formula_20 a group formula_4 by defining
formula_22

If formula_23 and formula_24 then the bijection is an automorphism (&quot;q.v.&quot;).

Intuitively, group theorists view two isomorphic groups as follows: For every element formula_25 of a group formula_26 there exists an element formula_27 of formula_20 such that formula_27 &quot;behaves in the same way&quot; as formula_25 (operates with other elements of the group in the same way as formula_25). For instance, if formula_25 generates formula_26 then so does formula_34 This implies, in particular, that formula_5 and formula_20 are in bijective correspondence. Thus, the definition of an isomorphism is quite natural.

An isomorphism of groups may equivalently be defined as an invertible group homomorphism (the inverse function of a bijective group homomorphism is also a group homomorphism).

== Examples ==
In this section some notable examples of isomorphic groups are listed.
* The group of all real numbers under addition, formula_37, is isomorphic to the group of positive real numbers under multiplication formula_38:
*:formula_39 via the isomorphism formula_40.
* The group formula_41 of integers (with addition) is a subgroup of formula_42 and the factor group formula_43 is isomorphic to the group formula_44 of complex numbers of absolute value 1 (under multiplication):
*:formula_45
* The Klein four-group is isomorphic to the direct product of two copies of formula_46, and can therefore be written formula_47 Another notation is formula_48 because it is a dihedral group.
* Generalizing this, for all odd formula_49 formula_50 is isomorphic to the direct product of formula_51 and formula_52
* If formula_1 is an infinite cyclic group, then formula_1 is isomorphic to the integers (with the addition operation). From an algebraic point of view, this means that the set of all integers (with the addition operation) is the &quot;only&quot; infinite cyclic group.

Some groups can be proven to be isomorphic, relying on the axiom of choice, but the proof does not indicate how to construct a concrete isomorphism. Examples:
* The group formula_37 is isomorphic to the group formula_56 of all complex numbers under addition.
* The group formula_57 of non-zero complex numbers with multiplication as the operation is isomorphic to the group formula_44 mentioned above.

==Properties==

The kernel of an isomorphism from formula_1 to formula_4 is always {eG}, where eG is the identity of the group formula_1

If formula_1 and formula_4 are isomorphic, then formula_5 is abelian if and only if formula_20 is abelian.

If formula_66 is an isomorphism from formula_1 to formula_2 then for any formula_69 the order of formula_70 equals the order of formula_71

If formula_1 and formula_4 are isomorphic, then formula_1 is a locally finite group if and only if formula_4 is locally finite. 

The number of distinct groups (up to isomorphism) of order formula_76 is given by sequence A000001 in the OEIS. The first few numbers are 0, 1, 1, 1 and 2 meaning that 4 is the lowest order with more than one group.

== Cyclic groups ==
All cyclic groups of a given order are isomorphic to formula_77 where formula_78 denotes addition modulo formula_79

Let formula_5 be a cyclic group and formula_76 be the order of formula_82 Letting formula_83 be a generator of formula_5, formula_5 is then equal to formula_86 
We will show that
formula_87

Define 
formula_88 so that formula_89 
Clearly, formula_90 is bijective. Then
formula_91 
which proves that formula_92

== Consequences ==

From the definition, it follows that any isomorphism formula_7 will map the identity element of formula_5 to the identity element of formula_18 
formula_96
that it will map inverses to inverses,
formula_97
and more generally, formula_76th powers to formula_76th powers,
formula_100 
and that the inverse map formula_101 is also a group isomorphism.

The relation &quot;being isomorphic&quot; is an equivalence relation. If formula_66 is an isomorphism between two groups formula_5 and formula_18 then everything that is true about formula_5 that is only related to the group structure can be translated via formula_66 into a true ditto statement about formula_18 and vice versa.

== Automorphisms ==

An isomorphism from a group formula_1 to itself is called an automorphism of the group. Thus it is a bijection formula_109 such that
formula_110

The image under an automorphism of a conjugacy class is always a conjugacy class (the same or another).

The composition of two automorphisms is again an automorphism, and with this operation the set of all automorphisms of a group formula_26 denoted by formula_112 itself forms a group, the &quot;automorphism group&quot; of formula_82

For all abelian groups there is at least the automorphism that replaces the group elements by their inverses. However, in groups where all elements are equal to their inverses this is the trivial automorphism, e.g. in the Klein four-group. For that group all permutations of the three non-identity elements are automorphisms, so the automorphism group is isomorphic to formula_114 (which itself is isomorphic to formula_115).

In formula_116 for a prime number formula_117 one non-identity element can be replaced by any other, with corresponding changes in the other elements. The automorphism group is isomorphic to formula_118 For example, for formula_119 multiplying all elements of formula_120 by 3, modulo 7, is an automorphism of order 6 in the automorphism group, because formula_121 while lower powers do not give 1. Thus this automorphism generates formula_122 There is one more automorphism with this property: multiplying all elements of formula_120 by 5, modulo 7. Therefore, these two correspond to the elements 1 and 5 of formula_124 in that order or conversely.

The automorphism group of formula_125 is isomorphic to formula_126 because only each of the two elements 1 and 5 generate formula_124 so apart from the identity we can only interchange these.

The automorphism group of formula_128 has order 168, as can be found as follows. All 7 non-identity elements play the same role, so we can choose which plays the role of formula_129 Any of the remaining 6 can be chosen to play the role of (0,1,0). This determines which element corresponds to formula_130 For formula_131 we can choose from 4, which determines the rest. Thus we have formula_132 automorphisms. They correspond to those of the Fano plane, of which the 7 points correspond to the 7 elements. The lines connecting three points correspond to the group operation: formula_133 and formula_134 on one line means formula_135 formula_136 and formula_137 See also general linear group over finite fields.

For abelian groups, all non-trivial automorphisms are outer automorphisms.

Non-abelian groups have a non-trivial inner automorphism group, and possibly also outer automorphisms.

<text>A geographic information system (GIS) consists of integrated computer hardware and software that store, manage, analyze, edit, output, and visualize geographic data. Much of this often happens within a spatial database; however, this is not essential to meet the definition of a GIS. In a broader sense, one may consider such a system also to include human users and support staff, procedures and workflows, the body of knowledge of relevant concepts and methods, and institutional organizations.

The uncounted plural, &quot;geographic information systems&quot;, also abbreviated GIS, is the most common term for the industry and profession concerned with these systems. The academic discipline that studies these systems and their underlying geographic principles, may also be abbreviated as GIS, but the unambiguous GIScience is more common. GIScience is often considered a subdiscipline of geography within the branch of technical geography.

Geographic information systems are utilized in multiple technologies, processes, techniques and methods. They are attached to various operations and numerous applications, that relate to: engineering, planning, management, transport/logistics, insurance, telecommunications, and business, as well as the natural sciences such as forestry, ecology, and Earth science. For this reason, GIS and location intelligence applications are at the foundation of location-enabled services, which rely on geographic analysis and visualization.

GIS provides the ability to relate previously unrelated information, through the use of location as the &quot;key index variable&quot;. Locations and extents that are found in the Earth&#x27;s spacetime are able to be recorded through the date and time of occurrence, along with x, y, and z coordinates; representing, longitude (&quot;x&quot;), latitude (&quot;y&quot;), and elevation (&quot;z&quot;). All Earth-based, spatial–temporal, location and extent references should be relatable to one another, and ultimately, to a &quot;real&quot; physical location or extent. This key characteristic of GIS has begun to open new avenues of scientific inquiry and studies.

==History and development==
While digital GIS dates to the mid-1960s, when Roger Tomlinson first coined the phrase &quot;geographic information system&quot;, many of the geographic concepts and methods that GIS automates date back decades earlier.

One of the first known instances in which spatial analysis was used came from the field of epidemiology in the (1832). French cartographer and geographer Charles Picquet created a map outlining the forty-eight districts in Paris, using halftone color gradients, to provide a visual representation for the number of reported deaths due to cholera per every 1,000 inhabitants.

In 1854, John Snow, an epidemiologist and physician, was able to determine the source of a cholera outbreak in London through the use of spatial analysis. Snow achieved this through plotting the residence of each casualty on a map of the area, as well as the nearby water sources. Once these points were marked, he was able to identify the water source within the cluster that was responsible for the outbreak. This was one of the earliest successful uses of a geographic methodology in pinpointing the source of an outbreak in epidemiology. While the basic elements of topography and theme existed previously in cartography, Snow&#x27;s map was unique due to his use of cartographic methods, not only to depict, but also to analyze clusters of geographically dependent phenomena.

The early 20th century saw the development of photozincography, which allowed maps to be split into layers, for example one layer for vegetation and another for water. This was particularly used for printing contours – drawing these was a labour-intensive task but having them on a separate layer meant they could be worked on without the other layers to confuse the draughtsman. This work was initially drawn on glass plates, but later plastic film was introduced, with the advantages of being lighter, using less storage space and being less brittle, among others. When all the layers were finished, they were combined into one image using a large process camera. Once color printing came in, the layers idea was also used for creating separate printing plates for each color. While the use of layers much later became one of the typical features of a contemporary GIS, the photographic process just described is not considered a GIS in itself – as the maps were just images with no database to link them to.

Two additional developments are notable in the early days of GIS: Ian McHarg&#x27;s publication &quot;Design with Nature&quot; and its map overlay method and the introduction of a street network into the U.S. Census Bureau&#x27;s DIME (Dual Independent Map Encoding) system.

The first publication detailing the use of computers to facilitate cartography was written by Waldo Tobler in 1959. Further computer hardware development spurred by nuclear weapon research led to more widespread general-purpose computer &quot;mapping&quot; applications by the early 1960s.

In 1963, the world&#x27;s first true operational GIS was developed in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, by the federal Department of Forestry and Rural Development. Developed by Roger Tomlinson, it was called the Canada Geographic Information System (CGIS) and was used to store, analyze, and manipulate data collected for the Canada Land Inventory, an effort to determine the land capability for rural Canada by mapping information about soils, agriculture, recreation, wildlife, waterfowl, forestry and land use at a scale of 1:50,000. A rating classification factor was also added to permit analysis.

CGIS was an improvement over &quot;computer mapping&quot; applications as it provided capabilities for data storage, overlay, measurement, and digitizing/scanning. It supported a national coordinate system that spanned the continent, coded lines as arcs having a true embedded topology and it stored the attribute and locational information in separate files. As a result of this, Tomlinson has become known as the &quot;father of GIS&quot;, particularly for his use of overlays in promoting the spatial analysis of convergent geographic data. CGIS lasted into the 1990s and built a large digital land resource database in Canada. It was developed as a mainframe-based system in support of federal and provincial resource planning and management. Its strength was continent-wide analysis of complex datasets. The CGIS was never available commercially.

In 1964, Howard T. Fisher formed the Laboratory for Computer Graphics and Spatial Analysis at the Harvard Graduate School of Design (LCGSA 1965–1991), where a number of important theoretical concepts in spatial data handling were developed, and which by the 1970s had distributed seminal software code and systems, such as SYMAP, GRID, and ODYSSEY, to universities, research centers and corporations worldwide. These programs were the first examples of general-purpose GIS software that was not developed for a particular installation, and was very influential on future commercial software, such as Esri ARC/INFO, released in 1983.

By the late 1970s, two public domain GIS systems (MOSS and GRASS GIS) were in development, and by the early 1980s, M&amp;S Computing (later Intergraph) along with Bentley Systems Incorporated for the CAD platform, Environmental Systems Research Institute (ESRI), CARIS (Computer Aided Resource Information System), and ERDAS (Earth Resource Data Analysis System) emerged as commercial vendors of GIS software, successfully incorporating many of the CGIS features, combining the first-generation approach to separation of spatial and attribute information with a second-generation approach to organizing attribute data into database structures.

In 1986, Mapping Display and Analysis System (MIDAS), the first desktop GIS product, was released for the DOS operating system. This was renamed in 1990 to MapInfo for Windows when it was ported to the Microsoft Windows platform. This began the process of moving GIS from the research department into the business environment.

By the end of the 20th century, the rapid growth in various systems had been consolidated and standardized on relatively few platforms and users were beginning to explore viewing GIS data over the Internet, requiring data format and transfer standards. More recently, a growing number of free, open-source GIS packages run on a range of operating systems and can be customized to perform specific tasks. The major trend of the 21st Century has been the integration of GIS capabilities with other Information technology and Internet infrastructure, such as relational databases, cloud computing, software as a service (SAAS), and mobile computing.

==GIS software==
The distinction must be made between a singular &quot;geographic information system&quot;, which is a single installation of software and data for a particular use, along with associated hardware, staff, and institutions (e.g., the GIS for a particular city government); and &quot;GIS software&quot;, a general-purpose application program that is intended to be used in many individual geographic information systems in a variety of application domains. Starting in the late 1970s, many software packages have been created specifically for GIS applications. Esri&#x27;s ArcGIS, which includes ArcGIS Pro and the legacy software ArcMap, currently dominates the GIS market. Other examples of GIS include Autodesk and MapInfo Professional and open-source programs such as QGIS, GRASS GIS, MapGuide, and Hadoop-GIS. These and other desktop GIS applications include a full suite of capabilities for entering, managing, analyzing, and visualizing geographic data, and are designed to be used on their own.

Starting in the late 1990s with the emergence of the Internet, as computer network technology progressed, GIS infrastructure and data began to move to servers, providing another mechanism for providing GIS capabilities. This was facilitated by standalone software installed on a server, similar to other server software such as HTTP servers and relational database management systems, enabling clients to have access to GIS data and processing tools without having to install specialized desktop software. These networks are known as distributed GIS. This strategy has been extended through the Internet and development of cloud-based GIS platforms such as ArcGIS Online and GIS-specialized software as a service (SAAS). The use of the Internet to facilitate distributed GIS is known as Internet GIS.

An alternative approach is the integration of some or all of these capabilities into other software or information technology architectures. One example is a spatial extension to Object-relational database software, which defines a geometry datatype so that spatial data can be stored in relational tables, and extensions to SQL for spatial analysis operations such as overlay. Another example is the proliferation of geospatial libraries and application programming interfaces (e.g., GDAL, Leaflet, D3.js) that extend programming languages to enable the incorporation of GIS data and processing into custom software, including web mapping sites and location-based services in smartphones.

==Geospatial data management==
The core of any GIS is a database that contains representations of geographic phenomena, modeling their &quot;geometry&quot; (location and shape) and their &quot;properties&quot; or &quot;attributes&quot;. A GIS database may be stored in a variety of forms, such as a collection of separate data files or a single spatially-enabled relational database. Collecting and managing these data usually constitutes the bulk of the time and financial resources of a project, far more than other aspects such as analysis and mapping.

===Aspects of geographic data===
GIS uses spatio-temporal (space-time) location as the key index variable for all other information. Just as a relational database containing text or numbers can relate many different tables using common key index variables, GIS can relate otherwise unrelated information by using location as the key index variable. The key is the location and/or extent in space-time.

Any variable that can be located spatially, and increasingly also temporally, can be referenced using a GIS. Locations or extents in Earth space–time may be recorded as dates/times of occurrence, and x, y, and z coordinates representing, longitude, latitude, and elevation, respectively. These GIS coordinates may represent other quantified systems of temporo-spatial reference (for example, film frame number, stream gage station, highway mile-marker, surveyor benchmark, building address, street intersection, entrance gate, water depth sounding, POS or CAD drawing origin/units). Units applied to recorded temporal-spatial data can vary widely (even when using exactly the same data, see map projections), but all Earth-based spatial–temporal location and extent references should, ideally, be relatable to one another and ultimately to a &quot;real&quot; physical location or extent in space–time.

Related by accurate spatial information, an incredible variety of real-world and projected past or future data can be analyzed, interpreted and represented. This key characteristic of GIS has begun to open new avenues of scientific inquiry into behaviors and patterns of real-world information that previously had not been systematically correlated.

===Data modeling===

GIS data represents phenomena that exist in the real world, such as roads, land use, elevation, trees, waterways, and states. The most common types of phenomena that are represented in data can be divided into two conceptualizations: discrete objects (e.g., a house, a road) and continuous fields (e.g., rainfall amount or population density). Other types of geographic phenomena, such as events (e.g., location of World War II battles), processes (e.g., extent of suburbanization), and masses (e.g., types of soil in an area) are represented less commonly or indirectly, or are modeled in analysis procedures rather than data.

Traditionally, there are two broad methods used to store data in a GIS for both kinds of abstractions mapping references: raster images and vector. Points, lines, and polygons represent vector data of mapped location attribute references.

A new hybrid method of storing data is that of identifying point clouds, which combine three-dimensional points with RGB information at each point, returning a 3D color image. GIS thematic maps then are becoming more and more realistically visually descriptive of what they set out to show or determine.

===Data acquisition===

GIS data acquisition includes several methods for gathering spatial data into a GIS database, which can be grouped into three categories: &quot;primary data capture&quot;, the direct measurement phenomena in the field (e.g., remote sensing, the global positioning system); &quot;secondary data capture&quot;, the extraction of information from existing sources that are not in a GIS form, such as paper maps, through digitization; and &quot;data transfer&quot;, the copying of existing GIS data from external sources such as government agencies and private companies. All of these methods can consume significant time, finances, and other resources.

====Primary data capture====
Survey data can be directly entered into a GIS from digital data collection systems on survey instruments using a technique called coordinate geometry (COGO). Positions from a global navigation satellite system (GNSS) like the Global Positioning System can also be collected and then imported into a GIS. A current trend in data collection gives users the ability to utilize field computers with the ability to edit live data using wireless connections or disconnected editing sessions. The current trend is to utilize applications available on smartphones and PDAs in the form of mobile GIS. This has been enhanced by the availability of low-cost mapping-grade GPS units with decimeter accuracy in real time. This eliminates the need to post process, import, and update the data in the office after fieldwork has been collected. This includes the ability to incorporate positions collected using a laser rangefinder. New technologies also allow users to create maps as well as analysis directly in the field, making projects more efficient and mapping more accurate.

Remotely sensed data also plays an important role in data collection and consist of sensors attached to a platform. Sensors include cameras, digital scanners and lidar, while platforms usually consist of aircraft and satellites. In England in the mid-1990s, hybrid kite/balloons called helikites first pioneered the use of compact airborne digital cameras as airborne geo-information systems. Aircraft measurement software, accurate to 0.4 mm, was used to link the photographs and measure the ground. Helikites are inexpensive and gather more accurate data than aircraft. Helikites can be used over roads, railways and towns where unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are banned.

Recently, aerial data collection has become more accessible with miniature UAVs and drones. For example, the Aeryon Scout was used to map a 50-acre area with a ground sample distance of in only 12 minutes.

The majority of digital data currently comes from photo interpretation of aerial photographs. Soft-copy workstations are used to digitize features directly from stereo pairs of digital photographs. These systems allow data to be captured in two and three dimensions, with elevations measured directly from a stereo pair using principles of photogrammetry. Analog aerial photos must be scanned before being entered into a soft-copy system, for high-quality digital cameras this step is skipped.

Satellite remote sensing provides another important source of spatial data. Here satellites use different sensor packages to passively measure the reflectance from parts of the electromagnetic spectrum or radio waves that were sent out from an active sensor such as radar. Remote sensing collects raster data that can be further processed using different bands to identify objects and classes of interest, such as land cover.

====Secondary data capture====

The most common method of data creation is digitization, where a hard copy map or survey plan is transferred into a digital medium through the use of a CAD program, and geo-referencing capabilities. With the wide availability of ortho-rectified imagery (from satellites, aircraft, Helikites and UAVs), heads-up digitizing is becoming the main avenue through which geographic data is extracted. Heads-up digitizing involves the tracing of geographic data directly on top of the aerial imagery instead of by the traditional method of tracing the geographic form on a separate digitizing tablet (heads-down digitizing). Heads-down digitizing, or manual digitizing, uses a special magnetic pen, or stylus, that feeds information into a computer to create an identical, digital map. Some tablets use a mouse-like tool, called a puck, instead of a stylus. The puck has a small window with cross-hairs which allows for greater precision and pinpointing map features. Though heads-up digitizing is more commonly used, heads-down digitizing is still useful for digitizing maps of poor quality.

Existing data printed on paper or PET film maps can be digitized or scanned to produce digital data. A digitizer produces vector data as an operator traces points, lines, and polygon boundaries from a map. Scanning a map results in raster data that could be further processed to produce vector data.

When data is captured, the user should consider if the data should be captured with either a relative accuracy or absolute accuracy, since this could not only influence how information will be interpreted but also the cost of data capture.

After entering data into a GIS, the data usually requires editing, to remove errors, or further processing. For vector data it must be made &quot;topologically correct&quot; before it can be used for some advanced analysis. For example, in a road network, lines must connect with nodes at an intersection. Errors such as undershoots and overshoots must also be removed. For scanned maps, blemishes on the source map may need to be removed from the resulting raster. For example, a fleck of dirt might connect two lines that should not be connected.

===Projections, coordinate systems, and registration===

The earth can be represented by various models, each of which may provide a different set of coordinates (e.g., latitude, longitude, elevation) for any given point on the Earth&#x27;s surface. The simplest model is to assume the earth is a perfect sphere. As more measurements of the earth have accumulated, the models of the earth have become more sophisticated and more accurate. In fact, there are models called datums that apply to different areas of the earth to provide increased accuracy, like North American Datum of 1983 for U.S. measurements, and the World Geodetic System for worldwide measurements.

The latitude and longitude on a map made against a local datum may not be the same as one obtained from a GPS receiver. Converting coordinates from one datum to another requires a datum transformation such as a Helmert transformation, although in certain situations a simple translation may be sufficient.

In popular GIS software, data projected in latitude/longitude is often represented as a Geographic coordinate system. For example, data in latitude/longitude if the datum is the &#x27;North American Datum of 1983&#x27; is denoted by &#x27;GCS North American 1983&#x27;.

===Data quality===

While no digital model can be a perfect representation of the real world, it is important that GIS data be of a high quality. In keeping with the principle of homomorphism, the data must be close enough to reality so that the results of GIS procedures correctly correspond to the results of real world processes. This means that there is no single standard for data quality, because the necessary degree of quality depends on the scale and purpose of the tasks for which it is to be used. Several elements of data quality are important to GIS data:

;Accuracy
:The degree of similarity between a represented measurement and the actual value; conversely, &quot;error&quot; is the amount of difference between them. In GIS data, there is concern for accuracy in representations of location (&quot;positional accuracy&quot;), property (&quot;attribute accuracy&quot;), and time. For example, the US 2020 Census says that the population of Houston on April 1, 2020 was 2,304,580; if it was actually 2,310,674, this would be an error and thus a lack of attribute accuracy.
;Precision
:The degree of refinement in a represented value. In a quantitative property, this is the number of significant digits in the measured value. An imprecise value is vague or ambiguous, including a range of possible values. For example, if one were to say that the population of Houston on April 1, 2020 was &quot;about 2.3 million,&quot; this statement would be imprecise, but likely accurate because the correct value (and many incorrect values) are included. As with accuracy, representations of location, property, and time can all be more or less precise. &quot;Resolution&quot; is a commonly used expression of positional precision, especially in raster data sets. Scale is closely related to precision in maps, as it dictates a desirable level of spatial precision, but is problematic in GIS, where a data set can be shown at a variety of display scales (including scales that would not be appropriate for the quality of the data).
;Uncertainty
:A general acknowledgement of the presence of error and imprecision in geographic data. That is, it is a degree of general doubt, given that it is difficult to know exactly how much error is present in a data set, although some form of estimate may be attempted (a confidence interval being such an estimate of uncertainty). This is sometimes used as a collective term for all or most aspects of data quality.
;Vagueness or fuzziness
:The degree to which an aspect (location, property, or time) of a phenomenon is inherently imprecise, rather than the imprecision being in a measured value. For example, the spatial extent of the Houston metropolitan area is vague, as there are places on the outskirts of the city that are less connected to the central city (measured by activities such as commuting) than places that are closer. Mathematical tools such as fuzzy set theory are commonly used to manage vagueness in geographic data.
;Completeness
:The degree to which a data set represents all of the actual features that it purports to include. For example, if a layer of &quot;roads in Houston&quot; is missing some actual streets, it is incomplete.
;Currency
:The most recent point in time at which a data set claims to be an accurate representation of reality. This is a concern for the majority of GIS applications, which attempt to represent the world &quot;at present,&quot; in which case older data is of lower quality.
;Consistency
:The degree to which the representations of the many phenomena in a data set correctly correspond with each other. Consistency in topological relationships between spatial objects is an especially important aspect of consistency. For example, if all of the lines in a street network were accidentally moved 10 meters to the East, they would be inaccurate but still consistent, because they would still properly connect at each intersection, and network analysis tools such as shortest path would still give correct results.
;Propagation of uncertainty
:The degree to which the quality of the results of Spatial analysis methods and other processing tools derives from the quality of input data. For example, interpolation is a common operation used in many ways in GIS; because it generates estimates of values between known measurements, the results will always be more precise, but less certain (as each estimate has an unknown amount of error).

The quality of a dataset is very dependent upon its sources, and the methods used to create it. Land surveyors have been able to provide a high level of positional accuracy utilizing high-end GPS equipment, but GPS locations on the average smartphone are much less accurate. Common datasets such as digital terrain and aerial imagery are available in a wide variety of levels of quality, especially spatial precision. Paper maps, which have been digitized for many years as a data source, can also be of widely varying quality.

A quantitative analysis of maps brings accuracy issues into focus. The electronic and other equipment used to make measurements for GIS is far more precise than the machines of conventional map analysis. All geographical data are inherently inaccurate, and these inaccuracies will propagate through GIS operations in ways that are difficult to predict.

===Raster-to-vector translation===
Data restructuring can be performed by a GIS to convert data into different formats. For example, a GIS may be used to convert a satellite image map to a vector structure by generating lines around all cells with the same classification, while determining the cell spatial relationships, such as adjacency or inclusion.

More advanced data processing can occur with image processing, a technique developed in the late 1960s by NASA and the private sector to provide contrast enhancement, false color rendering and a variety of other techniques including use of two dimensional Fourier transforms. Since digital data is collected and stored in various ways, the two data sources may not be entirely compatible. So a GIS must be able to convert geographic data from one structure to another. In so doing, the implicit assumptions behind different ontologies and classifications require analysis. Object ontologies have gained increasing prominence as a consequence of object-oriented programming and sustained work by Barry Smith and co-workers.

===Spatial ETL===
Spatial ETL tools provide the data processing functionality of traditional extract, transform, load (ETL) software, but with a primary focus on the ability to manage spatial data. They provide GIS users with the ability to translate data between different standards and proprietary formats, whilst geometrically transforming the data en route. These tools can come in the form of add-ins to existing wider-purpose software such as spreadsheets.

==Spatial analysis==
GIS spatial analysis is a rapidly changing field, and GIS packages are increasingly including analytical tools as standard built-in facilities, as optional toolsets, as add-ins or &#x27;analysts&#x27;. In many instances these are provided by the original software suppliers (commercial vendors or collaborative non commercial development teams), while in other cases facilities have been developed and are provided by third parties. Furthermore, many products offer software development kits (SDKs), programming languages and language support, scripting facilities and/or special interfaces for developing one&#x27;s own analytical tools or variants. The increased availability has created a new dimension to business intelligence termed &quot;spatial intelligence&quot; which, when openly delivered via intranet, democratizes access to geographic and social network data. Geospatial intelligence, based on GIS spatial analysis, has also become a key element for security. GIS as a whole can be described as conversion to a vectorial representation or to any other digitisation process.

Geoprocessing is a GIS operation used to manipulate spatial data. A typical geoprocessing operation takes an input dataset, performs an operation on that dataset, and returns the result of the operation as an output dataset. Common geoprocessing operations include geographic feature overlay, feature selection and analysis, topology processing, raster processing, and data conversion. Geoprocessing allows for definition, management, and analysis of information used to form decisions.

===Terrain analysis===

Many geographic tasks involve the terrain, the shape of the surface of the earth, such as hydrology, earthworks, and biogeography. Thus, terrain data is often a core dataset in a GIS, usually in the form of a raster Digital elevation model (DEM) or a Triangulated irregular network (TIN). A variety of tools are available in most GIS software for analyzing terrain, often by creating derivative datasets that represent a specific aspect of the surface. Some of the most common include:
* Slope or grade is the steepness or gradient of a unit of terrain, usually measured as an angle in degrees or as a percentage. 
* Aspect can be defined as the direction in which a unit of terrain faces. Aspect is usually expressed in degrees from north. 
* Cut and fill is a computation of the difference between the surface before and after an excavation project to estimate costs.
* Hydrological modeling can provide a spatial element that other hydrological models lack, with the analysis of variables such as slope, aspect and watershed or catchment area. Terrain analysis is fundamental to hydrology, since water always flows down a slope. As basic terrain analysis of a digital elevation model (DEM) involves calculation of slope and aspect, DEMs are very useful for hydrological analysis. Slope and aspect can then be used to determine direction of surface runoff, and hence flow accumulation for the formation of streams, rivers and lakes. Areas of divergent flow can also give a clear indication of the boundaries of a catchment. Once a flow direction and accumulation matrix has been created, queries can be performed that show contributing or dispersal areas at a certain point. More detail can be added to the model, such as terrain roughness, vegetation types and soil types, which can influence infiltration and evapotranspiration rates, and hence influencing surface flow. One of the main uses of hydrological modeling is in environmental contamination research. Other applications of hydrological modeling include groundwater and surface water mapping, as well as flood risk maps.
* Viewshed analysis predicts the impact that terrain has on the visibility between locations, which is especially important for wireless communications.
* Shaded relief is a depiction of the surface as if it were a three dimensional model lit from a given direction, which is very commonly used in maps.

Most of these are generated using algorithms that are discrete simplifications of vector calculus. Slope, aspect, and surface curvature in terrain analysis are all derived from neighborhood operations using elevation values of a cell&#x27;s adjacent neighbours. Each of these is strongly affected by the level of detail in the terrain data, such as the resolution of a DEM, which should be chosen carefully.

===Proximity analysis===

Distance is a key part of solving many geographic tasks, usually due to the friction of distance. Thus, a wide variety of analysis tools have analyze distance in some form, such as buffers, Voronoi or Thiessen polygons, Cost distance analysis, and network analysis.

===Data analysis===
It is difficult to relate wetlands maps to rainfall amounts recorded at different points such as airports, television stations, and schools. A GIS, however, can be used to depict two- and three-dimensional characteristics of the Earth&#x27;s surface, subsurface, and atmosphere from information points. For example, a GIS can quickly generate a map with isopleth or contour lines that indicate differing amounts of rainfall. Such a map can be thought of as a rainfall contour map. Many sophisticated methods can estimate the characteristics of surfaces from a limited number of point measurements. A two-dimensional contour map created from the surface modeling of rainfall point measurements may be overlaid and analyzed with any other map in a GIS covering the same area. This GIS derived map can then provide additional information - such as the viability of water power potential as a renewable energy source. Similarly, GIS can be used to compare other renewable energy resources to find the best geographic potential for a region.

Additionally, from a series of three-dimensional points, or digital elevation model, isopleth lines representing elevation contours can be generated, along with slope analysis, shaded relief, and other elevation products. Watersheds can be easily defined for any given reach, by computing all of the areas contiguous and uphill from any given point of interest. Similarly, an expected thalweg of where surface water would want to travel in intermittent and permanent streams can be computed from elevation data in the GIS.

===Topological modeling===
A GIS can recognize and analyze the spatial relationships that exist within digitally stored spatial data. These topological relationships allow complex spatial modelling and analysis to be performed. Topological relationships between geometric entities traditionally include adjacency (what adjoins what), containment (what encloses what), and proximity (how close something is to something else).

===Geometric networks===
Geometric networks are linear networks of objects that can be used to represent interconnected features, and to perform special spatial analysis on them. A geometric network is composed of edges, which are connected at junction points, similar to graphs in mathematics and computer science. Just like graphs, networks can have weight and flow assigned to its edges, which can be used to represent various interconnected features more accurately. Geometric networks are often used to model road networks and public utility networks, such as electric, gas, and water networks. Network modeling is also commonly employed in transportation planning, hydrology modeling, and infrastructure modeling.

===Cartographic modeling===

Dana Tomlin coined the term &quot;cartographic modeling&quot; in his PhD dissertation (1983); he later used it in the title of his book, &quot;Geographic Information Systems and Cartographic Modeling&quot; (1990). Cartographic modeling refers to a process where several thematic layers of the same area are produced, processed, and analyzed. Tomlin used raster layers, but the overlay method (see below) can be used more generally. Operations on map layers can be combined into algorithms, and eventually into simulation or optimization models.

===Map overlay===

The combination of several spatial datasets (points, lines, or polygons) creates a new output vector dataset, visually similar to stacking several maps of the same region. These overlays are similar to mathematical Venn diagram overlays. A union overlay combines the geographic features and attribute tables of both inputs into a single new output. An intersect overlay defines the area where both inputs overlap and retains a set of attribute fields for each. A symmetric difference overlay defines an output area that includes the total area of both inputs except for the overlapping area.

Data extraction is a GIS process similar to vector overlay, though it can be used in either vector or raster data analysis. Rather than combining the properties and features of both datasets, data extraction involves using a &quot;clip&quot; or &quot;mask&quot; to extract the features of one data set that fall within the spatial extent of another dataset.

In raster data analysis, the overlay of datasets is accomplished through a process known as &quot;local operation on multiple rasters&quot; or &quot;map algebra&quot;, through a function that combines the values of each raster&#x27;s matrix. This function may weigh some inputs more than others through use of an &quot;index model&quot; that reflects the influence of various factors upon a geographic phenomenon.

===Geostatistics===
Geostatistics is a branch of statistics that deals with field data, spatial data with a continuous index. It provides methods to model spatial correlation, and predict values at arbitrary locations (interpolation).

When phenomena are measured, the observation methods dictate the accuracy of any subsequent analysis. Due to the nature of the data (e.g. traffic patterns in an urban environment; weather patterns over the Pacific Ocean), a constant or dynamic degree of precision is always lost in the measurement. This loss of precision is determined from the scale and distribution of the data collection.

To determine the statistical relevance of the analysis, an average is determined so that points (gradients) outside of any immediate measurement can be included to determine their predicted behavior. This is due to the limitations of the applied statistic and data collection methods, and interpolation is required to predict the behavior of particles, points, and locations that are not directly measurable.

Interpolation is the process by which a surface is created, usually a raster dataset, through the input of data collected at a number of sample points. There are several forms of interpolation, each which treats the data differently, depending on the properties of the data set. In comparing interpolation methods, the first consideration should be whether or not the source data will change (exact or approximate). Next is whether the method is subjective, a human interpretation, or objective. Then there is the nature of transitions between points: are they abrupt or gradual. Finally, there is whether a method is global (it uses the entire data set to form the model), or local where an algorithm is repeated for a small section of terrain.

Interpolation is a justified measurement because of a spatial autocorrelation principle that recognizes that data collected at any position will have a great similarity to, or influence of those locations within its immediate vicinity.

Digital elevation models, triangulated irregular networks, edge-finding algorithms, Thiessen polygons, Fourier analysis, (weighted) moving averages, inverse distance weighting, kriging, spline, and trend surface analysis are all mathematical methods to produce interpolative data.

===Address geocoding===

Geocoding is interpolating spatial locations (X,Y coordinates) from street addresses or any other spatially referenced data such as ZIP Codes, parcel lots and address locations. A reference theme is required to geocode individual addresses, such as a road centerline file with address ranges. The individual address locations have historically been interpolated, or estimated, by examining address ranges along a road segment. These are usually provided in the form of a table or database. The software will then place a dot approximately where that address belongs along the segment of centerline. For example, an address point of 500 will be at the midpoint of a line segment that starts with address 1 and ends with address 1,000. Geocoding can also be applied against actual parcel data, typically from municipal tax maps. In this case, the result of the geocoding will be an actually positioned space as opposed to an interpolated point. This approach is being increasingly used to provide more precise location information.

===Reverse geocoding===

Reverse geocoding is the process of returning an estimated street address number as it relates to a given coordinate. For example, a user can click on a road centerline theme (thus providing a coordinate) and have information returned that reflects the estimated house number. This house number is interpolated from a range assigned to that road segment. If the user clicks at the midpoint of a segment that starts with address 1 and ends with 100, the returned value will be somewhere near 50. Note that reverse geocoding does not return actual addresses, only estimates of what should be there based on the predetermined range.

===Multi-criteria decision analysis===

Coupled with GIS, multi-criteria decision analysis methods support decision-makers in analysing a set of alternative spatial solutions, such as the most likely ecological habitat for restoration, against multiple criteria, such as vegetation cover or roads. MCDA uses decision rules to aggregate the criteria, which allows the alternative solutions to be ranked or prioritised. GIS MCDA may reduce costs and time involved in identifying potential restoration sites.

===GIS data mining===
GIS or spatial data mining is the application of data mining methods to spatial data. Data mining, which is the partially automated search for hidden patterns in large databases, offers great potential benefits for applied GIS-based decision making. Typical applications include environmental monitoring. A characteristic of such applications is that spatial correlation between data measurements require the use of specialized algorithms for more efficient data analysis.

==Data output and cartography==

Cartography is the design and production of maps, or visual representations of spatial data. The vast majority of modern cartography is done with the help of computers, usually using GIS but production of quality cartography is also achieved by importing layers into a design program to refine it. Most GIS software gives the user substantial control over the appearance of the data.

Cartographic work serves two major functions:

First, it produces graphics on the screen or on paper that convey the results of analysis to the people who make decisions about resources. Wall maps and other graphics can be generated, allowing the viewer to visualize and thereby understand the results of analyses or simulations of potential events. Web Map Servers facilitate distribution of generated maps through web browsers using various implementations of web-based application programming interfaces (AJAX, Java, Flash, etc.).

Second, other database information can be generated for further analysis or use. An example would be a list of all addresses within one mile (1.6 km) of a toxic spill.

An archeochrome is a new way of displaying spatial data. It is a thematic on a 3D map that is applied to a specific building or a part of a building. It is suited to the visual display of heat-loss data.

===Terrain depiction===
Traditional maps are abstractions of the real world, a sampling of important elements portrayed on a sheet of paper with symbols to represent physical objects. People who use maps must interpret these symbols. Topographic maps show the shape of land surface with contour lines or with shaded relief.

Today, graphic display techniques such as shading based on altitude in a GIS can make relationships among map elements visible, heightening one&#x27;s ability to extract and analyze information. For example, two types of data were combined in a GIS to produce a perspective view of a portion of San Mateo County, California.
*The digital elevation model, consisting of surface elevations recorded on a 30-meter horizontal grid, shows high elevations as white and low elevation as black.
*The accompanying Landsat Thematic Mapper image shows a false-color infrared image looking down at the same area in 30-meter pixels, or picture elements, for the same coordinate points, pixel by pixel, as the elevation information.

A GIS was used to register and combine the two images to render the three-dimensional perspective view looking down the San Andreas Fault, using the Thematic Mapper image pixels, but shaded using the elevation of the landforms. The GIS display depends on the viewing point of the observer and time of day of the display, to properly render the shadows created by the sun&#x27;s rays at that latitude, longitude, and time of day.

===Web mapping===
In recent years there has been a proliferation of free-to-use and easily accessible mapping software such as the proprietary web applications Google Maps and Bing Maps, as well as the free and open-source alternative OpenStreetMap. These services give the public access to huge amounts of geographic data, perceived by many users to be as trustworthy and usable as professional information. For example, during the COVID-19 pandemic, web maps hosted on dashboards were used to rapidly disseminate case data to the general public.

Some of them, like Google Maps and OpenLayers, expose an application programming interface (API) that enable users to create custom applications. These toolkits commonly offer street maps, aerial/satellite imagery, geocoding, searches, and routing functionality. Web mapping has also uncovered the potential of crowdsourcing geodata in projects like OpenStreetMap, which is a collaborative project to create a free editable map of the world. These mashup projects have been proven to provide a high level of value and benefit to end users outside that possible through traditional geographic information.

Web mapping is not without its drawbacks. Web mapping allows for the creation and distribution of maps by people without proper cartographic training. This has led to maps that ignore cartographic conventions and are potentially misleading, with one study finding that more than half of United States state government COVID-19 dashboards did not follow these conventions.

==Uses==
Since its origin in the 1960s, GIS has been used in an ever-increasing range of applications, corroborating the widespread importance of location and aided by the continuing reduction in the barriers to adopting geospatial technology. The perhaps hundreds of different uses of GIS can be classified in several ways:
* &quot;Goal&quot;: the purpose of an application can be broadly classified as either &quot;scientific research&quot; or &quot;resource management&quot;. The purpose of research, defined as broadly as possible, is to discover new knowledge; this may be performed by someone who considers themself a scientist, but may also be done by anyone who is trying to learn why the world appears to work the way it does. A study as practical as deciphering why a business location has failed would be research in this sense. Management (sometimes called operational applications), also defined as broadly as possible, is the application of knowledge to make practical decisions on how to employ the resources one has control over to achieve one&#x27;s goals. These resources could be time, capital, labor, equipment, land, mineral deposits, wildlife, and so on.
** &quot;Decision level&quot;: Management applications have been further classified as &quot;strategic&quot;, &quot;tactical&quot;, &quot;operational&quot;, a common classification in business management. Strategic tasks are long-term, visionary decisions about what goals one should have, such as whether a business should expand or not. Tactical tasks are medium-term decisions about how to achieve strategic goals, such as a national forest creating a grazing management plan. Operational decisions are concerned with the day-to-day tasks, such as a person finding the shortest route to a pizza restaurant.
* &quot;Topic&quot;: the domains in which GIS is applied largely fall into those concerned with the human world (e.g., economics, politics, transportation, education, landscape architecture, archaeology, urban planning, real estate, public health, crime mapping, national defense), and those concerned with the natural world (e.g., geology, biology, oceanography, climate). That said, one of the powerful capabilities of GIS and the spatial perspective of geography is their integrative ability to compare disparate topics, and many applications are concerned with multiple domains. Examples of integrated human-natural application domains include deep mapping, Natural hazard mitigation, wildlife management, sustainable development, natural resources, and climate change response.
* &quot;Institution&quot;: GIS has been implemented in a variety of different kinds of institutions: &quot;government&quot; (at all levels from municipal to international), &quot;business&quot; (of all types and sizes), &quot;non-profit organizations&quot; (even churches), as well as &quot;personal&quot; uses. The latter has become increasingly prominent with the rise of location-enabled smartphones.
* &quot;Lifespan&quot;: GIS implementations may be focused on a &quot;project&quot; or an &quot;enterprise&quot;. A Project GIS is focused on accomplishing a single task: data is gathered, analysis is performed, and results are produced separately from any other projects the person may perform, and the implementation is essentially transitory. An Enterprise GIS is intended to be a permanent institution, including a database that is carefully designed to be useful for a variety of projects over many years, and is likely used by many individuals across an enterprise, with some employed full-time just to maintain it.
* &quot;Integration&quot;: Traditionally, most GIS applications were &quot;standalone&quot;, using specialized GIS software, specialized hardware, specialized data, and specialized professionals. Although these remain common to the present day, &quot;integrated&quot; applications have greatly increased, as geospatial technology was merged into broader enterprise applications, sharing IT infrastructure, databases, and software, often using enterprise integration platforms such as SAP.

The implementation of a GIS is often driven by jurisdictional (such as a city), purpose, or application requirements. Generally, a GIS implementation may be custom-designed for an organization. Hence, a GIS deployment developed for an application, jurisdiction, enterprise, or purpose may not be necessarily interoperable or compatible with a GIS that has been developed for some other application, jurisdiction, enterprise, or purpose.

GIS is also diverging into location-based services, which allows GPS-enabled mobile devices to display their location in relation to fixed objects (nearest restaurant, gas station, fire hydrant) or mobile objects (friends, children, police car), or to relay their position back to a central server for display or other processing.

GIS is also used in digital marketing and SEO for audience segmentation based on location.

===Topics===
====Aquatic science====
====Archaeology====
====Disaster response====
 Geospatial disaster response uses geospatial data and tools to help emergency responders, land managers, and scientists respond to disasters. Geospatial data can help save lives, reduce damage, and improve communication. Geospatial data can be used by federal authorities like FEMA to create maps that show the extent of a disaster, the location of people in need, and the location of debris, create models that estimate the number of people at risk and the amount of damage, improve communication between emergency responders, land managers, and scientists, as well as help determine where to allocate resources, such as emergency medical resources or search and rescue teams and plan evacuation routes and identify which areas are most at risk.

In the United States, FEMA&#x27;s Response Geospatial Office is responsible for the agency&#x27;s capture, analysis and development of GIS products to enhance situational awareness and enable expeditions and effective decision making. The RGO&#x27;s mission is to support decision makers in understanding the size, scope, and extent of disaster impacts so they can deliver resources to the communities most in need.

===Open Geospatial Consortium standards===

The Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) is an international industry consortium of 384 companies, government agencies, universities, and individuals participating in a consensus process to develop publicly available geoprocessing specifications. Open interfaces and protocols defined by OpenGIS Specifications support interoperable solutions that &quot;geo-enable&quot; the Web, wireless and location-based services, and mainstream IT, and empower technology developers to make complex spatial information and services accessible and useful with all kinds of applications. Open Geospatial Consortium protocols include Web Map Service, and Web Feature Service.

GIS products are broken down by the OGC into two categories, based on how completely and accurately the software follows the OGC specifications.
&quot;Compliant products&quot; are software products that comply to OGC&#x27;s OpenGIS Specifications. When a product has been tested and certified as compliant through the OGC Testing Program, the product is automatically registered as &quot;compliant&quot; on this site.

&quot;Implementing products&quot; are software products that implement OpenGIS Specifications but have not yet passed a compliance test. Compliance tests are not available for all specifications. Developers can register their products as implementing draft or approved specifications, though OGC reserves the right to review and verify each entry.

===Adding the dimension of time===
The condition of the Earth&#x27;s surface, atmosphere, and subsurface can be examined by feeding satellite data into a GIS. GIS technology gives researchers the ability to examine the variations in Earth processes over days, months, and years through the use of cartographic visualizations. As an example, the changes in vegetation vigor through a growing season can be animated to determine when drought was most extensive in a particular region. The resulting graphic represents a rough measure of plant health. Working with two variables over time would then allow researchers to detect regional differences in the lag between a decline in rainfall and its effect on vegetation.

GIS technology and the availability of digital data on regional and global scales enable such analyses. The satellite sensor output used to generate a vegetation graphic is produced for example by the advanced very-high-resolution radiometer (AVHRR). This sensor system detects the amounts of energy reflected from the Earth&#x27;s surface across various bands of the spectrum for surface areas of about . The satellite sensor produces images of a particular location on the Earth twice a day. AVHRR and more recently the moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) are only two of many sensor systems used for Earth surface analysis.

In addition to the integration of time in environmental studies, GIS is also being explored for its ability to track and model the progress of humans throughout their daily routines. A concrete example of progress in this area is the recent release of time-specific population data by the U.S. Census. In this data set, the populations of cities are shown for daytime and evening hours highlighting the pattern of concentration and dispersion generated by North American commuting patterns. The manipulation and generation of data required to produce this data would not have been possible without GIS.

Using models to project the data held by a GIS forward in time have enabled planners to test policy decisions using spatial decision support systems.

==Semantics==
Tools and technologies emerging from the World Wide Web Consortium&#x27;s Semantic Web are proving useful for data integration problems in information systems. Correspondingly, such technologies have been proposed as a means to facilitate interoperability and data reuse among GIS applications and also to enable new analysis mechanisms.

Ontologies are a key component of this semantic approach as they allow a formal, machine-readable specification of the concepts and relationships in a given domain. This in turn allows a GIS to focus on the intended meaning of data rather than its syntax or structure. For example, reasoning that a land cover type classified as &quot;deciduous needleleaf trees&quot; in one dataset is a specialization or subset of land cover type &quot;forest&quot; in another more roughly classified dataset can help a GIS automatically merge the two datasets under the more general land cover classification. Tentative ontologies have been developed in areas related to GIS applications, for example the hydrology ontology developed by the Ordnance Survey in the United Kingdom and the SWEET ontologies developed by NASA&#x27;s Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Also, simpler ontologies and semantic metadata standards are being proposed by the W3C Geo Incubator Group to represent geospatial data on the web. GeoSPARQL is a standard developed by the Ordnance Survey, United States Geological Survey, Natural Resources Canada, Australia&#x27;s Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation and others to support ontology creation and reasoning using well-understood OGC literals (GML, WKT), topological relationships (Simple Features, RCC8, DE-9IM), RDF and the SPARQL database query protocols.

Recent research results in this area can be seen in the International Conference on Geospatial Semantics and the Terra Cognita – Directions to the Geospatial Semantic Web workshop at the International Semantic Web Conference.

==Societal implications==

With the popularization of GIS in decision making, scholars have begun to scrutinize the social and political implications of GIS. GIS can also be misused to distort reality for individual and political gain. It has been argued that the production, distribution, utilization, and representation of geographic information are largely related with the social context and has the potential to increase citizen trust in government. Other related topics include discussion on copyright, privacy, and censorship. A more optimistic social approach to GIS adoption is to use it as a tool for public participation.

===In education===

At the end of the 20th century, GIS began to be recognized as tools that could be used in the classroom. The benefits of GIS in education seem focused on developing spatial cognition, but there is not enough bibliography or statistical data to show the concrete scope of the use of GIS in education around the world, although the expansion has been faster in those countries where the curriculum mentions them.

GIS seems to provide many advantages in teaching geography because it allows for analysis based on real geographic data and also helps raise research questions from teachers and students in the classroom. It also contributes to improvement in learning by developing spatial and geographical thinking and, in many cases, student motivation.

Courses in GIS are also offered by educational institutions.

===In local government===
GIS is proven as an organization-wide, enterprise and enduring technology that continues to change how local government operates. Government agencies have adopted GIS technology as a method to better manage the following areas of government organization:
* Economic development departments use interactive GIS mapping tools, aggregated with other data (demographics, labor force, business, industry, talent) along with a database of available commercial sites and buildings in order to attract investment and support existing business. Businesses making location decisions can use the tools to choose communities and sites that best match their criteria for success.
* Public safety operations such as emergency operations centers, fire prevention, police and sheriff mobile technology and dispatch, and mapping weather risks.
* Parks and recreation departments and their functions in asset inventory, land conservation, land management, and cemetery management
* Public works and utilities, tracking water and stormwater drainage, electrical assets, engineering projects, and public transportation assets and trends
* Fiber network management for interdepartmental network assets
* School analytical and demographic data, asset management, and improvement/expansion planning
* Public administration for election data, property records, and zoning/management

The open data initiative is pushing local government to take advantage of technology such as GIS technology, as it encompasses the requirements to fit the open data/open government model of transparency. With open data, local government organizations can implement citizen engagement applications and online portals, allowing citizens to see land information, report potholes and signage issues, view and sort parks by assets, view real-time crime rates and utility repairs, and much more. The push for open data within government organizations is driving the growth in local government GIS technology spending, and database management.

<text>In mathematics and computer science, graph theory is the study of &quot;graphs&quot;, which are mathematical structures used to model pairwise relations between objects. A graph in this context is made up of &quot;vertices&quot; (also called &quot;nodes&quot; or &quot;points&quot;) which are connected by &quot;edges&quot; (also called &quot;arcs&quot;, &quot;links&quot; or &quot;lines&quot;). A distinction is made between undirected graphs, where edges link two vertices symmetrically, and directed graphs, where edges link two vertices asymmetrically. Graphs are one of the principal objects of study in discrete mathematics.

== Definitions ==

Definitions in graph theory vary. The following are some of the more basic ways of defining graphs and related mathematical structures.

=== Graph ===
In one restricted but very common sense of the term, a graph is an ordered pair formula_1 comprising:
* formula_2, a set of vertices (also called nodes or points);
* formula_3, a set of edges (also called links or lines), which are unordered pairs of vertices (that is, an edge is associated with two distinct vertices).

To avoid ambiguity, this type of object may be called precisely an undirected simple graph.

In the edge formula_4, the vertices formula_5 and formula_6 are called the endpoints of the edge. The edge is said to join formula_5 and formula_6 and to be incident on formula_5 and on formula_6. A vertex may exist in a graph and not belong to an edge. Under this definition, multiple edges, in which two or more edges connect the same vertices, are not allowed.
In one more general sense of the term allowing multiple edges, a graph is an ordered triple formula_11 comprising:
* formula_2, a set of vertices (also called nodes or points);
* formula_13, a set of edges (also called links or lines);
* formula_14, an incidence function mapping every edge to an unordered pair of vertices (that is, an edge is associated with two distinct vertices).

To avoid ambiguity, this type of object may be called precisely an undirected multigraph.

A loop is an edge that joins a vertex to itself. Graphs as defined in the two definitions above cannot have loops, because a loop joining a vertex formula_5 to itself is the edge (for an undirected simple graph) or is incident on (for an undirected multigraph) formula_16 which is not in formula_17. To allow loops, the definitions must be expanded. For undirected simple graphs, the definition of formula_13 should be modified to formula_19. For undirected multigraphs, the definition of formula_20 should be modified to formula_21. To avoid ambiguity, these types of objects may be called undirected simple graph permitting loops and undirected multigraph permitting loops (sometimes also undirected pseudograph), respectively.

formula_2 and formula_13 are usually taken to be finite, and many of the well-known results are not true (or are rather different) for infinite graphs because many of the arguments fail in the infinite case. Moreover, formula_2 is often assumed to be non-empty, but formula_13 is allowed to be the empty set. The order of a graph is formula_26, its number of vertices. The size of a graph is formula_27, its number of edges. The degree or valency of a vertex is the number of edges that are incident to it, where a loop is counted twice. The degree of a graph is the maximum of the degrees of its vertices.

In an undirected simple graph of order &quot;n&quot;, the maximum degree of each vertex is and the maximum size of the graph is .

The edges of an undirected simple graph permitting loops formula_28 induce a symmetric homogeneous relation formula_29 on the vertices of formula_28 that is called the adjacency relation of formula_28. Specifically, for each edge formula_32, its endpoints formula_5 and formula_6 are said to be adjacent to one another, which is denoted formula_35.

=== Directed graph ===

A directed graph or digraph is a graph in which edges have orientations.

In one restricted but very common sense of the term, a directed graph is an ordered pair formula_1 comprising:
* formula_2, a set of &quot;vertices&quot; (also called &quot;nodes&quot; or &quot;points&quot;);
* formula_38, a set of &quot;edges&quot; (also called &quot;directed edges&quot;, &quot;directed links&quot;, &quot;directed lines&quot;, &quot;arrows&quot; or &quot;arcs&quot;) which are ordered pairs of vertices (that is, an edge is associated with two distinct vertices).

To avoid ambiguity, this type of object may be called precisely a directed simple graph. In set theory and graph theory, formula_39 denotes the set of -tuples of elements of formula_40 that is, ordered sequences of formula_41 elements that are not necessarily distinct.

In the edge formula_42 directed from formula_5 to formula_6, the vertices formula_5 and formula_6 are called the &quot;endpoints&quot; of the edge, formula_5 the &quot;tail&quot; of the edge and formula_6 the &quot;head&quot; of the edge. The edge is said to &quot;join&quot; formula_5 and formula_6 and to be &quot;incident&quot; on formula_5 and on formula_6. A vertex may exist in a graph and not belong to an edge. The edge formula_53 is called the &quot;inverted edge&quot; of formula_42. &quot;Multiple edges&quot;, not allowed under the definition above, are two or more edges with both the same tail and the same head.

In one more general sense of the term allowing multiple edges, a directed graph is an ordered triple formula_11 comprising:
* formula_2, a set of &quot;vertices&quot; (also called &quot;nodes&quot; or &quot;points&quot;);
* formula_13, a set of &quot;edges&quot; (also called &quot;directed edges&quot;, &quot;directed links&quot;, &quot;directed lines&quot;, &quot;arrows&quot; or &quot;arcs&quot;);
* formula_58, an &quot;incidence function&quot; mapping every edge to an ordered pair of vertices (that is, an edge is associated with two distinct vertices).

To avoid ambiguity, this type of object may be called precisely a directed multigraph.

A &quot;loop&quot; is an edge that joins a vertex to itself. Directed graphs as defined in the two definitions above cannot have loops, because a loop joining a vertex formula_5 to itself is the edge (for a directed simple graph) or is incident on (for a directed multigraph) formula_60 which is not in formula_61. So to allow loops the definitions must be expanded. For directed simple graphs, the definition of formula_13 should be modified to formula_63. For directed multigraphs, the definition of formula_20 should be modified to formula_65. To avoid ambiguity, these types of objects may be called precisely a directed simple graph permitting loops and a directed multigraph permitting loops (or a &quot;quiver&quot;) respectively.

The edges of a directed simple graph permitting loops formula_28 is a homogeneous relation ~ on the vertices of formula_28 that is called the &quot;adjacency relation&quot; of formula_28. Specifically, for each edge formula_32, its endpoints formula_5 and formula_6 are said to be &quot;adjacent&quot; to one another, which is denoted formula_5 ~ formula_6.

== Applications ==
Graphs can be used to model many types of relations and processes in physical, biological, social and information systems. Many practical problems can be represented by graphs. Emphasizing their application to real-world systems, the term &quot;network&quot; is sometimes defined to mean a graph in which attributes (e.g. names) are associated with the vertices and edges, and the subject that expresses and understands real-world systems as a network is called network science.

=== Computer science ===
Within computer science, &#x27;causal&#x27; and &#x27;non-causal&#x27; linked structures are graphs that are used to represent networks of communication, data organization, computational devices, the flow of computation, etc. For instance, the link structure of a website can be represented by a directed graph, in which the vertices represent web pages and directed edges represent links from one page to another. A similar approach can be taken to problems in social media, travel, biology, computer chip design, mapping the progression of neuro-degenerative diseases, and many other fields. The development of algorithms to handle graphs is therefore of major interest in computer science. The transformation of graphs is often formalized and represented by graph rewrite systems. Complementary to graph transformation systems focusing on rule-based in-memory manipulation of graphs are graph databases geared towards transaction-safe, persistent storing and querying of graph-structured data.

=== Linguistics ===
Graph-theoretic methods, in various forms, have proven particularly useful in linguistics, since natural language often lends itself well to discrete structure. Traditionally, syntax and compositional semantics follow tree-based structures, whose expressive power lies in the principle of compositionality, modeled in a hierarchical graph. More contemporary approaches such as head-driven phrase structure grammar model the syntax of natural language using typed feature structures, which are directed acyclic graphs. 
Within lexical semantics, especially as applied to computers, modeling word meaning is easier when a given word is understood in terms of related words; semantic networks are therefore important in computational linguistics. Still, other methods in phonology (e.g. optimality theory, which uses lattice graphs) and morphology (e.g. finite-state morphology, using finite-state transducers) are common in the analysis of language as a graph. Indeed, the usefulness of this area of mathematics to linguistics has borne organizations such as TextGraphs, as well as various &#x27;Net&#x27; projects, such as WordNet, VerbNet, and others.

=== Physics and chemistry ===
Graph theory is also used to study molecules in chemistry and physics. In condensed matter physics, the three-dimensional structure of complicated simulated atomic structures can be studied quantitatively by gathering statistics on graph-theoretic properties related to the topology of the atoms. Also, &quot;the Feynman graphs and rules of calculation summarize quantum field theory in a form in close contact with the experimental numbers one wants to understand.&quot; In chemistry a graph makes a natural model for a molecule, where vertices represent atoms and edges bonds. This approach is especially used in computer processing of molecular structures, ranging from chemical editors to database searching. In statistical physics, graphs can represent local connections between interacting parts of a system, as well as the dynamics of a physical process on such
systems. Similarly, in computational neuroscience graphs can be used to represent functional connections between brain areas that interact to give rise to various cognitive processes, where the vertices represent different areas of the brain and the edges represent the connections between those areas. Graph theory plays an important role in electrical modeling of electrical networks, here, weights are associated with resistance of the wire segments to obtain electrical properties of network structures. Graphs are also used to represent the micro-scale channels of porous media, in which the vertices represent the pores and the edges represent the smaller channels connecting the pores. Chemical graph theory uses the molecular graph as a means to model molecules.
Graphs and networks are excellent models to study and understand phase transitions and critical phenomena.
Removal of nodes or edges leads to a critical transition where the network breaks into small clusters which is studied as a phase transition. This breakdown is studied via percolation theory.

=== Social sciences ===

Graph theory is also widely used in sociology as a way, for example, to measure actors&#x27; prestige or to explore rumor spreading, notably through the use of social network analysis software. Under the umbrella of social networks are many different types of graphs. Acquaintanceship and friendship graphs describe whether people know each other. Influence graphs model whether certain people can influence the behavior of others. Finally, collaboration graphs model whether two people work together in a particular way, such as acting in a movie together.

=== Biology ===
Likewise, graph theory is useful in biology and conservation efforts where a vertex can represent regions where certain species exist (or inhabit) and the edges represent migration paths or movement between the regions. This information is important when looking at breeding patterns or tracking the spread of disease, parasites or how changes to the movement can affect other species.

Graphs are also commonly used in molecular biology and genomics to model and analyse datasets with complex relationships. For example, graph-based methods are often used to &#x27;cluster&#x27; cells together into cell-types in single-cell transcriptome analysis. Another use is to model genes or proteins in a pathway and study the relationships between them, such as metabolic pathways and gene regulatory networks. Evolutionary trees, ecological networks, and hierarchical clustering of gene expression patterns are also represented as graph structures. 

Graph theory is also used in connectomics; nervous systems can be seen as a graph, where the nodes are neurons and the edges are the connections between them.

=== Mathematics ===
In mathematics, graphs are useful in geometry and certain parts of topology such as knot theory. Algebraic graph theory has close links with group theory. Algebraic graph theory has been applied to many areas including dynamic systems and complexity.

=== Other topics ===
A graph structure can be extended by assigning a weight to each edge of the graph. Graphs with weights, or weighted graphs, are used to represent structures in which pairwise connections have some numerical values. For example, if a graph represents a road network, the weights could represent the length of each road. There may be several weights associated with each edge, including distance (as in the previous example), travel time, or monetary cost. Such weighted graphs are commonly used to program GPS&#x27;s, and travel-planning search engines that compare flight times and costs.

== History ==

The paper written by Leonhard Euler on the Seven Bridges of Königsberg and published in 1736 is regarded as the first paper in the history of graph theory. This paper, as well as the one written by Vandermonde on the &quot;knight problem,&quot; carried on with the &quot;analysis situs&quot; initiated by Leibniz. Euler&#x27;s formula relating the number of edges, vertices, and faces of a convex polyhedron was studied and generalized by Cauchy and L&#x27;Huilier, and represents the beginning of the branch of mathematics known as topology.

More than one century after Euler&#x27;s paper on the bridges of Königsberg and while Listing was introducing the concept of topology, Cayley was led by an interest in particular analytical forms arising from differential calculus to study a particular class of graphs, the &quot;trees&quot;. This study had many implications for theoretical chemistry. The techniques he used mainly concern the enumeration of graphs with particular properties. Enumerative graph theory then arose from the results of Cayley and the fundamental results published by Pólya between 1935 and 1937. These were generalized by De Bruijn in 1959. Cayley linked his results on trees with contemporary studies of chemical composition. The fusion of ideas from mathematics with those from chemistry began what has become part of the standard terminology of graph theory.

In particular, the term &quot;graph&quot; was introduced by Sylvester in a paper published in 1878 in &quot;Nature&quot;, where he draws an analogy between &quot;quantic invariants&quot; and &quot;co-variants&quot; of algebra and molecular diagrams:
:&quot;[…] Every invariant and co-variant thus becomes expressible by a &quot;graph&quot; precisely identical with a Kekuléan diagram or chemicograph. […] I give a rule for the geometrical multiplication of graphs, &quot;i.e.&quot; for constructing a &quot;graph&quot; to the product of in- or co-variants whose separate graphs are given. […]&quot; (italics as in the original).

The first textbook on graph theory was written by Dénes Kőnig, and published in 1936. Another book by Frank Harary, published in 1969, was &quot;considered the world over to be the definitive textbook on the subject&quot;, and enabled mathematicians, chemists, electrical engineers and social scientists to talk to each other. Harary donated all of the royalties to fund the Pólya Prize.

One of the most famous and stimulating problems in graph theory is the four color problem: &quot;Is it true that any map drawn in the plane may have its regions colored with four colors, in such a way that any two regions having a common border have different colors?&quot; This problem was first posed by Francis Guthrie in 1852 and its first written record is in a letter of De Morgan addressed to Hamilton the same year. Many incorrect proofs have been proposed, including those by Cayley, Kempe, and others. The study and the generalization of this problem by Tait, Heawood, Ramsey and Hadwiger led to the study of the colorings of the graphs embedded on surfaces with arbitrary genus. Tait&#x27;s reformulation generated a new class of problems, the &quot;factorization problems&quot;, particularly studied by Petersen and Kőnig. The works of Ramsey on colorations and more specially the results obtained by Turán in 1941 was at the origin of another branch of graph theory, &quot;extremal graph theory&quot;.

The four color problem remained unsolved for more than a century. In 1969 Heinrich Heesch published a method for solving the problem using computers. A computer-aided proof produced in 1976 by Kenneth Appel and Wolfgang Haken makes fundamental use of the notion of &quot;discharging&quot; developed by Heesch. The proof involved checking the properties of 1,936 configurations by computer, and was not fully accepted at the time due to its complexity. A simpler proof considering only 633 configurations was given twenty years later by Robertson, Seymour, Sanders and Thomas.

The autonomous development of topology from 1860 and 1930 fertilized graph theory back through the works of Jordan, Kuratowski and Whitney. Another important factor of common development of graph theory and topology came from the use of the techniques of modern algebra. The first example of such a use comes from the work of the physicist Gustav Kirchhoff, who published in 1845 his Kirchhoff&#x27;s circuit laws for calculating the voltage and current in electric circuits.

The introduction of probabilistic methods in graph theory, especially in the study of Erdős and Rényi of the asymptotic probability of graph connectivity, gave rise to yet another branch, known as &quot;random graph theory&quot;, which has been a fruitful source of graph-theoretic results.

== Representation ==
A graph is an abstraction of relationships that emerge in nature; hence, it cannot be coupled to a certain representation. The way it is represented depends on the degree of convenience such representation provides for a certain application. The most common representations are the visual, in which, usually, vertices are drawn and connected by edges, and the tabular, in which rows of a table provide information about the relationships between the vertices within the graph.

=== Visual: Graph drawing ===

Graphs are usually represented visually by drawing a point or circle for every vertex, and drawing a line between two vertices if they are connected by an edge. If the graph is directed, the direction is indicated by drawing an arrow. If the graph is weighted, the weight is added on the arrow.

A graph drawing should not be confused with the graph itself (the abstract, non-visual structure) as there are several ways to structure the graph drawing. All that matters is which vertices are connected to which others by how many edges and not the exact layout. In practice, it is often difficult to decide if two drawings represent the same graph. Depending on the problem domain some layouts may be better suited and easier to understand than others.

The pioneering work of W. T. Tutte was very influential on the subject of graph drawing. Among other achievements, he introduced the use of linear algebraic methods to obtain graph drawings.

Graph drawing also can be said to encompass problems that deal with the crossing number and its various generalizations. The crossing number of a graph is the minimum number of intersections between edges that a drawing of the graph in the plane must contain. For a planar graph, the crossing number is zero by definition. Drawings on surfaces other than the plane are also studied.

There are other techniques to visualize a graph away from vertices and edges, including circle packings, intersection graph, and other visualizations of the adjacency matrix.

=== Tabular: Graph data structures ===

The tabular representation lends itself well to computational applications. There are different ways to store graphs in a computer system. The data structure used depends on both the graph structure and the algorithm used for manipulating the graph. Theoretically one can distinguish between list and matrix structures but in concrete applications the best structure is often a combination of both. List structures are often preferred for sparse graphs as they have smaller memory requirements. Matrix structures on the other hand provide faster access for some applications but can consume huge amounts of memory. Implementations of sparse matrix structures that are efficient on modern parallel computer architectures are an object of current investigation.

List structures include the edge list, an array of pairs of vertices, and the adjacency list, which separately lists the neighbors of each vertex: Much like the edge list, each vertex has a list of which vertices it is adjacent to.

Matrix structures include the incidence matrix, a matrix of 0&#x27;s and 1&#x27;s whose rows represent vertices and whose columns represent edges, and the adjacency matrix, in which both the rows and columns are indexed by vertices. In both cases a 1 indicates two adjacent objects and a 0 indicates two non-adjacent objects. The degree matrix indicates the degree of vertices. The Laplacian matrix is a modified form of the adjacency matrix that incorporates information about the degrees of the vertices, and is useful in some calculations such as Kirchhoff&#x27;s theorem on the number of spanning trees of a graph.
The distance matrix, like the adjacency matrix, has both its rows and columns indexed by vertices, but rather than containing a 0 or a 1 in each cell it contains the length of a shortest path between two vertices.

== Problems ==
=== Enumeration ===
There is a large literature on graphical enumeration: the problem of counting graphs meeting specified conditions. Some of this work is found in Harary and Palmer (1973).

=== Subgraphs, induced subgraphs, and minors ===
A common problem, called the subgraph isomorphism problem, is finding a fixed graph as a subgraph in a given graph. One reason to be interested in such a question is that many graph properties are &quot;hereditary&quot; for subgraphs, which means that a graph has the property if and only if all subgraphs have it too.
Finding maximal subgraphs of a certain kind is often an NP-complete problem. For example:
* Finding the largest complete subgraph is called the clique problem (NP-complete).

One special case of subgraph isomorphism is the graph isomorphism problem. It asks whether two graphs are isomorphic. It is not known whether this problem is NP-complete, nor whether it can be solved in polynomial time.

A similar problem is finding induced subgraphs in a given graph. Again, some important graph properties are hereditary with respect to induced subgraphs, which means that a graph has a property if and only if all induced subgraphs also have it. Finding maximal induced subgraphs of a certain kind is also often NP-complete. For example:
* Finding the largest edgeless induced subgraph or independent set is called the independent set problem (NP-complete).

Still another such problem, the minor containment problem, is to find a fixed graph as a minor of a given graph. A minor or subcontraction of a graph is any graph obtained by taking a subgraph and contracting some (or no) edges. Many graph properties are hereditary for minors, which means that a graph has a property if and only if all minors have it too. For example, Wagner&#x27;s Theorem states: 
* A graph is planar if it contains as a minor neither the complete bipartite graph &quot;K&quot;3,3 (see the Three-cottage problem) nor the complete graph &quot;K&quot;5.

A similar problem, the subdivision containment problem, is to find a fixed graph as a subdivision of a given graph. A subdivision or homeomorphism of a graph is any graph obtained by subdividing some (or no) edges. Subdivision containment is related to graph properties such as planarity. For example, Kuratowski&#x27;s Theorem states:
* A graph is planar if it contains as a subdivision neither the complete bipartite graph &quot;K&quot;3,3 nor the complete graph &quot;K&quot;5.

Another problem in subdivision containment is the Kelmans–Seymour conjecture:
* Every 5-vertex-connected graph that is not planar contains a subdivision of the 5-vertex complete graph &quot;K&quot;5.
Another class of problems has to do with the extent to which various species and generalizations of graphs are determined by their &quot;point-deleted subgraphs&quot;. For example:
* The reconstruction conjecture

=== Graph coloring ===

Many problems and theorems in graph theory have to do with various ways of coloring graphs. Typically, one is interested in coloring a graph so that no two adjacent vertices have the same color, or with other similar restrictions. One may also consider coloring edges (possibly so that no two coincident edges are the same color), or other variations. Among the famous results and conjectures concerning graph coloring are the following:
* Four-color theorem
* Strong perfect graph theorem
* Erdős–Faber–Lovász conjecture 
* Total coloring conjecture, also called Behzad&#x27;s conjecture (unsolved)
* List coloring conjecture (unsolved)
* Hadwiger conjecture (graph theory) (unsolved)

=== Subsumption and unification ===
Constraint modeling theories concern families of directed graphs related by a partial order. In these applications, graphs are ordered by specificity, meaning that more constrained graphs—which are more specific and thus contain a greater amount of information—are subsumed by those that are more general. Operations between graphs include evaluating the direction of a subsumption relationship between two graphs, if any, and computing graph unification. The unification of two argument graphs is defined as the most general graph (or the computation thereof) that is consistent with (i.e. contains all of the information in) the inputs, if such a graph exists; efficient unification algorithms are known.

For constraint frameworks which are strictly compositional, graph unification is the sufficient satisfiability and combination function. Well-known applications include automatic theorem proving and modeling the elaboration of linguistic structure.

=== Route problems ===
* Hamiltonian path problem
* Minimum spanning tree
* Route inspection problem (also called the &quot;Chinese postman problem&quot;)
* Seven bridges of Königsberg
* Shortest path problem
* Steiner tree
* Three-cottage problem
* Traveling salesman problem (NP-hard)

=== Network flow ===
There are numerous problems arising especially from applications that have to do with various notions of flows in networks, for example:
* Max flow min cut theorem

=== Visibility problems ===
* Museum guard problem

=== Covering problems ===
Covering problems in graphs may refer to various set cover problems on subsets of vertices/subgraphs.
* Dominating set problem is the special case of set cover problem where sets are the closed neighborhoods.
* Vertex cover problem is the special case of set cover problem where sets to cover are every edges.
* The original set cover problem, also called hitting set, can be described as a vertex cover in a hypergraph.

=== Decomposition problems ===
Decomposition, defined as partitioning the edge set of a graph (with as many vertices as necessary accompanying the edges of each part of the partition), has a wide variety of questions. Often, the problem is to decompose a graph into subgraphs isomorphic to a fixed graph; for instance, decomposing a complete graph into Hamiltonian cycles. Other problems specify a family of graphs into which a given graph should be decomposed, for instance, a family of cycles, or decomposing a complete graph &quot;K&quot;&quot;n&quot; into specified trees having, respectively, 1, 2, 3, ..., edges.

Some specific decomposition problems and similar problems that have been studied include:
* Arboricity, a decomposition into as few forests as possible
* Cycle double cover, a collection of cycles covering each edge exactly twice
* Edge coloring, a decomposition into as few matchings as possible
* Graph factorization, a decomposition of a regular graph into regular subgraphs of given degrees

=== Graph classes ===
Many problems involve characterizing the members of various classes of graphs. Some examples of such questions are below:
* Enumerating the members of a class
* Characterizing a class in terms of forbidden substructures
* Ascertaining relationships among classes (e.g. does one property of graphs imply another)
* Finding efficient algorithms to decide membership in a class
* Finding representations for members of a class

<text>Gumby is a cartoon character and associated media franchise created by Art Clokey. Gumby is a blocky green humanoid made of clay.

Gumby stars in two television series, &quot;&quot;, and other media. Upon his debut in 1953, he immediately became a famous example of stop-motion clay animation and an American cultural icon, spawning tributes, parodies, and merchandising.

==Overview==
The &quot;Gumby&quot; franchise follows Gumby&#x27;s adventures through different environments and historical eras. His primary sidekick is Pokey, an anthropomorphic orange pony. His archnemeses are the Blockheads, a pair of silent, antagonistic, red humanoid figures with cube-shaped heads; one has the letter G on the side of his head, while the other has a J. Their creation was inspired by the trouble-making Katzenjammer Kids. Other characters include Prickle, a yellow fire-breathing dinosaur who sometimes styles himself as a detective with pipe and deerstalker hat like Sherlock Holmes; Goo, a flying blue shapeshifting mermaid who spits blue goo balls; Gumbo and Gumba, Gumby&#x27;s parents; and Nopey, Gumby&#x27;s dog whose entire vocabulary is the word &quot;nope&quot;. The 1988 syndicated series added Gumby&#x27;s sister Minga, mastodon friend Denali, and chicken friend Tilly.

==History==
===1953–1969: Origins===
Gumby was created by Art Clokey in the early 1950s after he finished film school at the University of Southern California (USC).

Clokey&#x27;s first animated film was a 1953 three-minute student film titled &quot;Gumbasia&quot;, a surreal montage of moving and expanding lumps of clay set to music in a parody of Disney&#x27;s &quot;Fantasia&quot;. &quot;Gumbasia&quot; was created in the &quot;kinesthetic&quot; style taught by Clokey&#x27;s USC professor Slavko Vorkapić, described as &quot;massaging of the eye cells&quot;. Much of Gumby&#x27;s look and feel was inspired by this technique of camera movements and editing.

In 1955, Clokey showed &quot;Gumbasia&quot; to film producer Sam Engel, who encouraged him to develop his technique by animating figures into children&#x27;s stories. On January 29, 1955, Clokey produced and filmed the first pilot episode starring Gumby, titled &quot;Adventures of Gumby: A Sample&quot;, which never aired.

The name &quot;Gumby&quot; was derived from the muddy clay found at Clokey&#x27;s grandparents&#x27; farm that his family named &quot;gumbo&quot;. Gumby&#x27;s appearance was inspired by a suggestion from Clokey&#x27;s wife Ruth (née Parkander) that Gumby be based on the Gingerbread Man. Clokey saw the color green as both racially neutral and a symbol of life. Gumby&#x27;s legs and feet were made wide to pragmatically ensure that the figure would stand erect during stop-motion filming. Gumby&#x27;s slanted head was based on the hairstyle of Clokey&#x27;s father, Charles Farrington, in an old photograph.

The pilot episode was seen by NBC executive Thomas Warren Sarnoff, who asked Clokey to make another one. The second episode, &quot;Gumby on the Moon&quot;, became a when featured on &quot;Howdy Doody&quot;, so Sarnoff ordered a series in 1955 titled &quot;The Gumby Show&quot;. In 1955 and 1956, 25 11-minute episodes aired on NBC. In early episodes, Gumby&#x27;s voice was provided by Ruth Eggleston, wife of the show&#x27;s art director Al Eggleston, until 1957, when Dallas McKennon assumed the role. Al Eggleston also invented Pokey, the little orange pony who was Gumby&#x27;s best friend and was introduced during the earliest episodes.

Because of its variety format, &quot;The Gumby Show&quot; features Clokey&#x27;s animations plus interviews and games. During this time, the show had two successive hosts, Robert Nicholson and Pinky Lee.

In 1959, &quot;The Gumby Show&quot; entered syndication, and more episodes were produced in the 1960s. Production started in Hollywood and in 1960 moved to a larger studio in Glendora, California, where it remained until production ended in 1969. During this time, Gumby was primarily voiced by Norma MacMillan and occasionally by Ginny Tyler. The cartoon shorts introduced new characters, including a blue mermaid named Goo and a yellow dinosaur named Prickle.

Several sources claim that Dick Beals also voiced Gumby in the 1960s series. However, Beals refuted this claim in a 2001 interview.

===1982–1989: Revival===
Beginning in 1982, Gumby was parodied by Eddie Murphy on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;. The sketches depict Gumby as an irascible, cigar-chomping celebrity who is highly demanding of the production executives. Whenever they refuse his demands, Gumby asserts his star status by saying &quot;I&#x27;m &quot;Gumby&quot;, dammit!&quot; in an exaggerated Jewish accent. According to Clokey&#x27;s son Joseph, his father and he &quot;thought Eddie was a genius in the way he played that character&quot;. In 1987, the original &quot;Gumby&quot; shorts were released on home video. In 1988, Gumby appeared in &quot;The Puppetoon Movie&quot;.

This renewed interest led to a new &quot;Gumby Adventures&quot; series of 99 seven-minute episodes, produced for television syndication in association with Lorimar-Telepictures in 1988. Dallas McKennon voices Gumby in the new adventures, in which Gumby and his pals travels beyond their toyland setting as a musical band. &quot;Gumby Adventures&quot; includes new characters, such as Gumby&#x27;s little sister Minga, a mastodon named Denali and a chicken named Tilly.

The 1988 series includes the 1950s and 1960s shorts with rerecorded voices, and the original music was replaced by Jerry Gerber&#x27;s synthesizer score. Legal issues prevented Clokey from renewing rights to the original Capitol Records production tracks.

===1990–2021: feature film and reruns===
Starting in 1992, TV channels such as Nickelodeon and Cartoon Network aired reruns of &quot;Gumby&quot; episodes. In 1995, Clokey&#x27;s production company produced an independently released theatrical film, &quot;&quot;, as the character&#x27;s first feature-length adventure, with John R. Dilworth, creator of &quot;Courage the Cowardly Dog&quot;, as animation consultant. In the film, the villainous Blockheads replace Gumby and his band with robots and kidnap their dog, Lowbelly. It contains homages to science-fiction films such as &quot;Star Wars&quot;, &quot;The Terminator&quot; and &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot;. In 1998, the &quot;Gumby&quot; episode &quot;Robot Rumpus&quot; was featured on &quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000&quot;.

On March 16, 2007, YouTube announced that all &quot;Gumby&quot; episodes would appear in their full-length form on its site, digitally remastered and with their original soundtracks. This deal also extended to other video sites, including AOL. In March 2007, KQED-TV broadcast an hour-long documentary titled &quot;Gumby Dharma&quot; in its &quot;Truly CA&quot; series. It details Clokey&#x27;s life and work, and has new animation of Gumby and Pokey. For these sequences, animator Stephen A. Buckley voiced Gumby and Clokey voiced Pokey.

In 2012, MeTV began airing &quot;Gumby&quot; in its weekend morning animation block until the end of the year.

In 2014, the VOD service Kabillion broadcast &quot;Gumby&quot;.

In 2017, a comic series was published that seemingly takes place after the movie. The series was canceled after three issues.

===2022–present: Fox ownership===
In February 2022, Fox Entertainment, the TV production division of the Murdoch family&#x27;s Fox Corporation, announced it had acquired the &quot;Gumby&quot; intellectual property from the estate of Art&#x27;s son, Joseph Clokey, encompassing all rights including &quot;film, TV and streaming, consumer products, licensing, publishing, and all other categories&quot;, with plans to launch new series across linear and digital platforms, while adding to the classic &quot;Gumby&quot; material available on its free streaming platform Tubi. Before Fox took ownership of the series, Gumby made a cameo in the 17th season of &quot;The Simpsons&quot; in the episode &quot;The Girl Who Slept Too Little&quot;.

In June 2024, two Gumby series were announced to be in the works: a two-dimensional children&#x27;s animated series titled &quot;Gumby Kids&quot; and an adult animated series. Both series were to be produced by Bento Box Entertainment.

==Reception and legacy==
In 1993, &quot;TV Guide&quot; named &quot;Gumby&quot; the best cartoon series of the 1950s in its issue celebrating 40 years of television.

Beginning in 1994, the Library of Congress used Gumby as a &quot;spokescharacter&quot; for &quot;Adventures into Books: Gumby&#x27;s World&quot;, a traveling exhibition promoting the Center for the Book&#x27;s national reading campaign from 1997 to 2000. By the end of the 1990s, Gumby and Pokey had also appeared in various commercials for Cheerios cereal, with Gumby voiced by Stephen A. Buckley.

On August 4, 2006, the Center for Puppetry Arts in Atlanta opened &quot;Art Clokey&#x27;s Gumby: The First Fifty Years&quot;. This exhibition featured many of the original puppets and sets, along with screening of Clokey&#x27;s films. This event was conceived by David Scheve of T.D.A. Animation and Joe Clokey of Premavision, and was one of several exhibits that opened around the country, celebrating the 50th anniversary of &quot;The Gumby Show&quot;. The children&#x27;s book &quot;Gumby Goes to the Sun&quot; was also published that year to commemorate the anniversary. The book was originally created in the 1980s by Clokey&#x27;s daughter, Holly Harman (who voiced Gumby&#x27;s sister, Minga, in the 1988 series).

In 2007, the &quot;Gumby&quot; comic book series was nominated for two Eisner Awards, Best New Series and Best Publication for a Young Audience, and won the latter. A Gumby graphic novel titled &quot;Gumby: 50 Shades of Clay&quot; was released in 2017.

On October 12, 2011, a Google Doodle acknowledged Art Clokey&#x27;s 90th birthday. It was composed of a toy block with a &quot;G&quot; and five clay balls in the Google colors. Clicking each ball revealed the Blockheads, Prickle, Goo, Gumby, and Pokey.

On December 21, 2019, Eddie Murphy reprised his role while hosting &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; during a sketch on &quot;Weekend Update&quot;.

== Merchandising ==
The most prominent of Gumby merchandise is the bendable figure set by Lakeside Toys. Several single packs and multifigure sets were made by Jesco (later Trendmasters), and a 50th-anniversary collection. There are plush dolls, keychains, mugs, a 1988 Colorforms set, a 1995 Trendmasters playset, and a Kubricks set by Medicom. A tribute album, &quot;Gumby: The Green Album&quot;, produced by Shepard Stern, was released in 1989.

In August 2005, the first video game featuring Gumby, &quot;Gumby vs. the Astrobots&quot;, was released by Namco for the Game Boy Advance. The plot follows the Blockheads and their cohorts, the Astrobots capturing Pokey, Prickle, Goo, Gumbo, and Gumba and placing them in books. With his friends and parents in trouble, Gumby sets out to rescue them and defeat the Blockheads. The game is a sidescrolling platformer, where Gumby must navigate stages to reach the end, while avoiding enemies and pitfalls, and defeating a number of bosses from the game&#x27;s various worlds. &quot;Gumby vs. the Astrobots&quot; received generally average reviews according to review aggregator Metacritic, with an average score of 63 out of 100, based on four reviews.

The &quot;Gumby&quot; images and toys are registered trademarks of Fox Entertainment. Premavision owned the distribution rights to the &quot;Gumby&quot; cartoons, having been reverted from previous distributor Warner Bros. Television in 2003, and had licensed the rights to Classic Media until September 30, 2012. At this time, Classic Media was officially acquired by DreamWorks Animation and branded as DreamWorks Classics, which became a subsidiary of NBCUniversal in 2016. As of April 2015, NCircle Entertainment owns home video and digital distribution rights to the cartoons.

<doc id="12406" wikidata="Q9726" url="?curid=12406" title="Gioachino Rossini">
<text>Gioachino Antonio Rossini (29 February 1792 – 13 November 1868) was an Italian composer who gained fame for his 39 operas, although he also wrote many songs, some chamber music and piano pieces and some sacred music. He set new standards for both comic and serious opera before retiring from large-scale composition while still in his thirties, at the height of his popularity.

Born in Pesaro to parents who were both musicians (his father a trumpeter, his mother a singer), Rossini began to compose by the age of twelve and was educated at music school in Bologna. His first opera was performed in Venice in 1810 when he was 18 years old. In 1815 he was engaged to write operas and manage theatres in Naples. In the period 1810–1823, he wrote 34 operas for the Italian stage that were performed in Venice, Milan, Ferrara, Naples and elsewhere; this productivity necessitated an almost formulaic approach for some components (such as overtures) and a certain amount of self-borrowing. During this period he produced his most popular works, including the comic operas &quot;L&#x27;italiana in Algeri&quot;, &quot;Il barbiere di Siviglia&quot; (known in English as &quot;The Barber of Seville&quot;) and &quot;La Cenerentola&quot;, which brought to a peak the &quot;opera buffa&quot; tradition he inherited from masters such as Domenico Cimarosa and Giovanni Paisiello. He also composed &quot;opera seria&quot; works such as &quot;Tancredi&quot;, &quot;Otello&quot; and &quot;Semiramide&quot;. All of these attracted admiration for their innovation in melody, harmonic and instrumental colour, and dramatic form. In 1824 he was contracted by the Opéra in Paris, for which he produced an opera to celebrate the coronation of Charles X, &quot;Il viaggio a Reims&quot; (later cannibalised for his first opera in French, &quot;Le comte Ory&quot;), revisions of two of his Italian operas, &quot;Le siège de Corinthe&quot; and &quot;Moïse&quot;, and in 1829 his last opera, &quot;Guillaume Tell&quot;.

Rossini&#x27;s withdrawal from opera for the last 40 years of his life has never been fully explained; contributory factors may have been ill-health, the wealth his success had brought him, and the rise of spectacular grand opera under composers such as Giacomo Meyerbeer. From the early 1830s to 1855, when he left Paris and was based in Bologna, Rossini wrote relatively little. On his return to Paris in 1855 he became renowned for his musical salons on Saturdays, regularly attended by musicians and the artistic and fashionable circles of Paris, for which he wrote the entertaining pieces &quot;Péchés de vieillesse&quot;. Guests included Franz Liszt, Anton Rubinstein, Giuseppe Verdi, Meyerbeer, and Joseph Joachim. Rossini&#x27;s last major composition was his &quot;Petite messe solennelle&quot; (1863).

==Life and career==
===Early life===
Rossini was born on 29 February in 1792 in Pesaro, a town on the Adriatic coast of Italy that was then part of the Papal States. He was the only child of Giuseppe Rossini, a trumpeter and horn player, and his wife Anna, &quot;née&quot; Guidarini, a seamstress by trade, daughter of a baker. Giuseppe Rossini was charming but impetuous and feckless; the burden of supporting the family and raising the child fell mainly on Anna, with some help from her mother and mother-in-law. Stendhal, who published a colourful biography of Rossini in 1824, wrote:
Giuseppe was imprisoned at least twice: first in 1790 for insubordination to local authorities in a dispute about his employment as town trumpeter; and in 1799 and 1800 for republican activism and support of the troops of Napoleon against the Pope&#x27;s Austrian backers. In 1798, when Rossini was aged six, his mother began a career as a professional singer in comic opera, and for a little over a decade was a considerable success in cities including Trieste and Bologna, before her untrained voice began to fail.

In 1802 the family moved to Lugo, near Ravenna, where Rossini received a good basic education in Italian, Latin and arithmetic as well as music. He studied the horn with his father and other music with a priest, Giuseppe Malerbe, whose extensive library contained works by Haydn and Mozart, both little known in Italy at the time, but inspirational to the young Rossini. He was a quick learner, and by the age of twelve, he had composed a set of six sonatas for four stringed instruments, which were performed under the aegis of a rich patron in 1804. Two years later he was admitted to the recently opened Liceo Musicale, Bologna, initially studying singing, cello and piano, and joining the composition class soon afterwards. He wrote some substantial works while a student, including a mass and a cantata, and after two years he was invited to continue his studies. He declined the offer: the strict academic regime of the Liceo had given him a solid compositional technique, but as his biographer Richard Osborne puts it, &quot;his instinct to continue his education in the real world finally asserted itself&quot;.

While still at the Liceo, Rossini had performed in public as a singer and worked in theatres as a répétiteur and keyboard soloist. In 1810 at the request of the popular tenor Domenico Mombelli he wrote his first operatic score, a two-act operatic &quot;dramma serio&quot;, &quot;Demetrio e Polibio&quot;, to a libretto by Mombelli&#x27;s wife. It was publicly staged in 1812, after the composer&#x27;s first successes. Rossini and his parents concluded that his future lay in composing operas. The main operatic centre in northeastern Italy was Venice; under the tutelage of the composer Giovanni Morandi, a family friend, Rossini moved there in late 1810, when he was eighteen.

===First operas: 1810–1815===
Rossini&#x27;s first opera to be staged was &quot;La cambiale di matrimonio&quot;, a one-act comedy, given at the small Teatro San Moisè in November 1810. The piece was a great success, and Rossini received what then seemed to him a considerable sum: &quot;forty &quot;scudi&quot; – an amount I had never seen brought together&quot;. He later described the San Moisè as an ideal theatre for a young composer learning his craft – &quot;everything tended to facilitate the début of a novice composer&quot;: it had no chorus, and a small company of principals; its main repertoire consisted of one-act comic operas (&quot;farse&quot;), staged with modest scenery and minimal rehearsal. Rossini followed the success of his first piece with three more &quot;farse&quot; for the house: &quot;L&#x27;inganno felice&quot; (1812), &quot;La scala di seta&quot; (1812), and &quot;Il signor Bruschino&quot; (1813).

Rossini maintained his links with Bologna, where in 1811 he had a success directing Haydn&#x27;s &quot;The Seasons&quot;, and a failure with his first full-length opera, &quot;L&#x27;equivoco stravagante&quot;. He also worked for opera houses in Ferrara and Rome. In mid-1812 he received a commission from La Scala, Milan, where his two-act comedy &quot;La pietra del paragone&quot; ran for fifty-three performances, a considerable run for the time, which brought him not only financial benefits, but exemption from military service and the title of &quot;maestro di cartello&quot; – a composer whose name on advertising posters guaranteed a full house. The following year his first &quot;opera seria&quot;, &quot;Tancredi&quot;, did well at La Fenice in Venice, and even better at Ferrara, with a rewritten, tragic ending. The success of &quot;Tancredi&quot; made Rossini&#x27;s name known internationally; productions of the opera followed in London (1820) and New York (1825). Within weeks of &quot;Tancredi&quot;, Rossini had another box-office success with his comedy &quot;L&#x27;italiana in Algeri&quot;, composed in great haste and premiered in May 1813.

1814 was a less remarkable year for the rising composer, neither &quot;Il turco in Italia&quot; or &quot;Sigismondo&quot; pleasing the Milanese or Venetian public, respectively. 1815 marked an important stage in Rossini&#x27;s career. In May he moved to Naples, to take up the post of director of music for the royal theatres. These included the Teatro di San Carlo, the city&#x27;s leading opera house; its manager Domenico Barbaia was to be an important influence on the composer&#x27;s career there.

===Naples and &quot;Il barbiere&quot;: 1815–1820===

The musical establishment of Naples was not immediately welcoming to Rossini, who was seen as an intruder into its cherished operatic traditions. The city had once been the operatic capital of Europe; the memory of Cimarosa was revered and Paisiello was still living, but there were no local composers of any stature to follow them, and Rossini quickly won the public and critics round. Rossini&#x27;s first work for the San Carlo, &quot;Elisabetta, regina d&#x27;Inghilterra&quot; was a dramma per musica in two acts, in which he reused substantial sections of his earlier works, unfamiliar to the local public. The Rossini scholars Philip Gossett and Patricia Brauner write, &quot;It is as if Rossini wished to present himself to the Neapolitan public by offering a selection of the best music from operas unlikely to be revived in Naples.&quot; The new opera was received with tremendous enthusiasm, as was the Neapolitan premiere of &quot;L&#x27;italiana in Algeri&quot;, and Rossini&#x27;s position in Naples was assured.

For the first time, Rossini was able to write regularly for a resident company of first-rate singers and a fine orchestra, with adequate rehearsals, and schedules that made it unnecessary to compose in a rush to meet deadlines. Between 1815 and 1822 he composed eighteen more operas: nine for Naples and nine for opera houses in other cities. In 1816, for the Teatro Argentina in Rome, he composed the opera that was to become his best-known: &quot;Il barbiere di Siviglia&quot; (&quot;The Barber of Seville&quot;). There was already a popular opera of that title by Paisiello, and Rossini&#x27;s version was originally given the same title as its hero, &quot;Almaviva&quot;. Despite an unsuccessful opening night, with mishaps on stage and many pro-Paisiello and anti-Rossini audience members, the opera quickly became a success, and by the time of its first revival, in Bologna a few months later, it was billed by its present Italian title and it rapidly eclipsed Paisiello&#x27;s setting.

Rossini&#x27;s operas for the Teatro San Carlo were substantial, mainly serious pieces. His &quot;Otello&quot; (1816) provoked Lord Byron to write, &quot;They have been crucifying &quot;Othello&quot; into an opera: music good, but lugubrious – but as for the words!&quot; Nonetheless, the piece proved generally popular and held the stage in frequent revivals until it was overshadowed by Verdi&#x27;s version, seven decades later. Among his other works for the house were &quot;Mosè in Egitto&quot;, based on the biblical story of Moses and the Exodus from Egypt (1818), and &quot;La donna del lago&quot;, from Sir Walter Scott&#x27;s poem &quot;The Lady of the Lake&quot; (1819). For La Scala he wrote the opera semiseria &quot;La gazza ladra&quot; (1817), and for Rome his version of the Cinderella story, &quot;La Cenerentola&quot; (1817). In 1817 came the first performance of one of his operas (&quot;L&#x27;Italiana&quot;) at the Theâtre-Italien in Paris; its success led to others of his operas being staged there, and eventually to his contract in Paris from 1824 to 1830.

Rossini kept his personal life as private as possible, but he was known for his susceptibility to singers in the companies he worked with. Among his lovers in his early years were Ester Mombelli (Domenico&#x27;s daughter) and Maria Marcolini of the Bologna company. By far the most important of these relationships – both personal and professional – was with Isabella Colbran, prima donna of the Teatro San Carlo (and former mistress of Barbaia). Rossini had heard her sing in Bologna in 1807, and when he moved to Naples he wrote a succession of important roles for her in &quot;opere serie&quot;.

===Vienna and London: 1820–1824===
By the early 1820s, Rossini was beginning to tire of Naples. The failure of his operatic tragedy &quot;Ermione&quot; the previous year convinced him that he and the Neapolitan audiences had had enough of each other. An insurrection in Naples against the monarchy, though quickly crushed, unsettled Rossini; when Barbaia signed a contract to take the company to Vienna, Rossini was glad to join them, but did not reveal to Barbaia that he had no intention of returning to Naples afterwards. He travelled with Colbran, in March 1822, breaking their journey at Bologna, where they were married in the presence of his parents in a small church in Castenaso a few miles from the city. The bride was thirty-seven, the groom thirty.

In Vienna, Rossini received a hero&#x27;s welcome; his biographers describe it as &quot;unprecedentedly feverish enthusiasm&quot;, &quot;Rossini fever&quot;, and &quot;near hysteria&quot;. The authoritarian chancellor of the Austrian Empire, Metternich, liked Rossini&#x27;s music, and thought it free of all potential revolutionary or republican associations. He was therefore happy to permit the San Carlo company to perform the composer&#x27;s operas. In a three-month season they played six of them, to audiences so enthusiastic that Beethoven&#x27;s assistant, Anton Schindler, described it as &quot;an idolatrous orgy&quot;.

While in Vienna Rossini heard Beethoven&#x27;s &quot;Eroica&quot; symphony, and was so moved that he determined to meet the reclusive composer. He finally managed to do so, and later described the encounter to many people, including Eduard Hanslick and Richard Wagner. He recalled that although conversation was hampered by Beethoven&#x27;s deafness and Rossini&#x27;s ignorance of German, Beethoven made it plain that he thought Rossini&#x27;s talents were not for serious opera, and that &quot;above all&quot; he should &quot;do more &quot;Barbiere&quot;&quot; &quot;(Barbers)&quot;.

After the Vienna season Rossini returned to Castenaso to work with his librettist, Gaetano Rossi, on &quot;Semiramide&quot;, commissioned by La Fenice. It was premiered in February 1823, his last work for the Italian theatre. Colbran starred, but it was clear to everyone that her voice was in serious decline, and &quot;Semiramide&quot; ended her career in Italy. The work survived that one major disadvantage, and entered the international operatic repertory, remaining popular throughout the 19th century; in Richard Osborne&#x27;s words, it brought &quot;[Rossini&#x27;s] Italian career to a spectacular close.&quot;

In November 1823 Rossini and Colbran set off for London, where a lucrative contract had been offered. They stopped for four weeks &quot;en route&quot; in Paris. Although he was not as feverishly acclaimed by the Parisians as he had been in Vienna, he nevertheless had an exceptionally welcoming reception from the musical establishment and the public. When he attended a performance of &quot;Il barbiere&quot; at the Théâtre-Italien he was applauded, dragged onto the stage, and serenaded by the musicians. A banquet was given for him and his wife, attended by leading French composers and artists, and he found the cultural climate of Paris congenial.

At the end of the year Rossini arrived in London, where he was received and made much of by the king, George IV, although the composer was by now unimpressed by royalty and aristocracy. Rossini and Colbran had signed contracts for an opera season at the King&#x27;s Theatre in the Haymarket. Her vocal shortcomings were a serious liability, and she reluctantly retired from performing. Public opinion was not improved by Rossini&#x27;s failure to provide a new opera, as promised. The impresario Vincenzo Benelli defaulted on his contract with the composer, but this was not known to the London press and public, who blamed Rossini.

In a 2003 biography of the composer, Gaia Servadio comments that Rossini and England were not made for each other. He was prostrated by the Channel crossing and was unlikely to be enthused by the English weather or English cooking. Although his stay in London was financially rewarding – the British press reported disapprovingly that he had earned over £30,000 – he was happy to sign a contract at the French embassy in London to return to Paris, where he had felt much more at home.

===Paris and final operas: 1824–1829===

Rossini&#x27;s new, and highly remunerative, contract with the French government was negotiated under Louis XVIII, who died in September 1824, soon after Rossini&#x27;s arrival in Paris. It had been agreed that the composer would produce one grand opera for the Académie Royale de Musique and either an &quot;opera buffa&quot; or an &quot;opera semiseria&quot; for the Théâtre-Italien. He was also to help run the latter theatre and revise one of his earlier works for revival there. The death of the king and the accession of Charles X changed Rossini&#x27;s plans, and his first new work for Paris was &quot;Il viaggio a Reims&quot;, an operatic entertainment given in June 1825 to celebrate Charles&#x27;s coronation. It was Rossini&#x27;s last opera with an Italian libretto. He permitted only four performances of the piece, intending to reuse the best of the music in a less ephemeral opera. About half the score of &quot;Le comte Ory&quot; (1828) is from the earlier work.
Colbran&#x27;s enforced retirement put a strain on the Rossinis&#x27; marriage, leaving her unoccupied while he continued to be the centre of musical attention and constantly in demand. She consoled herself with what Servadio describes as &quot;a new pleasure in shopping&quot;; for Rossini, Paris offered continual gourmet delights, as his increasingly rotund shape began to reflect.

The first of the four operas Rossini wrote to French librettos were &quot;Le siège de Corinthe&quot; (1826) and &quot;Moïse et Pharaon&quot; (1827). Both were substantial reworkings of pieces written for Naples: &quot;Maometto II&quot; and &quot;Mosè in Egitto&quot;. Rossini took great care before beginning work on the first, learning to speak French and familiarising himself with traditional French operatic ways of declaiming the language. As well as dropping some of the original music that was in an ornate style unfashionable in Paris, Rossini accommodated local preferences by adding dances, hymn-like numbers and a greater role for the chorus.

Rossini&#x27;s mother, Anna, died in 1827; he had been devoted to her, and he felt her loss deeply. She and Colbran had never got on well, and Servadio suggests that after Anna died Rossini came to resent the surviving woman in his life.

In 1828 Rossini wrote &quot;Le comte Ory&quot;, his only French-language comic opera. His determination to reuse music from &quot;Il viaggio a Reims&quot; caused problems for his librettists, who had to adapt their original plot and write French words to fit existing Italian numbers, but the opera was a success, and was seen in London within six months of the Paris premiere, and in New York in 1831. The following year Rossini wrote his long-awaited French grand opera, &quot;Guillaume Tell&quot;, based on Friedrich Schiller&#x27;s 1804 play which drew on the William Tell legend.

===Early retirement: 1830–1855===
&quot;Guillaume Tell&quot; was well received. The orchestra and singers gathered outside Rossini&#x27;s house after the premiere and performed the rousing finale to the second act in his honour. The newspaper &quot;Le Globe&quot; commented that a new era of music had begun. Gaetano Donizetti remarked that the first and last acts of the opera were written by Rossini, but the middle act was written by God. The work was an undoubted success, without being a smash hit; the public took some time in getting to grips with it, and some singers found it too demanding. It nonetheless was produced abroad within months of the premiere, and there was no suspicion that it would be the composer&#x27;s last opera.
Jointly with &quot;Semiramide&quot;, &quot;Guillaume Tell&quot; is Rossini&#x27;s longest opera, at three hours and forty-five minutes, and the effort of composing it left him exhausted. Although within a year he was planning an operatic treatment of the Faust story, events and ill health overtook him. After the opening of &quot;Guillaume Tell&quot; the Rossinis had left Paris and were staying in Castenaso. Within a year events in Paris had Rossini hurrying back. Charles X was overthrown in a revolution in July 1830, and the new administration, headed by Louis Philippe I, announced radical cutbacks in government spending. Among the cuts was Rossini&#x27;s lifetime annuity, won after hard negotiation with the previous regime. Attempting to restore the annuity was one of Rossini&#x27;s reasons for returning. The other was to be with his new mistress, Olympe Pélissier. He left Colbran in Castenaso; she never returned to Paris and they never lived together again.

The reasons for Rossini&#x27;s withdrawal from opera have been continually discussed during and since his lifetime. Some have supposed that aged thirty-seven and in variable health, having negotiated a sizeable annuity from the French government, and having written thirty-nine operas, he simply planned to retire and kept to that plan. In a 1934 study of the composer, the critic Francis Toye coined the phrase &quot;The Great Renunciation&quot;, and called Rossini&#x27;s retirement a &quot;phenomenon unique in the history of music and difficult to parallel in the whole history of art&quot;:

The poet Heine compared Rossini&#x27;s retirement with Shakespeare&#x27;s withdrawal from writing: two geniuses recognising when they had accomplished the unsurpassable and not seeking to follow it. Others, then and later, suggested that Rossini had retired because of pique at the successes of Giacomo Meyerbeer and Fromental Halévy in the genre of grand opéra. Modern Rossini scholarship has generally discounted such theories, maintaining that Rossini had no intention of renouncing operatic composition, and that circumstances rather than personal choice made &quot;Guillaume Tell&quot; his last opera. Gossett and Richard Osborne suggest that illness may have been a major factor in Rossini&#x27;s retirement. From about this time, Rossini had intermittent bad health, both physical and mental. He had contracted gonorrhoea in earlier years, which later led to painful side-effects, from urethritis to arthritis; he suffered from bouts of debilitating depression, which commentators have linked to several possible causes: cyclothymia, or bipolar disorder, or reaction to his mother&#x27;s death.

For the next twenty-five years following &quot;Guillaume Tell&quot; Rossini composed little, although Gossett comments that his comparatively few compositions from the 1830s and 1840s show no falling off in musical inspiration. They include the &quot;Soirées musicales&quot; (1830–1835: a set of twelve songs for solo or duet voices and piano) and his Stabat Mater (begun in 1831 and completed in 1841). After winning his fight with the government over his annuity in 1835 Rossini left Paris and settled in Bologna. His return to Paris in 1843 for medical treatment by Jean Civiale sparked hopes that he might produce a new grand opera – it was rumoured that Eugène Scribe was preparing a libretto for him about Joan of Arc. The Opéra was moved to present a French version of &quot;Otello&quot; in 1844 which also included material from some of the composer&#x27;s earlier operas. It is unclear to what extent – if at all – Rossini was involved with this production, which was in the event poorly received. More controversial was the &quot;pasticcio&quot; opera of &quot;Robert Bruce&quot; (1846), in which Rossini, by then returned to Bologna, closely cooperated by selecting music from his past operas which had not yet been performed in Paris, notably &quot;La donna del lago&quot;. The Opéra sought to present &quot;Robert&quot; as a new Rossini opera. But although &quot;Othello&quot; could at least claim to be genuine, canonic Rossini, the historian Mark Everist notes that detractors argued that &quot;Robert&quot; was simply &quot;fake goods, and from a bygone era at that&quot;; he cites Théophile Gautier regretting that &quot;the lack of unity could have been masked by a superior performance; unfortunately the tradition of Rossini&#x27;s music was lost at the Opéra a long time ago.&quot;

The period after 1835 saw Rossini&#x27;s formal separation from his wife, who remained at Castenaso (1837), and the death of his father at the age of eighty (1839). In 1845 Colbran became seriously ill, and in September Rossini travelled to visit her; a month later she died. The following year Rossini and Pélissier were married in Bologna. The events of the Year of Revolution in 1848 led Rossini to move away from the Bologna area, where he felt threatened by insurrection, and to make Florence his base, which it remained until 1855.

By the early 1850s Rossini&#x27;s mental and physical health had deteriorated to the point where his wife and friends feared for his sanity or his life. By the middle of the decade, it was clear that he needed to return to Paris for the most advanced medical care then available. In April 1855 the Rossinis set off for their final journey from Italy to France. Rossini returned to Paris aged sixty-three and made it his home for the rest of his life.

===Sins of old age: 1855–1868===

Gossett observes that although an account of Rossini&#x27;s life between 1830 and 1855 makes depressing reading, it is &quot;no exaggeration to say that, in Paris, Rossini returned to life&quot;. He recovered his health and &quot;joie de vivre&quot;. Once settled in Paris he maintained two homes: a flat in the rue de la Chaussée-d&#x27;Antin, a smart central area, and a neo-classical villa built for him in Passy, a commune now absorbed into the city, but then semi-rural. He and his wife established a salon that became internationally famous. The first of their Saturday evening gatherings – the &quot;samedi soirs&quot; – was held in December 1858, and the last, two months before he died in 1868.

Rossini began composing again. His music from his final decade was not generally intended for public performance, and he did not usually put dates of composition on the manuscripts. Consequently, musicologists have found it difficult to give definite dates for his late works, but the first, or among the first, was the song cycle &quot;Musique anodine&quot;, dedicated to his wife and presented to her in April 1857. For their weekly salons he produced more than 150 pieces, including songs, solo piano pieces, and chamber works for many different combinations of instruments. He referred to them as his &quot;Péchés de vieillesse&quot; – &quot;sins of old age&quot;. The salons were held both at Beau Séjour – the Passy villa – and, in the winter, at the Paris flat. Such gatherings were a regular feature of Parisian life – the writer James Penrose has observed that the well-connected could easily attend different salons almost every night of the week – but the Rossinis&#x27; &quot;samedi soirs&quot; quickly became the most sought after: &quot;an invitation was the city&#x27;s highest social prize.&quot; The music, carefully chosen by Rossini, was not only his own but included works by Pergolesi, Haydn and Mozart and modern pieces by some of his guests. Among the composers who attended the salons, and sometimes performed, were Auber, Gounod, Liszt, Rubinstein, Meyerbeer, and Verdi. Rossini liked to call himself a fourth-class pianist, but the many famous pianists who attended the &quot;samedi soirs&quot; were dazzled by his playing. Violinists such as Pablo Sarasate and Joseph Joachim and the leading singers of the day were regular guests. In 1860, Wagner visited Rossini via an introduction from Rossini&#x27;s friend Edmond Michotte who some forty-five years later wrote his account of the genial conversation between the two composers.

One of Rossini&#x27;s few late works intended to be given in public was his &quot;Petite messe solennelle&quot;, first performed in 1864. In the same year Rossini was made a grand officer of the Legion of Honour by Napoleon III.

After a short illness, and an unsuccessful operation to treat colorectal cancer, Rossini died at Passy on 13 November 1868 at the age of seventy-six. He left Olympe a life interest in his estate, which after her death, ten years later, passed to the Commune of Pesaro for the establishment of a Liceo Musicale, and funded a home for retired opera singers in Paris. After a funeral service attended by more than four thousand people at the church of Sainte-Trinité, Paris, Rossini&#x27;s body was interred at the Père Lachaise Cemetery. In 1887 his remains were moved to the basilica of Santa Croce, Florence.

==Music==
===&quot;The Code Rossini&quot;===
The writer Julian Budden, noting the formulas adopted early on by Rossini in his career and consistently followed by him thereafter as regards overtures, arias, structures and ensembles, has called them &quot;the Code Rossini&quot; in a reference to the Code Napoléon, the legal system established by the French Emperor. Rossini&#x27;s overall style may indeed have been influenced more directly by the French: the historian John Rosselli suggests that French rule in Italy at the start of the 19th century meant that &quot;music had taken on new military qualities of attack, noise and speed – to be heard in Rossini.&quot; Rossini&#x27;s approach to opera was inevitably tempered by changing tastes and audience demands. The formal &quot;classicist&quot; libretti of Metastasio which had underpinned late 18th century &quot;opera seria&quot; were replaced by subjects more to the taste of the age of Romanticism, with stories demanding stronger characterisation and quicker action; a jobbing composer needed to meet these demands or fail. Rossini&#x27;s strategies met this reality. A formulaic approach was logistically indispensable for Rossini&#x27;s career, at least at the start: in the seven years 1812–1819, he wrote 27 operas, often at extremely short notice. For &quot;La Cenerentola&quot; (1817), for example, he had just over three weeks to write the music before the première.

Such pressures led to a further significant element of Rossini&#x27;s compositional procedures, not included in Budden&#x27;s &quot;Code&quot;, namely, recycling. The composer often transferred a successful overture to subsequent operas: thus the overture to &quot;La pietra del paragone&quot; was later used for the &quot;opera seria&quot; &quot;Tancredi&quot; (1813), and (in the other direction) the overture to &quot;Aureliano in Palmira&quot; (1813) ended as (and is today known as) the overture to the comedy &quot;Il barbiere di Siviglia (The Barber of Seville)&quot;. He also liberally re-employed arias and other sequences in later works. Spike Hughes notes that of the twenty-six numbers of &quot;Eduardo e Cristina&quot;, produced in Venice in 1817, nineteen were lifted from previous works. &quot;The audience ... were remarkably good-humoured  ... and asked slyly why the libretto had been changed since the last performance&quot;. Rossini expressed his disgust when the publisher Giovanni Ricordi issued a complete edition of his works in the 1850s: &quot;The same pieces will be found several times, for I thought I had the right to remove from my fiascos those pieces which seemed best, to rescue them from shipwreck ... A fiasco seemed to be good and dead, and now look they&#x27;ve resuscitated them all!&quot;

====Overtures====
Philip Gossett notes that Rossini &quot;was from the outset a consummate composer of overtures&quot;. His basic formula for these remained constant throughout his career: Gossett characterises them as &quot;sonata movements without development sections, usually preceded by a slow introduction&quot; with &quot;clear melodies, exuberant rhythms [and] simple harmonic structure&quot; and a &quot;crescendo&quot; climax. Richard Taruskin also notes that the second theme is always announced in a woodwind solo, whose &quot;catchiness&quot; &quot;etch[es] a distinct profile in the aural memory&quot;, and that the richness and inventiveness of his handling of the orchestra, even in these early works, marks the start of &quot;[t]he great nineteenth-century flowering of orchestration.&quot;

====Arias====
Rossini&#x27;s handling of arias (and duets) in &quot;cavatina&quot; style marked a development from the eighteenth-century commonplace of recitative and aria. In the words of Rosselli, in Rossini&#x27;s hands, &quot;the aria became an engine for releasing emotion&quot;. Rossini&#x27;s typical aria structure involved a lyrical introduction (&quot;cantabile&quot;) and a more intensive, brilliant, conclusion (&quot;cabaletta&quot;). This model could be adapted in various ways so as to forward the plot (as opposed to the typical eighteenth-century handling which resulted in the action coming to a halt as the requisite repeats of the &quot;da capo aria&quot; were undertaken). For example, they could be punctuated by comments from other characters (a convention known as &quot;pertichini&quot;), or the chorus could intervene between the &quot;cantabile&quot; and the &quot;cabaletta&quot; so as to fire up the soloist. If such developments were not necessarily Rossini&#x27;s own invention, he nevertheless made them his own by his expert handling of them. A landmark in this context is the &quot;cavatina&quot; &quot;Di tanti palpiti&quot; from &quot;Tancredi&quot;, which both Taruskin and Gossett (amongst others) single out as transformative, &quot;the most famous aria Rossini ever wrote&quot;, with a &quot;melody that seems to capture the melodic beauty and innocence characteristic of Italian opera.&quot; Both writers point out the typical Rossinian touch of avoiding an &quot;expected&quot; cadence in the aria by a sudden shift from the home key of F to that of A flat (see example); Taruskin notes the implicit pun, as the words talk of returning, but the music moves in a new direction. The influence was lasting; Gossett notes how the Rossinian &quot;cabaletta&quot; style continued to inform Italian opera as late as Giuseppe Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Aida&quot; (1871).

====Structure====
Such structural integration of the forms of vocal music with the dramatic development of the opera meant a sea-change from the Metastasian primacy of the aria; in Rossini&#x27;s works, solo arias progressively take up a smaller proportion of the operas, in favour of duets (also typically in &quot;cantabile-caballetta&quot; format) and ensembles.

During the late 18th century, creators of &quot;opera buffa&quot; had increasingly developed dramatic integration of the finales of each act. Finales began to &quot;spread backwards&quot;, taking an ever larger proportion of the act, taking the structure of a musically continuous chain, accompanied throughout by orchestra, of a series of sections, each with its own characteristics of speed and style, mounting to a clamorous and vigorous final scene. In his comic operas Rossini brought this technique to its peak and extended its range far beyond his predecessors. Of the finale to the first act of &quot;L&#x27;italiana in Algeri&quot;, Taruskin writes that &quot;[r]unning through almost a hundred pages of vocal score in record time, it is the most concentrated single dose of Rossini that there is.&quot;

Of greater consequence for the history of opera was Rossini&#x27;s ability to progress this technique in the genre of &quot;opera seria&quot;. Gossett in a very detailed analysis of the first-act finale of &quot;Tancredi&quot; identifies several elements in Rossini&#x27;s practice. These include the contrast of &quot;kinetic&quot; action sequences, often characterised by orchestral motifs, with &quot;static&quot; expressions of emotion, the final &quot;static&quot; section in the form of a caballetta, with all the characters joining in the final cadences. Gossett claims that it is &quot;from the time of &quot;Tancredi&quot; that the caballetta ... becomes the obligatory closing section of each musical unit in the operas of Rossini and his contemporaries.&quot;

===Early works===
With extremely few exceptions, all Rossini&#x27;s compositions before the &quot;Péchés de vieillesse&quot; of his retirement involve the human voice. His very first surviving work (apart from a single song) is however a set of string sonatas for two violins, cello and double-bass, written at the age of 12 when he had barely begun instruction in composition. Tuneful and engaging, they indicate how remote the talented child was from the influence of the advances in musical form evolved by Mozart, Haydn and Beethoven; the accent is on cantabile melody, colour, variation and virtuosity rather than transformational development. These qualities are also evident in Rossini&#x27;s early operas, especially his &quot;farse&quot; (one-act farces), rather than his more formal &quot;opere serie&quot;. Gossett notes that these early works were written at a time when &quot;[t]he deposited mantles of Cimarosa and Paisiello were unfilled&quot; – these were Rossini&#x27;s first, and increasingly appreciated, steps in trying them on. The Teatro San Moisè in Venice, where his &quot;farse&quot; was first performed, and the La Scala Theatre of Milan which premiered his two-act opera &quot;La pietra del paragone&quot; (1812), were seeking works in that tradition; Gossett notes that in these operas &quot;Rossini&#x27;s musical personality began to take shape ... many elements emerge that remain throughout his career&quot; including &quot;[a] love of sheer sound, of sharp and effective rhythms&quot;. The unusual effect employed in the overture of &quot;Il signor Bruschino&quot;, (1813) deploying violin bows tapping rhythms on music stands, is an example of such witty originality.

===Italy, 1813–1823===
The great success in Venice of the premieres of both &quot;Tancredi&quot; and the comic opera &quot;L&#x27;italiana in Algeri&quot; within a few weeks of each other (6 February 1813 and 22 May 1813 respectively) set the seal on Rossini&#x27;s reputation as the rising opera composer of his generation. From the end of 1813 to mid-1814 he was in Milan creating two new operas for La Scala, &quot;Aureliano in Palmira&quot; and &quot;Il Turco in Italia&quot;. Arsace in &quot;Aureliano&quot; was sung by the &quot;castrato&quot; Giambattista Velluti; this was the last opera role Rossini wrote for a &quot;castrato&quot; singer as the norm became to use contralto voices – another sign of change in operatic taste. Rumour had it that Rossini was displeased by Velluti&#x27;s ornamentation of his music; but in fact throughout his Italian period, up to &quot;Semiramide&quot; (1823), Rossini&#x27;s written vocal lines become increasingly florid, and this is more appropriately credited to the composer&#x27;s own changing style.

Rossini&#x27;s work in Naples contributed to this stylistic development. The city, which was the cradle of the operas of Cimarosa and Paisiello, had been slow to acknowledge the composer from Pesaro, but Domenico Barbaia invited him in 1815 on a seven-year contract to manage his theatres and compose operas. For the first time, Rossini was able to work over a long period with a company of musicians and singers, including amongst the latter Isabella Colbran, Andrea Nozzari, Giovanni David and others, who as Gossett notes &quot;all specialized in florid singing&quot; and &quot;whose vocal talents left an indelible and not wholly positive mark on Rossini&#x27;s style&quot;. Rossini&#x27;s first operas for Naples, &quot;Elisabetta, regina d&#x27;Inghilterra&quot; and &quot;La gazzetta&quot; were both largely recycled from earlier works, but &quot;Otello&quot; (1816) is marked not only by its virtuoso vocal lines but by its masterfully integrated last act, with its drama underlined by melody, orchestration and tonal colour; here, in Gossett&#x27;s opinion &quot;Rossini came of age as a dramatic artist.&quot; He further comments:

By now, Rossini&#x27;s career was arousing interest across Europe. Others came to Italy to study the revival of Italian opera and used its lessons to advance themselves; amongst these was the Berlin-born Giacomo Meyerbeer who arrived in Italy in 1816, a year after Rossini&#x27;s establishment at Naples, and lived and worked there until following him to Paris in 1825; he used one of Rossini&#x27;s librettists, Gaetano Rossi, for five of his seven Italian operas, which were produced at Turin, Venice and Milan. In a letter to his brother of September 1818, he includes a detailed critique of &quot;Otello&quot; from the point of view of a non-Italian informed observer. He is scathing about the self-borrowings in the first two acts, but concedes that the third act &quot;so firmly established Rossini&#x27;s reputation in Venice that even a thousand follies could not rob him of it. But this act is divinely beautiful, and what is so strange is that [its] beauties ... are blatantly un-Rossinian: outstanding, even passionate recitatives, mysterious accompaniments, lots of local colour.&quot;

Rossini&#x27;s contract did not prevent him from undertaking other commissions, and before &quot;Otello, Il barbiere di Siviglia&quot;, a grand culmination of the &quot;opera buffa&quot; tradition, had been premiered in Rome (February 1816). Richard Osborne catalogues its excellencies:

Beyond the physical impact of ... Figaro&#x27;s &quot;Largo al factotum&quot;, there is Rossini&#x27;s ear for vocal and instrumental timbres of a peculiar astringency and brilliance, his quick-witted word-setting, and his mastery of large musical forms with their often brilliant and explosive internal variations. Add to that what Verdi called the opera&#x27;s &quot;abundance of true musical ideas&quot;, and the reasons for the work&#x27;s longer-term emergence as Rossini&#x27;s most popular &quot;opera buffa&quot; are not hard to find.

Apart from &quot;La Cenerentola&quot; (Rome, 1817), and the &quot;pen-and-ink sketch&quot; &quot;farsa&quot; &quot;Adina&quot; (1818, not performed until 1826), Rossini&#x27;s other works during his contract with Naples were all in the &quot;opera seria&quot; tradition. Amongst the most notable of these, all containing virtuoso singing roles, were &quot;Mosè in Egitto&quot; (1818), &quot;La donna del lago&quot; (1819), &quot;Maometto II&quot; (1820) all staged in Naples, and &quot;Semiramide&quot;, his last opera written for Italy, staged at La Fenice in Venice in 1823. The three versions of the opera semiseria &quot;Matilde di Shabran&quot; were written in 1821/1822. Both &quot;Mosè&quot; and &quot;Maometto II&quot; were later to undergo significant reconstruction in Paris (see below).

===France, 1824–1829===
Already in 1818, Meyerbeer had heard rumours that Rossini was seeking a lucrative appointment at the Paris Opera – &quot;Should [his proposals] be accepted, he will go to the French capital, and we will perhaps experience curious things.&quot; Some six years were to pass before this prophecy came true.

In 1824 Rossini, under a contract with the French government, became director of the Théâtre-Italien in Paris, where he introduced Meyerbeer&#x27;s opera &quot;Il crociato in Egitto&quot;, and for which he wrote &quot;Il viaggio a Reims&quot; to celebrate the coronation of Charles X (1825). This was his last opera to an Italian libretto, and was later cannibalised to create his first French opera, &quot;Le comte Ory&quot; (1828). A new contract in 1826 meant he could concentrate on productions at the Opéra and to this end he substantially revised &quot;Maometto II&quot; as &quot;Le siège de Corinthe&quot; (1826) and &quot;Mosé&quot; as &quot;Moïse et Pharaon&quot; (1827). Meeting French taste, the works are extended (each by one act), the vocal lines in the revisions are less florid and the dramatic structure is enhanced, with the proportion of arias reduced. One of the most striking additions was the chorus at the end of Act III of &quot;Moïse&quot;, with a &quot;crescendo&quot; repetition of a diatonic ascending bass line, rising first by a minor third, then by a major third, at each appearance, and a descending chromatic top line, which roused the excitement of audiences.

Rossini&#x27;s government contract required him to create at least one new &quot;grand opėra&quot;, and Rossini settled on the story of William Tell, working closely with the librettist Étienne de Jouy. The story in particular enabled him to indulge &quot;an underlying interest in the related genres of folk music, pastoral and the picturesque&quot;. This becomes clear from the overture, which is explicitly programmatic in describing weather, scenery and action, and presents a version of the &quot;Ranz des Vaches&quot;, the Swiss cowherd&#x27;s call, which &quot;undergoes a number of transformations during the opera&quot; and gives it in Richard Osborne&#x27;s opinion &quot;something of the character of a leitmotif&quot;. In the opinion of the music historian Benjamin Walton, Rossini &quot;saturate[s] the work with local colour to such a degree that there is room for little else.&quot; Thus, the role of the soloists is significantly reduced compared to other Rossini operas, the hero not even having an aria of his own, whilst the chorus of the Swiss people is consistently in the musical and dramatic foregrounds.

&quot;Guillaume Tell&quot; premiered in August 1829. Rossini also provided for the Opéra a shorter, three-act version, which incorporated the &quot;pas redoublé&quot; (quick march) final section of the overture in its finale; it was first performed in 1831 and became the basis of the Opéra&#x27;s future productions. &quot;Tell&quot; was very successful from the start and was frequently revived – in 1868 the composer was present at its 500th performance at the Opéra. The &quot;Globe&quot; had reported enthusiastically at its opening that &quot;a new epoch has opened not only for French opera, but for dramatic music elsewhere&quot;. This was an era, it transpired, in which Rossini was not to participate.

===Withdrawal, 1830–1868===
Rossini&#x27;s contract required him to provide five new works for the Opéra over 10 years. After the première of &quot;Tell&quot; he was already considering some opera subjects, including Goethe&#x27;s &quot;Faust&quot;, but the only significant works he completed before abandoning Paris in 1836 were the Stabat Mater, written for a private commission in 1831 (later completed and published in 1841), and the collection of salon vocal music &quot;Soirées musicales&quot; published in 1835. Living in Bologna, he occupied himself teaching singing at the Liceo Musicale, and also created a &quot;pasticcio&quot; of &quot;Tell&quot;, &quot;Rodolfo di Sterlinga&quot;, for the benefit of the singer , for which Giuseppe Verdi provided some new arias. Continuing demand in Paris resulted in the production of a &quot;new&quot; French version of &quot;Otello&quot; in 1844 (with which Rossini was not involved) and a &quot;new&quot; opera &quot;Robert Bruce&quot; for which Rossini cooperated with Louis Niedermeyer and others to recast music for &quot;La donna del lago&quot; and others of his works which were little-known in Paris to fit a new libretto. The success of both of these was qualified, to say the least.

Not until Rossini returned to Paris in 1855 were there signs of a revival of his musical spirits. A stream of pieces, for voices, choir, piano, and chamber ensembles, written for his soirées, the &quot;Péchés de vieillesse (Sins of old age)&quot; were issued in thirteen volumes from 1857 to 1868; of these, volumes 4 to 8 comprise &quot;56 semi-comical piano pieces ... dedicated to pianists of the fourth class, to which I have the honour of belonging.&quot; These include a mock funeral march, &quot;Marche et reminiscences pour mon dernier voyage (March and reminiscences for my last journey).&quot; Gossett writes of the &quot;Péchés&quot; &quot;Their historical position remains to be assessed but it seems likely that their effect, direct or indirect, on composers like Camille Saint-Saëns and Erik Satie was significant.&quot;

The most substantial work of Rossini&#x27;s last decade, the &quot;Petite messe solennelle&quot; (1863), was written for small forces (originally voices, two pianos and harmonium), and therefore unsuited to concert hall performance; and as it included women&#x27;s voices it was unacceptable for church performances at the time. For these reasons, Richard Osborne suggests, the piece has been somewhat overlooked among Rossini&#x27;s compositions. It is neither especially &quot;petite&quot; (little) nor entirely &quot;solennelle&quot; (solemn), but is notable for its grace, counterpoint and melody. At the end of the manuscript, the composer wrote:

Dear God, here it is finished, this poor little Mass. Is it sacred music I have written, or damned music? I was born for opera buffa, as you know well. A little technique, a little heart, that&#x27;s all. Be blessed then, and grant me Paradise.

==Influence and legacy==
The popularity of Rossini&#x27;s melodies led many contemporary virtuosi to create piano transcriptions or fantasies based on them. Examples include Sigismond Thalberg&#x27;s fantasy on themes from &quot;Moïse&quot;, the sets of variations on &quot;Non più mesta&quot; from &quot;La Cenerentola&quot; by Henri Herz, Frédéric Chopin, Franz Hünten, Anton Diabelli and Friedrich Burgmüller, and Liszt&#x27;s transcriptions of the &quot;William Tell&quot; overture (1838) and the &quot;Soirées musicales&quot;.

The continuing popularity of his comic operas (and the decline in staging his &quot;opere serie&quot;), the overthrow of the singing and staging styles of his period, and the emerging concept of the composer as a &quot;creative artist&quot; rather than a craftsman, diminished and distorted Rossini&#x27;s place in music history even though the forms of Italian opera continued up to the period of verismo to be indebted to his innovations. Rossini&#x27;s status amongst his contemporary Italian composers is indicated by the &quot;Messa per Rossini&quot;, a project initiated by Verdi within a few days of Rossini&#x27;s death, which he and a dozen other composers created in collaboration.

If Rossini&#x27;s principal legacy to Italian opera was in vocal forms and dramatic structure for serious opera, his legacy to French opera was to provide a bridge from opera buffa to the development of &quot;opéra comique&quot; (and thence, via Jacques Offenbach&#x27;s &quot;opéras bouffes&quot; to the genre of operetta). &quot;Opéras comiques&quot; showing a debt to Rossini&#x27;s style include François-Adrien Boieldieu&#x27;s &quot;La dame blanche&quot; (1825) and Daniel Auber&#x27;s &quot;Fra Diavolo&quot; (1830), as well as works by Ferdinand Hérold, Adolphe Adam and Fromental Halévy. Critical of Rossini&#x27;s style was Hector Berlioz, who wrote of his &quot;melodic cynicism, his contempt for dramatic and good sense, his endless repetition of a single form of cadence, his eternal puerile crescendo and his brutal bass drum&quot;.

It was perhaps inevitable that the formidable reputation which Rossini had built in his lifetime would fade thereafter. In 1886, less than twenty years after the composer&#x27;s death, Bernard Shaw wrote: &quot;The once universal Rossini, whose &quot;Semiramide&quot; appeared to our greener grandfathers a Ninevesque wonder, came at last to be no longer looked upon as a serious musician.&quot; In an 1877 review of &quot;Il barbiere&quot;, he noted that Adelina Patti sang as an encore in the lesson scene &quot;Home, Sweet Home&quot; but that &quot;the opera proved so intolerably wearisome that some of her audience had already displayed their appreciation of the sentiment of the ballad in the most practical way.&quot;

In the early 20th century Rossini received tributes from both Ottorino Respighi, who had orchestrated excerpts from the &quot;Péchés de viellesse&quot; both in his ballet &quot;la boutique fantasque&quot; (1918) and in his 1925 suite &quot;Rossiniana&quot;, and from Benjamin Britten, who adapted music by Rossini for two suites, &quot;Soirées musicales&quot; (Op. 9) in 1937 and &quot;Matinées musicales&quot; (Op. 24) in 1941. Richard Osborne singles out the three-volume biography of Rossini by Giuseppe Radiciotti (1927–1929) as an important turning point towards positive appreciation, which may also have been assisted by the trend of neoclassicism in music. A firm re-evaluation of Rossini&#x27;s significance began only later in the 20th century in the light of study, and the creation of critical editions, of his works. A prime mover in these developments was the &quot;Fondazione G. Rossini&quot; which was created by the city of Pesaro in 1940 using the funds which had been left to the city by the composer. Since 1980 the &quot;Fondazione&quot; has supported the annual Rossini Opera Festival in Pesaro.

In the 21st century, the Rossini repertoire of opera houses around the world remains dominated by &quot;Il barbiere&quot;, &quot;La Cenerentola&quot; being the second most popular. Several other operas are regularly produced, including &quot;Le comte Ory&quot;, &quot;La donna del lago&quot;, &quot;La gazza ladra&quot;, &quot;Guillaume Tell&quot;, &quot;L&#x27;italiana in Algeri&quot;, &quot;La scala di seta&quot;, &quot;Il turco in Italia&quot; and &quot;Il viaggio a Reims&quot;. Other Rossini pieces in the current international repertory, given from time to time, include &quot;Adina&quot;, &quot;Armida&quot;, &quot;Elisabetta regina d&#x27;Inghilterra&quot;, &quot;Ermione&quot;, &quot;Mosé in Egitto&quot; and &quot;Tancredi&quot;. The Rossini in Wildbad festival specialises in producing the rarer works. The Operabase performance-listing website records 2,319 performances of 532 productions of Rossini operas in 255 venues across the world in the three years 2017–2019. All of Rossini&#x27;s operas have been recorded.

<text>Gibberish, also known as jibber-jabber or gobbledygook, is speech that is (or appears to be) nonsense: ranging across speech sounds that are not actual words, pseudowords, language games and specialized jargon that seems nonsensical to outsiders.

&quot;Gibberish&quot; is also used as an imprecation to denigrate or tar ideas or opinions the user disagrees with or finds irksome, a rough equivalent of &quot;nonsense&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;balderdash&quot;, or &quot;&quot;. The implication is that the criticized expression or proposition lacks substance or congruence, as opposed to being a differing view.

The related word &quot;jibber-jabber&quot; refers to rapid talk that is difficult to understand.

==Etymology==
The etymology of &quot;gibberish&quot; is uncertain. The term was seen in English in the early 16th century. It is generally thought to be an onomatopoeia imitative of speech, similar to the words &quot;jabber&quot; (to talk rapidly) and &quot;gibber&quot; (to speak inarticulately).

It may originate from the word &quot;&quot;, which is the Angloromani variant of the Romani language word meaning &quot;language&quot; or &quot;tongue&quot;. To non-speakers, the Anglo-Romany dialect could sound like English mixed with nonsense words, and if those seemingly nonsensical words are referred to as &quot;jib&quot; then the term &quot;gibberish&quot; could be derived as a descriptor for nonsensical speech.

Samuel Johnson, in &quot;A Dictionary of the English Language&quot;, published in 1755, wrote that the word gibberish &quot;is probably derived from the chymical cant, and originally implied the jargon of Geber and his tribe.&quot; The theory was that &quot;gibberish&quot; came from the name of a famous 8th century Muslim alchemist, Jābir ibn Hayyān, whose name was Latinized as &quot;Geber&quot;. Thus, &quot;gibberish&quot; was a reference to the incomprehensible technical jargon and allegorical coded language used by Jabir and other alchemists. After 1818, editors of Johnson&#x27;s Dictionary rejected that origin theory.

A discredited alternative theory asserts that it is derived from the Irish word &quot;gob&quot; or &quot;gab&quot; (&quot;mouth&quot;) or from the Irish phrase &quot;Geab ar ais&quot; (&quot;back talk, backward chat&quot;). The latter Irish etymology was suggested by Daniel Cassidy, whose work has been criticised by linguists and scholars. The terms &quot;geab&quot; and &quot;geabaire&quot; are certainly Irish words, but the phrase &quot;geab ar ais&quot; does not exist, and the word &quot;gibberish&quot; exists as a loan-word in Irish as &quot;gibiris&quot;.

The term &quot;gobbledygook&quot; was coined by Maury Maverick, a former congressman from Texas and former mayor of San Antonio. When Maverick was chairman of the Smaller War Plants Corporation during World War II, he sent a memorandum that said: &quot;Be short and use plain English. ... Stay off gobbledygook language.&quot; Maverick defined &quot;gobbledygook&quot; as &quot;talk or writing which is long, pompous, vague, involved, usually with Latinized words.&quot; The allusion was to a turkey, &quot;always gobbledygobbling and strutting with ridiculous pomposity.&quot;

==Use==
===Gobbledygook===
The term &quot;gobbledygook&quot; has a long history of use in politics to deride deliberately obscure statements and complicated but ineffective explanations. The following are a few examples:

* Richard Nixon&#x27;s Oval Office tape from June 14, 1971, showed H. R. Haldeman describing a situation to Nixon as &quot;... a bunch of gobbledygook. But out of the gobbledygook comes a very clear thing: You can&#x27;t trust the government; you can&#x27;t believe what they say.&quot;

* President Ronald Reagan explained tax law revisions in an address to the nation with the word, May 28, 1985, saying that &quot;most didn’t improve the system; they made it more like Washington itself: Complicated, unfair, cluttered with gobbledygook and loopholes, designed for those with the power and influence to hire high-priced legal and tax advisers.&quot;

* Supreme Court of the United States justice John Roberts dismissed quantitative sociological reasoning as &quot;gobbledygook&quot; in 2017, when arguing against using any mathematical test for gerrymandering.

* Michael Shanks, former chairman to the National Consumer Council of Great Britain, characterized professional gobbledygook as sloppy jargon intended to confuse nonspecialists: &quot;&#x27;Gobbledygook&#x27; may indicate a failure to think clearly, a contempt for one&#x27;s clients, or more probably a mixture of both. A system that can&#x27;t or won&#x27;t communicate is not a safe basis for a democracy.&quot;

===In acting===
Using gibberish whilst acting can be used as an improvisation exercise in theatre arts education. 
===In song===
The Italian musical artist Adriano Celentano wrote and performed the song &quot;Prisencolinensinainciusol&quot; in gibberish as an intentional mimic of the sound of English to those who are not fluent in the language.

Mary Poppins features a song called &quot;supercalifragilisticexpialidocious,&quot; a nonsense word whose only purpose is to be the longest word in English, though it is not.

==Other terms and usage==

The terms &quot;officialese&quot; or &quot;bureaucratese&quot; refer to language used by officials or authorities. &quot;Legalese&quot; is a closely related concept, referring to language used by lawyers, legislators, and others involved with the law. The language used in these fields may contain complex sentences and specialized jargon or buzzwords, making it difficult for those outside the field to understand. Speakers or writers of officialese or legalese may recognize that it is confusing or even meaningless to outsiders, but view its use as appropriate within their organization or group.

Bafflegab is a synonym, a slang term referring to confusing or a generally unintelligible use of jargon.

<doc id="12408" wikidata="Q272082" url="?curid=12408" title="Gnaeus Julius Agricola">
<text>Gnaeus Julius Agricola (; 13 June 40 – 23 August 93) was a Roman general and politician responsible for much of the Roman conquest of Britain. Born to a political family of senatorial rank, Agricola began his military career as a military tribune under governor Gaius Suetonius Paulinus. In his subsequent career, he served in a variety of political positions in Rome. In 64, he was appointed quaestor in Asia province. Two years later, he was appointed Plebeian Tribune, and in 68, he was made praetor. During the Year of the Four Emperors in 69, he supported Vespasian, general of the Syrian army, in his bid for the throne.

When Vespasian became emperor, Agricola was made a patrician and appointed governor of Gallia Aquitania. In 77, he was made consul and governor of Britannia. As governor, he completed the conquest of what is today Wales and northern England, and led his army to the far north of Scotland, establishing forts across much of the lowlands. In 85, Agricola was recalled from Britain after an unusually lengthy service by Emperor Domitian. After his return, he retired from military and public life and died in 93. Most of what is known about Agricola and his governorship was written in the &quot;De vita et moribus Iulii Agricolae&quot;, a primary source, written by Tacitus, Agricola&#x27;s son-in-law, and detailed archaeological evidence from northern Britain.

==Early life==
Agricola was born in the &quot;colonia&quot; of Forum Julii, Gallia Narbonensis (now Fréjus, France). Agricola&#x27;s parents were from noted political families of senatorial rank in Roman Gaul. Both of his grandfathers served as imperial governors. His father, Lucius Julius Graecinus, was a &quot;praetor&quot; and had become a member of the Roman Senate in the year of Agricola&#x27;s birth. Graecinus had become distinguished by his interest in philosophy. Between August 40 and January 41, the emperor Caligula ordered his death, because he refused to prosecute the emperor&#x27;s second cousin Marcus Junius Silanus.

His mother was Julia Procilla. The Roman historian Tacitus describes her as &quot;a lady of singular virtue&quot; who had a fond affection for her son. Agricola was educated in Massilia (Marseille), and showed what was considered to be an unhealthy interest in philosophy.

==Political career==
He began his career in Roman public life as a military tribune, and served in Britain under Gaius Suetonius Paulinus from 58 to 62. He was probably attached to the &quot;Legio II Augusta&quot;, but was chosen to serve on Suetonius&#x27;s staff and thus almost certainly participated in the suppression of Boudica&#x27;s uprising in 61.

Returning from Britain to Rome in 62, he married Domitia Decidiana, a woman of noble birth. Their first child was a son. Agricola was appointed as &quot;quaestor&quot; in 64, which he served in the province of Asia under the corrupt proconsul Lucius Salvius Otho Titianus. While he was there, his daughter, Julia Agricola, was born, but his son died shortly afterwards. He was tribune of the plebs in 66 and &quot;praetor&quot; in June 68, during which time he was ordered by the Governor of Spain Galba to take an inventory of the temple treasures.

During that time, the emperor Nero was declared a public enemy by the Senate and committed suicide, and the period of civil war known as the Year of the Four Emperors began. Galba succeeded Nero, but was murdered in early 69 by Otho, who took the throne. Agricola&#x27;s mother was murdered on her estate in Liguria by Otho&#x27;s marauding fleet. Hearing of Vespasian&#x27;s bid for the empire, Agricola immediately gave him his support. Otho meanwhile committed suicide after being defeated by Vitellius.

After Vespasian had established himself as emperor, Agricola was appointed to the command of the &quot;Legio XX Valeria Victrix&quot;, stationed in Britain, in place of Marcus Roscius Coelius, who had stirred up a mutiny against the governor, Marcus Vettius Bolanus. Britain had revolted during the year of civil war, and Bolanus was a mild governor. Agricola reimposed discipline on the legion and helped to consolidate Roman rule. In 71, Bolanus was replaced by a more aggressive governor, Quintus Petillius Cerialis, and Agricola was able to display his talents as a commander in campaigns against the Brigantes in northern England.

When his command ended in 73, Agricola was enrolled as a patrician and appointed to govern Gallia Aquitania. There he stayed for almost three years. In 76 or 77, he was recalled to Rome and appointed suffect consul, and betrothed his daughter to Tacitus. The following year, Tacitus and Julia married; Agricola was appointed to the College of Pontiffs, and returned to Britain for a third time, as its governor (&quot;Legatus Augusti pro praetore&quot;).

==Governor of Britain==

Arriving in midsummer of 77, Agricola discovered that the Ordovices of north Wales had virtually destroyed the Roman cavalry stationed in their territory. He immediately moved against them and defeated them. His campaign then moved onto Anglesey where he subjugated the entire island. Almost two decades earlier, Governor Gaius Suetonius Paulinus had attempted the same but Roman forces had to withdraw in 60 CE because of the outbreak of the Boudican rebellion. 

Agricola also expanded Roman rule north into Caledonia (modern Scotland). In the summer of 79, he pushed his armies to the estuary of the river Taus, usually interpreted as the Firth of Tay, virtually unchallenged, and established some forts. Though their location is left unspecified, the close dating of the fort at Elginhaugh in Midlothian makes it a possible candidate. He established himself as a good administrator by reforming the widely corrupt corn levy as well as through his military successes. He introduced Romanising measures, encouraging communities to build towns on the Roman model and gave a Roman education to sons of native nobility; albeit, as Tacitus notes, for the cynical reason of pacifying the aggressive tribes in Britannia for the servitude of Rome.

=== Hibernia===
In 81, Agricola &quot;crossed in the first ship&quot; and defeated peoples unknown to the Romans until then. Tacitus, in Chapter 24 of &quot;Agricola&quot;, does not tell us what body of water he crossed. Modern scholarship favours either the Firth of Clyde or Firth of Forth. Tacitus also mentions Hibernia, so southwest Scotland is perhaps to be preferred. The text of the &quot;Agricola&quot; has been amended here to record the Romans &quot;crossing into trackless wastes&quot;, referring to the wilds of the Galloway peninsula. Agricola fortified the coast facing Ireland, and Tacitus recalls that his father-in-law often claimed the island could be conquered with a single legion and auxiliaries. He had given refuge to an exiled Irish king whom he hoped he might use as the excuse for conquest. This conquest never happened, but some historians believe the crossing referred to was in fact a small-scale exploratory or punitive expedition to Ireland, though no Roman camps have been identified to confirm such a suggestion.

Irish legend provides a striking parallel. Tuathal Teachtmhar, a legendary High King, is said to have been exiled from Ireland as a boy, and to have returned from Britain at the head of an army to claim the throne. The traditional date of his return is between 76 and 80, and archaeology has found Roman or Romano-British artefacts in several sites associated with Tuathal.

===The invasion of Caledonia (Scotland)===
The following year, Agricola raised a fleet and encircled the tribes beyond the Forth, and the Caledonians rose in great numbers against him. They attacked the camp of the &quot;Legio IX Hispana&quot; at night, but Agricola sent in his cavalry and they were put to flight. The Romans responded by pushing further north. Another son was born to Agricola this year, but died before his first birthday.

In the summer of 83, Agricola faced the massed armies of the Caledonians, led by Calgacus, at the Battle of Mons Graupius. Tacitus estimates their numbers at more than 30,000. Agricola put his auxiliaries in the front line, keeping the legions in reserve, and relied on close-quarters fighting to make the Caledonians&#x27; unpointed slashing swords useless as they were unable to swing them properly or utilise thrusting attacks. Even though the Caledonians were put to rout and therefore lost this battle, two thirds of their army managed to escape and hide in the Highlands or the &quot;trackless wilds&quot; as Tacitus calls them. Battle casualties were estimated by Tacitus to be about 10,000 on the Caledonian side and 360 on the Roman side.

A number of authors have reckoned the battle to have occurred in the Grampian Mounth within sight of the North Sea. In particular, Roy, Surenne, Watt, Hogan and others have advanced notions that the site of the battle may have been Kempstone Hill, Megray Hill or other knolls near the Raedykes Roman camp; these points of high ground are proximate to the Elsick Mounth, an ancient trackway used by Romans and Caledonians for military manoeuvres. However, following the discovery of the Roman camp at Durno in 1975, most scholars now believe that the battle took place on the ground around Bennachie in Aberdeenshire.

Satisfied with his victory, Agricola extracted hostages from the Caledonian tribes. He may have marched his army to the northern coast of Britain, as evidenced by the probable discovery of a Roman fort at Cawdor (near Inverness).

He also instructed the prefect of the fleet to sail around the north coast, confirming (allegedly for the first time) that Britain was in fact an island.

=== Findings ===
In 2019, GUARD Archaeology team led by Iraia Arabaolaza uncovered a marching camp dating to the 1st century AD in Ayr, used by Roman legions during the invasion of Roman General Agricola. According to Arabaolaza, the fire pits were split 30 meters apart into two parallel lines. The findings also included clay-domed ovens and 26 fire pits dated to between 77- 86 AD and 90 AD loaded with burnt material and charcoal contents. Archaeologists suggested that this site had been chosen as a strategic location for the Roman conquest of Ayrshire.

==Later years==
Agricola was recalled from Britain in 85, after an unusually long tenure as governor. Tacitus claims Domitian ordered his recall because Agricola&#x27;s successes outshone the emperor&#x27;s own modest victories in Germany. He re-entered Rome unobtrusively, reporting as ordered to the palace at night. 

The relationship between Agricola and the emperor is unclear; on the one hand, Agricola was awarded triumphal decorations and a statue (the highest military honours apart from an actual triumph); on the other, Agricola never again held a civil or military post, in spite of his experience and renown. He was offered the governorship of the province of Africa, but declined it, whether due to ill health or (as Tacitus claims) the machinations of Domitian.

In 93, Agricola died on his family estates in Gallia Narbonensis aged fifty-three. Rumours circulated attributing the death to a poison administered by the emperor Domitian, but no positive evidence for this was ever produced.

<doc id="12417" wikidata="Q422462" url="?curid=12417" title="Guanosine">
<text>Guanosine (symbol G or Guo) is a purine nucleoside comprising guanine attached to a ribose (ribofuranose) ring via a β-N9-glycosidic bond. Guanosine can be phosphorylated to become guanosine monophosphate (GMP), cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), guanosine diphosphate (GDP), and guanosine triphosphate (GTP). These forms play important roles in various biochemical processes such as synthesis of nucleic acids and proteins, photosynthesis, muscle contraction, and intracellular signal transduction (cGMP). When guanine is attached by its N9 nitrogen to the C1 carbon of a deoxyribose ring it is known as deoxyguanosine.

==Physical and chemical properties==
Guanosine is a white, crystalline powder with no odor and mild saline taste.
It is very soluble in acetic acid, slightly soluble in water, insoluble in ethanol, diethyl ether, benzene and chloroform.

==Functions==
Guanosine is required for an RNA splicing reaction in mRNA, when a &quot;self-splicing&quot; intron removes itself from the mRNA message by cutting at both ends, re-ligating, and leaving just the exons on either side to be translated into protein.
==Uses==
The antiviral drug acyclovir, often used in herpes treatment, and the anti-HIV drug abacavir, are structurally similar to guanosine. Guanosine was also used to make regadenoson.

==Sources==
Guanosine can be found in pancreas, clover, coffee plant, and pollen of pines.

<doc id="12420" wikidata="Q598840" url="?curid=12420" title="Gödel's ontological proof">
<text>Gödel&#x27;s ontological proof is a formal argument by the mathematician Kurt Gödel (1906–1978) for the existence of God. The argument is in a line of development that goes back to Anselm of Canterbury (1033–1109). St. Anselm&#x27;s ontological argument, in its most succinct form, is as follows: &quot;God, by definition, is that for which no greater can be conceived. God exists in the understanding. If God exists in the understanding, we could imagine Him to be greater by existing in reality. Therefore, God must exist.&quot; A more elaborate version was given by Gottfried Leibniz (1646–1716); this is the version that Gödel studied and attempted to clarify with his ontological argument.

The argument uses modal logic, which deals with statements about what is &quot;necessarily&quot; true or &quot;possibly&quot; true. From the axioms that a property can only be positive if not-having-it is not positive, and that properties implied by a positive property must all also be themselves positive, it concludes that (since positive properties do not involve contradiction) for any positive property, there is possibly a being that instantiates it. It defines God as the being instantiating all positive properties. After defining what it means for a property to be &quot;the essence&quot; of something (the one property that necessarily implies all its other properties), it concludes that God&#x27;s instantiation of all positive properties must be the essence of God. After defining a property of &quot;necessary existence&quot; and taking it as an axiom that it is positive, the argument concludes that, since God must have this property, God must exist necessarily.

== History ==
Gödel left a fourteen-point outline of his philosophical beliefs in his papers. Points relevant to the ontological proof include:
:4. There are other worlds and rational beings of a different and higher kind.
:5. The world in which we live is not the only one in which we shall live or have lived.
:13. There is a scientific (exact) philosophy and theology, which deals with concepts of the highest abstractness; and this is also most highly fruitful for science.
:14. Religions are, for the most part, bad—but religion is not.

The first version of the ontological proof in Gödel&#x27;s papers is dated &quot;around 1941&quot;. Gödel is not known to have told anyone about his work on the proof until 1970, when he thought he was dying. In February, he allowed Dana Scott to copy out a version of the proof, which circulated privately. In August 1970, Gödel told Oskar Morgenstern that he was &quot;satisfied&quot; with the proof, but Morgenstern recorded in his diary entry for 29 August 1970, that Gödel would not publish because he was afraid that others might think &quot;that he actually believes in God, whereas he is only engaged in a logical investigation (that is, in showing that such a proof with classical assumptions (completeness, etc.) correspondingly axiomatized, is possible).&quot; Gödel died January 14, 1978. Another version, slightly different from Scott&#x27;s, was found in his papers. It was finally published, together with Scott&#x27;s version, in 1987.

In letters to his mother, who was not a churchgoer and had raised Kurt and his brother as freethinkers, Gödel argued at length for a belief in an afterlife. He did the same in an interview with a skeptical Hao Wang, who said: &quot;I expressed my doubts as G spoke [...] Gödel smiled as he replied to my questions, obviously aware that his answers were not convincing me.&quot; Wang reports that Gödel&#x27;s wife, Adele, two days after Gödel&#x27;s death, told Wang that &quot;Gödel, although he did not go to church, was religious and read the Bible in bed every Sunday morning.&quot; In an unmailed answer to a questionnaire, Gödel described his religion as &quot;baptized Lutheran (but not member of any religious congregation). My belief is &quot;theistic&quot;, not pantheistic, following Leibniz rather than Spinoza.&quot;

==Outline==

The proof uses modal logic, which distinguishes between &quot;necessary&quot; truths and &quot;contingent&quot; truths. In the most common semantics for modal logic, many &quot;possible worlds&quot; are considered. A truth is &quot;necessary&quot; if it is true in all possible worlds. By contrast, if a statement happens to be true in our world, but is false in another world, then it is a &quot;contingent&quot; truth. A statement that is true in some world (not necessarily our own) is called a &quot;possible&quot; truth.

Furthermore, the proof uses higher-order (modal) logic because the definition of God employs an explicit quantification over properties.

First, Gödel axiomatizes the notion of a &quot;positive property&quot;: for each property &quot;φ&quot;, either &quot;φ&quot; or its negation ¬&quot;φ&quot; must be positive, but not both (axiom 2). If a positive property &quot;φ&quot; implies a property &quot;ψ&quot; in each possible world, then &quot;ψ&quot; is positive, too (axiom 1). Gödel then argues that each positive property is &quot;possibly exemplified&quot;, i.e. applies at least to some object in some world (theorem 1). Defining an object to be Godlike if it has all positive properties (definition 1), and requiring that property to be positive itself (axiom 3), Gödel shows that in &quot;some&quot; possible world a Godlike object exists (theorem 2), called &quot;God&quot; in the following. Gödel proceeds to prove that a Godlike object exists in &quot;every&quot; possible world.

To this end, he defines &quot;essences&quot;: if &quot;x&quot; is an object in some world, then a property &quot;φ&quot; is said to be an essence of &quot;x&quot; if &quot;φ&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) is true in that world and if &quot;φ&quot; necessarily entails all other properties that &quot;x&quot; has in that world (definition 2). Requiring positive properties being positive in every possible world (axiom 4), Gödel can show that Godlikeness is an essence of a Godlike object (theorem 3). Now, &quot;x&quot; is said to &quot;exist necessarily&quot; if, for every essence &quot;φ&quot; of &quot;x&quot;, there is an element &quot;y&quot; with property &quot;φ&quot; in every possible world (definition 3). Axiom 5 requires necessary existence to be a positive property.

Hence, it must follow from Godlikeness. Moreover, Godlikeness is an essence of God, since it entails all positive properties, and any non-positive property is the negation of some positive property, so God cannot have any non-positive properties. Since necessary existence is also a positive property (axiom 5), it must be a property of every Godlike object, as every Godlike object has all the positive properties (definition 1). Since any Godlike object is necessarily existent, it follows that any Godlike object in one world is a Godlike object in all worlds, by the definition of necessary existence. Given the existence of a Godlike object in one world, proven above, we may conclude that there is a Godlike object in every possible world, as required (theorem 4). Besides axiom 1-5 and definition 1–3, a few other axioms from modal logic were tacitly used in the proof.

From these hypotheses, it is also possible to prove that there is only one God in each world by Leibniz&#x27;s law, the identity of indiscernibles: two or more objects are identical (the same) if they have all their properties in common, and so, there would only be one object in each world that possesses property G. Gödel did not attempt to do so however, as he purposely limited his proof to the issue of existence, rather than uniqueness.

== Argument ==
The following is the original argument in symbolic notation, then an explanation of each individual symbol used, and then a translation into English of the full argument.

===Original formal argument===

formula_1

=== Translation of individual symbols ===
Common notation in symbolic logic:

*formula_2: &quot;Object formula_3 has property formula_4&quot; (notation for first-order predicates)
* formula_5: &quot;implies&quot; (material implication)
* formula_6: &quot;For every formula_3&quot;, or &quot;for all formula_3&quot; (universal quantifier)
* formula_9: &quot;There exists an formula_3&quot;, or &quot;for some formula_3&quot; (existential quantifier)
* formula_12: &quot;The negation of formula_4&quot; (i.e., not formula_4)

Modal operators (used in modal logic):

*formula_15: &quot;It is possible that...&quot;, or, &quot;in at least one possible world, it is true that...&quot; (modal operator for possibility)
*formula_16: &quot;It is necessary that...&quot;, or, &quot;in all possible worlds, it is true that...&quot; (modal operator for necessity)

Primitive predicate in this argument:
* formula_17: &quot;Property formula_4 is positive&quot; (since it applies to properties, &quot;being positive&quot; is a second-order property) 
Derived predicates (defined in terms of other predicates within the argument):

*formula_19: &quot;formula_3 is God-like&quot;. (Definition 1)
* formula_21: &quot;formula_4 is an essential property of formula_3&quot; (Definition 2)
* formula_24: &quot;Object formula_3 exists necessarily&quot; (Definition 3)

===Translation of full argument===

Possible-worlds readings of modal terms have been added in parentheses, i.e., &quot;in all possible worlds&quot; for &quot;necessarily&quot; and &quot;in at least one possible world&quot; for &quot;possibly&quot;. For completeness, &quot;in the actual world&quot; should be added to all sentences that were said &quot;without&quot; &quot;necessarily&quot; or &quot;possibly&quot;, but this has been skipped since it might make the text difficult to read.

* Axiom 1: If formula_4 is a positive property, and if it is necessarily true (true in all possible worlds) that every object with property formula_4 also has property formula_28, then formula_28 is also a positive property.
* Axiom 2: The negation of a property formula_4 is positive if, and only if, formula_4 is not positive.
* Theorem 1: If a property formula_4 is positive, then it is possible that there exists an object formula_3 that has this property (in at least one possible world, there exists an object formula_3 that has this property).
* Definition 1: An object formula_3 is God-like if, and only if, formula_3 has all positive properties.
* Axiom 3: The property of being God-like is itself a positive property.
* Theorem 2: It is possible that there exists a God-like object formula_3 (in at least one possible world, there exists a God-like object formula_3).
* Definition 2: A property formula_4 is an essential property of an object formula_3 if, formula_3 has property formula_4, and every property formula_28 of formula_3 necessarily (in all possible worlds) and generally (for all objects) follows from formula_4.
* Axiom 4: If a property formula_4 is positive, then it is necessarily positive (positive in all possible worlds).
* Theorem 3: If formula_3 is God-like, then being God-like is an essential property of formula_3.
* Definition 3: An object formula_3 &quot;exists necessarily&quot; if each of its essential properties formula_4 applies, in each possible world, to some object formula_51.
* Axiom 5: &quot;Necessary existence&quot; is a positive property.
* Theorem 4: It is necessarily true (true in all possible worlds) that a God-like object exists.

==Criticism==

Most criticism of Gödel&#x27;s proof is aimed at its axioms: as with any proof in any logical system, if the axioms the proof depends on are doubted, then the conclusions can be doubted. It is particularly applicable to Gödel&#x27;s proof – because it rests on five axioms, some of which are considered questionable. A proof does not necessitate that the conclusion be correct, but rather that by accepting the axioms, the conclusion follows logically.

Many philosophers have called the axioms into question. The first layer of criticism is simply that there are no arguments presented that give reasons why the axioms are true. A second layer is that these particular axioms lead to unwelcome conclusions. This line of thought was argued by Jordan Howard Sobel, showing that if the axioms are accepted, they lead to a &quot;modal collapse&quot; where every statement that is true is necessarily true, i.e. the sets of necessary, of contingent, and of possible truths all coincide (provided there are accessible worlds at all). According to Robert Koons, Sobel suggested in a 2005 conference paper that Gödel might have welcomed modal collapse.

There are suggested amendments to the proof, presented by C. Anthony Anderson, but argued to be refutable by Anderson and Michael Gettings. Sobel&#x27;s proof of modal collapse has been questioned by Koons, but a counter-defence by Sobel has been given.

Gödel&#x27;s proof has also been questioned by Graham Oppy, asking whether many other almost-gods would also be &quot;proven&quot; through Gödel&#x27;s axioms. This counter-argument has been questioned by Gettings, who agrees that the axioms might be questioned, but disagrees that Oppy&#x27;s particular counter-example can be shown from Gödel&#x27;s axioms.

Religious scholar Fr. Robert J. Spitzer accepted Gödel&#x27;s proof, calling it &quot;an improvement over the Anselmian Ontological Argument (which does not work).&quot;

There are, however, many more criticisms, most of them focusing on the question of whether these axioms must be rejected to avoid odd conclusions. The broader criticism is that even if the axioms cannot be shown to be false, that does not mean that they are true. Hilbert&#x27;s famous remark about interchangeability of the primitives&#x27; names applies to those in Gödel&#x27;s ontological axioms (&quot;positive&quot;, &quot;god-like&quot;, &quot;essence&quot;) as well as to those in Hilbert&#x27;s geometry axioms (&quot;point&quot;, &quot;line&quot;, &quot;plane&quot;). According to André Fuhrmann (2005) it remains to show that the dazzling notion prescribed by traditions and often believed to be essentially mysterious satisfies Gödel&#x27;s axioms. This is not a mathematical, but a theological task. It is this task which decides which religion&#x27;s god has been proven to exist.

==Computationally verified versions==
Christoph Benzmüller and Bruno Woltzenlogel-Paleo formalized Gödel&#x27;s proof to a level that is suitable for automated theorem proving or at least computational verification via proof assistants. The effort made headlines in German newspapers. According to the authors of this effort, they were inspired by Melvin Fitting&#x27;s book.

In 2014, they computationally verified Gödel&#x27;s proof (in the above version). They also proved that this version&#x27;s axioms are consistent, but imply modal collapse, thus confirming Sobel&#x27;s 1987 argument. In the same paper, they suspected Gödel&#x27;s original version of the axioms to be inconsistent, as they failed to prove their consistency.

In 2016, they gave an automated proof that the original version implies formula_52, i.e., is inconsistent in every modal logic with a reflexive or symmetric accessibility relation. Moreover, they gave an argument that this version is inconsistent in every logic at all, but failed to duplicate it by automated provers. However, they were able to verify Melvin Fitting&#x27;s reformulation of the argument and guarantee its consistency.

== In literature ==
A humorous variant of Gödel&#x27;s ontological proof is mentioned in Quentin Canterel&#x27;s novel &quot;The Jolly Coroner&quot;.
The proof is also mentioned in the TV series &quot;Hand of God&quot;.

Jeffrey Kegler&#x27;s 2007 novel &quot;The God Proof&quot; depicts the (fictional) rediscovery of Gödel&#x27;s lost notebook about the ontological proof.

<doc id="12424" wikidata="Q629498" url="?curid=12424" title="Genetic programming">
<text>Genetic programming (GP) is an evolutionary algorithm, an artificial intelligence technique mimicking natural evolution, which operates on a population of programs. It applies the genetic operators selection according to a predefined fitness measure, mutation and crossover. 

The crossover operation involves swapping specified parts of selected pairs (parents) to produce new and different offspring that become part of the new generation of programs. Some programs not selected for reproduction are copied from the current generation to the new generation. Mutation involves substitution of some random part of a program with some other random part of a program. Then the selection and other operations are recursively applied to the new generation of programs.

Typically, members of each new generation are on average more fit than the members of the previous generation, and the best-of-generation program is often better than the best-of-generation programs from previous generations. Termination of the evolution usually occurs when some individual program reaches a predefined proficiency or fitness level.

It may and often does happen that a particular run of the algorithm results in premature convergence to some local maximum which is not a globally optimal or even good solution. Multiple runs (dozens to hundreds) are usually necessary to produce a very good result. It may also be necessary to have a large starting population size and variability of the individuals to avoid pathologies.

==History==
The first record of the proposal to evolve programs is probably that of Alan Turing in 1950. There was a gap of 25 years before the publication of John Holland&#x27;s &#x27;Adaptation in Natural and Artificial Systems&#x27; laid out the theoretical and empirical foundations of the science. In 1981, Richard Forsyth demonstrated the successful evolution of small programs, represented as trees, to perform classification of crime scene evidence for the UK Home Office.

Although the idea of evolving programs, initially in the computer language Lisp, was current amongst John Holland&#x27;s students, it was not until they organised the first Genetic Algorithms (GA) conference in Pittsburgh that Nichael Cramer published evolved programs in two specially designed languages, which included the first statement of modern &quot;tree-based&quot; Genetic Programming (that is, procedural languages organized in tree-based structures and operated on by suitably defined GA-operators). In 1988, John Koza (also a PhD student of John Holland) patented his invention of a GA for program evolution. This was followed by publication in the International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence IJCAI-89.

Koza followed this with 205 publications on “Genetic Programming” (GP), name coined by David Goldberg, also a PhD student of John Holland. However, it is the series of 4 books by Koza, starting in 1992 with accompanying videos, that really established GP. Subsequently, there was an enormous expansion of the number of publications with the Genetic Programming Bibliography, surpassing 10,000 entries. In 2010, Koza listed 77 results where Genetic Programming was human competitive.

In 1996, Koza started the annual Genetic Programming conference which was followed in 1998 by the annual EuroGP conference, and the first book in a GP series edited by Koza. 1998 also saw the first GP textbook. GP continued to flourish, leading to the first specialist GP journal and three years later (2003) the annual Genetic Programming Theory and Practice (GPTP) workshop was established by Rick Riolo. Genetic Programming papers continue to be published at a diversity of conferences and associated journals. Today there are nineteen GP books including several for students.

===Foundational work in GP===
Early work that set the stage for current genetic programming research topics and applications is diverse, and includes software synthesis and repair, predictive modeling, data mining, financial modeling, soft sensors, design, and image processing. Applications in some areas, such as design, often make use of intermediate representations, such as Fred Gruau&#x27;s cellular encoding. Industrial uptake has been significant in several areas including finance, the chemical industry, bioinformatics and the steel industry.

==Methods==
===Program representation===

GP evolves computer programs, traditionally represented in memory as tree structures. Trees can be easily evaluated in a recursive manner. Every internal node has an operator function and every terminal node has an operand, making mathematical expressions easy to evolve and evaluate. Thus traditionally GP favors the use of programming languages that naturally embody tree structures (for example, Lisp; other functional programming languages are also suitable).

Non-tree representations have been suggested and successfully implemented, such as linear genetic programming which perhaps suits the more traditional imperative languages. The commercial GP software &quot;Discipulus&quot; uses automatic induction of binary machine code (&quot;AIM&quot;) to achieve better performance. &quot;μGP&quot; uses directed multigraphs to generate programs that fully exploit the syntax of a given assembly language. Multi expression programming uses Three-address code for encoding solutions. Other program representations on which significant research and development have been conducted include programs for stack-based virtual machines, and sequences of integers that are mapped to arbitrary programming languages via grammars. Cartesian genetic programming is another form of GP, which uses a graph representation instead of the usual tree based representation to encode computer programs.

Most representations have structurally noneffective code (introns). Such non-coding genes may seem to be useless because they have no effect on the performance of any one individual. However, they alter the probabilities of generating different offspring under the variation operators, and thus alter the individual&#x27;s variational properties.
Experiments seem to show faster convergence when using program representations that allow such non-coding genes, compared to program representations that do not have any non-coding genes. Instantiations may have both trees with introns and those without; the latter are called canonical trees. Special canonical crossover operators are introduced that maintain the canonical structure of parents in their children.

===Initialisation===
The methods for creation of the initial population include:
* Grow creates the individuals sequentially. Every GP tree is created starting from the root, creating functional nodes with children as well as terminal nodes up to a certain depth. 
* Full is similar to the &quot;Grow&quot;. The difference is that all brunches in a tree are of same predetermined depth.
* Ramped half-and-half creates a populations consisting of formula_1 parts and a maximum depth of formula_2 for its trees. The first part has a maximum depth of 2, second of 3 and so on up to the formula_1-th part with maximum depth formula_2. Half of every part is created by &quot;Grow&quot;, while the other part is created by &quot;Full&quot;.

===Selection===
Selection is a process whereby certain individuals are selected from the current generation that would serve as parents for the next generation. The individuals are selected probabilistically such that the better performing individuals have a higher chance of getting selected. The most commonly used selection method in GP is tournament selection, although other methods such as fitness proportionate selection, lexicase selection, and others have been demonstrated to perform better for many GP problems.

Elitism, which involves seeding the next generation with the best individual (or best &quot;n&quot; individuals) from the current generation, is a technique sometimes employed to avoid regression.

===Crossover===

In Genetic Programming two fit individuals are chosen from the population to be parents for one or two children. In tree genetic programming, these parents are represented as inverted lisp like trees, with their root nodes at the top. In subtree crossover in each parent a subtree is randomly chosen. (Highlighted with yellow in the animation.) In the root donating parent (in the animation on the left) the chosen subtree is removed and replaced with a copy of the randomly chosen subtree from the other parent, to give a new child tree.

Sometimes two child crossover is used, in which case the removed subtree (in the animation on the left) is not simply deleted but is copied to a copy of the second parent (here on the right) replacing (in the copy) its randomly chosen subtree. Thus this type of subtree crossover takes two fit trees and generates two child trees.

===Replication===
Some individuals selected according to fitness criteria do not participate in crossover, but are copied into the next generation, akin to asexual reproduction in the natural world. They may be further subject to mutation.

===Mutation===

There are many types of mutation in genetic programming. They start from a fit syntactically correct parent and aim to randomly create a syntactically correct child. In the animation
a subtree is randomly chosen (highlighted by yellow). It is removed and replaced by a randomly generated subtree.

Other mutation operators select a leaf (external node) of the tree and replace it with a randomly chosen leaf. Another mutation is to select at random a function (internal node) and replace it with another function with the same arity (number of inputs). Hoist mutation randomly chooses a subtree and replaces it with a subtree within itself. Thus hoist mutation is guaranteed to make the child smaller. Leaf and same arity function replacement ensure the child is the same size as the parent. Whereas subtree mutation (in the animation) may, depending upon the function and terminal sets, have a bias to either increase or decrease the tree size. Other subtree based mutations try to carefully control the size of the replacement subtree and thus the size of the child tree. 

Similarly there are many types of linear genetic programming mutation, each of which tries to ensure the mutated child is still syntactically correct.

==Applications==
GP has been successfully used as an automatic programming tool, a machine learning tool and an automatic problem-solving engine. GP is especially useful in the domains where the exact form of the solution is not known in advance or an approximate solution is acceptable (possibly because finding the exact solution is very difficult). Some of the applications of GP are curve fitting, data modeling, symbolic regression, feature selection, classification, etc. John R. Koza mentions 76 instances where Genetic Programming has been able to produce results that are competitive with human-produced results (called Human-competitive results). Since 2004, the annual Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference (GECCO) holds Human Competitive Awards (called Humies) competition, where cash awards are presented to human-competitive results produced by any form of genetic and evolutionary computation. GP has won many awards in this competition over the years.

==Meta-genetic programming==
Meta-genetic programming is the proposed meta-learning technique of evolving a genetic programming system using genetic programming itself. It suggests that chromosomes, crossover, and mutation were themselves evolved, therefore like their real life counterparts should be allowed to change on their own rather than being determined by a human programmer. Meta-GP was formally proposed by Jürgen Schmidhuber in 1987. Doug Lenat&#x27;s Eurisko is an earlier effort that may be the same technique. It is a recursive but terminating algorithm, allowing it to avoid infinite recursion. In the &quot;autoconstructive evolution&quot; approach to meta-genetic programming, the methods for the production and variation of offspring are encoded within the evolving programs themselves, and programs are executed to produce new programs to be added to the population.

Critics of this idea often say this approach is overly broad in scope. However, it might be possible to constrain the fitness criterion onto a general class of results, and so obtain an evolved GP that would more efficiently produce results for sub-classes. This might take the form of a meta evolved GP for producing human walking algorithms which is then used to evolve human running, jumping, etc. The fitness criterion applied to the meta GP would simply be one of efficiency.

<doc id="12425" wikidata="Q34661" url="?curid=12425" title="Gustav Klimt">
<text>Gustav Klimt (14 July 1862 – 6 February 1918) was an Austrian symbolist painter and one of the most prominent members of the Vienna Secession movement. Klimt is noted for his paintings, murals, sketches, and other objets d&#x27;art. Klimt&#x27;s primary subject was the female body, and his works are marked by a frank eroticism. Amongst his figurative works, which include allegories and portraits, he painted landscapes. Among the artists of the Vienna Secession, Klimt was the most influenced by Japanese art and its methods.

Early in his career, he was a successful painter of architectural decorations in a conventional manner. As he began to develop a more personal style, his work was the subject of controversy that culminated when the paintings he completed around 1900 for the ceiling of the Great Hall of the University of Vienna were criticized as pornographic. He subsequently accepted no more public commissions, but achieved a new success with the paintings of his &quot;golden phase&quot;, many of which include gold leaf. Klimt&#x27;s work was an important influence on his younger peer Egon Schiele.

Since the 1990s, he has been one of the artists whose paintings fetch top prices at auctions.

==Biography==

===Early life===

Gustav Klimt was born in Baumgarten, near Vienna in the Austrian Empire, and was second of seven children—three boys and four girls. His mother, Anna Klimt (&quot;née&quot; Finster), had an unrealized ambition to be a musical performer. His father, Ernst Klimt the Elder, formerly from Bohemia, was a gold engraver. All three of their sons displayed artistic talent early on. Klimt&#x27;s younger brothers were Ernst Klimt and .

Klimt lived in poverty while attending the Vienna Kunstgewerbeschule, a school of applied arts and crafts, now the University of Applied Arts Vienna, where he studied architectural painting from 1876 until 1883. He revered Vienna&#x27;s foremost history painter of the time, Hans Makart. Klimt readily accepted the principles of conservative training; his early work may be classified as academic. In 1877 his brother, Ernst, who, like his father, would become an engraver, also enrolled in the school. The two brothers and their friend, Franz Matsch, began working together and by 1880 they had received numerous commissions as a team that they called the &quot;Company of Artists&quot;. They also helped their teacher in painting murals in the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna. Klimt began his professional career painting interior murals and ceilings in large public buildings on the Ringstraße, including a successful series of &quot;Allegories and Emblems&quot;.

In 1888 Klimt received the Golden Order of Merit from Emperor Franz Josef I of Austria for his contributions to murals painted in the Burgtheater in Vienna. He also became an honorary member of the University of Munich and the University of Vienna. In 1892 Klimt&#x27;s father and brother Ernst both died, and he had to assume financial responsibility for his father&#x27;s and brother&#x27;s families. The tragedies also affected his artistic vision and soon he would move towards a new personal style.
Characteristic of his style at the end of the 19th century is the inclusion of &quot;Nuda Veritas&quot; (&quot;naked truth&quot;) as a symbolic figure in some of his works, including &quot;Ancient Greece and Egypt&quot; (1891), &quot;Pallas Athene&quot; (1898) and &quot;Nuda Veritas&quot; (1899). Historians believe that Klimt with the &quot;nuda veritas&quot; denounced both the policy of the Habsburgs and Austrian society, which ignored all political and social problems of that time. In the early 1890s, Klimt met Austrian fashion designer Emilie Louise Flöge (a sibling of his sister-in-law) who was to be his companion until the end of his life. His painting, &quot;The Kiss&quot; (1907–08), is thought to be an image of them as lovers which was painted five years after Klimt&#x27;s 1902 full-length portrait of her. He designed many costumes that she produced and modeled in his works.

During this period, Klimt fathered at least fourteen children.

===Vienna Secession years===

Klimt became one of the founding members and president of the &quot;Wiener Secession&quot; in 1897 and of the group&#x27;s periodical, &quot;Ver Sacrum&quot; (&quot;Sacred Spring&quot;). He remained with the &quot;Secession&quot; until 1908. The goals of the group were to provide exhibitions for unconventional young artists, to bring the works of the best foreign artists to Vienna, and to publish its own magazine to showcase the work of members. The group declared no manifesto and did not set out to encourage any particular style—Naturalists, Realists, and Symbolists all coexisted. The government supported their efforts and gave them a lease on public land to erect an exhibition hall. The group&#x27;s symbol was Pallas Athena, the Greek goddess of just causes, wisdom, and the arts—of whom Klimt painted his radical version in 1898.

In 1894, Klimt was commissioned to create three paintings to decorate the ceiling of the Great Hall of the University of Vienna. Not completed until the turn of the century, his three paintings, &quot;Philosophy&quot;, &quot;Medicine&quot;, and &quot;Jurisprudence&quot; were criticized for their radical themes and material, and were called &quot;pornographic&quot;. Klimt had transformed traditional allegory and symbolism into a new language that was more overtly sexual and hence more disturbing to some. The public outcry came from all quarters—political, aesthetic and religious. As a result, the paintings &quot;(seen in the gallery below)&quot; were not displayed on the ceiling of the Great Hall. This was to be the last public commission accepted by the artist. All three paintings were destroyed when retreating German forces burned Schloss Immendorf in May 1945, together with another ten paintings, including &quot;Schubert at the Piano&quot;, &quot;Girlfriends&quot; (or &quot;Two Women Friends&quot;), &quot;Wally&quot; (portrait), &quot;The Music (II)&quot;.

His &quot;Nuda Veritas&quot; (1899) defined his bid to further &quot;shake up&quot; the establishment. The starkly naked red-headed woman holds the mirror of truth, while above her is a quotation by Friedrich Schiller in stylized lettering: &quot;If you cannot please everyone with your deeds and your art, please only a few. To please many is bad.&quot; 
In 1902, animated by resentment Klimt wanted to title the painting &quot;Gold Fish&quot; (in which a naked woman ostentatiously and maliciously shows her butt), &quot;To my critics&quot;, but was dissuaded by friends.

In 1902, Klimt finished the &quot;Beethoven Frieze&quot; for the Fourteenth Vienna Secessionist Exhibition, which was intended to be a celebration of the composer and featured a monumental polychrome sculpture by Max Klinger. Intended for the exhibition only, the frieze was painted directly on the walls with light materials. After the exhibition the painting was preserved, although it was not displayed again until restored in 1986. The face on the Beethoven portrait resembled the composer and Vienna Court Opera director Gustav Mahler.

In 1905, dissensions within the &quot;Secession&quot; increased, and when the artistic consultant of the Galerie Mietkhe Carl Moll was attacked by colleagues of the &quot;Secession&quot; for his work, a strong controversy arose which created a real internal split, led by Klimt. The following year, Klimt formed the group called &quot;Kunstschau&quot; (Art Show) or &quot;Klimt group&quot;, which also included Moll and Otto Wagner, among other important Austrian artists.

During this period Klimt did not confine himself to public commissions. Beginning in the late 1890s he took annual summer holidays with the Flöge family on the shores of Attersee and painted many of his landscapes there, such as &quot;Schloss by the Water&quot;. These landscapes constitute the only genre aside from figure painting that seriously interested Klimt. In recognition of his intensity, the locals called him &quot;Waldschrat&quot; (&quot;forest demon&quot;).

Klimt&#x27;s Attersee paintings are of sufficient number and quality to merit a separate appreciation. Formally, the landscapes are characterized by the same refinement of design and emphatic patterning as the figural pieces. Deep space in the Attersee works is flattened so efficiently to a single plane that it is believed that Klimt painted them by using a telescope.

===Golden phase and critical success===
From 1900 Gustav Klimt became famous above all as a &quot;painter of women&quot;. He created about one large-format portrait of a woman per year, in which he applied the principles of Art Nouveau - flatness, decoration, and gold leaf application. At the same time, he devoted himself to allegories and Old Testament heroines, which he transformed, however, into dangerous &quot;femmes fatales&quot;. Eros, sexuality and femininity were variously interpreted by him as alluring danger. Life, love, and death can be determined as the important themes of Klimt&#x27;s work. Klimt&#x27;s &#x27;Golden Phase&#x27; was marked by positive critical reaction and financial success. Many of his paintings from this period included gold leaf. Klimt had previously used gold in his &quot;Pallas Athene&quot; (1898) and &quot;Judith I&quot; (1901), although the works most popularly associated with this period are the &quot;Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer I&quot; (1907) and &quot;The Kiss&quot; (1907–08).

Klimt traveled all over Europe, mainly to present his works on the occasion of international exhibitions, but trips to Venice and Ravenna, both famous for their beautiful mosaics, most likely inspired his gold technique and his Byzantine imagery. In 1904, he collaborated with other artists on the lavish Stoclet Palace, the home of a wealthy Belgian industrialist that was one of the grandest monuments of the Art Nouveau age. Klimt&#x27;s contributions to the dining room, including both &quot;Fulfillment&quot; and &quot;Expectation&quot;, were some of his finest decorative works, and as he publicly stated, &quot;probably the ultimate stage of my development of ornament.&quot;

In 1905, Klimt painted &quot;The Three Ages of Woman&quot;, depicting the cycle of life. He created a painted portrait of Margarete Wittgenstein, Ludwig Wittgenstein&#x27;s sister, on the occasion of her marriage. Then, between 1907 and 1909, Klimt painted five canvases of society women wrapped in fur. His apparent love of costume is expressed in the many photographs of Flöge modeling clothing he had designed.

As he worked and relaxed in his home, Klimt normally wore sandals and a long robe with no undergarments. His simple life was somewhat cloistered, devoted to his art, family, and little else except the Secessionist Movement from which he and many colleagues eventually resigned. He avoided café society and seldom socialized with other artists. Klimt&#x27;s fame usually brought patrons to his door and he could afford to be highly selective. His painting method was very deliberate and painstaking at times and he required lengthy sittings by his subjects. Although very active sexually, he kept his affairs discreet and he avoided personal scandal.

The artist cultivated close relationships with some of his clients, who were primarily from the assimilated Jewish Viennese Haute bourgeoisie. He cultivated intimate relationships, especially with his models from upper-class circles. He was considered progressive for his time, because he allowed women an active role in sexuality.

Klimt wrote little about his vision or his methods. He wrote mostly postcards to Flöge and kept no diary. In a rare writing called &quot;Commentary on a non-existent self-portrait&quot;, he states &quot;I have never painted a self-portrait. I am less interested in myself as a subject for a painting than I am in other people, above all women... There is nothing special about me. I am a painter who paints day after day from morning to night ... Whoever wants to know something about me ... ought to look carefully at my pictures.&quot;

In 1901 Hermann Bahr wrote, in his &quot;Speech on Klimt&quot;: &quot;Just as only a lover can reveal to a man what life means to him and develop its innermost significance, I feel the same about these paintings.&quot;

===Final years and death===
In 1911 his painting &quot;Death and Life&quot; received first prize in the world exhibitions in Rome. In 1915 Anna, his mother, died. Klimt died three years later in Vienna on 6 February 1918, having suffered a stroke and pneumonia brought about by the Spanish flu. He was buried at the Hietzinger Cemetery in Hietzing, Vienna. Numerous paintings by him were left unfinished.

==Folios==
===Gustav Klimt: &quot;Das Werk&quot;===

The only folio set produced in Klimt&#x27;s lifetime, &quot;Das Werk Gustav Klimts&quot;, was published initially by Hugo Othmar Miethke (of Galerie Miethke, Klimt&#x27;s exclusive gallery in Vienna) from 1908 to 1914 in an edition of 300, supervised personally by the artist. The first thirty-five editions (I-XXXV) each included an original drawing by Klimt, and the next thirty-five editions (XXXVI–LXX) each with a facsimile signature on the title page. Fifty images depicting Klimt&#x27;s most important paintings (1893–1913) were reproduced using collotype lithography and mounted on a heavy, cream-colored wove paper with deckle edges. Thirty-one of the images (ten of which are multicolored) are printed on &quot;Chine-collé&quot;. The remaining nineteen are high-quality halftone prints. Each piece was marked with a unique signet—designed by Klimt—which was impressed into the wove paper in gold metallic ink. The prints were issued in groups of ten to subscribers, in unbound black paper folders embossed with Klimt&#x27;s name. Because of the delicate nature of collotype lithography, as well as the necessity for multicolored prints (a feat difficult to reproduce with collotypes), and Klimt&#x27;s own desire for perfection, the series that was published in mid-1908 was not completed until 1914.

Each of the fifty prints was categorized among five themes:
# Allegorical (which included multicolored prints of &quot;The Golden Knight&quot;, 1903 and &quot;The Virgin&quot;, )
# Erotic-Symbolist (&quot;Water Serpents I&quot; and &quot;Water Serpents II&quot;, both c. 1907–08 and &quot;The Kiss&quot;, c. 1908)
# Landscapes (&quot;Farm Garden with Sunflowers&quot;, 1907)
# Mythical or Biblical (&quot;Pallas Athena&quot;, 1898; &quot;Judith and The Head of Holofernes&quot;, 1901; and &quot;Danaë&quot;, c. 1908)
# Portraits (&quot;Emilie Flöge&quot;, 1902)

The monochrome collotypes as well as the halftone works were printed with a variety of colored inks ranging from sepia to blue and green. Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria was the first to purchase a folio set of &quot;Das Werk Gustav Klimts&quot; in 1908.

===&quot;Fünfundzwanzig Handzeichnungen&quot;===
&quot;Fünfundzwanzig Handzeichnungen&quot; (&quot;Twenty-five Drawings&quot;) was released the year after Klimt&#x27;s death. Many of the drawings in the collection were erotic in nature and just as polarizing as his painted works. Published in Vienna in 1919 by Gilhofer &amp; Ranschburg, the edition of 500 features twenty-five monochrome and two-color collotype reproductions, nearly indistinguishable from the original works. While the set was released a year after Klimt&#x27;s death, some art historians suspect he was involved with production planning because of the meticulous nature of the printing (Klimt had overseen the production of the plates for &quot;Das Werk Gustav Klimts&quot;, making sure each one was to his exact specifications, a level of quality carried through similarly in &quot;Fünfundzwanzig Handzeichnungen&quot;). The first ten editions also each contained an original Klimt drawing.

Many of the works contained in this volume depict erotic scenes of nude women, some of whom are masturbating alone or are coupled in sapphic embraces. When a number of the original drawings were exhibited to the public, at Galerie Miethke in 1910 and the International Exhibition of Prints and Drawings in Vienna in 1913, they were met by critics and viewers who were hostile towards Klimt&#x27;s contemporary perspective. There was an audience for Klimt&#x27;s erotic drawings, however, and fifteen of his drawings were selected by Viennese poet Franz Blei for his translation of Hellenistic satirist Lucian&#x27;s &quot;Dialogues of the Courtesans&quot;. The book, limited to 450 copies, provided Klimt with the opportunity to show these more lurid depictions of women and avoided censorship thanks to an audience composed of a small group of (mostly male) affluent patrons.

===&quot;Gustav Klimt An Aftermath&quot;===
Composed in 1931 by editor Max Eisler and printed by the Austrian State Printing Office, &quot;Gustav Klimt An Aftermath&quot; was intended to complete the lifetime folio &quot;Das Werk Gustav Klimts&quot;. The folio contains thirty colored collotypes (fourteen of which are multicolored) and follows a similar format found in &quot;Das Werk Gustav Klimts&quot;, replacing the unique Klimt-designed signets with gold-debossed plate numbers. One hundred and fifty sets were produced in English, with twenty of them (Nos. I–XX) presented as a &quot;gala edition&quot; bound in gilt leather. The set contains detailed images from previously released works (Hygeia from the University Mural &quot;Medicine&quot;, 1901; a section of the third University Mural &quot;Jurisprudence&quot;, 1903), as well as the unfinished paintings (&quot;Adam and Eve&quot;, &quot;Bridal Progress&quot;).

In 1963, the Albertina museum in Vienna began researching the drawings of Gustav Klimt. The research project &quot;Gustav Klimt. Die Zeichnungen&quot;, has since been associated with intensive exhibition and publication activities.

Between 1980 and 1984 Alice Strobl published the three-volume catalogue raisonné, which records and describes all drawings by Gustav Klimt known at the time in chronological order. An additional supplementary volume was published in 1989. In the following year Strobl transferred her work to the art historian and curator Marian Bisanz-Prakken, who had assisted her since 1975 in the determination and classification of the works and who continues the research project to this day. Since 1990, Marian Bisanz-Prakken has redefined, documented, and scientifically processed around 400 further drawings.

This makes the Albertina Vienna the only institution in the world that has been examining and scientifically classifying the artist&#x27;s works for half a century. The research project now includes information on over 4,300 works by Gustav Klimt.

===Posthumous auction history===

Klimt&#x27;s paintings have brought some of the highest prices recorded for individual works of art. In November 2003, Klimt&#x27;s &quot;Landhaus am Attersee&quot; sold for $29,128,000, but that sale was soon eclipsed by prices paid for Willem de Kooning&#x27;s &quot;Woman III&quot; and later Klimt&#x27;s own &quot;Adele Bloch-Bauer II&quot;, the latter of which sold for $150 million in 2016. More frequently than paintings, however, the artist&#x27;s works on paper can be found on the art market. The art market database Artprice lists 67 auction entries for paintings, but 1564 for drawings and watercolors. The most expensive drawing sold so far was &quot;Reclining Female Nude Facing Left&quot;, which was made between 1914 and 1915 and sold in London in 2008 for . However, the majority of the art trade traditionally takes place privately through galleries such as Wienerroither &amp; Kohlbacher, which specialize in the trade with original works by Gustav Klimt and Egon Schiele and regularly present these at monographic exhibitions and international art fairs.

In 2006, the 1907 portrait, &quot;Adele Bloch-Bauer I&quot;, was purchased for the Neue Galerie New York by Ronald Lauder reportedly for US$135 million, surpassing Picasso&#x27;s 1905 &quot;Boy With a Pipe&quot; (sold 5 May 2004 for $104 million), as the highest reported price ever paid for a painting up to that point.

On 7 August 2006, Christie&#x27;s auction house announced it was handling the sale of the remaining four works by Klimt that were recovered by Maria Altmann and her co-heirs after their long legal battle against Austria (see &quot;Republic of Austria v. Altmann&quot;). Altmann&#x27;s fight to regain her family&#x27;s paintings has been the subject of a number of documentary films, including &quot;Adele&#x27;s Wish&quot;. Her struggle also became the subject of the dramatic film &quot;Woman in Gold&quot;, a movie inspired by &quot;Stealing Klimt&quot;, the documentary featuring Maria Altmann herself. The portrait of &quot;Adele Bloch-Bauer II&quot; was sold at auction in November 2006 for $88 million, the third-highest-priced piece of art at auction at the time. &quot;The Apple Tree I&quot; (c. 1912) sold for $33 million, &quot;Birch Forest&quot; (1903) sold for $40.3 million, and &quot;Houses in Unterach on Lake Atter&quot; (1916) sold for $31 million. Collectively, the five restituted paintings netted more than $327 million. The painting &quot;Litzlberg am Attersee&quot; was auctioned for $40.4 million November 2011.

Klimt&#x27;s last painting, &quot;Lady with a Fan&quot; (&quot;Dame mit Fächer&quot;, 1918), was sold by Sotheby&#x27;s in London on 27 June 2023 for UK£85.3M (US$108.4) to a Hong Kong collector, the highest-priced artwork ever sold at auction in Europe.

===Visual art===

According to the writer Frank Whitford: &quot;Klimt of course, is an important artist—he&#x27;s a very &quot;popular&quot; artist—but in terms of the history of art, he&#x27;s a very unimportant artist. Although he sums up so much in his work, about the society in which he found himself—in art historical terms his effect was negligible. So he&#x27;s an artist really in a cul-de-sac.&quot; Klimt&#x27;s work had a strong influence on the paintings of Egon Schiele, with whom he would collaborate to found the &quot;Kunsthalle&quot; (Hall of Art) in 1917, to try to keep local artists from going abroad. Artists who reinterpreted Klimt&#x27;s work include Slovak artist Rudolf Fila.

===Legacy===
Already during his lifetime, Klimt influenced other artists, such as the Italian Liberty style artist Galileo Chini (1873–1956). Klimt was exhibited at the 1910 Venice Biennale. Chini and Vittorio Zecchin (1878–1947) created a number of panels in 1914 for the Venice Hotel Terminus called &quot;La Primavera&quot; and &quot;Mille e una notte&quot;. These were later exhibited in the Boncompagni Ludovisi Decorative Art Museum.

In 1972 the Vienna State Opera presented a new production of &quot;Salome&quot;, an opera by Oscar Wilde and Richard Strauss, in a Klimt-inspired stage setting and costumes by Jürgen Rose. This production, directed by Boleslaw Barlog and first conducted by Karl Böhm, became extremely popular and stayed in the repertoire for nearly fifty years. It was shown in 265 performances and went on tour to Florence, Washington and twice in Japan.

In 2006 an Austrian art-house biographical film about his life, &quot;Klimt&quot;, was released with John Malkovich in the lead role. In 2008 the Couturier John Galliano found inspiration for the Christian Dior Spring-Summer 2008 haute couture collection in Klimt&#x27;s work. The 2013 collection of designer Alexander McQueen was partially inspired by Klimt.

Gustav Klimt and his work have been the subjects of many collector coins and medals, such as the 100 Euro Painting Gold Coin, issued on 5 November 2003, by the Austrian Mint. The obverse depicts Klimt in his studio with two unfinished paintings on easels.

Tawny Chatmon, an American photographic artist known for her portraits of Black children overlaid with gold leaf and paint, has sought to place Black figures in glittering gold clothing inspired by Klimt&#x27;s lavish portraits of white Viennese women.

Elements of the portrait of &quot;First Lady Michelle Obama&quot;, by Amy Sherald in 2018, have been noted by art critics to have been influenced by Klimt, in particular the &quot;Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer I&quot;. One commentator noted the similarity to fashion designed by Klimt&#x27;s muse Emilie Louise Flöge.

===Commemoration of the 150th anniversary of birth===

The city of Vienna, Austria had many special exhibitions commemorating the 150th anniversary of Klimt&#x27;s birth in 2012.

Google commemorated Gustav Klimt with a Google doodle celebrating Klimt&#x27;s painting &quot;The Kiss&quot; on his 150th birthday, 14 July 2012.

In 2012, the Austrian Mint began a five-coin gold series to coincide with the 150th anniversary of Klimt&#x27;s birth. The first 50 Euro gold coin was issued on 25 January 2012 and featured a portrait of Klimt on the obverse and a portion of his painting of Adele Bloch-Bauer.

===Gustav Klimt Foundation===
In 2013, the Gustav Klimt Foundation was set up by Ursula Ucicky, widow of Klimt&#x27;s illegitimate son Gustav Ucicky, with a mission to &quot;preserve and disseminate Gustav Klimt&#x27;s legacy.&quot; The managing director of the Leopold Museum, Peter Weinhäupl, was appointed as chairman of the foundation. As a reaction, the museum&#x27;s director Tobias G. Natter resigned in protest, citing Ucicky&#x27;s past as a Nazi propaganda filmmaker.

===Nazi-looted art: restitution and litigation===
In 2000, a government committee recommended that Klimt&#x27;s &quot;Lady with Hat and Feather Boa&quot;, in Belvedere Museum in Vienna, be restituted to the heirs of the Jewish family that had owned it before the Nazi Anschluss.

National Public Radio reported on 17 January 2006 that &quot;The Austrian National Gallery is being compelled by a national arbitration board to return five paintings by Gustav Klimt to a Los Angeles-based woman, the heir of a Jewish family that had its art stolen by the Nazis. The paintings are estimated to be worth at least $150 million.&quot; This incident, involving Maria Altmann, was subsequently made into the Hollywood movie &quot;Woman in Gold&quot;, starring Helen Mirren.

Later that year, the most notable of the five paintings, 1907&#x27;s &quot;Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer I&quot; (also known as “The Woman in Gold”), was sold at auction for $135 million (at the time, the highest price ever paid for a single painting). The winning bidder was art collector Ronald S. Lauder, founder of Neue Galerie in New York, where it remains on display.

In 2009 the Lentos Art Museum in Linz, Austria restituted Klimt&#x27;s Portrait of Ria Munk III (Frauenbildnis) to the heirs of Aranka Munk, a Jewish art collector in Vienna who was murdered in the Holocaust. The looted portrait was of her daughter.

In 2021 the French minister of culture announced that the only Klimt in France&#x27;s national collections was Nazi loot which should be restituted to the heirs of the Jewish family that had been persecuted by Nazis. &quot;Rosebushes Under the Trees&quot;, painted in 1905, had been owned by Nora Stiasi, who had been forced to sell it before being murdered by the Nazis. It is currently hanging in France&#x27;s Orsay Museum which purchased it from Swiss art dealer Peter Nathan in 1980.

A similar painting, also painted by Klimt and known as &quot;Apple Trees II&quot;, which was also Nazi loot, was mistakenly returned to the wrong family by the Austrian authorities.

Other Klimts that have been the object of ownership battles owing to a history of Nazi looting include the &quot;Beethoven Frieze&quot;, &quot;Water Snakes II&quot;, &quot;Blooming Meadow&quot; and &quot;Portrait of Gertrude Lowe&quot;.

In 2023, Ronald S. Lauder agreed to restitute and repurchase Klimt&#x27;s “The Black Feather Hat,” which had belonged to Irene Beran, before she fled the Nazis. The painting&#x27;s provenance was unclear after it left Beran&#x27;s collection, resurfacing in Stuttgart in connection to the Nazi Friedrich Welz. Beran&#x27;s mother and former husband Philip were murdered by the Nazis after being deported to the Theresienstadt concentration camp.

<text>Julius Henry &quot;Groucho&quot; Marx (; October 2, 1890 – August 19, 1977) was an American comedian, actor, writer, and singer who performed in films and vaudeville on television, radio, and the stage. He is considered one of America&#x27;s greatest comedians.

Marx made 13 feature films as a team with his brothers, who performed under the name the Marx Brothers, of whom he was the third born. He also had a successful solo career, primarily on radio and television, most notably as the host of the game show &quot;You Bet Your Life&quot;.

His distinctive appearance, carried over from his days in vaudeville, included quirks such as an exaggerated stooped posture, spectacles, cigar, and a thick greasepaint mustache (later a real mustache) and eyebrows.

== Early life ==
Julius Henry Marx was born on October 2, 1890, in Manhattan, New York City. Marx stated that he was born in a room above a butcher&#x27;s shop on East 78th Street, &quot;Between Lexington and Third&quot;, as he told Dick Cavett in a 1969 television interview. The Marx children grew up in a turn-of-the-century building at 179 East 93rd Street off Lexington Avenue in a neighborhood now known as Carnegie Hill on the Upper East Side of the borough of Manhattan. His older brother Harpo, in his memoir &quot;Harpo Speaks&quot;, called the building &quot;the first real home I knew&quot;. It was populated with European immigrants, mostly artisans. Just across the street were the oldest brownstones in the area, owned by people including the well-connected Loew Brothers and William Orth. The Marx family lived there &quot;for about 14 years&quot;, Groucho also told Cavett.
Marx&#x27;s family was Jewish. His mother was Miene &quot;Minnie&quot; Schoenberg, whose family came from Dornum in northern Germany when she was 16 years old. His father was Simon &quot;Sam&quot; Marx, who changed his name from Marrix, and was called &quot;Frenchie&quot; by his sons throughout his life, because he and his family came from Alsace in France. Minnie&#x27;s brother was Al Schoenberg, who shortened his name to Al Shean when he went into show business as half of Gallagher and Shean, a noted vaudeville act of the early 20th century. According to Marx, when Shean visited, he would throw the local waifs a few coins so that when he knocked at the door he would be surrounded by adoring fans. Marx and his brothers respected his opinions and asked him on several occasions to write some material for them.

Minnie Marx did not have an entertainment industry career but had intense ambition for her sons to go on the stage like their uncle. While pushing her second son Leonard (Chico Marx) in piano lessons, she found that Julius had a pleasant soprano voice and the ability to remain on key. Julius&#x27;s early career goal was to become a doctor, but the family&#x27;s need for income forced him out of school at the age of twelve. By that time Julius had become a voracious reader, particularly fond of Horatio Alger. Marx continued to overcome his lack of formal education by becoming very well-read.

After a few stabs at entry-level office work and jobs suitable for adolescents, Marx took to the stage as a boy singer with the Gene Leroy Trio, debuting at the Ramona Theatre in Grand Rapids, Michigan, on July 16, 1905. Marx reputedly claimed that he was &quot;hopelessly average&quot; as a vaudevillian, but this was typical Marx, wisecracking in his true form. By 1909, Minnie Marx had assembled her sons into an undistinguished vaudeville singing group billed as &quot;The Four Nightingales&quot;. The brothers Julius, Milton (Gummo Marx) and Arthur (originally Adolph, but Harpo Marx from 1911) and another boy singer, Lou Levy, traveled the U.S. vaudeville circuits to little fanfare. After exhausting their prospects in the East, the family moved to La Grange, Illinois, to play the Midwest.
After a particularly dispiriting performance in Nacogdoches, Texas, Julius, Milton, and Arthur began cracking jokes onstage for their own amusement. Much to their surprise, the audience liked them better as comedians than as singers. They modified the then-popular Gus Edwards comedy skit &quot;School Days&quot; and renamed it &quot;Fun In Hi Skule&quot;. The Marx Brothers performed variations on this routine for the next seven years.

For a time in Vaudeville, all the brothers performed using ethnic accents. Leonard, the oldest, developed the Italian accent he used as Chico Marx to convince some roving bullies that he was Italian, not Jewish. Arthur, the next oldest, donned a curly red wig and became &quot;Patsy Brannigan&quot;, a stereotypical Irish character. His discomfort when speaking on stage led to his uncle Al Shean&#x27;s suggestion that he stop speaking altogether and play the role in mime. Julius Marx&#x27;s character from &quot;Fun In Hi Skule&quot; was an ethnic German, so Julius played him with a German accent. After the sinking of the in 1915, public anti-German sentiment was widespread, and Marx&#x27;s German character was booed, so he dropped the accent and developed the fast-talking wise-guy character that became his trademark.

The Marx Brothers became the biggest comedic stars of the Palace Theatre in New York, which billed itself as the &quot;Valhalla of Vaudeville&quot;. Brother Chico&#x27;s deal-making skills resulted in three hit plays on Broadway. No other comedy routine had ever so infected the Broadway circuit. All of this stage work predated their Hollywood career. By the time the Marxes made their first movie, they were already major stars with sharply honed skills; and by the time Groucho was relaunched to stardom in television on &quot;You Bet Your Life&quot;, he had been performing successfully for half a century.

== Career ==

=== Vaudeville ===
Marx started his career in vaudeville in 1905 when he joined up with an act called The Leroy Trio. He answered a newspaper want ad by a man named Robin Leroy who was looking for a boy to join his group as a singer. Marx was hired along with fellow vaudeville actor Johnny Morris. Through this act, Marx got his first taste of life as a vaudeville performer. In 1909, Marx and his brothers had become a group act, at first called The Three Nightingales and later The Four Nightingales. The brothers&#x27; mother, Minnie Marx, was the group&#x27;s manager, putting them together and booking their shows. The group had a rocky start, performing in less than adequate venues and rarely, if ever, being paid for their performances. Eventually brother Milton (Gummo) left the act to serve in World War I and was replaced by Herbert (Zeppo), and the group became known as the Marx Brothers. Their first successful show was &quot;Fun In Hi Skule&quot; (1910).

=== Motion pictures ===

Marx made 26 movies, including 13 with his brothers Chico and Harpo. Marx developed a routine as a wisecracking hustler with a distinctive chicken-walking lope, an exaggerated greasepaint mustache and eyebrows and an ever-present cigar, improvising insults to stuffy dowagers (frequently played by Margaret Dumont) and anyone else who stood in his way. As the Marx Brothers, he and his brothers starred in a series of popular stage shows and movies.

Their first movie was a silent film made in 1921 that was only shown once, in the Bronx, and is believed to have been destroyed shortly afterward. A decade later, the team made their last two Broadway shows—&quot;The Cocoanuts&quot; and &quot;Animal Crackers&quot;—into movies. Other successful films were &quot;Monkey Business&quot;, &quot;Horse Feathers&quot;, &quot;Duck Soup&quot; and &quot;A Night at the Opera&quot;. One quip from Marx concerned his response to Sam Wood, the director of &quot;A Night at the Opera&quot;. Furious with the Marx Brothers&#x27; ad-libs and antics on the set, Wood yelled in disgust: &quot;You can&#x27;t make an actor out of clay.&quot; Marx responded, &quot;Nor a director out of Wood.&quot;
Marx also worked as a radio comedian and show host. One of his earliest stints was a short-lived series in 1932, &quot;Flywheel, Shyster and Flywheel,&quot; costarring Chico. Though most of the scripts and discs were thought to have been destroyed, all but one of the scripts were found in 1988 in the Library of Congress.
In 1947, Marx was asked to host a radio quiz program &quot;You Bet Your Life.&quot; It was broadcast by ABC and then CBS before moving to NBC. It moved from radio to television on October 5, 1950, and ran for eleven years. It was largely sponsored by DeSoto automobiles and Marx sometimes appeared in the commercials. Filmed before an audience, the show consisted of Marx bantering with the contestants and ad-libbing jokes before briefly quizzing them. The announcer for the show was George Fenneman. The show was responsible for popularizing the phrases &quot;Say the secret word and the duck will come down and give you fifty dollars,&quot; &quot;Who&#x27;s buried in Grant&#x27;s Tomb?&quot; and &quot;What color is the White House?&quot; (asked to reward a losing contestant a consolation prize).

Throughout his career Marx introduced a number of memorable songs in films, including &quot;Hooray for Captain Spaulding&quot; and &quot;Hello, I Must Be Going&quot;, in &quot;Animal Crackers&quot;, &quot;Whatever It Is, I&#x27;m Against It&quot;, &quot;Everyone Says I Love You&quot; and &quot;Lydia the Tattooed Lady&quot;. Frank Sinatra, who once quipped that the only thing he could do better than Marx was sing, made a film with Marx and Jane Russell in 1951 entitled &quot;Double Dynamite&quot;.

=== Mustache, eyebrows, and walk ===

In public and off-camera, Harpo and Chico were hard to recognize without their wigs and costumes, and it was almost impossible for fans to recognize Groucho without his trademark eyeglasses, fake eyebrows, and mustache.
The greasepaint mustache and eyebrows originated spontaneously prior to a vaudeville performance in the early 1920s when he did not have time to apply the pasted-on mustache he had been using (or, according to his autobiography, simply did not enjoy the removal of the mustache because of the effects of tearing an adhesive bandage off the same patch of skin every night). After applying the greasepaint mustache, a quick glance in the mirror revealed his natural hair eyebrows were too undertoned and did not match the rest of his face, so Marx added the greasepaint to his eyebrows and headed for the stage. The absurdity of the greasepaint was never discussed on-screen, but in a famous scene in &quot;Duck Soup,&quot; where both Chicolini (Chico) and Pinky (Harpo) disguise themselves as Groucho, they are briefly seen applying the greasepaint, implicitly answering any question a viewer might have had about where he got his mustache and eyebrows.

Marx was asked to apply the greasepaint mustache once more for &quot;You Bet Your Life&quot; when it came to television, but he refused, opting instead to grow a real one, which he wore for the rest of his life. By this time, his eyesight had weakened enough for him to actually need corrective lenses; before then, his eyeglasses had merely been a stage prop. He debuted this new, and now much-older, appearance in &quot;Love Happy,&quot; the Marx Brothers&#x27;s last film as a comedy team.

Marx did paint the old character mustache over his real one on a few rare occasions, including a TV sketch with Jackie Gleason on the latter&#x27;s variety show in the 1960s (in which they performed a variation on the song &quot;Mister Gallagher and Mister Shean&quot;, co-written by Marx&#x27;s uncle Al Shean) and the 1968 Otto Preminger film &quot;Skidoo&quot;. In his late 70s at the time, Marx remarked on his appearance: &quot;I looked like I was embalmed.&quot; He played a mob boss called &quot;God&quot; and, according to Marx, &quot;both my performance and the film were God-awful!&quot;

The exaggerated walk, with one hand on the small of his back and his torso bent almost 90 degrees at the waist, was a parody of a fad from the 1880s and 1890s. Fashionable young men of the upper classes would affect a walk with their right hand held fast to the base of their spines, and with a slight lean forward at the waist and a very slight twist toward the right with the left shoulder, allowing the left hand to swing free with the gait. Edmund Morris, in his biography &quot;The Rise of Theodore Roosevelt&quot;, describes a young Roosevelt, newly elected to the State Assembly, walking into the House Chamber for the first time in this trendy, affected gait, somewhat to the amusement of the older and more rural members. Marx exaggerated this fad to a marked degree, and the comedic effect was enhanced by how out of date the fashion was by the 1940s and 1950s.

== Personal life ==

Marx&#x27;s three marriages ended in divorce. His first wife was chorus girl Ruth Johnson (m. 1920–1942). He was 29 and she was 19 at the time of their wedding. The couple had two children, Arthur Marx and Miriam Marx. His second wife was Kay Marvis (m. 1945–1951), née Catherine Dittig, former wife of Leo Gorcey. Marx was 54 and Kay was 21 at the time of their marriage. They had a daughter, Melinda Marx, whose daughter Jade Berti was formerly married to Dominic Ruiz, brother of Dina Eastwood. His third wife was actress Eden Hartford (m. 1954–1969). He was 64 and she was 24 at the time of their wedding.

During the early 1950s, Marx described his perfect woman: &quot;Someone who looks like Marilyn Monroe and talks like George S. Kaufman.&quot;

Marx was denied membership in an informal symphonietta of friends (including Harpo) organized by Ben Hecht, because he could play only the mandolin. When the group began its first rehearsal at Hecht&#x27;s home, Marx rushed in and demanded silence from the &quot;lousy amateurs&quot;. The musicians discovered him conducting the Los Angeles Symphony Orchestra in a performance of the overture to &quot;Tannhäuser&quot; in Hecht&#x27;s living room. Marx was allowed to join the symphonietta.

Later in life, Marx would sometimes note to talk show hosts, not entirely jokingly, that he was unable to actually insult anyone, because the target of his comment would assume that it was a Groucho-esque joke, and would laugh.
Despite his lack of formal education, he wrote many books, including his autobiography, &quot;Groucho and Me&quot;, (1959) and &quot;Memoirs of a Mangy Lover&quot; (1963). He was a friend of such literary figures as Booth Tarkington, T. S. Eliot, and Carl Sandburg. Much of his personal correspondence with those and other figures is featured in the book &quot;The Groucho Letters&quot; (1967) with an introduction and commentary on the letters written by Marx, who donated his letters to the Library of Congress. His daughter Miriam published a collection of his letters to her in 1992 titled &quot;Love, Groucho.&quot;

In &quot;Life with Groucho: A Son&#x27;s Eye View&quot;, Arthur Marx relates that in his latter years, Groucho increasingly referred to himself by the name Hackenbush, referring to the character of that name he played in &quot;A Day at the Races&quot;.

Marx made serious efforts to learn to play the guitar. In the 1932 film &quot;Horse Feathers&quot;, he performs the film&#x27;s love theme &quot;Everyone Says I Love You&quot; for costar Thelma Todd on a Gibson L-5.

In July 1937, an America-vs.-England pro-celebrity tennis doubles match was organized, featuring Marx and Ellsworth Vines playing against Charlie Chaplin and Fred Perry, to open the new clubhouse at the Beverly Hills Tennis Club. Marx appeared on court with twelve rackets and a suitcase, leaving Chaplin—who took tennis seriously—bemused, before he asked what was in it. Marx asked Chaplin what was in his, with Chaplin responding he didn&#x27;t have one. Marx replied, &quot;What kind of tennis player are you?&quot; After playing only a few games, Marx sat on the court and unpacked an elaborate picnic lunch from his suitcase.

Irving Berlin quipped: &quot;The world would not be in such a snarl, had Marx been Groucho instead of Karl.&quot; In his book &quot;The Groucho Phile&quot;, Marx says &quot;I&#x27;ve been a liberal Democrat all my life&quot;, and &quot;I frankly find Democrats a better, more sympathetic crowd... I&#x27;ll continue to believe that Democrats have a greater regard for the common man than Republicans do&quot;. However, during an episode of &quot;Firing Line&quot; on July 7, 1967, Marx admitted to voting for Wendell Willkie, the Republican candidate for president in 1940, over Franklin D. Roosevelt, stating that he did not believe that any man should run for more than two terms. Marx mentioned in a television interview that he disliked the women&#x27;s liberation movement.

== Later years ==
===&quot;You Bet Your Life&quot;===

Marx&#x27;s radio career was not as successful as his work on stage and in film, though historians such as Gerald Nachman and Michael Barson suggest that, in the case of the single-season &quot;Flywheel, Shyster, and Flywheel&quot; (1932), the failure may have been a combination of a poor time slot and the Marx Brothers&#x27; returning to Hollywood to make another film.

By the mid-1940s, Marx was experiencing a depressing lull in his career. His radio show &quot;Blue Ribbon Town&quot; had failed; Irving Brecher was unable to find a sponsor for his proposed radio sitcom &quot;The Flotsam Family&quot; created for Marx, only to see it become a huge hit revamped as &quot;The Life of Riley&quot; starring William Bendix in the title role. By that time, the Marx Brothers as film performers had officially retired.

Marx was scheduled to appear on a radio show with Bob Hope. Annoyed that he was made to wait in the green room for 40 minutes, he went on the air in a foul mood. Hope began by saying &quot;Why, Groucho Marx! Groucho, what are you doing out here in the desert?&quot; Marx retorted, &quot;Huh, desert, I&#x27;ve been sitting in the dressing room for forty minutes! Some desert alright ...&quot;. Marx continued to ignore the script, ad-libbing at length, and took it well beyond its allotted time slot.

Listening in on the show was producer John Guedel, who had a brainstorm. He approached Marx about doing a quiz show, to which Marx derisively retorted, &quot;A quiz show? Only actors who are completely washed up resort to a quiz show!&quot; Undeterred, Guedel proposed that the quiz would be only a backdrop for Marx&#x27;s interviews of people, and the storm of ad-libbing that they would elicit. Marx replied, &quot;Well, I&#x27;ve had no success in radio, and I can&#x27;t hold on to a sponsor. At this point, I&#x27;ll try anything!&quot;

&quot;You Bet Your Life&quot; debuted in October 1947 on ABC radio (which aired it from 1947 to 1949), sponsored by costume jewelry manufacturer Allen Gellman; and then on CBS (1949–50), and finally NBC. The show was on radio only from 1947 to 1950; on both radio and television from 1950 to 1960; and on television only, from 1960 to 1961. The show proved a huge hit, being one of the most popular on television by the mid-1950s, garnering a number one rating in 1953. With George Fenneman as his announcer and straight man, Marx entertained his audiences with rapier wit and improvised conversation with his guests. Since &quot;You Bet Your Life&quot; was mostly ad-libbed and unscripted — although writers did pre-interview the guests and feed Marx ready-made lines in advance — the producers insisted that the network prerecord it instead of it being broadcast live. There were three reasons for this: prerecording provided Marx with time to fish around for funny exchanges, any intervening dead spots could be edited out; and most importantly to protect the network from what was considered risqué, since Marx was a notorious loose cannon and known to say almost anything. The television show ran for 11 seasons until it was canceled in 1961. Ironically longtime major sponsor, automobile &quot;marque&quot; DeSoto went out of business for declining sales that same year. For the DeSoto ads, Marx would sometimes say: &quot;Tell &#x27;em Groucho sent you&quot;, or &quot;Try a DeSoto before you decide.&quot; In the mid-1970s, episodes of the show were syndicated and rebroadcast as &quot;The Best of Groucho&quot;.

The program&#x27;s theme music was an instrumental version of &quot;Hooray for Captain Spaulding&quot;, which became increasingly identified as Marx&#x27;s personal theme song. A recording of the song with Marx and the Ken Lane singers with an orchestra directed by Victor Young was released in 1952. Another recording made by Marx during this period was &quot;The Funniest Song in the World&quot;, released on the Young People&#x27;s Records label in 1949. It was a series of five original children&#x27;s songs with a connecting narrative about a monkey and his fellow zoo creatures.

One of Marx&#x27;s most oft-quoted remarks may have occurred during a 1947 radio episode. Marx was interviewing Charlotte Story, who had borne 20 children. When Marx asked why she had chosen to raise such a large family, Mrs. Story is said to have replied, &quot;I love my husband,&quot; to which Marx responded, &quot;I love my cigar, but I take it out of my mouth once in a while.&quot; The remark was judged too risqué to be aired, according to the anecdote, and was edited out before broadcast. Charlotte Story and her husband Marion, indeed parents of 20 children, were real people who appeared on the program. Audio recordings of the interview exist, and a reference to cigars is made (&quot;With each new kid, do you go around passing out cigars?&quot;), but there is no evidence of the claimed remark. &quot;I get credit all the time for things I never said,&quot; Marx told Roger Ebert in 1972. &quot;You know that line in &quot;You Bet Your Life&quot;? The guy says he has seventeen kids and I say, &#x27;I smoke a cigar, but I take it out of my mouth occasionally&#x27;? I never said that.&quot; Marx&#x27;s 1976 memoir recounts the episode as fact, but co-writer Hector Arce relied mostly on sources other than Marx himself—who was by then in his mid eighties, in ill health and mentally compromised—and was probably unaware that Marx had specifically denied making the observation. Head writer Bernie Smith recalled in a 1996 interview that the remark was indeed made—but again, well after the fact.

In 1946, as part of the marketing campaign for the Marx Brothers film &quot;A Night in Casablanca&quot;, Marx created a storyline that Warner Bros. Pictures threatened to sue him, contending that that title was too similar to their 1942 film &quot;Casablanca&quot;. Groucho wrote open letters &quot;responding&quot; to the four Warner brothers, including one in which he questions their own use of various words, such as: wondering if &quot;in 1471, Ferdinand Balboa Warner, your great-great-grandfather... stumbled on the shores of Africa and... named it Casablanca&quot;; suggesting that &quot;[David] Burbank&#x27;s survivors aren&#x27;t too happy with the fact that&quot; Warner Bros. Burbank, California studios are called their &quot;Burbank studios&quot;; and even suggesting a Marx Brothers legal action addressing &quot;What about &#x27;Warner Brothers&#x27;? ... Professionally, we were brothers long before you were.&quot;

=== Other work ===
On August 5, 1948, Marx&#x27;s comedy play &quot;April Fool&quot; premiered at the Lobero Theatre in Santa Barbara, California, to mediocre reviews. Penned by Groucho Marx and Norman Krasna, the play was rewritten and retitled &quot;Time for Elizabeth&quot;, and opened at the Fulton Theatre in New York City on September 27, 1948, where it closed after only eight performances. 

By the time &quot;You Bet Your Life&quot; debuted on TV on October 5, 1950, Marx had grown a real mustache (which he had already sported earlier in the films &quot;Copacabana&quot; and &quot;Love Happy&quot;).

During a tour of Germany in 1958, accompanied by then-wife Eden, daughter Melinda, Robert Dwan and Dwan&#x27;s daughter Judith, he climbed a pile of rubble that marked the site of Adolf Hitler&#x27;s bunker, the site of Hitler&#x27;s death, and performed a two-minute Charleston. He later remarked to Richard J. Anobile in &quot;The Marx Brothers Scrapbook,&quot; &quot;Not much satisfaction after he killed six million Jews!&quot;
In 1960, Marx, a lifelong devotee of the comic operas of Gilbert and Sullivan, appeared as Ko-Ko, the Lord High Executioner, in a televised production of &quot;The Mikado&quot; on NBC&#x27;s &quot;The Bell Telephone Hour&quot;. A clip of this is in rotation on Classic Arts Showcase.

Another TV show, &quot;Tell It to Groucho&quot;, premiered January 11, 1962, on CBS, but only lasted five months. On October 1, 1962, Marx, after acting as occasional guest host of &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; during the six-month interval between Jack Paar and Johnny Carson, introduced Carson as the new host.

In 1964, Marx starred in the &quot;Time for Elizabeth&quot; episode of &quot;Bob Hope Presents the Chrysler Theatre&quot;, a truncated version of a play that he and Norman Krasna wrote in 1948.

In 1965, Marx starred in a weekly show for British TV titled &quot;Groucho&quot;, broadcast on ITV. The program was along similar lines to &quot;You Bet Your Life&quot;, with Keith Fordyce taking on the Fenneman role. However, it was poorly received and lasted only 11 weeks.

Marx appeared as a gangster named God in the comedy movie &quot;Skidoo&quot; (1968), directed by Otto Preminger, and starring Jackie Gleason and Carol Channing. It was released by the studio where the Marx Brothers began their film career, Paramount Pictures. The film received almost universally negative reviews. Writer Paul Krassner published a story in the February 1981 issue of &quot;High Times&quot;, relating how Marx prepared for the LSD-themed movie by taking a dose of the drug in Krassner&#x27;s company, and had a moving, largely pleasant experience.

Marx developed friendships with rock star Alice Cooper—the two were photographed together for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine—and television host Dick Cavett, becoming a frequent guest on Cavett&#x27;s late-night talk show, even appearing in a one-man, 90-minute interview. When Elton John was visiting California in 1972, he and Marx became friendly. Marx insisted on calling him &quot;John Elton&quot;. According to writer Philip Norman, when Elton John was playing the piano at Marx&#x27;s home, Marx jokingly pointed his index fingers as if holding a pair of six-shooters; John put up his hands and said, &quot;Don&#x27;t shoot me, I&#x27;m only the piano player,&quot; thereby giving him the title of the album he had just completed. A film poster for the Marx Bros. film &quot;Go West&quot; is visible on the album cover photograph as an homage to Marx. Elton John accompanied Marx to a performance of &quot;Jesus Christ Superstar&quot;. As the lights went down, Marx called out, &quot;Does it have a happy ending?&quot; And during the Crucifixion scene, he declared, &quot;This is sure to offend the Jews.&quot;

Marx&#x27;s previous work regained popularity; new books of transcribed conversations were published by Richard J. Anobile and Charlotte Chandler. In a BBC interview in 1975, Marx called his greatest achievement having a book selected for cultural preservation in the Library of Congress. In a Cavett interview in 1971, Marx said being published in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; under his own name, Julius Henry Marx, meant more than all the plays he appeared in.For a man who had little formal education, to have his writings declared culturally important was a point of great satisfaction.

As he passed his 81st birthday in October of 1971, Marx became increasingly frail, physically and mentally, as a result of a succession of minor strokes and other health issues. In 1972, largely at the behest of his companion Erin Fleming, Marx appeared in a live one-man show at Carnegie Hall that was later released as a double album, &quot;An Evening with Groucho&quot;, on A&amp;M Records. He also made an appearance in 1973 on a short-lived variety show hosted by Bill Cosby. Fleming&#x27;s influence on Marx was controversial. Some close to Marx believed that she did much to revive his popularity, and the relationship with a younger woman boosted his ego and vitality. Others described her as a Svengali, exploiting an increasingly frail Marx in pursuit of her own acting career. Marx&#x27;s children, particularly his son Arthur, felt strongly that Fleming was pushing their ailing father beyond his physical and mental limits. Writer Mark Evanier concurred.

On April 2, 1974, at the 46th annual Academy Awards, Jack Lemmon presented Marx with an honorary Oscar to a standing ovation. The award honored Harpo, Chico, and Zeppo as well: &quot;in recognition of his brilliant creativity and for the unequalled achievements of the Marx Brothers in the art of motion picture comedy&quot;. Noticeably frail, Marx took a bow for his deceased brothers, saying that &quot;I wish that Harpo and Chico could be here to share with me this great honor.&quot; (Zeppo, still alive, was in the audience). He also praised the late Margaret Dumont as a great straight woman who never understood any of his jokes. Marx&#x27;s final appearance was a brief sketch with George Burns in the Bob Hope television special &quot;Joys&quot; (a parody of the 1975 movie &quot;Jaws&quot;) in March 1976. His health continued to decline the following year; when his younger brother Gummo died at age 83 on April 21, 1977, Marx was never told for fear of eliciting still further deterioration of his health.

Marx maintained his irrepressible sense of humor to the very end, however. George Fenneman, his radio and TV announcer, good-natured foil, and lifelong friend, often related a story of one of his final visits to Marx&#x27;s home: When the time came to end the visit, Fenneman lifted Marx from his wheelchair, put his arms around his torso, and began to &quot;walk&quot; the frail comedian backwards across the room towards his bed. As he did, he heard a weak voice in his ear: &quot;Fenneman,&quot; whispered Marx, &quot;you always were a lousy dancer.&quot; When a nurse approached him with a thermometer during his final hospitalization, explaining that she wanted to see if he had a temperature, he responded, &quot;Don&#x27;t be silly—everybody has a temperature.&quot; Actor Elliott Gould recalled a similar incident: &quot;I recall the last time I saw Groucho, he was in the hospital, and he had tubes in his nose and what have you,&quot; he said. &quot;And when he saw me, he was weak, but he was there; and he put his fingers on the tubes and played them like it was a clarinet. Groucho played the tubes for me, which brings me to tears.&quot;

== Death ==

Marx was hospitalized at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center with pneumonia on June 22, 1977, and died there nearly two months later at the age of 86 on August 19, four months after Gummo&#x27;s death. Media coverage of Groucho&#x27;s death and legacy was largely overshadowed by the unexpected death of Elvis Presley three days earlier.

Marx&#x27;s body was cremated and the ashes are interred in the Eden Memorial Park Cemetery in Los Angeles. He was survived by his three children and younger brother Zeppo, who outlived him by two years. His gravestone bears no epitaph but in one of his last interviews he suggested one: &quot;Excuse me, I can&#x27;t stand up.&quot;

Litigation over his estate lasted into the 1980s. Eventually, his three children were awarded the bulk of the estate, while Erin Fleming, his companion during his final years, was ordered to repay $472,000.

== Legacy ==

Groucho Marx was considered the most recognizable of the Marx Brothers. Groucho-like characters and references have appeared in popular culture both during and after his life, some aimed at audiences who may never have seen a Marx Brothers movie. Marx&#x27;s trademark eyeglasses, nose, mustache, and cigar have become icons of comedy—glasses with fake noses and mustaches (referred to as &quot;Groucho glasses&quot;, &quot;nose-glasses,&quot; and other names) are sold by novelty and costume shops around the world.

The cover of The Firesign Theatre&#x27;s 1969 album, &quot;How Can You Be in Two Places at Once When You&#x27;re Not Anywhere at All&quot;, subtitled &quot;All Hail Marx and Lennon&quot;, features images of Groucho Marx and John Lennon.

Nat Perrin, close friend of Groucho Marx and writer of several Marx Brothers films, inspired John Astin&#x27;s portrayal of Gomez Addams on the 1960s TV series &quot;The Addams Family&quot; with similarly thick mustache, eyebrows, sardonic remarks, backward logic, and ever-present cigar (pulled from his breast pocket already lit).

&quot;Minnie&#x27;s Boys&quot;, a 1970 Broadway musical, focused on the younger years of Marx (played by Lewis J. Stadlen), his brothers, and his mother (played by Shelley Winters). Marx received credit as the show&#x27;s advisor and appeared on &quot;The Dick Cavett Show&quot; to promote the production. 
In 1972, at Cannes, Marx was made a Commander in the French Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, an honor he was very proud of.

A meeting with Elton John led to a press photo of Marx pointing both of his index fingers and thumbs at Elton like revolvers. John&#x27;s spontaneous response of holding up his hands and replying, &quot;Don&#x27;t shoot me! I&#x27;m only the piano player!&quot; was so amusing that Elton John reused it as the title of a 1973 album. An added Marx homage was that a poster for the Marx Brothers&#x27; movie &quot;Go West&quot; was included on the cover art.

Marx was also known to influence the Warner Bros. cartoon character Bugs Bunny, who recited his famous line &quot;Of course you realize this means war!&quot; in several cartoons including &quot;Long-Haired Hare&quot; and &quot;Bully for Bugs&quot;, after his antagonist has offended him.

Two albums by British rock band Queen, &quot;A Night at the Opera&quot; (1975) and &quot;A Day at the Races&quot; (1976), are named after Marx Brothers films. In March 1977, Marx invited Queen to visit him in his Los Angeles home; there they performed &quot;&#x27;39&quot; a cappella.

A long-running ad campaign for Vlasic Pickles features an animated stork that imitates Marx&#x27;s mannerisms and voice. On the famous Hollywood Sign in California, one of the &quot;O&quot;s is dedicated to Marx. Alice Cooper contributed over $27,000 to remodel the sign, in memory of his friend.

Actor Frank Ferrante has performed as Groucho Marx on stage since 1986. He continues to tour under rights granted by the Marx family in a show entitled &quot;An Evening with Groucho&quot; in theaters throughout the United States and Canada with supporting actors and piano accompanist Jim Furmston. In the late 1980s, Ferrante starred as Marx in the off-Broadway and London show &quot;&quot;, penned by Marx&#x27;s son Arthur. Ferrante portrayed the comedian from age 15 to 85. The show was later filmed for PBS in 2001. In 1982, Gabe Kaplan filmed a version of the same show, entitled &quot;Groucho&quot;.

In the Hungarian dubbed version of Woody Allen&#x27;s film &quot;Annie Hall&quot;, a famous quotation told by Alvy Singer (Allen) at the beginning of the film is not attributed to Groucho Marx as in the original, but to Buster Keaton. The reason was that in communist Hungary, the name &#x27;Marx&#x27; was associated with Karl Marx, and the name was not allowed to be used in such a light, humorous context.

Woody Allen&#x27;s 1996 musical &quot;Everyone Says I Love You&quot;, in addition to being named for one of Marx&#x27;s signature songs, ends with a Groucho-themed New Year&#x27;s Eve party in Paris, which some of the stars, including Allen and Goldie Hawn, attend in full Groucho costume. The highlight of the scene is an ensemble song-and-dance performance of &quot;Hooray for Captain Spaulding&quot;—done entirely in French.

In 2008, &quot;Minnie&#x27;s Boys&quot; was remounted Off-Broadway with Erik Liberman as Groucho and Pamela Myers as Minnie Marx. Liberman later played Marx in a musical based on &quot;Flywheel, Shyster, and Flywheel&quot; called &quot;The Most Ridiculous Thing You Ever Hoid&quot; (2010) and at the Obama White House.

Groucho, a supporting character in the Italian horror comics series &quot;Dylan Dog&quot;, is a Groucho Marx impersonator whose character became his permanent personality, and he works with Dylan Dog as his professional sidekick. In the English-language version by Dark Horse Comics, to avoid legal complications regarding Groucho Marx&#x27;s estate, the art was altered so that Groucho no longer sports the Marx brother&#x27;s signature moustache, and was renamed &quot;Felix&quot;.

Throughout the &quot;M*A*S*H&quot; television series, several Groucho homage traits are mirrored in Alan Alda&#x27;s portrayal of Hawkeye, including the 1972 season one episode &quot;Yankee Doodle Doctor&quot; that had a full Groucho impression complete with moustache, cigar and glasses.

In 2023, notable artist William Kentridge included a drawing of Marx in his solo museum exhibition at The Broad in Los Angeles.

<text>The (GBA) is a 32-bit handheld game console, manufactured by Nintendo, which was released in Japan on March 21, 2001, and to international markets that June. It was later released in mainland China in 2004, under the name iQue Game Boy Advance&quot;.&quot; Compared to the Game Boy Color it succeeded, the console offered a significantly more powerful ARM7 processor and improved graphics, while retaining backward compatibility with games initially developed for its predecessor.

The GBA is part of the sixth generation of video game consoles. The original model was followed in 2003 by the Game Boy Advance SP, a redesigned model with a frontlit screen and clamshell form factor. A newer revision of the SP with a backlit screen was released in 2005. A miniaturized redesign, the Game Boy Micro, was released in September 2005.

By June 2010, the Game Boy Advance series had sold 81.51 million units worldwide. Its successor, the Nintendo DS, launched in November 2004, was backward compatible with GBA games. The GBA was officially discontinued by the end of 2010.

==History==

=== Project Atlantis ===
When the original Game Boy launched in 1989, many questioned Nintendo’s decision to release a monochrome handheld console, when competitors like the Lynx and Game Gear boasted color screens. However, Nintendo&#x27;s gamble paid off. The rivals&#x27; color displays, while visually impressive, were criticized for their poor battery life and bulky size, while the Game Boy’s superior portability and battery longevity propelled it to immense popularity. 

Publicly, Nintendo pledged to develop a color version of the Game Boy only when the technology overcame the limitations of existing color handhelds. Internally, however, a team led by Satoru Okada—who had worked on the original Game Boy—was already experimenting with color screens. Their early 1990s prototype, codenamed &quot;Project Atlantis,&quot; featured a color display and a 32-bit processor designed by ARM. Despite the promising technology, the team was not satisfied with the outcome the project was shelved by 1997.

However, as competitors such as the Neo Geo Pocket and WonderSwan entered the market, Nintendo decided to create a color version of the Game Boy by combining the color screen they had been testing for Project Atlantis with a faster version of the existing Game Boy&#x27;s 8-bit processor. The Game Boy Color launched in 1998.

=== Game Boy Advance ===
Still under pressure from its competitors more technically advanced handhelds, Nintendo quickly started developing a successor to the Game Boy Color. The project, codenamed Advanced Game Boy (AGB), would bring the 32-bit processing power envisioned in Project Atlantis to market. Details about the GBA emerged at the Space World trade show in late August 1999.

Nintendo officially announced the Game Boy Advance on September 1, 1999, revealing details about the system&#x27;s specifications and teasing that the handheld would first be released in Japan in August 2000, with the North American and European launch dates slated for the end of the same year. On August 21, 2000, IGN showed images of a GBA development kit running a demonstrational port of &quot;Yoshi&#x27;s Story&quot;, and on August 22, pre-production images of the GBA were revealed in &quot;Famitsu&quot; magazine in Japan. 

The GBA’s design featured a landscape form factor, diverging from the portrait layout of the previous Game Boy models. The design put the buttons to the sides of the device instead of below the screen. The shift was the work of French designer Gwénaël Nicolas and his Tokyo-based studio, Curiosity Inc.

In a August 24, 2000 announcement, Nintendo revealed the final design of the GBA to the public, announced its Japan and North America launch dates, and revealed the ten launch games. At Space World 2000, Nintendo also showcased several peripherals, including the GBA link cable, the GameCube – GBA link cable, a rechargeable battery pack, and an infrared communication adaptor. By March 2001, Nintendo confirmed the $99.99 price and announced 15 launch games for the system, with over 60 expected by the end of the year.

All Game Boy Advance models were discontinued in the Americas in 2008, and globally by the end of 2010.

== Hardware ==

The Game Boy Advance uses a custom system on a chip (SoC), integrating the CPU and other major components into a single package, named the &quot;CPU AGB&quot; by Nintendo. Manufactured by the Sharp Corporation, the SoC contains two processors: the &quot;ARM7TDMI&quot; running at a clock rate of 16.776 megahertz (MHz) for GBA games, and the &quot;Sharp SM83&quot; running at 4.194 MHz or 8.389 MHz for backward compatibility with Game Boy and Game Boy Color games. The system operates in two modes: GBA mode using the ARM7TDMI, and the backward-compatible CGB mode using the SM83.

The ARM7TDMI is a combined 16-bit and 32-bit RISC processor with an ARM architecture designed to maximize performance under power and storage constraints, making it more suitable for use in a handheld device. The system has sixteen 32-bit registers, a 32-bit bus to 32k of &quot;CPU Internal Working RAM&quot; and 16-bit busses to 256k of &quot;CPU External Working RAM&quot; and the &quot;Game Pak&quot; (game cartridge). In addition to the 32-bit ARM instruction set, the CPU also implements a 16-bit THUMB instruction set, which is used when executing instructions over the 16-bit busses.

The SM83 is a hybrid between two other 8-bit processors: the Intel 8080 and the Zilog Z80. The SM83 has the seven 8-bit registers of the 8080 (lacking the alternate registers of the Z80) but uses the Z80&#x27;s programming syntax and extra bit manipulation instructions, along with adding new instructions to optimize the processor for certain operations related to the way the hardware was arranged. Like the Game Boy Color, the SM83 in the Advance could be commanded to operate at either 4.194 MHz when playing games compatible with the original Game Boy or at 8.389 MHz when playing games designed for the Game Boy Color. The SoC also contains a 2 KB &quot;bootstrap&quot; ROM which is used to start up the device in CGB mode.

The CPU CGB incorporates an updated version of Nintendo&#x27;s venerable &quot;Picture Processing Unit&quot; (PPU), which was used in the Game Boy, Game Boy Color, and Super Nintendo Entertainment System. The PPU is essentially a basic GPU that renders visuals using 96 kilobyte (KB) of Video RAM located inside the CPU CGB. Inside the PPU itself is 1 KB of object attribute memory and 1 KB of palette RAM, which are optimized for fast rendering. The display itself is a 2.9-inch (diagonal) thin-film transistor (TFT) color liquid-crystal display (LCD), measuring wide by high. The screen is 240 pixels wide by 160 pixels high in a 3:2 aspect ratio. 

Foreground objects are sprites with up to 128 per frame, sized from 8×8 to 64×64 pixels, and with 16 or 256 colors. Backgrounds can be rendered in one of six different modes. The first three are the &quot;character modes,&quot; which use traditional tile map graphics: Mode 0 offers four static layers, Mode 1 has three layers with one affine transformation layer (which can be rotated and/or scaled), and Mode 2 has two affine layers. The other three are the &quot;bitmap modes&quot; which allow for rendering 3D geometry: Mode 3 has a single full-sized, fully-colored (32,768 colors) frame, Mode 4 provides two full-sized frames with 256 colors each, and Mode 5 provides two half-sized (160×128 pixels), fully-colored frames. Having two bitmaps allows &quot;page-flipping&quot; to avoid the artifacts that can sometimes appear when re-drawing a bitmap. While the bitmap modes were considered cutting-edge, most games avoided using them because they cost a lot of CPU resources.

For sound, the Game Boy Advance features two PCM sample player channels, which work in combination with the &quot;Audio Processing Unit&quot; (APU), a programmable sound generator first used by the legacy Game Boy. The APU has four channels: a pulse wave generation channel with frequency and volume variation, a second pulse wave generation channel with only volume variation, a wave channel that can reproduce any waveform recorded in RAM, and a white noise channel with volume variation.

The Game Boy Advance features a D-pad (directional pad) and six action buttons labeled &#x27;A,&#x27; &#x27;B,&#x27; &#x27;L,&#x27; &#x27;R,&#x27; &#x27;SELECT,&#x27; and &#x27;START.&#x27; The top of the console has a link port that allows it to be connected to other Game Boy devices using a Game Link Cable or a Wireless Adapter, or the GameCube home console with a special GameCube – Game Boy Advance link cable.

=== Technical specifications ===
=== Color variants ===
The Game Boy Advance was available in numerous colors and limited editions throughout its production. It was initially available in Arctic, Black, Orange (Japan Only), Fuchsia (translucent pink), Glacier (translucent blue), and Indigo. Later in the system&#x27;s lifespan, additional colors and special editions were released, including: Red, Clear Orange/Black, Platinum, White, Gold (Japan Only), Hello Kitty edition (pink with Hello Kitty and logo on bezel), &quot;The King of Fighters&quot; edition (black with images on bezel and buttons), &quot;Chobits&quot; edition (translucent light blue, with images on bezel and buttons), &quot;Battle Network Rockman EXE 2&quot; (light blue with images on bezel), &quot;Mario Bros.&quot; edition (Glacier with Mario and Luigi on bezel), and Yomiuri Giants edition (Glacier with images on bezel).

Several &quot;Pokémon&quot;-themed limited-edition systems were made available in Pokémon Center stores in Japan. These editions include: Gold Pokémon edition (Gold with Pikachu and Pichu on bezel), Suicune edition (blue/grey with greyscale Pikachu and Pichu on bezel, and a Pokémon Center sticker on the back), Celebi edition (olive green with Celebi images on bezel), and Latias/Latios edition (pink/red and purple, with images of Latias and Latios on bezel).

==Games==

With hardware performance comparable to the Super Nintendo Entertainment System, the Game Boy Advance represents progress for sprite-based technology. The system&#x27;s library includes platformers, SNES-like role-playing video games, and games ported from various 8-bit and 16-bit systems of the previous generations. This includes the &quot;Super Mario Advance&quot; series, and the system&#x27;s backward compatibility with all earlier Game Boy titles. Though most GBA games primarily employ 2D graphics, developers have ambitiously designed some 3D GBA games that push the limits of the hardware, including first-person shooters like a port of &quot;Doom&quot;, racing games like &quot;V-Rally 3&quot;, and even platformers, like &quot;Asterix &amp; Obelix XXL&quot;.

Some cartridges are colored to resemble the game (usually for the &quot;Pokémon&quot; series; &quot;Pokémon Emerald&quot;, for example, being a clear emerald green). Others have special built-in features, including rumble features (&quot;Drill Dozer&quot;), tilt sensors (&quot;&quot;, &quot;Yoshi&#x27;s Universal Gravitation&quot;), and solar sensors (&quot;Boktai&quot;).

In Japan, the final game to be released on the system was &quot;Final Fantasy VI Advance&quot; on November 30, 2006, which was also the final game published by Nintendo on the system. In North America, the last game for the system was &quot;Samurai Deeper Kyo&quot;, released on February 12, 2008. In Europe, the last game for the system is &quot;The Legend of Spyro: The Eternal Night&quot;, released on November 2, 2007. The Japan-only &quot;Rhythm Tengoku&quot;, the first game in what would eventually become known outside Japan as the &quot;Rhythm Heaven&quot;/&quot;Rhythm Paradise&quot; series, is the final first-party-developed game for the system, released on August 3, 2006.

While those games were the last to be released at the time, a new one is expected to release in 2025. Titled &quot;Shantae Advance: Risky Revolution&quot;, it was originally in development until 2004, when work halted due to the lack of a publisher. Development resumed in 2023, using the same code and hardware.

=== Launch games ===
In Japan there were 25 launch games, 17 in North America and 15 in Europe.
===Compatibility with other systems===

An add-on for the GameCube, known as the Game Boy Player, was released in 2003 as the successor to the Super Game Boy peripheral for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. This add-on allows Game Boy Advance, Game Boy, and Game Boy Color games to be played on the GameCube. However, some games may have compatibility issues due to certain features requiring extra hardware; for instance, &quot;&quot; would require the console to be rotated manually due to its nature as a tilt sensor game.

The GBA is the last Nintendo handheld system to bear the Game Boy name. Games developed for it are incompatible with older Game Boy systems, and each game&#x27;s box carries a label indicating that the game is &quot;not compatible with other Game Boy systems.&quot; Conversely, games designed for older Game Boy systems are compatible with the Game Boy Advance, with options to play such games on either their standard aspect ratios or a stretched fullscreen.

Game Boy Advance cartridges are compatible with Nintendo DS models that support them with a dedicated GBA cartridge slot beneath the touch screen (specifically the original model and the Nintendo DS Lite), although they do not support multiplayer or features involving the use of GBA accessories due to the absence of the GBA&#x27;s external peripheral port on the DS. They can also be used to unlock original content found in Nintendo DS games. The Nintendo DSi and Nintendo DSi XL lack a GBA cartridge slot, and therefore do not support backward compatibility with the GBA.

===Digital re-releases===
Since the Game Boy Advance was discontinued, many of its games have been re-released via digital distribution on later Nintendo consoles, mainly in the form of emulation. As part of an Ambassador Program for early adopters of the Nintendo 3DS system, ten GBA games, along with ten Nintendo Entertainment System games, were made available free for players who bought a 3DS system before the price drop on August 12, 2011. Unlike other Virtual Console games for the system, features such as the Home menu or save states are missing, since the games are running natively instead of via emulation. In January 2014, Nintendo President Satoru Iwata announced that Game Boy Advance games would be released on the Wii U&#x27;s Virtual Console in April 2014. The first set of GBA games, including &quot;Advance Wars&quot;, &quot;Metroid Fusion&quot;, and &quot;Mario &amp; Luigi: Superstar Saga&quot;, were released on April 3, 2014. All Virtual Console releases are single-player only, as they do not emulate multiplayer features enabled by Game Link cables.

In February 2023, Nintendo added Game Boy Advance games to its Nintendo Switch Online service, exclusively to those with the &quot;Expansion Pack&quot; tier. For the first time, players are able to play multiplayer games in their emulated form, online. This application emulates the Game Boy Player, meaning that games that support GameCube controller rumble work with the vibration of the Switch controllers.

==Accessories==
===Official===

Nintendo released various addons for the Game Boy Advance, which include:
* Wireless Adapter: Released in 2004, this adapter hooks up to the back of the Game Boy Advance. It replaces link cables and allows many people to link together. It was marketed for and came included with &quot;Pokémon FireRed&quot; and &quot;LeafGreen&quot;. Because it was released so late in the Game Boy Advance&#x27;s life, fewer than 20 games support this hardware. A special version was released for the Game Boy Micro, which has full compatibility with other models.
* Game Boy Advance Infra-Red Adapter: This adapter is only compatible with &quot;Cyberdrive Zoids&quot;, and was not sold separately. It is not compatible with the Game Boy Micro.
* GameCube – Game Boy Advance link cable: Used to connect the Game Boy Advance to the GameCube for interoperability between corresponding games, such as are &quot;Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles&quot;, &quot;Pac-Man Vs.&quot;, and &quot;The Legend of Zelda: Four Swords Adventures&quot;. The cable also enables using the handheld as a controller for select games.
* Play-Yan: The Play-Yan is an MP3/MPEG4 player for the Game Boy Advance and Nintendo DS. The cartridge is slightly broader than a normal Game Boy Advance cartridge and includes a built-in headphone port as well as an SD card slot. Music or videos that users have downloaded from the Internet can be transferred onto an SD card and slotted into the Play-Yan device. Nintendo released several mini-games for the Play-Yan that could be downloaded from their website, although this functionality was later removed through a firmware update. The Play-Yan was initially available in Japan only but was released in Europe as the Nintendo MP3 Player on December 8, 2006, with the MPEG4 functionality removed. The Play-Yan was never released in North America.
* e-Reader: The e-Reader is a scanning device that plugs into the game cartridge slot of the Game Boy Advance. It was released in Japan in December 2001, and North America in September 2002. Specialized cards with codes along the side and bottom are slid through the slot, scanning the card into the Game Boy Advance. e-Reader cards include classic games like &quot;Donkey Kong&quot; and &quot;Excitebike&quot; that can be scanned for play on the handheld. Other cards were released that unlock in-game content in compatible GBA titles such as &quot;Super Mario Advance 4: Super Mario Bros. 3&quot; and &quot;Pokémon Ruby&quot; and &quot;Sapphire&quot;, and in GameCube games like &quot;Animal Crossing&quot;. The &quot;Pokémon Trading Card Game&quot; playing cards also adopt the e-Reader codes. The e-Reader works with the Game Boy Player and Game Boy Advance SP, but cannot fit into the Nintendo DS&#x27;s Game Boy slot (however it can fit into the Nintendo DS Lite&#x27;s Game Boy slot).
* Game Boy Advance Video: First released in North America in May 2004, these cartridges included two episodes of thirty-minute cartoon programs such as &quot;Dragon Ball GT&quot;, &quot;Pokémon&quot;, &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants&quot;, &quot;Sonic X&quot;, &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot;, and &quot;Yu-Gi-Oh!&quot;. Three feature-length movies, &quot;Shrek&quot; (2001), &quot;Shrek 2&quot; (2004), and &quot;Shark Tale&quot; (2004) were also released for the format. These cartridges display an error when inserted into a GameCube via a Game Boy Player, to prevent users from attempting to record the episodes onto other media.
* Mobile Adapter GB: Connects the console to a mobile phone for remote play. It was released in Japan and was compatible with &quot;Pokémon Crystal&quot;.

===Unofficial===
Other accessories for the Game Boy Advance include:
* Afterburner: The Afterburner is an internal front-lighting system manufactured by Triton Labs and released in mid-2002. The installation consists of disassembling the system, removing some plastic from the interior of the case, attaching the lighting mechanism to the screen, and soldering two wires to the motherboard for power. Optionally, a potentiometer or an integrated circuit could be added to allow adjusting the brightness of the light. When the initial version of the Game Boy Advance SP was released, it included a very similar integrated lighting system. This was replaced in the subsequent version of the Game Boy Advance SP with a backlit display. According to Triton Labs, the Afterburner achieved considerable success during the lifespan of the GBA, with many gamers buying it. Though the kit voids the system&#x27;s warranty, the company had minor trouble keeping up with demand for the accessory during the 2002 holiday season.
* WormCam: This camera by Nyko attaches to the top of the Game Boy Advance and connects to the link port. The snapshots can then be uploaded to a computer with the USB cable and software.
* Glucoboy: This is a blood glucose monitor with built-in games released in Australia in 2007 for children with diabetes.

==Revisions==
===Game Boy Advance SP===
In early 2003, Nintendo introduced a new form-factor for the handheld, known as the Game Boy Advance SP (model AGS-001). The redesigned unit features a clamshell design that resembles a pocket-size laptop computer, including a folding case approximately one-half the size of the original unit. It has a rechargeable lithium-ion battery, a significantly brighter LCD screen, and an internal front-light that can be toggled on and off. The redesign was intended to address some common complaints about the original Game Boy Advance, which had been criticized for being somewhat uncomfortable to use, especially due to a dark screen.

====Backlit model (AGS-101)====

On September 19, 2005, Nintendo released a new version of the SP, model AGS-101, that features a brighter backlit display. The switch that controls the backlight now toggles between two brightness levels.

===Game Boy Micro===
In September 2005, Nintendo released a second redesign of the Game Boy Advance. This model, dubbed the Game Boy Micro, is similar in style to the original Game Boy Advance&#x27;s horizontal orientation, but is much smaller and sleeker. The Game Boy Micro allows the user to switch between several colored faceplates to allow customization, a feature which Nintendo advertised heavily around the Game Boy Micro&#x27;s launch. Nintendo also hoped that this &quot;fashion&quot; feature would help target audiences outside of typical video game players. Unlike the previous Game Boy Advance models, the Game Boy Micro is unable to support Game Boy and Game Boy Color titles. The Game Boy Micro did not make much of an impact in the video game market, as it was overshadowed by the Nintendo DS, which also played Game Boy Advance games through the GBA cartridge slot.

==Reception==
Upon its North American release, IGN praised the Game Boy Advance&#x27;s graphical capabilities and battery life, but criticized the system&#x27;s shoulder button placement and noted the system&#x27;s high price tag which &quot;may be a tad bit too high to swallow&quot;, ultimately scoring the system with an &quot;8.0&quot; out of 10. They also pointed out the system&#x27;s lack of a backlight which occasionally got in the way of playing games.
ABC News praised the Game Boy Advance&#x27;s graphics, grip, and larger screen, stating that &quot;You&#x27;ve never had as much fun playing old games.&quot;

Reviewing for CNET, Darren Gladstone scored the system with a 7.0 out of 10, praising its graphical performance and backward compatibility, but being considerably critical of the system&#x27;s lack of a backlit screen, noting that it makes it &quot;nearly impossible&quot; to play in normal lighting conditions. Gladstone ultimately recommended the sleeker and backlit Game Boy Advance SP instead, despite noting that the cheaper price of the original model may &quot;appeal to gamers on a lower budget.&quot;

ROM hacks, fan games, and Homebrew games are developed for the GBA.

===Sales===
Nintendo hoped to sell 1.1 million Game Boy Advance units by the end of March with the system&#x27;s Japanese debut, and anticipated sales of 24 million units before the end of 2001; many marketing analysts believed this to be a realistic goal due to the company&#x27;s lack of major competition in the handheld video game market. Within the first week of its North American launch in June, the Game Boy Advance sold 500,000 units, making it the fastest-selling video game console in the United States at the time. In response to strong sales, Nintendo ordered 100,000 units to ship to retail stores, hoping to ship another half million of them by the end of June. The Game Boy Advance also became the fastest-selling system in the United Kingdom, selling 81,000 units in its first week of release and beating the PlayStation 2&#x27;s previous record of 20,000 units. In 2004, the system&#x27;s sales in the United Kingdom surpassed one million units.

On December 1, 2006, Nintendo of America released launch-to-date information indicating that the company had sold 33.6 million units of the Game Boy Advance series in the United States. In a Kotaku article published on January 18, 2008, Nintendo revealed that the Game Boy Advance series had sold 36.2 million units in the United States, as of January 1, 2008. , 81.51 million units of the Game Boy Advance series have been sold worldwide, 43.57 million of which are Game Boy Advance SP units and 2.42 million of which are Game Boy Micro units.

<text>Google Search (also known simply as Google or Google.com) is a search engine operated by Google. It allows users to search for information on the Web by entering keywords or phrases. Google Search uses algorithms to analyze and rank websites based on their relevance to the search query. It is the most popular search engine worldwide.

Google Search is the most-visited website in the world. As of 2020, Google Search has a 92% share of the global search engine market. Approximately 26.75% of Google&#x27;s monthly global traffic comes from the United States, 4.44% from India, 4.4% from Brazil, 3.92% from the United Kingdom and 3.84% from Japan according to data provided by Similarweb.

The order of search results returned by Google is based, in part, on a priority rank system called &quot;PageRank&quot;. Google Search also provides many different options for customized searches, using symbols to include, exclude, specify or require certain search behavior, and offers specialized interactive experiences, such as flight status and package tracking, weather forecasts, currency, unit, and time conversions, word definitions, and more.

The main purpose of Google Search is to search for text in publicly accessible documents offered by web servers, as opposed to other data, such as images or data contained in databases. It was originally developed in 1996 by Larry Page, Sergey Brin, and Scott Hassan. The search engine would also be set up in the garage of Susan Wojcicki&#x27;s Menlo Park home. In 2011, Google introduced &quot;Google Voice Search&quot; to search for spoken, rather than typed, words. In 2012, Google introduced a semantic search feature named Knowledge Graph.

Analysis of the frequency of search terms may indicate economic, social and health trends. Data about the frequency of use of search terms on Google can be openly inquired via Google Trends and have been shown to correlate with flu outbreaks and unemployment levels, and provide the information faster than traditional reporting methods and surveys. As of mid-2016, Google&#x27;s search engine has begun to rely on deep neural networks.

In August 2024, a US judge in Virginia ruled that Google&#x27;s search engine held an illegal monopoly over Internet search. The court found that Google maintained its market dominance by paying large amounts to phone-makers and browser-developers to make Google its default search engine.

== Search indexing ==
Google indexes hundreds of terabytes of information from web pages. For websites that are currently down or otherwise not available, Google provides links to cached versions of the site, formed by the search engine&#x27;s latest indexing of that page. Additionally, Google indexes some file types, being able to show users PDFs, Word documents, Excel spreadsheets, PowerPoint presentations, certain Flash multimedia content, and plain text files. Users can also activate &quot;SafeSearch&quot;, a filtering technology aimed at preventing explicit and pornographic content from appearing in search results.

Despite Google search&#x27;s immense index, sources generally assume that Google is only indexing less than 5% of the total Internet, with the rest belonging to the deep web, inaccessible through its search tools.

In 2012, Google changed its search indexing tools to demote sites that had been accused of piracy. In October 2016, Gary Illyes, a webmaster trends analyst with Google, announced that the search engine would be making a separate, primary web index dedicated for mobile devices, with a secondary, less up-to-date index for desktop use. The change was a response to the continued growth in mobile usage, and a push for web developers to adopt a mobile-friendly version of their websites. In December 2017, Google began rolling out the change, having already done so for multiple websites.

=== &quot;Caffeine&quot; search architecture upgrade ===
In August 2009, Google invited web developers to test a new search architecture, codenamed &quot;Caffeine&quot;, and give their feedback. The new architecture provided no visual differences in the user interface, but added significant speed improvements and a new &quot;under-the-hood&quot; indexing infrastructure. The move was interpreted in some quarters as a response to Microsoft&#x27;s recent release of an upgraded version of its own search service, renamed Bing, as well as the launch of Wolfram Alpha, a new search engine based on &quot;computational knowledge&quot;. Google announced completion of &quot;Caffeine&quot; on June 8, 2010, claiming 50% fresher results due to continuous updating of its index.

With &quot;Caffeine&quot;, Google moved its back-end indexing system away from MapReduce and onto Bigtable, the company&#x27;s distributed database platform.

=== &quot;Medic&quot; search algorithm update ===
In August 2018, Danny Sullivan from Google announced a broad core algorithm update. As per current analysis done by the industry leaders Search Engine Watch and Search Engine Land, the update was to drop down the medical and health-related websites that were not user friendly and were not providing good user experience. This is why the industry experts named it &quot;Medic&quot;.

Google reserves very high standards for YMYL (Your Money or Your Life) pages. This is because misinformation can affect users financially, physically, or emotionally. Therefore, the update targeted particularly those YMYL pages that have low-quality content and misinformation. This resulted in the algorithm targeting health and medical-related websites more than others. However, many other websites from other industries were also negatively affected.

== Search results ==

=== Ranking of results ===

By 2012, it handled more than 3.5 billion searches per day. In 2013 the European Commission found that Google Search favored Google&#x27;s own products, instead of the best result for consumers&#x27; needs. In February 2015 Google announced a major change to its mobile search algorithm which would favor mobile friendly over other websites. Nearly 60% of Google searches come from mobile phones. Google says it wants users to have access to premium quality websites. Those websites which lack a mobile-friendly interface would be ranked lower and it is expected that this update will cause a shake-up of ranks. Businesses who fail to update their websites accordingly could see a dip in their regular websites traffic.

=== PageRank ===
Google&#x27;s rise was largely due to a patented algorithm called PageRank which helps rank web pages that match a given search string. When Google was a Stanford research project, it was nicknamed BackRub because the technology checks backlinks to determine a site&#x27;s importance. Other keyword-based methods to rank search results, used by many search engines that were once more popular than Google, would check how often the search terms occurred in a page, or how strongly associated the search terms were within each resulting page. The PageRank algorithm instead analyzes human-generated links assuming that web pages linked from many important pages are also important. The algorithm computes a recursive score for pages, based on the weighted sum of other pages linking to them. PageRank is thought to correlate well with human concepts of importance. In addition to PageRank, Google, over the years, has added many other secret criteria for determining the ranking of resulting pages. This is reported to comprise over 250 different indicators, the specifics of which are kept secret to avoid difficulties created by scammers and help Google maintain an edge over its competitors globally.

PageRank was influenced by a similar page-ranking and site-scoring algorithm earlier used for RankDex, developed by Robin Li in 1996. Larry Page&#x27;s patent for PageRank filed in 1998 includes a citation to Li&#x27;s earlier patent. Li later went on to create the Chinese search engine Baidu in 2000.

In a potential hint of Google&#x27;s future direction of their Search algorithm, Google&#x27;s then chief executive Eric Schmidt, said in a 2007 interview with the &quot;Financial Times&quot;: &quot;The goal is to enable Google users to be able to ask the question such as &#x27;What shall I do tomorrow?&#x27; and &#x27;What job shall I take?. Schmidt reaffirmed this during a 2010 interview with &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;: &quot;I actually think most people don&#x27;t want Google to answer their questions, they want Google to tell them what they should be doing next.&quot;

=== Google optimization ===
Because Google is the most popular search engine, many webmasters attempt to influence their website&#x27;s Google rankings. An industry of consultants has arisen to help websites increase their rankings on Google and other search engines. This field, called search engine optimization, attempts to discern patterns in search engine listings, and then develop a methodology for improving rankings to draw more searchers to their clients&#x27; sites. Search engine optimization encompasses both &quot;on page&quot; factors (like body copy, title elements, H1 heading elements and image alt attribute values) and Off Page Optimization factors (like anchor text and PageRank). The general idea is to affect Google&#x27;s relevance algorithm by incorporating the keywords being targeted in various places &quot;on page&quot;, in particular the title element and the body copy (note: the higher up in the page, presumably the better its keyword prominence and thus the ranking). Too many occurrences of the keyword, however, cause the page to look suspect to Google&#x27;s spam checking algorithms. Google has published guidelines for website owners who would like to raise their rankings when using legitimate optimization consultants. It has been hypothesized, and, allegedly, is the opinion of the owner of one business about which there have been numerous complaints, that negative publicity, for example, numerous consumer complaints, may serve as well to elevate page rank on Google Search as favorable comments. The particular problem addressed in &quot;The New York Times&quot; article, which involved DecorMyEyes, was addressed shortly thereafter by an undisclosed fix in the Google algorithm. According to Google, it was not the frequently published consumer complaints about DecorMyEyes which resulted in the high ranking but mentions on news websites of events which affected the firm such as legal actions against it. Google Search Console helps to check for websites that use duplicate or copyright content.

=== &quot;Hummingbird&quot; search algorithm upgrade ===

In 2013, Google significantly upgraded its search algorithm with &quot;Hummingbird&quot;. Its name was derived from the speed and accuracy of the hummingbird. The change was announced on September 26, 2013, having already been in use for a month. &quot;Hummingbird&quot; places greater emphasis on natural language queries, considering context and meaning over individual keywords. It also looks deeper at content on individual pages of a website, with improved ability to lead users directly to the most appropriate page rather than just a website&#x27;s homepage. The upgrade marked the most significant change to Google search in years, with more &quot;human&quot; search interactions and a much heavier focus on conversation and meaning. Thus, web developers and writers were encouraged to optimize their sites with natural writing rather than forced keywords, and make effective use of technical web development for on-site navigation.

=== Search results quality ===

In 2023, drawing on internal Google documents disclosed as part of the United States v. Google LLC (2020) antitrust case, technology reporters claimed that Google Search was &quot;bloated and overmonetized&quot; and that the &quot;semantic matching&quot; of search queries put advertising profits before quality. &quot;Wired&quot; withdrew Megan Gray&#x27;s piece after Google complained about alleged inaccuracies, while the author reiterated that «As stated in court, &quot;A goal of Project Mercury was to increase commercial queries&quot;».

In March 2024, Google announced a significant update to its core search algorithm and spam targeting, which is expected to wipe out 40 percent of all spam results. On March 20th, it was confirmed that the roll out of the spam update was complete.

=== Shopping search ===
On September 10, 2024, the European-based EU Court of Justice found that Google held an illegal monopoly with the way the company showed favoritism to its shopping search, and could not avoid paying €2.4 billion. The EU Court of Justice referred to Google&#x27;s treatment of rival shopping searches as &quot;discriminatory&quot; and in violation of the Digital Markets Act.

==Interface==
=== Page layout ===
At the top of the search page, the approximate result count and the response time two digits behind decimal is noted. Of search results, page titles and URLs, dates, and a preview text snippet for each result appears. Along with web search results, sections with images, news, and videos may appear. The length of the previewed text snipped was experimented with in 2015 and 2017.

=== Universal search ===
&quot;Universal search&quot; was launched by Google on May 16, 2007, as an idea that merged the results from different kinds of search types into one. Prior to Universal search, a standard Google search would consist of links only to websites. Universal search, however, incorporates a wide variety of sources, including websites, news, pictures, maps, blogs, videos, and more, all shown on the same search results page. Marissa Mayer, then-vice president of search products and user experience, described the goal of Universal search as &quot;we&#x27;re attempting to break down the walls that traditionally separated our various search properties and integrate the vast amounts of information available into one simple set of search results.

In June 2017, Google expanded its search results to cover available job listings. The data is aggregated from various major job boards and collected by analyzing company homepages. Initially only available in English, the feature aims to simplify finding jobs suitable for each user.

=== Rich snippets ===
In May 2009, Google announced that they would be parsing website microformats to populate search result pages with &quot;Rich snippets&quot;. Such snippets include additional details about results, such as displaying reviews for restaurants and social media accounts for individuals.

In May 2016, Google expanded on the &quot;Rich snippets&quot; format to offer &quot;Rich cards&quot;, which, similarly to snippets, display more information about results, but shows them at the top of the mobile website in a swipeable carousel-like format. Originally limited to movie and recipe websites in the United States only, the feature expanded to all countries globally in 2017.

=== Knowledge Graph ===

The Knowledge Graph is a knowledge base used by Google to enhance its search engine&#x27;s results with information gathered from a variety of sources. This information is presented to users in a box to the right of search results. Knowledge Graph boxes were added to Google&#x27;s search engine in May 2012, starting in the United States, with international expansion by the end of the year. The information covered by the Knowledge Graph grew significantly after launch, tripling its original size within seven months, and being able to answer &quot;roughly one-third&quot; of the 100 billion monthly searches Google processed in May 2016. The information is often used as a spoken answer in Google Assistant and Google Home searches. The Knowledge Graph has been criticized for providing answers without source attribution.

=== Google Knowledge Panel ===
A Google Knowledge Panel is a feature integrated into Google search engine result pages, designed to present a structured overview of entities such as individuals, organizations, locations, or objects directly within the search interface. This feature leverages data from Google&#x27;s Knowledge Graph, a database that organizes and interconnects information about entities, enhancing the retrieval and presentation of relevant content to users.

The content within a Knowledge Panel is derived from various sources, including Wikipedia and other structured databases, ensuring that the information displayed is both accurate and contextually relevant. For instance, querying a well-known public figure may trigger a Knowledge Panel displaying essential details such as biographical information, birthdate, and links to social media profiles or official websites.

The primary objective of the Google Knowledge Panel is to provide users with immediate, factual answers, reducing the need for extensive navigation across multiple web pages.

=== Personal tab ===
In May 2017, Google enabled a new &quot;Personal&quot; tab in Google Search, letting users search for content in their Google accounts&#x27; various services, including email messages from Gmail and photos from Google Photos.

=== Google Discover ===
Google Discover, previously known as Google Feed, is a personalized stream of articles, videos, and other news-related content. The feed contains a &quot;mix of cards&quot; which show topics of interest based on users&#x27; interactions with Google, or topics they choose to follow directly. Cards include, &quot;links to news stories, YouTube videos, sports scores, recipes, and other content based on what [Google] determined you&#x27;re most likely to be interested in at that particular moment.&quot; Users can also tell Google they&#x27;re not interested in certain topics to avoid seeing future updates.

Google Discover launched in December 2016 and received a major update in July 2017. Another major update was released in September 2018, which renamed the app from Google Feed to Google Discover, updated the design, and adding more features.

Discover can be found on a tab in the Google app and by swiping left on the home screen of certain Android devices. As of 2019, Google will not allow political campaigns worldwide to target their advertisement to people to make them vote.

=== AI Overviews ===
At the 2023 Google I/O event in May, Google unveiled Search Generative Experience (SGE), an experimental feature in Google Search available through Google Labs which produces AI-generated summaries in response to search prompts. This was part of Google&#x27;s wider efforts to counter the unprecedented rise of generative AI technology, ushered by OpenAI&#x27;s launch of ChatGPT, which sent Google executives to a panic due to its potential threat to Google Search. Google added the ability to generate images in October. At I/O in 2024, the feature was upgraded and renamed AI Overviews.

AI Overviews was rolled out to users in the United States in May 2024. The feature faced public criticism in the first weeks of its rollout after errors from the tool went viral online. These included results suggesting users add glue to pizza or eat rocks, or incorrectly claiming Barack Obama is Muslim. Google described these viral errors as &quot;isolated examples&quot;, maintaining that most AI Overviews provide accurate information. Two weeks after the rollout of AI Overviews, Google made technical changes and scaled back the feature, pausing its use for some health-related queries and limiting its reliance on social media posts. &quot;Scientific American&quot; has criticised the system on environmental grounds, as such a search uses 30 times more energy than a conventional one. It has also been criticized for condensing information from various sources, making it less likely for people to view full articles and websites. When it was announced in May 2024, Danielle Coffey, CEO of the News/Media Alliance was quoted as saying &quot;This will be catastrophic to our traffic, as marketed by Google to further satisfy user queries, leaving even less incentive to click through so that we can monetize our content.&quot;

In August 2024, AI Overviews were rolled out in the UK, India, Japan, Indonesia, Mexico and Brazil, with local language support. On October 28, 2024, AI Overviews was rolled out to 100 more countries, including Australia and New Zealand.

=== Redesigns ===

In late June 2011, Google introduced a new look to the Google homepage in order to boost the use of the Google+ social tools.

One of the major changes was replacing the classic navigation bar with a black one. Google&#x27;s digital creative director Chris Wiggins explains: &quot;We&#x27;re working on a project to bring you a new and improved Google experience, and over the next few months, you&#x27;ll continue to see more updates to our look and feel.&quot; The new navigation bar has been negatively received by a vocal minority.

In November 2013, Google started testing yellow labels for advertisements displayed in search results, to improve user experience. The new labels, highlighted in yellow color, and aligned to the left of each sponsored link help users differentiate between organic and sponsored results.

On December 15, 2016, Google rolled out a new desktop search interface that mimics their modular mobile user interface. The mobile design consists of a tabular design that highlights search features in boxes. and works by imitating the desktop Knowledge Graph real estate, which appears in the right-hand rail of the search engine result page, these featured elements frequently feature Twitter carousels, People Also Search For, and Top Stories (vertical and horizontal design) modules. The Local Pack and Answer Box were two of the original features of the Google SERP that were primarily showcased in this manner, but this new layout creates a previously unseen level of design consistency for Google results.

=== Smartphone apps ===
Google offers a &quot;Google Search&quot; mobile app for Android and iOS devices. The mobile apps exclusively feature Google Discover and a &quot;Collections&quot; feature, in which the user can save for later perusal any type of search result like images, bookmarks or map locations into groups. Android devices were introduced to a preview of the feed, perceived as related to Google Now, in December 2016, while it was made official on both Android and iOS in July 2017.

In April 2016, Google updated its Search app on Android to feature &quot;Trends&quot;; search queries gaining popularity appeared in the autocomplete box along with normal query autocompletion. The update received significant backlash, due to encouraging search queries unrelated to users&#x27; interests or intentions, prompting the company to issue an update with an opt-out option. In September 2017, the Google Search app on iOS was updated to feature the same functionality.

In December 2017, Google released &quot;Google Go&quot;, an app designed to enable use of Google Search on physically smaller and lower-spec devices in multiple languages. A Google blog post about designing &quot;India-first&quot; products and features explains that it is &quot;tailor-made for the millions of people in [India and Indonesia] coming online for the first time&quot;.

== Performing a search ==

Google Search consists of a series of localized websites. The largest of those, the google.com site, is the top most-visited website in the world. Some of its features include a definition link for most searches including dictionary words, the number of results you got on your search, links to other searches (e.g. for words that Google believes to be misspelled, it provides a link to the search results using its proposed spelling), the ability to filter results to a date range, and many more.

=== Search syntax ===
Google search accepts queries as normal text, as well as individual keywords. It automatically corrects apparent misspellings by default (while offering to use the original spelling as a selectable alternative), and provides the same results regardless of capitalization. For more customized results, one can use a wide variety of operators, including, but not limited to:
* codice_1 or codice_2 – Search for webpages containing one of two similar queries, such as &quot;marathon OR race&quot;
* codice_3 – Search for webpages containing two similar queries, such as &quot;marathon AND runner&quot;
* codice_4 (minus sign) – Exclude a word or a phrase, so that &quot;apple -tree&quot; searches where word &quot;tree&quot; is not used
* codice_5 – Force inclusion of a word or a phrase, such as &quot;tallest building&quot;
* codice_6 – Placeholder symbol allowing for any substitute words in the context of the query, such as &quot;largest * in the world&quot;
* codice_7 – Search within a range of numbers, such as &quot;camera $50..$100&quot;
* codice_8 – Search within a specific website, such as &quot;site:youtube.com&quot;
* codice_9 – Search for definitions for a word or phrase, such as &quot;define:phrase&quot;
* codice_10 – See the stock price of investments, such as &quot;stocks:googl&quot;
* codice_11 – Find web pages related to specific URL addresses, such as &quot;related:www.wikipedia.org&quot;
* codice_12 – Highlights the search-words within the cached pages, so that &quot;cache:www.google.com xxx&quot; shows cached content with word &quot;xxx&quot; highlighted.
* codice_13 – Group operators and searches, such as &quot;(marathon OR race) AND shoes&quot;
* codice_14 or codice_15 – Search for specific file types, such as &quot;filetype:gif&quot;
* codice_16 – Search for before a specific date, such as spacex &quot;before:2020-08-11&quot;
* codice_17 – Search for after a specific date, such as iphone &quot;after:2007-06-29&quot;
* codice_18 – Search for a specific word on social media networks, such as &quot;@twitter&quot;
Google also offers a Google Advanced Search page with a web interface to access the advanced features without needing to remember the special operators.

==== Query expansion ====
Google applies query expansion to submitted search queries, using techniques to deliver results that it considers &quot;smarter&quot; than the query users actually submitted. This technique involves several steps, including:
* Word stemming – Certain words can be reduced so other, similar terms, are also found in results, so that &quot;translator&quot; can also search for &quot;translation&quot;
* Acronyms – Searching for abbreviations can also return results about the name in its full length, so that &quot;NATO&quot; can show results for &quot;North Atlantic Treaty Organization&quot;
* Misspellings – Google will often suggest correct spellings for misspelled words
* Synonyms – In most cases where a word is incorrectly used in a phrase or sentence, Google search will show results based on the correct synonym
* Translations – The search engine can, in some instances, suggest results for specific words in a different language
* Ignoring words – In some search queries containing extraneous or insignificant words, Google search will simply drop those specific words from the query

In 2008, Google started to give users autocompleted search suggestions in a list below the search bar while typing, originally with the approximate result count previewed for each listed search suggestion.

=== &quot;I&#x27;m Feeling Lucky&quot; ===
Google&#x27;s homepage includes a button labeled &quot;I&#x27;m Feeling Lucky&quot;. This feature originally allowed users to type in their search query, click the button and be taken directly to the first result, bypassing the search results page. Clicking it while leaving the search box empty opens Google&#x27;s archive of Doodles. With the 2010 announcement of Google Instant, an automatic feature that immediately displays relevant results as users are typing in their query, the &quot;I&#x27;m Feeling Lucky&quot; button disappears, requiring that users opt-out of Instant results through search settings to keep using the &quot;I&#x27;m Feeling Lucky&quot; functionality. In 2012, &quot;I&#x27;m Feeling Lucky&quot; was changed to serve as an advertisement for Google services; users hover their computer mouse over the button, it spins and shows an emotion (&quot;I&#x27;m Feeling Puzzled&quot; or &quot;I&#x27;m Feeling Trendy&quot;, for instance), and, when clicked, takes users to a Google service related to that emotion.

Tom Chavez of &quot;Rapt&quot;, a firm helping to determine a website&#x27;s advertising worth, estimated in 2007 that Google lost $110 million in revenue per year due to use of the button, which bypasses the advertisements found on the search results page.

=== Special interactive features ===

Besides the main text-based search-engine function of Google search, it also offers multiple quick, interactive features. These include, but are not limited to:
* Calculator
* Time zone, currency, and unit conversions
* Word translations
* Flight status
* Local film showings
* Weather forecasts
* Population and unemployment rates
* Package tracking
* Word definitions
* Metronome
* Roll a die
* &quot;Do a barrel roll&quot; (search page spins)
* &quot;Askew&quot; (results show up sideways)

=== &quot;OK Google&quot; conversational search ===

During Google&#x27;s developer conference, Google I/O, in May 2013, the company announced that users on Google Chrome and ChromeOS would be able to have the browser initiate an audio-based search by saying &quot;OK Google&quot;, with no button presses required. After having the answer presented, users can follow up with additional, contextual questions; an example include initially asking &quot;OK Google, will it be sunny in Santa Cruz this weekend?&quot;, hearing a spoken answer, and reply with &quot;how far is it from here?&quot; An update to the Chrome browser with voice-search functionality rolled out a week later, though it required a button press on a microphone icon rather than &quot;OK Google&quot; voice activation. Google released a browser extension for the Chrome browser, named with a &quot;beta&quot; tag for unfinished development, shortly thereafter. In May 2014, the company officially added &quot;OK Google&quot; into the browser itself; they removed it in October 2015, citing low usage, though the microphone icon for activation remained available. In May 2016, 20% of search queries on mobile devices were done through voice.

==Operations==
=== Search products ===

In addition to its tool for searching web pages, Google also provides services for searching images, Usenet newsgroups, news websites, videos (Google Videos), searching by locality, maps, and items for sale online. Google Videos allows searching the World Wide Web for video clips. The service evolved from Google Video, Google&#x27;s discontinued video hosting service that also allowed to search the web for video clips.

In 2012, Google has indexed over 30 trillion web pages, and received 100 billion queries per month. It also caches much of the content that it indexes. Google operates other tools and services including Google News, Google Shopping, Google Maps, Google Custom Search, Google Earth, Google Docs, Picasa (discontinued), Panoramio (discontinued), YouTube, Google Translate, Google Blog Search and Google Desktop Search (discontinued).

There are also products available from Google that are not directly search-related. Gmail, for example, is a webmail application, but still includes search features; Google Browser Sync does not offer any search facilities, although it aims to organize your browsing time.

=== Energy consumption ===
In 2009, Google claimed that a search query requires altogether about 1 kJ or 0.0003 kW·h, which is enough to raise the temperature of one liter of water by 0.24 °C. According to green search engine Ecosia, the industry standard for search engines is estimated to be about 0.2 grams of CO2 emission per search. Google&#x27;s 40,000 searches per second translate to 8 kg CO2 per second or over 252 million kilos of CO2 per year.

=== Google Doodles ===
On certain occasions, the logo on Google&#x27;s webpage will change to a special version, known as a &quot;Google Doodle&quot;. This is a picture, drawing, animation, or interactive game that includes the logo. It is usually done for a special event or day although not all of them are well known. Clicking on the Doodle links to a string of Google search results about the topic. The first was a reference to the Burning Man Festival in 1998, and others have been produced for the birthdays of notable people like Albert Einstein, historical events like the interlocking Lego block&#x27;s 50th anniversary and holidays like Valentine&#x27;s Day. Some Google Doodles have interactivity beyond a simple search, such as the famous &quot;Google Pac-Man&quot; version that appeared on May 21, 2010.

== Criticism ==

=== Privacy ===
Google has been criticized for placing long-term cookies on users&#x27; machines to store preferences, a tactic which also enables them to track a user&#x27;s search terms and retain the data for more than a year.

Since 2012, Google Inc. has globally introduced encrypted connections for most of its clients, to bypass governative blockings of the commercial and IT services.

=== Complaints about indexing ===
In 2003, &quot;The New York Times&quot; complained about Google&#x27;s indexing, claiming that Google&#x27;s caching of content on its site infringed its copyright for the content. In both &quot;Field v. Google&quot; and &quot;Parker v. Google&quot;, the United States District Court of Nevada ruled in favor of Google.

=== Child sexual abuse ===

A 2019 &quot;New York Times&quot; article on Google Search showed that images of child sexual abuse had been found on Google and that the company had been reluctant at times to remove them.

=== January 2009 malware bug ===
Google flags search results with the message &quot;This site may harm your computer&quot; if the site is known to install malicious software in the background or otherwise surreptitiously. For approximately 40 minutes on January 31, 2009, all search results were mistakenly classified as malware and could therefore not be clicked; instead a warning message was displayed and the user was required to enter the requested URL manually. The bug was caused by human error. The URL of &quot;/&quot; (which expands to all URLs) was mistakenly added to the malware patterns file.

=== Possible misuse of search results ===
In 2007, a group of researchers observed a tendency for users to rely exclusively on Google Search for finding information, writing that &quot;With the Google interface the user gets the impression that the search results imply a kind of totality. ... In fact, one only sees a small part of what one could see if one also integrates other research tools.&quot;

In 2011, Google Search query results have been shown by Internet activist Eli Pariser to be tailored to users, effectively isolating users in what he defined as a filter bubble. Pariser holds algorithms used in search engines such as Google Search responsible for catering &quot;a personal ecosystem of information&quot;. Although contrasting views have mitigated the potential threat of &quot;informational dystopia&quot; and questioned the scientific nature of Pariser&#x27;s claims, filter bubbles have been mentioned to account for the surprising results of the U.S. presidential election in 2016 alongside fake news and echo chambers, suggesting that Facebook and Google have designed personalized online realities in which &quot;we only see and hear what we like&quot;.

=== FTC fines ===
In 2012, the US Federal Trade Commission fined Google US$22.5 million for violating their agreement not to violate the privacy of users of Apple&#x27;s Safari web browser. The FTC was also continuing to investigate if Google&#x27;s favoring of their own services in their search results violated antitrust regulations.

===Payments to Apple===
In a November 2023 disclosure, during the ongoing antitrust trial against Google, an economics professor at the University of Chicago revealed that Google pays Apple 36% of all search advertising revenue generated when users access Google through the Safari browser. This revelation reportedly caused Google&#x27;s lead attorney to cringe visibly. The revenue generated from Safari users has been kept confidential, but the 36% figure suggests that it is likely in the tens of billions of dollars.

Both Apple and Google have argued that disclosing the specific terms of their search default agreement would harm their competitive positions. However, the court ruled that the information was relevant to the antitrust case and ordered its disclosure. This revelation has raised concerns about the dominance of Google in the search engine market and the potential anticompetitive effects of its agreements with Apple.

=== Big data and human bias ===
Google search engine robots are programmed to use algorithms that understand and predict human behavior. The book, &quot;Race After Technology: Abolitionist Tools for the New Jim Code&quot; by Ruha Benjamin talks about human bias as a behavior that the Google search engine can recognize. In 2016, some users Google searched &quot;three Black teenagers&quot; and images of criminal mugshots of young African American teenagers came up. Then, the users searched &quot;three White teenagers&quot; and were presented with photos of smiling, happy teenagers. They also searched for &quot;three Asian teenagers&quot;, and very revealing photos of Asian girls and women appeared. Benjamin concluded that these results reflect human prejudice and views on different ethnic groups. A group of analysts explained the concept of a racist computer program: &quot;The idea here is that computers, unlike people, can&#x27;t be racist but we&#x27;re increasingly learning that they do in fact take after their makers ... Some experts believe that this problem might stem from the hidden biases in the massive piles of data that the algorithms process as they learn to recognize patterns ... reproducing our worst values&quot;.

=== Monopoly ruling ===
On August 5, 2024, Google lost a lawsuit which started in 2020 in D.C. Circuit Court, with Judge Amit Mehta finding that the company had an illegal monopoly over Internet search. This monopoly was held to be in violation of Section 2 of the Sherman Act. Google has said it will appeal the ruling, though they did propose to loosen search deals with Apple and others requiring them to set Google as the default search engine.

== Trademark ==

As people talk about &quot;googling&quot; rather than searching, the company has taken some steps to defend its trademark, in an effort to prevent it from becoming a generic trademark. This has led to lawsuits, threats of lawsuits, and the use of euphemisms, such as calling Google Search a famous web search engine.

== Discontinued features ==
=== Translate foreign pages ===
Until May 2013, Google Search had offered a feature to translate search queries into other languages. A Google spokesperson told &quot;Search Engine Land&quot; that &quot;Removing features is always tough, but we do think very hard about each decision and its implications for our users. Unfortunately, this feature never saw much pick up&quot;.
Instant search was announced in September 2010 as a feature that displayed suggested results while the user typed in their search query, initially only in select countries or to registered users. The primary advantage of the new system was its ability to save time, with Marissa Mayer, then-vice president of search products and user experience, proclaiming that the feature would save 2–5 seconds per search, elaborating that &quot;That may not seem like a lot at first, but it adds up. With Google Instant, we estimate that we&#x27;ll save our users 11 hours with each passing second!&quot; Matt Van Wagner of &quot;Search Engine Land&quot; wrote that &quot;Personally, I kind of like Google Instant and I think it represents a natural evolution in the way search works&quot;, and also praised Google&#x27;s efforts in public relations, writing that &quot;With just a press conference and a few well-placed interviews, Google has parlayed this relatively minor speed improvement into an attention-grabbing front-page news story&quot;. The upgrade also became notable for the company switching Google Search&#x27;s underlying technology from HTML to AJAX.

Instant Search could be disabled via Google&#x27;s &quot;preferences&quot; menu for those who didn&#x27;t want its functionality.

The publication &quot;2600: The Hacker Quarterly&quot; compiled a list of words that Google Instant did not show suggested results for, with a Google spokesperson giving the following statement to &quot;Mashable&quot;:

&quot;PC Magazine&quot; discussed the inconsistency in how some forms of the same topic are allowed; for instance, &quot;lesbian&quot; was blocked, while &quot;gay&quot; was not, and &quot;cocaine&quot; was blocked, while &quot;crack&quot; and &quot;heroin&quot; were not. The report further stated that seemingly normal words were also blocked due to pornographic innuendos, most notably &quot;scat&quot;, likely due to having two completely separate contextual meanings, one for music and one for a sexual practice.

On July 26, 2017, Google removed Instant results, due to a growing number of searches on mobile devices, where interaction with search, as well as screen sizes, differ significantly from a computer.
&quot;Instant previews&quot; allowed previewing screenshots of search results&#x27; web pages without having to open them. The feature was introduced in November 2010 to the desktop website and removed in April 2013 citing low usage.

===Dedicated encrypted search page===
Various search engines provide encrypted Web search facilities. In May 2010 Google rolled out SSL-encrypted web search. The encrypted search was accessed at codice_19 However, the web search is encrypted via Transport Layer Security (TLS) by default today, thus every search request should be automatically encrypted if TLS is supported by the web browser. On its support website, Google announced that the address codice_19 would be turned off April 30, 2018, stating that all Google products and most new browsers use HTTPS connections as the reason for the discontinuation.

=== Real-Time Search ===
Google Real-Time Search was a feature of Google Search in which search results also sometimes included real-time information from sources such as Twitter, Facebook, blogs, and news websites. The feature was introduced on December 7, 2009, and went offline on July 2, 2011, after the deal with Twitter expired. Real-Time Search included Facebook status updates beginning on February 24, 2010. A feature similar to Real-Time Search was already available on Microsoft&#x27;s Bing search engine, which showed results from Twitter and Facebook. The interface for the engine showed a live, descending &quot;river&quot; of posts in the main region (which could be paused or resumed), while a bar chart metric of the frequency of posts containing a certain search term or hashtag was located on the right hand corner of the page above a list of most frequently reposted posts and outgoing links. Hashtag search links were also supported, as were &quot;promoted&quot; tweets hosted by Twitter (located persistently on top of the river) and thumbnails of retweeted image or video links.

In January 2011, geolocation links of posts were made available alongside results in Real-Time Search. In addition, posts containing syndicated or attached shortened links were made searchable by the &quot;link:&quot; query option. In July 2011, Real-Time Search became inaccessible, with the Real-Time link in the Google sidebar disappearing and a custom 404 error page generated by Google returned at its former URL. Google originally suggested that the interruption was temporary and related to the launch of Google+; they subsequently announced that it was due to the expiry of a commercial arrangement with Twitter to provide access to tweets.

<text>Genius is a characteristic of original and exceptional insight in the performance of some art or endeavor that surpasses expectations, sets new standards for the future, establishes better methods of operation, or remains outside the capabilities of competitors. Genius is associated with intellectual ability and creative productivity. The term &quot;genius&quot; can also be used to refer to people characterised by genius, and/or to polymaths who excel across many subjects.

There is no scientifically precise definition of genius. When used to refer to the characteristic, genius is associated with talent, but several authors such as Cesare Lombroso and Arthur Schopenhauer systematically distinguish these terms. Walter Isaacson, biographer of many well-known geniuses, explains that although high intelligence may be a prerequisite, the most common trait that actually defines a genius may be the extraordinary ability to apply creativity and imaginative thinking to almost any situation.

In the early-19th century Carl von Clausewitz, who had a particular interest in what he called &quot;military genius&quot;, defined &quot;the essence of Genius&quot; () in terms of &quot;a very high mental capacity for certain employments&quot;.

==Etymology==


In ancient Rome, the &quot;genius&quot; (plural in Latin &quot;genii&quot;) was the guiding spirit or tutelary deity of a person, family (&quot;gens&quot;), or place (&quot;genius loci&quot;). Connotations of the word in Latin have a lineal relationship with the Greek word &quot;daemon&quot; in classical and medieval texts&quot;,&quot; and also share a relationship with the Arabic word &quot;al-ghul&quot; (as in the star &quot;Algol&quot;; its literal meaning being &quot;the Demon&quot;).

The noun is related to the Latin verbs &quot;gignere&quot; (to beget, to give birth to) and &quot;generare&quot; (to beget, to generate, to procreate), and derives directly from the Indo-European stem thereof: &quot;ǵenh&quot; (to produce, to beget, to give birth). Because the achievements of exceptional individuals seemed to indicate the presence of a particularly powerful &quot;genius&quot;, by the time of Augustus, the word began to acquire its secondary meaning of &quot;inspiration, talent&quot;. The term &quot;genius&quot; acquired its modern sense in the eighteenth century, and is a conflation of two Latin terms: &quot;genius&quot;, as above, and &quot;Ingenium&quot;, a related noun referring to our innate dispositions, talents, and inborn nature. Beginning to blend the concepts of the divine and the talented, the &quot;Encyclopédie&quot; article on genius (génie) describes such a person as &quot;he whose soul is more expansive and struck by the feelings of all others; interested by all that is in nature never to receive an idea unless it evokes a feeling; everything excites him and on which nothing is lost.&quot;

==Historical development==

===Galton===

The assessment of intelligence was initiated by Francis Galton (1822–1911) and James McKeen Cattell. They had advocated the analysis of reaction time and sensory acuity as measures of &quot;neurophysiological efficiency&quot; and the analysis of sensory acuity as a measure of intelligence.

Galton is regarded as the founder of psychometry. He studied the work of his older half-cousin Charles Darwin about biological evolution. Hypothesizing that eminence is inherited from ancestors, Galton did a study of families of eminent people in Britain, publishing it in 1869 as &quot;Hereditary Genius&quot;. Galton&#x27;s ideas were elaborated from the work of two early 19th-century pioneers in statistics: Carl Friedrich Gauss and Adolphe Quetelet. Gauss discovered the normal distribution (bell-shaped curve): given a large number of measurements of the same variable under the same conditions, they vary at random from a most frequent value, the &quot;average&quot;, to two least frequent values at maximum differences greater and lower than the most frequent value. Quetelet discovered that the bell-shaped curve applied to social statistics gathered by the French government in the course of its normal processes on large numbers of people passing through the courts and the military. His initial work in criminology led him to observe &quot;the greater the number of individuals observed the more do peculiarities become effaced...&quot;. This ideal from which the peculiarities were effaced became &quot;the average man&quot;.

Galton was inspired by Quetelet to define the average man as &quot;an entire normal scheme&quot;; that is, if one combines the normal curves of every measurable human characteristic, one will, in theory, perceive a syndrome straddled by &quot;the average man&quot; and flanked by persons that are different. In contrast to Quetelet, Galton&#x27;s average man was not statistical but was theoretical only. There was no measure of general averageness, only a large number of very specific averages. Setting out to discover a general measure of the average, Galton looked at educational statistics and found bell-curves in test results of all sorts; initially in mathematics grades for the final honors examination and in entrance examination scores for Sandhurst.

Galton&#x27;s method in &quot;Hereditary Genius&quot; was to count and assess the eminent relatives of eminent men. He found that the number of eminent relatives was greater with a closer degree of kinship. This work is considered the first example of historiometry, an analytical study of historical human progress. The work is controversial and has been criticized for several reasons. Galton then departed from Gauss in a way that became crucial to the history of the 20th century AD. The bell-shaped curve was not random, he concluded. The differences between the average and the upper end were due to a non-random factor, &quot;natural ability&quot;, which he defined as &quot;those qualities of intellect and disposition, which urge and qualify men to perform acts that lead to reputation…a nature which, when left to itself, will, urged by an inherent stimulus, climb the path that leads to eminence.&quot; The apparent randomness of the scores was due to the randomness of this natural ability in the population as a whole, in theory.

Criticisms include that Galton&#x27;s study fails to account for the impact of social status and the associated availability of resources in the form of economic inheritance, meaning that inherited &quot;eminence&quot; or &quot;genius&quot; can be gained through the enriched environment provided by wealthy families. Galton went on to develop the field of eugenics. Galton attempted to control for economic inheritance by comparing the adopted nephews of popes, who would have the advantage of wealth without being as closely related to popes as sons are to their fathers, to the biological children of eminent individuals.

==Psychology==


Genius is expressed in a variety of forms (e.g., mathematical, literary, musical performance). Persons with genius tend to have strong intuitions about their domains, and they build on these insights with tremendous energy. Carl Rogers, a founder of the humanistic approach to psychology, expands on the idea of a genius trusting his or her intuition in a given field, writing: &quot;El Greco, for example, must have realized as he looked at some of his early work, that &#x27;good artists do not paint like that.&#x27; But somehow he trusted his own experiencing of life, the process of himself, sufficiently that he could go on expressing his own unique perceptions. It was as though he could say, &#x27;Good artists don&#x27;t paint like this, but &quot;I&quot; paint like this.&#x27; Or to move to another field, Ernest Hemingway was surely aware that &#x27;good writers do not write like this.&#x27; But fortunately he moved toward being Hemingway, being himself, rather than toward someone else&#x27;s conception of a good writer.&quot;

It has been suggested that there exists a connection between mental illness, in particular schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, and genius. Individuals with bipolar disorder and schizotypal personality disorder, the latter of which being more common amongst relatives of schizophrenics, tend to show elevated creativity. Several people who have been regarded as geniuses were diagnosed with mental disorders; examples include Vincent van Gogh, Virginia Woolf, John Forbes Nash Jr., Domantas G. and Ernest Hemingway.

In a 2010 study conducted by the Karolinska Institute, it was observed that highly creative individuals and schizophrenics have a lower density of thalamic dopamine D2 receptors. One of the investigators explained that &quot;Fewer D2 receptors in the thalamus probably means a lower degree of signal filtering, and thus a higher flow of information from the thalamus.&quot; This could be a possible mechanism behind the ability of healthy highly creative people to see numerous uncommon connections in a problem-solving situation and the bizarre associations found in schizophrenics.

=== IQ and genius ===

Galton was a pioneer in investigating both eminent human achievement and mental testing. In his book &quot;Hereditary Genius&quot;, written before the development of IQ testing, he proposed that hereditary influences on eminent achievement are strong, and that eminence is rare in the general population. Lewis Terman chose &quot;&#x27;near&#x27; genius or genius&quot; as the classification label for the highest classification on his 1916 version of the Stanford–Binet test. By 1926, Terman began publishing about a longitudinal study of California schoolchildren who were referred for IQ testing by their schoolteachers, called Genetic Studies of Genius, which he conducted for the rest of his life. Catherine M. Cox, a colleague of Terman&#x27;s, wrote a whole book, &quot;The Early Mental Traits of 300 Geniuses&quot;, published as volume 2 of The Genetic Studies of Genius book series, in which she analyzed biographical data about historic geniuses. Although her estimates of childhood IQ scores of historical figures who never took IQ tests have been criticized on methodological grounds, Cox&#x27;s study was thorough in finding out what else matters besides IQ in becoming a genius. By the 1937 second revision of the Stanford–Binet test, Terman no longer used the term &quot;genius&quot; as an IQ classification, nor has any subsequent IQ test. In 1939, David Wechsler specifically commented that &quot;we are rather hesitant about calling a person a genius on the basis of a single intelligence test score&quot;.

The Terman longitudinal study in California eventually provided historical evidence regarding how genius is related to IQ scores. Many California pupils were recommended for the study by schoolteachers. Two pupils who were tested but rejected for inclusion in the study (because their IQ scores were too low) grew up to be Nobel Prize winners in physics, William Shockley, and Luis Walter Alvarez. Based on the historical findings of the Terman study and on biographical examples such as Richard Feynman, who had a self-reported IQ of 125 and went on to win the Nobel Prize in physics and become widely known as a genius, the current view of psychologists and other scholars of genius is that a minimum level of IQ (approximately 125) is necessary for genius but not sufficient, and must be combined with personality characteristics such as drive and persistence, plus the necessary opportunities for talent development. For instance, in a chapter in an edited volume on achievement, IQ researcher Arthur Jensen proposed a multiplicative model of genius consisting of high ability, high productivity, and high creativity. Jensen&#x27;s model was motivated by the finding that eminent achievement is highly positively skewed, a finding known as Price&#x27;s law, and related to Lotka&#x27;s law.

Some high IQ individuals join a High IQ society. The most famous and largest is Mensa International, but many other more selective organizations exist.

==Philosophy==

Various philosophers have proposed definitions of what genius is and what that implies in the context of their philosophical theories.

In the philosophy of David Hume, the way society perceives genius is similar to the way society perceives the ignorant. Hume states that a person with the characteristics of a genius is looked at as a person disconnected from society, as well as a person who works remotely, at a distance, away from the rest of the world. On the other hand, the mere ignorant is still more despised; nor is any thing deemed a surer sign of an illiberal genius in an age and nation where the sciences flourish, than to be entirely destitute of all relish for those noble entertainments. The most perfect character is supposed to lie between those extremes; retaining an equal ability and taste for books, company, and business; preserving in conversation that discernment and delicacy which arise from polite letters; and in business, that probity and accuracy which are the natural result of a just philosophy.

In the philosophy of Immanuel Kant, genius is the ability to independently arrive at and understand concepts that would normally have to be taught by another person. For Kant, originality was the essential character of genius. The artworks of the Kantian genius are also characterized by their exemplarity which is imitated by other artists and serve as a rule for other aesthetical judgements. This genius is a talent for producing ideas which can be described as non-imitative. Kant&#x27;s discussion of the characteristics of genius is largely contained within the &quot;Critique of Judgment&quot; and was well received by the Romantics of the early 19th century. In addition, much of Schopenhauer&#x27;s theory of genius, particularly regarding talent and freedom from constraint, is directly derived from paragraphs of Part I of Kant&#x27;s &quot;Critique of Judgment&quot;.

In the philosophy of Arthur Schopenhauer, a genius is someone in whom intellect predominates over &quot;will&quot; much more than within the average person. In Schopenhauer&#x27;s aesthetics, this predominance of the intellect over the will allows the genius to create artistic or academic works that are objects of pure, disinterested contemplation, the chief criterion of the aesthetic experience for Schopenhauer. Their remoteness from mundane concerns means that Schopenhauer&#x27;s geniuses often display maladaptive traits in more mundane concerns; in Schopenhauer&#x27;s words, they fall into the mire while gazing at the stars, an allusion to Plato&#x27;s dialogue &quot;Theætetus&quot;, in which Socrates tells of Thales (the first philosopher) being ridiculed for falling in such circumstances. As he says in Volume 2 of &quot;The World as Will and Representation&quot;:

In the philosophy of Thomas Carlyle, genius is called (in &quot;Past and Present&quot;) &quot;the inspired gift of God&quot;; the &quot;Man of Genius&quot; possesses &quot;the presence of God Most High in a man&quot;. The actions of the &quot;Man of Genius&quot; can manifest this in various ways: in his &quot;transcendent capacity of taking trouble&quot; (often misquoted as &quot;an infinite capacity for taking pains&quot;), in that he can &quot;recognise how every object has a divine beauty in it&quot; as a poet or painter does, or in that he has &quot;an original power of thinking&quot;. In accordance with his Great Man theory, Carlyle considered such individuals as Odin, William the Conqueror and Frederick the Great to be &quot;Men of Genius&quot;.

In the philosophy of Bertrand Russell, genius entails that an individual possesses unique qualities and talents that make the genius especially valuable to the society in which he or she operates, once given the chance to contribute to society. Russell&#x27;s philosophy further maintains, however, that it is possible for such geniuses to be crushed in their youth and lost forever when the environment around them is unsympathetic to their potential maladaptive traits. Russell rejected the notion he believed was popular during his lifetime that, &quot;genius will out&quot;.

In his classic work &quot;The Limitations of Science&quot;, J. W. N. Sullivan discussed a utilitarian philosophy on the retrospective classification of genius. Namely, scholarship that is so original that, were it not for that particular contributor, would not have emerged until much later (if ever) is characteristic of genius. Conversely, scholarship that was ripe for development, no matter how profound or prominent, is not necessarily indicative of genius.

==Literature and pop culture==

Geniuses are variously portrayed in literature and film as both protagonists and antagonists, and may be the hero or villain of the story. In pop culture, the genius is often stereotypically depicted as either the wisecracking whiz or the tortured genius.

Throughout both literature and movies, the tortured genius character is often seen as an imperfect or tragic hero who wrestles with the burden of superior intelligence, arrogance, eccentricities, addiction, awkwardness, mental health issues, a lack of social skills, isolation, or other insecurities. They regularly experience existential crises, struggling to overcome personal challenges to employ their special abilities for good or succumbing to their own tragic flaws and vices. This common motif repeated throughout fiction is notably present in the characters of Dr. Bruce Banner in the &quot;Hulk&quot; and Dr. Henry Jekyll in &quot;The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde&quot;, among others. Although not as extreme, other examples of literary and filmic characterizations of the tortured genius stereotype, to varying degrees, include: Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart in &quot;Amadeus&quot;, Dr. John Nash in &quot;A Beautiful Mind&quot;, Leonardo da Vinci in &quot;Da Vinci&#x27;s Demons&quot;, Dr. Gregory House in &quot;House&quot;, Will Hunting in &quot;Good Will Hunting&quot;, and Dr. Sheldon Cooper in &quot;The Big Bang Theory.&quot;

One of the most famous genius-level rivalries to occur in literary fiction is between Sherlock Holmes and his nemesis Professor Moriarty; the latter character also identified as the modern archetype of an evil genius.

<text>A grape is a fruit, botanically a berry, of the deciduous woody vines of the flowering plant genus &quot;Vitis&quot;. Grapes are a non-climacteric type of fruit, generally occurring in clusters.

The cultivation of grapes began approximately 8,000 years ago, and the fruit has been used as human food throughout its history. Eaten fresh or in dried form (as raisins, currants and sultanas), grapes also hold cultural significance in many parts of the world, particularly for their role in winemaking. Other grape-derived products include various types of jam, juice, vinegar and oil.


== History ==
The Middle East is generally described as the homeland of grapes and the cultivation of this plant began there 6,000–8,000 years ago. Yeast, one of the earliest domesticated microorganisms, occurs naturally on the skins of grapes, leading to the discovery of alcoholic drinks such as wine. The earliest archeological evidence for a dominant position of wine-making in human culture dates from 8,000 years ago in Georgia.

The oldest known winery, the Areni-1 winery, was found in Armenia and dated back to around 4000 BC. By the 9th century AD, the city of Shiraz was known to produce some of the finest wines in the Middle East. Thus it has been proposed that Syrah red wine is named after Shiraz, a city in Persia where the grape was used to make Shirazi wine.

Ancient Egyptian hieroglyphics record the cultivation of purple grapes, and history attests to the ancient Greeks, Cypriots, Phoenicians, and Romans growing purple grapes both for eating and wine production. The growing of grapes would later spread to other regions in Europe, as well as North Africa, and eventually in North America.

In 2005, a team of archaeologists concluded that Chalcolithic wine jars discovered in Cyprus in the 1930s dated back to 3500 BC, making them the oldest of their kind in the world. Commandaria, a sweet dessert wine from Cyprus, is the oldest manufactured wine in the world with origins as far back as 2000 BC.

In North America, native grapes belonging to various species of the genus &quot;Vitis&quot; proliferate in the wild across the continent and were a part of the diet of many Native Americans, but they were considered by early European colonists to be unsuitable for wine. In the 19th century, Ephraim Bull of Concord, Massachusetts, cultivated seeds from wild &quot;Vitis labrusca&quot; vines to create the Concord grape, which would become an important agricultural crop in the United States.

== Description ==
Grapes are a type of fruit that grow in clusters of 15 to 300 and can be crimson, black, dark blue, yellow, green, orange, and pink. &quot;White&quot; grapes are actually green in color and are evolutionarily derived from the purple grape. Mutations in two regulatory genes of white grapes turn off production of anthocyanins, which are responsible for the color of purple grapes. Anthocyanins and other pigment chemicals of the larger family of polyphenols in purple grapes are responsible for the varying shades of purple in red wines. Grapes are typically an ellipsoid shape resembling a prolate spheroid.

=== Nutrition ===
Raw grapes are 81% water, 18% carbohydrates, 1% protein, and have negligible fat (table). A reference amount of raw grapes supplies of food energy and a moderate amount of vitamin K (14% of the Daily Value), with no other micronutrients in significant amounts.

== Grapevines ==
Most domesticated grapes come from cultivars of &quot;Vitis vinifera&quot;, a grapevine native to the Mediterranean and Central Asia. Minor amounts of fruit and wine come from American and Asian species such as:

* &quot;Vitis amurensis&quot;, the most important Asian species
* &quot;Vitis labrusca&quot;, the North American table and grape juice grapevines (including the Concord cultivar), sometimes used for wine, are native to the Eastern United States and Canada.
* &quot;Vitis mustangensis&quot; (the mustang grape), found in Mississippi, Alabama, Louisiana, Texas, and Oklahoma
* &quot;Vitis riparia&quot;, a wild vine of North America, is sometimes used for winemaking and for jam. It is native to the entire Eastern United States and north to Quebec.
* &quot;Vitis rotundifolia&quot; (the muscadine), used for jams and wine, is native to the Southeastern United States from Delaware to the Gulf of Mexico.

== Trade ==

== Distribution and production ==

According to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), 75,866 square kilometers of the world are dedicated to grapes. Approximately 71% of world grape production is used for wine, 27% as fresh fruit, and 2% as dried fruit. A portion of grape production goes to producing grape juice to be reconstituted for fruits canned &quot;with no added sugar&quot; and &quot;100% natural&quot;. The area dedicated to vineyards is increasing by about 2% per year.

There are no reliable statistics that break down grape production by variety. It is believed that the most widely planted variety is Sultana, also known as Thompson Seedless, with at least 3,600 km2 (880,000 acres) dedicated to it. The second most common variety is Airén. Other popular varieties include Cabernet Sauvignon, Sauvignon blanc, Cabernet Franc, Merlot, Grenache, Tempranillo, Riesling, and Chardonnay.

== Table and wine grapes ==

Commercially cultivated grapes can usually be classified as either table or wine grapes, based on their intended method of consumption: eaten raw (table grapes) or used to make wine (wine grapes). The sweetness of grapes depends on when they are harvested, as they do not continue to ripen once picked. While almost all of them belong to the same species, &quot;Vitis vinifera&quot;, table and wine grapes have significant differences, brought about through selective breeding. Table grape cultivars tend to have large, seedless fruit (see below) with relatively thin skin. Wine grapes are smaller, usually seeded, and have relatively thick skins (a desirable characteristic in winemaking, since much of the aroma in wine comes from the skin). Wine grapes also tend to be very sweet: they are harvested at the time when their juice is approximately 24% sugar by weight. By comparison, commercially produced &quot;100% grape juice&quot;, made from table grapes, is usually around 15% sugar by weight.

== Seedless grapes ==
Seedless cultivars now make up the overwhelming majority of table grape plantings. Because grapevines are vegetatively propagated by cuttings, the lack of seeds does not present a problem for reproduction. It is an issue for breeders, who must either use a seeded variety as the female parent or rescue embryos early in development using tissue culture techniques.

There are several sources of the seedlessness trait, and essentially all commercial cultivators get it from one of three sources: Thompson Seedless, Russian Seedless, and Black Monukka, all being cultivars of &quot;Vitis vinifera&quot;. There are currently more than a dozen varieties of seedless grapes. Several, such as Einset Seedless, Benjamin Gunnels&#x27;s Prime seedless grapes, Reliance, and Venus, have been specifically cultivated for hardiness and quality in the relatively cold climates of northeastern United States and southern Ontario.

An offset to the improved eating quality of seedlessness is the loss of potential health benefits provided by the enriched phytochemical content of grape seeds (see Health claims, below).

== Uses ==
=== Culinary ===
Grapes are eaten raw, dried (as raisins, currants and sultanas), or cooked. Also, depending on grape cultivar, grapes are used in winemaking. Grapes can be processed into a multitude of products such as jams, juices, vinegars and oils.
Commercially cultivated grapes are classified as either table or wine grapes. These categories are based on their intended method of consumption: grapes that are eaten raw (table grapes), or grapes that are used to make wine (wine grapes).
Table grape cultivars normally have large, seedless fruit and thin skins. Wine grapes are smaller (in comparison to table grapes), usually contains seeds, and have thicker skins (a desirable characteristic in making wine). Most of the aroma in wine is from the skin. Wine grapes tend to have a high sugar content. They are harvested at peak sugar levels (approximately 24% sugar by weight.) In comparison, commercially produced &quot;100% grape juice&quot; made from table grapes are normally around 15% sugar by weight.

==== Raisins, currants and sultanas ====

In most of Europe and North America, dried grapes are referred to as &quot;raisins&quot; or the local equivalent. In the UK, three different varieties are recognized, forcing the EU to use the term &quot;dried vine fruit&quot; in official documents.

A &quot;raisin&quot; is any dried grape. While &quot;raisin&quot; is a French loanword, the word in French refers to the fresh fruit; &quot;grappe&quot; (from which the English &quot;grape&quot; is derived) refers to the bunch (as in &quot;une grappe de raisins&quot;). A raisin in French is called &quot;raisin sec&quot; (&quot;dry grape&quot;).

A &quot;currant&quot; is a dried Zante Black Corinth grape, the name being a corruption of the French &quot;raisin de Corinthe&quot; (Corinth grape). The names of the black and red currant, now more usually blackcurrant and redcurrant, two berries unrelated to grapes, are derived from this use. Some other fruits of similar appearance are also so named, for example, Australian currant, native currant, Indian currant.

A &quot;sultana&quot; was originally a raisin made from Sultana grapes of Turkish origin (known as Thompson Seedless in the United States), but the word is now applied to raisins made from either white grapes or red grapes that are bleached to resemble the traditional sultana.

==== Juice ====
Grape juice is obtained from crushing and blending grapes into a liquid. The juice is often sold in stores or fermented and made into wine, brandy, or vinegar. Grape juice that has been pasteurized, removing any naturally occurring yeast, will not ferment if kept sterile, and thus contains no alcohol. In the wine industry, grape juice that contains 7–23% of pulp, skins, stems and seeds is often referred to as &quot;must&quot;. 

In North America, the most common grape juice is purple and made from Concord grapes, while white grape juice is commonly made from Niagara grapes, both of which are varieties of grapes, a different species from European wine grapes. In California, Sultana (known there as Thompson Seedless) grapes are sometimes diverted from the raisin or table market to produce white juice.

==== Vinegars ====
&quot;Husrum&quot;, also known as &quot;verjuice&quot;, is a type of vinegar made from sour grapes in the Middle East. It is produced by crushing unripened grapes, collecting and salting the juice, simmering it to remove foam, and then storing it with a layer of olive oil to prevent contamination and oxidation. It is then used as an acidic ingredient in salads and stuffed vegetables. Unripened &quot;husrum&quot; grapes sent from Ashkelon to Egypt are mentioned in a 12th-century document found in the Cairo Geniza. In Iran, a sour grape vinegar is used for making Shirazi salad.

==Pomace and phytochemicals==
Winemaking from red and white grape flesh and skins produces substantial quantities of organic residues, collectively called pomace (also &quot;marc&quot;), which includes crushed skins, seeds, stems, and leaves generally used as compost. Grape pomace – some 10–30% of the total mass of grapes crushed – contains various phytochemicals, such as unfermented sugars, alcohol, polyphenols, tannins, anthocyanins, and numerous other compounds, some of which are harvested and extracted for commercial applications (a process sometimes called &quot;valorization&quot; of the pomace).

=== Skin ===
Anthocyanins tend to be the main polyphenolics in purple grapes, whereas flavan-3-ols (i.e. catechins) are the more abundant class of polyphenols in white varieties. Total phenolic content is higher in purple varieties due almost entirely to anthocyanin density in purple grape skin compared to absence of anthocyanins in white grape skin. Phenolic content of grape skin varies with cultivar, soil composition, climate, geographic origin, and cultivation practices or exposure to diseases, such as fungal infections.

Muscadine grapes contain a relatively high phenolic content among dark grapes. In muscadine skins, ellagic acid, myricetin, quercetin, kaempferol, and trans-resveratrol are major phenolics.

The flavonols syringetin, syringetin 3-O-galactoside, laricitrin and laricitrin 3-O-galactoside are also found in purple grape but absent in white grape.

=== Seeds ===
Muscadine grape seeds contain about twice the total polyphenol content of skins. Grape seed oil from crushed seeds is used in cosmeceuticals and skincare products. Grape seed oil, including tocopherols (vitamin E) and high contents of phytosterols and polyunsaturated fatty acids such as linoleic acid, oleic acid, and alpha-linolenic acid.

=== Resveratrol ===

Resveratrol, a stilbene compound, is found in widely varying amounts among grape varieties, primarily in their skins and seeds. Muscadine grapes have about one hundred times higher concentration of stilbenes than pulp. Fresh grape skin contains about 50 to 100 micrograms of resveratrol per gram.

== Health claims ==
=== French paradox ===

Comparing diets among Western countries, researchers have discovered that, although French people tend to eat higher levels of animal fat, the incidence of heart disease remains low in France. This phenomenon has been termed the French paradox and is thought to occur due to the protective benefits of regularly consuming red wine, among other dietary practices. Alcohol consumption in moderation may be cardioprotective by its minor anticoagulant effect and vasodilation.

Although adoption of wine consumption is generally not recommended by health authorities, some research indicates moderate consumption, such as one glass of red wine a day for women and two for men, may confer health benefits. Alcohol itself may have protective effects on the cardiovascular system.

=== Grape and raisin toxicity in dogs ===

The consumption of grapes and raisins presents a potential health threat to dogs. Their toxicity to dogs can cause the animal to develop acute kidney failure (the sudden development of kidney failure) with anuria (a lack of urine production) and may be fatal.

== In religion ==

Christians have traditionally used wine during worship services as a means of remembering the blood of Jesus Christ which was shed for the remission of sins. Christians who oppose the partaking of alcoholic beverages sometimes use grape juice as the &quot;cup&quot; or &quot;wine&quot; in the Lord&#x27;s Supper.

The Catholic Church continues to use wine in the celebration of the Eucharist because it is part of the tradition passed down through the ages starting with Jesus Christ at the Last Supper, where Catholics believe the consecrated bread and wine become the body and blood of Jesus Christ, a dogma known as transubstantiation. Wine is used (not grape juice) both due to its strong Scriptural roots, and also to follow the tradition set by the early Christian Church. The Code of Canon Law of the Catholic Church (1983), Canon 924 says that the wine used must be natural, made from grapes of the vine, and not corrupt.

<doc id="12437" wikidata="Q200779" url="?curid=12437" title="Genetic disorder">
<text>A genetic disorder is a health problem caused by one or more abnormalities in the genome. It can be caused by a mutation in a single gene (monogenic) or multiple genes (polygenic) or by a chromosome abnormality. Although polygenic disorders are the most common, the term is mostly used when discussing disorders with a single genetic cause, either in a gene or chromosome. The mutation responsible can occur spontaneously before embryonic development (a &quot;de novo&quot; mutation), or it can be inherited from two parents who are carriers of a faulty gene (autosomal recessive inheritance) or from a parent with the disorder (autosomal dominant inheritance). When the genetic disorder is inherited from one or both parents, it is also classified as a hereditary disease. Some disorders are caused by a mutation on the X chromosome and have X-linked inheritance. Very few disorders are inherited on the Y chromosome or mitochondrial DNA (due to their size).

There are well over 6,000 known genetic disorders, and new genetic disorders are constantly being described in medical literature. More than 600 genetic disorders are treatable. Around 1 in 50 people are affected by a known single-gene disorder, while around 1 in 263 are affected by a chromosomal disorder. Around 65% of people have some kind of health problem as a result of congenital genetic mutations. Due to the significantly large number of genetic disorders, approximately 1 in 21 people are affected by a genetic disorder classified as &quot;rare&quot; (usually defined as affecting less than 1 in 2,000 people). Most genetic disorders are rare in themselves.

Genetic disorders are present before birth, and some genetic disorders produce birth defects, but birth defects can also be developmental rather than hereditary. The opposite of a hereditary disease is an acquired disease. Most cancers, although they involve genetic mutations to a small proportion of cells in the body, are acquired diseases. Some cancer syndromes, however, such as &quot;BRCA&quot; mutations, are hereditary genetic disorders.

== Single-gene ==
A single-gene disorder (or monogenic disorder) is the result of a single mutated gene. Single-gene disorders can be passed on to subsequent generations in several ways. Genomic imprinting and uniparental disomy, however, may affect inheritance patterns. The divisions between recessive and dominant types are not &quot;hard and fast&quot;, although the divisions between autosomal and X-linked types are (since the latter types are distinguished purely based on the chromosomal location of the gene). For example, the common form of dwarfism, achondroplasia, is typically considered a dominant disorder, but children with two genes for achondroplasia have a severe and usually lethal skeletal disorder, one that achondroplasics(ones affected with achondroplasia) could be considered carriers for. Sickle cell anemia is also considered a recessive condition, but heterozygous carriers have increased resistance to malaria in early childhood, which could be described as a related dominant condition. When a couple where one partner or both are affected or carriers of a single-gene disorder wish to have a child, they can do so through &quot;in vitro&quot; fertilization, which enables preimplantation genetic diagnosis to occur to check whether the embryo has the genetic disorder.

Most congenital metabolic disorders known as inborn errors of metabolism result from single-gene defects. Many such single-gene defects can decrease the fitness of affected people and are therefore present in the population in lower frequencies compared to what would be expected based on simple probabilistic calculations.

=== Autosomal dominant ===

Only one mutated copy of the gene will be necessary for a person to be affected by an autosomal dominant disorder. Each affected person usually has one affected parent. The chance a child will inherit the mutated gene is 50%. Autosomal dominant conditions sometimes have reduced penetrance, which means although only one mutated copy is needed, not all individuals who inherit that mutation go on to develop the disease. Examples of this type of disorder are Huntington&#x27;s disease, neurofibromatosis type 1, neurofibromatosis type 2, Marfan syndrome, hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer, hereditary multiple exostoses (a highly penetrant autosomal dominant disorder), tuberous sclerosis, Von Willebrand disease, and acute intermittent porphyria. Birth defects are also called congenital anomalies.

=== Autosomal recessive ===

Two copies of the gene must be mutated for a person to be affected by an autosomal recessive disorder. An affected person usually has unaffected parents who each carry a single copy of the mutated gene and are referred to as genetic carriers. Each parent with a defective gene normally do not have symptoms. Two unaffected people who each carry one copy of the mutated gene have a 25% risk with each pregnancy of having a child affected by the disorder. Examples of this type of disorder are albinism, medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency, cystic fibrosis, sickle cell disease, Tay–Sachs disease, Niemann–Pick disease, spinal muscular atrophy, and Roberts syndrome. Certain other phenotypes, such as wet versus dry earwax, are also determined in an autosomal recessive fashion. Some autosomal recessive disorders are common because, in the past, carrying one of the faulty genes led to a slight protection against an infectious disease or toxin such as tuberculosis or malaria. Such disorders include cystic fibrosis, sickle cell disease, phenylketonuria and thalassaemia.
=== X-linked dominant ===
X-linked dominant disorders are caused by mutations in genes on the X chromosome. Only a few disorders have this inheritance pattern, with a prime example being X-linked hypophosphatemic rickets. Males and females are both affected in these disorders, with males typically being more severely affected than females. Some X-linked dominant conditions, such as Rett syndrome, incontinentia pigmenti type 2, and Aicardi syndrome, are usually fatal in males either &quot;in utero&quot; or shortly after birth, and are therefore predominantly seen in females. Exceptions to this finding are extremely rare cases in which boys with Klinefelter syndrome (44+xxy) also inherit an X-linked dominant condition and exhibit symptoms more similar to those of a female in terms of disease severity. The chance of passing on an X-linked dominant disorder differs between men and women. The sons of a man with an X-linked dominant disorder will all be unaffected (since they receive their father&#x27;s Y chromosome), but his daughters will all inherit the condition. A woman with an X-linked dominant disorder has a 50% chance of having an affected foetus with each pregnancy, although in cases such as incontinentia pigmenti, only female offspring are generally viable.

=== X-linked recessive ===

X-linked recessive conditions are also caused by mutations in genes on the X chromosome. Males are much more frequently affected than females, because they only have the one X chromosome necessary for the condition to present. The chance of passing on the disorder differs between men and women. The sons of a man with an X-linked recessive disorder will not be affected (since they receive their father&#x27;s Y chromosome), but his daughters will be carriers of one copy of the mutated gene. A woman who is a carrier of an X-linked recessive disorder (XRXr) has a 50% chance of having sons who are affected and a 50% chance of having daughters who are carriers of one copy of the mutated gene. X-linked recessive conditions include the serious diseases hemophilia A, Duchenne muscular dystrophy, and Lesch–Nyhan syndrome, as well as common and less serious conditions such as male pattern baldness and red–green color blindness. X-linked recessive conditions can sometimes manifest in females due to skewed X-inactivation or monosomy X (Turner syndrome).

=== Y-linked ===

Y-linked disorders are caused by mutations on the Y chromosome. These conditions may only be transmitted from the heterogametic sex (e.g. male humans) to offspring of the same sex. More simply, this means that Y-linked disorders in humans can only be passed from men to their sons; females can never be affected because they do not possess Y-allosomes.

Y-linked disorders are exceedingly rare but the most well-known examples typically cause infertility. Reproduction in such conditions is only possible through the circumvention of infertility by medical intervention.

=== Mitochondrial ===

This type of inheritance, also known as maternal inheritance, is the rarest and applies to the 13 genes encoded by mitochondrial DNA. Because only egg cells contribute mitochondria to the developing embryo, only mothers (who are affected) can pass on mitochondrial DNA conditions to their children. An example of this type of disorder is Leber&#x27;s hereditary optic neuropathy.

It is important to stress that the vast majority of mitochondrial diseases (particularly when symptoms develop in early life) are actually caused by a nuclear gene defect, as the mitochondria are mostly developed by non-mitochondrial DNA. These diseases most often follow autosomal recessive inheritance.

== Multifactorial disorder ==

Genetic disorders may also be complex, multifactorial, or polygenic, meaning they are likely associated with the effects of multiple genes in combination with lifestyles and environmental factors. Multifactorial disorders include heart disease and diabetes. Although complex disorders often cluster in families, they do not have a clear-cut pattern of inheritance. This makes it difficult to determine a person&#x27;s risk of inheriting or passing on these disorders. Complex disorders are also difficult to study and treat because the specific factors that cause most of these disorders have not yet been identified. Studies that aim to identify the cause of complex disorders can use several methodological approaches to determine genotype–phenotype associations. One method, the genotype-first approach, starts by identifying genetic variants within patients and then determining the associated clinical manifestations. This is opposed to the more traditional phenotype-first approach, and may identify causal factors that have previously been obscured by clinical heterogeneity, penetrance, and expressivity.

On a pedigree, polygenic diseases do tend to &quot;run in families&quot;, but the inheritance does not fit simple patterns as with Mendelian diseases. This does not mean that the genes cannot eventually be located and studied. There is also a strong environmental component to many of them (e.g., blood pressure).

Other such cases include:
* asthma
* autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis
* cancers
* ciliopathies
* cleft palate
* diabetes
* heart disease
* hypertension
* inflammatory bowel disease
* intellectual disability
* mood disorder
* obesity
* refractive error
* infertility

== Chromosomal disorder ==
A chromosomal disorder is a missing, extra, or irregular portion of chromosomal DNA. It can be from an atypical number of chromosomes or a structural abnormality in one or more chromosomes. An example of these disorders is Trisomy 21 (the most common form of Down syndrome), in which there is an extra copy of chromosome 21 in all cells.

== Diagnosis ==
Due to the wide range of genetic disorders that are known, diagnosis is widely varied and dependent of the disorder. Most genetic disorders are diagnosed pre-birth, at birth, or during early childhood however some, such as Huntington&#x27;s disease, can escape detection until the patient begins exhibiting symptoms well into adulthood.

The basic aspects of a genetic disorder rests on the inheritance of genetic material. With an in depth family history, it is possible to anticipate possible disorders in children which direct medical professionals to specific tests depending on the disorder and allow parents the chance to prepare for potential lifestyle changes, anticipate the possibility of stillbirth, or contemplate termination. Prenatal diagnosis can detect the presence of characteristic abnormalities in fetal development through ultrasound, or detect the presence of characteristic substances via invasive procedures which involve inserting probes or needles into the uterus such as in amniocentesis.

== Prognosis ==
Not all genetic disorders directly result in death; however, there are no known cures for genetic disorders. Many genetic disorders affect stages of development, such as Down syndrome, while others result in purely physical symptoms such as muscular dystrophy. Other disorders, such as Huntington&#x27;s disease, show no signs until adulthood. During the active time of a genetic disorder, patients mostly rely on maintaining or slowing the degradation of quality of life and maintain patient autonomy. This includes physical therapy and pain management.

== Treatment ==
The treatment of disorder an ongoing battle, with over 1,800 gene therapy clinical trials having been completed, are ongoing, or have been approved worldwide. Despite this, most treatment options revolve around treating the symptoms of the disorders in an attempt to improve patient quality of life. 

Gene therapy refers to a form of treatment where a healthy gene is introduced to a patient. This should alleviate the defect caused by a faulty gene or slow the progression of the disease. A major obstacle has been the delivery of genes to the appropriate cell, tissue, and organ affected by the disorder. Researchers have investigated how they can introduce a gene into the potentially trillions of cells that carry the defective copy. Finding an answer to this has been a roadblock between understanding the genetic disorder and correcting the genetic disorder.

== Epidemiology ==
Around 1 in 50 people are affected by a known single-gene disorder, while around 1 in 263 are affected by a chromosomal disorder. Around 65% of people have some kind of health problem as a result of congenital genetic mutations. Due to the significantly large number of genetic disorders, approximately 1 in 21 people are affected by a genetic disorder classified as &quot;rare&quot; (usually defined as affecting less than 1 in 2,000 people). Most genetic disorders are rare in themselves. There are well over 6,000 known genetic disorders, and new genetic disorders are constantly being described in medical literature.

== History ==
The earliest known genetic condition in a hominid was in the fossil species &quot;Paranthropus robustus,&quot; with over a third of individuals displaying amelogenesis imperfecta.

<doc id="12439" wikidata="Q169313" url="?curid=12439" title="Guanine">
<text>Guanine () (symbol G or Gua) is one of the four main nucleotide bases found in the nucleic acids DNA and RNA, the others being adenine, cytosine, and thymine (uracil in RNA). In DNA, guanine is paired with cytosine. The guanine nucleoside is called guanosine.

With the formula C5H5N5O, guanine is a derivative of purine, consisting of a fused pyrimidine-imidazole ring system with conjugated double bonds. This unsaturated arrangement means the bicyclic molecule is planar.

==Properties==
Guanine, along with adenine and cytosine, is present in both DNA and RNA, whereas thymine is usually seen only in DNA, and uracil only in RNA. Guanine has two tautomeric forms, the major keto form (see figures) and rare enol form.

It binds to cytosine through three hydrogen bonds. In cytosine, the amino group acts as the hydrogen bond donor and the C-2 carbonyl and the N-3 amine as the hydrogen-bond acceptors. Guanine has the C-6 carbonyl group that acts as the hydrogen bond acceptor, while a group at N-1 and the amino group at C-2 act as the hydrogen bond donors.

Guanine can be hydrolyzed with strong acid to glycine, ammonia, carbon dioxide, and carbon monoxide. First, guanine gets deaminated to become xanthine. Guanine oxidizes more readily than adenine, the other purine-derivative base in DNA. Its high melting point of 350 °C reflects the intermolecular hydrogen bonding between the oxo and amino groups in the molecules in the crystal. Because of this intermolecular bonding, guanine is relatively insoluble in water, but it is soluble in dilute acids and bases.

==History==
The first isolation of guanine was reported in 1844 by the German chemist (1819–1885), who obtained it as a mineral formed from the excreta of sea birds, which is known as guano and which was used as a source of fertilizer; guanine was named in 1846. Between 1882 and 1906, Emil Fischer determined the structure and also showed that uric acid can be converted to guanine.

==Synthesis==
Trace amounts of guanine form by the polymerization of ammonium cyanide (). Two experiments conducted by Levy et al. showed that heating 10 mol·L−1 at 80 °C for 24 hours gave a yield of 0.0007%, while using 0.1 mol·L−1 frozen at −20 °C for 25 years gave a 0.0035% yield. These results indicate guanine could arise in frozen regions of the primitive earth. In 1984, Yuasa reported a 0.00017% yield of guanine after the electrical discharge of , , , and 50 mL of water, followed by a subsequent acid hydrolysis. However, it is unknown whether the presence of guanine was not simply a resultant contaminant of the reaction.

:10NH3 + 2CH4 + 4C2H6 + 2H2O → 2C5H8N5O (guanine) + 25H2

A Fischer–Tropsch synthesis can also be used to form guanine, along with adenine, uracil, and thymine. Heating an equimolar gas mixture of CO, H2, and NH3 to 700 °C for 15 to 24 minutes, followed by quick cooling and then sustained reheating to 100 to 200 °C for 16 to 44 hours with an alumina catalyst, yielded guanine and uracil:
:10CO + H2 + 10NH3 → 2C5H8N5O (guanine) + 8H2O

Another possible abiotic route was explored by quenching a 90% N2–10%CO–H2O gas mixture high-temperature plasma.

Traube&#x27;s synthesis involves heating 2,4,5-triamino-1,6-dihydro-6-oxypyrimidine (as the sulfate) with formic acid for several hours.
==Biosynthesis==
Guanine is not synthesized de novo. Instead, it is split from the more complex molecule guanosine by the enzyme guanosine phosphorylase:

:guanosine + phosphate formula_1 guanine + alpha-D-ribose 1-phosphate
Guanine can be synthesized de novo, with the rate-limiting enzyme of inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase.

==Other occurrences and biological uses==
The word guanine derives from the Spanish loanword (&#x27;bird/bat droppings&#x27;), which itself is from the Quechua word , meaning &#x27;dung&#x27;. As the Oxford English Dictionary notes, guanine is &quot;A white amorphous substance obtained abundantly from guano, forming a constituent of the excrement of birds&quot;.

In 1656 in Paris, a Mr. Jaquin extracted from the scales of the fish &quot;Alburnus alburnus&quot; so-called &quot;pearl essence&quot;, which is crystalline guanine. In the cosmetics industry, crystalline guanine is used as an additive to various products (e.g., shampoos), where it provides a pearly iridescent effect. It is also used in metallic paints and simulated pearls and plastics. It provides shimmering luster to eye shadow and nail polish. Facial treatments using the droppings, or guano, from Japanese nightingales have been used in Japan and elsewhere, because the guanine in the droppings makes the skin look paler. Guanine crystals are rhombic platelets composed of multiple transparent layers, but they have a high index of refraction that partially reflects and transmits light from layer to layer, thus producing a pearly luster. It can be applied by spray, painting, or dipping. It may irritate the eyes. Its alternatives are mica, faux pearl (from ground shells), and aluminium and bronze particles.

Guanine has a very wide variety of biological uses that include a range of functions ranging in both complexity and versatility. These include camouflage, display, and vision among other purposes.

Spiders, scorpions, and some amphibians convert ammonia, as a product of protein metabolism in the cells, to guanine, as it can be excreted with minimal water loss.

Guanine is also found in specialized skin cells of fish called iridocytes (e.g., the sturgeon), as well as being present in the reflective deposits of the eyes of deep-sea fish and some reptiles, such as crocodiles and chameleons.

On 8 August 2011, a report, based on NASA studies with meteorites found on Earth, was published suggesting building blocks of DNA and RNA (guanine, adenine and related organic molecules) may have been formed extra-terrestrially in outer space.

<doc id="12441" wikidata="Q41397" url="?curid=12441" title="Genocide">
<text>Genocide is violence that targets individuals because of their membership of a group and aims at the destruction of a people. Raphael Lemkin, who first coined the term, defined genocide as &quot;the destruction of a nation or of an ethnic group&quot; by means such as &quot;the disintegration of [its] political and social institutions, of [its] culture, language, national feelings, religion, and [its] economic existence&quot;. During the struggle to ratify the Genocide Convention, powerful countries restricted Lemkin&#x27;s definition to exclude their own actions from being classified as genocide, ultimately limiting it to any of five &quot;acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group&quot;. While there are many scholarly definitions of genocide, almost all international bodies of law officially adjudicate the crime of genocide pursuant to the Genocide Convention.

Genocide has occurred throughout human history, even during prehistoric times, but is particularly likely in situations of imperial expansion and power consolidation. Therefore, it is usually associated with colonial empires and settler colonies, as well as with both world wars and repressive governments in the twentieth century. The colloquial understanding of genocide is heavily influenced by the Holocaust as its archetype and is conceived as innocent victims targeted for their ethnic identity rather than for any political reason. Genocide is widely considered to be the epitome of human evil and often referred to as the &quot;crime of crimes&quot;; consequently, events are often denounced as &quot;genocide&quot;.
== Origins ==
Polish-Jewish lawyer Raphael Lemkin coined the term &quot;genocide&quot; between 1941 and 1943. Lemkin&#x27;s coinage combined the Greek word (, &quot;race, people&quot;) with the Latin suffix (&quot;act of killing&quot;). He submitted the manuscript for his book &quot;Axis Rule in Occupied Europe&quot; to the publisher in early 1942, and it was published in 1944 as the Holocaust was coming to light outside Europe. Lemkin&#x27;s proposal was more ambitious than simply outlawing this type of mass slaughter. He also thought that the law against genocide could promote more tolerant and pluralistic societies. His response to Nazi criminality was sharply different from that of another international law scholar, Hersch Lauterpacht, who argued that it was essential to protect individuals from atrocities, whether or not they were targeted as members of a group.

According to Lemkin, the central definition of genocide was &quot;the destruction of a nation or of an ethnic group&quot; in which its members were not targeted as individuals, but rather as members of the group. The objectives of genocide &quot;would be the disintegration of the political and social institutions, of culture, language, national feelings, religion, and the economic existence of national groups&quot;. These were not separate crimes but different aspects of the same genocidal process. Lemkin&#x27;s definition of nation was sufficiently broad to apply to nearly any type of human collectivity, even one based on a trivial characteristic. He saw genocide as an inherently colonial process, and in his later writings analyzed what he described as the colonial genocides occurring within European overseas territories as well as the Soviet and Nazi empires. Furthermore, his definition of genocidal acts, which was to replace the national pattern of the victim with that of the perpetrator, was much broader than the five types enumerated in the Genocide Convention. Lemkin considered genocide to have occurred since the beginning of human history and dated the efforts to criminalize it to the Spanish critics of colonial excesses Francisco de Vitoria and Bartolomé de Las Casas. The 1946 judgement against Arthur Greiser issued by a Polish court was the first legal verdict that mentioned the term, using Lemkin&#x27;s original definition.

== Crime ==
=== Development ===

According to the legal instrument used to prosecute defeated German leaders at the International Military Tribunal at Nuremberg, atrocity crimes were only prosecutable by international justice if they were committed as part of an illegal war of aggression. The powers prosecuting the trial were unwilling to restrict a government&#x27;s actions against its own citizens.

In order to criminalize peacetime genocide, Lemkin brought his proposal to criminalize genocide to the newly established United Nations in 1946. Opposition to the convention was greater than Lemkin expected due to states&#x27; concerns that it would lead their own policies - including treatment of indigenous peoples, European colonialism, racial segregation in the United States, and Soviet nationalities policy - to be labeled genocide. Before the convention was passed, powerful countries (both Western powers and the Soviet Union) secured changes in an attempt to make the convention unenforceable and applicable to their geopolitical rivals&#x27; actions but not their own. Few formerly colonized countries were represented and &quot;most states had no interest in empowering their victims– past, present, and future&quot;.

The result severely diluted Lemkin&#x27;s original concept; he privately considered it a failure. Lemkin&#x27;s anti-colonial conception of genocide was transformed into one that favored colonial powers. Among the violence freed from the stigma of genocide included the destruction of political groups, which the Soviet Union is particularly blamed for blocking. Although Lemkin credited women&#x27;s NGOs with securing the passage of the convention, the gendered violence of forced pregnancy, marriage, and divorce was left out. Additionally omitted was the forced migration of populations—which had been carried out by the Soviet Union and its satellites, condoned by the Western Allies, against millions of Germans from central and Eastern Europe.

=== Genocide Convention ===
Two years after passing a resolution affirming the criminalization of genocide, the United Nations General Assembly adopted the Genocide Convention on 9 December 1948. It came into effect on 12 January 1951 after 20 countries ratified it without reservations. The convention defines genocide as:

A specific &quot;intent to destroy&quot; is the &quot;mens rea&quot; requirement of genocide. The issue of what it means to destroy a group &quot;as such&quot; and how to prove the required intent has been difficult for courts to resolve. The legal system has also struggled with how much of a group can be targeted before triggering the Genocide Convention. The two main approaches to intent are the purposive approach, where the perpetrator expressly wants to destroy the group, and the knowledge-based approach, where the perpetrator understands that destruction of the protected group will result from his actions. Intent is the most difficult aspect for prosecutors to prove; the perpetrators often claim that they merely sought the removal of the group from a given territory, instead of destruction as such, or that the genocidal actions were collateral damage of military activity.

Attempted genocide, conspiracy to commit genocide, incitement to genocide, and complicity in genocide are criminalized. The convention does not allow the retroactive prosecution of events that took place prior to 1951. Signatories are also required to prevent genocide and prosecute its perpetrators. Many countries have incorporated genocide into their municipal law, varying to a lesser or greater extent from the convention. The convention&#x27;s definition of genocide was adopted verbatim by the &quot;ad hoc&quot; international criminal tribunals and by the Rome Statute that established the International Criminal Court (ICC). The crime of genocide also exists in customary international law and is therefore prohibited for non-signatories.

=== Prosecutions ===
During the Cold War, genocide remained at the level of rhetoric because both superpowers (the United States and the Soviet Union) felt vulnerable to accusations of genocide, and were therefore unwilling to press charges against the other party. Despite political pressure to charge &quot;Soviet genocide&quot;, the United States government refused to ratify the convention fearing countercharges. Authorities have been reluctant to prosecute the perpetrators of many genocides, although non-judicial commissions of inquiry have also been created by some states.

International courts have found a small number of events as constituting genocide, such as Rwandan genocide and Srebrenica genocide. 

On 25 January 2010, Iraqi official Ali Hassan al-Majid (1st cousin of Saddam Hussein) was executed by hanging after being convicted of committing genocide by using chemical weapons against Iraq&#x27;s Kurdish population during the 1997–1998 Al-Anfal campaign. Al-Majid was captured following the 2003 invasion of Iraq. During the trial, the Iraqi court heard tape-recorded conversations between al-Majid and senior Ba&#x27;ath party officials regarding the use of chemical weapons: &quot;I will kill them all with chemical weapons! Who is going to say anything? The international community? Fuck them! The international community and those who listen to them.&quot; In the recordings, Al-Majid calls the Iraqi Kurdish leader Jalal Talabani &quot;wicked and a pimp&quot;, and promises not to leave alive anyone who speaks the Kurdish language.

The first head of state to be convicted of genocide was in 2018 for the Cambodian genocide.

Although it is widely recognized that punishment of the perpetrators cannot be of an order with their crimes, the trials often serve other purposes such as attempting to shape public perception of the past.

== Genocide studies ==

The field of genocide studies emerged in the 1970s and 1980s, as social science began to consider the phenomenon of genocide. Due to the occurrence of the Bosnian genocide, Rwandan genocide, and the Kosovo crisis, genocide studies exploded in the 1990s. In contrast to earlier researchers who took for granted the idea that liberal and democratic societies were less likely to commit genocide, revisionists associated with the International Network of Genocide Scholars emphasized how Western ideas led to genocide. The genocides of indigenous peoples as part of European colonialism were initially not recognized as a form of genocide. Pioneers of research into settler colonialism such as Patrick Wolfe spelled out the genocidal logic of settler projects, prompting a rethinking of colonialism. Many genocide scholars are concerned both with objective study of the topic, and obtaining insights that will help prevent future genocides.

=== Definitions ===

The definition of genocide generates controversy whenever a new case arises and debate erupts as to whether or not it qualifies as a genocide. Sociologist Martin Shaw writes, &quot;Few ideas are as important in public debate, but in few cases are the meaning and scope of a key idea less clearly agreed.&quot; Some scholars and activists use the Genocide Convention definition. Others prefer narrower definitions that indicate genocide is rare in human history, reducing genocide to mass killing or distinguishing it from other types of violence by the innocence, helplessness, or defencelessness of its victims. Most genocides occur during wartime, and distinguishing genocide or genocidal war from non-genocidal warfare can be difficult. Likewise, genocide is distinguished from violent and coercive forms of rule that aim to change behavior rather than destroy groups. Some definitions include political or social groups as potential victims of genocide. Many of the more sociologically oriented definitions of genocide overlap that of the crime against humanity of extermination, which refers to large-scale killing or induced death as part of a systematic attack on a civilian population. Isolated or short-lived phenomena that resemble genocide can be termed genocidal violence.

Cultural genocide or ethnocide—actions targeted at the reproduction of a group&#x27;s language, culture, or way of life—was part of Raphael Lemkin&#x27;s original concept, and its proponents in the 1940s argued that it, along with physical genocide, were two mechanisms aiming at the same goal: destruction of the targeted group. Because cultural genocide clearly applied to some colonial and assimilationist policies, several states with overseas colonies threatened to refuse to ratify the convention unless it was excluded. Most genocide scholars believe that both cultural genocide and structural violence should be included in the definition of genocide, if committed with intent to destroy the targeted group. Although included in Lemkin&#x27;s original concept and by some scholars, political groups were also excluded from the Genocide Convention. The result of this exclusion was that perpetrators of genocide could redefine their targets as being a political or military enemy, thus excluding them from consideration.

The overlap of law and history leads to contrasting perspectives on genocide. The law focuses on serious acts, limiting genocide to physical and biological aspects, necessitating intent to destroy a group, and protecting only defined classes of groups. Historians, however, explore the broader complexities of genocides, including long-term processes and various motives, without strict legal definitions. Some historians also recognize cultural adaptability after genocidal events.

=== Criticism of the concept of genocide and alternatives ===

Most civilian killings in the twentieth century were not from genocide, which only applies to select cases. Alternative terms have been coined to describe processes left outside narrower definitions of genocide. Ethnic cleansing—the forced expulsion of a population from a given territory—has achieved widespread currency, although many scholars recognize that it frequently overlaps with genocide, even where Lemkin&#x27;s definition is not used. Other terms ending in -cide have proliferated for the destruction of particular types of groupings: democide (people by a government), eliticide (the elite of a targeted group), ethnocide (ethnic groups), gendercide (gendered groupings), politicide (political groups), classicide (social classes), and urbicide (the destruction of a particular locality).

The word &quot;genocide&quot; inherently carries a value judgement as it is widely considered to be the epitome of human evil. In the past, violence that could be labeled genocide was sometimes celebrated—although it always had its critics. The idea that genocide sits on top of a hierarchy of atrocity crimes—that it is worse than crimes against humanity or war crimes—is controversial among scholars and it suggests that the protection of groups is more important than of individuals. Historian A. Dirk Moses argues that the prioritization of genocide causes other atrocities to not be considered in study and response.

== Causes ==


The colloquial understanding of genocide is heavily influenced by the Holocaust as its archetype and is conceived as innocent victims targeted because of racism rather than for any political reason. Genocide is not an end of itself, but a means to another end—often chosen by perpetrators after other options failed. Most are ultimately caused by its perpetrators perceiving an existential threat to their own existence, although this belief is usually exaggerated and can be entirely imagined. Particular threats to existing elites that have been correlated to genocide include both successful and attempted regime change via assassination, coups, revolutions, and civil wars.

Most genocides were not planned long in advance, but emerged through a process of gradual radicalization, often escalating to genocide following resistance by those targeted. Genocide perpetrators often fear—usually irrationally—that if they do not commit atrocities, they will suffer a similar fate as they inflict on their victims. Despite perpetrators&#x27; utilitarian goals, ideological factors are necessary to explain why genocide seems to be a desirable solution to the identified security problem. Noncombatants are harmed because of the collective guilt ascribed to an entire people—defined according to race but targeted because of its supposed security threat. Other motives for genocide have included theft, land grabbing, and revenge.

War is often described as the single most important enabler of genocide providing the weaponry, ideological justification, polarization between allies and enemies, and cover for carrying out extreme violence. A large proportion of genocides occurred under the course of imperial expansion and power consolidation. Although genocide is typically organized around pre-existing identity boundaries, it has the outcome of strengthening them. Although many scholars have emphasized the role of ideology in genocide, there is little agreement in how ideology contributes to violent outcomes; others have cited rational explanations for atrocities.

== Perpetrators ==
Genocides are usually driven by states and their agents, such as elites, political parties, bureaucracies, armed
forces, and paramilitaries. Civilians are often the leading agents when the genocide takes places in remote frontier areas. A common strategy is for state-sponsored atrocities to be carried out in secrecy by paramilitary groups, offering the benefit of plausible deniability while widening complicity in the atrocities. The leaders who organize genocide usually believe that their actions were justified and regret nothing.

How ordinary people can become involved in extraordinary violence under circumstances of acute conflict is poorly understood. The foot soldiers of genocide (as opposed to its organizers) are not demographically or psychologically aberrant. People who commit crimes during genocide are rarely true believers in the ideology behind genocide, although they are affected by it to some extent alongside other factors such as obedience, diffusion of responsibility, and conformity. Other evidence suggests that ideological propaganda is not effective in inducing people to commit genocide and that for some perpetrators, the dehumanization of victims, and adoption of nationalist or other ideologies that justify the violence occurs after they begin to perpetrate atrocities often coinciding with escalation. Although genocide perpetrators have often been assumed to be male, the role of women in perpetrating genocide—although they were historically excluded from leadership—has also been explored. People&#x27;s behavior changes under the course of events, and someone might choose to kill one genocide victim while saving another. Anthropologist Richard Rechtman writes that in circumstances where atrocities such as genocides are perpetrated, many people refuse to become perpetrators, which often entails great sacrifices such as risking their lives and fleeing their country.

== Methods ==

It is a common misconception that genocide necessarily involves mass killing; indeed, it may occur without a single person being killed.

Forced displacement is a common feature of many genocides, with the victims often transported to another location where their destruction is easier for the perpetrators. In some cases, victims are transported to sites where they are killed or deprived of the necessities of life. People are often killed by the displacement itself, as was the case for many Armenian genocide victims. Cultural destruction, such as that practised at Canadian boarding schools for indigenous children, is often dependent on controlling the victims at a specific location. Destruction of cultural objects, such as religious buildings, is common even when the primary method of genocide is not cultural. Cultural genocide, such as residential schools, is particularly common during settler-colonial consolidation.

Men, particularly young adults, are disproportionately targeted for killing before other victims in order to stem resistance. Although diverse forms of sexual violence—ranging from rape, forced pregnancy, forced marriage, sexual slavery, mutilation, forced sterilization—can affect either males or females, women are more likely to face it. The combination of killing of men and sexual violence against women is often intended to disrupt reproduction of the targeted group.

Almost all genocides are brought to an end either by the military defeat of the perpetrators or the accomplishment of their aims.

== Reactions ==
According to rational choice theory, it should be possible to intervene to prevent genocide by raising the costs of engaging in such violence relative to alternatives. Although there are a number of organizations that compile lists of states where genocide is considered likely to occur, the accuracy of these predictions are not known and there is no scholarly consensus over evidence-based genocide prevention strategies. Intervention to prevent genocide has often been considered a failure because most countries prioritize business, trade, and diplomatic relationships: as a consequence, &quot;the usual powerful actors continue to use violence against vulnerable populations with impunity&quot;.

Responsibility to protect is a doctrine that emerged around 2000, in the aftermath of several genocides around the world, that seeks to balance state sovereignty with the need for international intervention to prevent genocide. However, disagreements in the United Nations Security Council and lack of political will have hampered the implementation of this doctrine. Although military intervention to halt genocide has been credited with reducing violence in some cases, it remains deeply controversial and is usually illegal. Researcher Gregory H. Stanton found that calling crimes genocide rather than something else, such as ethnic cleansing, increased the chance of effective intervention. Perhaps for this reason, states are often reluctant to recognize crimes as genocide while they are taking place.

== History ==
Lemkin applied the concept of genocide to a wide variety of events throughout human history. He and other scholars date the first genocides to prehistoric times. Prior to the advent of civilizations consisting of sedentary farmers, humans lived in tribal societies, with intertribal warfare often ending with the obliteration of the defeated tribe, killing of adult males and integration of women and children into the victorious tribe. Genocide is mentioned in various ancient sources including the Hebrew Bible. The massacre of men and the enslavement or forced assimilation of women and children—often limited to a particular town or city rather than applied to a larger group—is a common feature of ancient warfare as described in written sources. The events that some scholars consider genocide in ancient and medieval times had more pragmatic than ideological motivations. As a result, some scholars such as Mark Levene argue that genocide is inherently connected to the modern state—thus to the rise of the West in the early modern era and its expansion outside Europe—and earlier conflicts cannot be described as genocide.

Although all empires rely on violence, often extreme violence, to perpetuate their own existence, they also seek to preserve and rule the conquered rather than eradicate them. Although the desire to exploit populations was a disincentive to extermination, imperial rule could lead to genocide when resistance emerged. Ancient and medieval genocides were often committed by empires. Unlike traditional empires, settler colonialism—particularly associated with the settlement of Europeans outside of Europe—is characterized by militarized populations of settlers in remote areas beyond effective state control. Rather than labor or economic surplus, the settlers want to acquire land from indigenous people making genocide more likely than with classical colonialism. While the lack of law enforcement on the frontier ensured impunity for settler violence, the advance of state authority enabled settlers to consolidate their gains using the legal system.

Genocide was committed on a large scale during both world wars. The prototypical genocide, the Holocaust, involved such large-scale logistics that it reinforced the impression that genocide was the result of civilization drifting off course and required both the &quot;weapons and infrastructure of the modern state and the radical ambitions of the modern man&quot;. Scientific racism and nationalism were common ideological drivers of many twentieth century genocides. After the horrors of World War II, world leaders attempted to proscribe genocide via the Genocide Convention. Despite the promise of never again and the international effort to outlaw genocide, it has continued to occur repeatedly into the twenty-first century.

== Effects and aftermath ==
In the aftermath of genocide, common occurrences are the attempt to prosecute perpetrators through the legal system and obtain recognition and reparations for survivors, as well as reflection of the events in scholarship and culture, such as genocide museums. Except in the case of the Holocaust, few genocide victims receive any reparations despite the trend of requiring such reparations in international and municipal law. The perpetrators and their supporters often deny the genocide and reject responsibility for the harms suffered by victims. Efforts to achieve justice and reconciliation are common in postgenocide situations, but are necessarily incomplete and inadequate. The effects of genocide on societies are under-researched.

Much of the qualitative research on genocide has focused on the testimonies of victims, survivors, and other eyewitnesses. Studies of genocide survivors have examined rates of depression, anxiety, schizophrenia, suicide, post-traumatic stress disorder, and post-traumatic growth. While some have found negative results, others find no association with genocide survival. There are no consistent findings that children of genocide survivors have worse health than comparable individuals. Most societies are able to recover demographically from genocide, but this is dependent on their position early in the demographic transition.
Because genocide is often perceived as the &quot;crime of crimes&quot;, it grabs attention more effectively than other violations of international law. Consequently, victims of atrocities often label their suffering genocide as an attempt to gain attention to their plight and attract foreign intervention. Although remembering genocide is often perceived as a way to develop tolerance and respect for human rights, the charge of genocide often leads to increased cohesion among the targeted people—in some cases, it has been incorporated into national identity—and stokes enmity towards the group blamed for the crime, reducing the chance of reconciliation and increasing the risk of future occurrence of genocide. Some genocides are commemorated in memorials or museums.
