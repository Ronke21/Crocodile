<text>The European Broadcasting Union (EBU; , UER) is an alliance of public service media organisations whose countries are within the European Broadcasting Area or who are members of the Council of Europe. , it is made up of 123 member organisations from 56 countries, and 31 associate members from a further 20 countries. It was established in 1950, and has its administrative headquarters in Geneva.

The EBU owns and operates the Eurovision and Euroradio telecommunications networks on which major television and radio broadcasts are distributed live to its members. It also operates the daily Eurovision news exchange in which members share breaking news footage. In 2017, the EBU launched the Eurovision Social Newswire, an eyewitness and video verification service. Led by Head of Social Newsgathering, Derek Bowler, the service provides members of the EBU with verified and cleared-for-use newsworthy eyewitness media emerging on social media.

The EBU, in co-operation with its members, produces programmes and organises events in which its members can participate, such as the Eurovision Song Contest, its best known production, or the Eurovision Debates between candidates for president of the European Commission for the 2014, 2019 and 2024 parliamentary elections. The Director-General is Noel Curran since 2017.

==General description==
EBU members are public service media (PSM) broadcasters established by law but are non-partisan, independent and run for the benefit of society as a whole.

EBU members come from as far north as Iceland and as far south as Egypt, from Ireland in the west and Azerbaijan in the east, and almost every nation from geographical Europe in between. Associate members from the United States include ABC, CBS, NBC, CPB, NPR, APM and the only individual station, Chicago-based classical music radio WFMT.

Membership is for media organisations whose countries are within the European Broadcasting Area, as defined by the International Telecommunication Union, or who are members of the Council of Europe.

Members benefit from:
*Access to content ranging from exclusive sports rights to exchanges for news, music and children&#x27;s programmes.
*Representatives in Brussels, and in other international arenas, lobbying for PSM and ensuring the optimal legal and technical framework for broadcasters.
*Opportunities for sharing, learning and collaborating through conferences, working groups, training, and dedicated advice and guidance.
*A centre for learning and sharing new technology and innovation with a team of experts providing strategic advice and guidance.

The EBU&#x27;s highest-profile production is the Eurovision Song Contest. The EBU also organises the Eurovision Dance Contest, the Junior Eurovision Song Contest, the Eurovision Young Dancers competition, and other competitions which are modeled along similar lines.

Radio collaborations include Euroclassic Notturno—an overnight classical music stream, produced by BBC Radio 3 and broadcast in the United Kingdom as &quot;Through the Night&quot;—and special theme days, such as the annual Christmas music relays from around Europe. The EBU is a member of the International Music Council.

Most EBU broadcasters have group deals to carry major sporting events including the FIFA World Cup and the inaugural European Championships. Another annually recurring event which is broadcast across Europe through the EBU is the Vienna New Year&#x27;s Concert.

Eurovision Media Services is the business arm of the EBU and provides media services for many media organisations and sports federations around the world.

===Ident===
The theme music played before and after every EBU broadcast is Marc-Antoine Charpentier&#x27;s &quot;Prelude to Te Deum&quot;. It is played before and after the Eurovision Song Contest and other important events.

==History==
The EBU was a successor to the International Broadcasting Union (IBU) that was founded in 1925 and had its administrative headquarters in Geneva and technical office in Brussels. It fostered programming exchanges between members and mediated technical disputes between members that were mostly concerned with frequency and interference issues. It was in effect taken over by Nazi Germany during the Second World War, and thereafter the Allies viewed it as a compromised organisation that they could not trust.

In the spring of 1946, representatives of the Soviet radio committee proposed forming a new organisation; however, at the same time preparations were being made for an inter-governmental &quot;European Broadcasting Conference&quot; in Copenhagen in 1948 to draw up a new plan for frequency use in the European Broadcasting Area. It was considered necessary to have an organisation that could implement the &quot;Copenhagen Wavelength Plan&quot; but there was disagreement among broadcasters and particularly a fear expressed by the BBC that a new association might be dominated by the USSR and its proposal to give each of its constituent states one vote. France proposed that it would have four votes with the inclusion of its North African colonies. The United Kingdom felt it would have little influence with just one vote.

On 27 June 1946, the alternative International Broadcasting Organisation (IBO) was founded with 26 members and without British participation. The following day the IBU met in General Assembly and an attempt was made to dissolve it but failed; though 18 of its 28 members left to join the IBO. For a period of time in the late 1940s both the IBU and IBO vied for the role of organising frequencies but Britain decided to be in involved in neither. The BBC attempted but failed to find suitable working arrangements with them. However, for practical purposes, the IBO rented the IBU technical centre in Brussels and employed its staff. The BBC then proposed a new solution based on the IBO changing its constitution so there will be only one member per International Telecommunication Union (ITU) country, thus ensuring a Western majority over the USSR and its satellite states. In August 1949 a meeting took place in Stresa, Italy but it resulted in disagreement between delegates on how to resolve the problems. One proposal was for the European Broadcasting Area to be replaced by one that would exclude Eastern Europe, the Levant and North Africa.

After Stresa, a consensus emerged among the Western Europeans to form a new organisation and the BBC proposed it be based in London. Meetings in Paris on 31 October and 1 November 1949 sealed the fate of the IBU and IBO, but it was decided not to allow West Germany to be a founder of the new organisation. On 13 February 1950 the European Broadcasting Union had its first meeting with 23 members from the ITU defined European Broadcasting Area at the Imperial Hotel in Torquay, England, United Kingdom. The first president was Ian Jacob of the BBC who remained at the helm for 10 years while its operation was largely dominated by the BBC due to its financial, technical and staff input. The most important difference between the EBU and its predecessors was that EBU membership was for broadcasters and not governments. Early delegates said EBU meetings were cordial and professional and very different from the abrupt tone of its predecessors. West Germany was admitted in 1951 and a working relationship forged with the USSR&#x27;s Organisation for International Radio and TV (OIRT) which existed in parallel with the EBU until its merger on 1 January 1993.

In 1967, the first concert in the International Concert Season of the European Broadcasting Union was broadcast from the Queen Elizabeth Hall in London.

==Technical activities==
The objective of the EBU&#x27;s technical activities is simply to assist EBU Members (see below) in this period of unprecedented technological changes. This includes the provision of technical information to Members via conferences and workshops, as well as in written form (such as the EBU Technical Review, and the EBU tech-&quot;i&quot; magazine).

The EBU also encourages active collaboration between its Members on the basis that they can freely share their knowledge and experience, thus achieving considerably more than individual Members could achieve by themselves. Much of this collaboration is achieved through Project Groups which study specific technical issues of common interest: for example, EBU Members have long been preparing for the revision of the 1961 Stockholm Plan.

The EBU places great emphasis on the use of open standards. Widespread use of open standards (such as MPEG-2, DAB, DVB, etc.) ensures interoperability between products from different vendors, as well as facilitating the exchange of programme material between EBU Members and promoting &quot;horizontal markets&quot; for the benefit of all consumers.

EBU Members and the EBU Technical Department have long played an important role in the development of many systems used in radio and television broadcasting, such as:
*The AES/EBU digital audio interface, formally known as AES3;
*Serial and parallel interfaces for digital video (ITU-R Recommendations 601 and 656);
*RDS – the radio data system used on FM broadcasting.
*The EBU Loudness Recommendation R 128 and &#x27;EBU Mode&#x27; meters (EBU Tech 3341)

The EBU has also actively encouraged the development and implementation of:

*Digital radio (DAB) through Eureka Project 147 and the WorldDAB Forum.
*DVB (Digital Video Broadcasting) through the DVB Project and DigiTAG.
*Digital radio in the bands currently used for AM broadcasting through Digital Radio Mondiale (DRM).
*Standardisation of PVR systems through the TV-Anytime Forum.
*Development of other content distribution networks on the internet through P2PTV; EBU Project Group D/P2P, from November 2007 to April 2008, with a trial of selected member channels, thanks to Octoshape&#x27;s distribution platform. The EBU is also part of the European P2P-Next project.

==Controversies==
===Greek state broadcaster (2013)===
On 11 June 2013, the Greek government shut down the state broadcaster Hellenic Broadcasting Corporation (ERT) on short notice, citing government spending concerns related to the European debt crisis. In response, the EBU set up a makeshift studio the same day near the former ERT offices in Athens in order to continue providing EBU members with the news-gathering and broadcast relay services which had formerly been provided by ERT. The EBU put out a statement expressing its &quot;profound dismay&quot; at the shutdown, urging the Greek Prime Minister &quot;to use all his powers to immediately reverse this decision&quot; and offered the &quot;advice, assistance and expertise necessary for ERT to be preserved&quot;. Starting on 4 May 2014, the new state broadcaster New Hellenic Radio, Internet and Television (NERIT) began nationwide transmissions, taking over ERT&#x27;s vacant active membership slot in the EBU. On 11 June 2015, two years after ERT&#x27;s closure, NERIT was renamed as Hellenic Broadcasting Corporation (ERT), which reopened with a comprehensive program in all radio stations (with nineteen regional, two world-range and five pan-Hellenic range radio stations) and three TV channels ERT1, ERT2 and ERT3.

===Belarusian state broadcaster (2021)===
The Belarusian Television and Radio Company (BTRC) has been accused of repressing its own employees, having fired more than 100 people since a wave of anti-Lukashenko protests in 2020 following alleged election fraud. Many of them have also been jailed. Many voices have been raised against the participation of Belarus and the BTRC in the Eurovision Song Contest in 2021, the argument being that the EBU would make a political statement if it did endorse Belarus by essentially and silently saying that democracy is unimportant and so are basic human rights such as freedom of speech.

On 28 May 2021, the EBU suspended the BTRC&#x27;s membership as they had been &quot;particularly alarmed by the broadcast of interviews apparently obtained under duress&quot;. BTRC was given two weeks to respond before the suspension came into effect, but did not do so publicly. The suspension of the broadcaster was made effective on 1 July 2021. Although initial reports mentioned that it would expire after three years, in April 2024 the EBU confirmed that the suspension had been made indefinite.

===Russian state broadcasters (2022)===
The three Russian members of the EBU, Channel One Russia, VGTRK, and Radio Dom Ostankino are all controlled by the Russian government. On 21 February 2022, the Russian government recognized the independence of the Donetsk and Luhansk People&#x27;s Republics, disputed territories that are internationally recognized as part of Ukraine. Ukraine&#x27;s public broadcaster Suspilne called on the EBU to terminate the membership of Channel One Russia and VGTRK, and to consider preventing Russia from participating in the Eurovision Song Contest 2022, citing the Russian government&#x27;s use of both outlets to spread disinformation surrounding the Russo-Ukrainian war. Following the Russian invasion of Ukraine, several other public broadcasters joined UA:PBC in calling for Russia&#x27;s exclusion from the 2022 Contest; Finland&#x27;s Yle and Estonia&#x27;s ERR stated that they would not send a representative if Russia was allowed to participate. After initially stating that both Russia and Ukraine would be allowed to compete, the EBU announced on 25 February 2022 that it would ban Russia from participating in the Contest.

The three Russian broadcasters announced, via a statement released by Russian state media, that they would withdraw from the EBU on 26 February, citing increased politicization of the organization. The EBU released a statement saying that it was aware of the reports, but that it had not received any formal confirmation. On 1 March, a further statement from the EBU announced that it had suspended its Russian members from its governance structures. On 26 May, the EBU made effective the suspension of its Russian members indefinitely.

In 2023, an extensive investigation by the EBU Investigative Journalism Network uncovered evidence of a Kremlin-sponsored initiative to take Ukrainian children from the war-torn country to Russia, a war crime under international law.

<text>Electrothermal-chemical (ETC) technology is an attempt to increase accuracy and muzzle energy of future tank, artillery, and close-in weapon system guns by improving the predictability and rate of expansion of propellants inside the barrel.

An electrothermal-chemical gun uses a plasma cartridge to ignite and control the ammunition&#x27;s propellant, using electrical energy to trigger the process. ETC increases the performance of conventional solid propellants, reduces the effect of temperature on propellant expansion and allows for more advanced, higher density propellants to be used.

The technology has been under development since the mid-1980s and in 1993 was actively being researched in the United States by the Army Research Laboratory, Sandia National Laboratories and defense industry contractors, including FMC Corporation, General Dynamics Land Systems, Olin Ordnance, and Soreq Nuclear Research Center. It is possible that electrothermal-chemical gun propulsion will be an integral part of US Army&#x27;s future combat system and those of other countries such as Germany and the United Kingdom. 
Electrothermal-chemical technology is part of a broad research and development program that encompasses all electric gun technology, such as railguns and coil guns.

== Background ==
The constant battle between armour and armor-piercing round has led to continuous development of the main battle tank design. The evolution of American anti-tank weapons can be traced back to requirements to combat Soviet tanks. In the late 1980s, it was thought that the protection level of the Future Soviet Tank (FST) could exceed 700 mm of rolled homogeneous armour equivalence at its maximum thickness, which was effectively immune against the contemporary M829 armour piercing fin stabilized discarding sabot. In the 1980s the most immediate method available to NATO to counter Soviet advances in armour technology was the adoption of a 140 mm main gun, but this required a redesigned turret that could incorporate the larger breech and ammunition, and it also required some sort of automatic loader. Although the 140 mm gun was considered a real interim solution, it was decided after the fall of the Soviet Union that the increase in muzzle energy it provided was not worth the increase in weight. Resources were therefore spent on research into other programs that could provide the needed muzzle energy. One of the most successful alternative technologies remains electrothermal-chemical ignition.

Most proposed advances in gun technology are based on the assumption that the solid propellant as a stand-alone propulsion system is no longer capable of delivering the required muzzle energy. This requirement has been underscored by the appearance of the Russian T-90 main battle tank. The elongation of current gun tubes, such as the new German 120 mm L/55, which was introduced by Rheinmetall is considered only an interim solution as it does not offer the required increase in muzzle velocity. Even advanced kinetic energy ammunition such as the United States&#x27; M829A3 is considered only an interim solution against future threats. To that extent the solid propellant is considered to have reached the end of its usefulness, although it will remain the principal propulsion method for at least the next decade until newer technologies mature. 

ETC technology offers a medium-risk upgrade and is developed to the point that further improvements are so minor that it can be considered mature. The lightweight American 120 mm XM291 came close to achieving 17 MJ of muzzle energy, which is the lower-end muzzle energy spectrum for a 140 mm gun. However, the success of the XM291 does not imply the success of ETC technology as there are key parts of the propulsion system that are not yet understood or fully developed, such as the plasma ignition process. Nevertheless, there is substantial existing evidence that ETC technology is viable and worth the money to continue development. Furthermore, it can be integrated into current gun systems.

== Operational principle ==
An electrothermal-chemical gun uses a plasma cartridge to ignite and control the ammunition&#x27;s propellant, using electrical energy as a catalyst to begin the process. Originally researched by Dr. Jon Parmentola for the U.S. Army, it has grown into a very plausible successor to a standard solid propellant tank gun. Since the beginning of research the United States has funded the XM291 gun project with US$4,000,000, basic research with US$300,000, and applied research with US$600,000. Since then it has been proven to work, although efficiency to the level required has not yet been accomplished. ETC increases the performance of conventional solid propellants, reduces the effect of temperature on propellant expansion and allows for more advanced, higher density propellants to be used. It will also reduce pressure placed on the barrel in comparison to alternative technologies that offer the same muzzle energy given the fact that it helps spread the propellant&#x27;s gas much more smoothly during ignition. Currently, there are two principal methods of plasma initiation: the flashboard large area emitter (FLARE) and the triple coaxial plasma igniter (TCPI).

=== Flashboard large area emitter ===
Flashboards run in several parallel strings to provide a large area of plasma or ultraviolet radiation and uses the breakdown and vaporization of gaps of diamonds to produce the required plasma. These parallel strings are mounted in tubes and oriented to have their gaps azimuthal to the tube&#x27;s axis. It discharges by using high pressure air to move air out of the way. FLARE initiators can ignite propellants through the release of plasma, or even through the use of ultraviolet heat radiation. The absorption length of a solid propellant is sufficient to be ignited by radiation from a plasma source. However, FLARE has most likely not reached optimal design requirements and further understanding of FLARE and how it works is completely necessary to ensure the evolution of the technology. If FLARE provided the XM291 gun project with the sufficient radiative heat to ignite the propellant to achieve a muzzle energy of 17 MJ one could only imagine the possibilities with a fully developed FLARE plasma igniter. Current areas of study include how plasma will affect the propellant through radiation, the deliverance of mechanical energy and heat directly and by driving gas flow. Despite these daunting tasks FLARE has been seen as the most plausible igniter for future application on ETC guns.

=== Triple coaxial plasma igniter ===
A coaxial igniter consists of a fully insulated conductor, covered by four strips of aluminium foil. All of this is further insulated in a tube about 1.6 cm in diameter that is perforated with small holes. The idea is to use an electrical flow through the conductor and then exploding the flow into vapour and then breaking it down into plasma. Consequently, the plasma escapes through the constant perforations throughout the insulating tube and initiates the surrounding propellant. A TCPI igniter is fitted in individual propellant cases for each round of ammunition. However, TCPI is no longer considered a viable method of propellant ignition because it may damage the fins and does not deliver energy as efficiently as a FLARE igniter.

== Feasibility ==
The XM291 is the best existing example of a working electrothermal-chemical gun. It was an alternative technology to the heavier caliber 140 mm gun by using the dual-caliber approach. It uses a breech that is large enough to accept 140 mm ammunition and be mounted with both a 120 mm barrel and a 135 mm or 140 mm barrel. The XM291 also mounts a larger gun tube and a larger ignition chamber than the existing M256 L/44 main gun. Through the application of electrothermal-chemical technology the XM291 has been able to achieve muzzle energy outputs that equate that to a low-level 140 mm gun, while achieving muzzle velocities greater than those of the larger 140 mm gun. Although the XM291 does not mean that ETC technology is viable it does offer an example that it is possible.

ETC requires much less energy input from outside sources, like a battery, than a railgun or a coilgun would. Tests have shown that energy output by the propellant is higher than energy input from outside sources on ETC guns. In comparison, a railgun currently cannot achieve a higher muzzle velocity than the amount of energy input. Even at 50% efficiency a rail gun launching a projectile with a kinetic energy of 20 MJ would require an energy input into the rails of 40 MJ, and 50% efficiency has not yet been achieved. To put this into perspective, a rail gun launching at 9 MJ of energy would need roughly 32 MJ worth of energy from capacitors. Current advances in energy storage allow for energy densities as high as 2.5 MJ/dm3, which means that a battery delivering 32 MJ of energy would require a volume of 12.8 dm3 per shot; this is not a viable volume for use in a modern main battle tank, especially one designed to be lighter than existing models. There has even been discussion about eliminating the necessity for an outside electrical source in ETC ignition by initiating the plasma cartridge through a small explosive force.

Furthermore, ETC technology is not only applicable to solid propellants. To increase muzzle velocity even further electrothermal-chemical ignition can work with liquid propellants, although this would require further research into plasma ignition. ETC technology is also compatible with existing projects to reduce the amount of recoil delivered to the vehicle while firing. Understandably, recoil of a gun firing a projectile at 17 MJ or more will increase directly with the increase in muzzle energy in accordance to Newton&#x27;s third law of motion and successful implementation of recoil reduction mechanisms will be vital to the installation of an ETC powered gun in an existing vehicle design. For example, OTO Melara&#x27;s new lightweight 120 mm L/45 gun has achieved a recoil force of 25 t by using a longer recoil mechanism (550 mm) and a pepperpot muzzle brake. Reduction in recoil can also be achieved through mass attenuation of the thermal sleeve. The ability of ETC technology to be applied to existing gun designs means that for future gun upgrades there&#x27;s no longer the necessity to redesign the turret to include a larger breech or caliber gun barrel.

Several countries have already determined that ETC technology is viable for the future and have funded indigenous projects considerably. These include the United States, Germany and the United Kingdom, amongst others. The United States&#x27; XM360, which was planned to equip the Future Combat Systems Mounted Combat System light tank and may be the M1 Abrams&#x27; next gun upgrade, is reportedly based on the XM291 and may include ETC technology, or portions of ETC technology. Tests of this gun have been performed using &quot;precision ignition&quot; technology, which may refer to ETC ignition.

<text>The Boeing E-3 Sentry is an American airborne early warning and control (AEW&amp;C) aircraft developed by Boeing. E-3s are commonly known as AWACS (Airborne Warning and Control System). Derived from the Boeing 707 airliner, it provides all-weather surveillance, command, control, and communications, and is used by the United States Air Force, NATO, French Air and Space Force, Royal Saudi Air Force and Chilean Air Force. The E-3 has a distinctive rotating radar dome (rotodome) above the fuselage. Production ended in 1992 after 68 aircraft had been built.

In the mid-1960s, the U.S. Air Force (USAF) was seeking an aircraft to replace its piston-engined Lockheed EC-121 Warning Star, which had been in service for over a decade. After issuing preliminary development contracts to three companies, the USAF picked Boeing to construct two airframes to test Westinghouse Electric&#x27;s and Hughes&#x27;s competing radars. Both radars used pulse-Doppler technology, with Westinghouse&#x27;s design emerging as the contract winner. Testing on the first production E-3 began in October 1975.

The first USAF E-3 was delivered in March 1977, and during the next seven years, a total of 34 aircraft were manufactured. E-3s were also purchased by NATO (18), the United Kingdom (7), France (4) and Saudi Arabia (5). In 1991, when the last aircraft had been delivered, E-3s participated in the Persian Gulf War, playing a crucial role of directing coalition aircraft against Iraqi forces.

The aircraft was also the last of the Boeing 707 derivatives after 34 years of continuous production. The aircraft&#x27;s capabilities have been maintained and enhanced through numerous upgrades. In 1996, Westinghouse Electric&#x27;s Defense &amp; Electronic Systems division was acquired by Northrop Corporation, before being renamed Northrop Grumman Mission Systems, which currently supports the E-3&#x27;s radar. In April 2022, the U.S. Air Force announced that the Boeing E-7 is to replace the E-3 beginning in 2027.

==Development==
===Background===
In 1963, the USAF asked for proposals for an Airborne Warning and Control System (AWACS) to replace its EC-121 Warning Stars, which had served in the airborne early warning role for over a decade. The new aircraft would take advantage of improvements in radar technology and computer-aided radar data analysis and data reduction. These developments allowed airborne radars to &quot;look down&quot;, i.e. to detect the movement of low-flying aircraft, and discriminate, even over land, target aircraft&#x27;s movements; previously this had been impossible due to the inability to discriminate an aircraft&#x27;s track from ground clutter. Contracts were issued to Boeing, Douglas, and Lockheed, the latter being eliminated in July 1966. In 1967, a parallel program was put into place to develop the radar, with Westinghouse Electric Corporation and Hughes Aircraft being asked to compete in producing the radar system. In 1968, it was referred to as Overland Radar Technology (ORT) during development tests on the modified EC-121Q. The Westinghouse radar antenna was going to be used by whichever company won the radar competition since Westinghouse had pioneered the design of high-power radio frequency (RF) phase-shifters, which are used to both focus the RF into a pencil beam and scan electronically for altitude determination.
Boeing initially proposed a purpose-built aircraft, but tests indicated it would not outperform the already-operational 707, so the latter was chosen instead. To increase endurance, this design was to be powered by eight General Electric TF34s. It would carry its radar in a rotating dome mounted at the top of a forward-swept tail, above the fuselage. Boeing was selected ahead of McDonnell Douglas&#x27;s DC-8-based proposal in July 1970. Initial orders were placed for two aircraft, designated EC-137D, as test beds to evaluate the two competing radars. As the test beds did not need the same 14-hour endurance demanded of the production aircraft, the EC-137s retained the Pratt &amp; Whitney JT3D commercial engines, and a later reduction in the endurance requirement led to retention of the JT3D engines in production.

The first EC-137 made its maiden flight on 9 February 1972, with the fly-off between the two radars taking place from March to July of that year. Favorable test results led to the selection of Westinghouse&#x27;s radar for the production aircraft. Hughes&#x27; radar was initially thought to be a certain winner due to its related development of the APG-63 radar for the new F-15 Eagle. The Westinghouse radar used a pipelined fast Fourier transform (FFT) to digitally resolve 128 Doppler frequencies, while Hughes&#x27;s radars used analog filters based on the design for the F-15. Westinghouse&#x27;s engineering team won this competition by using a programmable 18-bit computer whose software could be modified before each mission. This computer was the AN/AYK-8 design from the B-57G program, and designated AYK-8-EP1 for its much expanded memory. This radar also multiplexed a beyond-the-horizon (BTH) pulse mode that could complement the pulse-Doppler radar mode. This proved to be beneficial especially when the BTH mode is used to detect ships at sea when the radar beam is directed below the horizon.

===Full-scale development===
Approval was given on 26 January 1973 for the full-scale development of the AWACS system. To allow further development of the aircraft&#x27;s systems, orders were placed for three preproduction aircraft, the first of which performed its maiden flight in February 1975. IBM and Hazeltine were selected to develop the mission computer and display system. The IBM computer was designated 4PI, and the software was written in JOVIAL. A Semi-Automatic Ground Environment (SAGE) or back-up interceptor control (BUIC) operator would immediately be at home with the track displays and tabular displays, but differences in symbology would create compatibility problems in tactical ground radar systems in Iceland, mainland Europe, and South Korea over Link-11 (TADIL-A). In 1977, Iran placed an order for ten E-3s, however this order was cancelled following the Iranian Revolution.
Engineering, test and evaluation began on the first E-3 Sentry in October 1975. Between 1977 and 1992, a total of 68 E-3s were built.

===Future status===
Because the Boeing 707 is no longer in production, the E-3 mission package has been fitted into the Boeing E-767 for the Japan Air Self Defense Forces. The E-10 MC2A was intended to replace USAF E-3s—along with the RC-135 and the E-8 Joint STARS, but the program was canceled by the Department of Defense.

NATO intends to extend the operational status of its AWACS until 2035 when it is due to be replaced by the Alliance Future Surveillance and Control (AFSC) program. The Royal Air Force (RAF) chose to limit investment in its E-3D fleet in the early 2000s, diverting Sentry upgrade funds to a replacement program. On 22 March 2019, the UK Defence Secretary announced a $1.98 billion (~$ in ) contract to purchase five Boeing E-7 Wedgetails. The U.S. Air Force intends to retire 15 of its 31 E-3s and acquire the E-7.

On 31 March 2023, the USAF retired an E-3 from service for the first time.

==Design==
===Overview===

The E-3 Sentry&#x27;s airframe is a modified Boeing 707-320B Advanced model. Modifications include a rotating radar dome (rotodome), uprated hydraulics from 241 to 345 bar (3500–5000 psi) to drive the rotodome, single-point ground refueling, air refueling, and a bail-out tunnel or chute. A second bail-out chute was deleted to cut mounting costs.

USAF and NATO E-3s have an unrefueled range of or 8 hours of flying. The newer E-3 versions bought by France, Saudi Arabia, and the UK are equipped with newer CFM56-2 turbofan engines, and these can fly for about 11 hours or more than . The Sentry&#x27;s range and on-station time can be increased through air-to-air refueling and the crews can work in shifts by the use of an on-board crew rest and meals area. The aircraft are equipped with one toilet in the rear, and a urinal behind the cockpit. Saudi E-3s were delivered with an additional toilet in the rear.

When deployed, the E-3 monitors an assigned area of the battlefield and provides information for commanders of air operations to gain and maintain control of the battle; while as an air defense asset, E-3s can detect, identify, and track airborne enemy forces far from the boundaries of the U.S. or NATO countries and can direct interceptor aircraft to these targets. In support of air-to-ground operations, the E-3 can provide direct information needed for interdiction, reconnaissance, airlift, and close-air support for friendly ground forces.

===Avionics===
The unpressurized rotodome is in diameter, thick at the center, and is held above the fuselage by 2 struts. It is tilted down at the front to reduce its aerodynamic drag, which lessens its detrimental effect on take-offs and endurance. This tilt is corrected electronically by both the radar and secondary surveillance radar antenna phase shifters. The rotodome uses bleed air, outside cooling doors, and fluorocarbon-based cold plate cooling to maintain the electronic and mechanical equipment temperatures. The hydraulically rotated antenna system permits the and AN/APY-2 passive electronically scanned array radar system to provide surveillance from the Earth&#x27;s surface up into the stratosphere, over land or water.
Other major subsystems in the E-3 Sentry are navigation, communications, and computers. 14 consoles display computer-processed data in graphic and tabular format on screens. Its operators perform surveillance, identification, weapons control, battle management and communications functions. Data may be forwarded in real-time to any major command and control center in rear areas or aboard ships. In times of crisis, data may also be forwarded to the National Command Authority in the U.S. via RC-135 or aircraft carrier task forces.

Electrical generators mounted in each of the E-3&#x27;s four engines provide 1 megawatt of electrical power required by the aircraft&#x27;s radars and electronics. Its pulse-Doppler radar has a range of more than 250 mi (400 km) for low-flying targets at its operating altitude, and the pulse (BTH) radar has a range of approximately 400 mi (650 km) for aircraft flying at medium to high altitudes. The radar, combined with a secondary surveillance radar (SSR) and electronic support measures (ESM), provides a look down capability, to detect, identify, and track low-flying aircraft, while eliminating ground clutter returns.

===Upgrades===
Between 1987 and 2001, USAF E-3s were upgraded under the &quot;Block 30/35 Modification Program&quot;. Enhancements included:
*The installation of ESM and an electronic surveillance capability, for both active and passive means of detection. 
*Installation of the Class 2H Joint Tactical Information Distribution System (JTIDS), which provides rapid and secure communication for transmitting information, including target positions and identification data, to other friendly platforms. This upgraded system allowed the Link 16 military tactical data link capability to be added as part of the Block 30/35 upgrade. Prior versions of the E-3 (NATO/US Standard and 20/25) had the Class 1 (Hughes) JTIDS system which was not Link 16 capable.
*Global Positioning System (GPS) capability was added. 
*Onboard computers and software were overhauled to accommodate the JTIDS Class 2H, Link 16, the new ESM systems and to allow for future enhancements.

====RSIP====
The Radar System Improvement Program (RSIP) was a joint US/NATO development program. RSIP enhances the operational capability of the E-3 radars&#x27; electronic countermeasures, and improves the system&#x27;s reliability, maintainability, and availability. Essentially, this program replaced the older transistor-transistor logic (TTL) and emitter-coupled logic (MECL) electronic components, long-since out of production, with off-the-shelf computers that utilised a High-level programming language instead of assembly language. Significant improvement came from adding pulse compression to the pulse-Doppler mode. These hardware and software modifications improve the E-3 radars&#x27; performance, providing enhanced detection with an emphasis towards low radar cross-section (RCS) targets.

The RAF had also joined the USAF in adding RSIP to upgrade the E-3&#x27;s radars. The retrofitting of the E-3 squadrons was completed in December 2000. Along with the RSIP upgrade was installation of the Global Positioning System/Inertial Navigation Systems which improved positioning accuracy. In 2002, Boeing was awarded a contract to add RSIP to the small French AWACS squadron. Installation was completed in 2006. Saudi Arabia began RSIP upgrades in 2013; the first aircraft being upgraded by Boeing in Seattle with the four remaining aircraft upgraded in Riyadh between 2014 and 2016.

====NATO Mid Term Program====
Between 2000 and 2008 NATO upgraded its E-3s to &quot;Mid Term Program&quot; (MTP) standard. This involved technical upgrades and a total multi-sensor-systems integration

====DRAGON====
In 2009, the USAF, in cooperation with NATO, entered into a major flight deck avionics modernization program in order to maintain compliance with worldwide airspace mandates. The program, called DRAGON (for DMS Replacement of Avionics for Global Operation and Navigation), was awarded to Boeing and Rockwell Collins in 2010. Drawing on their Flight2 flight management system (FMS), almost all the avionics were replaced with more modern digital equipment from Rockwell Collins. Main upgrades include a Digital Audio Distribution System, Mode-5/ADS-B transponder, Inmarsat and VDL datalinks, and a terrain awareness and warning system (TAWS). The centerpiece flight deck hardware consists of five 6x8 color graphics displays and two color CDUs. DRAGON laid the foundation for subsequent upgrades including GPS M-Code, Iridium ATC, and Autopilot. USAF DRAGON Production began in 2018.

====USAF Block 40/45====
In 2014 the USAF began upgrading block 30/35 E-3B/Cs into block 40/45 E-3Gs. This upgrade replaces the main flight computer with a Red Hat Linux-based system, as well as replacing the DOS 2.0-like operating system with a Windows 95-like system on the operator workstations. In 2016, a three-week long cybersecurity vulnerability test revealed that the 40/45 block and its supporting ground equipment were vulnerable to cyber threats, and were thus deemed &quot;not survivable.&quot; This caused a delay of approximately two years. Twenty-four E-3s are projected to complete this upgrade to 40/45 by the end of fiscal year 2020, while seven aircraft will be retired to save upgrade costs and harvest out-of-production components.

====NATO Final Lifetime Extension Program====
NATO intends to extend the operational status of its AWACS until 2035 by significantly upgrading fourteen aircraft in the &quot;Final Lifetime Extension Program&quot; (FLEP) between 2019 and 2026. Upgrades include the expansion of data capacity, expansion of bandwidth for satellite communications, new encryption equipment, new HAVE QUICK radios, upgraded mission computing software and new operator consoles. The supporting ground systems (mission training center and mission planning and evaluation system) will also be upgraded to the latest standard. NATO Airborne Early Warning &amp; Control Program Management Agency (NAPMA) is the preparing and executing authority for the FLEP. FLEP will be combined with the standard planned higher echelon technical maintenance.

==Operational history==
===United States===
In March 1977 the 552nd Airborne Warning and Control Wing received the first E-3 aircraft at Tinker AFB, Oklahoma. The 34th and last USAF Sentry was delivered in June 1984. The USAF has a total of thirty E-3s in active service. Twenty-six are stationed at Tinker AFB and belong to the Air Combat Command (ACC). Four are assigned to the Pacific Air Forces (PACAF) and stationed at Kadena AB, Okinawa and Elmendorf AFB, Alaska. One aircraft (TS-3) was assigned to Boeing for testing and development (retired/scrapped June 2012).

E-3 Sentry aircraft were among the first to deploy during Operation Desert Shield, where they established a radar screen to monitor Iraqi forces. During Operation Desert Storm, E-3s flew 379 missions and logged 5,052 hours of on-station time. The data collection capability of the E-3 radar and computer subsystems allowed an entire air war to be recorded for the first time. In addition to providing senior leadership with time-critical information on the actions of enemy forces, E-3 controllers assisted in 38 of the 41 air-to-air kills recorded during the conflict.

NATO, UK, French and USAF AWACS played an important role in the air campaign against Serbia and Montenegro in the former republic of FR Yugoslavia. From March to June 1999 the aircraft were deployed in the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia (operation Allied Force) directing allied strike and air defence aircraft to and from their targets. Over 1,000 aircraft operating from bases in Germany and Italy took part in the air campaign which was intended to destroy Yugoslav air defenses and high-value targets such as the bridges across the Danube river, factories, power stations, telecommunications facilities, and military installations.

On 18 November 2015, an E-3G was deployed to the Middle East to begin flying combat missions in support of Operation Inherent Resolve against ISIL, marking the first combat deployment of the upgraded Block 40/45 aircraft.

===United Kingdom===
In February 1987 the UK and France ordered E-3 aircraft in a joint project which saw deliveries start in 1991. The British requirement arose due to the cancellation of the BAE Nimrod AEW3 project. UK E-3Ds contributed to the NATO Airborne Early Warning and Control Force (NAEWCF), receiving much of their tasking directly from NATO. However, RAF E-3Ds remained UK-crewed and capable of independent, national tasking.

In 2009, the UK effectively limited the service life of the E-3D fleet by de-funding the Project Eagle upgrade which would have seen it upgraded in line with the USAF Block 40/45 standard. &quot;AirForces Monthly&quot; reported that by December 2020, just 2 aircraft were available for operations at any one time. The Strategic Defence and Security Review 2015 had announced the intention to retain the E-3D fleet until 2035, however in March 2019, the Ministry of Defence announced that the E-3Ds would be replaced by five E-7 Wedgetails from 2023. The £1.51 billion contract was awarded to Boeing without a competitive procurement process, a decision criticised by both competitors of Boeing and the UK&#x27;s Defence Select Committee. The 2021 Integrated Defence Review confirmed a reduced order of three aircraft. On 27 January 2015, the RAF deployed an E-3D Sentry to Cyprus in support of U.S.-led coalition airstrikes against Islamic State militants in Iraq and Syria. The last operational flight by an RAF E3 Sentry was in July 2021 with the Sentry subsequently retired from service.

===France===
In February 1987 the UK and France ordered E-3 aircraft in a joint project which saw deliveries start in 1991. France operates its E-3F aircraft independently of NATO. France operates four aircraft, all fitted with the newer CFM56-2 engines.

In early 2024, there were reports that France is looking to the Swedish Saab GlobalEye to replace its AWACS aircraft.

===Chile===
Three Boeing E-3D Sentry (Sentry AEW.1) aircraft, acquired second hand from the United Kingdom in September 2021, arrived in Chile in July 2022; units ZH103 and ZH106 will join the &quot;Grupo de Aviación N.º 10&quot; of the II Air Brigade. The other E-3D will reportedly be used as a source of spare parts.

===NATO===
NATO acquired 18 E-3As and support equipment, with the first aircraft delivered in January 1982. The aircraft are registered in Luxembourg. The eighteen E-3s were operated by Number 1, 2 and 3 Squadrons of NATO&#x27;s E-3 Component, based at NATO Air Base Geilenkirchen.

NATO E-3s participated in Operation Eagle Assist after the September 11 attacks on the World Trade Center towers and the Pentagon. NATO and RAF E-3s participated in the military intervention in Libya.

From January 2011 to September 2014, NATO E-3s were deployed to Mazar-i-Sharif International Airport, Afghanistan, as part of NATO&#x27;s International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) mission. The aircraft were used for air traffic control of military aircraft over the country, as well as surveillance, and tactical management of friendly aircraft. During the mission to Afghanistan, NATO E-3s flew 1,240 missions and accumulated 12,240 flying hours.

Presently, 14 NATO E-3As are in the inventory, since one E-3 was lost in a crash and three were retired from service in 2015, 2017, and 2018. The first was due for its six-year cycle Depot Level Maintenance (DLM) inspection which would have been very costly. The &quot;449 Retirement Project&quot; resulted in reclamation of critical parts with a value of upwards of $40 million which will be used to support the remaining active aircraft. Some of the parts to be removed are no longer on the market or have become very expensive.

==Incidents and accidents==
E-3s have been involved in three hull-loss accidents, and one radar antenna was destroyed during RSIP development (see photo under Avionics).
* On 22 September 1995, a U.S. Air Force E-3 Sentry (callsign Yukla 27, serial number 77-0354), crashed shortly after takeoff from Elmendorf AFB, Alaska. The plane lost power to both left side engines after ingesting several Canada geese during takeoff. The aircraft went down about northeast of the runway, killing all 24 crew members on board.
* On 14 July 1996, a NATO E-3 Sentry (tail number LX-N90457) overran the runway and crashed into a sea wall at Preveza-Aktion Airport in Greece when the pilot attempted to abort takeoff after mistakenly believing that the aircraft had suffered a bird strike. The aircraft overran the runway and struck a sea wall, where it came to a halt. There were no injuries and the aircraft was written off. Investigators could find no evidence that a bird strike and ingestion had occurred.
* On 28 August 2009, a U.S. Air Force E-3C Sentry (serial number 83-0008) participating in a Red Flag exercise at Nellis Air Force Base, Nevada experienced a nose gear collapse on landing, resulting in a fire and damaging the aircraft beyond repair. All 32 crew members evacuated safely.

<text>The Northrop Grumman E-8 Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System (Joint STARS) is a retired United States Air Force (USAF) airborne ground surveillance, battle management and command and control aircraft. It tracked ground vehicles and some aircraft, collected imagery, and relayed tactical pictures to ground and air theater commanders. Until its retirement in 2023 the aircraft was operated by both active duty USAF and Air National Guard units, with specially trained U.S. Army personnel as additional flight crew.

==Development==

Joint STARS evolved from separate U.S. Army and Air Force (USAF) programs to develop technology to detect, locate and attack enemy armor at ranges beyond the front line of a battle. In 1982, the programs were merged and the USAF became the lead agent. The concept and sensor technology for the E-8 was developed and tested on the Tacit Blue experimental aircraft. The prime contract was awarded to Grumman Aerospace Corporation in September 1985 for two E-8A development systems.

In late 2005, Northrop Grumman was awarded a contract for upgrading engines and other systems. Pratt &amp; Whitney, in a joint venture with Seven Q Seven (SQS), was contracted to produce and deliver JT8D-219 engines for the E-8s. Their greater efficiency would have allowed the Joint STARS to spend more time on station, take off from a wider range of runways, climb faster, fly higher, all with a much reduced cost per flying hour.

In December 2008, an E-8C test aircraft took its first flight with the new engines. In 2009, the company began engine replacement and additional upgrade efforts. The re-engining funding was halted in 2009 as the Air Force began to consider other options for performing the JSTARS mission.

==Design==

The E-8C is an aircraft modified from the Boeing 707-300 series commercial airliner. The E-8 carries specialized radar, communications, operations and control subsystems. The most prominent external feature is the 40 ft (12 m) canoe-shaped radome under the forward fuselage that houses the 24 ft (7.3 m) APY-7 active electronically scanned array side looking airborne radar antenna.

The E-8C can respond quickly and effectively to support worldwide military contingency operations. It is a jam-resistant system capable of operating while experiencing heavy electronic countermeasures. The E-8C can fly a mission profile for 9 hours without refueling. Its range and on-station time can be substantially increased through in-flight refueling.

The AN/APY-7 radar can operate in wide area surveillance, ground moving target indicator (GMTI), fixed target indicator (FTI) target classification, and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) modes.

To pick up moving targets, the Doppler radar looks at the Doppler frequency shift of the returned signal. It can look from a long-range, which the military refers to as a high standoff capability. The antenna can be tilted to either side of the aircraft for a 120-degree field of view covering nearly 19,305 square miles (50,000 km2) and can simultaneously track at more than 152 miles (250 km). The GMTI modes cannot pick up objects that are too small, insufficiently dense, or stationary. Data processing allows the APY-7 to differentiate between armored vehicles (tracked tanks) and trucks, allowing targeting personnel to better select the appropriate ordnance for various targets.

The system&#x27;s SAR modes can produce images of stationary objects. Objects with many angles (for example, the interior of a pick-up bed) will give a much better radar signature, or specular return. In addition to being able to detect, locate and track large numbers of ground vehicles, the radar has a limited capability to detect helicopters, rotating antennas and low, slow-moving fixed-wing aircraft.
The radar and computer subsystems on the E-8C can gather and display broad and detailed battlefield information. Data is collected as events occur. This includes position and tracking information on enemy and friendly ground forces. The information is relayed in near-real time to the US Army&#x27;s common ground stations via the secure jam-resistant surveillance and control data link (SCDL) and to other ground C4I nodes beyond line-of-sight via ultra high-frequency satellite communications.

Other major E-8C prime mission equipment are the communications/datalink (COMM/DLX) and operations and control (O&amp;C) subsystems. Eighteen operator workstations display computer-processed data in graphic and tabular format on video screens. Operators and technicians perform battle management, surveillance, weapons, intelligence, communications and maintenance functions.

Northrop Grumman has tested the installation of a MS-177 camera on an E-8C to provide real time visual target confirmation.

The Multi-Platform Radar Technology Insertion Program (MP-RTIP) radar system was proposed as a more capable replacement of the AN/APY-7. The USAF ended up pursuing cheaper ways to modernize the E-8, though the MP-RTIP receiver technology did see use in the form of JSTARS Radar Modernization (JSRM).

===Battle management ===
In missions from peacekeeping operations to major theater war, the E-8C can provide targeting data and intelligence for attack aviation, naval surface fire, field artillery and friendly maneuver forces. The information helps air and land commanders to control the battlespace.

The E-8&#x27;s ground-moving radar can tell approximate number of vehicles, location, speed, and direction of travel. It cannot identify exactly what type of vehicle a target is, tell what equipment it has, or discern whether it is friendly, hostile, or a bystander, so commanders often crosscheck the JSTARS data against other sources. In the Army, JSTARS data is analyzed in and disseminated from a Ground Station Module (GSM).

Other improvement programs that have been applied to the E-8C include JSTARS Net Enabled Weapons (JNEW) and Joint Surface Warfare (JSuW); Blue Force Tracker (BFT); and Battlefield Airborne Communications Node (BACN) compatibility.

==Operational history==

The two E-8A development aircraft were deployed in 1991 to participate in Operation Desert Storm under the direction of USAF Colonel Harry H. Heimple, Program Director, even though they were still in development. The joint program accurately tracked mobile Iraqi forces, including tanks and Scud missiles. Crews flew developmental aircraft on 49 combat sorties, accumulating more than 500 combat hours and a 100% mission effectiveness rate.

These Joint STARS developmental aircraft also participated in Operation Joint Endeavor, a NATO peacekeeping mission, in December 1995. While flying in friendly air space, the test-bed E-8A and pre-production E-8C aircraft monitored ground movements to confirm compliance with the Dayton Peace Accords agreements. Crews flew 95 consecutive operational sorties and more than 1,000 flight hours with a 98% mission effectiveness rate.

The 93d Air Control Wing, which activated 29 January 1996, accepted its first aircraft on 11 June 1996, and deployed in support of Operation Joint Endeavor in October. The provisional 93d Air Expeditionary Group monitored treaty compliance while NATO rotated troops through Bosnia and Herzegovina. The first production E-8C and a pre-production E-8C flew 36 operational sorties and more than 470 flight hours with a 100% effectiveness rate. The wing declared initial operational capability 18 December 1997 after receiving the second production aircraft. Operation Allied Force saw Joint STARS in action again from February to June 1999 accumulating more than 1,000 flight hours and a 94.5% mission-effectiveness rate in support of the U.S.-lead Kosovo War.

The twelfth production aircraft, outfitted with an upgraded operations and control subsystem, was delivered to the USAF on 5 November 2001.

On 1 October 2002, the 93d Air Control Wing (93 ACW) was &quot;blended&quot; with the 116th Bomb Wing in a ceremony at Robins Air Force Base (AFB), Georgia. The 116 BW was an Air National Guard wing equipped with B-1B Lancer bombers at Robins. As a result of a USAF reorganization of the B-1B force, all B-1Bs were assigned to active duty wings, resulting in the 116 BW lacking a current mission. The newly created wing was designated 116th Air Control Wing (116 ACW) and the 93 ACW was inactivated the same day. The 116 ACW constituted the first fully blended wing of active duty and Air National Guard airmen. The wing took delivery of the 17th and final E-8C on 23 March 2005.

The E-8C Joint STARS routinely supports various taskings of the Combined Force Command Korea during the North Korean winter exercise cycle and for the United Nations enforcing resolutions on Iraq.

In March 2009, a Joint STARS aircraft was damaged beyond economical repair when a test plug was left on a fuel tank vent, subsequently causing the fuel tank to rupture during in-flight refueling. There were no casualties but the aircraft sustained $25 million in damage.

In September 2009, Loren B. Thompson of the Lexington Institute raised the question of why most of the Joint STARS fleet was sitting idle instead of being used to track insurgents in Afghanistan. Thompson states that the Joint STARS&#x27; radar has an inherent capacity to find what the Army calls &#x27;dismounted&#x27; targets—insurgents walking around or placing roadside bombs. Thompson&#x27;s neutrality has been questioned by some since Lexington Institute has been heavily funded by defense contractors, including Northrop Grumman.

Recent trials of Joint STARS in Afghanistan are destined to develop tactics, techniques and procedures in tracking dismounted, moving groups of Taliban.

In January 2011, Northrop Grumman&#x27;s E-8C Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System (Joint STARS) test bed aircraft completed the second of two deployments to Naval Air Station Point Mugu, California, in support of the U.S. Navy Joint Surface Warfare Joint Capability Technology Demonstration to test its network-enabled weapon architecture. The Joint STARS aircraft executed three Operational Utility Assessment flights and demonstrated its ability to guide anti-ship weapons against surface combatants at a variety of standoff distances in the NEW architecture.

From 2001 to January 2011 the Joint STARS fleet flew more than 63,000 hours in 5,200 combat missions in support of Operations Iraqi Freedom, Enduring Freedom and New Dawn.

On 1 October 2011, the &quot;blended&quot; wing construct of the 116th Air Control Wing (116 ACW), combining Air National Guard and Regular Air Force personnel in a single unit was discontinued. On this date, the 461st Air Control Wing (461 ACW) was established at Robins AFB as the Air Force&#x27;s sole active duty E-8 Joint STARS wing while the 116 ACW reverted to a traditional Air National Guard wing within the Georgia Air National Guard. Both units share the same E-8 aircraft and will often fly with mixed crews, but now function as separate units.

On 1 October 2019, JSTARS ended its continuous presence in the United States Central Command (USCENTCOM) areas of responsibility. The 18–year deployment was the second-longest deployment in U.S. Air Force history. In that time, the crews and aircraft flew 10,938 sorties, and 114,426.6 combat hours.

On 11 February 2022, the first of four JSTARS out of the remaining 16 operational JSTARS was retired as detailed in the Fiscal Year 2022 National Defence Authorisation Act (NDAA). The plane (serial number 92-3289/GA) which was the first to arrive at Robins AFB in 1996 has now been transferred to the 309th Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Group at Davis–Monthan Air Force Base.
From late 2021 to early 2022, E-8C JSTARS aircraft deployed to Europe during the prelude to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Thirty years after entering service, it was performing the type of mission it had originally been intended to: monitoring Russian military activity in Eastern Europe, which it did while operating over Ukrainian airspace until the start of the invasion in late February 2022.

===Retirement===
The USAF began an analysis of alternatives (AOA) in March 2010 for its next generation GMTI radar aircraft fleet. The study was completed in March 2012 and recommended buying a new business jet-based ISR aircraft, such as a version of the Boeing 737, and the Gulfstream 550. The Air Force said Joint STARS was expected to remain in operation through 2030.

On 23 January 2014, the USAF revealed a plan for the acquisition of a new business jet-class replacement for the E-8C Joint STARS. The program was called Joint STARS Recap and planned for the aircraft to reach initial operating capability (IOC) by 2022. The aircraft would be more efficient, and separate contracts would be awarded for developing the aircraft, airborne sensor, battle management command and control (BMC2) system, and communications subsystem.

On 8 April 2014, the Air Force held an industry day for companies interested in competing for JSTARS Recap; attendees included Boeing, Bombardier Aerospace, and Gulfstream Aerospace. Air Force procurement documents called for a replacement for the Boeing 707-based E-8C as a &quot;business jet class&quot; aircraft that is &quot;significantly smaller and more efficient.&quot; Indicative specification were for an aircraft with a 10-13 person crew with a radar array and capable of flying at 38,000 ft for eight hours. In August 2015, the Air Force issued contracts to Boeing, Lockheed Martin, and Northrop Grumman for a one-year pre-engineering and manufacturing development effort to mature and test competing designs ahead of a downselect in late 2017.

During the fiscal 2019 budget rollout briefing it was announced that the Air Force will not move forward with an E-8C replacement aircraft. Funding for the JSTARS recapitalization program was instead be diverted to pay for development of an Advanced Battle Management System.

The E-8C JSTARS began to be retired in February 2022, and flew its last operational sortie on 21 September 2023. Rather than procure a replacement aircraft, the USAF intends to use a network of satellites, aircraft sensors and ground radars as a cheaper and more resilient approach to collecting similar targeting and tracking data. The JSTARS performed its last flight on 15 November 2023. The aircraft conducted some 14,000 operational sorties, flying more than 141,000 hours over 32 years of service.

<text>Eric Cheney (5 January 1924 – 30 December 2001) was an English motorcycle racer, designer and independent constructor. He was known as one of the best motorcycle frame designers of his era, concentrating mainly in the off-road competition aftermarket.

==Early life==
Cheney attended a school in Winchester based on Lancasterian principles before joining the Royal Navy at the age of 18, where he served on wartime Arctic convoys and in motor torpedo boats and gained experience of engineering and working on high performance engines. Cheney also worked on the development of remote controlled submarines for the Royal Navy.

==Career==
After World War II, Cheney joined the motorcycle dealers Archers of Aldershot as a mechanic. Cheney began racing motocross and became one Britain&#x27;s best riders, along with his travelling companion Les Archer, who went on to become European champion. He had ten successful years on the Continental circuit but a prolonged illness due to an infection contracted while racing in Algeria ended his riding career. He moved into bike preparation and designs for motorcycle chassis and suspension systems.

Cheney had no formal training as a motorcycle designer yet was able to create original and high-performance motorcycle chassis designs working in a simple workshop that was essentially a domestic garage. His approach has been described as &quot;like a medieval engineer&quot; as in an age of computer-aided design and significant resources for research and development teams, he worked entirely by intuition. Eric relied on his long personal experience of international off-road competition riding and would prepare his initial designs for a new motorcycle frame in chalk on the wall of his workshop. Experimenting with different lines until he was satisfied, Cheney would then form the steel tubing using his chalk drawings as a guide. Only when he had built a working prototype motorcycle would he start work on a final jig for mass production. He was once quoted as saying &quot;I know when it&#x27;s right and it screams at me when it&#x27;s wrong.&quot;

In the late 1960s, the British motorcycle industry was unable to support a national team to compete in the International Six Days Trial so, Cheney hand built a limited number of ISDT Cheney-Triumphs using his own design of twin down-tube frame with a specially tuned Triumph 5TA engine. Fitted with tapered conical hubs, special motocross forks and large alloy fuel tanks, a Cheney Triumph was first used in the 1968 British Trophy Team. In 1970 and 1971 three 504cc Cheney Triumphs were used by the British team in the ISDT, in which Cheney won a manufacturer&#x27;s prize. Replicas were built, but production was short-lived due to a shortage of engines.
Cheney&#x27;s most noted successes were in the Grand Prix road racing championships, with Phil Read using his chassis in tandem with a Yamaha engine to win the 1971 250cc world championship. His designs were the last British ones to win a Grand Prix. He never worked for any of the major manufacturers but maintained a productive relationship with BSA in its heyday. After the demise of BSA in 1972, Cheney joined with former BSA factory rider John Banks to develop and campaign a highly successful BSA powered motocross bike.

Some of Cheney&#x27;s motorcycle designs are now famous in their own right, such as the competition BSA Gold Stars of Jerry Scott and Keith Hickman and the John Banks replica which used a BSA B50 engine specially tuned by Cheney. He also built some racing frames for Suzuki Grand Prix motorcycles in 1968 and, it has been suggested that Suzuki engineers incorporated features of Cheney&#x27;s designs, such as magnesium hubs and lower fork legs into production road going motorcycles. Cheney&#x27;s company was originally known as Eric Cheney Designs, then changed to Inter-Moto, now known as Cheney Racing.

==Steve McQueen==
American actor Steve McQueen, an experienced off-road rider who represented the United States in the ISDT bought a number of Cheney&#x27;s motorcycles at full price because he considered them better than other makes.

<text>Econometrics is an application of statistical methods to economic data in order to give empirical content to economic relationships. More precisely, it is &quot;the quantitative analysis of actual economic phenomena based on the concurrent development of theory and observation, related by appropriate methods of inference.&quot; An introductory economics textbook describes econometrics as allowing economists &quot;to sift through mountains of data to extract simple relationships.&quot; Jan Tinbergen is one of the two founding fathers of econometrics. The other, Ragnar Frisch, also coined the term in the sense in which it is used today.

A basic tool for econometrics is the multiple linear regression model. &quot;Econometric theory&quot; uses statistical theory and mathematical statistics to evaluate and develop econometric methods. Econometricians try to find estimators that have desirable statistical properties including unbiasedness, efficiency, and consistency. &quot;Applied econometrics&quot; uses theoretical econometrics and real-world data for assessing economic theories, developing econometric models, analysing economic history, and forecasting.

==Basic models: linear regression==
A basic tool for econometrics is the multiple linear regression model. In modern econometrics, other statistical tools are frequently used, but linear regression is still the most frequently used starting point for an analysis. Estimating a linear regression on two variables can be visualized as fitting a line through data points representing paired values of the independent and dependent variables.

For example, consider Okun&#x27;s law, which relates GDP growth to the unemployment rate. This relationship is represented in a linear regression where the change in unemployment rate (formula_1) is a function of an intercept (formula_2), a given value of GDP growth multiplied by a slope coefficient formula_3 and an error term, formula_4:

:formula_5

The unknown parameters formula_2 and formula_3 can be estimated. Here formula_2 is estimated to be 0.83 and formula_3 is estimated to be -1.77. This means that if GDP growth increased by one percentage point, the unemployment rate would be predicted to drop by 1.77 * 1 points, other things held constant. The model could then be tested for statistical significance as to whether an increase in GDP growth is associated with a decrease in the unemployment, as hypothesized. If the estimate of formula_3 were not significantly different from 0, the test would fail to find evidence that changes in the growth rate and unemployment rate were related. The variance in a prediction of the dependent variable (unemployment) as a function of the independent variable (GDP growth) is given in polynomial least squares.

==Theory==

Econometric theory uses statistical theory and mathematical statistics to evaluate and develop econometric methods. Econometricians try to find estimators that have desirable statistical properties including unbiasedness, efficiency, and consistency. An estimator is unbiased if its expected value is the true value of the parameter; it is consistent if it converges to the true value as the sample size gets larger, and it is efficient if the estimator has lower standard error than other unbiased estimators for a given sample size. Ordinary least squares (OLS) is often used for estimation since it provides the BLUE or &quot;best linear unbiased estimator&quot; (where &quot;best&quot; means most efficient, unbiased estimator) given the Gauss-Markov assumptions. When these assumptions are violated or other statistical properties are desired, other estimation techniques such as maximum likelihood estimation, generalized method of moments, or generalized least squares are used. Estimators that incorporate prior beliefs are advocated by those who favour Bayesian statistics over traditional, classical or &quot;frequentist&quot; approaches.

==Methods==
&quot;Applied econometrics&quot; uses theoretical econometrics and real-world data for assessing economic theories, developing econometric models, analysing economic history, and forecasting.

Econometrics uses standard statistical models to study economic questions, but most often these are based on observational data, rather than data from controlled experiments. In this, the design of observational studies in econometrics is similar to the design of studies in other observational disciplines, such as astronomy, epidemiology, sociology and political science. Analysis of data from an observational study is guided by the study protocol, although exploratory data analysis may be useful for generating new hypotheses. Economics often analyses systems of equations and inequalities, such as supply and demand hypothesized to be in equilibrium. Consequently, the field of econometrics has developed methods for identification and estimation of simultaneous equations models. These methods are analogous to methods used in other areas of science, such as the field of system identification in systems analysis and control theory. Such methods may allow researchers to estimate models and investigate their empirical consequences, without directly manipulating the system.

In the absence of evidence from controlled experiments, econometricians often seek illuminating natural experiments or apply quasi-experimental methods to draw credible causal inference. The methods include regression discontinuity design, instrumental variables, and difference-in-differences.

==Example==
A simple example of a relationship in econometrics from the field of labour economics is:

:formula_11

This example assumes that the natural logarithm of a person&#x27;s wage is a linear function of the number of years of education that person has acquired. The parameter formula_12 measures the increase in the natural log of the wage attributable to one more year of education. The term formula_4 is a random variable representing all other factors that may have direct influence on wage. The econometric goal is to estimate the parameters, formula_14 under specific assumptions about the random variable formula_4. For example, if formula_4 is uncorrelated with years of education, then the equation can be estimated with ordinary least squares.

If the researcher could randomly assign people to different levels of education, the data set thus generated would allow estimation of the effect of changes in years of education on wages. In reality, those experiments cannot be conducted. Instead, the econometrician observes the years of education of and the wages paid to people who differ along many dimensions. Given this kind of data, the estimated coefficient on years of education in the equation above reflects both the effect of education on wages and the effect of other variables on wages, if those other variables were correlated with education. For example, people born in certain places may have higher wages and higher levels of education. Unless the econometrician controls for place of birth in the above equation, the effect of birthplace on wages may be falsely attributed to the effect of education on wages.

The most obvious way to control for birthplace is to include a measure of the effect of birthplace in the equation above. Exclusion of birthplace, together with the assumption that formula_17 is uncorrelated with education produces a misspecified model. Another technique is to include in the equation additional set of measured covariates which are not instrumental variables, yet render formula_12 identifiable. An overview of econometric methods used to study this problem were provided by Card (1999).

==Journals==
The main journals that publish work in econometrics are:

* &quot;Econometrica&quot;, which is published by Econometric Society.
* &quot;The Review of Economics and Statistics&quot;, which is over 100 years old.
* &quot;The Econometrics Journal&quot;, which was established by the Royal Economic Society.
* The &quot;Journal of Econometrics&quot;, which also publishes the supplement &quot;Annals of Econometrics.&quot;
* &quot;Econometric Theory&quot;, which is a theoretical journal.
* The &quot;Journal of Applied Econometrics&quot;, which applies econometrics to a wide various problems.
* &quot;Econometric Reviews&quot;, which includes reviews on econometric books and software as well.
* The &quot;Journal of Business &amp; Economic Statistics,&quot; which is published by the American Statistical Association.

==Limitations and criticisms==
Like other forms of statistical analysis, badly specified econometric models may show a spurious relationship where two variables are correlated but causally unrelated. In a study of the use of econometrics in major economics journals, McCloskey concluded that some economists report &quot;p&quot;-values (following the Fisherian tradition of tests of significance of point null-hypotheses) and neglect concerns of type II errors; some economists fail to report estimates of the size of effects (apart from statistical significance) and to discuss their economic importance. She also argues that some economists also fail to use economic reasoning for model selection, especially for deciding which variables to include in a regression.

In some cases, economic variables cannot be experimentally manipulated as treatments randomly assigned to subjects. In such cases, economists rely on observational studies, often using data sets with many strongly associated covariates, resulting in enormous numbers of models with similar explanatory ability but different covariates and regression estimates. Regarding the plurality of models compatible with observational data-sets, Edward Leamer urged that &quot;professionals ... properly withhold belief until an inference can be shown to be adequately insensitive to the choice of assumptions&quot;.

<text>Ellen Gezina Maria van Langen (; born 9 February 1966) is a Dutch former middle distance runner, who specialised in the 800 metres. A talented but injury-ridden athlete, she was the 1992 Olympic Champion for the women&#x27;s 800 meters. She is now the director of the FBK Games (the Hengelo meeting).

==Career==
Van Langen was born in Oldenzaal, Overijssel. Before she started running she played football. She only started to run seriously at 20. In 1989, she won her first of four national championships in the 800 meters and went on to win a silver medal behind Ana Quirot (Cuba) at the World Student Games (Universiade), running 1:59.82. In 1990, she finished fourth in the final of the European Championships in Split, with a Dutch national record of 1:57.57, behind the East German athletes Sigrun Wodars (gold), Christine Wachtel (silver) and Liliya Nurutdinova (bronze) from the Soviet Union.

During the year 1991, she was troubled by an Achilles tendon injury. At the Tokyo World Championships she was eliminated in the heats. The next year, leading up to the 1992 Olympic Games in Barcelona, she defeated Tokyo gold medallist Liliya Nurutdinova at the Fanny Blankers-Koen Games in Hengelo on 28 June in 1:56.66, the fastest time of the season prior to the Games. Just two weeks before the Olympics, she ran another fast time of 1:56.92 at Hechtel.

At the 1992 Olympic Games in Barcelona, Van Langen won the Olympic title in the 800 metres in a time of 1:55.54, a time which is still the Dutch national record. Fearing her final sprint, her competitors including favorites Nurutdinova, Quirot, Ella Kovacs (Romania) and Maria Mutola (Mozambique) set a rapid pace, running the first lap in a very fast time of 55.73, with Van Langen only in 6th position. Entering the final stretch Nurutdinova, who had led the final from the start, had a slight lead but Van Langen moved through on the inside in the last 50m to win a surprise victory, beating Nurutdinova (silver) and Quirot (bronze).

The year 1992 remained her top year, when she won 10 of her 11 800m races. After her Olympic triumph, she was plagued by various injuries. Her best result after 1992 was a 6th-place finish at the 1995 World Championships at Gothenburg. The ongoing injuries prevented her from defending her Olympic title in 1996. She retired from the sport in 1998.

Van Langen later explained the secret of her success. &quot;I think what I could do well is I could die very well in a race and still continue,” she said. “That is very hard, because it hurts running the 800 meters. You have to overcome some boundaries in yourself to continue when it hurts like hell. I was good at it. If the Olympic race would have been run by each athlete individual and the fastest time was the winner I would not have won.&quot; She added: &quot;I was also good in tactics, looking around me and taking the right decisions.&quot;

After her gold medal win in 1992 the Amsterdam unemployment benefits office terminated her dole on grounds that she might earn money from her victory in the future. She has a degree in economics from the University of Amsterdam, and currently works as an event manager for Global Sports Communication.

Van Langen is the director of the Fanny Blankers-Koen Games in Hengelo.

<doc id="10392" wikidata="Q1334586" url="?curid=10392" title="Emacs Lisp">
<text>Emacs Lisp is a Lisp dialect made for Emacs.
It is used for implementing most of the editing functionality built into Emacs, the remainder being written in C, as is the Lisp interpreter.

Emacs Lisp code is used to modify, extend and customize Emacs.
Those not wanting to write the code themselves can use the Customize function instead. It provides a set of preferences pages allowing the user to set options and preview their effect in the running Emacs session. 
When the user saves their changes,
Customize simply writes the necessary Emacs Lisp code to the user&#x27;s config file, which can be set to a special file that only Customize uses, to avoid the possibility of altering the user&#x27;s own file.

Besides being a programming language that can be compiled to bytecode
and transcompiled to native code,
Emacs Lisp can also function as an interpreted scripting language, much like the Unix Bourne shell or Perl, by calling Emacs in &quot;batch mode&quot;. 
In this way it may be called from the command line or via an executable file, and its editing functions, such as buffers and movement commands are available to the program just as in the normal mode. No user interface is presented when Emacs is started in batch mode; it simply executes the passed-in script and exits, displaying any output from the script.

Emacs Lisp is also termed Elisp, although there are also older, unrelated Lisp dialects with that name.

==Compared to other Lisp dialects==
Emacs Lisp is most closely related to Maclisp, with some later influence from Common Lisp. It supports imperative and functional programming methods. Lisp was the default extension language for Emacs derivatives such as EINE and ZWEI. When Richard Stallman forked Gosling Emacs into GNU Emacs, he also chose Lisp as the extension language, because of its powerful features, including the ability to treat functions as data. Although the Common Lisp standard had yet to be formulated, Scheme existed at the time but Stallman chose not to use it because of its comparatively poor performance on workstations (as opposed to the minicomputers that were Emacs&#x27; traditional home), and he wanted to develop a dialect which he thought would be more easily optimized.

The Lisp dialect used in Emacs differs substantially from the more modern Common Lisp and Scheme dialects used for applications programming. A prominent characteristic of Emacs Lisp is in its use of dynamic rather than lexical scope by default. That is, a function may reference local variables in the scope it is called from, but not in the scope where it was defined. Recently, there has been an ongoing effort to update code to use lexical scoping, for reasons outlined below.

==Example==

The development of Emacs Lisp was guided by the goal of providing data structures and features specific to making a versatile text editor over implementing a general-purpose programming language. For example, Emacs Lisp cannot easily read a file a line at a time—the entire file must be read into an Emacs buffer. However, Emacs Lisp provides many features for navigating and modifying buffer text at a sentence, paragraph, or higher syntactic level as defined by modes.

Here follows a simple example of an Emacs extension written in Emacs Lisp. In Emacs, the editing area can be split into separate areas called &quot;windows&quot;, each displaying a different &quot;buffer&quot;. A buffer is a region of text loaded into Emacs&#x27; memory (possibly from a file) which can be saved into a text document.

Users can press the default C-x 2 key binding to open a new window. This runs the Emacs Lisp function codice_1. Normally, when the new window appears, it displays the same buffer as the previous one. Suppose we wish to make it display the next available buffer. In order to do this, the user writes the following Emacs Lisp code, in either an existing Emacs Lisp source file or an empty Emacs buffer:
(defun my-split-window-func ()
 (interactive)
 (split-window-below)
 (set-window-buffer (next-window) (other-buffer)))

(global-set-key (kbd &quot;C-x 2&quot;) #&#x27;my-split-window-func)
The first statement, codice_2, defines a new function, codice_3, which calls codice_1 (the old window-splitting function), then tells the new window to display another (new) buffer. The second statement, codice_5 re-binds the key sequence &quot;C-x 2&quot; to the new function.

This can also be written using the feature called &quot;advice&quot;, which allows the user to create wrappers around existing functions instead of defining their own. This has the advantage of not requiring keybindings to be changed and working wherever the original function is called, as well as being simpler to write but the disadvantage of making debugging more complicated. For this reason, &quot;advice&quot; is not allowed in the source code of GNU Emacs, but if a user wishes, the advice feature can be used in their code to reimplement the above code as follows:
(defadvice split-window-below
 (after my-window-splitting-advice first () activate)
 (set-window-buffer (next-window) (other-buffer)))
This instructs codice_1 to execute the user-supplied code whenever it is called, after executing the rest of the function. Advice can also be specified to execute before the original function, around it (literally wrapping the original), or to conditionally execute the original function based on the results of the advice.

Emacs 24.4 replaces this codice_7 mechanism with codice_8, which is claimed to be more flexible and simpler. The advice above could be reimplemented using the new system as:
(defun switch-to-next-window-in-split ()
 (set-window-buffer (next-window) (other-buffer)))

(advice-add &#x27;split-window-below :before #&#x27;switch-to-next-window-in-split)
These changes take effect as soon as the code is evaluated. It is not necessary to recompile, restart Emacs, or even rehash a configuration file. If the code is saved into an Emacs init file, then Emacs will load the extension the next time it starts. Otherwise, the changes must be reevaluated manually when Emacs is restarted.

==Source code==
Emacs Lisp code is stored in filesystems as plain text files, by convention with the filename suffix &quot;codice_9&quot;. The user&#x27;s init file is an exception, often appearing as &quot;codice_10&quot; despite being evaluated as any Emacs Lisp code. Since the mid-1990s, Emacs also loads codice_11 and codice_12. Additionally, users may specify any file to load as a config file on the command line, or explicitly state that no config file is to be loaded. When the files are loaded, an interpreter component of the Emacs program reads and parses the functions and variables, storing them in memory. They are then available to other editing functions, and to user commands. Functions and variables can be freely modified and redefined without restarting the editor or reloading the config file.

In order to save time and memory space, much of the functionality of Emacs loads only when required. Each set of optional features shipped with Emacs is implemented by a collection of Emacs code called a package or library. For example, there is a library for highlighting keywords in program source code, and a library for playing the game of Tetris. Each library is implemented using one or more Emacs Lisp source files. Libraries can define one or more &quot;major modes&quot; to activate and control their function.

Emacs developers write certain functions in C. These are &quot;primitives&quot;, also termed &quot;built-in functions&quot; or &quot;subrs&quot;. Although primitives can be called from Lisp code, they can only be modified by editing the C source files and recompiling. In GNU Emacs, primitives are not available as external libraries; they are part of the Emacs executable. In XEmacs, runtime loading of such primitives is possible, using the operating system&#x27;s support for dynamic linking. Functions may be written as primitives because they need access to external data and libraries not otherwise available from Emacs Lisp, or because they are called often enough that the comparative speed of C versus Emacs Lisp makes a worthwhile difference.

However, because errors in C code can easily lead to segmentation violations or to more subtle bugs, which crash the editor, and because writing C code that interacts correctly with the Emacs Lisp garbage collector is error-prone, the number of functions implemented as primitives is kept to a necessary minimum.

===Byte code===
&quot;Byte-compiling&quot; can make Emacs Lisp code execute faster. Emacs contains a compiler which can translate Emacs Lisp source files into a special representation termed bytecode. Emacs Lisp bytecode files have the filename suffix &quot;codice_13&quot;. Compared to source files, bytecode files load and run faster, occupy less disk space, and use less memory when loaded.

Bytecode still runs more slowly than primitives, but functions loaded as bytecode can be easily modified and re-loaded. In addition, bytecode files are platform-independent. The standard Emacs Lisp code distributed with Emacs is loaded as bytecode, although the matching source files are usually provided for the user&#x27;s reference as well. User-supplied extensions are typically not byte-compiled, as they are neither as large nor as computationally intensive.

==Language features==

Notably, the &quot;cl-lib&quot; package implements a fairly large subset of Common Lisp. This package replaces an earlier &quot;cl&quot; package, which would overwrite existing Emacs Lisp function definitions with ones more similar to those found in Common Lisp. The &quot;cl-lib&quot; package, on the other hand, follows Emacs Lisp style guidelines more closely and prefixes each function and macro it defines with &quot;cl-&quot; (e.g., codice_14, which doesn&#x27;t conflict with the name of the built-in codice_15), avoiding the unexpected changes in behavior that could occur whenever the &quot;cl&quot; package was loaded.

Emacs Lisp (unlike some other Lisp implementations) does not do tail-call optimization. Without this, tail recursions can eventually lead to stack overflow.

The apel library aids in writing portable Emacs Lisp code, with the help of the polysylabi platform bridge.

Emacs Lisp is a Lisp-2 like Common Lisp, meaning that it has a function namespace which is separate from the namespace it uses for other variables.

===From dynamic to lexical scoping===
Like MacLisp, Emacs Lisp uses dynamic scope, offering static (or lexical) as an option starting from version 24. It can be activated by setting the file local variable codice_16. Before this option was added, one could use the codice_17 macro from the (now deprecated) &quot;cl&quot; package to provide effective lexical scope.

In dynamic scoping, if a programmer declares a variable within the scope of a function, it is available to subroutines called from within that function. Originally, this was intended as an optimization; lexical scoping was still uncommon and of uncertain performance. In computer scientist Olin Shivers&#x27;s recollection, &quot;I asked RMS when he was implementing emacs lisp why it was dynamically scoped and his exact reply was that lexical scope was too inefficient.&quot; Dynamic scoping was also meant to provide greater flexibility for user customizations. However, dynamic scoping has several disadvantages. Firstly, it can easily lead to bugs in large programs, due to unintended interactions between variables in different functions. Secondly, accessing variables under dynamic scoping is generally slower than under lexical scoping.

<text>Edward George Earle Lytton Bulwer-Lytton, 1st Baron Lytton, (; 25 May 1803 – 18 January 1873), was an English writer and politician. He served as a Whig member of Parliament from 1831 to 1841 and a Conservative from 1851 to 1866. He was Secretary of State for the Colonies from June 1858 to June 1859, choosing Richard Clement Moody as founder of British Columbia. He was created Baron Lytton of Knebworth in 1866.

Bulwer-Lytton&#x27;s works were well known in his time. He coined famous phrases like &quot;pursuit of the almighty dollar&quot;, &quot;the pen is mightier than the sword&quot;, &quot;dweller on the threshold&quot;, &quot;the great unwashed&quot;, and the opening phrase &quot;It was a dark and stormy night.&quot; The sardonic Bulwer-Lytton Fiction Contest, held annually since 1982, claims to seek the &quot;opening sentence of the worst of all possible novels&quot;.

==Life==
Bulwer was born on 25 May 1803 to General William Earle Bulwer of Heydon Hall and Wood Dalling, Norfolk, and Elizabeth Barbara Lytton, daughter of Richard Warburton Lytton of Knebworth House, Hertfordshire. He had two older brothers, William Earle Lytton Bulwer (1799–1877) and Henry (1801–1872; later Baron Dalling and Bulwer).

His father died and his mother moved to London when he was four years old. When he was 15, a tutor named Wallington, who tutored him at Ealing, encouraged him to publish an immature work: &quot;Ishmael and Other Poems&quot;. Around this time, Bulwer fell in love, but the woman&#x27;s father induced her to marry another man. She died about the time that Bulwer went to Cambridge and he stated that her loss affected all his subsequent life.

In 1822 Bulwer-Lytton entered Trinity College, Cambridge, where he met John Auldjo, but soon moved to Trinity Hall. In 1825 he won the Chancellor&#x27;s Gold Medal for English verse. In the following year he took his BA degree and printed for private circulation a small volume of poems, &quot;Weeds and Wild Flowers&quot;. He purchased an army commission in 1826, but sold it in 1829 without serving.
In August 1827, he married Rosina Doyle Wheeler (1802–1882), a noted Irish beauty, but against the wishes of his mother, who withdrew his allowance, forcing him to work for a living. They had two children, Emily Elizabeth Bulwer-Lytton (1828–1848), and (Edward) Robert Lytton Bulwer-Lytton, 1st Earl of Lytton (1831–1891) who became Governor-General and Viceroy of British India (1876–1880). His writing and political work strained their marriage and his infidelity embittered Rosina.

In 1833, they separated acrimoniously and in 1836 the separation became legal. Three years later, Rosina published &quot;Cheveley, or the Man of Honour&quot; (1839), satirising her husband&#x27;s hypocrisy.

In June 1858, when her husband was standing as parliamentary candidate for Hertfordshire, she denounced him at the hustings. He retaliated by threatening her publishers, withholding her allowance and denying her access to their children. Finally he had her committed to a mental asylum, but she was released a few weeks later after a public outcry. This she chronicled in a memoir, &quot;A Blighted Life&quot; (1880). She continued attacking her husband&#x27;s character for several years.

The death of Bulwer&#x27;s mother in 1843 meant his &quot;exhaustion of toil and study had been completed by great anxiety and grief,&quot; and by &quot;about the January of 1844, I was thoroughly shattered.&quot;

In his mother&#x27;s room at Knebworth House, which he inherited, he &quot;had inscribed above the mantelpiece a request that future generations preserve the room as his beloved mother had used it.&quot; It remains hardly changed to this day.

On 20 February 1844, in accordance with his mother&#x27;s will, he changed his surname from Bulwer to Bulwer-Lytton and assumed the arms of Lytton by royal licence. His widowed mother had done the same in 1811. His brothers remained plain &quot;Bulwer&quot;.

By chance, Bulwer-Lytton encountered a copy of &quot;Captain Claridge&#x27;s work on the &quot;Water Cure&quot;, as practised by Priessnitz, at Graefenberg&quot; and, &quot;making allowances for certain exaggerations therein&quot;, pondered the option of travelling to Graefenberg, but preferred to find something closer to home, with access to his own doctors in case of failure: &quot;I who scarcely lived through a day without leech or potion!&quot;. After reading a pamphlet by Doctor James Wilson, who operated a hydropathic establishment with James Manby Gully at Malvern, he stayed there for &quot;some nine or ten weeks&quot;, after which he &quot;continued the system some seven weeks longer under Doctor Weiss, at Petersham&quot;, then again at &quot;Doctor Schmidt&#x27;s magnificent hydropathic establishment at Boppart&quot; (at the former Marienberg Convent at Boppard), after developing a cold and fever upon his return home.

The English Rosicrucian society, founded in 1867 by Robert Wentworth Little, claimed Bulwer-Lytton as their &quot;Grand Patron&quot;, but he wrote to the society complaining that he was &quot;extremely surprised&quot; by their use of the title, as he had &quot;never sanctioned such.&quot; Nevertheless, a number of esoteric groups have continued to claim Bulwer-Lytton as their own, chiefly because some of his writings – such as the 1842 book &quot;Zanoni&quot; – have included Rosicrucian and other esoteric notions. According to the Fulham Football Club, he once resided in the original Craven Cottage, today the site of their stadium.

Bulwer-Lytton had long suffered from a disease of the ear, and for the last two or three years of his life lived in Torquay nursing his health. After an operation to cure deafness, an abscess formed in the ear and burst; he endured intense pain for a week and died at 2 am on 18 January 1873, just short of his 70th birthday. The cause of death was unclear but it was thought the infection had affected his brain and caused a fit. Rosina outlived him by nine years. Against his wishes, Bulwer-Lytton was honoured with a burial in Westminster Abbey. His unfinished history &quot;Athens: Its Rise and Fall&quot; was published posthumously.

==Political career==

Bulwer began his political career as a follower of Jeremy Bentham. In 1831 he was elected member for St Ives, Cornwall, after which he was returned for Lincoln in 1832, and sat in Parliament for that city for nine years. He spoke in favour of the Reform Bill and took the lead in securing the reduction, after he had vainly supported the repeal, of the newspaper stamp duties. His influence was perhaps most keenly felt after the Whig Party&#x27;s dismissal from office in 1834, when he issued a pamphlet entitled &quot;A Letter to a Late Cabinet Minister on the Crisis&quot;. Lord Melbourne, the Prime Minister, offered him a lordship of the Admiralty, which he declined as likely to interfere with his activity as an author.

Bulwer was created a baronet, of Knebworth House in the County of Hertford, in the Baronetage of the United Kingdom, in 1838. In 1841, he left Parliament and spent much of his time in travel. He did not return to politics until 1852, when, having differed from Lord John Russell over the Corn Laws, he stood for Hertfordshire as a Conservative. Bulwer-Lytton held that seat until 1866, when he was raised to the peerage as Baron Lytton of Knebworth in the County of Hertford. In 1858, he entered Lord Derby&#x27;s government as Secretary of State for the Colonies, thus serving alongside his old friend Benjamin Disraeli. He was comparatively inactive in the House of Lords.

&quot;Just prior to his government&#x27;s defeat in 1859 the Secretary of State for the Colonies, Sir Edward Bulwer Lytton, notified Sir George Ferguson Bowen of his appointment as Governor of the new colony to be known as &#x27;Queen&#x27;s Land&#x27;.&quot; The draft letter was ranked #4 in the &#x27;Top 150: Documenting Queensland&#x27; exhibition when it toured to venues around Queensland from February 2009 to April 2010. The exhibition was part of Queensland State Archives&#x27; events and exhibition program which contributed to the state&#x27;s Q150 celebrations, marking the 150th anniversary of the separation of Queensland from New South Wales.

===British Columbia===
When news of the Fraser Canyon Gold Rush reached London, Bulwer-Lytton, as Secretary of State for the Colonies, requested that the War Office recommend a field officer, &quot;a man of good judgement possessing a knowledge of mankind&quot;, to lead a Corps of 150 (later increased to 172) Royal Engineers, who had been selected for their &quot;superior discipline and intelligence&quot;. The War Office chose Richard Clement Moody, and Lord Lytton, who described Moody as his &quot;distinguished friend&quot;, accepted the nomination in view of Moody&#x27;s military record, his success as Governor of the Falkland Islands, and the distinguished record of his father, Colonel Thomas Moody, Knight at the Colonial Office. Moody was charged to establish British order and transform the newly established Colony of British Columbia into the British Empire&#x27;s &quot;bulwark in the farthest west&quot; and &quot;found a second England on the shores of the Pacific&quot;. Lytton desired to send to the colony &quot;representatives of the best of British culture, not just a police force&quot;, sought men who possessed &quot;courtesy, high breeding and urbane knowledge of the world&quot;, and decided to send Moody, whom the Government considered to be the archetypal &quot;English gentleman and British Officer&quot; at the head of the Royal Engineers, Columbia Detachment, to whom he wrote an impassioned letter.

The former HBC Fort Dallas at Camchin, the confluence of the Thompson and the Fraser Rivers, was renamed in his honour by Governor Sir James Douglas in 1858 as Lytton, British Columbia.

==Literary works==
Bulwer-Lytton&#x27;s literary career began in 1820 with the publication of a book of poems and spanned much of the 19th century. He wrote in a variety of genres, including historical fiction, mystery, romance, the occult and science fiction. He financed his extravagant way of life with a varied and prolific literary output, sometimes publishing anonymously. 

Bulwer-Lytton published &quot;Falkland&quot; in 1827, a novel which was only a moderate success. But &quot;Pelham&quot; brought him public acclaim in 1828 and established his reputation as a wit and dandy. Its intricate plot and humorous, intimate portrayal of pre-Victorian dandyism kept gossips busy trying to associate public figures with characters in the book. &quot;Pelham&quot; resembled Benjamin Disraeli&#x27;s first novel &quot;Vivian Grey&quot; (1827). The character of the villainous Richard Crawford in &quot;The Disowned&quot;, also published in 1828, borrowed much from that of banker and forger Henry Fauntleroy, who was hanged in London in 1824 before a crowd of some 100,000.

Bulwer-Lytton admired Disraeli&#x27;s father Isaac D&#x27;Israeli, himself a noted author. They began corresponding in the late 1820s and met for the first time in March 1830, when Isaac D&#x27;Israeli dined at Bulwer-Lytton&#x27;s house. Also present that evening were Charles Pelham Villiers and Alexander Cockburn. The young Villiers had a long parliamentary career, while Cockburn became Lord Chief Justice of England in 1859.

Bulwer-Lytton reached his height of popularity with the publication of &quot;England and the English&quot;, and &quot;Godolphin&quot; (1833). This was followed by &quot;The Pilgrims of the Rhine&quot; (1834), &quot;The Last Days of Pompeii&quot; (1834), &quot;Rienzi, Last of the Roman Tribunes&quot; about Cola di Rienzo (1835), &quot;Ernest Maltravers; or, The Eleusinia&quot; (1837), &quot;Alice; or, The Mysteries&quot; (1838), &quot;Leila; or, The Siege of Granada&quot; (1838), and &quot;Harold, the Last of the Saxons&quot; (1848). &quot;The Last Days of Pompeii&quot; was inspired by Karl Briullov&#x27;s painting &quot;The Last Day of Pompeii&quot;, which Bulwer-Lytton saw in Milan.

His &quot;New Timon&quot; lampooned Tennyson, who responded in kind. Bulwer-Lytton also wrote the horror story &quot;The Haunted and the Haunters; or, The House and the Brain&quot; (1859). Another novel with a supernatural theme was &quot;A Strange Story&quot; (1862), which was an influence on Bram Stoker&#x27;s &quot;Dracula&quot;.

Bulwer-Lytton wrote many other works, including &quot;Vril: The Power of the Coming Race&quot; (1871) which drew heavily on his interest in the occult and contributed to the early growth of the science fiction genre. Its story of a subterranean race waiting to reclaim the surface of the Earth is an early science fiction theme. The book popularised the Hollow Earth theory and may have inspired &quot;Nazi mysticism&quot;. His term &quot;vril&quot; lent its name to Bovril meat extract. The book was also the theme of a fundraising event held at the Royal Albert Hall in 1891, the Vril-Ya Bazaar and Fete. &quot;Vril&quot; has been adopted by theosophists and occultists since the 1870s and became closely associated with the ideas of an esoteric neo-Nazism after 1945.

His play &quot;Money&quot; (1840) was first produced at the Theatre Royal, Haymarket, London, on 8 December 1840. The first American production was at the Old Park Theater in New York on 1 February 1841. Subsequent productions include the Prince of Wales&#x27;s Theatre&#x27;s in 1872 and as the inaugural play at the new California Theatre in San Francisco in 1869.

Among Bulwer-Lytton&#x27;s lesser-known contributions to literature was that he convinced Charles Dickens to revise the ending of &quot;Great Expectations&quot; to make it more palatable to the reading public, as in the original version of the novel, Pip and Estella remain apart.

==Legacy==
Bulwer-Lytton&#x27;s works had an influence in a number of fields.

===Quotations===
Bulwer-Lytton&#x27;s most famous quotation is &quot;The pen is mightier than the sword&quot; from his play &quot;Richelieu&quot;:

beneath the rule of men entirely great, the pen is mightier than the sword

He popularized the phrase &quot;pursuit of the almighty dollar&quot; from his novel &quot;The Coming Race&quot;, and he is credited with &quot;the great unwashed&quot;, using this disparaging term in his 1830 novel &quot;Paul Clifford&quot;:

He is certainly a man who bathes and &quot;lives cleanly&quot;, (two especial charges preferred against him by Messrs. the Great Unwashed). 

===Theosophy===
The writers of theosophy were among those influenced by Bulwer-Lytton&#x27;s work. Annie Besant and especially Helena Blavatsky incorporated his thoughts and ideas, particularly from &quot;The Last Days of Pompeii&quot;, &quot;Vril, the Power of the Coming Race&quot; and &quot;Zanoni&quot; in her own books.

===Contest===

Bulwer-Lytton&#x27;s name lives on in the annual Bulwer-Lytton Fiction Contest, in which contestants think up terrible openings for imaginary novels, inspired by the first line of his 1830 novel &quot;Paul Clifford&quot;:

It was a dark and stormy night; the rain fell in torrents – except at occasional intervals, when it was checked by a violent gust of wind which swept up the streets (for it is in London that our scene lies), rattling along the housetops, and fiercely agitating the scanty flame of the lamps that struggled against the darkness.

Entrants in the contest seek to capture the rapid changes in point of view, the florid language, and the atmosphere of the full sentence. The opening was popularized by the &quot;Peanuts&quot; comic strip, in which Snoopy&#x27;s sessions on the typewriter usually began with &quot;It was a dark and stormy night&quot;. The same words also form the first sentence of Madeleine L&#x27;Engle&#x27;s Newbery Medal–winning novel &quot;A Wrinkle in Time&quot;. Similar wording appears in Edgar Allan Poe&#x27;s 1831 short story &quot;The Bargain Lost&quot;, although not at the very beginning. It reads:

It was a dark and stormy night. The rain fell in cataracts; and drowsy citizens started, from dreams of the deluge, to gaze upon the boisterous sea, which foamed and bellowed for admittance into the proud towers and marble palaces. Who would have thought of passions so fierce in that calm water that slumbers all day long? At a slight alabaster stand, trembling beneath the ponderous tomes which it supported, sat the hero of our story.

===Operas===
Several of Bulwer-Lytton&#x27;s novels were made into operas. One of them, &quot;Rienzi, der Letzte der Tribunen&quot; (1842) by Richard Wagner, eventually became more famous than the novel. &quot;Leonora&quot; (1846) by William Henry Fry, the first European-styled &quot;grand&quot; opera composed in the United States, is based on Bulwer-Lytton&#x27;s play &quot;The Lady of Lyons&quot;, as is Frederic Cowen&#x27;s first opera &quot;Pauline&quot; (1876). Verdi rival Errico Petrella&#x27;s most successful opera, &quot;Jone&quot; (1858), was based on Bulwer-Lytton&#x27;s &quot;The Last Days of Pompeii&quot;, and was performed all over the world until the 1880s, and in Italy until 1910. &quot;Harold, the Last of the Saxons&quot; (1848) provided character names (but little else) for Verdi&#x27;s opera &quot;Aroldo&quot; (1857).

===Theatrical adaptations===
Shortly after their first publication, &quot;The Last Days of Pompeii&quot;, &quot;Rienzi&quot;, and &quot;Ernest Maltravers&quot; all received successful stage performances in New York.
The plays were written by Louisa Medina, one of the most successful playwrights of the 19th century. &quot;The Last Days of Pompeii&quot; had the longest continuous stage run in New York at the time with 29 straight performances.

===Magazines===
In addition to his political and literary work, Bulwer-Lytton became the editor of the &quot;New Monthly&quot; in 1831, but he resigned the following year. In 1841, he started the &quot;Monthly Chronicle&quot;, a semi-scientific magazine. During his career he wrote poetry, prose, and stage plays; his last novel was &quot;Kenelm Chillingly&quot;, which was in course of publication in &quot;Blackwood&#x27;s Magazine&quot; at the time of his death in 1873.

===Translations===
Bulwer-Lytton&#x27;s works of fiction and non-fiction were translated in his day and since then into many languages, including Serbian (by Laza Kostic), German, Russian, Norwegian, Swedish, French, Finnish, and Spanish. In 1879, his &quot;Ernest Maltravers&quot; was the first complete novel from the West to be translated into Japanese.

===Place names===
In Brisbane, Queensland, Australia, the suburb of Lytton, the town of Bulwer on Moreton Island (Moorgumpin) and the neighbourhood (former island) of Bulwer Island are named after him. The township of Lytton, Quebec (today part of Montcerf-Lytton) was named after him as was Lytton, British Columbia, and Lytton, Iowa. Lytton Road in Gisborne, New Zealand, was named after the novelist. Later a state secondary school, Lytton High School, was founded in the road. Also in New Zealand, Bulwer is a small locality in Waihinau Bay in the outer Pelorus Sound, New Zealand. It can be reached by 77 km of winding, mostly unsealed, road from Rai Valley. A weekly mail boat service delivers mail and also offers passenger services. In London, Lytton Road in the suburb of Pinner, where the novelist lived, is named after him.

===Portrayal on television===
Bulwer-Lytton was portrayed by the actor Brett Usher in the 1978 television serial &quot;Disraeli&quot;.

<text>L. L. Zamenhof developed Esperanto in the 1870s and &#x27;80s. &quot;Unua Libro&quot;, the first print discussion of the language, appeared in 1887. The number of Esperanto speakers have increased gradually since then, without much support from governments and international organizations. Its use has, in some instances, been outlawed or otherwise suppressed.

==Standardized Yiddish ==
Around 1880, while in Moscow and approximately simultaneously with working on Esperanto, Zamenhof made an aborted attempt to standardize Yiddish, based on his native Bialystok (Northeastern) dialect, as a unifying language for the Jews of the Russian Empire. He even used a Latin alphabet, with the letters &quot;ć, h́, ś, ź&quot; (the same as in early drafts of Esperanto, later &quot;ĉ, ĥ, ŝ, ĵ&quot;) and &quot;ě&quot; for schwa. However, he concluded there was no future for such a project, and abandoned it, dedicating himself to Esperanto as a unifying language for all humankind. Paul Wexler proposed that Esperanto was not an arbitrary pastiche of major European languages but a Latinate relexification of Yiddish, a native language of its founder. This model is generally unsupported by mainstream linguists.

== Development of the language before publication ==
Zamenhof would later say that he had dreamed of a world language since he was a child. At first he considered a revival of Latin, but after learning it in school he decided it was too complicated to be a common means of international communication. When he learned English, he realised that verb conjugations were unnecessary, and that grammatical systems could be much simpler than he had expected. He still had the problem of memorising a large vocabulary, until he noticed two Russian signs labelled &quot;Швейцарская&quot; (&quot;švejtsarskaja,&quot; a porter&#x27;s lodge – from &quot;швейцар&quot; &quot;švejtsar,&quot; a porter) and &quot;Кондитерская&quot; (&quot;konditerskaja,&quot; a confectioner&#x27;s shop – from &quot;кондитер&quot; &quot;konditer,&quot; a confectioner). He then realised that a judicious use of affixes could greatly decrease the number of root words needed for communication. He chose to take his vocabulary from Romance and Germanic, the languages that were most widely taught in schools around the world and would therefore be recognisable to the largest number of people.

Zamenhof taught an early version of the language to his high-school classmates. Then, for several years, he worked on translations and poetry to refine his creation. In 1895 he wrote, &quot;I worked for six years perfecting and testing the language, even though it had seemed to me in 1878 that it was already completely ready.&quot; When he was ready to publish, the Czarist censors would not allow it. Stymied, he spent his time in translating works such as the Bible and Shakespeare. This enforced delay led to continued improvement. In July 1887 he published his &quot;Unua Libro&quot; (&quot;First Book&quot;), a basic introduction to the language. This was essentially the language spoken today.

== &quot;Unua Libro&quot; to Declaration of Boulogne (1887–1905)==
&quot;Unua Libro&quot; was published in 1887. At first the movement grew most in the Russian empire and eastern Europe, but soon spread to western Europe and beyond: to Argentina in 1889; to Canada in 1901; to Algeria, Chile, Japan, Mexico, and Peru in 1903; to Tunisia in 1904; and to Australia, the United States, Guinea, Indochina, New Zealand, Tonkin, and Uruguay in 1905.

In its first years Esperanto was used mainly in publications by Zamenhof and early adopters like Antoni Grabowski, in extensive correspondence (mostly now lost), in the magazine &quot;La Esperantisto&quot;, published from 1889 to 1895 and only occasionally in personal encounters.

In 1894, under pressure from Wilhelm Trompeter, the publisher of the magazine &quot;La Esperantisto&quot;, and some other leading users, Zamenhof reluctantly put forward a radical reform to be voted on by readers. He proposed the reduction of the alphabet to 22 letters (by eliminating the accented letters and most of their sounds), the change of the plural to &quot;-i&quot;, the use of a positional accusative instead of the ending &quot;-n&quot;, the removal of the distinction between adjectives and adverbs, the reduction of the number of participles from six to two, and the replacement of the table of correlatives with more Latinate words or phrases. These reforms were overwhelmingly rejected, but some were picked up in subsequent reforms (such as Ido) and criticisms of the language. In the following decade Esperanto spread into western Europe, especially France. By 1905 there were already 27 magazines being published (Auld 1988).

A small international conference was held in 1904, leading to the first world congress in August 1905 in Boulogne-sur-Mer, France. There were 688 Esperanto speakers present from 20 nationalities. At this congress, Zamenhof officially resigned his leadership of the Esperanto movement, as he did not want personal prejudice against himself (or anti-Semitism) to hinder the progress of the language. He proposed a declaration on founding principles of the Esperanto movement, which the attendees of the congress endorsed.

== Declaration of Boulogne to present (1905–present)==
The World Esperanto Congress has been held every year since 1905, except during the two world wars and the COVID-19 pandemic.

The autonomous territory of Neutral Moresnet, between Belgium and Germany, had a sizable proportion of Esperanto-speakers among its small and multiethnic population. There was a proposal to make Esperanto its official language. In 1908, it was eventually accepted alongside Dutch, German, and French. There was also a large Esperanto group led by Anna Tuschinski in the Free City of Danzig.

In the early 1920s, a great opportunity seemed to arise for Esperanto when the Iranian delegation to the League of Nations proposed that it be adopted for use in international relations, following a report by Nitobe Inazō, an official delegate of League of Nations during the 13th World Congress of Esperanto in Prague. Ten delegates accepted the proposal with only one voice against, the French delegate, Gabriel Hanotaux, who employed France&#x27;s Council veto privilege to squash all League attempts at the recognition of Esperanto, starting on the first vote on 18 December 1920 and continuing through the next three years. Hanotaux did not like how the French language was losing its position as the international language and saw Esperanto as a threat. However, two years later the League recommended that its member states include Esperanto in their educational curricula. The French retaliated by banning all instruction in Esperanto in French schools and universities. The French Ministry of Instruction said that acceptance of Esperanto would mean that &quot;French and English would perish and that the literary standard of the world would be debased&quot;. Nonetheless, many people see the 1920s as the heyday of the Esperanto movement.

In 1941, the Soviet Union started performing mass arrests, deportations, and killings of many Esperantists and their relatives for fear of an anti-nationalistic movement, but it was interrupted by the Nazi invasion.

Hitler wrote in &quot;Mein Kampf&quot; that Esperanto was created as a universal language to unite the Jewish diaspora.

The creation of a Jew-free National German Esperanto League was not enough to placate the Nazis.
The teaching of Esperanto was not allowed in German prisoner-of-war camps during World War II. Esperantists sometimes were able to get around the ban by convincing guards that they were teaching Italian, the language of Germany&#x27;s closest ally.
In the early years of the Soviet Union, Esperanto was given a measure of government support, and an officially recognized Soviet Esperanto Association came into being. However, in 1937, Stalin reversed this policy and the use of Esperanto was effectively banned until 1956.
While Esperanto itself was not enough cause for execution, its use was extended among Jews or trade unionists and encouraged contacts with foreigners.

Fascist Italy, on the other hand, made some efforts of promoting tourism in Italy through Esperanto leaflets and appreciated the similarities of Italian and Esperanto.

Portugal&#x27;s right-wing governments cracked down on the language from 1936 until they were deposed in the Carnation Revolution of 1974. After the Spanish Civil War, Francoist Spain cracked down on the Anarchists and Catalan nationalists among whom the speaking of Esperanto had been quite widespread; but in the 1950s, the Esperanto movement was tolerated again, with Francisco Franco accepting the honorary patronage of the Madrid World Esperanto Congress.

The Cold War, especially in the 1950s and 1960s, put a damper on the Esperanto movement as well, as there were fears on both sides that Esperanto could be used for enemy propaganda. However, the language experienced something of a renaissance in the 1970s and spread to new parts of the world, such as its veritable explosion in popularity in Iran in 1975. By 1991 there were enough African Esperantists to warrant a pan-African congress. The language continues to spread, although it is not officially recognised by any country, and is part of the state educational curriculum of only a few.

In 2022 an Esperanto club was founded on the Amundsen–Scott South Pole Station making Antarctica the last continent with organized Esperantists.
== Evolution of the language ==
The Declaration of Boulogne (1905) limited changes to Esperanto. That declaration stated, among other things, that the basis of the language should remain the &quot;Fundamento de Esperanto&quot; (&quot;Foundation of Esperanto&quot;, a group of early works by Zamenhof), which is to be binding forever: nobody has the right to make changes to it. The declaration also permits new concepts to be expressed as the speaker sees fit, but it recommends doing so in accordance with the original style.

Many Esperantists believe this declaration stabilising the language is a major reason why the Esperanto speaker community grew beyond the levels attained by other constructed languages and has developed a flourishing culture. Other constructed languages have been hindered from developing a stable speaking community by continual tinkering. Also, many developers of constructed languages have been possessive of their creation and have worked to prevent others from contributing to the language. One such ultimately disastrous case was Schleyer&#x27;s Volapük. In contrast, Zamenhof declared that &quot;Esperanto belongs to the Esperantists&quot;, and moved to the background once the language was published, allowing others to share in the early development of the language.

The grammatical description in the earliest books was somewhat vague, so a consensus on usage (influenced by Zamenhof&#x27;s answers to some questions) developed over time within boundaries set by the initial outline (Auld 1988). Even before the Declaration of Boulogne, the language was remarkably stable; only one set of lexical changes were made in the first year after publication, namely changing &quot;when&quot;, &quot;then&quot;, &quot;never&quot;, &quot;sometimes&quot;, &quot;always&quot; from &quot;kian&quot;, &quot;tian&quot;, &quot;nenian&quot;, &quot;ian&quot;, &quot;ĉian&quot; to &quot;kiam&quot;, &quot;tiam&quot;, &quot;neniam&quot; etc., to avoid confusion with the accusative forms of &quot;kia&quot; &quot;what sort of&quot;, &quot;tia&quot; &quot;that sort of&quot;, etc. Thus Esperanto achieved a stability of structure and grammar similar to that which natural languages enjoy by virtue of their native speakers and established bodies of literature. One could learn Esperanto without having it move from underfoot. Changes could and did occur in the language, but only by acquiring widespread popular support; there was no central authority making arbitrary changes, as happened with Volapük and some other languages.

Modern Esperanto usage may in fact depart from that originally described in the &quot;Fundamento&quot;, though the differences are largely semantic (involving changed meaning of words) rather than grammatical or phonological. The translation given for &quot;I like this one&quot;, in the sample phrases in the main Esperanto article, offers a significant example. According to the &quot;Fundamento&quot;, &quot;Mi ŝatas ĉi tiun&quot; would in fact have meant &quot;I esteem this one&quot;. The traditional usage is &quot;Tiu ĉi plaĉas al mi&quot; (literally, &quot;this one is pleasing to me&quot;), which reflects the phrasing of most European languages (French &quot;celui-ci me plaît&quot;, Spanish &quot;éste me gusta&quot;, Russian &quot;это мне нравится&quot; [eto mnye nravitsya], German &quot;Das gefällt mir&quot;, Italian &quot;mi piace&quot;). However, the original &quot;Ĉi tiu plaĉas al mi&quot; continues to be commonly used.

For later changes to the language, see Modern evolution of Esperanto.

== Dialects, reform projects and derived languages ==
Esperanto has not fragmented into regional dialects through natural language use. This may be because it is the language of daily communication for only a small minority of its speakers. However at least three other factors work against dialects, namely the centripetal force of the Fundamento, the unifying influence of the Plena Vortaro and its successors, which exemplified usage from the works of Zamenhof and leading writers, and the transnational ambitions of the speech community itself. Slang and jargon have developed to some extent, but such features interfere with universal communication – the whole point of Esperanto – and so have generally been avoided.

However, in the early twentieth century numerous reform projects were proposed. Almost all of these Esperantidos were stillborn, but the very first, Ido (&quot;offspring&quot;), had significant success for several years. Ido was proposed by the Delegation for the Adoption of an International Auxiliary Language in Paris in October 1907. Its main reforms were in bringing the alphabet, semantics, and some grammatical features into closer alignment with the Romance languages, as well as removal of adjectival agreement and the accusative case except when necessary. At first, a number of leading Esperantists put their support behind the Ido project, but the movement stagnated and declined, first with the accidental death of one of its main proponents and later as people proposed further changes, and the number of current speakers is estimated at between 250 and 5,000. However, Ido has proven to be a rich source of Esperanto vocabulary.

Some more focused reform projects, affecting only a particular feature of the language, have gained a few adherents. One of these is riism, which modifies the language to incorporate non-sexist language and gender-neutral pronouns. However, most of these projects are specific to individual nationalities (riism from English speakers, for example), and the only changes that have gained acceptance in the Esperanto community have been the minor and gradual bottom-up reforms discussed in the last section.

Esperanto is credited with influencing or inspiring several later competing language projects, such as Occidental (1922) and Novial (1928). These always lagged far behind Esperanto in their popularity. By contrast, Interlingua (1951) has greatly surpassed Ido in terms of popularity. It shows little or no Esperanto influence, however.

== Timeline of Esperanto ==
* 1859: L. L. Zamenhof, the creator of Esperanto, is born in Białystok, Russia (now Poland).

* 1878: Zamenhof celebrates the completion of his universal language project, &quot;Lingwe Uniwersala&quot;, with high school friends.
* 1879: Zamenhof attends medical school in Moscow. His father burns his language project while he&#x27;s away. Meanwhile Schleyer publishes a sketch of Volapük, the first constructed international auxiliary language to acquire a number of speakers. Many Volapük clubs will later switch to Esperanto.
* 1881: Zamenhof returns to Warsaw to continue medical school, and starts to recreate his project.
* 1887: Zamenhof marries. In July, with his wife&#x27;s financial help, he publishes &quot;Unua Libro&quot;, the first publication introducing Esperanto, in Russian. Polish, German, and French translations are published later that year.

* 1889: The second English-language edition of &quot;Unua Libro&quot; is published in January, translated by Richard H. Geoghegan, and becomes the standard English translation. Henry Phillips Jr., of the American Philosophical Society, also translates &quot;Unua Libro&quot; into English. The first volume of &quot;La Esperantisto&quot; is published in September. The language begins to be called &quot;Esperanto&quot;.

<doc id="10402" wikidata="Q598137" url="?curid=10402" title="Esperanto grammar">
<text>Esperanto is the most widely used constructed language intended for international communication; it was designed with highly regular grammatical rules, and is therefore considered easy to learn.

Each part of speech has a characteristic ending: nouns end with &quot;‑o&quot;; adjectives with &quot;‑a&quot;; present‑tense indicative verbs with &quot;‑as&quot;, and so on. An extensive system of prefixes and suffixes may be freely combined with roots to generate vocabulary, so that it is possible to communicate effectively with a vocabulary of 400 to 500 root words. The original vocabulary of Esperanto had around 900 root words, but was quickly expanded.

==Grammatical summary==
Esperanto has an agglutinative morphology, no grammatical gender, and simple verbal and nominal inflections. Verbal suffixes indicate whether a verb is in the infinitive, a participle form (active or passive in three tenses), or one of three moods (indicative, conditional, or volitive; of which the indicative has three tenses), and are derived for several aspects, but do not agree with the grammatical person or number of their subjects. Nouns and adjectives have two cases, nominative/oblique and accusative/allative, and two numbers, singular and plural; the adjectival form of personal pronouns behaves like a genitive case. Adjectives generally agree with nouns in case and number. In addition to indicating direct objects, the accusative/allative case is used with nouns, adjectives and adverbs for showing the destination of a motion, or to replace certain prepositions; the nominative/oblique is used in all other situations. The case system allows for a flexible word order that reflects information flow and other pragmatic concerns, as in Russian, Greek, and Latin.

==Script and pronunciation==
Esperanto uses a 28-letter Latin alphabet that contains the six additional letters &quot;ĉ&quot;, &quot;ĝ&quot;, &quot;ĥ&quot;, &quot;ĵ&quot;, &quot;ŝ&quot; and &quot;ŭ&quot;, but does not use the letters &quot;q&quot;, &quot;w&quot;, &quot;x&quot; or &quot;y&quot;. The extra diacritics are the circumflex and the breve. Occasionally, an acute accent (or an apostrophe) is used to indicate irregular stress in a proper name.

Zamenhof suggested Italian as a model for Esperanto pronunciation.

==The article==
Esperanto has a single definite article, &quot;la&quot;, which is invariable. It is similar to English &quot;the&quot;.

&quot;La&quot; is used:

:For individual objects whose existence has been previously mentioned or implied:
::&quot;Mi trovis botelon kaj deprenis la fermilon.&quot;
:::&quot;I found a bottle and took off the lid.&quot;
:For entire classes or types:
::&quot;La gepardo estas la plej rapida el la bestoj.&quot;
:::&quot;The cheetah is the fastest of the animals.&quot;
::&quot;La abeloj havas harojn, sed ili ne taŭgas por karesi.&quot;
:::&quot;Bees have fur, but they&#x27;re no good for petting.&quot;
:For adjectives used as definite nouns, such as ethnic adjectives used as the names of languages:
::&quot;la blua&quot;
::: &quot;the blue one&quot;
::&quot;la angla&quot;
::: &quot;English&quot; (i.e. &quot;the English language&quot;)
:The adjective may be the adjectival form of a personal pronoun, which functions as a possessive pronoun:
::&quot;La mia bluas, la via ruĝas.&quot;
:::&quot;Mine is blue, yours is red&quot;.

The article may also be used for inalienable possession of body parts and kin terms, where English would use a possessive adjective:
:&quot;Ili tranĉis la manon.&quot; (Or: &quot;Ili tranĉis sian manon.&quot;)
::&quot;They cut their hands.&quot; (one hand each)

The article &quot;la&quot;, like the demonstrative adjective &quot;tiu&quot; (this, that), occurs at the beginning of the noun phrase.

There is no grammatically required indefinite article: &quot;homo&quot; means either &quot;human being&quot; or &quot;a human being&quot;, depending on the context, and similarly the plural &quot;homoj&quot; means &quot;human beings&quot; or &quot;some human beings&quot;. The words &quot;iu&quot; and &quot;unu&quot; (or their plurals &quot;iuj&quot; and &quot;unuj&quot;) may be used somewhat like indefinite articles, but they&#x27;re closer in meaning to &quot;some&quot; and &quot;a certain&quot; than to English &quot;a&quot;. This use of &quot;unu&quot; corresponds to English &quot;a&quot; when the &quot;a&quot; indicates a specific individual.
For example, it is used to introduce new participants (&quot;Unu viro ekvenis al mi kaj diris ...&quot; &#x27;A man came up to me and said ...&#x27;).

==Parts of speech==
The suffixes &quot;‑o&quot;, &quot;‑a&quot;, &quot;‑e&quot;, and &quot;‑i&quot; indicate that a word is a noun, adjective, adverb, and infinitive verb, respectively. Many new words can be derived simply by changing these suffixes. Derivations from the word &quot;vidi&quot; (to see) are &quot;vida&quot; (visual), &quot;vide&quot; (visually), and &quot;vido&quot; (vision).

Each root word has an inherent part of speech: nominal, adjectival, verbal, or adverbial. These must be memorized explicitly and affect the use of the part-of-speech suffixes. With an adjectival or verbal root, the nominal suffix &quot;‑o&quot; indicates an abstraction: &quot;parolo&quot; (an act of speech, one&#x27;s word) from the verbal root &quot;paroli&quot; (to speak); &quot;belo&quot; (beauty) from the adjectival root &quot;bela&quot; (beautiful); whereas with a noun, the nominal suffix simply indicates the noun. Nominal or verbal roots may likewise be modified with the adjectival suffix &quot;‑a&quot;: &quot;reĝa&quot; (royal), from the nominal root &quot;reĝo&quot; (a king); &quot;parola&quot; (spoken). The various verbal endings mean &quot;to be [__]&quot; when added to an adjectival root: &quot;beli&quot; (to be beautiful); and with a nominal root they mean &quot;to act as&quot; the noun, &quot;to use&quot; the noun, etc., depending on the semantics of the root: &quot;reĝi&quot; (to reign). There are relatively few adverbial roots, so most words ending in &quot;-e&quot; are derived: &quot;bele&quot; (beautifully). Often with a nominal or verbal root, the English equivalent is a prepositional phrase: &quot;parole&quot; (by speech, orally); &quot;vide&quot; (by sight, visually); &quot;reĝe&quot; (like a king, royally).

The meanings of part-of-speech affixes depend on the inherent part of speech of the root they are applied to. For example, &quot;brosi&quot; (to brush) is based on a nominal root (and therefore listed in modern dictionaries under the entry &quot;broso),&quot; whereas &quot;kombi&quot; (to comb) is based on a verbal root (and therefore listed under &quot;kombi).&quot; Change the suffix to &quot;-o,&quot; and the similar meanings of &quot;brosi&quot; and &quot;kombi&quot; diverge: &quot;broso&quot; is a brush, the name of an instrument, whereas &quot;kombo&quot; is a combing, the name of an action. That is, changing verbal &quot;kombi&quot; (to comb) to a noun simply creates the name for the action; for the name of the tool, the suffix &quot;-ilo&quot; is used, which derives words for instruments from verbal roots: &quot;kombilo&quot; (a comb). On the other hand, changing the nominal root &quot;broso&quot; (a brush) to a verb gives the action associated with that noun, &quot;brosi&quot; (to brush). For the name of the action, the suffix &quot;-ado&quot; will change a derived verb back to a noun: &quot;brosado&quot; (a brushing). Similarly, an abstraction of a nominal root (changing it to an adjective and then back to a noun) requires the suffix &quot;-eco,&quot; as in &quot;infaneco&quot; (childhood), but an abstraction of an adjectival or verbal root merely requires the nominal &quot;-o: belo&quot; (beauty). Nevertheless, redundantly affixed forms such as &quot;beleco&quot; are acceptable and widely used.

A limited number of basic adverbs do not end with &quot;-e,&quot; but with an undefined part-of-speech ending &quot;-aŭ&quot;. Not all words ending in &quot;-aŭ&quot; are adverbs, and most of the adverbs that end in &quot;-aŭ&quot; have other functions, such as &quot;hodiaŭ&quot; &quot;today&quot; [noun or adverb] or &quot;ankoraŭ&quot; &quot;yet, still&quot; [conjunction or adverb]. About a dozen other adverbs are bare roots, such as &quot;nun&quot; &quot;now&quot;, &quot;tro&quot; &quot;too, too much&quot;, not counting the adverbs among the correlatives. (See special Esperanto adverbs.)

The part-of-speech endings may double up. Apart from the &quot;-aŭ&quot; suffix, where adding a second part-of-speech ending is nearly universal, this happens only occasionally. For example, &quot;vivu!&quot; &quot;viva!&quot; (the volitive of &quot;vivi&quot; &#x27;to live&#x27;) has a nominal form &quot;vivuo&quot; (a cry of &#x27;viva!&#x27;) and a doubly verbal form &quot;vivui&quot; (to cry &#x27;viva!&#x27;).

==Nouns and adjectives==
Nouns end with the suffix &quot;-o&quot;. To make a word plural, the suffix &quot;-j&quot; is added to the &quot;-o&quot;. Without this suffix, a countable noun is understood to be singular. Direct objects take an accusative case suffix &quot;-n,&quot; which goes after any plural suffix; the resulting pluralized accusative sequence &quot;-ojn&quot; rhymes with English &quot;coin.&quot;

Names may be pluralized when there is more than one person of that name being referenced:

:&quot;la fratoj Felikso kaj Leono Zamenhofoj&quot; (the brothers Felix and Leon Zamenhof)

Adjectives agree with nouns. That is, they are generally plural if the noun that they modify is plural, and accusative if the noun is accusative. Compare &quot;bona tago; bonaj tagoj; bonan tagon; bonajn tagojn&quot; (good day/days). (The sequence &quot;-ajn&quot; rhymes with English &quot;fine.&quot;) This requirement allows for the word orders &quot;adjective–noun&quot; and &quot;noun–adjective&quot;, even when two noun phrases are adjacent in subject–object–verb or verb–subject–object clauses:

:&quot;la knabino feliĉan knabon kisis&quot; (the girl kissed a happy boy)
:&quot;la knabino feliĉa knabon kisis&quot; (the happy girl kissed a boy).

Agreement clarifies the syntax in other ways as well. Adjectives take the plural suffix when they modify more than one noun, even when those nouns are singular:
:&quot;ruĝaj domo kaj aŭto&quot; (a red house and [a red] car)
:&quot;ruĝa domo kaj aŭto&quot; (a red house and a car).

A predicative adjective does not take the accusative case suffix even when the noun that it modifies does:
:&quot;mi farbis la pordon ruĝan&quot; (I painted the red door)
:&quot;mi farbis la pordon ruĝa&quot; (I painted the door red).

==Pronouns==
There are three types of pronouns in Esperanto: personal &quot;(vi&quot; &quot;you&quot;), demonstrative &quot;(tio&quot; &quot;that&quot;, &quot;iu&quot; &quot;someone&quot;), and relative/interrogative &quot;(kio&quot; &quot;what&quot;).
According to the fifth rule of the &quot;Fundamento de Esperanto&quot;:
===Personal pronouns===

The Esperanto personal pronoun system is similar to that of English, but with the addition of a reflexive pronoun.
 Zamenhof introduced a singular second-person pronoun &quot;ci&quot;, to be used in translations from languages where the T–V distinction was important, but he discouraged its use. He added it in the &quot;Dua Libro&quot; in 1888 clarifying that &quot;this word is only found in the dictionary; in the language itself it is hardly ever used&quot;, and excluded it from the list of pronouns in the &quot;Fundamento&quot;. To this day, it is standard to use only &quot;vi&quot; regardless of number or formality.

 An unofficial gender-neutral third person singular pronoun &quot;ri&quot; has become relatively popular since about 2010, mostly among younger speakers. It is used when the gender of the referent is unknown or to be ignored. While the speakers that use the pronoun are a minority as of 2020, it is widely understood by active users of Esperanto. Its opponents often object that any new pronoun is an unacceptable change to the basic rules and paradigms formulated in the &quot;Fundamento&quot;. Zamenhof himself proposed using &quot;ĝi&quot; in such situations; the common opposition to referring to people with gender-neutral &quot;ĝi&quot; today is primarily due to the traditional ubiquity of &quot;li&quot; or &quot;ŝi&quot; for people and of &quot;ĝi&quot; for non-human animals and inanimate objects.

 A proposed specifically feminine plural pronoun &quot;&quot; was proposed by Kálmán Kalocsay and Gaston Waringhien to better translate languages with gendered plural pronouns.

Personal pronouns take the accusative suffix &quot;-n&quot; as nouns do: &quot;min&quot; (me), &quot;lin&quot; (him), &quot;ŝin&quot; (her). Possessive adjectives are formed with the adjectival suffix &quot;-a: mia&quot; (my), &quot;ĝia&quot; (its), &quot;nia&quot; (our). These agree with their noun like any other adjective: &quot;ni salutis liajn amikojn&quot; (we greeted his friends). Esperanto does not have separate forms for the possessive pronouns; this sense is generally (though not always) indicated with the definite article: &quot;la mia&quot; (mine).

The reflexive pronoun is used in non-subject phrases only to refer back to the subject, usually only in the third and indefinite persons:
:&quot;li lavis sin&quot; &quot;he washed (himself)&quot;
:&quot;ili lavis sin&quot; &quot;they washed themselves (or each other)&quot;
:&quot;li lavis lin&quot; &quot;he washed &quot;him&quot; (someone else)&quot;
:&quot;li manĝis sian panon&quot; &quot;he ate his (own) bread&quot;
:&quot;li manĝis lian panon&quot; &quot;he ate &quot;his&quot; (someone else&#x27;s) bread&quot;

The indefinite pronoun is used when making general statements, and is often used where English would have a passive verb,
:&quot;oni diras, ke ...&quot; &quot;one says that...&quot;, &quot;they say that ...&quot; or &quot;it is said that ...&quot;
With impersonal verbs, no pronoun is used:
:&quot;pluvas&quot; &quot;it is raining&quot;.
Here the rain is falling by itself, and that idea is conveyed by the verb, so no subject pronoun is needed.

When not referring to humans, &quot;ĝi&quot; is mostly used with items that have physical bodies, with &quot;tiu&quot; or &quot;tio&quot; used otherwise. Zamenhof proposed that &quot;ĝi&quot; could also be used as an (gender-neutral) third-person singular pronoun, meaning for use when the gender of an individual is unknown or for when the speaker simply doesn&#x27;t wish to clarify the gender. However, this proposal is only common when referring to children:
:&quot;La infano ploras, ĉar ĝi volas manĝi&quot; &quot;the child is crying, because it wants to eat&quot;.
When speaking of adults or people in general, in popular usage it is much more common for the demonstrative adjective and pronoun &quot;tiu&quot; (&quot;that thing or person that is already known to the listener&quot;) to be used in such situations. This mirrors languages such as Japanese, but it&#x27;s not a method that can always be used. For example, in the sentence
:&quot;Iu ĵus diris, ke tiu malsatas&quot; &quot;Someone just said that &quot;that thing/person&quot; is hungry&quot;,
the word &quot;tiu&quot; would be understood as referring to someone other than the person speaking (like English pronouns &quot;this&quot; or &quot;that&quot; but also referring to people), and so cannot be used in place of &quot;ĝi&quot;, &quot;li&quot; or &quot;ŝi.&quot; See gender-neutral pronouns in Esperanto for other approaches.

===Other pronouns===
The demonstrative and relative pronouns form part of the correlative system, and are described in that article. The pronouns are the forms ending in &quot;-o&quot; (simple pronouns) and &quot;-u&quot; (adjectival pronouns); these take plural &quot;-j&quot; and accusative &quot;-n&quot; as nouns and adjectives do. The possessive pronouns, however, are the forms ending in &quot;-es&quot;; they are indeclinable for number and case. Compare the nominative phases &quot;lia domo&quot; (his house) and &quot;ties domo&quot; (that one&#x27;s house, those ones&#x27; house) with the plural &quot;liaj domoj (his houses) and &quot;ties domoj (that one&#x27;s houses, those ones&#x27; houses), and with the accusative genitive &quot;lian domon&quot; and &quot;ties domon.&quot;

==Prepositions==
Although Esperanto word order is fairly free, prepositions must come at the beginning of a noun phrase. Whereas in languages such as German, prepositions may require that a noun be in various cases (accusative, dative, &quot;and so on),&quot; in Esperanto all prepositions govern the nominative: &quot;por Johano&quot; (for John). The only exception is when there are two or more prepositions and one is &quot;replaced&quot; by the accusative.

Prepositions should be used with a definite meaning. When no one preposition is clearly correct, the indefinite preposition &quot;je&quot; should be used:
:&quot;ili iros je la tria de majo&quot; (they&#x27;ll go on the third of May: the &quot;on&quot; isn&#x27;t literally true).

Alternatively, the accusative may be used without a preposition:
:&quot;ili iros la trian de majo.&quot;

Note that although &quot;la trian&quot; (the third) is in the accusative, &quot;de majo&quot; (of May) is still a prepositional phrase, and so the noun &quot;majo&quot; remains in the nominative case.

A frequent use of the accusative is in place of &quot;al&quot; (to) to indicate the direction or goal of motion (allative construction). It is especially common when there would otherwise be a double preposition:
:&quot;la kato ĉasis la muson en la domo&quot; (the cat chased the mouse in [inside of] the house)
:&quot;la kato ĉasis la muson en la domon&quot; (the cat chased the mouse into the house).

The accusative/allative may stand in for other prepositions also, especially when they have vague meanings that do not add much to the clause. Adverbs, with or without the case suffix, are frequently used instead of prepositional phrases:
:&quot;li iris al sia hejmo&quot; (he went to his home)
:&quot;li iris hejmen&quot; (he went home)

Both &quot;por&quot; and &quot;pro&quot; can correspond to English &#x27;for&#x27;. However, &quot;por&quot; indicates &quot;for a goal&quot; (the more usual sense of English &#x27;for&#x27;) while &quot;pro&quot; indicates &quot;for a cause&quot; and more often may be translated &#x27;because of&#x27;: To vote &quot;por&quot; your friend means to cast a ballot with their name on it, whereas to vote &quot;pro&quot; your friend would mean to vote because of something that happened to them or something they said or did.

The preposition most distinct from English usage is perhaps &quot;de&quot;, which corresponds to English &quot;of, from, off,&quot; and &quot;(done) by&quot;:
:&quot;libro de Johano&quot; (John&#x27;s book)
:&quot;li venis de la butiko&quot; (he came from the shop)
:&quot;mordita de hundo&quot; (bitten by a dog)

However, English &quot;of&quot; corresponds to several Esperanto prepositions also: &quot;de, el&quot; (out of, made of), and &quot;da&quot; (quantity of, unity of form and contents):
:&quot;tablo el ligno&quot; (a table of wood)
:&quot;glaso da vino&quot; (a glass of wine)
:&quot;listo da kondiĉoj de la kandidatoj&quot; (a list of conditions from the candidates)
The last of these, &quot;&quot;, is semantically Slavic and is difficult for Western Europeans, to the extent that even many Esperanto dictionaries and grammars define it incorrectly.

Because a bare root may indicate a preposition or interjection, removing the grammatical suffix from another part of speech can be used to derive a preposition or interjection. Thus the verbal root &quot;far-&quot; (do, make) has been unofficially used without a part-of-speech suffix as a preposition &quot;by&quot;, marking the agent of a passive participle or an action noun in place of the standard &quot;de&quot;.

==Verbs==
All verbal inflection is regular. There are three tenses of the indicative mood. The other moods are the conditional and volitive (treated as the jussive by some). There is also the infinitive. No aspectual distinctions are required by the grammar, but derivational expressions of Aktionsart are common.

Verbs do not change form according to their subject. &quot;I am, we are,&quot; and &quot;he is&quot; are simply &quot;mi estas, ni estas,&quot; and &quot;li estas,&quot; respectively. Impersonal subjects are not used: &quot;pluvas&quot; (it is raining), &quot;estas muso en la domo&quot; (there is a mouse in the house).

Most verbs are inherently transitive or intransitive. As with the inherent part of speech of a root, this is not apparent from the shape of the verb and must simply be memorized. Transitivity is changed with the affixes &quot;-ig-&quot; (the transitivizer/causative) and &quot;-iĝ-&quot; (the intransitivizer/middle voice) after the root; for example:
:&quot;akvo bolas je cent gradoj&quot; (water boils at 100 degrees)
:&quot;ni boligas la akvon&quot; (we boil the water)
(&quot;Boli&quot; is an intransitive verb; the &quot;-ig-&quot; affix makes it transitive.)
:&quot;mi movis la biciklon al la ĝardeno&quot; (I moved the bicycle to the garden)
:&quot;la biciklo moviĝis tre rapide&quot; (the bicycle moved very fast)
(&quot;Movi&quot; is a transitive verb; the &quot;-iĝ-&quot; affix makes it intransitive.)

===The verbal paradigm===
The tenses have characteristic vowels. Namely, &quot;a&quot; indicates the present tense, &quot;i&quot; the past, and &quot;o&quot; the future. (However, &quot;i&quot; on its own is used for the infinitive.)

The verbal forms may be illustrated with the root &quot;esper-&quot; (hope):
:&quot;esperis&quot; (hoped, was hoping)
:&quot;esperas&quot; (hopes, is hoping)
:&quot;esperos&quot; (shall hope, will hope)
:&quot;esperus&quot; (were to hope, would hope)
:&quot;esperu&quot; (hope, hope! [a command])
:&quot;esperi&quot; (to hope)

A verb can be made emphatic with the particle &quot;ja&quot; (indeed): &quot;mi ja esperas&quot; (I do hope), &quot;mi ja esperis&quot; (I did hope).

===Tense===
As in English, the Esperanto present tense may be used for generic statements such as &quot;birds fly&quot; (&quot;la birdoj flugas&quot;).

The Esperanto future is a true tense, used whenever future time is meant. For example, in English &quot;(I&#x27;ll give it to you) when I see you&quot; the verb &quot;see&quot; is in the present tense despite the time being in the future; in Esperanto, future tense is required: &quot;(Mi donos ĝin al vi) kiam mi vidos vin&quot;.

In indirect speech, Esperanto tense is relative. This differs from English absolute tense, where the tense is past, present, or future of the moment of speaking: In Esperanto, the tense of a subordinate verb is instead anterior or posterior to the time of the main verb. For example, &quot;John said that he would go&quot; is in Esperanto &quot;Johano diris, ke li iros&quot; (lit., &quot;John said that he will go&quot;); this does not mean that he will go at some point in the future from now (as &quot;John said that he will go&quot; means in English), but that at the time he said this, his going was still in the future.

===Mood===
The conditional mood is used for such expressions as &quot;se mi povus, mi irus&quot; (if I could, I would go) and &quot;se mi estus vi, mi irus&quot; (if I were you, I&#x27;d go).

The volitive mood is used to indicate that an action or state is desired, requested, ordered, or aimed for. Although the verb form is formally called volitive, in practice it can be seen as a broader deontic form rather than a pure volitive form, as it is also used to express orders and commands besides wishes and desires. It serves as the imperative and performs some of the functions of a subjunctive:
:&quot;Iru!&quot; (Go!)
:&quot;Mi petis, ke li venu.&quot; (I asked him to come.)
:&quot;Li parolu.&quot; (Let him speak.)
:&quot;Ni iru.&quot; (Let&#x27;s go.)
:&quot;Benu ĉi tiun domaĉon.&quot; (Bless this shack.)
:&quot;Mia filino belu!&quot; (May my daughter be beautiful!)

===Aspect===
Verbal aspect is not grammatically required in Esperanto. However, aspectual distinctions may be expressed via participles (see below), and the Slavic aspectual system survives in two aktionsart affixes, perfective (often inceptive) &quot;ek-&quot; and imperfective &quot;-ad.&quot; Compare,
:&quot;Tio ĉi interesis min&quot; (This interested me)
and,
:&quot;Tio ĉi ekinteresis min&quot; (This caught my interest).
Various prepositions may also be used as aktionsart prefixes, such as &quot;el&quot; (out of), used to indicate that an action is performed to completion or at least to a considerable degree, also as in Slavic languages, as in,
:&quot;Germanan kaj francan lingvojn mi ellernis en infaneco&quot; (I learned French and German in childhood).

===Copula===
The verb &quot;esti&quot; (to be) is both the copula (&quot;X is Y&quot;) and the existential (&quot;there is&quot;) verb. As a copula linking two noun phrases, it causes neither to take the accusative case. Therefore, unlike the situation with other verbs, word order with &quot;esti&quot; can be semantically important: compare &quot;hundoj estas personoj&quot; (dogs are people) and &quot;personoj estas hundoj&quot; (people are dogs).

Existential verbs do not use dummy pronouns. Thus, the phrase &quot;estas pomo&quot; (there is an apple) does not contain a leading pronoun, as does its English translation.

One sometimes sees &quot;esti&quot;-plus-adjective rendered as a verb: &quot;la ĉielo estas blua&quot; as &quot;la ĉielo bluas&quot; (the sky is blue). This is a stylistic rather than grammatical change in the language, as the more economical verbal forms were always found in poetry.

==Participles==
Participles are verbal derivatives. In Esperanto, there are six forms:
* three aspects: 
** past (or &quot;perfective&quot;), present (or &quot;progressive&quot;), and future (or &quot;predictive&quot;)
for each of:
* two voices:
** active (performing an action) and passive (receiving an action)
The participles represent aspect by retaining the vowel of the related verbal tense: i, a, o. In addition to carrying aspect, participles are the principal means of representing voice, with either nt or t following the vowel (see next section).

===Adjectival participles===

The basic principle of the participles may be illustrated with the verb &quot;fali&quot; (to fall). Picture a cartoon character running off a cliff and hanging in the air for a moment. As it hangs in the air, it is &quot;falonta&quot; (about to fall). As it drops, it is &quot;falanta&quot; (falling). After it hits the ground, it is &quot;falinta&quot; (fallen).

Active and passive pairs can be illustrated with the transitive verb &quot;haki&quot; (to chop). Picture a woodsman approaching a tree with an axe, intending to chop it down. He is &quot;hakonta&quot; (about to chop) and the tree is &quot;hakota&quot; (about to be chopped). While swinging the axe, he is &quot;hakanta&quot; (chopping) and the tree &quot;hakata&quot; (being chopped). After the tree has fallen, he is &quot;hakinta&quot; (having chopped) and the tree &quot;hakita&quot; (chopped).

Adjectival participles agree with nouns in number and case, just as other adjectives do:
:&quot;ili ŝparis la arbojn hakotajn&quot; (they spared the trees [that were] to be chopped down).

===Compound tense===
Compound tenses are formed with the adjectival participles plus &quot;esti&quot; (to be) as the auxiliary verb. The participle reflects aspect and voice, while the verb carries tense. For example:
* Present progressive: &quot;mi estas kaptanta&quot; (I am catching), &quot;mi estas kaptata&quot; (I am being caught)
* Present perfect: &quot;mi estas kaptinta&quot; (I have caught), &quot;mi estas kaptita&quot; (I have been caught, I am caught)
* Present prospective: &quot;mi estas kaptonta&quot; (I am going to catch / about to catch), &quot;mi estas kaptota&quot; (I am going to be caught / about to be caught)

These are not used as often as their English equivalents. For &quot;I &quot;am&quot; go&quot;ing&quot; to the store&quot;, you would normally use the simple present &quot;mi iras&quot; (&#x27;I go&#x27;) in Esperanto.

The tense and mood of &quot;esti&quot; can be changed in these compound tenses:
:Past perfect: &quot;mi estis kaptinta&quot; (I had caught)
:Conditional future: &quot;mi estus kaptonta&quot; (I would be about to catch)
:Future present: &quot;mi estos kaptanta&quot; (I will be catching).

==== Synthetic forms ====
Although such periphrastic constructions are familiar to speakers of most European languages, the option of contracting [&quot;esti&quot; + adjective] into a verb is theoretically possible for adjectival participles:

:Present perfect: &quot;mi estas kaptita&quot; is equivalent to &quot;mi kaptitas&quot; (I am caught)
:Past perfect: &quot;mi estis kaptinta&quot; to &quot;mi kaptintis&quot; (I had caught)

In practice, only a few of these forms, notably &quot;-intus&quot; (conditional past progressive) and &quot;-atas&quot; (present passive), have entered the common usage. In general, most are rare for being more difficult to parse than periphrastic constructions.

===Nominal participles===
Participles may be turned into adverbs or nouns by replacing the adjectival suffix &quot;-a&quot; with &quot;-e&quot; or &quot;-o.&quot; This means that, in Esperanto, some nouns may be inflected for tense.

A nominal participle indicates &quot;one who participates&quot; in the action specified by the verbal root. For example, &quot;esperinto&quot; is a &quot;hoper&quot; (past tense), or &quot;one who had been hoping.&quot;

===Adverbial participles===
Adverbial participles are used for circumstantial participial phrases:
:&quot;Kaptinte la pilkon, li ekkuris golon&quot; (Having caught the ball, he ran for the goal).

===Conditional and tenseless participles (unofficial)===
Occasionally, the participle paradigm will be extended to include conditional participles, with the vowel &quot;u (-unt-, -ut-).&quot; If, for example, in our tree-chopping example, the woodsman found that the tree had been spiked and so couldn&#x27;t be cut down after all, he would be &quot;hakunta&quot; and the tree &quot;hakuta&quot; (he, the one &quot;who would chop&quot;, and the tree, the one that &quot;would be chopped&quot;).

This can also be illustrated with the verb &quot;prezidi&quot; (to preside). Just after the recount of the 2000 United States presidential election:
* then-president Bill Clinton was still &quot;prezidanto&quot; (current president) of the United States,
* president-elect George W. Bush was declared &quot;prezidonto&quot; (president-to-be),
* the previous president George H. W. Bush was a &quot;prezidinto&quot; (former president), and
* the contending candidate Al Gore was &quot;prezidunto&quot; (would-be president – that is, if the recount had gone differently).

Tense-neutral words such as &quot;prezidento&quot; and &quot;studento&quot; are formally considered distinct nominal roots, not derivatives of the verbs &quot;prezidi&quot; and &quot;studi&quot;.

==Negation==
A statement is made negative by using &quot;ne&quot; or one of the negative &quot;(neni-)&quot; correlatives. Ordinarily, only one negative word is allowed per clause:

: &quot;Mi ne faris ion ajn.&quot; I didn&#x27;t do anything.

Two negatives (double negative) within a clause cancel each other out, with the result being an affirmative sentence.

: &quot;Mi ne faris nenion. Mi ja faris ion.&quot; It is not the case that I did nothing. I did do something.

The word &quot;ne&quot; comes before the word it negates:
: &quot;Ne mi devas skribi tion&quot; (It&#x27;s not I who has to write this)
: &quot;Mi ne devas skribi tion&quot; (I don&#x27;t have to write this)
: &quot;Mi devas ne skribi tion&quot; (I must not write this)
: &quot;Mi devas skribi ne tion&quot; (It&#x27;s not this that I have to write)

The latter will frequently be reordered as &quot;Ne tion mi devas skribi&quot; depending on the flow of information.

==Questions==
&quot;Wh&quot; questions are asked with one of the interrogative/relative &quot;(ki-&quot;) correlatives. They are commonly placed at the beginning of the sentence, but different word orders are allowed for stress:

:&quot;Li scias, kion vi faris&quot; (He knows what you did.)
:&quot;Kion vi faris?&quot; (What did you do?)
:&quot;Vi faris kion?&quot; (You did &quot;what?)&quot;

Yes/no questions are marked with the conjunction &quot;ĉu&quot; (whether):

:&quot;Mi ne scias, ĉu li venos&quot; (I don&#x27;t know whether he&#x27;ll come)
:&quot;Ĉu li venos?&quot; (Will he come?)

Such questions can be answered &quot;jes&quot; (yes) or &quot;ne&quot; (no) in the European fashion of aligning with the polarity of the answer, or &quot;ĝuste&quot; (correct) or &quot;malĝuste&quot; (incorrect) in the Japanese fashion of aligning with the polarity of the question:

:&quot;Ĉu vi ne iris?&quot; (Did you not go?)
:&quot;— Ne, mi ne iris&quot; (No, I didn&#x27;t go); &quot;— Jes, mi iris&quot; (Yes, I went)
:&quot;— Ĝuste, mi ne iris&quot; (Correct, I didn&#x27;t go); &quot;— Malĝuste, mi iris&quot; (Incorrect, I did go)

(Note that Esperanto questions may have the same word order as statements.)

==Conjunctions==
Basic Esperanto conjunctions are &quot;kaj&quot; (both/and), &quot;aŭ&quot; (either/or), &quot;nek&quot; (neither/nor), &quot;se&quot; (if), &quot;ĉu&quot; (whether/or), &quot;sed&quot; (but), &quot;anstataŭ&quot; (instead of), &quot;kiel&quot; (like, as), &quot;ke&quot; (that). Like prepositions, they &quot;precede&quot; the phrase or clause they modify:

:&quot;Mi vidis kaj lin kaj lian amikon&quot; (I saw both him and his friend)
:&quot;Estis nek hele nek agrable&quot; (it was neither clear [sunny] nor pleasant)
:&quot;ĉu pro kaprico, ĉu pro natura lingvo-evoluo&quot; (whether by whim, or by natural language development)
:&quot;Li volus, ke ni iru&quot; (he would like us to go)

Conjunctions followed by incomplete clauses may be mistaken for prepositions, but unlike prepositions, they may be followed by an accusative noun phrase if the implied full clause requires it, as in the following example from Don Harlow:

:&quot;Li traktis min kiel (li traktus) princon&quot; (He treated me as (he would) a prince)
:&quot;Li traktis min kiel princo (traktus min)&quot; (He treated me as a prince (would))

==Interjections==
Interjections may be derived from bare affixes or roots: &quot;ek!&quot; (get going!), from the perfective prefix; &quot;um&quot; (um, er), from the indefinite/undefined suffix; &quot;fek!&quot; (shit!), from &quot;feki&quot; (to defecate).

==Word formation==

Esperanto derivational morphology uses a large number of lexical and grammatical affixes (prefixes and suffixes). These, along with compounding, decrease the memory load of the language, as they allow for the expansion of a relatively small number of basic roots into a large vocabulary. For example, the Esperanto root &quot;vid-&quot; (see) regularly corresponds to several dozen English words: &quot;see (saw, seen), sight, blind, vision, visual, visible, nonvisual, invisible, unsightly, glance, view, vista, panorama, observant&quot; etc., though there are also separate Esperanto roots for a couple of these concepts.

==Numbers==

===Numerals===
The cardinal numerals are:

:&quot;nul&quot; (zero)
:&quot;unu&quot; (one)
:&quot;du&quot; (two)
:&quot;tri&quot; (three)
:&quot;kvar&quot; (four)
:&quot;kvin&quot; (five)
:&quot;ses&quot; (six)
:&quot;sep&quot; (seven)
:&quot;ok&quot; (eight)
:&quot;naŭ&quot; (nine)
:&quot;dek&quot; (ten)
:&quot;cent&quot; (hundred)
:&quot;mil&quot; (thousand)

Grammatically, these are numerals, not nouns, and as such do not take the accusative case suffix &quot;-n&quot;. However, &quot;unu&quot; (and only &quot;unu&quot;) is sometimes used adjectivally or demonstratively, meaning &quot;a certain&quot;, and in such cases it may take the plural affix &quot;-j,&quot; just as the demonstrative pronoun &quot;tiu&quot; does:
:&quot;unuj homoj&quot; &quot;certain people&quot;;
:&quot;ili kuris unuj post la aliaj&quot; &quot;they ran some after others&quot;.
In such use &quot;unu&quot; is irregular in that it only rarely takes the accusative/prepositional case affix &quot;-n&quot; in the singular, but regularly does so in the plural:
:&quot;ian unu ideon&quot; &quot;some particular idea&quot;,
but
:&quot;unuj objektoj venis en unujn manojn, aliaj en aliajn manojn&quot; &quot;some objects came into certain hands, others into other hands&quot;.
Additionally, when counting off, the final &quot;u&quot; of &quot;unu&quot; may be dropped, as if it were a part-of-speech suffix:
:&quot;Un&#x27;! Du! Tri! Kvar!&quot;

===Higher numbers===
At numbers beyond the thousands, the international roots &quot;miliono&quot; (million) and &quot;miliardo&quot; (milliard) are used. Beyond this there are two systems: A &quot;billion&quot; in most English-speaking countries is different from a &quot;billion&quot; in most other countries (109 &quot;vs.&quot; 1012 respectively; that is, a thousand million &quot;vs.&quot; a million million). The international root &quot;biliono&quot; is likewise ambiguous in Esperanto, and is deprecated for this reason. An unambiguous system based on adding the Esperanto suffix &quot;-iliono&quot; to numerals is generally used instead, sometimes supplemented by a second suffix &quot;-iliardo:&quot;

:106: &quot;miliono&quot;
:109: &quot;miliardo&quot; (or &quot;mil milionoj&quot;)
:1012: &quot;duiliono&quot;
:1015: &quot;duiliardo&quot; (or &quot;mil duilionoj&quot;)
:1018: &quot;triiliono&quot;
:1021: &quot;triiliardo&quot; (or &quot;mil triilionoj&quot;)
:&quot;... etc.&quot;

Note that these forms are grammatically nouns, not numerals, and therefore cannot modify a noun directly: &quot;mil homojn&quot; (a thousand people [accusative]) but &quot;milionon da homoj&quot; (a million people [accusative]).

===Compound numerals and derivatives===
Tens and hundreds are pronounced and written together with their multipliers as one word, while all other parts of a number are pronounced and written separately (&quot;dudek&quot; 20, &quot;dek du&quot; 12, &quot;dudek du&quot; 22, &quot;dek du mil&quot; 12,000). Ordinals are formed with the adjectival suffix &quot;-a,&quot; quantities with the nominal suffix &quot;-o,&quot; multiples with &quot;-obl-,&quot; fractions with &quot;‑on‑&quot;, collectives with &quot;‑op‑&quot;, and repetitions with the root &quot;‑foj‑&quot;.

:&quot;sescent sepdek kvin&quot; (675)
:&quot;tria&quot; (third [as in &quot;first, second, third&quot;])
:&quot;trie&quot; (thirdly)
:&quot;dudeko&quot; (a score [20])
:&quot;duobla&quot; (double)
:&quot;kvarono&quot; (one fourth, a quarter)
:&quot;duope&quot; (by twos)
:&quot;dufoje&quot; (twice)

The particle &quot;po&quot; is used to mark distributive numbers, that is, the idea of distributing a certain number of items to each member of a group:
:&quot;mi donis al ili po tri pomojn&quot; or &quot;pomojn mi donis al ili po tri&quot; (I gave [to] them three apples each).

Note that particle &quot;po&quot; forms a phrase with the numeral &quot;tri&quot; and is not a preposition for the noun phrase &quot;tri pomojn,&quot; so it does not prevent a grammatical object from taking the accusative case.

==Comparisons==
Comparisons are made with the adverbial correlatives &quot;tiel ... kiel&quot; (as ... as), the adverbial roots &quot;pli&quot; (more) and &quot;plej&quot; (most), the antonym prefix &quot;mal-,&quot; and the preposition &quot;ol&quot; (than):

:&quot;mi skribas tiel bone kiel vi&quot; (I write as well as you)
:&quot;tiu estas pli bona ol tiu&quot; (this one is better than that one)
:&quot;tio estas la plej bona&quot; (that&#x27;s the best)
:&quot;la mia estas malpli multekosta ol la via&quot; (mine is less expensive than yours)

Implied comparisons are made with &quot;tre&quot; (very) and &quot;tro&quot; (too [much]).

Phrases like &quot;The more people, the smaller the portions&quot; and &quot;All the better!&quot; are translated using &quot;ju&quot; and &quot;des&quot; in place of &quot;the&quot;:
:&quot;Ju pli da homoj, des malpli grandaj la porcioj&quot; (The more people, the smaller the portions)
:&quot;Des pli bone!&quot; (All the better!)

==Word order==
Esperanto has a fairly flexible word order. However, word order does play a role in Esperanto grammar, even if a much lesser role than it does in English. For example, the negative particle &quot;ne&quot; generally comes before the element being negated; negating the verb has the effect of negating the entire clause (or rather, there is ambiguity between negating the verb alone and negating the clause):
:&quot;mi ne iris&quot; &#x27;I didn&#x27;t go&#x27;
:&quot;mi ne iris, mi revenis&quot; &#x27;I didn&#x27;t go, I came back&#x27;
:&quot;ne mi iris&quot; / &quot;iris ne mi&quot; &#x27;it wasn&#x27;t me who went&#x27;
:&quot;mi iris ne al la butiko sed hejmen&quot; &#x27;I went not to the shop but home&#x27;.
However, when the entire clause is negated, the &quot;ne&quot; may be left till last:
:&quot;mi iris ne&quot; Literally &#x27;I went not&#x27; (i.e., &#x27;I didn&#x27;t go&#x27;)

Phrases typically follow a topic–comment (or theme–rheme) order: Known information, the topic under discussion, is introduced first, and what one has to say about it follows. (I went not: As for my going, there was none.) For example, &quot;ne iris mi&quot;, would suggest that the possibility of not having gone was under discussion, and &quot;mi&quot; is given as an example of one who did not go.

Compare:

:&quot;Pasintjare mi feriis en Italujo&quot;
::&#x27;Last year I vacationed in Italy&#x27; (Italy was the place I went on holiday)
:&quot;En Italujo mi feriis pasintjare&quot;
::&#x27;I vacationed in Italy last year&#x27; (last year was when I went)
:&quot;En Italujo pasintjare mi feriis&quot;
::&#x27;In Italy last year I went on vacation&#x27; (a vacation is why I went)
:&quot;En Italujo pasintjare feriis mi&quot;
::(I am the one who went)

===The noun phrase===
Within a noun phrase, either the order &quot;adjective–noun&quot; or &quot;noun–adjective&quot; may occur, though the former is somewhat more common. 
:&quot;blua ĉielo&quot; &#x27;a blue sky&#x27;
:&quot;ĉielo blua&quot; (same)

Because of adjectival agreement, an adjective may be separated from the rest of the noun phrase without confusion, though this is only found in poetry, and then only occasionally: 
:&quot;Mi estas certa, ke brilan vi havos sukceson&quot; &#x27;I am certain that you will have a brilliant success&#x27;,

Possessive pronouns strongly favor initial position, though the opposite is well known from &quot;Patro nia&quot; &#x27;Our Father&#x27; in the Paternoster.

Less flexibility occurs with demonstratives and the article, with &quot;demonstrative–noun&quot; being the norm, as in English:
:&quot;la ĉielo&quot; &quot;the sky&quot;
:&quot;tiu ĉielo&quot; &#x27;that sky&#x27;
::also &quot;ĉielo tiu&quot;
:&quot;la blua ĉielo&quot; &quot;the blue sky&quot;
:&quot;tiu blua ĉielo&quot; &#x27;that blue sky&#x27;
Noun–demonstrative order is used primarily for emphasis (&quot;plumo tiu&quot; &#x27;that pen&#x27;). &quot;La&quot; occurs at the very beginning of the noun phrase except rarely in poetry.

Even less flexibility occurs with numerals, with &quot;numeral–noun&quot; being almost universal:
:&quot;sep bluaj ĉieloj&quot; &#x27;seven blue heavens&#x27;,
and noun–numeral being practically unheard of outside poetry.

Adjective–noun order is much freer. With simple adjectives, adjective–noun order predominates, especially if the noun is long or complex. However, a long or complex adjective typically comes after the noun, in some cases parallel to structures in English, as in the second example below:
:&quot;homo malgrandanima kaj ege avara&quot; &#x27;a petty and extremely greedy person&#x27;
:&quot;vizaĝo plena de cikatroj&quot; &#x27;a face full of scars&#x27;
:&quot;ideo fantazia sed tamen interesa&quot; &#x27;a fantastic but still interesting idea&#x27;

Adjectives also normally occur after correlative nouns. Again, this is one of the situations where adjectives come after nouns in English:
:&quot;okazis io stranga&quot; &#x27;something strange happened&#x27;
:&quot;ne ĉio brilanta estas diamanto&quot; &#x27;not everything shiny is a diamond&#x27;
Changing the word order here can change the meaning, at least with the correlative &quot;nenio&quot; &#x27;nothing&#x27;:
:&quot;li manĝis nenion etan&quot; &#x27;he ate nothing little&#x27;
:&quot;li manĝis etan nenion&quot; &#x27;he ate a little nothing&#x27;

With multiple words in a phrase, the order is typically demonstrative/pronoun–numeral–(adjective/noun):
:&quot;miaj du grandaj amikoj ~ miaj du amikoj grandaj&quot; &#x27;my two great friends&#x27;.

In prepositional phrases, the preposition is &quot;required&quot; to come at the front of the noun phrase (that is, even before the article &quot;la&quot;), though it is commonly replaced by turning the noun into an adverb:
:&quot;al la ĉielo&quot; &#x27;to the sky&#x27; or &quot;ĉielen&quot; &#x27;skywards&#x27;, never &quot;*ĉielo al&quot;

===Constituent order===
Constituent order &quot;within&quot; a clause is generally free, apart from copular clauses.

The default order is subject–verb–object, though any order may occur, with subject and object distinguished by case, and other constituents distinguished by prepositions:
:&quot;la hundo ĉasis la katon&quot; &#x27;the dog chased/hunted the cat&#x27;
:&quot;la katon ĉasis la hundo&quot;
:&quot;ĉasis la hundo la katon&quot;
:&quot;ĉasis la katon la hundo&quot;
:&quot;la hundo la katon ĉasis&quot;
:&quot;la katon la hundo ĉasis&quot;
The expectation of a topic–comment (theme–rheme) order apply here, so the context will influence word order: in &quot;la katon ĉasis la hundo&quot;, the cat is the topic of the conversation, and the dog is the news; in &quot;la hundo la katon ĉasis&quot;, the dog is the topic of the conversation, and it is the action of chasing that is the news; and in &quot;ĉasis la hundo la katon&quot;, the action of chasing is already the topic of discussion.

Context is required to tell whether
:&quot;la hundo ĉasis la katon en la ĝardeno&quot;
means the dog chased a cat which was in the garden, or there, in the garden, the dog chased the cat. These may be disambiguated with
:&quot;la hundo ĉasis la katon, kiu estis en la ĝardeno&quot;
::&#x27;The dog chased the cat, which was in the garden&#x27;
and
:&quot;en la ĝardeno, la hundo ĉasis la katon&quot;
::&#x27;In the garden, the dog chased the cat&#x27;.

Of course, if it chases the cat in&quot;to&quot; the garden, the case of &#x27;garden&#x27; would change:
:&quot;la hundo ĉasis la katon en la ĝardenon&quot;, &quot;en la ĝardenon la hundo ĉasis la katon&quot;, etc.

Within copulative clauses, however, there are restrictions. Copulas are words such as &quot;esti&quot; &#x27;be&#x27;, &quot;iĝi&quot; &#x27;become&#x27;, &quot;resti&quot; &#x27;remain&#x27;, and &quot;ŝajni&quot; &#x27;seem&#x27;, for which neither noun phrase takes the accusative case. In such cases only two orders are generally found: noun-copula-predicate and, much less commonly, predicate-copula-noun.

Generally, if a characteristic of the noun is being described, the choice between the two orders is not important:
:&quot;sovaĝa estas la vento&quot; &#x27;wild is the wind&#x27;, &quot;la vento estas sovaĝa&quot; &#x27;the wind is wild&#x27;
However, &quot;la vento sovaĝa estas&quot; is unclear, at least in writing, as it could be interpreted as &#x27;the wild wind exists.&#x27;

When two noun phrases are linked by a copula, greater chance exists for ambiguity, at least in writing where prosody is not a cue. A demonstrative may help:
:&quot;bruto estas tiu viro&quot; &#x27;that man is a brute&#x27;.
But in some cases word order is the only clue, in which case the subject comes before the predicate:
:&quot;glavoj iĝu plugiloj&quot; &#x27;let swords become ploughs&#x27;
:&quot;plugiloj iĝu glavoj&quot; &#x27;let ploughs become swords&#x27;.

===Attributive phrases and clauses===
In the sentence above, &quot;la hundo ĉasis la katon, kiu estis en la ĝardeno&quot; &#x27;the dog chased the cat, which was in the garden&#x27;, the relative pronoun &quot;kiu&quot; &#x27;which&#x27; is restricted to a position &quot;after&quot; the noun &#x27;cat&#x27;. In general, relative clauses and attributive prepositional phrases follow the noun they modify.

Attributive prepositional phrases, which are dependent on nouns, include genitives (&quot;la libro de Johano&quot; &#x27;John&#x27;s book&#x27;) as well as &quot;la kato en la ĝardeno&quot; &#x27;the cat in the garden&#x27; in the example above. Their order cannot be reversed: neither &quot;*la de Johano libro&quot; nor &quot;*la en la ĝardeno kato&quot; is possible. This behavior is more restrictive than prepositional phrases which are dependent on verbs, and which can be moved around: both &quot;ĉasis en la ĝardeno&quot; and &quot;en la ĝardeno ĉasis&quot; are acceptable for &#x27;chased in the garden&#x27;.

Relative clauses are similar, in that they are attributive and are subject to the same word-order constraint, except that rather than being linked by a preposition, the two elements are linked by a relative pronoun such as &quot;kiu&quot; &#x27;which&#x27;:
:&quot;fuĝis la kato, kiun ĝi ĉasis&quot; &#x27;the cat which it chased fled&#x27;
:&quot;mi vidis la hundon, kiu ĉasis la katon&quot; &#x27;I saw the dog which chased the cat&#x27;
Note that the noun and its adjacent relative pronoun do not agree in case. Rather, their cases depend on their relationships with their respective verbs. However, they do agree in number:
:&quot;fuĝis la katoj, kiujn ĝi ĉasis&quot; &#x27;the cats which it chased fled&#x27;

Other word orders are possible, as long as the relative pronoun remains adjacent to the noun it depends on:
:&quot;fuĝis la kato, kiun ĉasis ĝi&quot; &#x27;the cat which it chased fled&#x27;
:&quot;vidis mi la hundon, kiu la katon ĉasis&quot; &#x27;I saw the dog which chased the cat&#x27;

===Clause order===
Coordinate clauses allow flexible word order, but tend to be iconic. For example, in
:&quot;la hundo ĉasis la katon kaj la kato fuĝis&quot; &#x27;the dog chased the cat and the cat fled&#x27;,
the inference is that the cat fled after the dog started to chase it, not that the dog chased a cat which was already fleeing. For the latter reading, the clause order would be reversed:
:&quot;la kato fuĝis, kaj la hundo ĉasis ĝin&quot; &#x27;the cat fled, and the dog chased it&#x27;
This distinction is lost in subordinate clauses such as the relative clauses in the previous section:
:&quot;la hundo ĉasis la katon, kiu fuĝis&quot; &#x27;the dog chased the cat(,) which fled&#x27;
In written English, a comma disambiguates the two readings, but both take a comma in Esperanto.

Non-relative subordinate clauses are similarly restricted. They follow the conjunction &quot;ke&quot; &#x27;that&#x27;, as in,
:&quot;Mi estas certa, ke vi havos brilan sukceson&quot; &#x27;I am certain that you will have a brilliant success&#x27;.

==Claimed non-European aspects==
Esperanto&#x27;s vocabulary, syntax, and semantics derive predominantly from Standard Average European languages. Roots are typically Latinate or Germanic in origin. The semantics show a significant Slavic influence. However, those aspects do not derive directly from Esperanto&#x27;s source languages, and are generally extensions of them. It is often claimed that there are elements of the grammar which are not found in these language families.

Frequently mentioned is Esperanto&#x27;s agglutinative morphology based on invariant morphemes, and the subsequent lack of ablaut (internal inflection of its roots), which Zamenhof thought would prove alien to non-European language speakers. Ablaut is an element of all the source languages; an English example is &lt;&quot;song, sing, sang, sung&quot;&gt;&quot;.&quot; However, the majority of words in all European languages inflect without ablaut, as &quot;&lt;cat, cats&quot;&gt; and &quot;&lt;walk, walked&quot;&gt; do in English. (This is the so-called strong–weak dichotomy.) Historically, many European languages have expanded the range of their &#x27;weak&#x27; inflections, and Esperanto has merely taken this development closer to its logical conclusion, with the only remaining ablaut being frozen in a few sets of semantically related roots such as &quot;pli&quot;, &quot;plej&quot;, &quot;plu&quot; (more, most, further), &quot;tre&quot;, &quot;tro&quot; (very, too much), and in the verbal morphemes &quot;‑as&quot;, &quot;‑anta&quot;, &quot;‑ata&quot;; &quot;‑is&quot;, &quot;‑inta&quot;, &quot;‑ita&quot;; &quot;‑os&quot;, &quot;‑onta&quot;, &quot;‑ota&quot;; and &quot;‑us&quot;.

Other features often cited as being alien for a European language, such as the dedicated suffixes for different parts of speech, or the &quot;-o&quot; suffix for nouns combined with &quot;-a&quot; for adjectives and &quot;la&quot; for &#x27;the&#x27;, actually do occur. More pertinent is the accusative plural in &quot;-jn&quot;, which is derived through leveling of the Greek nominal–adjectival paradigm: Esperanto nominative singular &quot;muzo (muse) vs. Greek &quot;mousa, nominative plural &quot;muzoj vs. Greek &quot;mousai,&quot; and accusative singular &quot;muzon vs. Greek &quot;mousan.&quot; (Latin and Lithuanian had very similar setups, with in the plural and a nasal in the accusative.) Esperanto is thus &quot;formally&quot; similar to the non‑Indo‑European languages Hungarian and Turkish—that is, it is similar in its mechanics, but not in use. None of these proposed &quot;non-European&quot; elements of the original Esperanto proposal were actually taken from non-European or non-Indo-European languages, and any similarities with those languages are coincidental.

East Asian languages may have had some influence on the development of Esperanto grammar after its creation. The principally cited candidate is the replacement of predicate adjectives with verbs, such as &quot;la ĉielo bluas&quot; (the sky is blue) for &quot;la ĉielo estas blua&quot; and &quot;mia filino belu!&quot; (may my daughter be beautiful!) for the &quot;mia filino estu bela!&quot; mentioned above. However, this regularization of existing grammatical forms was always found in poetry; if there has been an influence of an East Asian language, it has only been in the spread of such forms, not in their origin. Such usage is not entirely unknown in Europe: Latin has an analogous &quot;folium &quot; for &quot;folium viride est&quot; (the leaf is green) and &quot;avis &quot; for &quot;avis rubra est&quot; (the bird is red).

Perhaps the best candidate for a &quot;non-European&quot; feature is the blurred distinction between root and affix. Esperanto derivational affixes may be used as independent roots and inflect for part of speech like other roots. This occurs only sporadically in other languages of the world. For example, &quot;ismo&quot; has an English equivalent in &quot;an ism&quot;, but English has no adjectival form equivalent to Esperanto &quot;isma.&quot; For most such affixes, natural languages familiar to Europeans must use a separate lexical root.

<text>Esperanto culture refers to the shared cultural experience of the Esperantujo, or Esperanto-speaking community. Despite being a constructed language, Esperanto has a history dating back to the late 19th century, and shared socio-cultural norms have developed among its speakers. Some of these can be traced back to the initial ideas of the language&#x27;s creator, Ludwig Zamenhof, including the theory that a global second language would foster international communication. Others have developed over time, as the language has allowed different national and linguistic cultures to blend together. Some Esperanto speakers have also researched the language&#x27;s ideologies.

Esperanto culture also includes art, literature, and music, as well as international celebrations and cultural exchanges such as the Pasporta Servo.

== Native speakers ==

Native Esperanto speakers are people who have acquired Esperanto as one of their native languages. As of 1996, there were 350 or so attested cases of families with native Esperanto speakers. Estimates from associations indicate that there are currently around 1,000 Esperanto-speaking families, involving perhaps 2,000 children. In all known cases, speakers are natively multilingual, being raised in both Esperanto and either the local national language or the native language of their parents. In all but a handful of cases, it was the father who used Esperanto with the child. In the majority of such families, the parents had the same native language, though in many the parents had different native languages, and only Esperanto in common.

==Writing==

Esperanto was originally a language that one had to learn entirely through books, and even today most people live apart from each other and converse through the internet, so writing and reading are a big part of Esperanto culture. Most people have created or translated some sort of written work whether fiction or nonfiction, published or available to read online for free.

Penpals have been popular since Esperanto&#x27;s earliest days, as Esperanto was originally advertised as a language where you could &quot;send a letter with a message, short list of grammar rules and a dictionary to a complete stranger, and they&#x27;ll be able to look up the words and write a coherent reply back&quot;. Many people did indeed do this in order to recruit more Esperanto speakers.

At the time, in the early 1900s, there was no major world language that could be used &quot;anywhere&quot; and it was difficult to get accurate information about foreign countries. On top of that, things like stamp collecting were popular hobbies for children. In the modern day, most Esperanto speakers talk to each other through the internet.

&quot;Monato&quot; (&quot;month&quot;) is a general news magazine &quot;like a genuinely international &quot;Time&quot; or &quot;Newsweek&quot;&quot;, written by local correspondents.

A magazine for the blind, &quot;Aŭroro&quot;, has been published since 1920 and in general, Esperanto hosts the largest Braille publications in the world — starting in the early 1900s Esperanto was taught in schools of the blind in Europe, and that is where the trend started.

&quot;Esperanto&quot; is the magazine used by the World Esperanto Association to inform its members about everything happening in the Esperanto community.

There are many more magazines created by individual Esperanto clubs from towns in places such as from Japan and China.

==Literature==

Books that are translated to Esperanto are not always internationally famous books, because everyone can already read those in another language that they know. For example, several Japanese crime novels and several Icelandic novels that have never been translated to English (or any other language) have been translated to Esperanto. One reason for this is that people are actually translating their favourite stories instead of famous ones, and another is that it&#x27;s simply cheaper and easier to get the rights to translate a small-time book compared to a famous one.

The first Harry Potter book, for example, was translated and the translator enquired about how to purchase translating rights so the book could be published, but J.K. Rowling refused to allow it to be published in Esperanto (despite &quot;Harry Potter and the Philosopher&#x27;s Stone&quot; being one of the most-translated books in the whole world). In lieu of physical books, the translation now exists as a free download on the internet.

Similarly, famous books translated into Esperanto are often books fallen into public domain such as the Bible, the Quran, or works by Shakespeare, Molière, Balzac, etc., because there are no rights on them.

Esperanto literature and organisations such as the Universal Esperanto Association (&quot;Sennacieca Asocio Tutmonda&quot; or SAT) often advocated against nationalism, leading to several fascist governments attempting to ban and eradicate its usage: Germany, Francoist Spain, Portugal, as well as in the Soviet Union. However, the level to which this discrimination was due to association with Judaism and Jewish people cannot be fully known; Hitler wrote of it as intrinsically Jewish and called it a &quot;Jewish weapon&quot; in his &quot;Mein Kampf&quot;. Following this history of suppression, Esperanto literature frequently concerns themes of resistance and anti-nationalism, though not all criticism of Esperanto is grounded in politics (See Esperanto#Criticism).

There are over 25,000 Esperanto books (originals and translations) as well as over a hundred regularly distributed Esperanto magazines. This is despite that Esperanto has only existed for around 100 years. In comparison, the entire literature of Iceland (a country created in the 900s, and with a population of around 320,000 people) totals fewer than 50,000 books.

==Media==
Esperanto music is usually done in the traditional style of a person&#x27;s country, but &quot;international&quot; music (American pop music, rap music etc.) also exists. Many famous songs are translated to Esperanto as well, for example &quot;La vie en rose&quot; and &quot;En el frente de Gandesa&quot; (the links are to the Esperanto versions of the songs on YouTube).

There are currently radio broadcasts from China Radio International, Melbourne Ethnic Community Radio, Radio Havana Cuba, Radio Audizioni Italiane (Rai), Radio Polonia, Radio F.R.E.I. and Radio Vatican. Many more people have personal podcasts and vlogs.

In 1964, Jacques-Louis Mahé produced the first full-length feature film in Esperanto, entitled &quot;Angoroj&quot;. This was followed in 1965 by the first American Esperanto-production: &quot;Incubus&quot;, starring William Shatner. &quot;Incubus&quot; however is commonly seen as a funny way of introducing a person to Esperanto, as none of the actors even knew how to pronounce Esperanto in the first place, the dialogue being strange and bad due to the scriptwriter not getting a second opinion before the filming was done, and the plot being confusing in general.
Internacia Televido, an internet television channel, began broadcasting in November 2005. Australia is the hotspot of much of the organization behind Esperanto television.
Several short films have been produced, and at times plays have been recorded &quot;for television&quot;. , the Esperanto-language Wikipedia lists 14 films and 3 short films.

In 2011, Academy Award-nominated director Sam Green (&quot;The Weather Underground&quot;), released a new documentary about Esperanto titled &quot;The Universal Language&quot; (La Universala Lingvo), tracing the history of Esperanto. It is known for excellent camera quality and filming sense, as well as being a good &quot;absolute introduction&quot; to what Esperanto is, but is criticized as too short at 30 minutes. 

The American Good Film Festival (La Usona Bona Film-Festivalo) is a short film competition hosted by Esperanto-USA since 2021. The films must be less than five minutes long and entirely in Esperanto with at least ten unique spoken words and a visible required prop which is announced by the host at the beginning of each contest. The festival has produced over 175 short films in Esperanto which can be viewed for free on Esperanto-USA&#x27;s YouTube channel.

Many more films, cartoons and documentaries that aren&#x27;t Esperanto originals are simply subtitled in Esperanto and put up on YouTube. Some fan-dubs exist, especially of Disney songs and short scenes.

==Conventions==
Many people wear their country&#x27;s traditional clothing to Esperanto conventions, whether or not they would ever wear it in their own country. Swedish people, for example, who usually never wear their traditional clothing in their own country, may still wear traditional clothing for any meeting involving Esperanto speakers.

Every year, the World Congress of Esperanto (), which is held in different countries around the world according to year (though it mostly takes place in Europe). Each convention draws in an average of 1500–3000 attendees, and the best-attended conferences are those held in Central or Eastern Europe (generally meaning Poland, Hungary etc.), as Esperanto is an option for fulfilling mandatory foreign-language requirements in Hungarian schools, and the creator of Esperanto came from Poland (see statistics at World Congress of Esperanto).

==Gufujo==

Esperanto speakers create a makeshift café (whether in a rented space or someone&#x27;s home), using Esperanto coins or voucher-like items as well as real money to pay for food and drink. Live music, poetry reading, or literature reading are usual activities. This custom arose in 1995 in order to contrast with the more usual custom of after-convention partying at a bar.

==Pasporta Servo==

An organisation called Pasporta Servo offers a free couchsurfing and homestay service, enabling cheaper and easier travel through a shared language.

==Food==
As Esperanto speakers are from all over the world, and families whose children speak Esperanto natively usually have parents from two vastly different countries, recipes incorporating elements from different countries are naturally born. Traditional foods are also enjoyed in settings where a native wouldn&#x27;t normally mix or eat them.

One cookbook is &quot;Internacie kuiri&quot; “Cooking Internationally” by Maria Becker-Meisberger, published by FEL (Flemish Esperanto League), Antwerp 1989, . Another is &quot;Manĝoj el sanigaj plantoj&quot; “Meals from Healthy Vegetable Dishes” by Zlata Nanić, published by BIO-ZRNO, Zagreb 2002, .

Some Esperanto periodicals, such as &quot;MONATO&quot;, include recipes from time to time.

==Zamenhof Day==
On December 15 (L. L. Zamenhof&#x27;s birthday), Esperanto speakers around the world celebrate Zamenhof Day, sometimes called Book Day. It&#x27;s a common goal to have a book written in Esperanto published on or by that day, as Zamenhof was a strong advocate of the idea that in order to spread Esperanto around the world, its speakers need to create a large body of literature.

The poem &quot;La Espero&quot; is the Esperanto anthem, and most Esperanto speakers know the lyrics of the anthem by heart. It is often sung at conventions. Whether or not one enjoys the lyrics, the song is something that ties all Esperanto speakers together — as it has been around since Esperanto&#x27;s early days. The tune of &quot;La Espero&quot; is known to most Esperanto speakers, and is a general tradition. The very short poem Ho, mia kor&#x27; (Zamenhof, 1887) and the longer (Zamenhof, 1896) are also very famous and often quoted in whole or in part; some distychs of &quot;La vojo&quot;, in particular, have become proverbial (e.g. &quot;Eĉ guto malgranda, konstante frapante, traboros la monton granitan&quot; “Even a small drop, by constantly hitting, will pierce the mountain of granite” as a metaphor for unyielding perseverance).

==Religion==
Esperanto has had an influence on certain religious traditions (Oomoto, Baháʼí Faith, etc., see Esperanto and religion). While some Esperantists subscribe to these beliefs, they are not necessarily common, and are neither required nor encouraged by any Esperanto groups.

<doc id="10406" wikidata="Q9415" url="?curid=10406" title="Emotion">
<text>Emotions are physical and mental states brought on by neurophysiological changes, variously associated with thoughts, feelings, behavioral responses, and a degree of pleasure or displeasure. There is no scientific consensus on a definition. Emotions are often intertwined with mood, temperament, personality, disposition, or creativity.

Research on emotion has increased over the past two decades, with many fields contributing, including psychology, medicine, history, sociology of emotions, computer science and philosophy. The numerous attempts to explain the origin, function, and other aspects of emotions have fostered intense research on this topic. Theorizing about the evolutionary origin and possible purpose of emotion dates back to Charles Darwin. Current areas of research include the neuroscience of emotion, using tools like PET and fMRI scans to study the affective picture processes in the brain.

From a mechanistic perspective, emotions can be defined as &quot;a positive or negative experience that is associated with a particular pattern of physiological activity&quot;. Emotions are complex, involving multiple different components, such as subjective experience, cognitive processes, expressive behavior, psychophysiological changes, and instrumental behavior. At one time, academics attempted to identify the emotion with one of the components: William James with a subjective experience, behaviorists with instrumental behavior, psychophysiologists with physiological changes, and so on. More recently, emotion has been said to consist of all the components. The different components of emotion are categorized somewhat differently depending on the academic discipline. In psychology and philosophy, emotion typically includes a subjective, conscious experience characterized primarily by psychophysiological expressions, biological reactions, and mental states. A similar multi-componential description of emotion is found in sociology. For example, Peggy Thoits described emotions as involving physiological components, cultural or emotional labels (anger, surprise, etc.), expressive body actions, and the appraisal of situations and contexts. Cognitive processes, like reasoning and decision-making, are often regarded as separate from emotional processes, making a division between &quot;thinking&quot; and &quot;feeling&quot;. However, not all theories of emotion regard this separation as valid.

Nowadays, most research into emotions in the clinical and well-being context focuses on emotion dynamics in daily life, predominantly the intensity of specific emotions and their variability, instability, inertia, and differentiation, as well as whether and how emotions augment or blunt each other over time and differences in these dynamics between people and along the lifespan.

== Etymology ==
The word &quot;emotion&quot; dates back to 1579, when it was adapted from the French word &quot;émouvoir&quot;, which means &quot;to stir up&quot;. The term emotion was introduced into academic discussion as a catch-all term to passions, sentiments and affections. The word &quot;emotion&quot; was coined in the early 1800s by Thomas Brown and it is around the 1830s that the modern concept of emotion first emerged for the English language. &quot;No one felt emotions before about 1830. Instead they felt other things – &#x27;passions&#x27;, &#x27;accidents of the soul&#x27;, &#x27;moral sentiments&#x27; – and explained them very differently from how we understand emotions today.&quot;

Some cross-cultural studies indicate that the categorization of &quot;emotion&quot; and classification of basic emotions such as &quot;anger&quot; and &quot;sadness&quot; are not universal and that the boundaries and domains of these concepts are categorized differently by all cultures. However, others argue that there are some universal bases of emotions (see Section 6.1). In psychiatry and psychology, an inability to express or perceive emotion is sometimes referred to as alexithymia.

== History ==
Human nature and the accompanying bodily sensations have always been part of the interests of thinkers and philosophers. Far more extensively, this has also been of great interest to both Western and Eastern societies. Emotional states have been associated with the divine and with the enlightenment of the human mind and body. The ever-changing actions of individuals and their mood variations have been of great importance to most of the Western philosophers (including Aristotle, Plato, Descartes, Aquinas, and Hobbes), leading them to propose extensive theories—often competing theories—that sought to explain emotion and the accompanying motivators of human action, as well as its consequences.

In the Age of Enlightenment, Scottish thinker David Hume proposed a revolutionary argument that sought to explain the main motivators of human action and conduct. He proposed that actions are motivated by &quot;fears, desires, and passions&quot;. As he wrote in his book &quot;A Treatise of Human Nature&quot; (1773): &quot;Reason alone can never be a motive to any action of the will… it can never oppose passion in the direction of the will… The reason is, and ought to be, the slave of the passions, and can never pretend to any other office than to serve and obey them&quot;. With these lines, Hume attempted to explain that reason and further action would be subject to the desires and experience of the self. Later thinkers would propose that actions and emotions are deeply interrelated with social, political, historical, and cultural aspects of reality that would also come to be associated with sophisticated neurological and physiological research on the brain and other parts of the physical body.

== Definitions ==
The Lexico definition of emotion is &quot;A strong feeling deriving from one&#x27;s circumstances, mood, or relationships with others&quot;. Emotions are responses to significant internal and external events.

Emotions can be occurrences (e.g., panic) or dispositions (e.g., hostility), and short-lived (e.g., anger) or long-lived (e.g., grief). Psychotherapist Michael C. Graham describes all emotions as existing on a continuum of intensity. Thus fear might range from mild concern to terror or shame might range from simple embarrassment to toxic shame. Emotions have been described as consisting of a coordinated set of responses, which may include verbal, physiological, behavioral, and neural mechanisms.

Emotions have been categorized, with some relationships existing between emotions and some direct opposites existing. Graham differentiates emotions as functional or dysfunctional and argues all functional emotions have benefits.

In some uses of the word, emotions are intense feelings that are directed at someone or something. On the other hand, emotion can be used to refer to states that are mild (as in annoyed or content) and to states that are not directed at anything (as in anxiety and depression). One line of research looks at the meaning of the word emotion in everyday language and finds that this usage is rather different from that in academic discourse.

In practical terms, Joseph LeDoux has defined emotions as the result of a cognitive and conscious process which occurs in response to a body system response to a trigger.

== Components ==
According to Scherer&#x27;s Component Process Model (CPM) of emotion, there are five crucial elements of emotion. From the component process perspective, emotional experience requires that all of these processes become coordinated and synchronized for a short period of time, driven by appraisal processes. Although the inclusion of cognitive appraisal as one of the elements is slightly controversial, since some theorists make the assumption that emotion and cognition are separate but interacting systems, the CPM provides a sequence of events that effectively describes the coordination involved during an emotional episode.
* &quot;Cognitive appraisal&quot;: provides an evaluation of events and objects.
* &quot;Bodily symptoms&quot;: the physiological component of emotional experience.
* &quot;Action tendencies&quot;: a motivational component for the preparation and direction of motor responses.
* &quot;Expression&quot;: facial and vocal expression almost always accompanies an emotional state to communicate reaction and intention of actions.
* &quot;Feelings&quot;: the subjective experience of emotional state once it has occurred.

== Differentiation ==
Emotion can be differentiated from a number of similar constructs within the field of affective neuroscience:
* Emotions: predispositions to a certain type of action in response to a specific stimulus, which produce a cascade of rapid and synchronized physiological and cognitive changes.
* Feeling: not all feelings include emotion, such as the feeling of knowing. In the context of emotion, feelings are best understood as a subjective representation of emotions, private to the individual experiencing them. Emotions are often described as the raw, instinctive responses, while feelings involve our interpretation and awareness of those responses.
* Moods: enduring affective states that are considered less intense than emotions and appear to lack a contextual stimulus.
* Affect: a broader term used to describe the emotional and cognitive experience of an emotion, feeling or mood. It can be understood as a combination of three components: emotion, mood, and affectivity (an individual&#x27;s overall disposition or temperament, which can be characterized as having a generally positive or negative affect).

== Evolutionary approach: Emotions&#x27; purpose and value ==
There is no single, universally accepted evolutionary theory. The most prominent ideas suggest that emotions have evolved to serve various adaptive functions:

# Survival, threat detection, decision-making, and motivation. One view is that emotions facilitate adaptive responses to environmental challenges. Emotions like fear, anger, and disgust are thought to have evolved to help humans and other animals detect and respond to threats and dangers in their environment. For example, fear helps individuals react quickly to potential dangers, anger can motivate self-defense or assertiveness, and disgust can protect against harmful substances. In addition, happiness might reinforce behaviors that lead to positive outcomes. For example, the anticipation of the reward associated with a pleasurable emotion like joy can motivate individuals to engage in behaviors that promote their well-being.
# Memory enhancement: Emotions can enhance memory. Events or experiences that trigger strong emotions are often remembered more vividly, which can be advantageous for learning from past experiences and avoiding potential threats or repeating successful behaviors.
# Social communication. Emotions play a crucial role in social interactions. Expressing emotions through facial expressions, body language, and vocalizations helps convey information to others about one&#x27;s internal state. This, in turn, facilitates cooperation, bonding, and the maintenance of social relationships. For example, a smile communicates happiness and friendliness, while a frown may signal distress or disapproval. Emotions can also ignite conversations about values and ethics. However some emotions, such as some forms of anxiety, are sometimes regarded as part of a mental illness and thus possibly of negative value.

== Classification ==

A distinction can be made between emotional episodes and emotional dispositions. Emotional dispositions are also comparable to character traits, where someone may be said to be generally disposed to experience certain emotions. For example, an irritable person is generally disposed to feel irritation more easily or quickly than others do. Finally, some theorists place emotions within a more general category of &quot;affective states&quot; where affective states can also include emotion-related phenomena such as pleasure and pain, motivational states (for example, hunger or curiosity), moods, dispositions and traits.

=== Basic emotions theory ===
For more than 40 years, Paul Ekman has supported the view that emotions are discrete, measurable, and physiologically distinct. Ekman&#x27;s most influential work revolved around the finding that certain emotions appeared to be universally recognized, even in cultures that were preliterate and could not have learned associations for facial expressions through media. Another classic study found that when participants contorted their facial muscles into distinct facial expressions (for example, disgust), they reported subjective and physiological experiences that matched the distinct facial expressions. Ekman&#x27;s facial-expression research examined six basic emotions: anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness and surprise.

Later in his career, Ekman theorized that other universal emotions may exist beyond these six. In light of this, recent cross-cultural studies led by Daniel Cordaro and Dacher Keltner, both former students of Ekman, extended the list of universal emotions. In addition to the original six, these studies provided evidence for amusement, awe, contentment, desire, embarrassment, pain, relief, and sympathy in both facial and vocal expressions. They also found evidence for boredom, confusion, interest, pride, and shame facial expressions, as well as contempt, relief, and vocal expressions.

Robert Plutchik agreed with Ekman&#x27;s biologically driven perspective but developed the &quot;wheel of emotions&quot;, suggesting eight primary emotions grouped on a positive or negative basis: joy versus sadness; anger versus fear; trust versus disgust; and surprise versus anticipation. Some basic emotions can be modified to form complex emotions. The complex emotions could arise from cultural conditioning or association combined with the basic emotions. Alternatively, similar to the way primary colors combine, &quot;primary emotions&quot; could blend to form the full spectrum of human emotional experience. For example, interpersonal anger and disgust could blend to form contempt. Relationships exist between basic emotions, resulting in positive or negative influences.

Jaak Panksepp carved out seven biologically inherited primary affective systems called SEEKING (expectancy), FEAR (anxiety), RAGE (anger), LUST (sexual excitement), CARE (nurturance), PANIC/GRIEF (sadness), and PLAY (social joy). He proposed what is known as &quot;core-SELF&quot; to be generating these affects.

=== Multi-dimensional analysis theory ===
Psychologists have used methods such as factor analysis to attempt to map emotion-related responses onto a more limited number of dimensions. Such methods attempt to boil emotions down to underlying dimensions that capture the similarities and differences between experiences. Often, the first two dimensions uncovered by factor analysis are valence (how negative or positive the experience feels) and arousal (how energized or enervated the experience feels). These two dimensions can be depicted on a 2D coordinate map. This two-dimensional map has been theorized to capture one important component of emotion called core affect. Core affect is not theorized to be the only component to emotion, but to give the emotion its hedonic and felt energy.

Using statistical methods to analyze emotional states elicited by short videos, Cowen and Keltner identified 27 varieties of emotional experience: admiration, adoration, aesthetic appreciation, amusement, anger, anxiety, awe, awkwardness, boredom, calmness, confusion, craving, disgust, empathic pain, entrancement, excitement, fear, horror, interest, joy, nostalgia, relief, romance, sadness, satisfaction, sexual desire, and surprise.

== Theories ==

=== Pre-modern history ===
In Hinduism, Bharata Muni enunciated the nine rasas (emotions) in the &quot;Nātyasāstra&quot;, an ancient Sanskrit text of dramatic theory and other performance arts, written between 200 BC and 200 AD. The theory of rasas still forms the aesthetic underpinning of all Indian classical dance and theatre, such as Bharatanatyam, kathak, Kuchipudi, Odissi, Manipuri, Kudiyattam, Kathakali and others. Bharata Muni established the following: Śṛṅgāraḥ (शृङ्गारः): Romance / Love / attractiveness, Hāsyam (हास्यं): Laughter / mirth / comedy, Raudram (रौद्रं): Fury / Anger, Kāruṇyam (कारुण्यं): Compassion / mercy, Bībhatsam (बीभत्सं): Disgust / aversion, Bhayānakam (भयानकं): Horror / terror, Veeram (वीरं): Pride / Heroism, Adbhutam (अद्भुतं): Surprise / wonder.

In Buddhism, emotions occur when an object is considered attractive or repulsive. There is a felt tendency impelling people towards attractive objects and propelling them to move away from repulsive or harmful objects; a disposition to possess the object (greed), to destroy it (hatred), to flee from it (fear), to get obsessed or worried over it (anxiety), and so on.

In Stoic theories, normal emotions (like delight and fear) are described as irrational impulses that come from incorrect appraisals of what is &#x27;good&#x27; or &#x27;bad&#x27;. Alternatively, there are &#x27;good emotions&#x27; (like joy and caution) experienced by those that are wise, which come from correct appraisals of what is &#x27;good&#x27; and &#x27;bad&#x27;.

Aristotle believed that emotions were an essential component of virtue. In the Aristotelian view all emotions (called passions) corresponded to appetites or capacities. During the Middle Ages, the Aristotelian view was adopted and further developed by scholasticism and Thomas Aquinas in particular.

In Chinese antiquity, excessive emotion was believed to cause damage to &quot;qi&quot;, which in turn, damages the vital organs. The four humors theory made popular by Hippocrates contributed to the study of emotion in the same way that it did for medicine.

In the early 11th century, Avicenna theorized about the influence of emotions on health and behaviors, suggesting the need to manage emotions.

Early modern views on emotion are developed in the works of philosophers such as René Descartes, Niccolò Machiavelli, Baruch Spinoza, Thomas Hobbes and David Hume. In the 19th century emotions were considered adaptive and were studied more frequently from an empiricist psychiatric perspective.

=== Western theological ===
Christian perspective on emotion presupposes a theistic origin to humanity. God who created humans gave humans the ability to feel emotion and interact emotionally. Biblical content expresses that God is a person who feels and expresses emotion. Though a somatic view would place the locus of emotions in the physical body, Christian theory of emotions would view the body more as a platform for the sensing and expression of emotions. Therefore, emotions themselves arise from the person, or that which is &quot;imago-dei&quot; or Image of God in humans. In Christian thought, emotions have the potential to be controlled through reasoned reflection. That reasoned reflection also mimics God who made mind. The purpose of emotions in human life is therefore summarized in God&#x27;s call to enjoy Him and creation, humans are to enjoy emotions and benefit from them and use them to energize behavior.

=== Evolutionary theories ===

==== 19th century ====
Perspectives on emotions from evolutionary theory were initiated during the mid-late 19th century with Charles Darwin&#x27;s 1872 book &quot;The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals&quot;. Darwin argued that emotions served no evolved purpose for humans, neither in communication, nor in aiding survival. Darwin largely argued that emotions evolved via the inheritance of acquired characters. He pioneered various methods for studying non-verbal expressions, from which he concluded that some expressions had cross-cultural universality. Darwin also detailed homologous expressions of emotions that occur in animals. This led the way for animal research on emotions and the eventual determination of the neural underpinnings of emotion.

==== Contemporary ====
More contemporary views along the evolutionary psychology spectrum posit that both basic emotions and social emotions evolved to motivate (social) behaviors that were adaptive in the ancestral environment. Emotion is an essential part of any human decision-making and planning, and the famous distinction made between reason and emotion is not as clear as it seems. Paul D. MacLean claims that emotion competes with even more instinctive responses, on one hand, and the more abstract reasoning, on the other hand. The increased potential in neuroimaging has also allowed investigation into evolutionarily ancient parts of the brain. Important neurological advances were derived from these perspectives in the 1990s by Joseph E. LeDoux and Antonio Damasio. For example, in an extensive study of a subject with ventromedial frontal lobe damage described in the book Descartes&#x27; Error, Damasio demonstrated how loss of physiological capacity for emotion resulted in the subject&#x27;s lost capacity to make decisions despite having robust faculties for rationally assessing options. Research on physiological emotion has caused modern neuroscience to abandon the model of emotions and rationality as opposing forces. In contrast to the ancient Greek ideal of dispassionate reason, the neuroscience of emotion shows that emotion is necessarily integrated with intellect.

Research on social emotion also focuses on the physical displays of emotion including body language of animals and humans (see affect display). For example, spite seems to work against the individual but it can establish an individual&#x27;s reputation as someone to be feared. Shame and pride can motivate behaviors that help one maintain one&#x27;s standing in a community, and self-esteem is one&#x27;s estimate of one&#x27;s status.

=== Somatic theories ===
Somatic theories of emotion claim that bodily responses, rather than cognitive interpretations, are essential to emotions. The first modern version of such theories came from William James in the 1880s. The theory lost favor in the 20th century, but has regained popularity more recently due largely to theorists such as John T. Cacioppo, Antonio Damasio, Joseph E. LeDoux and Robert Zajonc who are able to appeal to neurological evidence.

==== James–Lange theory ====
In his 1884 article William James argued that feelings and emotions were &quot;secondary&quot; to physiological phenomena. In his theory, James proposed that the perception of what he called an &quot;exciting fact&quot; directly led to a physiological response, known as &quot;emotion&quot;. To account for different types of emotional experiences, James proposed that stimuli trigger activity in the autonomic nervous system, which in turn produces an emotional experience in the brain. The Danish psychologist Carl Lange also proposed a similar theory at around the same time, and therefore this theory became known as the James–Lange theory. As James wrote, &quot;the perception of bodily changes, as they occur, &quot;is&quot; the emotion&quot;. James further claims that &quot;we feel sad because we cry, angry because we strike, afraid because we tremble, and either we cry, strike, or tremble because we are sorry, angry, or fearful, as the case may be&quot;.

An example of this theory in action would be as follows: An emotion-evoking stimulus (snake) triggers a pattern of physiological response (increased heart rate, faster breathing, etc.), which is interpreted as a particular emotion (fear). This theory is supported by experiments in which by manipulating the bodily state induces a desired emotional state. Some people may believe that emotions give rise to emotion-specific actions, for example, &quot;I&#x27;m crying because I&#x27;m sad&quot;, or &quot;I ran away because I was scared&quot;. The issue with the James–Lange theory is that of causation (bodily states causing emotions and being &quot;a priori&quot;), not that of the bodily influences on emotional experience (which can be argued and is still quite prevalent today in biofeedback studies and embodiment theory).

Although mostly abandoned in its original form, Tim Dalgleish argues that most contemporary neuroscientists have embraced the components of the James-Lange theory of emotions.

==== Cannon–Bard theory ====

Walter Bradford Cannon agreed that physiological responses played a crucial role in emotions, but did not believe that physiological responses alone could explain subjective emotional experiences. He argued that physiological responses were too slow and often imperceptible and this could not account for the relatively rapid and intense subjective awareness of emotion. He also believed that the richness, variety, and temporal course of emotional experiences could not stem from physiological reactions, that reflected fairly undifferentiated fight or flight responses. An example of this theory in action is as follows: An emotion-evoking event (snake) triggers simultaneously both a physiological response and a conscious experience of an emotion.

Phillip Bard contributed to the theory with his work on animals. Bard found that sensory, motor, and physiological information all had to pass through the diencephalon (particularly the thalamus), before being subjected to any further processing. Therefore, Cannon also argued that it was not anatomically possible for sensory events to trigger a physiological response prior to triggering conscious awareness and emotional stimuli had to trigger both physiological and experiential aspects of emotion simultaneously.

==== Two-factor theory ====

Stanley Schachter formulated his theory on the earlier work of a Spanish physician, Gregorio Marañón, who injected patients with epinephrine and subsequently asked them how they felt. Marañón found that most of these patients felt something but in the absence of an actual emotion-evoking stimulus, the patients were unable to interpret their physiological arousal as an experienced emotion. Schachter did agree that physiological reactions played a big role in emotions. He suggested that physiological reactions contributed to emotional experience by facilitating a focused cognitive appraisal of a given physiologically arousing event and that this appraisal was what defined the subjective emotional experience. Emotions were thus a result of two-stage process: general physiological arousal, and experience of emotion. For example, the physiological arousal, heart pounding, in a response to an evoking stimulus, the sight of a bear in the kitchen. The brain then quickly scans the area, to explain the pounding, and notices the bear. Consequently, the brain interprets the pounding heart as being the result of fearing the bear. With his student, Jerome Singer, Schachter demonstrated that subjects can have different emotional reactions despite being placed into the same physiological state with an injection of epinephrine. Subjects were observed to express either anger or amusement depending on whether another person in the situation (a confederate) displayed that emotion. Hence, the combination of the appraisal of the situation (cognitive) and the participants&#x27; reception of adrenalin or a placebo together determined the response. This experiment has been criticized in Jesse Prinz&#x27;s (2004) &quot;Gut Reactions&quot;.

=== Cognitive theories ===
With the two-factor theory now incorporating cognition, several theories began to argue that cognitive activity in the form of judgments, evaluations, or thoughts were entirely necessary for an emotion to occur.

Cognitive theories of emotion emphasize that emotions are shaped by how individuals interpret and appraise situations. These theories highlight:

# The role of cognitive appraisals in evaluating the significance of events.
# The subjectivity of emotions and the influence of individual differences.
# The cognitive labeling of emotional experiences.
# The complexity of emotional responses, influenced by cognitive processes, physiological reactions, and situational factors.

These theories acknowledge that emotions are not automatic reactions but result from the interplay of cognitive interpretations, physiological responses, and the social context. A prominent philosophical exponent is Robert C. Solomon (for example, &quot;The Passions, Emotions and the Meaning of Life&quot;, 1993). Solomon claims that emotions are judgments. He has put forward a more nuanced view which responds to what he has called the &#x27;standard objection&#x27; to cognitivism, the idea that a judgment that something is fearsome can occur with or without emotion, so judgment cannot be identified with emotion.

==== Cognitive Appraisal Theory ====
One of the main proponents of this view was Richard Lazarus who argued that emotions must have some cognitive intentionality. The cognitive activity involved in the interpretation of an emotional context may be conscious or unconscious and may or may not take the form of conceptual processing.

Lazarus&#x27; theory is very influential; emotion is a disturbance that occurs in the following order:
# Cognitive appraisal: The individual assesses the event cognitively, which cues the emotion.
# Physiological changes: The cognitive reaction starts biological changes such as increased heart rate or pituitary adrenal response.
# Action: The individual feels the emotion and chooses how to react.

For example: Jenny sees a snake.
# Jenny cognitively assesses the snake in her presence. Cognition allows her to understand it as a danger.
# Her brain activates the adrenal glands which pump adrenalin through her blood stream, resulting in increased heartbeat.
# Jenny screams and runs away.

Lazarus stressed that the quality and intensity of emotions are controlled through cognitive processes. These processes underline coping strategies that form the emotional reaction by altering the relationship between the person and the environment.

==== Two-Process Theory ====
George Mandler provided an extensive theoretical and empirical discussion of emotion as influenced by cognition, consciousness, and the autonomic nervous system in two books (&quot;Mind and Emotion&quot;, 1975, and &quot;Mind and Body: Psychology of Emotion and Stress&quot;, 1984)

George Mandler, a prominent psychologist known for his contributions to the study of cognition and emotion, proposed the &quot;Two-Process Theory of Emotion&quot;. This theory offers insights into how emotions are generated and how cognitive processes play a role in emotional experiences. Mandler&#x27;s theory focuses on the interplay between primary and secondary appraisal processes in the formation of emotions. Here are the key components of his theory:

# Primary Appraisal: This initial cognitive appraisal involves evaluating a situation for its relevance and implications for one&#x27;s well-being. It assesses whether a situation is beneficial, harmful, or neutral. A positive primary appraisal may lead to positive emotions, while a negative primary appraisal may lead to negative emotions.
# Secondary Appraisal: Secondary appraisal follows the primary appraisal and involves an assessment of one&#x27;s ability to cope with or manage the situation. If an individual believes they have the resources and skills to cope effectively, this may result in a different emotional response than if they perceive themselves as unable to cope.
# Emotion Generation: The combination of the primary and secondary appraisals contributes to the generation of emotions. The specific emotion experienced is determined by these appraisals. For instance, if a person appraises a situation as relevant to their well-being (positive or negative) and believes they have the resources to cope, this might lead to an emotion such as joy or relief. Conversely, if the situation is appraised negatively, and coping resources are perceived as lacking, emotions like fear or sadness may result.

Mandler&#x27;s Two-Process Theory of Emotion emphasizes the importance of cognitive appraisal processes in shaping emotional experiences. It recognizes that emotions are not just automatic reactions but result from complex evaluations of the significance of situations and one&#x27;s ability to manage them effectively. This theory underscores the role of cognition in the emotional process and highlights the interplay of cognitive factors in the formation of emotions.

==== The Affect Infusion Model (AIM) ====
The Affect Infusion Model (AIM) is a psychological framework that was developed by Joseph Forgas in the 1990s. This model focuses on how affect, or mood and emotions, can influence cognitive processes and decision-making. The central idea of the AIM is that affect, whether it is a positive or negative mood, can &quot;infuse&quot; or influence various cognitive activities, including information processing and judgments.

Key components and principles of the Affect Infusion Model include:

# Affect as Information: The AIM posits that individuals use their current mood or emotional state as a source of information when making judgments or decisions. In other words, people consider their emotional experiences as part of the decision-making process.
# Information Processing Strategies: The model suggests that affect can influence the strategies people use to process information. Positive affect might lead to a more heuristic or &quot;top-down&quot; processing style, whereas negative affect might lead to a more systematic, detail-oriented &quot;bottom-up&quot; processing style.
# Affect Congruence: The AIM suggests that when the affective state is congruent with the information being processed, it can enhance processing efficiency and lead to more favorable judgments. For example, a positive mood might lead to more positive evaluations of positive information.
# Affect Infusion: The concept of &quot;affect infusion&quot; refers to the idea that affect can &quot;infuse&quot; or bias cognitive processes, potentially leading to decision-making that is influenced by emotional factors.
# Moderating Factors: The model acknowledges that various factors, such as individual differences, task complexity, and the extent of attention paid to one&#x27;s mood, can moderate the degree to which affect influences cognition.

The Affect Infusion Model has been applied to a wide range of areas, including consumer behavior, social judgment, and interpersonal interactions. It emphasizes the idea that emotions and mood play a more significant role in cognitive processes and decision-making than traditionally thought. While it has been influential in understanding the interplay between affect and cognition, it is important to note that the AIM is just one of several models in the field of emotion and cognition that help explain the intricate relationship between emotions and thinking.

==== Appraisal-Tendency Theory ====
Source:

The Appraisal-Tendency Theory, developed by Joseph P. Forgas, is a theory that focuses on how people have dispositional tendencies to appraise and interpret situations in specific ways, leading to consistent emotional reactions to particular types of situations. This theory suggests that certain individuals may have stable, habitual patterns of appraising and attributing emotional significance to events, and these tendencies can influence their emotional responses and judgments.

Key features and concepts of the Appraisal-Tendency Theory include:

# Cognitive Appraisals: Appraisal tendencies refer to the habitual or characteristic ways that individuals appraise or evaluate situations. Appraisals involve cognitive judgments about the personal relevance, desirability, and significance of events or situations.
# Stable and Individual Differences: The theory posits that these appraisal tendencies are stable and relatively consistent across time. They are also seen as individual differences, meaning that people may differ in the specific appraisal tendencies they exhibit.
# Emotional Responses: Appraisal tendencies influence emotional responses to situations. For instance, individuals with a tendency to appraise situations as threatening may consistently experience fear or anxiety in response to a range of situations perceived as threats.
# Influence on Social Judgments: The theory extends beyond emotions to include the impact of appraisal tendencies on social judgments and evaluations. For example, individuals with a tendency to perceive events as unfair may make consistent social judgments related to fairness and justice.
# Context Dependence: Appraisal tendencies may interact with situational factors. In some situations, the tendency to appraise a situation as threatening, for instance, may lead to fear, while in different contexts, it may not produce the same emotional response.

Appraisal-Tendency Theory suggests that these cognitive tendencies can shape an individual&#x27;s overall emotional disposition, influencing their emotional reactions and social judgments. This theory has been applied in various contexts, including studies of personality, social psychology, and decision-making, to better understand how cognitive appraisal tendencies influence emotional and evaluative responses.

==== Laws of Emotion ====
Source:

Nico Frijda was a prominent psychologist known for his work in the field of emotion and affective science. One of the key contributions of Frijda are his &quot;Laws of Emotion&quot;, which outline a set of principles that help explain how emotions function and how they are experienced. Frijda&#x27;s Laws of Emotion are as follows:

# The Law of Situational Meaning: This law posits that emotions are elicited by events or situations that have personal significance and meaning for the individual. Emotions are not random but are a response to the perceived meaning of the situation.
# The Law of Concern: Frijda suggests that emotions are fundamentally concerned with the individual&#x27;s well-being and adaptation. Emotions serve as signals or reactions to situations that impact one&#x27;s goals, needs, or values.
# The Law of Appraisal: This law acknowledges the role of cognitive appraisal processes in the emotional experience. Individuals appraise or evaluate a situation based on factors such as its relevance, congruence with goals, and coping potential, which in turn shapes the specific emotional response.
# The Law of Readiness: Frijda&#x27;s theory suggests that emotions prepare individuals for action. Emotions are associated with physiological changes and action tendencies that ready the individual to respond to the situation. For example, fear may prepare someone to escape a threat.
# The Law of Concerned Expectancy: Emotions are influenced by both what is happening now and what is anticipated to occur in the future. Emotions can reflect an individual&#x27;s expectations about the consequences of a situation.

Frijda&#x27;s theory emphasizes the adaptive function of emotions and the role of cognitive appraisal in shaping emotional experiences. It highlights that emotions are not simply reactions to external events but are intimately tied to the individual&#x27;s goals, values, and perceptions of the situation&#x27;s meaning. Frijda&#x27;s work has had a significant influence on the study of emotions and has contributed to a more comprehensive understanding of how emotions operate.

=== Emotion Attribution Theory ===
Source:

Jesse Prinz is a contemporary philosopher and cognitive scientist who has contributed to the field of emotion theory. One of his influential theories is the &quot;Emotion Attribution Theory&quot;, which provides a perspective on how people recognize and understand emotions in themselves and others.

Emotion Attribution Theory, proposed by Jesse Prinz, focuses on the role of emotion attributions in the experience and understanding of emotions. Key ideas and components of Prinz&#x27;s theory include:

# Emotion Attribution: Prinz suggests that emotions are recognized through a process of attributing specific emotional states to oneself and others based on observed or perceived cues. These cues can include facial expressions, body language, vocal tone, and context.
# Basic Emotions: Prinz&#x27;s theory is associated with the idea of basic emotions, which are a limited set of universal and biologically driven emotional states. He argues that attributions of basic emotions are part of human cognitive architecture and that these attributions are made automatically and rapidly.
# Social and Cultural Influence: While basic emotions are seen as universal, Prinz acknowledges the role of social and cultural factors in shaping how emotions are expressed and interpreted. Culture can influence the display rules for emotions and how emotions are perceived in various contexts.
# Emotion and Moral Evaluation: Prinz&#x27;s theory also explores the connection between emotions and moral evaluation. He suggests that emotions are linked to our moral judgments and evaluations of actions and events. Emotion attributions are crucial in the moral assessment of others&#x27; behaviors.

Overall, Prinz&#x27;s Emotion Attribution Theory emphasizes the role of attributions in the recognition and understanding of emotions. It highlights the automatic and cognitive processes involved in identifying and interpreting emotional states in oneself and others. This theory has implications for fields such as psychology, philosophy, and cognitive science and contributes to our understanding of the social and cultural aspects of emotions.

=== Affective Events Theory (AET) ===
Source:

The Affective Events Theory (AET) is a psychological theory that focuses on the role of workplace events in shaping employees&#x27; emotions, attitudes, and behaviors in the context of their job. This theory was developed by organizational psychologists Howard M. Weiss and Russell Cropanzano in the late 1990s. AET primarily concerns itself with how emotional experiences at work can impact job satisfaction, performance, and other outcomes.

Key concepts and principles of the Affective Events Theory include:

# Affective Events: AET centers on &quot;affective events&quot;, which are specific events or occurrences in the workplace that trigger emotional responses in employees. These events can be positive (e.g., receiving praise or a promotion) or negative (e.g., conflicts with coworkers or work-related stressors).
# Emotion Generation: The theory suggests that these affective events generate emotions in employees. These emotions can be either discrete (specific emotions like happiness, anger, or sadness) or general mood states (e.g., feeling generally positive or negative).
# Emotion-Driven Outcomes: AET posits that emotions generated by affective events at work have consequences for employee attitudes and behaviors. For example, positive emotions may lead to increased job satisfaction, improved performance, and greater commitment to the organization, while negative emotions might result in reduced job satisfaction and increased turnover intentions.
# Moderating Factors: AET recognizes that individual and situational factors can moderate the relationship between affective events and outcomes. Personal characteristics, job roles, and organizational culture can influence how employees respond to affective events.
# Feedback Loop: The theory also suggests that there can be a feedback loop where the emotional reactions of employees influence their perceptions of subsequent events. In other words, an employee&#x27;s emotional state may color their perception of future events and experiences in the workplace.
# Time Lag: AET acknowledges that the effects of affective events may not be immediate and can manifest over time. The theory allows for the consideration of both short-term and long-term emotional influences on employees.

AET has been influential in the field of organizational psychology and has helped shed light on how workplace events can have a significant impact on employee well-being and organizational outcomes. It highlights the importance of understanding and managing the emotional experiences of employees in the context of their work.

=== Situated perspective on emotion ===
A situated perspective on emotion, developed by Paul E. Griffiths and Andrea Scarantino, emphasizes the importance of external factors in the development and communication of emotion, drawing upon the situationism approach in psychology. This theory is markedly different from both cognitivist and neo-Jamesian theories of emotion, both of which see emotion as a purely internal process, with the environment only acting as a stimulus to the emotion. In contrast, a situationist perspective on emotion views emotion as the product of an organism investigating its environment, and observing the responses of other organisms. Emotion stimulates the evolution of social relationships, acting as a signal to mediate the behavior of other organisms. In some contexts, the expression of emotion (both voluntary and involuntary) could be seen as strategic moves in the transactions between different organisms. The situated perspective on emotion states that conceptual thought is not an inherent part of emotion, since emotion is an action-oriented form of skillful engagement with the world. Griffiths and Scarantino suggested that this perspective on emotion could be helpful in understanding phobias, as well as the emotions of infants and animals.

=== Genetics ===
Emotions can motivate social interactions and relationships and therefore are directly related with basic physiology, particularly with the stress systems. This is important because emotions are related to the anti-stress complex, with an oxytocin-attachment system, which plays a major role in bonding. Emotional phenotype temperaments affect social connectedness and fitness in complex social systems. These characteristics are shared with other species and taxa and are due to the effects of genes and their continuous transmission. Information that is encoded in the DNA sequences provides the blueprint for assembling proteins that make up our cells. Zygotes require genetic information from their parental germ cells, and at every speciation event, heritable traits that have enabled its ancestor to survive and reproduce successfully are passed down along with new traits that could be potentially beneficial to the offspring.

In the five million years since the lineages leading to modern humans and chimpanzees split, only about 1.2% of their genetic material has been modified. This suggests that everything that separates us from chimpanzees must be encoded in that very small amount of DNA, including our behaviors. Students that study animal behaviors have only identified intraspecific examples of gene-dependent behavioral phenotypes. In voles (Microtus spp.) minor genetic differences have been identified in a vasopressin receptor gene that corresponds to major species differences in social organization and the mating system. Another potential example with behavioral differences is the FOXP2 gene, which is involved in neural circuitry handling speech and language. Its present form in humans differed from that of the chimpanzees by only a few mutations and has been present for about 200,000 years, coinciding with the beginning of modern humans. Speech, language, and social organization are all part of the basis for emotions.

== Formation ==
=== Neurobiological explanation ===
Based on discoveries made through neural mapping of the limbic system, the neurobiological explanation of human emotion is that emotion is a pleasant or unpleasant mental state organized in the limbic system of the mammalian brain. If distinguished from reactive responses of reptiles, emotions would then be mammalian elaborations of general vertebrate arousal patterns, in which neurochemicals (for example, dopamine, noradrenaline, and serotonin) step-up or step-down the brain&#x27;s activity level, as visible in body movements, gestures and postures. Emotions can likely be mediated by pheromones (see fear).

For example, the emotion of love is proposed to be the expression of paleocircuits of the mammalian brain (specifically, modules of the cingulate cortex (or gyrus)) which facilitate the care, feeding, and grooming of offspring. Paleocircuits are neural platforms for bodily expression configured before the advent of cortical circuits for speech. They consist of pre-configured pathways or networks of nerve cells in the forebrain, brainstem and spinal cord.

Other emotions like fear and anxiety long thought to be exclusively generated by the most primitive parts of the brain (stem) and more associated to the fight-or-flight responses of behavior, have also been associated as adaptive expressions of defensive behavior whenever a threat is encountered. Although defensive behaviors have been present in a wide variety of species, Blanchard et al. (2001) discovered a correlation of given stimuli and situation that resulted in a similar pattern of defensive behavior towards a threat in human and non-human mammals.

Whenever potentially dangerous stimuli are presented, additional brain structures activate that previous thought (hippocampus, thalamus, etc.). Thus, giving the amygdala an important role in coordinating the following behavioral input based on the presented neurotransmitters that respond to threat stimuli. These biological functions of the amygdala are not only limited to the &quot;fear-conditioning&quot; and &quot;processing of aversive stimuli&quot;, but also are present on other components of the amygdala. Therefore, it can referred the amygdala as a key structure to understand the potential responses of behavior in danger like situations in human and non-human mammals.

The motor centers of reptiles react to sensory cues of vision, sound, touch, chemical, gravity, and motion with pre-set body movements and programmed postures. With the arrival of night-active mammals, smell replaced vision as the dominant sense, and a different way of responding arose from the olfactory sense, which is proposed to have developed into mammalian emotion and emotional memory. The mammalian brain invested heavily in olfaction to succeed at night as reptiles slept – one explanation for why olfactory lobes in mammalian brains are proportionally larger than in the reptiles. These odor pathways gradually formed the neural blueprint for what was later to become our limbic brain.

Emotions are thought to be related to certain activities in brain areas that direct our attention, motivate our behavior, and determine the significance of what is going on around us. Pioneering work by Paul Broca (1878), James Papez (1937), and Paul D. MacLean (1952) suggested that emotion is related to a group of structures in the center of the brain called the limbic system, which includes the hypothalamus, cingulate cortex, hippocampi, and other structures. More recent research has shown that some of these limbic structures are not as directly related to emotion as others are while some non-limbic structures have been found to be of greater emotional relevance.

==== Prefrontal cortex ====
There is ample evidence that the left prefrontal cortex is activated by stimuli that cause positive approach. If attractive stimuli can selectively activate a region of the brain, then logically the converse should hold, that selective activation of that region of the brain should cause a stimulus to be judged more positively. This was demonstrated for moderately attractive visual stimuli and replicated and extended to include negative stimuli.

Two neurobiological models of emotion in the prefrontal cortex made opposing predictions. The valence model predicted that anger, a negative emotion, would activate the right prefrontal cortex. The direction model predicted that anger, an approach emotion, would activate the left prefrontal cortex. The second model was supported.

This still left open the question of whether the opposite of approach in the prefrontal cortex is better described as moving away (direction model), as unmoving but with strength and resistance (movement model), or as unmoving with passive yielding (action tendency model). Support for the action tendency model (passivity related to right prefrontal activity) comes from research on shyness and research on behavioral inhibition. Research that tested the competing hypotheses generated by all four models also supported the action tendency model.

==== Homeostatic/primordial emotion ====
Another neurological approach proposed by Bud Craig in 2003 distinguishes two classes of emotion: &quot;classical&quot; emotions such as love, anger and fear that are evoked by environmental stimuli, and &quot;homeostatic emotions&quot;attention-demanding feelings evoked by body states, such as pain, hunger and fatigue, that motivate behavior (withdrawal, eating or resting in these examples) aimed at maintaining the body&#x27;s internal milieu at its ideal state.

Derek Denton calls the latter &quot;primordial emotions&quot; and defines them as &quot;the subjective element of the instincts, which are the genetically programmed behavior patterns which contrive homeostasis. They include thirst, hunger for air, hunger for food, pain and hunger for specific minerals etc. There are two constituents of a primordial emotion – the specific sensation which when severe may be imperious, and the compelling intention for gratification by a consummatory act&quot;.

=== Emergent explanation ===
Emotions are seen by some researchers to be constructed (emerge) in social and cognitive domain alone, without directly implying biologically inherited characteristics.

Joseph LeDoux differentiates between the human&#x27;s defense system, which has evolved over time, and emotions such as fear and anxiety. He has said that the amygdala may release hormones due to a trigger (such as an innate reaction to seeing a snake), but &quot;then we elaborate it through cognitive and conscious processes&quot;.

Lisa Feldman Barrett highlights differences in emotions between different cultures, and says that emotions (such as anxiety) are socially constructed (see theory of constructed emotion). She says that they &quot;are not triggered; you create them. They emerge as a combination of the physical properties of your body, a flexible brain that wires itself to whatever environment it develops in, and your culture and upbringing, which provide that environment&quot;. She has termed this approach the theory of constructed emotion.

== Disciplinary approaches ==
Many different disciplines have produced work on the emotions. Human sciences study the role of emotions in mental processes, disorders, and neural mechanisms. In psychiatry, emotions are examined as part of the discipline&#x27;s study and treatment of mental disorders in humans. Nursing studies emotions as part of its approach to the provision of holistic health care to humans. Psychology examines emotions from a scientific perspective by treating them as mental processes and behavior and they explore the underlying physiological and neurological processes, e.g., cognitive behavioral therapy. In neuroscience sub-fields such as social neuroscience and affective neuroscience, scientists study the neural mechanisms of emotion by combining neuroscience with the psychological study of personality, emotion, and mood. In linguistics, the expression of emotion may change to the meaning of sounds. In education, the role of emotions in relation to learning is examined.

Social sciences often examine emotion for the role that it plays in human culture and social interactions. In sociology, emotions are examined for the role they play in human society, social patterns and interactions, and culture. In anthropology, the study of humanity, scholars use ethnography to undertake contextual analyzes and cross-cultural comparisons of a range of human activities. Some anthropology studies examine the role of emotions in human activities. In the field of communication studies, critical organizational scholars have examined the role of emotions in organizations, from the perspectives of managers, employees, and even customers. A focus on emotions in organizations can be credited to Arlie Russell Hochschild&#x27;s concept of emotional labor. The University of Queensland hosts EmoNet, an e-mail distribution list representing a network of academics that facilitates scholarly discussion of all matters relating to the study of emotion in organizational settings. The list was established in January 1997 and has over 700 members from across the globe.

In economics, the social science that studies the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services, emotions are analyzed in some sub-fields of microeconomics, in order to assess the role of emotions on purchase decision-making and risk perception. In criminology, a social science approach to the study of crime, scholars often draw on behavioral sciences, sociology, and psychology; emotions are examined in criminology issues such as anomie theory and studies of &quot;toughness&quot;, aggressive behavior, and hooliganism. In law, which underpins civil obedience, politics, economics and society, evidence about people&#x27;s emotions is often raised in tort law claims for compensation and in criminal law prosecutions against alleged lawbreakers (as evidence of the defendant&#x27;s state of mind during trials, sentencing, and parole hearings). In political science, emotions are examined in a number of sub-fields, such as the analysis of voter decision-making.

In philosophy, emotions are studied in sub-fields such as ethics, the philosophy of art (for example, sensory–emotional values, and matters of taste and sentimentality), and the philosophy of music (see also music and emotion). In history, scholars examine documents and other sources to interpret and analyze past activities; speculation on the emotional state of the authors of historical documents is one of the tools of interpretation. In literature and film-making, the expression of emotion is the cornerstone of genres such as drama, melodrama, and romance. In communication studies, scholars study the role that emotion plays in the dissemination of ideas and messages. Emotion is also studied in non-human animals in ethology, a branch of zoology which focuses on the scientific study of animal behavior. Ethology is a combination of laboratory and field science, with strong ties to ecology and evolution. Ethologists often study one type of behavior (for example, aggression) in a number of unrelated animals.

=== History of emotions ===

The history of emotions has become an increasingly popular topic recently, with some scholars arguing that it is an essential category of analysis, not unlike class, race, or gender. Historians, like other social scientists, assume that emotions, feelings and their expressions are regulated in different ways by both different cultures and different historical times, and the constructivist school of history claims even that some sentiments and meta-emotions, for example schadenfreude, are learnt and not only regulated by culture. Historians of emotion trace and analyze the changing norms and rules of feeling, while examining emotional regimes, codes, and lexicons from social, cultural, or political history perspectives. Others focus on the history of medicine, science, or psychology. What somebody can and may feel (and show) in a given situation, towards certain people or things, depends on social norms and rules; thus historically variable and open to change. Several research centers have opened in the past few years in Germany, England, Spain, Sweden, and Australia.

Furthermore, research in historical trauma suggests that some traumatic emotions can be passed on from parents to offspring to second and even third generation, presented as examples of transgenerational trauma.

=== Sociology ===

A common way in which emotions are conceptualized in sociology is in terms of the multidimensional characteristics including cultural or emotional labels (for example, anger, pride, fear, happiness), physiological changes (for example, increased perspiration, changes in pulse rate), expressive facial and body movements (for example, smiling, frowning, baring teeth), and appraisals of situational cues. One comprehensive theory of emotional arousal in humans has been developed by Jonathan Turner (2007: 2009). Two of the key eliciting factors for the arousal of emotions within this theory are expectations states and sanctions. When people enter a situation or encounter with certain expectations for how the encounter should unfold, they will experience different emotions depending on the extent to which expectations for Self, other and situation are met or not met. People can also provide positive or negative sanctions directed at Self or other which also trigger different emotional experiences in individuals. Turner analyzed a wide range of emotion theories across different fields of research including sociology, psychology, evolutionary science, and neuroscience. Based on this analysis, he identified four emotions that all researchers consider being founded on human neurology including assertive-anger, aversion-fear, satisfaction-happiness, and disappointment-sadness. These four categories are called primary emotions and there is some agreement amongst researchers that these primary emotions become combined to produce more elaborate and complex emotional experiences. These more elaborate emotions are called first-order elaborations in Turner&#x27;s theory, and they include sentiments such as pride, triumph, and awe. Emotions can also be experienced at different levels of intensity so that feelings of concern are a low-intensity variation of the primary emotion aversion-fear whereas depression is a higher intensity variant.

Attempts are frequently made to regulate emotion according to the conventions of the society and the situation based on many (sometimes conflicting) demands and expectations which originate from various entities. The expression of anger is in many cultures discouraged in girls and women to a greater extent than in boys and men (the notion being that an angry man has a valid complaint that needs to be rectified, while an angry women is hysterical or oversensitive, and her anger is somehow invalid), while the expression of sadness or fear is discouraged in boys and men relative to girls and women (attitudes implicit in phrases like &quot;man up&quot; or &quot;don&#x27;t be a sissy&quot;). Expectations attached to social roles, such as &quot;acting as man&quot; and not as a woman, and the accompanying &quot;feeling rules&quot; contribute to the differences in expression of certain emotions. Some cultures encourage or discourage happiness, sadness, or jealousy, and the free expression of the emotion of disgust is considered socially unacceptable in most cultures. Some social institutions are seen as based on certain emotion, such as love in the case of contemporary institution of marriage. In advertising, such as health campaigns and political messages, emotional appeals are commonly found. Recent examples include no-smoking health campaigns and political campaigns emphasizing the fear of terrorism.

Sociological attention to emotion has varied over time. Émile Durkheim (1915/1965) wrote about the collective effervescence or emotional energy that was experienced by members of totemic rituals in Australian Aboriginal society. He explained how the heightened state of emotional energy achieved during totemic rituals transported individuals above themselves giving them the sense that they were in the presence of a higher power, a force, that was embedded in the sacred objects that were worshipped. These feelings of exaltation, he argued, ultimately lead people to believe that there were forces that governed sacred objects.

In the 1990s, sociologists focused on different aspects of specific emotions and how these emotions were socially relevant. For Cooley (1992), pride and shame were the most important emotions that drive people to take various social actions. During every encounter, he proposed that we monitor ourselves through the &quot;looking glass&quot; that the gestures and reactions of others provide. Depending on these reactions, we either experience pride or shame and this results in particular paths of action. Retzinger (1991) conducted studies of married couples who experienced cycles of rage and shame. Drawing predominantly on Goffman and Cooley&#x27;s work, Scheff (1990) developed a micro sociological theory of the social bond. The formation or disruption of social bonds is dependent on the emotions that people experience during interactions.

Subsequent to these developments, Randall Collins (2004) formulated his interaction ritual theory by drawing on Durkheim&#x27;s work on totemic rituals that was extended by Goffman (1964/2013; 1967) into everyday focused encounters. Based on interaction ritual theory, we experience different levels or intensities of emotional energy during face-to-face interactions. Emotional energy is considered to be a feeling of confidence to take action and a boldness that one experiences when they are charged up from the collective effervescence generated during group gatherings that reach high levels of intensity.

There is a growing body of research applying the sociology of emotion to understanding the learning experiences of students during classroom interactions with teachers and other students (for example, Milne &amp; Otieno, 2007; Olitsky, 2007; Tobin, et al., 2013; Zembylas, 2002). These studies show that learning subjects like science can be understood in terms of classroom interaction rituals that generate emotional energy and collective states of emotional arousal like emotional climate.

Apart from interaction ritual traditions of the sociology of emotion, other approaches have been classed into one of six other categories:
* evolutionary/biological theories
* symbolic interactionist theories
* dramaturgical theories
* ritual theories
* power and status theories
* stratification theories
* exchange theories

This list provides a general overview of different traditions in the sociology of emotion that sometimes conceptualize emotion in different ways and at other times in complementary ways. Many of these different approaches were synthesized by Turner (2007) in his sociological theory of human emotions in an attempt to produce one comprehensive sociological account that draws on developments from many of the above traditions.

=== Psychotherapy and regulation ===
Emotion regulation refers to the cognitive and behavioral strategies people use to influence their own emotional experience. For example, a behavioral strategy in which one avoids a situation to avoid unwanted emotions (trying not to think about the situation, doing distracting activities, etc.). Depending on the particular school&#x27;s general emphasis on either cognitive components of emotion, physical energy discharging, or on symbolic movement and facial expression components of emotion different schools of psychotherapy approach the regulation of emotion differently. Cognitively oriented schools approach them via their cognitive components, such as rational emotive behavior therapy. Yet others approach emotions via symbolic movement and facial expression components (like in contemporary Gestalt therapy).

=== Cross-cultural research ===
Research on emotions reveals the strong presence of cross-cultural differences in emotional reactions and that emotional reactions are likely to be culture-specific. In strategic settings, cross-cultural research on emotions is required for understanding the psychological situation of a given population or specific actors. This implies the need to comprehend the current emotional state, mental disposition or other behavioral motivation of a target audience located in a different culture, basically founded on its national, political, social, economic, and psychological peculiarities but also subject to the influence of circumstances and events.

=== Computer science ===

In the 2000s, research in computer science, engineering, psychology and neuroscience has been aimed at developing devices that recognize human affect display and model emotions. In computer science, affective computing is a branch of the study and development of artificial intelligence that deals with the design of systems and devices that can recognize, interpret, and process human emotions. It is an interdisciplinary field spanning computer sciences, psychology, and cognitive science. While the origins of the field may be traced as far back as to early philosophical enquiries into emotion, the more modern branch of computer science originated with Rosalind Picard&#x27;s 1995 paper on affective computing. Detecting emotional information begins with passive sensors which capture data about the user&#x27;s physical state or behavior without interpreting the input. The data gathered is analogous to the cues humans use to perceive emotions in others. Another area within affective computing is the design of computational devices proposed to exhibit either innate emotional capabilities or that are capable of convincingly simulating emotions. Emotional speech processing recognizes the user&#x27;s emotional state by analyzing speech patterns. The detection and processing of facial expression or body gestures is achieved through detectors and sensors.

== Effects on memory ==
Emotion affects the way autobiographical memories are encoded and retrieved. Emotional memories are reactivated more, they are remembered better and have more attention devoted to them. Through remembering our past achievements and failures, autobiographical memories affect how we perceive and feel about ourselves.

== Notable theorists ==

In the late 19th century, the most influential theorists were William James (1842–1910) and Carl Lange (1834–1900). James was an American psychologist and philosopher who wrote about educational psychology, psychology of religious experience/mysticism, and the philosophy of pragmatism. Lange was a Danish physician and psychologist. Working independently, they developed the James–Lange theory, a hypothesis on the origin and nature of emotions. The theory states that within human beings, as a response to experiences in the world, the autonomic nervous system creates physiological events such as muscular tension, a rise in heart rate, perspiration, and dryness of the mouth. Emotions, then, are feelings which come about as a result of these physiological changes, rather than being their cause.

Silvan Tomkins (1911–1991) developed the affect theory and script theory. The affect theory introduced the concept of basic emotions, and was based on the idea that the dominance of the emotion, which he called the affected system, was the motivating force in human life.

<text>Epictetus (, ; , &quot;Epíktētos&quot;; 50 135 AD) was a Greek Stoic philosopher. He was born into slavery at Hierapolis, Phrygia (present-day Pamukkale, in western Turkey) and lived in Rome until his banishment, when he went to Nicopolis in northwestern Greece, where he spent the rest of his life. 

Epictetus studied Stoic philosophy under Musonius Rufus and after manumission, his formal emancipation from slavery, he began to teach philosophy. Subject to the banishment of all philosophers from Rome by Emperor Domitian toward the end of the first century, Epictetus founded a school of philosophy in Nicopolis. Epictetus taught that philosophy is a way of life and not simply a theoretical discipline. To Epictetus, all external events are beyond our control; he argues that we should accept whatever happens calmly and dispassionately. However, he held that individuals are responsible for their own actions, which they can examine and control through rigorous self-discipline. His teachings were written down and published by his pupil Arrian in his &quot;Discourses&quot; and &quot;Enchiridion&quot;. They influenced many later thinkers including Marcus Aurelius, Pascal, Diderot, Montesquieu, and Rabelais.

== Life ==
Having described himself as old in 108 AD, Epictetus is presumed to have been born around AD 50, at Hierapolis, Phrygia. The name given by his parents is unknown. The name by which he is known is derived from the word &quot;epíktētos&quot; (ἐπίκτητος) that in Greek, simply means &quot;gained&quot; or &quot;acquired&quot;; the Greek philosopher Plato, in his &quot;Laws&quot;, used that term to mean property that is &quot;added to one&#x27;s hereditary property&quot;. Epictetus spent his youth in Rome as a slave to Epaphroditus, a wealthy freedman who was secretary to Nero. His social position was thus complicated, combining the low status of a slave with the high status of one with a personal connection to Imperial power.

Early in life, Epictetus acquired a passion for philosophy and, with the permission of his wealthy master, he studied Stoic philosophy under Musonius Rufus. Becoming more educated in this way raised his social status. At some point, he became disabled. Celsus, quoted by Origen, wrote that this was because his leg had been deliberately broken by his master. Without citing a cause, Simplicius wrote that Epictetus had been disabled from childhood.
Epictetus obtained his freedom sometime after the death of Nero in AD 68, and he began to teach philosophy in Rome. Around AD 93, when the Roman emperor Domitian banished all philosophers from the city, Epictetus moved to Nicopolis in Epirus, Greece, where he founded a school of philosophy.

His most famous pupil, Arrian, studied under him as a young man (around AD 108) and claimed to have written his famous &quot;Discourses&quot; based on the notes he took about lectures by Epictetus. Arrian argued that his Discourses should be considered comparable to the Socratic literature. Arrian described Epictetus as a powerful speaker who could &quot;induce his listener to feel just what Epictetus wanted him to feel&quot;. Many eminent figures sought conversations with him. Emperor Hadrian was friendly with him, possibly having heard Epictetus speak at his school in Nicopolis.

Epictetus lived a life of great simplicity, with few possessions. He lived alone for a long time, but in his old age, he adopted the child of a friend who otherwise would have been left to die, and raised him with the aid of a woman. It is unclear whether Epictetus and she were married. He died sometime around AD 135. After his death, according to Lucian, his oil lamp was purchased by an admirer for 3,000 drachmae.

== Thought ==
No writings by Epictetus are known. His discourses were transcribed and compiled by his pupil Arrian (). The main work is &quot;The Discourses&quot;, four books of which have been preserved (out of the original eight). Arrian also compiled a popular digest, entitled the &quot;Enchiridion&quot;, or &quot;Handbook&quot;, of Epictetus. In a preface to the &quot;Discourses&quot; that is addressed to Lucius Gellius, Arrian states that &quot;whatever I heard him say I used to write down, word for word, as best I could, endeavouring to preserve it as a memorial, for my own future use, of his way of thinking and the frankness of his speech&quot;. In the sixth century, the Neoplatonist philosopher Simplicius wrote an extant commentary on the &quot;Enchiridion&quot;.

Epictetus maintains that the foundation of all philosophy is self-knowledge; that is, the conviction of our ignorance and gullibility ought to be the first subject of our study. Logic provides valid reasoning and certainty in judgment, but it is subordinate to practical needs. He also maintained that the first and most necessary part of philosophy concerns the application of doctrine, for example, that people should not lie. The second concerns reasons, e.g., why people should not lie. The third, lastly, examines and establishes the reasons. This is the logical part, which finds reasons, shows what is a reason, and that a given reason is a correct one. This last part is necessary, but only on account of the second, which again is rendered necessary by the first.

===&quot;Prohairesis&quot;===
Both the &quot;Discourses&quot; and the &quot;Enchiridion&quot; begin by distinguishing between those things in our power (&quot;prohairetic&quot; things) and those things not in our power (&quot;aprohairetic&quot; things).

That alone is in our power, which is our own work; and in this class are our opinions, impulses, desires, and aversions. On the contrary, what is not in our power, are our bodies, possessions, glory, and power. Any delusion on this point leads to the greatest errors, misfortunes, and troubles, and to the slavery of the soul.

The determination between what is good and what is not good is made by the capacity for choice (&quot;prohairesis&quot;). Prohairesis allows us to act, and gives us the kind of freedom that only rational animals have. It is determined by our reason, which of all our faculties, sees and tests itself and everything else. It is the correct use of the impressions (&quot;phantasia&quot;) that bombard the mind that is in our power:

Practice then from the start to say to every harsh impression, &quot;You are an impression, and not at all the thing you appear to be.&quot; Then examine it and test it by these rules you have, and firstly, and chiefly, by this: whether the impression has to do with the things that are up to us, or those that are not; and if it has to do with the things that are not up to us, be ready to reply, &quot;It is nothing to me.&quot;

We will not be troubled at any loss, but will say to ourselves on such an occasion: &quot;I have lost nothing that belongs to me; it was not something of mine that was torn from me, but something that was not in my power has left me.&quot; Nothing beyond the use of our opinion is properly ours. Every possession rests on opinion. What is to cry and to weep? An opinion. What is misfortune, or a quarrel, or a complaint? All these things are opinions; opinions founded on the delusion that what is not subject to our own choice can be either good or evil, which it cannot. By rejecting these opinions, and seeking good and evil in the power of choice alone, we may confidently achieve peace of mind in every condition of life.

=== Good and evil ===
Epictetus says that:

Reason alone is good, the irrational is evil, and the irrational is intolerable to the rational. The good person should labour chiefly on their own reason; to perfect this is in our power. To repel evil opinions by the good is the noble contest in which humans should engage; it is not an easy task, but it promises true freedom, peace of mind (&quot;ataraxia&quot;), and a divine command over the emotions (&quot;apatheia&quot;). We should especially be on our guard against the opinion of pleasure because of its apparent sweetness and charms. The first object of philosophy, therefore, is to purify the mind.

The preconceptions (&quot;prolepsis&quot;) of good and evil are common to all. Good alone is profitable and to be desired, and evil is hurtful and to be avoided. Different opinions arise only from the application of these preconceptions to particular cases, and it is then that the darkness of ignorance, which blindly maintains the correctness of its own opinion, must be dispelled. People entertain different and conflicting opinions of good, and in their judgment of a particular good, people frequently contradict themselves. Philosophy should provide a standard for good and evil. This process is greatly facilitated because the mind and the works of the mind are alone in our power, whereas all external things that aid life are beyond our control.

The essence of divinity is goodness; we have all good that could be given to us. The deities too gave us the soul and reason, which is not measured by breadth or depth, but by knowledge and sentiments, and by which we attain to greatness, and may equal even with the deities. We should, therefore, cultivate the mind with special care. If we wish for nothing, but what the gods will, we shall be truly free, and all will come to pass with us according to our desire; and we shall be as little subject to restraint as Zeus himself.

Every individual is connected with the rest of the world, and the universe is fashioned for universal harmony. Wise people, therefore, will pursue, not merely their own will, but also will be subject to the rightful order of the world. We should conduct ourselves through life fulfilling all our duties as children, siblings, parents, and citizens.

For our country or friends we ought to be ready to undergo or perform the greatest difficulties. The good person, if able to foresee the future, would peacefully and contentedly help to bring about their own sickness, maiming, and even death, knowing that this is the correct order of the universe. We have all a certain part to play in the world, and we have done enough when we have performed what our nature allows. In the exercise of our powers, we may become aware of the destiny we are intended to fulfil.

We are like travellers at an inn or guests at a stranger&#x27;s table; whatever is offered we take with thankfulness, and sometimes, when the turn comes, we may refuse; in the former case we are a worthy guest of the deities, and in the latter we appear as a sharer in their power. Anyone who finds life intolerable is free to quit it, but we should not abandon our appointed role without sufficient reason. The Stoic sage will never find life intolerable and will complain of no one, neither deity nor human. Those who go wrong we should pardon and treat with compassion, since it is from ignorance that they err, being as it were, blind.

It is only our opinions and principles that can render us unhappy, and it is only the ignorant person who finds fault with another. Every desire degrades us, and renders us slaves of what we desire. We ought not to forget the transitory character of all external advantages, even in the midst of our enjoyment of them; but always to bear in mind that they are not our own, and that therefore, they do not properly belong to us. Thus prepared, we shall never be carried away by opinions.

The final entry of the &quot;Enchiridion,&quot; or &quot;Handbook,&quot; begins: &quot;Upon all occasions we ought to have these maxims ready at hand&quot;:

== Influence ==
===&quot;Dialogue Between the Emperor Hadrian and Epictetus&quot;===

Epictetus appears in a second or third century &quot;Dialogue Between the Emperor Hadrian and Epictetus the Philosopher&quot;. This short Latin text consists of seventy-three short questions supposedly posed by Hadrian and answered by Epictetus. This dialogue was very popular in the Middle Ages with many translations and adaptations.

=== Philosophy ===
==== Marcus Aurelius ====
The philosophy of Epictetus influenced the Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius (AD 121 to AD 180), who cites Epictetus in his &quot;Meditations&quot;.

==== French philosophers ====
Enlightenment philosophers Voltaire, Montesquieu, Denis Diderot, and Baron d&#x27;Holbach all read the &quot;Enchiridion&quot; when they were students. Blaise Pascal listed Epictetus as among those philosophers he was most familiar with, describing him as a &quot;great mind&quot; who is &quot;among the philosophers of the world who have best understood the duties&quot; of an individual.

=== Literature ===
The philosophy of Epictetus plays a key role in the 1998 novel &quot;A Man in Full&quot; by Tom Wolfe. This was in part the outcome of discussions Wolfe had with James Stockdale (see below). The character Conrad, who through a series of mishaps finds himself in jail and accidentally acquires a copy of the &quot;Enchiridion of Epictetus&quot;, the Stoic&#x27;s manual, discovers a philosophy that strengthens him to endure the brutality of the prison environment. He experiences Joseph Campbell&#x27;s &#x27;hero&#x27;s journey&#x27; call to action and becomes a strong, honorable, undefeatable protagonist. The importance of Epictetus&#x27; Stoicism for Stockdale, its role in &quot;A Man in Full&quot;, and its significance in Ridley Scott&#x27;s film &quot;Gladiator&quot; are discussed by William O. Stephens in &quot;The Rebirth of Stoicism?&quot;.

Mohun Biswas, in the novel &quot;A House for Mr Biswas&quot; (1961), by V. S. Naipaul, is pleased to think himself a follower of Epictetus and Marcus Aurelius; the irony is that he never actually behaves as a Stoic.

&quot;Everything has two handles, the one by which it may be carried, the other by which it cannot&quot; is the theme of &quot;Disturbances in the Field&quot; (1983), by Lynne Sharon Schwartz. Lydia, the central character, turns often to &quot;The Golden Sayings of Epictetus&quot; – the latter being a modern selection from Epictetus&#x27;s writings, compiled and translated by Hastings Crossley.

A line from the &quot;Enchiridion&quot; is used as a title quotation in &quot;The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman&quot; by Laurence Sterne, which translates to, &quot;Not things, but opinions about things, trouble men.&quot;

Epictetus is mentioned in &quot;A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man&quot; by James Joyce: in the fifth chapter of the novel the protagonist Stephen Dedalus discusses Epictetus&#x27;s famous lamp with a dean of his college. Epictetus also is mentioned briefly in &quot;Franny and Zooey&quot; by J. D. Salinger, and is referred to by Theodore Dreiser in his novel &quot;Sister Carrie&quot;. Both the longevity of Epictetus&#x27;s life and his philosophy are alluded to in John Berryman&#x27;s poem &quot;Of Suicide&quot;.

Epictetus is referred to, but not mentioned by name, in Matthew Arnold&#x27;s sonnet &quot;To a Friend&quot;. Arnold provides three historical personalities as his inspiration and support in difficult times (Epictetus is preceded by Homer and succeeded by Sophocles):

&lt;poem&gt;Much he, whose friendship I not long since won,
That halting slave, who in Nicopolis
Taught Arrian, when Vespasian&#x27;s brutal son
Cleared Rome of what most shamed him.&lt;/poem&gt;

The title character in Julian Barnes&#x27;s 2022 novel &quot;Elizabeth Finch&quot; impresses the teachings of Epictetus on her students.

==== François Rabelais ====
In the Chapter XXX of François Rabelais&#x27; &quot;Pantagruel&quot; (c. 1532), Pantagruel&#x27;s tutor Epistemon had his head cut off after a battle. After he had his head reattached and was brought back to life, he recounts his experience of the damned in hell:

=== Military ===
==== James Stockdale ====
James Stockdale, a fighter pilot who was shot down while serving in the Vietnam War, was influenced by Epictetus. He was introduced to his works while at Stanford University. In &quot;Courage under Fire: Testing Epictetus&#x27;s Doctrines in a Laboratory of Human Behavior&quot; (1993), Stockdale credits Epictetus with helping him endure his seven and a half years in captivity, which included torture and four years in solitary confinement. When he was shot down, he reportedly said to himself &quot;I&#x27;m leaving the world of technology and entering the world of Epictetus!&quot; as he bailed out.

Quoting Epictetus, Stockdale concludes the book with:

The emotions of grief, pity, and even affection are well-known disturbers of the soul. Grief is the most offensive; Epictetus considered the suffering of grief an act of evil. It is a willful act, going against the will of God to have all men share happiness.

=== Psychology ===
Psychologist Albert Ellis, the founder of Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy, credited Epictetus with providing a foundation for his system of psychotherapy.

=== Religion ===
Kiyozawa Manshi, a controversial reformer within the Higashi Honganji branch of Jodo Shinshu Buddhism, cited Epictetus as one of the three major influences on his spiritual development and thought.

<text>Edward Lear (12 May 1812 – 29 January 1888) was an English artist, illustrator, musician, author and poet, who is known mostly for his literary nonsense in poetry and prose and especially his limericks, a form he popularised.

His principal areas of work as an artist were threefold: as a draughtsman employed to make illustrations of birds and animals, making coloured drawings during his journeys (which he reworked later, sometimes as plates for his travel books) and as a minor illustrator of Alfred, Lord Tennyson&#x27;s poems.

As an author, he is known principally for his popular nonsense collections of poems, songs, short stories, botanical drawings, recipes and alphabets. He also composed and published twelve musical settings of Tennyson&#x27;s poetry.

==Biography==

===Early years===
Lear was born into a middle-class family at Holloway, North London, the penultimate of 21 children (and youngest to survive) of Ann Clark Skerrett and Jeremiah Lear, a stockbroker formerly working for the family sugar refining business. He was raised by his eldest sister, also named Ann, 21 years his senior. Jeremiah Lear ended up defaulting to the London Stock Exchange in the economic upheaval following the Napoleonic Wars. Because of the family&#x27;s now more limited finances, when he was aged four, Lear and his sister were required to leave the family home, Bowmans Lodge, and live together. Ann doted on Edward and continued to act as a mother to him until her death, when he was almost 50 years of age.

Lear had lifelong health problems. From the age of six, he had frequent &quot;grand mal&quot; epileptic seizures, bronchitis, asthma and, during later life, partial blindness. Lear experienced his first seizure at a fair near Highgate when with his father. The event scared and embarrassed him. He felt lifelong guilt and shame for his epileptic condition, and his adult diaries indicate that he always sensed the onset of a seizure in time to remove himself from public view. When Lear was about seven years old he began to show signs of depression, possibly due to the instability of his childhood. He had periods of severe melancholia which he referred to as &quot;the Morbids&quot;.

===Artist===

Lear was already drawing &quot;for bread and cheese&quot; by the time he was aged 16 and soon developed into a serious &quot;ornithological draughtsman&quot; employed by the Zoological Society and from 1832 to 1836 by the Earl of Derby, who kept a private menagerie at his estate, Knowsley Hall. He was the first major bird artist to draw birds from life rather than the skins of specimens. Lear&#x27;s first publication, published when he was 19 years old, was &quot;Illustrations of the Family of Psittacidae, or Parrots&quot; in 1830. One of the greatest ornithological artists of his era, he taught Elizabeth Gould whilst also contributing to John Gould&#x27;s works and was compared by some to the naturalist John James Audubon. In honour of Lear&#x27;s bird illustrations, &quot;Anodorhynchus leari&quot;, popular name Lear&#x27;s macaw, is named after him.

After his eyesight deteriorated too much to work with such precision on the fine drawings and etchings of plates used in lithography, he turned to landscape painting and travel.

Among other travels, he visited Greece and Egypt during 1848–49 and toured India during 1873–75, including a brief detour to Ceylon. While travelling he produced large quantities of coloured wash drawings in a distinctive style, which he converted later in his studio into oil and watercolour paintings, as well as prints for his books. His landscape style often shows views with strong sunlight, with intense contrasts of colour. 

Between 1878 and 1883, Lear spent his summers on Monte Generoso, a mountain on the border between the Swiss canton of Ticino and the Italian region of Lombardy. His oil painting &quot;The Plains of Lombardy from Monte Generoso&quot; is in the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford.

Throughout his life, he continued to paint seriously. He had a lifelong ambition to illustrate Tennyson&#x27;s poems; near the end of his life, a volume with a small number of illustrations was published.

=== &quot;Illustrated Excursions in Italy&quot; (1842–47) ===
In 1842, Lear began a journey into the Italian peninsula, travelling through the Lazio, Rome, Abruzzo, Molise, Apulia, Basilicata, Calabria and Sicily. In personal notes, together with drawings, Lear gathered his impressions on the Italian way of life, folk traditions, and the beauty of the ancient monuments. Of particular interest to Lear was the Abruzzo, which he visited in 1843, through the Marsica (Celano, Avezzano, Alba Fucens, Trasacco) and the plateau of Cinque Miglia (Castel di Sangro and Alfedena), by an old sheep track of the shepherds.

Lear drew a sketch of the medieval village of Albe with Mount Sirente, and described the medieval village of Celano, with the castle of Piccolomini dominating the vast plain of Lago Fucino, which was drained a few years later to promote agricultural development. At Castel di Sangro, Lear described the winter stillness of the mountains and the beautiful basilica.

More adventurous was the voyage to the regions of southern Italy in 1847, described in Lear&#x27;s &quot;Journals of a Landscape Painter in Southern Calabria, &amp; c&quot;. The broad Calabria section in which Lear tells his itinerary among breathtaking landscapes and often surreal characters, is thought to be among the best in his travel literature.

===Composer and musician===

Lear primarily played the piano, but he also played the accordion, flute, and small guitar. He composed music for many Romantic and Victorian poems, but was known mostly for his many musical settings of Tennyson&#x27;s poetry. He published four settings in 1853, five in 1859, and three in 1860. Lear&#x27;s were the only musical settings that Tennyson approved of. Lear also composed music for many of his nonsense songs, including &quot;The Owl and the Pussy-Cat&quot;, but only two of the scores have survived, the music for &quot;The Courtship of the Yonghy-Bonghy-Bò&quot; and &quot;The Pelican Chorus&quot;. While he never played professionally, he did perform his own nonsense songs and his settings of others&#x27; poetry at countless social gatherings, sometimes adding his own lyrics (as with the song &quot;The Nervous Family&quot;), and sometimes replacing serious lyrics with nursery rhymes.

===Relationships===
Lear&#x27;s most fervent and painful friendship was with Franklin Lushington. He met the young barrister in Malta in 1849 and toured southern Greece with him. Lear developed an infatuation for him that Lushington did not wholly reciprocate. Although they remained friends for almost forty years until Lear&#x27;s death, the disparity of their feelings constantly tormented Lear. Indeed, Lear&#x27;s attempts at male companionship were not always successful; the very intensity of Lear&#x27;s affections may have doomed these relationships.

He proposed twice to another writer, Augusta Bethell, whom he had known for a long time, when he was 26 years her senior. For companions, he relied instead on friends and correspondents, and especially, during later life, on his Albanian Souliote chef, Giorgis, a faithful friend and (as Lear complained) a thoroughly unsatisfactory chef. Another trusted companion in San Remo was his cat, Foss, who died in 1887 and was buried with some ceremony in a garden at Villa Tennyson.

===San Remo and death===
Lear eventually settled in San Remo, on his beloved Mediterranean coast in the 1870s at a villa he named &quot;Villa Tennyson&quot;.

Lear was known to introduce himself with a long pseudonym: &quot;Mr Abebika kratoponoko Prizzikalo Kattefello Ablegorabalus Ableborinto phashyph&quot; or &quot;Chakonoton the Cozovex Dossi Fossi Sini Tomentilla Coronilla Polentilla
Battledore &amp; Shuttlecock Derry down Derry Dumps&quot;, which he based on &quot;Aldiborontiphoskyphorniostikos&quot;.

After a long decline in his health, Lear died at his villa in 1888 of heart disease, which he had since at least 1870. Lear&#x27;s funeral was described as a sad, lonely affair by the wife of Dr. Hassall, Lear&#x27;s physician, none of Lear&#x27;s many lifelong friends being able to attend.

Lear is buried in the Cemetery Foce in San Remo. On his headstone are inscribed these lines about Mount Tomohrit (in Albania) from Tennyson&#x27;s poem &quot;To E.L. [Edward Lear], On His Travels in Greece&quot;:
The centenary of his death was marked in Britain with a set of Royal Mail stamps in 1988 and an exhibition at the Royal Academy. Lear&#x27;s birthplace area is now marked with a plaque at Bowman&#x27;s Mews, Islington, in London, and his bicentenary during 2012 was celebrated with a variety of events, exhibitions and lectures in venues across the world including an International Owl and Pussycat Day on his birth anniversary.

==Author==

In 1846, Lear published &quot;A Book of Nonsense,&quot; a volume of limericks which went through three editions and helped popularise the form and the genre of literary nonsense. In 1871, he published &quot;Nonsense Songs, Stories, Botany and Alphabets&quot;, which included the nonsense song &quot;The Owl and the Pussy-Cat&quot;, which he wrote for the children of his patron Edward Stanley, 13th Earl of Derby. Many other works followed.

Lear&#x27;s nonsense books were quite popular during his lifetime, but a rumour developed that &quot;Edward Lear&quot; was merely a pseudonym, and the books&#x27; true author was the man to whom Lear had dedicated the works, his patron the Earl of Derby. Promoters of this rumour offered as evidence that both men were named Edward, and that &quot;Lear&quot; is an anagram of &quot;Earl&quot;.

Lear&#x27;s nonsense works are distinguished by a facility of verbal invention and a poet&#x27;s delight in the sounds of words, both real and imaginary. A stuffed rhinoceros becomes a &quot;diaphanous doorscraper&quot;. A &quot;blue Boss-Woss&quot; plunges into &quot;a perpendicular, spicular, orbicular, quadrangular, circular depth of soft mud&quot;. His heroes are Quangle-Wangles, Pobbles, and Jumblies. One of his most famous verbal inventions, the phrase &quot;runcible spoon&quot;, occurs in the closing lines of &quot;The Owl and the Pussy-Cat&quot; and is now found in many English dictionaries.
Though known for his neologisms, Lear used a number of other devices in his works in order to defy reader expectations. For example, &quot;Cold Are the Crabs&quot; conforms to the sonnet tradition until its dramatically foreshortened last line.
Today, limericks are invariably typeset as five lines. Lear&#x27;s limericks, however, were published in a variety of formats; it appears that Lear wrote them in manuscript in as many lines as there was room for beneath the picture. For the first three editions, most are typeset as, respectively, two, five, and three lines. The cover of one edition bears an entire limerick typeset in two lines:
In Lear&#x27;s limericks, the first and last lines usually end with the same word rather than rhyming. For the most part they are truly nonsensical and devoid of any punch line or point. They are completely free of the bawdiness with which the verse form is now associated. A typical thematic element is the presence of a callous and critical &quot;they&quot;. An example of a typical Lear limerick:
Lear&#x27;s self-description in verse, &quot;How Pleasant to know Mr. Lear,&quot; ends with this stanza, a reference to his own mortality:
Five of Lear&#x27;s limericks from the &quot;Book of Nonsense&quot; (in the 1946 Italian translation by Carlo Izzo) were set to music for choir a cappella by Goffredo Petrassi in 1952.

==Portrayals==
Edward Lear has been played in radio dramas by Andrew Sachs in &quot;The Need for Nonsense&quot; by Julia Blackburn (BBC Radio 4, 9 February 2009) and by Derek Jacobi in &quot;By the Coast of Coromandel&quot; by Lavinia Murray (BBC Radio 4, 21 December 2011). He was portrayed on television by Robert Lang in &quot;Edward Lear: On the Edge of the Sand&quot; a special episode of The Natural World, BBC2 14 April 1985.

==In popular culture==
Lear&#x27;s written work was used extensively in the short-lived &quot;The Tomfoolery Show,&quot; a Saturday morning cartoon that was produced by Rankin-Bass and broadcast on NBC from 1970 to 1971. &quot;A Beach Full of Shells&quot;, the 20th album by musician Al Stewart pays tribute in the song &quot;Mr. Lear&quot;, celebrating Foss and many events from Lear&#x27;s life.

<doc id="10409" wikidata="Q255630" url="?curid=10409" title="Eve Arden">
<text>Eve Arden (born Eunice Mary Quedens, April 30, 1908 – November 12, 1990) was an American film, radio, stage and television actress. She performed in leading and supporting roles for nearly six decades.

Beginning her film career in 1929 and on Broadway in the early 1930s, Arden&#x27;s first major role was in the RKO Radio Pictures drama &quot;Stage Door&quot; (1937) opposite Katharine Hepburn, followed by roles in the comedies &quot;Having Wonderful Time&quot; (1938) and &quot;At the Circus&quot; (1939). She received an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actress for her role in &quot;Mildred Pierce&quot; (1945).

Somewhat surprisingly for an actress of Arden&#x27;s refinement and wit, she appeared to good effect in a number of films noir, some exceptionally high-profile, including &quot;Mildred Pierce&quot;, &quot;The Unfaithful&quot; (1947), &quot;The Arnelo Affair&quot; (1947), &quot;Whiplash&quot; (1948), and &quot;Anatomy of a Murder&quot; (1959).

Later in her career, Arden moved to television, playing a sardonic but engaging high school teacher in &quot;Our Miss Brooks&quot;, for which she won the first Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series. She also played the maternity ward nurse in &quot;Bewitched&quot; and the school principal in the film musicals &quot;Grease&quot; (1978) and &quot;Grease 2&quot; (1982).

==Early life==

Eve Arden was born Eunice Mary Quedens on April 30, 1908, in Mill Valley, California, to Charles Peter Quedens, the son of Charles Henry Augustus Quedens and Eunice Meta Dierks, and Lucille Frank, the daughter of Bernard Frank and Louisa Mertens. Lucille, a milliner, divorced Charles over his gambling and went into business for herself.

Although not Catholic, young Eunice was sent to a Dominican convent school in San Rafael, California. She then attended Tamalpais High School, a public high school in Mill Valley, until age 16. After leaving school, she joined the stock theater company of Henry &quot;Terry&quot; Duffy.

==Career==
===Film===

She made her film debut under her real name in the backstage musical &quot;Song of Love&quot; (1929), as a wisecracking, homewrecking showgirl who becomes a rival to the film&#x27;s star, singer Belle Baker. The film was one of Columbia Pictures&#x27; earliest successes. In 1933, she relocated to New York City, where she had supporting parts in several Broadway stage productions. In 1934, she was cast in the &quot;Ziegfeld Follies&quot; revue, the first role where she was credited as Eve Arden. When she was told to adopt a stage name for the show, Arden looked at her cosmetics and &quot;stole my first name from Evening in Paris, and the second from Elizabeth Arden&quot;. Between 1934 and 1941, she appeared in Broadway productions of &quot;Parade&quot;, &quot;Very Warm for May&quot;, &quot;Two for the Show&quot;, and &quot;Let&#x27;s Face It!&quot;.

Arden&#x27;s film career began in earnest in 1937 when she signed a contract with RKO Radio Pictures and appeared in the films &quot;Oh Doctor&quot; and &quot;Stage Door&quot;. Her &quot;Stage Door&quot; portrayal of a fast-talking, witty supporting character gained Arden considerable notice and was a template for many of Arden&#x27;s future roles.
In 1938, she played a supporting part in the comedy &quot;Having Wonderful Time&quot;, starring Ginger Rogers and Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. This was followed by roles in the crime film &quot;The Forgotten Woman&quot; (1939), and the Marx Brothers comedy &quot;At the Circus&quot; (1939), a role that required her to perform acrobatics.

In 1940, she appeared in support of Clark Gable and Hedy Lamarr in &quot;Comrade X&quot;, followed by support in the drama &quot;Manpower&quot; (1941) opposite Marlene Dietrich, Edward G. Robinson and George Raft. She also had a supporting part in the Red Skelton comedy &quot;Whistling in the Dark&quot; (1941) and the romantic comedy &quot;Obliging Young Lady&quot; (1942).

Her many memorable screen roles include a supporting role as Joan Crawford&#x27;s wise-cracking friend in &quot;Mildred Pierce&quot; (1945), for which she received an Academy Award nomination as Best Supporting Actress; as a catty cousin turned peacemaker in The Unfaithful (1947); and as James Stewart&#x27;s wistful but wry secretary in Otto Preminger&#x27;s mystery &quot;Anatomy of a Murder&quot; (1959) (which also featured her husband, Brooks West). In 1946, exhibitors voted her the sixth-most promising &quot;star of tomorrow&quot;.

Arden became familiar to a new generation of filmgoers when she played Principal McGee in &quot;Grease&quot; (1978) and &quot;Grease 2 (1982)&quot;. Arden was known for her deadpan comedic delivery.

===Radio and television===

Arden&#x27;s ability with witty scripts made her a natural talent for radio. She was a regular on Danny Kaye&#x27;s short-lived but memorably zany comedy-variety show in 1946, which also featured swing bandleader Harry James and gravel-voiced character actor-comedian Lionel Stander.

The additional exposure of Arden&#x27;s comic talent on Kaye&#x27;s show led to her best-known role, that of Madison High School English teacher Connie Brooks in &quot;Our Miss Brooks&quot;. Arden portrayed the character on radio from 1948 to 1957, in a television version of the program from 1952 to 1956, and in a 1956 feature film. Her character clashed with the school&#x27;s principal, Osgood Conklin (played by Gale Gordon) and nursed an unrequited crush on fellow teacher Philip Boynton (played originally by future film star Jeff Chandler; and later on radio and TV by Robert Rockwell). Except for Chandler, the entire radio cast of Arden, Gordon, Richard Crenna (Walter Denton), Robert Rockwell (Mr. Philip Boynton), Gloria McMillan (Harriet Conklin) and Jane Morgan (landlady Margaret Davis) played the same roles on TV.

Arden&#x27;s portrayal of Miss Brooks was so popular that she was made an honorary member of the National Education Association, received a 1952 award from the Teachers College of Connecticut&#x27;s Alumni Association &quot;for humanizing the American teacher&quot;, and even received teaching job offers. Her well-established wisecracking, deadpan character ultimately became her public persona as a comedienne.

She won a listeners&#x27; poll by &quot;Radio Mirror&quot; magazine as the top-ranking comedienne of 1948–1949, receiving her award at the end of an &quot;Our Miss Brooks&quot; broadcast that March. &quot;I&#x27;m certainly going to try in the coming months to merit the honor you&#x27;ve bestowed upon me, because I understand that if I win this (award) two years in a row, I get to keep Mr. Boynton,&quot; she joked. She was also a hit with the critics: A winter 1949 poll of newspaper and magazine radio editors by &quot;Motion Picture Daily&quot; named her the year&#x27;s best radio comedienne.

Arden had a very brief guest appearance in a 1955 &quot;I Love Lucy&quot; episode titled &quot;L.A. at Last&quot;, where she played herself. While awaiting their food at the Brown Derby, Lucy Ricardo (Lucille Ball) and Ethel Mertz (Vivian Vance) argue over whether a certain portrait on a nearby wall is Shelley Winters or Judy Holliday. Lucy urges Ethel to ask a lady occupying the next booth, who turns and replies, &quot;Neither. That&#x27;s Eve Arden.&quot; As Ethel realizes she just spoke to Arden herself, Arden passes Lucy and Ethel&#x27;s table to leave the restaurant while the pair gawk.
Desilu Productions, jointly owned by Desi Arnaz and Ball during their marriage, was the production company for the &quot;Our Miss Brooks&quot; television show, filmed during the same years as &quot;I Love Lucy&quot;. Ball and Arden met when they costarred in the film &quot;Stage Door&quot; in 1937. Ball, according to numerous radio historians, suggested Arden for &quot;Our Miss Brooks&quot; after Shirley Booth auditioned for but failed to land the role and Ball—committed at the time to &quot;My Favorite Husband&quot;—could not.

Arden tried another series for CBS in the fall of 1957, &quot;The Eve Arden Show&quot;, but it was canceled in spring of 1958 after 26 episodes. In 1966, she played Nurse Kelton in an episode of &quot;Bewitched&quot;. She later costarred with Kaye Ballard as her neighbor and in-law, Eve Hubbard, in the 1967–1969 NBC situation comedy &quot;The Mothers-in-Law&quot;, produced by Arnaz after the dissolution of Desilu Productions. In her later career, Arden made appearances on such television shows as &quot;Bewitched&quot;, &quot;Alice&quot;, &quot;Maude, Hart to Hart&quot;, and &quot;Falcon Crest&quot;. In 1985, she appeared as the wicked stepmother in the &quot;Faerie Tale Theatre&quot; production of &quot;Cinderella&quot;.

===Stage===
Arden was one of many actresses to take on the title roles in &quot;Hello, Dolly!&quot; and &quot;Auntie Mame&quot; in the 1960s; in 1967, she won the Sarah Siddons Award for her work in Chicago theater. In 1983, Arden was cast as the leading lady in what was to be her Broadway comeback, &quot;Moose Murders&quot;, but she withdrew and was replaced with the much younger Holland Taylor after one preview performance, citing &quot;artistic differences&quot;. The show went on to open and close on the same night, becoming known a legendary flop in Broadway history.

==Personal life==
Arden was married to Edward Grinnell &quot;Ned&quot; Bergen 1939–47 and reportedly had a long relationship with Danny Kaye through the 1940s (likely starting from their Broadway work on &quot;Let&#x27;s Face It!&quot; in 1941). Arden was married to actor Brooks West from 1952 until his death in 1984 from a brain hemorrhage at age 67. She adopted her first child with Bergen and a second child as a single mother after her divorce from him; she adopted her third child with West and gave birth to her youngest (with West) at age 46 in 1954. All four children survived their parents.

==Death==
On November 12, 1990, Arden died at home at age 82. According to her death certificate, she died of cardiac arrest and arteriosclerotic heart disease. She is buried in the Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery, Westwood, Los Angeles, California.

==Legacy==
Arden published an autobiography, &quot;The Three Phases of Eve&quot;, in 1985. In addition to her Academy Award nomination, Arden has two stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame: Radio and Television (see List of stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for addresses). She was inducted into the National Radio Hall of Fame in 1995.

<doc id="10412" wikidata="Q824282" url="?curid=10412" title="Elementary function">
<text>In mathematics, an elementary function is a function of a single variable (typically real or complex) that is defined as taking sums, products, roots and compositions of finitely many polynomial, rational, trigonometric, hyperbolic, and exponential functions, and their inverses (e.g., arcsin, log, or &quot;x&quot;1/&quot;n&quot;).

All elementary functions are continuous on their domains.

Elementary functions were introduced by Joseph Liouville in a series of papers from 1833 to 1841. An algebraic treatment of elementary functions was started by Joseph Fels Ritt in the 1930s. Many textbooks and dictionaries do not give a precise definition of the elementary functions, and mathematicians differ on it.

== Examples ==

=== Basic examples ===
Elementary functions of a single variable include:
* Constant functions: formula_1 etc.
* Rational powers of: formula_2 etc.
* Exponential functions: formula_3
* Logarithms: formula_4
* Trigonometric functions: formula_5 etc.
* Inverse trigonometric functions: formula_6 etc.
* Hyperbolic functions: formula_7 etc.
* Inverse hyperbolic functions: formula_8 etc.
* All functions obtained by adding, subtracting, multiplying or dividing a finite number of any of the previous functions
* All functions obtained by root extraction of a polynomial with coefficients in elementary functions
* All functions obtained by composing a finite number of any of the previously listed functions

Certain elementary functions of a single complex variable , such as formula_9 and formula_10, may be multivalued. Additionally, certain classes of functions may be obtained by others using the final two rules. For example, the exponential function formula_11 composed with addition, subtraction, and division provides the hyperbolic functions, while initial composition with formula_12 instead provides the trigonometric functions.

=== Composite examples ===
Examples of elementary functions include:

* Addition, e.g. (+1)
* Multiplication, e.g. (2)
*Polynomial functions
*formula_13
*formula_14

The last function is equal to formula_15, the inverse cosine, in the entire complex plane.

All monomials, polynomials, rational functions and algebraic functions are elementary. 

The absolute value function, for real formula_16, is also elementary as it can be expressed as the composition of a power and root of formula_16: formula_18.

=== Non-elementary functions ===
Many mathematicians exclude non-analytic functions such as the absolute value function or discontinuous functions such as the step function, but others allow them. Some have proposed extending the set to include, for example, the Lambert W function.

Some examples of functions that are &quot;not&quot; elementary:

* tetration
* the gamma function
* non-elementary Liouvillian functions, including 
** the exponential integral (&quot;Ei&quot;), logarithmic integral (&quot;Li&quot; or &quot;li&quot;) and Fresnel integrals (&quot;S&quot; and &quot;C&quot;).
** the error function, formula_19 a fact that may not be immediately obvious, but can be proven using the Risch algorithm.
* other nonelementary integrals, including the Dirichlet integral and elliptic integral.

== Closure ==
It follows directly from the definition that the set of elementary functions is closed under arithmetic operations, root extraction and composition. The elementary functions are closed under differentiation. They are not closed under limits and infinite sums. Importantly, the elementary functions are closed under integration, as shown by Liouville&#x27;s theorem, see nonelementary integral. The Liouvillian functions are defined as the elementary functions and, recursively, the integrals of the Liouvillian functions.

==Differential algebra==

The mathematical definition of an elementary function, or a function in elementary form, is considered in the context of differential algebra. A differential algebra is an algebra with the extra operation of derivation (algebraic version of differentiation). Using the derivation operation new equations can be written and their solutions used in extensions of the algebra. By starting with the field of rational functions, two special types of transcendental extensions (the logarithm and the exponential) can be added to the field building a tower containing elementary functions.

A differential field &quot;F&quot; is a field &quot;F&quot;0 (rational functions over the rationals Q for example) together with a derivation map &quot;u&quot; → ∂&quot;u&quot;. (Here ∂&quot;u&quot; is a new function. Sometimes the notation &quot;u&quot;′ is used.) The derivation captures the properties of differentiation, so that for any two elements of the base field, the derivation is linear

: formula_20

and satisfies the Leibniz product rule

: formula_21

An element &quot;h&quot; is a constant if &quot;∂h = 0&quot;. If the base field is over the rationals, care must be taken when extending the field to add the needed transcendental constants.

A function &quot;u&quot; of a differential extension &quot;F&quot;[&quot;u&quot;] of a differential field &quot;F&quot; is an elementary function over &quot;F&quot; if the function &quot;u&quot;
* is algebraic over &quot;F&quot;, or
* is an exponential, that is, ∂&quot;u&quot; = &quot;u&quot; ∂&quot;a&quot; for &quot;a&quot; ∈ &quot;F&quot;, or
* is a logarithm, that is, ∂&quot;u&quot; = ∂&quot;a&quot; / a for &quot;a&quot; ∈ &quot;F&quot;.

<text>The Enchiridion or Handbook of Epictetus (, &quot;Enkheirídion Epiktḗtou&quot;) is a short manual of Stoic ethical advice compiled by Arrian, a 2nd-century disciple of the Greek philosopher Epictetus. Although the content is mostly derived from the &quot;Discourses of Epictetus&quot;, it is not a summary of the &quot;Discourses&quot; but rather a compilation of practical precepts. Eschewing metaphysics, Arrian focuses his attention on Epictetus&#x27;s work applying philosophy to daily life. Thus, the book is a manual to show the way to achieve mental freedom and happiness in all circumstances.

The &quot;Enchiridion&quot; was well known in the ancient world, and in the medieval period, it was specially adapted for use in Greek-speaking monasteries. In the 15th century it was translated into Latin, and then, with the advent of printing, into multiple European languages. It reached the height of popularity in the 17th century, in parallel with the Neostoicism movement.

==Title==
The word &quot;Enchiridion&quot; () is an adjective meaning &quot;in the hand&quot; or &quot;ready to hand&quot;. The word sometimes meant a handy sword, or dagger, but coupled with the word &quot;book&quot; (&quot;biblion&quot;, ) it means a handy book or hand-book. Epictetus in the &quot;Discourses&quot; often speaks of principles which his pupils should have &quot;ready to hand&quot; (). Common English translations of the title are Manual or Handbook.

==Writing==
The work consists of fifty-three short chapters typically consisting of a paragraph or two. It was compiled some time in the early 2nd century. The 6th-century philosopher Simplicius, in his &quot;Commentary&quot; on the work, refers to a letter written by Arrian which prefaced the text. In this letter Arrian stated that the &quot;Enchiridion&quot; was selected from the &quot;Discourses of Epictetus&quot; according to what he considered to be most useful, most necessary, and most adapted to move people&#x27;s minds. Around half of the material in the &quot;Enchiridion&quot; has been shown to have been derived from the surviving four books of &quot;Discourses&quot; but variously modified. Other parts are presumed to be derived from the lost &quot;Discourses&quot;. Some chapters appear to be reformulations of ideas which appear throughout the &quot;Discourses&quot;.

There are some puzzles concerning the inclusion of two chapters. Chapter 29 is practically word for word identical with &quot;Discourse&quot; iii. 15. Since it was omitted in one of the early Christian editions (&quot;Par&quot;), and not commented on by Simplicius, it may not have been in the original edition. Chapter 33 consists of a list of moral instructions, which are &quot;not obviously related to Epictetus&#x27; normal Stoic framework.&quot;

The current division of the work into fifty-three chapters was first adopted by Johann Schweighäuser in his 1798 edition; earlier editions tended to divide the text into more chapters (especially splitting chapter 33). Gerard Boter in his 1999 critical edition keeps Schweighäuser&#x27;s fifty-three chapters but splits chapters 5, 14, 19, and 48 into two parts.

==Contents==
The &quot;Enchiridion&quot; appears to be a loosely-structured selection of maxims. In his 6th-century &quot;Commentary&quot;, Simplicius divided the text into four distinct sections suggesting a graded approach to philosophy:

# Chapters 1–21. What is up to us and not, and how to deal with external things.
## Chs 1–2. What is up to us and not, and the consequences of choosing either.
## Chs 3–14. How to deal with external things (reining the reader in from them).
## Chs 15–21. How to use external things correctly and without disturbance.
# Chapters 22–28. Advice for intermediate students.
## Chs 22–25. The problems faced by intermediate students.
## Chs 26–28. Miscellania: the common conceptions, badness, and shame.
# Chapters 30–47. Technical advice for the discovery of appropriate actions (&quot;kathēkonta&quot;).
## Chs 30–33. Appropriate actions towards (a) other people, (b) God, (c) divination, (d) one&#x27;s own self.
## Chs 34–47. Miscellaneous precepts on justice (right actions).
# Chapters 48–53. Conclusions on the practice of precepts.
## Ch 48. Final advice and his division of types of people.
## Chs 49–52. The practice of precepts.
## Ch 53. Quotations for memorisation.

Chapter 29, which was probably absent from the text used by Simplicius, is a one-page &quot;Discourse&quot; which compares the training needed to become a Stoic with the rigorous approach needed to become an Olympic victor.

==Themes==
The &quot;Enchiridion&quot; begins with the statement, &quot;Of things, some depend upon ourselves, others do not depend upon ourselves.&quot; So it starts with announcing that the business and concern of the real self is with matters subject to its own control, uninfluenced by external chance or change. Epictetus makes a sharp distinction between our own internal world of mental benefits and harms and the external world beyond our control. Freedom is to wish for nothing which is not up to ourselves. When we are tried by misfortune, we should never let our suffering overwhelm our sense of inward mastery and freedom.

A constant vigilance is required, and one should never relax attention to one&#x27;s reason, for it is judgements, not things, which disturb people.

Reason is the decisive principle in everything. Thus, we must exercise our power of assent over impressions and wish for nothing, nor avoid anything that is up to other people.

To a large extent, the &quot;Enchiridion&quot; suppresses many of the more amiable aspects of Epictetus, which can be found in the &quot;Discourses&quot;, but this reflects the nature of the compilation. Some believe that, unlike the &quot;Discourses&quot; which seeks to encourage the student through argument and logic, the &quot;Enchiridion&quot; largely consists of a set of rules to follow. Others challenge this view, arguing that the chapters of the &quot;Enchiridion&quot; can be interpreted as containing arguments and articulating concepts that develop progressively throughout the work. The work is built on the conception that the wise person, by the aid of philosophy, may reap benefit from every experience in life. With proper training the student can flourish in adverse situations as well as favorable ones. The human spirit has capacities as yet undeveloped, but which it is for our good to develop. Thus, the book is a manual on how to make progress towards what is necessary and sufficient for happiness.

Epictetus makes vivid use of imagery, and analogies include life depicted as: a ship&#x27;s voyage (Ch. 7), an inn (Ch. 11), a banquet (Chs. 15, 36), and acting in a play (Ch. 17, 37). He takes many examples from everyday life, including: a broken jug (Ch. 3), a trip to the baths (Chs. 4, 43), his own lameness (Ch. 9), the loss of a child (Ch. 11), and the price of lettuce (Ch. 25).

==Subsequent history==

For many centuries, the &quot;Enchiridion&quot; maintained its authority both with Pagans and Christians. Simplicius of Cilicia wrote a commentary upon it in the 6th century, and in the Byzantine era Christian writers wrote paraphrases of it. Over one hundred manuscripts of the &quot;Enchiridion&quot; survive. The oldest extant manuscripts of the authentic &quot;Enchiridion&quot; date from the 14th century, but the oldest Christianised ones date from the 10th and 11th centuries, perhaps indicating the Byzantine world&#x27;s preference for the Christian versions. The &quot;Enchiridion&quot; was first translated into Latin by Niccolò Perotti in 1450, and then by Angelo Poliziano in 1479.

The first printed edition (&quot;editio princeps&quot;) was Poliziano&#x27;s Latin translation published in 1497. The original Greek was first published (somewhat abbreviated) with Simplicius&#x27;s &quot;Commentary&quot; in 1528. The edition published by Johann Schweighäuser in 1798 was the major edition for the next two-hundred years. A critical edition was produced by Gerard Boter in 1999.

The separate editions and translations of the &quot;Enchiridion&quot; are very many. The &quot;Enchiridion&quot; reached its height of popularity in the period 1550–1750. It was translated into most European languages, and there were multiple translations in English, French, and German. The first English translation was by James Sandford in 1567 (a translation of a French version) and this was followed by a translation (from the Greek) by John Healey in 1610. The &quot;Enchiridion&quot; was even partly translated into Chinese by the Jesuit missionary Matteo Ricci. The popularity of the work was assisted by the Neostoicism movement initiated by Justus Lipsius in the 16th century. Another Neostoic, Guillaume du Vair, translated the book into French in 1586 and popularised it in his &quot;La Philosophie morale des Stoiques&quot;.

In the English-speaking world it was particularly well known in the 17th century: at that time it was the &quot;Enchiridion&quot; rather than the &quot;Discourses&quot; which was usually read. It was among the books John Harvard bequeathed to the newly founded Harvard College in 1638. The work, being written in a clear distinct style, made it accessible to readers with no formal training in philosophy, and there was a wide readership among women in England. The writer Mary Wortley Montagu made her own translation of the &quot;Enchiridion&quot; in 1710 at the age of twenty-one. The &quot;Enchiridion&quot; was a common school text in Scotland during the Scottish Enlightenment—Adam Smith had a 1670 edition in his library, acquired as a schoolboy. At the end of the 18th century, the &quot;Enchiridion&quot; is attested in the personal libraries of Benjamin Franklin and Thomas Jefferson.

In the 19th century, Walt Whitman discovered the &quot;Enchiridion&quot; when he was about the age of sixteen. It was a book he would repeatedly return to, and late in life he called the book &quot;sacred, precious to me: I have had it about me so long—lived with it in terms of such familiarity.&quot;

==The &quot;Commentary&quot; of Simplicius==
In the 6th century the Neoplatonist philosopher Simplicius wrote a huge commentary on the &quot;Enchiridion&quot;, which is more than ten times the bulk of the original text. Chapter after chapter of the &quot;Enchiridion&quot; is dissected, discussed, and its lessons drawn out with a certain laboriousness. Simplicius&#x27; commentary offers a distinctly Platonist vision of the world, one which is often at odds with the Stoic content of the &quot;Enchiridion&quot;. Sometimes Simplicius exceeds the scope of a commentary; thus his commentary on &quot;Enchiridion&quot; 27 (Simplicius ch. 35) becomes a refutation of Manichaeism.

The &quot;Commentary&quot; enjoyed its own period of popularity in the 17th and 18th centuries. An English translation by George Stanhope in 1694 ran through four editions in the early 18th century. Edward Gibbon remarked in his &quot;Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire&quot; that Simplicius&#x27; &quot;Commentary&quot; on Epictetus &quot;is preserved in the library of nations, as a classic book&quot; unlike the commentaries on Aristotle &quot;which have passed away with the fashion of the times.&quot;

==Christian adaptations==
The &quot;Enchiridion&quot; was adapted three different times by Greek Christian writers. The oldest manuscript, &quot;Paraphrasis Christiana&quot; (&quot;Par&quot;), dates to the 10th century. Another manuscript, falsely ascribed to Nilus (&quot;Nil&quot;), dates to the 11th century. A third manuscript, Vaticanus gr. 2231 (&quot;Vat&quot;), dates to the 14th century. It is not known when the original versions of these manuscripts were first made.

These guides served as a rule and guide for monastic life. The most obvious changes are in the use of proper names: thus the name Socrates is sometimes changed to Paul. All three texts follow the &quot;Enchiridion&quot; quite closely, although the &quot;Par&quot; manuscript is more heavily modified: adding or omitting words, abridging or expanding passages, and occasionally inventing new passages.

In the 17th century the German monk Matthias Mittner did something similar, compiling a guide on mental tranquillity for the Carthusian Order by taking the first thirty-five of his fifty precepts from the &quot;Enchiridion&quot;.

==Notes==

a. Gerard Boter in his 1999 critical edition catalogues 59 extant manuscripts of the &quot;Encheiridion&quot; proper, and another 27 manuscripts of Simplicius&#x27; &quot;Commentary&quot; which contain the &quot;Encheiridion&quot; as &quot;lemmata&quot; (headings). He also lists 37 Christianised manuscripts, (24 &quot;Par&quot;, 12 &quot;Nil&quot;, 1 &quot;Vat&quot;). Cf.

<doc id="10415" wikidata="Q329792" url="?curid=10415" title="Emperor Kinmei">
<text>was the 29th emperor of Japan, according to the traditional order of succession. His reign is said to have spanned the years from 539 to 571. Most historians support either the view that Kinmei is the first historically verifiable Japanese emperor or the view that Yuryaku (the 21st) is.

==Traditional narrative==
Kinmei&#x27;s contemporary title would not have been &quot;tennō&quot;, as most historians believe this title was not introduced until the reigns of Emperor Tenmu and Empress Jitō. Rather, it was presumably , meaning &quot;the great king who rules all under heaven&quot;. Alternatively, Kinmei might have been referred to as or the &quot;Great King of Yamato&quot;.

===Events of Kinmei&#x27;s life===
Because of several chronological discrepancies in the account of Emperor Kinmei in the &quot;Nihon Shoki&quot;, some believe that he was actually ruling a rival court to that of Emperors Ankan and Senka. Nevertheless, according to the traditional account, it was not until the death of Emperor Kinmei&#x27;s older brother Emperor Senka that he gained the throne.

According to this account, Emperor Senka died in 539 at the age of 73; and succession passed to the third son of Emperor Keitai. This Imperial Prince was the next youngest brother of Emperor Senka. He would come to be known as Emperor Kinmei. He established his court at in Yamato.

The Emperor&#x27;s chief counselors were:
* &quot;Ōomi&quot; (Great Imperial chieftain): Soga no Iname no Sukune, also known as Soga no Iname.
* &quot;Ōmuraji&quot; (Great Deity chieftain): Monotobe Okoshi no Muraji, also known as Mononobe no Okoshi.
* &quot;Ōmuraji&quot; (Great Deity chieftain): Ōtomo Kanamura Maro, also known as Otomo no Kanamura.

Although the imperial court was not moved to the Asuka region of Japan until 592, Emperor Kinmei&#x27;s rule is considered by some to be the beginning of the Asuka period of Yamato Japan, particularly by those who associate the Asuka period primarily with the introduction of Buddhism to Japan from Baekje.

According to the &quot;Nihon Shoki&quot;, Emperor Kinmei received a bronze statue of Gautama Buddha as a gift from the king of Baekje King Song Myong (聖明王, &quot;Seimei Ō&quot;) along with a significant envoy of artisans, monks, and other artifacts in 552. (However, according to the Jōgū Shōtoku Hōō Teisetsu, Buddhism was introduced in 538.) This episode is widely regarded as the official introduction of Buddhism to the country.

With the introduction of a new religion to the court, a deep rift developed between the Mononobe clan, whose members supported the worship of Japan&#x27;s traditional deities, and the Soga clan, whose members supported the adoption of Buddhism.

According to the &quot;Nihon Shoki&quot;, Emperor Kinmei ruled until his death in 571 and was buried in the . An alternate stronger theory holds that he was actually buried in the , located in .

The Emperor is traditionally venerated at a memorial Shinto shrine (&quot;misasagi&quot;) at Nara. The Imperial Household Agency designates the Nara location as Kinmei&#x27;s mausoleum. It is formally named &quot;Hinokuma no saki Ai no misasagi&quot;. However, the actual sites of the graves of the early Emperors are unclear, according to some historians and archaeologists.

==Genealogy==
Emperor Kinmei&#x27;s father was Emperor Keitai and his mother was Emperor Ninken&#x27;s daughter, . In his lifetime, he was known by the name .

Kinmei had six Consorts and 25 Imperial children (16 sons and 9 daughters). According to Nihongi, he had six wives, but the &quot;Kojiki&quot; gives only five wives; identifying the third consort to be the same as the sixth one. The first three were his nieces, daughters of his half-brother Emperor Senka; two others were sisters, daughters of the Omi Soga no Iname.

<doc id="10416" wikidata="Q316637" url="?curid=10416" title="Emperor Bidatsu">
<text>was the 30th emperor of Japan, according to the traditional order of succession.

The years of reign of Bidatsu start in 572 and end in 585; however, there are no certain dates for this emperor&#x27;s life or reign. The names and sequence of the early emperors were not confirmed as &quot;traditional&quot; until the reign of Emperor Kanmu, who was the 50th monarch of the imperial dynasty.

==Traditional narrative==
Historians consider details about the life of Emperor Bidatsu to be possibly legendary, but probable. The name Bidatsu&quot;-tennō&quot; was created for him posthumously by later generations.

In the &quot;Nihon Shoki&quot;, he is called .

His palace in Yamato Province was called Osada no Miya of Iware.

==Events of Bidatsu&#x27;s life==
In the 15th year of Emperor Kinmei’s reign, Bidatsu was named Crown Prince.

In the , the old Emperor died, and the succession was received by his second son. Soon after, Emperor Bidatsu is said to have acceded to the throne.

Bidatsu&#x27;s contemporary title would not have been &quot;tennō&quot;, as most historians believe this title was not introduced until the reigns of Emperor Tenmu and Empress Jitō. Rather, it was presumably , meaning &quot;the great king who rules all under heaven&quot;. Alternatively, Bidatsu might have been referred to as or the &quot;Great King of Yamato&quot;.

Bidatsu&#x27;s reign was marked by power struggles about Buddhism. The two most important men in the court of Bidatsu were Soga no Umako and Mononobe no Moriya. Soga supported the growth of Buddhism, and Moriya wanted to stop it.

Bidatsu sought to re-establish relations with Korean Kingdoms and, according to &quot;Nihon Shoki&quot;, his court successfully established relations with Baekje and Silla, two of the Three Kingdoms of Korea.

The Emperor died from a disease which afflicted him with sores, apparently the first royal victim of smallpox in Japan.

The actual site of Bidatsu&#x27;s grave is known. The Emperor is traditionally venerated at a memorial Shinto shrine (&quot;misasagi&quot;) at Osaka.

The Imperial Household Agency designates this location as Bidatsu&#x27;s mausoleum. It is formally named &quot;Kawachi no Shinaga no naka no o no misasagi&quot;.

==Genealogy==
He was the second son of Emperor Kinmei. His mother, Ishi-hime, was a daughter of Emperor Senka.

Although he had many children, none of them would ever become Emperor. According to &quot;Gukanshō&quot;, Bidatsu had four empresses and 16 Imperial children (6 sons and 10 daughters).

Bidatsu&#x27;s first empress, Hirohime, died in the fifth year of his reign. To replace her, he elevated one of his consorts, Princess Nukatabe, to the rank of empress. Nukatabe was his half-sister by their father Kinmei. Later she ascended to the throne in her own right and is today known as Empress Suiko.

He was succeeded first by one of his brothers, Emperor Yōmei, then by another, Emperor Sushun, and then Empress Suiko, his sister and wife, before his grandson, Emperor Jomei, eventually took the throne.

<doc id="10417" wikidata="Q349281" url="?curid=10417" title="Emperor Yōmei">
<text>was the 31st Emperor of Japan, according to the traditional order of succession.

Yōmei&#x27;s reign spanned the years from 585 until his death in 587.

==Traditional narrative==
He was called in the &quot;Kojiki&quot;. He was also referred to as and after the palace in which he lived. He acceded to the throne after the death of his half brother, Emperor Bidatsu.

The influential courtiers from Emperor Bidatsu&#x27;s reign, Mononobe no Moriya, also known as Mononobe Yuge no Moriya no Muraji or as Ō-muraji Yuge no Moriya, and Soga no Umako no Sukune, both remained in their positions during the reign of Emperor Yōmei. Umako was the son of Soga Iname no Sukune, and therefore, he would have been one of Emperor Yōmei&#x27;s cousins.

* 585: In the , he died; and the succession was received by his younger brother. Shortly thereafter, Emperor Yōmei is said to have acceded to the throne.

Yōmei&#x27;s contemporary title would not have been &quot;tennō&quot;, as most historians believe this title was not introduced until the reigns of Emperor Tenmu and Empress Jitō. Rather, it was presumably , meaning &quot;the great king who rules all under heaven&quot;. Alternatively, Yōmei might have been referred to as or the &quot;Great King of Yamato&quot;.

Emperor Yōmei&#x27;s reign lasted only two years; and he died at the age of 46 or 47.

* 587, in the 4th month: Yōmei died and his body was placed in a coffin, but not buried.
* 587, in the 5th month: Armed conflict over the succession erupted. Shintoist, anti-Buddhist forces of Yuge no Moriya no Muraji (also known as Ō-muraji Yuge no Moriya) battled unsuccessfully against the pro-Buddhist forces of Prince Shōtoku and Soga Umako no Sukune. The opposition to Buddhism was entirely destroyed.
* 587, in the 7th month: The body of former Emperor Yōmei was buried.

Because of the brevity of his reign, Emperor Yōmei was not responsible for any radical changes in policy, but his support of Buddhism created tension with supporters of Shinto who opposed its introduction. According to Nihon Shoki, Emperor Yomei believed both in Buddhism and Shinto. Moriya, the most influential supporter of Shinto, conspired with Emperor Yōmei&#x27;s brother, Prince Anahobe, and after Emperor Yomei&#x27;s death they made an abortive attempt to seize the throne. Although Emperor Yōmei is reported to have died from illness, this incident and the brevity of his reign have led some to speculate that he was actually assassinated by Moriya and Prince Anahobe.

The actual site of Yōmei&#x27;s grave is known. The Emperor is traditionally venerated at a memorial Shinto shrine (&quot;misasagi&quot;) at Osaka.

The Imperial Household Agency designates this location as Yōmei&#x27;s mausoleum. It is formally named &quot;Kōchi no Shinaga no hara no misasagi&quot;.

==Genealogy==
Emperor Yōmei was the fourth son of Emperor Kinmei and his mother was Soga no Kitashihime, a daughter of Soga no Iname.

In 586, Emperor Yōmei took his half-sister , whose mother was another of Iname&#x27;s daughters, Soga no Oane Hime, as his consort. Princess Hashihito no Anahobe bore him four sons.

<text>was the 32nd Emperor of Japan, according to the traditional order of succession.

Sushun&#x27;s reign spanned the years from 587 through 592.

==Traditional narrative==
Before his ascension to the Chrysanthemum Throne, his personal name (his &quot;imina&quot;) was Hatsusebe&quot;-shinnō&quot;, also known as Hatsusebe no Waka-sazaki.

His name at birth was . He was the twelfth son of Emperor Kinmei. His mother was , a daughter of Soga no Iname, who was the chief, or Ōomi, of the Soga clan.

He succeeded his half-brother, Emperor Yōmei in 587, and lived in the Kurahashi Palace (Kurahashi no Miya) in Yamato.

* 587: In the , the Emperor died, and despite a dispute over who should follow him as sovereign, the succession was received by another son of Emperor Kinmei, one of Yōmei&#x27;s younger brothers. Shortly thereafter, Emperor Sushun is said to have acceded to the throne.

Sushun&#x27;s contemporary title would not have been &quot;tennō&quot;, as most historians believe this title was not introduced until the reigns of Emperor Tenmu and Empress Jitō. Rather, it was presumably , meaning &quot;the great king who rules all under heaven&quot;. Alternatively, Sushun might have been referred to as or the &quot;Great King of Yamato&quot;.

He came to the throne with the support of the Soga clan and Empress Suiko, his half sister and the widow of Emperor Bidatsu. Initially, the Mononobe clan, a rival clan of the Sogas, allied with , another son of Kimmei, and attempted to have him installed as Emperor. At the Battle of Shigisan, Soga no Umako, who succeeded his father as Ōomi of the Soga clan, eventually killed Mononobe no Moriya, the head of the Mononobe clan, which led to its decline. Umako then installed Emperor Sushun on the throne.

As time went on, Sushun eventually became resentful of Umako&#x27;s power, and wanted him deposed. It is said that one day, he killed a wild boar and stated, &quot;As I have slain this boar, so would I slay the one I despise&quot;. This angered Soga no Umako and, perhaps out of fear of being struck first, Umako hired to assassinate Sushun in 592.

Emperor Sushun&#x27;s reign lasted for five years before his death at the age of 72.

The actual site of Sushun&#x27;s grave is known. The Emperor is traditionally venerated at a memorial Shinto shrine (&quot;misasagi&quot;) at Nara.

The Imperial Household Agency designates this location as Yōmei&#x27;s mausoleum. It is formally named &quot;Kurahashi no oka no e no misasagi&quot;.

==Genealogy==
Sushun had two consorts and three Imperial children.

*Consort (&quot;Hi&quot;) : , Otomo-no-Nukateko&#x27;s daughter

*Beauty (&quot;Hin&quot;) : , Soga no Umako&#x27;s daughter

<doc id="10419" wikidata="Q298057" url="?curid=10419" title="Empress Suiko">
<text>(554 – 15 April 628) was the 33rd monarch of Japan, and the country&#x27;s first and longest-reigning empress regnant, according to the traditional order of succession.

Suiko reigned from 593 until her death in 628.

==Traditional narrative==
Before her ascension to the Chrysanthemum Throne, her personal name (her &quot;imina&quot;) was Mikekashiya-hime-no-mikoto, also Toyomike Kashikiya hime no Mikoto.

Empress Suiko had several names including Princess Nukatabe and (possibly posthumously) Toyomike Kashikiya. She was a daughter of Emperor Kinmei. Her mother was Soga no Iname&#x27;s daughter, Soga no Kitashihime. Suiko was the younger sister of Emperor Yōmei.
===Biography===

Empress Suiko was a consort to her half-brother, Emperor Bidatsu, but after Bidatsu&#x27;s first wife died she became his official consort and was given the title Ōkisaki (official consort of the emperor). She bore eight children.

After Bidatsu&#x27;s death, Suiko&#x27;s brother, Emperor Yōmei, came to power for about two years before dying of illness. Upon Yōmei&#x27;s death, another power struggle arose between the Soga clan and the Mononobe clan, with the Sogas supporting Prince Hatsusebe and the Mononobes supporting . The Sogas prevailed once again and Prince Hatsusebe acceded to the throne as Emperor Sushun in 587. However, Sushun began to resent the power of Soga no Umako, the head of the Soga clan, and Umako, perhaps out of fear that Sushun might strike first, had him assassinated by in 592. When asked to accede to the throne to fill the power vacuum that subsequently developed, Suiko became the first of what would be several examples in Japanese history where a woman was chosen to accede to the throne to avert a power struggle.

* 593: In the 2nd year of Sushun&quot;-tennō&quot;″s reign (崇峻天皇二年), he died; and contemporary scholars then construed that the succession (&quot;senso&quot;) was received by the consort of former Emperor Bidatsu. Shortly thereafter, Empress Suiko is said to have ascended to the throne (&quot;sokui&quot;).

Suiko&#x27;s contemporary title would not have been &quot;tennō&quot;, as most historians believe this title was not introduced until the reigns of Emperor Tenmu and Empress Jitō. Rather, it was presumably &quot;Sumeramikoto&quot; or &quot;Amenoshita Shiroshimesu Ōkimi&quot; (治天下大王), meaning &quot;the great Queen who rules all under heaven&quot;. Alternatively, Suiko might have been referred to as (ヤマト大王/大君) or the &quot;Great Queen of Yamato&quot;.

Prince Shōtoku was appointed regent the following year. Although political power during Suiko&#x27;s reign is widely viewed as having been wielded by Prince Shōtoku and Soga no Umako, Suiko was far from powerless. The mere fact that she survived and her reign endured suggests she had significant political skills.

In 599, an earthquake destroyed buildings throughout Yamato Province in what is now Nara Prefecture.

Suiko&#x27;s refusal to grant Soga no Umako&#x27;s request that he be granted the imperial territory known as Kazuraki no Agata in 624 is cited as evidence of her independence from his influence. Some of the many achievements under Empress Suiko&#x27;s reign include the official recognition of Buddhism by the issuance of the Flourishing Three Treasures Edict in 594. Suiko was also one of the first Buddhist monarchs in Japan, and had taken the vows of a nun shortly before becoming empress.

The reign of this empress was marked by the opening of relations with the Sui court in 600, the adoption of the Twelve Level Cap and Rank System in 603 and the adoption of the Seventeen-article constitution in 604.

The adoption of the Sexagenary cycle calendar (&quot;Jikkan Jūnishi&quot;) in Japan is attributed to Empress Suiko in 604.

At a time when imperial succession was generally determined by clan leaders rather than the emperor, Suiko left only vague indications of succession to two candidates while on her deathbed. One, Prince Tamura, was a grandson of Emperor Bidatsu and was supported by the main line of Sogas, including Soga no Emishi. The other, Prince Yamashiro, was a son of Prince Shōtoku and had the support of some lesser members of the Soga clan. After a brief struggle within the Soga clan in which one of Prince Yamashiro&#x27;s main supporters was killed, Prince Tamura was chosen and he acceded to the throne as Emperor Jomei in 629.

Empress Suiko ruled for 35 years. Although there were seven other reigning empresses, their successors were most often selected from amongst the males of the paternal Imperial bloodline, which is why some conservative scholars argue that the women&#x27;s reigns were temporary and that male-only succession tradition must be maintained in the 21st century. Empress Genmei, who was followed on the throne by her daughter, Empress Genshō, remains the sole exception to this conventional argument.
The actual site of Suiko&#x27;s grave is known. This empress is traditionally venerated at a memorial Shinto shrine (&quot;misasagi&quot;) at Osaka.

The Imperial Household Agency designates this location as Suiko&#x27;s mausoleum. It&#x27;s formally named &quot;Shinaga no Yamada no misasagi&quot;.

==Beginning of historical writing in Japan==
Sinologist Wm. Theodore de Bary believed that it was not until the reign of Suiko that &quot;consciously written [Japanese] history becomes a reality&quot;. He noted the name Suiko can be translated to &quot;conjecture of the past&quot;, suggesting that this posthumous title was &quot;bestowed on the empress because the writing of history was considered to be an outstanding achievement of her reign&quot;. He commented that &quot;little of the material from the ancient Japanese past can be taken seriously&quot; and the earliest extant Japanese annals were the &quot;Kojiki&quot; and the &quot;Nihon Shoki&quot;, which both date to the 8th century.

==Spouse and children==
Empress Suiko, born as Princess Nukatabe (額田部皇女), was the daughter of Emperor Kinmei and his consort (Hi), Soga no Kitashihime. Princess Nukatabe had five full sisters and seven full brothers among which the eldest would become Emperor Yōmei.

She married her eldest half-brother, Prince Nunakura Futotama-Shiki, born by her father&#x27;s legal wife and empress consort. The couple had eight children but none would ascend the throne.

<doc id="10421" wikidata="Q235296" url="?curid=10421" title="Empress Kōgyoku">
<text>, also known as , was the 35th and 37th monarch of Japan, according to the traditional order of succession. Both her reigns were within the Asuka period.
Kōgyoku&#x27;s reign spanned the years from 642 to 645. Her reign as Saimei encompassed 655 to 661. In other words, 
* 642: She ascended the throne as Kōgyoku&quot;-tennō&quot;, and she stepped down in response to the assassination of Soga no Iruka (see: Isshi incident).
* 645: She abdicated in favor of her brother, who would become known as Emperor Kōtoku.
* 654: Kōtoku died and the throne was vacant.
* 655: She re-ascended, beginning a new reign as Saimei&quot;-tennō&quot;.
* 661: Saimei ruled until her death caused the throne to be vacant again.
The two reigns of this one woman spanned the years from 642 through 661.

In the history of Japan, Kōgyoku/Saimei was the second of eight women to take on the role of empress regnant. The sole female monarch before Kōgyoku/Saimei was Suiko&quot;-tennō&quot;. The six female sovereigns reigning after Kōgyoku/Saimei were Jitō, Genmei, Genshō, Kōken/Shōtoku, Meishō, and Go-Sakuramachi.

==Traditional narrative==
Before her ascension to the Chrysanthemum Throne, her personal name (&quot;imina&quot;) was . As empress, her name would have been .

Princess Takara (&quot;Takara no miko&quot;) was a great-granddaughter of Emperor Bidatsu.
===Events in Kōgyoku&#x27;s reign===
During her first reign the Soga clan seized power. Her son Naka no Ōe planned a coup d&#x27;état and slew Soga no Iruka at the court in front of her throne. The Empress, shocked by this incident, abdicated the throne.

Kōgyoku&#x27;s contemporary title would not have been &quot;tennō&quot;, as most historians believe this title was not introduced until the reigns of Emperor Tenmu and Empress Jitō. Rather, it was presumably &quot;Sumeramikoto&quot; or &quot;Amenoshita Shiroshimesu Ōkimi&quot; (治天下大王), meaning &quot;the Great Queen who rules all under Heaven&quot;. Alternatively, Kōgyoku might have been referred to as (ヤマト大王/大君) or the &quot;Great Queen of Yamato&quot;.

Empress Kōgyoku reigned for four years. The years of Kōgyoku&#x27;s reign are not linked by scholars to any era or &quot;nengō&quot;. The Taika era innovation of naming time periods – &quot;nengō&quot; – was yet to be initiated during her son&#x27;s too-brief reign.

In this context, Brown and Ishida&#x27;s translation of &quot;Gukanshō&quot; offers an explanation about the years of Empress Jitō&#x27;s reign which muddies a sense of easy clarity in the pre-Taiho time-frame: 
:&quot;The eras that fell in this reign were: (1) the remaining seven years of Shuchō [(686+7=692?)]; and (2) Taika, which was four years long [695–698]. (The first year of this era was &quot;kinoto-hitsuji&quot; [695].) ... In the third year of the Taka era [697], Empress Jitō yielded the throne to the Crown Prince.&quot;

The years of Kōgyoku&#x27;s reign are not more specifically identified by more than one era name or &quot;nengō&quot; which was an innovation of Kōtoku&#x27;s brief reign.

===Events in Saimei&#x27;s reign===

When Kōtoku died, his designated heir was Naka no Ōe. When Naka no Ōe&#x27;s mother re-ascended, he continued in the role of her heir and crown prince. In this role, he could and did remain active in the political life of Japan.

In the fifth year of Saimei&#x27;s reign, Paekche in Korea was destroyed in 660. Japan assisted Paekche loyals in an attempt to aid the revival of Paekche dynasty. Early in 661, Saimei responded to the situation by leaving her capital in Yamato Province. Her plan was to lead a military expedition to Korea. The empress stayed in Ishiyu Temporary Palace in Iyo Province, today Dōgo Onsen. In May she arrived at Asakura Palace in the north part of Tsukushi province in Kyūshū, today a part of Fukuoka Prefecture. The allied army of Japan and Baekje was preparing for war against Silla, but the death of the empress thwarted those plans. In 661, Saimei died in the Asakura Palace before the army departed to Korea. In October her body was brought from Kyūshū by sea to Port Naniwa-zu (today Osaka city); and her state funeral was held in early November.

Empress Saimei ruled for seven years. The years of Saimei&#x27;s reign are not linked by scholars to any era or &quot;nengō&quot;. The Taika era innovation of naming time periods – &quot;nengō&quot; – languished until Mommu reasserted an imperial right by proclaiming the commencement of Taihō in 701.

The actual site of Kōgyoku/Saimei&#x27;s grave is known, having been identified as the Kengoshizuka tomb in the village of Asuka, Nara Prefecture. This empress is traditionally venerated at a memorial Shinto shrine (&quot;misasagi&quot;) at Nara.

The Imperial Household Agency designates this location as Kōgyoku/Seimei&#x27;s mausoleum. It is formally named &quot;Ochi-no-Okanoe no misasagi&quot;.

===&quot;Kugyō&quot;===
&quot;Kugyō&quot; (公卿) is a collective term for the very few most powerful men attached to the court of the Emperor of Japan in pre-Meiji eras.

In general, this elite group included only three to four men at a time. These were hereditary courtiers whose experience and background would have brought them to the pinnacle of a life&#x27;s career. During Kōgyoku&#x27;s reign, this apex of the &quot;Daijō-kan&quot; included:
* &quot;Sadaijin&quot;
* &quot;Udaijin&quot;

The &quot;kugyō&quot; during Saimei&#x27;s reign included:
* &quot;Sadaijin&quot;, Kose no Tokoda(巨勢徳太) (593–658), 649–658 
* &quot;Udaijin&quot; (not appointed)
* &quot;Naidaijin&quot; (内臣), Nakatomi no Kamako(中臣鎌子) (Fujiwara no Kamatari, 藤原鎌足) (614–669), 645–669 

==Spouses and children==
Empress Saimei, born Princess Takara, was the daughter of Prince Chinu, a grandson of Emperor Bidatsu, and his princess consort.

Firstly, she married Prince Takamuku and had a son. Secondly, the princess married Prince Toneri who also was Emperor Bidatsu&#x27;s grandson.The marriage produced one daughter and two sons who both ascended the throne in the future.
* First Husband: Prince Takamuku (高向王), Prince Tame&#x27;s son (also Emperor Yomei’s grandson)
** First Son: Prince Kara (漢皇子)
* Second Husband: Prince Tamura (田村皇子), later Emperor Jomei, Prince Oshisaka-no-hikohito-no-Ōe&#x27;s son (also Emperor Bidatsu&#x27;s grandson)
** Second Son: Prince Naka no Ōe (中大兄皇子) later Emperor Tenji)
** First Daughter: Princess Hashihito (間人皇女, d. 665), married Emperor Kōtoku
** Third Son: Prince Ōama (大海人皇子) later Emperor Tenmu

==Popular culture==

<doc id="10422" wikidata="Q317980" url="?curid=10422" title="Emperor Kōtoku">
<text>was the 36th emperor of Japan, according to the traditional order of succession.

The years of his reign lasted from 645 through 654.

==Traditional narrative==
Before Kōtoku&#x27;s ascension to the Chrysanthemum Throne, his personal name (&quot;imina&quot;) was or .

He was a descendant of Emperor Bidatsu. He was a son of Chinu no ōkimi (Prince Chinu, 茅渟王) by Kibitsuhime no ōkimi (Princess Kibitsuhime, 吉備姫王). Empress Kōgyoku was his elder sister from the same parents. Chinu was a son of Prince Oshisaka hikohito no ōe, whose father was the Emperor Bidatsu. He had at least three consorts including his Empress, Hashihito no Himemiko (Princess Hashihito), the daughter of Emperor Jomei and his sister Empress Kōgyoku. In the 3rd year of Kōgyoku&quot;-tennō&quot;″s reign (皇極天皇三年), the empress abdicated; and the succession (&quot;senso&quot;) was received by her younger brother. Shortly thereafter, Emperor Kōtoku is said to have acceded to the throne (&quot;sokui&quot;).

Kōtoku ruled from July 12, 645 (AD), until his death in 654. In 645, he ascended to the throne two days after Prince Naka no Ōe (Emperor Tenji) assassinated Soga no Iruka in the court of Kōgyoku. Kōgyoku abdicated in favor of her son and crown prince, Naka no Ōe, but Naka no Ōe insisted Kōtoku should ascend to the throne instead. Kōtoku&#x27;s contemporary title would not have been &quot;tennō&quot;, as most historians believe this title was not introduced until the reigns of Emperor Tenmu and Empress Jitō. Rather, it was presumably &quot;Sumeramikoto&quot; or &quot;Amenoshita Shiroshimesu Ōkimi&quot; (治天下大王), meaning &quot;the great king who rules all under heaven&quot;. Alternatively, Kōtoku might have been referred to as (ヤマト大王/大君) or the &quot;Great King of Yamato&quot;. According to the &quot;Nihonshoki&quot;, he was of gentle personality and was in favor of Buddhism.

In 645, he created a new city in the area called Naniwa, and moved the capital from Yamato Province to this new city (see Nara). The new capital had a seaport and was good for foreign trade and diplomatic activities. In 653, Kōtoku sent an envoy to the court of the Tang dynasty in China, but some of the ships were lost &quot;en route&quot;.

Naka no Ōe held the rank of crown prince and was the &quot;de facto&quot; leader of the government. In 653 Naka no Ōe proposed to move the capital again to Yamato province. Kōtoku denied. Naka no Ōe ignored the emperor&#x27;s policy and moved to the former province. Many courtiers of the court, including Empress Hashihito, followed him. Kōtoku was left in the palace. In the next year he died of an illness. After his death, Naka would not ascend to the throne. Instead, his mother and the sister of Kōtoku, the former Empress Kogyoku, ascended to the throne under another name, Empress Saimei.

He enacted the Taika Reform edicts. The system of &quot;hasshō kyakkan&quot; (eight ministries and a hundred offices) was first established during the reign of Emperor Kōtoku.
The actual site of Kōtoku&#x27;s grave is known. This emperor is traditionally venerated at a memorial Shinto shrine (&quot;misasagi&quot;) at Osaka. The Imperial Household Agency designates this location as Kōtoku&#x27;s mausoleum. It is formally named &quot;Ōsaka-no-shinaga no misasagi&quot;.

Traditionally the monk Hōdō, was born in today India, and traveled to Japan via Tang China and the Baekje kingdom in Korea. Hōdō cured an illness of the Emperor Kōtoku (596 – 654 AD), who then sent the monk to establish numerous Buddhist temples. According to legend Hōdō founded Tenjō-ji in 646 (AD). The monk is worshipped in the Gion faith.

===&quot;Kugyō&quot;===
&quot;Kugyō&quot; (公卿) is a collective term for the very few most powerful men attached to the court of the Emperor of Japan in pre-Meiji eras.

In general, this elite group included only three to four men at a time. These were hereditary courtiers whose experience and background would have brought them to the pinnacle of a life&#x27;s career. During Kōtoko&#x27;s reign, this apex of the &quot;Daijō-kan&quot; included: 
* &quot;Sadaijin&quot;, Abe no Kurahashi-maro (阿部倉梯麻呂) (d. 649), 645–649.
* &quot;Sadaijin&quot;, Kose no Tokoda (巨勢徳太) (593–658), 649–658.
* &quot;Udaijin&quot;, Soga no Kura-no-Yamada no Ishikawa-no-maro (蘇我倉山田石川麻呂) (d. 649), 645–649.
* &quot;Udaijin&quot;, Ōtomo no Nagatoko (大伴長徳) (d. 651), 649–651.
* &quot;Naidaijin&quot;(内臣), Nakatomi Kamako (中臣鎌子) (Fujiwara no Kamatari, 藤原鎌足) (614–669), 645–669.

==Eras of Kōtoku&#x27;s reign==
The years of Kōtoku&#x27;s reign are more specifically identified by more than one era name or &quot;nengō&quot;.
* &quot;Taika&quot; (645–650)
* &quot;Hakuchi&quot; (650–655)

==Consorts and children==
Empress: Princess Hashihito (間人皇女, d. 665), Emperor Jomei and Empress Kogyoku&#x27;s daughter

&quot;Hi&quot;: Abe no Otarashi-hime (阿部小足媛), Abe no Kurahashi-maro&#x27;s daughter
* Prince Arima (有間皇子, 640–658)

<doc id="10424" wikidata="Q314802" url="?curid=10424" title="Emperor Tenji">
<text>, known first as and later as until his accession, was the 38th emperor of Japan who reigned from 668 to 671. He was the son of Emperor Jomei and Empress Kōgyoku (Empress Saimei), and his children included Empress Jitō, Empress Genmei, and Emperor Kōbun.

In 645, Tenji and Fujiwara no Kamatari defeated Soga no Emishi and Iruka. He established a new government and carried out political reforms. He then assumed real political power as the crown prince of both the Kōtoku and Saimei Emperors. Despite the death of Emperor Saimei, he did not accede to the throne for seven years, and came to the throne after the relocation of the capital to Ōmi in 668. He created Japan&#x27;s first family register, the &quot;Kōgo Nenjaku&quot;, and the first code of law, the Ōmi Code.

==Traditional narrative==
He was the son of Emperor Jomei, but was preceded as ruler by his mother Empress Saimei.

Prior to his accession, he was known as .

===Events of Tenji&#x27;s life===
As prince, Naka no Ōe played a crucial role in ending the near-total control the Soga clan had over the imperial family. In 644, seeing the Soga continue to gain power, he conspired with Nakatomi no Kamatari and Soga no Kurayamada no Ishikawa no Maro to assassinate Soga no Iruka in what has come to be known as the Isshi Incident. Although the assassination did not go exactly as planned, Iruka was killed, and his father and predecessor, Soga no Emishi, committed suicide soon after. Following the Isshi Incident, Iruka&#x27;s adherents dispersed largely without a fight, and Naka no Ōe was named heir apparent. He also married the daughter of his ally Soga no Kurayamada, thus ensuring that a significant portion of the Soga clan&#x27;s power was on his side.

===Events of Tenji&#x27;s reign===
Naka no Ōe reigned as Emperor Tenji from 661 to 672.

* 661: In the , the empress designated her son as her heir; and modern scholars construe this as meaning that this son would have received the succession (&quot;senso&quot;) after her death or abdication. Shortly after, she died, and Emperor Tenji could be said to have acceded to the throne (&quot;sokui&quot;).
* 662: Tenji is said to have compiled the first Japanese legal code known to modern historians. The Ōmi Code, consisting of 22 volumes, was promulgated in the last year of Tenji&#x27;s reign. This legal codification is no longer extant, but it is said to have been refined in what is known as the Asuka Kiyomihara &quot;ritsu-ryō&quot; of 689; and these are understood to have been a forerunner of the Taihō &quot;ritsu-ryō&quot; of 701.
* 663: Tenji invaded Korea in an attempt to support a revival of Japan&#x27;s ally Paekche (one of Korea&#x27;s Three Kingdoms, which had been conquered by the Korean kingdom of Silla in 660) but was seriously defeated at the Battle of Baekgang by the combined forces of Silla and Tang China. 
* 668: An account in becomes the first mention of petrochemical oil in Japan. In the , flammable water (possibly petroleum) was presented as an offering to Emperor Tenji from Echigo Province (now known as a part of Niigata Prefecture). This presentation coincided with the emperor&#x27;s ceremonial confirmation as emperor. He had postponed formalities during the period that the mausoleum of his mother was being constructed; and when the work was finished, he could delay no longer. Up until this time, although he had been &quot;de facto&quot; monarch, he had retained the title of Crown Prince.
* 671: An account in Nihon Shoki becomes the first mention of public announcement of time by rōkoku (a kind of water clock) in Japan. In 660 also a mention of this kind of clock exists.

Tenji was particularly active in improving the military institutions which had been established during the Taika Reforms.

===Death of the emperor===

Following his death in 672, there ensued a succession dispute between his fourteen children (many by different mothers). In the end, he was succeeded by his son, Prince Ōtomo, also known as Emperor Kōbun, then by Tenji&#x27;s brother Prince Ōama, also known as Emperor Tenmu. Almost one hundred years after Tenji&#x27;s death, the throne passed to his grandson Emperor Kōnin.

:Post-Meiji chronology
:* In the 10th year of Tenji, in the 11th month (671): Emperor Tenji, in the , designated his son as his heir; and modern scholars construe this as meaning that the son would have received the succession (&quot;senso&quot;) after his father&#x27;s death. Shortly thereafter, Emperor Kōbun is said to have acceded to the throne (&quot;sokui&quot;). If this understanding were valid, then it would follow:
::* In the 1st year of Kōbun (672): Emperor Kōbun, in the 1st year of his reign (弘文天皇元年), died; and his uncle Ōaomi&quot;-shinnō&quot; received the succession (&quot;senso&quot;) after the death of his nephew. Shortly thereafter, Emperor Tenmu could be said to have acceded to the throne (&quot;sokui&quot;).

:Pre-Meiji chronology
:Prior to the 19th century, Ōtomo was understood to have been a mere interloper, a pretender, an anomaly; and therefore, if that commonly accepted understanding were to have been valid, then it would have followed:
:* In the 10th year of Tenji, in the 11th month (671): Emperor Tenji, in the , died; and despite any military confrontations which ensued, the brother of the dead sovereign would have received the succession (&quot;senso&quot;); and after a time, it would have been understood that Emperor Tenmu rightfully acceded to the throne (&quot;sokui&quot;).

The actual site of Tenji&#x27;s grave is known. This emperor is traditionally venerated at a memorial Shinto shrine (&quot;misasagi&quot;) at Yamashina-ku, Kyoto.

The Imperial Household Agency designates this location as Tenji&#x27;s mausoleum. It is formally named &quot;Yamashina no misasagi&quot;.

===Poetry===
The &quot;Man&#x27;yōshū&quot; includes poems attributed to emperors and empresses; and according to Donald Keene, evolving &quot;Man&#x27;yōshū&quot; studies have affected the interpretation of even simple narratives like &quot;The Three Hills.&quot; The poem was long considered to be about two male hills in a quarrel over a female hill, but scholars now consider that Kagu and Miminashi might be female hills in love with the same male hill, Unebi. This still-unresolved enigma in poetic form is said to have been composed by Emperor Tenji while he was still Crown Prince during the reign of Empress Saimei:

One of his poems was chosen by Fujiwara no Teika as the first in the popular &quot;Hyakunin Isshu&quot; anthology:

After his death, his wife, Empress Yamato wrote a song of longing about her husband.

===&quot;Kugyo&quot;===
The top during Emperor Tenji&#x27;s reign included:

* &quot;Daijō-daijin&quot;: , 671–672.
* &quot;Naishin&quot; (内臣): Fujiwara no Kamatari (藤原鎌足) (614–669), 645–669.

Prince Ōtomo (Ōtomo&quot;-shinnō&quot;) was the favorite son of Emperor Tenji; and he was also the first to be accorded the title of &quot;Daijō-daijin.&quot;

==Non&quot;-nengō&quot; period==
The years of Tenji&#x27;s reign are not linked by scholars to any era or &quot;nengō&quot;. The Taika era innovation of naming time periods – &quot;nengō&quot; – languished until Mommu reasserted an imperial right by proclaiming the commencement of Taihō in 701 (aside from the momentary proclamation of the Shuchō era under Emperor Tenmu in 686).
* See Japanese era name – &quot;Non-nengo periods&quot;
* See Tenji period (661).

In this context, Brown and Ishida&#x27;s translation of &quot;Gukanshō&quot; offers an explanation about the years of Empress Jitō&#x27;s reign which muddies a sense of easy clarity in the pre-Taiho time-frame:
::&quot;The eras that fell in this reign were: (1) the remaining seven years of Shuchō [(686+7=692?)]; and (2) Taika, which was four years long [695–698]. (The first year of this era was &quot;kinoto-hitsuji&quot; [695].)  ... In the third year of the Taka era [697], Empress Jitō yielded the throne to the Crown Prince.&quot;

<doc id="10425" wikidata="Q357242" url="?curid=10425" title="Emperor Kōbun">
<text>was the 39th emperor of Japan, according to the traditional order of succession.

Kōbun&#x27;s reign lasted only a few months in 672.

==Traditional narrative==
Emperor Kōbun was named the 39th emperor by the Meiji government in 1870; and since the late 19th century, he is known by the posthumous name accorded to him by Meiji scholars.

In his lifetime, he was known as Prince Ōtomo (大友皇子, &quot;Ōtomo no ōji&quot;). He was the favorite son of Emperor Tenji; and he was also the first to have been accorded the title of &quot;Daijō-daijin.&quot;

Now, Japanese Imperial Household Agency and minority of contemporary historians place the reign of Emperor Kōbun between the reigns of Emperor Tenji and Emperor Tenmu; but the &quot;Nihongi&quot;, the &quot;Gukanshō&quot;, the &quot;Jinnō Shōtōki&quot; and majority of contemporary historians do not recognize this reign. Prince Ōtomo was only given his posthumous title and name in 1870.

:Post-Meiji chronology
:* In the 10th year of Tenji, in the 11th month (671): Emperor Tenji, in the 10th year of his reign (天智天皇十年), designated his son as his heir; and modern scholars construe this as meaning that the son would have received the succession (&quot;senso&quot;) after his father&#x27;s death. Shortly thereafter, Emperor Kōbun is said to have acceded to the throne (&quot;sokui&quot;). If this understanding were valid, then it would follow:
::* In the 1st year of Kōbun (672): Emperor Kōbun, in the 1st year of his reign (弘文天皇元年), died; and his uncle Ōaomino ōji received the succession (&quot;senso&quot;) after the death of his nephew. Shortly thereafter, Emperor Tenmu could be said to have acceded to the throne (&quot;sokui&quot;).

:Pre-Meiji chronology
:Prior to the 19th century, Ōtomo was understood to have been a mere interloper, a pretender, an anomaly; and therefore, if that commonly accepted understanding were to have been valid, then it would have followed:
:* In the 10th year of Tenji, in the 11th month (671): Emperor Tenji, in the 10th year of his reign (天智天皇十年), died; and despite any military confrontations which ensued, the brother of the dead sovereign would have received the succession (&quot;senso&quot;); and after a time, it would have been understood that Emperor Tenmu rightfully acceded to the throne (&quot;sokui&quot;).
:Control of the throne was wrested by Emperor Tenchi&#x27;s brother, Prince Ōama, during the Jinshin War, after which Emperor Kōbun died by suicide. For centuries, the hapless Prince Ōtomo was not considered to have been a part of the traditional order of succession.

The actual site of Kōbun&#x27;s grave is known. This emperor is traditionally venerated at a memorial Shinto shrine (&quot;misasagi&quot;) at Shiga.

The Imperial Household Agency designates this location as Kōbun&#x27;s mausoleum. It is formally named &quot;Nagara no Yamasaki no misasagi&quot;.

==Non&quot;-nengō&quot; period==
The years of Kōbun&#x27;s reign are not linked by scholars to any era or &quot;nengō&quot;. The Taika era innovation of naming time periods – &quot;nengō&quot; – languished until Mommu reasserted an imperial right by proclaiming the commencement of Taihō in 701. 
* See Japanese era name – &quot;Non-nengo periods&quot;
* See Kōbun (period) (672).

In this context, Brown and Ishida&#x27;s translation of &quot;Gukanshō&quot; offers an explanation about the years of Empress Jitō&#x27;s reign which muddies a sense of easy clarity in the pre-Taiho time-frame: 
::&quot;The eras that fell in this reign were: (1) the remaining seven years of Shuchō [(686+7=692?)]; and (2) Taika, which was four years long [695–698]. (The first year of this era was &quot;kinoto-hitsuji&quot; [695].) ... In the third year of the Taka era [697], Empress Jitō yielded the throne to the Crown Prince.&quot;

===&quot;Kugyo&quot;===
The top during Emperor Kōbun&#x27;s reign included:
* &quot;Sadaijin&quot;, Soga no Akae (蘇我赤兄) (?–?), 672 (7 months)
* &quot;Udaijin&quot;, Nakatomi no Kane (中臣金) (d. 672), 672 (7 months)

==Consorts and children==
Consort: Princess Tōchi (十市皇女), Emperor Tenmu&#x27;s daughter
* First son: Prince Kadono (葛野王, 669–706)

Consort: Fujiwara no Mimimotoji (藤原耳面刀自), Fujiwara no Kamatari&#x27;s daughter
* Princess Ichishi-hime (壱志姫王)

Emperor Kōbun had another son named Prince Yota (興多王), whose mother is unknown.

<text>was the 40th Emperor of Japan, according to the traditional order of succession. He ascended to the throne following the Jinshin War, during which his army defeated that of Emperor Kōbun. Tenmu reigned from 673 until his death in 686, amid Hakuhō period or the late Asuka period. 

During his reign, Tenmu implemented political and military reforms, consolidating imperial power and centralizing governance. His foreign policy favored the Korean kingdom of Silla while severing diplomatic relations with the Tang dynasty of China. He used religious structures to bolster the imperial authority, building several Buddhist temples including Yakushi-ji and monasteries as well as strengthening ties with the Ise Shrine. He was succeeded by his wife, Empress Jitō.

==Traditional narrative==
Tenmu was the youngest son of Emperor Jomei and Empress Kōgyoku, and the younger brother of the Emperor Tenji. His name at birth was . He was succeeded by Empress Jitō, who was both his niece and his wife. During the reign of his elder brother, Emperor Tenji, Tenmu was forced to marry several of Tenji&#x27;s daughters because Tenji thought those marriages would help to strengthen political ties between the two brothers. The nieces he married included Princess Unonosarara, today known as Empress Jitō, and Princess Ōta. Tenmu also had other consorts whose fathers were influential courtiers.

Tenmu had many children, including his crown prince Kusakabe by Princess Unonosarara; Princess Tōchi; Prince Ōtsu and Princess Ōku by Princess Ōta (whose father also was Tenji); and Prince Toneri, the editor of the &quot;Nihon Shoki&quot; and father of Emperor Junnin. Through Prince Kusakabe, Tenmu had two emperors and two empresses among his descendants. Empress Kōken was the last of these imperial rulers from his lineage.

===Events of Tenmu&#x27;s life===
Emperor Tenmu is the first monarch of Japan, to whom the title &quot;Tennō&quot; (Emperor of Japan) was assigned contemporaneously—not only by later generations.

The only document on his life was &quot;Nihon Shoki&quot;. However, it was edited by his son, Prince Toneri, and the work was written during the reigns of his wife and children, causing one to suspect its accuracy and impartiality. He is also mentioned briefly in the preface to the &quot;Kojiki&quot;, being hailed as the emperor to have commissioned them.

Tenmu&#x27;s father died while he was young, and he grew up mainly under the guidance of Empress Saimei. He was not expected to gain the throne, because his brother Tenji was the crown prince, being the older son of their mother, the reigning empress.

During the Tenji period, Tenmu was appointed his crown prince. This was because Tenji had no appropriate heir among his sons at that time, as none of their mothers was of a rank high enough to give the necessary political support. Tenji was suspicious that Tenmu might be so ambitious as to attempt to take the throne, and felt the necessity to strengthen his position through politically advantageous marriages.

Tenji was particularly active in improving the military institutions which had been established during the Taika reforms.

In his old age, Tenji had a son, Prince Ōtomo, by a low-ranking consort. Since Ōtomo had weak political support from his maternal relatives, the general wisdom of the time held that it was not a good idea for him to ascend to the throne, yet Tenji was obsessed with the idea.

In 671 Tenmu felt himself to be in danger and volunteered to resign the office of crown prince to become a monk. He moved to the mountains in Yoshino, Yamato Province (now Yoshino, Nara), officially for reasons of seclusion. He took with him his sons and one of his wives, Princess Unonosarara, a daughter of Tenji. However, he left all his other consorts at the capital, Omikyō in Ōmi Province (today in Ōtsu).

A year later, (in 672) Tenji died and Prince Ōtomo ascended to the throne as Emperor Kōbun. Tenmu assembled an army and marched from Yoshino to the east, to attack the capital of Omikyō in a counterclockwise movement. They marched through Yamato, Iga and Mino Provinces to threaten Omikyō in the adjacent province. The army of Tenmu and the army of the young Emperor Kōbun fought in the northwestern part of Mino (nowadays Sekigahara, Gifu), an incident known as the Jinshin War. Tenmu&#x27;s army won and Kōbun committed suicide.

:Post-Meiji chronology
:* In the 10th year of Tenji, in the 11th month (671): Emperor Tenji, in the 10th year of his reign (天智天皇十年), designated his son as his heir; and modern scholars construe this as meaning that the son would have received the succession (&quot;senso&quot;) after his father&#x27;s death. Shortly thereafter, Emperor Kōbun is said to have acceded to the throne (&quot;sokui&quot;). If this understanding were valid, then it would follow:
::* In the 1st year of Kōbun (672): Emperor Kōbun, in the 1st year of his reign (弘文天皇一年), died; and his uncle Ōaomi&quot;-shinnō&quot; received the succession (&quot;senso&quot;) after the death of his nephew. Shortly thereafter, Emperor Tenmu could be said to have acceded to the throne (&quot;sokui&quot;).

:Pre-Meiji chronology
:Prior to the 19th century, Otomo was understood to have been a mere interloper, a pretender, an anomaly; and therefore, if that commonly accepted understanding were to have been valid, then it would have followed:
:* In the 10th year of Tenji, in the 11th month (671): Emperor Tenji, in the 10th year of his reign (天智天皇十年), died; and despite any military confrontations which ensued, the brother of the dead sovereign would have received the succession (&quot;senso&quot;); and after a time, it would have been understood that Emperor Tenmu rightfully acceded to the throne (&quot;sokui&quot;).

As might be expected, Emperor Tenmu was no less active than former-Emperor Tenji in improving the Taika military institutions. Tenmu&#x27;s reign brought many changes, such as: (1) a centralized war department was organized; (2) the defenses of the Inner Country near the Capital were strengthened; (3) forts and castles were built near Capital and in the western parts of Honshū—and in Kyushu; (4) troops were reviewed; and all provincial governors were ordered to complete the collection of arms and to study tactics.
In 673 Tenmu moved the capital back to Yamato on the Kiymihara plain, naming his new capital Asuka. The &quot;Man&#x27;yōshū&quot; includes a poem written after the Jinshin War ended:
At Asuka, Emperor Tenmu was enthroned. He elevated Unonosarara to be his empress. Events of his reign include:
* 674 (&quot;Tenmu 2&quot;): Ambassadors of &quot;Tane no kuni&quot; were received in the Japanese court.
* 680 (&quot;Tenmu 8&quot;): Yakushi-ji was founded in the Hakuhō period.

Tenmu reigned from this capital until his death in 686. His wife, Empress Jito became the emperor until their son became the 42nd Emperor. The actual site of his grave is known. This emperor is traditionally venerated at a memorial shrine (&quot;misasagi&quot;) in Nara Prefecture. The Imperial Household Agency designates this location as Tenmu&#x27;s mausoleum. It is formally named &quot;Hinokuma no Ōuchi no misasagi.&quot;

===Buddhism===
In 675 Emperor Tenmu banned the consumption of domesticated animal meat (horse, cattle, dogs, monkeys, birds), from April 1 to September 30 each year, due to the influence of Buddhism.

===Politics===

In the &quot;Nihon Shoki&quot;, Tenmu is described as a great innovator, but the neutrality of this description is doubtful, since the work was written under the control of his descendants. It seems clear, however, that Tenmu strengthened the power of the emperor and appointed his sons to the highest offices of his government, reducing the traditional influence of powerful clans such as the Ōtomo and Soga clans. He renewed the system of &quot;kabane&quot;, the hereditary titles of duty and rank, but with alterations, including the abolition of some titles. Omi and Muraji, the highest kabane in the earlier period, were reduced in value in the new hierarchy, which consisted of eight kinds of kabane. Each clan received a new kabane according to its closeness to the imperial bloodline and its loyalty to Tenmu.

Tenmu attempted to keep a balance of power among his sons. Once he traveled to Yoshino together with his sons, and there had them swear to cooperate and not to make war on each other. This turned out to be ineffective: one of his sons, Prince Ōtsu, was later executed for treason after the death of Tenmu.

Tenmu&#x27;s foreign policy favored the Korean kingdom Silla, which took over the entire Korean peninsula in 676. After the unification of Korea by Silla, Tenmu decided to break diplomatic relations with the Tang dynasty of China, evidently in order to keep on good terms with Silla.

Tenmu used religious structures to increase the authority of the imperial throne. During his reign there was increased emphasis on the tie between the imperial household and Ise Grand Shrine (dedicated to the ancestor goddess of the emperors, Amaterasu) by sending his daughter Princess Ōku as the newly established Saiō of the shrine, and several festivals were financed from the national budget. He also showed favor to Buddhism, and built several large temples and monasteries. It is said that Tenmu asked that each household was encouraged to build an altar with a dais where a Buddha-image and a sutra could be placed so that family worshiping could be held, thus inventing the butsudan. On the other hand, all Buddhist priests, monks and nuns were controlled by the state, and no one was allowed to become a monk without the state&#x27;s permission. This was aimed at preventing cults and stopping farmers from turning into priests.

====&quot;Kugyō&quot;====
&quot;Kugyō&quot; () is a collective term for the very few most powerful men attached to the court of the Emperor of Japan in pre-Meiji eras.

In general, this elite group included only three to four men at a time. These were hereditary courtiers whose experience and background would have brought them to the pinnacle of a life&#x27;s career. During Tenmu&#x27;s reign, this apex of the &quot;Daijō-kan&quot; included:
* &quot;Sadaijin&quot;, Soga no Akae no Omi 
* &quot;Udaijin&quot;, Nakatomi no Kane no Muraji 
* &quot;Naidaijin&quot;

==Era of Tenmu&#x27;s reign==
The years of Tenmu&#x27;s reign were marked by only one era name or &quot;nengō&quot;, which was proclaimed in the final months of the emperor&#x27;s life; and &quot;Shuchō&quot; ended with Tenmu&#x27;s death.
* &quot;Shuchō&quot; (686)

===Non&quot;-nengō&quot; period===
The early years of Tenmu&#x27;s reign are not linked by scholars to any era or &quot;nengō&quot;. The Taika era innovation of naming time periods – &quot;nengō&quot; – was discontinued during these years, but it was reestablished briefly in 686. The use of &quot;nengō&quot; languished yet again after Tenmu&#x27;s death until Emperor Monmu reasserted an imperial right by proclaiming the commencement of Taihō in 701.
* See Tenmu period (673–686).

In this context, Brown and Ishida&#x27;s translation of &quot;Gukanshō&quot; offers an explanation about the years of Empress Jitō&#x27;s reign which muddies a sense of easy clarity in the pre-Taihō time-frame:
::&quot;The eras that fell in this reign were: (1) the remaining seven years of Shuchō [(686+7=692?)]; and (2) Taika, which was four years long [695–698]. (The first year of this era was &quot;kinoto-hitsuji&quot; [695].) ... In the third year of the Taika era [697], Empress Jitō yielded the throne to the Crown Prince.&quot;

<doc id="10427" wikidata="Q232026" url="?curid=10427" title="Empress Jitō">
<text>was the 41st monarch of Japan, according to the traditional order of succession.

Jitō&#x27;s reign spanned the years from 686 through 697.

In the history of Japan, Jitō was the third of eight women to take on the role of empress regnant. The two female monarchs before Jitō were Suiko and Kōgyoku/Saimei. The five women sovereigns reigning after Jitō were Genmei, Genshō, Kōken/Shōtoku, Meishō, and Go-Sakuramachi.

==Traditional narrative==
Empress Jitō was the daughter of Emperor Tenji. Her mother was Ochi-no-Iratsume, the daughter of Minister Ō-omi Soga no Yamada-no Ishikawa Maro. She was the wife of Tenji&#x27;s full brother Emperor Tenmu, whom she succeeded on the throne.

Empress Jitō&#x27;s given name was , or alternately Uno.

===Events of Jitō&#x27;s reign===
Jitō took responsibility for court administration after the death of her husband, Emperor Tenmu, who was also her uncle. She acceded to the throne in 687 in order to ensure the eventual succession of her son, Kusakabe-shinnō. Throughout this period, Empress Jitō ruled from the Fujiwara Palace in Yamato. In 689, Jitō prohibited &quot;Sugoroku&quot;, in 690 at enthronement she performed special ritual then gave pardon and in 692 she travelled to Ise against the counsel of minister Miwa-no-Asono-Takechimaro.

Prince Kusakabe was named as crown prince to succeed Jitō, but he died at a young age. Kusakabe&#x27;s son, Karu-no-o, was then named as Jitō&#x27;s successor. He eventually would become known as Emperor Monmu.

Empress Jitō reigned for eleven years. Although there were seven other reigning empresses, their successors were most often selected from amongst the males of the paternal Imperial bloodline, which is why some conservative scholars argue that the women&#x27;s reigns were temporary and that male-only succession tradition must be maintained in the 21st century. Empress Genmei, who was followed on the throne by her daughter, Empress Genshō, remains the sole exception to this conventional argument.

In 697, Jitō abdicated in Monmu&#x27;s favor; and as a retired sovereign, she took the post-reign title &quot;daijō-tennō&quot;. After this, her imperial successors who retired took the same title after abdication.

Jitō continued to hold power as a cloistered ruler, which became a persistent trend in Japanese politics.
The actual site of Jitō&#x27;s grave is known. This empress is traditionally venerated at a memorial Shinto shrine (&quot;misasagi&quot;) at Nara.

The Imperial Household Agency designates this location as Jitō&#x27;s mausoleum. It is formally named &quot;Ochi-no-Okanoe no misasagi&quot;.

===&quot;Kugyō&quot;===
&quot;Kugyō&quot; (公卿) is a collective term for the very few most powerful men attached to the court of the Emperor of Japan in pre-Meiji eras.

In general, this elite group included only three to four men at a time. These were hereditary courtiers whose experience and background would have brought them to the pinnacle of a life&#x27;s career. During Jitō&#x27;s reign, this apex of the &quot;Daijō-kan&quot; included:
* &quot;Daijō-daijin&quot;, Takechi-shinnō (the 3rd son of Emperor Tenmu)
* &quot;Sadaijin&quot;
* &quot;Udaijin&quot;
* &quot;Naidaijin&quot;

==Non&quot;-nengō&quot; period==
Jitō&#x27;s reign is not linked by scholars to any era or nengō. The Taika era innovation of naming time periods – &quot;nengō&quot; – languished until Mommu reasserted an imperial right by proclaiming the commencement of Taihō in 701.
* See Japanese era name – &quot;Non-nengo periods&quot;
* See Jitō period (687–697).

However, Brown and Ishida&#x27;s translation of &quot;Gukanshō&quot; offers an explanation which muddies a sense of easy clarity:
:&quot;The eras that fell in this reign were: (1) the remaining seven years of Shuchō [(686+7=692?)]; and (2) Taika, which was four years long [695–698]. (The first year of this era was &quot;kinoto-hitsuji&quot; [695].) ... In the third year of the Taka era [697], Empress Jitō yielded the throne to the Crown Prince.&quot;

== Family ==
Empress Jitō, known as Princess Uno-no-sarara (鸕野讃良皇女) in her early days, was born to Emperor Tenji and his concubine, who held of Beauty (Hin).She had two full siblings: Princess Ōta and Prince Takeru. Empress Jitō and her younger sister, Princess Ōta, shared the same husband, Emperor Tenmu, with whom both would have children.

*Husband: Emperor Tenmu (天武天皇, Tenmu tennō, c. 631 – October 1, 686), son of Emperor Jomei and Empress Kōgyoku
**Son: Crown Prince Kusakabe (草壁皇子, 662 – May 10, 689)

==Poetry==
The &quot;Man&#x27;yōshū&quot; includes poems said to have been composed by Jitō. This one was composed after the death of the Emperor Tenmu:

One of the poems attributed to Empress Jitō was selected by Fujiwara no Teika for inclusion in the very popular anthology &quot;Hyakunin Isshu&quot;:

<doc id="10428" wikidata="Q357246" url="?curid=10428" title="Emperor Monmu">
<text>was the 42nd emperor of Japan, according to the traditional order of succession.

Monmu&#x27;s reign spanned the years from 697 through 707.

==Traditional narrative==
Before his ascension to the Chrysanthemum Throne, his personal name (&quot;imina&quot;) was Karu&quot;-shinnō&quot;.

He was a grandson of Emperor Tenmu and Empress Jitō. He was the second son of Prince Kusakabe. Monmu&#x27;s mother was Princess Abe, a daughter of Emperor Tenji. Monmu&#x27;s mother would later accede to the throne herself, and she would be known as Empress Genmei.

===Events of Monmu&#x27;s life===
Karu&quot;-shinnō&quot; was only six years old when his father, Crown Prince Kusakabe, died.

* 697: In the 10th year of Jitō&quot;-tennō&quot;″s reign (持統天皇十年), the empress abdicated; and the succession (&quot;senso&quot;) was received by a grandson of Emperor Tenmu. Shortly thereafter, Emperor Monmu is said to have acceded to the throne (&quot;sokui&quot;).

Emperor Monmu ruled until his death in 707, at which point he was succeeded by his mother, Empress Genmei, who was also his first cousin once removed and his first cousin twice removed. He left a young son by Fujiwara no Miyako, a daughter of Fujiwara no Fuhito: Obito no miko (Prince Obito), who eventually became Emperor Shōmu.

Emperor Monmu&#x27;s reign lasted 10 years. He died at the age of 25.

The actual site of Monmu&#x27;s grave is known. This emperor is traditionally venerated at a memorial Shinto shrine (&quot;misasagi&quot;) at Nara.

The Imperial Household Agency designates this location as Monmu&#x27;s mausoleum. It is formally named &quot;Hinokuma no Ako no oka no e no misasagi&quot;.

===Kugyō===
 is a collective term for the very few most powerful men attached to the court of the Emperor of Japan in pre-Meiji eras.

In general, this elite group included only three to four men at a time. These were hereditary courtiers whose experience and background would have brought them to the pinnacle of a life&#x27;s career. During Monmu&#x27;s reign, this apex of the &quot;Daijō-kan&quot; included:
* &quot;Daijō-daijin&quot;, Osakabe&quot;-shinnō&quot;.
* &quot;Sadaijin&quot;
* &quot;Udaijin&quot;
* &quot;Naidaijin&quot;, Nakatomi Kamako no Muraji.
* &quot;Dainagon&quot;, Fujiwara Fuhito.

==Eras of Monmu&#x27;s reign==
Conventional modern scholarship seems to have determined that the years of Monmu&#x27;s reign are encompassed within more than one era name or &quot;nengō&quot;.
* &quot;Taihō (era)&quot; (701–704)
* &quot;Keiun&quot; (704–708)

===Non&quot;-nengō&quot; period===
The initial years of Monmu&#x27;s reign are not linked by scholars to any era or &quot;nengō&quot;. The Taika era innovation of naming time periods – &quot;nengō&quot; – languished until Monmu reasserted an imperial right by proclaiming the commencement of Taihō in 701.
* See Japanese era name – &quot;Non-nengo periods&quot;
* See Monmu period (697–701).

In this context, Brown and Ishida&#x27;s translation of &quot;Gukanshō&quot; offers an explanation about the years of Empress Jitō&#x27;s reign which muddies a sense of easy clarity in the pre-Taiho time-frame:
::&quot;The eras that fell in this reign were: (1) the remaining seven years of Shuchō [(686+7=692?)]; and (2) Taika, which was four years long [695–698]. (The first year of this era was &quot;kinoto-hitsuji&quot; [695].) ... In the third year of the Taka era [697], Empress Jitō yielded the throne to the Crown Prince.&quot;

<doc id="10430" wikidata="Q235343" url="?curid=10430" title="Empress Genshō">
<text>was the 44th monarch of Japan, according to the traditional order of succession. Her reign spanned the years 715 through 724.

Genshō was the fifth of eight women to take on the role of empress regnant, and the only one in the history of Japan to have inherited her title from another empress regnant rather than from a male predecessor. The four female monarchs before Genshō were Suiko, Kōgyoku, Jitō and Genmei; the three reigning after her were Kōken, Meishō, and Go-Sakuramachi.

==Traditional narrative==
Before her ascension to the Chrysanthemum Throne, her personal name (&quot;imina&quot;) was Hidaka&quot;-hime&quot;.

Genshō was an elder sister of Emperor Monmu and daughter of Prince Kusakabe and his wife who later became Empress Genmei. Therefore, she was a granddaughter of Emperor Tenmu and Empress Jitō by her father and a granddaughter of Emperor Tenji through her mother.

===Events of Genshō&#x27;s life===

Empress Genshō&#x27;s succession to the throne was intended as a regency until Prince Obito, the son of her deceased younger brother Monmu, was mature enough to ascend the throne. Obito would later become the Emperor Shōmu.

Obito was appointed Crown Prince in 714 by Empress Genmei. In the next year, 715, Empress Genmei, then in her fifties, abdicated in favor of her daughter Genshō. Obito was then 14 years old.

* 715 (&quot;Reiki 1, 9th month&quot;): In the 7th year of Genmei&quot;-tennō&quot;″s reign (元明天皇七年), the empress abdicated; and the succession (&quot;senso&quot;) was received by her daughter, who held the throne in trust for her younger brother. Shortly thereafter, Empress Genshō acceded to the throne (&quot;sokui&quot;) as Empress Regnant.

Obito remained the crown prince, heir to the new empress. Fujiwara no Fuhito, the most powerful courtier in Genmei&#x27;s court, remained at his post until his death in 720. After his death, Prince Nagaya, a grandson of Tenmu and the Empress Genshō&#x27;s cousin, seized power. This power shift was a background for later conflicts between Nagaya and Fuhito&#x27;s four sons during the reign of Emperor Shōmu (formerly Prince Obito).

Under Genshō&#x27;s reign, the &quot;Nihon Shoki&quot; was finished in 720. Organization of the law system known as the &quot;ritsuryō&quot; was continued under the initiatives of Fuhito until his death. These laws and codes were edited and enacted by Fujiwara no Nakamaro, a grandson of Fuhito, and published as &quot;Yōrō ritsuryō&quot; under the name of Fuhito. The taxation system which had been introduced by Empress Jitō in the late 7th century began to malfunction. To compensate for the decreased tax revenue, the &quot;Act of possession in three generations&quot;, an initiative of Prince Nagaya, was enacted in 723. Under this act, people were allowed to possess a newly cultivated field once every three generations. In the fourth generation, the right of possession would revert to the national government. This act was intended to motivate new cultivation, but it only remained in effect for about 20 years.

Empress Genshō reigned for nine years. Although there were seven other reigning empresses, their successors were most often selected from amongst the males of the paternal Imperial bloodline, which is why some conservative scholars argue that the women&#x27;s reigns were temporary and that male-only succession tradition must be maintained in the 21st century. Empress Genmei, who was succeeded by her daughter, remains the sole exception to this conventional argument.

In 724, Genshō abdicated in favor of her nephew, who would be known as Emperor Shōmu. Genshō lived for 25 years after she stepped down from the throne. She never married and had no children. She died at age 65.

Empress Genshō&#x27;s grave is located in Nara. This empress is traditionally venerated at a memorial Shinto shrine (&quot;misasagi&quot;), also in Nara. The Imperial Household Agency has designated this location as Monmu&#x27;s mausoleum, and has been formally named &quot;Nahoyama no nishi no misasagi&quot;. The Imperial tomb can be visited today in Narazaka-chō, Nara City.

===Kugyō===
 is a collective term for the very few most powerful men attached to the court of the Emperor of Japan in pre-Meiji eras.

In general, this elite group included only three to four men at a time. These were hereditary courtiers whose experience and background would have brought them to the pinnacle of a life&#x27;s career. During Genshō&#x27;s reign, this apex of the &quot;Daijō-kan&quot; included:
* &quot;Daijō-daijin&quot; (&quot;Chi-daijō-kanji&quot; 知太政官事), Toneri&quot;-shinnō&quot; (Prince Toneri) (舎人親王). (9th son of Emperor Tenmu) 720–735
* &quot;Sadaijin&quot;, Isonokami no Maro (石上麻呂). 708–717
* &quot;Udaijin&quot;, Fujiwara no Fuhito (藤原不比等). 708–720
* &quot;Udaijin&quot;, Prince Nagaya (長屋王). 721–724
* &quot;Dainagon&quot;, Abe no Sukunamaro (阿倍宿奈麻呂). 718–720
* &quot;Dainagon&quot;, Prince Nagaya (長屋王). 718–721
* &quot;Dainagon&quot;, Tajihi no Ikemori (多治比池守). 721–730

==Eras of Genshō&#x27;s reign==
The years of Genshō&#x27;s reign are more specifically identified by more than one era name or &quot;nengō&quot;.
* &quot;Reiki&quot; (715–717)
* &quot;Yōrō&quot; (717–724)
* &quot;Jinki&quot; (724–729)

== Genealogy ==
Empress Genshō, born Princess Hidaka (氷高皇女), was the eldest child of Empress Genmei (元明天皇) and her husband, Crown Prince Kusakabe (草壁皇子). She had one younger brother, Prince Karu (珂瑠皇子), later known as Emperor Monmu (文武天皇), and one younger sister, Imperial Princess Kibi (吉備内親王).

Empress Genshō never got married or had children. The throne was inherited by her younger brother&#x27;s son, Emperor Shōmu.

<doc id="10431" wikidata="Q232955" url="?curid=10431" title="Empress Kōken">
<text>, known as after her second accession to the throne, was the 46th (with the name Empress Kōken) and the 48th monarch of Japan (with the name Empress Shōtoku), according to the traditional order of succession. Both her reigns occurred during the Nara period.

The daughter of Emperor Shōmu, Empress Kōken succeeded to the throne at the age of 31, following her father&#x27;s renunciation. She first reigned from 749 to 758. During this period, the government was heavily influenced by her mother, the former empress consort Kōmyō, and the latter&#x27;s nephew, Fujiwara no Nakamaro. She was eventually replaced on the throne by her relative, Emperor Junnin, whose rule was a continuation of Nakamaro&#x27;s regime. During the intermediate period of her reigns, the retired empress Kōken is said to have become close to a monk without a noble background, named Dōkyō, by 762. Their precise relationship remains a mystery, although there is a common version that it was romantic. The retired empress had taken Buddhist oaths and became a nun, but retained a decisive role in politics. 

After Kōmyō&#x27;s death in July 760, the growing power struggle between Kōken&#x27;s and Nakamaro&#x27;s opposing factions became increasingly inevitable. Following the suppression of the Fujiwara no Nakamaro Rebellion and his murder, Kōken reascended the throne as Empress Shōtoku in 764 and ruled until her death in 770, concentrating the government into her own hands. Dōkyō was appointed Grand Minister within a year. In 766, he was promoted to Hōō (priestly emperor) and in around 769 tried to ascend the throne himself, which led to a scandal; this was one of few recorded instances when there was an attempt to end the imperial dynasty. The death of the empress, presumably from smallpox, and resistance from the aristocracy destroyed his plans. This incident was a reason for the later move of the Japanese capital from Nara (Heijō). Empress Kōken was one of the most politically powerful women in Japanese history: subsequent empresses were only ritual rulers, while the government was dominated by the shoguns (military dictators).

In the history of Japan, Kōken/Shōtoku was the sixth of eight women to take on the role of empress regnant. The five female monarchs before her were Suiko, Kōgyoku/Saimei, Jitō, Genmei and Genshō, and the two women sovereigns reigning after Kōken/Shōtoku were Meishō and Go-Sakuramachi.

==Traditional narrative==
Empress Kōken&#x27;s personal name (&quot;imina&quot;) was . Her father was Emperor Shōmu, and her mother was Empress Kōmyō.

Kōken is traditionally venerated at her tomb; the Imperial Household Agency designates , in Nara, Nara, as the location of Kōken&#x27;s mausoleum. The site is publicly accessible.

===Events of Kōken&#x27;s life===
* August 19, 749 (): In the 25th year of Shōmu&quot;-tennō&quot;″s reign (聖武天皇二十五年), the emperor renounced his throne and the succession (&quot;senso&quot;) was received by his daughter. Shortly thereafter, Kōken is said to have acceded to the throne.
* 757: Conspiracy to overthrow Empress Kōken was not successful.
* 758: Kōken abdicated in favor of a cousin who would become known as Emperor Junnin so that she would take care of her sick mother intensively. The Empress had reigned for about ten years.
* 764: In the sixth year of Junnin&quot;-tennō&quot;″s reign, the emperor was deposed by his adoptive mother, and the succession was received by former-Empress Kōken.
* January 26, 765 (): Kōken formally reascended the throne (&quot;sokui&quot;) as Empress Shōtoku.
* August 28, 770 (: Empress Shōtoku died at age 57, leaving the throne vacant. She was succeeded by her first cousin twice removed, Emperor Kōnin. Empress Shōtoku had reigned for five years.

===Eras of her reigns===
The years of Kōken&#x27;s reign are more specifically identified by more than one era name.
* &quot;Tenpyō-kanpō&quot; (749)
* &quot;Tenpyō-shōhō&quot; (749–757)
* &quot;Tenpyō-hōji&quot; (757–765)

The years of Shōtoku&#x27;s reign are more specifically identified by more than one era name.
* &quot;Tenpyō-hōji&quot; (757–765)
* &quot;Tenpyō-jingo&quot; (765–767)
* &quot;Jingo-keiun&quot; (767–770)

==Legacy==
Koken&#x27;s reign was turbulent, and she survived coup attempts by both Tachibana no Naramaro and Fujiwara no Nakamaro. Today, she is remembered chiefly for her alleged affair with a Buddhist monk named Dōkyō (道鏡), a man she honored with titles and power. An oracle from Usa Shrine, the shrine of the kami in Usa, is said to have proclaimed that the monk should be made emperor; but when the empress sent to verify the pronouncement, Hachiman decreed that only one of imperial blood should ascend to the throne.

As with the seven other reigning empresses whose successors were most often selected from amongst the males of the paternal imperial bloodline, she was followed on the throne by a male cousin, which is why some conservative scholars argue that the women&#x27;s reigns were temporary and that male-only succession tradition must be maintained in the 21st century. Empress Genmei, who was followed on the throne by her daughter, Empress Genshō, remains the sole exception to this conventional argument.

She is also known for sponsoring the Hyakumantō Darani, one of the largest productions of printed works in early Japan.

Otagi Nenbutsu-ji, a Buddhist temple in the Arashiyama neighborhood of Kyoto, was founded by Shōtoku in the middle of the eighth century.

==Kugyō==
 is a collective term for the very few most powerful men attached to the court of the Emperor of Japan in pre-Meiji eras.

In general, this elite group included only three to four men at a time. These were hereditary courtiers whose experience and background would have brought them to the pinnacle of a life&#x27;s career. During Kōken&#x27;s reign, this apex of the &quot;Daijō-kan&quot; included:
* &quot;Taihō&quot;, Emi no Oshikatsu (formerly Fujiwara no Nakamaro).
* &quot;Daijō-daijin&quot;
* &quot;Sadaijin&quot;, Tachibana no Moroe (formerly Katsuragi&quot;-ō&quot;, Prince Katsuragi) (half brother of Empress Kōmyō).
* &quot;Udaijin&quot;, Fujiwara no Toyonari (first son of Fujiwara no Muchimaro).
* &quot;Udaijin&quot;, Fujiwara no Nakamaro (second son of Fujiwara no Muchimaro).
* &quot;Naidaijin&quot;
* &quot;Dainagon&quot;

The &quot;kugyō&quot; during Shōtoku&#x27;s reign included:
* &quot;Daijō-daiji&quot;, Dōkyō.
* &quot;Sadaijin&quot;
* &quot;Udaijin&quot;, Kibi Makibi.
* &quot;Nadaijin&quot;
* &quot;Dainagon&quot;, Fujiwara Matate.

<doc id="10432" wikidata="Q329713" url="?curid=10432" title="Emperor Junnin">
<text>was the 47th emperor of Japan, according to the traditional order of succession. The seventh son of Prince Toneri and a grandson of Emperor Tenmu, his reign spanned the years 758 to 764.

==Traditional narrative==
Before his ascension to the throne, his name (&quot;imina&quot;) was Ōi-no-ō. He was the seventh son of Prince Toneri, a son of Emperor Tenmu. And although his father died when he was three, he was not given any rank or office at the court. After the forced abdication he received the newer rank, thus addressed Ōi&quot;-shinnō&quot;. In the older Japanese documents, he is usually referred to as Haitai (廃帝), the dethroned emperor. The posthumous name of Emperor Junnin was given by Emperor Meiji a thousand years later.

===Ascension and reign===
In 757 the Empress Kōken, his third cousin appointed him to be her crown prince instead of Prince Funado, who had been appointed to this position in the will of the Emperor Shōmu. In the tenth year of Kōken&quot;-tennō&quot;″s reign (), on December 7, 758 (&quot;Tenpyō-shōhō 2, 1st day of the 8th month&quot;), the empress abdicated and the succession (&quot;senso&quot;) passed to her adopted son. Shortly afterwards, Emperor Junnin is said to have ascended to the throne (&quot;sokui&quot;). In 760 (&quot;Tenpyō-hōji 4&quot;), additional coins were put into circulation—copper coins bearing the words &quot;Mannen Ten-hō&quot;, silver coins bearing the words &quot;Teihei Genhō&quot;, and gold coins bearing the words &quot;Kaiki Shōhō&quot;.

The years of Junnin&#x27;s reign, 758–765, are more specifically encompassed within a single era name or &quot;nengō&quot;, &quot;Tenpyō-hōji&quot;. Junnin seemingly had very little power and was possibly a mere figurehead. In 764, six years after Empress Kōken had abdicated, the former empress reclaimed the throne during Fujiwara no Nakamaro&#x27;s Rebellion, forcing Junnin to abdicate.

===Death and mausoleum===
On November 10, 765 (&quot;Tenpyō-jingo 1, 23rd day of the 10th month&quot;), the former emperor died while in exile. The official cause of death was illness, but according to one theory, it was the assassination by the order of Emperor Shōtoku. The site of Junnin&#x27;s actual grave is unknown, and he is traditionally venerated at a memorial Shinto shrine (&quot;misasagi&quot;) at Awaji. The Imperial Household Agency designates this location as Junnin&#x27;s mausoleum: It is formally named &quot;Awaji no misasagi&quot;.

Though Junnin had, technically, been emperor, he was not featured on the official List of Japanese Emperors until the late nineteenth century. In 1870, Emperor Meiji conferred the posthumous name and title by which Emperor Junnin is now known. His place in the traditional order of succession was confirmed at the same time as announcements about Emperor Kōbun and Emperor Chūkyō were made public.

==Kugyō==
 is a collective term for the few most powerful men attached to the court of the Emperor of Japan in pre-Meiji eras. In general, this elite group included only three or four men at a time, and they were hereditary courtiers whose experience and background would have brought them to the pinnacle of their careers. During Junnin&#x27;s reign, the ranks of this group of &quot;Daijō-kan&quot; included:

* Taiho (Udaijin): Fujiwara Oshikatsu.
* Sadaijin:, Fujiwara no Toyonari (藤原豊成).
* Udaijin, Fujiwara no Toyonari (藤原豊成).
* Naidaijin (not appointed)

<doc id="10434" wikidata="Q353558" url="?curid=10434" title="Emperor Heizei">
<text>, also known as &quot;Heijō-tennō&quot;, was the 51st emperor of Japan, according to the traditional order of succession. Heizei&#x27;s reign lasted from 806 to 809.

==Traditional narrative==
Heizei was the eldest son of the Emperor Kanmu and empress Fujiwara no Otomuro. Heizei had three empresses and seven sons and daughters.

Heizei is traditionally venerated at his tomb; the Imperial Household Agency designates , in Nara, as the location of Heizei&#x27;s mausoleum. The site is publicly accessible. Although one of the largest kofun monuments in Japan, archaeological investigations in 1962–1963 indicate that it was constructed in the early 5th century, and that portions of it were destroyed during the construction of Heijō-kyō, calling into question the designation by the Imperial Household Agency.

===Events of Heizei&#x27;s life===
Before he ascended to the throne, his liaison with Fujiwara no Kusuko, the mother of his one consort, caused a scandal. Because of this scandal his father considered depriving him of the rank of crown prince.

* 785: (): Heizei was appointed Crown Prince at the age of 12.
* April 9, 806 (): In the 25th year of Emperor Kanmu&#x27;s reign, he died; and despite an ensuing dispute over who should follow him as sovereign, contemporary scholars then construed that the succession (&quot;senso&quot;) was received by his son. Shortly thereafter, Emperor Heizei is said to have acceded to the throne (&quot;sokui&quot;).

His title Heizei was derived from the official name of the capital in Nara, Heizei Kyō.

During Heizei&#x27;s reign, the bodyguards were reorganized; the existing Imperial Bodyguards became the Left Imperial Bodyguards, while the Middle Bodyguards became the Right Imperial Bodyguards. Both sides were given a new Senior Commander; at this time Heizei appointed Sakanoue no Tamuramaro (758–811) as Senior Commander of the Imperial Bodyguards of the Right. Under Emperor Kanmu, Tamuramaro had been appointed as &quot;shōgun&quot; of a military expedition against the Emishi.

* 809 (): After a reign of four years, Heizei fell ill; and fearing that he would not survive, Heizei abdicated in favor of his younger brother, who would later come to be known as Emperor Saga. After abdicating, Heizei moved to Nara and was henceforth known as &quot;Nara no Mikado&quot;, the &quot;Emperor of Nara&quot;.
* May 18, 809 (): Emperor Saga was enthroned at age 24.
* 810 (&quot;Kōnin 1&quot;): In Heizei&#x27;s name, the former emperor&#x27;s ambitious third wife, , and her brother Nakanari organized an attempted rebellion, but their forces were defeated. Kusuko died in poison and her brother was executed. Heizei took the tonsure and became a Buddhist monk.
* August 5, 824 (): Heizei died at age 51, 14 years after he had abdicated due to illness.

===Era of Heizei&#x27;s reign===
The years of Heizei&#x27;s reign are encompassed within one era name (&quot;nengō&quot;).
* &quot;Daidō&quot; (806–810)

==Kugyō==
 is a collective term for the very few most powerful men attached to the court of the Emperor of Japan in pre-Meiji eras.

In general, this elite group included only three to four men at a time. These were hereditary courtiers whose experience and background would have brought them to the pinnacle of a life&#x27;s career. During Heizei&#x27;s reign, this apex of the &quot;Daijō-kan&quot; included:
* &quot;Sadaijin&quot; (not appointed)
* &quot;Udaijin&quot;, Miwa-no-Oh or Miwa-no-Ohkimi (神王), 798–806.
* &quot;Udaijin&quot;, Fujiwara no Uchimaro (藤原内麿), 806–812.
* &quot;Naidaijin&quot;
* &quot;Dainagon&quot;, Fujiwara no Otomo (藤原雄友), 806–807

When the daughter of a &quot;chūnagon&quot; became the favored consort of the Crown Prince Ate (later known as Heizei&quot;-tennō&quot;), her father&#x27;s power and position in court was affected. Kanmu disapproved of , former wife of Fujiwara no Tadanushi; and Kanmu had her removed from his son&#x27;s household. After Kanmu died, Heizei restored this one-time favorite as part of his household; and this distinction had consequences.

<doc id="10435" wikidata="Q316654" url="?curid=10435" title="Emperor Saga">
<text>was the 52nd emperor of Japan, according to the traditional order of succession. Saga&#x27;s reign lasted from 809 to 823.

==Traditional narrative==
Saga was the second son of Emperor Kanmu and Fujiwara no Otomuro. His personal name was . Saga was an &quot;accomplished calligrapher&quot; able to compose in Chinese who held the first imperial poetry competitions (). According to legend, he was the first Japanese emperor to drink tea.

Saga is traditionally venerated at his tomb; the Imperial Household Agency designates , in Ukyō-ku, Kyoto, as the location of Saga&#x27;s mausoleum.

===Events of Saga&#x27;s life===
* 806 Saga became the crown prince at age 21.
* June 17, 809 (): In the 4th year of Emperor Heizei&#x27;s reign, he fell ill and abdicated; and the succession (&quot;senso&quot;) was received by Kanmu&#x27;s second son Saga, the eldest son having become a Buddhist priest. Shortly thereafter, Emperor Saga is said to have acceded to the throne (&quot;sokui&quot;).

Soon after his enthronement, Saga himself took ill. At the time the retired Heizei had quarreled with his brother over the ideal location of the court, the latter preferring the Heian capital, while the former was convinced that a shift back to the Nara plain was necessary, and Heizei, exploiting Saga&#x27;s weakened health, seized the opportunity to foment a rebellion, known historically as the Kusuko Incident; however, forces loyal to Emperor Saga, led by &quot;taishōgun&quot; Sakanoue no Tamuramaro, quickly defeated the Heizei rebels which thus limited the adverse consequences which would have followed any broader conflict. This same Tamuramaro is remembered in Aomori&#x27;s annual Nebuta Matsuri which feature a number of gigantic, specially-constructed, illuminated paper floats. These great lantern-structures are colorfully painted with mythical figures; and teams of men carry them through the streets as crowds shout encouragement. This early ninth century military leader is commemorated in this way because he is said to have ordered huge illuminated lanterns to be placed at the top of hills; and when the curious Emishi approached these bright lights to investigate, they were captured and subdued by Tamuramaro&#x27;s men.
* August 24, 842 (): Saga died at the age of 57.

===Eras of Saga&#x27;s reign===
The years of Saga&#x27;s reign are more specifically identified by more than one era name (&quot;nengō&quot;).
* &quot;Daidō&quot; (806–810)
* &quot;Kōnin&quot; (810–824)

==Legacy==
In ancient Japan, there were four noble clans, the &quot;Gempeitōkitsu&quot; (源平藤橘). One of these clans, the Minamoto clan are also known as Genji (源氏), and of these, the Saga Genji (嵯峨源氏) are descended from 52nd emperor Saga. Saga&#x27;s son, Minamoto no Tōru, is thought to be an inspiration for the protagonist of the novel &quot;The Tale of Genji&quot;.

Emperor Saga played an important role as a stalwart supporter of the Buddhist monk Kūkai. The emperor helped Kūkai to establish the Shingon School of Buddhism by granting him Tō-ji Temple in the capital Heian-kyō (present-day Kyoto).

=== Daikaku-ji ===
 is a Shingon Buddhist temple in Ukyō-ku in Kyoto. The site was originally a residence of the emperor, and later various emperor conducted their cloistered rule from here. The artificial lake of the temple, Ōsawa Pond, is one of the oldest Japanese garden ponds to survive from the Heian period.

The &quot;Saga Go-ryū&quot; school of &quot;ikebana&quot; has its headquarters in the temple and is named in his honour.

==Kugyō==
 is a collective term for the very few most powerful men attached to the court of the Emperor of Japan in pre-Meiji eras.

In general, this elite group included only three to four men at a time. These were hereditary courtiers whose experience and background would have brought them to the pinnacle of a life&#x27;s career. During Saga&#x27;s reign (809–823), this &quot;kugyō&quot; included:

* &quot;Naidaijin&quot;
* &quot;Dainagon&quot;

==Consorts and children==

<text>was the 53rd emperor of Japan, according to the traditional order of succession. Junna reigned from 823 to 833.

==Traditional narrative==
Junna had six empresses and imperial consorts and 13 imperial sons and daughters. His personal name (&quot;imina&quot;) was .

Junna is traditionally venerated at his tomb; the Imperial Household Agency designates , in Nishikyō-ku, Kyoto, as the location of Junna&#x27;s mausoleum.

===Events of Junna&#x27;s life===
* 810: After the rebellion of Emperor Heizei, he became the crown prince of Emperor Saga at 25 years of age.
* 30 May 823 (): In the 14th year of Emperor Saga&#x27;s reign, he abdicated; the succession (&quot;senso&quot;) was received by Junna, Saga&#x27;s younger brother and Emperor Kanmu&#x27;s third son.
* 22 March 833 (): In the 10th year of Emperor Junna&#x27;s reign, the emperor abdicated; and the succession (&quot;senso&quot;) was received by his adopted son. Shortly thereafter, Emperor Ninmyo is said to have acceded to the throne. After Junna stepped down from the throne, two former Emperors were alive. In this period, Saga was called the Senior Retired Emperor and Junna was known as the Junior Retired Emperor.
* 11 June 840 (: Former-Emperor Junna died at the age of 55. Following his death, Fujiwara no Yoshifusa maneuvered to have Montoku, rather than the crown prince Tsunesada, put on the throne; Junna&#x27;s death set the stage for the Fujiwara clan&#x27;s ascendancy.

The years of Junna&#x27;s reign are more specifically identified by more than one era name (&quot;nengō&quot;).

<text>(25 May 1334 – 31 January 1398) was the third of the Emperors of Northern Court during the Period of the Northern and Southern Courts in Japan. According to pre-Meiji scholars, his reign spanned the years from 1348 through 1351.

==Genealogy==
His personal name was originally Masuhito (益仁), but was later changed to Okihito (興仁).

His father was Emperor Kōgon. His predecessor, Emperor Kōmyō was his uncle, the younger brother of Emperor Kōgon.

*Lady-in-waiting: Niwata (Minamoto) Motoko (庭田（源）資子; d.1394), Niwata Shigemoto&#x27;s daughter
**First son: Imperial Prince Fushimi-no-miya Yoshihito (1351–1416; 伏見宮栄仁親王) (Founder of Fushimi-no-miya house, collateral branch of the Imperial Family and included in the Succession to the Japanese throne until 1947)
**Second son: Imperial Prince Priest Koshin (1358–1391; 興信法親王)

*Consort: Sanjō-no-Tsubone (三条局)
**First daughter: Princess Suiho (瑞宝女王)
**Third son: Imperial Prince Priest Kojo (弘助法親王)

==Events of Sukō&#x27;s life==
Sukō occupied the Chrysanthemum Throne from 18 November 1348 until 22 November 1351.

In 1348, he became Crown Prince. In the same year, he became Northern Emperor upon the abdication of Emperor Kōmyō. Although Emperor Kōgon ruled as a cloistered Emperor, the rivalry between Ashikaga Takauji and Ashikaga Tadayoshi began, and in 1351, Takauji returned to the allegiance of the Southern Court, forcing Emperor Sukō to abdicate. This was intended to reunify the Imperial Line.

However, the peace soon fell apart, and in April 1352, the Southern Dynasty evacuated Kyoto, abducting with them Retired (Northern) Emperors Emperor Kōgon and Emperor Kōmyō as well as Emperor Sukō and the Crown Prince Tadahito. Because of this, Takauji made Emperor Kōgon&#x27;s second son Imperial Prince Iyahito emperor (First Fushimi-no-miya).

Returning to Kyoto in 1357, Emperor Sukō&#x27;s son Imperial Prince Yoshihito began to work with the Bakufu to be named Crown Prince, but the Bakufu instead decided to make Emperor Go-Kōgon&#x27;s son (the future Emperor Go-En&#x27;yū) Crown Prince instead.

In 1398, Emperor Sukō died. But, 30 years after his death, in 1428, his great-grandson Hikohito (彦仁), as the adopted son of Emperor Shōkō, became Emperor Go-Hanazono, fulfilling Sukō&#x27;s dearest wish. Sukō is enshrined at the &quot;Daikōmyōji no misasagi&quot; (大光明寺陵) in Fushimi-ku, Kyoto.

==Events of Go-Kōgon&#x27;s life==
In his own lifetime, Go-Kōgon and those around him believed that he occupied the Chrysanthemum Throne from 25 September 1352 to 9 April 1371.
In 1351, Ashikaga Takauji briefly returned to the allegiance of the Southern Dynasty, causing the Southern Court to briefly consolidate control of the Imperial Line. However, this peace fell apart in April 1352. On this occasion, the Southern Court abducted Retired (Northern) Emperors Emperor Kōgon and Emperor Kōmyō as well as Emperor Sukō and the Crown Prince Tadahito from Kyoto to Anau, the location of the Southern Court. This produced a state of affairs in which there was no Emperor in Kyoto. Because of this, Imperial Prince Iyahito became emperor in 1352 with the support of Ashikaga Yoshiakira.

During this period, the Era of the Northern and Southern Courts, because of the antagonism between the two competing dynasties, public order in Kyoto was disturbed. The Southern Court repeatedly recaptured Kyoto. Emperor Go-Kōgon was forced to repeatedly flee from Kyoto to Ōmi Province and other places. Around the time that Ashikaga Yoshimitsu was named &quot;shōgun&quot; (1368), the Southern Courts power weakened, and order was restored to Kyoto. Also around this time, the Emperor&#x27;s authority began to show its weakness.

On 9 April 1371, he abdicated in favor of his son, who became Emperor Go-En&#x27;yū. He continued to rule as Cloistered Emperor until he died of illness on 12 March 1374. He is enshrined with other emperors at the imperial tomb called &quot;Fukakusa no kita no misasagi&quot; (深草北陵) in Fushimi-ku, Kyoto.

==Events of Go-En&#x27;yū&#x27;s life==
In his own lifetime, Go-En&#x27;yū and those around him believed that he occupied the Chrysanthemum Throne from 9 April 1371 to 24 May 1382.

In 1371, by Imperial Proclamation, he received the rank of &quot;shinnō&quot; (親王), or Imperial Prince (and potential heir). Immediately afterwards, he became emperor upon the abdication of his father, Emperor Go-Kōgon. There was said to be a disagreement between Go-Kōgon and the retired Northern Emperor Emperor Sukō over the Crown Prince. With the support of Hosokawa Yoriyuki, who controlled the Bakufu, Go-Kōgon&#x27;s son became the Northern Emperor.

Until 1374, Go-Kōgon ruled as cloistered emperor. In 1368, Ashikaga Yoshimitsu was named &quot;shōgun&quot;, and with his guardianship, the Imperial Court was stabilized. In 1382, upon abdicating to Emperor Go-Komatsu, his cloistered rule began. Having no actual power, he rebelled, attempting suicide and accusing Ashikaga Yoshimitsu and his consort Itsuko of adultery.

In 1392, peace with the Southern Court being concluded, the Period of the Northern and Southern Courts came to an end. On 6 June 1393, Go-En&#x27;yū died. He is enshrined with other emperors at the imperial tomb called &quot;Fukakusa no kita no misasagi&quot; (深草北陵) in Fushimi-ku, Kyoto.

==Eras of Go-En&#x27;yū&#x27;s reign==

<doc id="10442" wikidata="Q313321" url="?curid=10442" title="Emperor Suizei">
<text>, also known as , was the second legendary emperor of Japan according to the traditional order of succession. Very little is known about this Emperor due to a lack of material available for further verification and study. Suizei is known as a &quot;legendary emperor&quot; among historians as his actual existence is disputed. A legendary account from the &quot;Kojiki&quot; states that Suizei became emperor after receiving the title of crown prince by his half brother due to his bravery regarding a murder plot. Suizei&#x27;s reign started in 581 BC, he had one wife and a sole son who supposedly became the next emperor upon his death in 549 BC.

==Legendary narrative== 
While the &quot;Kojiki&quot; provides little information about Suizei, it does state his name, genealogy, and a record about his accession to the throne. He was born sometime in 632 BC, and was one of the sons of Emperor Jimmu and his chief wife Himetataraisuzu-hime. The account in the Kojiki states that Suizei&#x27;s older brother Kamuyaimimi was originally the Crown-prince. When Jimmu died, another of his sons named Tagishimimi attempted to seize the throne by murdering those in his way. Tagishimimi was given birth to by a lesser wife named Ahiratsu-hime, and was older than Jimmu&#x27;s legitimate heir. When Himetataraisuzu-hime learned of the plot she tried in vain to warn her sons by way of songs and poems. While Suizei encouraged Kamuyaimimi to slay Tagishimimi, he could not find it in him to murder his own half brother. Suizei pleaded with his older brother for the weapon he was going to use, and upon receiving it accomplished the deed for him. Kamuyaimimi ceded his rights as crown prince shortly after to Suizei as he believed his braver younger brother should be the new Emperor.

Emperor Suizei&#x27;s pre-ascension name remains unknown, but the &quot;Kojiki&quot; records that he ruled from the palace of at Katsuragi in what would come to be known as Yamato Province. While another more expansive account exists in the &quot;Nihon Shoki&quot;, the section is more steeped in myth. Suizei is conventionally considered to have reigned from 581 to 549 BC. He wed Isuzuyori-hime at an unknown date, and the two had one son. Emperor Suizei allegedly died in 549 BC and his gravesite is formally named &quot;Tsukida no oka no e no misasagi&quot;. He was succeeded by his only son, &quot;Prince Shikitsuhikotamatemi&quot; who became Emperor Annei.

==Known information==

The existence of at least the first nine Emperors is disputed due to insufficient material available for further verification and study. Suizei is thus regarded by historians as a &quot;legendary Emperor&quot;, and is ranked as the first of eight Emperors without specific legends associated with them. The name Suizei&quot;-tennō&quot; was assigned to him posthumously by later generations, and literally means &quot;joyfully healthy peace&quot;. His name might have been regularized centuries after the lifetime ascribed to Suizei, possibly during the time in which legends about the origins of the imperial dynasty were compiled as the chronicles known today as the &quot;Kojiki&quot;. While the actual site of his grave is not known, an Imperial &quot;misasagi&quot; or tomb for Suizei is currently maintained in Kashihara. The first emperor that historians state might have actually existed is Emperor Sujin, the 10th emperor of Japan. Outside of the Kojiki, the reign of Emperor Kinmei ( – 571 AD) is the first for which contemporary historiography is able to assign verifiable dates. The conventionally accepted names and dates of the early Emperors were not confirmed as &quot;traditional&quot; though, until the reign of Emperor Kanmu between 737 and 806 AD.

<doc id="10443" wikidata="Q313345" url="?curid=10443" title="Emperor Annei">
<text>, also known as was the third legendary emperor of Japan, according to the traditional order of succession. Very little is known about this Emperor due to a lack of material available for further verification and study. Annei is known as a &quot;legendary emperor&quot; among historians as his actual existence is disputed. Nothing exists in the &quot;Kojiki&quot; other than his name and genealogy. Annei&#x27;s reign allegedly began in 549 BC, he had one wife and three sons. After his death in 511 BC, his second or third son supposedly became the next emperor.

==Legendary narrative==
Emperor Annei&#x27;s name appears in both the &quot;Kojiki&quot; and &quot;Nihon Shoki&quot; where only his genealogy are recorded. While the Japanese have traditionally accepted this sovereign&#x27;s historical existence, no extant contemporary records have been discovered that confirm a view that this historical figure actually reigned. Before his accession to the throne, he was allegedly known as Prince Shikitsu-hiko Tamatemi. Shikitsu-hiko Tamatemi was either the eldest son or the only son of Emperor Suizei with Isuzuyori-hime. The &quot;Kojiki&quot; records that he ruled from the palace of at Katashiro in Kawachi in what would come to be known as Yamato Province. During Emperor Annei&#x27;s alleged lifetime, he had one wife named &quot;Nunasokonakatsu-hime&quot; and fathered three children with her. Annei&#x27;s reign lasted from 549 BC until his death in 511 BC, his second or third son then took the throne and would later be referred to as Emperor Itoku.

==Known information==
The existence of at least the first nine Emperors is disputed due to insufficient material available for further verification and study. &quot;Annei&quot; is thus regarded by historians as a &quot;legendary Emperor&quot;, and is considered to have been the second of eight Emperors without specific legends associated with them. The name Annei&quot;-tennō&quot; was assigned to him posthumously by later generations, and literally means &quot;steady tranquillity&quot;. His name might have been regularized centuries after the lifetime ascribed to Annei, possibly during the time in which legends about the origins of the imperial dynasty were compiled as the chronicles known today as the &quot;Kojiki&quot;. The name &quot;Annei&quot; is first credited to Japanese scholar and writer Ōmi no Mifune, who allegedly came up with the name sometime in the latter half of the 8th century.

While the actual site of Annei&#x27;s grave is not known, the Emperor is traditionally venerated at a memorial Shinto shrine (陵,&quot;misasagi&quot;) in Kashihara. The Imperial Household Agency designates this location as Annei&#x27;s mausoleum, and is formally named &quot;Unebi-yama no hitsujisaru Mihodo no i no e no misasagi(畝傍山西南御陰井上陵,The royal tomb over the mihodo at the south west of mount unebi) &quot;. The first emperor that historians believe might have actually existed is Emperor Sujin, the 10th emperor of Japan. Outside of the Kojiki, the reign of Emperor Kinmei ( – 571 AD) is the first for which contemporary historiography is able to assign verifiable dates. The conventionally accepted names and dates of the early Emperors were not confirmed as &quot;traditional&quot; though, until the reign of Emperor Kanmu between 737 and 806 AD.

<doc id="10445" wikidata="Q312841" url="?curid=10445" title="Emperor Kōshō">
<text>, also known as was the fifth legendary emperor of Japan, according to the traditional order of succession. Very little is known about this Emperor due to a lack of material available for further verification and study. Kōshō is known as a &quot;legendary emperor&quot; among historians as his actual existence is disputed. Nothing exists in the &quot;Kojiki&quot; other than his name and genealogy. Kōshō&#x27;s reign allegedly began in 475 BC, he had one wife and two sons. After his death in 393 BC, his second son supposedly became the next emperor.

==Legendary narrative==
In the &quot;Kojiki&quot; and &quot;Nihon Shoki&quot;, only his name and genealogy were recorded. The Japanese have traditionally accepted this sovereign&#x27;s historical existence, and an Imperial &quot;misasagi&quot;(陵) or tomb for Kōshō is currently maintained; however, no extant contemporary records have been discovered that confirm a view that this historical figure actually reigned. Kōshō is believed to be the oldest son of Emperor Itoku, and his wife Amanotoyototsu-hime. His mother was the daughter of Okishimimi-no-kami. The &quot;Kojiki&quot; records that he ruled from the palace of at Waki-no-kami in what would come to be known as Yamato Province. Kōshō allegedly had a wife named &quot;Yosotarashi-hime&quot;, and fathered two children with her. His reign lasted from 475 BC until his death in 393 BC, his second son then took the throne and would later be referred to as Emperor Kōan.

==Known information==
The existence of at least the first nine Emperors is disputed due to insufficient material available for further verification and study. &quot;Kōshō&quot; is thus regarded by historians as a &quot;legendary Emperor&quot;, and is considered to have been the fourth of eight Emperors without specific legends associated with them. The name Kōshō&quot;-tennō&quot; was assigned to him posthumously by later generations, and literally means &quot;filial manifestation&quot;. His name might have been regularized centuries after the lifetime ascribed to Kōshō, possibly during the time in which legends about the origins of the imperial dynasty were compiled as the chronicles known today as the &quot;Kojiki&quot;. While the actual site of Kōshō&#x27;s grave is not known, the Emperor is traditionally venerated at a memorial Shinto shrine (&quot;misasagi&quot;) in Gose. The Imperial Household Agency designates this location as Kōshō&#x27;s mausoleum. It is formally named &quot;Waki-no-kami no Hakata no yama no e no misasagi&quot;. There is a possibility that this figure could have lived instead in the 1st century (AD), however more research is needed to make any further conclusions.

The first emperor that historians state might have actually existed is Emperor Sujin, the 10th emperor of Japan. Outside of the Kojiki, the reign of Emperor Kinmei ( – 571 AD) is the first for which contemporary historiography is able to assign verifiable dates.

Kōan is known as a &quot;legendary emperor&quot; among historians as his actual existence is disputed. Nothing exists in the &quot;Kojiki&quot; other than his name and genealogy. Kōan&#x27;s reign allegedly began in 393 BC, he had one wife and two sons and reigned for more than 100 years until his death in 291 BC at the age of 137. One of his sons then supposedly became the next emperor. Emperor Kōan is traditionally accepted as the final emperor of the Jōmon period, which ended in 300 BC.

==Legendary narrative== 
In the &quot;Kojiki&quot; and &quot;Nihon Shoki&quot;, only his name and genealogy were recorded. The Japanese have traditionally accepted this sovereign&#x27;s historical existence, and an Imperial &quot;misasagi&quot; or tomb for Kōan is currently maintained; however, no extant contemporary records have been discovered that confirm a view that this historical figure actually reigned. He is believed to be son of Emperor Kōshō; and his mother is believed to have been Yosotarashi-no-hime, who was the daughter of Okitsuyoso, and ancestress of the Owari. The &quot;Kojiki&quot; records Kōan was the second son of Emperor Kōshō, and that he ruled from the palace of at Muro in what would come to be known as Yamato Province. Kōan was allegedly an emperor who reigned for more than a hundred years, and lived to the age of 137 (according to the Kojiki). He allegedly had a wife named Yosotarashi-hime, and fathered two children with her. Kōan&#x27;s reign lasted from 392 BC until his death in 291 BC, one of his sons then took the throne and would later be referred to as Emperor Kōrei.

==Known information==
The existence of at least the first nine Emperors is disputed due to insufficient material available for further verification and study. Kōan is thus regarded by historians as a &quot;legendary Emperor&quot;, and is considered to have been the fifth of eight Emperors without specific legends associated with them. The name Kōan&quot;-tennō&quot; was assigned to him posthumously by later generations. His name might have been regularized centuries after the lifetime ascribed to Kōan, possibly during the time in which legends about the origins of the imperial dynasty were compiled as the chronicles known today as the &quot;Kojiki&quot;. The name &quot;Kōan&quot; is first credited to Japanese scholar and writer Ōmi no Mifune, who allegedly came up with the name sometime in the latter half of the 8th century.

Emperor Kōan&#x27;s longevity is disputed as the oldest verified humans usually go into the mid to late 110s. While historian John S. Brownlee calls Kōan&#x27;s alleged age of 137 at the time of his death &quot;too long&quot;, he also says that this is not unusual for mythical figures. He ends his narrative by saying that nobody in Japan was bothered by the longevity of the former emperors until the modern era. Regardless of his age, the actual site of Kōan&#x27;s grave is not known. Kōan is traditionally venerated at a memorial Shinto shrine (&quot;misasagi&quot;) in Tamade, Gose. The Imperial Household Agency designates this location as Kōan&#x27;s mausoleum, and its formal name is &quot;Tamate no oka no e no misasagi&quot;.

The first emperor that historians state might have actually existed is Emperor Sujin, the 10th emperor of Japan. Outside of the Kojiki, the reign of Emperor Kinmei ( – 571 AD) is the first for which contemporary historiography is able to assign verifiable dates. The conventionally accepted names and dates of the early Emperors were not confirmed as &quot;traditional&quot; though, until the reign of Emperor Kanmu between 737 and 806 AD.

<text>, also known as was the seventh legendary emperor of Japan, according to the traditional order of succession. Very little is known about this Emperor due to a lack of material available for further verification and study. Kōrei is known as a &quot;legendary emperor&quot; among historians as his actual existence is disputed. Nothing exists in the &quot;Kojiki&quot; other than his name and genealogy. Kōrei&#x27;s reign allegedly began in 290 BC. He had one wife and three consorts with whom he fathered seven children. After his death in 215 BC, one of his sons supposedly became the next emperor. Kōrei is traditionally accepted as the first emperor of the Yayoi period, which is named after the Yayoi people who migrated to the Japanese archipelago from mainland Asia.

==Legendary narrative==
In the &quot;Kojiki&quot; and &quot;Nihon Shoki&quot;, only his name and genealogy were recorded. The Japanese have traditionally accepted this sovereign&#x27;s historical existence, and an Imperial &quot;misasagi&quot; or tomb for Kōrei is currently maintained; however, no extant contemporary records have been discovered that confirm a view that this historical figure actually reigned. Kōrei was born in 342 BC and is believed to be the eldest son of Emperor Kōan. His mother is believed to have been Oshihime, who was the daughter of Ametarashihiko-Kunio-shihito-no-mikoto. Kōrei&#x27;s pre-ascension name was Prince &quot;O-Yamato-Neko Hiko-futo-ni no Mikoto&quot;, and the &quot;Kojiki&quot; records that he ruled from the palace of at Kuroda in what would come to be known as Yamato Province. It is noted in the Kojiki that sometime during Kōrei&#x27;s reign, Kibi was conquered by the emperor. Kōrei was the first emperor since Jimmu to take on consorts, and fathered seven children with them along with his chief wife Empress: Kuwashi-hime. Kōrei is recorded as having a long life, reigning from 290 BC until his death in 215 BC. His eldest son was then subsequently enthroned as the next emperor.

==Known information==
The existence of at least the first nine Emperors is disputed due to insufficient material available for further verification and study. Kōrei is thus regarded by historians as a &quot;legendary Emperor&quot;, and is considered to have been the sixth of eight Emperors without specific legends associated with them. The name Kōrei&quot;-tennō&quot; was assigned to him posthumously by later generations. His name might have been regularized centuries after the lifetime ascribed to Kōrei, possibly during the time in which legends about the origins of the imperial dynasty were compiled as the chronicles known today as the &quot;Kojiki&quot;. As with Emperor Kōan, Kōrei&#x27;s exceptional age of 127 is considered unlikely due to verification issues among other things. While the actual site of Kōrei&#x27;s grave is not known, the Emperor is traditionally venerated at a memorial Shinto shrine (&quot;misasagi&quot;) in Ōji. The Imperial Household Agency designates this location as Kōrei&#x27;s mausoleum, and its formal name is &quot;Kataoka no Umasaka no misasagi&quot;.

Like Emperor Kōshō, there is a possibility that &quot;Kōrei&quot; could have lived instead in the 1st century (AD). Historian Louis Frédéric notes this idea in his book &quot;Japan Encyclopedia&quot; where he says it is &quot;very likely&quot;, but this remains disputed among other researchers. The first emperor that historians state might have actually existed is Emperor Sujin, the 10th emperor of Japan. Outside of the Kojiki, the reign of Emperor Kinmei ( – 571 AD) is the first for which contemporary historiography is able to assign verifiable dates. The conventionally accepted names and dates of the early Emperors were not confirmed as &quot;traditional&quot; though, until the reign of Emperor Kanmu between 737 and 806 AD.

<text>, also known as was the eighth legendary emperor of Japan, according to the traditional order of succession. Very little is known about this Emperor due to a lack of material available for further verification and study. Kōgen is known as a &quot;legendary emperor&quot; among historians as his actual existence is disputed. Nothing exists in the &quot;Kojiki&quot; other than his name and genealogy. Kōgen&#x27;s reign allegedly began in 214 BC, he had one wife and two consorts whom he fathered six children with. After his death in 158 BC, one of his sons supposedly became Emperor Kaika.

In the &quot;Kojiki&quot; and &quot;Nihon Shoki&quot;, only Kōgen&#x27;s name and genealogy were recorded. The Japanese have traditionally accepted this sovereign&#x27;s historical existence, and an Imperial &quot;misasagi&quot; or tomb for Kōgen is currently maintained; however, no extant contemporary records have been discovered that confirm a view that this historical figure actually reigned. Kōgen was born sometime in 273 BC, and is recorded as being the eldest son of Emperor Kōrei. His empress mother was named &quot;Kuwashi-hime&quot;, who was the daughter of Shiki no Agatanushi Oome. Before he was enthroned sometime in 214 BC, his pre-ascension name was &quot;Prince Ō-yamato-neko-hiko-kuni-kuru no Mikoto&quot;. The Kojiki records that he ruled from the palace of at Karu in what would come to be known as Yamato Province. Emperor Kōgen had a chief wife (empress) named &quot;Utsushikome&quot;, along with two consorts. His first son was named Prince Ōhiko, and according to the Nihon Shoki was the direct ancestor of the Abe clan. One of Kōgen&#x27;s other sons, Prince &quot;Hikofutsuoshinomakoto&quot;, was also the grandfather of the legendary Japanese hero-statesman Takenouchi no Sukune. Emperor Kōgen reigned until his death in 158 BC; his second son was then enthroned as the next emperor.

==Known information==
The existence of at least the first nine Emperors is disputed due to insufficient material available for further verification and study. Kōgen is thus regarded by historians as a &quot;legendary Emperor&quot;, and is considered to have been the seventh of eight Emperors without specific legends associated with them. The name Kōgen&quot;-tennō&quot; was assigned to him posthumously by later generations. His name might have been regularized centuries after the lifetime ascribed to Kōgen, possibly during the time in which legends about the origins of the imperial dynasty were compiled as the chronicles known today as the &quot;Kojiki&quot;. While the actual site of Kōgen&#x27;s grave is not known, the Emperor is traditionally venerated at a memorial Shinto shrine (&quot;misasagi&quot;) in Kashihara. The Imperial Household Agency designates this location as Kōgen&#x27;s mausoleum, and its formal name is &quot;Tsurugi no ike no shima no e no misasagi&quot;.

The first emperor that historians state might have actually existed is Emperor Sujin, the 10th emperor of Japan.

<doc id="10449" wikidata="Q333548" url="?curid=10449" title="Emperor Kaika">
<text>, also known as in the &quot;Kojiki&quot;, and in the &quot;Nihon Shoki&quot; was the ninth legendary emperor of Japan, according to the traditional order of succession. Very little is known about this Emperor due to a lack of material available for further verification and study. Kaika is known as a &quot;legendary emperor&quot; among historians as his actual existence is disputed. Nothing exists in the &quot;Kojiki&quot; other than his name and genealogy. Kaika&#x27;s reign allegedly began in 158 BC. He had one wife and three consorts whom he fathered five children with. After his death in 98 BC, one of his sons supposedly became Emperor Sujin.

==Legendary narrative==
In the &quot;Kojiki&quot; and &quot;Nihon Shoki&quot;, only Kaika&#x27;s name and genealogy were recorded. The Japanese have traditionally accepted this sovereign&#x27;s historical existence, and an Imperial &quot;misasagi&quot; or tomb for Kaika is currently maintained; however, no extant contemporary records have been discovered that confirm a view that this historical figure actually reigned. Kaika was born sometime in 208 BC, and is recorded as being the second son of Emperor Kōgen. His empress mother was named &quot;Utsushikome&quot;, who was the daughter of &quot;Oyakuchisukune&quot;. Before he was enthroned sometime in 158 BC, his pre-ascension name was &quot;Prince Nikohiko Ō-hibi no Mikoto&quot;. The Kojiki records that he ruled from the palace of at Karu in what would come to be known as Yamato Province. Emperor Kaika had a chief wife (empress) named &quot;Ikagashikome&quot;, along with three consorts of which he fathered five children with. Kaika ruled until his death in 98 BC; his second son was then enthroned as the next emperor. His son/heir to the throne was posthumously named &quot;Sujin&quot; by later generations, and is the first emperor that historians say might have actually existed.

==Known information==
The existence of at least the first nine Emperors is disputed due to insufficient material available for further verification and study. Kaika is thus regarded by historians as a &quot;legendary Emperor&quot;, and is considered to have been the eighth of eight Emperors without specific legends associated with them. The name Kaika&quot;-tennō&quot; was assigned to him posthumously by later generations.
 His name might have been regularized centuries after the lifetime ascribed to Kaika, possibly during the time in which legends about the origins of the imperial dynasty were compiled as the chronicles known today as the &quot;Kojiki&quot;. While the actual site of Kaika&#x27;s grave is not known, the Emperor is traditionally venerated at a memorial Shinto shrine (&quot;misasagi&quot;) in Nara. The Imperial Household Agency designates this location as Kaika&#x27;s mausoleum, and its formal name is &quot;Kasuga no Izakawa no saka no e no misasagi&quot;.

Like Emperor Kōshō and Emperor Kōrei, there is a possibility that &quot;Kaika&quot; could have lived instead in the 1st century (AD). Historian Louis Frédéric notes this idea in his book &quot;Japan Encyclopedia&quot; where he says &quot;more likely early AD&quot;, but this remains disputed among other researchers. The first emperor that historians state might have actually existed is Emperor Sujin, the 10th emperor of Japan. Outside of the Kojiki, the reign of Emperor Kinmei ( – 571 AD) is the first for which contemporary historiography is able to assign verifiable dates. The conventionally accepted names and dates of the early Emperors were not confirmed as &quot;traditional&quot; though, until the reign of Emperor Kanmu between 737 and 806 AD.

==Consorts and children==
*Empress: , Oohesoki&#x27;s daughter
**, later Emperor Sujin

<doc id="10450" wikidata="Q333530" url="?curid=10450" title="Emperor Sujin">
<text>, also known as in the , and or in the was the tenth Emperor of Japan. While Sujin is the first emperor whose existence historians widely accept, he is still referred to as a &quot;legendary emperor&quot; due to a lack of information available and because dates for his reign vary. Both the , and the (collectively known as the &quot;Kiki&quot;) record events that took place during Sujin&#x27;s alleged lifetime. This legendary narrative tells how he set up a new shrine outside of the Imperial palace to enshrine Amaterasu. He is also credited with initiating the worship of Ōmononushi (equated with the deity of Mount Miwa), and expanding his empire by sending generals to four regions of Japan in what became known as the legend of &quot;Shidō shogun&quot;.

This Emperor&#x27;s reign is conventionally assigned the years of 97 BC – 30 BC. During his alleged lifetime, he fathered twelve children with a chief wife (empress) and two consorts. Sujin chose his future heir based on dreams two of his sons had; in this case, his younger son became Emperor Suinin upon Sujin&#x27;s death in 30 BC. Like other emperors of this period, the location of Sujin&#x27;s grave if it exists is unknown. He is traditionally venerated at the Andonyama kofun in Tenri, Nara.

==Legendary narrative==
The Japanese have traditionally accepted this sovereign&#x27;s historical existence, and a kofun (tumulus) for Sujin is currently maintained. There remains no conclusive evidence though that supports this historical figure actually reigning. The following information available is taken from the pseudo-historical and , which are collectively known as or &quot;Japanese chronicles&quot;. These chronicles include legends and myths, as well as potential historical facts that have since been exaggerated and/or distorted over time. The records state that Sujin was born sometime in 148 BC, and was the second son of Emperor Kaika. Sujin&#x27;s mother was &quot;Ikagashikome no Mikoto&quot;, who was also a concubine of Sujin&#x27;s grandfather Emperor Kōgen. Before he was enthroned sometime in 97 BC, his pre-ascension name was either Prince &quot;Mimakiirihikoinie no Mikoto&quot;, &quot;Mimakiiribikoinie no Sumeramikoto&quot;, or &quot;Hatsukunishirasu Sumeramikoto&quot;. The former name is used in the , while the latter two are found in the . Sujin was enthroned sometime in 97 BC, and during the 3rd year of his reign it is the recorded that he moved the capital to , naming it the &quot;Palace of Mizu-gaki&quot; or .

===Enshrining Ōmononushi (Miwa Myōjin)===
The &quot;Kiki&quot; records that pestilence struck during the 5th year of Sujin&#x27;s rule, killing half the Japanese population. The following year peasants abandoned their fields and rebellion became rampant. To help relieve the suffering of his people, the Emperor turned his attention towards the gods. At the time, both the sun goddess Amaterasu and the god were enshrined at the Imperial Residence. Sujin became overwhelmed with having to cohabit with these two powerful deities and set up separate enshrinements to house them. Amaterasu was moved to in Yamato Province (Nara), where a Himorogi altar was built out of solid stone. Sujin placed his daughter in charge of the new shrine, and she would become the first Saiō. Yamato-no-Okunitama (the other god) was entrusted to another daughter named , but her health began to fail shortly afterward. It is recorded that Nunakiiri-hime became emaciated after losing all of her hair, which rendered her unable to perform her duties. These events still did not alleviate the ongoing plague sweeping the empire, so Sujin decreed a divination to be performed sometime during the 7th year of his reign. The divination involved him making a trip to the plain of Kami-asaji or , and invoking the eight hundred myriad deities.

Sujin&#x27;s aunt (daughter of 7th Emperor Emperor Kōrei) acted as a &quot;miko&quot;, and was possessed by a god who identified himself as Ōmononushi. This god claimed responsibility for the plague, announcing that it would not stop until he was venerated. Although the Emperor propitiated to the god, the effects were not immediate. Sujin was later given guidance in the form of a dream to seek out a man named and appoint him as head priest. When he was found and installed, the pestilence eventually subsided, allowing five cereal crops to ripen. Out of an abundance of caution, the Emperor also appointed as , or one who sorts the offerings to the gods. To this day the Miwa sect of the Kamo clan claim to be descents from , while Ikagashikoo was a claimed ancestor of the now extinct Mononobe clan.

===Four Cardinal Quarters (Shidō shogun)===

In his 10th year of rule, Sujin instituted four of his Generals to the &quot;Four Cardinal Quarters&quot; in what would be known as the &quot;Shidō shogun&quot;. These areas (west, north/northwest, northeast, and east) were all centered around the capital in Yamato Province. Sujin instructed his generals (shogun) to quell those who would not submit to their rule. One of the four shoguns who had been sent to the northern region was named , who was also Emperor Kōgen&#x27;s first son. One day a certain maiden approached Ōhiko and sang him a cryptic song, only to disappear afterwards. Sujin&#x27;s aunt , who was skilled at clairvoyance, interpreted this to mean that Take-hani-yasu-hiko (Ōhiko&#x27;s half brother) was plotting an insurrection. Yamatototohimomoso-hime pieced it together from overhearing news that Take-hani-yasu-hiko&#x27;s wife (Ata-bime) came to , and took a clump of earth in the corner of her neckerchief.

Emperor Sujin gathered his generals in a meeting upon hearing the news, but the couple had already mustered troops to the west who were ready to attack the capital. The Emperor responded by sending an army under the command of general &quot;Isaseri-hiko no Mikoto&quot; to fight a battle that ended with a decisive Imperial victory. Ata-bime was killed in combat, and her husband fled back north. Sujin then sent general north to Yamashiro Province to punish the rebel prince. There was ultimately an exchange of bowshots that resulted in Take-hani-yasu-hiko&#x27;s death by an arrow through the chest. Eventually the Emperor would appoint 137 governors for the provinces under his Imperial rule as the empire expanded. In his 12th year of rule, the Emperor decreed that a census be taken of the populace &quot;with grades of seniority, and the order of forced labour&quot;. The tax system meanwhile was set up so taxes imposed were in the form of mandatory labor. These taxes were known as for men and for women. During this period peace and prosperity ensued, and the Emperor received the title .

===Choosing an heir and Divine treasures===
During the 48th year of Sujin&#x27;s reign (50 BC), he summoned two of his sons saying that he loved them equally and could not make up his mind which to make his heir. He then asked his sons to describe the dreams they had recently, so he could divine their lot by interpreting them. The elder son&#x27;s name was , and explained to his father that he dreamt of climbing Mt. Mimoro (Mount Miwa). While facing east, he said that he thrust his spear eight times and then waved his sword eight times skywards. The younger prince, whose name was dreamt of climbing Mimoro and spanning ropes on four sides. He went on to say how he chased the sparrows that ate the millet. Sujin accordingly chose his younger son Ikume to become the next Crown prince, while his older son Toyoki was chosen to govern the east. Toyoki ultimately became the ancestor of the Kamitsuke and Shimotsuke clans.

In the 60th year of Sujin&#x27;s reign (38 BC), Sujin told his ministers that he wanted to look at divine treasures brought from the heavens by which were housed in the Izumo Shrine. was the keeper of the treasures, but at the time was away on business in Tsukushi Province. Furune&#x27;s younger brother , accommodated the Imperial Edict on his behalf by sending his two younger brothers as carriers of these treasures to show the Emperor. When Furune returned, he was furious at Iiirine for parting with the treasures. He invited his younger brother to wade in a pool (named Yamuya) with him, where he used a sword-swapping intrigue. Furune exchanged his own wooden sword with his brother&#x27;s real sword and commenced a battle which ended with Iiirine&#x27;s death. When the Imperial court received news of the event, they dispatched two generals to slay Izumo Furune.

===Later reign and death===
Towards the end of his reign in (36 BC), both the and records indicate that Sujin started to encourage the building of artificial ponds and canals. During this time, was built near in Sumiyoshi-ku, Osaka. Sujin is also credited with building which was said to be located in &quot;Karu&quot; (Kashihara, Nara). During his alleged lifetime, Sujin fathered twelve children with a chief wife (empress) and two consorts. When he died in 30 BC, his son &quot;Prince Ikumeirihikoisachi&quot; became the next emperor per Sujin&#x27;s choice. Sujin&#x27;s actual burial site is unknown, but is said to be at Mount Miwa.

==Historical figure==

While Emperor Sujin is the first emperor whom historians state might have actually existed, he is not confirmed as an actual historical figure. Like his predecessors, his reign is disputed due to insufficient material available for further verification and study. Sujin&#x27;s possible lifespan has been suggested to be as early as the 1st century AD, to as late as the fourth century AD, this is well past his conventionally assigned reign of 97 BC – 30 BC. Like Emperor Kōshō, Emperor Kōrei, and Emperor Kaika, historian Louis Frédéric notes an idea in his book &quot;Japan Encyclopedia&quot; that Sujin could have lived in the 1st century (AD). This remains disputed though, especially among researchers who have been critical of his book. If Sujin did in fact exist, then he may have been the founder of the imperial dynasty. Historian Richard Ponsonby-Fane suggests that Sujin may have been the first emperor to perform a census and establish and regularize a system of taxation.

In either case (fictional or not), the name Sujin&quot;-tennō&quot; was assigned to him posthumously by later generations. His name might have been regularized centuries after the lifetime ascribed to Sujin, possibly during the time in which legends about the origins of the imperial dynasty were compiled as the chronicles known today as the . Sujin&#x27;s longevity was also written down by later compilers, who may have unrealistically extended his age to fill in time gaps. While the actual site of Sujin&#x27;s grave is not known, the Emperor is traditionally venerated at the &quot;Andonyama kofun&quot; in Tenri, Nara. The Imperial Household Agency designates this location as the kofun (tumulus), and its formal name is &quot;&quot;Yamanobe no michi no Magari no oka no e no misasagi&quot;. Sujin&#x27;s kofun is one of six that are present in the area; the mounds are thought to have built sometime between 250 and 350 AD.

Outside of the , the reign of Emperor Kinmei ( – 571 AD) is the first for which contemporary historiography is able to assign verifiable dates. The conventionally accepted names and dates of the early Emperors were not confirmed as &quot;traditional&quot; though, until the reign of Emperor Kanmu between 737 and 806 AD. The lineal ancestor of the current reigning emperor can be traced back to Emperor Kōkaku, who lived a thousand years later.

<doc id="10451" wikidata="Q314850" url="?curid=10451" title="Emperor Suinin">
<text>, also known as was the 11th legendary Emperor of Japan, according to the traditional order of succession. Less is known about &quot;Suinin&quot; than his father, and likewise he is also considered to be a &quot;legendary emperor&quot;. Both the &quot;Kojiki&quot;, and the &quot;Nihon Shoki&quot; (collectively known as the &quot;Kiki&quot;) record events that took place during Suinin&#x27;s alleged lifetime. This legendary narrative tells how he ordered his daughter Yamatohime-no-mikoto to establish a new permanent shrine for Amaterasu (the Sun Goddess), which eventually became known as the Ise Grand Shrine. Other events that were recorded concurrently with his reign include the origins of Sumo wrestling in the form of a wrestling match involving Nomi no Sukune.

Suinin&#x27;s reign is conventionally considered to have been from 29 BC to AD 70. During his alleged lifetime, he fathered seventeen children with two chief wives (empress) and six consorts. One of his sons became the next emperor upon his death in 70 AD, but the location of his father&#x27;s grave (if any) is unknown. Suinin is traditionally venerated at a memorial Shinto tomb (&quot;misasagi&quot;) at Nishi-machi, Amagatsuji, Nara City.

==Legendary narrative==
The Japanese have traditionally accepted this sovereign&#x27;s historical existence, and a mausoleum (misasagi) for Suinin is currently maintained. There remains no conclusive evidence though that supports this historical figure actually reigning. The following information available is taken from the pseudo-historical &quot;Kojiki&quot; and &quot;Nihon Shoki&quot;, which are collectively known as or &quot;Japanese chronicles&quot;. These chronicles include legends and myths, as well as potential historical facts that have since been exaggerated and/or distorted over time. The records state that Suinin was born sometime in 69 BC, and was the third son of Emperor Sujin. Suinin&#x27;s empress mother was named Mimaki-hime, who is also former Emperor Kōgen&#x27;s daughter. Before he was enthroned sometime in 29 BC, his pre-ascension name was Prince &quot;Ikumeiribikoisachi no Sumeramikoto&quot;. He appears to have ascended the throne a year before his father&#x27;s death in 30 BC, and ruled from the palace of at Makimuku in what later became Yamato Province.

Suinin is best known for events that surround the founding of the Ise Grand Shrine. The &quot;Nihon Shoki&quot; states that around 2,000 years ago the Emperor ordered his daughter Yamatohime-no-mikoto, to find a permanent location to worship the goddess Amaterasu-ōmikami (the Sun Goddess). Yamatohime searched for 20 years before settling on a location in Ise, where she established Naiku, the Inner Shrine. She is said to have chosen the location after she heard the voice of Amaterasu say; &quot;(Ise) is a secluded and pleasant land. In this land I wish to dwell.&quot; Amaterasu had previously been enshrined and worshipped in Kasanui, which was set up by Suinin&#x27;s father in an attempt to alleviate a devastating plaque. The &quot;Kojiki&quot; records that during the reign of Emperor Suinin, the first &quot;Saiō&quot; (High Priestess) was appointed for Ise Grand Shrine. This recording is also noted by &quot;Jien&quot;, who was a 13th-century historian and poet. This remains disputed though, as the Man&#x27;yōshū (The Anthology of Ten Thousand Leaves) states that the first Saiō to serve at Ise was Princess Ōku. If the latter is true then it would date the Saiō appointments to the reign of Emperor Tenmu ( – 686 AD).

There were other events during Suinin&#x27;s reign as well that include an Asama Shrine tradition regarding Mount Fuji. The earliest veneration of Konohanasakuya-hime at the base of the mountain was said to be during the 3rd year of Emperor Suinin&#x27;s reign. The &quot;Nihon Shoki&quot; also records a wrestling match in which &quot;Nomi no Sukune&quot; and &quot;Taima no Kehaya&quot; held during his era, as the origin of &quot;Sumai&quot; (Sumo wrestling). Meanwhile, Emperor Suinin&#x27;s family grew to consist of 17 children with eight variously ranked wives. One of his consorts named &quot;Kaguya-hime-no-Mikoto&quot;, is mentioned in the &quot;Kojiki&quot; as a possible basis for the legend of Kaguya-hime regarding the couple&#x27;s love story. Emperor Suinin died in 70 AD at the age of 138, and his son Prince &quot;Ootarashihikoosirowake&quot; was enthroned as the next emperor the following year.

==Known information==

Emperor Suinin is regarded by historians as a &quot;legendary Emperor&quot; as there is insufficient material available for further verification and study. Unlike Emperor Sujin, there is less known about Suinin to possibly support his existence. In either case (fictional or not), the name Suinin&quot;-tennō&quot; was assigned to him posthumously by later generations. His name might have been regularized centuries after the lifetime ascribed to Suinin, possibly during the time in which legends about the origins of the imperial dynasty were compiled as the chronicles known today as the &quot;Kojiki&quot;. Suinin&#x27;s longevity was also written down by later compilers, who may have unrealistically extended his age to fill in time gaps. While the actual site of Suinin&#x27;s grave is not known, the Emperor is traditionally venerated at a memorial Shinto shrine (&quot;misasagi&quot;) at Nishi-machi, Amagatsuji, Nara City. The Imperial Household Agency designates this location as Suinin&#x27;s mausoleum, and is formally named &quot;Sugawara no Fushimi no higashi no misasagi&quot;.

While the Ise Grand Shrine is traditionally said to have been established in the 1st century BC, other dates in the 3rd and 4th centuries have also been put forward for the establishment of Naikū and Gekū respectively. The first shrine building at Naikū was allegedly erected by Emperor Tenmu (678–686), with the first ceremonial rebuilding being carried out by his wife, Empress Jitō, in 692. Outside of the Kiki, the reign of Emperor Kinmei ( – 571 AD) is the first for which contemporary historiography has been able to assign verifiable dates. The conventionally accepted names and dates of the early Emperors were not confirmed as &quot;traditional&quot; though, until the reign of Emperor Kanmu between 737 and 806 AD.

==Consorts and children== 
Emperor Suinin had two chief wives (aka Empress), it is recorded in the Kiki that the first empress was named Saho. Not much is known about her other than that her father was Emperor Kaika&#x27;s son and she allegedly died sometime in 34 AD. As with the first empress there is also not much known about Suinin&#x27;s second chief wife Hibasu. She was the daughter Prince Tanba-no-Michinoushi, who was Prince Hikoimasu&#x27;s son and Emperor Kaika&#x27;s grandson. Hibasu&#x27;s third son later became known as Emperor Keikō (the next emperor), she allegedly died sometime in 61 AD. Suinin also had six named consorts with an additional one remaining unknown. Prince Tanba-no-Michinoushi (previously mentioned), was also the father to three of Suinin&#x27;s consorts. In all the Emperor&#x27;s family consisted of 17 children with these variously ranked wives.

<doc id="10452" wikidata="Q329723" url="?curid=10452" title="Emperor Keikō">
<text>, also known as and , was the 12th legendary Emperor of Japan, according to the traditional order of succession. Both the &quot;Kojiki&quot;, and the &quot;Nihon Shoki&quot; (collectively known as the &quot;Kiki&quot;) record events that took place during Keikō&#x27;s alleged lifetime. Keikō was recorded as being an exceptionally tall emperor who had a very large family. During his reign he sought to expand territorial control through conquest of local tribes. He had a very important son named &quot;Prince Ōsu&quot; (Yamato Takeru), who was in possession of the Kusanagi when he died. This treasure was later moved to Atsuta Shrine, and is now a part of the Imperial Regalia of Japan. There is a possibility that Keikō actually lived or reigned in the 4th century AD rather than the 1st, but more information is needed to confirm this view.

Keikō&#x27;s reign is conventionally considered to have been from 71 to 130 AD. During his alleged lifetime, he fathered at least 80 children with two chief wives (empress) and nine consorts. One of his sons became the next emperor upon his death in 130 AD, but the location of Keikō&#x27;s grave (if any) is unknown. Keikō is traditionally venerated at a memorial Shinto tomb (&quot;misasagi&quot;) at Nara.

==Legendary narrative==
The Japanese have traditionally accepted this sovereign&#x27;s historical existence, and a mausoleum (misasagi) for Keiko is currently maintained. The following information available is taken from the pseudo-historical &quot;Kojiki&quot; and &quot;Nihon Shoki&quot;, which are collectively known as or &quot;Japanese chronicles&quot;. These chronicles include legends and myths, as well as potential historical facts that have since been exaggerated and/or distorted over time. The records state that Keikō was born sometime in 13 BC, and was given the name &quot;Otarashihiko-no-mikoto&quot;. He was the 3rd son of Emperor Suinin, and his second empress wife &quot;&quot;. Otarashihiko-no-mikoto was allegedly chosen as crown prince over his elder brother based on a casual question on what they both had wished for. In the former&#x27;s case he said &quot;The Empire&quot; while his elder brother said &quot;Bow and arrows&quot;. Otarashihiko-no-mikoto later ascended to the throne in 71 AD, coming a year after his father&#x27;s death.

Accounts in the &quot;Kojiki&quot; and &quot;Nihon Shoki&quot; are split when it comes to initial territorial expansion during Emperor Keikō&#x27;s reign. In the &quot;Kojiki&quot;, the Emperor is said to have sent his son &quot;Prince Ōsu&quot; (Yamato Takeru) to Kyūshū to conquer local tribes. Alternatively, the &quot;Nihon Shoki&quot; records that he went there himself and won battles against local tribes. Both sources agree that Keikō later sent Yamato Takeru to Izumo Province, and eastern provinces to conquer the area and spread his territory. According to traditional sources, Yamato Takeru died in the . The possessions of the dead prince were gathered together along with the sword Kusanagi; and his widow venerated his memory in a shrine at her home. Sometime later, these relics and the sacred sword were moved to the current location of the Atsuta Shrine.

Emperor Keikō was recorded as , who had at least 80 children from multiple wives. This claim would put him into the category of gigantism if verified, although as with other aspects it was more than likely exaggerated. Other than Yamato Takeru, at least three of Keikō&#x27;s children were ancestors of notable clans. According to tradition, emperor Keikō died in 130 AD at the age of 143, and his son Prince &quot;Wakatarashihiko&quot; was enthroned as the next emperor the following year.

==Known information==
Emperor Keikō is regarded by historians as a &quot;legendary Emperor&quot; as there is insufficient material available for further verification and study. The name Keikō&quot;-tennō&quot; was assigned to him posthumously by later generations. His name might have been regularized centuries after the lifetime ascribed to Keikō, possibly during the time in which legends about the origins of the imperial dynasty were compiled as the chronicles known today as the &quot;Kojiki&quot;. There is a possibility that Keikō&#x27;s era was in the 4th century AD rather than the 1st. This period is concurrent with the Kentoshi having an audience with the Tang Emperor, more evidence is needed though to make any conclusions. Like his father before him, Keikō is also known to have an exaggerated lifespan which is unlikely to be factual. The consecutive reigns of the emperors began to be compiled in the 8th century, and it is thought that age gaps were &quot;filled up&quot; as many lacunae were present. For comparison, verified ages in the 110s have since been documented and recorded as the &quot;oldest in the world&quot;.

While the actual site of Keikō&#x27;s grave is not known, the Emperor is traditionally venerated at a memorial Shinto shrine (&quot;misasagi&quot;) at Nara. The Imperial Household Agency designates this location as Keikō&#x27;s mausoleum, and is formally named &quot;Yamanobe no michi no e no misasagi&quot;. Outside of the &quot;Kiki&quot;, the reign of Emperor Kinmei ( – 571 AD) is the first for which contemporary historiography has been able to assign verifiable dates. The conventionally accepted names and dates of the early Emperors were not confirmed as &quot;traditional&quot; though, until the reign of Emperor Kanmu between 737 and 806 AD.

==Consorts and children== 
Emperor Keikō allegedly had a very large family which consisted of 2 wives, 9 concubines, and more than 80 children (51 of which are listed here). It is now questionable and open to debate though, if these numbers are genuine or not. Some of his listed children might actually be duplicates of the same person. The size of Keikō&#x27;s family also could have been exaggerated over time through legends and word of mouth stories.

<doc id="10453" wikidata="Q316672" url="?curid=10453" title="Emperor Seimu">
<text>, also known as , was the 13th legendary Emperor of Japan, according to the traditional order of succession. Both the &quot;Kojiki&quot;, and the &quot;Nihon Shoki&quot; (collectively known as the &quot;Kiki&quot;) record events that took place during Seimu&#x27;s alleged lifetime. This legendary Emperor is best known for organizing his local governments by making the first appointments of their kind to provinces under his rule. Seimu had only one recorded wife who bore him a single child; he also had a concubine but she had no children. This is in stark contrast to his father, who is said to have had at least 80 children with multiple wives.

Seimu&#x27;s reign is conventionally considered to have been from 131 to 190 AD. An issue ultimately occurred when his only son allegedly died at a young age. Seimu appointed one of his nephews to be crown prince before his death in 190 AD, marking the first of later generations which would cede the throne to a non-direct successor. While the location of Seimu&#x27;s grave (if any) is unknown, he is traditionally venerated at a memorial Shinto tomb. Modern historians have come to the conclusion that the title of &quot;Emperor&quot; and the name &quot;Seimu&quot; was used by later generations to describe this legendary Emperor. It has also been proposed that Seimu actually reigned much later than he is attested.

==Legendary narrative==
The Japanese have traditionally accepted this sovereign&#x27;s historical existence, and a mausoleum (misasagi) for Seimu is currently maintained. The following information available is taken from the pseudo-historical &quot;Kojiki&quot; and &quot;Nihon Shoki&quot;, which are collectively known as or &quot;Japanese chronicles&quot;. These chronicles include legends and myths, as well as potential historical facts that have since been exaggerated and/or distorted over time. The records state that Seimu was born to sometime in 84 AD, and was given the name . It is unknown how he was chosen as crown prince, but Wakatarashihiko later ascended to the throne in 131 AD. Seimu is best known for organizing his local governments by appointing the first provincial governors and district officials. While the details of his system of governing remain elusive, at the time Imperial princes were sent to important places in the provinces. These members are designated as &quot;wake&quot;, which represented their status as a branch of the Imperial family. It has been theorized by Brinkley and Kikuchi that these appointments of local governors were designed to extend the &quot;prestige of the Court&quot;. Those that were eligible included &quot;men of merit&quot;, Imperial princes, or chiefs of aboriginal tribes.

The records state that Seimu had a wife named , who was the daughter of &quot;Take-oshiyama-tari-ne&quot;. Oho-takara bore the Emperor one child, named . Seimu&#x27;s only son appears to have died at a young age as the Emperor appointed Yamato Takeru&#x27;s son as Crown Prince, before his own death in 190 AD at the age 107 years old. His nephew &quot;Tarashinakatsuhiko&quot; was later enthroned as the next emperor in 192 AD. Seimu&#x27;s death marked an end of direct lineage from legendary Emperor Jimmu, and was the first split branch of others that later followed.

==Known information==
Emperor Seimu is regarded by historians as a &quot;legendary Emperor&quot; as there is insufficient material available for further verification and study. His existence is open to debate given this lack of information. If Seimu did exist, there is no evidence to suggest that the title &quot;tennō&quot; was used during the time period to which his reign has been assigned. It is much more likely that he was a chieftain, or local clan leader, and the polity he ruled would have only encompassed a small portion of modern-day Japan. The name Seimu&quot;-tennō&quot; was more than likely assigned to him posthumously by later generations. His name might have been regularized centuries after the lifetime ascribed to Seimu, possibly during the time in which legends about the origins of the imperial dynasty were compiled as the chronicles known today as the &quot;Kojiki&quot;. There is a possibility that Seimu ruled during the first half of the 4th century when Japan became a unified state ruled from Yamato, making these accounts &quot;not improbable&quot;.

While the actual site of Seimu&#x27;s grave is not known, the Emperor is traditionally venerated at a memorial Shinto shrine (&quot;misasagi&quot;) at Nara. The Imperial Household Agency designates this location as Seimu&#x27;s mausoleum, and is formally named &quot;Saki no Tatanami no misasagi&quot;. Outside of the &quot;Kiki&quot;, the reign of Emperor Kinmei ( – 571 AD) is the first for which contemporary historiography has been able to assign verifiable dates. The conventionally accepted names and dates of the early Emperors were not confirmed as &quot;traditional&quot; though, until the reign of Emperor Kanmu between 737 and 806 AD.

<doc id="10454" wikidata="Q179971" url="?curid=10454" title="Emperor Chūai">
<text>, also known as was the 14th legendary Emperor of Japan, according to the traditional order of succession. Both the &quot;Kojiki&quot;, and the &quot;Nihon Shoki&quot; (collectively known as the &quot;Kiki&quot;) record events that took place during Chūai&#x27;s alleged lifetime. Chūai is the first monarch to ascend the throne who was not a son of the previous Emperor as the latter&#x27;s only child died young. He is also noted for having his capital in Kyushu, rather than Yamato like his predecessors. The records state that Chūai had a wife named &quot;Okinagatarashihime-no-Mikoto&quot; (later Jingū), and 2 consorts that all bore him 4 children.

Chūai&#x27;s reign is conventionally considered to have been from 192 to 200 AD. The events leading up to the Emperor&#x27;s death have been subject to interpretation as they involve a vengeful Kami (spirit) indirectly killing Chūai. This event allegedly occurred after the Emperor disrespectfully scoffed at the Kami&#x27;s request. His wife Jingū carried out the Kami&#x27;s request which was to invade Korea, but this has since been considered legendary rather than factual. While the location of Chūai&#x27;s grave (if any) is unknown, he is traditionally venerated at a memorial Shinto tomb, and at a Hachiman shrine.

Modern historians have come to the conclusion that the title of &quot;Emperor&quot; and the name &quot;Chūai&quot; were used by later generations to describe this legendary Emperor. It has also been proposed that Chūai actually reigned much later than he is attested. Emperor Chūai is traditionally listed as the last Emperor of the Yayoi period.

==Legendary narrative==
The Japanese have traditionally accepted this sovereign&#x27;s historical existence, and a mausoleum (misasagi) for Chūai is currently maintained. The following information available is taken from the pseudo-historical &quot;Kojiki&quot; and &quot;Nihon Shoki&quot;, which are collectively known as or &quot;Japanese chronicles&quot;. These chronicles include legends and myths, as well as potential historical facts that have since been exaggerated and/or distorted over time. The records state that Chūai was born to Futaji no Iri Hime sometime in 149 AD, and was given the name . Chūai&#x27;s father was allegedly the legendary prince, Yamato Takeru. He was the first Emperor who was not the child of the previous Emperor, being instead the nephew of his predecessor Emperor Seimu. The title of &quot;Crown Prince&quot; was given to him by his uncle before his death in 190 AD, two years later Chūai became the next Emperor. Unlike his predecessors who had maintained their capitals in Yamato Province, the records state his palace was first located on the northern shores of Shimonoseki Strait, then south of that in Kyushu.

Emperor Chūai is described in the &quot;Kiki&quot; as having been ten feet tall, with &quot;a countenance of perfect beauty&quot;. He had one wife who was named &quot; Okinagatarashi&quot; (aka Jingū), and two consorts who all bore him four children. During the start of his reign, he made progress to modern day Tsuruga, and led an expedition to Kii where he heard news of a revolt. Jingū accompanied him to the west to fight against a tribe in Tsukushi (located in modern-day Fukuoka Prefecture) called &quot;Kumaso&quot;. On the eve of battle though, his wife was suddenly possessed by some unknown kami who advised Chūai to invade and conquer Korea. The Kami gave the reasoning that the &quot;Kumaso&quot; were not worthy of &quot;his steel&quot;. Chūai refused with scorn for a number of reasons which included giving up a military campaign, and doubting that such a land even existed. It is said that the Kami was so enraged by this disrespect, that Emperor Chūai was later killed in a battle that beat down his troops.

The death of the Emperor was kept quiet by Jingū, who vanquished the &quot;Kumaso&quot; soon afterwards in a fit of revenge. Jingū then respected the wishes of the Kami by invading Korea, and subjugated the eastern Korean kingdom of Shiragi. The other two Korean kingdoms at the time voluntarily submitted, and Jingū ascended to the throne as Empress. Jingū&#x27;s occupation of the Korean Peninsula, and reign as Empress are now considered to be legendary rather than factual. The modern traditional view is that Chūai&#x27;s son (&quot;Homutawake&quot;) became the next Emperor after Jingū acted as a regent. She would have been de facto ruler in the interim.

==Known information==
Emperor Chūai is regarded by historians as a &quot;legendary Emperor&quot; as there is insufficient material available for further verification and study. The lack of this information has made his very existence open to debate. There is no evidence to suggest that the title &quot;tennō&quot; was used during the time to which Chūai&#x27;s reign has been assigned. It is certainly possible that he was a chieftain or local clan leader, and that the polity he ruled would have only encompassed a small portion of modern-day Japan. The name Chūai&quot;-tennō&quot; was more than likely assigned to him posthumously by later generations. His name might have been regularized centuries after the lifetime ascribed to Chūai, possibly during the time in which legends about the origins of the imperial dynasty were compiled as the chronicles known today as the &quot;Kojiki&quot;.

The manner in which Chūai died has since been broken down to at least two theories. In his book &quot;Confucianism O - Z&quot;, professor Xinzhong Yao notes that it is possible the late Emperor could have succumbed to illness rather than death on the battlefield. Sources which include Yao, Francis Brinkley, and Kikuchi Dairoku also cite the enemy arrow scenario. While the actual site of Chūai&#x27;s grave is not known, the Emperor is traditionally venerated at a memorial Shinto shrine (&quot;misasagi&quot;) at Nara. The Imperial Household Agency designates this location as Chūai&#x27;s mausoleum, and is formally named &quot;Ega no Naganu no nishi no misasagi&quot;. The Kami (spirit) of Chūai is also enshrined at the Tamukeyama Hachiman Shrine in Nara. Chūai is traditionally listed as the last Emperor of the Yayoi period, who could have in reality ruled in the 4th century. The next era is known as the Kofun period, where more is known about the Emperors based on modern day archaeological evidence.

Outside of the &quot;Kiki&quot;, the reign of Emperor Kinmei ( – 571 AD) is the first for which contemporary historiography has been able to assign verifiable dates. The conventionally accepted names and dates of the early Emperors were not confirmed as &quot;traditional&quot; though, until the reign of Emperor Kanmu between 737 and 806 AD.

<doc id="10455" wikidata="Q317997" url="?curid=10455" title="Emperor Ōjin">
<text>, also known as (alternatively spelled ) or , was the 15th (possibly legendary) Emperor of Japan, according to the traditional order of succession. Both the &quot;Kojiki&quot;, and the &quot;Nihon Shoki&quot; (collectively known as the &quot;Kiki&quot;) record events that took place during Ōjin&#x27;s alleged lifetime. Ōjin is traditionally listed as the first emperor of the Kofun period, and is primarily known for being the controversial son of Empress Jingū. Historians have mixed views on his factual existence; if Ōjin was indeed a historical figure, then it is assumed he reigned much later than he is attested.

No firm dates can be assigned to Ōjin&#x27;s life or reign, but he is traditionally considered to have reigned from 270 to 310. According to the Shinto religion and Buddhism in Japan, Emperor Ōjin is the divine spirit of the deity Hachiman (八幡神). While the location of Ōjin&#x27;s grave (if any) is unknown, he is traditionally venerated at a memorial Shinto tomb. Modern historians have come to the conclusion that the title of &quot;Emperor&quot; and the name &quot;Ōjin&quot; was used by later generations to describe this possibly legendary Emperor.

==Legendary narrative==
The Japanese have traditionally accepted this sovereign&#x27;s historical existence, and a mausoleum (misasagi) for Ōjin is currently maintained. The following information available is taken from the pseudo-historical &quot;Kojiki&quot; and &quot;Nihon Shoki&quot;, which are collectively known as or &quot;Japanese chronicles&quot;. These chronicles include legends and myths, as well as potential historical facts that have since been exaggerated and/or distorted over time. The circumstances surrounding the future emperor&#x27;s birth are controversial as they involve a supposed invasion of the Korean Peninsula as well as a biologically impossible gestation period (3 years). It is said by the Kiki that Ōjin was conceived but unborn when his father Emperor Chūai died. Empress Jingū then became a de facto ruler who allegedly invaded a &quot;promised land&quot; (Korea) out of revenge, then returned three years later to the Japanese mainland to give birth. The records state that Ōjin was born to Empress Jingū in Tsukushi Province sometime in 201 AD, and was given the name . He became the crown prince at the age of four, but was not crowned Emperor until 270 AD at the age of 70. Emperor Ōjin supposedly lived in two palaces which are now located in present-day Osaka. His reign lasted 40 years until his death in 310 AD, in all he fathered 28 children with one spouse and ten consorts. His fourth son &quot; Ōosazaki&quot; was later enthroned as the next emperor in 313 AD.

==Known information==
While the historical existence of Emperor Ōjin is debated among historians, there is a general consensus that he was &quot;probably real&quot;. There is also an agreement that Ojin&#x27;s three year conception period is mythical and symbolic, rather than realistic. William George Aston has suggested that this can be interpreted as a period of less than nine months containing three &quot;years&quot; (some seasons), e.g. three harvests. If Ōjin was an actual historical figure then historians have proposed that he ruled later than attested. Dates of his actual reign have been proposed to be as early as 370 to 390 AD, to as late as the early 5th century AD. At least one Japanese historian has cast doubt on this theory though, by revising a supporting statement given in 1972. In this new narrative Louis Perez states: &quot;only kings and emperors after the reign of Ojin... ...are seen as historical figures&quot;. In either case there is also no evidence to suggest that the title &quot;tennō&quot; was used during the time to which Ōjin&#x27;s reign has been assigned. It is certainly possible that he was a chieftain or local clan leader, and that the polity he ruled would have only encompassed a small portion of modern-day Japan. The name Ōjin&quot;-tennō&quot; was more than likely assigned to him posthumously by later generations.

While the actual site of Ōjin&#x27;s grave is not known, this regent is traditionally venerated at a &quot;kofun&quot;-type Imperial tomb in Osaka. The Imperial Household Agency designates this location as Ōjin&#x27;s mausoleum, and is formally named &quot;Eega no Mofushi no oka no misasagi&quot;. At some point Ōjin was made a guardian Kami of the Hata clan, and is now also deified as Hachiman Daimyōjin. Outside of the &quot;Kiki&quot;, the reign of Emperor Kinmei ( – 571 AD) is the first for which contemporary historiography has been able to assign verifiable dates. The conventionally accepted names and dates of the early Emperors were not confirmed as &quot;traditional&quot; though, until the reign of Emperor Kanmu between 737 and 806 AD.

==Family==

Emperor Ōjin&#x27;s family allegedly consisted of 28 children, which include 2 unnamed princesses from a previous marriage. He had one spouse who bore him a son that would become the next Emperor, as well as 10 consorts.

<doc id="10456" wikidata="Q313119" url="?curid=10456" title="Emperor Nintoku">
<text>, also known as was the 16th Emperor of Japan, according to the traditional order of succession. Due to his reputation for goodness derived from depictions in the Kojiki and Nihon Shoki, he is sometimes referred to as the .

While his existence is generally accepted as fact, no firm dates can be assigned to Nintoku&#x27;s life or reign. He is traditionally considered to have reigned from 313 to 399, although these dates are doubted by scholars.

==Legendary narrative==
The Japanese have traditionally accepted Nintoku&#x27;s historical existence, and a mausoleum (&quot;misasagi&quot;) for Nintoku is currently maintained. The following information available is taken from the pseudo-historical &quot;Kojiki&quot; and &quot;Nihon Shoki&quot;, which are collectively known as or &quot;Japanese chronicles&quot;. These chronicles include legends and myths, as well as potential historical facts that have since been exaggerated and/or distorted over time. The &quot;Kiki&quot; states that Nintoku was born to Nakatsuhime no Mikoto (仲姫命) sometime in 290 AD, and was given the name . According to the &quot;Nihon Shoki&quot;, he was the fourth son of Emperor Ōjin.

==Known information==
Nintoku is regarded by historians as a ruler during the early 5th century whose existence is generally accepted as fact without attributing all of the things he allegedly accomplished. Nintoku&#x27;s contemporary title would not have been &quot;tennō&quot;, as most historians believe this title was not introduced until the reigns of Emperor Tenmu and Empress Jitō. Rather, it was presumably , meaning &quot;the great king who rules all under heaven&quot;. Alternatively, Nintoku might have been referred to as or the &quot;Great King of Yamato&quot;. The name &quot;Nintoku&quot; also might have been regularized centuries after the lifetime ascribed to him, possibly during the time in which legends about the origins of the imperial dynasty were compiled as the chronicles known today as the &quot;Kojiki&quot;.

Although the &quot;Nihon Shoki&quot; states that Nintoku ruled from 313 to 399, research suggests those dates are likely inaccurate. William George Aston notes that if they were factual, Nintoku would be 312 years old in his 78th year of reign assuming that the traditional accounts are correct. Outside of the &quot;Kiki&quot;, the reign of Emperor Kinmei ( – 571 AD) is the first for which contemporary historiography has been able to assign verifiable dates. The conventionally accepted names and dates of the early Emperors were not confirmed as &quot;traditional&quot; though, until the reign of Emperor Kanmu between 737 and 806 AD.

Hidehiro Okada identifies him with Dei of Wa, a king who preceded the better known Five kings of Wa.

==Consorts and children==
According to the &quot;Nihon Shoki&quot;, he was the fourth son of Emperor Ōjin and his mother was Nakatsuhime no Mikoto (仲姫命), a great-granddaughter of Emperor Keikō. He was also the father of Emperors Richū, Hanzei, and Ingyō. His name was .

*First Son: , later Emperor Richū
*Third Son: , later Emperor Hanzei
*Fourth Son: , later Emperor Ingyō

Empress (&quot;Kōgō&quot;): , Emperor Ōjin&#x27;s daughter (second)

== Nintoku&#x27;s tomb ==
Daisen Kofun (the largest tomb in Japan) in Sakai, Osaka, is considered to be his final resting place. The actual site of Nintoku&#x27;s grave is not known.

The Nintoku-ryo tumulus is one of almost 50 tumuli collectively known as &quot;Mozu Kofungun&quot; clustered around the city, and covers the largest area of any tomb in the world. Built in the middle of the 5th century by an estimated 2,000 men working daily for almost 16 years, the Nintoku tumulus, at 486 meters long and with a mound 35 meters high, is twice as long as the base of the famous Great Pyramid of Pharaoh Khufu (Cheops) in Giza.

The Imperial tomb of Nintoku&#x27;s consort, Iwa-no hime no Mikoto, is said to be located in Saki-cho, Nara City. Both &quot;kofun&quot;-type Imperial tombs are characterized by a keyhole-shaped island located within a wide, water-filled moat.
Imperial tombs and mausolea are cultural properties; but they are guarded and administered by the Imperial Household Agency (IHA), which is the government department responsible for all matters relating to the Emperor and his family. According to the IHA, the tombs are more than a mere repository for historical artifacts; they are sacred religious sites. IHA construes each of the Imperial grave sites as sanctuaries for the spirits of the ancestors of the Imperial House.

Nintoku is traditionally venerated at a memorial Shinto shrine (&quot;misasagi&quot;) at Osaka. The Imperial Household Agency designates this location as his mausoleum. It is formally named &quot;Mozu no Mimihara no naka no misasagi&quot;.

<doc id="10457" wikidata="Q329704" url="?curid=10457" title="Emperor Richū">
<text>, also known as was the 17th Emperor of Japan, according to the traditional order of succession. Both the &quot;Kojiki&quot;, and the &quot;Nihon Shoki&quot; (collectively known as the &quot;Kiki&quot;) recorded events that took place during Richū&#x27;s alleged lifetime. This emperor is best known for an assassination attempt on his life by his brother &quot;Suminoe&quot; after the death of their father Emperor Nintoku. Although no firm dates can be assigned to his life, Richū&#x27;s brief reign is conventionally considered to have been from 400 to 405.

During his reign local recorders were allegedly appointed for the first time in various provinces, a royal treasury was established, and court waitresses (Uneme) first appeared. Richū had both a wife and a concubine during his lifetime which bore him 4 children (2 boys and 2 girls). None of his children would inherit the throne as Richū appointed the title of crown prince to his other brother &quot;Mizuhawake&quot;. Richū allegedly died sometime in 405 at the age of 70, and his brother &quot;Mizuhawake&quot; was crowned as Emperor Hanzei in the following year. While the location of Richū&#x27;s grave is unknown, he is traditionally venerated at a memorial Shinto tomb. Modern historians have come to the conclusion that the title of &quot;Emperor&quot; and the name &quot;Richū&quot; were used by later generations to describe him. There is also a general consensus that Richū was not a legendary figure.

==Protohistoric narrative ==
The Japanese have traditionally accepted this sovereign&#x27;s historical existence, and a mausoleum (misasagi) for Richū is currently maintained. The following information available is taken from the pseudo-historical &quot;Kojiki&quot; and &quot;Nihon Shoki&quot;, which are collectively known as or &quot;Japanese chronicles&quot;. These chronicles include legends and myths, as well as potential historical facts that have since been exaggerated and/or distorted over time. These records state that Richū was born to sometime in 336 AD, and was given the name . He was the eldest son of Emperor Nintoku, and was later appointed crown prince by his father during the 31st year of his father&#x27;s reign. (343 AD). When Nintoku died in 399 AD, a period of mourning was followed by a scandal that almost took the Crown Prince&#x27;s life.

===Assassination attempt===
Sometime during the interval before Richū assumed the throne, he sent his younger brother, to make marriage arrangements for his consort . Prince Nakatsu instead passed himself off as his older brother Richū, and seduced Kuro-hime. When the act was done he carelessly left his wrist-bells behind at Kuro-hime&#x27;s house. Richū later discovered these during his first visit to her house, assumed what his brother had done, but decided to take no action against him. Nakatsu on the other hand was fearful of his scandalous actions and plotted to kill his brother that night. He secretly raised a small group of people who surrounded his brother&#x27;s palace. Luckily for Richū, some of his loyal retainers intervened by rescuing the heir and carrying him off to Isonokami Shrine in Yamoto. Nakatsu meanwhile set fire to the besieged palace not knowing of his brother&#x27;s escape.

Richū&#x27;s other younger brother (later Emperor Hanzei) followed him to Yamoto. He was told by Richū though, that unless he proved his loyalty by killing Nakatsu he could not be trusted. Mizuhawake returned to Naniwa and bribed one of Nakatsu&#x27;s retainers to kill him. Nakatsu was utterly defenseless and unprepared as he assumed his brother had fled and disappeared. He was subsequently stabbed to death by his retainer, and Mizuhawake made his way back to Yamoto to report his death. Richū in turn gratefully granted his younger brother &quot;Mura-ahase granaries.

===Reign===
Richū was crowned emperor after his brother&#x27;s failed rebellion had been put to rest in the following year (400 AD). During this time, those who were not executed for their participation in the rebellion were forced to undergo tattooing as a punishment. Kurohime was also officially appointed as a concubine later in that year. Although the two had two sons and a daughter, Richū appointed the title of &quot;Crown Prince&quot; to his brother Prince Mizuhawake (later Emperor Hanzei) in 401 AD. In the year 403 AD, &quot;local recorders were appointed for the first time in various provinces, who noted down statements and communicated writings of the four quarters.&quot; Kurohime died sometime in the following year (404 AD) under unclear circumstances. Its said that the Emperor heard a voice in the wind utter mysterious words in the &quot;great void&quot; before a messenger announced of her death. Richū attributed the cause to an offended deity due to the misconduct of an official regarding a shrine. Princess Kusakanohatabino-hime was appointed empress in the following year (405 AD), and the two gave birth to a daughter (Princess Nakashi). A royal treasury was also established in that year which was managed by two appointed Koreans. Emperor Richū&#x27;s reign ended during its sixth year, when he fell ill and succumbed to disease at the age of 64 or 70. The &quot;kiki&quot; states that Richū was buried in the misasagi on the &quot;Plain of Mozo no Mimi&quot;. His brother &quot;Mizuhawake&quot; was enthroned as the next emperor in the following year (406 AD).

==Historical assessment==
Richū is regarded by historians as a ruler during the early 5th century whose existence is generally accepted as fact. Orientalist scholar James Murdoch includes Emperor Richū in the &quot;earliest non-legendary&quot; sovereigns of Japan, while academic Richard Ponsonby-Fane stated that this &quot;may be termed the semi-historical period&quot;. Scholar Francis Brinkley lists Emperor Richū under &quot;Protohistoric sovereigns&quot;, and notes that rulers from this point forward no longer have reigns of &quot;incredible length&quot;. Others such as author &quot;Joshua Frydman&quot; cite Emperor Richū&#x27;s lifespan as being realistic in length. Richū has also been possibly identified with King San in the &quot;Book of Song&quot; by Confucian scholars and Arai Hakuseki. According to Chinese records, King San sent messengers to the Liu Song dynasty at least twice in 421 and 425.

Scholars William George Aston and Brinkley disagree on the introduction of local recorders. Aston states in his reasoning that the arrival of the Korean scholar Wani did not take place until 405 AD, and &quot;[historians] have not yet got down to time of accurate chronologically&quot;. Brinkley counters this by saying that Wani&#x27;s innovation was &quot;not the art of writing, but, in all probability, a knowledge of the Chinese classics&quot;. Academic Delmer Brown wrote that during Richū&#x27;s reign, court waitresses (Uneme) appeared. There were also storehouses (Kura) built in various provinces, and an &quot;Administrator of State Affairs&quot; from his reign on. It is commonly accepted among historians that Emperor Richū was in his late 60s if not 70 when he died.

There is no evidence to suggest that the title &quot;tennō&quot; was used during the time to which Richū&#x27;s reign has been assigned. It is certainly possible that he was a chieftain or local clan leader, and that the polity he ruled would have only encompassed a small portion of modern-day Japan. It&#x27;s also possible he could have had the title of , meaning &quot;the great king who rules all under heaven&quot;, or &quot;Great King of Yamato&quot;. The name Richū&quot;-tennō&quot; was more than likely assigned to him posthumously by later generations. His name might have been regularized centuries after the lifetime ascribed to Richū, possibly during the time in which legends about the origins of the imperial dynasty were compiled as the chronicles known today as the &quot;Kojiki&quot;.

While the actual site of Richū&#x27;s grave is not known, this regent is traditionally venerated at a &quot;kofun&quot;-type Imperial tomb in Sakai, Osaka. The Imperial Household Agency designates this location as Richū&#x27;s mausoleum, and is formally named . It is also identified as the kofun. Outside of the &quot;Kiki&quot;, the reign of Emperor Kinmei ( – 571 AD) is the first for which contemporary historiography has been able to assign verifiable dates. The conventionally accepted names and dates of the early Emperors were not confirmed as &quot;traditional&quot; though, until the reign of Emperor Kanmu between 737 and 806 AD.

<doc id="10458" wikidata="Q329769" url="?curid=10458" title="Emperor Hanzei">
<text>also known as Emperor Hansho, was the 18th Emperor of Japan, according to the traditional order of succession. Both the &quot;Kojiki&quot;, and the &quot;Nihon Shoki&quot; (collectively known as the &quot;Kiki&quot;) recorded events that took place during Hanzei&#x27;s alleged lifetime. No firm dates can be assigned to this Emperor&#x27;s life or reign, but he is conventionally considered to have reigned from 406 CE to 410 CE. His family included an &quot;Imperial Lady&quot;, and &quot;Concubine&quot; which bore him 4 children. Historians have stated that while nothing remarkable took place during Hanzei&#x27;s brief reign, he did have ranked concubines which is an introduced Chinese custom.

Hanzei died sometime in 410 AD without naming an heir to the throne which caused Imperial ministers to name a successor. While the location of Hanzei&#x27;s grave is unknown, he is traditionally venerated at a memorial Shinto tomb. Modern historians have come to the conclusion that the title of &quot;Emperor&quot; and the name &quot;Hanzei&quot; were used by later generations to describe him. There is also a general consensus regarding Hanzei&#x27;s factual existence.

==Protohistoric narrative==
The Japanese have traditionally accepted this sovereign&#x27;s historical existence, and a mausoleum (misasagi) for Hanzei is currently maintained. The following information available is taken from the pseudo-historical &quot;Kojiki&quot; and &quot;Nihon Shoki&quot;, which are collectively known as or &quot;Japanese chronicles&quot;. These chronicles include legends and myths, as well as potential historical facts that have since been exaggerated and/or distorted over time. It&#x27;s recorded in the &quot;Kiki&quot; that Hanzei was born to sometime in 352 AD, and was given the name . He was the third son of Emperor Nintoku, and a younger brother of Emperor Richū. The phrase &quot;Mizu ha&quot; in the name &quot;Mizuhawake&quot; translates to &quot;beautiful teeth&quot;, as he was said to have beautiful &quot;exceptionally large&quot; &quot;teeth like one bone&quot; all of the same size. Only the &quot;Kojiki&quot; mentions the alleged full grown height of Emperor Hanzei which is said to have been . Shortly after Nintoku died, his elder brother attempted to assassinate his eldest brother (Richū). &quot;Mizuhawake&quot; was able to bribe one of Nakatsu&#x27;s retainers into killing Nakatsu in order to prove his loyalty to the future emperor.

According to the &quot;Nihon Shoki&quot;, Richū bypassed his own children to make his younger brother Mizuhawake crown prince in 401 AD. The given reason is that a &quot;Tajihi&quot; flower fell into a well which gave the name of &quot;Mizuhawake&quot; as the next heir to be. Mizuhawake was proclaimed as &quot;Emperor Hanzei&quot; upon Richū&#x27;s death in 405 AD, and was enthroned sometime in the following year. Shortly after his enthronement Hanzei took as an &quot;Imperial concubine&quot;, and eventually her younger sister as a consort. The two Empresses bore him 4 children which consisted of 2 sons and 2 daughters. During Emperor Hanzei&#x27;s reign, he ruled from the palace Shibagaki no Miya at &quot;Tajihi&quot; in the province of Kawachi (present-day Matsubara, Osaka). During his five-year reign the country enjoyed a time of peace. Emperor Hanzei died peacefully in his palace sometime in 410 AD without naming an heir (crown prince). This issue was later settled by Imperial ministers who selected Emperor Nintoku&#x27;s youngest son Ingyō as the next emperor.

==Historical assessment==
Hanzei is regarded by historians as a ruler during the early 5th century whose existence is generally accepted as fact. Scholar Francis Brinkley lists Emperor Hanzei under &quot;Protohistoric sovereigns&quot;, but notes that his short reign was &quot;not remarkable for anything&quot; except for indirect evidence that Chinese customs were beginning to be adopted by the Japanese court. Scholar William George Aston notes in his translation of the Nihon Shoki that &quot;three ranks of concubines are mentioned&quot;, which at the time were of Chinese origin (ranked concubines). Others such as author Ryoichi Maenosono (Kokushi Daijiten) identify Emperor Hanzei with &quot;King Chin of the Five kings of Wa. According to Chinese records, King Chin sent a tribute to the Liu Song dynasty in 438 AD.

British academic and Japanologist Basil Hall Chamberlain notes in his translation of the Kojiki that no accurate information exists regarding the ancient Japanese measures used to get Hanzei&#x27;s alleged height of . He went on to say that &quot;the English equivalents used in this passage correspond but approximately to the modern Japanese standards&quot;. As for Hanzei&#x27;s ascension, the &quot;Nihon Shoki&quot; mentions that &quot;Tajihi&quot; is now known as the itadori flower. Aston notes though, that the story of a &quot;Tajihi&quot; flower falling into a well is inconsistent with a later passage in the Nihon Shoki which refers to &quot;Tajihi&quot; as a location (not a flower).

There is no evidence to suggest that the title &quot;tennō&quot; was used during the time to which Hanzei&#x27;s reign has been assigned. Rather, it was presumably , meaning &quot;the great king who rules all under heaven&quot;. An alternate title could have also been &quot;Great King of Yamato&quot;. The name Hanzei&quot;-tennō&quot; was more than likely assigned to him posthumously by later generations. His name might have been regularized centuries after the lifetime ascribed to Hanzei, possibly during the time in which legends about the origins of the imperial dynasty were compiled as the chronicles known today as the &quot;Kojiki&quot;.

While the actual site of Hanzei&#x27;s grave is not known, this regent is traditionally venerated at a &quot;kofun&quot;-type Imperial tomb in Sakai, Osaka. The Imperial Household Agency designates this location as Hanzei&#x27;s mausoleum, and is formally named formally named . Outside of the &quot;Kiki&quot;, the reign of Emperor Kinmei ( – 571 AD) is the first for which contemporary historiography has been able to assign verifiable dates. The conventionally accepted names and dates of the early Emperors were not confirmed as &quot;traditional&quot; though, until the reign of Emperor Kanmu between 737 and 806 AD.
