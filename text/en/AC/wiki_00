<text>Edward VI (12 October 1537 – 6 July 1553) was King of England and Ireland from 28 January 1547 until his death in 1553. He was crowned on 20 February 1547 at the age of nine. The only surviving son of Henry VIII by his third wife, Jane Seymour, Edward was the first English monarch to be raised as a Protestant. During his reign, the realm was governed by a regency council because Edward never reached maturity. The council was first led by his uncle Edward Seymour, Duke of Somerset (1547–1549), and then by John Dudley, Duke of Northumberland (1550–1553).

Edward&#x27;s reign was marked by many economic problems and social unrest that in 1549 erupted into riot and rebellion. An expensive war with Scotland, at first successful, ended with military withdrawal from Scotland and Boulogne-sur-Mer in exchange for peace. The transformation of the Church of England into a recognisably Protestant body also occurred under Edward, who took great interest in religious matters. His father, Henry VIII, had severed the link between the English Church and Rome but continued to uphold most Catholic doctrine and ceremony. It was during Edward&#x27;s reign that Protestantism was established for the first time in England with reforms that included the abolition of clerical celibacy and the Mass, and the imposition of compulsory English in church services.

In 1553, at age 15, Edward fell ill. When his sickness was discovered to be terminal, he and his council drew up a &quot;Devise for the Succession&quot; to prevent the country&#x27;s return to Catholicism. Edward named his Protestant first cousin once removed, Lady Jane Grey, as his heir, excluding his half-sisters, Mary and Elizabeth. This decision was disputed following Edward&#x27;s death, and Jane was deposed by Mary – the elder of the two half-sisters – nine days after becoming queen. Mary, a Catholic, reversed Edward&#x27;s Protestant reforms during her reign, but Elizabeth restored them in 1559.

== Early life ==
=== Birth ===
Edward was born on 12 October 1537 in his mother&#x27;s room inside Hampton Court Palace, in Middlesex. He was the son of King Henry VIII by his third wife, Jane Seymour, and was the only son of Henry VIII to outlive him. Throughout the realm, the people greeted the birth of a male heir, &quot;whom we hungered for so long&quot;, with joy and relief. &quot;Te Deums&quot; were sung in churches, bonfires lit, and &quot;their was shott at the Tower that night above two thousand gonnes&quot;. Queen Jane, appearing to recover quickly from the birth, sent out personally signed letters announcing the birth of &quot;a Prince, conceived in most lawful matrimony between my Lord the King&#x27;s Majesty and us&quot;. Edward was christened on 15 October, with his 21-year-old half-sister Lady Mary as godmother and his 4-year-old half-sister Lady Elizabeth carrying the chrisom; the Garter King of Arms proclaimed him as Duke of Cornwall and Earl of Chester. The queen, however, fell ill and died from postnatal complications on 24 October, days after Edward&#x27;s birth. Henry VIII wrote to Francis I of France that &quot;Divine Providence ... hath mingled my joy with bitterness of the death of her who brought me this happiness&quot;.

=== Upbringing and education ===
Edward was a healthy baby who suckled strongly from the outset. His father was delighted with him; in May 1538, Henry was observed &quot;dallying with him in his arms ... and so holding him in a window to the sight and great comfort of the people&quot;. That September, the Lord Chancellor, Lord Audley, reported Edward&#x27;s rapid growth and vigour, and other accounts describe him as a tall and merry child. The tradition that Edward VI was a sickly boy has been challenged by more recent historians. At the age of four, he fell ill with a life-threatening &quot;quartan fever&quot;, but, despite occasional illnesses and poor eyesight, he enjoyed generally good health until the last six months of his life.

Edward was initially placed in the care of Margaret Bryan, &quot;lady mistress&quot; of the prince&#x27;s household. She was succeeded by Blanche Herbert, Lady Troy. Until the age of six, Edward was brought up, as he put it later in his &quot;Chronicle&quot;, &quot;among the women&quot;. The formal royal household established around Edward was, at first, under William Sidney, and later Richard Page, stepfather of Edward&#x27;s aunt Anne (the wife of Edward Seymour). Henry demanded exacting standards of security and cleanliness in his son&#x27;s household, stressing that Edward was &quot;this whole realm&#x27;s most precious jewel&quot;. Visitors described the prince, who was lavishly provided with toys and comforts, including his own troupe of minstrels, as a contented child.

From the age of six, Edward began his formal education under Richard Cox and John Cheke, concentrating, as he recalled himself, on &quot;learning of tongues, of the scripture, of philosophy, and all liberal sciences&quot;. He received tuition from his sister Elizabeth&#x27;s tutor, Roger Ascham, and from Jean Belmain, learning French, Spanish and Italian. In addition, he is known to have studied geometry and learned to play musical instruments, including the lute and the virginals. He collected globes and maps and, according to coinage historian C. E. Challis developed a grasp of monetary affairs that indicated a high intelligence. Edward&#x27;s religious education is assumed to have favoured the reforming agenda. His religious establishment was probably chosen by Archbishop Thomas Cranmer, a leading reformer. Both Cox and Cheke were &quot;reformed&quot; Catholics or Erasmians and later became Marian exiles. By 1549, Edward had written a treatise on the pope as Antichrist and was making informed notes on theological controversies. Many aspects of Edward&#x27;s religion were essentially Catholic in his early years, including the celebration of the mass and reverence for images and relics of the saints.

Both Edward&#x27;s sisters were attentive to their brother and often visited him—on one occasion, Elizabeth gave him a shirt &quot;of her own working&quot;. Edward &quot;took special content&quot; in Mary&#x27;s company, though he disapproved of her taste for foreign dances; &quot;I love you most&quot;, he wrote to her in 1546. In 1543, Henry invited his children to spend Christmas with him, signalling his reconciliation with his daughters, whom he had previously illegitimised and disinherited. The following spring, he restored them to their place in the succession with a Third Succession Act, which also provided for a regency council during Edward&#x27;s minority. This unaccustomed family harmony may have owed much to the influence of Henry&#x27;s sixth wife, Catherine Parr, of whom Edward soon became fond. He called her his &quot;most dear mother&quot; and in September 1546 wrote to her: &quot;I received so many benefits from you that my mind can hardly grasp them.&quot;

Other children were brought to play with Edward, including the granddaughter of his chamberlain, William Sidney, who in adulthood recalled the prince as &quot;a marvellous sweet child, of very mild and generous condition&quot;. Edward was educated with sons of nobles, &quot;appointed to attend upon him&quot; in what was a form of miniature court. Among these, Barnaby Fitzpatrick, son of an Irish peer, became a close and lasting friend. Edward was more devoted to his schoolwork than his classmates and seems to have outshone them, motivated to do his &quot;duty&quot; and compete with his sister Elizabeth&#x27;s academic prowess. Edward&#x27;s surroundings and possessions were regally splendid: his rooms were hung with costly Flemish tapestries, and his clothes, books and cutlery were encrusted with precious jewels and gold. Like his father, Edward was fascinated by military arts, and many of his portraits show him wearing a gold dagger with a jewelled hilt, in imitation of Henry. Edward&#x27;s &quot;Chronicle&quot; enthusiastically details English military campaigns against Scotland and France, and adventures such as John Dudley&#x27;s near capture at Musselburgh in 1547.

=== &quot;The Rough Wooing&quot; ===
On 1 July 1543, Henry signed the Treaty of Greenwich with the Scots, sealing the peace with Edward&#x27;s betrothal to the seven-month-old Mary, Queen of Scots, granddaughter of Edward&#x27;s aunt and Henry&#x27;s sister Margaret Tudor. The Scots were in a weak bargaining position after their defeat at the Battle of Solway Moss in November 1542, and Henry, seeking to unite the two realms, stipulated that Mary be handed over to him to be brought up in England. When the Scots repudiated the treaty in December 1543 and renewed their alliance with France, Henry was enraged. In April 1544, he ordered Edward&#x27;s uncle, Edward Seymour, 1st Earl of Hertford, to invade Scotland and &quot;put all to fire and sword, burn Edinburgh town, so razed and defaced when you have sacked and gotten what ye can of it, as there may remain forever a perpetual memory of the vengeance of God lightened upon [them] for their falsehood and disloyalty&quot;. Seymour responded with the most savage campaign ever launched by the English against the Scots. The war, which continued into Edward&#x27;s reign, has become known as &quot;the Rough Wooing&quot;.

== Accession ==
The nine-year-old Edward wrote to his father and stepmother on 10 January 1547 from Hertford thanking them for his New Year&#x27;s gift of their portraits from life. By 28 January, Henry VIII was dead. Those close to the throne, led by Edward Seymour and William Paget, agreed to delay the announcement of the king&#x27;s death until arrangements had been made for a smooth succession. Seymour and Sir Anthony Browne, the Master of the Horse, rode to collect Edward from Hertford and brought him to Enfield, where Lady Elizabeth was living. He and Elizabeth were then told of their father&#x27;s death and heard a reading of his will.

Lord Chancellor Thomas Wriothesley announced Henry&#x27;s death to Parliament on 31 January 1547, and general proclamations of Edward&#x27;s succession were ordered. The new king was taken to the Tower of London, where he was welcomed with &quot;great shot of ordnance in all places there about, as well out of the Tower as out of the ships&quot;. The following day, the nobles of the realm made their obeisance to Edward at the Tower, and Seymour was announced as Protector. Henry VIII was buried at Windsor on 16 February, in the same tomb as Jane Seymour, as he had wished.

Edward VI was crowned at Westminster Abbey on Sunday 20 February. The ceremonies were shortened, because of the &quot;tedious length of the same which should weary and be hurtsome peradventure to the King&#x27;s majesty, being yet of tender age&quot;, and also because the Reformation had rendered some of them inappropriate.

On the eve of the coronation, Edward progressed on horseback from the Tower to the Palace of Westminster through thronging crowds and pageants, many based on the pageants for a previous boy king, Henry VI. He laughed at a Spanish tightrope walker who &quot;tumbled and played many pretty toys&quot; outside St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral.

At the coronation service, Cranmer affirmed the royal supremacy and called Edward a second Josiah, urging him to continue the reformation of the Church of England, &quot;the tyranny of the Bishops of Rome banished from your subjects, and images removed&quot;. After the service, Edward presided at a banquet in Westminster Hall, where, he recalled in his &quot;Chronicle&quot;, he dined with his crown on his head.

== Somerset protectorate ==
=== Council of regency ===

Henry VIII&#x27;s will named sixteen executors, who were to act as Edward&#x27;s council until he reached the age of eighteen. These executors were supplemented by twelve men &quot;of counsail&quot; who would assist the executors when called on. The final state of Henry VIII&#x27;s will has been the subject of controversy. Some historians suggest that those close to the king manipulated either him or the will itself to ensure a share-out of power to their benefit, both material and religious. In this reading, the composition of the Privy Chamber shifted towards the end of 1546 in favour of the reforming faction. In addition, two leading conservative Privy Councillors were removed from the centre of power.

Stephen Gardiner was refused access to Henry during his last months. Thomas Howard, Duke of Norfolk, found himself accused of treason; the day before the king&#x27;s death his vast estates were seized, making them available for redistribution, and he spent the whole of Edward&#x27;s reign in the Tower of London. Other historians have argued that Gardiner&#x27;s exclusion was based on non-religious matters, that Norfolk was not noticeably conservative in religion, that conservatives remained on the council, and that the radicalism of such men as Sir Anthony Denny, who controlled the dry stamp that replicated the king&#x27;s signature, is debatable.

Whatever the case, Henry&#x27;s death was followed by a lavish hand-out of lands and honours to the new power group. The will contained an &quot;unfulfilled gifts&quot; clause, added at the last minute, which allowed the executors to freely distribute lands and honours to themselves and the court, particularly to Edward Seymour, 1st Earl of Hertford, the new king&#x27;s uncle who became Lord Protector of the Realm, Governor of the King&#x27;s Person and Duke of Somerset.

Henry VIII&#x27;s will did not provide for the appointment of a Protector. It entrusted the government of the realm during his son&#x27;s minority to a regency council that would rule collectively, by majority decision, with &quot;like and equal charge&quot;. Nevertheless, a few days after Henry&#x27;s death, on 4 February, the executors chose to invest almost regal power in the Duke of Somerset. Thirteen out of the sixteen (the others being absent) agreed to his appointment as Protector, which they justified as their joint decision &quot;by virtue of the authority&quot; of Henry&#x27;s will. Somerset may have done a deal with some of the executors, who almost all received hand-outs. He is known to have done so with William Paget, private secretary to Henry VIII, and to have secured the support of Sir Anthony Browne of the Privy Chamber.

Somerset&#x27;s appointment was in keeping with historical precedent, and his eligibility for the role was reinforced by his military successes in Scotland and France. In March 1547, he secured letters patent from King Edward granting him the almost monarchical right to appoint members to the Privy Council himself and to consult them only when he wished. In the words of historian Geoffrey Elton, &quot;from that moment his autocratic system was complete&quot;. He proceeded to rule largely by proclamation, calling on the Privy Council to do little more than rubber-stamp his decisions.

Somerset&#x27;s takeover of power was smooth and efficient. The imperial ambassador, François van der Delft, reported that he &quot;governs everything absolutely&quot;, with Paget operating as his secretary, though he predicted trouble from John Dudley, Viscount Lisle, who had recently been raised to Earl of Warwick in the share-out of honours. In fact, in the early weeks of his Protectorate, Somerset was challenged only by the Chancellor, Thomas Wriothesley, whom the Earldom of Southampton had evidently failed to buy off, and by his own brother. Wriothesley, a religious conservative, objected to Somerset&#x27;s assumption of monarchical power over the council. He then found himself abruptly dismissed from the chancellorship on charges of selling off some of his offices to delegates.

=== Thomas Seymour ===
Somerset faced less manageable opposition from his younger brother Thomas, who has been described as a &quot;worm in the bud&quot;. As King Edward&#x27;s uncle, Thomas Seymour demanded the governorship of the king&#x27;s person and a greater share of power. Somerset tried to buy his brother off with a barony, an appointment to the Lord Admiralship, and a seat on the Privy Council — but Thomas was bent on scheming for power. He began smuggling pocket money to King Edward, telling him that Somerset held the purse strings too tight, making him a &quot;beggarly king&quot;. He also urged the king to throw off the Protector within two years and &quot;bear rule as other kings do&quot;; but Edward, schooled to defer to the council, failed to co-operate. In the spring of 1547, using Edward&#x27;s support to circumvent Somerset&#x27;s opposition, Thomas Seymour secretly married Henry VIII&#x27;s widow Catherine Parr, whose Protestant household included the 11-year-old Lady Jane Grey and the 13-year-old Lady Elizabeth.

In summer 1548, a pregnant Catherine Parr discovered Thomas Seymour embracing Lady Elizabeth. As a result, Elizabeth was removed from Parr&#x27;s household and transferred to Sir Anthony Denny&#x27;s. That September, Parr died shortly after childbirth, and Seymour promptly resumed his attentions to Elizabeth by letter, planning to marry her. Elizabeth was receptive, but, like Edward, unready to agree to anything unless permitted by the council. In January 1549, the council had Thomas Seymour arrested on various charges, including embezzlement at the Bristol mint. King Edward, whom Seymour was accused of planning to marry to Lady Jane Grey, himself testified about the pocket money. Lack of clear evidence for treason ruled out a trial, so Seymour was condemned instead by an act of attainder and beheaded on 20 March 1549.

=== War ===
Somerset&#x27;s only undoubted skill was as a soldier, which he had proven on expeditions to Scotland and in the defence of Boulogne-sur-Mer in 1546. From the first, his main interest as Protector was the war against Scotland. After a crushing victory at the Battle of Pinkie in September 1547, he set up a network of garrisons in Scotland, stretching as far north as Dundee. His initial successes, however, were followed by a loss of direction, as his aim of uniting the realms through conquest became increasingly unrealistic. The Scots allied with France, who sent reinforcements for the defence of Edinburgh in 1548. The Queen of Scots was moved to France, where she was betrothed to the Dauphin. The cost of maintaining the Protector&#x27;s massive armies and his permanent garrisons in Scotland also placed an unsustainable burden on the royal finances. A French attack on Boulogne in August 1549 at last forced Somerset to begin a withdrawal from Scotland.

=== Rebellion ===
During 1548, England was subject to social unrest. After April 1549, a series of armed revolts broke out, fuelled by various religious and agrarian grievances. The two most serious rebellions, which required major military intervention to put down, were in Devon and Cornwall and in Norfolk. The first sometimes called the Prayer Book Rebellion, arose from the imposition of Protestantism, and the second, led by a tradesman called Robert Kett, mainly from the encroachment of landlords on common grazing ground. A complex aspect of the social unrest was that the protesters believed they were acting legitimately against enclosing landlords with the Protector&#x27;s support, convinced that the landlords were the lawbreakers.

The same justification for outbreaks of unrest was voiced throughout the country, not only in Norfolk and the west. The origin of the popular view of Somerset as sympathetic to the rebel cause lies partly in his series of sometimes liberal, often contradictory, proclamations, and partly in the uncoordinated activities of the commissions he sent out in 1548 and 1549 to investigate grievances about loss of tillage, encroachment of large sheep flocks on common land, and similar issues. Somerset&#x27;s commissions were led by an evangelical MP called John Hales, whose socially liberal rhetoric linked the issue of enclosure with Reformation theology and the notion of a godly commonwealth. Local groups often assumed that the findings of these commissions entitled them to act against offending landlords themselves. King Edward wrote in his &quot;Chronicle&quot; that the 1549 risings began &quot;because certain commissions were sent down to pluck down enclosures&quot;.

Whatever the popular view of Somerset, the disastrous events of 1549 were taken as evidence of a colossal failure of government, and the council laid the responsibility at the Protector&#x27;s door. In July 1549, Paget wrote to Somerset: &quot;Every man of the council have misliked your proceedings ... would to God, that, at the first stir you had followed the matter hotly, and caused justice to be ministered in solemn fashion to the terror of others ...&quot;.

===Fall of Somerset===
The sequence of events that led to Somerset&#x27;s removal from power has often been called a &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot;. By 1 October 1549, Somerset had been alerted that his rule faced a serious threat. He issued a proclamation calling for assistance, took possession of the king&#x27;s person, and withdrew for safety to the fortified Windsor Castle, where Edward wrote, &quot;Me thinks I am in prison&quot;. Meanwhile, a united council published details of Somerset&#x27;s government mismanagement. They made clear that the Protector&#x27;s power came from them, not from Henry VIII&#x27;s will. On 11 October, the council had Somerset arrested and brought the king to Richmond Palace. Edward summarised the charges against Somerset in his &quot;Chronicle&quot;: &quot;ambition, vainglory, entering into rash wars in mine youth, negligent looking on Newhaven, enriching himself of my treasure, following his own opinion, and doing all by his own authority, etc.&quot; In February 1550, John Dudley, Earl of Warwick, emerged as the leader of the council and, in effect, as Somerset&#x27;s successor. Although Somerset was released from the Tower and restored to the council, he was executed for felony in January 1552 after scheming to overthrow Dudley&#x27;s regime. Edward noted his uncle&#x27;s death in his &quot;Chronicle&quot;: &quot;the duke of Somerset had his head cut off upon Tower Hill between eight and nine o&#x27;clock in the morning&quot;.

Historians contrast the efficiency of Somerset&#x27;s takeover of power, in which they detect the organising skills of allies such as Paget, the &quot;master of practices&quot;, with the subsequent ineptitude of his rule. By autumn 1549, his costly wars had lost momentum, the crown faced financial ruin, and riots and rebellions had broken out around the country. Until recent decades, Somerset&#x27;s reputation with historians was high, in view of his many proclamations that appeared to back the common people against a rapacious landowning class. More recently, however, he has often been portrayed as an arrogant and aloof ruler, lacking in political and administrative skills.

==Northumberland&#x27;s leadership==
In contrast, Somerset&#x27;s successor the Earl of Warwick, made Duke of Northumberland in 1551, was once regarded by historians merely as a grasping schemer who cynically elevated and enriched himself at the expense of the crown. Since the 1970s, the administrative and economic achievements of his regime have been recognised, and he has been credited with restoring the authority of the royal council and returning the government to an even keel after the disasters of Somerset&#x27;s protectorate.

The Earl of Warwick&#x27;s rival for leadership of the new regime was Thomas Wriothesley, Earl of Southampton, whose conservative supporters had allied with Warwick&#x27;s followers to create a unanimous council which they and observers, such as the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V&#x27;s ambassador, expected to reverse Somerset&#x27;s policy of religious reform. Warwick, on the other hand, pinned his hopes on the king&#x27;s strong Protestantism and, claiming that Edward was old enough to rule in person, moved himself and his people closer to the king, taking control of the Privy Chamber. Paget, accepting a barony, joined Warwick when he realised that a conservative policy would not bring the emperor onto the English side over Boulogne. Southampton prepared a case for executing Somerset, aiming to discredit Warwick through Somerset&#x27;s statements that he had done all with Warwick&#x27;s co-operation. As a counter-move, Warwick convinced Parliament to free Somerset, which it did on 14 January 1550. Warwick then had Southampton and his followers purged from the council after winning the support of council members in return for titles, and was made Lord President of the Council and great master of the king&#x27;s household. Although not called a Protector, he was now clearly the head of the government.

As Edward was growing up, he was able to understand more and more government business. However, his actual involvement in decisions has long been a matter of debate, and during the 20th century, historians have presented the whole gamut of possibilities, &quot;balanc[ing] an articulate puppet against a mature, precocious, and essentially adult king&quot;, in the words of Stephen Alford. A special &quot;Counsel for the Estate&quot; was created when Edward was fourteen. He chose the members himself. In the weekly meetings with this council, Edward was &quot;to hear the debating of things of most importance&quot;. A major point of contact with the king was the Privy Chamber, and there Edward worked closely with William Cecil and William Petre, the principal secretaries. The king&#x27;s greatest influence was in matters of religion, where the council followed the strongly Protestant policy that Edward favoured.

The Duke of Northumberland&#x27;s mode of operation was very different from Somerset&#x27;s. Careful to make sure he always commanded a majority of councillors, he encouraged a working council and used it to legitimise his authority. Lacking Somerset&#x27;s blood-relationship with the king, he added members to the council from his own faction in order to control it. He also added members of his family to the royal household. He saw that to achieve personal dominance, he needed total procedural control of the council. In the words of historian John Guy, &quot;Like Somerset, he became quasi-king; the difference was that he managed the bureaucracy on the pretence that Edward had assumed full sovereignty, whereas Somerset had asserted the right to near-sovereignty as Protector&quot;.
Warwick&#x27;s war policies were more pragmatic than Somerset&#x27;s, and they have earned him criticism for weakness. In 1550, he signed a peace treaty with France that agreed to withdrawal from Boulogne and recalled all English garrisons from Scotland. In 1551, Edward was betrothed to Elisabeth of Valois, King Henry II&#x27;s daughter, and was made a Knight of Saint Michael. Warwick realised that England could no longer support the cost of wars. At home, he took measures to police local unrest. To forestall future rebellions, he kept permanent representatives of the crown in the localities, including lords lieutenant, who commanded military forces and reported back to central government.

Working with William Paulet and Walter Mildmay, Warwick tackled the disastrous state of the kingdom&#x27;s finances. However, his regime first succumbed to the temptations of a quick profit by further debasing the coinage. The economic disaster that resulted caused Warwick to hand the initiative to the expert Thomas Gresham. By 1552, confidence in the coinage was restored, prices fell and trade at last improved. Though a full economic recovery was not achieved until Elizabeth&#x27;s reign, its origins lay in the Duke of Northumberland&#x27;s policies. The regime also cracked down on widespread embezzlement of government finances, and carried out a thorough review of revenue collection practices, which has been called &quot;one of the more remarkable achievements of Tudor administration&quot;.

==Reformation==

In the matter of religion, the regime of Northumberland followed the same policy as that of Somerset, supporting an increasingly vigorous programme of reform. Although Edward VI&#x27;s practical influence on government was limited, his intense Protestantism made a reforming administration obligatory; his succession was managed by the reforming faction, who continued in power throughout his reign. The man Edward trusted most, Thomas Cranmer, Archbishop of Canterbury, introduced a series of religious reforms that revolutionised the English church from one that—while rejecting papal supremacy—remained essentially Catholic to one that was institutionally Protestant. The confiscation of church property that had begun under Henry VIII resumed under Edward—notably with the dissolution of the chantries—to the great monetary advantage of the crown and the new owners of the seized property. Church reform was therefore as much a political as a religious policy under Edward VI. By the end of his reign, the church had been financially ruined, with much of the property of the bishops transferred into lay hands.

The religious convictions of both Somerset and Northumberland have proved elusive for historians, who are divided on the sincerity of their Protestantism. There is less doubt, however, about the religious fervour of King Edward, who was said to have read twelve chapters of scripture daily and enjoyed sermons, and was commemorated by John Foxe as a &quot;godly imp&quot;. Edward was depicted during his life and afterwards as a new Josiah, the biblical king who destroyed the idols of Baal. He could be priggish in his anti-Catholicism and once asked Catherine Parr to persuade Lady Mary &quot;to attend no longer to foreign dances and merriments which do not become a most Christian princess&quot;. Edward&#x27;s biographer Jennifer Loach cautions, however, against accepting too readily the pious image of Edward handed down by the reformers, as in John Foxe&#x27;s influential &quot;Acts and Monuments&quot;, where a woodcut depicts the young king listening to a sermon by Hugh Latimer. In the early part of his life, Edward conformed to the prevailing Catholic practices, including attendance at mass, but he became convinced, under the influence of Cranmer and the reformers among his tutors and courtiers, that &quot;true&quot; religion should be imposed in England.

The English Reformation advanced under pressure from two directions: from the traditionalists on the one hand and the zealots on the other, who led incidents of iconoclasm (image-smashing) and complained that reform did not go far enough. Cranmer set himself the task of writing a uniform liturgy in English, detailing all weekly and daily services and religious festivals, to be made compulsory in the first Act of Uniformity of 1549. The &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot; of 1549, intended as a compromise, was attacked by traditionalists for dispensing with many cherished rituals of the liturgy, such as the elevation of the bread and wine, while some reformers complained about the retention of too many &quot;popish&quot; elements, including vestiges of sacrificial rites at communion. Many senior Catholic clerics, including Bishops Stephen Gardiner of Winchester and Edmund Bonner of London, also opposed the prayer book. Both were imprisoned in the Tower and, along with others, deprived of their sees. In 1549, over 5,500 people died in the Prayer Book Rebellion in Devon and Cornwall.

Reformed doctrines were made official, such as justification by faith alone and communion for laity as well as clergy in both kinds, of bread and wine. The Ordinal of 1550 replaced the divine ordination of priests with a government-run appointment system, authorising ministers to preach the gospel and administer the sacraments rather than, as before, &quot;to offer sacrifice and celebrate mass both for the living and the dead&quot;.

After 1551, the Reformation advanced further, with the approval and encouragement of Edward, who began to exert more personal influence in his role as Supreme Head of the church. The new changes were also a response to criticism from such reformers as John Hooper, Bishop of Gloucester, and the Scot John Knox, who was employed as a minister in Newcastle upon Tyne under the Duke of Northumberland and whose preaching at court prompted the king to oppose kneeling at communion. Cranmer was also influenced by the views of the continental reformer Martin Bucer, who died in England in 1551; by Peter Martyr, who was teaching at Oxford; and by other foreign theologians. The progress of the Reformation was further speeded by the consecration of more reformers as bishops. In the winter of 1551–52, Cranmer rewrote the &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot; in less ambiguous reformist terms, revised canon law and prepared a doctrinal statement, the Forty-two Articles, to clarify the practice of the reformed religion, particularly in the divisive matter of the communion service. Cranmer&#x27;s formulation of the reformed religion, finally divesting the communion service of any notion of the real presence of God in the bread and the wine, effectively abolished the mass. According to Elton, the publication of Cranmer&#x27;s revised prayer book in 1552, supported by a second Act of Uniformity, &quot;marked the arrival of the English Church at Protestantism&quot;. The prayer book of 1552 remains the foundation of the Church of England&#x27;s services. However, Cranmer was unable to implement all these reforms once it became clear in spring 1553 that King Edward, upon whom the whole Reformation in England depended, was dying.

==Betrothal==
After the Rough Wooing and Thomas Seymour&#x27;s plan to marry him off to Lady Jane Grey, the 13-year-old King was betrothed to the five-year-old Elisabeth of Valois, daughter of Henry II of France and Catherine de&#x27; Medici, in 1550. The marriage alliance was negotiated in secrecy, although Pope Julius III became aware of the plan and threatened to excommunicate both Henry and Elisabeth if the marriage went forward. A dowry of 200,000 écus was agreed to, but was never paid due to Edward&#x27;s death before marriage. Elisabeth later married his sister Mary&#x27;s widower, Philip II of Spain.

==Death and succession crisis==
===Devise for the succession===
In February 1553, Edward VI became ill, and by June, after several improvements and relapses, he was in a hopeless condition. The king&#x27;s death and the succession of his Catholic half-sister Mary would jeopardise the English Reformation, and Edward&#x27;s council and officers had many reasons to fear it. Edward himself opposed Mary&#x27;s succession, not only on religious grounds but also on those of legitimacy and male inheritance, which also applied to Elizabeth. He composed a draft document, headed &quot;My devise for the succession&quot;, in which he undertook to change the succession, most probably inspired by his father Henry VIII&#x27;s precedent. He passed over the claims of his half-sisters and, at last, settled the Crown on his first cousin once removed, the 16-year-old Lady Jane Grey, who on 25 May 1553 had married Lord Guilford Dudley, a younger son of the Duke of Northumberland. In the document he writes:

In his document Edward provided, in case of &quot;lack of issue of my body&quot;, for the succession of male heirs only – those of Lady Jane Grey&#x27;s mother, Frances Grey, Duchess of Suffolk; of Jane herself; or of her sisters Katherine, Lady Herbert, and Lady Mary. As his death approached and possibly persuaded by Northumberland, he altered the wording so that Jane and her sisters themselves should be able to succeed. Yet Edward conceded their right only as an exception to male rule, demanded by reality, an example not to be followed if Jane and her sisters had only daughters. In the final document both Mary and Elizabeth were excluded because of bastardy; since both had been declared bastards under Henry VIII and never made legitimate again, this reason could be advanced for both sisters. The provisions to alter the succession directly contravened Henry VIII&#x27;s Third Succession Act of 1544 and have been described as bizarre and illogical.

In early June, Edward personally supervised the drafting of a clean version of his devise by lawyers, to which he lent his signature &quot;in six several places.&quot; Then, on 15 June he summoned high-ranking judges to his sickbed, commanding them on their allegiance &quot;with sharp words and angry countenance&quot; to prepare his devise as letters patent and announced that he would have these passed in Parliament. His next measure was to have leading councillors and lawyers sign a bond in his presence, in which they agreed faithfully to perform Edward&#x27;s will after his death. A few months later, Chief Justice Edward Montagu recalled that when he and his colleagues had raised legal objections to the devise, Northumberland had threatened them &quot;trembling for anger, and ... further said that he would fight in his shirt with any man in that quarrel&quot;. Montagu also overheard a group of lords standing behind him conclude &quot;if they refused to do that, they were traitors&quot;. At last, on 21 June, the devise was signed by over a hundred notables, including councillors, peers, archbishops, bishops and sheriffs; many of them later claimed that they had been bullied into doing so by Northumberland, although in the words of Edward&#x27;s biographer Jennifer Loach, &quot;few of them gave any clear indication of reluctance at the time&quot;.

It was now common knowledge that Edward was dying, and foreign diplomats suspected that some scheme to debar Mary was under way. France found the prospect of the emperor&#x27;s cousin on the English throne disagreeable and engaged in secret talks with Northumberland, indicating support. The diplomats were certain that the overwhelming majority of the English people backed Mary, but nevertheless believed that Queen Jane would be successfully established.

For centuries, the attempt to alter the succession was mostly seen as a one-man plot by the Duke of Northumberland. Since the 1970s, however, many historians have attributed the inception of the &quot;devise&quot; and the insistence on its implementation to the king&#x27;s initiative. Diarmaid MacCulloch has made out Edward&#x27;s &quot;teenage dreams of founding an evangelical realm of Christ&quot;, while David Starkey has stated that &quot;Edward had a couple of co-operators, but the driving will was his&quot;. Among other members of the Privy Chamber, Northumberland&#x27;s intimate Sir John Gates has been suspected of suggesting to Edward to change his devise so that Lady Jane Grey herself—not just any sons of hers—could inherit the Crown. Whatever the degree of his contribution, Edward was convinced that his word was law and fully endorsed disinheriting his half-sisters: &quot;barring Mary from the succession was a cause in which the young King believed&quot;.

===Illness and death===
Edward had become ill during January 1553 with a fever and cough that gradually worsened. The imperial ambassador, Jean Scheyfve, reported that &quot;he suffers a good deal when the fever is upon him, especially from a difficulty in drawing his breath, which is due to the compression of the organs on the right side&quot;.

Edward felt well enough in early April to take the air in the park at Westminster and to move to Greenwich, but by the end of the month he had weakened again. By 7 May he was &quot;much amended&quot;, and the royal doctors had no doubt of his recovery. A few days later the king was watching the ships on the Thames, sitting at his window. However, he relapsed, and on 11 June Scheyfve, who had an informant in the king&#x27;s household, reported that &quot;the matter he ejects from his mouth is sometimes coloured a greenish yellow and black, sometimes pink, like the colour of blood&quot;. Now his doctors believed he was suffering from &quot;a suppurating tumour&quot; of the lung and admitted that Edward&#x27;s life was beyond recovery. Soon, his legs became so swollen that he had to lie on his back, and he lost the strength to resist the disease. To his tutor John Cheke he whispered, &quot;I am glad to die&quot;.

Edward made his final appearance in public on 1 July, when he showed himself at his window in Greenwich Palace, horrifying those who saw him by his &quot;thin and wasted&quot; condition. During the next two days, large crowds arrived hoping to see the king again, but on 3 July, they were told that the weather was too chilly for him to appear. Edward died at the age of 15 at Greenwich Palace at 8 pm on 6 July 1553. According to John Foxe&#x27;s account of his death, his last words were: &quot;I am faint; Lord have mercy upon me, and take my spirit&quot;.

Edward was buried on 8 August 1553 immediately to the west of his grandfather Henry VII&#x27;s tomb in the Lady Chapel at Westminster Abbey, right under the Chapel&#x27;s original altar, with reformed rites performed by Thomas Cranmer. The procession was led by &quot;a grett company of chylderyn in ther surples&quot; and watched by Londoners &quot;wepyng and lamenting&quot;; the funeral chariot, draped in cloth of gold, was topped by an effigy of Edward, with crown, sceptre, and garter. A monument was designed but not realised, leaving Edward&#x27;s burial place unmarked right up until 1966, when an inscribed stone was laid in the chapel floor by Christ&#x27;s Hospital school to commemorate its founder. The inscription reads as follows: &quot;In Memory Of King Edward VI Buried In This Chapel This Stone Was Placed Here By Christ&#x27;s Hospital In Thanksgiving For Their Founder 7 October 1966&quot;.

The cause of Edward VI&#x27;s death is not certain. As with many royal deaths in the 16th century, rumours of poisoning abounded, but no evidence has been found to support these. The Duke of Northumberland, whose unpopularity was underlined by the events that followed Edward&#x27;s death, was widely believed to have ordered the imagined poisoning. Another theory held that Edward had been poisoned by Catholics seeking to bring Mary to the throne. The surgeon who opened Edward&#x27;s chest after his death found that &quot;the disease whereof his majesty died was the disease of the lungs&quot;. The Venetian ambassador reported that Edward had died of consumption—in other words, tuberculosis—a diagnosis accepted by many historians. Skidmore believes that Edward contracted tuberculosis after a bout of measles and smallpox in 1552 that suppressed his natural immunity to the disease. Loach suggests instead that his symptoms were typical of acute bronchopneumonia, leading to a &quot;suppurating pulmonary infection&quot; or lung abscess, septicaemia and kidney failure.

===Lady Jane and Queen Mary===
Lady Mary was last seen by Edward in February, and was kept informed about the state of her half-brother&#x27;s health by Northumberland and through her contacts with the imperial ambassadors. Aware of Edward&#x27;s imminent death, she left Hunsdon House, near London, and sped to her estates around Kenninghall in Norfolk, where she could count on the support of her tenants. Northumberland sent ships to the Norfolk coast to prevent her escape or the arrival of reinforcements from the continent. He delayed the announcement of the king&#x27;s death while he gathered his forces, and Jane Grey was taken to the Tower on 10 July. On the same day, she was proclaimed queen in the streets of London, to murmurings of discontent. The Privy Council received a message from Mary asserting her &quot;right and title&quot; to the throne and commanding that the council proclaim her queen, as she had already proclaimed herself. The council replied that Jane was queen by Edward&#x27;s authority and that Mary, by contrast, was illegitimate and supported only by &quot;a few lewd, base people&quot;.

Northumberland soon realised that he had miscalculated drastically, not least in failing to secure Mary&#x27;s person before Edward&#x27;s death. Although many of those who rallied to Mary were Catholics hoping to establish that religion and hoping for the defeat of Protestantism, her supporters also included many for whom her lawful claim to the throne overrode religious considerations. Northumberland was obliged to relinquish control of a nervous council in London and launch an unplanned pursuit of Mary into East Anglia, from where news was arriving of her growing support, which included a number of nobles and gentlemen and &quot;innumerable companies of the common people&quot;. On 14 July Northumberland marched out of London with three thousand men, reaching Cambridge the next day; meanwhile, Mary rallied her forces at Framlingham Castle in Suffolk, gathering an army of nearly twenty thousand by 19 July.

It now dawned on the Privy Council that it had made a terrible mistake. Led by the Earls of Arundel and Pembroke, on 19 July the council publicly proclaimed Mary as queen; Jane&#x27;s nine-day reign came to an end. The proclamation triggered wild rejoicing throughout London. Stranded in Cambridge, Northumberland himself proclaimed Mary queen—as he had been commanded to do by a letter from the council. William Paget and the Earl of Arundel rode to Framlingham to beg Mary&#x27;s pardon, and Arundel arrested Northumberland on 24 July. Northumberland was beheaded on 22 August, shortly after renouncing Protestantism. His recantation dismayed his daughter-in-law, Jane, who followed him to the scaffold on 12 February 1554, after her father&#x27;s involvement in Wyatt&#x27;s rebellion.

==Protestant legacy==
Although Edward reigned for only six years and died at the age of 15, his reign made a lasting contribution to the English Reformation and the structure of the Church of England. The last decade of Henry VIII&#x27;s reign had seen a partial stalling of the Reformation, a drifting back to Catholic values. By contrast, Edward&#x27;s reign saw radical progress in the Reformation, with the Church transferring from an essentially Catholic liturgy and structure to one that is usually identified as Protestant. In particular, the introduction of the Book of Common Prayer, the Ordinal of 1550 and Cranmer&#x27;s Forty-two Articles formed the basis for English Church practices that continue to this day. Edward himself fully approved these changes, and though they were the work of reformers such as Thomas Cranmer, Hugh Latimer and Nicholas Ridley, backed by Edward&#x27;s determinedly evangelical council, the fact of the king&#x27;s religion was a catalyst in the acceleration of the Reformation during his reign.

Queen Mary&#x27;s attempts to undo the reforming work of her brother&#x27;s reign faced major obstacles. Despite her belief in the papal supremacy, she ruled constitutionally as the Supreme Head of the English Church, a contradiction under which she bridled. She found herself entirely unable to restore the vast number of ecclesiastical properties handed over or sold to private landowners. Although she burned a number of leading Protestant churchmen, many reformers either went into exile or remained subversively active in England during her reign, producing a torrent of reforming propaganda that she was unable to stem. Nevertheless, Protestantism was not yet &quot;printed in the stomachs&quot; of the English people, and had Mary lived longer, her Catholic reconstruction might have succeeded, leaving Edward&#x27;s reign, rather than hers, as a historical aberration.

On Mary&#x27;s death in 1558, the English Reformation resumed its course, and most of the reforms instituted during Edward&#x27;s reign were reinstated in the Elizabethan Religious Settlement. Queen Elizabeth replaced Mary&#x27;s councillors and bishops with ex-Edwardians, such as William Cecil, Northumberland&#x27;s former secretary, and Richard Cox, Edward&#x27;s old tutor, who preached an anti-Catholic sermon at the opening of Parliament in 1559. Parliament passed an Act of Uniformity the following spring that restored, with modifications, Cranmer&#x27;s prayer book of 1552; and the Thirty-nine Articles of 1563 were largely based on Cranmer&#x27;s Forty-two Articles. The theological developments of Edward&#x27;s reign provided a vital source of reference for Elizabeth&#x27;s religious policies, though the internationalism of the Edwardian Reformation was never revived.

<text>The Electronic Delay Storage Automatic Calculator (EDSAC) was an early British computer. Inspired by John von Neumann&#x27;s seminal &quot;First Draft of a Report on the EDVAC&quot;, the machine was constructed by Maurice Wilkes and his team at the University of Cambridge Mathematical Laboratory in England. EDSAC was the second electronic digital stored-program computer, after the Manchester Mark 1, to go into regular service.

Later the project was supported by J. Lyons &amp; Co. Ltd., intending to develop a commercially applied computer and resulting in Lyons&#x27; development of the LEO I, based on the EDSAC design. Work on EDSAC started during 1947, and it ran its first programs on 6 May 1949, when it calculated a table of square numbers and a list of prime numbers. EDSAC was finally shut down on 11 July 1958, having been superseded by EDSAC 2, which remained in use until 1965.

==Technical overview==

===Physical components===
As soon as EDSAC was operational, it began serving the university&#x27;s research needs. It used mercury delay lines for memory and derated vacuum tubes for logic. Power consumption was 11 kW of electricity. Cycle time was 1.5 ms for all ordinary instructions, 6 ms for multiplication. Input was via five-hole punched tape, and output was via a teleprinter.

Initially, registers were limited to an accumulator and a multiplier register. In 1953, David Wheeler, returning from a stay at the University of Illinois, designed an index register as an extension to the original EDSAC hardware.

A magnetic-tape drive was added in 1952 but never worked sufficiently well to be of real use.

Until 1952, the available main memory (instructions and data) was only 512 18-bit words, and there was no backing store. The delay lines (or &quot;tanks&quot;) were arranged in two batteries providing 512 words each. The second battery came into operation in 1952.

The full 1024-word delay-line store was not available until 1955 or early 1956, limiting programs to about 800 words until then.

John Lindley (diploma student 1958–1959) mentioned &quot;the incredible difficulty we had ever to produce a single correct piece of paper tape with the crude and unreliable home-made punching, printing and verifying gear available in the late 50s&quot;.

===Memory and instructions===
The EDSAC&#x27;s main memory consisted of 1024 locations, though only 512 locations were initially installed. Each contained 18 bits, but the topmost bit was always unavailable due to timing problems, so only 17 bits were used. An instruction consisted of a five-bit instruction code, one spare bit, a 10-bit operand (usually a memory address), and one length bit to control whether the instruction used a 17-bit or a 35-bit operand (two consecutive words, little-endian). All instruction codes were by design represented by one mnemonic letter, so that the &quot;Add&quot; instruction, for example, used the EDSAC character code for the letter A.

Internally, the EDSAC used two&#x27;s complement binary numbers. Numbers were either 17 bits (one word) or 35 bits (two words) long. Unusually, the multiplier was designed to treat numbers as fixed-point fractions in the range −1 ≤ &quot;x&quot; &lt; 1, i.e. the binary point was immediately to the right of the sign. The accumulator could hold 71 bits, including the sign, allowing two long (35-bit) numbers to be multiplied without losing any precision.

The instructions available were:
* Add
* Subtract
* Multiply-and-add
* AND-and-add (called &quot;Collate&quot;)
* Shift left
* Arithmetic shift right
* Load multiplier register
* Store (and optionally clear) accumulator
* Conditional goto
* Read input tape
* Print character
* Round accumulator
* No-op
* Stop
There was no division instruction (but various division subroutines were supplied) and no way to directly load a number into the accumulator (a &quot;Store and zero accumulator&quot; instruction followed by an &quot;Add&quot; instruction were necessary for this). There was no unconditional jump instruction, nor was there a procedure call instruction – it had not yet been invented.

Maurice Wilkes discussed relative addressing modes for the EDSAC in a paper published in 1953. He was making the proposals to facilitate the use of subroutines.

===System software===
The &quot;initial orders&quot; were hard-wired on a set of uniselector switches and loaded into the low words of memory at startup. By May 1949, the initial orders provided a primitive relocating assembler taking advantage of the mnemonic design described above, all in 31 words. This was the world&#x27;s first assembler, and arguably the start of the global software industry. There is a simulation of EDSAC available, and a full description of the initial orders and first programs.

The first calculation done by EDSAC was a program run on 6 May 1949 to compute square numbers. The program was written by Beatrice Worsley, who had travelled from Canada to study the machine.

The machine was used by other members of the university to solve real problems, and many early techniques were developed that are now included in operating systems.

Users prepared their programs by punching them (in assembler) onto a paper tape. They soon became good at being able to hold the paper tape up to the light and read back the codes. When a program was ready, it was hung on a length of line strung up near the paper-tape reader. The machine operators, who were present during the day, selected the next tape from the line and loaded it into EDSAC. This is of course well known today as job queues. If it printed something, then the tape and the printout were returned to the user, otherwise they were informed at which memory location it had stopped. Debuggers were some time away, but a cathode-ray tube screen could be set to display the contents of a particular piece of memory. This was used to see whether a number was converging, for example. A loudspeaker was connected to the accumulator&#x27;s sign bit; experienced users knew healthy and unhealthy sounds of programs, particularly programs &quot;hung&quot; in a loop.

After office hours certain &quot;authorised users&quot; were allowed to run the machine for themselves, which went on late into the night until a valve blew – which usually happened according to one such user. This is alluded to by Fred Hoyle in his novel &quot;The Black Cloud&quot;

===Programming technique===

The early programmers had to make use of techniques frowned upon today—in particular, the use of self-modifying code. As there was no index register until much later, the only way of accessing an array was to alter which memory location a particular instruction was referencing.

David Wheeler, who earned the world&#x27;s first Computer Science PhD working on the project, is credited with inventing the concept of a subroutine. Users wrote programs that called a routine by jumping to the start of the subroutine with the return address (i.e. the location-plus-one of the jump itself) in the accumulator (a Wheeler Jump). By convention the subroutine expected this, and the first thing it did was to modify its concluding jump instruction to that return address. Multiple and nested subroutines could be called so long as the user knew the length of each one in order to calculate the location to jump to; recursive calls were forbidden. The user then copied the code for the subroutine from a master tape onto their own tape following the end of their own program. (However, Alan Turing discussed subroutines in a paper of 1945 on design proposals for the NPL ACE, going so far as to invent the concept of a return-address stack, which would have allowed recursion.)

The lack of an index register also posed a problem to the writer of a subroutine in that they could not know in advance where in memory the subroutine would be loaded, and therefore they could not know how to address any regions of the code that were used for storage of data (so-called &quot;pseudo-orders&quot;). This was solved by use of an initial input routine, which was responsible for loading subroutines from punched tape into memory. On loading a subroutine, it would note the start location and increment internal memory references as required. Thus, as Wilkes wrote, &quot;the code used to represent orders outside the machine differs from that used inside, the differences being dictated by the different requirements of the programmer on the one hand, and of the control circuits of the machine on the other&quot;.

EDSAC&#x27;s programmers used special techniques to make best use of the limited available memory. For example, at the point of loading a subroutine from punched tape into memory, it might happen that a particular constant would have to be calculated, a constant that would not subsequently need recalculation. In this situation, the constant would be calculated in an &quot;interlude&quot;. The code required to calculate the constant would be supplied along with the full subroutine. After the initial input routine had loaded the calculation-code, it would transfer control to this code. Once the constant had been calculated and written into memory, control would return to the initial input routine, which would continue to write the remainder of the subroutine into memory, but first adjusting its starting point so as to overwrite the code that had calculated the constant. This allowed quite complicated adjustments to be made to a general-purpose subroutine without making its final footprint in memory any larger than had it been tailored to a specific circumstance.

===Application software===
The subroutine concept led to the availability of a substantial subroutine library. By 1951, 87 subroutines in the following categories were available for general use: floating-point arithmetic; arithmetic operations on complex numbers; checking; division; exponentiation; routines relating to functions; differential equations; special functions; power series; logarithms; miscellaneous; print and layout; quadrature; read (input); &quot;n&quot;th root; trigonometric functions; counting operations (simulating repeat until loops, while loops and for loops); vectors; and matrices.

The first assembly language appeared for the EDSAC, and inspired several other assembly languages:
==Applications of EDSAC==
EDSAC was designed specifically to form part of the Mathematical Laboratory&#x27;s support service for calculation. Ronald Fisher, in collaboration with Wilkes and Wheeler, used EDSAC to solve a differential equation relating to gene frequencies; this represented the first application of a computer to research in biology. In 1951, Miller and Wheeler used the machine to discover a 79-digit prime – the largest known at the time.

The winners of three Nobel Prizes John Kendrew and Max Perutz (Chemistry, 1962), Andrew Huxley (Medicine, 1963) and Martin Ryle (Physics, 1974) benefitted from EDSAC&#x27;s revolutionary computing power. In their acceptance prize speeches, each acknowledged the role that EDSAC had played in their research.

In the early 1960s Peter Swinnerton-Dyer used the EDSAC computer to calculate the number of points modulo &quot;p&quot; (denoted by &quot;Np&quot;) for a large number of primes &quot;p&quot; on elliptic curves whose rank was known. Based on these numerical results, conjectured that &quot;Np&quot; for a curve &quot;E&quot; with rank &quot;r&quot; obeys an asymptotic law, the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture, considered one of the top unsolved problems in mathematics as of 2024.

===Games===
In 1952, Sandy Douglas developed &quot;OXO&quot;, a version of noughts and crosses (tic-tac-toe) for the EDSAC, with graphical output to a VCR97 6&quot; cathode-ray tube. This may well have been the world&#x27;s first video game.

Another video game was created by Stanley Gill and involved a dot (termed a sheep) approaching a line in which one of two gates could be opened. The Stanley Gill game was controlled via the lightbeam of the EDSAC&#x27;s paper-tape reader. Interrupting it (such as by the player placing their hand in it) would open the upper gate. Leaving the beam unbroken would result in the lower gate opening.

==Further developments==
EDSAC&#x27;s successor, EDSAC 2, was commissioned in 1958.

In 1961, an EDSAC 2 version of Autocode, an ALGOL-like high-level programming language for scientists and engineers, was developed by David Hartley.

In the mid-1960s, a successor to the EDSAC 2 was planned, but the move was instead made to the Titan, a prototype Atlas 2 developed from the Atlas Computer of the University of Manchester, Ferranti, and Plessey.

==EDSAC Replica Project==

On 13 January 2011, the Computer Conservation Society announced that it planned to build a working replica of EDSAC, at the National Museum of Computing (TNMoC) in Bletchley Park supervised by Andrew Herbert, who studied under Maurice Wilkes. The first parts of the replica were switched on in November 2014. The EDSAC logical circuits were meticulously reconstructed through the development of a simulator and the reexamination of some rediscovered original schematics. This documentation has been released under a Creative Commons license. The ongoing project is open to visitors of the museum. In 2016, two original EDSAC operators, Margaret Marrs and Joyce Wheeler, visited the museum to assist the project. As of November 2016, commissioning of the fully completed and operational state of the replica was estimated to be the autumn of 2017. However, unforeseen project delays have resulted in an unknown date for a completed and fully operational machine.

<text>Ernest Howard Shepard (10 December 1879 – 24 March 1976) was an English artist and book illustrator. He is known especially for illustrations of the anthropomorphic animal and soft toy characters in &quot;The Wind in the Willows&quot; and &quot;Winnie-the-Pooh&quot;.

Shepard&#x27;s original 1926 illustrated map of the Hundred Acre Wood, which features in the opening pages of &quot;Winnie-the-Pooh&quot; (and also appears in the opening animation in the first Disney adaptation in 1966), sold for £430,000 ($600,000) at Sotheby&#x27;s in London, setting a world record for book illustrations.

== Early life and career ==

Shepard was born in St John&#x27;s Wood, London, son of Henry Donkin Shepard, an architect, and Jessie Harriet, daughter of watercolour painter William Lee. Having shown some promise in drawing at St Paul&#x27;s School, in 1897 he enrolled in the Heatherley School of Fine Art in Chelsea. After a productive year there, he attended the Royal Academy Schools, winning a Landseer scholarship in 1899 and a British Institute prize in 1900. There he met Florence Eleanor Chaplin, whom he married in 1904. By 1906 Shepard had become a successful illustrator, having produced work for illustrated editions of Aesop&#x27;s Fables, &quot;David Copperfield&quot;, and &quot;Tom Brown&#x27;s Schooldays&quot;, while at the same time working as an illustrator on the staff of &quot;Punch&quot;. The couple bought a house in London, but in 1905 moved to Shamley Green, near Guildford.

Shepard was a prolific painter, showing in a number of exhibitions. He exhibited at the Royal Society of Artists, Birmingham—a traditional venue for generic painters—as well as in the more radical atmosphere of Glasgow&#x27;s Institute of Fine Arts, where some of the most innovative artists were on show. He was twice an exhibitor at the Walker Art Gallery in Liverpool, one of the largest provincial galleries in the country, and another at the Manchester Art Gallery, a Victorian institution later part of the public libraries. But at heart, Shepard was a Londoner, showing sixteen times at the Royal Academy on Piccadilly. His wife, who was also a painter, found a home in London&#x27;s West End venue for her own modest output during a 25-year career.

In his mid-thirties when World War I broke out in 1914, Shepard received a commission as a second lieutenant in the Royal Garrison Artillery, an arm of the Royal Artillery. He was assigned to the 105th Siege Battery, which crossed to France in May 1916 and went into action at the Battle of the Somme.

By the autumn of 1916, Shepard started working for the Intelligence Department sketching the combat area within the view of his battery position. On 16 February 1917, he was made an acting captain whilst second-in-command of his battery, and briefly served as an acting major in late April and early May of that year during the Battle of Arras before reverting to acting captain. He was promoted to substantive lieutenant on 1 July 1917. Whilst acting as captain, he was awarded the Military Cross. His citation read:

Later in 1917, the 105th Siege Battery participated in the final stages of the Battle of Passchendaele where it came under heavy fire and suffered a number of casualties. At the end of the year, it was sent to help retrieve a disastrous situation on the Italian Front, travelling by rail via Verona before coming into action on the Montello Hill.

Shepard missed the Second Battle of the Piave River in April 1918, being on leave in England (where he was invested with his MC by King George V at Buckingham Palace) and where he was attending a gunnery course. He was back in Italy with his battery for the victory at Vittorio Veneto. After the Armistice of Villa Giusti in November 1918, Shepard was promoted to acting major in command of the battery, and given the duty of administering captured enemy guns. Demobilisation began at Christmas 1918 and the 105th Siege Battery was disbanded in March 1919.

Throughout the war, he had been contributing to &quot;Punch&quot;. He was hired as a regular staff cartoonist in 1921 and became lead cartoonist in 1945. He was removed from this post in 1953 by &quot;Punch&quot;&#x27;s new editor, Malcolm Muggeridge. His work was also part of the painting event in the art competition at the 1928 Summer Olympics.

Shepard was recommended to A. A. Milne in 1923 by another &quot;Punch&quot; staffer, E. V. Lucas. Milne initially thought Shepard&#x27;s style was not what he wanted, but used him to illustrate the book of poems &quot;When We Were Very Young&quot;. Happy with the results, Milne then insisted Shepard illustrate &quot;Winnie-the-Pooh&quot;. Realising his illustrator&#x27;s contribution to the book&#x27;s success, the writer arranged for Shepard to receive a share of his royalties. Milne also inscribed a copy of &quot;Winnie-the-Pooh&quot; with the following personal verse:

Eventually Shepard came to resent &quot;that silly old bear&quot; as he felt that the Pooh illustrations overshadowed his other work.

Shepard modelled Pooh not on the toy owned by Milne&#x27;s son Christopher Robin but on &quot;Growler&quot;, a stuffed bear owned by his own son. (Growler no longer exists, having been given to his granddaughter Minnie Hunt and subsequently destroyed by a neighbour&#x27;s dog.) His Pooh work is so famous that 300 of his preliminary sketches were exhibited at the Victoria and Albert Museum in 1969, when he was 90 years old.

A Shepard painting of Winnie the Pooh, believed to have been painted in the 1930s for a Bristol teashop, is his only known oil painting of the famous teddy bear. It was purchased at an auction for $243,000 in London late in 2000. The painting is displayed in the Pavilion Gallery at Assiniboine Park in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada, the city after which Winnie is named.

Shepard wrote two autobiographies: &quot;Drawn from Memory&quot; (1957) and &quot;Drawn From Life&quot; (1961).

In 1972, Shepard gave his personal collection of papers and illustrations to the University of Surrey. These now form the E.H. Shepard Archive.

Shepard was made an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in the 1972 Birthday Honours.

== Personal life ==

Shepard lived at Melina Place in St John&#x27;s Wood and from 1955 in Lodsworth, West Sussex. He and Florence had two children, Graham (born 1907) and Mary (born 1909), who both became illustrators. Lt. Graham Shepard died when his ship HMS &quot;Polyanthus&quot; was sunk by German submarine U-952 in September 1943. Mary married E.V. Knox, the editor of &quot;Punch&quot;, and became known as the illustrator of the &quot;Mary Poppins&quot; series of children&#x27;s books. Florence Shepard died in 1927. In November 1943 Shepard married Norah Carroll, a nurse at St Mary&#x27;s Hospital, Paddington. They remained married until his death on 24 March 1976. In 1966, he called the Disney Animation short film &quot;Winnie the Pooh and the Honey Tree&quot; a travesty.

<doc id="10253" wikidata="Q380136" url="?curid=10253" title="Enterobacteriaceae">
<text>Enterobacteriaceae is a large family of Gram-negative bacteria. It includes over 30 genera and more than 100 species. Its classification above the level of family is still a subject of debate, but one classification places it in the order Enterobacterales of the class Gammaproteobacteria in the phylum Pseudomonadota. In 2016, the description and members of this family were emended based on comparative genomic analyses by Adeolu et al.

Enterobacteriaceae includes, along with many harmless symbionts, many of the more familiar pathogens, such as &quot;Salmonella&quot;, &quot;Escherichia coli&quot;, &quot;Klebsiella&quot;, and &quot;Shigella&quot;. Other disease-causing bacteria in this family include &quot;Enterobacter&quot; and &quot;Citrobacter&quot;. Members of the Enterobacteriaceae can be trivially referred to as enterobacteria or &quot;enteric bacteria&quot;, as several members live in the intestines of animals. In fact, the etymology of the family is enterobacterium with the suffix to designate a family (aceae)—not after the genus &quot;Enterobacter&quot; (which would be &quot;Enterobacteraceae&quot;)—and the type genus is &quot;Escherichia&quot;.

==Morphology==
Members of the Enterobacteriaceae are bacilli (rod-shaped), and are typically 1–5 μm in length. They typically appear as medium to large-sized grey colonies on blood agar, although some can express pigments.

Most have many flagella used to move about, but a few genera are nonmotile. Most members of Enterobacteriaceae have peritrichous, type I fimbriae involved in the adhesion of the bacterial cells to their hosts.

They are not spore-forming.

==Metabolism==
Like other Pseudomonadota, Enterobacteriaceae have Gram-negative stains, and they are facultative anaerobes, fermenting sugars to produce lactic acid and various other end products. Most also reduce nitrate to nitrite, although exceptions exist. Unlike most similar bacteria, Enterobacteriaceae generally lack cytochrome c oxidase, there are exceptions.

Catalase reactions vary among Enterobacteriaceae.

==Ecology==
Many members of this family are normal members of the gut microbiota in humans and other animals, while others are found in water or soil, or are parasites on a variety of different animals and plants.

==Model organisms and medical relevance==
&quot;Escherichia coli&quot; is one of the most important model organisms, and its genetics and biochemistry have been closely studied.

Some enterobacteria are important pathogens, e.g. &quot;Salmonella&quot;, or &quot;Shigella&quot; e.g. because they produce endotoxins. Endotoxins reside in the cell wall and are released when the cell dies and the cell wall disintegrates. Some members of the Enterobacteriaceae produce endotoxins that, when released into the bloodstream following cell lysis, cause a systemic inflammatory and vasodilatory response. The most severe form of this is known as endotoxic shock, which can be rapidly fatal.

==Historical systematics and taxonomy==
Enterobacteriaceae was originally the sole family under the order Enterobacteriales. The family contained a large array of biochemically distinct species with different ecological niches, which made biochemical descriptions difficult. The original classification of species to this family and order was largely based on 16S rRNA genome sequence analyses, which is known to have low discriminatory power and the results of which changes depends on the algorithm and organism information used. Despite this, the analyses still exhibited polyphyletic branching, indicating the presence of distinct subgroups within the family.

In 2016, the order Enterobacteriales was renamed to Enterobacterales, and divided into 7 new families, including the emended Enterobacteriaceae family. This emendation restricted the family to include only those genera directly related to the type genus, which included most of the enteric species under the order. This classification was proposed based on the construction of several robust phylogenetic trees using conserved genome sequences, 16S rRNA sequences and multilocus sequence analyses. Molecular markers, specifically conserved signature indels, specific to this family were identified as evidence supporting the division independent of phylogenetic trees.

In 2017, a subsequent study using comparative phylogenomic analyses identified the presence of 6 subfamily level clades within the family Enterobacteriaceae, namely the &quot;Escherichia clade&quot;, &quot;Klebsiella clade&quot;, &quot;Enterobacter clade&quot;, &quot;Kosakonia clade&quot;, &quot;Cronobacter clade&quot;, &quot;Cedecea clade&quot; and an &quot;Enterobacteriaceae incertae sedis clade&quot; containing species whose taxonomic placement within the family is unclear. However, this division was not officially proposed as the subfamily rank is generally not used.

==Molecular signatures==
Analyses of genome sequences from Enterobacteriaceae species identified 21 conserved signature indels (CSIs) that are uniquely present in this family in the proteins (subunit M), twitching motility protein PilT, 2,3-dihydroxybenzoate-AMP ligase, ATP/GTP-binding protein, multifunctional fatty acid oxidation complex (subunit alpha), S-formylglutathione hydrolase, aspartate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase, epimerase, membrane protein, formate dehydrogenylase (subunit 7), glutathione S-transferase, major facilitator superfamily transporter, phosphoglucosamine mutase, glycosyl hydrolase 1 family protein, 23S rrna [uracil(1939)-C(5)]-methyltransferase, co-chaperone HscB, N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanine amidase, sulfate ABC transporter ATP-binding protein CysA, and LPS assembly protein LptD. These CSIs provide a molecular means of distinguishing Enterobacteriaceae from other families within the order Enterobacterales and other bacteria.

* &quot;Atlantibacter&quot; (2016)
* &quot;Superficieibacter&quot; (2018)

==Identification==
To identify different genera of Enterobacteriaceae, a microbiologist may run a series of tests in the lab. These include:
* Phenol red
* Tryptone broth
* Phenylalanine agar for detection of production of deaminase, which converts phenylalanine to phenylpyruvic acid
* Methyl red or Voges-Proskauer tests depend on the digestion of glucose. The methyl red tests for acid endproducts. The Voges Proskauer tests for the production of acetylmethylcarbinol.
* Catalase test on nutrient agar tests for the production of enzyme catalase, which splits hydrogen peroxide and releases oxygen gas.
* Oxidase test on nutrient agar tests for the production of the enzyme oxidase, which reacts with an aromatic amine to produce a purple color.
* Nutrient gelatin tests to detect activity of the enzyme gelatinase.

In a clinical setting, three species make up 80 to 95% of all isolates identified. These are &quot;Escherichia coli&quot;, &quot;Klebsiella pneumoniae&quot;, and &quot;Proteus mirabilis&quot;. However, &quot;Proteus mirabilis&quot; is now considered a part of the Morganellaceae, a sister clade within the Enterobacterales.

==Antibiotic resistance==

Several Enterobacteriaceae strains have been isolated which are resistant to antibiotics including carbapenems, which are often claimed as &quot;the last line of antibiotic defense&quot; against resistant organisms. For instance, some &quot;Klebsiella pneumoniae&quot; strains are carbapenem resistant. Various carbapenemases genes (blaOXA-48, blaKPC and blaNDM-1, blaVIM and blaIMP) have been identified in carbapenem resistant Enterobacteriaceae including &quot;Escherichia coli&quot; and &quot;Klebsiella pneumoniae&quot;.

<doc id="10257" wikidata="Q251090" url="?curid=10257" title="Essendon Football Club">
<text>The Essendon Football Club, nicknamed the Bombers or colloquially the Dons, is a professional Australian rules football club that plays in the Australian Football League (AFL), the game&#x27;s premier competition. The club was formed by the McCracken family in their Ascot Vale home &quot;Alisa&quot; adopting the name of the local borough. While the exact date is unknown, it is generally accepted to have been in 1872. The club&#x27;s first recorded game took place on 7 June 1873 against a seconds team. From 1878 until 1896, the club played in the Victorian Football Association (VFA), then joined seven other clubs in October 1896 to form the breakaway Victorian Football League (known as the Australian Football League since 1990). Headquartered at the Essendon Recreation Ground, known as Windy Hill, from 1922 to 2013, the club moved to The Hangar in Tullamarine in late 2013 on land owned by the Melbourne Airport corporation. The club shares its home games between Docklands Stadium and the Melbourne Cricket Ground. Zach Merrett is the current club captain.

Essendon is one of Australia&#x27;s best-known and most successful football clubs. It has won 16 VFL/AFL premierships, which, along with Carlton and Collingwood, is the most of any club in the competition. The club won four consecutive VFA premierships between 1891 and 1894, a feat unmatched in that competition&#x27;s history. Essendon also hold the distinction of being the only club to win a premiership in their inaugural season (1897). It has struggled to achieve significant on-field success in the 21st century, however, having won its most recent premiership in 2000 and most recent final in 2004.

Three Essendon players—John Coleman, Bill Hutchison, and Dick Reynolds—and one coach, Kevin Sheedy, are classified as &quot;Legends&quot; in the Australian Football Hall of Fame.

Essendon also fields reserve men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s teams in the Victoria Football League and VFL Women&#x27;s, respectively. Since 2022 (S7), it has fielded a senior women&#x27;s team in the national AFL Women&#x27;s competition.

== History ==
=== Formation and VFA years (1871–1896) ===
The club was founded by members of the Royal Agricultural Society, the Melbourne Hunt Club and the Victorian Woolbrokers. The Essendon Football Club is thought to have been formed in 1872 at a meeting it the home of a well-known brewery family, the McCrackens, whose Ascot Vale property hosted a team of local junior players.

Robert McCracken (1813–1885), the owner of several city hotels, was the founder and first president of the Essendon Football Club, and his son, Alex McCracken, its first secretary. Alex later became president of the newly formed VFL. Alex&#x27;s cousin Collier McCracken, who had already played with Melbourne, was the team&#x27;s first captain.

The club played its first recorded match against the Carlton Second Twenty (the reserves) on 7 June 1873, with Essendon winning by one goal. Essendon played 13 matches in its first season, winning seven, with four draws and losing two. The club was one of the inaugural junior members of the Victorian Football Association (VFA) in 1877, and it began competing as a senior club from the 1878 season. During its early years in the Association, Essendon played its home matches at Flemington Hill, but it moved to the East Melbourne Cricket Ground in 1881.

In 1878, at Flemington Hill, Essendon played its first match on what would be considered by modern standards to be a full-sized field. In 1879, Essendon played Melbourne in one of the earliest night matches recorded when the ball was painted white. In 1883, the team played four matches in eight days in Adelaide: losing to Norwood (on 23 June) and defeating Port Adelaide (on 16 June), a combined South Australian team (on 18 June), and South Adelaide (on 20 June).

The club played against the touring British footballers in 1888.

In 1891, Essendon won their first VFA premiership, which they repeated in 1892, 1893 and 1894. One of the club&#x27;s greatest players, Albert Thurgood, played for the club during this period, making his debut in 1892. Essendon (18 wins, 2 draws) was undefeated in the 1893 season.

=== Founding of the VFL to World War I (1897–1915) ===
At the end of the 1896 season, Essendon, along with seven other clubs, formed the Victorian Football League. Essendon&#x27;s first VFL game was in 1897 against Geelong at Corio Oval in Geelong. Essendon won its first VFL premiership by winning the 1897 VFL finals series in a round-robin event. Essendon again won the premiership in 1901, defeating Collingwood in the Grand Final. The club won successive premierships in 1911 and 1912 over Collingwood and South Melbourne, respectively.

=== &quot;Same Olds&quot; ===

The club is recorded as having played at McCracken&#x27;s Paddock, Glass&#x27;s Paddock, and Flemington Hill. It is likely that these are three different names for the one ground, given that McCracken&#x27;s Paddock was a parcel of land that sat within the larger Glass&#x27;s Paddock, which in turn was situated in an area widely known at the time as Flemington Hill. In 1882, the club moved home games to the East Melbourne Cricket Ground (since demolished) after an application to play on the Essendon Cricket Ground (later known as Windy Hill) was voted down by Lord Mayor of the City of Essendon, James Taylor, on the basis that the considered the Essendon Cricket Ground &quot;to be suitable only for the gentleman&#x27;s game of cricket&quot;.

The club became known by the nickname &quot;the Same Old Essendon&quot; from the title and hook of the principal song performed by a band of supporters which regularly occupied a section of the grandstand at the club&#x27;s games. The nickname first appeared in print in the local &quot;North Melbourne Advertiser&quot; in 1889, and ended up gaining wide use, often as the diminutive &quot;Same Olds&quot;.

This move away from Essendon, at a time when fans would walk to their local ground, didn&#x27;t go down too well with many Essendon people; and, as a consequence, a new team and club was formed in 1900, unconnected with the first (although it played in the same colours), that was based at the Essendon Cricket Ground, and playing in the Victorian Football Association. It was known firstly as Essendon Town and, after 1905, as Essendon (although it was often called Essendon A, with the A standing for association).

=== Return to suburban Essendon (1921–1932) ===

After the 1921 season, the East Melbourne Cricket Ground was closed and demolished to expand the Flinders Street Railyard. Having played at the East Melbourne Cricket Ground from 1882 to 1921, and having won four VFA premierships (1891–1894) and four VFL premierships (1897, 1901, 1911 and 1912) whilst there, Essendon was looking for a new home. It was offered grounds at the current Royal Melbourne Showgrounds, Ascot Vale; at Victoria Park, Melbourne; at Arden St, North Melbourne; and the Essendon Cricket Ground. The Essendon City Council offered the (VFL) team the Essendon Cricket Ground, announcing that it would be prepared to spend over £12,000 ($1,009,066 in 2021 terms, according to the Retail Price Index) on improvements, including a new grandstand, scoreboard and re-fencing of the oval.

The club&#x27;s first preference was to move to North Melbourne—a move which the North Melbourne Football Club (then in the VFA) saw as an opportunity to get into the VFL. Most of Essendon&#x27;s members and players were from the North Melbourne area, and sportswriters believed that Essendon would have been taken over by or rebranded as North Melbourne within only a few years of the move. However, the VFA, desperate for its own strategic reasons not to lose its use of the North Melbourne Cricket Ground, successfully appealed to the State Government to block Essendon&#x27;s move to North Melbourne. With its preferred option off the table, the club returned to Essendon, and the Essendon VFA club disbanded, with most of its players moving to North Melbourne.

The old &quot;Same Olds&quot; nickname fell into disuse, and by 1922 the other nicknames &quot;Sash Wearers&quot; and &quot;Essendonians&quot; that had been variously used from time to time were also abandoned. The team became universally known as &quot;the Dons&quot; (from EssenDON); it was not until much later, during the War years of the early 1940s, that they became known as &quot;The Bombers&quot; due to Windy Hill&#x27;s proximity to the Essendon Aerodrome.

In the 1922 season, playing in Essendon for the first time in decades, Essendon reached the final four for the first time since 1912, finishing in third place. In the 1923 season, the club topped the ladder with 13 wins from 16 games. After a 17-point Second Semi-Final loss to South Melbourne, Essendon defeated Fitzroy (who had beaten South Melbourne) in the 1923 Grand Final (then known as a &quot;Challenge Final&quot; due to its different finals format): Essendon 8.15 (63) to Fitzroy 6.10 (46). Amongst Essendon&#x27;s best players were half-forward flanker George &quot;Tich&quot; Shorten, centre half-forward Justin McCarthy, centre half-back Tom Fitzmaurice, rover Frank Maher, and wingman Jack Garden. This was one of Essendon&#x27;s most famous sides, dubbed the &quot;Mosquito Fleet&quot; due to the number of small, very fast players in the side. Six players were 5&#x27;6&quot; (167 cm) or smaller.

In the 1924 season, for the first time since their inaugural premiership in 1897, there was no ultimate match to decide the league&#x27;s champion team – either &quot;Challenge Final&quot; or &quot;Grand Final&quot; – to determine the premiers; instead, the top four clubs after the home-and-away season played a round-robin to determine the premiers. Essendon, having previously defeated both Fitzroy (by 40 points) and South Melbourne (by 33 points), clinched the premiership by means of a 20-point loss to Richmond. With the Tigers having already lost a match to Fitzroy by a substantial margin, the Dons were declared premiers by virtue of their superior percentage, meaning that Essendon again managed to win successive premierships. But the low gates for the finals meant this was never attempted again, resulting in Essendon having the unique record of winning the only two premierships without a grand final.

Prominent contributors to Essendon&#x27;s 1924 Premiership success included back pocket Clyde Donaldson, follower Norm Beckton, half-back flanker Roy Laing, follower Charlie May, and rover Charlie Hardy. The 1924 season was not without controversy, however, with rumours of numerous players accepting bribes. Regardless of the accuracy of these allegations, the club&#x27;s image was tarnished, and the side experienced its lowest period during the decade that followed, with poor results on the field and decreased support off it.

There was worse to follow, with various Essendon players publicly blaming each other for a poor performance against Richmond, and then, with dissension still rife in the ranks, the side plummeted to an unexpected and humiliating 28-point loss to VFA premiers Footscray in a special charity match played a week later in front of 46,100 people, in aid of Dame Nellie Melba&#x27;s Limbless Soldiers&#x27; Appeal Fund, purportedly (but not officially) for the championship of Victoria.

The club&#x27;s fortunes dipped alarmingly—and persistently. Indeed, after finishing third in the 1926 season, it was to be 14 years later—in 1940—before Essendon would even contest a finals series.

=== Dick Reynolds years (1933–1960) ===

After the malaise of the late 1920s and early 1930, the 1933 season proved a turning point in morale despite no finals entries for the entire 1930s. Essendon saw the debut of the player regarded as one of the game&#x27;s greatest-ever players, Dick Reynolds. His impact was immediate. He won his first Brownlow Medal aged 19. His record of three Brownlow victories (1934, 1937, 1938), equalled Fitzroy&#x27;s Haydn Bunton, Sr (1931, 1932, 1935), and later equalled by Bob Skilton (1959, 1963, 1968), and Ian Stewart (1965, 1966, 1971).

Reynolds went on to arguably even greater achievements as a coach, a position to which he was first appointed, jointly with Harry Hunter, in 1939 (this was while Reynolds was still a player). A year later he took the reins on a solo basis and was rewarded with immediate success (at least in terms of expectations at the time which, after so long in the wilderness, were somewhat modest). He was regarded as having a sound tactical knowledge of the game and being an inspirational leader, as he led the side into the finals in 1940 for the first time since 1926, when the side finished 3rd. Melbourne, which defeated Essendon by just 5 points in the preliminary final, later went on to trounce Richmond by 39 points in the grand final.

The Essendon Football Club adopted the nickname The Bombers in April 1940.

1941 brought Essendon&#x27;s first grand final appearance since 1923, but the side again lowered its colours to Melbourne. While Australia had entered World War IIlocated primarily in Europe and Africain 1939, the Pacific Theatre opened in December 1941. Australian sports competition was considerably weakened, with Geelong being forced to pull out of the competition due petrol rationing. Attendances at games also declined dramatically, whilst some clubs had to move from their normal grounds due to them being used for military purposes. Many players were lost to football due to their military service. Nevertheless, Essendon went on to win the 1942 Premiership with Western Australian Wally Buttsworth in irrepressible form at centre half-back. Finally, the long-awaited premiership was Essendon&#x27;s after comprehensively outclassing Richmond in the grand final, 19.18 (132) to 11.13 (79). The match was played at Carlton in front of 49,000 spectators.

In any case, there could be no such reservations about Essendon&#x27;s next premiership, which came just four years later. Prior to that Essendon lost a hard-fought grand final to Richmond in 1943 by 5 points, finished 3rd in 1944, and dropped to 8th in 1945.

After World War II, Essendon enjoyed great success. In the five years immediately after the war, Essendon won 3 premierships (1946, 1949, 1950) and were runners up twice (1947, 1948). In 1946, Essendon were clearly the VFL&#x27;s supreme force, topping the ladder after the home-and-away games and surviving a drawn second semi-final against Collingwood to make it through to the grand final a week later with a score of 10.16 (76) to 8.9 (57). Then, in the grand final against Melbourne, Essendon set a grand final record score of 22.18 (150) to Melbourne 13.9 (87), featuring a 7-goal performance by centre half-forward Gordon Lane. Rover Bill Hutchinson, and defenders Wally Buttsworth, Cec Ruddell and Harold Lambert were among the best players.

The 1947 Grand Final has to go down in the ledger as &#x27;one of the ones that got away&#x27;, with Essendon losing to Carlton by a single point despite managing 30 scoring shots to 21. As if to prove that lightning does occasionally strike twice, the second of the &#x27;ones that got away&#x27; came just a year later, the Dons finishing with a lamentable 7.27, to tie with Melbourne (who managed 10.9) in the 1948 grand final. A week later Essendon waved the premiership good-bye, as Melbourne raced to a 13.11 (89) to 7.8 (50) triumph. The club&#x27;s Annual Report made an assessment that was at once restrained and, as was soon to emerge, tacitly and uncannily prophetic: &quot;It is very apparent that no team is complete without a spearhead and your committee has high hopes of rectifying that fault this coming season.&quot;

The 1949 season heralded the arrival on the VFL scene of John Coleman, arguably the greatest player in Essendon&#x27;s history, and, in the view of some, the finest player the game has known. In his first ever appearance for the Dons, against Hawthorn in Round 1, 1949, he booted 12 of his side&#x27;s 18 goals to create a round one record which was to endure for forty-five years. More importantly, however, he went on to maintain the same high level of performance throughout the season, kicking precisely 100 goals for the year to become the first player to kick 100 goals in a season since Richmond&#x27;s Jack Titus in 1940.

The Coleman factor was just what Essendon needed to enable them to take that vital final step to premiership glory, but even so it was not until the business end of the season that this became clear. Essendon struggled to make the finals in 4th place, but once there they suddenly ignited to put in one of the most consistently devastating September performances in VFL history.
Collingwood succumbed first as the Dons powered their way to an 82-point first semi-final victory, and a fortnight later it was the turn of the North Melbourne Football Club as Essendon won the preliminary final a good deal more comfortably than the ultimate margin of 17 points suggested. In the grand final, Essendon were pitted against Carlton and in a match that was a total travesty as a contest they overwhelmed the Blues to the tune of 73 points, 18.17 (125) to 6.16 (52). Best for the Dons included pacy aboriginal half-back flanker Norm McDonald, ruckman Bob McLure, and rovers Bill Hutchinson and Ron McEwin. John Coleman also did well, registering six goals.

A year later, in 1950, Essendon were—if anything—even more dominant, defeating the North Melbourne Football Club in both the Second Semi-Final and the Grand Final to secure consecutive VFL premierships for the third time. Best afield in the 1950 Grand Final, in what was officially his swan song as a player, was captain-coach Dick Reynolds, who received sterling support from the likes of Norm McDonald, ruckman/back pocket Wally May, back pocket Les Gardiner, and ruckman McLure.

With Reynolds, aka &#x27;King Richard&#x27;, still holding court as coach in 1951, albeit now in a non-playing capacity, Essendon seemed on course for a third consecutive flag, but a controversial four-week suspension dished out to John Coleman on the eve of the finals effectively destroyed their chances. Coleman was reported for retaliation after twice being struck by his direct Carlton opponent, Harry Caspar, and without him the Dons were rated a four-goals-poorer team. Nevertheless, they still managed to battle their way to a 6th successive grand final with wins over Footscray by 8 points in the first semi-final and Collingwood by 2 points in the preliminary final.

The Dons sustained numerous injuries in the preliminary final, and the selectors sprang a surprise on Grand Final day by naming the officially retired Dick Reynolds as 20th man. Reynolds was powerless to prevent the inevitable; although leading at half-time, Geelong kicked five goals to Essendon&#x27;s two points in the third quarter to set up victory by 11 points.

Essendon slumped to 8th in 1952, but Coleman was in blistering form, managing 103 goals for the year. Hugh Buggy noted in &quot;The Argus&quot;: &quot;It was the wettest season for twenty-two years and Coleman showed that since the war he was without peer in the art of goal kicking.&quot;

Two seasons later, Coleman&#x27;s career was ended after he dislocated a knee during the Round 8 clash with the North Melbourne Football Club at Essendon. Aged just 25, he had kicked 537 goals in only 98 VFL games in what was generally a fairly low-scoring period for the game. His meteoric rise and fall were clearly the stuff of legend, and few (if any) players, either before or since, have had such an immense impact over so brief a period.

According to Alf Brown, football writer for &quot;The Herald&quot;:
::(Coleman) had all football&#x27;s gifts. He was courageous, a long, straight kick, he had a shrewd football brain and, above all, he was a spectacular, thrilling mark.

Somewhat more colourfully, R.S. Whittington suggested:
::&quot;Had he been a trapeze artist in a strolling circus, Coleman could have dispensed with the trapeze.&quot;

Without Coleman, Essendon&#x27;s fortunes plummeted, and there were to be no further premierships in the 1950s. The nearest miss came in 1957 when the Bombers (as they were popularly known by this time) earned premiership favouritism after a superb 16-point Second Semi-Final defeat of Melbourne—only to lose by over 10 goals against the same side a fortnight later.

1959 saw another grand final loss to Melbourne, this time by 37 points, but the fact that the average age of the Essendon side was only 22 was seen as providing considerable cause for optimism. However, it was to take another three years, and a change of coach, before the team&#x27;s obvious potential was translated into tangible success.

=== Post-Reynolds era and the &quot;Slugging Seventies&quot; (1961–1980) ===
John Coleman started his coaching career at Essendon in 1961, thus ending the Dick Reynolds era at the club. In the same year, Essendon finished the season mid-table, and supporters were not expecting too much for the following season. However, the club blitzed the opposition in 1962, losing only two matches and finishing top of the table. Both losses were to the previous year&#x27;s grand finalists. The finals posed no problems for the resurgent Dons, easily accounting for Carlton in the season&#x27;s climax, winning the 1962 Premiership by 32 points. This was a remarkable result for Coleman, who, in just his second season of coaching, claimed the ultimate prize in Australian football. As so often is the case after a flag, the following two years were below standard. A further premiership in 1965 (won from 4th position on the ladder) was also unexpected due to periods of poor form during the 1965 season. The Bombers were a different club when the finals came around, but some of the credit for the improvement was given to the influence of Brian Sampson and Ted Fordham during the finals. Coleman&#x27;s time as coach turned out to be much like his playing career: highly successful but cut short when he had to stand down due to health problems in 1967. Only six years later, on the eve of the 1973 season, he died of a heart attack at just 44 years of age.

Following Coleman&#x27;s retirement, the club experienced tough times on and off the field. Finals appearances were rare for the side, which was often in contention for the wooden spoon. Essendon did manage to make the 1968 VFL Grand Final, but it lost to Carlton by just three points and did not make it back to the big stage for a 15 years.

During the period from 1968 until 1980, five different coaches were tried, with none lasting longer than four years. Off the field, the club went through troubled times as well. In 1970, five players went on strike before the season even began, demanding higher payments. Essendon did make the finals in 1972 and 1973 under the autocratic direction of Des Tuddenham (Collingwood), but they were beaten badly in successive elimination finals by St. Kilda and did not taste finals action again until the very end of the decade. The 1970s&#x27; Essendon sides were involved in many rough and tough encounters under Tuddenham, who himself came to loggerheads with Ron Barassi at a quarter-time huddle where both coaches exchanged heated words. Essendon had tough but talented players with the likes of &quot;Rotten Ronnie&quot; Ron Andrews and experienced players such as Barry Davis, Ken Fletcher, Geoff Blethyn, Neville Fields and West Australian import Graham Moss. In May 1974, a controversial half-time all-in-brawl with Richmond at Windy Hill and a 1975 encounter with Carlton were testimony of the era. Following the Carlton match, the &quot;Herald&quot; described Windy Hill as &quot;Boot Hill&quot; because of the extent of the fights and the high number of reported players (eight in all—four from Carlton and four from Essendon). The peak of these incidents occurred in 1980 with new recruit Phil Carman making headlines for head-butting an umpire. The tribunal suspended him for sixteen weeks, and although most people thought this was a fair (or even lenient) sentence, he took his case to the supreme court, gathering even more unwanted publicity for the club. Despite this, the club had recruited many talented young players in the late 1970s who emerged as club greats. Three of those young players were Simon Madden, Tim Watson and Paul Van Der Haar. Terry Daniher and his brother Neale came via a trade with South Melbourne, and Roger Merrett joined soon afterwards to form the nucleus of what would become the formidable Essendon sides of the 1980s. This raw but talented group of youngsters took Essendon to an elimination final in 1979 under Barry Davis but were again thrashed in an Elimination Final, this time at the hands of Fitzroy. Davis resigned at the end of the 1980 season after missing out on a finals appearance.

One of the few highlights for Essendon supporters during this time was when Graham Moss won the 1976 Brownlow Medal; he was the only Bomber to do so in a 40-year span from 1953 to 1993. Even that was bittersweet, as he quit VFL football to move back to his native Western Australia, where Moss finished out his career as a player and coach at Claremont Football Club. In many ways, Moss&#x27;s career reflects Essendon&#x27;s mixed fortunes during the decade.

=== Kevin Sheedy era (1981–2007) ===
Former Richmond player Kevin Sheedy started as head coach in 1981.

Essendon reached the Grand Final in 1983, the first time since 1968. Hawthorn won by a then record 83 points.

In 1984, Essendon won the pre-season competition and completed the regular season on top of the ladder. The club played, and beat, Hawthorn in the 1984 VFL Grand Final to win their 13th premiership—their first since 1965. The teams met again in the 1985 Grand Final, which Essendon also won. At the start of 1986, Essendon were considered unbackable for three successive flags, but a succession of injuries to key players Paul Van der Haar (only fifteen games from 1986 to 1988), Tim Watson, Darren Williams, Roger Merrett and Simon Madden led the club to win only eight of its last eighteen games in 1986 and only nine games (plus a draw with Geelong) in 1987. In July 1987, the Bombers suffered a humiliation at the hands of Sydney, who fell two points short of scoring the then highest score in VFL history.

In 1988, Essendon made a rebound to sixth place with twelve wins, including a 140-point thrashing of Brisbane where they had a record sixteen individual goalkickers. In 1989, they rebounded further to second on the ladder with only five losses and thrashed Geelong in the Qualifying Final. However, after a fiery encounter with Hawthorn ended in a convincing defeat, the Bombers were no match for Geelong next week.

In 1990, Essendon were pace-setters almost from the start, but a disruption from the Qualifying Final draw between Collingwood and West Coast was a blow from which they never recovered. The Magpies comprehensively thrashed them in both the second semi-final and the grand final.

Following the 1991 season, Essendon moved its home games from its traditional home ground at Windy Hill to the larger and newly renovated MCG. This move generated large increases in game attendance, membership and revenue for the club. The club&#x27;s training and administrative base remained at Windy Hill until 2013.

Following the retirement of Tim Watson and Simon Madden in the early 1990s, the team was built on new players such as Gavin Wanganeen, Joe Misiti, Mark Mercuri, Michael Long, Dustin Fletcher (son of Ken) and James Hird, who was taken at No. 79 in the 1990 draft. This side became known as the &quot;Baby Bombers&quot;, as the core of the side was made up of young players early in their careers.

The team won the 1993 Grand Final against Carlton and that same year, Gavin Wanganeen won the Brownlow Medal, the first awarded to an Essendon player since 1976. Three years later, James Hird was jointly awarded the medal with Michael Voss of Brisbane.

In 2000, the club shifted the majority of its home games to the newly opened Docklands Stadium, signing a 25-year deal to play seven home matches per year at the venue, with the other four remaining at the MCG. The season was one of the most successful by any team in VFL/AFL history, and the club opened with 20 consecutive wins before they lost to the Western Bulldogs in round 21. The team went on to win their 16th premiership, defeating , thereby completing the most dominant single season in AFL/VFL history. The defeat to the Bulldogs was the only defeat for Essendon throughout the entire calendar year (Essendon also won the 2000 pre-season competition).

Essendon was less successful after 2001. Lucrative contracts to a number of premiership players had caused serious pressure on the club&#x27;s salary cap, forcing the club to trade several key players. Blake Caracella, Chris Heffernan, Justin Blumfield, Gary Moorcroft and Damien Hardwick had all departed by the end of 2002; in 2004, Mark Mercuri, Sean Wellman and Joe Misiti retired. The club remained competitive; however, they could progress no further than the second week of the finals each year for the years of 2002, 2003, and 2004. Sheedy signed a new three-year contract at the end of 2004.
In 2005, Essendon missed the finals for the first time since 1997, and in 2006, despite a first-round 27-point thrashing of defending premiers in which newly appointed captain Matthew Lloyd kicked eight goals playing on Leo Barry, the Bombers were uncompetitive for the majority of the season, partially due to Lloyd suffering a season-ending hamstring injuring in Round 3, recording only three wins and one draw from twenty-two games to suffer its worst season since 1933, as well as recording the least-ever number of votes collectively as a team at the 2006 Brownlow Medal count. In Lloyd&#x27;s absence, David Hille was appointed captain for the remainder of the season. The club improved its on-field position in 2007 but again missed the finals.

=== On-field woes and subsequent relocation to Melbourne Airport (2008–2013) ===

Sheedy&#x27;s contract was not renewed after 2007, ending his 27-year tenure as Essendon coach. Matthew Knights replaced Sheedy as coach, and coached the club for three seasons, reaching the finals once—an eighth-place finish in 2009 at the expense of reigning premiers . On 29 August 2010, shortly after the end of the 2010 home-and-away season, Knights was dismissed as coach.
On 28 September 2010, former captain James Hird was named as Essendon&#x27;s new coach from 2011 on a four-year deal. Dual-premiership-winning coach with and triple-premiership-winning player with Essendon Mark Thompson later joined Hird on the coaching panel. In his first season, Essendon finished eighth. The club started strongly in 2012, sitting fourth with a 10–3 record at the halfway mark of the season, but won only one more match for the season, finishing eleventh to miss the finals.

In 2013, the club moved its training and administrative base to The Hangar, a new facility in the suburb of Melbourne Airport which it had developed in conjunction with the Australian Paralympic Committee. Essendon holds a 37-year lease at the facility and maintains a lease at Windy Hill to use the venue for home matches for its reserves team in the Victorian Football League as well as for a social club and merchandise store on the site.

=== ASADA/WADA investigation (2013–2016) ===

During 2013, the club was investigated by the AFL and the Australian Sports Anti-Doping Authority (ASADA) over its 2012 player supplements and sports science program, most specifically over allegations into illegal use of peptide supplements. An internal review found it to have &quot;established a supplements program that was experimental, inappropriate and inadequately vetted and controlled&quot;, and on 27 August 2013, the club was found guilty of bringing the game into disrepute for this reason. Among its penalties, the club was fined A$2 million, stripped of early draft picks in the following two drafts, and forfeited its place in the 2013 finals series (having originally finished seventh on the ladder); Hird was suspended from coaching for twelve months. Several office-bearers also resigned their posts during the controversy, including chairman David Evans and CEO Ian Robson.

In the midst of the supplements saga, assistant coach Mark Thompson took over as coach for the 2014 season during Hird&#x27;s suspension. He led the club back to the finals for a seventh-place finish but in a tense second elimination final against archrivals North Melbourne, the Bombers led by as much as 27 points at half time before a resurgent Kangaroos side came back and won the game by 12 points. After the 2014 season, Mark Thompson left the club to make way for Hird&#x27;s return to the senior coaching role.

In June 2014, thirty-four players were issued show-cause notices alleging the use of banned peptide Thymosin beta-4 during the program. The players faced the AFL Anti-Doping Tribunal over the 2014/15 offseason, and on 31 March 2015 the tribunal returned a not guilty verdict, determining that it was &quot;not comfortably satisfied&quot; that the players had been administered the peptide.

Hird returned as senior coach for the 2015 season, and after a strong start, the club&#x27;s form severely declined after the announcement that WADA would appeal the decision of the AFL Anti-Doping Tribunal. The effect of the appeal on the team&#x27;s morale was devastating and they went on to win only six games for the year. Under extreme pressure, Hird resigned on 18 August 2015 following a disastrous 112-point loss to Adelaide. Former West Coast Eagles premiership coach John Worsfold was appointed as the new senior coach on a three-year contract.

On 12 January 2016 the Court of Arbitration for Sport overruled the AFL anti-doping tribunal&#x27;s decision, deeming that 34 past and present players of the Essendon Football Club, took the banned substance Thymosin Beta-4. As a result, all 34 players, 12 of which were still at the club, were given two-year suspensions. However, all suspensions were effectively less due to players having previously taken part in provisional suspensions undertaken during the 2014/2015 off-season.
As a result, Essendon contested the 2016 season with twelve of its regular senior players under suspension. In order for the club to remain competitive, the AFL granted Essendon the ability to upgrade all five of their rookie listed players and to sign an additional ten players to cover the loss of the suspended players for the season.

Due to this unprecedented situation, many in the football community predicted the club would go through the 2016 AFL season without a win; however, they were able to win three matches: against , and in rounds 2, 21 and 23 respectively. The absence of its most experienced players also allowed the development of its young players, with Zach Merrett and Orazio Fantasia having breakout years, with Darcy Parish and Anthony McDonald-Tipungwuti impressing in their debut seasons. Merrett acted as captain in the side&#x27;s round 21 win over the Suns. The club eventually finished on the bottom of the ladder and thus claimed its first wooden spoon since 1933.

=== Post-investigation (2017–2022) ===

Essendon made their final financial settlement related to the supplements saga in September 2017, just before finals started. They also improved vastly on their 2016 performance, finishing 7th in the home-and-away season and becoming the first team since in 2011 to go from wooden spooner to a finals appearance, but they ultimately lost their only final to .

The 2017 season was also capped off by the retirement of much-loved club legend and ex-captain Jobe Watson, midfielder Brent Stanton, and ex-Geelong star James Kelly, who later took up a development coach role at the club. Midfielder Heath Hocking, who played 126 games for the club, was delisted.

Expectations were high for the 2018 season, with the club having an outstanding offseason. The recruitment of Jake Stringer, Adam Saad and Devon Smith from the Western Bulldogs, Gold Coast Suns and Greater Western Sydney Giants respectively was expected to throw Essendon firmly into premiership contention.

After beating the previous year&#x27;s runner up (which went on to beat reigning premiers the following round) in round one, Essendon&#x27;s form slumped severely, only winning one game out of the next seven rounds and losing to the then-winless Carlton in round eight. Senior assistant coach Mark Neeld was sacked by the club the following Monday.

The team&#x27;s form improved sharply after this, recording wins against top-eight sides Geelong, GWS, eventual premiers West Coast, and Sydney, winning ten out of the last 13 games of the season. However, the mid-season revival was short-lived, with a loss to reigning premiers by eight points in round 22 ending any hopes they had of reaching the finals.

The 2018 season was capped off by the club not offering veteran Brendon Goddard a new contract for 2019.

Essendon acquired Dylan Shiel from in one of the most high-profile trades of the 2018 AFL Trade Period. The Bombers had inconsistent form throughout the 2019 season but qualified for the finals for the second time in three seasons, finishing eighth on the ladder with 12 wins and 10 losses. The Bombers, however, were no match for the West Coast Eagles in the first elimination final and lost by 55 points to end their season. The defeat extended their 15-year finals-winning drought, having not won a final since 2004.

Following the end of the 2019 season, assistant coach Ben Rutten was announced as John Worsfold&#x27;s successor as senior coach, effective at the end of the 2020 AFL season. Rutten effectively shared co-coaching duties with Worsfold during the 2020 season.

2020 was a particularly disappointing year for the club. The Bombers failed to make the finals, finishing thirteenth on the AFL ladder with just six wins and a draw from 17 games. Conor McKenna became the first AFL player to test positive to COVID-19 during the pandemic. A number of players also left the club at the end of the 2020 season, including Joe Daniher, Conor McKenna, Adam Saad and Orazio Fantasia. This also marked 20 years since their last premiership win, a new record for the club&#x27;s longest premiership drought, with the previous record of 19 years from 1965–1984 being dethroned.

With Rutten solely at the helm in 2021, Essendon improved significantly from the previous year and returned to the finals, finishing eighth on the ladder with 11 wins and 11 losses; and, despite having beaten the Western Bulldogs towards the end of the regular season, the Bombers would lose to the same team by 49 points in the first elimination final.

Season 2022 was the club&#x27;s 150th anniversary. Hopes were high, with some even predicting Essendon to break their 21-year premiership drought. However, these predictions proved drastically wrong, as the Bombers went on to finish 15th, winning only 7 games with a percentage of 83.2%. This poor performance placed Rutten&#x27;s position under scrutiny, and after a late attempt to lure former Hawthorn coach Alastair Clarkson failed, Rutten was unceremoniously sacked. He was replaced by former AFL General Manager of Football and North Melbourne coach Brad Scott. As a result of the 2022 season&#x27;s turmoil, board members such as former CEO Xavier Campbell, former president Paul Brasher, former player Simon Madden, and Peter Allen left their roles. Campbell was replaced by Andrew Thorburn, who was pressured into resignation after only one day in the role due to his simultaneous position as a board member of the conservative City on the Hill Church Movement—whose controversial teachings conflicted with Essendon&#x27;s progressive values—was made public. Craig Vozzo replaced Thorburn in November 2022.

Anthony McDonald-Tipungwuti, Devon Smith and Michael Hurley announced their retirements at the end of the 2022 season; however, Tipungwuti revoked the announcement on 10 November 2022. Tipungwuti again announced his retirement at the end of the 2023 after playing only two further games at senior level.

=== Brad Scott era (2023–present) ===
In 2023, reports emerged claiming that the club was reconsidering its logo. These included rumours that the current bomber logo was insensitive due to the operation of bomber jets in conflict. These reports were denied by then-captain Zach Merrett.

At the end of the 2023 season, it was announced that former West Coast and Gold Coast player Matt Rosa would join Essendon as Talent &amp; Operations Manager and that Adrian Dodoro would step back from his position of recruiting manager after the upcoming trade and draft periods.

In Brad Scott&#x27;s first season as coach, Essendon sat in fifth position after round 17, but their form fell off later in the season to finish 11th with 11 wins and 12 losses.

In Brad Scott&#x27;s second season as coach, Essendon finished with a win–draw–loss record of 11–1–11. 

On 13 August 2024 club champion Dyson Heppell announced he would retire at the end of the season after playing 253 games for the club. Heppell was the final player of the Essendon 34 still playing at the club. 

== Club symbols ==

=== Guernsey ===
Essendon&#x27;s first recorded jumpers were navy blue (&quot;The Footballers&quot;, edited by Thomas Power, 1875) although the club wore &#x27;red and black caps and hose&#x27;. In 1877, &quot;The Footballers&quot; records the addition of &#x27;a red sash over left shoulder&#x27;. This is the first time a red sash as part of the club jumper, and by 1878 there are newspaper reports referring to Essendon players as &#x27;the men in the sash&#x27;.

Given that blue and navy blue were the most popular colours at the time, it is thought that Essendon adopted a red sash in 1877 to distinguish its players from others in similar-coloured jumpers.

==== Clash jumpers ====

In 2007, the AFL Commission laid down the requirement that all clubs must produce an alternative jumper for use in matches where jumpers are considered to clash. From 2007 to 2011, the Essendon clash guernsey was the same design as its home guernsey, but with a substantially wider sash such that the guernsey was predominantly red rather than predominantly black. This was changed after 2011 when the AFL deemed that the wider sash did not provide sufficient contrast.

From 2012 to 2016, Essendon&#x27;s clash guernsey was predominantly grey, with a red sash fimbriated in black; the grey field contained, in small print, the names of all Essendon premiership players.

Before the 2016 season, Essendon&#x27;s changed their clash guernsey to a predominantly red one, featuring a red sash outlined in black. Similar to the grey jumper, the names of Essendon premiership players were also printed outside the sash.

The 2025 season will see Essendon unveil a new away/clash guernsey, which will be red with a black sash, a reverse of the home guernsey.

==== Yellow armbands ====
Following Adam Ramanauskas&#x27;s personal battle with cancer, a &quot;Clash for Cancer&quot; match against was launched in 2006. This was a joint venture between Essendon and the Cancer Council of Victoria to raise funds for the organisation. Despite a formal request to the AFL being denied, players wore yellow armbands for the match, which resulted in the club being fined $20,000. In 2007, the AFL agreed to allow yellow armbands to be incorporated into the left sleeve of the jumper. The &#x27;Clash for Cancer&#x27; match against Melbourne has become an annual event, repeated in subsequent seasons, though in 2012, 2013, 2014 and 2016, (twice), the Sydney Swans and Brisbane Lions were the opponents in those respective seasons instead of Melbourne. In 2009, the jumpers were auctioned along with yellow boots worn by some players during the match.

=== Club song ===
The club&#x27;s theme song, &quot;See the Bombers Fly Up&quot;, is thought to have been written c. 1959 by Kevin Andrews in the home of player Jeff Gamble at which time Kevin Andrews was living. The song is based on the tune of Johnnie Hamp&#x27;s 1929 song &quot;(Keep Your) Sunny Side Up&quot; at an increased tempo. Jeff Gamble came up with the line &#x27;See the bombers fly up, up&#x27; while Kevin Andrews contributed all or most of the rest. At the time, &quot;(Keep Your) Sunny Side Up&quot; was the theme song for the popular Melbourne-based TV show on Channel 7 &quot;Sunnyside Up&quot;. The official version of the song was recorded in 1972 by the Fable Singers and is still used today.

The song, as with all other AFL clubs, is played prior to every match and at the conclusion of matches when the team is victorious.

: &quot;See the Bombers fly up, up!&quot;
: &quot;To win the premiership flag.&quot;
: &quot;Our boys who play this grand old game,&quot;
: &quot;Are always striving for glory and fame!&quot;
: &quot;See the Bombers fly up, up,&quot;
: &quot;The other teams they don&#x27;t fear;&quot;
: &quot;They all try their best,&quot;
: &quot;But they can&#x27;t get near,&quot;
: &quot;As the Bombers fly up!&quot;

Songwriter Mike Brady, of &quot;Up There Cazaly&quot; fame, penned an updated version of the song in 1999 complete with a new verse arrangement, but it was not well received. However, this version is occasionally played at club functions. In 2018, Andrews revealed that there was an error in the lyrics, in which in the line &quot;The other teams they don&#x27;t fear&quot;, the word &quot;they&quot; was supposed to be &quot;we&quot;.

=== Logo and mascot ===
The club&#x27;s current logo was introduced in 1998, making it the oldest AFL logo currently in use.

Their mascot is known as &quot;Skeeta Reynolds&quot;, and was named after Dick Reynolds. He is a mosquito and was created in honour of the team&#x27;s back-to-back premiership sides in the 1920s known as the &quot;Mosquito Fleet&quot;. He was first named through a competition run in the Bomber magazine with &quot;Skeeta&quot; being the winning entry. This was later changed to &quot;Skeeta Reynolds&quot;. He appears as a red mosquito in an Essendon jumper and wears a red and black scarf.

===Headquarters, training and administration base===
The Essendon Football Club primary training and administration base has been at The Hangar since 2013. Prior to this, the primary training and administration base of Essendon Football Club was based at Windy Hill Oval from 1922 until 2013. Prior to Windy Hill, the home ground of Essendon Football Club was at the East Melbourne Cricket Ground from 1882 until 1921.

== Rivalries ==

Essendon&#x27;s biggest rivals are , , and , as these teams and Essendon are the four biggest and most supported clubs in Victoria. Matches between the clubs are often close regardless of form and ladder positions. If out of the race themselves, all four have the desire to deny the others a finals spot or a premiership. Essendon also has a fierce rivalry with Hawthorn, stemming from excessive on-field violence in the 1980s, perhaps reaching its zenith with the infamous Line in the Sand Match in 2004. Additionally, Essendon has a three-decade rivalry with the West Coast Eagles.

* – The rivalry between Essendon and Carlton is considered one of the strongest in the league. With the teams sharing the record of 16 premierships, both sides are keen to become outright leader, or if out of the finals race, at least ensure the other doesn&#x27;t. In recent years, the rivalry has thickened, with Carlton beating the 1999 Minor Premiers and premiership favourites by 1 point in the Preliminary Final. Other notable meetings between the two clubs include the 1908, 1947, 1949, 1962 and 1968 VFL Grand Finals and 1993 AFL Grand Final, with some decided by small margins.
* – In the early days of the VFL, this rivalry grew out of several Grand Final meetings: 1901, 1902 and 1911. The teams didn&#x27;t meet again in a Grand Final until 1990 when Collingwood won to draw level with the Bombers on 14 premierships and deny the Bombers a chance to join Carlton with 15 flags. Since 1995, the clubs face off against each other annually in the Anzac Day clash, a match which is described as the second biggest of the season (behind only the Grand Final). Being possibly the two biggest football clubs in Victoria, regardless of their position on the ladder, this game always attracts a huge crowd, and it is a match both teams have a great desire to win regardless of either team&#x27;s season prospects. The rivalry thickened further in 2023 when Collingwood joined Essendon and Carlton with a record 16 premierships.
* – This rivalry stems out of the 1942 Grand Final which Essendon won. In 1974, a half-time brawl took place involving trainers, officials and players at Windy Hill and has become infamous as one of the biggest ever. The teams didn&#x27;t meet in the finals between 1944 and 1995, but there have been many close margins in home and away season matches as a result of each team&#x27;s &quot;never say die&quot; attitude and ability to come back from significant margins in the dying stages of matches. Having met in the AFL&#x27;s &quot;Rivalry Round&quot; in (2006 and 2009) and meeting in the Dreamtime at the &#x27;G match since 2005, the rivalry and passion between the clubs and supporters has re-ignited. In recent years the rivalry has been promoted as the &quot;Clash of the Sash&quot;.
* – The two sides had a number of physical encounters in the mid-1980s when they were the top two sides of the competition. The rivalry was exacerbated when Dermott Brereton ran through Essendon&#x27;s three-quarter time huddle during a match in 1988 and again by an all in brawl during a match in 2004 allegedly instigated by Brereton (now known as the Line in the Sand Match after the direction allegedly given by Brereton for the Hawthorn players to make a physical stand). This was reminiscent of the 1980s when battles with Hawthorn were often hard and uncompromising affairs. During Round 22 of the 2009 season, Essendon and Hawthorn played for the last finals spot up for grabs. The teams played out an extremely physical game and despite being 22 points down at half time Essendon went on to win by 17 points. The game included a brawl shortly after half time sparked by Essendon&#x27;s captain Matthew Lloyd knocking out Hawthorn midfielder Brad Sewell, which led Hawthorn&#x27;s Campbell Brown to label Lloyd a &#x27;sniper&#x27;, and promised revenge if Lloyd played on in 2010.
* – One of the fiercest rivalries in the AFL can be traced back to 1896, when several clubs, including Essendon, broke away from the Victorian Football Association to form the Victorian Football League. North sought to join the breakaway competition, but some argue this desire was not realised due to Essendon feeling threatened by North&#x27;s proximity and the fact their inclusion could drain Essendon of vital talent. More than 100 years later, some North supporters have not forgiven Essendon for the decision and have blamed the Bombers for their small supporter base and gate revenue. North were finally admitted into the VFL in 1925 alongside Footscray and Hawthorn. In 1950, the two sides met in their first and only grand final meeting to date, which Essendon won by 38 points. The rivalry would flare up again in the 1980s. In 1982, the Krakouer brothers, Jim and Phil, led the Roos to an Elimination Final win. Essendon had their revenge a year later, winning a Preliminary Final by 86 points. The rivalry was re-ignited in the late 1990s and early 2000s due to the on-field success of the two sides. In preparation for the 1998 finals series, and despite losing six of their last eight to the Roos, legendary Essendon coach Kevin Sheedy publicly labelled North executives Greg Miller and Mark Dawson soft in response to comments from commentators that his Essendon team was soft. The Kangaroos beat Essendon in the much-hyped encounter that followed (a Qualifying Final), and North fans pelted Sheedy with marshmallows as he left the ground, although Sheedy was seemingly unfazed by the incident, encouraging a &quot;Marshmallow Game&quot; the next year and relishing in the fact that Sheedy&#x27;s ulterior motive was to build up the game and draw a large crowd, which proved to be correct, drawing in 71,154 people to attend the game. In 2000, the Bombers thrashed North by 125 points. The biggest VFL/AFL comeback of all time occurred between the two teams when Essendon managed to come back from a 69-point deficit to win by 12 points in 2001. A meeting of the two rivals at the MCG in the 2014 AFL finals series in the 2nd Elimination Final resulted in North winning by 12 points.
*West Coast – A three-decade rivalry between the Essendon Bombers and the West Coast Eagles kicked off when Essendon coach Kevin Sheedy tied the windsock down on the School End outer terrace so the opposition would not know which way the wind was blowing. Sheedy later said of the incident three decades later, in jest, that it was because the brand sponsor had neglected to pay their account. When West Coast won the toss and kicked against the breeze, it looked as if Sheedy&#x27;s plan had worked. Nevertheless, West Coast would go on to win by 7 points. In his excitement at winning a close match in Round 16, 1993, with ruckman and forward Paul Salmon kicking a goal 30 seconds before the final siren against the West Coast Eagles (the reigning premiers), Sheedy waved his jacket in the air as he came rushing from the coaches&#x27; box. To this day, the supporters of the winning club wave their jackets in the air after the game when the two teams play. The moment is captured in Jamie Cooper&#x27;s painting &quot;the Game That Made Australia&quot;, commissioned by the AFL in 2008 to celebrate the 150th anniversary of the sport, with Sheedy shown waving a red, black and yellow jacket rather than a red and black jacket, to reflect Sheedy&#x27;s support of indigenous footballers. The Bombers would go on to defeat West Coast again later that year in their semi-final clash and take home the 1993 premiership cup a couple of weeks later. Despite Sheedy&#x27;s typically measured disposition, Sheedy did lose his cool on one occasion in 2000. In yet another game against the Eagles, Sheedy was fined $7,500 by the tribunal after making a cut-throat gesture to then-Eagle Mitchell White during the half-time break of the Essendon–West Coast clash in Round 15, 2000, also apparently mouthing the words &quot;You... are... fucked!&quot; to White. In a famous game in 2004, with 35 seconds remaining and the scores deadlocked at 131 points apiece, Essendon legend James Hird swooped on a loose ball in the right forward pocket and snapped a match-winning goal with his 15th possession for the quarter, famously hugging an Essendon supporter in the crowd in a moment of jubilation after being fined $20,000 earlier in the week for criticising umpire Scott McLaren. Full-forward Matthew Lloyd also kicked eight goals during the game to net three Brownlow votes. Despite Hird&#x27;s incredible individual effort, and to the consternation of fans and the audience of the 2004 Brownlow medal count, he did not receive any Brownlow Medal votes from the umpires for his 34 disposals and clutch goals, which some have speculated was in retribution for his tirade against umpire McLaren.

== Reserves team ==
The Essendon reserves are the reserves team of the club, playing in the Victorian Football League.

===History===
The team first competed in the Victorian Junior Football League (later the AFL reserves) when the competition was established in 1919, and was known as Essendon Juniors until the end of 1922.

The team enjoyed success in the form of eight premierships, including in the last year of the reserves competition in 1999. From 2000 until 2002, the club&#x27;s reserves team competed in the Victorian Football League.

At the end of 2002, the club dissolved its reserves team and established a reserves affiliation with the Bendigo Football Club in the VFL. The affiliation ran for ten years from 2003 until 2012, allowing reserves players from the Essendon list to play with Bendigo. For all but the final year of the affiliation, Bendigo was known as the Bendigo Bombers.

The club re-established its reserves team in 2013, seeking greater developmental autonomy. The team plays its home games at Windy Hill. The team is made up of senior-listed AFL players and VFL-contracted players.

===Premierships (7)===
===Runners-up (10)===

 Essendon refused to play the Grand Final in Geelong, so the premiership was awarded to Geelong.

==Women&#x27;s teams==

===AFL Women&#x27;s team===
Essendon fielded a team in the AFL Women&#x27;s (AFLW) competition from its seventh season. In March 2022, former AFLW player and Essendon VFLW captain Georgia Nanscawen was announced as the club&#x27;s first AFLW player signing, and AFLW assistant coach Natalie Wood was announced as the club&#x27;s first AFLW coach a week later. The club&#x27;s AFLW coaching panel was finalised in late June.

====AFL Women&#x27;s squad====
===VFL Women&#x27;s team===
Essendon has fielded a team in the VFL Women&#x27;s (VFLW) competition since the 2018 season. The league is the highest-grade competition for female footballers in Victoria and one of three second-tier female competitions underneath the national AFL Women&#x27;s.

== Other ventures ==
In December 2017, Essendon entered e-sports by acquiring Australian &quot;League of Legends&quot; team Abyss ESports. This made them the second AFL team to acquire an e-sports division after Adelaide acquired Legacy ESports in May.

On 2 December 2019, it was announced that the Bombers&#x27; OPL slot had been sold to Perth-based internet provider Pentanet, marking Essendon&#x27;s exit from the e-sports arena.

In 2018, the Essendon Football Club, along with four other AFL clubs, entered the Victorian Wheelchair Football League.

==Activism==
===Aboriginal support===
Starting with Norm McDonald in 1947, Essendon has a proud history of fostering Aboriginal talent at the top level. This came to the fore during the 1990s with players such as Michael Long, Derek Kickett, Gavin Wanganeen, and Dean Rioli rising through the ranks and being fostered by Kevin Sheedy. Dreamtime at the &#x27;G and the Long Walk are two prominent annual events staged to help promote and support Aboriginal culture. The Long Walk, specifically, is designed to raise money for Indigenous education programs across the country.

Additionally, Essendon is a supporter of the Voice to Parliament.

===Same-Sex Marriage===
During the Australian Marriage Law Postal Survey, Essendon supported the Yes vote.

<doc id="10258" wikidata="Q192069" url="?curid=10258" title="Enid Blyton">
<text>Enid Mary Blyton (11 August 1897 – 28 November 1968) was an English children&#x27;s writer, whose books have been worldwide bestsellers since the 1930s, selling more than 600 million copies. Her books are still enormously popular and have been translated into ninety languages. As of June 2019, Blyton held the 4th place for the most translated author. She wrote on a wide range of topics, including education, natural history, fantasy, mystery, and biblical narratives. She is best remembered for her &quot;Noddy&quot;, &quot;Famous Five&quot;, &quot;Secret Seven&quot;, the &quot;Five Find-Outers&quot;, and &quot;Malory Towers&quot; books, although she also wrote many others, including; &quot;St. Clare&#x27;s&quot;, &quot;The Naughtiest Girl&quot;, and &quot;The Faraway Tree&quot; series.

Her first book, &quot;Child Whispers&quot;, a 24-page collection of poems, was published in 1922. Following the commercial success of her early novels, such as &quot;Adventures of the Wishing-Chair&quot; (1937) and &quot;The Enchanted Wood&quot; (1939), Blyton went on to build a literary empire, sometimes producing fifty books a year in addition to her prolific magazine and newspaper contributions. Her writing was unplanned and sprang largely from her unconscious mind; she typed her stories as events unfolded before her. The sheer volume of her work and the speed with which she produced it led to rumours that Blyton employed an army of ghost writers, a charge she vehemently denied.

Blyton&#x27;s work became increasingly controversial among literary critics, teachers, and parents beginning in the 1950s due to the alleged unchallenging nature of her writing and her themes, particularly in the Noddy series. Some libraries and schools banned her works, and from the 1930s until the 1950s, the BBC refused to broadcast her stories because of their perceived lack of literary merit. Her books have been criticised as elitist, sexist, racist, xenophobic, and at odds with the more progressive environment that was emerging in post-World War II Britain, but updated versions of her books have continued to be popular since her death in 1968.

She felt she had a responsibility to provide her readers with a strong moral framework, so she encouraged them to support worthy causes. In particular, through the clubs she set up or supported, she encouraged and organised them to raise funds for animal and paediatric charities. The story of Blyton&#x27;s life was dramatised in &quot;Enid&quot;, a BBC television film featuring Helena Bonham Carter in the title role. It was first broadcast in the UK on BBC Four in 2009.

==Early life and education==
Enid Blyton was born on 11 August 1897 in East Dulwich, south London, United Kingdom, the eldest of three children, to Thomas Carey Blyton (1870–1920), a cutlery salesman (recorded in the 1911 census with the occupation of &quot;Mantle Manufacturer dealer [in] women&#x27;s suits, skirts, etc.&quot;) and his wife Theresa Mary (&quot;née&quot; Harrison; 1874–1950). Enid&#x27;s younger brothers, Hanly (1899–1983) and Carey (1902–1976), were born after the family had moved to a semi-detached house in Beckenham, then a village in Kent. A few months after her birth, Enid almost died from whooping cough but was nursed back to health by her father, whom she adored. Thomas Blyton ignited Enid&#x27;s interest in nature; in her autobiography she wrote that he &quot;loved flowers and birds and wild animals, and knew more about them than anyone I had ever met&quot;. He also passed on his interest in gardening, art, music, literature, and theatre, and the pair often went on nature walks, much to the disapproval of Enid&#x27;s mother, who showed little interest in her daughter&#x27;s pursuits. Enid was devastated when her father left the family shortly after her 13th birthday to live with another woman. Enid and her mother did not have a good relationship, and after she left home, Enid gave people the impression that her mother was dead. Enid did not attend either of her parents&#x27; funerals.

From 1907 to 1915, Blyton attended St Christopher&#x27;s School in Beckenham, where she enjoyed physical activities and became school tennis champion and lacrosse captain. She was not keen on all the academic subjects but excelled in writing and, in 1911, entered Arthur Mee&#x27;s children&#x27;s poetry competition. Mee offered to print her verses, encouraging her to produce more. Blyton&#x27;s mother considered her efforts at writing to be a &quot;waste of time and money&quot;, but she was encouraged to persevere by Mabel Attenborough, the aunt of school friend Mary Potter.
Blyton&#x27;s father taught her to play the piano, which she mastered well enough for him to believe she might follow in his sister&#x27;s footsteps and become a professional musician. Blyton considered enrolling at the Guildhall School of Music, but decided she was better suited to becoming a writer. After finishing school, in 1915, as head girl, she moved out of the family home to live with her friend Mary Attenborough, before going to stay with George and Emily Hunt at Seckford Hall, near Woodbridge, in Suffolk. Seckford Hall, with its allegedly haunted room and secret passageway, provided inspiration for her later writing. At Woodbridge Congregational Church, Blyton met Ida Hunt, who taught at Ipswich High School and suggested she train there as a teacher. Blyton was introduced to the children at the nursery school and, recognising her natural affinity with them, enrolled in a National Froebel Union teacher training course at the school in September 1916. By this time, she had nearly terminated all contact with her family.

Blyton&#x27;s manuscripts were rejected by publishers on many occasions, which only made her more determined to succeed, saying, &quot;It is partly the struggle that helps you so much, that gives you determination, character, self-reliance –all things that help in any profession or trade, and most certainly in writing.&quot; In March 1916, her first poems were published in &quot;Nash&#x27;s Magazine&quot;. She completed her teacher training course in December 1918 and, the following month, obtained a teaching appointment at Bickley Park School, a small, independent establishment for boys in Bickley, Kent. Two months later, Blyton received a teaching certificate with distinctions in zoology and principles of education; first class in botany, geography, practice and history of education, child hygiene, and classroom teaching; and second class in literature and elementary mathematics. In 1920, she moved to Southernhay, in Hook Road Surbiton, as nursery governess to the four sons of architect Horace Thompson and his wife Gertrude, with whom Blyton spent four happy years. With the shortage of area schools, neighbouring children soon joined her charges, and a small school developed at the house.

==Early writing career==

In 1920, Blyton moved to Chessington and began writing in her spare time. The following year, she won the &quot;Saturday Westminster Review&quot; writing competition with her essay &quot;On the Popular Fallacy that to the Pure All Things are Pure&quot;. Publications such as &quot;The Londoner&quot;, &quot;Home Weekly&quot; and &quot;The Bystander&quot; began to show an interest in her short stories and poems.
Blyton&#x27;s first book, &quot;Child Whispers&quot;, a 24-page collection of poems, was published in 1922. Its illustrator, Enid&#x27;s schoolfriend Phyllis Chase collaborated on several of her early works. Also in that year, Blyton began writing in annuals for Cassell and George Newnes, and her first piece of writing, &quot;Peronel and his Pot of Glue&quot;, was accepted for publication in &quot;Teachers&#x27; World&quot;. Further boosting her success, in 1923, her poems appeared alongside those of Rudyard Kipling, Walter de la Mare, and G. K. Chesterton in a special issue of &quot;Teachers&#x27; World.&quot; Blyton&#x27;s educational texts were influential in the 1920s and 1930s, with her most sizable being the three-volume &quot;The Teacher&#x27;s Treasury&quot; (1926), the six-volume &quot;Modern Teaching&quot; (1928), the eight-volume &quot;Pictorial Knowledge&quot; (1930), and the four-volume &quot;Modern Teaching in the Infant School&quot; (1932).

In July 1923, Blyton published &quot;Real Fairies&quot;, a collection of thirty-three poems written especially for the book with the exception of &quot;Pretending&quot;, which had appeared earlier in &quot;Punch&quot; magazine. The following year, she published &quot;The Enid Blyton Book of Fairies&quot;, illustrated by Horace J. Knowles, and in 1926 the &quot;Book of Brownies&quot;. Several books of plays appeared in 1927, including &quot;A Book of Little Plays&quot; and &quot;The Play&#x27;s the Thing&quot; with the illustrator Alfred Bestall.

In the 1930s, Blyton developed an interest in writing stories related to various myths, including those of ancient Greece and Rome; &quot;The Knights of the Round Table&quot;, &quot;Tales of Ancient Greece&quot; and &quot;Tales of Robin Hood&quot; were published in 1930. In &quot;Tales of Ancient Greece&quot; Blyton retold 16 well-known ancient Greek myths, but used Latin rather than Greek names and invented conversations between characters. &quot;The Adventures of Odysseus&quot;, &quot;Tales of the Ancient Greeks and Persians&quot; and &quot;Tales of the Romans&quot; followed in 1934.

==Commercial success==
===New series: 1934–1948===
The first of twenty-eight books in Blyton&#x27;s Old Thatch series, &quot;The Talking Teapot and Other Tales&quot;, was published in 1934, the same year as &quot;Brer Rabbit Retold&quot;; (Brer Rabbit originally featured in Uncle Remus stories by Joel Chandler Harris), her first serial story and first full-length book, &quot;Adventures of the Wishing-Chair&quot;, followed in 1937. &quot;The Enchanted Wood&quot;, the first book in the Faraway Tree series, published in 1939, is about a magic tree inspired by the Norse mythology that had fascinated Blyton as a child. According to Blyton&#x27;s daughter Gillian, the inspiration for the magic tree came from &quot;thinking up a story one day, and suddenly she was walking in the enchanted wood and found the tree. In her imagination, she climbed up through the branches and met Moon-Face, Silky, the Saucepan Man and the rest of the characters. She had all she needed.&quot; As in the Wishing-Chair series, these fantasy books typically involve children being transported into a magical world in which they meet fairies, goblins, elves, pixies and other mythological creatures.

Blyton&#x27;s first full-length adventure novel, &quot;The Secret Island&quot;, was published in 1938, featuring the characters of Jack, Mike, Peggy and Nora. Described by &quot;The Glasgow Herald&quot; as a &quot;Robinson Crusoe-style adventure on an island in an English lake&quot;, &quot;The Secret Island&quot; was a lifelong favourite of Gillian&#x27;s and spawned the Secret series. The following year Blyton released her first book in the Circus series and her initial book in the Amelia Jane series, &quot;Naughty Amelia Jane!&quot; According to Gillian, the main character was based on a large handmade doll given to her by her mother on her third birthday.

During the 1940s, Blyton became a prolific author, her success enhanced by her &quot;marketing, publicity and branding that was far ahead of its time&quot;. In 1940, Blyton published two books – &quot;Three Boys and a Circus&quot; and &quot;Children of Kidillin&quot; – under the pseudonym of Mary Pollock (middle name plus first married name), in addition to the eleven published under her name that year. So popular were Pollock&#x27;s books that one reviewer was prompted to observe that &quot;Enid Blyton had better look to her laurels&quot;. But Blyton&#x27;s readers were not so easily deceived and many complained about the subterfuge to her and her publisher, with the result that all six books published under the name of Mary Pollock – two in 1940 and four in 1943 – were reissued under Blyton&#x27;s name. Later in 1940, Blyton published the first of her boarding school story books and the first novel in the Naughtiest Girl series, &quot;The Naughtiest Girl in the School&quot;, which followed the exploits of the mischievous schoolgirl Elizabeth Allen at the fictional Whyteleafe School. The first of her six novels in the St. Clare&#x27;s series, &quot;The Twins at St. Clare&#x27;s&quot;, appeared the following year, featuring the twin sisters Patricia and Isabel O&#x27;Sullivan.

In 1942, Blyton released the first book in the Mary Mouse series, &quot;Mary Mouse and the Dolls&#x27; House&quot;, about a mouse exiled from her mousehole who becomes a maid at a dolls&#x27; house. Twenty-three books in the series were produced between 1942 and 1964; 10,000 copies were sold in 1942 alone. The same year, Blyton published the first novel in the Famous Five series, &quot;Five on a Treasure Island&quot;, with illustrations by Eileen Soper. Its popularity resulted in twenty-one books between then and 1963, and the characters of Julian, Dick, Anne, George (Georgina) and Timmy the dog became household names in Britain. Matthew Grenby, author of &quot;Children&#x27;s Literature&quot;, states that the five were involved with &quot;unmasking hardened villains and solving serious crimes&quot;, although the novels were &quot;hardly &#x27;hard-boiled&#x27; thrillers&quot;. Blyton based the character of Georgina, a tomboy she described as &quot;short-haired, freckled, sturdy, and snub-nosed&quot; and &quot;bold and daring, hot-tempered and loyal&quot;, on herself.

Blyton had an interest in biblical narratives and retold Old and New Testament stories. &quot;The Land of Far-Beyond&quot; (1942) is a Christian parable along the lines of John Bunyan&#x27;s &quot;The Pilgrim&#x27;s Progress&quot; (1698), with contemporary children as the main characters. In 1943, she published &quot;The Children&#x27;s Life of Christ&quot;, a collection of fifty-nine short stories related to the life of Jesus, with her slant on popular biblical stories, from the Nativity and the Three Wise Men through to the trial, the crucifixion and the resurrection. &quot;Tales from the Bible&quot; was published the following year, followed by &quot;The Boy with the Loaves and Fishes&quot; in 1948.

The first book in Blyton&#x27;s Five Find-Outers series, &quot;The Mystery of the Burnt Cottage&quot;, was published in 1943, as was the second book in the Faraway series, &quot;The Magic Faraway Tree&quot;, which in 2003 was voted 66th in the BBC&#x27;s Big Read poll to find the UK&#x27;s favourite book. Several of Blyton&#x27;s works during this period have seaside themes; &quot;John Jolly by the Sea&quot; (1943), a picture book intended for younger readers, was published in a booklet format by Evans Brothers. Other books with a maritime theme include &quot;The Secret of Cliff Castle&quot; and &quot;Smuggler Ben&quot;, both attributed to Mary Pollock in 1943; &quot;The Island of Adventure&quot;, the first in the Adventure series of eight novels from 1944 onwards; and various novels of the Famous Five series such as &quot;Five on a Treasure Island&quot; (1942), &quot;Five on Kirrin Island Again&quot; (1947) and &quot;Five Go Down to the Sea&quot; (1953).

Capitalising on her success, with a loyal and ever-growing readership, Blyton produced a new edition of many of her series such as the Famous Five, the Five Find-Outers and St. Clare&#x27;s every year in addition to many other novels, short stories and books. In 1946, Blyton launched the first in the Malory Towers series of six books based around the schoolgirl Darrell Rivers, &quot;First Term at Malory Towers&quot;, which became extremely popular, particularly with girls.

===Peak output: 1949–1959===
The first book in Blyton&#x27;s Barney Mysteries series, &quot;The Rockingdown Mystery&quot;, was published in 1949, as was the first of her fifteen Secret Seven novels. The Secret Seven Society consists of Peter, his sister Janet, and their friends Colin, George, Jack, Pam and Barbara, who meet regularly in a shed in the garden to discuss peculiar events in their local community. Blyton rewrote the stories so they could be adapted into cartoons, which appeared in &quot;Mickey Mouse Weekly&quot; in 1951 with illustrations by George Brook. The French author Evelyne Lallemand continued the series in the 1970s, producing an additional twelve books, nine of which were translated into English by Anthea Bell between 1983 and 1987.
Blyton&#x27;s Noddy, about a little wooden boy from Toyland, first appeared in the &quot;Sunday Graphic&quot; on 5 June 1949, and in November that year &quot;Noddy Goes to Toyland&quot;, the first of at least two dozen books in the series, was published. The idea was conceived by one of Blyton&#x27;s publishers, Sampson, Low, Marston and Company, who in 1949 arranged a meeting between Blyton and the Dutch illustrator Harmsen van der Beek. Despite having to communicate via an interpreter, he provided some initial sketches of how Toyland and its characters would be represented. Four days after the meeting, Blyton sent the text of the first two Noddy books to her publisher, to be forwarded to van der Beek. The Noddy books became one of her most successful and best-known series, and were hugely popular in the 1950s. An extensive range of sub-series, spin-offs and strip books was produced throughout the decade, including &quot;Noddy&#x27;s Library&quot;, &quot;Noddy&#x27;s Garage of Books&quot;, &quot;Noddy&#x27;s Castle of Books&quot;, &quot;Noddy&#x27;s Toy Station of Books&quot; and &quot;Noddy&#x27;s Shop of Books&quot;.

In 1950, Blyton established the company Darrell Waters Ltd to manage her affairs. By the early 1950s, she had reached the peak of her output, often publishing more than fifty books a year, and she remained extremely prolific throughout much of the decade. By 1955, Blyton had written her fourteenth Famous Five novel, &quot;Five Have Plenty of Fun&quot;, her fifteenth Mary Mouse book, &quot;Mary Mouse in Nursery Rhyme Land&quot;, her eighth book in the Adventure series, &quot;The River of Adventure&quot;, and her seventh Secret Seven novel, &quot;Secret Seven Win Through&quot;. She completed the sixth and final book of the Malory Towers series, &quot;Last Term at Malory Towers&quot;, in 1951.

Blyton published several further books featuring the character of Scamp the terrier, following on from &quot;The Adventures of Scamp&quot;, a novel she had released in 1943 under the nom de plume of Mary Pollock. &quot;Scamp Goes on Holiday&quot; (1952) and &quot;Scamp and Bimbo&quot;, &quot;Scamp at School&quot;, &quot;Scamp and Caroline&quot; and &quot;Scamp Goes to the Zoo&quot; (1954) were illustrated by Pierre Probst. She introduced the character of Bom, a stylish toy drummer dressed in a bright red coat and helmet, alongside Noddy in &quot;TV Comic&quot; in July 1956. A book series began the same year with &quot;Bom the Little Toy Drummer&quot;, featuring illustrations by R. Paul-Hoye, and followed with &quot;Bom and His Magic Drumstick&quot; (1957), &quot;Bom Goes Adventuring&quot; and &quot;Bom Goes to Ho Ho Village&quot; (1958), &quot;Bom and the Clown&quot; and &quot;Bom and the Rainbow&quot; (1959) and &quot;Bom Goes to Magic Town&quot; (1960). In 1958, she produced two annuals featuring the character, the first of which included twenty short stories, poems and picture strips.

===Final works===
Many of Blyton&#x27;s series, including Noddy and The Famous Five, continued to be successful in the 1960s; by 1962, 26 million copies of Noddy had been sold. Blyton concluded several of her long-running series in 1963, publishing the last books of The Famous Five (&quot;Five Are Together Again&quot;) and The Secret Seven (&quot;Fun for the Secret Seven&quot;); she also produced three more Brer Rabbit books with the illustrator Grace Lodge: &quot;Brer Rabbit Again&quot;, &quot;Brer Rabbit Book&quot;, and &quot;Brer Rabbit&#x27;s a Rascal&quot;. In 1962, many of her books were among the first to be published by Armada Books in paperback, making them more affordable to children.

After 1963, Blyton&#x27;s output was generally confined to short stories and books intended for very young readers, such as &quot;Learn to Count with Noddy&quot; and &quot;Learn to Tell Time with Noddy&quot; in 1965, and &quot;Stories for Bedtime&quot; and the Sunshine Picture Story Book collection in 1966. Her declining health and a falling off in readership among older children have been put forward as the principal reasons for this change in trend. Blyton published her last book in the Noddy series, &quot;Noddy and the Aeroplane&quot;, in February 1964. In May of the following year, she published &quot;Mixed Bag&quot;, a songbook with music written by her nephew Carey, and in August she released her last full-length books, &quot;The Man Who Stopped to Help&quot; and &quot;The Boy Who Came Back&quot;.

==Magazine and newspaper contributions==
Blyton cemented her reputation as a children&#x27;s writer when in 1926 she took over the editing of &quot;Sunny Stories&quot;, a magazine that typically included the re-telling of legends, myths, stories and other articles for children. That same year, she was given her own column in &quot;Teachers&#x27; World&quot;, entitled &quot;From my Window&quot;. Three years later, she began contributing a weekly page in the magazine, in which she published letters from her fox terrier dog Bobs. They proved to be so popular that in 1933 they were published in book form as &quot;Letters from Bobs&quot;, and sold ten thousand copies in the first week. Her most popular feature was &quot;Round the Year with Enid Blyton&quot;, which consisted of forty-eight articles covering aspects of natural history such as weather, pond life, how to plant a school garden and how to make a bird table. Among Blyton&#x27;s other nature projects was her monthly &quot;Country Letter&quot; feature that appeared in &quot;The Nature Lover&quot; magazine in 1935.

&quot;Sunny Stories&quot; was renamed &quot;Enid Blyton&#x27;s Sunny Stories&quot; in January 1937, and served as a vehicle for the serialisation of Blyton&#x27;s books. Her first Naughty Amelia Jane story, about an anti-heroine based on a doll owned by her daughter Gillian, was published in the magazine. Blyton stopped contributing in 1952, and it closed down the following year, shortly before the appearance of the new fortnightly &quot;Enid Blyton Magazine&quot; written entirely by Blyton. The first edition appeared on 18 March 1953, and the magazine ran until September 1959.

Noddy made his first appearance in the &quot;Sunday Graphic&quot; in 1949, the same year as Blyton&#x27;s first daily Noddy strip for the London &quot;Evening Standard&quot;. It was illustrated by van der Beek until his death in 1953.

==Writing style and technique==
Blyton worked in a wide range of fictional genres, from fairy tales to animal, nature, detective, mystery, and circus stories, but she often &quot;blurred the boundaries&quot; in her books, and encompassed a range of genres even in her short stories. In a 1958 article published in &quot;The Author&quot;, she wrote that there were a &quot;dozen or more different types of stories for children&quot;, and she had tried them all, but her favourites were those with a family at their centre.

In a letter to the psychologist Peter McKellar, Blyton describes her writing technique:
In another letter to McKellar, she describes how in just five days she wrote the 60,000-word book &quot;The River of Adventure&quot;, the eighth in her Adventure Series, by listening to what she referred to as her &quot;under-mind&quot;, which she contrasted with her &quot;upper conscious mind&quot;. Blyton was unwilling to conduct any research or planning before beginning work on a new book, which coupled with the lack of variety in her life according to Druce, almost inevitably presented the danger that she might unconsciously, and did, plagiarise the books she had read, including her own. Gillian has recalled that her mother &quot;never knew where her stories came from&quot;, but that she used to talk about them &quot;coming from her &#x27;mind&#x27;s eye″&quot;, as did William Wordsworth and Charles Dickens. Blyton had &quot;thought it was made up of every experience she&#x27;d ever had, everything she&#x27;s seen or heard or read, much of which had long disappeared from her conscious memory&quot; but never knew the direction her stories would take. Blyton further explained in her biography that &quot;If I tried to think out or invent the whole book, I could not do it. For one thing, it would bore me and for another, it would lack the &#x27;verve&#x27; and the extraordinary touches and surprising ideas that flood out from my imagination.&quot;

Blyton&#x27;s daily routine varied little over the years. She usually began writing soon after breakfast, with her portable typewriter on her knee and her favourite red Moroccan shawl nearby; she believed that the colour red acted as a &quot;mental stimulus&quot; for her. Stopping only for a short lunch break, she continued writing until five o&#x27;clock, by which time she would usually have produced 6,000–10,000 words.

An article in &quot;The Malay Mail&quot; published in 2000 considers Blyton&#x27;s children to have &quot;lived in a world shaped by the realities of post-war austerity&quot;, enjoying freedom without political correctness, which serves modern readers of Blyton&#x27;s novels with a form of escapism. Brandon Robshaw of &quot;The Independent&quot; refers to the Blyton universe as &quot;crammed with colour and character&quot;, &quot;self-contained and internally consistent&quot;, noting that Blyton exemplifies a strong mistrust of adults and figures of authority in her works, creating a world in which children govern. Gillian noted that in her mother&#x27;s adventure, detective and school stories for older children, &quot;the hook is the strong storyline with plenty of cliffhangers, a trick she acquired from her years of writing serialised stories for children&#x27;s magazines. There is always a strong moral framework in which bravery and loyalty are (eventually) rewarded&quot;. Blyton herself wrote that &quot;my love of children is the whole foundation of all my work&quot;.

Victor Watson, assistant director of Research at Homerton College, Cambridge, believes that Blyton&#x27;s works reveal an &quot;essential longing and potential associated with childhood&quot;, and notes how the opening pages of &quot;The Mountain of Adventure&quot; present a &quot;deeply appealing ideal of childhood&quot;. He argues that Blyton&#x27;s work differs from that of many other authors in its approach, describing the narrative of The Famous Five series for instance as &quot;like a powerful spotlight, it seeks to illuminate, to explain, to demystify. It takes its readers on a roller-coaster story in which the darkness is always banished; everything puzzling, arbitrary, evocative is either dismissed or explained&quot;. Watson further notes how Blyton often used minimalist visual descriptions and introduced a few careless phrases such as &quot;gleamed enchantingly&quot; to appeal to her young readers.

From the mid-1950s, rumours began to circulate that Blyton had not written all the books attributed to her, a charge she found particularly distressing. She published an appeal in her magazine asking children to let her know if they heard such stories and after one mother informed her that she had attended a parents&#x27; meeting at her daughter&#x27;s school, during which a young librarian had repeated the allegation, Blyton decided in 1955 to begin legal proceedings. The librarian was eventually forced to make a public apology in open court early the following year, but the rumours that Blyton operated &quot;a &#x27;company&#x27; of ghostwriters&quot; persisted, as some found it difficult to believe that one woman working alone could produce such a volume of work.

==Charitable work==
Blyton felt a responsibility to provide her readers with a positive moral framework, and she encouraged them to support worthy causes. Her view, expressed in a 1957 article, was that children should help animals and other children rather than adults:
Blyton and the members of the children&#x27;s clubs she promoted via her magazines raised a great deal of money for various charities; according to Blyton, membership of her clubs meant &quot;working for others, for no reward&quot;. The largest of the clubs she was involved with was the Busy Bees, the junior section of the People&#x27;s Dispensary for Sick Animals, which Blyton had actively supported since 1933. The club had been set up by Maria Dickin in 1934, and after Blyton publicised its existence in the &quot;Enid Blyton Magazine&quot;, it attracted 100,000 members in three years. Such was Blyton&#x27;s popularity among children that after she became Queen Bee in 1952, more than 20,000 additional members were recruited in her first year in office. The Enid Blyton Magazine Club was formed in 1953. Its primary objective was to raise funds to help those children with cerebral palsy who attended a centre in Cheyne Walk, in Chelsea, London, by furnishing an on-site hostel among other things.

The Famous Five series gathered such a following that readers asked Blyton if they might form a fan club. She agreed, on condition that it serves a useful purpose, and suggested that it could raise funds for the Shaftesbury Society Babies&#x27; Home in Beaconsfield, on whose committee she had served since 1948. The club was established in 1952, and provided funds for equipping a Famous Five Ward at the home, a paddling pool, sun room, summer house, playground, birthday and Christmas celebrations, and visits to the pantomime. By the late 1950s, Blyton&#x27;s clubs had a membership of 500,000, and raised £35,000 in the six years of the &quot;Enid Blyton Magazine&quot;&#x27;s run.

By 1974, the Famous Five Club had a membership of 220,000 and was growing at the rate of 6,000 new members a year. The Beaconsfield home that was set up to support was closed in 1967, but the club continued to raise funds for other paediatric charities, including an Enid Blyton bed at Great Ormond Street Hospital and a mini-bus for disabled children at Stoke Mandeville Hospital.

==Jigsaw puzzle and games==
Blyton capitalised upon her commercial success as an author by negotiating agreements with jigsaw puzzle and games manufacturers from the late 1940s onwards; by the early 1960s, some 146 different companies were involved in merchandising Noddy alone. In 1948, Bestime released four jigsaw puzzles featuring her characters, and the first Enid Blyton board game appeared, &quot;Journey Through Fairyland&quot;, created by BGL. The first card game, Faraway Tree, appeared from Pepys in 1950. In 1954, Bestime released the first four jigsaw puzzles of the Secret Seven, and the following year a Secret Seven card game appeared.

Bestime released the Little Noddy Car Game in 1953 and the Little Noddy Leap Frog Game in 1955, and in 1956 American manufacturer Parker Brothers released Little Noddy&#x27;s Taxi Game, a board game which features Noddy driving about town, picking up various characters. Bestime released its Plywood Noddy Jigsaws series in 1957 and a Noddy jigsaw series featuring cards appeared from 1963, with illustrations by Robert Lee. Arrow Games became the chief producer of Noddy jigsaws in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Whitman manufactured four new Secret Seven jigsaw puzzles in 1975 and produced four new Malory Towers ones two years later. In 1979, the company released a Famous Five adventure board game, the Famous Five Kirrin Island Treasure. Stephen Thraves wrote eight Famous Five adventure game books, published by Hodder &amp; Stoughton in the 1980s. The first adventure game book of the series, &quot;The Wreckers&#x27; Tower Game&quot;, was published in October 1984.

==Personal life==

On 28 August 1924, Blyton married Major Hugh Alexander Pollock, DSO (1888–1971) at Bromley Register Office, without inviting her family. They married shortly after his divorce from his first wife, with whom he had two sons, one of them already deceased. Pollock was an editor of the book department in the publishing firm George Newnes, which became Blyton&#x27;s regular publisher. It was he who requested her to write a book about animals, resulting in &quot;The Zoo Book&quot;, completed in the month before their marriage. They initially lived in a flat in Chelsea before moving to Elfin Cottage in Beckenham in 1926, and then to Old Thatch in Bourne End (called Peterswood in her books) in 1929. Blyton&#x27;s first daughter, Gillian, was born on 15 July 1931, and after a miscarriage in 1934, she gave birth to a second daughter, Imogen, on 27 October 1935.

In 1938, she and her family moved to a house in Beaconsfield, named Green Hedges by Blyton&#x27;s readers, following a competition in her magazine. By the mid-1930s, Pollock had become a secret alcoholic, withdrawing increasingly from public life—possibly triggered through his meetings, as a publisher, with Winston Churchill, which may have reawakened the trauma Pollock suffered during World War I. With the outbreak of World War II, he became involved in the Home Guard and also re-encountered Ida Crowe, an aspiring writer 19 years his junior, whom he had first met years earlier. He made her an offer to join him as a secretary in his posting to a Home Guard training center at Denbies, a Gothic mansion in Surrey belonging to Lord Ashcombe, and they began a romantic relationship.

Blyton&#x27;s marriage to Pollock was troubled for years, and according to Crowe&#x27;s memoir, she had a series of affairs, including lesbian relationships with one of the children&#x27;s nannies and with Lola Onslow, an artist who illustrated Blyton&#x27;s 1924, titled &quot;The Enid Blyton Book of Fairies&quot;. In 1941, Blyton met Kenneth Fraser Darrell Waters, a London surgeon with whom she began a serious affair. Pollock discovered the liaison and threatened to initiate divorce proceedings. Due to fears that exposure of her adultery would ruin her public image, it was ultimately agreed that Blyton would instead file for divorce against Pollock. According to Crowe&#x27;s memoir, Blyton promised that if he admitted to infidelity, she would allow him parental access to their daughters; but after the divorce, he was denied contact with them, and Blyton made sure he was subsequently unable to find work in publishing. Pollock, having married Crowe on 26 October 1943, eventually resumed his heavy drinking and was forced to petition for bankruptcy in 1950.

Blyton and Darrell Waters married at the City of Westminster Register Office on 20 October 1943. She changed the surname of her daughters to Darrell Waters and publicly embraced her new role as a happily married and devoted doctor&#x27;s wife. After discovering she was pregnant in the spring of 1945, Blyton miscarried five months later, following a fall from a ladder. The baby would have been Darrell Waters&#x27;s first child and the son for which they both longed.

Her love of tennis included playing naked, with nude tennis &quot;a common practice in those days among the more louche members of the middle classes&quot;.

Blyton&#x27;s health began to deteriorate in 1957, when, during a round of golf, she started to feel faint and breathless, and, by 1960, she was displaying signs of dementia. Her agent, George Greenfield, recalled that it was &quot;unthinkable&quot; for the &quot;most famous and successful of children&#x27;s authors with her enormous energy and computerlike memory&quot; to be losing her mind and suffering from what is now known as Alzheimer&#x27;s disease in her mid-60s. Worsening Blyton&#x27;s situation was her husband&#x27;s declining health throughout the 1960s; he suffered from severe arthritis in his neck and hips, deafness, and became increasingly ill-tempered and erratic until his death on 15 September 1967.

The story of Blyton&#x27;s life was dramatised in a BBC film entitled &quot;Enid&quot;, which aired in the United Kingdom on BBC Four on 16 November 2009. Helena Bonham Carter, who played the title role, described Blyton as &quot;a complete workaholic, an achievement junkie and an extremely canny businesswoman&quot; who &quot;knew how to brand herself, right down to the famous signature&quot;.

==Death and legacy==

During the months following her husband&#x27;s death, Blyton became increasingly ill and moved into a nursing home three months before her death. She died in her sleep of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease at the Greenways Nursing Home, Hampstead, north London, on 28 November 1968, aged 71. A memorial service was held at St James&#x27;s Church, Piccadilly and she was cremated at Golders Green Crematorium, where her ashes remain. Blyton&#x27;s home, Green Hedges, was auctioned on 26 May 1971 and demolished in 1973; the site is now occupied by houses and a street named Blyton Close. An English Heritage blue plaque commemorates Blyton at Hook Road in Chessington, where she lived from 1920 to 1924. In 2014, a plaque recording her time as a Beaconsfield resident from 1938 until her death in 1968 was unveiled in the town hall gardens, next to small iron figures of Noddy and Big Ears.

Since her death and the publication of her daughter Imogen&#x27;s 1989 autobiography, &quot;A Childhood at Green Hedges&quot;, Blyton has emerged as an emotionally immature, unstable and often malicious figure. Imogen considered her mother to be &quot;arrogant, insecure, pretentious, very skilled at putting difficult or unpleasant things out of her mind, and without a trace of maternal instinct. As a child, I viewed her as a rather strict authority. As an adult I pitied her.&quot; Blyton&#x27;s eldest daughter Gillian remembered her rather differently however, as &quot;a fair and loving mother, and a fascinating companion&quot;.

The Enid Blyton Trust for Children was established in 1982, with Imogen as its first chairman, and in 1985 it established the National Library for the Handicapped Child. &quot;Enid Blyton&#x27;s Adventure Magazine&quot; began publication in September 1985, and on 14 October 1992, the BBC began publishing &quot;Noddy Magazine&quot; and released the Noddy CD-Rom in October 1996.

The first Enid Blyton Day was held at Rickmansworth on 6 March 1993, and in October 1996, the Enid Blyton award, The Enid, was given to those who have made outstanding contributions towards children. The Enid Blyton Society was formed in early 1995, to provide &quot;a focal point for collectors and enthusiasts of Enid Blyton&quot; through its thrice-annual &quot;Enid Blyton Society Journal&quot;, its annual Enid Blyton Day and its website. On 16 December 1996, Channel 4 broadcast a documentary about Blyton, &quot;Secret Lives&quot;. To celebrate her centenary in 1997, exhibitions were put on at the London Toy &amp; Model Museum (now closed), Hereford and Worcester County Museum and Bromley Library, and on 9 September the Royal Mail issued centenary stamps.

The London-based entertainment and retail company, Trocadero PLC, purchased Blyton&#x27;s Darrell Waters Ltd in 1995 for £14.6 million and established a subsidiary, Enid Blyton Ltd, to handle all intellectual properties, character brands and media in Blyton&#x27;s works. The group changed its name to Chorion in 1998, but after financial difficulties in 2012, sold its assets. Hachette UK acquired from Chorion world rights in the Blyton estate in March 2013, including The Famous Five series but excluding the rights to Noddy, which had been sold to DreamWorks Classics (formerly Classic Media, now a subsidiary of DreamWorks Animation) in 2012.

Blyton&#x27;s granddaughter, Sophie Smallwood, wrote a new Noddy book to celebrate the character&#x27;s 60th birthday, 46 years after the last book was published; &quot;Noddy and the Farmyard Muddle&quot; (2009) was illustrated by Robert Tyndall. In February 2011, the manuscript of a previously unknown Blyton novel, &quot;Mr Tumpy&#x27;s Caravan&quot;, was discovered by the archivist at Seven Stories, National Centre for Children&#x27;s Books in a collection of papers belonging to Blyton&#x27;s daughter Gillian, purchased by Seven Stories in 2010 following her death. It was initially thought to belong to a comic strip collection of the same name published in 1949, but it appears to be unrelated and is believed to be something written in the 1930s, which had been rejected by a publisher.

In a 1982 survey of 10,000 eleven-year-old children, Blyton was voted their most popular writer. She is the world&#x27;s fourth most-translated author, behind Agatha Christie, Jules Verne and William Shakespeare with her books being translated into 90 languages. From 2000 to 2010, Blyton was listed as a Top Ten author, selling almost 8 million copies (worth £31.2 million) in the UK alone. In 2003, &quot;The Magic Faraway Tree&quot; was voted 66th in the BBC&#x27;s Big Read, a year-long survey of the UK&#x27;s best-loved novels. In a 2008 poll conducted by the Costa Book Awards, Blyton was voted the UK&#x27;s best-loved author ahead of Roald Dahl, J. K. Rowling, Jane Austen and Shakespeare. Her books continue to be very popular among children in Commonwealth nations such as India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Singapore, Malta, New Zealand and Australia, and around the world. They have also seen a surge of popularity in China, where they are &quot;big with every generation&quot;. In March 2004, Chorion and the Chinese publisher Foreign Language Teaching and Research Press negotiated an agreement over the Noddy franchise, which included bringing the character to an animated series on television, with a potential audience of a further 95 million children under the age of five. Chorion spent around £10 million digitising Noddy and, as of 2002, had made television agreements with at least 11 countries worldwide.

Novelists influenced by Blyton include the crime writer Denise Danks, whose fictional detective Georgina Powers is based on George from the Famous Five. Peter Hunt&#x27;s &quot;A Step off the Path&quot; (1985) is also influenced by the Famous Five, and the St. Clare&#x27;s and Malory Towers series inspired Jacqueline Wilson&#x27;s &quot;Double Act&quot; (1996) and Adèle Geras&#x27;s Egerton Hall trilogy (1990–92) respectively. Blyton was important to Stieg Larsson. &quot;The series Stieg Larsson most often mentioned were the Famous Five and the Adventure books&quot;.

==Critical backlash==
A.H. Thompson, who compiled an extensive overview of censorship efforts in the United Kingdom&#x27;s public libraries, dedicated an entire chapter to &quot;The Enid Blyton Affair&quot;, and wrote of her in 1975: 

Blyton&#x27;s range of plots and settings has been described as limited, repetitive and continually recycled. Many of her books were critically assessed by teachers and librarians, deemed unfit for children to read, and removed from syllabuses and public libraries. Responding to claims that her moral views were &quot;dependably predictable&quot;, Blyton commented that &quot;most of you could write down perfectly correctly all the things that I believe in and stand for – you have found them in my books, and a writer&#x27;s books are always a faithful reflection of himself&quot;.

From the 1930s to the 1950s, the BBC operated a &quot;de facto&quot; ban on dramatising Blyton&#x27;s books for radio, considering her to be a &quot;second-rater&quot; whose work was without literary merit. The children&#x27;s literary critic, Margery Fisher, likened Blyton&#x27;s books to &quot;slow poison&quot;, and Jean E. Sutcliffe of the BBC&#x27;s schools broadcast department wrote of Blyton&#x27;s ability to churn out &quot;mediocre material&quot;, noting that &quot;her capacity to do so amounts to genius ... anyone else would have died of boredom long ago&quot;. Michael Rosen, Children&#x27;s Laureate from 2007 until 2009, wrote that &quot;I find myself flinching at occasional bursts of snobbery and the assumed level of privilege of the children and families in the books&quot;. The children&#x27;s author Anne Fine presented an overview of the concerns about Blyton&#x27;s work and responses to them on BBC Radio 4 in November 2008, in which she noted the &quot;drip, drip, drip of disapproval&quot; associated with the books. Blyton&#x27;s response to her critics was that she was uninterested in the views of anyone over the age of 12, stating that half the attacks on her work were motivated by jealousy and the rest came from &quot;stupid people who don&#x27;t know what they&#x27;re talking about because they&#x27;ve never read any of my books&quot;.

Despite criticism by contemporaries that her work&#x27;s quality began to suffer in the 1950s at the expense of its increasing volume, Blyton nevertheless capitalised on being generally regarded at the time as &quot;a more &#x27;savoury&#x27;, English alternative&quot; to what some considered an &quot;invasion&quot; of Britain by American culture, in the form of &quot;rock music, horror comics, television, teenage culture, delinquency, and Disney&quot;.

According to Nicholas Tucker, the works of Enid Blyton have been &quot;banned from more public libraries over the years than is the case with any other adult or children&#x27;s author&quot;, though such attempts to quell the popularity of her books over the years seem to have been largely unsuccessful, and &quot;she still remains very widely read&quot;.

===Simplicity===
Some librarians felt that Blyton&#x27;s restricted use of language, a conscious product of her teaching background, was prejudicial to an appreciation of more literary qualities. In a scathing article published in &quot;Encounter&quot; in 1958, the journalist Colin Welch remarked that it was &quot;hard to see how a diet of Miss Blyton could help with the 11-plus or even with the Cambridge English Tripos&quot;, but reserved his harshest criticism for Blyton&#x27;s Noddy, describing him as an &quot;unnaturally priggish ... sanctimonious ... witless, spiritless, snivelling, sneaking doll.&quot;

The author and educational psychologist Nicholas Tucker notes that it was common to see Blyton cited as people&#x27;s favourite or least favourite author according to their age, and argues that her books create an &quot;encapsulated world for young readers that simply dissolves with age, leaving behind only memories of excitement and strong identification&quot;. Fred Inglis considers Blyton&#x27;s books to be technically easy to read, but to also be &quot;emotionally and cognitively easy&quot;. He mentions that the psychologist Michael Woods believed that Blyton was different from many other older authors writing for children in that she seemed untroubled by presenting them with a world that differed from reality. Woods surmised that Blyton &quot;was a child, she thought as a child, and wrote as a child ... the basic feeling is essentially pre-adolescent ... Enid Blyton has no moral dilemmas ... Inevitably Enid Blyton was labelled by rumour a child-hater. If true, such a fact should come as no surprise to us, for as a child herself all other children can be nothing but rivals for her&quot;. Inglis argues though that Blyton was devoted to children and put an enormous amount of energy into her work, with a powerful belief in &quot;representing the crude moral diagrams and garish fantasies of a readership&quot;. Blyton&#x27;s daughter Imogen has stated that she &quot;loved a relationship with children through her books&quot;, but real children were an intrusion, and there was no room for intruders in the world that Blyton occupied through her writing.

===Accusations of racism, xenophobia and sexism===
Accusations of racism in Blyton&#x27;s books were first made by Lena Jeger in the &quot;Guardian&quot; article published in 1966. In the context of discussing possible moves to restrict publications inciting racial hatred, Jeger was critical of Blyton&#x27;s &quot;The Little Black Doll&quot;, originally published in 1937. Sambo, the black doll of the title, is hated by his owner and other toys owing to his &quot;ugly black face&quot;, and runs away. A shower of &quot;magic rain&quot; washes his face clean, after which he is welcomed back home with his now pink face. Jamaica Kincaid also considers the Noddy books to be &quot;deeply racist&quot; because of the blonde children and the black golliwogs. In Blyton&#x27;s 1944 novel &quot;The Island of Adventure&quot;, a black servant named Jo-Jo is very intelligent, but is particularly cruel to the children.

Accusations of xenophobia were also made. As George Greenfield observed, &quot;Enid was very much part of that between the wars middle class which believed that foreigners were untrustworthy or funny or sometimes both&quot;. The publisher Macmillan conducted an internal assessment of Blyton&#x27;s &quot;The Mystery That Never Was&quot;, submitted to them at the height of her fame in 1960. The review was carried out by the author and books editor Phyllis Hartnoll, in whose view &quot;There is a faint but unattractive touch of old-fashioned xenophobia in the author&#x27;s attitude to the thieves; they are &#x27;foreign&#x27; ... and this seems to be regarded as sufficient to explain their criminality&quot;. Macmillan rejected the manuscript, but it was published by William Collins in 1961, and then again in 1965 and 1983.

Blyton&#x27;s depictions of boys and girls are considered by many critics to be sexist. In a &quot;Guardian&quot; article published in 2005, Lucy Mangan proposed that &quot;The Famous Five&quot; series depicts a power struggle between Julian, Dick and George (Georgina), in which the female characters either act like boys or are talked down to, as when Dick lectures George: &quot;it&#x27;s really time you gave up thinking you&#x27;re as good as a boy&quot;.

===Revisions to later editions===
To address criticisms levelled at Blyton&#x27;s work, some later editions have been altered to reflect more politically progressive attitudes towards issues such as race, gender, violence between young persons, the treatment of children by adults, and legal changes in Britain as to what is allowable for young children to do (e.g. purchasing fireworks) in the years since the stories were originally written; modern reprints of the Noddy series substitute teddy bears or goblins for golliwogs, for instance. The golliwogs who steal Noddy&#x27;s car and dump him naked in the Dark Wood in &quot;Here Comes Noddy Again&quot; are replaced in the 1986 revision by goblins, who strip Noddy only of his shoes and hat and return at the end of the story to apologise.

&quot;The Faraway Tree&quot;&#x27;s Dame Slap, who made regular use of corporal punishment, was changed to Dame Snap, who no longer did so, and the names of Dick and Fanny in the same series (respective slang terms in some dialects for male and female genitals) were changed to Rick and Frannie. Characters in the Malory Towers and St. Clare&#x27;s series are no longer spanked or threatened with a spanking but are instead scolded. References to George&#x27;s short hair making her look like a boy were removed in revisions to &quot;Five on a Hike Together&quot;, reflecting the idea that girls need not have long hair to be considered feminine or normal, as was Anne&#x27;s remark in &quot;The Famous Five&quot; that boys cannot wear pretty dresses or like girls&#x27; dolls. In &quot;The Adventurous Four&quot;, the names of the young twin girls were updated from Jill and Mary to Pippa and Zoe, among changes prompting the Enid Blyton Society&#x27;s organiser to argue that they were akin to having “a Virgin Express rushing past the Railway Children because the age of steam is over…. [W]e don&#x27;t want to ruin the charm of something that was written in a particular setting.”

In 2010, the publisher of the Famous Five series, Hodder, announced its intention to update the language used in the books, of which it sold more than half a million copies a year. The changes, which Hodder described as &quot;subtle&quot;, mainly affect the dialogue rather than the narrative. For instance, &quot;school tunic&quot; becomes &quot;uniform&quot;, &quot;mother and father&quot; and &quot;mother and daddy&quot; (this latter one used by young female characters and deemed sexist) become &quot;mum and dad&quot;, and &quot;bathing&quot; is replaced by &quot;swimming&quot; and &quot;jersey&quot; and &quot;pullover&quot; by &quot;jumper&quot;. Some commentators see the changes as necessary to encourage modern readers, whereas others regard them as unnecessary and patronising. In 2016, Hodder&#x27;s parent company, Hachette, announced that they would abandon the revisions, as readers&#x27; reaction showed they had not been a success.

==Stage, film and television adaptations==
In 1954, Blyton adapted Noddy for the stage, producing the &quot;Noddy in Toyland&quot; pantomime in just two or three weeks. The production was staged at the 2,660-seat Stoll Theatre in Kingsway, London at Christmas. Its popularity resulted in the show running during the Christmas season for five or six years. Blyton was delighted with its reception by children in the audience and attended the theatre three or four times a week. TV adaptations of Noddy since 1954 include one in the 1970s narrated by Richard Briers. In 1955, a stage play based on the Famous Five was produced, and in January 1997 the King&#x27;s Head Theatre embarked on a six-month tour of the UK with &quot;The Famous Five Musical&quot;, to commemorate Blyton&#x27;s centenary. On 21 November 1998, &quot;The Secret Seven Save the World&quot; was first performed at the Sherman Theatre in Cardiff.

There have also been several film and television adaptations of the Famous Five: by the Children&#x27;s Film Foundation in 1957 and 1964, Southern Television in 1978–79, and Zenith Productions in 1995–97. The series was also adapted for the German film &quot;Fünf Freunde&quot;, directed by Mike Marzuk and released in 2011.

St. Clare&#x27;s was adapted into a 1991 anime television series, &quot;Mischievous Twins: The Tales of St. Clare&#x27;s&quot;, by Tokyo Movie Shinsha.

The Comic Strip, a group of British comedians, produced two extreme parodies of the Famous Five for Channel 4 television: &quot;Five Go Mad in Dorset&quot;, broadcast in 1982, and &quot;Five Go Mad on Mescalin&quot;, broadcast the following year. A third in the series, &quot;Five Go to Rehab&quot;, was broadcast on Sky in 2012.

Blyton&#x27;s &quot;The Faraway Tree&quot; series of books has also been adapted to television and film. On 29 September 1997, the BBC began broadcasting an animated series called &quot;The Enchanted Lands&quot;, based on the series. In 2014, the publishers Hachette, the copyright owners, announced a deal with the production company run by Sam Mendes for a film adaptation of &quot;The Faraway Tree&quot; series. Marlene Johnson, for Hachette, said: &quot;Enid Blyton was a passionate advocate of children&#x27;s storytelling, and The Magic Faraway Tree is a fantastic example of her creative imagination.&quot;

Blyton&#x27;s &quot;Malory Towers&quot; has been adapted into a musical of the same name by Emma Rice&#x27;s theatre company. It was scheduled to do a UK spring tour in 2020, which has been postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

In 2020, &quot;Malory Towers&quot; was adapted as a 13 part TV series for the BBC. It is made partly in Toronto and partly in the UK in association with Canada&#x27;s Family Channel. The series went to air in the UK in April 2020 and has been renewed for three more series.

==Papers==
Seven Stories, the National Centre for Children&#x27;s Books in Newcastle upon Tyne, holds the largest public collection of Blyton&#x27;s papers and typescripts. The Seven Stories collection contains a significant number of Blyton&#x27;s typescripts, including the previously unpublished novel, &quot;Mr Tumpy&#x27;s Caravan&quot;, as well as personal papers and diaries. The purchase of the material in 2010 was made possible by special funding from the Heritage Lottery Fund, the MLA/V&amp;A Purchase Grant Fund, and two private donations.

<text>The Epipalaeolithic Near East designates the Epipalaeolithic (&quot;Final Old Stone Age&quot;, also known as Mesolithic) in the prehistory of the Near East. It is the period after the Upper Palaeolithic and before the Neolithic, between approximately 20,000 and 10,000 years Before Present (BP). The people of the Epipalaeolithic were nomadic hunter-gatherers who generally lived in small, seasonal camps rather than permanent villages. They made sophisticated stone tools using microliths—small, finely-produced blades that were hafted in wooden implements. These are the primary artifacts by which archaeologists recognise and classify Epipalaeolithic sites.

The start of the Epipalaeolithic is defined by the appearance of microliths. Although this is an arbitrary boundary, the Epipalaeolithic does differ significantly from the preceding Upper Palaeolithic. Epipalaeolithic sites are more numerous, better preserved, and can be accurately radiocarbon dated. The period coincides with the gradual retreat of glacial climatic conditions between the Last Glacial Maximum and the start of the Holocene, and it is characterised by population growth and economic intensification. The Epipalaeolithic ended with the &quot;Neolithic Revolution&quot; and the onset of domestication, food production, and sedentism, although archaeologists now recognise that these trends began in the Epipalaeolithic.

The period may be subdivided into Early, Middle and Late Epipalaeolithic: The Early Epipalaeolithic corresponds to the [[Kebaran]] culture, c. 20,000 to 14,500 years ago, the Middle Epipalaeolithic is the Geometric Kebaran or late phase of the Kebaran, and the Late Epipalaeolithic to the [[Natufian culture|Natufian]], 14,500–11,500 BP. The Natufian overlaps with the incipient Neolithic Revolution, the Pre-Pottery Neolithic A.

== Levant ==
===Early Epipalaeolithic===

The Early Epipalaeolithic, also known as Kebaran, lasted from 20,000 to 12,150 BP. It followed the Upper Paleolithic Levantine Aurignacian (formerly called Antelian) period throughout the Levant. By the end of the Levantine Aurignacian, gradual changes took place in stone industries. Small stone tools called microliths and retouched bladelets can be found for the first time. The microliths of this culture period differ markedly from the Aurignacian artifacts.

By 18,000 BP the climate and environment had changed, starting a period of transition. The Levant became more arid and the forest vegetation retreated, to be replaced by steppe. The cool and dry period ended at the beginning of Mesolithic 1. The hunter-gatherers of the Aurignacian would have had to modify their way of living and their pattern of settlement to adapt to the changing conditions. The crystallization of these new patterns resulted in Mesolithic 1. The people developed new types of settlements and new stone industries.

The inhabitants of a small Mesolithic 1 site in the Levant left little more than their chipped stone tools behind. The industry was of small tools made of bladelets struck off single-platform cores. Besides bladelets, burins and end-scrapers have been found. A few bone tools and some ground stones have also been found. These so-called Mesolithic sites of Asia are far less numerous than those of the Neolithic, and the archeological remains are very poor.

The type site is Kebara Cave south of Haifa. The Kebaran was characterized by small, geometric microliths. The people were thought to lack the specialized grinders and pounders found in later Near Eastern cultures.
The Kebaran is preceded by the Athlitian phase of the Levantine Aurignacian (formerly called Antelian) and followed by the proto-agrarian Natufian culture of the Epipalaeolithic. The appearance of the Kebaran culture, of microlithic type, implies a significant rupture in the cultural continuity of Levantine Upper Paleolithic. The Kebaran culture, with its use of microliths, is associated also with the use of the bow and arrow and the domestication of the dog. The Kebaran is also characterised by the earliest collecting and processing of wild cereals, known due to the excavation of grain-grinding tools. This was the first step towards the Neolithic Revolution. The Kebaran people are believed to have migrated seasonally, dispersing to upland environments in the summer, and gathering in caves and rock shelters near lowland lakes in the winter. This diversity of environments may be the reason for the variety of tools found in their toolkits.

The Kebaran is generally thought to have been ancestral to the later Natufian culture that occupied much of the same range.

====Harvesting of cereals====

The earliest evidence for the use of composite cereal harvesting tools are the glossed flint blades that have been found at the site of Ohalo II, a 23,000-year-old fisher-hunter-gatherers’ camp on the shore of the Sea of Galilee, Northern Palestine. The Ohalo site is dated at the junction of the Upper Paleolithic and the Early Epipalaeolithic, and has been attributed to both periods. The wear traces on the tools indicate that these were used for harvesting near-ripe, semi-green wild cereals, shortly before grains ripen enough to disperse naturally. The study shows that the tools were not used intensively, and they reflect two harvesting modes: flint knives held by hand and inserts hafted into a handle. The finds reveal the existence of cereal harvesting techniques and tools some 8,000 years before the Natufian, and 12,000 years before the establishment of sedentary farming communities in the Near East during the Neolithic Revolution. Furthermore, the new finds accord well with evidence for the earliest ever cereal cultivation at the site, and for the use of stone-made grinding implements.

====Artistic expression in the Kebaran culture====

Evidence for symbolic behavior of Late Pleistocene foragers in the Levant has been found in engraved limestone plaquettes from the Epipalaeolithic open-air site Ein Qashish South in the Jezreel Valley, Palestine. The engravings were uncovered in Kebaran and Geometric Kebaran deposits (ca. 23,000 and ca. 16,500 BP), and include the image of a bird, the first figurative representation known so far from a pre-Natufian Epipalaeolithic site, together with geometric motifs such as chevrons, cross-hatchings, and ladders. Some of the engravings closely resemble roughly contemporary European finds, and may be interpreted as &quot;systems of notations&quot; or &quot;artificial memory systems&quot; related to the timing of seasonal resources and related important events for nomadic groups.

Similar-looking signs and patterns are well known from the context of the local Natufian, a final Epipalaeolithic period when sedentary or semi-sedentary foragers started practicing agriculture.

===Late Epipalaeolithic===
The Late Epipalaeolithic is also called the Natufian culture. This period is characterized by the early rise of agriculture, which later emerged more fully in the Neolithic period. Radiocarbon dating places the Natufian culture between 12,500 and 9500 BCE, just before the end of the Pleistocene. This period is characterised by the beginning of agriculture.

The Natufian culture is commonly split into two subperiods: Early Natufian (12,500–10,800 BCE) (Christopher Delage gives 13,000–11,500 BP uncalibrated, equivalent to 13,700–11,500 BCE) and Late Natufian (10,800–9500 BCE). The Late Natufian most likely occurred in tandem with the Younger Dryas. The following period is often called the Pre-Pottery Neolithic.

== Other regions ==

=== Arabia ===
Until recently, it was thought that the Arabian Peninsula was too arid and inhospitable for human settlement in the Late Pleistocene. The earliest known sites belonged to the early Neolithic, c. 9000 to 8000 BP, and it was supposed that people were able to recolonise the region then due to the wetter climate of the early Holocene.

However, in 2014, archaeologists working in the southern Nefud desert discovered an Epipalaeolithic site dating to between 12,000 and 10,000 BP. The site is located in the Jubbah basin, a palaeolake which retained water in the otherwise dry conditions of the Terminal Pleistocene. The stone tools found bore a close resemblance to the Geometric Kebaran, a Levantine industry associated with the Middle Epipalaeolithic. The excavators of the site, therefore, proposed that northern Arabia was colonised by foragers from the Levant around 15,000 years ago. These groups may then have been cut off by the drying climate and retreated to &quot;refugia&quot; like the Jubbah palaeolake.

==Food sources==

The Epipalaeolithic is best understood when discussing the southern Levant, as the period is well documented due to good preservation at the sites, at least of animal remains. The most prevalent animal food sources in the Levant during this period were: deer, gazelle, and ibex of various species, and smaller animals including birds, lizards, foxes, tortoises, and hares. Less common were aurochs, wild equids, wild boar, wild cattle, and hartebeest. At Neve David near Haifa, 15 mammal species were found, and two reptile species. Despite then being very close to the coast, the rather small number of seashells found (7 genera) and the piercing of many, suggests these may have been collected as ornaments rather than food.

However, the period seems to be marked by an increase in plant foods and a decrease in meat-eating. Over 40 plant species have been found by analysing one site in the Jordan Valley, and some grains were processed and baked. Stones with evidence of grinding have been found. These were most likely the main food sources throughout the Pre-Pottery Neolithic A, which introduced the widespread agricultural growing of crops.

<doc id="10263" wikidata="Q35798" url="?curid=10263" title="Executive (government)">
<text>The executive branch is the part of government which executes or enforces the law.

== Function ==
The scope of executive power varies greatly depending on the political context in which it emerges, and it can change over time in a given country. In democratic countries, the executive often exercises broad influence over national politics, though limitations are often applied to the executive.

In political systems based on the separation of powers, government authority is distributed between several branches to prevent power from being concentrated in the hands of a single person or group. To achieve this, each branch is subject to checks by the other two; in general, the role of the legislature is to pass laws, which are then enforced by the executive, and interpreted by the judiciary. The executive can also be the source of certain types of law or law-derived rules, such as a decree or executive order.

In those that use fusion of powers, typically parliamentary systems, such as the United Kingdom, the executive forms the government, and its members generally belong to the political party that controls the legislature. Since the executive requires the support and approval of the legislature, the two bodies are &quot;fused&quot; together, rather than being independent. The principle of parliamentary sovereignty means powers possessed by the executive are solely dependent on those granted by the legislature, which can also subject its actions to judicial review. However, the executive often has wide-ranging powers stemming from the control of the government bureaucracy, especially in the areas of overall economic or foreign policy.

==Ministers==

In parliamentary systems, the executive is responsible to the elected legislature, which must maintain the confidence of the legislature or one part of it, if bicameral. In certain circumstances (varying by state), the legislature can express its lack of confidence in the executive, which causes either a change in the governing party or group of parties or a general election. Parliamentary systems have a head of government (who leads the executive, often called ministers) normally distinct from the head of state (who continues through governmental and electoral changes). In the Westminster type of parliamentary system, the principle of separation of powers is not as entrenched as in some others. Members of the executive (ministers), are also members of the legislature, and hence play an important part in both the writing and enforcing of law. In presidential systems, the directly elected head of government appoints the ministers. The ministers can be directly elected by the voters.

In this context, the executive consists of a leader or leader of an office or multiple offices. Specifically, the top leadership roles of the executive branch may include:
* head of state – often the monarch, the president or the supreme leader, the chief representative and living symbol of national unity.
** head of government – often the prime minister, overseeing the administration of all affairs of state.
*** defence minister – overseeing the armed forces, determining military policy, and managing external safety.
*** interior minister – overseeing the police forces, enforcing the law, and managing internal control.
*** foreign minister – overseeing the diplomatic service, determining foreign policy and managing foreign relations.
*** finance minister – overseeing the treasury, determining fiscal policy and managing national budget.
*** justice minister – overseeing criminal prosecutions, corrections, enforcement of court orders.

==Presidents and ministers==
In a presidential system, the leader of the executive is both the head of state and government. In some cases, such as South Korea, there is a Prime Minister who assists the President, but who is not the head of government but is the second in the chain.

In a parliamentary system, a cabinet minister responsible to the legislature is the head of government, while the head of state is usually a largely ceremonial monarch or president.

<doc id="10264" wikidata="Q8753" url="?curid=10264" title="Enrico Fermi">
<text>Enrico Fermi (; 29 September 1901 – 28 November 1954) was an Italian and naturalized American physicist, renowned for being the creator of the world&#x27;s first artificial nuclear reactor, the Chicago Pile-1, and a member of the Manhattan Project. He has been called the &quot;architect of the nuclear age&quot; and the &quot;architect of the atomic bomb&quot;. He was one of very few physicists to excel in both theoretical physics and experimental physics. Fermi was awarded the 1938 Nobel Prize in Physics for his work on induced radioactivity by neutron bombardment and for the discovery of transuranium elements. With his colleagues, Fermi filed several patents related to the use of nuclear power, all of which were taken over by the US government. He made significant contributions to the development of statistical mechanics, quantum theory, and nuclear and particle physics.

Fermi&#x27;s first major contribution involved the field of statistical mechanics. After Wolfgang Pauli formulated his exclusion principle in 1925, Fermi followed with a paper in which he applied the principle to an ideal gas, employing a statistical formulation now known as Fermi–Dirac statistics. Today, particles that obey the exclusion principle are called &quot;fermions&quot;. Pauli later postulated the existence of an uncharged invisible particle emitted along with an electron during beta decay, to satisfy the law of conservation of energy. Fermi took up this idea, developing a model that incorporated the postulated particle, which he named the &quot;neutrino&quot;. His theory, later referred to as Fermi&#x27;s interaction and now called weak interaction, described one of the four fundamental interactions in nature. Through experiments inducing radioactivity with the recently discovered neutron, Fermi discovered that slow neutrons were more easily captured by atomic nuclei than fast ones, and he developed the Fermi age equation to describe this. After bombarding thorium and uranium with slow neutrons, he concluded that he had created new elements. Although he was awarded the Nobel Prize for this discovery, the new elements were later revealed to be nuclear fission products.

Fermi left Italy in 1938 to escape new Italian racial laws that affected his Jewish wife, Laura Capon. He emigrated to the United States, where he worked on the Manhattan Project during World War II. Fermi led the team at the University of Chicago that designed and built Chicago Pile-1, which went critical on 2 December 1942, demonstrating the first human-created, self-sustaining nuclear chain reaction. He was on hand when the X-10 Graphite Reactor at Oak Ridge, Tennessee went critical in 1943, and when the B Reactor at the Hanford Site did so the next year. At Los Alamos, he headed F Division, part of which worked on Edward Teller&#x27;s thermonuclear &quot;Super&quot; bomb. He was present at the Trinity test on 16 July 1945, the first test of a full nuclear bomb explosion, where he used his Fermi method to estimate the bomb&#x27;s yield.

After the war, he helped establish the Institute for Nuclear Studies in Chicago, and served on the General Advisory Committee, chaired by J. Robert Oppenheimer, which advised the Atomic Energy Commission on nuclear matters. After the detonation of the first Soviet fission bomb in August 1949, he strongly opposed the development of a hydrogen bomb on both moral and technical grounds. He was among the scientists who testified on Oppenheimer&#x27;s behalf at the 1954 hearing that resulted in the denial of Oppenheimer&#x27;s security clearance. 

Fermi did important work in particle physics, especially related to pions and muons, and he speculated that cosmic rays arose when the material was accelerated by magnetic fields in interstellar space. Many awards, concepts, and institutions are named after Fermi, including the Fermi 1 (breeder reactor), the Enrico Fermi Nuclear Generating Station, the Enrico Fermi Award, the Enrico Fermi Institute, the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (Fermilab), the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope, the Fermi paradox, and the synthetic element fermium, making him one of 16 scientists who have elements named after them.

== Early life ==

Enrico Fermi was born in Rome, Italy, on 29 September 1901. He was the third child of Alberto Fermi, a division head in the Ministry of Railways, and Ida de Gattis, an elementary school teacher. His sister, Maria, was two years older, his brother Giulio a year older. After the two boys were sent to a rural community to be wet nursed, Enrico rejoined his family in Rome when he was two and a half. Although he was baptized a Catholic in accordance with his grandparents&#x27; wishes, his family was not particularly religious; Enrico was an agnostic throughout his adult life. As a young boy, he shared the same interests as his brother Giulio, building electric motors and playing with electrical and mechanical toys. Giulio died during an operation on a throat abscess in 1915 and Maria died in an airplane crash near Milan in 1959.

At a local market in Campo de&#x27; Fiori, Fermi found a physics book, the 900-page &quot;Elementorum physicae mathematicae&quot;. Written in Latin by Jesuit Father , a professor at the Collegio Romano, it presented mathematics, classical mechanics, astronomy, optics, and acoustics as they were understood at the time of its 1840 publication. With a scientifically inclined friend, Enrico Persico, Fermi pursued projects such as building gyroscopes and measuring the acceleration of Earth&#x27;s gravity.

In 1914, Fermi, who used to often meet with his father in front of the office after work, met a colleague of his father called Adolfo Amidei, who would walk part of the way home with Alberto. Enrico had learned that Adolfo was interested in mathematics and physics and took the opportunity to ask Adolfo a question about geometry. Adolfo understood that the young Fermi was referring to projective geometry and then proceeded to give him a book on the subject written by Theodor Reye. Two months later, Fermi returned the book, having solved all the problems proposed at the end of the book, some of which Adolfo considered difficult. Upon verifying this, Adolfo felt that Fermi was &quot;a prodigy, at least with respect to geometry&quot;, and further mentored the boy, providing him with more books on physics and mathematics. Adolfo noted that Fermi had a very good memory and thus could return the books after having read them because he could remember their content very well.

== &quot;Scuola Normale Superiore&quot; in Pisa ==

Fermi graduated from high school in July 1918, having skipped the third year entirely. At Amidei&#x27;s urging, Fermi learned German to be able to read the many scientific papers that were published in that language at the time, and he applied to the &quot;Scuola Normale Superiore&quot; in Pisa. Amidei felt that the Scuola would provide better conditions for Fermi&#x27;s development than the Sapienza University of Rome could at the time. Having lost one son, Fermi&#x27;s parents only reluctantly allowed him to live in the school&#x27;s lodgings away from Rome for four years. Fermi took first place in the difficult entrance exam, which included an essay on the theme of &quot;Specific characteristics of Sounds&quot;; the 17-year-old Fermi chose to use Fourier analysis to derive and solve the partial differential equation for a vibrating rod, and after interviewing Fermi the examiner declared he would become an outstanding physicist.

At the &quot;Scuola Normale Superiore&quot;, Fermi played pranks with fellow student Franco Rasetti; the two became close friends and collaborators. Fermi was advised by Luigi Puccianti, director of the physics laboratory, who said there was little he could teach Fermi and often asked Fermi to teach him something instead. Fermi&#x27;s knowledge of quantum physics was such that Puccianti asked him to organize seminars on the topic. During this time Fermi learned tensor calculus, a technique key to general relativity. Fermi initially chose mathematics as his major but soon switched to physics. He remained largely self-taught, studying general relativity, quantum mechanics, and atomic physics.

In September 1920, Fermi was admitted to the physics department. Since there were only three students in the department—Fermi, Rasetti, and Nello Carrara—Puccianti let them freely use the laboratory for whatever purposes they chose. Fermi decided that they should research X-ray crystallography, and the three worked to produce a Laue photograph—an X-ray photograph of a crystal. During 1921, his third year at the university, Fermi published his first scientific works in the Italian journal &quot;Nuovo Cimento&quot;. The first was entitled &quot;On the dynamics of a rigid system of electrical charges in translational motion&quot; (&#x27;). A sign of things to come was that the mass was expressed as a tensor—a mathematical construct commonly used to describe something moving and changing in three-dimensional space. In classical mechanics, mass is a scalar quantity, but in relativity, it changes with velocity. The second paper was &quot;On the electrostatics of a uniform gravitational field of electromagnetic charges and on the weight of electromagnetic charges&quot; (&#x27;). Using general relativity, Fermi showed that a charge has a weight equal to U/c2, where U is the electrostatic energy of the system, and c is the speed of light.

The first paper seemed to point out a contradiction between the electrodynamic theory and the relativistic one concerning the calculation of the electromagnetic masses, as the former predicted a value of 4/3 U/c2. Fermi addressed this the next year in a paper &quot;Concerning a contradiction between electrodynamic and the relativistic theory of electromagnetic mass&quot; in which he showed that the apparent contradiction was a consequence of relativity. This paper was sufficiently well-regarded that it was translated into German and published in the German scientific journal &quot;Physikalische Zeitschrift&quot; in 1922. That year, Fermi submitted his article &quot;On the phenomena occurring near a world line&quot; (&#x27;) to the Italian journal &#x27;. In this article, he examined the Principle of Equivalence, and introduced the so-called &quot;Fermi coordinates&quot;. He proved that on a world line close to the timeline, space behaves as if it were a Euclidean space.
Fermi submitted his thesis, &quot;A theorem on probability and some of its applications&quot; (&quot;&quot;), to the &quot;Scuola Normale Superiore&quot; in July 1922, and received his laurea at the unusually young age of 20. The thesis was on X-ray diffraction images. Theoretical physics was not yet considered a discipline in Italy, and the only thesis that would have been accepted was experimental physics. For this reason, Italian physicists were slow to embrace the new ideas like relativity coming from Germany. Since Fermi was quite at home in the lab doing experimental work, this did not pose insurmountable problems for him.

While writing the appendix for the Italian edition of the book &quot;Fundamentals of Einstein Relativity&quot; by August Kopff in 1923, Fermi was the first to point out that hidden inside the Einstein equation () was an enormous amount of nuclear potential energy to be exploited. &quot;It does not seem possible, at least in the near future&quot;, he wrote, &quot;to find a way to release these dreadful amounts of energy—which is all to the good because the first effect of an explosion of such a dreadful amount of energy would be to smash into smithereens the physicist who had the misfortune to find a way to do it.&quot;

In 1924, Fermi was initiated into the Masonic Lodge &quot;Adriano Lemmi&quot; of the Grand Orient of Italy.

In 1923–1924, Fermi spent a semester studying under Max Born at the University of Göttingen, where he met Werner Heisenberg and Pascual Jordan. Fermi then studied in Leiden with Paul Ehrenfest from September to December 1924 on a fellowship from the Rockefeller Foundation obtained through the intercession of the mathematician Vito Volterra. Here Fermi met Hendrik Lorentz and Albert Einstein, and became friends with Samuel Goudsmit and Jan Tinbergen. From January 1925 to late 1926, Fermi taught mathematical physics and theoretical mechanics at the University of Florence, where he teamed up with Rasetti to conduct a series of experiments on the effects of magnetic fields on mercury vapour. He also participated in seminars at the Sapienza University of Rome, giving lectures on quantum mechanics and solid state physics. While giving lectures on the new quantum mechanics based on the remarkable accuracy of predictions of the Schrödinger equation, Fermi would often say, &quot;It has no business to fit so well!&quot;

After Wolfgang Pauli announced his exclusion principle in 1925, Fermi responded with a paper &quot;On the quantization of the perfect monoatomic gas&quot; (&quot;&quot;), in which he applied the exclusion principle to an ideal gas. The paper was especially notable for Fermi&#x27;s statistical formulation, which describes the distribution of particles in systems of many identical particles that obey the exclusion principle. This was independently developed soon after by the British physicist Paul Dirac, who also showed how it was related to the Bose–Einstein statistics. Accordingly, it is now known as Fermi–Dirac statistics. After Dirac, particles that obey the exclusion principle are today called &quot;fermions&quot;, while those that do not are called &quot;bosons&quot;.

== Professor in Rome ==
Professorships in Italy were granted by competition (&quot;&quot;) for a vacant chair, the applicants being rated on their publications by a committee of professors. Fermi applied for a chair of mathematical physics at the University of Cagliari on Sardinia but was narrowly passed over in favour of Giovanni Giorgi. In 1926, at the age of 24, he applied for a professorship at the Sapienza University of Rome. This was a new chair, one of the first three in theoretical physics in Italy, that had been created by the Minister of Education at the urging of professor Orso Mario Corbino, who was the university&#x27;s professor of experimental physics, the director of the Institute of Physics, and a member of Benito Mussolini&#x27;s cabinet. Corbino, who also chaired the selection committee, hoped that the new chair would raise the standard and reputation of physics in Italy. The committee chose Fermi ahead of Enrico Persico and Aldo Pontremoli, and Corbino helped Fermi recruit his team, which was soon joined by notable students such as Edoardo Amaldi, Bruno Pontecorvo, Ettore Majorana and Emilio Segrè, and by Franco Rasetti, whom Fermi had appointed as his assistant. They soon nicknamed the &quot;Via Panisperna boys&quot; after the street where the Institute of Physics was located.

Fermi married Laura Capon, a science student at the university, on 19 July 1928. They had two children: Nella, born in January 1931, and Giulio, born in February 1936. On 18 March 1929, Fermi was appointed a member of the Royal Academy of Italy by Mussolini, and on 27 April he joined the Fascist Party. He later opposed Fascism when the 1938 racial laws were promulgated by Mussolini in order to bring Italian Fascism ideologically closer to German Nazism. These laws threatened Laura, who was Jewish, and put many of Fermi&#x27;s research assistants out of work.

During their time in Rome, Fermi and his group made important contributions to many practical and theoretical aspects of physics. In 1928, he published his &quot;Introduction to Atomic Physics&quot; (&quot;&quot;), which provided Italian university students with an up-to-date and accessible text. Fermi also conducted public lectures and wrote popular articles for scientists and teachers in order to spread knowledge of the new physics as widely as possible. Part of his teaching method was to gather his colleagues and graduate students together at the end of the day and go over a problem, often from his own research. A sign of success was that foreign students now began to come to Italy. The most notable of these was the German physicist Hans Bethe, who came to Rome as a Rockefeller Foundation fellow, and collaborated with Fermi on a 1932 paper &quot;On the Interaction between Two Electrons&quot; ().

At this time, physicists were puzzled by beta decay, in which an electron was emitted from the atomic nucleus. To satisfy the law of conservation of energy, Pauli postulated the existence of an invisible particle with no charge and little or no mass that was also emitted at the same time. Fermi took up this idea, which he developed in a tentative paper in 1933, and then a longer paper the next year that incorporated the postulated particle, which Fermi called a &quot;neutrino&quot;. His theory, later referred to as Fermi&#x27;s interaction, and still later as the theory of the weak interaction, described one of the four fundamental forces of nature. The neutrino was detected after his death, and his interaction theory showed why it was so difficult to detect. When he submitted his paper to the British journal &quot;Nature&quot;, that journal&#x27;s editor turned it down because it contained speculations which were &quot;too remote from physical reality to be of interest to readers&quot;. According to Fermi&#x27;s biographer David N. Schwartz, it is at least strange that Fermi seriously requested publication from the journal, since at that time &quot;Nature&quot; only published short notes on articles of this kind, and was not suitable for the publication of even a new physical theory. More suitable, if anything, would have been the &quot;Proceedings of the Royal Society of London&quot;. He agrees with some scholars&#x27; hypothesis, according to which the rejection of the British magazine convinced his young colleagues (some of them Jews and leftists) to give up the boycott of German scientific magazines, after Hitler came to power in January 1933. Thus Fermi saw the theory published in Italian and German before it was published in English.

In the introduction to the 1968 English translation, physicist Fred L. Wilson noted that:

In January 1934, Irène Joliot-Curie and Frédéric Joliot announced that they had bombarded elements with alpha particles and induced radioactivity in them. By March, Fermi&#x27;s assistant Gian-Carlo Wick had provided a theoretical explanation using Fermi&#x27;s theory of beta decay. Fermi decided to switch to experimental physics, using the neutron, which James Chadwick had discovered in 1932. In March 1934, Fermi wanted to see if he could induce radioactivity with Rasetti&#x27;s polonium-beryllium neutron source. Neutrons had no electric charge, and so would not be deflected by the positively charged nucleus. This meant that they needed much less energy to penetrate the nucleus than charged particles, and so would not require a particle accelerator, which the Via Panisperna boys did not have.
Fermi had the idea to resort to replacing the polonium-beryllium neutron source with a radon-beryllium one, which he created by filling a glass bulb with beryllium powder, evacuating the air, and then adding 50 mCi of radon gas, supplied by . This created a much stronger neutron source, the effectiveness of which declined with the 3.8-day half-life of radon. He knew that this source would also emit gamma rays, but, on the basis of his theory, he believed that this would not affect the results of the experiment. He started by bombarding platinum, an element with a high atomic number that was readily available, without success. He turned to aluminium, which emitted an alpha particle and produced sodium, which then decayed into magnesium by beta particle emission. He tried lead, without success, and then fluorine in the form of calcium fluoride, which emitted an alpha particle and produced nitrogen, decaying into oxygen by beta particle emission. In all, he induced radioactivity in 22 different elements. Fermi rapidly reported the discovery of neutron-induced radioactivity in the Italian journal &quot;La Ricerca Scientifica&quot; on 25 March 1934.

The natural radioactivity of thorium and uranium made it hard to determine what was happening when these elements were bombarded with neutrons but, after correctly eliminating the presence of elements lighter than uranium but heavier than lead, Fermi concluded that they had created new elements, which he called ausenium and hesperium. The chemist Ida Noddack suggested that some of the experiments could have produced lighter elements than lead rather than new, heavier elements. Her suggestion was not taken seriously at the time because her team had not carried out any experiments with uranium or built the theoretical basis for this possibility. At that time, fission was thought to be improbable if not impossible on theoretical grounds. While physicists expected elements with higher atomic numbers to form from neutron bombardment of lighter elements, nobody expected neutrons to have enough energy to split a heavier atom into two light element fragments in the manner that Noddack suggested.
The Via Panisperna boys also noticed some unexplained effects. The experiment seemed to work better on a wooden table than on a marble tabletop. Fermi remembered that Joliot-Curie and Chadwick had noted that paraffin wax was effective at slowing neutrons, so he decided to try that. When neutrons were passed through paraffin wax, they induced a hundred times as much radioactivity in silver compared with when it was bombarded without the paraffin. Fermi guessed that this was due to the hydrogen atoms in the paraffin. Those in wood similarly explained the difference between the wooden and the marble tabletops. This was confirmed by repeating the effect with water. He concluded that collisions with hydrogen atoms slowed the neutrons. The lower the atomic number of the nucleus it collides with, the more energy a neutron loses per collision, and therefore the fewer collisions that are required to slow a neutron down by a given amount. Fermi realised that this induced more radioactivity because slow neutrons were more easily captured than fast ones. He developed a diffusion equation to describe this, which became known as the Fermi age equation.

In 1938, Fermi received the Nobel Prize in Physics at the age of 37 for his &quot;demonstrations of the existence of new radioactive elements produced by neutron irradiation, and for his related discovery of nuclear reactions brought about by slow neutrons&quot;. After Fermi received the prize in Stockholm, he did not return home to Italy but rather continued to New York City with his family in December 1938, where they applied for permanent residency. The decision to move to America and become US citizens was due primarily to the racial laws in Italy.

== Manhattan Project ==


Fermi arrived in New York City on 2 January 1939. He was immediately offered positions at five universities, and accepted one at Columbia University, where he had already given summer lectures in 1936. He received the news that in December 1938, the German chemists Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann had detected the element barium after bombarding uranium with neutrons, which Lise Meitner and her nephew Otto Frisch correctly interpreted as the result of nuclear fission. Frisch confirmed this experimentally on 13 January 1939. The news of Meitner and Frisch&#x27;s interpretation of Hahn and Strassmann&#x27;s discovery crossed the Atlantic with Niels Bohr, who was to lecture at Princeton University. Isidor Isaac Rabi and Willis Lamb, two Columbia University physicists working at Princeton, found out about it and carried it back to Columbia. Rabi said he told Enrico Fermi, but Fermi later gave the credit to Lamb:
Noddack was proven right after all. Fermi had dismissed the possibility of fission on the basis of his calculations, but he had not taken into account the binding energy that would appear when a nuclide with an odd number of neutrons absorbed an extra neutron. For Fermi, the news came as a profound embarrassment, as the transuranic elements that he had partly been awarded the Nobel Prize for discovering had not been transuranic elements at all, but fission products. He added a footnote to this effect to his Nobel Prize acceptance speech.

The scientists at Columbia decided that they should try to detect the energy released in the nuclear fission of uranium when bombarded by neutrons. On 25 January 1939, in the basement of Pupin Hall at Columbia, an experimental team including Fermi conducted the first nuclear fission experiment in the United States. The other members of the team were Herbert L. Anderson, Eugene T. Booth, John R. Dunning, G. Norris Glasoe, and Francis G. Slack. The next day, the fifth Washington Conference on Theoretical Physics began in Washington, D.C. under the joint auspices of George Washington University and the Carnegie Institution of Washington. There, the news on nuclear fission was spread even further, fostering many more experimental demonstrations.

French scientists Hans von Halban, Lew Kowarski, and Frédéric Joliot-Curie had demonstrated that uranium bombarded by neutrons emitted more neutrons than it absorbed, suggesting the possibility of a chain reaction. Fermi and Anderson did so too a few weeks later. Leó Szilárd obtained of uranium oxide from Canadian radium producer Eldorado Gold Mines Limited, allowing Fermi and Anderson to conduct experiments with fission on a much larger scale. Fermi and Szilárd collaborated on the design of a device to achieve a self-sustaining nuclear reaction—a nuclear reactor. Owing to the rate of absorption of neutrons by the hydrogen in water, it was unlikely that a self-sustaining reaction could be achieved with natural uranium and water as a neutron moderator. Fermi suggested, based on his work with neutrons, that the reaction could be achieved with uranium oxide blocks and graphite as a moderator instead of water. This would reduce the neutron capture rate, and in theory make a self-sustaining chain reaction possible. Szilárd came up with a workable design: a pile of uranium oxide blocks interspersed with graphite bricks. Szilárd, Anderson, and Fermi published a paper on &quot;Neutron Production in Uranium&quot;. But their work habits and personalities were different, and Fermi had trouble working with Szilárd.

Fermi was among the first to warn military leaders about the potential impact of nuclear energy, giving a lecture on the subject at the Navy Department on 18 March 1939. The response fell short of what he had hoped for, although the Navy agreed to provide $1,500 towards further research at Columbia. Later that year, Szilárd, Eugene Wigner, and Edward Teller sent the letter signed by Einstein to US president Franklin D. Roosevelt, warning that Nazi Germany was likely to build an atomic bomb. In response, Roosevelt formed the Advisory Committee on Uranium to investigate the matter.

The Advisory Committee on Uranium provided money for Fermi to buy graphite, and he built a pile of graphite bricks on the seventh floor of the Pupin Hall laboratory. By August 1941, he had six tons of uranium oxide and thirty tons of graphite, which he used to build a still larger pile in Schermerhorn Hall at Columbia.

The S-1 Section of the Office of Scientific Research and Development, as the Advisory Committee on Uranium was now known, met on 18 December 1941, with the US now engaged in World War II, making its work urgent. Most of the effort sponsored by the committee had been directed at producing enriched uranium, but Committee member Arthur Compton determined that a feasible alternative was plutonium, which could be mass-produced in nuclear reactors by the end of 1944. He decided to concentrate the plutonium work at the University of Chicago. Fermi reluctantly moved, and his team became part of the new Metallurgical Laboratory there.

The possible results of a self-sustaining nuclear reaction were unknown, so it seemed inadvisable to build the first nuclear reactor on the University of Chicago campus in the middle of the city. Compton found a location in the Argonne Woods Forest Preserve, about from Chicago. Stone &amp; Webster was contracted to develop the site, but the work was halted by an industrial dispute. Fermi then persuaded Compton that he could build the reactor in the squash court under the stands of the University of Chicago&#x27;s Stagg Field. Construction of the pile began on 6 November 1942, and Chicago Pile-1 went critical on 2 December. The shape of the pile was intended to be roughly spherical, but as work proceeded Fermi calculated that criticality could be achieved without finishing the entire pile as planned.

This experiment was a landmark in the quest for energy, and it was typical of Fermi&#x27;s approach. Every step was carefully planned, and every calculation was meticulously done. When the first self-sustained nuclear chain reaction was achieved, Compton made a coded phone call to James B. Conant, the chairman of the National Defense Research Committee.

To continue the research where it would not pose a public health hazard, the reactor was disassembled and moved to the Argonne Woods site. There Fermi directed experiments on nuclear reactions, reveling in the opportunities provided by the reactor&#x27;s abundant production of free neutrons. The laboratory soon branched out from physics and engineering into using the reactor for biological and medical research. Initially, Argonne was run by Fermi as part of the University of Chicago, but it became a separate entity with Fermi as its director in May 1944.

When the air-cooled X-10 Graphite Reactor at Oak Ridge went critical on 4 November 1943, Fermi was on hand just in case something went wrong. The technicians woke him early so that he could see it happen. Getting X-10 operational was another milestone in the plutonium project. It provided data on reactor design, training for DuPont staff in reactor operation, and produced the first small quantities of reactor-bred plutonium. Fermi became an American citizen in July 1944, the earliest date the law allowed.

In September 1944, Fermi inserted the first uranium fuel slug into the B Reactor at the Hanford Site, the production reactor designed to breed plutonium in large quantities. Like X-10, it had been designed by Fermi&#x27;s team at the Metallurgical Laboratory and built by DuPont, but it was much larger and was water-cooled. Over the next few days, 838 tubes were loaded, and the reactor went critical. Shortly after midnight on 27 September, the operators began to withdraw the control rods to initiate production. At first, all appeared to be well, but around 03:00, the power level started to drop and by 06:30 the reactor had shut down completely. The Army and DuPont turned to Fermi&#x27;s team for answers. The cooling water was investigated to see if there was a leak or contamination. The next day the reactor suddenly started up again, only to shut down once more a few hours later. The problem was traced to neutron poisoning from xenon-135 or Xe-135, a fission product with a half-life of 9.1 to 9.4 hours. Fermi and John Wheeler both deduced that Xe-135 was responsible for absorbing neutrons in the reactor, thereby sabotaging the fission process. Fermi was recommended by colleague Emilio Segrè to ask Chien-Shiung Wu, as she prepared a printed draft on this topic to be published by the Physical Review. Upon reading the draft, Fermi and the scientists confirmed their suspicions: Xe-135 indeed absorbed neutrons, in fact it had a huge neutron cross-section. DuPont had deviated from the Metallurgical Laboratory&#x27;s original design in which the reactor had 1,500 tubes arranged in a circle, and had added 504 tubes to fill in the corners. The scientists had originally considered this over-engineering a waste of time and money, but Fermi realized that if all 2,004 tubes were loaded, the reactor could reach the required power level and efficiently produce plutonium.

In April 1943, Fermi raised with Robert Oppenheimer the possibility of using the radioactive byproducts from enrichment to contaminate the German food supply. The background was fear that the German atomic bomb project was already at an advanced stage, and Fermi was also sceptical at the time that an atomic bomb could be developed quickly enough. Oppenheimer discussed the &quot;promising&quot; proposal with Edward Teller, who suggested the use of strontium-90. James B. Conant and Leslie Groves were also briefed, but Oppenheimer wanted to proceed with the plan only if enough food could be contaminated with the weapon to kill half a million people.

In mid-1944, Oppenheimer persuaded Fermi to join his Project Y at Los Alamos, New Mexico. Arriving in September, Fermi was appointed an associate director of the laboratory, with broad responsibility for nuclear and theoretical physics, and was placed in charge of F Division, which was named after him. F Division had four branches: F-1 Super and General Theory under Teller, which investigated the &quot;Super&quot; (thermonuclear) bomb; F-2 Water Boiler under L. D. P. King, which looked after the &quot;water boiler&quot; aqueous homogeneous research reactor; F-3 Super Experimentation under Egon Bretscher; and F-4 Fission Studies under Anderson. Fermi observed the Trinity test on 16 July 1945 and conducted an experiment to estimate the bomb&#x27;s yield by dropping strips of paper into the blast wave. He paced off the distance they were blown by the explosion, and calculated the yield as ten kilotons of TNT; the actual yield was about 18.6 kilotons.

Along with Oppenheimer, Compton, and Ernest Lawrence, Fermi was part of the scientific panel that advised the Interim Committee on target selection. The panel agreed with the committee that atomic bombs would be used without warning against an industrial target. Like others at the Los Alamos Laboratory, Fermi found out about the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki from the public address system in the technical area. Fermi did not believe that atomic bombs would deter nations from starting wars, nor did he think that the time was ripe for world government. He therefore did not join the Association of Los Alamos Scientists.

== Postwar work ==
Fermi became the Charles H. Swift Distinguished Professor of Physics at the University of Chicago on 1 July 1945, although he did not depart the Los Alamos Laboratory with his family until 31 December 1945. He was elected a member of the US National Academy of Sciences in 1945. The Metallurgical Laboratory became the Argonne National Laboratory on 1 July 1946, the first of the national laboratories established by the Manhattan Project. The short distance between Chicago and Argonne allowed Fermi to work at both places. At Argonne he continued experimental physics, investigating neutron scattering with Leona Marshall. He also discussed theoretical physics with Maria Mayer, helping her develop insights into spin–orbit coupling that would lead to her receiving the Nobel Prize.

The Manhattan Project was replaced by the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) on 1 January 1947. Fermi served on the AEC General Advisory Committee, an influential scientific committee chaired by Robert Oppenheimer. He also liked to spend a few weeks each year at the Los Alamos National Laboratory, where he collaborated with Nicholas Metropolis, and with John von Neumann on Rayleigh–Taylor instability, the science of what occurs at the border between two fluids of different densities.
After the detonation of the first Soviet fission bomb in August 1949, Fermi, along with Isidor Rabi, wrote a strongly worded report for the committee, opposing the development of a hydrogen bomb on moral and technical grounds. Nonetheless, Fermi continued to participate in work on the hydrogen bomb at Los Alamos as a consultant. Along with Stanislaw Ulam, he calculated that not only would the amount of tritium needed for Teller&#x27;s model of a thermonuclear weapon be prohibitive, but a fusion reaction could still not be assured to propagate even with this large quantity of tritium. Fermi was among the scientists who testified on Oppenheimer&#x27;s behalf at the Oppenheimer security hearing in 1954 that resulted in the denial of Oppenheimer&#x27;s security clearance.

In his later years, Fermi continued teaching at the University of Chicago, where he was a founder of what later became the Enrico Fermi Institute. His PhD students in the postwar period included Owen Chamberlain, Geoffrey Chew, Jerome Friedman, Marvin Goldberger, Tsung-Dao Lee, Arthur Rosenfeld and Sam Treiman. Jack Steinberger was a graduate student, and Mildred Dresselhaus was highly influenced by Fermi during the year she overlapped with him as a PhD student. Fermi conducted important research in particle physics, especially related to pions and muons. He made the first predictions of pion-nucleon resonance, relying on statistical methods, since he reasoned that exact answers were not required when the theory was wrong anyway. In a paper coauthored with Chen Ning Yang, he speculated that pions might actually be composite particles. The idea was elaborated by Shoichi Sakata. It has since been supplanted by the quark model, in which the pion is made up of quarks, which completed Fermi&#x27;s model, and vindicated his approach.

Fermi wrote a paper &quot;On the Origin of Cosmic Radiation&quot; in which he proposed that cosmic rays arose through material being accelerated by magnetic fields in interstellar space, which led to a difference of opinion with Teller. Fermi examined the issues surrounding magnetic fields in the arms of a spiral galaxy. He mused about what is now referred to as the &quot;Fermi paradox&quot;: the contradiction between the presumed probability of the existence of extraterrestrial life and the fact that contact has not been made.
Toward the end of his life, Fermi questioned his faith in society at large to make wise choices about nuclear technology. He said:

== Death ==
Fermi underwent what was called an &quot;exploratory&quot; operation in Billings Memorial Hospital in October 1954, after which he returned home. Fifty days later he died of inoperable stomach cancer in his home in Chicago. He was 53. Fermi suspected working near the nuclear pile involved great risk but he pressed on because he felt the benefits outweighed the risks to his personal safety. Two of his graduate student assistants working near the pile also died of cancer.

A memorial service was held at the University of Chicago chapel, where colleagues Samuel K. Allison, Emilio Segrè, and Herbert L. Anderson spoke to mourn the loss of one of the world&#x27;s &quot;most brilliant and productive physicists.&quot; His body was interred at Oak Woods Cemetery where a private graveside service for the immediate family took place presided by a Lutheran chaplain.

== Impact and legacy ==
=== Legacy ===
Fermi received numerous awards in recognition of his achievements, including the Matteucci Medal in 1926, the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1938, the Hughes Medal in 1942, the Franklin Medal in 1947, and the Rumford Prize in 1953. He was awarded the Medal for Merit in 1946 for his contribution to the Manhattan Project. Fermi was elected member of the American Philosophical Society in 1939 and a Foreign Member of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1950. The Basilica of Santa Croce, Florence, known as the &quot;Temple of Italian Glories&quot; for its many graves of artists, scientists and prominent figures in Italian history, has a plaque commemorating Fermi. In 1999, &quot;Time&quot; named Fermi on its list of the top 100 persons of the twentieth century. Fermi was widely regarded as an unusual case of a 20th-century physicist who excelled both theoretically and experimentally. Chemist and novelist C. P. Snow wrote, &quot;if Fermi had been born a few years earlier, one could well imagine him discovering Rutherford&#x27;s atomic nucleus, and then developing Bohr&#x27;s theory of the hydrogen atom. If this sounds like hyperbole, anything about Fermi is likely to sound like hyperbole&quot;.

Fermi was known as an inspiring teacher and was noted for his attention to detail, simplicity, and careful preparation of his lectures. Later, his lecture notes were transcribed into books. His papers and notebooks are today at the University of Chicago. Victor Weisskopf noted how Fermi &quot;always managed to find the simplest and most direct approach, with the minimum of complication and sophistication.&quot; He disliked complicated theories, and while he had great mathematical ability, he would never use it when the job could be done much more simply. He was famous for getting quick and accurate answers to problems that would stump other people. Later on, his method of getting approximate and quick answers through back-of-the-envelope calculations became informally known as the &quot;Fermi method&quot;, and is widely taught.

Fermi was fond of pointing out that when Alessandro Volta was working in his laboratory, Volta had no idea where the study of electricity would lead. Fermi is generally remembered for his work on nuclear power and nuclear weapons, especially the creation of the first nuclear reactor, and the development of the first atomic and hydrogen bombs. His scientific work has stood the test of time. This includes his theory of beta decay, his work with non-linear systems, his discovery of the effects of slow neutrons, his study of pion-nucleon collisions, and his Fermi–Dirac statistics. His speculation that a pion was not a fundamental particle pointed the way towards the study of quarks and leptons.

=== Things named after Fermi ===

Many things bear Fermi&#x27;s name. These include the Fermilab particle accelerator and physics lab in Batavia, Illinois, which was renamed in his honour in 1974, and the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope, which was named after him in 2008, in recognition of his work on cosmic rays. Three nuclear reactor installations have been named after him: the Fermi 1 and Fermi 2 nuclear power plants in Newport, Michigan, the Enrico Fermi Nuclear Power Plant at Trino Vercellese in Italy, and the RA-1 Enrico Fermi research reactor in Argentina. A synthetic element isolated from the debris of the 1952 Ivy Mike nuclear test was named fermium, in honor of Fermi&#x27;s contributions to the scientific community. This makes him one of 16 scientists who have elements named after them.

Since 1956, the United States Atomic Energy Commission has named its highest honour, the Fermi Award, after him. Recipients of the award have included Otto Hahn, Robert Oppenheimer, Edward Teller and Hans Bethe.

<text>The editor war is the rivalry between users of the Emacs and vi (now usually Vim, or more recently Neovim) text editors. The rivalry has become an enduring part of hacker culture and the free software community.

The Emacs versus vi debate was one of the original &quot;holy wars&quot; conducted on Usenet groups. Since at least 1985, many flame wars have occurred between those insisting that their editor of choice is the of editing perfection, and insulting the opposing group accordingly. Related battles have been fought over operating systems, programming languages, version control systems, and even source code indent style.

==Background==
, both Emacs and vi can lay claim to being among the longest-lived application programs of all time, as well as being the two most commonly used text editors on Linux and Unix. Many operating systems, especially Linux and BSD derivatives, bundle multiple text editors with the operating system to cater to user demand. For example, a default installation of macOS contains ed, pico (nano before MacOS Ventura 12.3), TextEdit, and Vim.

==Humor==

The Church of Emacs, formed by Emacs and the GNU Project&#x27;s creator Richard Stallman, is a parody religion. While it refers to vi as the &quot;editor of the beast&quot; (vi-vi-vi being 6-6-6 in Roman numerals), it does not oppose the use of vi; rather, it calls proprietary software a case of anathema. (&quot;Using a free version of vi is not a sin but a penance.&quot;) The Church of Emacs has its own newsgroup, alt.religion.emacs, that has posts purporting to support this belief system.

Regarding vi&#x27;s modal nature (a common point of frustration for new users), some Emacs users joke that vi has two modes – &quot;beep repeatedly&quot; and &quot;break everything&quot;. vi users enjoy joking that Emacs&#x27;s key-sequences induce carpal tunnel syndrome, or mentioning one of many satirical expansions of the acronym EMACS. These include &quot;Escape Meta Alt Control Shift&quot; (a jab at Emacs&#x27;s reliance on modifier keys), &quot;Eight Megabytes And Constantly Swapping&quot; (in a time when that was a great amount of memory), &quot;EMACS Makes Any Computer Slow&quot; (a recursive acronym like those Stallman uses), or &quot;Eventually Munches All Computer Storage&quot; in reference to Emacs&#x27;s high system resource requirements. GNU EMACS has been expanded to &quot;Generally Not Used, Except by Middle-Aged Computer Scientists&quot; referencing its most ardent fans and its declining usage among younger programmers in comparison to more graphically oriented editors such as Atom, BBEdit, Sublime Text, TextMate, Notepad++, and Visual Studio Code.

As a poke at Emacs&#x27; creeping featurism, vi advocates have been known to describe Emacs as &quot;a great operating system, lacking only a decent editor&quot;. Emacs advocates have been known to respond that the editor is actually very good, but the operating system could use improvement (referring to Emacs&#x27; famous lack of concurrency, which has now been added).

A game among UNIX users, either to test the depth of an Emacs user&#x27;s understanding of the editor or to poke fun at the complexity of Emacs, involved predicting what would happen if a user held down a modifier key (such as or ) and typed their own name. This game humor originated with users of the older TECO editor, which was the implementation basis, via macros, of the original Emacs.

The Google search engine also joined in on the joke by having searches for vi resulting in the question &quot;Did you mean: emacs&quot; prompted at the top of the page, and searches for emacs resulting in &quot;Did you mean: vi&quot;.

In the web series &quot;A Murder at the End of the World&quot;, there is a scene referencing the editor wars where a character asks a woman if she uses Vi or Emacs.

<doc id="10270" wikidata="Q25084820" url="?curid=10270" title="Organization of the Eastern Orthodox Church">
<text>The [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], officially the Orthodox Catholic Church and commonly known simply as the Orthodox Church is a communion composed of up to seventeen separate autocephalous (self-governing) hierarchical churches that profess Eastern Orthodoxy and recognise each other as canonical (regular) Eastern Orthodox Christian churches.

Each constituent church is self-governing; its highest-ranking bishop called the primate (a patriarch, a metropolitan or an archbishop) reports to no higher authority. Each regional church is composed of constituent eparchies (or dioceses) ruled by bishops. Some autocephalous churches have given an eparchy or group of eparchies with varying degrees of autonomy (meaning they have limited self-government). Such autonomous churches maintain varying levels of dependence on their mother church, usually defined in a &quot;tomos&quot; or another document of autonomy. In many cases, autonomous churches are almost completely self-governing, with the mother church retaining only the right to appoint the highest-ranking bishop (often an archbishop or metropolitan) of the autonomous church.

Normal governance is enacted through a synod of bishops within each church.

==Church governance==
The Eastern Orthodox Church is decentralised, having no central authority, earthly head or a single bishop in a leadership role. Thus, the Eastern Orthodox use a synodical system canonically, which is significantly different from the hierarchical organisation of the Catholic Church that follows the doctrine of papal supremacy. References to the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople as a sole authoritative leader are an erroneous interpretation of his title “first among equals&quot;. His title is of honor rather than authority and in fact the Ecumenical Patriarch has no direct authority over churches other than the Constantinopolitan Church. The Ecumenical Patriarch&#x27;s unique role is sometimes referred to as being the &quot;spiritual leader&quot; of the Eastern Orthodox Church, although even this is disputed.

The autocephalous churches are normally in full communion with each other, so any priest of any of those churches may lawfully minister to any member of any of them, and no member of any is excluded from any form of worship in any of the others, including the reception of the Eucharist. However, there have been varying instances in the history of the Eastern Orthodox Church where communion has been broken between member churches for short periods, particularly over autocephaly issues or disagreements over ecumenism with other Christian denominations.

Following Justinian, the church existed only as a single denomination of five communing churches ruled by five patriarchs: the bishops of Rome, Constantinople, Alexandria, Antioch, and Jerusalem, collectively referred to as the Pentarchy. Each of the five patriarchs had jurisdiction over bishops in a specified geographic region which did not overlap with the jurisdiction of another patriarch. This continued until 927, when the Bulgarian Patriarchate became the first newly promoted patriarchate to join the original five.

Historically, the Patriarch of Rome was considered to be the &quot;first in place of honor&quot; among the five patriarchs. Disagreement about the limits of his authority was one of the causes of the Great Schism, conventionally dated to the year 1054, which split the previously unified Church into the Roman Catholic Church in the West, headed by the Pope, and the Orthodox Catholic Church (more commonly known today as the Eastern Orthodox Church), led by the four eastern patriarchs. After the schism, the honorary primacy of the Bishop of Rome shifted to the Patriarch of Constantinople, who had previously been accorded second-place rank at the First Council of Constantinople.

In the 5th century, Oriental Orthodoxy separated from Chalcedonian Christianity (and is therefore separate from both the Eastern Orthodox Church and Roman Catholic Church), well before the 11th century Great Schism. It should not be confused with Eastern Orthodoxy or Roman Catholicism.

Ranked in order of seniority, with the year of independence (autocephaly) given in parentheses, where applicable. There are a total of 17 autocephalous Eastern Orthodox churches which are recognized to various degrees among the communion of the Eastern Orthodox Church.

&quot;Canonicity&quot; refers to the state of being in communion with the larger Eastern Orthodox Church (making the church in question undisputedly a constituent of the Eastern Orthodox Church), whereas &quot;autocephaly&quot; refers to the state of being more or less self-governing. Canonicity is binary (two churches are either in communion or not) while autocephaly exists on a spectrum. Disputes over autocephaly often lead to short-term breaks in communion for political reasons. These short-term breaks are typically not due to differences in doctrine or theology.

====Four ancient patriarchates====
# Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople (independence in AD 330; elevated to the rank of autocephalous Patriarchate in 381; elevated 451 to second see; became first see due to division from the See of Rome in the Great Schism of 1054)
# Greek Orthodox Patriarchate of Alexandria
# Greek Orthodox Patriarchate of Antioch
# Greek Orthodox Patriarchate of Jerusalem (independence in AD 451, elevated to the rank of autocephalous Patriarchate in 451)

The four ancient Eastern Orthodox Patriarchates, along with the See of Rome, formed the historical Pentarchy, and remained in communion with each other after the East-West Schism in 1054. The concept of the Pentarchy and the title of &quot;Patriarch&quot; itself, as opposed to Archbishop or Exarch, is attributed to St Justinian in AD 531.

====National patriarchates====
# Bulgarian Orthodox Church (870, Patriarchate since 918/919, recognised by the Patriarchate of Constantinople in 927)
# Georgian Orthodox Church (Patriarchate since 1010)
# Serbian Orthodox Church (1219, Patriarchate since 1346, recognised in 1375)
# Russian Orthodox Church (1448, recognised in 1589)
# Romanian Orthodox Church (1872, recognised in 1885, Patriarchate since 1925)

==== Autocephalous archbishoprics ====
Note:
# Church of Cyprus (recognised in 431)
# Church of Greece (1833, recognised in 1850)
# Albanian Orthodox Church (1922, recognised in 1937)

==== Autocephalous metropolises ====
Note:
# Polish Orthodox Church (1924)
# Orthodox Church of the Czech Lands and Slovakia (1951)

=== Universally recognized as canonical, autocephaly disputed ===
# Orthodox Church in America (granted by the Russian Orthodox Church in 1970 and recognized by five other churches, but not recognised by the Ecumenical Patriarchate or remaining Churches. Canonicity universally recognized.)
# Macedonian Orthodox Church (1967, granted by the Serbian Orthodox Church in 2022 and recognized by seven other churches, but not recognised by the Ecumenical Patriarchate or remaining Churches. Canonicity universally recognized.)

=== Canonical and spiritual independence status disputed ===
# Ukrainian Orthodox Church (Moscow Patriarchate) (1992 as Ukrainian Orthodox Church, split from Ukrainian Orthodox Church in 1992 allying with Russian Orthodox Church, declared independence from the Russian Orthodox Church on 27 May 2022, recognised as independent by the Georgian Orthodox Church on 24 March 2023. Its status as an independent church rejected by the majority of churches)
# Estonian Orthodox Church (removed mentions of the Moscow Patriarchate on 20 August 2024, a request to rename the church was denied by court nor did any other church recognize its independence)

=== Canonical and autocephalous status disputed ===
# Orthodox Church of Ukraine (1992 as Ukrainian Orthodox Church, autocephaly from 15 December 2018, recognised by the Ecumenical Patriarchate on 5 January 2019 and three other churches. Its autocephaly and canonicity rejected by remaining churches, including its rival Ukrainian churches.)

=== Canonical and autocephalous status unrecognised ===
# A minority of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church – Kyiv Patriarchate led by Filaret (Denysenko) split again in 2019, following internal disputes and concerns as to whether the autocephaly granted by the Ecumenical Patriarchate amounted to true autocephaly due to the conditions imposed. They are not recognized by any church, including rival Ukrainian churches.
# The Old Calendarists and True Orthodox split from their local church and are not recognized as canonical, nor do they recognize any of the above churches as canonical. Some maintain communion with the Kyiv Patriarchate under Filaret.

===Internal ranking===
The typical order that the four ancient churches appear in the diptychs is the same order given above. While every major church places the four ancient churches in their diptychs before the other autocephalous churches, this order may still differ slightly. For example, in the diptychs of the Russian Orthodox Church and some of its daughter churches (e.g., the Orthodox Church in America), the ranking of the five junior patriarchates is: Russia, Georgia, Serbia, Romania, Bulgaria. The ranking of the archbishoprics is the same, with the Church of Cyprus being the only ancient one (AD 431).

== Unrecognised churches ==

The following churches recognize all other mainstream Eastern Orthodox churches, but are not recognised by any of them due to various disputes:
* Abkhazian Orthodox Church
* American Orthodox Catholic Church
* Belarusian Autocephalous Orthodox Church
* Latvian Orthodox Church
* Montenegrin Orthodox Church
* Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church Canonical
* Ukrainian Orthodox Church – Kyiv Patriarchate
* Turkish Orthodox Church

===True Orthodox===
True Orthodox Christians are groups of traditionalist Eastern Orthodox churches which have severed communion since the 1920s with the mainstream Eastern Orthodox churches for various reasons, such as calendar reform, the involvement of mainstream Eastern Orthodox in ecumenism, or the refusal to submit to the authority of mainstream Eastern Orthodox Church. The True Orthodox Church in the Soviet Union was also called the Catacomb Church; the True Orthodox in Romania, Bulgaria, Greece and Cyprus are also called Old Calendarists.

These groups refrain from concelebration of the Divine Liturgy with the mainstream Eastern Orthodox, while maintaining that they remain fully within the canonical boundaries of the Church: i.e., professing Eastern Orthodox belief, retaining legitimate apostolic succession, and existing in communities with historical continuity. However, their existence outside of communion with the other churches makes the True Orthodox automatically outside of the Eastern Orthodox Church.

The churches which follow True Orthodoxy are:
* Old Calendarists (numerous groups)
* Serbian True Orthodox Church
* Russian True Orthodox Church (Lazar Zhurbenko)
* Russian Orthodox Autonomous Church
* True Orthodox Metropolis of Germany and Europe

=== Old Believers ===

Old Believers are divided into various churches which recognize neither each other nor the mainstream Eastern Orthodox Church.

===Churches that are neither recognised nor fully Eastern Orthodox===

The following churches use the term &quot;Orthodox&quot; in their name and carry belief or the traditions of Eastern Orthodox church, but blend beliefs and traditions from other denominations outside of Eastern Orthodoxy:
* Evangelical Orthodox Church (blends with Protestant Evangelicalism and the Charismatic movement)
* Orthodox-Catholic Church of America (blends with Roman Catholic and Oriental Orthodox elements)
* Nordic Catholic Church in Italy (originally called the Orthodox Church in Italy, it had ties with the UOC-KP; now associates with the Nordic Catholic Church and the Union of Scranton)
* Lusitanian Catholic Orthodox Church (blends with Catholic elements)
** Celtic Orthodox Church
** Orthodox Church of the Gauls

<doc id="10272" wikidata="Q78987" url="?curid=10272" title="Electric guitar">
<text>An electric guitar is a guitar that requires external electric sound amplification in order to be heard at typical performance volumes, unlike a standard acoustic guitar. It uses one or more pickups to convert the vibration of its strings into electrical signals, which ultimately are reproduced as sound by loudspeakers. The sound is sometimes shaped or electronically altered to achieve different timbres or tonal qualities via amplifier settings or knobs on the guitar. Often, this is done through the use of effects such as reverb, distortion and &quot;overdrive&quot;; the latter is considered to be a key element of electric blues guitar music and jazz, rock and heavy metal guitar playing. Designs also exist combining attributes of electric and acoustic guitars: the semi-acoustic and acoustic-electric guitars.

Invented in 1932, the electric guitar was adopted by jazz guitar players, who wanted to play single-note guitar solos in large big band ensembles. Early proponents of the electric guitar on record include Les Paul, Eddie Durham, George Barnes, Lonnie Johnson, Sister Rosetta Tharpe, T-Bone Walker, and Charlie Christian. During the 1950s and 1960s, the electric guitar became the most important instrument in popular music. It has evolved into an instrument that is capable of a multitude of sounds and styles in genres ranging from pop and rock to folk to country music, blues and jazz. It served as a major component in the development of electric blues, rock and roll, rock music, heavy metal music and many other genres of music.

Electric guitar design and construction varies greatly in the shape of the body and the configuration of the neck, bridge, and pickups. Guitars may have a fixed bridge or a spring-loaded hinged bridge, which lets players &quot;bend&quot; the pitch of notes or chords up or down, or perform vibrato effects. The sound of an electric guitar can be modified by new playing techniques such as string bending, tapping, and hammering-on, using audio feedback, or slide guitar playing.

There are several types of electric guitar. Early forms were hollow-body semi-acoustic guitars, while solid body guitars developed later. String configurations include the six-string guitar (the most common type), which is usually tuned E, A, D, G, B, E, from lowest to highest strings; the seven-string guitar, which typically adds a low B string below the low E; the eight-string guitar, which typically adds a low E or F# string below the low B; and the twelve-string guitar, which has six two-string courses similar to a mandolin.

In rock, the electric guitar is often used in two roles: as a rhythm guitar, which plays the chord sequences or progressions, and riffs, and sets the beat (as part of a rhythm section); and as a lead guitar, which provides instrumental melody lines, melodic instrumental fill passages, and solos. In a small group, such as a power trio, one guitarist may switch between both roles; in larger groups there is often a rhythm guitarist and a lead guitarist.
== History ==

Many experiments with electrically amplifying the vibrations of a string instrument were made dating back to the early part of the 20th century. Patents from the 1910s show telephone transmitters were adapted and placed inside violins and banjos to amplify the sound. Hobbyists in the 1920s used carbon button microphones attached to the bridge; however, these detected vibrations from the bridge on top of the instrument, resulting in a weak signal.

Electric guitars were originally designed by acoustic guitar makers and instrument manufacturers. The demand for amplified guitars began during the big band era; as orchestras increased in size, guitar players soon realized the necessity in guitar amplification and electrification. The first electric guitars used in jazz were hollow archtop acoustic guitar bodies with electromagnetic transducers.

The first electrically amplified stringed instrument to be marketed commercially was a cast aluminium lap steel guitar nicknamed the &quot;Frying Pan&quot; designed in 1931 by George Beauchamp, the general manager of the National Stringed Instrument Corporation, with Paul Barth, who was vice president. George Beauchamp, along with Adolph Rickenbacker, invented the electromagnetic pickups. Coils that were wrapped around a magnet would create an electromagnetic field that converted the vibrations of the guitar strings into electrical signals, which could then be amplified. Commercial production began in late summer of 1932 by the Ro-Pat-In Corporation (Electro-Patent-Instrument Company), in Los Angeles, a partnership of Beauchamp, Adolph Rickenbacker (originally Rickenbacher), and Paul Barth.

In 1934, the company was renamed the Rickenbacker Electro Stringed Instrument Company. In that year Beauchamp applied for a United States patent for an &quot;Electrical Stringed Musical Instrument&quot; and the patent was later issued in 1937. By the time it was patented, other manufacturers were already making their own electric guitar designs. Early electric guitar manufacturers include Rickenbacker in 1932; Dobro in 1933; National, AudioVox and Volu-tone in 1934; Vega, Epiphone (Electrophone and Electar), and Gibson in 1935 and many others by 1936.
By early-mid 1935, Electro String Instrument Corporation had achieved success with the &quot;Frying Pan&quot;, and set out to capture a new audience through its release of the Electro-Spanish Model B and the Electro-Spanish Ken Roberts, which was the first full 25-inch scale electric guitar ever produced. The Electro-Spanish Ken Roberts was revolutionary for its time, providing players a full 25-inch scale, with easy access to 17 frets free of the body. Unlike other lap-steel electrified instruments produced during the time, the Electro-Spanish Ken Roberts was designed to play while standing upright with the guitar on a strap, as with acoustic guitars. The Electro-Spanish Ken Roberts was also the first instrument to feature a hand-operated vibrato as a standard arrangement, a device called the &quot;Vibrola&quot;, invented by Doc Kauffman.
 It is estimated that fewer than 50 Electro-Spanish Ken Roberts were constructed between 1933 and 1937; fewer than 10 are known to survive today.

The solid-body electric guitar is made of solid wood, without functionally resonating air spaces. The first solid-body Spanish standard guitar was offered by Vivi-Tone no later than 1934. This model featured a guitar-shaped body of a single sheet of plywood affixed to a wood frame. Another early, substantially solid Spanish electric guitar, called the Electro Spanish, was marketed by the Rickenbacker guitar company in 1935 and made of Bakelite. By 1936, the Slingerland company introduced a wooden solid-body electric model, the Slingerland Songster 401 (and a lap steel counterpart, the Songster 400).

Gibson&#x27;s first production electric guitar, marketed in 1936, was the ES-150 model (&quot;ES&quot; for &quot;Electric Spanish&quot;, and &quot;150&quot; reflecting the $150 price of the instrument, along with matching amplifier). The ES-150 guitar featured a single-coil, hexagonally shaped &quot;bar&quot; pickup, which was designed by Walt Fuller. It became known as the &quot;Charlie Christian&quot; pickup (named for the jazz guitarist who was among the first to perform with the ES-150 guitar). The ES-150 achieved some popularity but suffered from unequal loudness across the six strings.

A functioning solid-body electric guitar was designed and built in 1940 by Les Paul from an Epiphone acoustic archtop as an experiment. His &quot;log guitar&quot; — a wood post with a neck attached and two hollow-body halves attached to the sides for appearance only — shares nothing in common for design or hardware with the solid-body Gibson Les Paul, designed by Ted McCarty and introduced in 1952.

The feedback associated with amplified hollow-bodied electric guitars was understood long before Paul&#x27;s &quot;log&quot; was created in 1940; Gage Brewer&#x27;s Ro-Pat-In of 1932 had a top so heavily reinforced that it essentially functioned as a solid-body instrument.

==Types==
===Solid-body===

Unlike acoustic guitars, solid-body electric guitars have no vibrating soundboard to amplify string vibration. Instead, solid-body instruments depend on electric pickups, and an amplifier (&quot;amp&quot;) and speaker. The solid body ensures that the amplified sound reproduces the string vibration alone, thus avoiding the wolf tones and unwanted feedback associated with amplified acoustic guitars. These guitars are generally made of hardwood covered with a hard polymer finish, often polyester or lacquer. In large production facilities, the wood is stored for three to six months in a wood-drying kiln before being cut to shape. Premium custom-built guitars are frequently made with much older, hand-selected wood.

One of the first solid-body guitars was invented by Les Paul. Gibson did not present their Gibson Les Paul guitar prototypes to the public, as they did not believe the solid-body style would catch on. Another early solid-body Spanish style guitar, resembling what would become Gibson&#x27;s Les Paul guitar a decade later, was developed in 1941 by O.W. Appleton, of Nogales, Arizona. Appleton made contact with both Gibson and Fender but was unable to sell the idea behind his &quot;App&quot; guitar to either company. In 1946, Merle Travis commissioned steel guitar builder Paul Bigsby to build him a solid-body Spanish-style electric. Bigsby delivered the guitar in 1948. The first mass-produced solid-body guitar was Fender Esquire and Fender Broadcaster (later to become the Fender Telecaster), first made in 1950, five years after Les Paul made his prototype. The Gibson Les Paul appeared soon after to compete with the Broadcaster. Another notable solid-body design is the Fender Stratocaster, which was introduced in 1954 and became extremely popular among musicians in the 1960s and 1970s for its wide tonal capabilities and more comfortable ergonomics than other models. Different styles of guitar have different pick-up styles, the main being 2 or 3 &quot;single-coil&quot; pick-ups or a double humbucker, with the Stratocaster being a triple single-coil guitar.

The history of electric guitars has been summarized by &quot;Guitar World&quot; magazine, and the earliest electric guitar on their top 10 list is the Ro-Pat-In Electro A-25 &quot;Frying Pan&quot; (1932) described as &quot;The first-fully functioning solid-body electric guitar to be manufactured and sold&quot;. It was the first electric guitar used in a publicly promoted performance, performed by Gage Brewer in Wichita, Kansas in October 1932. The most recent electric guitar on this list was the Ibanez Jem (1987) which featured &quot;24 frets&quot;, an impossibly thin neck&quot; and was &quot;designed to be the ultimate shredder machine&quot;. Numerous other important electric guitars are on the list, including Gibson ES-150 (1936), Fender Telecaster (1951), Gibson Les Paul (1952), Gretsch 6128 Duo Jet (1953), Fender Stratocaster (1954), Rickenbacker 360/12 (1964), Van Halen Frankenstrat (1975), Paul Reed Smith Custom (1985) many of these guitars were &quot;successors&quot; to earlier designs. Electric guitar designs eventually became culturally important and visually iconic, with various model companies selling miniature model versions of particularly famous electric guitars, for example, the Gibson SG used by Angus Young from the group AC/DC.

=== Chambered-body ===
Some otherwise solid-bodied guitars, such as the Gibson Les Paul Supreme, the PRS Singlecut, and the Fender Telecaster Thinline, are built with hollow chambers in the body. These chambers are designed to not interfere with the critical bridge and string anchor point on the solid body. In the case of Gibson and PRS, these are called &quot;chambered bodies&quot;. The motivation for this may be to reduce weight, to achieve a semi-acoustic tone (see below) or both.

===Semi-acoustic ===
Semi-acoustic guitars have a hollow body similar to an acoustic guitar and electromagnetic pickups mounted directly into the body. They work in a similar way to solid-body electric guitars except that because the hollow body also vibrates, the pickups convert a combination of string and body vibration into an electrical signal. Many models, known as semi-hollow bodies, have a solid block running through the middle of the soundbox designed to reduce acoustic feedback. They do not provide enough acoustic volume for live performance, but they can be used unplugged for quiet practice. Semi-acoustic guitars are noted for being able to provide a sweet, plaintive, or funky tone. They are used in many genres, including jazz, blues, funk, sixties pop, and indie rock. They generally have cello-style F-shaped sound holes, which can be blocked off to further reduce feedback. Whereas chambered guitars are made, like solid-body guitars, from a single block of wood, semi-acoustic guitar bodies are made from multiple pieces of wood in an &quot;archtop&quot; form, a method of construction different from the typical steel string acoustic guitar. The top is formed from a moderately thick piece of wood which is then carved into a thin outward-curving shape, whereas conventional acoustic guitars have a thin, flat top.

=== Electric acoustic ===

Some steel-string acoustic guitars include a built-in system to electrically amplify their output without altering their tone as an alternative to using a separate microphone. The system may consist of piezoelectric pickups mounted under the bridge, or a low-mass microphone (usually a condenser mic) inside the body of the guitar that converts the vibrations in the body into electronic signals. Combinations of these types of pickups may be used, with an integral mixer/preamp/graphic equalizer. Such instruments are called electric acoustic guitars. They are regarded as acoustic guitars rather than electric guitars because the pickups do not produce a signal directly from the vibration of the strings, but rather from the vibration of the guitar top or body, and the amplification of the sound merely increases volume, not alters tone.

==Construction==

Electric guitar design and construction vary greatly in the shape of the body and the configuration of the neck, bridge, and pickups. However, some features are present on most guitars. The photo below shows the different parts of an electric guitar. The headstock (1) contains the metal machine heads (1.1), which use a worm gear for tuning. The nut (1.4)—a thin fret-like strip of metal, plastic, graphite, or bone—supports the strings at the headstock end of the instrument. The frets (2.3) are thin metal strips that stop the string at the correct pitch when the player pushes a string against the fingerboard. The truss rod (1.2) is a metal rod (usually adjustable) that counters the tension of the strings to keep the neck straight. Position markers (2.2) provide the player with a reference to the playing position on the fingerboard.

The neck and fretboard (2.1) extend from the body. At the neck joint (2.4), the neck is either glued or bolted to the body. The body (3) is typically made of wood with a hard, polymerized finish. Strings vibrating in the magnetic field of the pickups (3.1, 3.2) produce an electric current in the pickup winding that passes through the tone and volume controls (3.8) to the output jack. Some guitars have piezo pickups, in addition to or instead of magnetic pickups.

Some guitars have a fixed bridge (3.4). Others have a spring-loaded hinged bridge called a &quot;vibrato bar&quot;, &quot;tremolo bar&quot;, or &quot;whammy bar&quot;, which lets players bend notes or chords up or down in pitch or perform a vibrato embellishment. A plastic pickguard on some guitars protects the body from scratches or covers the control cavity, which holds most of the wiring.
The degree to which the choice of woods and other materials in the solid-guitar body (3) affects the sonic character of the amplified signal is disputed. Some believe it is highly significant, while others think the difference between woods is subtle. In acoustic and archtop guitars, wood choices more clearly affect tone.

Woods typically used in solid-body electric guitars include alder, swamp ash and mahogany. Cheaper guitars are often made of cheaper woods, such as plywood, pine, or agathis—not true hardwoods—which can affect durability and tone. Though most guitars are made of wood, any material may be used. Materials such as plastic, metal, and even cardboard have been used in some instruments.

The guitar output jack typically provides a monaural signal. Many guitars with active electronics use a jack with an extra contact normally used for stereo. These guitars use the extra contact to break the ground connection to the on-board battery to preserve battery life when the guitar is unplugged. These guitars require a mono plug to close the internal switch and connect the battery to ground. Standard guitar cables use a high-impedance mono plug. These have a tip and sleeve configuration referred to as a TS phone connector. The voltage is usually around 1 to 9 millivolts.

A few guitars, such as Rickenbacker guitars equipped with &quot;Rick-O-Sound&quot;, feature stereo output. There are a variety of ways the &quot;stereo&quot; effect may be implemented. Commonly, but not exclusively, stereo guitars route the neck and bridge pickups to separate output buses on the guitar. A stereo cable then routes each pickup to its signal chain or amplifier. For these applications, the most popular connector is a high-impedance plug with a tip, ring, and sleeve configuration, also known as a TRS phone connector. Some studio instruments, notably certain Gibson Les Paul models, incorporate a low-impedance three-pin XLR connector for balanced audio. Many exotic arrangements and connectors exist that support features such as midi and hexaphonic pickups.

=== Bridge and tailpiece systems ===
The bridge and tailpiece, while serving separate purposes, work closely together to affect playing style and tone. There are four basic types of bridge and tailpiece systems on electric guitars. Within these four types are many variants.

A hard-tail guitar bridge anchors the strings at or directly behind the bridge and is fastened securely to the top of the instrument. These are common on carved-top guitars, such as the Gibson Les Paul and the Paul Reed Smith models, and on slab-body guitars, such as the Music Man Albert Lee and Fender guitars that are not equipped with a vibrato arm.

A &quot;floating&quot; or &quot;trapeze&quot; tailpiece (similar to a violin&#x27;s) fastens to the body at the base of the guitar. These appear on Rickenbackers, Gretsches, Epiphones, a wide variety of archtop guitars, particularly jazz guitars, and the 1952 Gibson Les Paul.

Pictured is a &quot;tremolo arm&quot; or &quot;vibrato tailpiece-&quot;style bridge and tailpiece system, often called a &quot;whammy bar&quot; or &quot;trem&quot;. It uses a lever (&quot;vibrato arm&quot;) attached to the bridge that can temporarily slacken or tighten the strings to alter the pitch. A player can use this to create a vibrato or a portamento effect. Early vibrato systems were often unreliable and made the guitar go out of tune easily. They also had a limited pitch range. Later Fender designs were better, but Fender held the patent on these, so other companies used older designs for many years. 

With the expiration of the Fender patent on the Stratocaster-style vibrato, various improvements on this type of internal, multi-spring vibrato system are now available. Floyd Rose introduced one of the first improvements on the vibrato system in many years when, in the late 1970s, he experimented with &quot;locking&quot; nuts and bridges that prevent the guitar from losing tuning, even under heavy vibrato bar use.
The fourth type of system employs string-through body anchoring. The strings pass over the bridge saddles, then through holes through the top of the guitar body to the back. The strings are typically anchored in place at the back of the guitar by metal ferrules. Many believe this design improves a guitar&#x27;s sustain and timbre. A few examples of string-through body guitars are the Fender Telecaster Thinline, the Fender Telecaster Deluxe, the B.C. Rich IT Warlock and Mockingbird, and the Schecter Omen 6 and 7 series.

===Pickups===

Compared to an acoustic guitar, which has a hollow body, electric guitars make much less audible sound when their strings are plucked, so electric guitars are normally plugged into a guitar amplifier and speaker. When an electric guitar is played, string movement produces a signal by generating (i.e., inducing) a small electric current in the magnetic pickups, which are magnets wound with coils of very fine wire.
The signal passes through the tone and volume circuits to the output jack, and through a cable to an amplifier. The current induced is proportional to such factors as string density and the amount of movement over the pickups.

Because of their natural qualities, magnetic pickups tend to pick up ambient, usually unwanted electromagnetic interference or EMI. This mains hum results in a tone of 50 or 60 cycles per second depending on the powerline frequency of the local alternating current supply.

The resulting hum is particularly strong with single-coil pickups. Double-coil or &quot;humbucker&quot; pickups were invented as a way to reduce or counter the sound, as they are designed to &quot;buck&quot; (in the verb sense of &quot;oppose&quot; or &quot;resist&quot;) the hum, hence their name. The high combined inductance of the two coils also leads to the richer, &quot;fatter&quot; tone associated with humbucking pickups.

===Necks===
Electric guitar necks vary in composition and shape. The primary metric of guitar necks is the &quot;scale length&quot;, which is the vibrating length of the strings from nut to bridge. A typical Fender guitar uses a scale length, while Gibson uses a scale length in their &quot;Les Paul&quot;. While the scale length of the Les Paul is often described as 24.75 inches, it has varied through the years by as much as a half inch.

Frets are positioned proportionally to scale length—the shorter the scale length, the closer the fret spacing. Opinions vary regarding the effect of scale length on tone and feel. Popular opinion holds that longer scale length contributes to greater amplitude. Reports of playing feel are greatly complicated by the many factors involved in this perception. String gauge and design, neck construction and relief, guitar setup, playing style, and other factors contribute to the subjective impression of playability or feel.

Necks are described as &quot;bolt-on&quot;, &quot;set-in&quot;, or &quot;neck-through&quot;, depending on how they attach to the body. Set-in necks are glued to the body at the factory. This is the traditional type of joint. Leo Fender pioneered bolt-on necks on electric guitars to facilitate easy adjustment and replacement. Neck-through instruments extend the neck to the length of the instrument so that it forms the center of the body. While a set-in neck can be carefully unglued by a skilled luthier, and a bolt-on neck can simply be unscrewed, a neck-through design is difficult or even impossible to repair, depending on the damage. Historically, the bolt-on style has been more popular for ease of installation and adjustment. Since bolt-on necks can be easily removed, there is an after-market in replacement bolt-on necks from companies such as Warmoth and Mighty Mite. Some instruments—notably most Gibson models—continue to use set-in glued necks. Neck-through bodies are somewhat more common in bass guitars.

Materials for necks are selected for dimensional stability and rigidity, and some allege that they influence tone. Hardwoods are preferred, with maple, mahogany, and ash topping the list. The neck and fingerboard can be made from different materials; for example, a guitar may have a maple neck with a rosewood or ebony fingerboard. Today there are expensive and budget guitars exploring other options for fretboard wood for instance &quot;Pau-Ferro&quot;, both for availability and cheap price while still maintaining quality. In the 1970s, designers began to use exotic human-made materials such as aircraft-grade aluminum, carbon fiber, and ebonol. Makers known for these unusual materials include John Veleno, Travis Bean, Geoff Gould, and Alembic.

Aside from possible engineering advantages, some feel that with the rising cost of rare tonewoods, human-made materials may be economically preferable and more ecologically sensitive. However, wood remains popular in production instruments, though sometimes in conjunction with new materials. Vigier guitars, for example, use a wooden neck reinforced by embedding a light, carbon fiber rod in place of the usual heavier steel bar or adjustable steel truss rod. After-market necks made entirely from carbon fiber fit existing bolt-on instruments. Few, if any, extensive formal investigations have been widely published that confirm or refute claims over the effects of different woods or materials on the electric guitar sound.

Several neck shapes appear on guitars, including shapes known as C necks, U necks, and V necks. These refer to the cross-sectional shape of the neck (especially near the nut). Several sizes of fret wire are available, with traditional players often preferring thin frets, and metal shredders liking thick frets. Thin frets are considered better for playing chords, while thick frets allow lead guitarists to bend notes with less effort.

An electric guitar with a folding neck called the &quot;Foldaxe&quot; was designed and built for Chet Atkins by Roger C. Field. Steinberger guitars developed a line of exotic, carbon fiber instruments without headstocks, with tuning done on the bridge instead.

Fingerboards vary as much as necks. The fingerboard surface usually has a cross-sectional radius that is optimized to accommodate finger movement for different playing techniques. Fingerboard radius typically ranges from nearly flat (a very large radius) to radically arched (a small radius). The vintage Fender Telecaster, for example, has a typical small radius of approximately . Some manufacturers have experimented with fret profile and material, fret layout, number of frets, and modifications of the fingerboard surface for various reasons. Some innovations were intended to improve playability by ergonomic means, such as Warmoth Guitars&#x27; compound radius fingerboard. Scalloped fingerboards added enhanced microtonality during fast legato runs. Fanned frets intend to provide each string with an optimal playing tension and enhanced musicality. Some guitars have no frets, while others, like the Gittler guitar, have no neck in the traditional sense.

<doc id="10273" wikidata="Q1335214" url="?curid=10273" title="Embryo drawing">
<text>Embryo drawing is the illustration of embryos in their developmental sequence. In plants and animals, an embryo develops from a zygote, the single cell that results when an egg and sperm fuse during fertilization. In animals, the zygote divides repeatedly to form a ball of cells, which then forms a set of tissue layers that migrate and fold to form an early embryo. Images of embryos provide a means of comparing embryos of different ages, and species. To this day, embryo drawings are made in undergraduate developmental biology lessons.

Comparing different embryonic stages of different animals is a tool that can be used to infer relationships between species, and thus biological evolution. This has been a source of quite some controversy, both now and in the past. Ernst Haeckel at the University of Basel pioneered in this field. By comparing different embryonic stages of different vertebrate species, he formulated the recapitulation theory. This theory states that an animal&#x27;s embryonic development follows exactly the same sequence as the sequence of its evolutionary ancestors. Haeckel&#x27;s work and the ensuing controversy linked the fields of developmental biology and comparative anatomy into comparative embryology. From a more modern perspective, Haeckel&#x27;s drawings were the beginnings of the field of evolutionary developmental biology (evo-devo).

The study of comparative embryology aims to prove or disprove that vertebrate embryos of different classes (e.g. mammals vs. fish) follow a similar developmental path due to their common ancestry. Such developing vertebrates have similar genes, which determine the basic body plan. However, further development allows for the distinguishing of distinct characteristics as adults.

==Famous embryo illustrators==
===Ernst Haeckel (1834–1919)===
Haeckel&#x27;s illustrations show vertebrate embryos at different stages of development, which exhibit embryonic resemblance as support for evolution, recapitulation as evidence of the Biogenetic Law, and phenotypic divergence as evidence of von Baer&#x27;s laws. The series of twenty-four embryos from the early editions of Haeckel&#x27;s &quot;Anthropogenie&quot; remain the most famous. The different species are arranged in columns, and the different stages in rows. Similarities can be seen along the first two rows; the appearance of specialized characters in each species can be seen in the columns and a diagonal interpretation leads one to Haeckel&#x27;s idea of recapitulation.

Haeckel&#x27;s embryo drawings are primarily intended to express his theory of embryonic development, the Biogenetic Law, which in turn assumes (but is not crucial to) the evolutionary concept of common descent. His postulation of embryonic development coincides with his understanding of evolution as a developmental process. In and around 1800, embryology fused with comparative anatomy as the primary foundation of morphology. Ernst Haeckel, along with Karl von Baer and Wilhelm His, are primarily influential in forming the preliminary foundations of &#x27;phylogenetic embryology&#x27; based on principles of evolution. Haeckel&#x27;s &#x27;Biogenetic Law&#x27; portrays the parallel relationship between an embryo&#x27;s development and phylogenetic history. The term, &#x27;recapitulation,&#x27; has come to embody Haeckel&#x27;s Biogenetic Law, for embryonic development is a recapitulation of evolution. Haeckel proposes that all classes of vertebrates pass through an evolutionarily conserved &quot;phylotypic&quot; stage of development, a period of reduced phenotypic diversity among higher embryos. Only in later development do particular differences appear. Haeckel portrays a concrete demonstration of his Biogenetic Law through his &quot;Gastrea&quot; theory, in which he argues that the early cup-shaped gastrula stage of development is a universal feature of multi-celled animals. An ancestral form existed, known as the gastrea, which was a common ancestor to the corresponding gastrula.

Haeckel argues that certain features in embryonic development are conserved and palingenetic, while others are caenogenetic. Caenogenesis represents &quot;the blurring of ancestral resemblances in development&quot;, which are said to be the result of certain adaptations to embryonic life due to environmental changes. In his drawings, Haeckel cites the notochord, pharyngeal arches and clefts, pronephros and neural tube as palingenetic features. However, the yolk sac, extra-embryonic membranes, egg membranes and endocardial tube are considered caenogenetic features. The addition of terminal adult stages and the telescoping, or driving back, of such stages to descendant&#x27;s embryonic stages are likewise representative of Haeckelian embryonic development. In addressing his embryo drawings to a general audience, Haeckel does not cite any sources, which gives his opponents the freedom to make assumptions regarding the originality of his work.

===Karl Ernst von Baer (1792–1876)===
Haeckel was not the only one to create a series of drawings representing embryonic development. Karl E. von Baer and Haeckel both struggled to model one of the most complex problems facing embryologists at the time: the arrangement of general and special characters during development in different species of animals. In relation to developmental timing, von Baer&#x27;s scheme of development differs from Haeckel&#x27;s scheme. Von Baer&#x27;s scheme of development need not be tied to developmental stages defined by particular characters, where recapitulation involves heterochrony. Heterochrony represents a gradual alteration in the original phylogenetic sequence due to embryonic adaptation.
As well, von Baer early noted that embryos of different species could not be easily distinguished from one another as in adults.

Von Baer&#x27;s laws governing embryonic development are specific rejections of recapitulation. As a response to Haeckel&#x27;s theory of recapitulation, von Baer enunciates his most notorious laws of development. Von Baer&#x27;s laws state that general features of animals appear earlier in the embryo than special features, where less general features stem from the most general, each embryo of a species departs more and more from a predetermined passage through the stages of other animals, and there is never a complete morphological similarity between an embryo and a lower adult. Von Baer&#x27;s embryo drawings display that individual development proceeds from general features of the developing embryo in early stages through differentiation into special features specific to the species, establishing that linear evolution could not occur. Embryological development, in von Baer&#x27;s mind, is a process of differentiation, &quot;a movement from the more and universal to the more heterogeneous and individual.&quot;

Von Baer argues that embryos will resemble each other before attaining characteristics differentiating them as part of a specific family, genus or species, but embryos are not the same as the final forms of lower organisms.

===Wilhelm His (1831–1904)===
Wilhelm His was one of Haeckel&#x27;s most authoritative and primary opponents advocating physiological embryology. His &quot;Anatomie menschlicher Embryonen&quot; (Anatomy of human embryos) employs a series of his most important drawings chronicling developing embryos from the end of the second week through the end of the second month of pregnancy. In 1878, His begins to engage in serious study of the anatomy of human embryos for his drawings. During the 19th century, embryologists often obtained early human embryos from abortions and miscarriages, postmortems of pregnant women and collections in anatomical museums. In order to construct his series of drawings, His collected specimens which he manipulated into a form that he could operate with.

In His&#x27; &quot;Normentafel&quot;, he displays specific individual embryos rather than ideal types. His does not produce norms from aborted specimens, but rather visualizes the embryos in order to make them comparable and specifically subjects his embryo specimens to criticism and comparison with other cases. Ultimately, His&#x27; critical work in embryonic development comes with his production of a series of embryo drawings of increasing length and degree of development. His&#x27; depiction of embryological development strongly differs from Haeckel&#x27;s depiction, for His argues that the phylogenetic explanation of ontogenetic events is unnecessary. His argues that all ontogenetic events are the &quot;mechanical&quot; result of differential cell growth. His&#x27; embryology is not explained in terms of ancestral history.

The debate between Haeckel and His ultimately becomes fueled by the description of an embryo that Wilhelm Krause propels directly into the ongoing feud between Haeckel and His. Haeckel speculates that the allantois is formed in a similar way in both humans and other mammals. His, on the other hand, accuses Haeckel of altering and playing with the facts. Although Haeckel is proven right about the allantois, the utilization of Krause&#x27;s embryo as justification turns out to be problematic, for the embryo is that of a bird rather than a human. The underlying debate between Haeckel and His derives from differing viewpoints regarding the similarity or dissimilarity of vertebrate embryos. In response to Haeckel&#x27;s evolutionary claim that all vertebrates are essentially identical in the first month of embryonic life as proof of common descent, His responds by insisting that a more skilled observer would recognize even sooner that early embryos can be distinguished. His also counteracts Haeckel&#x27;s sequence of drawings in the &quot;Anthropogenie&quot; with what he refers to as &quot;exact&quot; drawings, highlighting specific differences. Ultimately, His goes so far as to accuse Haeckel of &quot;faking&quot; his embryo illustrations to make the vertebrate embryos appear more similar than in reality. His also accuses Haeckel of creating early human embryos that he conjured in his imagination rather than obtained through empirical observation. His completes his denunciation of Haeckel by pronouncing that Haeckel had &quot;&#x27;relinquished the right to count as an equal in the company of serious researchers.&#x27;&quot;

==Controversy==
The exactness of Ernst Haeckel&#x27;s drawings of embryos has caused much controversy among Intelligent Design proponents recently and Haeckel&#x27;s intellectual opponents in the past. Although the early embryos of different species exhibit similarities, Haeckel apparently exaggerated these similarities in support of his Recapitulation theory, sometimes known as the Biogenetic Law or &quot;Ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny&quot;. Furthermore, Haeckel even proposed theoretical life-forms to accommodate certain stages in embryogenesis. A recent review concluded that the &quot;biogenetic law is supported by several recent studies – if applied to single characters only&quot;.

Critics in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Karl von Baer and Wilhelm His, did not believe that living embryos reproduce the evolutionary process and produced embryo drawings of their own which emphasized the differences in early embryological development. Late 20th and early 21st century critic Stephen Jay Gould has objected to the continued use of Haeckel&#x27;s embryo drawings in textbooks.

On the other hand, Michael K. Richardson, Professor of Evolutionary Developmental Zoology, Leiden University, while recognizing that some criticisms of the drawings are legitimate (indeed, it was he and his co-workers who began the modern criticisms in 1998), has supported the drawings as teaching aids, and has said that &quot;on a fundamental level, Haeckel was correct.&quot;

==Opposition to Haeckel==
Haeckel encountered numerous oppositions to his artistic depictions of embryonic development during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Haeckel&#x27;s opponents believe that he de-emphasizes the differences between early embryonic stages in order to make the similarities between embryos of different species more pronounced.

===Early opponents: Ludwig Rutimeyer, Theodor Bischoff and Rudolf Virchow===
The first suggestion of fakery against Haeckel was made in late 1868 by Ludwig Rutimeyer in the &quot;Archiv für Anthropogenie&quot;. Rutimeyer was a professor of zoology and comparative anatomy at the University of Basel, who rejected natural selection as simply mechanistic and proposed an anti-materialist view of nature. Rutimeyer claimed that Haeckel &quot;had taken to kinds of liberty with established truth&quot;. Rutimeyer claimed that Haeckel presented the same image three consecutive times as the embryo of the dog, the chicken, and the turtle.

Theodor Bischoff (1807–1882), was a strong opponent of Darwinism. As a pioneer in mammalian embryology, he was one of Haeckel&#x27;s strongest critics. Although Bischoff&#x27;s 1840 surveys depict how similar the early embryos of man are to other vertebrates, he later demanded that such hasty generalization was inconsistent with his recent findings regarding the dissimilarity between hamster embryos and those of rabbits and dogs. Nevertheless, Bischoff&#x27;s main argument was in reference to Haeckel&#x27;s drawings of human embryos, for Haeckel is later accused of miscopying the dog embryo from him. Throughout Haeckel&#x27;s time, criticism of his embryo drawings was often due in part to his critics&#x27; belief in his representations of embryological development as &quot;crude schemata&quot;.

===Contemporary criticism of Haeckel: Michael Richardson and Stephen Jay Gould===
Michael Richardson and his colleagues in a July 1997 issue of &quot;Anatomy and Embryology&quot;, demonstrated that Haeckel falsified his drawings in order to exaggerate the similarity of the phylotypic stage.
In a March 2000 issue of &quot;Natural History&quot;, Stephen Jay Gould argued that Haeckel &quot;exaggerated the similarities by idealizations and omissions.&quot; As well, Gould argued that Haeckel&#x27;s drawings are simply inaccurate and falsified. On the other hand, one of those who criticized Haeckel&#x27;s drawings, Michael Richardson, has argued that &quot;Haeckel&#x27;s much-criticized drawings are important as phylogenetic hypotheses, teaching aids, and evidence for evolution&quot;.
But even Richardson admitted in &quot;Science&quot; Magazine in 1997 that his team&#x27;s investigation of Haeckel&#x27;s drawings were showing them to be &quot;one of the most famous fakes in biology.&quot;

Some version of Haeckel&#x27;s drawings can be found in many modern biology textbooks in discussions of the history of embryology, with clarification that these are no longer considered valid.

==Haeckel&#x27;s proponents (past and present)==
Although Charles Darwin accepted Haeckel&#x27;s support for natural selection, he was tentative in using Haeckel&#x27;s ideas in his writings; with regard to embryology, Darwin relied far more on von Baer&#x27;s work. Haeckel&#x27;s work was published in 1866 and 1874, years after Darwin&#x27;s &quot;The Origin of Species&quot; (1859).

Despite the numerous oppositions, Haeckel has influenced many disciplines in science in his drive to integrate such disciplines of taxonomy and embryology into the Darwinian framework and to investigate phylogenetic reconstruction through his Biogenetic Law. As well, Haeckel served as a mentor to many important scientists, including Anton Dohrn, Richard and Oscar Hertwig, Wilhelm Roux, and Hans Driesch.

One of Haeckel&#x27;s earliest proponents was Carl Gegenbaur at the University of Jena (1865–1873), during which both men were absorbing the impact of Darwin&#x27;s theory. The two quickly sought to integrate their knowledge into an evolutionary program. In determining the relationships between &quot;phylogenetic linkages&quot; and &quot;evolutionary laws of form,&quot; both Gegenbaur and Haeckel relied on a method of comparison. As Gegenbaur argued, the task of comparative anatomy lies in explaining the form and organization of the animal body in order to provide evidence for the continuity and evolution of a series of organs in the body. Haeckel then provided a means of pursuing this aim with his biogenetic law, in which he proposed to compare an individual&#x27;s various stages of development with its ancestral line. Although Haeckel stressed comparative embryology and Gegenbaur promoted the comparison of adult structures, both believed that the two methods could work in conjunction to produce the goal of evolutionary morphology.

The philologist and anthropologist, Friedrich Müller, used Haeckel&#x27;s concepts as a source for his ethnological research, involving the systematic comparison of the folklore, beliefs and practices of different societies. Müller&#x27;s work relies specifically on theoretical assumptions that are very similar to Haeckel&#x27;s and reflects the German practice to maintain strong connections between empirical research and the philosophical framework of science. Language is particularly important, for it establishes a bridge between natural science and philosophy. For Haeckel, language specifically represented the concept that all phenomena of human development relate to the laws of biology. Although Müller did not specifically have an influence in advocating Haeckel&#x27;s embryo drawings, both shared a common understanding of development from lower to higher forms, for Müller specifically saw humans as the last link in an endless chain of evolutionary development.

Modern acceptance of Haeckel&#x27;s Biogenetic Law, despite current rejection of Haeckelian views, finds support in the certain degree of parallelism between ontogeny and phylogeny. A. M. Khazen, on the one hand, states that &quot;ontogeny is obliged to repeat the main stages of phylogeny.&quot; A. S. Rautian, on the other hand, argues that the reproduction of ancestral patterns of development is a key aspect of certain biological systems. Dr. Rolf Siewing acknowledges the similarity of embryos in different species, along with the laws of von Baer, but does not believe that one should compare embryos with adult stages of development. According to M. S. Fischer, reconsideration of the Biogenetic Law is possible as a result of two fundamental innovations in biology since Haeckel&#x27;s time: cladistics and developmental genetics.

In defense of Haeckel&#x27;s embryo drawings, the principal argument is that of &quot;schematisation.&quot; Haeckel&#x27;s drawings were not intended to be technical and scientific depictions, but rather schematic drawings and reconstructions for a specifically lay audience. Therefore, as R. Gursch argues, Haeckel&#x27;s embryo drawings should be regarded as &quot;reconstructions.&quot; Although his drawings are open to criticism, his drawings should not be considered falsifications of any sort. Although modern defense of Haeckel&#x27;s embryo drawings still considers the inaccuracy of his drawings, charges of fraud are considered unreasonable. As Erland Nordenskiöld argues, charges of fraud against Haeckel are unnecessary. R. Bender ultimately goes so far as to reject His&#x27;s claims regarding the fabrication of certain stages of development in Haeckel&#x27;s drawings, arguing that Haeckel&#x27;s embryo drawings are faithful representations of real stages of embryonic development in comparison to published embryos.

== Use of embryo drawings in contemporary biology ==
Although Stephen Jay Gould&#x27;s 1977 book &quot;Ontogeny and Phylogeny&quot; helps to reassess Haeckelian embryology, it does not address the controversy over Haeckel&#x27;s embryo drawings. Nevertheless, new interest in evolution in and around 1977 inspired developmental biologists to look more closely at Haeckel&#x27;s illustrations.

In current biology, fundamental research in developmental biology and evolutionary developmental biology is no longer driven by morphological comparisons between embryos, but more by molecular biology.

<text>Enthalpy () is the sum of a thermodynamic system&#x27;s internal energy and the product of its pressure and volume. It is a state function in thermodynamics used in many measurements in chemical, biological, and physical systems at a constant external pressure, which is conveniently provided by the large ambient atmosphere. The pressure–volume term expresses the work formula_1 that was done against constant external pressure formula_2 to establish the system&#x27;s physical dimensions from formula_3 to some final volume formula_4 (as formula_5), i.e. to make room for it by displacing its surroundings.
The pressure-volume term is very small for solids and liquids at common conditions, and fairly small for gases. Therefore, enthalpy is a stand-in for energy in chemical systems; bond, lattice, solvation, and other chemical &quot;energies&quot; are actually enthalpy differences. As a state function, enthalpy depends only on the final configuration of internal energy, pressure, and volume, not on the path taken to achieve it.

In the International System of Units (SI), the unit of measurement for enthalpy is the joule. Other historical conventional units still in use include the calorie and the British thermal unit (BTU).

The total enthalpy of a system cannot be measured directly because the internal energy contains components that are unknown, not easily accessible, or are not of interest for the thermodynamic problem at hand. In practice, a change in enthalpy is the preferred expression for measurements at constant pressure, because it simplifies the description of energy transfer. When transfer of matter into or out of the system is also prevented and no electrical or mechanical (stirring shaft or lift pumping) work is done, at constant pressure the enthalpy change equals the energy exchanged with the environment by heat.

In chemistry, the standard enthalpy of reaction is the enthalpy change when reactants in their standard states ( usually ) change to products in their standard states.
This quantity is the standard heat of reaction at constant pressure and temperature, but it can be measured by calorimetric methods even if the temperature does vary during the measurement, provided that the initial and final pressure and temperature correspond to the standard state. The value does not depend on the path from initial to final state because enthalpy is a state function.

Enthalpies of chemical substances are usually listed for pressure as a standard state. Enthalpies and enthalpy changes for reactions vary as a function of temperature,
but tables generally list the standard heats of formation of substances at . For endothermic (heat-absorbing) processes, the change is a positive value; for exothermic (heat-releasing) processes it is negative.

The enthalpy of an ideal gas is independent of its pressure or volume, and depends only on its temperature, which correlates to its thermal energy. Real gases at common temperatures and pressures often closely approximate this behavior, which simplifies practical thermodynamic design and analysis.

The word &quot;enthalpy&quot; is derived from the Greek word &quot;enthalpein&quot;, which means &quot;to heat&quot;.

==Definition==
The enthalpy of a thermodynamic system is defined as the sum of its internal energy and the product of its pressure and volume:
formula_6
where is the internal energy, is pressure, and is the volume of the system; is sometimes referred to as the pressure energy .

Enthalpy is an extensive property; it is proportional to the size of the system (for homogeneous systems). As intensive properties, the &quot;specific enthalpy&quot; is referenced to a unit of mass of the system, and the &quot;molar enthalpy&quot; where is the number of moles. For inhomogeneous systems the enthalpy is the sum of the enthalpies of the component subsystems:
formula_7
where
: is the total enthalpy of all the subsystems,
: refers to the various subsystems,
: refers to the enthalpy of each subsystem.

A closed system may lie in thermodynamic equilibrium in a static gravitational field, so that its pressure varies continuously with altitude, while, because of the equilibrium requirement, its temperature is invariant with altitude. (Correspondingly, the system&#x27;s gravitational potential energy density also varies with altitude.) Then the enthalpy summation becomes an integral:
formula_8
where
: (&quot;rho&quot;) is density (mass per unit volume),
: is the specific enthalpy (enthalpy per unit mass),
: represents the enthalpy density (enthalpy per unit volume),
: denotes an infinitesimally small element of volume within the system, for example, the volume of an infinitesimally thin horizontal layer.
The integral therefore represents the sum of the enthalpies of all the elements of the volume.

The enthalpy of a closed homogeneous system is its energy function with its entropy and its pressure as natural state variables which provide a differential relation for of the simplest form, derived as follows. We start from the first law of thermodynamics for closed systems for an infinitesimal process:
formula_9
where
: is a small amount of heat added to the system,
: is a small amount of work performed by the system.

In a homogeneous system in which only reversible processes or pure heat transfer are considered, the second law of thermodynamics gives with the absolute temperature and the infinitesimal change in entropy of the system. Furthermore, if only work is done, As a result,
formula_10

Adding to both sides of this expression gives
formula_11
or
formula_12
So
formula_13
and the coefficients of the natural variable differentials and are just the single variables and .

==Other expressions==
The above expression of in terms of entropy and pressure may be unfamiliar to some readers. There are also expressions in terms of more directly measurable variables such as temperature and pressure:
formula_14
where is the heat capacity at &quot;constant pressure&quot;, and is the coefficient of (cubic) thermal expansion:
formula_15

With this expression one can, in principle, determine the enthalpy if and are known as functions of and . However the expression is more complicated than formula_16 because is not a natural variable for the enthalpy .

At constant pressure, formula_17 so that formula_18 For an ideal gas, formula_19 reduces to this form even if the process involves a pressure change, because 

In a more general form, the first law describes the internal energy with additional terms involving the chemical potential and the number of particles of various types. The differential statement for then becomes
formula_20
where is the chemical potential per particle for a type  particle, and is the number of such particles. The last term can also be written as (with the number of moles of component added to the system and, in this case, the molar chemical potential) or as (with the mass of component added to the system and, in this case, the specific chemical potential).

===Characteristic functions and natural state variables===

The enthalpy expresses the thermodynamics of a system in the &quot;energy representation&quot;. As a function of state, its arguments include one intensive and several extensive state variables. The state variables , and are said to be the &quot;natural state variables&quot; in this representation. They are suitable for describing processes in which they are determined by factors in the surroundings. For example, when a virtual parcel of atmospheric air moves to a different altitude, the pressure surrounding it changes, and the process is often so rapid that there is too little time for heat transfer. This is the basis of the so-called adiabatic approximation that is used in meteorology.

Conjugate with the enthalpy, with these arguments, the other characteristic function of state of a thermodynamic system is its entropy, as a function of the same list of variables of state, except that the entropy is replaced in the list by the enthalpy . It expresses the &quot;entropy representation&quot;. The state variables , , and are said to be the &quot;natural state variables&quot; in this representation. They are suitable for describing processes in which they are experimentally controlled. For example, and can be controlled by allowing heat transfer, and by varying only the external pressure on the piston that sets the volume of the system.

==Physical interpretation==
The term is the energy of the system, and the term can be interpreted as the work that would be required to &quot;make room&quot; for the system if the pressure of the environment remained constant. When a system, for example, moles of a gas of volume at pressure and temperature , is created or brought to its present state from absolute zero, energy must be supplied equal to its internal energy plus , where is the work done in pushing against the ambient (atmospheric) pressure.

In physics and statistical mechanics it may be more interesting to study the internal properties of a constant-volume system and therefore the internal energy is used.
In chemistry, experiments are often conducted at constant atmospheric pressure, and the pressure–volume work represents a small, well-defined energy exchange with the atmosphere, so that is the appropriate expression for the heat of reaction. For a heat engine, the change in its enthalpy after a full cycle is equal to zero, since the final and initial state are equal.

== Relationship to heat ==
In order to discuss the relation between the enthalpy increase and heat supply, we return to the first law for closed systems, with the physics sign convention: , where the heat is supplied by conduction, radiation, Joule heating. We apply it to the special case with a constant pressure at the surface. In this case the work is given by (where is the pressure at the surface, is the increase of the volume of the system). Cases of long-range electromagnetic interaction require further state variables in their formulation and are not considered here. In this case the first law reads:
formula_21
Now,
formula_22
so
formula_23

If the system is under constant pressure, and consequently, the increase in enthalpy of the system is equal to the heat added:
formula_24
This is why the now-obsolete term &quot;heat content&quot; was used for enthalpy in the 19th century.

==Applications==
In thermodynamics, one can calculate enthalpy by determining the requirements for creating a system from &quot;nothingness&quot;; the mechanical work required, differs based upon the conditions that obtain during the creation of the thermodynamic system.

Energy must be supplied to remove particles from the surroundings to make space for the creation of the system, assuming that the pressure remains constant; this is the term. The supplied energy must also provide the change in internal energy , which includes activation energies, ionization energies, mixing energies, vaporization energies, chemical bond energies, and so forth. Together, these constitute the change in the enthalpy For systems at constant pressure, with no external work done other than the work, the change in enthalpy is the heat received by the system.

For a simple system with a constant number of particles at constant pressure, the difference in enthalpy is the maximum amount of thermal energy derivable from an isobaric thermodynamic process.

===Heat of reaction===

The total enthalpy of a system cannot be measured directly; the &quot;enthalpy change&quot; of a system is measured instead. Enthalpy change is defined by the following equation:
formula_25
where
: is the &quot;enthalpy change&quot;,
: is the final enthalpy of the system (in a chemical reaction, the enthalpy of the products or the system at equilibrium),
: is the initial enthalpy of the system (in a chemical reaction, the enthalpy of the reactants).

For an exothermic reaction at constant pressure, the system&#x27;s change in enthalpy, , is negative due to the products of the reaction having a smaller enthalpy than the reactants, and equals the heat released in the reaction if no electrical or mechanical work is done. In other words, the overall decrease in enthalpy is achieved by the generation of heat.
Conversely, for a constant-pressure endothermic reaction, is positive and equal to the heat &quot;absorbed&quot; in the reaction.

From the definition of enthalpy as the enthalpy change at constant pressure is However, for most chemical reactions, the work term is much smaller than the internal energy change , which is approximately equal to . As an example, for the combustion of carbon monoxide and 
Since the differences are so small, reaction enthalpies are often described as reaction energies and analyzed in terms of bond energies.

===Specific enthalpy===
The &quot;specific enthalpy&quot; of a uniform system is defined as , where is the mass of the system. Its SI unit is joule per kilogram. It can be expressed in other specific quantities by where is the specific internal energy, is the pressure, and is specific volume, which is equal to , where is the density.

===Enthalpy changes===
An enthalpy change describes the change in enthalpy observed in the constituents of a thermodynamic system when undergoing a transformation or chemical reaction. It is the difference between the enthalpy after the process has completed, i.e. the enthalpy of the products assuming that the reaction goes to completion, and the initial enthalpy of the system, namely the reactants. These processes are specified solely by their initial and final states, so that the enthalpy change for the reverse is the negative of that for the forward process.

A common standard enthalpy change is the enthalpy of formation, which has been determined for a large number of substances. Enthalpy changes are routinely measured and compiled in chemical and physical reference works, such as the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics. The following is a selection of enthalpy changes commonly recognized in thermodynamics.

When used in these recognized terms the qualifier &quot;change&quot; is usually dropped and the property is simply termed &quot;enthalpy of &quot;process&quot;&quot;. Since these properties are often used as reference values, it is very common to quote them for a standardized set of environmental parameters, or standard conditions, including:
* A pressure of one atmosphere (1 atm = 1013.25 hPa) or 1 bar
* A temperature of 25 °C = 298.15 K
* A concentration of 1.0 M when the element or compound is present in solution
* Elements or compounds in their normal physical states, i.e. standard state
For such standardized values the name of the enthalpy is commonly prefixed with the term &quot;standard&quot;, e.g. &quot;standard enthalpy of formation&quot;.

===Open systems===
In thermodynamic open systems, mass (of substances) may flow in and out of the system boundaries. The first law of thermodynamics for open systems states: The increase in the internal energy of a system is equal to the amount of energy added to the system by mass flowing in and by heating, minus the amount lost by mass flowing out and in the form of work done by the system:
formula_26
where is the average internal energy entering the system, and is the average internal energy leaving the system.

The region of space enclosed by the boundaries of the open system is usually called a control volume, and it may or may not correspond to physical walls. If we choose the shape of the control volume such that all flow in or out occurs perpendicular to its surface, then the flow of mass into the system performs work as if it were a piston of fluid pushing mass into the system, and the system performs work on the flow of mass out as if it were driving a piston of fluid. There are then two types of work performed: &quot;flow work&quot; described above, which is performed on the fluid (this is also often called &quot; work&quot;), and &quot;mechanical work&quot; (&quot;shaft work&quot;), which may be performed on some mechanical device such as a turbine or pump.

These two types of work are expressed in the equation
formula_27
Substitution into the equation above for the control volume (cv) yields
formula_28

The definition of enthalpy permits us to use this thermodynamic potential to account for both internal energy and work in fluids for open systems:
formula_29

If we allow also the system boundary to move (e.g. due to moving pistons), we get a rather general form of the first law for open systems.
In terms of time derivatives, using Newton&#x27;s dot notation for time derivatives, it reads:
formula_30
with sums over the various places where heat is supplied, mass flows into the system, and boundaries are moving. The terms represent enthalpy flows, which can be written as
formula_31
with formula_32 the mass flow and formula_33 the molar flow at position respectively. The term represents the rate of change of the system volume at position that results in power done by the system. The parameter represents all other forms of power done by the system such as shaft power, but it can also be, say, electric power produced by an electrical power plant.

Note that the previous expression holds true only if the kinetic energy flow rate is conserved between system inlet and outlet. Otherwise, it has to be included in the enthalpy balance. During steady-state operation of a device (see Turbine, Pump, and Engine), the average may be set equal to zero. This yields a useful expression for the average power generation for these devices in the absence of chemical reactions:
formula_34
where the angle brackets denote time averages. The technical importance of the enthalpy is directly related to its presence in the first law for open systems, as formulated above.

==Diagrams==
The enthalpy values of important substances can be obtained using commercial software. Practically all relevant material properties can be obtained either in tabular or in graphical form. There are many types of diagrams, such as diagrams, which give the specific enthalpy as function of temperature for various pressures, and diagrams, which give as function of for various . One of the most common diagrams is the temperature–specific entropy diagram ( diagram). It gives the melting curve and saturated liquid and vapor values together with isobars and isenthalps. These diagrams are powerful tools in the hands of the thermal engineer.

===Some basic applications===
The points  through in the figure play a role in the discussion in this section.
Points  and are saturated liquids, and point  is a saturated gas.

===Throttling===

One of the simple applications of the concept of enthalpy is the so-called throttling process, also known as Joule–Thomson expansion. It concerns a steady adiabatic flow of a fluid through a flow resistance (valve, porous plug, or any other type of flow resistance) as shown in the figure. This process is very important, since it is at the heart of domestic refrigerators, where it is responsible for the temperature drop between ambient temperature and the interior of the refrigerator. It is also the final stage in many types of liquefiers.

For a steady state flow regime, the enthalpy of the system (dotted rectangle) has to be constant. Hence

formula_35

Since the mass flow is constant, the specific enthalpies at the two sides of the flow resistance are the same:

formula_36

that is, the enthalpy per unit mass does not change during the throttling. The consequences of this relation can be demonstrated using the diagram above.

====Example 1====
Point c is at 200 bar and room temperature (300 K). A Joule–Thomson expansion from 200 bar to 1 bar follows a curve of constant enthalpy of roughly 425  (not shown in the diagram) lying between the 400 and 450  isenthalps and ends in point d, which is at a temperature of about 270 K . Hence the expansion from 200 bar to 1 bar cools nitrogen from 300 K to 270 K . In the valve, there is a lot of friction, and a lot of entropy is produced, but still the final temperature is below the starting value.

====Example 2====
Point e is chosen so that it is on the saturated liquid line with It corresponds roughly with and Throttling from this point to a pressure of 1 bar ends in the two-phase region (point f). This means that a mixture of gas and liquid leaves the throttling valve. Since the enthalpy is an extensive parameter, the enthalpy in is equal to the enthalpy in multiplied by the liquid fraction in plus the enthalpy in multiplied by the gas fraction in So

formula_37

With numbers:
: so 
This means that the mass fraction of the liquid in the liquid–gas mixture that leaves the throttling valve is 64%.

===Compressors===

A power is applied e.g. as electrical power. If the compression is adiabatic, the gas temperature goes up. In the reversible case it would be at constant entropy, which corresponds with a vertical line in the diagram. For example, compressing nitrogen from 1 bar (point a) to 2 bar (point b) would result in a temperature increase from 300 K to 380 K. In order to let the compressed gas exit at ambient temperature , heat exchange, e.g. by cooling water, is necessary. In the ideal case the compression is isothermal. The average heat flow to the surroundings is . Since the system is in the steady state the first law gives

formula_38

The minimal power needed for the compression is realized if the compression is reversible. In that case the second law of thermodynamics for open systems gives

formula_39

Eliminating gives for the minimal power

formula_40

For example, compressing 1 kg of nitrogen from 1 bar to 200 bar costs at least :
With the data, obtained with the diagram, we find a value of 

The relation for the power can be further simplified by writing it as

formula_41

With
this results in the final relation

==History and etymology==
The term &quot;enthalpy&quot; was coined relatively late in the history of thermodynamics, in the early 20th century. Energy was introduced in a modern sense by Thomas Young in 1802, while entropy by Rudolf Clausius in 1865. &quot;Energy&quot; uses the root of the Greek word (&quot;ergon&quot;), meaning &quot;work&quot;, to express the idea of capacity to perform work. &quot;Entropy&quot; uses the Greek word (&quot;tropē&quot;) meaning &quot;transformation&quot; or &quot;turning&quot;. &quot;Enthalpy&quot; uses the root of the Greek word (&quot;thalpos&quot;) &quot;warmth, heat&quot;.

The term expresses the obsolete concept of &quot;heat content&quot;, as refers to the amount of heat gained in a process at constant pressure only, but not in the general case when pressure is variable. J. W. Gibbs used the term &quot;a heat function for constant pressure&quot; for clarity.

Introduction of the concept of &quot;heat content&quot; is associated with Benoît Paul Émile Clapeyron and Rudolf Clausius (Clausius–Clapeyron relation, 1850).

The term &quot;enthalpy&quot; first appeared in print in 1909. It is attributed to Heike Kamerlingh Onnes, who most likely introduced it orally the year before, at the first meeting of the Institute of Refrigeration in Paris. It gained currency only in the 1920s, notably with the &quot;Mollier Steam Tables and Diagrams&quot;, published in 1927.

Until the 1920s, the symbol was used, somewhat inconsistently, for &quot;heat&quot; in general. The definition of as strictly limited to enthalpy or &quot;heat content at constant pressure&quot; was formally proposed by A. W. Porter in 1922.

<text>Erdoğan Atalay (born 22 September 1966) is a German actor. He is known for his role as police detective Semir Gerkhan in &quot;Alarm für Cobra 11 - Die Autobahnpolizei&quot;.

==Early life and career==
Atalay was born in Hanover, West Germany, to a Turkish father and German mother. He was a member of the Theater-AG at the IGS Garbsen. At age 18, he made his first appearance as a supporting role in &quot;Aladdin and the Magic Lamp&quot; at the National Theatre of Hanover before studying acting at the Hochschule für Musik und Theater Hamburg. Afterwards he took on guest roles in several German television series such as &quot;Music Groschenweise&quot;, &quot;Einsatz für Lohbeck&quot;, &quot;Doppelter Einsatz&quot; and &quot;Die Wache&quot;.

In March 1996, Action Concept cast Atalay in what would become his breakthrough role, starring as Semir Gerkhan, a police detective of Turkish origin. Atalay co-wrote the screenplay for one of the series&#x27; episodes, titled &quot;Checkmate,&quot; and is a consulting producer for the series as of 2016. In 2005, Atalay published a short story, &quot;Die Türkei ist da oben&quot; (&quot;Turkey is Up There&quot;), in the German-Turkish anthology &quot;Was lebbt du?&quot;. In September 2012 he shot together with Ilka Bessin (Cindy from Marzahn) the short film &quot;Alarm for Cindy 11&quot;, a parody of Alarm for Cobra 11. The short film was broadcast on September 15, 2012, in the program.

==Personal life==
Atalay&#x27;s first marriage was to film and theatre actress Astrid Pollmann in 2004; the couple separated in late 2009. They have one daughter, Pauletta, who has also starred alongside her father in &quot;Alarm für Cobra 11&quot; as Ayda Gerkhan, the middle child of Semir Gerkhan. His second child was born in mid-2012 to makeup artist and manager Katja Ohneck, with whom he is married as of 2017.

<text>Ennio Morricone (; ; 10 November 19286 July 2020) was an Italian composer, orchestrator, conductor, trumpeter, and pianist who wrote music in a wide range of styles. With more than 400 scores for cinema and television, as well as more than 100 classical works, Morricone is widely considered one of the most prolific and greatest film composers of all time. He received numerous accolades including two Academy Awards, three Grammy Awards, three Golden Globes, six BAFTAs, ten David di Donatello, eleven , two European Film Awards, the Golden Lion Honorary Award, and the Polar Music Prize in 2010.

His filmography includes more than 70 award-winning films, all Sergio Leone&#x27;s films since &quot;A Fistful of Dollars&quot;, all Giuseppe Tornatore&#x27;s films since &quot;Cinema Paradiso&quot;, Dario Argento&#x27;s &quot;Animal Trilogy&quot;, as well as &quot;The Battle of Algiers&quot; (1968), &quot;1900&quot; (1976), &quot;La Cage aux Folles&quot; (1978), &quot;Le Professionnel&quot; (1981), &quot;The Thing&quot; (1982), &quot;The Key&quot; (1983) by Tinto Brass and &quot;Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down!&quot; (1989). He received Academy Award for Best Original Score nominations for &quot;Days of Heaven&quot; (1978), &quot;The Mission&quot; (1986), &quot;The Untouchables&quot; (1987), &quot;Bugsy&quot; (1991), &quot;Malèna&quot; (2000) and &quot;The Hateful Eight&quot; (2015), winning for the last. He won the Academy Honorary Award in 2007. His score to &quot;The Good, the Bad and the Ugly&quot; (1966) is regarded as one of the most recognizable and influential soundtracks in history. It was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame.

After playing the trumpet in jazz bands in the 1940s, he became a studio arranger for RCA Victor and in 1955 started ghost writing for film and theatre. Throughout his career, he composed music for artists such as Paul Anka, Mina, Milva, Zucchero, and Andrea Bocelli. From 1960 to 1975, Morricone gained international fame for composing music for Westerns and—with an estimated 10 million copies sold—&quot;Once Upon a Time in the West&quot; is one of the best-selling scores worldwide. From 1966 to 1980, he was a main member of Il Gruppo, one of the first experimental composers collectives, and in 1969 he co-founded Forum Music Village, a prestigious recording studio. He continued to compose music for European productions, such as &quot;Marco Polo&quot;, &quot;La piovra&quot;, &quot;Nostromo&quot;, &quot;Fateless&quot;, &quot;&quot;, and &quot;En mai, fais ce qu&#x27;il te plait&quot;.

Morricone composed for Hollywood directors such as Don Siegel, Mike Nichols, Brian De Palma, Barry Levinson, Oliver Stone, Warren Beatty, John Carpenter, and Quentin Tarantino. He has also worked with directors such as Bernardo Bertolucci, Mauro Bolognini, Tinto Brass, Giuliano Montaldo, Roland Joffé, Wolfgang Petersen, Roman Polanski, Henri Verneuil, Mario Bava, Lucio Fulci, Umberto Lenzi, Gillo Pontecorvo, and Pier Paolo Pasolini. His best-known compositions include &quot;The Ecstasy of Gold&quot;, &quot;Se telefonando&quot;, &quot;Man with a Harmonica&quot;, &quot;Here&#x27;s to You&quot;, &quot;Chi Mai&quot;, &quot;Gabriel&#x27;s Oboe&quot;, and &quot;E Più Ti Penso&quot;. He has influenced many artists including Hans Zimmer, Danger Mouse, Dire Straits, Muse, Metallica, Fields of the Nephilim, and Radiohead.

==Early life and education==
Morricone was born in Rome, the son of Libera Ridolfi and Mario Morricone, a musician. At the time of his birth Italy was under fascist rule. Morricone had four siblings – Adriana, Aldo, Maria, and Franca – and lived in Trastevere in the centre of Rome. His father was a professional trumpeter who performed in light-music orchestras while his mother set up a small textile business. During his early schooldays, Morricone was also a classmate of his later collaborator Sergio Leone.

Morricone&#x27;s father first taught him to read music and to play several instruments. He entered the Saint Cecilia Conservatory to take trumpet lessons under the guidance of Umberto Semproni. He formally entered the conservatory in 1940 at age 12, enrolling in a four-year harmony program that he completed within six months. He studied the trumpet, composition, and choral music under the direction of Goffredo Petrassi, to whom Morricone would later dedicate concert pieces.

In 1941 Morricone was chosen among the students of the Saint Cecilia Conservatory to be a part of the Orchestra of the Opera, directed by Carlo Zecchi on the occasion of a tour of the Veneto region. He received his diploma in trumpet in 1946, continuing to work in classical composition and arrangement. Morricone received the &quot;Diploma in Instrumentation for Band Arrangement&quot; with a mark of 9/10 in 1952. His studies concluded at the Conservatory of Santa Cecilia in 1954 when he obtained a final 9.5/10 in his &quot;Diploma in Composition&quot; under Petrassi.

==Career==
===First compositions===
Morricone wrote his first compositions when he was six years old and he was encouraged to develop his natural talents. In 1946, he composed &quot;Il Mattino&quot; (&quot;The Morning&quot;) for voice and piano on a text by Fukuko, first in a group of seven &quot;youth&quot; Lieder.

In the following years, he continued to write music for the theatre as well as classical music for voice and piano, such as &quot;Imitazione&quot;, based on a text by Italian poet Giacomo Leopardi, &quot;Intimità&quot;, based on a text by Olinto Dini, &quot;Distacco I&quot; and &quot;Distacco II&quot; with words by R. Gnoli, &quot;Oboe Sommerso&quot; for baritone and five instruments with words by poet Salvatore Quasimodo, and &quot;Verrà la Morte&quot;, for alto and piano, based on a text by novelist Cesare Pavese.

In 1953, Morricone was asked by Gorni Kramer and Lelio Luttazzi to write an arrangement for some medleys in an American style for a series of evening radio shows. The composer continued with the composition of other &#x27;serious&#x27; classical pieces, thus demonstrating the flexibility and eclecticism that always has been an integral part of his character. Many orchestral and chamber compositions date, in fact, from the period between 1954 and 1959: &quot;Musica per archi e pianoforte&quot; (1954), &quot;Invenzione, Canone e Ricercare per piano&quot;; &quot;Sestetto per flauto, oboe, fagotto, violino, viola, e violoncello&quot; (1955), &quot;Dodici Variazione per oboe, violoncello, e piano&quot;; &quot;Trio per clarinetto, corno, e violoncello&quot;; &quot;Variazione su un tema di Frescobaldi&quot; (1956); &quot;Quattro pezzi per chitarra&quot; (1957); &quot;Distanze per violino, violoncello, e piano&quot;; &quot;Musica per undici violini, Tre Studi per flauto, clarinetto, e fagotto&quot; (1958); and the &quot;Concerto per orchestra&quot; (1957), dedicated to his teacher Goffredo Petrassi.

Morricone soon gained popularity by writing his first background music for radio dramas and quickly moved into film.

====Composing for radio, television, and pop artists====

Morricone&#x27;s career as an arranger began in 1950, by arranging the piece &quot;Mamma Bianca&quot; (Narciso Parigi). On occasion of the &quot;Anno Santo&quot; (Holy Year), he arranged a long group of popular songs of devotion for radio broadcasting.

In 1956, Morricone started to support his family by playing in a jazz band and arranging pop songs for the Italian broadcasting service RAI. He was hired by RAI in 1958 but quit his job on his first day at work when he was told that broadcasting of music composed by employees was forbidden by a company rule. Subsequently, Morricone became a top studio arranger at RCA Victor, working with Renato Rascel, Rita Pavone, Domenico Modugno, and Mario Lanza.

Throughout his career, Morricone composed songs for several national and international jazz and pop artists, including Gianni Meccia (&quot;Il barattolo&quot;, 1960), Gianni Morandi (&quot;Go Kart Twist&quot;, 1962; &quot;Non son degno di te&quot;, 1964), Alberto Lionello (&quot;La donna che vale&quot;, 1959), Edoardo Vianello (&quot;Ornella&quot;, 1960; &quot;Cicciona cha-cha&quot;, 1960; &quot;Faccio finta di dormire&quot;, 1961; &quot;T&#x27;ho conosciuta&quot;, 1963; and also &quot;Pinne, fucine ed occhiali&quot;, &quot;I Watussi&quot; and &quot;Guarda come dondolo&quot;), Nora Orlandi (&quot;Arianna&quot;, 1960), Jimmy Fontana (&quot;Twist no. 9&quot;; &quot;Nicole&quot;, 1962), Rita Pavone (&quot;Come te non c&#x27;e&#x27; nessuno&quot; and &quot;Pel di carota&quot; from 1962, arranged by Luis Bacalov), Catherine Spaak (&quot;Penso a te&quot;; &quot;Questi vent&#x27;anni miei&quot;, 1964), Luigi Tenco (&quot;Quello che conta&quot;; &quot;Tra tanta gente&quot;; 1962), Gino Paoli (&quot;Nel corso&quot; from 1963, written by Morricone with Paoli), Renato Rascel (&quot;Scirocco&quot;, 1964), Paul Anka (&quot;Ogni Volta&quot;), Amii Stewart, Rosy Armen (&quot;L&#x27;Amore Gira&quot;), Milva (&quot;Ridevi&quot;, &quot;Metti Una Sera A Cena&quot;), Françoise Hardy (&quot;Je changerais d&#x27;avis&quot;, 1966), Mireille Mathieu (&quot;Mon ami de toujours&quot;; &quot;Pas vu, pas pris&quot;, 1971; &quot;J&#x27;oublie la pluie et le soleil&quot;, 1974), and Demis Roussos (&quot;I Like The World&quot;, 1970).

In 1963, the composer co-wrote (with Roby Ferrante) the music for the composition &quot;Ogni volta&quot; (&quot;Every Time&quot;), a song that was performed by Paul Anka for the first time during the Festival di Sanremo in 1964. This song was arranged and conducted by Morricone and sold more than three million copies worldwide, including one million copies in Italy alone.

Another success was his composition &quot;Se telefonando&quot;. Performed by Mina, it was a track on &quot;Studio Uno 66&quot;, the 4th studio album by Mina. Morricone&#x27;s sophisticated arrangement of &quot;Se telefonando&quot; was a combination of melodic trumpet lines, Hal Blaine–style drumming, a string set, a 1960s Europop female choir, and intensive subsonic-sounding trombones. The Italian Hitparade No. 7 song had eight transitions of tonality building tension throughout the chorus. During the following decades, the song was recorded by several performers in Italy and abroad including covers by Françoise Hardy and Iva Zanicchi (1966), Delta V (2005), Vanessa and the O&#x27;s (2007), and Neil Hannon (2008). &quot;Françoise Hardy – Mon amie la rose&quot; site in the reader&#x27;s poll conducted by the newspaper&quot; la Repubblica&quot; to celebrate Mina&#x27;s 70th anniversary in 2010, 30,000 voters picked the track as the best song ever recorded by Mina.

In 1987, Morricone co-wrote &quot;It Couldn&#x27;t Happen Here&quot; with the Pet Shop Boys. Other compositions for international artists include: &quot;La metà di me&quot; and &quot;Immagina&quot; (1988) by Ruggero Raimondi, &quot;Libera l&#x27;amore&quot; (1989) performed by Zucchero, &quot;Love Affair&quot; (1994) by k.d. lang, &quot;Ha fatto un sogno&quot; (1997) by Antonello Venditti, &quot;Di Più&quot; (1997) by Tiziana Tosca Donati, &quot;Come un fiume tu&quot; (1998), &quot;Un Canto&quot; (1998) and &quot;Conradian&quot; (2006) by Andrea Bocelli, &quot;Ricordare&quot; (1998) and &quot;Salmo&quot; (2000) by Angelo Branduardi, and &quot;My heart and I&quot; (2001) by Sting.

====First film scores====

After graduation in 1954, Morricone started to write and arrange music as a ghost writer for films credited to already well-known composers, while also arranging for many light music orchestras of the RAI television network, working especially with Armando Trovajoli, Alessandro Cicognini, and Carlo Savina. He occasionally adopted Anglicized pseudonyms, such as Dan Savio and Leo Nichols.

In 1959, Morricone was the conductor (and uncredited co-composer) for Mario Nascimbene&#x27;s score to &quot;Morte di un amico&quot; (&quot;Death of a Friend&quot;), an Italian drama directed by Franco Rossi. In the same year, he composed music for the theatre show &quot;Il lieto fine&quot; by Luciano Salce.

1961 marked his real film debut with Luciano Salce&#x27;s &quot;Il Federale (The Fascist)&quot;. In an interview with American composer Fred Karlin, Morricone discussed his beginnings, stating, &quot;My first films were light comedies or costume movies that required simple musical scores that were easily created, a genre that I never completely abandoned even when I went on to much more important films with major directors&quot;.

With &quot;Il Federale&quot; Morricone began a long-run collaboration with Luciano Salce. In 1962, Morricone composed the jazz-influenced score for Salce&#x27;s comedy &quot;La voglia matta (Crazy Desire)&quot;. That year Morricone also arranged Italian singer Edoardo Vianello&#x27;s summer hit &quot;Pinne, fucile, e occhiali&quot;, a cha-cha song, peppered with added water effects, unusual instrumental sounds and unexpected stops and starts.

Morricone wrote works for the concert hall in a more avant-garde style. Some of these have been recorded, such as &quot;Ut&quot;, a trumpet concerto dedicated to Mauro Maur.

===The Group and New Consonance===

From 1964 up to their eventual disbandment in 1980, Morricone was part of &quot;Gruppo di Improvvisazione Nuova Consonanza&quot; (G.I.N.C.), a group of composers who performed and recorded avant-garde free improvisations. The Rome-based avant-garde ensemble was dedicated to the development of improvisation and new music methods. The ensemble functioned as a laboratory of sorts, working with anti-musical systems and sound techniques in an attempt to redefine the new music ensemble and explore &quot;New Consonance&quot;.

Known as &quot;The Group&quot; or &quot;Il Gruppo&quot;, they released seven albums across the Deutsche Grammophon, RCA, and Cramps labels: &quot;Gruppo di Improvvisazione Nuova Consonanza&quot; (1966), &quot;The Private Sea of Dreams&quot; (1967), &quot;Improvisationen&quot; (1968), &quot;The Feedback&quot; (1970), &quot;Improvvisazioni a Formazioni Variate&quot; (1973), &quot;Nuova Consonanza&quot; (1975), and &quot;Musica su Schemi&quot; (1976). Perhaps the most famous of these is their album entitled &quot;The Feed-back&quot;, which combines free jazz and avant-garde classical music with funk; the album frequently is sampled by hip hop DJs and is considered to be one of the most collectable records in existence, often fetching more than $1,000 at auction.
Morricone played a key role in The Group and was among the core members in its revolving line-up; in addition to serving as their trumpet player, he directed them on many occasions and they can be heard on a large number of his scores. Held in high regard in avant-garde music circles, they are considered to be the first experimental composers collective, their only peers being the British improvisation collective AMM. Their influence can be heard in free improvising ensembles from the European movements including the Evan Parker Electro-Acoustic Ensemble, the Swiss electronic free improvisation group Voice Crack, John Zorn, and in the techniques of modern classical music and avant-garde jazz groups. The ensemble&#x27;s groundbreaking work informed their work in composition. The ensemble also performed in varying capacities with Morricone, contributing to some of his 1960s and 1970s Italian soundtracks, including &quot;A Quiet Place in the Country&quot; (1969) and &quot;Cold Eyes of Fear&quot; (1971).

===Film music genres===

==== Comedy ====

Morricone&#x27;s earliest scores were Italian light comedy and costume pictures, where he learned to write simple, memorable themes. During the 1960s and 1970s he composed the scores for comedies such as &quot;Eighteen in the Sun&quot; (&quot;Diciottenni al sole&quot;, 1962), &quot;Il Successo&quot; (1963), Lina Wertmüller&#x27;s &quot;The Lizards&quot; (&quot;I basilischi&quot;, 1963), &quot;Slalom&quot; (1965), &quot;Menage all&#x27;italiana&quot; (&quot;Menage Italian Style&quot;, 1965), &quot;How I Learned to Love Women&quot; (&quot;Come imparai ad amare le donne&quot;, 1966), &quot;Her Harem&quot; (&quot;L&#x27;harem&quot;, 1967), &quot;A Fine Pair&quot; (&quot;Ruba al prossimo tuo&quot;, 1968), &quot;L&#x27;Alibi&quot; (1969), &quot;This Kind of Love&quot; (&quot;Questa specie d&#x27;amore&quot;, 1972), &quot;Winged Devils&quot; (&quot;Forza &quot;G&quot;&quot;, 1972), and &quot;Fiorina la vacca&quot; (1972).

His best-known scores for comedies includes &quot;La Cage aux Folles&quot; (1978) and &quot;La Cage aux Folles II&quot; (1980), both directed by Édouard Molinaro, &quot;Il ladrone&quot; (&quot;The Good Thief&quot;, 1980), Georges Lautner&#x27;s &quot;La Cage aux Folles 3: The Wedding&quot; (1985), Pedro Almodóvar&#x27;s &quot;Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down!&quot; (1990) and Warren Beatty&#x27;s &quot;Bulworth&quot; (1998). Morricone never ceased to arrange and write music for comedies. In 2007, he composed a lighthearted score for the Italian romantic comedy &quot;Tutte le Donne della mia Vita&quot; by Simona Izzo, the director who co-wrote the Morricone-scored religious mini-series &quot;Il Papa Buono&quot;.

==== Westerns ====
Although his first films were undistinguished, Morricone&#x27;s arrangement of an American folk song intrigued director and former schoolmate Sergio Leone. Before being associated with Leone, Morricone already had composed some music for less-known western movies such as &quot;Duello nel Texas&quot; (aka &quot;Gunfight at Red Sands&quot;) (1963). In 1962, Morricone met American folksinger Peter Tevis, with the two collaborating on a version of Woody Guthrie&#x27;s &quot;Pastures of Plenty&quot;. Tevis is credited with singing the lyrics of Morricone&#x27;s songs such as &quot;A Gringo Like Me&quot; (from &quot;Gunfight at Red Sands&quot;) and &quot;Lonesome Billy&quot; (from &quot;Bullets Don&#x27;t Argue&quot;). Tevis later recorded a vocal version of &quot;A Fistful of Dollars&quot; that was not used in the film.

===== Association with Sergio Leone =====
The turning point in Morricone&#x27;s career took place in 1964, the year in which his third child, Andrea Morricone, who would also become a film composer, was born. Film director and former schoolmate Sergio Leone hired Morricone, and together they created a distinctive score to accompany Leone&#x27;s different version of the Western, &quot;A Fistful of Dollars&quot; (1964).

===== The Dollars Trilogy =====
Because budget strictures limited Morricone&#x27;s access to a full orchestra, he used gunshots, cracking whips, whistle, voices, jew&#x27;s harp, trumpets, and the new Fender electric guitar, instead of orchestral arrangements of Western standards à la John Ford. Morricone used his special effects to punctuate and comically tweak the action—cluing in the audience to the taciturn man&#x27;s ironic stance. 

As memorable as Leone&#x27;s close-ups, harsh violence, and black comedy, Morricone&#x27;s work helped to expand the musical possibilities of film scoring. Initially, Morricone was billed on the film as Dan Savio, a name they had used on Duello nel Texas to help its appeal on the international market. &quot;A Fistful of Dollars&quot; came out in Italy in 1964 and was released in America three years later, greatly popularising the so-called Spaghetti Western genre. For the American release, Sergio Leone followed Morricone and Massimo Dallamano&#x27;s lead and decided to adopt an American-sounding name, Bob Robertson. Over the film&#x27;s theatrical release, it grossed more than any other Italian film up to that point. The film debuted in the United States in January 1967, where it grossed for the year. It eventually grossed $14.5 million in its American release, against its budget of 200,000.

With the score of &quot;A Fistful of Dollars&quot;, Morricone began his 20-year collaboration with his childhood friend Alessandro Alessandroni and his Cantori Moderni. Alessandroni provided the whistling and the twanging guitar on the film scores, while his Cantori Moderni were a flexible troupe of modern singers. Morricone in particular drew on the solo soprano of the group, Edda Dell&#x27;Orso, at the height of her powers &quot;an extraordinary voice at my disposal&quot;.

The composer subsequently scored Leone&#x27;s other two &quot;Dollars Trilogy&quot; (or &quot;Man with No Name Trilogy&quot;) spaghetti westerns: &quot;For a Few Dollars More&quot; (1965) and &quot;The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly&quot; (1966). All three films starred the American actor Clint Eastwood as &quot;The Man With No Name&quot; and depicted Leone&#x27;s own intense vision of the mythical West. Morricone commented in 2007: &quot;Some of the music was written before the film, which was unusual. Leone&#x27;s films were made like that because he wanted the music to be an important part of it; he kept the scenes longer because he did not want the music to end.&quot; According to Morricone this explains &quot;why the films are so slow&quot;.

Despite the small film budgets, the &quot;Dollars Trilogy&quot; was a box-office success. The available budget for &quot;The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly&quot; was about 1.2 million, but it became the most successful film of the &quot;Dollars Trilogy&quot;, grossing 25.1 million in the United States and more than Lire2.3 billion (1.2 million EUR) in Italy alone. Morricone&#x27;s score became a major success and sold more than three million copies worldwide. On 14 August 1968 the original score was certified by the RIAA with a golden record for the sale of 500,000 copies in the United States alone.

The main theme to &quot;The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly&quot;, also titled &quot;The Good, the Bad and the Ugly&quot;, was a hit in 1968 for Hugo Montenegro, whose rendition was a No.2 Billboard pop single in the U.S. and a U.K. No.1 single (for four weeks from mid-November that year).

&quot;The Ecstasy of Gold&quot; became one of Morricone&#x27;s best-known compositions. The opening scene of Jeff Tremaine&#x27;s &quot;Jackass Number Two&quot; (2006), in which the cast is chased through a suburban neighbourhood by bulls, is accompanied by this piece. While punk rock band The Ramones used &quot;The Ecstasy of Gold&quot; as a closing theme during their live performances, Metallica uses &quot;The Ecstasy of Gold&quot; as the introductory music for its concerts since 1983. This composition is also included on Metallica&#x27;s live symphonic album &quot;S&amp;M&quot; as well as the live album &quot;Live Shit: Binge &amp; Purge&quot;. An instrumental metal cover by Metallica (with minimal vocals by lead singer James Hetfield) appeared on the 2007 Morricone tribute album &quot;We All Love Ennio Morricone&quot;. This metal version was nominated for a Grammy Award in the category of Best Rock Instrumental Performance. In 2009, the Grammy Award-winning hip-hop artist Coolio extensively sampled the theme for his song &quot;Change&quot;.

===== &quot;Once Upon a Time in the West&quot; and others =====
Subsequent to the success of the &quot;Dollars trilogy&quot;, Morricone also composed the scores for &quot;Once Upon a Time in the West&quot; (1968) and Leone&#x27;s last credited western film &quot;A Fistful of Dynamite&quot; (1971), as well as the score for &quot;My Name Is Nobody&quot; (1973).

Morricone&#x27;s score for &quot;Once Upon a Time in the West&quot; is one of the best-selling original instrumental scores in the world today, with as many as 10 million copies sold, including one million copies in France, and more than 800,000 copies in the Netherlands.

The collaboration with Leone is considered one of the exemplary collaborations between a director and a composer. Morricone&#x27;s last score for Leone was for his last film, the gangster drama &quot;Once Upon a Time in America&quot; (1984). Leone died on 30 April 1989 of a heart attack at the age of 60. Before his death in 1989, Leone was part-way through planning a film on the Siege of Leningrad, set during World War II. By 1989, Leone had been able to acquire 100 million in financing from independent backers for the war epic. He had convinced Morricone to compose the film score. The project was cancelled when Leone died two days before he was to officially sign on for the film.

In early 2003, Italian filmmaker Giuseppe Tornatore announced he would direct a film called &quot;Leningrad&quot;. The film has yet to go into production and Morricone was cagey as to details on account of Tornatore&#x27;s superstitious nature.

===== Association with Sergio Corbucci and Sergio Sollima =====

Two years after the start of his collaboration with Sergio Leone, Morricone also started to score music for another Spaghetti Western director, Sergio Corbucci. The composer wrote music for Corbucci&#x27;s &quot;Navajo Joe&quot; (1966), &quot;The Hellbenders&quot; (1967), &quot;The Mercenary/The Professional Gun&quot; (1968), &quot;The Great Silence&quot; (1968), &quot;Compañeros&quot; (1970), &quot;Sonny and Jed&quot; (1972), and &quot;What Am I Doing in the Middle of the Revolution?&quot; (1972).

In addition, Morricone composed music for the western films by Sergio Sollima, &quot;The Big Gundown&quot; (with Lee Van Cleef, 1966), &quot;Face to Face&quot; (1967), and &quot;Run, Man, Run&quot; (1968), as well as the 1970 crime thriller &quot;Violent City&quot; (with Charles Bronson) and the poliziottesco film &quot;Revolver&quot; (1973).

==== Other westerns ====
Other relevant scores for less popular Spaghetti Westerns include &quot;Duello nel Texas&quot; (1963), &quot;Bullets Don&#x27;t Argue&quot; (1964), &quot;A Pistol for Ringo&quot; (1965), &quot;The Return of Ringo&quot; (1965), &quot;Seven Guns for the MacGregors&quot; (1966), &quot;The Hills Run Red&quot; (1966), Giulio Petroni&#x27;s &quot;Death Rides a Horse&quot; (1967) and &quot;Tepepa&quot; (1968), &quot;A Bullet for the General&quot; (1967), &quot;Guns for San Sebastian&quot; (with Charles Bronson and Anthony Quinn, 1968), &quot;A Sky Full of Stars for a Roof&quot; (1968), &quot;The Five Man Army&quot; (1969), Don Siegel&#x27;s &quot;Two Mules for Sister Sara&quot; (1970), &quot;Life Is Tough, Eh Providence?&quot; (1972), and &quot;Buddy Goes West&quot; (1981).

====Dramas and political movies====

With Leone&#x27;s films, Ennio Morricone&#x27;s name had been put firmly on the map. Most of Morricone&#x27;s film scores of the 1960s were composed outside the Spaghetti Western genre, while still using Alessandroni&#x27;s team. Their music included the themes for &quot;Il Malamondo&quot; (1964), &quot;Slalom&quot; (1965), and &quot;Listen, Let&#x27;s Make Love&quot; (1967). In 1968, Morricone reduced his work outside the movie business and wrote scores for 20 films in the same year. The scores included psychedelic accompaniment for Mario Bava&#x27;s superhero romp &quot;&quot; (1968).

Morricone collaborated with Marco Bellocchio (&quot;Fists in the Pocket&quot;, 1965), Gillo Pontecorvo (&quot;The Battle of Algiers&quot; (1966), and &quot;Queimada!&quot; (1969) with Marlon Brando), Roberto Faenza (H2S, 1968), Giuliano Montaldo (&quot;Sacco e Vanzetti&quot;, 1971), Giuseppe Patroni Griffi (&quot;&#x27;Tis Pity She&#x27;s a Whore&quot;, 1971), Mauro Bolognini (&quot;Drama of the Rich&quot;, 1974), Umberto Lenzi (&quot;Almost Human&quot;, 1974), Pier Paolo Pasolini (&quot;Salò, or the 120 Days of Sodom&quot;, 1975), Bernardo Bertolucci (&quot;Novecento&quot;, 1976), and Tinto Brass (&quot;The Key&quot;, 1983 and &quot;Senso &#x27;45&quot;, 2002).

In 1970, Morricone wrote the score for &quot;Violent City&quot;. That same year, he received his first for the music in &quot;Metti una sera a cena&quot; (Giuseppe Patroni Griffi, 1969) and his second only a year later for &quot;Sacco e Vanzetti&quot; (Giuliano Montaldo, 1971), in which he collaborated with the legendary American folk singer and activist Joan Baez. His soundtrack for &quot;Sacco e Vanzetti&quot; contains another well-known composition by Morricone, the folk song &quot;Here&#x27;s to You&quot;, sung by Baez. For the writing of the lyrics, Baez was inspired by a letter from Bartolomeo Vanzetti: &quot;Father, yes, I am a prisoner / Fear not to relay my crime&quot;. The song was later included in movies such as &quot;The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou&quot;.

==== &quot;Giallo&quot; and horror ====
Morricone&#x27;s eclecticism found its way to films in the horror genre, such as the giallo thrillers of Dario Argento, from &quot;The Bird with the Crystal Plumage&quot; (1970), &quot;The Cat o&#x27; Nine Tails&quot; (1971), and &quot;Four Flies on Grey Velvet&quot; (1971) to &quot;The Stendhal Syndrome&quot; (1996) and &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot; (1998). His other horror scores include &quot;Nightmare Castle&quot; (1965), &quot;A Quiet Place in the Country&quot; (1968), &quot;The Antichrist&quot; (1974), and &quot;Night Train Murders&quot; (1975).

In addition, Morricone composed music for many popular and cult Italian &quot;giallo&quot; films, such as &quot;Unknown Woman&quot; (1969), &quot;Forbidden Photos of a Lady Above Suspicion&quot; (1970), &quot;A Lizard in a Woman&#x27;s Skin&quot; (1971), &quot;Cold Eyes of Fear&quot; (1971), &quot;The Fifth Cord&quot; (1971), &quot;Short Night of Glass Dolls&quot; (1971), &quot;The Black Belly of the Tarantula&quot; (1971) &quot;My Dear Killer&quot; (1972), &quot;What Have You Done to Solange?&quot; (1972), &quot;Who Saw Her Die?&quot; (1972), &quot;Spasmo&quot; (1974), and &quot;Autopsy&quot; (1975).

In 1977 Morricone scored John Boorman&#x27;s &quot;Exorcist II: The Heretic&quot; and Alberto De Martino&#x27;s apocalyptic horror film &quot;Holocaust 2000&quot;, starring Kirk Douglas. In 1982 he composed the score for John Carpenter&#x27;s science fiction horror movie &quot;The Thing&quot;. Morricone&#x27;s main theme for the film was reflected in Marco Beltrami&#x27;s film&#x27;s score of prequel of the 1982 film, which was released in 2011.

===Hollywood career===
The &quot;Dollars Trilogy&quot; was not released in the United States until 1967 when United Artists, who had already enjoyed success distributing the British-produced James Bond films in the United States, decided to release Sergio Leone&#x27;s Spaghetti Westerns. The American release gave Morricone an exposure in America and his film music became quite popular in the United States.

One of Morricone&#x27;s first contributions to an American director concerned his music for the religious epic film &quot;The Bible: In the Beginning...&quot; by John Huston. According to Sergio Miceli&#x27;s book &quot;Morricone, la musica, il cinema&quot;, Morricone wrote about 15 or 16 minutes of music, which were recorded for a screen test and conducted by Franco Ferrara. At first Morricone&#x27;s teacher Goffredo Petrassi had been engaged to write the score for the great big-budget epic, but Huston preferred another composer. RCA Records then proposed Morricone who was under contract with them, but a conflict between the film&#x27;s producer Dino De Laurentiis and RCA occurred. The producer wanted to have exclusive rights for the soundtrack, while RCA still had the monopoly on Morricone at that time and did not want to release the composer. Subsequently, Morricone&#x27;s work was rejected because he did not get permission from RCA to work for Dino De Laurentiis alone. The composer reused the parts of his unused score for &quot;The Bible: In the Beginning&quot; in such films as &quot;The Return of Ringo&quot; (1965) by Duccio Tessari and Alberto Negrin&#x27;s &quot;The Secret of the Sahara&quot; (1987).

Morricone never left Rome to compose his music and never learned to speak English. But given that he always worked in a wide field of composition genres, from &quot;absolute music&quot;, which he always produced, to &quot;applied music&quot;, working as orchestrator as well as conductor in the recording field, and then as a composer for theatre, radio, and cinema, the impression arises that he never really cared about his standing in the eyes of Hollywood.

====1970–1985: From &quot;Two Mules&quot; to &quot;Red Sonja&quot;====

In 1970, Morricone composed the music for Don Siegel&#x27;s &quot;Two Mules for Sister Sara&quot;, an American-Mexican western film starring Shirley MacLaine and Clint Eastwood. The same year the composer also delivered the title theme &quot;The Men from Shiloh&quot; for the American Western television series The Virginian.

In 1974–1975 Morricone wrote music for &quot;Spazio 1999&quot;, an Italian-produced compilation movie made to launch the Italian-British television series &quot;&quot;, while the original episodes featured music by Barry Gray. A soundtrack album was only released on CD in 2016 and on LP in 2017. In 1975 he scored the George Kennedy revenge thriller &quot;The &quot;Human&quot; Factor&quot;, which was the final film of director Edward Dmytryk. Two years later he composed the score for the sequel to William Friedkin&#x27;s 1973 film &quot;The Exorcist&quot;, directed by John Boorman: &quot;Exorcist II: The Heretic&quot;. The horror film was a major disappointment at the box office. The film grossed 30,749,142 in the United States.

In 1978, the composer worked with Terrence Malick for &quot;Days of Heaven&quot; starring Richard Gere, for which he earned his first nomination at the Oscars for Best Original Score.

Despite the fact that Morricone had produced some of the most popular and widely imitated film music ever written throughout the 1960s and 1970s, &quot;Days of Heaven&quot; earned him his first Oscar nomination for Best Original Score, with his score up against Jerry Goldsmith&#x27;s &quot;The Boys from Brazil&quot;, Dave Grusin&#x27;s &quot;Heaven Can Wait&quot;, Giorgio Moroder&#x27;s &quot;Midnight Express&quot; (the eventual winner), and John Williams&#x27;s &quot;Superman: The Movie&quot; at the Oscar ceremonies in 1979.
====1986–2020: From &quot;The Mission&quot; to &quot;The Hateful Eight&quot;====

Association with Roland Joffé
&quot;The Mission&quot;, directed by Joffé, was about a piece of history considerably more distant, as Spanish Jesuit missionaries see their work undone as a tribe of Paraguayan natives fall within a territorial dispute between the Spanish and Portuguese. At one point the score was one of the world&#x27;s best-selling film scores, selling over 3 million copies worldwide.

Morricone finally received a second Oscar nomination for &quot;The Mission&quot;. Morricone&#x27;s original score lost out to Herbie Hancock&#x27;s coolly arranged jazz on Bertrand Tavernier&#x27;s &quot;Round Midnight&quot;. It was considered a surprising win and a controversial one, given that much of the music in the film was pre-existing. Morricone stated the following during a 2001 interview with &quot;The Guardian&quot;: &quot;I definitely felt that I should have won for &quot;The Mission&quot;. Especially when you consider that the Oscar winner that year was &quot;Round Midnight&quot;, which was not an original score. It had a very good arrangement by Herbie Hancock, but it used existing pieces. So there could be no comparison with &quot;The Mission&quot;. There was a theft!&quot; His score for &quot;The Mission&quot; was ranked at number 1 in a poll of the all-time greatest film scores. The top 10 list was compiled by 40 film composers such as Michael Giacchino and Carter Burwell. The score is ranked 23rd on the AFI&#x27;s list of 25 greatest film scores of all time.
==== Association with De Palma and Levinson ====

On three occasions, Brian De Palma worked with Morricone: &quot;The Untouchables&quot; (1987), the 1989 war drama &quot;Casualties of War&quot; and the science fiction film &quot;Mission to Mars&quot; (2000). Morricone&#x27;s score for &quot;The Untouchables&quot; resulted in his third nomination for Academy Award for Best Original Score.

In a 2001 interview with &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Morricone stated that he had good experiences with De Palma: &quot;De Palma is delicious! He respects music, he respects composers. For &quot;The Untouchables&quot;, everything I proposed to him was fine, but then he wanted a piece that I didn&#x27;t like at all, and of course, we didn&#x27;t have an agreement on that. It was something I didn&#x27;t want to write – a triumphal piece for the police. I think I wrote nine different pieces for this in total and I said, &#x27;Please don&#x27;t choose the sixth!&#x27; because it was the worst. And guess what he chose? The sixth one. But it really suits the movie.&quot;

Another American director, Barry Levinson, commissioned the composer on two occasions. First, for the crime-drama &quot;Bugsy&quot;, starring Warren Beatty, which received ten Oscar nominations, winning two for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration (Dennis Gassner, Nancy Haigh) and Best Costume Design.

&quot;He doesn&#x27;t have a piano in his studio, I always thought that with composers, you sit at the piano, and you try to find the melody. There&#x27;s no such thing with Morricone. He hears a melody, and he writes it down. He hears the orchestration completely done&quot;, said Levinson in an interview.

==== Other notable Hollywood scores ====

During his career in Hollywood, Morricone was approached for numerous other projects, including the Gregory Nava drama &quot;A Time of Destiny&quot; (1988), &quot;Frantic&quot; by Polish-French director Roman Polanski (1988, starring Harrison Ford), Franco Zeffirelli&#x27;s 1990 drama film &quot;Hamlet&quot; (starring Mel Gibson and Glenn Close), the neo-noir crime film &quot;State of Grace&quot; by Phil Joanou (1990, starring Sean Penn and Ed Harris), &quot;Rampage&quot; (1992) by William Friedkin, and the romantic drama &quot;Love Affair&quot; (1994) by Warren Beatty.
==== Association with Quentin Tarantino ====

In 2009, Tarantino originally wanted Morricone to compose the film score for &quot;Inglourious Basterds&quot;. Morricone was unable to, because the film&#x27;s sped-up production schedule conflicted with his scoring of Giuseppe Tornatore&#x27;s &quot;Baarìa&quot;. However, Tarantino did use eight tracks composed by Morricone in the film, with four of them included on the soundtrack. The tracks came originally from Morricone&#x27;s scores for &quot;The Big Gundown&quot; (1966), &quot;Revolver&quot; (1973) and &quot;Allonsanfàn&quot; (1974).

In 2012, Morricone composed the song &quot;Ancora Qui&quot; with lyrics by Italian singer Elisa for Tarantino&#x27;s &quot;Django Unchained&quot;, a track that appeared together with three existing music tracks composed by Morricone on the soundtrack. &quot;Ancora Qui&quot; was one of the contenders for an Academy Award nomination in the Best Original Song category, but eventually the song was not nominated. On 4 January 2013 Morricone presented Tarantino with a Life Achievement Award at a special ceremony being cast as a continuation of the International Rome Film Festival. In 2014, Morricone was misquoted as claiming that he would &quot;never work&quot; with Tarantino again, and later agreed to write an original film score for Tarantino&#x27;s &quot;The Hateful Eight&quot;, which won him an Academy Award in 2016 in the Best Original Score category. His nomination for this film marked him at that time as the second oldest nominee in Academy history, behind Gloria Stuart. Morricone&#x27;s win marked his first competitive Oscar, and at the age of 87, he became the oldest person at the time to win a competitive Oscar.

===Composer for Giuseppe Tornatore===

In 1988, Morricone started an ongoing and very successful collaboration with Italian director Giuseppe Tornatore. His first score for Tornatore was for the drama film &quot;Cinema Paradiso&quot;. The international version of the film won the Special Jury Prize at the 1989 Cannes Film Festival and the 1989 Best Foreign Language Film Oscar. Morricone received a BAFTA award with his son Andrea, and a David di Donatello for his score. In 2002, the director&#x27;s cut 173-minute version was released (known in the US as &quot;Cinema Paradiso: The New Version&quot;).
After the success of &quot;Cinema Paradiso&quot;, the composer wrote the music for all subsequent films by Tornatore: the drama film &quot;Everybody&#x27;s Fine&quot; (Stanno Tutti Bene, 1990), &quot;A Pure Formality&quot; (1994) starring Gérard Depardieu and Roman Polanski, &quot;The Star Maker&quot; (1995), &quot;The Legend of 1900&quot; (1998) starring Tim Roth, the 2000 romantic drama &quot;Malèna&quot; (which featured Monica Bellucci) and the psychological thriller mystery film &quot;La sconosciuta&quot; (2006). Morricone also composed the scores for &quot;Baarìa&quot; (2009), &quot;The Best Offer&quot; (2013) starring Geoffrey Rush, Jim Sturgess and Donald Sutherland and the romantic drama &quot;The Correspondence&quot; (2015)

The composer won several music awards for his scores in Tornatore&#x27;s movies. Morricone received a fifth Academy Award nomination and a Golden Globe nomination for &quot;Malèna&quot;. For &quot;Legend of 1900&quot;, he won a Golden Globe Award for Best Original Score. In September 2021 Tornatore presented out of competition at the 78th Venice International Film Festival a documentary film about Morricone, &quot;Ennio&quot;.

=== Television series and last works ===

Morricone wrote the score for the Mafia television series &quot;La piovra&quot; seasons 2 to 10 from 1985 to 2001, including the themes &quot;Droga e sangue&quot; (&quot;Drugs and Blood&quot;), &quot;La Morale&quot;, and &quot;L&#x27;Immorale&quot;. Morricone worked as the conductor of seasons 3 to 5 of the series. He also worked as the music supervisor for the television project &quot;La bibbia&quot; (&quot;The Bible&quot;).
In the late 1990s, he collaborated with his son Andrea on the &quot;Ultimo&quot; crime dramas, resulting in &quot;Ultimo&quot; (1998), &quot;Ultimo 2 – La sfida&quot; (1999), &quot;Ultimo 3 – L&#x27;infiltrato&quot; (2004) and &quot;Ultimo 4 – L&#x27;occhio del falco&quot; (2013). For &quot;Canone inverso&quot; (2000) based on the music-themed novel of the same name by the Paolo Maurensig, directed by Ricky Tognazzi and starring Hans Matheson, Morricone won Best Score awards in the David di Donatello Awards and Silver Ribbons.

In the 2000s, Morricone continued to compose music for successful television series such as &quot;Il Cuore nel Pozzo&quot; (2005), &quot;&quot; (2005), &quot;La provinciale&quot; (2006), &quot;Giovanni Falcone&quot; (2007), &quot;Pane e libertà&quot; (2009) and &quot;Come Un Delfino 1–2&quot; (2011–2013).

Morricone provided the string arrangements on Morrissey&#x27;s &quot;Dear God Please Help Me&quot; from the album &quot;Ringleader of the Tormentors&quot; in 2006.
In 2008, the composer recorded music for a Lancia commercial, featuring Richard Gere and directed by Harald Zwart (known for directing &quot;The Pink Panther 2&quot;).

In spring and summer 2010, Morricone worked with Hayley Westenra for a collaboration on her album &quot;Paradiso&quot;. The album features new songs written by Morricone, as well as some of his best-known film compositions of the last 50 years. Westenra recorded the album with Morricone&#x27;s orchestra in Rome during the summer of 2010.

Since 1995, he composed the music for several advertising campaigns of Dolce &amp; Gabbana. The commercials were directed by Giuseppe Tornatore.

In 2013, Morricone collaborated with Italian singer-songwriter Laura Pausini on a new version of her hit single &quot;La solitudine&quot; for her 20 years anniversary greatest hits album &quot;20 – The Greatest Hits&quot;.

Morricone composed the music for &quot;The Best Offer&quot; (2013) by Giuseppe Tornatore.
He wrote the score for Christian Carion&#x27;s &quot;En mai, fais ce qu&#x27;il te plait&quot; (2015) and the most recent movie by Tornatore: &quot;The Correspondence&quot; (2016), featuring Jeremy Irons and Olga Kurylenko. In July 2015, Quentin Tarantino announced after the screening of footage of his movie &quot;The Hateful Eight&quot; at San Diego Comic-Con that Morricone would score the film, the first Western that Morricone scored since 1981. The score was critically acclaimed and won several awards including the Golden Globe Award for Best Original Score and the Academy Award for Best Original Score.

In June 2015, Morricone premiered his &quot;Missa Papae Francisci (Mass for Pope Francis)&quot; at Rome&#x27;s Chiesa del Gesù with the Orchestra Roma Sinfonietta and choruses from the Accademia Santa Cecilia and the Rome Opera Theater.

== Live performances ==
Before receiving his diplomas in trumpet, composition and instrumentation from the conservatory, Morricone was already active as a trumpet player, often performing in an orchestra that specialised in music written for films. After completing his education at Saint Cecilia, the composer honed his orchestration skills as an arranger for Italian radio and television. In order to support himself, he moved to RCA in the early sixties and entered the front ranks of the Italian recording industry. Since 1964, Morricone was also a founding member of the Rome-based avant-garde ensemble Gruppo di Improvvisazione Nuova Consonanza. During the existence of the group (until 1978), Morricone performed several times with the group as trumpet player.

To ready his music for live performance, he joined smaller pieces of music together into longer suites. Rather than single pieces, which would require the audience to applaud every few minutes, Morricone thought the best idea was to create a series of suites lasting from 15 to 20 minutes, which form a sort of symphony in various movements – alternating successful pieces with personal favourites. In concert, Morricone normally had 180 to 200 musicians and vocalists under his baton, performing multiple genre-crossing collections of music. Rock, symphonic and traditional indigenous instruments share the stage.

On 20 September 1984 Morricone conducted the Orchestre national des Pays de la Loire at &quot;Cinésymphonie &#x27;84&quot; (&quot;Première nuit de la musique de film/First night of film music&quot;) in the French concert hall Salle Pleyel in Paris. He performed some of his best-known compositions such as &quot;Metti una sera a cena&quot;, &quot;Novecento&quot; and &quot;The Good, the Bad and the Ugly&quot;. Michel Legrand and Georges Delerue performed on the same evening.

On 15 October 1987 Morricone gave a concert in front of 12,000 people in the Sportpaleis in Antwerp, Belgium, with the Dutch Metropole Orchestra and the Italian operatic soprano Alide Maria Salvetta. A live-album with a recording of this concert was released in the same year.

On 9 June 2000 Morricone went to the Flanders International Film Festival Ghent to conduct his music together with the National Orchestra of Belgium. During the concert&#x27;s first part, the screening of &quot;The Life and Death of King Richard III&quot; (1912) was accompanied with live music by Morricone. It was the very first time that the score was performed live in Europe. The second part of the evening consisted of an anthology of the composer&#x27;s work. The event took place on the eve of Euro 2000, the European Football Championship in Belgium and the Netherlands.

Morricone performed over 250 concerts as of 2001. The composer started a world tour in 2001, the latter part sponsored by Giorgio Armani, with the Orchestra Roma Sinfonietta, touring London (Barbican 2001; 75th birthday &quot;Concerto&quot;, Royal Albert Hall 2003 with singer Dulce Pontes), Paris, Verona, and Tokyo. Morricone performed his classic film scores at the Gasteig in Munich in 2004.
He made his North American concert debut on 3 February 2007 at Radio City Music Hall in New York City. The previous evening, Morricone had already presented at the United Nations a concert comprising some of his film themes, as well as the cantata &quot;Voci dal silenzio&quot; to welcome the new Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon. A &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; review bemoaned the poor acoustics and opined of Morricone: &quot;His stick technique is adequate, but his charisma as a conductor is zero.&quot;

On 26 February 2012 Morricone made his Australian concert debut when he conducted the Western Australian Youth Orchestra together with a 100 voice chorus (made up primarily of West Australian Symphony Orchestra chorus members) at the Burswood Theatre (part of Crown Perth in Perth. On 2 March 2012 he conducted the Adelaide Symphony Orchestra at Elder Park, Adelaide, as part of the Adelaide Festival of Arts.

On 22 December 2012 Morricone conducted the 85-piece Belgian orchestra &quot;Orkest der Lage Landen&quot; and a 100-piece choir during a two-hour concert in the Sportpaleis in Antwerp.

In November 2013 Morricone began a world tour to coincide with the 50th anniversary of his film music career and performed in locations such as the Crocus City Hall in Moscow, Santiago, Chile, Berlin, Germany (O2 World, Germany), Budapest, Hungary, and Vienna (Stadthalle). Back in June 2014, Morricone had to cancel a US tour in New York (Barclays Center) and Los Angeles (Nokia Theatre LA Live) due to a back procedure on 20 February. Morricone postponed the rest of his world tour.

In November 2014 Morricone stated that he would resume his European tour starting from February 2015 along with Dulce Pontes.

==Personal life==
On 13 October 1956, Morricone married Maria Travia (born 31 December 1932), whom he had met in 1950. Travia wrote lyrics to complement her husband&#x27;s pieces. Her works include the Latin texts for &quot;The Mission&quot;. Together, they had four children: Marco (b. 1957), Alessandra (b. 1961), conductor and film composer Andrea (b. 1964) and Giovanni (b. 1966), a filmmaker who lives in New York City. They remained married for 63 years until his death.

Morricone lived in Italy his entire life and never desired to live in Hollywood. He described himself as a Christian leftist, stating that he voted for the Christian Democracy (DC) for more than 40 years and then, after its dissolution in 1994, he approached the centre-left coalition, becoming also a founding member of the Democratic Party (PD) in 2007.

Morricone loved chess, having learned the game when he was 11. Before his musical career took off, he played in club tournaments in Rome in the mid-1950s. His first official tournament was in 1964, where he won a prize in the third category for amateurs. He was even coached by 12-time Italian champion IM Stefano Tatai for a while. Soon he got too busy for chess, but he would always keep a keen interest in the game and estimated his peak Elo rating to be nearly 1700. Over the years, Morricone played chess with many big names including GMs Garry Kasparov, Anatoly Karpov, Judit Polgar, and Peter Leko. He once held GM Boris Spassky to a draw in a simultaneous competition with 27 players, where Morricone was the last one standing.

On 6 July 2020, Morricone died at the Università Campus Bio-Medico in Rome, aged 91, as a result of injuries sustained to his femur during a fall. Following a private funeral in the hospital&#x27;s chapel, he was entombed in Cimitero Laurentino.

== Influence ==

Ennio Morricone influenced many artists from other styles and genres, including Danger Mouse, Dire Straits, Muse, Metallica, Radiohead and Hans Zimmer.
* Morricone&#x27;s influence extends into the realm of pop music. Hugo Montenegro had a hit with a version of the main theme from &quot;The Good, the Bad and the Ugly&quot; in both the United Kingdom and the United States. This was followed by his album of Morricone&#x27;s music in 1968.
* Morricone&#x27;s film music was also recorded by many artists. John Zorn recorded an album of Morricone&#x27;s music, &quot;The Big Gundown&quot;, with Keith Rosenberg in the mid-1980s.
* Morricone&#x27;s &quot;Sergio Leone Suite&quot; of haunting melodies from the scores he composed for several of the films by Leone, and performed by Morricone, Roma Sinfonietta Orchestra, and Yo-Yo Ma on cello, was recorded by CBS/Sony (93456) and is featured on Classical radio stations such as WSMR, a Sarasota, Florida, radio station.

The album &quot;Yo-Yo Ma Plays Ennio Morricone&quot; sold more than 130,000 copies in 2004.
* Metallica has used Morricone&#x27;s &quot;The Ecstasy of Gold&quot; as an intro at their concerts since 1983 (shock jocks &quot;Opie and Anthony&quot; also used the song at the start of their XM Satellite Radio and CBS Radio shows.) The San Francisco Symphony Orchestra also played it on Metallica&#x27;s live albums &quot;S&amp;M&quot; and &quot;S&amp;M2&quot;. The theme from &quot;A Fistful of Dollars&quot; is also used as a concert intro by The Mars Volta.
* Morricone inspired the namesake of Morricone Youth, a New York band dedicated to playing music from film and television, founded by musician and radio host Devon E. Levins in 1999. In addition to composers like Lalo Schifrin and Jerry Goldsmith, the band has performed music from a large spectrum of Morricone&#x27;s film career, ranging from his work in the spaghetti westerns to The Exorcist II, as well as original Morricone-inspired pieces.
* The Spaghetti Western Orchestra is an Australian tribute band that started in 2004.
* Radiohead drew inspiration from the recording style of Morricone for their 1997 album &quot;OK Computer&quot;.
* Singer and composer Mike Patton was heavily influenced by Morricone&#x27;s more experimental oeuvre and in 2005 he commissioned a compilation album, &quot;Crime and Dissonance&quot;, of the lesser-known soundtracks by &quot;E Maestro&quot; that was released on his own Ipecac Recordings label.
* Gnarls Barkley&#x27;s hit single &quot;Crazy&quot; (2006) was musically inspired by Morricone.

The band went on to perform the song &quot;Man with a Harmonica&quot; live played by Chris Wolstenholme, as an intro to &quot;Knights of Cydonia&quot;.
* In 2007, the tribute album &quot;We All Love Ennio Morricone&quot; was released, featuring performances by various artists, including Sarah Brightman, Andrea Bocelli, Celine Dion, Bruce Springsteen and Metallica.
* Alex Turner has noted Morricone&#x27;s influence on his writing, in particular on The Last Shadow Puppets album &quot;The Age of the Understatement&quot; of 2008. &quot;505&quot; samples &quot;The Good, the Bad and the Ugly&quot;.
* &quot;Lovers on the Sun&quot;, a song released in 2014 by French music producer David Guetta, is influenced by Morricone&#x27;s western scores.
* The Prodigy repurposed Morricone&#x27;s score from 1966&#x27;s &quot;La resa dei conti&quot; (Seconda Caccia) for &quot;The Big Gundown&quot; on 2009&#x27;s &quot;Invaders Must Die&quot;.
* Anna Calvi has cited Morricone as an influence.
* Sea Girls&#x27; song &quot;Lonely&quot; was written on the day of Morricone&#x27;s death and is influenced by his music, particularly on the film &quot;The Good, the Bad and the Ugly&quot;. It was released as a single in February 2022.
* Sabaton, known for their history based music, based their song on &quot;Audie Murphy (To Hell and Back)&quot; partly on Morricone&#x27;s style, according to the band&#x27;s singer.

==Awards and honors ==
Morricone received his first Academy Award nomination in 1979 for the score to &quot;Days of Heaven&quot; (Terrence Malick, 1978). He received his second Oscar nomination for &quot;The Mission&quot;. He also received Oscar nominations for his scores to &quot;The Untouchables&quot; (1987), &quot;Bugsy&quot; (1991), &quot;Malèna&quot; (2000), and &quot;The Hateful Eight&quot; (2016). In February 2016, Morricone won his first competitive Academy Award for his score to &quot;The Hateful Eight&quot;. Morricone and Alex North are the only composers to receive the Academy Honorary Award since its introduction in 1928. He received the award in February 2007, &quot;for his magnificent and multifaceted contributions to the art of film music.&quot;

In 2005, four film scores by Ennio Morricone were nominated by the American Film Institute for an honoured place in the AFI&#x27;s Top 25 of Best American Film Scores of All Time. His score for &quot;The Mission&quot; was ranked 23rd in the Top 25 list. Morricone was nominated seven times for a Grammy Award. In 2009 The Recording Academy inducted his score for &quot;The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly&quot; (1966) into the Grammy Hall of Fame. In 2010 Ennio Morricone and Icelandic singer Björk won the Polar Music Prize. The Polar Music Prize is Sweden&#x27;s biggest music award and is typically shared by a pop artist and a classical musician. It was founded by Stig Anderson, manager of Swedish pop group ABBA, in 1989. A &quot;Variety&quot; poll of 40 top current film composers selected &quot;The Mission&quot; as the greatest film score of all time.

In 1971, he received a &quot;Targa d&#x27;Oro&quot; for worldwide sales of 22 million, and by 2016 Morricone had sold more than 70 million records worldwide. In 2007, he received the Academy Honorary Award &quot;for his magnificent and multifaceted contributions to the art of film music&quot;. He was nominated for a further six Oscars, and in 2016, received his only competitive Academy Award for his score to Quentin Tarantino&#x27;s film &quot;The Hateful Eight&quot;, at the time becoming the oldest person ever to win a competitive Oscar. His other achievements include three Grammy Awards, three Golden Globes, six BAFTAs, ten David di Donatello, eleven , two European Film Awards, the Golden Lion Honorary Award, and the Polar Music Prize in 2010. The soundtrack for &quot;The Mission&quot; (1986) was certified gold in the United States. The album &quot;Yo-Yo Ma Plays Ennio Morricone&quot; stayed for 105 weeks on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Classical Albums.

<doc id="10283" wikidata="Q225888" url="?curid=10283" title="Erlang (unit)">
<text>The erlang (symbol E) is a dimensionless unit that is used in telephony as a measure of offered load or carried load on service-providing elements such as telephone circuits or telephone switching equipment. A single cord circuit has the capacity to be used for 60 minutes in one hour. Full utilization of that capacity, 60 minutes of traffic, constitutes 1 erlang.

Carried traffic in erlangs is the average number of concurrent calls measured over a given period (often one hour), while offered traffic is the traffic that would be carried if all call-attempts succeeded. How much offered traffic is carried in practice will depend on what happens to unanswered calls when all servers are busy.

The CCITT named the international unit of telephone traffic the erlang in 1946 in honor of Agner Krarup Erlang. In Erlang&#x27;s analysis of efficient telephone line usage, he derived the formulae for two important cases, Erlang-B and Erlang-C, which became foundational results in teletraffic engineering and queueing theory. His results, which are still used today, relate quality of service to the number of available servers. Both formulae take offered load as one of their main inputs (in erlangs), which is often expressed as call arrival rate times average call length.

A distinguishing assumption behind the Erlang B formula is that there is no queue, so that if all service elements are already in use then a newly arriving call will be blocked and subsequently lost. The formula gives the probability of this occurring. In contrast, the Erlang C formula provides for the possibility of an unlimited queue and it gives the probability that a new call will need to wait in the queue due to all servers being in use. Erlang&#x27;s formulae apply quite widely, but they may fail when congestion is especially high causing unsuccessful traffic to repeatedly retry. One way of accounting for retries when no queue is available is the Extended Erlang B method.

== Traffic measurements of a telephone circuit ==
When used to represent carried traffic, a value (which can be a non-integer such as 43.5) followed by &quot;erlangs&quot; represents the average number of concurrent calls carried by the circuits (or other service-providing elements), where that average is calculated over some reasonable period of time. The period over which the average is calculated is often one hour, but shorter periods (e.g., 15 minutes) may be used where it is known that there are short spurts of demand and a traffic measurement is desired that does not mask these spurts.
One erlang of carried traffic refers to a single resource being in continuous use, or two channels each being in use fifty percent of the time, and so on. For example, if an office has two telephone operators who are both busy all the time, that would represent two erlangs (2 E) of traffic; or a radio channel that is occupied continuously during the period of interest (e.g. one hour) is said to have a load of 1 erlang.

When used to describe offered traffic, a value followed by &quot;erlangs&quot; represents the average number of concurrent calls that would have been carried if there were an unlimited number of circuits (that is, if the call-attempts that were made when all circuits were in use had not been rejected). The relationship between offered traffic and carried traffic depends on the design of the system and user behavior. Three common models are (a) callers whose call-attempts are rejected go away and never come back, (b) callers whose call-attempts are rejected try again within a fairly short space of time, and (c) the system allows users to wait in queue until a circuit becomes available.

A third measurement of traffic is instantaneous traffic, expressed as a certain number of erlangs, meaning the exact number of calls taking place at a point in time. In this case, the number is a non-negative integer. Traffic-level-recording devices, such as moving-pen recorders, plot instantaneous traffic.

== Erlang&#x27;s analysis ==

The concepts and mathematics introduced by Agner Krarup Erlang have broad applicability beyond telephony. They apply wherever users arrive more or less at random to receive exclusive service from any one of a group of service-providing elements without prior reservation, for example, where the service-providing elements are ticket-sales windows, toilets on an airplane, or motel rooms. (Erlang&#x27;s models do not apply where the service-providing elements are shared between several concurrent users or different amounts of service are consumed by different users, for instance, on circuits carrying data traffic.)

The goal of Erlang&#x27;s traffic theory is to determine exactly how many service-providing elements should be provided in order to satisfy users, without wasteful over-provisioning. To do this, a target is set for the grade of service (GoS) or quality of service (QoS). For example, in a system where there is no queuing, the GoS may be that no more than 1 call in 100 is blocked (i.e., rejected) due to all circuits being in use (a GoS of 0.01), which becomes the target probability of call blocking, &quot;P&quot;b, when using the Erlang B formula.

There are several resulting formulae, including Erlang B, Erlang C and the related Engset formula, based on different models of user behavior and system operation. These may each be derived by means of a special case of continuous-time Markov processes known as a birth–death process. The more recent Extended Erlang B method provides a further traffic solution that draws on Erlang&#x27;s results.

== Calculating offered traffic ==

Offered traffic (in erlangs) is related to the call arrival rate, &quot;λ&quot;, and the average call-holding time (the average time of a phone call), &quot;h&quot;, by:
: formula_1
provided that &quot;h&quot; and &quot;λ&quot; are expressed using the same units of time (seconds and calls per second, or minutes and calls per minute).

The practical measurement of traffic is typically based on continuous observations over several days or weeks, during which the instantaneous traffic is recorded at regular, short intervals (such as every few seconds). These measurements are then used to calculate a single result, most commonly the busy-hour traffic (in erlangs). This is the average number of concurrent calls during a given one-hour period of the day, where that period is selected to give the highest result. (This result is called the time-consistent busy-hour traffic). An alternative is to calculate a busy-hour traffic value separately for each day (which may correspond to slightly different times each day) and take the average of these values. This generally gives a slightly higher value than the time-consistent busy-hour value.

Where the existing busy-hour carried traffic, &quot;E&quot;c, is measured on an already overloaded system, with a significant level of blocking, it is necessary to take account of the blocked calls in estimating the busy-hour offered traffic &quot;E&quot;o (which is the traffic value to be used in the Erlang formulae). The offered traffic can be estimated by . For this purpose, where the system includes a means of counting blocked calls and successful calls, &quot;P&quot;b can be estimated directly from the proportion of calls that are blocked. Failing that, &quot;P&quot;b can be estimated by using &quot;E&quot;c in place of &quot;E&quot;o in the Erlang formula and the resulting estimate of &quot;P&quot;b can then be used in to provide a first estimate of &quot;E&quot;o.

Another method of estimating &quot;E&quot;o in an overloaded system is to measure the busy-hour call arrival rate, &quot;λ&quot; (counting successful calls and blocked calls), and the average call-holding time (for successful calls), &quot;h&quot;, and then estimate &quot;E&quot;o using the formula .

For a situation where the traffic to be handled is completely new traffic, the only choice is to try to model expected user behavior. For example, one could estimate active user population, &quot;N&quot;, expected level of use, &quot;U&quot; (number of calls/transactions per user per day), busy-hour concentration factor, &quot;C&quot; (proportion of daily activity that will fall in the busy hour), and average holding time/service time, &quot;h&quot; (expressed in minutes). A projection of busy-hour offered traffic would then be . (The division by 60 translates the busy-hour call/transaction arrival rate into a per-minute value, to match the units in which &quot;h&quot; is expressed.)

== Erlang B formula ==
The Erlang B formula (or Erlang-B with a hyphen), also known as the Erlang loss formula, is a formula for the blocking probability that describes the probability of call losses for a group of identical parallel resources (telephone lines, circuits, traffic channels, or equivalent), sometimes referred to as an M/M/c/c queue. It is, for example, used to dimension a telephone network&#x27;s links. The formula was derived by Agner Krarup Erlang and is not limited to telephone networks, since it describes a probability in a queuing system (albeit a special case with a number of servers but no queueing space for incoming calls to wait for a free server). Hence, the formula is also used in certain inventory systems with lost sales.

The formula applies under the condition that an unsuccessful call, because the line is busy, is not queued or retried, but instead really vanishes forever. It is assumed that call attempts arrive following a Poisson process, so call arrival instants are independent. Further, it is assumed that the message lengths (holding times) are exponentially distributed (Markovian system), although the formula turns out to apply under general holding time distributions.

The Erlang B formula assumes an infinite population of sources (such as telephone subscribers), which jointly offer traffic to &quot;N&quot; servers (such as telephone lines). The rate expressing the frequency at which new calls arrive, λ, (birth rate, traffic intensity, etc.) is constant, and does &quot;not&quot; depend on the number of active sources. The total number of sources is assumed to be infinite.
The Erlang B formula calculates the blocking probability of a buffer-less loss system, where a request that is not served immediately is aborted, causing that no requests become queued. Blocking occurs when a new request arrives at a time where all available servers are currently busy. The formula also assumes that blocked traffic is cleared and does not return.

The formula provides the GoS (grade of service) which is the probability &quot;P&quot;b that a new call arriving to the resources group is rejected because all resources (servers, lines, circuits) are busy: where &quot;E&quot; is the total offered traffic in erlang, offered to &quot;m&quot; identical parallel resources (servers, communication channels, traffic lanes).
: formula_2
where:
* &quot;P&quot;b is the probability of blocking
* &quot;m&quot; is the number of identical parallel resources such as servers, telephone lines, etc.
* &quot;E&quot; = &quot;λh&quot; is the normalised ingress load (offered traffic stated in erlang).

Note: The &quot;erlang&quot; is a dimensionless load unit calculated as the mean arrival rate, &quot;λ&quot;, multiplied by the mean call holding time, &quot;h&quot;.
See Little&#x27;s law to prove that the erlang unit has to be dimensionless for Little&#x27;s Law to be dimensionally sane.

This may be expressed recursively as follows, in a form that is used to simplify the calculation of tables of the Erlang B formula:
: formula_3
: formula_4

Typically, instead of &quot;B&quot;(&quot;E&quot;, &quot;m&quot;) the inverse 1/&quot;B&quot;(&quot;E&quot;, &quot;m&quot;) is calculated in numerical computation in order to ensure numerical stability:
: formula_5
: formula_6
The recursive form is derivable from the non-recursive form by repeated substitution.
Function ErlangB (E As Double, m As Integer) As Double
 Dim InvB As Double
 Dim j As Integer

 InvB = 1.0
 For j = 1 To m
 InvB = 1.0 + InvB * j / E
 Next j
 ErlangB = 1.0 / InvB
End Function

or a Python version

def erlang_b(E, m: int) -&gt; float:
 &quot;&quot;&quot;Calculate the probability of call losses.&quot;&quot;&quot;
 inv_b = 1.0
 for j in range(1, m + 1):
 inv_b = 1.0 + inv_b * j / E
 return 1.0 / inv_b
The Erlang B formula is decreasing and convex in &quot;m&quot;.
It requires that call arrivals can be modeled by a Poisson process, which is not always a good match, but is valid for any statistical distribution of call holding times with a finite mean.
It applies to traffic transmission systems that do not buffer traffic.
More modern examples compared to POTS where Erlang B is still applicable, are optical burst switching (OBS) and several current approaches to optical packet switching (OPS).
Erlang B was developed as a trunk sizing tool for telephone networks with holding times in the minutes range, but being a mathematical equation it applies on any time-scale.

== Extended Erlang B ==
Extended Erlang B differs from the classic Erlang-B assumptions by allowing for a proportion of blocked callers to try again, causing an increase in offered traffic from the initial baseline level. It is an iterative calculation rather than a formula and adds an extra parameter, the recall factor formula_7, which defines the recall attempts.

The steps in the process are as follows. It starts at iteration formula_8 with a known initial baseline level of traffic formula_9, which is successively adjusted to calculate a sequence of new offered traffic values formula_10, each of which accounts for the recalls arising from the previously calculated offered traffic formula_11.
# Calculate the probability of a caller being blocked on their first attempt formula_12 as above for Erlang B.
# Calculate the probable number of blocked calls formula_13
# Calculate the number of recalls, formula_14, assuming a fixed recall factor, formula_7, formula_16
# Calculate the new offered traffic formula_17 where formula_9 is the initial (baseline) level of traffic.
# Return to step 1, substituting formula_10 for formula_11, and iterate until a stable value of formula_21 is obtained.

Once a satisfactory value of formula_21 has been found, the blocking probability formula_23 and the recall factor can be used to calculate the probability that all of a caller&#x27;s attempts are lost, not just their first call but also any subsequent retries.

== Erlang C formula ==
The Erlang C formula expresses the probability that an arriving customer will need to queue (as opposed to immediately being served). Just as the Erlang B formula, Erlang C assumes an infinite population of sources, which jointly offer traffic of formula_21 erlangs to formula_25 servers. However, if all the servers are busy when a request arrives from a source, the request is queued. An unlimited number of requests may be held in the queue in this way simultaneously. This formula calculates the probability of queuing offered traffic, assuming that blocked calls stay in the system until they can be handled. This formula is used to determine the number of agents or customer service representatives needed to staff a call centre, for a specified desired probability of queuing. However, the Erlang C formula assumes that callers never hang up while in queue, which makes the formula predict that more agents should be used than are really needed to maintain a desired service level.
: formula_26
where:
* formula_21 is the total traffic offered in units of erlangs
* formula_25 is the number of servers
* formula_29 is the probability that a customer has to wait for service.

It is assumed that the call arrivals can be modeled by a Poisson process and that call holding times are described by an exponential distribution, therefore the Erlang C formula follows from the assumptions of the M/M/c queue model.

== Limitations of the Erlang formula ==

When Erlang developed the Erlang-B and Erlang-C traffic equations, they were developed on a set of assumptions. These assumptions are accurate under most conditions; however in the event of extremely high traffic congestion, Erlang&#x27;s equations fail to accurately predict the correct number of circuits required because of re-entrant traffic. This is termed a high-loss system, where congestion breeds further congestion at peak times. In such cases, it is first necessary for many additional circuits to be made available so that the high loss can be alleviated. Once this action has been taken, congestion will return to reasonable levels and Erlang&#x27;s equations can then be used to determine how exactly many circuits are really required.

An example of an instance which would cause such a High Loss System to develop would be if a TV-based advertisement were to announce a particular telephone number to call at a specific time. In this case, a large number of people would simultaneously phone the number provided. If the service provider had not catered for this sudden peak demand, extreme traffic congestion will develop and Erlang&#x27;s equations cannot be used.

<doc id="10285" wikidata="Q5360816" url="?curid=10285" title="Eligible receiver">
<text>In gridiron football, not all players on offense are entitled to receive a forward pass: only an eligible pass receiver may legally catch a forward pass, and only an eligible receiver may advance beyond the neutral zone if a forward pass crosses into the neutral zone. If the pass is received by a non-eligible receiver, it is &quot;illegal touching&quot; (resulting in a penalty of five yards and loss of down). If an ineligible receiver is beyond the neutral zone when a forward pass crossing the neutral zone is thrown, a foul of &quot;ineligible receiver downfield&quot; (resulting in a penalty of five yards, but no loss of down) is called. Each league has slightly different rules regarding who is considered an eligible receiver.

==College football==
The NCAA rulebook defines eligible receivers for college football in Rule 7, Section 3, Article 3. The determining factors are the player&#x27;s position on the field at the snap and their jersey number. Specifically, any players on offense wearing numbers between 50 and 79 are always ineligible. All defensive players are eligible receivers and offensive players who are not wearing an ineligible number are eligible receivers if they meet one of the following three criteria:
* Player is at either end of the group of players on the line of scrimmage (wide receivers and tight ends)
* Player is lined up at least one yard behind the line of scrimmage (running backs, fullbacks, slot receivers, etc.)
* Player is positioned to receive a hand-to-hand snap from the center (almost always the quarterback)

Players may only wear eligible numbers at an ineligible position when it is obvious that a punt or field goal is to be attempted.

If a player is to change between eligible and ineligible positions, they must physically change jersey numbers to reflect the position.

A receiver loses his eligibility by leaving the field of play unless he was forced out by a defensive player and immediately attempts to get back inbounds (Rule 7–3–4). All players on the field become eligible as soon as the ball is touched by a defensive player or an official during play (Rule 7–3–5).

==Professional football==
In both American and Canadian professional football, every player on the defensive team is considered eligible. The offensive team must have at least seven players lined up on the line of scrimmage. Of the players on the line of scrimmage, only the two players on the ends of the line of scrimmage are eligible receivers. The remaining players are in the backfield (four in American football, five in Canadian football), including the quarterback. These backfield players are also eligible receivers. In the National Football League (NFL), a quarterback who takes his stance behind center as a T-formation quarterback is not eligible unless, before the ball is snapped, he legally moves to a position at least one yard behind the line of scrimmage or on the end of the line, and is stationary in that position for at least one second before the snap, but is nonetheless not counted toward the seven men required on the line of scrimmage.

If, for example, eight men line up on the line of scrimmage, the team loses an eligible receiver. This can often happen when a flanker or slot receiver, who is supposed to line up behind the line of scrimmage, instead lines up on the line of scrimmage between the offensive line and a split end. In most cases where a pass is caught by an ineligible receiver, it is usually because the quarterback was under pressure and threw it to an offensive lineman out of desperation.

Eligible receivers must wear certain uniform numbers, so that the officials can more easily distinguish between eligible and ineligible receivers. In the NFL, running backs, wide receivers, and tight ends must wear numbers 0 to 49 and 80 to 89. Numbers 50 to 79 are reserved for linemen and are always ineligible on offense unless they report as eligible. In the CFL ineligible receivers must wear numbers 50 to 69; all other numbers (including 0 and 00) may be worn by eligible receivers. A player who is not wearing a number that corresponds to an eligible receiver is ineligible even if he lines up in an eligible position. However, a player who reports to the referee that he intends to be eligible in the following play is allowed to line up and act as an eligible receiver. An example of this was a 1985 NFL game in which William Perry, wearing number 72 and normally a defensive lineman, was made an eligible receiver on an offensive play, and successfully caught a touchdown pass attempt. A more recent example, and more commonly used, has been former New England Patriots linebacker Mike Vrabel lining up as a tight end in goal line situations. In the 2018 season, George Fant has also lined up in the tight end position for the Seattle Seahawks due to injuries to the starting tight ends Ed Dickson and Will Dissly. In the 2019 season the Atlanta Falcons declared right tackle Ty Sambrailo eligible on many plays before throwing the ball to him for a 35-yard touchdown against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.

Before the snap of the ball, in the American game, backfield players may only move parallel to the line of scrimmage, only one back may be in motion at any given time, and if forward motion has occurred, the back must be still for a full second before the snap. The receiver may be in motion laterally or away from the line of scrimmage at the snap. A breach of this rule results in a penalty for illegal procedure (five yards). However, in the Canadian game, eligible receivers may move in any direction before the snap, any number may be in motion at any one time, and there is no need to be motionless before the snap.

The rules on eligible receivers only apply to forward passes. Any player may legally catch a backwards or lateral pass.

In the American game, once the play has started, eligible receivers can become ineligible depending on how the play develops. Any eligible receiver that goes out of bounds is no longer an eligible receiver and cannot receive a forward pass, unless that player re-establishes by taking three steps in bounds. Also, if a pass is touched by any defensive player or eligible offensive receiver (tipped by a defensive lineman, slips through a receiver&#x27;s hands, etc.), every offensive player immediately becomes eligible. In the CFL all players become eligible receivers if a pass is touched by a member of the defensive team. A proposed rule change in the XFL would make all players behind the line of scrimmage eligible receivers, regardless of position or number.

==High school==
In high school football, the rules of eligibility are roughly the same as in the college game. However, as of February 2009, at least five players must wear numbers between 50 and 79 on first, second, or third down, which by rule would make them ineligible receivers. This was because of a change in the definition of a scrimmage-kick formation made by the National Federation of State High School Associations (NFHS). The change was intended to close a loophole in the rules which allowed teams to run an A-11 offense, in which a team would be exempted from eligibility numbering restrictions if the player receiving the snap was at least seven yards behind the line of scrimmage.

In 2019, the NFHS changed the rules slightly, instead measuring the number of players behind the line of scrimmage, limiting that number to four. The minimum number of players on the offensive line was reduced from seven to five.

<text>Enver Halil Hoxha (; ; 16 October 190811 April 1985) was an Albanian communist revolutionary and politician who was the leader of Albania from 1944 until his death in 1985. He was the First Secretary of the Party of Labour of Albania from 1941 until his death, a member of its Politburo, chairman of the Democratic Front of Albania, and commander-in-chief of the Albanian People&#x27;s Army. He was the twenty-second prime minister of Albania from 1944 to 1954 and at various times was both foreign minister and defence minister of the country.

Hoxha was born in Gjirokastër near Greece in 1908. He was a grammar school teacher in 1936. After the Italian invasion of Albania, he joined the Party of Labour of Albania at its creation in 1941 in the Soviet Union. He was elected First Secretary in March 1943 at the age of 34. Less than two years after the liberation of the country, the monarchy of King Zog I was formally abolished, and Hoxha became the country&#x27;s &quot;de facto&quot; head of state.

Adopting Stalinism, Hoxha converted Albania into a one-party communist state. As a Stalinist, he implemented state atheism and ordered anti-religious persecution of Muslims and Christians. Implementing his radical program, Hoxha used totalitarian methods of governance. His government outlawed traveling abroad and it also outlawed private proprietorship. The government imprisoned, executed, or exiled thousands of landowners, rural clan leaders, peasants who resisted collectivization, and allegedly disloyal party officials. Hoxha was succeeded by Ramiz Alia, who was in charge during the fall of communism in Albania.

Hoxha&#x27;s government was characterised by his proclaimed firm adherence to anti-revisionist Marxism–Leninism from the mid/late-1960s onwards. After his break with Maoism in the 1976–1978 period, numerous Maoist parties around the world declared themselves Hoxhaist. The International Conference of Marxist–Leninist Parties and Organisations (Unity &amp; Struggle) is the best-known association of these parties.

==Early life==

Hoxha was born in Gjirokastër in southern Albania (then a part of the Ottoman Empire) in October 1908, the son of Halil Hoxha, a Muslim cloth merchant who travelled widely across Europe and the United States, and Gjylihan Hoxha (&quot;née&quot; Çuçi). Enver was named after Enver Pasha, a leading figure of the Young Turk Revolution. The Hoxha family was attached to the Bektashi Order.

After elementary school, Enver followed his studies in the city senior high school &quot;Liria&quot;. He started his studies at the Gjirokastër Lyceum in 1923. After the lyceum was closed, due to intervention of Ekrem Libohova, Enver Hoxha was awarded a state scholarship for the continuation of his studies in Korçë, at the French language Albanian National Lyceum until 1930.
In 1930, Hoxha went to study at the University of Montpellier in Montpellier, France on a state scholarship for the faculty of natural science, but lost the scholarship for neglecting his studies. He later went to Paris, where he presented himself to anti-Zogist immigrants as the brother-in-law of Bahri Omari. From 1935 to 1936, he was employed as a secretary at the Albanian consulate in Brussels. After returning to Albania, he worked as a contract teacher in the Gymnasium of Tirana (a school). Hoxha taught French and morals in the Korça Liceum from 1937 to 1939 and also was the caretaker of the school library.

On 7 April 1939, the Albanian Kingdom was invaded by fascist Italy. The Italians established a puppet government, called the Kingdom of Albania, under Shefqet Vërlaci. At the end of 1939, Hoxha was transferred to the Gjirokastra Gymnasium, but he soon returned to Tirana. He was helped by his best friend, Esat Dishnica, who introduced Hoxha to Dishnica&#x27;s cousin Ibrahim Biçakçiu. Hoxha began to sleep in Biçakçiu&#x27;s tobacco factory &quot;Flora&quot;, and after a while Dishnica opened a shop with the same name, where Hoxha began working. He was a sympathiser of Korça&#x27;s Communist Group.

==World War II==
On 8 November 1941, the Communist Party of Albania (later renamed the Party of Labour of Albania in 1948) was founded. Hoxha was chosen from the &quot;Korça group&quot; as a Muslim representative by the two Yugoslav envoys as one of the seven members of the provisional Central Committee. The First Consultative Meeting of Activists of the Communist Party of Albania was held in Tirana from 8 to 11 April 1942, with Hoxha himself delivering the main report on 8 April 1942.

In July 1942, Hoxha wrote &quot;Call to the Albanian Peasantry&quot;, issued in the name of the Communist Party of Albania. The call sought to enlist support in Albania for the war against the fascists. The peasants were encouraged to hoard their grain and refuse to pay taxes or livestock levies brought by the government. After the September 1942 Conference at Pezë, the National Liberation Movement was founded with the purpose of uniting the anti-fascist Albanians, regardless of ideology or class.

By March 1943, the first National Conference of the Communist Party elected Hoxha formally as First Secretary. During WWII, the Soviet Union&#x27;s role in Albania was negligible. On 10 July 1943, the Albanian partisans were organised in regular units of companies, battalions and brigades and named the Albanian National Liberation Army. The organization received military support from the British intelligence service, SOE.

Within Albania, repeated attempts were made during the war to remedy the communications difficulties which faced partisan groups. In August 1943, a secret meeting, the Mukje Conference, was held between the anti-communist Balli Kombëtar (National Front) and the Communist Party of Albania. To encourage the Balli Kombëtar to sign, the Greater Albania sections that included Kosovo (part of Yugoslavia) and Chamëria were made part of the Agreement.

=== Disagreement with the Yugoslav Communists ===
A problem developed when the Yugoslav Communists disagreed with the goal of establishing a Greater Albania and asked the Communists in Albania to withdraw their agreement. According to Hoxha, Josip Broz Tito did not believe that &quot;Kosovo was Albanian&quot; and Serbian opposition to the transfer made it an unwise option. After the Albanian Communists repudiated the Greater Albania agreement, the Balli Kombëtar condemned the Communists, who in turn accused the Balli Kombëtar of siding with the Italians. The Balli Kombëtar lacked support from the people. After judging the Communists as an immediate threat, the Balli Kombëtar sided with Nazi Germany, fatally damaging its image among those fighting the fascists. The Communists quickly added to their ranks many of those disillusioned with the Balli Kombëtar and took centre stage in the fight for liberation.

The Permet National Congress held during that time called for a &quot;new democratic Albania for the people&quot;. Although the monarchy was not formally abolished, King Zog I of the Albanians was barred from returning to the country, which further increased the Communists&#x27; control. The Anti-Fascist Committee for National Liberation was founded, chaired by Hoxha. On 22 October 1944, the Committee became the Democratic Government of Albania after a meeting in Berat and Hoxha was chosen to serve as the interim Prime Minister of Albania. Tribunals were established for the purpose of trying alleged war criminals who were also accused of being &quot;enemies of the people&quot; and they were presided over by Koçi Xoxe. From the beginning, the Democratic Government was an undisguised Communist regime. In the rest of what became the Soviet bloc, the Communist parties were at least nominally parts of coalitions before they dropped all pretenses of pluralism and established one-party states.

After Albania&#x27;s liberation on 29 November 1944, several Albanian partisan divisions crossed the border into German-occupied Yugoslavia, where they fought alongside Tito&#x27;s partisans and the Soviet Red Army in a joint campaign which succeeded in driving out the last pockets of German resistance. During a Yugoslavian conference in later years, Marshal Tito thanked Hoxha for the Albanian partisans&#x27; assistance during the War for National Liberation (&quot;Lufta Nacionalçlirimtare&quot;). The Democratic Front, dominated by the Albanian Communist Party, succeeded the National Liberation Front in August 1945, and the first post-war election was held on 2 December of that year. The Front was the only legal political organisation which was allowed to stand in the elections, and the government reported that 93% of Albanians voted for it.

On 11 January 1946, Zog was officially deposed and the People&#x27;s Republic of Albania was established (it was renamed the People&#x27;s Socialist Republic of Albania in 1976), despite the fact that the country had been a Communist state since its liberation. As First Secretary of the party, Hoxha was &quot;de facto&quot; head of state and as a result, he was the most powerful man in the country.

Albanians celebrate their independence day on 28 November (which is the date on which they declared their independence from the Ottoman Empire in 1912), while in the former People&#x27;s Socialist Republic of Albania the national day was 29 November, the day the country was liberated from Nazi Germany. Both days are currently national holidays.

== Early leadership (1944–1965) ==
Hoxha declared himself a Marxist–Leninist and strongly admired Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin. 
During the period of 1945–1950, the government adopted policies and actions intended to consolidate power which included extrajudicial killings and executions that targeted and eliminated anti-communists. The Agrarian Reform Law was passed in August 1945. It confiscated land from beys and large landowners, giving it without compensation to peasants. 52% of all land was owned by large landowners before the law was passed; this declined to 16% after the law&#x27;s passage. Illiteracy, which was 90–95% in rural areas in 1939 and perhaps 85% of the total population in 1946, fell to 30% by 1950, and by 1985 it was equal to that of a Western country.

===Border disputes with Yugoslavia===

In 1948, a border conflict erupted between Albania and Yugoslavia. Enver Hoxha and the Albanian Military Intelligence services, the Sigurimi, played a significant role in promoting separatism in Kosovo and the idea of a &quot;Greater Albania.&quot;

By 1949, the US and British intelligence organisations were working with the former King Zog and the mountain men of his personal guard. They recruited Albanian refugees and émigrés from Egypt, Italy and Greece, trained them in Cyprus, Malta and the Federal Republic of Germany (West Germany), and infiltrated them into Albania. Guerrilla units entered Albania in 1950 and 1952, but they were killed or captured by Albanian security forces. Kim Philby, a Soviet double agent working as a liaison officer between MI6 and the CIA, had leaked details of the infiltration plan to Moscow, and the security breach claimed the lives of about 300 infiltrators.

On 19 February 1951, a bombing occurred at the Soviet embassy in Tirana, after which 23 accused intellectuals were arrested and put in prison. One of them, Jonuz Kaceli, was killed by Mehmet Shehu during interrogation. Subsequently, the 22 others were executed without trial under Hoxha&#x27;s orders.

The State University of Tirana was established in 1957, which was the first of its kind in Albania. The medieval Gjakmarrja (blood feud) was banned. Malaria, the most widespread disease, was successfully fought through advances in health care, the use of DDT, and through the draining of swampland. From 1965 to 1985, no cases of malaria were reported, whereas previously Albania had the greatest number of infected patients in Europe. No cases of syphilis had been recorded for 30 years. In 1938 the number of physicians was 1.1 per 10,000 and there was only one hospital bed per 1,000 people. In 1950, while the number of physicians had not increased, there were four times as many hospital beds per head, and health expenditures had risen to 5% of the budget, up from 1% before the war.

=== Relations with Yugoslavia ===

At this point, relations with Yugoslavia had begun to change. The roots of the change began on 20 October 1944 at the Second Plenary Session of the Communist Party of Albania. The Session considered the problems that the post-independence Albanian government would face. However, the Yugoslav delegation which was led by Velimir Stoinić accused the party of &quot;sectarianism and opportunism&quot; and blamed Hoxha for these errors. He also stressed the view that the Yugoslav Communist partisans spearheaded the Albanian partisan movement.

Anti-Yugoslav members of the Albanian Communist Party had begun to think that this was a plot by Tito who intended to destabilize the Party. Koçi Xoxe, Sejfulla Malëshova and others who supported Yugoslavia were looked upon with deep suspicion. Tito&#x27;s position on Albania was that it was too weak to stand on its own and that it would do better as a part of Yugoslavia. Hoxha alleged that Tito had made it his goal to get Albania into Yugoslavia, firstly by creating the Treaty of Friendship, Co-operation and Mutual Aid in 1946. In time, Albania began to feel that the treaty was heavily slanted towards Yugoslav interests, much like the Italian agreements with Albania under Zog that made the nation dependent upon Italy.

The first issue was that the Albanian lek became revalued in terms of the Yugoslav dinar as a customs union was formed and Albania&#x27;s economic plan was decided more by Yugoslavia. Albanian economists H. Banja and V. Toçi stated that the relationship between Albania and Yugoslavia during this period was exploitative and that it constituted attempts by Yugoslavia to make the Albanian economy an &quot;appendage&quot; to the Yugoslav economy. Hoxha then began to accuse Yugoslavia of misconduct:

Stalin advised Hoxha that Yugoslavia was attempting to annex Albania: &quot;We did not know that the Yugoslavs, under the pretext of &#x27;defending&#x27; your country against an attack from the Greek fascists, wanted to bring units of their army into the PRA [People&#x27;s Republic of Albania]. They tried to do this in a very secretive manner. In reality, their aim in this direction was utterly hostile, for they intended to overturn the situation in Albania.&quot; By June 1947, the Central Committee of Yugoslavia began publicly condemning Hoxha, accusing him of taking an individualistic and anti-Marxist line. When Albania responded by making agreements with the Soviet Union to purchase a supply of agricultural machinery, Yugoslavia said that Albania could not enter into any agreements with other countries without Yugoslav approval.

Koçi Xoxe tried to stop Hoxha from improving relations with Bulgaria, reasoning that Albania would be more stable with one trading partner rather than with many. Nako Spiru, an anti-Yugoslav member of the Party, condemned Xoxe and vice versa. With no one coming to Spiru&#x27;s defense, he viewed the situation as hopeless and feared that Yugoslav domination of his nation was imminent, which caused him to commit suicide in November.

At the Eighth Plenum of the Central Committee of the Party which lasted from 26 February to 8 March 1948, Xoxe was implicated in a plot to isolate Hoxha and consolidate his own power. He accused Hoxha of being responsible for the decline in relations with Yugoslavia and stated that a Soviet military mission should be expelled in favor of a Yugoslav counterpart. Hoxha managed to remain firm and his support had not declined. When Yugoslavia publicly broke with the Soviet Union, Hoxha&#x27;s support base grew stronger. Then, on 1 July 1948, Tirana called on all Yugoslav technical advisors to leave the country and unilaterally declared all treaties and agreements between the two countries null and void. Xoxe was expelled from the party and on 13 June 1949, he was executed by hanging.

=== Relations with the Soviet Union ===

After the break with Yugoslavia, Hoxha aligned himself with the Soviet Union. From 1948 to 1960, $200 million in Soviet aid was given to Albania for technical and infrastructural expansion. Albania was admitted to the Comecon on 22 February 1949 and it served as a pro-Soviet force on the Adriatic. A Soviet submarine base was built on the Albanian island of Sazan near Vlorë, posing a hypothetical threat to the U.S. Sixth Fleet in the Mediterranean. Relations with the Soviet Union remained close until the death of Stalin in March 1953. It was followed by 14 days of national mourning in Albania – more than in the Soviet Union. Hoxha assembled the population of Tirana in the capital&#x27;s largest square, which featured a Stalin statue, requested that they kneel and take a 2,000-word oath of &quot;eternal fidelity&quot; and &quot;gratitude&quot; to their &quot;beloved father&quot; and &quot;great liberator&quot;.

Under Nikita Khrushchev, Stalin&#x27;s eventual successor, aid was reduced and Albania was encouraged to adopt Khrushchev&#x27;s specialisation policy. Under it, Albania would develop its agricultural output in order to supply the Soviet Union and other Warsaw Pact countries while they would be developing products of their own, which would, in theory, strengthen the Warsaw Pact. However, this also meant that Albanian industrial development, which was heavily stressed by Hoxha, would be hindered.

In May–June 1955, Nikolai Bulganin and Anastas Mikoyan visited Yugoslavia while Khrushchev renounced the expulsion of Yugoslavia from the Communist bloc. Khrushchev also began making references to Palmiro Togliatti&#x27;s theory. Hoxha had not been consulted on this and was offended. Yugoslavia began asking for Hoxha to rehabilitate the image of Xoxe, which Hoxha steadfastly rejected. In 1956 at the Twentieth Party Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, Khrushchev condemned the cult of personality that had been built up around Stalin and denounced his excesses. Khrushchev then announced the theory of peaceful coexistence, which angered the Stalinist Hoxha greatly. The Institute of Marxist–Leninist Studies, led by Hoxha&#x27;s wife Nexhmije, quoted Vladimir Lenin: &quot;The fundamental principle of the foreign policy of a socialist country and of a Communist party is proletarian internationalism; not peaceful coexistence.&quot; Hoxha now took a more active stand against perceived revisionism.

Unity within the Albanian Party of Labour began to decline as well, with a special delegate meeting held in Tirana in April 1956, composed of 450 delegates and having unexpected results. The delegates &quot;criticized the conditions in the party, the negative attitude toward the masses, the absence of party and socialist democracy, the economic policy of the leadership, etc.&quot; while also calling for discussions on the cult of personality and the Twentieth Party Congress.

==== Movement towards China and Maoism ====

In 1956, Hoxha called for a resolution which would confirm the existing leadership of the Party. The resolution was accepted, and all of the delegates who had spoken against it were expelled from the party and imprisoned. Hoxha claimed that Yugoslavia had attempted to overthrow the leadership of Albania. This incident increased Hoxha&#x27;s power, effectively making Khrushchev-style reforms impossible there. In the same year, Hoxha travelled to China, then embroiled in the Sino-Soviet split, and met Mao Zedong. Chinese aid to Albania rose sharply during the next two years.

In an effort to keep Albania in the Soviet sphere, increased Soviet aid was given but Albania&#x27;s relations with the Soviet Union remained at the same level until 1960, when Khrushchev met Sofoklis Venizelos, a liberal Greek politician. Khrushchev sympathised with the concept of an autonomous Greek North Epirus and he wanted to use Greek claims on North Epirus to keep the Albanian leadership in line. Hoxha reacted by only sending Hysni Kapo, a member of the Albanian Political Bureau, to the Third Congress of the Romanian Workers&#x27; Party in Bucharest, an event which Communist heads of state were normally expected to attend. As relations between the two countries continued to deteriorate during the course of the meeting, Khrushchev said:

==== Friction with the Soviet Union ====
Relations with the Soviet Union rapidly deteriorated. A hardline policy was adopted and the Soviets reduced grain shipments at a time when Albania needed them due to the possibility of a flood-induced famine. In July 1960, a plot to overthrow the Albanian government was discovered. It was to be organised by Soviet-trained Rear Admiral Teme Sejko. After that two pro-Soviet members of the Party, Liri Belishova and Koço Tashko, were expelled.

In August, the Party&#x27;s Central Committee sent a protest letter to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union about the presence of an anti-Albanian Soviet Ambassador in Tirana. The Fourth Congress of the Party, held from 13 to 20 February 1961, was the last meeting that the Soviet Union or other Eastern European nations attended in Albania. During the congress, Mehmet Shehu said that while many members of the Party were accused of tyranny, this was a baseless charge and unlike the Soviet Union, Albania was led by genuine Marxists.

The Soviet Union retaliated by threatening Albania with &quot;dire consequences&quot; if the condemnations were not retracted. Days later, Khrushchev and Antonín Novotný, President of Czechoslovakia, threatened to cut off economic aid. In March, Albania was not invited to attend the meeting of the Warsaw Pact nations, and in April all Soviet technicians were withdrawn from Albania. In May nearly all Soviet troops at the Soviet submarine base were withdrawn.

On 7 November 1961, Hoxha made a speech in which he called Khrushchev a &quot;revisionist, an anti-Marxist and a defeatist&quot;. Hoxha portrayed Stalin as the last Communist leader of the Soviet Union and alluded to Albania&#x27;s independence. By 11 November, the USSR and every other Warsaw Pact nation broke diplomatic relations with Albania. Albania was unofficially excluded from the Warsaw Pact and Comecon. The Soviet Union also attempted to claim control of the submarine base. The Albanian Party then passed a law prohibiting any other nation from owning an Albanian port. The Albanian–Soviet split was now complete.

== Later rule (1965–1985) ==

As Hoxha&#x27;s leadership continued, he took on an increasingly theoretical stance. He wrote criticisms which were based on theory and current events which occurred at the time; his most notable criticisms were his condemnations of Maoism after 1978.

During World War II, the Albanian Communists encouraged women to join the partisans and following the war, women were encouraged to take up menial jobs, as the education necessary for higher level work was out of most women&#x27;s reach. In 1938, 4% worked in various sectors of the economy. In 1970, this number had risen to 38%, and in 1982 to 46%. 
In 1978, 15.1 times as many females attended eight-year schools as had done so in 1938 and 175.7 times as many females attended secondary schools. By 1978, 101.9 times as many women attended higher schools as in 1957.

During the Cultural and Ideological Revolution, women were encouraged to take up all jobs, including government posts, which resulted in 40.7% of the People&#x27;s Councils and 30.4% of the People&#x27;s Assembly being made up of women, including two women in the Central Committee by 1985. Hoxha said of women&#x27;s rights in 1967:The entire party and country should hurl into the fire and break the neck of anyone who dared trample underfoot the sacred edict of the party on the defense of women&#x27;s rights.

An electrification campaign was begun in 1960 and the entire nation was expected to have electricity by 1985. Instead, it achieved this on 25 October 1970. During the Cultural and Ideological Revolution of 1967–1968 the military changed from traditional Communist army tactics and began to adhere to the Maoist strategy known as people&#x27;s war, which included the abolition of military ranks, which were not fully restored until 1991.
Hoxha&#x27;s legacy also included a complex of 173,371 one-man concrete bunkers across a country of 3 million inhabitants, to act as look-outs and gun emplacements along with chemical weapons. The bunkers were built strong and mobile, with the intention that they could be easily placed by a crane or a helicopter in a hole. The types of bunkers vary from machine gun pillboxes, beach bunkers, to underground naval facilities and even Air Force Mountain and underground bunkers.

Hoxha&#x27;s internal policies were true to Stalin&#x27;s paradigm which he admired, and the personality cult which was developed in the 1970s and organised around him by the Party also bore a striking resemblance to that of Stalin. At times it even reached an intensity which was as extreme as the personality cult of Kim Il Sung (which Hoxha condemned) with Hoxha being portrayed as a genius commenting on virtually all facets of life from culture to economics to military matters. Each schoolbook required one or more quotations from him on the subjects being studied. The Party honored him with titles such as Supreme Comrade, Sole Force and Great Teacher. He adopted a different type military salute for the People&#x27;s Army to render honors which was known as the &quot;Hoxhaist salute&quot;, which involves soldiers curling their right fist and raising it to shoulder level. It replaced the Zogist salute, which was used by the Royal Albanian Army for many years.

Hoxha&#x27;s governance was also distinguished by his encouragement of a high birthrate policy. For instance, a woman who bore an above-average number of children would be given the government award of &quot;Heroine Mother&quot; (in Albanian: &quot;Nënë Heroinë&quot;) along with cash rewards. Abortion was essentially restricted (to encourage high birth rates), except if the birth posed a danger to the mother&#x27;s life, though it was not completely banned; the process was decided by district medical commissions. As a result, the population of Albania tripled from 1 million in 1944 to around 3 million in 1985.

=== Relations with China ===

At the start of Albania&#x27;s third five-year plan, China offered Albania a loan of $125 million which would be used to build twenty-five chemical, electrical and metallurgical plants in accordance with the plan. However, the nation discovered that the task of completing these building projects was difficult, because Albania&#x27;s relations with its neighbors were poor and because matters were also complicated by the long distance between Albania and China. Unlike Yugoslavia or the USSR, China had less economic influence on Albania during Hoxha&#x27;s rule. During the previous fifteen years (1946–1961), at least 50% of Albania&#x27;s economy was dependent on foreign commerce.

By the time the 1976 constitution was promulgated, Albania had mostly become self-sufficient, but it lacked modern technology. Ideologically, Hoxha found that Mao&#x27;s initial views were in line with Marxism–Leninism, due to his condemnation of Khrushchev&#x27;s alleged revisionism and his condemnation of Yugoslavia. The financial aid which China provided to Albania was interest-free and it did not have to be repaid until Albania could afford to do so.

China never intervened in Albania&#x27;s economic output, and Chinese technicians and Albanian workers both worked for the same wages. Albanian newspapers were reprinted in Chinese newspapers, and they were also read on Chinese radio, and Albania led the movement to give the People&#x27;s Republic of China a seat on the UN Security Council. During this period, Albania became the second largest producer of chromium in the world, which China considered important. Strategically, the Adriatic Sea was attractive to China, because China hoped that it could gain more allies in Eastern Europe through Albania - a hope which was misplaced. Zhou Enlai visited Albania in January 1964. On 9 January, &quot;The 1964 Sino-Albanian Joint Statement&quot; was signed in Tirana. The statement said of relations between socialist countries:
Like Albania, China defended the &quot;purity&quot; of Marxism by attacking American imperialism and &quot;Soviet and Yugoslav revisionism&quot;, both of them were equally attacked as part of a &quot;dual adversary&quot; theory. Yugoslavia was viewed as both a &quot;special detachment of U.S. imperialism&quot; and a &quot;saboteur against world revolution&quot;. However, these views began to change in China, which was one of the major issues which Albania had with the alliance. Additionally, unlike Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union, the Sino-Albanian alliance lacked &quot;... an organisational structure for regular consultations and policy coordination, and it was also characterized by an informal relationship which was conducted on an &quot;ad hoc&quot; basis.&quot; Mao made a speech on 3 November 1966 in which he claimed that Albania was the only Marxist–Leninist state in Europe and in the same speech, he also stated that &quot;an attack on Albania will have to reckon with the great People&#x27;s Republic of China. If the U.S. imperialists, the modern Soviet revisionists or any of their lackeys dare to touch Albania in the slightest, nothing lies ahead for them but a complete, shameful and memorable defeat.&quot; Likewise, Hoxha stated that &quot;You may rest assured, comrades, that come what may in the world at large, our two parties and our two peoples will certainly remain together. They will fight together and they will win together.&quot;

==== Shift in China&#x27;s foreign policy after the Cultural Revolution ====
During the Cultural Revolution, China entered into a four-year period of relative diplomatic isolation, however, its relations with Albania were positive. On 20 August 1968, the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia was condemned by Albania, along with the Brezhnev doctrine. Albania refused to send troops to Czechoslovakia in support of the invasion, and it officially withdrew from the Warsaw Pact on 5 September.

Albania&#x27;s relations with China began to deteriorate on 15 July 1971, when United States President Richard Nixon agreed to visit China in order to meet with Zhou Enlai. Hoxha believed that China had betrayed Albania, and on 6 August, the Central Committee of the PLA sent a letter to the Central Committee of the CCP in which it called Nixon a &quot;frenzied anti-Communist&quot;. The letter stated:

The result of this criticism was a message from the Chinese leadership in 1971 in which it stated that Albania could not depend on an indefinite flow of aid from China, and in 1972 Albania was advised to &quot;curb its expectations about further Chinese contributions to its economic development&quot;. By 1972, Hoxha wrote in his diary &quot;Reflections on China&quot; that China was no longer a socialist country, instead aligning itself with the interests of a powerful nation that prioritized pragmatic relations over socialist principles. In 1973, he wrote that the Chinese leaders had &quot;cut off their contacts&quot; with Albania, reducing their interactions to merely formal diplomatic exchanges. While China maintained its economic agreements, Hoxha remarked that their &quot;initial ardor&quot; had waned.

In response, trade with COMECON (although trade with the Soviet Union was still blocked) and Yugoslavia grew. Trade with Third World nations was $0.5 million in 1973, but $8.3 million in 1974. Trade rose from 0.1% to 1.6%. Following Mao&#x27;s death on 9 September 1976, Hoxha remained optimistic about Sino-Albanian relations, but in August 1977, Hua Guofeng, the new leader of China, stated that Mao&#x27;s Three Worlds Theory would become official foreign policy. Hoxha viewed this as a way for China to justify having the U.S. as the &quot;secondary enemy&quot; while viewing the Soviet Union as the main one, thus allowing China to trade with the U.S. He condemned this as a &quot;diabolical plan&quot; for China to position itself as a superpower at the head of the &quot;third world&quot; and the &quot;non-aligned world.&quot;

From 30 August to 7 September 1977, Tito visited Beijing and was welcomed by the Chinese leadership. Following this, the PLA declared that China was now a revisionist state akin to the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia, and that Albania was the only Marxist–Leninist state on Earth. Hoxha stated:

On 13 July 1978, China announced that it was cutting off all of its aid to Albania. For the first time in modern history, Albania did not have a major ally nor a major trading partner.

=== Political repression and emigration ===
Certain clauses in the 1976 constitution circumscribed the exercise of political liberties which the government interpreted as being contrary to the established order. The government denied the population access to information other than that which was disseminated by government-controlled media outlets. Internally, the Sigurimi used the same repressive methods which were used by the NKVD, the MGB, the KGB and the East German Stasi. At one point, every third Albanian had either been interrogated by the Sigurimi or they had been incarcerated in labour camps. The government imprisoned thousands of people in forced-labour camps or it executed them for alleged crimes such as treachery or disrupting the proletarian dictatorship. After 1968, travel abroad was forbidden to all but those people who were on official business. Western European culture was looked upon with deep suspicion, resulting in bans on all unauthorised foreign materials and arrests: Art was required to reflect the styles of socialist realism. Beards were banned as unhygienic in order to curb the influence of Islam (many imams and babas had beards) and the Eastern Orthodox faith. The justice system&#x27;s legal proceedings regularly degenerated into show trials. An American human rights group described the proceedings of one trial, noting that the defendant was not allowed to question the witnesses. While he could express objections to certain aspects of the case, the prosecutor dismissed them, telling him to &quot;sit down and be quiet&quot; because they claimed to know better.

 In order to lessen the threat of political dissidents and other exiles, relatives of the accused were often arrested, ostracised, and accused of being &quot;enemies of the people&quot;. Political executions were common, and at least 5,000 people—possibly as many as 25,000—were killed by the regime. Torture was often used to obtain confessions:
During Hoxha&#x27;s rule, there were six institutions for political prisoners and fourteen labour camps where political prisoners and common criminals worked together. It has been estimated that there were approximately 32,000 people imprisoned in Albania in 1985.

Article 47 of the Albanian Criminal Code stated that to &quot;escape outside the state, as well as refusal to return to the Fatherland by a person who has been sent to serve or has been permitted temporarily to go outside the state&quot; was an act of treason, a crime punishable by a minimum sentence of ten years and a maximum sentence of death. The Albanian government went to great lengths to prevent people from defecting by leaving the country:An electrically-wired metal fence stands 600 meters to one kilometer from the actual border. Anyone touching the fence not only risks electrocution, but also sets off alarm bells and lights which alert guards stationed at approximately one-kilometre intervals along the fence. Two meters of soil on either side of the fence are cleared in order to check for footprints of escapees and infiltrators. The area between the fence and the actual border is seeded with booby traps such as coils of wire, noise makers consisting of thin pieces of metal strips on top of two wooden slats with stones in a tin container which rattle if stepped on, and flares that are triggered by contact, thus illuminating would-be escapees during the night.

=== Religion ===

Albania was a predominantly Muslim country after the demise of the Ottoman Empire, in which social structure was based on confessional communities not on ethnic groups. After the rise of nationalism in the Ottoman Empire, Muslims were classified as Turks, Eastern Orthodox Christians were classified as Greeks, and Catholics were classified as Latins. Hoxha believed that this division of Albanian society along religious and ethnic lines was a serious issue, because it fueled Greek separatists in southern Albania in particular and it also divided the nation in general. The Agrarian Reform Law of 1945 confiscated much of the church&#x27;s property in the country. Catholics were the earliest religious community to be targeted because the Vatican was considered an agent of Fascism and anti-Communism. In 1946 the Jesuit Order was banned and the Franciscans were banned in 1947. &quot;Decree No. 743&quot; (On religion) sought the establishment of a national church and it also forbade religious leaders from associating with foreign powers.

Mother Teresa, a Catholic nun whose relatives resided in Albania during Hoxha&#x27;s rule, was denied a chance to see them because she was considered a dangerous agent of the Vatican. Despite multiple requests and despite the fact that many countries made requests on her behalf, she was not granted the opportunity to see her mother and sister. Mother Teresa&#x27;s mother and sister both died during Hoxha&#x27;s rule, and the nun herself was only able to visit Albania five years after the Communist regime collapsed. 

The Party focused on atheist education in schools. This tactic was effective, primarily as a result of the high birthrate policy which was encouraged after the war. During periods which are considered &quot;holy periods&quot; by religious people, such as Lent and Ramadan, many foods and non-water beverages were distributed in schools and factories, and religious people who refused to eat those foods and drink those beverages when they were offered to them during their &quot;fasting times&quot; were denounced.

Starting on 6February 1967, the party began to promote secularism in place of Abrahamic religions. Hoxha, who had launched a Cultural and Ideological Revolution after being partially inspired by China&#x27;s Cultural Revolution, encouraged Communist students and workers to use more forceful tactics in order to discourage people from continuing their religious practices; the use of violence was initially condemned.

According to Hoxha, the surge in anti-theist activities began with the youth. The result of this &quot;spontaneous, unprovoked movement&quot; was the demolition or conversion of all 2,169 churches and mosques in Albania. State atheism became official policy, and Albania was declared the world&#x27;s first atheist state. Town and city names which echoed Abrahamic religious themes were abandoned for neutral secular ones, as well as personal names. By 1968, Hoxha stated in a speech in that &quot;Religion is a fuel kindling fires of all evils&quot;. During this period religiously based names were also made illegal. The &quot;Dictionary of People&#x27;s Names&quot;, published in 1982, contained 3,000 approved, secular names. In 1992, Monsignor Dias, the Papal Nuncio for Albania appointed by Pope John Paul II, said that of the three hundred Catholic priests present in Albania prior to the Communists coming to power, only thirty were still active. The promotion of religion was banned, and all clerics were labeled reactionaries and outlawed. Those religious figures who refused to embrace the principles of Marxism–Leninism were either arrested or carried on their activities in hiding.

=== Cultivating ultranationalism ===

During the anti-religious campaign, Enver Hoxha declared that &quot;the only religion of Albania is Albanianism&quot;, a quotation from the poem &quot;O moj Shqiperi&quot; (&quot;O Albania&quot;) by the 19th-century Albanian writer Pashko Vasa.

Muzafer Korkuti, one of the dominant figures in post-war Albanian archaeology and now the Director of the Institute of Archaeology in Tirana, stated the following in an interview on 10 July 2002:

Efforts were focused on an Illyrian-Albanian continuity issue. An Illyrian origin of the Albanians (without denying &quot;Pelasgian&quot; roots) continued to play a significant role in Albanian nationalism, resulting in a revival of given names supposedly of &quot;Illyrian&quot; origin, at the expense of given names associated with Christianity. At first, Albanian nationalist writers opted for the Pelasgians as the forefathers of the Albanians, but as this form of nationalism flourished in Albania under Enver Hoxha, the Pelasgians became a secondary element to the Illyrian theory of Albanian origins, which could claim some support in scholarship.

The Illyrian descent theory soon became one of the pillars of Albanian nationalism, especially because it could provide some evidence in support of the belief that there was a continuous Albanian presence in Kosovo and Southern Albania, i.e. areas that were subjected to ethnic conflicts between Albanians, Serbs and Greeks. Under the government of Enver Hoxha, an autochthonous ethnogenesis was promoted and physical anthropologists tried to prove that Albanians were different from all other Indo-European populations, a theory which is currently discredited. They claimed that the Illyrians were the most ancient people in the Balkans and greatly extended the age of the Illyrian language.

===Rejecting Western mass media culture===
Hoxha and his government were also hostile to Western popular culture as it was manifested in the mass media, along with the consumerism and cultural liberalism which were associated with it. In a speech on the Fourth Plenum of the Central Committee of the PLA (PLA-CC) on 26 June 1973, Hoxha declared a definitive break with any such Western bourgeois influence and what he described as its &quot;degenerated bourgeois culture&quot;. In a speech in which he also criticised the &quot;spread of certain vulgar, alien tastes in music and art&quot;, which ran &quot;contrary to socialist ethics and the positive traditions of our people&quot;, including &quot;degenerate importations such as long hair, extravagant dress, screaming jungle music, coarse language, shameless behaviour and so on&quot;, Hoxha declared:

== Later life and death ==

In 1974, Hoxha accused Beqir Balluku, Minister of Defence and longtime ally, of being an agent of China and attempting a coup d&#x27;état, since Balluku had criticized Hoxha&#x27;s bunker program and said that a U.S. and Soviet invasion of Albania was unlikely. Hoxha sentenced Balluku and a group of his accused associates to death and appointed Mehmet Shehu as Minister of Defence.

A new Constitution was decided upon by the Seventh Congress of the Albanian Party of Labour on 1–7 November 1976. According to Hoxha, &quot;The old Constitution was the Constitution of the building of the foundations of socialism, whereas the new Constitution will be the Constitution of the complete construction of a socialist society.&quot;

Self-reliance was now stressed more than ever. Citizens were encouraged to train in the use of weapons, and this activity was also taught in schools. The purpose of this training was to encourage the creation of quick partisans.

Borrowing and foreign investment were banned under Article 26 of the Constitution, which read: &quot;The granting of concessions to, and the creation of foreign economic and financial companies and other institutions or ones formed jointly with bourgeois and revisionist capitalist monopolies and states as well as obtaining credits from them are prohibited in the People&#x27;s Socialist Republic of Albania.&quot; Hoxha said of borrowing money and allowing investment from other countries:
Albania was the most isolated country in Europe. In 1983, Albania imported goods which were worth $280 million but it exported goods which were worth $290 million, producing a trade surplus of $10 million.
In 1981, Hoxha ordered the execution of several party and government officials in a new purge. Prime Minister Mehmet Shehu, the second-most powerful man in Albania and Hoxha&#x27;s closest comrade-in-arms for 40 years, was reported to have committed suicide in December 1981. He was subsequently condemned as a &quot;traitor&quot; to Albania, and he was also accused of operating in the service of multiple intelligence agencies. It is generally believed that he was either killed or he shot himself during a power struggle which may have resulted from differing foreign policy matters with Hoxha. Hoxha also wrote a large assortment of books during this period, resulting in over 65 volumes of collected works, condensed into six volumes of selected works.

In 1973, Hoxha suffered a heart attack from which he never fully recovered. In increasingly precarious health from the late 1970s onward, he turned most state functions over to Ramiz Alia. In his final days, he was confined to a wheelchair and suffered from diabetes, with which he was diagnosed in 1948, along with cerebral ischemia, with which he was diagnosed in 1983. On 9 April 1985, he was struck by a ventricular fibrillation. Over the next 48 hours, he suffered repeated episodes of this arrhythmia, and he died in the early morning hours of 11 April 1985 at the age of 76. The Albanian government announced seven days of mourning with flags flown at half-mast and entertainment and cultural events cancelled.

Hoxha&#x27;s body lay in state at the building of the Presidium of the People&#x27;s Assembly for three days before he was buried on 15 April after a memorial service on Skanderbeg Square. The government refused to accept any foreign delegations during Hoxha&#x27;s funeral and it even condemned the Soviet message of condolences as &quot;unacceptable&quot;. After his burial, Hoxha was succeeded as head of state by Ramiz Alia, who gained control of the party&#x27;s leadership two days later.

Hoxha left Albania with a legacy of isolation and fear of the outside world. Despite some economic progress which Albania made during Hoxha&#x27;s rule, the country was in economic stagnation; Albania had been the poorest European country throughout much of the Cold War period.

== Family ==

The surname &quot;Hoxha&quot; is the Albanian variant of hodja (from ), a title which was given to his ancestors due to their efforts to teach Albanians about Islam. Hoxha&#x27;s parents were Halil and Gjylihan (Gjylo) Hoxha, and Hoxha had three sisters, Fahrije, Haxhire and Sanije. Hysen Hoxha () was Enver Hoxha&#x27;s uncle and was a militant who campaigned vigorously for the independence of Albania, which occurred when Enver was four years old. His grandfather Beqir was involved in the Gjirokastër section of the League of Prizren.

Hoxha&#x27;s son Sokol Hoxha was the CEO of the Albanian Post and Telecommunication service and he is married to Liliana Hoxha. Sali Berisha, a later democratic president of Albania, was often seen socialising with Sokol Hoxha and other close relatives of leading Communist figures in Albania.

Hoxha&#x27;s daughter, Pranvera, is an architect. Along with her husband, Klement Kolaneci, she designed the Enver Hoxha Museum in Tirana, a white-tiled pyramid. Some sources have referred to the edifice, said to be the most expensive edifice ever constructed in Albanian history, as the &quot;Enver Hoxha Mausoleum&quot;, but this was not an official appellation. The museum was opened in 1988, three years after her father&#x27;s death, and in 1991, it was transformed into a conference centre and an exhibition venue and it was renamed the Pyramid of Tirana.

== Coup attempts ==
The Mustafa Band was a gang which was connected to counter-revolutionary elements such as the Albanian mafia and members of the royal House of Zogu, and in 1982, it attempted to assassinate Enver Hoxha. The plan failed and two of its members were killed and another member was arrested.

According to Hoxha, after Albania&#x27;s long-time prime minister Mehmet Shehu died in 1981, documents were found in a vault which previously belonged to him and according to them, he would poison Hoxha and assume the leadership of the country, orders which were issued by Yugoslav intelligence. In his book &quot;The Titoites&quot;, Hoxha argued that this plan failed because Shehu was a coward who could not go through with the task and he figured that suicide would, at the very least, save his family from the punishment which he deserved for his counter-revolutionary activities.

== Legacy ==
In 2016, the results of a survey which was conducted by the Institute for Development Research and Alternatives (IDRA) showed that 45% of Albanians believed that Hoxha had a positive impact on the history of Albania, whereas 42% of Albanians believed that he had a negative impact on the history of Albania. Younger generations (16–35 years old; born after 1981) tend to have a more negative view of Hoxha&#x27;s contributions, while older generations (over 35 years old; born before 1981) tend to have a more positive view. Citizens in the regions of southeastern and southwestern Albania who were interviewed had the most positive view of Hoxha, respectively, they comprised 50% and 55% of the entire population. Others have viewed him as a dictator.

<text>Hirohito (29 April 19017 January 1989), posthumously honored as Emperor Shōwa, was the 124th emperor of Japan according to the traditional order of succession, from 25 December 1926 until his death in 1989. He remains Japan&#x27;s longest-reigning emperor as well as one of the world&#x27;s longest-reigning monarchs. As emperor during the Shōwa era, Hirohito oversaw the rise of Japanese militarism, Japan&#x27;s expansionism in Asia, the outbreak of the Second Sino-Japanese War and World War II, and the postwar Japanese economic miracle. 

Hirohito was born during the reign of his paternal grandfather, Emperor Meiji, as the first child of the Crown Prince Yoshihito and Crown Princess Sadako (later Emperor Taishō and Empress Teimei). When Emperor Meiji died in 1912, Hirohito&#x27;s father ascended the throne, and Hirohito was proclaimed crown prince and heir apparent in 1916. In 1921, he made an official visit to Great Britain and Western Europe, marking the first time a Japanese crown prince traveled abroad. Owing to his father&#x27;s ill health, Hirohito became his regent that year. In 1924, Hirohito married Princess Nagako Kuni, and they had seven children. He became emperor upon his father&#x27;s death in 1926.

As Japan&#x27;s head of state, Emperor Hirohito presided over the rise of militarism in Japanese politics. In 1931, he made no objection when Japan&#x27;s Kwantung Army staged the Mukden incident as a pretext for its invasion of Manchuria. Following the onset of the Second Sino-Japanese War in 1937, tensions steadily grew between Japan and the United States. Once Hirohito formally sanctioned his government&#x27;s decision to go to war against the U.S. and its allies on 1 December 1941, the Pacific War began one week later with a Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor as well as on other U.S. and British colonies in the region. After atomic bombs were dropped on Japan and the Soviet Union invaded Japanese-occupied Manchuria, Hirohito called upon his country&#x27;s forces to surrender in a radio broadcast on 15 August 1945. The extent of his involvement in military decision-making and wartime culpability remain subjects of historical debate.

Following the surrender of Japan, Emperor Hirohito was not prosecuted for war crimes at the Tokyo War Crimes Tribunal even though the Japanese had waged war in his name. The head of the Allied occupation of the country, Douglas MacArthur, believed that a cooperative emperor would facilitate a peaceful occupation and other U.S. postwar objectives. MacArthur therefore excluded any evidence from the tribunal which could have incriminated Hirohito or other members of the royal family. In 1946, Hirohito was pressured by the Allies into renouncing his divinity. Under Japan&#x27;s new constitution drafted by U.S. officials, his role as emperor was redefined in 1947 as &quot;the symbol of the State and of the unity of the people&quot;. Upon his death in January 1989, he was succeeded by his eldest son, Akihito.

==Early life and education==

Hirohito was born on 29 April 1901 at Tōgū Palace in Aoyama, Tokyo during the reign of his grandfather, Emperor Meiji, the first son of 21-year-old Crown Prince Yoshihito (the future Emperor Taishō) and 16-year-old Crown Princess Sadako, the future Empress Teimei. He was the grandson of Emperor Meiji and Yanagiwara Naruko. His childhood title was Prince Michi.

Ten weeks after he was born, Hirohito was removed from the court and placed in the care of Count Kawamura Sumiyoshi, who raised him as his grandchild. At the age of 3, Hirohito and his brother Yasuhito were returned to court when Kawamura died – first to the imperial mansion in Numazu, Shizuoka, then back to the Aoyama Palace.

In 1908, he began elementary studies at the Gakushūin (Peers School). Emperor Mutsuhito, then appointed General Nogi Maresuke to be the Gakushūin&#x27;s tenth president as well as the one in-charge on educating his grandson. The main aspect that they focused was on physical education and health, primarily because Hirohito was a sickly child, on par with the impartment or inculcation of values such as frugality, patience, manliness, self-control, and devotion to the duty at hand.During 1912, at the age of 11, Hirohito was commissioned into the Imperial Japanese Army as a Second Lieutenant and in the Imperial Japanese Navy as an Ensign. He was also bestowed with the Grand Cordon of the Order of the Chrysanthemum. When his grandfather, Emperor Meiji died on 30 July 1912, Yoshihito assumed the throne and his eldest son, Hirohito became heir apparent.

After learning about the death of his instructor, General Nogi, he along with his brothers were reportedly overcome with emotions. He would later acknowledge the lasting influence of Nogi in his life. At that time he was still two years away from completing primary school, henceforth his education was compensated by Fleet Admiral Togo Heihachiro and Naval Captain Ogasawara Naganari, wherein later on, would become his major opponents with regards to his national defense policy.

Shiratori Kurakichi, one of his middle-school instructors, was one of the personalities who deeply influenced the life of Hirohito. Kurakichi was a trained historian from Germany, imbibing the positivist historiographic trend by Leopold von Ranke. He was the one who inculcated in the mind of the young Hirohito that there is a connection between the divine origin of the imperial line and the aspiration of linking it to the myth of the racial superiority and homogeneity of the Japanese. The emperors were often a driving force in the modernization of their country. He taught Hirohito that the Empire of Japan was created and governed through diplomatic actions (taking into accounts the interests of other nations benevolently and justly).

==Crown Prince era==
On 2 November 1916, Hirohito was formally proclaimed crown prince and heir apparent. An investiture ceremony was not required to confirm this status.

===Overseas travel===

From 3 March to 3 September 1921 (Taisho 10), the Crown Prince made official visits to the United Kingdom, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, Italy, Vatican City and Malta (then a protectorate of the British Empire). This was the first visit to Western Europe by the Crown Prince. Despite strong opposition in Japan, this was realized by the efforts of elder Japanese statesmen (Genrō) such as Yamagata Aritomo and Saionji Kinmochi.

The departure of Prince Hirohito was widely reported in newspapers. The Japanese battleship &quot;Katori&quot; was used, and departed from Yokohama, sailed to Naha, Hong Kong, Singapore, Colombo, Suez, Cairo, and Gibraltar. In April, Hirohito was present in Malta for the opening of the Maltese Parliament. After sailing for two months, the Katori arrived in Portsmouth on 9 May, on the same day reaching the British capital, London. Hirohito was welcomed in the UK as a partner of the Anglo-Japanese Alliance and met with King George V and Prime Minister David Lloyd George.

That evening, a banquet was held at Buckingham Palace, where Hirohito met with George V and Prince Arthur of Connaught. George V said that he treated his father like Hirohito, who was nervous in an unfamiliar foreign country, and that relieved his tension. The next day, he met Prince Edward (the future Edward VIII) at Windsor Castle, and a banquet was held every day thereafter. In London, he toured the British Museum, the Tower of London, the Bank of England, Lloyd&#x27;s Marine Insurance, Oxford University, Army University, and the Naval War College. He also enjoyed theater at the New Oxford Theatre and the Delhi Theatre.

At the University of Cambridge, he listened to Professor J. R. Tanner&#x27;s lecture on &quot;Relationship between the British Royal Family and its People&quot;, and was awarded an honorary doctorate degree. He visited Edinburgh, Scotland, from 19 to 20 May, and was also awarded an Honorary Doctor of Laws at the University of Edinburgh. He stayed at the residence of John Stewart-Murray, 8th Duke of Atholl, for three days. On his stay with Stuart-Murray, the prince was quoted as saying, &quot;The rise of Bolsheviks won&#x27;t happen if you live a simple life like Duke Athol.&quot;

In Italy, he met with King Vittorio Emanuele III and others, attended official international banquets, and visited places such as the fierce battlefields of World War I.

===Regency===
After returning (from Europe) to Japan, Hirohito became Regent of Japan (&quot;Sesshō&quot;) on 25 November 1921, in place of his ailing father, who was affected by mental illness. In 1923 he was promoted to the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel in the army and Commander in the navy, and army Colonel and Navy Captain in 1925.

====Visit of colonial Taiwan====
Over 12 days in April 1923, Hirohito visited Taiwan, which had been a Japanese colony since 1895. This was a voyage his father, the then Crown Prince Yoshihito had planned in 1911 but never completed.

It was widely reported in Taiwanese newspapers that famous high-end restaurants served typical Chinese luxury dishes for the Prince, such as swallow&#x27;s nest and shark fin, as Taiwanese cuisine. This was the first time an Emperor or a Crown Prince has ever eaten local cuisine on a colony, or had foreign dishes other than Western cuisine abroad, thus exceptional preparations were required: The eight chefs and other cooking staff were purified for a week (through fasting and ritual bathing) before the cooking of the feast could begin. This tasting of “Taiwanese cuisine” of the Prince Regent as part of an integration ceremony of incorporating the colony into the empire, which can be seen as the context and purpose of Hirohito&#x27;s Taiwanese visit.

Having visited several sites outside of Taipei, Hirohito returned to the capital on the 24th and on 25 April, just one day before his departure, he visited the Beitou hotspring district of Taipei and its oldest facility. The original structure had been built in 1913 in the style of a traditional Japanese bathhouse. However, in anticipation of Hirohito&#x27;s visit an additional residential wing was added to the earlier building, this time in the style of an Edwardian country house. The new building was subsequently opened to the public and was deemed the largest public bathhouse in the Japanese Empire.
Crown Prince Hirohito was a student of science, and he had heard that Beitou Creek was one of only two hot springs in the world that contained a rare radioactive mineral. So, he decided to walk into the creek to investigate.

Naturally, concerned for a royal family member&#x27;s safety, his entourage scurried around, seeking flat rocks to use as stepping stones. After that, these stones were carefully mounted and given the official name: “His Imperial Highness Crown Prince of Japan&#x27;s Stepping Stones for River Crossing,” with a stele alongside to tell the story.

Crown Prince Hirohito handed his Imperial Notice to Governor-General Den Kenjiro and departed from Keelung on 26 April 1923.

====Earthquake and assassination attempt====

The Great Kantō earthquake devastated Tokyo on 1 September 1923, killing some 100,000 people and leveling vast areas. The city could be rebuilt drawing on the then massive timber reserves of Taiwan. In the aftermath of the tragical disaster, the military authorities saw an opportunity to annihilate the communist movement in Japan. During the Kantō Massacre an estimated 6000 people, mainly ethnic Koreans, were annihilated. The backlash culminated in an assassination attempt by Daisuke Namba on the Prince Regent on 27 December 1923 in the so-called Toranomon incident, but the attempt failed. During interrogation, the failed assassin claimed to be a communist and was executed.

==Marriage==
Prince Hirohito married his distant cousin Princess Nagako Kuni, the eldest daughter of Prince Kuniyoshi Kuni, on 26 January 1924. They had two sons and five daughters (see Issue).

The daughters who lived to adulthood left the imperial family as a result of the American reforms of the Japanese imperial household in October 1947 (in the case of Princess Shigeko) or under the terms of the Imperial Household Law at the moment of their subsequent marriages (in the cases of Princesses Kazuko, Atsuko, and Takako).

==Reign==

=== Accession ===

On 25 December 1926, Yoshihito died and Hirohito became emperor. The Crown Prince was said to have received the succession (&quot;senso&quot;). The Taishō era&#x27;s end and the Shōwa era&#x27;s beginning (Enlightened Peace) were proclaimed. The deceased Emperor was posthumously renamed Emperor Taishō within days. Following Japanese custom, the new Emperor was never referred to by his given name but rather was referred to simply as &quot;His Majesty the Emperor&quot; which may be shortened to &quot;His Majesty.&quot; In writing, the Emperor was also referred to formally as &quot;The Reigning Emperor.&quot;

In November 1928, Hirohito&#x27;s accession was confirmed in ceremonies (&quot;sokui&quot;) which are conventionally identified as &quot;enthronement&quot; and &quot;coronation&quot; (&quot;Shōwa no tairei-shiki&quot;); but this formal event would have been more accurately described as a public confirmation that he possessed the Japanese Imperial Regalia, also called the Three Sacred Treasures, which have been handed down through the centuries. However, his enthronement events were planned and staged under the economic conditions of a recession whereas the 55th Imperial Diet unanimously passed $7,360,000 for the festivities.

=== Early reign ===

The first part of Hirohito&#x27;s reign took place against a background of financial crisis and increasing military power within the government through both legal and extralegal means. The Imperial Japanese Army and Imperial Japanese Navy held veto power over the formation of cabinets since 1900. Between 1921 and 1944, there were 64 separate incidents of political violence.

Hirohito narrowly escaped assassination by a hand grenade thrown by a Korean independence activist, Lee Bong-chang, in Tokyo on 9 January 1932, in the Sakuradamon Incident.

Another notable case was the assassination of moderate Prime Minister Inukai Tsuyoshi in 1932, marking the end of civilian control of the military. The February 26 incident, an attempted coup d&#x27;état, followed in February 1936. It was carried out by junior Army officers of the &quot;Kōdōha&quot; faction who had the sympathy of many high-ranking officers including Yasuhito, Prince Chichibu, one of Hirohito&#x27;s brothers. This revolt was occasioned by a loss of political support by the militarist faction in Diet elections. The coup resulted in the murders of several high government and Army officials.

When Chief Aide-de-camp Shigeru Honjō informed him of the revolt, Hirohito immediately ordered that it be put down and referred to the officers as &quot;rebels&quot; (&quot;bōto&quot;). Shortly thereafter, he ordered Army Minister Yoshiyuki Kawashima to suppress the rebellion within the hour. He asked for reports from Honjō every 30 minutes. The next day, when told by Honjō that the high command had made little progress in quashing the rebels, the Emperor told him &quot;I Myself, will lead the Konoe Division and subdue them.&quot; The rebellion was suppressed following his orders on 29 February.

=== Second Sino-Japanese War ===
Beginning from the Mukden Incident in 1931 in which Japan staged a false flag operation and made a false accusation against Chinese dissidents as a pretext to invade Manchuria, Japan occupied Chinese territories and established puppet governments. Such aggression was recommended to Hirohito by his chiefs of staff and prime minister Fumimaro Konoe; Hirohito did not voice objection to the invasion of China.

A diary by chamberlain Kuraji Ogura says that he was reluctant to start war against China in 1937 because they had underestimated China&#x27;s military strength and Japan should be cautious in its strategy. In this regard, Ogura writes that Hirohito stated &quot;once you start (a war), it cannot easily be stopped in the middle ... What&#x27;s important is when to end the war&quot; and &quot;one should be cautious in starting a war, but once begun, it should be carried out thoroughly.&quot;Nonetheless, according to Herbert Bix, Hirohito&#x27;s main concern seems to have been the possibility of an attack by the Soviet Union given his questions to his chief of staff, Prince Kan&#x27;in Kotohito, and army minister, Hajime Sugiyama, about the time it could take to crush Chinese resistance and how could they prepare for the eventuality of a Soviet incursion. Based on Bix&#x27;s findings, Hirohito was displeased by Prince Kan&#x27;in&#x27;s evasive responses about the substance of such contingency plans but nevertheless still approved the decision to move troops to North China.

According to Akira Fujiwara, Hirohito endorsed the policy of qualifying the invasion of China as an &quot;incident&quot; instead of a &quot;war&quot;; therefore, he did not issue any notice to observe international law in this conflict (unlike what his predecessors did in previous conflicts officially recognized by Japan as wars), and the Deputy Minister of the Japanese Army instructed the chief of staff of Japanese China Garrison Army on 5 August not to use the term &quot;prisoners of war&quot; for Chinese captives. This instruction led to the removal of the constraints of international law on the treatment of Chinese prisoners. The works of Yoshiaki Yoshimi and Seiya Matsuno show that Hirohito also authorized, by specific orders (&quot;rinsanmei&quot;), the use of chemical weapons against the Chinese.

Later in his life, Hirohito looked back on his decision to give the go-ahead to wage a &#x27;defensive&#x27; war against China and opined that his foremost priority was not to wage war with China but to prepare for a war with the Soviet Union, as his army had reassured him that the China war would end within three months, but that decision of his had haunted him since he forgot that the Japanese forces in China were drastically fewer than that of the Chinese, hence the shortsightedness of his perspective was evident.

On 1 December 1937, Hirohito had given formal instruction to General Iwane Matsui to capture and occupy the enemy capital of Nanking. He was very eager to fight this battle since he and his council firmly believed that all it would take is a one huge blow to bring forth the surrender of Chiang Kai-shek. He even gave an Imperial Rescript to Iwane when he returned to Tokyo a year later, despite the brutality that his officers had inflicted on the Chinese populace in Nanking; thus Hirohito had seemingly turned a blind eye to and condoned these monstrosities.

During the invasion of Wuhan, from August to October 1938, Hirohito authorized the use of toxic gas on 375 separate occasions, despite the resolution adopted by the League of Nations on 14 May condemning Japanese use of toxic gas.

=== World War II ===

==== Preparations ====
In July 1939, Hirohito quarrelled with his brother, Prince Chichibu, over whether to support the Anti-Comintern Pact, and reprimanded the army minister, Seishirō Itagaki. But after the success of the Wehrmacht in Europe, Hirohito consented to the alliance. On 27 September 1940, ostensibly under Hirohito&#x27;s leadership, Japan became a contracting partner of the Tripartite Pact with Germany and Italy forming the Axis powers.

The objectives to be obtained were clearly defined: a free hand to continue with the conquest of China and Southeast Asia, no increase in U.S. or British military forces in the region, and cooperation by the West &quot;in the acquisition of goods needed by our Empire.&quot;

On 5 September, Prime Minister Konoe informally submitted a draft of the decision to Hirohito, just one day in advance of the Imperial Conference at which it would be formally implemented. On this evening, Hirohito had a meeting with the chief of staff of the army, Sugiyama, chief of staff of the navy, Osami Nagano, and Prime Minister Konoe. Hirohito questioned Sugiyama about the chances of success of an open war with the Occident. As Sugiyama answered positively, Hirohito scolded him:

Chief of Naval General Staff Admiral Nagano, a former Navy Minister and vastly experienced, later told a trusted colleague, &quot;I have never seen the Emperor reprimand us in such a manner, his face turning red and raising his voice.&quot;

Nevertheless, all speakers at the Imperial Conference were united in favor of war rather than diplomacy. Baron Yoshimichi Hara, President of the Imperial Council and Hirohito&#x27;s representative, then questioned them closely, producing replies to the effect that war would be considered only as a last resort from some, and silence from others.

On 8 October, Sugiyama signed a 47-page report to the Emperor (sōjōan) outlining in minute detail plans for the advance into Southeast Asia. During the third week of October, Sugiyama gave Hirohito a 51-page document, &quot;Materials in Reply to the Throne,&quot; about the operational outlook for the war.

As war preparations continued, Prime Minister Fumimaro Konoe found himself increasingly isolated, and he resigned on 16 October. He justified himself to his chief cabinet secretary, Kenji Tomita, by stating:

The army and the navy recommended the appointment of Prince Naruhiko Higashikuni, one of Hirohito&#x27;s uncles, as prime minister. According to the Shōwa &quot;Monologue&quot;, written after the war, Hirohito then said that if the war were to begin while a member of the imperial house was prime minister, the imperial house would have to carry the responsibility and he was opposed to this. Instead, Hirohito chose the hard-line General Hideki Tōjō, who was known for his devotion to the imperial institution, and asked him to make a policy review of what had been sanctioned by the Imperial Conferences.
On 2 November Tōjō, Sugiyama, and Nagano reported to Hirohito that the review of eleven points had been in vain. Emperor Hirohito gave his consent to the war and then asked: &quot;Are you going to provide justification for the war?&quot; The decision for war against the United States was presented for approval to Hirohito by General Tōjō, Naval Minister Admiral Shigetarō Shimada, and Japanese Foreign Minister Shigenori Tōgō.

On 3 November, Nagano explained in detail the plan of the attack on Pearl Harbor to Hirohito. On 5 November Emperor Hirohito approved in imperial conference the operations plan for a war against the Western world and had many meetings with the military and Tōjō until the end of the month. He initially showed hesitance towards engaging in war, but eventually approved the decision to strike Pearl Harbor despite opposition from certain advisors. In the period leading up to Pearl Harbor, he expanded his control over military matters and participated in the Conference of Military Councillors, which was considered unusual of him. Additionally, he sought additional information regarding the attack plans. An aide reported that he openly showed joy upon learning of the success of the surprise attacks.

On 25 November Henry L. Stimson, United States Secretary of War, noted in his diary that he had discussed with U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt the severe likelihood that Japan was about to launch a surprise attack and that the question had been &quot;how we should maneuver them [the Japanese] into the position of firing the first shot without allowing too much danger to ourselves.&quot;

On the following day, 26 November 1941, U.S. Secretary of State Cordell Hull presented the Japanese ambassador with the Hull note, which as one of its conditions demanded the complete withdrawal of all Japanese troops from French Indochina and China. Japanese Prime Minister Hideki Tojo said to his cabinet, &quot;This is an ultimatum.&quot; On 1 December an Imperial Conference sanctioned the &quot;War against the United States, United Kingdom and the Kingdom of the Netherlands.&quot;

==== War: advance and retreat ====
On 8 December (7 December in Hawaii), 1941, in simultaneous attacks, Japanese forces struck at the Hong Kong Garrison, the United States Fleet in Pearl Harbor and in the Philippines, and began the invasion of Malaya.

With the nation fully committed to the war, Hirohito took a keen interest in military progress and sought to boost morale. According to Akira Yamada and Akira Fujiwara, Hirohito made major interventions in some military operations. For example, he pressed Sugiyama four times, on 13 and 21 January and 9 and 26 February, to increase troop strength and launch an attack on Bataan. On 9 February 19 March, and 29 May, Hirohito ordered the Army Chief of staff to examine the possibilities for an attack on Chongqing in China, which led to Operation Gogo.

While some authors, like journalists Peter Jennings and Todd Brewster, say that throughout the war, Hirohito was &quot;outraged&quot; at Japanese war crimes and the political dysfunction of many societal institutions that proclaimed their loyalty to him, and sometimes spoke up against them, others, such as historians Herbert P. Bix and Mark Felton, as well as the expert on China&#x27;s international relations Michael Tai, point out that Hirohito personally sanctioned the &quot;Three Alls policy&quot; (), a scorched earth strategy implemented in China from 1942 to 1945 and which was both directly and indirectly responsible for the deaths of &quot;more than 2.7 million&quot; Chinese civilians.

As the tide of war began to turn against Japan (around late 1942 and early 1943), the flow of information to the palace gradually began to bear less and less relation to reality, while others suggest that Hirohito worked closely with Prime Minister Hideki Tojo, continued to be well and accurately briefed by the military, and knew Japan&#x27;s military position precisely right up to the point of surrender. The chief of staff of the General Affairs section of the Prime Minister&#x27;s office, Shuichi Inada, remarked to Tōjō&#x27;s private secretary, Sadao Akamatsu:

In the first six months of war, all the major engagements had been victories. Japanese advances were stopped in the summer of 1942 with the Battle of Midway and the landing of the American forces on Guadalcanal and Tulagi in August. Hirohito played an increasingly influential role in the war; in eleven major episodes he was deeply involved in supervising the actual conduct of war operations. Hirohito pressured the High Command to order an early attack on the Philippines in 1941–42, including the fortified Bataan peninsula. He secured the deployment of army air power in the Guadalcanal campaign. Following Japan&#x27;s withdrawal from Guadalcanal he demanded a new offensive in New Guinea, which was duly carried out but failed badly. Unhappy with the navy&#x27;s conduct of the war, he criticized its withdrawal from the central Solomon Islands and demanded naval battles against the Americans for the losses they had inflicted in the Aleutians. The battles were disasters. Finally, it was at his insistence that plans were drafted for the recapture of Saipan and, later, for an offensive in the Battle of Okinawa. With the Army and Navy bitterly feuding, he settled disputes over the allocation of resources. He helped plan military offenses.

In September 1944, Hirohito declared that it must be his citizens&#x27; resolve to smash the evil purposes of the Westerners so that their imperial destiny might continue, but all along, it is just a mask for the urgent need of Japan to scratch a victory against the counter-offensive campaign of the Allied Forces.

On 18 October 1944, the Imperial headquarters had resolved that the Japanese must make a stand in the vicinity of Leyte to prevent the Americans from landing in the Philippines. This view was widely frowned upon and disgruntled the policymakers from both the army and navy sectors. Hirohito was quoted that he approved of such since if they won in that campaign, they would be finally having a room to negotiate with the Americans. As high as their spirits could go, the reality check for the Japanese would also come into play since the forces they have sent in Leyte, was practically the ones that would efficiently defend the island of Luzon, hence the Japanese had struck a huge blow in their own military planning.

The media, under tight government control, repeatedly portrayed him as lifting the popular morale even as the Japanese cities came under heavy air attack in 1944–45 and food and housing shortages mounted. Japanese retreats and defeats were celebrated by the media as successes that portended &quot;Certain Victory.&quot; Only gradually did it become apparent to the Japanese people that the situation was very grim owing to growing shortages of food, medicine, and fuel as U.S. submarines began wiping out Japanese shipping. Starting in mid 1944, American raids on the major cities of Japan made a mockery of the unending tales of victory. Later that year, with the downfall of Tojo&#x27;s government, two other prime ministers were appointed to continue the war effort, Kuniaki Koiso and Kantarō Suzuki—each with the formal approval of Hirohito. Both were unsuccessful and Japan was nearing disaster.

==== Surrender ====

In early 1945, in the wake of the losses in the Battle of Leyte, Emperor Hirohito began a series of individual meetings with senior government officials to consider the progress of the war. All but ex-Prime Minister Fumimaro Konoe advised continuing the war. Konoe feared a communist revolution even more than defeat in war and urged a negotiated surrender. In February 1945, during the first private audience with Hirohito he had been allowed in three years, Konoe advised Hirohito to begin negotiations to end the war. According to Grand Chamberlain Hisanori Fujita, Hirohito, still looking for a &quot;tennozan&quot; (a great victory) in order to provide a stronger bargaining position, firmly rejected Konoe&#x27;s recommendation.

With each passing week victory became less likely. In April, the Soviet Union issued notice that it would not renew its neutrality agreement. Japan&#x27;s ally Germany surrendered in early May 1945. In June, the cabinet reassessed the war strategy, only to decide more firmly than ever on a fight to the last man. This strategy was officially affirmed at a brief Imperial Council meeting, at which, as was normal, Hirohito did not speak.

The following day, Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal Kōichi Kido prepared a draft document which summarized the hopeless military situation and proposed a negotiated settlement. Extremists in Japan were also calling for a death-before-dishonor mass suicide, modeled on the &quot;47 Ronin&quot; incident. By mid-June 1945, the cabinet had agreed to approach the Soviet Union to act as a mediator for a negotiated surrender but not before Japan&#x27;s bargaining position had been improved by repulse of the anticipated Allied invasion of mainland Japan.

On 22 June, Hirohito met with his ministers saying, &quot;I desire that concrete plans to end the war, unhampered by existing policy, be speedily studied and that efforts be made to implement them.&quot; The attempt to negotiate a peace via the Soviet Union came to nothing. There was always the threat that extremists would carry out a coup or foment other violence. On 26 July 1945, the Allies issued the Potsdam Declaration demanding unconditional surrender. The Japanese government council, the Big Six, considered that option and recommended to Hirohito that it be accepted only if one to four conditions were agreed upon, including a guarantee of Hirohito&#x27;s continued position in Japanese society.

That changed after the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and the Soviet declaration of war. On 9 August, Emperor Hirohito told Kōichi Kido: &quot;The Soviet Union has declared war and today began hostilities against us.&quot; On 10 August, the cabinet drafted an &quot;Imperial Rescript ending the War&quot; following Hirohito&#x27;s indications that the declaration did not compromise any demand which prejudiced his prerogatives as a sovereign ruler.

On 12 August 1945, Hirohito informed the imperial family of his decision to surrender. One of his uncles, Prince Yasuhiko Asaka, asked whether the war would be continued if the &quot;kokutai&quot; (national polity) could not be preserved. Hirohito simply replied &quot;Of course.&quot; On 14 August, Hirohito made the decision to surrender &quot;unconditionally&quot; and the Suzuki government notified the Allies that it had accepted the Potsdam Declaration.

On 15 August, a recording of Hirohito&#x27;s surrender speech was broadcast over the radio (the first time Hirohito was heard on the radio by the Japanese people) announcing Japan&#x27;s acceptance of the Potsdam Declaration. During the historic broadcast Hirohito stated: &quot;Moreover, the enemy has begun to employ a new and most cruel bomb, the power of which to do damage is, indeed, incalculable, taking the toll of many innocent lives. Should we continue to fight, not only would it result in an ultimate collapse and obliteration of the Japanese nation, but also it would lead to the total extinction of human civilization.&quot; The speech also noted that &quot;the war situation has developed not necessarily to Japan&#x27;s advantage&quot; and ordered the Japanese to &quot;endure the unendurable.&quot; The speech, using formal, archaic Japanese, was not readily understood by many commoners. According to historian Richard Storry in &quot;A History of Modern Japan&quot;, Hirohito typically used &quot;a form of language familiar only to the well-educated&quot; and to the more traditional samurai families.

A faction of the army opposed to the surrender attempted a coup d&#x27;état on the evening of 14 August, prior to the broadcast. They seized the Imperial Palace (the Kyūjō incident), but the physical recording of Hirohito&#x27;s speech was hidden and preserved overnight. The coup failed, and the speech was broadcast the next morning.

In his first ever press conference given in Tokyo in 1975, when he was asked what he thought of the bombing of Hiroshima, Hirohito answered: &quot;It&#x27;s very regrettable that nuclear bombs were dropped and I feel sorry for the citizens of Hiroshima but it couldn&#x27;t be helped because that happened in wartime&quot; (&quot;shikata ga nai&quot;, meaning &quot;it cannot be helped&quot;).

=== Postwar reign ===
After the Japanese surrender in August 1945, there was a large amount of pressure that came from both Allied countries and Japanese leftists that demanded Hirohito step down and be indicted as a war criminal. Australia, Britain and 70 percent of the American public wanted Hirohito tried as a Class-A war criminal. General Douglas MacArthur did not like the idea, as he thought that an ostensibly cooperating emperor would help establish a peaceful allied occupation regime in Japan. MacArthur saw Hirohito as a symbol of the continuity and cohesion of the Japanese people. To avoid the possibility of civil unrest in Japan, any possible evidence that would incriminate Hirohito and his family were excluded from the International Military Tribunal for the Far East. MacArthur created a plan that separated Hirohito from the militarists, retained Hirohito as a constitutional monarch but only as a figurehead, and used Hirohito to retain control over Japan to help achieve American postwar objectives in Japan.

As Hirohito appointed his uncle and daughter&#x27;s father-in-law, Prince Naruhiko Higashikuni as the Prime Minister to replace Kantarō Suzuki, who resigned owing to responsibility for the surrender, to assist the American occupation, there were attempts by numerous leaders to have him put on trial for alleged war crimes. Many members of the imperial family, such as Princes Chichibu, Takamatsu, and Higashikuni, pressured Hirohito to abdicate so that one of the Princes could serve as regent until his eldest son, Crown Prince Akihito came of age. On 27 February 1946, Hirohito&#x27;s youngest brother, Prince Mikasa, even stood up in the privy council and indirectly urged Hirohito to step down and accept responsibility for Japan&#x27;s defeat. According to Minister of Welfare Ashida&#x27;s diary, &quot;Everyone seemed to ponder Mikasa&#x27;s words. Never have I seen His Majesty&#x27;s face so pale.&quot;

Before the war crime trials actually convened, the Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers, its International Prosecution Section (IPS) and Japanese officials worked behind the scenes not only to prevent the Imperial family from being indicted, but also to influence the testimony of the defendants to ensure that no one implicated Hirohito. High officials in court circles and the Japanese government collaborated with Allied General Headquarters in compiling lists of prospective war criminals, while the individuals arrested as &quot;Class A&quot; suspects and incarcerated solemnly vowed to protect their sovereign against any possible taint of war responsibility. Thus, &quot;months before the Tokyo tribunal commenced, MacArthur&#x27;s highest subordinates were working to attribute ultimate responsibility for Pearl Harbor to Hideki Tōjō&quot; by allowing &quot;the major criminal suspects to coordinate their stories so that Hirohito would be spared from indictment.&quot; According to John W. Dower, &quot;This successful campaign to absolve Hirohito of war responsibility knew no bounds. Hirohito was not merely presented as being innocent of any formal acts that might make him culpable to indictment as a war criminal, he was turned into an almost saintly figure who did not even bear moral responsibility for the war.&quot; According to Bix, &quot;MacArthur&#x27;s truly extraordinary measures to save Hirohito from trial as a war criminal had a lasting and profoundly distorting impact on Japanese understanding of the lost war.&quot;

Historian Gary J. Bass presented evidence supporting Hirohito&#x27;s responsibility in the war, noting that had he been prosecuted as some judges and others advocated, a compelling case could have been constructed against him. However, the Americans were apprehensive that removing the emperor from power and subjecting him to trial could trigger widespread chaos and collapse of Japan, given his revered status among the Japanese populace. Additionally, the advent of the Cold War brought about harsh political circumstances. Chiang Kai-shek&#x27;s Chinese nationalists were losing the Chinese Civil War to Mao Zedong&#x27;s Chinese Communist Party, prompting the Truman administration to consider the potential loss of China as an ally and strategic partner. As a result, ensuring Japan&#x27;s strength and stability became imperative for securing a reliable postwar ally.

===Imperial status===
Hirohito was not put on trial, but he was forced to explicitly reject the quasi-official claim that Hirohito of Japan was an &quot;arahitogami&quot;, i.e., an incarnate divinity. This was motivated by the fact that, according to the Japanese constitution of 1889, Hirohito had a divine power over his country which was derived from the Shinto belief that the Japanese Imperial Family were the descendants of the sun goddess Amaterasu. Hirohito was however persistent in the idea that the Emperor of Japan should be considered a descendant of the gods. In December 1945, he told his vice-grand-chamberlain Michio Kinoshita: &quot;It is permissible to say that the idea that the Japanese are descendants of the gods is a false conception; but it is absolutely impermissible to call the idea that the Emperor is a descendant of the gods.&quot; In any case, the &quot;renunciation of divinity&quot; was noted more by foreigners than by Japanese, and seems to have been intended for the consumption of the former. The theory of a constitutional monarchy had already had some proponents in Japan. In 1935, when Tatsukichi Minobe advocated the theory that sovereignty resides in the state, of which the Emperor is just an organ (the &quot;tennō kikan setsu&quot;), it caused a furor. He was forced to resign from the House of Peers and his post at the Tokyo Imperial University, his books were banned, and an attempt was made on his life. Not until 1946 was the tremendous step made to alter the Emperor&#x27;s title from &quot;imperial sovereign&quot; to &quot;constitutional monarch.&quot;

Although the Emperor had supposedly repudiated claims to divinity, his public position was deliberately left vague, partly because General MacArthur thought him probable to be a useful partner to get the Japanese to accept the occupation and partly owing to behind-the-scenes maneuvering by Shigeru Yoshida to thwart attempts to cast him as a European-style monarch.

Nevertheless, Hirohito&#x27;s status as a limited constitutional monarch was formalized with the enactment of the 1947 constitution–officially, an amendment to the Meiji Constitution. It defined the Emperor as &quot;the symbol of the state and the unity of the people.&quot; His role was redefined as entirely ceremonial and representative, without even nominal governmental powers. He was limited to performing matters of state as delineated in the Constitution, and in most cases his actions in that realm were carried out in accordance with the binding instructions of the Cabinet. In 1947, Hirohito became the symbol of the State and of the unity of the people under the nation&#x27;s new constitution, which was written by the United States.

Following the Iranian Revolution and the end of the short-lived Central African Empire, both in 1979, Hirohito found himself the last monarch in the world to bear any variation of the highest royal title &quot;emperor.&quot;

===Public figure===
He was not only the first reigning Japanese emperor to visit foreign countries, but also the first to meet an American president. His status and image became strongly positive in the United States.

====Visit to Europe====

The talks between Emperor Hirohito and President Nixon were not planned at the outset, because initially the stop in the United States was only for refueling to visit Europe. However, the meeting was decided in a hurry at the request of the United States. Although the Japanese side accepted the request, Minister for Foreign Affairs Takeo Fukuda made a public telephone call to the Japanese ambassador to the United States Nobuhiko Ushiba, who promoted talks, saying, &quot;that will cause me a great deal of trouble. We want to correct the perceptions of the other party.&quot; At that time, Foreign Minister Fukuda was worried that President Nixon&#x27;s talks with Hirohito would be used to repair the deteriorating Japan–U.S. relations, and he was concerned that the premise of the symbolic emperor system could fluctuate.

There was an early visit with deep royal exchanges in Denmark and Belgium. In France, Hirohito was warmly welcomed, and reunited with Edward VIII, who had abdicated in 1936 and was virtually in exile, and they chatted for a while. However, protests were held in Britain and the Netherlands by veterans who had served in the South-East Asian theatre of World War II and civilian victims of the brutal occupation there. In the Netherlands, raw eggs and vacuum flasks were thrown. The protest was so severe that Empress Nagako, who accompanied the Emperor, was exhausted. In the United Kingdom, protestors stood in silence and turned their backs when Hirohito&#x27;s carriage passed them while others wore red gloves to symbolize the dead. The satirical magazine &quot;Private Eye&quot; used a racist double entendre to refer to Hirohito&#x27;s visit (&quot;nasty Nip in the air&quot;). In West Germany, the Japanese monarch&#x27;s visit was met with hostile far-left protests, participants of which viewed Hirohito as the East Asian equivalent of Adolf Hitler and referred to him as &quot;Hirohitler&quot;, and prompted a wider comparative discussion of the memory and perception of Axis war crimes. The protests against Hirohito&#x27;s visit also condemned and highlighted what they perceived as mutual Japanese and West German complicity in and enabling of the American war effort against communism in Vietnam.

Regarding these protests and opposition, Emperor Hirohito was not surprised to have received a report in advance at a press conference on 12 November after returning to Japan and said that &quot;I do not think that welcome can be ignored&quot; from each country. Also, at a press conference following their golden wedding anniversary three years later, along with the Empress, he mentioned this visit to Europe as his most enjoyable memory in 50 years.

====Visit to the United States====
In 1975, Hirohito and Nagako visited the United States for 14 days from 30 September to 14 October, at the invitation of President Gerald Ford. The visit was the first such event in US–Japanese history. The United States Army, Navy and Air Force, as well as the Marine Corps and the Coast Guard honored the state visit. Before and after the visit, a series of terrorist attacks in Japan were caused by anti-American left-wing organizations such as the East Asia Anti-Japan Armed Front.

After arriving in Williamsburg on 30 September 1975, Emperor Hirohito and Empress Nagako stayed in the United States for two weeks. The official meeting with President Ford occurred on 2 October. On 3 October, Hirohito visited Arlington National Cemetery. On 6 October, Emperor Hirohito and Empress Nagako visited Vice President and Mrs. Rockefeller at their home in Westchester County, New York.

In a speech at the White House state dinner, Hirohito read, &quot;Thanks to the United States for helping to rebuild Japan after the war.&quot; During his stay in Los Angeles, he visited Disneyland, and a smiling photo next to Mickey Mouse adorned the newspapers, and there was talk about the purchase of a Mickey Mouse watch. Two types of commemorative stamps and stamp sheets were issued on the day of their return to Japan which demonstrated that the visit had been a significant undertaking. This was the last visit of Emperor Shōwa to the United States. The official press conference held by the Emperor and Empress before and after their visit also marked a breakthrough.

====Marine biology====

Hirohito was deeply interested in and well-informed about marine biology, and the Tokyo Imperial Palace contained a laboratory from which Hirohito published several papers in the field under his personal name &quot;Hirohito&quot;. His contributions included the description of several dozen species of Hydrozoa new to science.

===Yasukuni Shrine===
Hirohito maintained an official boycott of the Yasukuni Shrine after it was revealed to him that Class-A war criminals had secretly been enshrined after its post-war rededication. This boycott lasted from 1978 until his death and has been continued by his successors, Akihito and Naruhito.

On 20 July 2006, &quot;Nihon Keizai Shimbun&quot; published a front-page article about the discovery of a memorandum detailing the reason that Hirohito stopped visiting Yasukuni. The memorandum, kept by former chief of Imperial Household Agency Tomohiko Tomita, confirms for the first time that the enshrinement of 14 Class-A war criminals in Yasukuni was the reason for the boycott. Tomita recorded in detail the contents of his conversations with Hirohito in his diaries and notebooks. According to the memorandum, in 1988, Hirohito expressed his strong displeasure at the decision made by Yasukuni Shrine to include Class-A war criminals in the list of war dead honored there by saying, &quot;At some point, Class-A criminals became enshrined, including Matsuoka and Shiratori. I heard Tsukuba acted cautiously.&quot; Tsukuba is believed to refer to Fujimaro Tsukuba, the former chief Yasukuni priest at the time, who decided not to enshrine the war criminals despite having received in 1966 the list of war dead compiled by the government. &quot;What&#x27;s on the mind of Matsudaira&#x27;s son, who is the current head priest?&quot; &quot;Matsudaira had a strong wish for peace, but the child didn&#x27;t know the parent&#x27;s heart. That&#x27;s why I have not visited the shrine since. This is my heart.&quot; Matsudaira is believed to refer to Yoshitami Matsudaira, who was the grand steward of the Imperial Household immediately after the end of World War II. His son, Nagayoshi, succeeded Fujimaro Tsukuba as the chief priest of Yasukuni and decided to enshrine the war criminals in 1978.

==Death and state funeral==


On 22 September 1987, Hirohito underwent surgery on his pancreas after having digestive problems for several months. The doctors discovered that he had duodenal cancer. Hirohito appeared to be making a full recovery for several months after the surgery. About a year later, however, on 19 September 1988, he collapsed in his palace, and his health worsened over the next several months as he suffered from continuous internal bleeding.

The Emperor died at 6:33 am on 7 January 1989 at the age of 87. The announcement from the grand steward of Japan&#x27;s Imperial Household Agency, Shoichi Fujimori, revealed details about his cancer for the first time. Hirohito was survived by his wife, his five surviving children, ten grandchildren, and one great-grandchild.

At the time of his death, he was both the oldest and longest-reigning historical Japanese emperor, as well as the longest-reigning living monarch in the world at that time, a distinction which passed to the Prince of Liechtenstein, Franz Joseph II, until his own death in November of the same year.

The Emperor was succeeded by his eldest son, Akihito (), whose enthronement ceremony was held on 12 November 1990 at the Tokyo Imperial Palace.

Hirohito&#x27;s death ended the Shōwa era. On the next day, 8 January 1989, a new era began: the Heisei era, effective at midnight the following day. From 7 January until 31 January, Hirohito&#x27;s formal appellation was . His definitive posthumous name, , was determined on 13 January and formally released on 31 January by Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita.

On 24 February, Hirohito&#x27;s state funeral was held at the Shinjuku Gyo-en, and unlike that of his predecessor, it was formal but not conducted in a strictly Shinto manner. A large number of world leaders attended the funeral. Hirohito is buried in the Musashi Imperial Graveyard in Hachiōji, Tokyo alongside his late parents, Emperor Taishō and Empress Teimei, and his wife, Empress Nagako, who died in 2000.

== Legacy and honors ==

===Accountability for Japanese war crimes===
The issue of Emperor Hirohito&#x27;s war responsibility is contested. During the war, the Allies frequently depicted Hirohito to equate with Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini as the three Axis dictators. After the war, since the U.S. thought that the retention of the emperor would help establish a peaceful allied occupation regime in Japan, and help the U.S. achieve their postwar objectives, they depicted Hirohito as a &quot;powerless figurehead&quot; without any implication in wartime policies. Starting with the publication of specific archival records in the 1960s and continuing after Hirohito&#x27;s death in 1989, a growing body of evidence and historical studies started to dispute the theory that he was a powerless figurehead. In recent years, the debate over the Emperor&#x27;s role in the war has focused on the exact extent of his involvement in political and military affairs (as it is now widely accepted that he had at least some degree of involvement). 

Historian Peter Wetzler said that: &quot;The debate, however, about Hirohito&#x27;s participation in political and military affairs during the Second World War -whether or not (at first) and to what extent (later)- still continues. It will animate authors for years to come. Now most historians acknowledge that the Emperor was deeply involved, like all nation-state leaders at that time.&quot; 

Jennifer Lind, associate professor of government at Dartmouth College and a specialist in Japanese war memory, states that: &quot;Over the years, these different pieces of evidence have trickled out and historians have amassed this picture of culpability and how he was reflecting on that. This is another piece of the puzzle that very much confirms that the picture that was taking place before, which is that he was extremely culpable, and after the war he was devastated about this.&quot; As new evidence surfaced over the years, historians concluded that he bore at least some amount of culpability for the war&#x27;s outbreak and the crimes perpetrated by Japan&#x27;s military during that period.

====Evidence for wartime culpability====

Historians who point to a higher degree of the Emperor&#x27;s involvement in the war have stated that Hirohito was directly responsible for the atrocities committed by the imperial forces in the Second Sino-Japanese War and in World War II. They have said that he and some members of the imperial family, such as his brother Prince Chichibu, his cousins the princes Takeda and Fushimi, and his uncles the princes Kan&#x27;in, Asaka, and Higashikuni, should have been tried for war crimes. In a study published in 1996, historian Mitsuyoshi Himeta said that the Three Alls policy (&quot;Sankō Sakusen&quot;), a Japanese scorched earth policy adopted in China and sanctioned by Emperor Hirohito himself, was both directly and indirectly responsible for the deaths of &quot;more than 2.7 million&quot; Chinese civilians. In &quot;Hirohito and the Making of Modern Japan&quot;, Herbert P. Bix said the &quot;Sankō Sakusen&quot; far surpassed Nanking Massacre not only in terms of numbers, but in brutality. According to Bix, &quot;[t]hese military operations caused death and suffering on a scale incomparably greater than the totally unplanned orgy of killing in Nanking, which later came to symbolize the war&quot;. While the Nanking Massacre was unplanned, Bix said &quot;Hirohito knew of and approved annihilation campaigns in China that included burning villages thought to harbor guerrillas.&quot; Likewise, in August 2000, the Los Angeles Times reported that top U.S. government officials were fully aware of the emperor&#x27;s intimate role during the war.

According to Yuki Tanaka, Emeritus Research Professor of History at Hiroshima City University, the war records at the Defense Agency National Institute provide evidence that Hirohito was heavily involved in creating war policies. He further stated that Japanese statesmen Kido Kōichi&#x27;s wartime journal undeniably proves that Hirohito had a crucial role in the final decision to wage a war against the Allied nations in December 1941.

According to Francis Pike, Hirohito was deeply engaged in military operations and commissioned a war room beneath the Tokyo Imperial Palace to closely monitor Japan&#x27;s military activities. Pike further noted that the extensive resources required for regular updates to the Emperor often drew complaints from military officials. To celebrate significant military victories, he rode his white horse in parades in front of the Imperial Palace.

According to Peter Wetzler, he was actively involved in the decision to launch the war as well as in other political and military decisions. 

Poison gas weapons, such as phosgene, were produced by Unit 731 and authorized by specific orders given by Hirohito himself, transmitted by the chief of staff of the army. Hirohito authorized the use of toxic gas 375 times during the Battle of Wuhan from August to October 1938. He rewarded Shiro Ishii, who was the head of the medical experimentation unit and Unit 731, with a special service medal.

Prince Mikasa, the younger brother of Hirohito, informed the Yomiuri Shimbun that during 1944, he compiled a thorough report detailing the wartime atrocities perpetrated by Japanese soldiers in China. He clarified that he didn&#x27;t directly discuss the report with Hirohito; however, he added that &quot;when I met with him, I did report on the China situation in bits and pieces.&quot; Additionally, he recalled showing Hirohito a Chinese-produced film depicting Japanese atrocities.

Officially, the imperial constitution, adopted under Emperor Meiji, gave full power to the Emperor. Article 4 prescribed that, &quot;The Emperor is the head of the Empire, combining in Himself the rights of sovereignty, and exercises them, according to the provisions of the present Constitution.&quot; Likewise, according to article 6, &quot;The Emperor gives sanction to laws and orders them to be promulgated and executed,&quot; and article 11, &quot;The Emperor has the supreme command of the Army and the Navy.&quot; The Emperor was thus the leader of the Imperial General Headquarters.

According to Bob Tadashi Wakabayashi of York University, Hirohito&#x27;s authority up to 1945 depended on three elements: 

 First, he was a constitutional monarch subject to legal restrictions and binding conventions, as he has so often stressed. Second, he was supreme commander of Japanese armed forces, though his orders were often ignored and sometimes defied. Third, he wielded absolute moral authority in Japan by granting imperial honors that conveyed incontestable prestige and by issuing imperial rescripts that had coercive power greater than law. [¶] In the postwar era, the Japanese Government, some Japanese historians, and Hirohito himself have downplayed or ignored these second and third elements, where were strongest up to 1945; and they have overemphasized the first, which was weakest. Hirohito was no despot. But he did retain &#x27;absolute&#x27; power in the sense of ultimate and final authority to sanction a particular policy decision by agreeing with it, or to force its reformulation or abandonment by disagreeing with it. When he really wanted to put his foot down, he did –– even to the army.&quot;

Wakabayashi further adds:
...as a matter of course, [Hirohito] wanted to keep what his generals conquered -- though he was less greedy than some of them. None of this should surprise us. Hirohito would no more have granted Korea independence or returned Manchuria to China than Roosevelt would have granted Hawaii independence or returned Texas to Mexico.

Historians such as Herbert Bix, Akira Fujiwara, Peter Wetzler, and Akira Yamada assert that post-war arguments favoring the view that Hirohito was a mere figurehead overlook the importance of numerous &quot;behind the chrysanthemum curtain&quot; meetings where the real decisions were made between the Emperor, his chiefs of staff, and the cabinet. Using primary sources and the monumental work of Shirō Hara as a basis, Fujiwara and Wetzler have produced evidence suggesting that the Emperor actively participated in making political and military decisions and was neither bellicose nor a pacifist but an opportunist who governed in a pluralistic decision-making process. Historian Peter Wetzler states that the emperor was thoroughly informed of military matters, and comensurate with his position and Japanese methods of forming policies, he participated in making political and military decisions as the constitutional emperor of Imperial Japan and head of the imperial house. For his part, American historian Herbert P. Bix maintains that Emperor Hirohito worked through intermediaries to exercise a great deal of control over the military and might have been the prime mover behind most of Japan&#x27;s military aggression during the Shōwa era.

The view promoted by the Imperial Palace and American occupation forces immediately after World War II portrayed Emperor Hirohito as a purely ceremonial figure who behaved strictly according to protocol while remaining at a distance from the decision-making processes. This view was endorsed by Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita in a speech on the day of Hirohito&#x27;s death in which Takeshita asserted that the war &quot;had broken out against [Hirohito&#x27;s] wishes.&quot; Takeshita&#x27;s statement provoked outrage in nations in East Asia and Commonwealth nations such as the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. According to historian Fujiwara, &quot;The thesis that the Emperor, as an organ of responsibility, could not reverse cabinet decision is a myth fabricated after the war.&quot;

According to Yinan He, associate professor of international relations at Lehigh University, allied countries and Japanese leftists demanded the emperor to abdicate and be tried as a war criminal. However, conservative Japanese elites concocted jingoistic myths that exonerated the nation&#x27;s ruling class and downplayed Japan&#x27;s wartime culpability. Such revisionist campaigns depicted the Emperor as a peace-seeking diplomat, while blaming the militarists for hijacking the government and leading the country into a disastrous war. This narrative sought to exonerate the Emperor by shifting responsibility onto a small group of military leaders. Furthermore, numerous Japanese conservative elites lobbied the United States to spare the emperor from war crimes investigations and advocated instead for the prosecution of General Hideki Tojo, who held office as prime minister for most of the Pacific War. This narrative also narrowly focuses on the U.S.–Japan conflict, completely ignores the wars Japan waged in Asia, and disregards the atrocities committed by Japanese troops during the war. Japanese elites created the narrative in an attempt to avoid tarnishing the national image and regain the international acceptance of the country.

 said that post-war Japanese public opinion supporting protection of the Emperor was influenced by United States propaganda promoting the view that the Emperor together with the Japanese people had been fooled by the military.

In the years immediately after Hirohito&#x27;s death, scholars who spoke out against the emperor were threatened and attacked by right-wing extremists. Susan Chira reported, &quot;Scholars who have spoken out against the late Emperor have received threatening phone calls from Japan&#x27;s extremist right wing.&quot; One example of actual violence occurred in 1990 when the mayor of Nagasaki, Hitoshi Motoshima, was shot and critically wounded by a member of the ultranationalist group, Seikijuku. A year before, in 1989, Motoshima had broken what was characterized as &quot;one of [Japan&#x27;s] most sensitive taboos&quot; by asserting that Emperor Hirohito bore responsibility for World War II.

Regarding Hirohito&#x27;s exemption from trial before the International Military Tribunal of the Far East, opinions were not unanimous. Sir William Webb, the president of the tribunal, declared: &quot;This immunity of the Emperor is contrasted with the part he played in launching the war in the Pacific, is, I think, a matter which the tribunal should take into consideration in imposing the sentences.&quot; Likewise, the French judge, Henri Bernard, wrote about Hirohito&#x27;s accountability that the declaration of war by Japan &quot;had a principal author who escaped all prosecution and of whom in any case the present defendants could only be considered accomplices.&quot;

An account from the Vice Interior Minister in 1941, Michio Yuzawa, asserts that Hirohito was &quot;at ease&quot; with the attack on Pearl Harbor &quot;once he had made a decision.&quot;

Since his death in 1989, historians have discovered evidence that prove Hirohito&#x27;s culpability for the war, and that he was not a passive figurehead manipulated by those around him.

====Showa Tenno Dokuhaku Roku====
In December 1990, the Bungeishunjū published the Showa tenno dokuhaku roku (Dokuhaku roku), which recorded conversations Hirohito held with five Imperial Household Ministry officials between March and April 1946, containing twenty-four sections. The Dokuhaku roku recorded Hirohito speaking retroactively on topics arranged chronologically from 1919 to 1946, right before the Tokyo War Crimes Trials.

In Hirohito&#x27;s monologue: It doesn&#x27;t matter much if an incident occurs in Manchuria, as it is rural; however, if something were to happen in the Tientsin-Peking area, Anglo-American intervention would likely worsen and could lead to a clash.

While he could justify the aggression of his military in China&#x27;s northeastern provinces, he lacked confidence in Japan&#x27;s capacity to win a war against the United States and Britain. He was also more aware than his military commanders of Japan&#x27;s vulnerability to an economic blockade by Western powers.

Japan signed the Tripartite Pact in 1940 and another agreement in December 1941 that forbade Japan from signing a separate peace treaty with the United States. In the Dokuhaku roku, Hirohito said:

(In 1941,) we thought we could achieve a draw with the US, or at best win by a six to four margin; but total victory was nearly impossible ... When the war actually began, however, we gained a miraculous victory at Pearl Harbor and our invasions of Malaya and Burma succeeded far quicker than expected. So, if not for this (agreement), we might have achieved peace when we were in an advantageous position.

The passage in the Dokuhaku roku refutes the theory that Hirohito wanted an early conclusion to the war owing to his value for peace. Instead, it provides evidence that he desired its end because of Japan&#x27;s early military victories in Pearl Harbor and Southeast Asia.

In September 1944, Prime Minister Kuniaki Koiso proposed that a settlement and concessions, such as the return of Hong Kong, should be given to Chiang Kai-shek, so that Japanese troops in China could be diverted to the Pacific War. Hirohito rejected the proposal and did not want to give concessions to China because he feared it would signal Japanese weakness, create defeatism at home, and trigger independence movements in occupied countries.

As the war shifted unfavorably for Japan, his sentiments were recorded in the Dokuhaku roku as follows:
 I hoped to give the enemy one good bashing somewhere, and then seize a chance for peace. Yet I didn&#x27;t want to ask for peace before Germany did because then we would lose trust in the international community for having violated that corollary agreement.

As the war front progressed northward, Hirohito persistently hoped for the Japanese military to deliver a &quot;good bashing&quot; at some point during the war, which meant securing a decisive victory and then leveraging that success to negotiate the most favorable terms possible for Japan. In the autumn of 1944, he hoped for a victory at Battle of Leyte Gulf, but Japan suffered defeat. On 14 February 1945, Fumimaro Konoe wrote a proposal to Hirohito, urging him to quell extremist elements within the military and end the war. Konoe argued that although surrendering to America might preserve imperial rule, it would not survive a communist revolution he believed was imminent. Hirohito was troubled by the ambiguity surrounding America&#x27;s commitment to upholding imperial rule. He considered the advice of Army Chief of Staff Yoshijirō Umezu, who advocated for continuing the fight to the bitter end, believing that the Americans could be lured into a trap on Taiwan, where they could be defeated. However, the Americans avoided Taiwan. Despite the defeat at the Battle of Okinawa and acknowledging Japan&#x27;s imminent unconditional surrender following this defeat, Hirohito persisted in seeking another battlefield where a &quot;good bashing&quot; could be achieved, considering locations such as Yunnan or Burma.

In August 1945, Hirohito agreed to the Potsdam Declaration because he thought that the American occupation of Japan would uphold imperial rule in Japan.

====Shinobu Kobayashi&#x27;s diary====
Shinobu Kobayashi was the Emperor&#x27;s chamberlain from April 1974 until June 2000. Kobayashi kept a diary with near-daily remarks of Hirohito for 26 years. It was made public on Wednesday 22 August 2018. According to Takahisa Furukawa, a professor of modern Japanese history at Nihon University, the diary reveals that the emperor &quot;gravely took responsibility for the war for a long time, and as he got older, that feeling became stronger.&quot;

Jennifer Lind, associate professor of government at Dartmouth College and a specialist in Japanese war memory said:

An entry dated 27 May 1980 said the Emperor wanted to express his regret about the Sino-Japanese war to former Chinese Premier Hua Guofeng who visited at the time, but was stopped by senior members of the Imperial Household Agency owing to fear of backlash from far right groups.

An entry dated 7 April 1987 said the Emperor was haunted by discussions of his wartime responsibility and, as a result, was losing his will to live.

====Michiji Tajima&#x27;s notes in 1952====
According to notebooks by Michiji Tajima, a top Imperial Household Agency official who took office after the war, Emperor Hirohito privately expressed regret about the atrocities that were committed by Japanese troops during the Nanjing Massacre. In addition to feeling remorseful about his own role in the war, he &quot;fell short by allowing radical elements of the military to drive the conduct of the war.&quot;

====Vice Interior Minister Yuzawa&#x27;s account on Hirohito&#x27;s role in Pearl Harbor raid====
In late July 2018, the bookseller Takeo Hatano, an acquaintance of the descendants of Michio Yuzawa (Japanese Vice Interior Minister in 1941), released to Japan&#x27;s &quot;Yomiuri Shimbun&quot; newspaper a memo by Yuzawa that Hatano had kept for nine years since he received it from Yuzawa&#x27;s family. The bookseller said: &quot;It took me nine years to come forward, as I was afraid of a backlash. But now I hope the memo would help us figure out what really happened during the war, in which 3.1 million people were killed.&quot;

Takahisa Furukawa, expert on wartime history from Nihon University, confirmed the authenticity of the memo, calling it &quot;the first look at the thinking of Emperor Hirohito and Prime Minister Hideki Tojo on the eve of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor.&quot;

In this document, Yuzawa details a conversation he had with Tojo a few hours before the attack. The Vice Minister quotes Tojo saying:


Historian Furukawa concluded from Yuzawa&#x27;s memo:

====Diary of Chief Military Aide-de-Camp Takeji Nara====

The diary of Japanese general Takeji Nara documented Nara&#x27;s interactions with the emperor and described Hirohito&#x27;s reactions to Japan&#x27;s role in instigating the Mukden Incident. Nara&#x27;s diary entries show that Hirohito was well aware of the Mukden Incident and acknowledged that Japanese General Kanji Ishiwara was its instigator. However, once the emperor justified that the army&#x27;s actions in Manchuria as necessary, he gradually adapted to the new circumstances and showed little desire to punish those responsible.

====Hirohito&#x27;s preparations for war described in Saburō Hyakutake&#x27;s diary====
In September 2021, 25 diaries, pocket notebooks and memos by Saburō Hyakutake (Emperor Hirohito&#x27;s Grand Chamberlain from 1936 to 1944) deposited by his relatives to the library of the University of Tokyo&#x27;s graduate schools for law and politics became available to the public.

Hyakutake&#x27;s diary quotes some of Hirohito&#x27;s ministers and advisers as being worried that the Emperor was getting ahead of them in terms of battle preparations.

Thus, Hyakutake quotes Tsuneo Matsudaira, the Imperial Household Minister, saying:

Likewise, Koichi Kido, Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal, is quoted as saying:

Seiichi Chadani, professor of modern Japanese history with Shigakukan University who has studied Hirohito&#x27;s actions before and during the war said on the discovery of Hyakutake&#x27;s diary:


==== Documents that suggest limited wartime responsibility ====
The declassified January 1989 British government assessment of Hirohito describes him as &quot;too weak to alter the course of events&quot; and Hirohito was &quot;powerless&quot; and comparisons with Hitler are &quot;ridiculously wide off the mark.&quot; Hirohito&#x27;s power was limited by ministers and the military and if he asserted his views too much he would have been replaced by another member of the royal family.

Indian jurist Radhabinod Pal opposed the International Military Tribunal and made a 1,235-page judgment. He found the entire prosecution case to be weak regarding the conspiracy to commit an act of aggressive war with brutalization and subjugation of conquered nations. Pal said there is &quot;no evidence, testimonial or circumstantial, concomitant, prospectant, restrospectant, that would in any way lead to the inference that the government in any way permitted the commission of such offenses&quot;. He added that conspiracy to wage aggressive war was not illegal in 1937, or at any point since. Pal supported the acquittal of all of the defendants. He considered the Japanese military operations as justified, because Chiang Kai-shek supported the boycott of trade operations by the Western Powers, particularly the United States boycott of oil exports to Japan. Pal argued the attacks on neighboring territories were justified to protect the Japanese Empire from an aggressive environment, especially the Soviet Union. He considered that to be self-defense operations which are not criminal. Pal said &quot;the real culprits are not before us&quot; and concluded that &quot;only a lost war is an international crime&quot;.

=====The Emperor&#x27;s own statements=====
;8 September 1975 TV interview with NBC, USA
: Reporter: &quot;How far has your Majesty been involved in Japan&#x27;s decision to end the war in 1945? What was the motivation for your launch?&quot;
: Emperor: &quot;Originally, this should be done by the Cabinet. I heard the results, but at the last meeting I asked for a decision. I decided to end the war on my own. (...) I thought that the continuation of the war would only bring more misery to the people.&quot;
;Interview with &quot;Newsweek&quot;, USA, 20 September 1975
: Reporter: &quot;(Abbreviation) How do you answer those who claim that your Majesty was also involved in the decision-making process that led Japan to start the war?&quot;
: Emperor: &quot;(Omission) At the start of the war, a cabinet decision was made, and I could not reverse that decision. We believe this is consistent with the provisions of the Imperial Constitution.&quot;
;22 September 1975 – Press conference with Foreign Correspondents
: Reporter: &quot;How long before the attack on Pearl Harbor did your Majesty know about the attack plan? And did you approve the plan?&quot;
: Emperor: &quot;It is true that I had received information on military operations in advance. However, I only received those reports after the military commanders made detailed decisions. Regarding issues of political character and military command, I believe that I acted in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution.&quot;
;On 31 October 1975, a press conference was held immediately after returning to Japan after visiting the United States.
: Question: &quot;Your majesty, at your White House banquet you said, &#x27;I deeply deplore that unfortunate war.&#x27; (See also .) Does your majesty feel responsibility for the war itself, including the opening of hostilities? Also, what does your majesty think about so-called war responsibility?&quot; (The Times reporter)
: Emperor: &quot;I can&#x27;t answer that kind of question because I haven&#x27;t thoroughly studied the literature in this field, and so don&#x27;t really appreciate the nuances of your words.&quot;
: Question: &quot;How did you understand that the atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima at the end of the war?&quot; (RCC Broadcasting Reporter)
: Emperor: &quot;I am sorry that the atomic bomb was dropped, but because of this war, I feel sorry for the citizens of Hiroshima, but I think it is unavoidable.&quot;
;17 April 1981 Press conference with the presidents of the press
: Reporter: &quot;What was the most enjoyable of your memories of eighty years?&quot;
: Emperor: &quot;Since I saw the constitutional politics of Britain as the , I felt strongly that I must adhere to the constitutional politics. But I was too particular about it to prevent the war. I made my own decisions twice (February 26 Incident and the end of World War II).&quot;

====British government assessment of Hirohito====
A January 1989 declassified British government assessment of Hirohito said the Emperor was &quot;uneasy with Japan&#x27;s drift to war in the 1930s and 1940s but was too weak to alter the course of events.&quot; The dispatch by John Whitehead, former ambassador of the United Kingdom to Japan, to Foreign Secretary Geoffrey Howe was declassified on Thursday 20 July 2017 at the National Archives in London. The letter was written shortly after Hirohito&#x27;s death.
Britain&#x27;s ambassador to Japan John Whitehead stated in 1989:


Whitehead concludes that ultimately Hirohito was &quot;powerless&quot; and comparisons with Hitler are &quot;ridiculously wide off the mark.&quot; If Hirohito acted too insistently with his views he could have been isolated or replaced with a more pliant member of the royal family. The pre-war Meiji Constitution defined Hirohito as &quot;sacred&quot; and all-powerful, but according to Whitehead, Hirohito&#x27;s power was limited by ministers and the military. Whitehead explained after World War II that Hirohito&#x27;s humility was fundamental for the Japanese people to accept the new 1947 constitution and allied occupation.

<text>Emsworth is a town in the Borough of Havant in the county of Hampshire, on the south coast of England near the border with West Sussex. It lies at the north end of an arm of Chichester Harbour, a large and shallow inlet from the English Channel, and is equidistant between Portsmouth and Chichester.

Emsworth had a population of 10,269 at the 2021 Census. The town has a basin for yachts and fishing boats, which fills at high tide and can be emptied through a sluice at low tide. In geodemographic segmentation the town is the heart of the Emsworth (cross-county) built-up area, the remainder of which is Westbourne, Southbourne and Nutbourne. The area had a combined population of 18,777 in 2011, with a density of 30.5 people per hectare, and shares two railway stations.

==Etymology==
According to Richard Coates the meaning of Emsworth is derived from the Old English , which translates as &#x27;Æmmele&#x27;s curtilage&#x27;. Similarly, Eilert Ekwall says that &quot;Emsworth&quot; was derived from &quot;Amils worth&quot;, with &quot;worth&quot; meaning the fence around the property (owned by Amil).

It is popularly thought that Emsworth derived its name from the River Ems, but this is not true; before the 16th century the stream was actually called the Bourne. The river was renamed by the 16th century chronicler Raphael Holinshed:

Holinshed writes that the Emille flows in to the sea at Emilswort or Emmesworth. Therefore, it appears that the river was named after Emsworth and not the other way round.

==History==

===Pre-Roman===

In prehistoric and early historical times the River Ems was tidal as far as Westbourne and the Westbrook creek reached to Victoria Road, leaving Emsworth almost isolated at high tide. A coastal route developed that led from Hayling Island through Havant and Rowlands Castle to the Downs. A part of the coastal route followed the Portsdown ridgeway and from Chichester to Belmont Hill in Bedhampton probably skirted the heads of the various creeks which entered the harbour, passing through country still covered with the original thick forest of oak and beech.

===Roman===

In Roman times a villa existed to the south of the road to Noviomagus Reginorum in the fields of what is now Warblington Castle Farm. Archaeological finds show that the building was a sizeable brick and stone edifice, with floors paved with red brick and coloured sandstone and a view of the harbour and wooded shores of Hayling Island. The fertile landscape suggests the area to have been under continuous cultivation for 1500–1800 years.

===Anglo-Saxon===
Saxons began settling the area after AD 500. Charters were granted by Kings Æthelstan and Æthelred in AD 935 and AD 980 establishing and confirming the boundaries of Warblington. From AD 980–1066 the manor was held by Godwin, Earl of Wessex and his son Harold Godwinson.

===Medieval===

After the Norman Conquest, the Manor of Warblington was given to Roger de Montgomery, Earl of Shrewsbury as part of the manor of Westbourne. The Domesday Book lists the latter with two churches, a mill, 29 families and two slaves (about 120 people). There were also seven plough teams, indicating about 850 acres of land under cultivation.

The first recorded mention of Emsworth as a separate entity was in AD 1216, when King John divided the manor of Warblington, accepting annual rent of &#x27;a pair of gilt spurs yearly&#x27; from William Aguillon for land at &quot;Emelsworth&quot;. In AD 1239, Henry III granted the town a weekly market on Wednesdays and an annual fair on 7 July. The town was mentioned in a patent roll of a hospital in the Hermitage area in AD 1251.

In AD 1341 Emsworth was designated as one of five English towns required to provide a ship for defence of the Channel Islands. It was designated as a customs landing for Chichester in AD 1346 and in AD 1348 was investigated by a special commission for smuggling.

===18th and 19th centuries===

During the 18th and 19th centuries, Emsworth was still a port. Emsworth was known for shipbuilding, boat building and rope making. Grain from the area was ground into flour by tidal mills and transported by ship to places such as London and Portsmouth. Timber from the area was also exported in the 18th and 19th centuries. The River Ems, which is named after the town (not, as often believed, the town being named after the river), flows into the Slipper millpond. The mill itself is now used as offices.

In the 19th century Emsworth had as many as 30 pubs and beer houses; today, only nine remain.

At the beginning of the 19th century, Emsworth had a population of less than 1,200 but it was still considered a large village for the time. By the end of the 18th century, it became fashionable for wealthy people to spend the summer by the sea. In 1805 a bathing house was built where people could have a bath in seawater.

St Peter&#x27;s Chapel was completed in 1790, later becoming Emsworth Town Hall. The parish Church of St James was built in 1840 to a design by John Elliott. It was expanded in the late 1850s this time to a design by John Colson. Colson&#x27;s designs were again used in an expansion of 1865. A final round of building took place in the early 1890s this time to a design by Arthur Blomfield. The reredos added in the 1920s features a painting by Percy George Bentham.

Queen Victoria visited Emsworth in 1842, resulting in Queen Street and Victoria Road being named after her. In 1847 the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway (now the West Coastway line) came to Emsworth, with a railway station built to serve the town.

Hollybank House to the north of the town was built in 1825 and is now a hotel.

Emsworth became part of Warblington Urban District which held its first meeting in 1895. The Urban District was abolished in 1932. Emsworth subsequently became part of Havant Urban District.

===Modern===
By 1901 the population of Emsworth was about 2,000. It grew rapidly during the 20th century to about 5,000 by the middle of the century. In 1906 construction began on the post office, with local cricketer George Wilder laying an inscribed brick. The renamed Emsworth Recreation Ground dates from 1909 and is the current home of Emsworth Cricket Club, which was founded in 1811. Cricket in Emsworth has been played at the same ground, Cold Harbour Lawn, since 1761.

In 1902 the once famous Emsworth oyster industry went into rapid decline. This was after many of the guests at mayoral banquets in Southampton and Winchester became seriously ill and four died after consuming oysters. The infection was due to oysters sourced from Emsworth, as the oyster beds had been contaminated with raw sewage. Fishing oysters at Emsworth was subsequently halted until new sewers were dug, though the industry never completely recovered. J D Foster, an oyster merchant, who had for many years been in occupation of the oyster beds sued Warblington Urban District Council (the owners of the sewers) for nuisance. This was a test case as he could not prove title to the land. However, the Court of Appeal held that Foster had a right to sue, as exclusive occupier of the oyster beds, whether or not he had acquired an interest in the land itself. The judges view was that: 
Foster went on to win his case.

Recently, Emsworth&#x27;s last remaining oyster boat, &quot;The Terror,&quot; was restored and is now sailing again. But the oyster industry is again under threat, because the reproductive rate of the oysters has plunged, as they now contain microscopic glass spicules that are shed into the water from the hulls of the numerous plastic fibreglass boats in Chichester Harbour.

During the Second World War, nearby Thorney Island was used as a Royal Air Force station, playing a role in defence in the Battle of Britain. The north of Emsworth at this time was used for growing flowers and further north was woodland (today Hollybank Woods). In the run up to D-Day, the Canadian Army used these woods as one of their pre-invasion assembly points for men and materiel. Today the foundations of their barracks can still be seen. In the 1960s large parts of this area were developed with a mix of bungalow and terraced housing.

For a few years (2001 to 2007), Emsworth held a food festival. It was the largest event of its type in the UK, with more than 50,000 visitors in 2007. The festival was cancelled due to numerous complaints of disruption to residents and businesses in the proximity.

A Baptist church was constructed in North Street in 2015.

The harbour is now used for recreational sailing, paddle boarding, kayaking and swimming. The town has two sailing clubs, Emsworth Sailing Club (established in 1919) and Emsworth Slipper Sailing Club (in 1921), the latter based at Quay Mill, a former tide mill. Both clubs organise a programme of racing and social events during the sailing season.

==Culture and community==
Emsworth Library was considered for closure in 2020 but following public consultation, was reprieved.

Emsworth Museum is administered by the Emsworth Maritime &amp; Historical Trust.

The town is twinned with Saint-Aubin-sur-Mer in Normandy, France.

There are a large number of community groups in Emsworth and the immediate surrounding area such as cadets, scout and guide groups.

Local landmark Thorney Island is home to a detachment of the Sussex Army Cadet Force, a volunteer youth organisation, sponsored by the Ministry of Defence, which accepts cadets aged between 12 and 18 years of age.

1st Emsworth Scouts meet several times per week with different sections aimed at different age groups and abilities.

In 2014 retired Royal Navy Captain Clifford &quot;John&quot; Caughey drove his car into the clubhouse of Emsworth Sailing Club, causing an explosion and requiring thirty firefighters to put out the fire.

==Politics==
The town is part of the Havant constituency, which since the 1983 election has been a Conservative seat. The current Member of Parliament (MP) is Alan Mak MP. The town is represented at Havant Borough Council by councillors Richard Kennet and Lulu Bowerman of the Conservative Party and Grainne Rason of the Green Party. The local Hampshire County Councillor is Lulu Bowerman. The town has branches of the Conservative Party, Liberal Democrats, the Labour Party, the United Kingdom Independence Party and the Green Party.

==Transport==
Emsworth railway station is on the West Coastway Line. It has services that run to Portsmouth, Southampton, Brighton and London Victoria.

Stagecoach South operates the Coastliner 700 which runs between Chichester and Portsmouth

 Havant Borough Council claims local bus services are provided by Emsworth &amp; District, First and Stagecoach.
