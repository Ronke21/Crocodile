<text>Roman Britain was the territory that became the Roman province of &quot;Britannia&quot; after the Roman conquest of Britain, consisting of a large part of the island of Great Britain. The occupation lasted from AD 43 to AD 410.

Julius Caesar invaded Britain in 55 and 54 BC as part of his Gallic Wars. According to Caesar, the Britons had been overrun or culturally assimilated by the Belgae during the British Iron Age and had been aiding Caesar&#x27;s enemies. The Belgae were the only Celtic tribe to cross the sea into Britain, for to all other Celtic tribes this land was unknown. He received tribute, installed the friendly king Mandubracius over the Trinovantes, and returned to Gaul. Planned invasions under Augustus were called off in 34, 27, and 25 BC. In 40 AD, Caligula assembled 200,000 men at the Channel on the continent, only to have them gather seashells () according to Suetonius, perhaps as a symbolic gesture to proclaim Caligula&#x27;s victory over the sea. Three years later, Claudius directed four legions to invade Britain and restore the exiled king Verica over the Atrebates. The Romans defeated the Catuvellauni, and then organized their conquests as the province of Britain. By 47 AD, the Romans held the lands southeast of the Fosse Way. Control over Wales was delayed by reverses and the effects of Boudica&#x27;s uprising, but the Romans expanded steadily northwards.

The conquest of Britain continued under command of Gnaeus Julius Agricola (77–84), who expanded the Roman Empire as far as Caledonia. In mid-84 AD, Agricola faced the armies of the Caledonians, led by Calgacus, at the Battle of Mons Graupius. Battle casualties were estimated by Tacitus to be upwards of 10,000 on the Caledonian side and about 360 on the Roman side. The bloodbath at Mons Graupius concluded the forty-year conquest of Britain, a period that possibly saw between 100,000 and 250,000 Britons killed. In the context of pre-industrial warfare and of a total population of Britain of , these are very high figures.

Under the 2nd-century emperors Hadrian and Antoninus Pius, two walls were built to defend the Roman province from the Caledonians, whose realms in the Scottish Highlands were never controlled. Around 197 AD, the Severan Reforms divided Britain into two provinces: Britannia Superior and Britannia Inferior. In the early fourth century, Britannia was divided into four provinces under the direction of a vicarius, who administered the , and who was himself under the overall authority of the praetorian prefecture of the Gallic region, based at Trier. A fifth province, Valentia, is attested in the later 4th century. For much of the later period of the Roman occupation, Britannia was subject to barbarian invasions and often came under the control of imperial usurpers and imperial pretenders. The final Roman withdrawal from Britain occurred around 410; the native kingdoms are considered to have formed Sub-Roman Britain after that.

Following the conquest of the Britons, a distinctive Romano-British culture emerged as the Romans introduced improved agriculture, urban planning, industrial production, and architecture. The Roman goddess Britannia became the female personification of Britain. After the initial invasions, Roman historians generally only mention Britain in passing. Thus, most present knowledge derives from archaeological investigations and occasional epigraphic evidence lauding the Britannic achievements of an emperor. Roman citizens settled in Britain from many parts of the Empire.

== History ==
=== Early contact ===
Britain was known to the Classical world. The Greeks, the Phoenicians and the Carthaginians traded for Cornish tin in the 4th century BC. The Greeks referred to the &quot;&quot;, or &quot;tin islands&quot;, and placed them near the west coast of Europe. The Carthaginian sailor Himilco is said to have visited the island in the 6th or 5th century BC and the Greek explorer Pytheas in the 4th. It was regarded as a place of mystery, with some writers refusing to believe it existed.

The first direct Roman contact was when Julius Caesar undertook two expeditions in 55 and 54 BC, as part of his conquest of Gaul, believing the Britons were helping the Gallic resistance. The first expedition was more a reconnaissance than a full invasion and gained a foothold on the coast of Kent but was unable to advance further because of storm damage to the ships and a lack of cavalry. Despite the military failure, it was a political success, with the Roman Senate declaring a 20-day public holiday in Rome to honour the unprecedented achievement of obtaining hostages from Britain and defeating Belgic tribes on returning to the continent.

The second invasion involved a substantially larger force and Caesar coerced or invited many of the native Celtic tribes to pay tribute and give hostages in return for peace. A friendly local king, Mandubracius, was installed, and his rival, Cassivellaunus, was brought to terms. Hostages were taken, but historians disagree over whether any tribute was paid after Caesar returned to Gaul.

Caesar conquered no territory and left no troops behind, but he established clients and brought Britain into Rome&#x27;s sphere of influence. Augustus planned invasions in 34, 27 and 25 BC, but circumstances were never favourable, and the relationship between Britain and Rome settled into one of diplomacy and trade. Strabo, writing late in Augustus&#x27;s reign, claimed that taxes on trade brought in more annual revenue than any conquest could. Archaeology shows that there was an increase in imported luxury goods in southeastern Britain. Strabo also mentions British kings who sent embassies to Augustus, and Augustus&#x27;s own &quot; refers to two British kings he received as refugees. When some of Tiberius&#x27;s ships were carried to Britain in a storm during his campaigns in Germany in 16 AD, they came back with tales of monsters.

Rome appears to have encouraged a balance of power in southern Britain, supporting two powerful kingdoms: the Catuvellauni, ruled by the descendants of Tasciovanus, and the Atrebates, ruled by the descendants of Commius. This policy was followed until 39 or 40 AD, when Caligula received an exiled member of the Catuvellaunian dynasty and planned an invasion of Britain that collapsed in farcical circumstances before it left Gaul. When Claudius successfully invaded in 43 AD, it was in aid of another fugitive British ruler, Verica of the Atrebates.

=== Roman invasion ===
The invasion force in 43 AD was led by Aulus Plautius, but it is unclear how many legions were sent. The &#x27;, commanded by future emperor Vespasian, was the only one directly attested to have taken part. The &#x27;, the &#x27; (later styled &#x27;) and the &#x27; (later styled &#x27;) are known to have served during the Boudican revolt of 60/61, and were probably there since the initial invasion. This is not certain because the Roman army was flexible, with units being moved around whenever necessary. The &quot; may have been permanently stationed, with records showing it at Eboracum (York) in 71 and on a building inscription there dated 108, before being destroyed in the east of the Empire, possibly during the Bar Kokhba revolt.

The invasion was delayed by a troop mutiny until an imperial freedman persuaded them to overcome their fear of crossing the Ocean and campaigning beyond the limits of the known world. They sailed in three divisions, and probably landed at Richborough in Kent; at least part of the force may have landed near Fishbourne, West Sussex.
The Catuvellauni and their allies were defeated in two battles: the first, assuming a Richborough landing, on the river Medway, the second on the river Thames. One of their leaders, Togodumnus, was killed, but his brother Caratacus survived to continue resistance elsewhere. Plautius halted at the Thames and sent for Claudius, who arrived with reinforcements, including artillery and elephants, for the final march to the Catuvellaunian capital, Camulodunum (Colchester). Vespasian subdued the southwest, Cogidubnus was set up as a friendly king of several territories, and treaties were made with tribes outside direct Roman control.

British archaeologist Richard Hingley said that the Roman conquest of Britain, beginning with Julius Caesar&#x27;s expeditions and culminating with the construction of Hadrian&#x27;s Wall, was a drawn-out process rather than an inevitable or swift victory.

=== Establishment of Roman rule ===

After capturing the south of the island, the Romans turned their attention to what is now Wales. The Silures, Ordovices and Deceangli remained implacably opposed to the invaders and for the first few decades were the focus of Roman military attention, despite occasional minor revolts among Roman allies like the Brigantes and the Iceni. The Silures were led by Caratacus, and he carried out an effective guerrilla campaign against Governor Publius Ostorius Scapula. Finally, in 51, Ostorius lured Caratacus into a set-piece battle and defeated him. The British leader sought refuge among the Brigantes, but their queen, Cartimandua, proved her loyalty by surrendering him to the Romans. He was brought as a captive to Rome, where a dignified speech he made during Claudius&#x27;s triumph persuaded the emperor to spare his life. The Silures were still not pacified, and Cartimandua&#x27;s ex-husband Venutius replaced Caratacus as the most prominent leader of British resistance.

On Nero&#x27;s accession, Roman Britain extended as far north as Lindum. Gaius Suetonius Paulinus, the conqueror of Mauretania (modern day Algeria and Morocco), then became governor of Britain, and in 60 and 61 he moved against Mona (Anglesey) to settle accounts with Druidism once and for all. Paulinus led his army across the Menai Strait and massacred the Druids and burnt their sacred groves.

While Paulinus was campaigning in Mona, the southeast of Britain rose in revolt under the leadership of Boudica. She was the widow of the recently deceased king of the Iceni, Prasutagus. The Roman historian Tacitus reports that Prasutagus had left a will leaving half his kingdom to Nero in the hope that the remainder would be left untouched. He was wrong. When his will was enforced, Rome responded by violently seizing the tribe&#x27;s lands in full. Boudica protested. In consequence, Rome punished her and her daughters by flogging and rape. In response, the Iceni, joined by the Trinovantes, destroyed the Roman colony at Camulodunum (Colchester) and routed the part of the IXth Legion that was sent to relieve it. Paulinus rode to London (then called Londinium), the rebels&#x27; next target, but concluded it could not be defended. Abandoned, it was destroyed, as was Verulamium (St. Albans). Between seventy and eighty thousand people are said to have been killed in the three cities. But Paulinus regrouped with two of the three legions still available to him, chose a battlefield, and, despite being outnumbered by more than twenty to one, defeated the rebels in the Battle of Watling Street. Boudica died not long afterwards, by self-administered poison or by illness. During this time, the Emperor Nero considered withdrawing Roman forces from Britain altogether.

There was further turmoil in 69, the &quot;Year of the Four Emperors&quot;. As civil war raged in Rome, weak governors were unable to control the legions in Britain, and Venutius of the Brigantes seized his chance. The Romans had previously defended Cartimandua against him, but this time were unable to do so. Cartimandua was evacuated, and Venutius was left in control of the north of the country. After Vespasian secured the empire, his first two appointments as governor, Quintus Petillius Cerialis and Sextus Julius Frontinus, took on the task of subduing the Brigantes and Silures respectively. Frontinus extended Roman rule to all of South Wales, and initiated exploitation of the mineral resources, such as the gold mines at Dolaucothi.

In the following years, the Romans conquered more of the island, increasing the size of Roman Britain. Governor Gnaeus Julius Agricola, father-in-law to the historian Tacitus, conquered the Ordovices in 78. With the &quot;&quot; legion, Agricola defeated the Caledonians in 84 at the Battle of Mons Graupius, in north-east Scotland. This was the high-water mark of Roman territory in Britain: shortly after his victory, Agricola was recalled from Britain back to Rome and awarded the ornaments of a triumph, before returning to continue as governor. By 87 the decision was taken to abandon most of the land north of the Cheviot Hills allowing for troops to be moved to other frontiers which were under pressure. Tacitus reports Agricola as feeling bitter about this turn of events.

For much of the history of Roman Britain, a large number of soldiers were garrisoned on the island. This required that the emperor station a trusted senior man as governor of the province. As a result, many future emperors served as governors or legates in this province, including Vespasian, Pertinax, and Gordian I.
=== Occupation of and retreat from southern Scotland ===

There is no historical source describing the decades that followed Agricola&#x27;s recall. Even the name of his replacement is unknown. Archaeology has shown that some Roman forts south of the Forth–Clyde isthmus were rebuilt and enlarged; others appear to have been abandoned. By 87 the frontier had been consolidated on the Stanegate. Roman coins and pottery have been found circulating at native settlement sites in the Scottish Lowlands in the years before 100, indicating growing Romanisation. Some of the most important sources for this era are the writing tablets from the fort at Vindolanda in Northumberland, mostly dating to 90–110. These tablets provide evidence for the operation of a Roman fort at the edge of the Roman Empire, where officers&#x27; wives maintained polite society while merchants, hauliers and military personnel kept the fort operational and supplied.

Around 105 there appears to have been a serious setback at the hands of the tribes of the Picts: several Roman forts were destroyed by fire, with human remains and damaged armour at &quot;Trimontium&quot; (at modern Newstead, in SE Scotland) indicating hostilities at least at that site. There is also circumstantial evidence that auxiliary reinforcements were sent from Germany, and an unnamed British war of the period is mentioned on the gravestone of a tribune of Cyrene. Trajan&#x27;s Dacian Wars may have led to troop reductions in the area or even total withdrawal followed by slighting of the forts by the Picts rather than an unrecorded military defeat. The Romans were also in the habit of destroying their own forts during an orderly withdrawal, in order to deny resources to an enemy. In either case, the frontier probably moved south to the line of the Stanegate at the Solway–Tyne isthmus around this time.

A new crisis occurred at the beginning of Hadrian&#x27;s reign (117): a rising in the north which was suppressed by Quintus Pompeius Falco. When Hadrian reached Britannia on his famous tour of the Roman provinces around 120, he directed an extensive defensive wall, known to posterity as Hadrian&#x27;s Wall, to be built close to the line of the Stanegate frontier. Hadrian appointed Aulus Platorius Nepos as governor to undertake this work who brought the &#x27; legion with him from &#x27;. This replaced the famous &quot;&quot;, whose disappearance has been much discussed. Archaeology indicates considerable political instability in Scotland during the first half of the 2nd century, and the shifting frontier at this time should be seen in this context.

In the reign of Antoninus Pius (138–161) the Hadrianic border was briefly extended north to the Forth–Clyde isthmus, where the Antonine Wall was built around 142 following the military reoccupation of the Scottish lowlands by a new governor, Quintus Lollius Urbicus.

The first Antonine occupation of Scotland ended as a result of a further crisis in 155–157, when the Brigantes revolted. With limited options to despatch reinforcements, the Romans moved their troops south, and this rising was suppressed by Governor Gnaeus Julius Verus. Within a year the Antonine Wall was recaptured, but by 163 or 164 it was abandoned. The second occupation was probably connected with Antoninus&#x27;s undertakings to protect the Votadini or his pride in enlarging the empire, since the retreat to the Hadrianic frontier occurred not long after his death when a more objective strategic assessment of the benefits of the Antonine Wall could be made. The Romans did not entirely withdraw from Scotland at this time: the large fort at Newstead was maintained along with seven smaller outposts until at least 180.

During the twenty-year period following the reversion of the frontier to Hadrian&#x27;s Wall in 163/4, Rome was concerned with continental issues, primarily problems in the Danubian provinces. Increasing numbers of hoards of buried coins in Britain at this time indicate that peace was not entirely achieved. Sufficient Roman silver has been found in Scotland to suggest more than ordinary trade, and it is likely that the Romans were reinforcing treaty agreements by paying tribute to their implacable enemies, the Picts.

In 175, a large force of Sarmatian cavalry, consisting of 5,500 men, arrived in Britannia, probably to reinforce troops fighting unrecorded uprisings. In 180, Hadrian&#x27;s Wall was breached by the Picts and the commanding officer or governor was killed there in what Cassius Dio described as the most serious war of the reign of Commodus. Ulpius Marcellus was sent as replacement governor and by 184 he had won a new peace, only to be faced with a mutiny from his own troops. Unhappy with Marcellus&#x27;s strictness, they tried to elect a legate named Priscus as usurper governor; he refused, but Marcellus was lucky to leave the province alive. The Roman army in Britannia continued its insubordination: they sent a delegation of 1,500 to Rome to demand the execution of Tigidius Perennis, a Praetorian prefect who they felt had earlier wronged them by posting lowly equites to legate ranks in Britannia. Commodus met the party outside Rome and agreed to have Perennis killed, but this only made them feel more secure in their mutiny.

The future emperor Pertinax (lived 126–193) was sent to Britannia to quell the mutiny and was initially successful in regaining control, but a riot broke out among the troops. Pertinax was attacked and left for dead, and asked to be recalled to Rome, where he briefly succeeded Commodus as emperor in 192.

=== Third century ===
The death of Commodus put into motion a series of events which eventually led to civil war. Following the short reign of Pertinax, several rivals for the emperorship emerged, including Septimius Severus and Clodius Albinus. The latter was the new governor of Britannia, and had seemingly won the natives over after their earlier rebellions; he also controlled three legions, making him a potentially significant claimant. His sometime rival Severus promised him the title of Caesar in return for Albinus&#x27;s support against Pescennius Niger in the east. Once Niger was neutralised, Severus turned on his ally in Britannia; it is likely that Albinus saw he would be the next target and was already preparing for war.

Albinus crossed to Gaul in 195, where the provinces were also sympathetic to him, and set up at Lugdunum. Severus arrived in February 196, and the ensuing battle was decisive. Albinus came close to victory, but Severus&#x27;s reinforcements won the day, and the British governor committed suicide. Severus soon purged Albinus&#x27;s sympathisers and perhaps confiscated large tracts of land in Britain as punishment. Albinus had demonstrated the major problem posed by Roman Britain. In order to maintain security, the province required the presence of three legions, but command of these forces provided an ideal power base for ambitious rivals. Deploying those legions elsewhere would strip the island of its garrison, leaving the province defenceless against uprisings by the native Celtic tribes and against invasion by the Picts and Scots.

The traditional view is that northern Britain descended into anarchy during Albinus&#x27;s absence. Cassius Dio records that the new Governor, Virius Lupus, was obliged to buy peace from a fractious northern tribe known as the Maeatae. The succession of militarily distinguished governors who were subsequently appointed suggests that enemies of Rome were posing a difficult challenge, and Lucius Alfenus Senecio&#x27;s report to Rome in 207 describes barbarians &quot;rebelling, over-running the land, taking loot and creating destruction&quot;. In order to rebel, of course, one must be a subject – the Maeatae clearly did not consider themselves such. Senecio requested either reinforcements or an Imperial expedition, and Severus chose the latter, despite being 62 years old. Archaeological evidence shows that Senecio had been rebuilding the defences of Hadrian&#x27;s Wall and the forts beyond it, and Severus&#x27;s arrival in Britain prompted the enemy tribes to sue for peace immediately. The emperor had not come all that way to leave without a victory, and it is likely that he wished to provide his teenage sons Caracalla and Geta with first-hand experience of controlling a hostile barbarian land.

An invasion of Caledonia led by Severus and probably numbering around 20,000 troops moved north in 208 or 209, crossing the Wall and passing through eastern Scotland on a route similar to that used by Agricola. Harried by punishing guerrilla raids by the northern tribes and slowed by an unforgiving terrain, Severus was unable to meet the Caledonians on a battlefield. The emperor&#x27;s forces pushed north as far as the River Tay, but little appears to have been achieved by the invasion, as peace treaties were signed with the Caledonians. By 210 Severus had returned to York, and the frontier had once again become Hadrian&#x27;s Wall. He assumed the title &quot;&quot; but the title meant little with regard to the unconquered north, which clearly remained outside the authority of the Empire. Almost immediately, another northern tribe, the Maeatae, went to war. Caracalla left with a punitive expedition, but by the following year his ailing father had died and he and his brother left the province to press their claim to the throne.

As one of his last acts, Severus tried to solve the problem of powerful and rebellious governors in Britain by dividing the province into &#x27; and &#x27;. This kept the potential for rebellion in check for almost a century. Historical sources provide little information on the following decades, a period known as the Long Peace. Even so, the number of buried hoards found from this period rises, suggesting continuing unrest. A string of forts were built along the coast of southern Britain to control piracy; and over the following hundred years they increased in number, becoming the Saxon Shore Forts.

During the middle of the 3rd century, the Roman Empire was convulsed by barbarian invasions, rebellions and new imperial pretenders. Britannia apparently avoided these troubles, but increasing inflation had its economic effect. In 259 a so-called Gallic Empire was established when Postumus rebelled against Gallienus. Britannia was part of this until 274 when Aurelian reunited the empire.

Around the year 280, a half-British officer named Bonosus was in command of the Romans&#x27; Rhenish fleet when the Germans managed to burn it at anchor. To avoid punishment, he proclaimed himself emperor at Colonia Agrippina (Cologne) but was crushed by Marcus Aurelius Probus. Soon afterwards, an unnamed governor of one of the British provinces also attempted an uprising. Probus put it down by sending irregular troops of Vandals and Burgundians across the Channel.

The Carausian Revolt led to a short-lived Britannic Empire from 286 to 296. Carausius was a Menapian naval commander of the Britannic fleet; he revolted upon learning of a death sentence ordered by the emperor Maximian on charges of having abetted Frankish and Saxon pirates and having embezzled recovered treasure. He consolidated control over all the provinces of Britain and some of northern Gaul while Maximian dealt with other uprisings. An invasion in 288 failed to unseat him and an uneasy peace ensued, with Carausius issuing coins and inviting official recognition. In 293, the junior emperor Constantius Chlorus launched a second offensive, besieging the rebel port of Gesoriacum (Boulogne-sur-Mer) by land and sea. After it fell, Constantius attacked Carausius&#x27;s other Gallic holdings and Frankish allies and Carausius was usurped by his treasurer, Allectus. Julius Asclepiodotus landed an invasion fleet near Southampton and defeated Allectus in a land battle.

=== Fourth century government ===


In a reform carried out by 312, the Diocese of Britain was divided into four provinces, &quot;Maxima Caesariensis&quot;, &quot;Flavia Caesariensis&quot;, &quot;Britannia Prima&quot; and &quot;Britannia Secunda&quot;. The diocese was governed by a &quot;vicarius&quot;, and Britain was part of the Gallic region under the overall authority of a praetorian prefect, based at Trier.

The &quot;vicarius&quot; was based at Londinium as the principal city of the diocese. Londinium and Eboracum continued as provincial capitals and the territory was divided up into smaller provinces for administrative efficiency.

Civilian and military authority of a province was no longer exercised by one official, and the governor was stripped of military command, which was handed over to the &quot;Dux Britanniarum&quot; by 314. The governor of a province assumed more financial duties (the procurators of the Treasury ministry were slowly phased out in the first three decades of the 4th century). The Dux was commander of the troops of the Northern Region, primarily along Hadrian&#x27;s Wall, and his responsibilities included protection of the frontier. He had significant autonomy due in part to the distance from his superiors.

The tasks of the &quot;vicarius&quot; were to control and coordinate the activities of governors; monitor but not interfere with the daily functioning of the Treasury and Crown Estates, which had their own administrative infrastructure; and act as the regional quartermaster-general of the armed forces. In short, as the sole civilian official with superior authority, he had general oversight of the administration, as well as direct control, while not absolute, over governors who were part of the prefecture; the other two fiscal departments were not.

The early-4th-century Verona List, the late-4th-century work of Sextus Rufus, and the early-5th-century List of Offices and work of Polemius Silvius all list four provinces by some variation of the names Britannia I, Britannia II, Maxima Caesariensis, and Flavia Caesariensis; all of these seem to have initially been directed by a governor (&quot;praeses&quot;) of equestrian rank. The 5th-century sources list a fifth province named Valentia and give its governor and Maxima&#x27;s a consular rank. Ammianus mentions Valentia as well, describing its creation by Count Theodosius in 369 after the quelling of the Great Conspiracy. Ammianus considered it a re-creation of a formerly lost province, leading some to think there had been an earlier fifth province under another name (may be the enigmatic &quot;Vespasiana&quot;?), and leading others to place Valentia beyond Hadrian&#x27;s Wall, in the territory abandoned south of the Antonine Wall.

Reconstructions of the provinces and provincial capitals during this period partially rely on ecclesiastical records. On the assumption that the early bishoprics mimicked the imperial hierarchy, scholars use the list of bishops for the 314 Council of Arles. The list is patently corrupt: the British delegation is given as including a Bishop &quot;Eborius&quot; of Eboracum and two bishops &quot;from Londinium&quot; (one &#x27; and the other &#x27;). The error is variously emended: Bishop Ussher proposed &quot;Colonia&quot;, Selden &quot;Col.&quot; or &quot;Colon. Camalodun.&quot;, and Spelman &quot;Colonia Cameloduni&quot; (all various names of Colchester); Gale and Bingham offered &#x27; and Henry &#x27; (both Lincoln); and Bishop Stillingfleet and Francis Thackeray read it as a scribal error of &quot;Civ. Col. Londin.&quot; for an original &quot;Civ. Col. Leg. II&quot; (Caerleon). On the basis of the Verona List, the priest and deacon who accompanied the bishops in some manuscripts are ascribed to the fourth province.

In the 12th century, Gerald of Wales described the supposedly metropolitan sees of the early British church established by the legendary SS Fagan and &quot;Duvian&quot;. He placed Britannia Prima in Wales and western England with its capital at &quot;Urbs Legionum&quot; (Caerleon); Britannia Secunda in Kent and southern England with its capital at &quot;Dorobernia&quot; (Canterbury); Flavia in Mercia and central England with its capital at &quot;Lundonia&quot; (London); &quot;Maximia&quot; in northern England with its capital at Eboracum (York); and Valentia in &quot;Albania which is now Scotland&quot; with its capital at St Andrews. Modern scholars generally dispute the last: some place Valentia at or beyond Hadrian&#x27;s Wall but St Andrews is beyond even the Antonine Wall and Gerald seems to have simply been supporting the antiquity of its church for political reasons.

A common modern reconstruction places the consular province of Maxima at Londinium, on the basis of its status as the seat of the diocesan &quot;vicarius&quot;; places Prima in the west according to Gerald&#x27;s traditional account but moves its capital to Corinium of the Dobunni (Cirencester) on the basis of an artifact recovered there referring to Lucius Septimius, a provincial rector; places Flavia north of Maxima, with its capital placed at Lindum Colonia (Lincoln) to match one emendation of the bishops list from Arles; and places Secunda in the north with its capital at Eboracum (York). Valentia is placed variously in northern Wales around Deva (Chester); beside Hadrian&#x27;s Wall around Luguvalium (Carlisle); and between the walls along Dere Street.

=== Fourth century history ===


Emperor Constantius returned to Britain in 306, despite his poor health, with an army aiming to invade northern Britain, the provincial defences having been rebuilt in the preceding years. Little is known of his campaigns with scant archaeological evidence, but fragmentary historical sources suggest he reached the far north of Britain and won a major battle in early summer before returning south. His son Constantine (later Constantine the Great) spent a year in northern Britain at his father&#x27;s side, campaigning against the Picts beyond Hadrian&#x27;s Wall in the summer and autumn. Constantius died in York in July 306 with his son at his side. Constantine then successfully used Britain as the starting point of his march to the imperial throne, unlike the earlier usurper, Albinus.

In the middle of the century, the province was loyal for a few years to the usurper Magnentius, who succeeded Constans following the latter&#x27;s death. After the defeat and death of Magnentius in the Battle of Mons Seleucus in 353, Constantius II dispatched his chief imperial notary Paulus Catena to Britain to hunt down Magnentius&#x27;s supporters. The investigation deteriorated into a witch-hunt, which forced the &#x27; Flavius Martinus to intervene. When Paulus retaliated by accusing Martinus of treason, the &#x27; attacked Paulus with a sword, with the aim of assassinating him, but in the end he committed suicide.

As the 4th century progressed, there were increasing attacks from the Saxons in the east and the Scoti (Irish) in the west. A series of forts had been built, starting around 280, to defend the coasts, but these preparations were not enough when, in 367, a general assault of Saxons, Picts, Scoti and Attacotti, combined with apparent dissension in the garrison on Hadrian&#x27;s Wall, left Roman Britain prostrate. The invaders overwhelmed the entire western and northern regions of Britannia and the cities were sacked. This crisis, sometimes called the Barbarian Conspiracy or the Great Conspiracy, was settled by Count Theodosius from 368 with a string of military and civil reforms. Theodosius crossed from Bononia (Boulogne-sur-Mer) and marched on Londinium where he began to deal with the invaders and made his base. An amnesty was promised to deserters which enabled Theodosius to regarrison abandoned forts. By the end of the year Hadrian&#x27;s Wall was retaken and order returned. Considerable reorganization was undertaken in Britain, including the creation of a new province named Valentia, probably to better address the state of the far north. A new Dux Britanniarum was appointed, Dulcitius, with Civilis to head a new civilian administration.

Another imperial usurper, Magnus Maximus, raised the standard of revolt at Segontium (Caernarfon) in north Wales in 383, and crossed the English Channel. Maximus held much of the western empire, and fought a successful campaign against the Picts and Scots around 384. His continental exploits required troops from Britain, and it appears that forts at Chester and elsewhere were abandoned in this period, triggering raids and settlement in north Wales by the Irish. His rule was ended in 388, but not all the British troops may have returned: the Empire&#x27;s military resources were stretched to the limit along the Rhine and Danube.
Around 396 there were more barbarian incursions into Britain. Stilicho led a punitive expedition.
It seems peace was restored by 399, and it is likely that no further garrisoning was ordered; by 401 more troops were withdrawn, to assist in the war against Alaric I.

=== End of Roman rule ===


The traditional view of historians, informed by the work of Michael Rostovtzeff, was of a widespread economic decline at the beginning of the 5th century. Consistent archaeological evidence has told another story, and the accepted view is undergoing re-evaluation. Some features are agreed: more opulent but fewer urban houses, an end to new public building and some abandonment of existing ones, with the exception of defensive structures, and the widespread formation of &quot;dark earth&quot; deposits indicating increased horticulture within urban precincts. Turning over the basilica at Silchester to industrial uses in the late 3rd century, doubtless officially condoned, marks an early stage in the de-urbanisation of Roman Britain.

The abandonment of some sites is now believed to be later than had been thought. Many buildings changed use but were not destroyed. There was a growing number of barbarian attacks, but these targeted vulnerable rural settlements rather than towns. Some villas such as Chedworth, Great Casterton in Rutland and Hucclecote in Gloucestershire had new mosaic floors laid around this time, suggesting that economic problems may have been limited and patchy. Many suffered some decay before being abandoned in the 5th century; the story of Saint Patrick indicates that villas were still occupied until at least 430. Exceptionally, new buildings were still going up in this period in Verulamium and Cirencester. Some urban centres, for example Canterbury, Cirencester, Wroxeter, Winchester and Gloucester, remained active during the 5th and 6th centuries, surrounded by large farming estates.

Urban life had generally grown less intense by the fourth quarter of the 4th century, and coins minted between 378 and 388 are very rare, indicating a likely combination of economic decline, diminishing numbers of troops, problems with the payment of soldiers and officials or with unstable conditions during the usurpation of Magnus Maximus 383–87. Coinage circulation increased during the 390s, but never attained the levels of earlier decades. Copper coins are very rare after 402, though minted silver and gold coins from hoards indicate they were still present in the province even if they were not being spent. By 407 there were very few new Roman coins going into circulation, and by 430 it is likely that coinage as a medium of exchange had been abandoned. Mass-produced wheel thrown pottery ended at approximately the same time; the rich continued to use metal and glass vessels, while the poor made do with humble &quot;grey ware&quot; or resorted to leather or wooden containers.

=== Sub-Roman Britain ===
Towards the end of the 4th century Roman rule in Britain came under increasing pressure from barbarian attacks. Apparently, there were not enough troops to mount an effective defence. After elevating two disappointing usurpers, the army chose a soldier, Constantine III, to become emperor in 407. He crossed to Gaul but was defeated by Honorius; it is unclear how many troops remained or ever returned, or whether a commander-in-chief in Britain was ever reappointed. A Saxon incursion in 408 was apparently repelled by the Britons, and in 409 Zosimus records that the natives expelled the Roman civilian administration. Zosimus may be referring to the Bagaudae rebellion of the Breton inhabitants of Armorica since he describes how, in the aftermath of the revolt, all of Armorica and the rest of Gaul followed the example of the Brettaniai. A letter from Emperor Honorius in 410 has traditionally been seen as rejecting a British appeal for help, but it may have been addressed to Bruttium or Bologna. With the imperial layers of the military and civil government gone, administration and justice fell to municipal authorities, and local warlords gradually emerged all over Britain, still utilizing Romano-British ideals and conventions. Historian Stuart Laycock has investigated this process and emphasised elements of continuity from the British tribes in the pre-Roman and Roman periods, through to the native post-Roman kingdoms.

In British tradition, pagan Saxons were invited by Vortigern to assist in fighting the Picts, Scoti, and Déisi. (Germanic migration into Roman Britannia may have begun much earlier. There is recorded evidence, for example, of Germanic auxiliaries supporting the legions in Britain in the 1st and 2nd centuries.) The new arrivals rebelled, plunging the country into a series of wars that eventually led to the Saxon occupation of Lowland Britain by 600. Around this time, many Britons fled to Brittany (hence its name), Galicia and probably Ireland. A significant date in sub-Roman Britain is the Groans of the Britons, an unanswered appeal to Aetius, leading general of the western Empire, for assistance against Saxon invasion in 446. Another is the Battle of Deorham in 577, after which the significant cities of Bath, Cirencester and Gloucester fell and the Saxons reached the western sea.

Historians generally reject the historicity of King Arthur, who is supposed to have resisted the Anglo-Saxon conquest according to later medieval legends.

== Trade ==
During the Roman period Britain&#x27;s continental trade was principally directed across the Southern North Sea and Eastern Channel, focusing on the narrow Strait of Dover, with more limited links via the Atlantic seaways. The most important British ports were London and Richborough, whilst the continental ports most heavily engaged in trade with Britain were Boulogne and the sites of Domburg and Colijnsplaat at the mouth of the river Scheldt. During the Late Roman period it is likely that the shore forts played some role in continental trade alongside their defensive functions.

Exports to Britain included: coin; pottery, particularly red-gloss &#x27; (samian ware) from southern, central and eastern Gaul, as well as various other wares from Gaul and the Rhine provinces; olive oil from southern Spain in &#x27;; wine from Gaul in &#x27; and barrels; salted fish products from the western Mediterranean and Brittany in barrels and amphorae; preserved olives from southern Spain in &#x27;; lava quern-stones from Mayen on the middle Rhine; glass; and some agricultural products. Britain&#x27;s exports are harder to detect archaeologically, but will have included metals, such as silver and gold and some lead, iron and copper. Other exports probably included agricultural products, oysters and salt, whilst large quantities of coin would have been re-exported back to the continent as well.

These products moved as a result of private trade and also through payments and contracts established by the Roman state to support its military forces and officials on the island, as well as through state taxation and extraction of resources. Up until the mid-3rd century, the Roman state&#x27;s payments appear to have been unbalanced, with far more products sent to Britain, to support its large military force (which had reached 53,000 by the mid-2nd century), than were extracted from the island.

It has been argued that Roman Britain&#x27;s continental trade peaked in the late 1st century AD and thereafter declined as a result of an increasing reliance on local products by the population of Britain, caused by economic development on the island and by the Roman state&#x27;s desire to save money by shifting away from expensive long-distance imports. Evidence has been outlined that suggests that the principal decline in Roman Britain&#x27;s continental trade may have occurred in the late 2nd century AD, from 165 AD onwards. This has been linked to the economic impact of contemporary Empire-wide crises: the Antonine Plague and the Marcomannic Wars.

From the mid-3rd century onwards, Britain no longer received such a wide range and extensive quantity of foreign imports as it did during the earlier part of the Roman period; vast quantities of coin from continental mints reached the island, whilst there is historical evidence for the export of large amounts of British grain to the continent during the mid-4th century. During the latter part of the Roman period British agricultural products, paid for by both the Roman state and by private consumers, clearly played an important role in supporting the military garrisons and urban centres of the northwestern continental Empire. This came about as a result of the rapid decline in the size of the British garrison from the mid-3rd century onwards (thus freeing up more goods for export), and because of &#x27;Germanic&#x27; incursions across the Rhine, which appear to have reduced rural settlement and agricultural output in northern Gaul.

== Economy ==

Mineral extraction sites such as the Dolaucothi gold mine were probably first worked by the Roman army from c. 75, and at some later stage passed to civilian operators. The mine developed as a series of opencast workings, mainly by the use of hydraulic mining methods. They are described by Pliny the Elder in his &quot;Natural History&quot; in great detail. Essentially, water supplied by aqueducts was used to prospect for ore veins by stripping away soil to reveal the bedrock. If veins were present, they were attacked using fire-setting and the ore removed for comminution. The dust was washed in a small stream of water and the heavy gold dust and gold nuggets collected in riffles. The diagram at right shows how Dolaucothi developed from 75 through to the 1st century. When opencast work was no longer feasible, tunnels were driven to follow the veins. The evidence from the site shows advanced technology probably under the control of army engineers.

The Wealden ironworking zone, the lead and silver mines of the Mendip Hills and the tin mines of Cornwall seem to have been private enterprises leased from the government for a fee. Mining had long been practised in Britain (see Grimes Graves), but the Romans introduced new technical knowledge and large-scale industrial production to revolutionise the industry. It included hydraulic mining to prospect for ore by removing overburden as well as work alluvial deposits. The water needed for such large-scale operations was supplied by one or more aqueducts, those surviving at Dolaucothi being especially impressive. Many prospecting areas were in dangerous, upland country, and, although mineral exploitation was presumably one of the main reasons for the Roman invasion, it had to wait until these areas were subdued.

By the 3rd and 4th centuries, small towns could often be found near villas. In these towns, villa owners and small-scale farmers could obtain specialist tools. Lowland Britain in the 4th century was agriculturally prosperous enough to export grain to the continent. This prosperity lay behind the blossoming of villa building and decoration that occurred between AD 300 and 350.

Britain&#x27;s cities also consumed Roman-style pottery and other goods, and were centres through which goods could be distributed elsewhere. At Wroxeter in Shropshire, stock smashed into a gutter during a 2nd-century fire reveals that Gaulish samian ware was being sold alongside mixing bowls from the Mancetter-Hartshill industry of the West Midlands. Roman designs were most popular, but rural craftsmen still produced items derived from the Iron Age La Tène artistic traditions. Britain was home to much gold, which attracted Roman invaders. By the 3rd century, Britain&#x27;s economy was diverse and well established, with commerce extending into the non-Romanised north.

== Government ==
Under the Roman Empire, administration of peaceful provinces was ultimately the remit of the Senate, but those, like Britain, that required permanent garrisons, were placed under the Emperor&#x27;s control. In practice imperial provinces were run by resident governors who were members of the Senate and had held the consulship. These men were carefully selected, often having strong records of military success and administrative ability. In Britain, a governor&#x27;s role was primarily military, but numerous other tasks were also his responsibility, such as maintaining diplomatic relations with local client kings, building roads, ensuring the public courier system functioned, supervising the &quot; and acting as a judge in important legal cases. When not campaigning, he would travel the province hearing complaints and recruiting new troops.

To assist him in legal matters he had an adviser, the &quot;, and those in Britain appear to have been distinguished lawyers perhaps because of the challenge of incorporating tribes into the imperial system and devising a workable method of taxing them. Financial administration was dealt with by a &quot;procurator&quot; with junior posts for each tax-raising power. Each legion in Britain had a commander who answered to the governor and, in time of war, probably directly ruled troublesome districts. Each of these commands carried a tour of duty of two to three years in different provinces. Below these posts was a network of administrative managers covering intelligence gathering, sending reports to Rome, organising military supplies and dealing with prisoners. A staff of seconded soldiers provided clerical services.

Colchester was probably the earliest capital of Roman Britain, but it was soon eclipsed by London with its strong mercantile connections. The different forms of municipal organisation in Britannia were known as &#x27; (which were subdivided, amongst other forms, into &#x27; such as York, Colchester, Gloucester and Lincoln and &quot;municipalities&quot; such as Verulamium), and were each governed by a senate of local landowners, whether Brythonic or Roman, who elected magistrates concerning judicial and civic affairs. The various &quot;&quot; sent representatives to a yearly provincial council in order to profess loyalty to the Roman state, to send direct petitions to the Emperor in times of extraordinary need, and to worship the imperial cult.

== Demographics ==
Roman Britain had an estimated population between 2.8 million and 3 million people at the end of the second century. At the end of the fourth century, it had an estimated population of 3.6 million people, of whom 125,000 consisted of the Roman army and their families and dependents. The urban population of Roman Britain was about 240,000 people at the end of the fourth century. The capital city of Londinium is estimated to have had a population of about 60,000 people. Londinium was an ethnically diverse city with inhabitants from the Roman Empire, including natives of Britannia, continental Europe, the Middle East, and North Africa. There was also cultural diversity in other Roman-British towns, which were sustained by considerable migration, from Britannia and other Roman territories, including continental Europe, Roman Syria, the Eastern Mediterranean and North Africa. In a study conducted in 2012, around 45 percent of sites investigated dating from the Roman period had at least one individual of North African origin.

=== Town and country ===

During their occupation of Britain, the Romans founded a number of important settlements, many of which survive. The towns suffered attrition in the later 4th century, when public building ceased and some were abandoned to private use. Place names survived the deurbanised Sub-Roman and early Anglo-Saxon periods, and historiography has been at pains to signal the expected survivals, but archaeology shows that a bare handful of Roman towns were continuously occupied. According to S.T. Loseby, the very idea of a town as a centre of power and administration was reintroduced to England by the Roman Christianising mission to Canterbury, and its urban revival was delayed to the 10th century.

Roman towns can be broadly grouped in two categories. &#x27;, &quot;public towns&quot; were formally laid out on a grid plan, and their role in imperial administration occasioned the construction of public buildings. The much more numerous category of &#x27;, &quot;small towns&quot; grew on informal plans, often round a camp or at a ford or crossroads; some were not small, others were scarcely urban, some not even defended by a wall, the characteristic feature of a place of any importance.

Cities and towns which have Roman origins, or were extensively developed by them are listed with their Latin names in brackets; &#x27; are marked C

== Religion ==
=== Pagan ===
The druids, the Celtic priestly caste who were believed to originate in Britain, were outlawed by Claudius, and in 61 they vainly defended their sacred groves from destruction by the Romans on the island of Mona (Anglesey). Under Roman rule the Britons continued to worship native Celtic deities, such as Ancasta, but often conflated with their Roman equivalents, like Mars Rigonemetos at Nettleham.

The degree to which earlier native beliefs survived is difficult to gauge precisely. Certain European ritual traits such as the significance of the number 3, the importance of the head and of water sources such as springs remain in the archaeological record, but the differences in the votive offerings made at the baths at Bath, Somerset, before and after the Roman conquest suggest that continuity was only partial. Worship of the Roman emperor is widely recorded, especially at military sites. The founding of a Roman temple to Claudius at Camulodunum was one of the impositions that led to the revolt of Boudica. By the 3rd century, Pagans Hill Roman Temple in Somerset was able to exist peaceably and it did so into the 5th century.

Pagan religious practices were supported by priests, represented in Britain by votive deposits of priestly regalia such as chain crowns from West Stow and Willingham Fen.

Eastern cults such as Mithraism also grew in popularity towards the end of the occupation. The London Mithraeum is one example of the popularity of mystery religions among the soldiery. Temples to Mithras also exist in military contexts at Vindobala on Hadrian&#x27;s Wall (the Rudchester Mithraeum) and at Segontium in Roman Wales (the Caernarfon Mithraeum).

=== Christianity ===

It is not clear when or how Christianity came to Britain. A 2nd-century &quot;word square&quot; has been discovered in Mamucium, the Roman settlement of Manchester. It consists of an anagram of PATER NOSTER carved on a piece of amphora. There has been discussion by academics whether the &quot;word square&quot; is a Christian artefact, but if it is, it is one of the earliest examples of early Christianity in Britain. The earliest confirmed written evidence for Christianity in Britain is a statement by Tertullian, 200 AD, in which he described &quot;all the limits of the Spains, and the diverse nations of the Gauls, and the haunts of the Britons, inaccessible to the Romans, but subjugated to Christ&quot;. Archaeological evidence for Christian communities begins to appear in the 3rd and 4th centuries. Small timber churches are suggested at Lincoln and Silchester and baptismal fonts have been found at Icklingham and the Saxon Shore Fort at Richborough. The Icklingham font is made of lead, and visible in the British Museum. A Roman Christian graveyard exists at the same site in Icklingham. A possible Roman 4th-century church and associated burial ground was also discovered at Butt Road on the south-west outskirts of Colchester during the construction of the new police station there, overlying an earlier pagan cemetery. The Water Newton Treasure is a hoard of Christian silver church plate from the early 4th century and the Roman villas at Lullingstone and Hinton St Mary contained Christian wall paintings and mosaics respectively. A large 4th-century cemetery at Poundbury with its east–west oriented burials and lack of grave goods has been interpreted as an early Christian burial ground, although such burial rites were also becoming increasingly common in pagan contexts during the period.

The Church in Britain seems to have developed the customary diocesan system, as evidenced from the records of the Council of Arles in Gaul in 314: represented at the council were bishops from thirty-five sees from Europe and North Africa, including three bishops from Britain, Eborius of York, Restitutus of London, and Adelphius, possibly a bishop of Lincoln. No other early sees are documented, and the material remains of early church structures are far to seek. The existence of a church in the forum courtyard of Lincoln and the &quot;&quot; of Saint Alban on the outskirts of Roman Verulamium are exceptional. Alban, the first British Christian martyr and by far the most prominent, is believed to have died in the early 4th century (some date him in the middle 3rd century), followed by Saints Julius and Aaron of Isca Augusta. Christianity was legalised in the Roman Empire by Constantine I in 313. Theodosius I made Christianity the state religion of the empire in 391, and by the 5th century it was well established. One belief labelled a heresy by the church authorities — Pelagianism — was originated by a British monk teaching in Rome: Pelagius lived 354 to 420/440.

A letter found on a lead tablet in Bath, Somerset, datable to c. 363, had been widely publicised as documentary evidence regarding the state of Christianity in Britain during Roman times. According to its first translator, it was written in Wroxeter by a Christian man called Vinisius to a Christian woman called Nigra, and was claimed as the first epigraphic record of Christianity in Britain. This translation of the letter was apparently based on grave paleographical errors, and the text has nothing to do with Christianity, and in fact relates to pagan rituals.

== Environmental changes ==
The Romans introduced a number of species to Britain, including possibly the now-rare Roman nettle (&quot;Urtica pilulifera&quot;), said to have been used by soldiers to warm their arms and legs, and the edible snail &quot;Helix pomatia&quot;. There is also some evidence they may have introduced rabbits, but of the smaller southern mediterranean type. The European rabbit (&quot;Oryctolagus cuniculus&quot;) prevalent in modern Britain is assumed to have been introduced from the continent after the Norman invasion of 1066. Box (&quot;Buxus sempervirens&quot;) is rarely recorded before the Roman period, but becomes a common find in towns and villas.

== Legacy ==
During their occupation of Britain the Romans built an extensive network of roads which continued to be used in later centuries and many are still followed today. The Romans also built water supply, sanitation and wastewater systems. Many of Britain&#x27;s major cities, such as London (Londinium), Manchester (Mamucium) and York (Eboracum), were founded by the Romans, but the original Roman settlements were abandoned not long after the Romans left.

Unlike many other areas of the Western Roman Empire, the current majority language is not a Romance language, or a language descended from the pre-Roman inhabitants. The British language at the time of the invasion was Common Brittonic, and remained so after the Romans withdrew. It later split into regional languages, notably Cumbric, Cornish, Breton and Welsh. Examination of these languages suggests some 800 Latin words were incorporated into Common Brittonic (see Brittonic languages). The current majority language, English, is based on the languages of the Germanic tribes who migrated to the island from continental Europe from the 5th century onwards.

<text>A partial list of Roman place names in Great Britain.

This list includes only names documented from Roman times. For a more complete list including later Latin names, see List of Latin place names in Britain.

The early sources for Roman names show numerous variants and misspellings of the Latin names. Moreover, Ptolemy, one of the principal authorities, wrote in Greek, so names that he records need to be transliterated back into Latin to reveal the original form.

<doc id="13528" wikidata="Q2291130" url="?curid=13528" title="Hemiparesis">
<text>Hemiparesis, also called unilateral paresis, is the weakness of one entire side of the body (&quot;&quot; means &quot;half&quot;). Hemiplegia, in its most severe form, is the complete paralysis of one entire side of the body. Either hemiparesis or hemiplegia can result from a variety of medical causes, including congenital conditions, trauma, tumors, traumatic brain injury and stroke.

==Signs and symptoms==
Different types of hemiparesis can impair different bodily functions. Some effects, such as weakness or partial paralysis of a limb on the affected side, are generally always to be expected. Other impairments can appear, upon external examination, to be unrelated to the limb weakness, but are nevertheless also caused by damage to the affected side of the brain.

===Loss of motor skills===
People with hemiparesis often have difficulties maintaining their balance due to limb paralysis, leading to an inability to properly shift body weight. This makes performing everyday activities, such as dressing, eating, grasping objects, or using the bathroom, more difficult. Hemiparesis with origin in the lower section of the brain creates a condition known as ataxia, a loss of both gross and fine motor skills, which often manifests as a staggering and stumbling gait. Pure motor hemiparesis, a form of hemiparesis characterized by one-sided weakness in the leg, arm, and face, is the most commonly diagnosed form of hemiparesis.

===Pusher syndrome===

Pusher syndrome is a clinical disorder following left- or right-sided brain damage, in which patients actively push their weight away from the non-hemiparetic side to the hemiparetic side. This is in contrast to most stroke patients, who typically prefer to bear more weight on their nonhemiparetic side. Pusher syndrome can vary in severity and leads to a loss of postural balance. The lesion involved in this syndrome is thought to be in the posterior thalamus on either side, or in multiple areas of the right cerebral hemisphere.

A diagnosis of pusher syndrome includes observation of three behaviours. The most obvious one is the patient&#x27;s regularly occurring (not just occasional) tendency to spontaneously hold a body posture in which the torso is longitudinally tilted toward the paretic side of the body. The second is the patient&#x27;s use of the nonparetic extremities including abduction and extension of the extremities of the non-affected side, to help in the push toward the affected (paretic) side, resulting in an abnormal lateral tilt of the body axis. The third is that, when a care provider tries to realign the patient&#x27;s body to an upright posture, the patient spontaneously pushes back against the attempt, feeling this normal posture to be off balance.

The pusher syndrome is present in 10.4% of patients with acute stroke and hemiparesis, and may increase the time needed for physical rehabilitation. The Copenhagen Stroke Study found that patients who presented with ipsilateral pushing took an average of 3.6 additional weeks to reach the same functional outcome, as measured by the Barthel Index, compared with acute-stroke and hemiparesis patients who did not engage in ipsilateral pushing.

Pushing behaviour demonstrates that these patients’ perception of their body posture in relation to gravity has been altered. They experience their body as oriented &quot;upright&quot; when the body is actually tilted to the side of the brain lesion. At the same time, their processing of visual and vestibular inputs when determining the subjective visual vertical seems to be normal. When they are sitting, the pushing presents as a strong lateral lean toward the affected side. When they stand up, the pushing creates a highly unstable situation as they are unable to support their body weight on the weakened lower extremity. The resulting increased risk of falls must be addressed with therapy aimed at correcting their altered proprioceptive perception of vertical.

Pusher syndrome is sometimes confused with hemispatial neglect, and the two terms are sometimes (incorrectly) used interchangeably. Some older theories suggested that hemispatial neglect is what leads to pusher syndrome. However, hemispatial neglect occurs mostly when there is a right-hemisphere lesion, and one study found that pusher syndrome is also present in patients with left hemisphere lesions (which generally also lead to aphasia).

Neglect and aphasia are not the cause of pusher syndrome, although both are highly correlated with it (possibly because the brain structures associated with these syndromes are close to each other).

Physical therapists treating patients with pusher syndrome focus on motor learning strategies that reduce its ill effects, such as the use of verbal cues, consistent feedback, and practice correcting orientation and shifting weight, for example sitting with their stronger side next to a wall and repeatedly leaning towards the wall, thus gradually re-training the brain to recognize true vertical.

A physical-therapy approach for patients with pusher syndrome debuted in 2003 suggests that the visual control of vertical upright orientation, which is undisturbed in these patients, is the most important intervention. In sequential order, treatment is designed to enable patients to realize their altered perception of vertical, use visual aids for feedback about body orientation, learn the movements necessary to reach proper vertical position, and maintain vertical body position while performing other activities.

===Classification of pusher syndrome===
Individuals who present with pusher syndrome or &quot;lateropulsion&quot;, as defined by Davies, vary in their degree and severity of this condition and therefore appropriate measures need to be implemented in order to evaluate the level of &quot;pushing&quot;. There has been a shift towards early diagnosis and evaluation of functional status for individuals who have had a stroke and presenting with pusher syndrome in order to decrease the time spent as an in-patient at hospitals and promote the return to function as early as possible. Moreover, in order to assist therapists in the classification of pusher syndrome, specific scales have been developed with validity that coincides with the criteria set out by Davies&#x27; definition of &quot;pusher syndrome&quot;. In a study by Babyar &quot;et al.&quot;, an examination of such scales helped determine the relevance, practical aspects and clinimetric properties of three specific scales existing today for lateropulsion. The three scales examined were the Clinical Scale of Contraversive Pushing, Modified Scale of Contraversive Pushing, and the Burke Lateropulsion Scale. The results of the study show that reliability for each scale is good; moreover, the Scale of Contraversive Pushing was determined to have acceptable clinimetric properties, and the other two scales addressed more functional positions that will help therapists with clinical decisions and research.

==Causes==
The most common cause of hemiparesis and hemiplegia is stroke. Strokes can cause a variety of movement disorders, depending on the location and severity of the lesion. Hemiplegia is common when the stroke affects the corticospinal tract. Other causes of hemiplegia include spinal cord injury, specifically Brown-Séquard syndrome, traumatic brain injury, or disease affecting the brain. A permanent brain injury that occurs during the intrauterine life, during delivery or early in life can lead to hemiplegic cerebral palsy. As a lesion that results in hemiplegia occurs in the brain or spinal cord, hemiplegic muscles display features of the upper motor neuron syndrome. Features other than weakness include decreased movement control, clonus (a series of involuntary rapid muscle contractions), spasticity, exaggerated deep tendon reflexes and decreased endurance.

The incidence of hemiplegia is much higher in premature babies than term babies. There is also a high incidence of hemiplegia during pregnancy and experts believe that this may be related to either a traumatic delivery, use of forceps or some event which causes brain injury. There is tentative evidence of an association with undiagnosed celiac disease and improvement after withdrawal of gluten from the diet.

Other causes of hemiplegia in adults include trauma, bleeding, brain infections and cancers. Individuals who have uncontrolled diabetes, hypertension or those who smoke have a higher chance of developing a stroke. Weakness on one side of the face may occur and may be due to a viral infection, stroke or a cancer.

===Common causes===
* Vascular: cerebral hemorrhage, stroke, cerebral palsy
* Infective: encephalitis, meningitis, brain abscess, cerebral palsy, spinal epidural abscess, COVID-19
* Neoplastic: glioma, meningioma, brain tumors, spinal cord tumors
* Demyelination: multiple sclerosis, disseminated sclerosis, ADEM, neuromyelitis optica
* Traumatic: cerebral lacerations, subdural hematoma, epidural hematoma, cerebral palsy, vertebral compression fracture
* Iatrogenic: local anaesthetic injections given intra-arterially rapidly, instead of given in a nerve branch.
* Ictal: seizure, Todd&#x27;s paralysis
* Congenital: cerebral palsy, Neonatal-Onset Multisystem Inflammatory Disease (NOMID)
* Degenerative: ALS, corticobasal degeneration
* Parasomnia: sleep paralysis

==Mechanism==
Movement of the body is primarily controlled by the pyramidal (or corticospinal) tract, a pathway of neurons that begins in the motor areas of the brain, projects down through the internal capsule, continues through the brainstem, decussates (or cross midline) at the lower medulla, then travels down the spinal cord into the motor neurons that control each muscle. In addition to this main pathway, there are smaller contributing pathways (including the anterior corticospinal tract), some portions of which do not cross the midline.

Because of this anatomy, injuries to the pyramidal tract above the medulla generally cause contralateral hemiparesis (weakness on the opposite side as the injury). Injuries at the lower medulla, spinal cord, and peripheral nerves result in ipsilateral hemiparesis.

In a few cases, lesions above the medulla have resulted in ipsilateral hemiparesis:
* In several reported cases, patients with hemiparesis from an old &quot;contralateral&quot; brain injury subsequently experienced worsening of their hemiparesis when hit with a second stroke in the &quot;ipsilateral&quot; brain. The authors hypothesize that brain reorganization after the initial injury led to more reliance on uncrossed motor pathways, and when these compensatory pathways were damaged by a second stroke, motor function worsened further.
* A case report describes a patient with a congenitally uncrossed pyramidal tract, who developed right-sided hemiparesis after a hemorrhage in the right brain.

==Diagnosis==
Hemiplegia is identified by clinical examination by a health professional, such as a physiotherapist or doctor. Radiological studies like a CT scan or magnetic resonance imaging of the brain should be used to confirm injury in the brain and spinal cord, but alone cannot be used to identify movement disorders. Individuals who develop seizures may undergo tests to determine where the focus of excess electrical activity is.

Hemiplegia patients usually show a characteristic gait. The leg on the affected side is extended and internally rotated and is swung in a wide, lateral arc rather than lifted in order to move it forward. The upper limb on the same side is also adducted at the shoulder, flexed at the elbow, and pronated at the wrist with the thumb tucked into the palm and the fingers curled around it.

===Assessment tools===
There are a variety of standardized assessment scales available to physiotherapists and other health care professionals for use in the ongoing evaluation of the status of a patient&#x27;s hemiplegia. The use of standardized assessment scales may help physiotherapists and other health care professionals during the course of their treatment plant to:
* Prioritize treatment interventions based on specific identifiable motor and sensory deficits
* Create appropriate short- and long-term goals for treatment based on the outcome of the scales, their professional expertise and the desires of the patient
* Evaluate the potential burden of care and monitor any changes based on either improving or declining scores

Some of the most commonly used scales in the assessment of hemiplegia are:
* The Fugl-Meyer Assessment of sensorimotor function (FMA)

The FMA is often used as a measure of functional or physical impairment following a cerebrovascular accident (CVA). It measures sensory and motor impairment of the upper and lower extremities, balance in several positions, range of motion, and pain. This test is a reliable and valid measure in measuring post-stroke impairments related to stroke recovery. A lower score in each component of the test indicates higher impairment and a lower functional level for that area. The maximum score for each component is 66 for the upper extremities, 34 for the lower extremities, and 14 for balance. Administration of the FMA should be done after reviewing a training manual.
* The Chedoke-McMaster Stroke Assessment (CMSA)
This test is a reliable measure of two separate components evaluating both motor impairment and disability. The disability component assesses any changes in physical function including gross motor function and walking ability. The disability inventory can have a maximum score of 100 with 70 from the gross motor index and 30 from the walking index. Each task in this inventory has a maximum score of seven except for the 2 minute walk test which is out of two. The impairment component of the test evaluates the upper and lower extremities, postural control and pain. The impairment inventory focuses on the seven stages of recovery from stroke from flaccid paralysis to normal motor functioning. A training workshop is recommended if the measure is being utilized for the purpose of data collection.
* The Stroke Rehabilitation Assessment of Movement (STREAM)

The STREAM consists of 30 test items involving upper-limb movements, lower-limb movements, and basic mobility items. It is a clinical measure of voluntary movements and general mobility (rolling, bridging, sit-to-stand, standing, stepping, walking and stairs) following a stroke. The voluntary movement part of the assessment is measured using a 3-point ordinal scale (unable to perform, partial performance, and complete performance) and the mobility part of the assessment uses a 4-point ordinal scale (unable, partial, complete with aid, complete no aid). The maximum score one can receive on the STREAM is a 70 (20 for each limb score and 30 for mobility score). The higher the score, the better movement and mobility is available for the individual being scored.

==Treatment==
Treatment for hemiparesis is the same treatment given to those recovering from strokes or brain injuries. Health care professionals such as physical therapists and occupational therapists play a large role in assisting these patients in their recovery. Treatment is focused on improving sensation and motor abilities, allowing the patient to better manage their activities of daily living. Some strategies used for treatment include promoting the use of the hemiparetic limb during functional tasks, maintaining range of motion, and using neuromuscular electrical stimulation to decrease spasticity and increase awareness of the limb.

At the more advanced level, using constraint-induced movement therapy will encourage overall function and use of the affected limb. Mirror Therapy (MT) has also been used early in stroke rehabilitation and involves using the unaffected limb to stimulate motor function of the hemiparetic limb. Results from a study on patients with severe hemiparesis concluded that MT was successful in improving motor and sensory function of the distal hemiparetic upper limb. Active participation is critical to the motor learning and recovery process, therefore it&#x27;s important to keep these individuals motivated so they can make continual improvements.
Also speech pathologists may work to increase function for people with hemiparesis.

Treatment should be based on assessment by the relevant health professionals, including physiotherapists, doctors and occupational therapists. Muscles with severe motor impairment including weakness need these therapists to assist them with specific exercise, and are likely to require help to do this.

===Medication===
Drugs can be used to treat issues related to the Upper Motor Neuron Syndrome. Drugs like Librium or Valium could be used as a relaxant. Drugs are also given to individuals who have recurrent seizures, which may be a separate but related problem after brain injury.
Intra-muscular injection of botulinum toxin A is used to treat spasticity that is associated with hemiparesis both in cerebral palsy children and stroke in adults. It can be injected into a muscle or more commonly muscle groups of the upper or lower extremities. Botulinum toxin A induces temporary muscle paralysis or relaxation. The main goal of botulinum toxin A is to maintain the range of motion of affected joints and to prevent the occurrence of fixed joint contractures or stiffness. A randomized trial pointed out that individualized homeopathic medication in addition to the standard physiotherapy might have some effect in post-stroke hemiparesis.

===Surgery===
Surgery may be used if the individual develops a secondary issue of contracture, from a severe imbalance of muscle activity. In such cases the surgeon may cut the ligaments and relieve joint contractures. Individuals who are unable to swallow may have a tube inserted into the stomach. This allows food to be given directly into the stomach. The food is in liquid form and instilled at low rates. Some individuals with hemiplegia will benefit from some type of prosthetic device. There are many types of braces and splints available to stabilize a joint, assist with walking and keep the upper body erect.

===Rehabilitation===
Rehabilitation is the main treatment of individuals with hemiplegia. In all cases, the major aim of rehabilitation is to regain maximum function and quality of life. Both physical and occupational therapy can significantly improve the quality of life.

===Physical therapy===
Physical therapy (PT) can help improve muscle strength &amp; coordination, mobility (such as standing and walking), and other physical function using different sensorimotor techniques. Physiotherapists can also help reduce shoulder pain by maintaining shoulder range of motion, as well as using Functional electrical stimulation. Supportive devices, such as braces or slings, can be used to help prevent or treat shoulder subluxation in the hopes to minimize disability and pain. Although many individuals with stroke experience both shoulder pain and shoulder subluxation, the two are mutually exclusive. A treatment method that can be implemented with the goal of helping to regain motor function in the affected limb is constraint-induced movement therapy. This consists of constraining the unaffected limb, forcing the affected limb to accomplish tasks of daily living.

===Occupational therapy===
Occupational therapists may specifically help with hemiplegia with tasks such as improving hand function, strengthening hand, shoulder and torso, and participating in activities of daily living (ADLs), such as eating and dressing. Therapists may also recommend a hand splint for active use or for stretching at night. Some therapists actually make the splint; others may measure your child&#x27;s hand and order a splint. OTs educate patients and family on compensatory techniques to continue participating in daily living, fostering independence for the individual - which may include, environmental modification, use of adaptive equipment, sensory integration, etc.

===Orthotic Intervention===

Orthotic devices are one type of intervention for relieving symptoms of hemiparesis. Commonly called braces, orthotics range from &#x27;off the shelf&#x27; to custom fabricated solutions, but their main goal is alike, to supplement diminished or missing muscle function and joint laxity. A wide range of orthotic treatment can be designed by a Certified Orthotist (C.O.) or Certified Prosthetist Orthotist (C.P.O). Orthotics may be made of metal, plastic, or composite material (such as fiberglass, dyneema (UHMWPE,) carbon fiber; etc.) and design may be changed to address many different conditions.

==Prognosis==
Hemiplegia is not a progressive disorder, except in progressive conditions like a growing brain tumour. Once the injury has occurred, the symptoms should not worsen. However, because of lack of mobility, other complications can occur. Complications may include muscle and joint stiffness, loss of aerobic fitness, muscle spasms, bed sores, pressure ulcers and blood clots.

Sudden recovery from hemiplegia is very rare. Many of the individuals will have limited recovery, but the majority will improve from intensive, specialised rehabilitation. Potential to progress may differ in cerebral palsy, compared to adult acquired brain injury. It is vital to integrate the hemiplegic child into society and encourage them in their daily living activities. With time, some individuals may make remarkable progress.

==Popular culture==
* In Barbara Kingsolver&#x27;s novel, &quot;The Poisonwood Bible&quot;, the character Adah is incorrectly diagnosed, in childhood, as having hemiplegia.
* Rock band HAERTS released an EP called &quot;Hemiplegia&quot; via Columbia Records in 2013.
* In the 1994 Jodie Foster film &quot;Nell&quot;, the title character portrayed by Foster has developed her own language (idioglossia), developed in part due to the distinct speech patterns of her mother, caused by her hemiplegia due to a stroke.
* In the anime series &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam: Iron-Blooded Orphans&quot;, the protagonist Mikazuki Augus is paralyzed in the entire right half of his body after a fierce battle with the Mobile Armor Hashmal.

<text>Henri-Louis Bergson (; ; 18 October 1859 – 4 January 1941) was a French philosopher who was influential in the traditions of analytic philosophy and continental philosophy, especially during the first half of the 20th century until the Second World War, but also after 1966 when Gilles Deleuze published &quot;Le Bergsonisme&quot;. Bergson is known for his arguments that processes of immediate experience and intuition are more significant than abstract rationalism and science for understanding reality.

Bergson was awarded the 1927 Nobel Prize in Literature &quot;in recognition of his rich and vitalizing ideas and the brilliant skill with which they have been presented&quot;. In 1930, France awarded him its highest honour, the Grand-Croix de la Legion d&#x27;honneur. Bergson&#x27;s great popularity created a controversy in France, where his views were seen as opposing the secular and scientific attitude adopted by the Republic&#x27;s officials.

==Biography==

=== Overview ===

Bergson lived the quiet life of a French professor, marked by the publication of his four principal works:

# in 1889, &quot;Time and Free Will&quot; (&quot;Essai sur les données immédiates de la conscience&quot;)
# in 1896, &quot;Matter and Memory&quot; (&quot;Matière et mémoire&quot;)
# in 1907, &quot;Creative Evolution&quot; (&quot;L&#x27;Évolution créatrice&quot;)
# in 1932, &quot;The Two Sources of Morality and Religion&quot; (&quot;Les deux sources de la morale et de la religion&quot;)

In 1900, the Collège de France appointed Bergson Chair of Greek and Roman Philosophy, which he remained until 1904. He then replaced Gabriel Tarde as the Chair of Modern Philosophy until 1920. The public attended his open courses in large numbers.

===Early years ===
Bergson was born in the Rue Lamartine in Paris, not far from the Palais Garnier (the old Paris opera house) in 1859. His father, the composer and pianist Michał Bergson, was of Polish-Jewish background (originally bearing the name &quot;Bereksohn&quot;). His great-grandmother, Temerl Bergson, was a well-known patroness and benefactor of Polish Jewry, especially those associated with the Hasidic movement. His mother, Katherine Levison, daughter of a Yorkshire doctor, was from an English-Jewish and Irish-Jewish background. The Bereksohns were a famous Jewish entrepreneurial family of Polish descent. Henri Bergson&#x27;s great-great-grandfather, , was a prominent banker and a protégé of Stanisław II Augustus, king of Poland from 1764 to 1795.

Bergson&#x27;s family lived in London for a few years after his birth, and he obtained an early familiarity with the English language from his mother. Before he was nine, his parents settled in France, and Henri became a naturalized French citizen.

Bergson married Louise Neuberger, a cousin of Marcel Proust, in 1891. (Proust served as best man at the wedding.) Henri and Louise Bergson had a daughter, Jeanne, born deaf in 1896. Bergson&#x27;s sister, Mina Bergson (also known as Moina Mathers), married the English occult author Samuel Liddell MacGregor Mathers, a founder of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, and the couple later relocated to Paris.

===Education and career===
Bergson attended the Lycée Fontanes (known as the Lycée Condorcet 1870–1874 and 1883–present) in Paris from 1868 to 1878. He had previously received a Jewish religious education, but lost his faith between the ages of 14 and 16. According to Hude (1990), this moral crisis is tied to his discovery of the theory of evolution, according to which humanity shares a common ancestry with modern primates, a process construed as needing no creative deity. 

At the lycée, Bergson won a prize for his scientific work and another, in 1877, when he was 18, for the solution of a mathematical problem. His solution was published the next year in &quot;Nouvelles Annales de Mathématiques.&quot; It was his first published work. After some hesitation about whether to pursue the sciences or the humanities, he decided on the latter, to his teachers&#x27; dismay. When he was 19, he entered the École Normale Supérieure (during this period, he read Herbert Spencer). He obtained there the degree of &quot;licence ès lettres&quot;, and then an &quot;agrégation de philosophie&quot; in 1881 from the University of Paris.

The same year, he received a teaching appointment at the lycée in Angers, the ancient capital of Anjou. Two years later he settled at the in Clermont-Ferrand, capital of the Puy-de-Dôme département.

The year after his arrival at Clermont-Ferrand, Bergson displayed his ability in the humanities by the publication of an edition of extracts from Lucretius, with a critical study of &quot;De Rerum Natura&quot;, issued as &quot;Extraits de Lucrèce&quot;, and of Lucretius&#x27;s materialist cosmology (1884), repeated editions of which attest to its value in promoting Classics among French youth. While teaching and lecturing in this part of his country (the Auvergne region), Bergson found time for private study and original work. He crafted his dissertation, &quot;Time and Free Will&quot;, which was submitted, along with a short Latin thesis on Aristotle (&quot;Quid Aristoteles de loco senserit&quot;, &quot;On the Concept of Place in Aristotle&quot;) for his doctoral degree, which was awarded by the University of Paris in 1889. The work was published in the same year by Félix Alcan. He also gave courses in Clermont-Ferrand on the Pre-Socratics, in particular Heraclitus.

Bergson dedicated &quot;Time and Free Will&quot; to Jules Lachelier (1832–1918), then public education minister, a disciple of Félix Ravaisson and the author of &quot;On the Founding of Induction&quot; (&quot;Du fondement de l&#x27;induction&quot;, 1871). Lachelier endeavoured &quot;to substitute everywhere force for inertia, life for death, and liberty for fatalism&quot;. According to Louis de Broglie, &quot;Time and Free Will&quot; &quot;antedates by forty years the ideas of Niels Bohr and Werner Heisenberg on the physical interpretation of wave mechanics.&quot;

Bergson settled again in Paris in 1888, and after teaching for some months at the municipal college, known as the &quot;College Rollin&quot;, he received an appointment at the Lycée Henri-Quatre, where he remained for eight years. There, he read Darwin and gave a course on his theories. Although Bergson had previously endorsed Lamarckism and its theory of the heritability of acquired characteristics, he came to prefer Darwin&#x27;s hypothesis of gradual variation, which were more compatible with his continual vision of life.

In 1896, Bergson published his second major work, &quot;Matter and Memory&quot;. This rather difficult work investigates the function of the brain and undertakes an analysis of perception and memory, leading up to a careful consideration of the relationship of body and mind. Bergson spent years of research in preparation for each of his three large works. This is especially obvious in &quot;Matter and Memory&quot;, which shows thorough acquaintance with the extensive pathological investigations carried out during the period.

In 1898, Bergson became &quot;maître de conférences&quot; at his alma mater, École Normale Supérieure, and later that year was promoted to a professorship. The year 1900 saw him installed as a professor at the Collège de France, where he accepted the Chair of Greek and Roman Philosophy in succession to .

At the first International Congress of Philosophy, held in Paris during the first five days of August 1900, Bergson read a short paper, &quot;Psychological Origins of the Belief in the Law of Causality&quot; (&quot;Sur les origines psychologiques de notre croyance à la loi de causalité&quot;). In 1900, Felix Alcan published a work that had previously appeared in the &quot;Revue de Paris&quot;, &quot;Laughter&quot; (&quot;Le rire&quot;), one of the most important of Bergson&#x27;s minor works. This essay on the meaning of comedy stemmed from a lecture he had given in his early days in Auvergne. The study of it is essential to an understanding of Bergson&#x27;s views of life, especially its passages dealing with the place of the artistic in life. The paper&#x27;s main thesis is that laughter is a corrective evolved to make social life possible for human beings. People laugh at those who fail to adapt to society&#x27;s demands of society if it seems their failure is akin to an inflexible mechanism. Comic authors have exploited this human tendency to laugh in various ways, and what is common to them is the idea that the comic consists in &quot;something mechanical encrusted on the living&quot;.

In 1901, the Académie des sciences morales et politiques elected Bergson as a member. In 1903 he contributed to the &quot;Revue de métaphysique et de morale&quot; an essay, &quot;Introduction to Metaphysics&quot; (&quot;Introduction à la metaphysique&quot;), which is useful as a preface to the study of his three large books. He detailed in this essay his philosophical program, realized in the &quot;Creative Evolution&quot;.

On the death of Gabriel Tarde, the sociologist and philosopher, in 1904, Bergson succeeded him as Chair of Modern Philosophy. From 4 to 8 September of that year, he visited Geneva, attending the Second International Congress of Philosophy, when he lectured on &quot;The Mind and Thought: A Philosophical Illusion&quot; (Le cerveau et la pensée : une illusion philosophique). An illness prevented his visiting Germany to attend the Third Congress held at Heidelberg. In these years, Bergson strongly influenced Jacques Maritain, perhaps even saving Maritain and his wife Raïssa from suicide.

Bergson&#x27;s third major work, &quot;Creative Evolution&quot;, the most widely known and most discussed of his books, appeared in 1907. Pierre Imbart de la Tour remarked that &quot;Creative Evolution&quot; was a milestone of a new direction in thought. By 1918, Alcan, the publisher, had issued 21 editions, making an average of two editions &quot;per annum&quot; for ten years. Following the appearance of this book, Bergson&#x27;s popularity increased enormously, not only in academic circles but among the general public.

At that time, Bergson had already extensively studied biology, including the theory of fecundation (as shown in the first chapter of the &quot;Creative Evolution&quot;), which had only recently emerged, ca. 1885 – no small feat for a philosopher specializing in the history of philosophy, in particular Greek and Roman philosophy. He also most certainly had read, apart from Darwin, Haeckel, from whom he retained his idea of a unity of life and of the ecological solidarity between all living beings, as well as Hugo de Vries, from whom he quoted his mutation theory of evolution (which he opposed, preferring Darwin&#x27;s gradualism). He also quoted Charles-Édouard Brown-Séquard, the successor of Claude Bernard at the Chair of Experimental Medicine in the Collège de France.

Bergson served as a juror with Florence Meyer Blumenthal in awarding the Prix Blumenthal, a grant given between 1919 and 1954 to painters, sculptors, decorators, engravers, writers, and musicians.

===Relationship with James and pragmatism===
Bergson travelled to London in 1908 and met there with William James, the Harvard University philosopher who was Bergson&#x27;s senior by 17 years, and who was instrumental in calling Bergson&#x27;s work to the attention of the Anglo-American public. The two became great friends. James&#x27;s impression of Bergson is given in his Letters under the date of 4 October 1908:

So modest and unpretending a man but such a genius intellectually! I have the strongest suspicions that the tendency which he has brought to a focus, will end by prevailing, and that the present epoch will be a sort of turning point in the history of philosophy.

As early as 1880, James had contributed an article in French to the periodical &quot;La Critique philosophique&quot;, of Renouvier and Pillon, titled &quot;Le Sentiment de l&#x27;Effort&quot;. Four years later, a couple of articles by him appeared in the journal &quot;Mind&quot;: &quot;What is an Emotion?&quot; and &quot;On some Omissions of Introspective Psychology&quot;. Bergson quoted the first two of these in &quot;Time and Free Will&quot;. In 1890–91 appeared the two volumes of James&#x27;s monumental work &quot;The Principles of Psychology&quot;, in which he refers to a pathological phenomenon Bergson observed. Some writers, taking merely these dates into consideration and overlooking that James&#x27;s investigations had been proceeding since 1870 (registered from time to time by various articles that culminated in &quot;The Principles&quot;), have mistakenly dated Bergson&#x27;s ideas as earlier than James&#x27;s.

William James hailed Bergson as an ally. In 1903, he wrote:
I have been re-reading Bergson&#x27;s books, and nothing that I have read for years has so excited and stimulated my thoughts. I am sure that his philosophy has a great future; it breaks through old frameworks and brings things to a solution from which new crystallizations can be reached.

The most noteworthy tributes James paid to Bergson come in the Hibbert Lectures (A Pluralistic Universe), which James gave at Manchester College, Oxford, shortly after meeting Bergson in London. He remarks on the encouragement he gained from Bergson&#x27;s thought, and refers to his confidence in being &quot;able to lean on Bergson&#x27;s authority&quot;.

Bergson&#x27;s influence had led James &quot;to renounce the intellectualist method and the current notion that logic is an adequate measure of what can or cannot be&quot;. It had induced him, he continued, &quot;to give up logic, squarely and irrevocably&quot; as a method, for he found that &quot;reality, life, experience, concreteness, immediacy, use what word you will, exceeds our logic, overflows, and surrounds it&quot;.

These remarks, which appeared in James&#x27;s book &quot;A Pluralistic Universe&quot; in 1909, impelled many English and American readers to investigate Bergson&#x27;s philosophy, but no English translations of Bergson&#x27;s major work had yet appeared. James encouraged and assisted Arthur Mitchell in preparing an English translation of &quot;Creative Evolution&quot;. In August 1910, James died. It was his intention, had he lived to see the translation finished, to introduce it to the English reading public by a prefatory note of appreciation. The next year, the translation was completed and still greater interest in Bergson and his work ensued. By coincidence, in that same year (1911), Bergson wrote a 16-page preface, &quot;Truth and Reality&quot;, to the French translation of James&#x27;s book &quot;Pragmatism&quot;. In it, he expressed sympathetic appreciation of James&#x27;s work, together with certain important reservations.

From 5 to 11 April, Bergson attended the Fourth International Congress of Philosophy held at Bologna, in Italy, where he gave an address on &quot;Philosophical Intuition&quot;. In response to invitations he visited England in May of that year and on several subsequent occasions. These visits were well received. His speeches offered new perspectives and elucidated many passages in his three major works: &quot;Time and Free Will&quot;, &quot;Matter and Memory&quot;, and &quot;Creative Evolution&quot;. Although necessarily brief statements, they developed and enriched the ideas in his books and clarified for English audiences the fundamental principles of his philosophy.

===Lectures on change===
In May 1911, Bergson gave two lectures, &quot;The Perception of Change&quot; (&quot;La perception du changement&quot;), at the University of Oxford. The Clarendon Press published these in French in the same year. His talks were concise and lucid, leading students and the general reader to his other, longer writings. Oxford later conferred on him the degree of Doctor of Science.

Two days later he delivered the Huxley Lecture at the University of Birmingham, taking for his subject &quot;Life and Consciousness&quot;. This subsequently appeared in &quot;The Hibbert Journal&quot; (October 1911), and, revised, is the first essay in the collected volume &quot;Mind-Energy&quot; (&quot;L&#x27;Énergie spirituelle&quot;). In October he again travelled to England, where he had an enthusiastic reception, and delivered at University College London four lectures on &quot;La Nature de l&#x27;Âme&quot; (The Nature of the Soul).

In 1913, Bergson visited the United States of America at the invitation of Columbia University and lectured in several American cities, where very large audiences welcomed him. In February, at Columbia, he lectured both in French and English, taking as his subjects &quot;Spirituality and Freedom&quot; and &quot;The Method of Philosophy&quot;. Being again in England in May of that year, he accepted the presidency of the British Society for Psychical Research, and delivered to it an address, &quot;Phantoms of Life and Psychic Research&quot; (Fantômes des vivants et recherche psychique).

Meanwhile, his popularity increased, and translations of his work began to appear in a number of languages: English, German, Italian, Danish, Swedish, Hungarian, Polish, and Russian. In 1914 Bergson&#x27;s countrymen honoured him by his election as a member of the Académie française. He was also made President of the Académie des sciences morales et politiques and became Officier de la Légion d&#x27;honneur and Officier de l&#x27;Instruction publique.

Bergson found disciples of many types. In France movements such as neo-Catholicism and Modernism on the one hand and syndicalism on the other endeavoured to absorb and appropriate for their own ends some of his central ideas. The continental organ of socialist and syndicalist theory, &quot;Le Mouvement socialiste&quot;, portrayed the realism of Karl Marx and Pierre-Joseph Proudhon as hostile to all forms of intellectualism, and argued, therefore, that supporters of Marxist socialism should welcome a philosophy such as Bergson&#x27;s. Other writers, in their eagerness, claimed that the thought of the holder of the Chair of Philosophy at the Collège de France and the aims of the &quot;Confédération Générale du Travail&quot; and the Industrial Workers of the World were in essential agreement.

While social revolutionaries endeavoured to make the most out of Bergson, many religious leaders, particularly the more liberal-minded theologians of all creeds, e.g., the Modernists and Neo-Catholic Party in his own country, showed a keen interest in his writings, and many of them found encouragement and stimulus in his work. The Roman Catholic Church, however, banned Bergson&#x27;s three books on the charge of pantheism (that is, of conceiving of God as immanent to his Creation and of being himself created in the process of the Creation). They were placed on the Index of prohibited books (Decree of 1 June 1914).

===Later years===

In 1914, the Scottish universities arranged for Bergson to give the famous Gifford Lectures, planning one course for the spring and another for the autumn. Bergson delivered the first course, consisting of 11 lectures, under the title &quot;The Problem of Personality&quot;, at the University of Edinburgh in the spring of that year. The course of lectures planned for the autumn months had to be abandoned because of the outbreak of war.

Bergson was not silent during the conflict, and gave some inspiring addresses. As early as 4 November 1914, he wrote an article, &quot;Wearing and Nonwearing Forces&quot; (&quot;La force qui s&#x27;use et celle qui ne s&#x27;use pas&quot;), that appeared in a periodical of the &quot;poilus&quot;, &quot;Le Bulletin des Armées de la République Française&quot;. A presidential address, &quot;The Meaning of the War&quot;, was delivered in December 1914 to the Académie des sciences morales et politiques.

Bergson contributed also to the publication arranged by &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; in honour of King Albert I of Belgium, &quot;King Albert&#x27;s Book&quot; (Christmas, 1914). In 1915, he was succeeded in the office of President of the Académie des sciences morales et politiques by Alexandre Ribot, and then delivered a discourse on &quot;The Evolution of German Imperialism&quot;. Meanwhile, he found time to issue at the Minister of Public Instruction&#x27;s request a brief summary of French philosophy. Bergson did a large amount of traveling and lecturing in America during the war. He participated in the negotiations that led to the entry of the United States into the war. He was there when the French Mission under René Viviani paid a visit in April and May 1917 after America&#x27;s entry into the conflict. Viviani&#x27;s book &quot;La Mission française en Amérique&quot; (1917) has a preface by Bergson.

Early in 1918, the Académie française received Bergson officially when he took his seat among &quot;The Select Forty&quot; as successor to Emile Ollivier (the author of the historical work &quot;L&#x27;Empire libéral&quot;). A session was held in January in his honour at which he delivered an address on Ollivier. In the war, Bergson saw the conflict of Mind and Matter, or rather of Life and Mechanism; and thus showed his philosophy&#x27;s central idea in action.

As many of Bergson&#x27;s contributions to French periodicals remained relatively inaccessible, he had them published in two volumes. The first of these was being planned when war broke out. The conclusion of strife was marked by the appearance of a delayed volume in 1919. It bears the title &quot;Spiritual Energy: Essays and Lectures&quot; (reprinted as &quot;Mind-Energy&quot; – &quot;L&#x27;Énergie spirituelle : essais et conférences&quot;). The advocate of Bergson&#x27;s philosophy in England, Wildon Carr, prepared an English translation under the title &quot;Mind-Energy&quot;. The volume opens with the Huxley Memorial Lecture of 1911, &quot;Life and Consciousness&quot;, in a revised and developed form under the title &quot;Consciousness and Life&quot;. Signs of Bergson&#x27;s growing interest in social ethics and in the idea of a future life of personal survival are manifested. The lecture before the Society for Psychical Research is included, as is also the one given in France, &quot;L&#x27;Âme et le Corps&quot;, which contains the substance of the four London lectures on the Soul. The seventh and last article is a reprint of Bergson&#x27;s famous lecture to the Congress of Philosophy at Geneva in 1904, &quot;The Psycho-Physiological Paralogism&quot; (Le paralogisme psycho-physiologique), which now appears as &quot;Le cerveau et la pensée : une illusion philosophique&quot;. Other articles are on the False Recognition, on Dreams, and Intellectual Effort. The volume is a most welcome production and serves to bring together what Bergson wrote on the concept of mental force, and on his view of &quot;tension&quot; and &quot;detension&quot; as applied to the relation of matter and mind.

In June 1920, the University of Cambridge honoured him with the degree of Doctor of Letters. In order that he might devote his full-time to the great new work he was preparing on ethics, religion, and sociology, the Collège de France relieved Bergson of the duties attached to the Chair of Modern Philosophy there. He retained the chair, but no longer delivered lectures, his place being taken by his disciple, the mathematician and philosopher Édouard Le Roy, who supported a conventionalist stance on the foundations of mathematics, which was adopted by Bergson. Le Roy, who also succeeded to Bergson at the Académie française and was a fervent Catholic, extended to revealed truth his conventionalism, leading him to privilege faith, heart and sentiment to dogmas, speculative theology and abstract reasoning. Like Bergson&#x27;s, his writings were placed on the Index by the Vatican.

===Debate with Albert Einstein===
In 1922, Bergson&#x27;s book &quot;Durée et simultanéité, à propos de la théorie d&#x27;Einstein&quot; (&quot;Duration and Simultaneity: Bergson and the Einsteinian Universe&quot;) was published. Earlier that year, Albert Einstein had come to the French Society of Philosophy and briefly replied to a short speech made by Bergson. It has been alleged that Bergson&#x27;s knowledge of physics was insufficient and that the book did not follow up contemporary developments on physics. On the other hand, in &quot;Einstein and the Crisis of Reason&quot;, a leading French philosopher, Maurice Merleau-Ponty, accused Einstein of failing to grasp Bergson&#x27;s argument. This argument, Merleau-Ponty says, which concerns not the physics of special relativity but its philosophical foundations, addresses paradoxes caused by popular interpretations and misconceptions about the theory, including Einstein&#x27;s own. &quot;Duration and Simultaneity&quot; was not published in the 1951 &quot;Edition du Centenaire&quot; in French, which contained all of his other works, and was only published later in a work gathering different essays, titled &quot;Mélanges&quot;. This work took advantage of Bergson&#x27;s experience at the League of Nations, where he presided from 1920 to 1925 over the International Committee on Intellectual Cooperation (the ancestor of UNESCO, and which included Einstein and Marie Curie).

===Later years and death===
While living with his wife and daughter in a modest house in a quiet street near the Porte d&#x27;Auteuil in Paris, Bergson won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1927 for &quot;The Creative Evolution&quot;. Because of serious rheumatic ailments, he could not travel to Stockholm, and sent instead a text subsequently published in &quot;La Pensée et le mouvant&quot;. He was elected a foreign honorary member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1928.

After his retirement from the Collège de France, Bergson began to fade into obscurity: he suffered from a degenerative illness (rheumatism, which left him half paralyzed). He completed his new work, &quot;The Two Sources of Morality and Religion&quot;, which extended his philosophical theories to the realms of morality, religion, and art, in 1932. It was respectfully received by the public and the philosophical community, but by that time Bergson&#x27;s days as a philosophical luminary were past. He was, however, able to reiterate his core beliefs near the end of his life, by renouncing all the posts and honours previously awarded him rather than accept exemption from the antisemitic laws of the Vichy government.

Bergson inclined to convert to Catholicism, writing in his will on 7 February 1937: &quot;My thinking has always brought me nearer to Catholicism, in which I saw the perfect complement to Judaism.&quot; Though wishing to convert to Catholicism, as stated in his will, he did not do so in view of the travails inflicted on the Jewish people by the rise of Nazism and antisemitism in Europe in the 1930s; he did not want to appear to want to leave the persecuted. After the fall of France in 1940, Jews in occupied France were required to register at police stations. When completing his police form, Bergson made the following entry: &quot;Academic. Philosopher. Nobel Prize winner. Jew.&quot; It was the position of the Archbishop of Paris, Emmanuel Célestin Suhard, that the public revelation of Bergson&#x27;s conversion was too dangerous at the time, when the city was occupied by the Nazis, to both the Church and the Jewish population.

On 3 January 1941, Bergson died in occupied Paris of bronchitis. A Roman Catholic priest said prayers at his funeral per his request. Bergson is buried in the Cimetière de Garches, Hauts-de-Seine.

==Philosophy==
Bergson rejected what he saw as the overly mechanistic predominant view of causality (as expressed in reductionism). He argued that free will must be allowed to unfold in an autonomous and unpredictable fashion. While Kant saw free will as something beyond time and space and therefore ultimately a matter of faith, Bergson attempted to redefine the modern conceptions of time, space, and causality in his concept of duration, making room for a tangible marriage of free will with causality. Seeing duration as a mobile and fluid concept, Bergson argued that one cannot understand duration through &quot;immobile&quot; analysis, but only through experiential, first-person intuition.

===Creativity===
Bergson considers the appearance of novelty as a result of pure undetermined creation, instead of as the predetermined result of mechanistic forces. His philosophy emphasizes pure mobility, unforeseeable novelty, creativity and freedom; thus one can characterize his system as a process philosophy. It touches upon such topics as time and identity, free will, perception, change, memory, consciousness, language, the foundation of mathematics and the limits of reason.

Criticizing Kant&#x27;s theory of knowledge exposed in the &quot;Critique of Pure Reason&quot; and his conception of truth – which he compares to Plato&#x27;s conception of truth as its symmetrical inversion (order of nature/order of thought) – Bergson attempted to redefine the relations between science and metaphysics, intelligence and intuition, and insisted on the necessity of increasing thought&#x27;s possibility through the use of intuition, which, according to him, alone approached a knowledge of the absolute and of real life, understood as pure duration. Because of his (relative) criticism of intelligence, he makes frequent use of images and metaphors in his writings in order to avoid the use of concepts, which (he considers) fail to touch the whole of reality, being only a sort of abstract net thrown on things. For instance, he says in &quot;The Creative Evolution&quot; (chap. III) that thought in itself would never have thought it possible for the human being to swim, as it cannot deduce swimming from walking. For swimming to be possible, man must throw himself in water, and only then can thought to consider swimming as possible. Intelligence, for Bergson, is a practical faculty rather than a pure speculative faculty, a product of evolution used by man to survive. If metaphysics is to avoid &quot;false problems&quot;, it should not extend the abstract concepts of intelligence to pure speculation, but rather use intuition.

&quot;The Creative Evolution&quot; in particular attempted to think through the continuous creation of life, and explicitly pitted itself against Herbert Spencer&#x27;s evolutionary philosophy. Spencer had attempted to transpose Charles Darwin&#x27;s theory of evolution in philosophy and to construct a cosmology based on this theory (Spencer also coined the expression &quot;survival of the fittest&quot;). Bergson disputed what he saw as Spencer&#x27;s mechanistic philosophy.

Bergson&#x27;s &quot;Lebensphilosophie&quot; (philosophy of life) can be seen as a response to the mechanistic philosophies of his time, but also to the failure of finalism. Indeed, he considers that finalism is unable to explain &quot;duration&quot; and the &quot;continuous creation of life&quot;, as it only explains life as the progressive development of an initially determined program – a notion which remains, for example, in the expression of a &quot;genetic program&quot;; such a description of finalism was adopted, for instance, by Leibniz.

Bergson regards planning for the future as impossible since time itself unravels unforeseen possibilities. Indeed, one can always explain a historical event retrospectively by its conditions of possibility. But, in the introduction to the &quot;Pensée et le mouvant&quot;, he explains that such an event retrospectively created its causes, taking the example of the creation of a work of art, for example a symphony: it was impossible to predict a future symphony as if the composer knew what symphony would be best and wrote it. In his words, the effect created its cause. Henceforth, he attempted to find a third way between mechanism and finalism through the notion of an original impulse, the &quot;élan vital&quot;, in life, which disperses itself through evolution into contradictory tendencies (he substituted for the finalist notion of a teleological aim the notion of an original impulse).

===Duration===

The foundation of Henri Bergson&#x27;s philosophy, his theory of Duration, he discovered when trying to improve what he saw as the inadequacies of Herbert Spencer&#x27;s philosophy. Bergson introduced Duration as a theory of time and consciousness in his doctoral thesis &quot;Time and Free Will: An Essay on the Immediate Data of Consciousness&quot; as a response to another of his influences: Immanuel Kant.

Kant believed that free will could only exist outside of time and space, indeed the only non-determined aspect of private existence in the universe, separate from water cycles, mathematics and mortality. However, it could therefore not be ascertained whether or not it exists, and that it is nothing but a pragmatic faith. Bergson responded that Kant, along with many other philosophers, had confused time with its spatial representation. In reality, Bergson argued, Duration is unextended yet heterogeneous, and so its parts cannot be juxtaposed as a succession of distinct parts, with one causing the other. Based on this he concluded that determinism is an impossibility and free will pure mobility, which is what Bergson identified as being the Duration. For Bergson, reality is composed of change.

===Intuitionism===

Duration, as defined by Bergson, then is a unity and a multiplicity, but, being mobile, it cannot be grasped through immobile concepts. Bergson hence argues that one can grasp it only through his method of intuition. Two images from Henri Bergson&#x27;s &quot;An Introduction to Metaphysics&quot; may help one to grasp Bergson&#x27;s term intuition, the limits of concepts, and the ability of intuition to grasp the absolute. The first image is that of a city. Analysis, or the creation of concepts through the divisions of points of view, can only ever offer a model of the city through a construction of photographs taken from every possible point of view, yet it can never produce the dimensional value of walking in the city itself. One can only grasp this through intuition; likewise the experience of reading a line of Homer. One may translate the line and pile commentary upon commentary, but this commentary too shall never grasp the simple dimensional value of experiencing the poem in its originality itself. The method of intuition, then, is that of getting back to the things themselves.

===&quot;Élan vital&quot;===
&quot;Élan vital&quot; ranks as Bergson&#x27;s third essential concept, after Duration and intuition. An idea with the goal of explaining evolution, the &quot;élan vital&quot; first appeared in 1907&#x27;s &quot;Creative Evolution&quot;. Bergson portrays &quot;élan vital&quot; as a kind of vital impetus which explains evolution in a less mechanical and more lively manner, as well as accounting for the creative impulse of mankind. This concept led several authors to characterize Bergson as a supporter of vitalism—although he criticized it explicitly in &quot;The Creative Evolution&quot;, as he thought, against Driesch and Johannes Reinke (whom he cited) that there is neither &quot;purely internal finality nor clearly cut individuality in nature&quot;:

Hereby lies the stumbling block of vitalist theories ... It is thus in vain that one pretends to reduce finality to the individuality of the living being. If there is finality in the world of life, it encompasses the whole of life in one indivisible embrace.

===Laughter===
In &quot;&quot;, Bergson develops a theory not of laughter itself but of how laughter can be provoked (see his objection to Delage, published in the 23rd edition of the essay). He describes the process of laughter (refusing to give a conceptual definition which would not approach its reality), used in particular by comics and clowns, as caricature of the mechanistic nature of humans (habits, automatic acts, etc.), one of the two tendencies of life (degradation towards inert matter and mechanism, and continual creation of new forms). However, Bergson warns that laughter&#x27;s criterion of what should be laughed at is not a moral criterion and that it can in fact cause serious damage to a person&#x27;s self-esteem. This essay made his opposition to the Cartesian theory of the animal-machine obvious.

==Reception==
From his first publications, Bergson&#x27;s philosophy attracted strong criticism from different quarters, although he also became very popular and durably influenced French philosophy. The mathematician Édouard Le Roy became Bergson&#x27;s main disciple. Nonetheless, Suzanne Guerlac has argued that his institutional position at the Collège de France, delivering lectures to a general audience, may have retarded the systematic reception of his thought: &quot;Bergson achieved enormous popular success in this context, often due to the emotional appeal of his ideas. But he did not have the equivalent of graduate students who might have become rigorous interpreters of his thought. Thus Bergson&#x27;s philosophy—in principle open and nonsystematic—was easily borrowed piecemeal and altered by enthusiastic admirers&quot;.

According to a 2024 article in Daily Nous, in 1910, Bergson was the most cited philosopher in English academic journals. He was cited more than philosopher Aristotle, Kant, and Hegel.

Alfred North Whitehead acknowledged Bergson&#x27;s influence on his process philosophy in his 1929 &quot;Process and Reality.&quot; However, Bertrand Russell, Whitehead&#x27;s collaborator on &quot;Principia Mathematica&quot;, was not so entranced by Bergson&#x27;s philosophy. Although acknowledging Bergson&#x27;s literary skills, Russell saw Bergson&#x27;s arguments at best as persuasive or emotive speculation but not at all as any worthwhile example of sound reasoning or philosophical insight. The epistemologist Gaston Bachelard explicitly alluded to him in the last pages of his 1938 book &quot;The Formation of the Scientific Mind&quot;. Others influenced by Bergson include Vladimir Jankélévitch, who wrote a book on him in 1931, Pierre Teilhard de Chardin, and Gilles Deleuze who wrote &quot;Le bergsonisme&quot; in 1966. The Greek philosopher Helle Lambridis developed an interest in Bergson early in her career, and after two publications in 1929 - a book that introduced Bergson&#x27;s work to the Greek audience and a translation into Greek of Bergson&#x27;s book &quot;L&#x27;Énergie spirituelle&quot; (1919) - the second part of her &quot;Introduction to Philosophy&quot; I &amp; II (1965) included his philosophical work on the concept of &#x27;time&#x27;, although this part (II) was not published until 2004. Bergson also influenced the phenomenology of Maurice Merleau-Ponty and Emmanuel Levinas, although Merleau-Ponty had reservations about Bergson&#x27;s philosophy. The Greek author Nikos Kazantzakis studied under Bergson in Paris and his writing and philosophy were profoundly influenced as a result.

Many writers of the early 20th century criticized Bergson&#x27;s intuitionism, indeterminism, psychologism and interpretation of the scientific impulse. Those who explicitly criticized Bergson, either in published articles or in letters, included Bertrand Russell George Santayana, G. E. Moore, Ludwig Wittgenstein, Martin Heidegger, Julien Benda, T. S. Eliot, Wyndham Lewis, Wallace Stevens (though Stevens also praised him in his work &quot;The Necessary Angel&quot;), Paul Valéry, André Gide, Jean Piaget, Marxist philosophers Theodor W. Adorno, Lucio Colletti, Jean-Paul Sartre, and Georges Politzer, as well as Maurice Blanchot, American philosophers such as Irving Babbitt, Arthur Lovejoy, Josiah Royce, The New Realists (Ralph B. Perry, E. B. Holt, and William Pepperell Montague), The Critical Realists (Durant Drake, Roy W. Sellars, C. A. Strong, and A. K. Rogers), Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler, Roger Fry (see his letters), Julian Huxley (in &quot;&quot;) and Virginia Woolf (for the latter, see Ann Banfield, &quot;The Phantom Table&quot;).

The Vatican accused Bergson of pantheism, while others have characterized his philosophy as a materialist emergentism – Samuel Alexander and C. Lloyd Morgan explicitly claimed Bergson as their forebear. According to Henri Hude (1990, II, p. 142), who supports himself on the whole of Bergson&#x27;s works as well as his now published courses, accusing him of pantheism is a &quot;counter-sense&quot;. Hude alleges that a mystical experience, roughly outlined at the end of &quot;Les Deux sources de la morale et de la religion&quot;, is the inner principle of his whole philosophy, although this has been contested by other commentators.

Charles Sanders Peirce took strong exception to those who associated him with Bergson. In response to a letter comparing their work, Peirce wrote, &quot;a man who seeks to further science can hardly commit a greater sin than to use the terms of his science without anxious care to use them with strict accuracy; it is not very gratifying to my feelings to be classed along with a Bergson who seems to be doing his utmost to muddle all distinctions.&quot; Peirce also comments on Bergson in respect to a proposed book on his semiotics (which he never wrote) saying: &quot;I feel confident the book would make a serious impression much deeper and surer than Bergson&#x27;s, which I find quite too vague.&quot; Gilles Deleuze, however, saw much in common between Bergson&#x27;s philosophy and that of Peirce - exploring the many connections between them in &quot;Cinema 1: The Movement Image&quot; and &quot;Cinema 2: The Time-Image&quot;. As the Deleuze scholar David Deamer writes: Deleuze sets about &quot;aligning Bergson&#x27;s sensory-motor schema [from &quot;Matter and Memory&quot;] with the semiosis of Charles Sanders Peirce from &quot;Pragmatism and Pragmaticism&quot; (1903). William James&#x27;s students resisted the assimilation of his work to that of Bergson. See, for example, Horace Kallen&#x27;s book on the subject &quot;James and Bergson&quot;. As Jean Wahl described the &quot;ultimate disagreement&quot; between James and Bergson in his &quot;System of Metaphysics&quot;: &quot;for James, the consideration of action is necessary for the definition of truth, according to Bergson, action ... must be kept from our mind if we want to see the truth&quot;. Gide even went so far as to say that future historians will overestimate Bergson&#x27;s influence on art and philosophy just because he was the self-appointed spokesman for &quot;the spirit of the age&quot;.

As early as the 1890s, Santayana attacked certain key concepts in Bergson&#x27;s philosophy, above all his view of the new and the indeterminate:

&quot;the possibility of a new and unaccountable fact appearing at any time,&quot; he writes in his book on Hermann Lotze, &quot;does not practically affect the method of investigation; ... the only thing given up is the hope that these hypotheses may ever be adequate to the reality and cover the process of nature without leaving a remainder. This is no great renunciation; for that consummation of science ... is by no one really expected.&quot;

According to Santayana and Russell, Bergson projected false claims onto the aspirations of scientific method, claims which Bergson needed to make in order to justify his prior moral commitment to freedom. Russell takes particular exception to Bergson&#x27;s understanding of number in chapter two of &quot;Time and Free Will&quot;. According to Russell, Bergson uses an outmoded spatial metaphor (&quot;extended images&quot;) to describe the nature of mathematics as well as logic in general. &quot;Bergson only succeeds in making his theory of number plausible by confusing a particular collection with the number of its terms, and this again with number in general&quot;, writes Russell (see &quot;The Philosophy of Bergson&quot; and &quot;A History of Western Philosophy&quot;).

Suzanne Guerlac has argued that the more recent resurgence of scholarly interest in Bergson is related to the growing influence of his follower Deleuze within continental philosophy: &quot;If there is a return to Bergson today, then, it is largely due to Gilles Deleuze whose own work has etched the contours of the New Bergson. This is not only because Deleuze wrote about Bergson; it is also because Deleuze&#x27;s own thought is deeply engaged with that of his predecessor, even when Bergson is not explicitly mentioned.&quot; Leonard Lawlor and Valentine Moulard agree with Guerlac that &quot;the recent revitalization of Bergsonism ... is almost entirely due to Deleuze.&quot; They explain that Bergson&#x27;s concept of multiplicity &quot;is at the very heart of Deleuze&#x27;s thought, and duration is the model for all of Deleuze&#x27;s &#x27;becomings.&#x27; The other aspect that attracted Deleuze, which is indeed connected to the first, is Bergson&#x27;s criticism of the concept of negation in &quot;Creative Evolution&quot; ... Thus Bergson became a resource in the criticism of the Hegelian dialectic, the negative.&quot; It is this aspect that Mark Sinclair focuses upon in &quot;Bergson&quot; (2020). He writes that despite the philosopher and his philosophy being very popular during the early years of the twentieth century, his ideas had been critiqued and then rejected first by phenomenology, then by existentialism, and finally by post-structuralism. As Sinclair goes on to explain, over series of publications including &quot;Bergsonism&quot; (1966) and &quot;Difference and Repetition&quot; (1968), Deleuze championed Bergson as a thinker of &quot;difference that precedes any sense of negation&quot;. In this way, &quot;Deleuze&#x27;s interpretation served to keep the flame of Bergson&#x27;s philosophy alive and it has been a key motivation for the renewed scholarly attention to it.&quot;

Ilya Prigogine acknowledged Bergson&#x27;s influence at his Nobel Prize reception lecture: &quot;Since my adolescence, I have read many philosophical texts, and I still remember the spell &quot;L&#x27;Évolution créatrice&quot; cast on me. More specifically, I felt that some essential message was embedded, still to be made explicit, in Bergson&#x27;s remark: &#x27;The more deeply we study the nature of time, the better we understand that duration means invention, creation of forms, continuous elaboration of the absolutely new.&#x27;&quot;

Japanese philosopher Yasushi Hirai from Fukuoka University has led a collaborative and interdisciplinary project since 2007, bringing together Eastern and Western philosophers and scientists to discuss and promote Bergson&#x27;s work. This has influenced the development of specific artificial neural networks which incorporate features inspired by Bergson&#x27;s philosophy of memory.

In &quot;The Matter with Things&quot;, Iain McGilchrist extensively cites Bergson. &quot;&#x27;Bergson arrived&#x27;, according to philosopher Peter Gunter, &#x27;at insights closely resembling those of quantum physics.&#x27; Only Bergson got there first.&quot;

===Comparison to Indian philosophies===
Several Hindu authors have found parallels to Hindu philosophy in Bergson&#x27;s thought. The integrative evolutionism of Sri Aurobindo, an Indian philosopher from the early 20th century, has many similarities to Bergson&#x27;s philosophy. Whether this represents a direct influence of Bergson is disputed, although Aurobindo was familiar with many Western philosophers. K Narayanaswami Aiyer, a member of the Theosophical Society, published a pamphlet titled &quot;Professor Bergson and the Hindu Vedanta&quot;, where he argued that Bergson&#x27;s ideas on matter, consciousness, and evolution were in agreement with Vedantic and Puranic explanations. Nalini Kanta Brahma, Marie Tudor Garland and Hope Fitz are other authors who have comparatively evaluated Hindu and Bergsonian philosophies, especially in relation to intuition, consciousness and evolution.

<doc id="13532" wikidata="Q89394" url="?curid=13532" title="Hans Selye">
<text>János Hugo Bruno &quot;Hans&quot; Selye (; ; January 26, 1907 – October 16, 1982) was a pioneering Hungarian-Canadian endocrinologist who conducted important scientific work on the hypothetical non-specific response of an organism to stressors. Although he did not recognize all of the many aspects of glucocorticoids, Selye was aware of their role in the stress response.

==Biography==
Selye was born in Vienna, Austria-Hungary on January 26, 1907, and grew up in Komárom (the town with Hungarian majority in present-day Slovakia was cut by the Treaty of Trianon in 1920). Selye&#x27;s father was a doctor of Hungarian ethnicity and his mother was Austrian. He became a Doctor of Medicine and Chemistry in Prague in 1929 and went on to do pioneering work in stress and endocrinology at Johns Hopkins University, McGill University, and the Université de Montréal. He was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for the first time in 1949. Although he received a total of 17 nominations (1949–1953) in his career, he never won the prize.

Selye died on October 16, 1982, in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. He often returned to visit Hungary, giving lectures as well as interviews in Hungarian television programs. He conducted a lecture in 1973 at the Hungarian Scientific Academy in Hungarian and observers noted that he had no accent, despite spending many years abroad. His book &quot;The Stress of Life&quot; appeared in Hungarian as &quot;Az Életünk és a stressz&quot; in 1964 and became a bestseller. Selye János University, the only Hungarian-language university in Slovakia, was named after him. Selye&#x27;s mother was killed by gunfire during Hungary&#x27;s anti-Communist revolt of 1956.

==Stress research==

Selye&#x27;s interest in stress began when he was in medical school; he had observed that patients with various chronic illnesses like tuberculosis and cancer appeared to display a common set of symptoms that he attributed to what is now commonly called stress. After completing his medical degree and a doctorate degree in organic chemistry at the German University of Prague, he received a Rockefeller Foundation fellowship to study (1931) at Johns Hopkins in Baltimore
and later moved to the Department of Biochemistry at McGill University in Montreal in 1932
where he studied under the sponsorship of James Bertram Collip (1892–1965). While working with laboratory animals, Selye observed a phenomenon that he thought resembled what he had previously seen in chronic patients. Rats exposed to cold, drugs, or surgical injury exhibited a common pattern of responses to these stressors. (A stressor is a chemical or biological agent, environmental condition, external stimulus or an event seen as causing stress to an organism.)

Selye initially ( 1940s) called this the &quot;general adaptation syndrome&quot; (at the time it was also called &quot;Selye&#x27;s syndrome&quot;), but he later rebaptized it with the simpler term &quot;stress response&quot;. According to Selye the general adaptation syndrome is triphasic, involving an initial alarm phase followed by a stage of resistance or adaptation and, finally, a stage of exhaustion and death (these phases were established largely on the basis of glandular states). Working with doctoral student Thomas McKeown (1912–1988), Selye published a report that used the word &quot;stress&quot; to describe these responses to adverse events.

His last inspiration for general adaptation syndrome came from an experiment in which he injected mice with extracts of various organs. He at first believed that he had discovered a new hormone, but was proved wrong when every irritating substance he injected produced the same symptoms (swelling of the adrenal cortex, atrophy of the thymus, gastric and duodenal ulcers). This, paired with his observation that people with different diseases exhibit similar symptoms, led to his description of the effects of &quot;noxious agents&quot; as he at first called it. He later adopted the term &quot;stress&quot;, which has been accepted into the lexicon of many languages.

Selye argued that stress differs from other physical responses in that it is identical whether the provoking impulse is positive or negative. He called negative stress &quot;distress&quot; and positive stress &quot;eustress&quot;.

The system whereby the body copes with stress, the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA axis) system, was also first described by Selye.

Selye acknowledged the influence of Claude Bernard (1813–1878), who developed the idea of &quot;milieu intérieur&quot;, and of the &quot;homeostasis&quot; of Walter Cannon (1871–1945). Selye conceptualized the physiology of stress as having two components: a set of responses which he called the &quot;general adaptation syndrome&quot;, and the development of a pathological state from ongoing, unrelieved stress.

While Selye&#x27;s work attracted continued support from advocates of psychosomatic medicine, many in experimental physiology concluded that his concepts were too vague and unmeasurable. During the 1950s, Selye turned away from the laboratory to promote his concept through popular books and lecture tours. He wrote both for non-academic physicians and an international bestseller entitled &quot;The Stress of Life&quot; (1956). From the late 1960s, academic psychologists started to adopt Selye&#x27;s concept of stress, and he followed &quot;The Stress of Life&quot; with two other books for the general public, &quot;From Dream to Discovery: On Being a Scientist&quot; (1964) and &quot;Stress without Distress&quot; (1974). The idea of &quot;stress&quot; resonated with humanistic psychology,
and pop psychology generalised the concept.

Selye worked as a professor and director of the Institute of Experimental Medicine and Surgery at the Université de Montréal. In 1975 he founded the International Institute of Stress,
and in 1979, Selye and Arthur Antille started the Hans Selye Foundation. Later Selye and eight Nobel laureates founded the Canadian Institute of Stress.

In 1968 he was made a Companion of the Order of Canada. In 1976 Concordia University awarded him the Loyola Medal. In 1976, he received the American Academy of Achievement&#x27;s Golden Plate Award at a Banquet of the Golden Plate ceremony in San Diego, California.

== Controversy and involvement with the tobacco industry ==
Although it was not widely known at the time, Selye began consulting for the tobacco industry starting in 1958; he had previously sought funding from the industry, but had been denied. Later, New York attorney Edwin Jacob contacted Selye as he prepared a defense against liability actions brought against tobacco companies. The companies wanted Selye&#x27;s help in arguing that the recognized correlation between smoking and cancer was not proof of causality. The firm offered to pay Selye $1000 to make a statement supporting this claim. He agreed but refused to testify. Tobacco industry lawyers reported that Selye was willing to incorporate industry advice when writing about smoking and stress. One lawyer advised him to &quot;comment on the unlikelihood of there being a mechanism by which smoking could cause cardiovascular disease” and to emphasize the &quot;stressful&quot; effect that anti-smoking messages had on the US population.&lt;ref name=&quot;10.2105/AJPH.2009.177634&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Publicly, Selye never declared his consultancy work for the tobacco industry. In a 1967 letter to &quot;Medical Opinion and Review&quot;, he argued against government over-regulation of science and public health, implying that his views on smoking were objective: &quot;I purposely avoided any mention of government-supported research because, being too largely dependent upon it, I may not be able to view the subject objectively. However, I do not use … cigarettes so let these examples suffice.&quot; In June 1969, Selye (then director of the Institute of Experimental Pathology, University of Montreal) testified before the Canadian House of Commons Health Committee against anti-smoking legislation, opposing advertising restrictions, health warnings, and restrictions on tar and nicotine. For his testimony Selye was funded $50,000 per year for a 3-year &quot;special project&quot;, by William Thomas Hoyt, executive of Council for Tobacco Research, with another $50,000 a year pledged by the Canadian tobacco industry. His comments on smoking were used worldwide; Philip Morris used Selye&#x27;s statements on the benefits of smoking to argue against the use of health warnings on tobacco products in Sweden. Similarly, in 1977 the Australian Cigarette Manufacturers quoted Selye extensively in their submission to the Australian Senate Standing Committee on Social Welfare.

In 1999, the United States Department of Justice brought an anti-racketeering case against 7 tobacco companies –British American Tobacco, Brown &amp; Williamson, Philip Morris, Liggett, American Tobacco Company, RJ Reynolds, and Lorillard– plus the Council for Tobacco Research, and the Tobacco Institute. As a result, the industry&#x27;s influence on stress research was revealed.

<doc id="13533" wikidata="Q1487" url="?curid=13533" title="Hacker">
<text>A hacker is a person skilled in information technology who achieves goals by non-standard means. The term has become associated in popular culture with a security hackersomeone with knowledge of bugs or exploits to break into computer systems and access data which would otherwise be inaccessible to them. In a positive connotation, though, hacking can also be utilized by legitimate figures in legal situations. For example, law enforcement agencies sometimes use hacking techniques to collect evidence on criminals and other malicious actors. This could include using anonymity tools (such as a VPN or the dark web) to mask their identities online and pose as criminals.

Hacking can also have a broader sense of any roundabout solution to a problem, or programming and hardware development in general, and hacker culture has spread the term&#x27;s broader usage to the general public even outside the profession or hobby of electronics (see life hack).

== Definitions ==
Reflecting the two types of hackers, there are two definitions of the word &quot;hacker&quot;:

# Originally, hacker simply meant advanced computer technology enthusiast (both hardware and software) and adherent of programming subculture; see hacker culture.
# Someone who is able to subvert computer security. If doing so for malicious purposes, the person can also be called a cracker.

Mainstream usage of &quot;hacker&quot; mostly refers to computer criminals, due to the mass media usage of the word since the 1990s. This includes what hacker jargon calls script kiddies, less skilled criminals who rely on tools written by others with very little knowledge about the way they work. This usage has become so predominant that the general public is largely unaware that different meanings exist. Though the self-designation of hobbyists as hackers is generally acknowledged and accepted by computer security hackers, people from the programming subculture consider the computer intrusion related usage incorrect, and emphasize the difference between the two by calling security breakers &quot;crackers&quot; (analogous to a safecracker).

The controversy is usually based on the assertion that the term originally meant someone messing about with something in a positive sense, that is, using playful cleverness to achieve a goal. But then, it is supposed, the meaning of the term shifted over the decades and came to refer to computer criminals.

As the security-related usage has spread more widely, the original meaning has become less known. In popular usage and in the media, &quot;computer intruders&quot; or &quot;computer criminals&quot; is the exclusive meaning of the word. In computer enthusiast and hacker culture, the primary meaning is a complimentary description for a particularly brilliant programmer or technical expert. A large segment of the technical community insist the latter is the correct usage, as in the Jargon File definition.

Sometimes, &quot;hacker&quot; is simply used synonymously with &quot;geek&quot;: &quot;A true hacker is not a group person. He&#x27;s a person who loves to stay up all night, he and the machine in a love-hate relationship... They&#x27;re kids who tended to be brilliant but not very interested in conventional goals It&#x27;s a term of derision and also the ultimate compliment.&quot;

Fred Shapiro thinks that &quot;the common theory that &#x27;hacker&#x27; originally was a benign term and the malicious connotations of the word were a later perversion is untrue.&quot; He found that the malicious connotations were already present at MIT in 1963 (quoting &quot;The Tech&quot;, an MIT student newspaper), and at that time referred to unauthorized users of the telephone network, that is, the phreaker movement that developed into the computer security hacker subculture of today.

=== Civic hacker ===
Civic hackers use their security and/or programming acumens to create solutions, often public and open-sourced, addressing challenges relevant to neighborhoods, cities, states or countries and the infrastructure within them. Municipalities and major government agencies such as NASA have been known to host hackathons or promote a specific date as a &quot;National Day of Civic Hacking&quot; to encourage participation from civic hackers. Civic hackers, though often operating autonomously and independently, may work alongside or in coordination with certain aspects of government or local infrastructure such as trains and buses. For example, in 2008, Philadelphia-based civic hacker William Entriken developed a web application that displayed a comparison of the actual arrival times of local SEPTA trains to their scheduled times after being reportedly frustrated by the discrepancy.

=== Security related hacking ===

Security hackers are people involved with circumvention of computer security. There are several types, including:

;White hat:Hackers who work to keep data safe from other hackers by finding system vulnerabilities that can be mitigated. White hats are usually employed by the target system&#x27;s owner and are typically paid (sometimes quite well) for their work. Their work is not illegal because it is done with the system owner&#x27;s consent.

;Black hat or Cracker:Hackers with malicious intentions. They often steal, exploit, and sell data, and are usually motivated by personal gain. Their work is usually illegal. A cracker is like a black hat hacker, but is specifically someone who is very skilled and tries via hacking to make profits or to benefit, not just to vandalize. Crackers find exploits for system vulnerabilities and often use them to their advantage by either selling the fix to the system owner or selling the exploit to other black hat hackers, who in turn use it to steal information or gain royalties.

;Grey hat:Computer security experts who may sometimes violate laws or typical ethical standards, but do not have the malicious intent typical of a black hat hacker.

=== Hacker culture ===
Hacker culture is an idea derived from a community of enthusiast computer programmers and systems designers in the 1960s around the Massachusetts Institute of Technology&#x27;s (MIT&#x27;s) Tech Model Railroad Club (TMRC) and the MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory. The concept expanded to the hobbyist home computing community, focusing on hardware in the late 1970s (e.g. the Homebrew Computer Club) and on software (video games, software cracking, the demoscene) in the 1980s/1990s. Later, this would go on to encompass many new definitions such as art, and life hacking.

== Motives ==
Four primary motives have been proposed as possibilities for why hackers attempt to break into computers and networks. First, there is a criminal financial gain to be had when hacking systems with the specific purpose of stealing credit card numbers or manipulating banking systems. Second, many hackers thrive off of increasing their reputation within the hacker subculture and will leave their handles on websites they defaced or leave some other evidence as proof that they were involved in a specific hack. Third, corporate espionage allows companies to acquire information on products or services that can be stolen or used as leverage within the marketplace. Lastly, state-sponsored attacks provide nation states with both wartime and intelligence collection options conducted on, in, or through cyberspace.

== Overlaps and differences ==

The main basic difference between programmer subculture and computer security hacker is their mostly separate historical origin and development. However, the &quot;Jargon File&quot; reports that considerable overlap existed for the early phreaking at the beginning of the 1970s. An article from MIT&#x27;s student paper &quot;The Tech&quot; used the term hacker in this context already in 1963 in its pejorative meaning for someone messing with the phone system. The overlap quickly started to break when people joined in the activity who did it in a less responsible way. This was the case after the publication of an article exposing the activities of Draper and Engressia.

According to Raymond, hackers from the programmer subculture usually work openly and use their real name, while computer security hackers prefer secretive groups and identity-concealing aliases. Also, their activities in practice are largely distinct. The former focus on creating new and improving existing infrastructure (especially the software environment they work with), while the latter primarily and strongly emphasize the general act of circumvention of security measures, with the effective use of the knowledge (which can be to report and help fixing the security bugs, or exploitation reasons) being only rather secondary. The most visible difference in these views was in the design of the MIT hackers&#x27; Incompatible Timesharing System, which deliberately did not have any security measures.

There are some subtle overlaps, however, since basic knowledge about computer security is also common within the programmer subculture of hackers. For example, Ken Thompson noted during his 1983 Turing Award lecture that it is possible to add code to the UNIX &quot;login&quot; command that would accept either the intended encrypted password or a particular known password, allowing a backdoor into the system with the latter password. He named his invention the &quot;Trojan horse&quot;. Furthermore, Thompson argued, the C compiler itself could be modified to automatically generate the rogue code, to make detecting the modification even harder. Because the compiler is itself a program generated from a compiler, the Trojan horse could also be automatically installed in a new compiler program, without any detectable modification to the source of the new compiler. However, Thompson disassociated himself strictly from the computer security hackers: &quot;I would like to criticize the press in its handling of the &#x27;hackers,&#x27; the 414 gang, the Dalton gang, etc. The acts performed by these kids are vandalism at best and probably trespass and theft at worst. ... I have watched kids testifying before Congress. It is clear that they are completely unaware of the seriousness of their acts.&quot;

The programmer subculture of hackers sees secondary circumvention of security mechanisms as legitimate if it is done to get practical barriers out of the way for doing actual work. In special forms, that can even be an expression of playful cleverness. However, the systematic and primary engagement in such activities is not one of the actual interests of the programmer subculture of hackers and it does not have significance in its actual activities, either. A further difference is that, historically, members of the programmer subculture of hackers were working at academic institutions and used the computing environment there. In contrast, the prototypical computer security hacker had access exclusively to a home computer and a modem. However, since the mid-1990s, with home computers that could run Unix-like operating systems and with inexpensive internet home access being available for the first time, many people from outside of the academic world started to take part in the programmer subculture of hacking.

Since the mid-1980s, there are some overlaps in ideas and members with the computer security hacking community. The most prominent case is Robert T. Morris, who was a user of MIT-AI, yet wrote the Morris worm. The &quot;Jargon File&quot; hence calls him &quot;a true hacker who blundered&quot;. Nevertheless, members of the programmer subculture have a tendency to look down on and disassociate from these overlaps. They commonly refer disparagingly to people in the computer security subculture as crackers and refuse to accept any definition of hacker that encompasses such activities. The computer security hacking subculture, on the other hand, tends not to distinguish between the two subcultures as harshly, acknowledging that they have much in common including many members, political and social goals, and a love of learning about technology. They restrict the use of the term cracker to their categories of script kiddies and black hat hackers instead.
All three subcultures have relations to hardware modifications. In the early days of network hacking, phreaks were building blue boxes and various variants. The programmer subculture of hackers has stories about several hardware hacks in its folklore, such as a mysterious &quot;magic&quot; switch attached to a PDP-10 computer in MIT&#x27;s AI lab that, when switched off, crashed the computer. The early hobbyist hackers built their home computers themselves from construction kits. However, all these activities have died out during the 1980s when the phone network switched to digitally controlled switchboards, causing network hacking to shift to dialing remote computers with modems when pre-assembled inexpensive home computers were available and when academic institutions started to give individual mass-produced workstation computers to scientists instead of using a central timesharing system. The only kind of widespread hardware modification nowadays is case modding.

An encounter of the programmer and the computer security hacker subculture occurred at the end of the 1980s, when a group of computer security hackers, sympathizing with the Chaos Computer Club (which disclaimed any knowledge in these activities), broke into computers of American military organizations and academic institutions. They sold data from these machines to the Soviet secret service, one of them in order to fund his drug addiction. The case was solved when Clifford Stoll, a scientist working as a system administrator, found ways to log the attacks and to trace them back (with the help of many others). &quot;23&quot;, a German film adaption with fictional elements, shows the events from the attackers&#x27; perspective. Stoll described the case in his book &quot;The Cuckoo&#x27;s Egg&quot; and in the TV documentary &quot;The KGB, the Computer, and Me&quot; from the other perspective. According to Eric S. Raymond, it &quot;nicely illustrates the difference between &#x27;hacker&#x27; and &#x27;cracker&#x27;. Stoll&#x27;s portrait of himself, his lady Martha, and his friends at Berkeley and on the Internet paints a marvelously vivid picture of how hackers and the people around them like to live and how they think.&quot;

== Representation in media ==
The mainstream media&#x27;s current usage of the term may be traced back to the early 1980s. When the term, previously used only among computer enthusiasts, was introduced to wider society by the mainstream media in 1983, even those in the computer community referred to computer intrusion as hacking, although not as the exclusive definition of the word. In reaction to the increasing media use of the term exclusively with the criminal connotation, the computer community began to differentiate their terminology. Alternative terms such as cracker were coined in an effort to maintain the distinction between hackers within the legitimate programmer community and those performing computer break-ins. Further terms such as black hat, white hat and gray hat developed when laws against breaking into computers came into effect, to distinguish criminal activities from those activities which were legal.

Network news&#x27; use of the term consistently pertains primarily to criminal activities, despite attempts by the technical community to preserve and distinguish the original meaning. Today, the mainstream media and general public continue to describe computer criminals, with all levels of technical sophistication, as &quot;hackers&quot; and do not generally make use of the word in any of its non-criminal connotations. Members of the media sometimes seem unaware of the distinction, grouping legitimate &quot;hackers&quot; such as Linus Torvalds and Steve Wozniak along with criminal &quot;crackers&quot;.

As a result, the definition is still the subject of heated controversy. The wider dominance of the pejorative connotation is resented by many who object to the term being taken from their cultural jargon and used negatively, including those who have historically preferred to self-identify as hackers. Many advocate using the more recent and nuanced alternate terms when describing criminals and others who negatively take advantage of security flaws in software and hardware. Others prefer to follow common popular usage, arguing that the positive form is confusing and unlikely to become widespread in the general public. A minority still use the term in both senses despite the controversy, leaving context to clarify (or leave ambiguous) which meaning is intended.

However, because the positive definition of hacker was widely used as the predominant form for many years before the negative definition was popularized, &quot;hacker&quot; can therefore be seen as a shibboleth, identifying those who use the technically oriented sense (as opposed to the exclusively intrusion-oriented sense) as members of the computing community. On the other hand, due to the variety of industries software designers may find themselves in, many prefer not to be referred to as hackers because the word holds a negative denotation in many of those industries.

A possible middle ground position has been suggested, based on the observation that &quot;hacking&quot; describes a collection of skills and tools which are used by hackers of both descriptions for differing reasons. The analogy is made to locksmithing, specifically picking locks, which is a skill which can be used for good or evil. The primary weakness of this analogy is the inclusion of script kiddies in the popular usage of &quot;hacker&quot;, despite their lack of an underlying skill and knowledge base.

<doc id="13535" wikidata="Q129778" url="?curid=13535" title="Heart of Darkness">
<text>Heart of Darkness is an 1899 novella by Polish-British novelist Joseph Conrad in which the sailor Charles Marlow tells his listeners the story of his assignment as steamer captain for a Belgian company in the African interior. The novel is widely regarded as a critique of European colonial rule in Africa, whilst also examining the themes of power dynamics and morality. Although Conrad does not name the river on which most of the narrative takes place, at the time of writing, the Congo Free State—the location of the large and economically important Congo River—was a private colony of Belgium&#x27;s King Leopold II. Marlow is given a text by Kurtz, an ivory trader working on a trading station far up the river, who has &quot;gone native&quot; and is the object of Marlow&#x27;s expedition.

Central to Conrad&#x27;s work is the idea that there is little difference between &quot;civilised people&quot; and &quot;savages&quot;. &quot;Heart of Darkness&quot; implicitly comments on imperialism and racism. The novella&#x27;s setting provides the frame for Marlow&#x27;s story of his fascination for the prolific ivory trader Kurtz. Conrad draws parallels between London (&quot;the greatest town on earth&quot;) and Africa as places of darkness.

Originally issued as a three-part serial story in &quot;Blackwood&#x27;s Magazine&quot; to celebrate the 1000th edition of the magazine, &quot;Heart of Darkness&quot; has been widely republished and translated in many languages. It provided the inspiration for Francis Ford Coppola&#x27;s 1979 film &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot;. In 1998, the Modern Library ranked &quot;Heart of Darkness&quot; 67th on their list of the 100 best novels in English of the 20th century.

==Composition and publication==

In 1890, at the age of 32, Conrad was appointed by a Belgian trading company to serve on one of its steamers. While sailing up the Congo River from one station to another, the captain became ill and Conrad assumed command. He guided the ship up the tributary Lualaba River to the trading company&#x27;s innermost station, Kindu, in Eastern Congo Free State; Marlow has similar experiences to the author.

When Conrad began to write the novella, eight years after returning from Africa, he drew inspiration from his travel journals. He described &quot;Heart of Darkness&quot; as &quot;a wild story&quot; of a journalist who becomes manager of a station in the (African) interior and makes himself worshipped by a tribe of natives. The tale was first published as a three-part serial, in February, March, and April 1899, in &quot;Blackwood&#x27;s Magazine&quot; (February 1899 was the magazine&#x27;s 1000th issue: special edition). &quot;Heart of Darkness&quot; was later included in the book &quot;&quot;, published on 13 November 1902 by William Blackwood.

The volume consisted of &quot;Youth: a Narrative&quot;, &quot;Heart of Darkness&quot; and &quot;The End of the Tether&quot; in that order. In 1917, for future editions of the book, Conrad wrote an &quot;&quot; where he, after denying any &quot;unity of artistic purpose&quot; underlying the collection, discusses each of the three stories and makes light commentary on Marlow, the narrator of the tales within the first two stories. He said Marlow first appeared in &quot;Youth&quot;.

On 31 May 1902, in a letter to William Blackwood, Conrad remarked,

I call your own kind self to witness ... the last pages of &quot;Heart of Darkness&quot; where the interview of the man and the girl locks in—as it were—the whole 30000 words of narrative description into one suggestive view of a whole phase of life and makes of that story something quite on another plane than an anecdote of a man who went mad in the Centre of Africa.

There have been many proposed sources for the character of the antagonist, Kurtz. Georges-Antoine Klein, an agent who became ill and died aboard Conrad&#x27;s steamer, is proposed by literary critics as a basis for Kurtz. The principal figures involved in the disastrous &quot;rear column&quot; of the Emin Pasha Relief Expedition have also been identified as likely sources, including column leader Edmund Musgrave Barttelot, his Scottish colleague, James Sligo Jameson, slave trader Tippu Tip and the expedition leader, Welsh explorer Henry Morton Stanley. Conrad&#x27;s biographer Norman Sherry judged that Arthur Hodister (1847–1892), a Belgian solitary but successful trader, who spoke three Congolese languages and was venerated by Congolese to the point of deification, served as the main model, while later scholars have refuted this hypothesis. Adam Hochschild, in &quot;King Leopold&#x27;s Ghost&quot;, believes that the Belgian soldier Léon Rom influenced the character. Peter Firchow mentions the possibility that Kurtz is a composite, modelled on various figures present in the Congo Free State at the time as well as on Conrad&#x27;s imagining of what they might have had in common.

A corrective impulse to impose one&#x27;s rule characterises Kurtz&#x27;s writings which were discovered by Marlow during his journey, where he rants on behalf of the so-called &quot;International Society for the Suppression of Savage Customs&quot; about his supposedly altruistic and sentimental reasons to civilise the &quot;savages&quot;; one document ends with a dark proclamation to &quot;Exterminate all the brutes!&quot;. The &quot;International Society for the Suppression of Savage Customs&quot; is interpreted as a sarcastic reference to one of the participants at the Berlin Conference, the International Association of the Congo (also called &quot;International Congo Society&quot;). The predecessor to this organisation was the &quot;International Association for the Exploration and Civilization of Central Africa&quot;.

==Summary==
Charles Marlow tells his friends the story of how he became captain of a river steamboat for an ivory trading company. As a child, Marlow was fascinated by &quot;the blank spaces&quot; on maps, particularly Africa. The image of a river on the map particularly fascinated Marlow.

In a flashback, Marlow makes his way to Africa, taking passage on a steamer. He travels up the river where his company&#x27;s station is. Work on a railway is taking place. Marlow explores a narrow ravine, and is horrified to find himself in a place full of critically ill Africans who worked on the railroad and are now dying. Marlow must wait for ten days in the company&#x27;s devastated Outer Station. Marlow meets the company&#x27;s chief accountant, who tells him of a Mr. Kurtz, who is in charge of a very important trading post, and is described as a respected first-class agent. The accountant predicts that Kurtz will go far.

Marlow departs with 60 men to travel to the Central Station, where the steamboat that he will command is based. At the station, he learns that his steamboat has been wrecked in an accident. The general manager informs Marlow that he could not wait for Marlow to arrive, and tells him of a rumour that Kurtz is ill. Marlow fishes his boat out of the river and spends months repairing it. Delayed by the lack of tools and replacement parts, Marlow is frustrated by the time it takes to perform the repairs. He learns that Kurtz is resented, not admired, by the manager. Once underway, the journey to Kurtz&#x27;s station takes two months.
The journey pauses for the night about below the Inner Station. In the morning the boat is enveloped by a thick fog. The steamboat is later attacked by a barrage of arrows, and the helmsman is killed. Marlow sounds the steam whistle repeatedly, frightening the attackers away.

After landing at Kurtz&#x27;s station, a man boards the steamboat: a Russian wanderer who strayed into Kurtz&#x27;s camp. Marlow learns that the natives worship Kurtz and that he has been very ill. The Russian tells of how Kurtz opened his mind and admires Kurtz even for his power and his willingness to use it. Marlow suspects that Kurtz has gone mad.

Marlow observes the station and sees a row of posts topped with the severed heads of natives. Around the corner of the house, Kurtz appears with supporters who carry him as a ghost-like figure on a stretcher. The area fills with natives ready for battle, but Kurtz shouts something and they retreat. His entourage carries Kurtz to the steamer and lays him in a cabin. The manager tells Marlow that Kurtz has harmed the company&#x27;s business in the region because his methods are &quot;unsound&quot;. The Russian reveals that Kurtz believes the company wants to kill him, and Marlow confirms that hangings were discussed.

After midnight, Kurtz returns to shore. Marlow finds Kurtz crawling back to the station house. Marlow threatens to harm Kurtz if he raises an alarm, but Kurtz only laments that he did not accomplish more. The next day they prepare to journey back down the river.

Kurtz&#x27;s health worsens during the trip. The steamboat breaks down, and while stopped for repairs, Kurtz gives Marlow a packet of papers, including his commissioned report and a photograph, telling him to keep them from the manager. When Marlow next speaks with him, Kurtz is near death; Marlow hears him weakly whisper, &quot;The horror! The horror!&quot; A short while later, the manager&#x27;s boy announces to the crew that Kurtz has died (the famous line &quot;Mistah Kurtz—he dead&quot; would become the epigraph of T. S. Eliot&#x27;s poem &quot;The Hollow Men&quot;). The next day Marlow pays little attention to Kurtz&#x27;s pilgrims as they bury &quot;something&quot; in a muddy hole.

Returning to Europe, Marlow is embittered and contemptuous of the &quot;civilised&quot; world. Several callers come to retrieve the papers Kurtz entrusted to him, but Marlow withholds them or offers papers he knows they have no interest in. He gives Kurtz&#x27;s report to a journalist, for publication if he sees fit. Marlow is left with some personal letters and a photograph of Kurtz&#x27;s fiancée. When Marlow visits her, she is deep in mourning although it has been more than a year since Kurtz&#x27;s death. She presses Marlow for information, asking him to repeat Kurtz&#x27;s final words. Marlow tells her that Kurtz&#x27;s final word was her name.

==Critical reception==

The novella was not a big success during Conrad&#x27;s life. When it was published as a single volume in 1902 with two novellas, &quot;Youth&quot; and &quot;The End of the Tether&quot;, it received the least commentary from critics. F. R. Leavis referred to &quot;Heart of Darkness&quot; as a &quot;minor work&quot; and criticised its &quot;adjectival insistence upon inexpressible and incomprehensible mystery&quot;. Conrad did not consider it to be particularly notable; but by the 1960s it was a standard assignment in many college and high school English courses.

Literary critic Harold Bloom wrote that &quot;Heart of Darkness&quot; had been analysed more than any other work of literature that is studied in universities and colleges, which he attributed to Conrad&#x27;s &quot;unique propensity for ambiguity&quot;. In &quot;King Leopold&#x27;s Ghost&quot; (1998), Adam Hochschild wrote that literary scholars have made too much of the psychological aspects of &quot;Heart of Darkness&quot;, while paying scant attention to Conrad&#x27;s accurate recounting of the horror arising from the methods and effects of colonialism in the Congo Free State. &quot;&quot;Heart of Darkness&quot; is experience ... pushed a little (and only very little) beyond the actual facts of the case&quot;. Other critiques include Hugh Curtler&#x27;s &quot;Achebe on Conrad: Racism and Greatness in Heart of Darkness&quot; (1997). The French philosopher Philippe Lacoue-Labarthe called &quot;Heart of Darkness&quot; &quot;one of the greatest texts of Western literature&quot; and used Conrad&#x27;s tale for a reflection on &quot;The Horror of the West&quot;.
&quot;Heart of Darkness&quot; is criticised in postcolonial studies, particularly by Nigerian novelist Chinua Achebe. In his 1975 public lecture &quot;An Image of Africa: Racism in Conrad&#x27;s &quot;Heart of Darkness&quot;&quot;, Achebe described Conrad&#x27;s novella as &quot;an offensive and deplorable book&quot; that dehumanised Africans. Achebe argued that Conrad, &quot;blinkered ... with xenophobia&quot;, incorrectly depicted Africa as the antithesis of Europe and civilisation, ignoring the artistic accomplishments of the Fang people who lived in the Congo River basin at the time of the book&#x27;s publication. He argued that the book promoted and continues to promote a prejudiced image of Africa that &quot;depersonalises a portion of the human race&quot; and concluded that it should not be considered a great work of art.

Achebe&#x27;s critics argue that he fails to distinguish Marlow&#x27;s view from Conrad&#x27;s, which results in very clumsy interpretations of the novella. In their view, Conrad portrays Africans sympathetically and their plight tragically, and refers sarcastically to, and condemns outright, the supposedly noble aims of European colonists, thereby demonstrating his scepticism about the moral superiority of European men. Ending a passage that describes the condition of chained, emaciated slaves, Marlow remarks: &quot;After all, I also was a part of the great cause of these high and just proceedings.&quot; Some observers assert that Conrad, whose native country had been conquered by imperial powers, empathised by default with other subjugated peoples. Jeffrey Meyers notes that Conrad, like his acquaintance Roger Casement, &quot;was one of the first men to question the Western notion of progress, a dominant idea in Europe from the Renaissance to the Great War, to attack the hypocritical justification of colonialism and to reveal... the savage degradation of the white man in Africa.&quot; Likewise, E.D. Morel, who led international opposition to King Leopold II&#x27;s rule in the Congo, saw Conrad&#x27;s &quot;Heart of Darkness&quot; as a condemnation of colonial brutality and referred to the novella as &quot;the most powerful thing written on the subject.&quot;
Conrad scholar Peter Firchow writes that &quot;nowhere in the novel does Conrad or any of his narrators, personified or otherwise, claim superiority on the part of Europeans on the grounds of alleged genetic or biological difference&quot;. If Conrad or his novel is racist, it is only in a weak sense, since &quot;Heart of Darkness&quot; acknowledges racial distinctions &quot;but does not suggest an essential superiority&quot; of any group. Achebe&#x27;s reading of &quot;Heart of Darkness&quot; can be (and has been) challenged by a reading of Conrad&#x27;s other African story, &quot;An Outpost of Progress&quot;, which has an omniscient narrator, rather than the embodied narrator, Marlow. Masood Ashraf Raja has suggested that Conrad&#x27;s positive representation of Muslims in his Malay novels complicates these charges of racism.

In 2003, Motswana scholar Peter Mwikisa concluded the book was &quot;the great lost opportunity to depict dialogue between Africa and Europe&quot;. Zimbabwean scholar Rino Zhuwarara, however, broadly agreed with Achebe, though considered it important to be &quot;sensitised to how peoples of other nations perceive Africa&quot;. The novelist Caryl Phillips stated in 2003 that: &quot;Achebe is right; to the African reader the price of Conrad&#x27;s eloquent denunciation of colonisation is the recycling of racist notions of the &#x27;dark&#x27; continent and her people. Those of us who are not from Africa may be prepared to pay this price, but this price is far too high for Achebe&quot;.

In his 1983 criticism, the British academic Cedric Watts criticises the insinuation in Achebe&#x27;s critique—the premise that only black people may accurately analyse and assess the novella, as well as mentioning that Achebe&#x27;s critique falls into self-contradictory arguments regarding Conrad&#x27;s writing style, both praising and denouncing it at times. Stan Galloway writes, in a comparison of &quot;Heart of Darkness&quot; with &quot; Jungle Tales of Tarzan&quot;, &quot;The inhabitants [of both works], whether antagonists or compatriots, were clearly imaginary and meant to represent a particular fictive cipher and not a particular African people&quot;. More recent critics like Nidesh Lawtoo have stressed that the &quot;continuities&quot; between Conrad and Achebe are profound and that a form of &quot;postcolonial mimesis&quot; ties the two authors via productive mirroring inversions.

==Adaptations and influences==

===Radio and stage===
Orson Welles adapted and starred in &quot;Heart of Darkness&quot; in a CBS Radio broadcast on 6 November 1938 as part of his series, &quot;The Mercury Theatre on the Air&quot;. In 1939, Welles adapted the story for his first film for RKO Pictures, writing a screenplay with John Houseman. The story was adapted to focus on the rise of a fascist dictator. Welles intended to play Marlow and Kurtz and it was to be entirely filmed as a POV from Marlow&#x27;s eyes. Welles even filmed a short presentation film illustrating his intent. It is reportedly lost. The film&#x27;s prologue to be read by Welles said &quot;You aren&#x27;t going to see this picture - this picture is going to happen to you.&quot; The project was never realised; one reason given was the loss of European markets after the outbreak of World War II. Welles still hoped to produce the film when he presented another radio adaptation of the story as his first program as producer-star of the CBS radio series &quot;This Is My Best&quot;. Welles scholar Bret Wood called the broadcast of 13 March 1945, &quot;the closest representation of the film Welles might have made, crippled, of course, by the absence of the story&#x27;s visual elements (which were so meticulously designed) and the half-hour length of the broadcast.&quot;

In 1991, Australian author/playwright Larry Buttrose wrote and staged a theatrical adaptation titled &quot;Kurtz&quot; with the Crossroads Theatre Company, Sydney. The play was announced to be broadcast as a radio play to Australian radio audiences in August 2011 by the Vision Australia Radio Network, and also by the RPH – Radio Print Handicapped Network across Australia. In 2011, composer Tarik O&#x27;Regan and librettist Tom Phillips adapted an opera of the same name, which premiered at the Linbury Theatre of the Royal Opera House in London. A suite for orchestra and narrator was subsequently extrapolated from it. In 2015, an adaptation of Welles&#x27; screenplay by Jamie Lloyd and Laurence Bowen aired on BBC Radio 4. The production starred James McAvoy as Marlow. Another BBC Radio 4 adaptation, first broadcast in 2021, transposes the action to the 21st century.

=== Film and television ===
In 1958, the CBS television anthology &quot;Playhouse 90&quot; (S3E7) aired a loose 90-minute television play adaptation. This version, written by Stewart Stern, uses the encounter between Marlow (Roddy McDowall) and Kurtz (Boris Karloff) as its final act, and adds a backstory in which Marlow had been Kurtz&#x27;s adopted son. The cast includes Inga Swenson and Eartha Kitt.

Perhaps the best known adaptation is Francis Ford Coppola&#x27;s 1979 film &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot;, based on the screenplay by John Milius, which moves the story from the Congo to Vietnam and Cambodia during the Vietnam War. In &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot;, Martin Sheen stars as Captain Benjamin L. Willard, a US Army Captain assigned to &quot;terminate the command&quot; of Colonel Walter E. Kurtz, played by Marlon Brando. A film documenting the production, titled &quot;Hearts of Darkness: A Filmmaker&#x27;s Apocalypse&quot;, was released in 1991. It chronicles a series of difficulties and challenges that director Coppola encountered during the making of the film, several of which mirror some of the novella&#x27;s themes.

A 1993 television film adaptation was written by Benedict Fitzgerald and directed by Nicolas Roeg. The film, which was aired by TNT, starred Tim Roth as Marlow, John Malkovich as Kurtz, Isaach de Bankolé as Mfumu, and James Fox as Gosse.
James Gray&#x27;s 2019 science fiction film &quot;Ad Astra&quot; is loosely inspired by the events of the novel. It features Brad Pitt as an astronaut travelling to the edge of the Solar System to confront and potentially kill his father (Tommy Lee Jones), who has gone rogue.

In 2020, &quot;African Apocalypse&quot;, a documentary film directed and produced by Rob Lemkin and featuring Femi Nylander portrays a journey from Oxford, England to Niger on the trail of a colonial killer called Captain Paul Voulet. Voulet&#x27;s descent into barbarity mirrors that of Kurtz in Conrad&#x27;s &quot;Heart of Darkness&quot;. Nylander discovers Voulet&#x27;s massacres happened at exactly the same time that Conrad wrote his book in 1899. It was broadcast by the BBC in May 2021 as an episode of the &quot;Arena&quot; documentary series.

A British animated film adaption of the novella is planned, directed by Gerald Conn. It was written by Mark Jenkins and Mary Kate O Flanagan and is produced by Gritty Realism and Michael Sheen. Kurtz is voiced by Sheen and Harlequin by Andrew Scott. The animation uses sand to better convey atmosphere of the book. A Brazilian animated film (2023) also adapts the novella. It is directed by Rogério Nunes and Alois Di Leo and moves the story to a near future Rio de Janeiro.

===Video games===
The video game &quot;Far Cry 2&quot;, released on 21 October 2008, is a loose modernised adaptation of &quot;Heart of Darkness&quot;. The player assumes the role of a mercenary operating in Africa whose task it is to kill an arms dealer, the elusive &quot;Jackal&quot;. The last area of the game is called &quot;The Heart of Darkness&quot;.

&quot;Spec Ops: The Line&quot;, released on 26 June 2012, is a direct modernised adaptation of &quot;Heart of Darkness&quot;. The player assumes the role of Delta Force operator Captain Martin Walker as he and his team search Dubai for survivors in the aftermath of catastrophic sandstorms that left the city without contact to the outside world. The character John Konrad, who replaces the character Kurtz, is a reference to Joseph Conrad.

===Literature===
T. S. Eliot&#x27;s 1925 poem &quot;The Hollow Men&quot; quotes, as its first epigraph, a line from &quot;Heart of Darkness&quot;: &quot;Mistah Kurtz – he dead.&quot; Eliot had planned to use a quotation from the climax of the tale as the epigraph for &quot;The Waste Land&quot;, but Ezra Pound advised against it. Eliot said of the quote that &quot;it is much the most appropriate I can find, and somewhat elucidative.&quot; Biographer Peter Ackroyd suggested that the passage inspired or at least anticipated the central theme of the poem.

Chinua Achebe&#x27;s 1958 novel &quot;Things Fall Apart&quot; is Achebe&#x27;s response to what he saw as Conrad&#x27;s portrayal of Africa and Africans as symbols: &quot;the antithesis of Europe and therefore civilization&quot;. Achebe set out to write a novel about Africa and Africans by an African. In &quot;Things Fall Apart&quot; we see the effects of colonialism and Christian missionary endeavours on an Igbo community in West Africa through the eyes of that community&#x27;s West African protagonists.

Another literary work with an acknowledged debt to &quot;Heart of Darkness&quot; is Wilson Harris&#x27; 1960 postcolonial novel &quot;Palace of the Peacock&quot;. J. G. Ballard&#x27;s 1962 climate fiction novel &quot;The Drowned World&quot; includes many similarities to Conrad&#x27;s novella. However, Ballard said he had read nothing by Conrad before writing the novel, prompting literary critic Robert S. Lehman to remark that &quot;the novel&#x27;s allusion to Conrad works nicely, even if it is not really an allusion to Conrad&quot;.

Robert Silverberg&#x27;s 1970 novel &quot;Downward to the Earth&quot; uses themes and characters based on &quot;Heart of Darkness&quot; set on the alien world of Belzagor. In Josef Škvorecký&#x27;s 1984 novel &quot;The Engineer of Human Souls&quot;, Kurtz is seen as the epitome of exterminatory colonialism and, there and elsewhere, Škvorecký emphasises the importance of Conrad&#x27;s concern with Russian imperialism in Eastern Europe.

Timothy Findley&#x27;s 1993 novel &quot;Headhunter&quot; is an extensive adaptation that reimagines Kurtz and Marlow as psychiatrists in Toronto. The novel begins: &quot;On a winter&#x27;s day, while a blizzard raged through the streets of Toronto, Lilah Kemp inadvertently set Kurtz free from page 92 of &quot;Heart of Darkness&quot;.&quot; Ann Patchett&#x27;s 2011 novel &quot;State of Wonder&quot; reimagines the story with the central figures as female scientists in contemporary Brazil.

===Comics===
The comic-book adaptation &quot;Au coeur des ténèbres&quot;, written by and illustrated by , was published by Soleil in 2014. and created another French comic adaptation, published as &quot;Coeur de ténèbres&quot; by Delcourt in 2020. Georges Bess&#x27; 2021 comic book &quot;Amen&quot; is a liberal adaptation of &quot;Heart of Darkness&quot; as a space opera.

<text>Hinduism () is an umbrella term for a range of Indian religious and spiritual traditions (&quot;sampradaya&quot;s) that are unified by adherence to the concept of &quot;dharma&quot;, a cosmic order maintained by its followers through rituals and righteous living, as first expounded in the Vedas. The word &quot;Hindu&quot; is an exonym, and while Hinduism has been called the oldest religion in the world, it has also been described by the modern term &quot;Sanātana Dharma&quot; () emphasizing its eternal nature. Another endonym for Hinduism is &quot;Vaidika Dharma&quot; ().

Hinduism entails diverse systems of thought, marked by a range of shared concepts that discuss theology, mythology, among other topics in textual sources. Hindu texts have been classified into Śruti () and Smṛti (). The major Hindu scriptures are the Vedas, the Upanishads, the Puranas, the &quot;Mahabharata&quot; (including the &quot;Bhagavad Gita&quot;), the &quot;Ramayana&quot;, and the Agamas. Prominent themes in Hindu beliefs include the &quot;karma&quot; (action, intent and consequences), &quot;saṃsāra&quot; (the cycle of death and rebirth) and the four Puruṣārthas, proper goals or aims of human life, namely: &quot;dharma&quot; (ethics/duties), &quot;artha&quot; (prosperity/work), &quot;kama&quot; (desires/passions) and &quot;moksha&quot; (liberation/freedom from passions and ultimately &quot;saṃsāra&quot;). Hindu religious practices include devotion (&quot;bhakti&quot;), worship (&quot;puja&quot;), sacrificial rites (&quot;yajna&quot;), and meditation (&quot;dhyana&quot;) and yoga. Hinduism has no central doctrinal authority and many Hindus do not claim to belong to any denomination. However, scholarly studies notify four major denominations: Shaivism, Shaktism, Smartism, and Vaishnavism. The six Āstika schools of Hindu philosophy that recognise the authority of the Vedas are: Samkhya, Yoga, Nyaya, Vaisheshika, Mīmāṃsā, and Vedanta.

While the traditional Itihasa-Purana and its derived Epic-Puranic chronology present Hinduism as a tradition existing for thousands of years, scholars regard Hinduism as a fusion or synthesis of Brahmanical orthopraxy with various Indian cultures, having diverse roots and no specific founder. This Hindu synthesis emerged after the Vedic period, between to 200 BCE, and , in the period of the second urbanisation and the early classical period of Hinduism when the epics and the first Purānas were composed. It flourished in the medieval period, with the decline of Buddhism in India. Since the 19th century, modern Hinduism, influenced by western culture, has acquired a great appeal in the West, most notably reflected in the popularisation of yoga and various sects such as Transcendental Meditation and the Hare Krishna movement.

Hinduism is the world&#x27;s third-largest religion, with approximately 1.20 billion followers, or around 15% of the global population, known as Hindus. It is the most widely professed faith in India, Nepal, Mauritius, and in Bali, Indonesia. Significant numbers of Hindu communities are found in the countries of South Asia, in Southeast Asia, in the Caribbean, Middle East, North America, Europe, Oceania, Africa, and other regions.
== Etymology ==

The word &quot;Hindū&quot; is an exonym, derived from Sanskrit &quot;Sindhu&quot;, the name of the Indus River as well as the country of the lower Indus basin (Sindh).
The Proto-Iranian sound change &quot;*s&quot; &gt; &quot;h&quot; occurred between 850 and 600 BCE.
&quot;Hindu&quot; occurs in Avesta as &quot;heptahindu&quot;, equivalent to Rigvedic &quot;sapta sindhu&quot;.
The 6th-century BCE inscription of Darius I mentions Hindush (referring to Sindh) among his provinces.
&quot;Hindustan&quot; (spelt &quot;hndstn&quot;) is found in a Sasanian inscription from the 3rd century CE.
The term &quot;Hindu&quot; in these ancient records is a geographical term and did not refer to a religion. In Arabic texts, &quot;Hind&quot;, a derivative of Persian &quot;Hindu&quot;, was used to refer to the land beyond the Indus and therefore, all the people in that land were &quot;Hindus&quot;, according to historian Romila Thapar.
By the 13th century, &quot;Hindustan&quot; emerged as a popular alternative name of India.

Among the earliest known records of &#x27;Hindu&#x27; with connotations of religion may be in the 7th-century CE Chinese text &quot;Record of the Western Regions&quot; by Xuanzang. In the 14th century, &#x27;Hindu&#x27; appeared in several texts in Persian, Sanskrit and Prakrit within India, and subsequently in vernacular languages, often in comparative contexts to contrast them with Muslims or &quot;Turks&quot;. Examples include the 14th-century Persian text &quot;Futuhu&#x27;s-salatin&quot; by &#x27;Abd al-Malik Isami,
Jain texts such as &quot;Vividha Tirtha Kalpa&quot; and &quot;Vidyatilaka&quot;,
circa 1400 Apabhramsa text &quot;Kīrttilatā&quot; by Vidyapati, 16–18th century Bengali Gaudiya Vaishnava texts, etc.
These native usages of &quot;Hindu&quot; were borrowed from Persian, and they did not always have a religious connotation, but they often did.
In Indian texts, &quot;Hindu dharma&quot; (&quot;Hindu religion&quot;) was often used to refer to Hinduism.

Starting in the 17th century, European merchants and colonists adopted &quot;Hindu&quot; (often with the English spelling &quot;Hindoo&quot;) to refer to residents of India as a religious community.
The term got increasingly associated with the practices of Brahmins, who were also referred to as &quot;Gentiles&quot; and &quot;Gentoos&quot;.
Terms such as &quot;Hindoo faith&quot; and &quot;Hindoo religion&quot; were often used, eventually leading to the appearance of &quot;Hindooism&quot; in a letter of Charles Grant in 1787, who used it along with &quot;Hindu religion&quot;.
The first Indian to use &quot;Hinduism&quot; may have been Raja Ram Mohan Roy in 1816–17. By the 1840s, the term &quot;Hinduism&quot; was used by those Indians who opposed British colonialism, and who wanted to distinguish themselves from Muslims and Christians.
Before the British began to categorise communities strictly by religion, Indians generally did not define themselves exclusively through their religious beliefs; instead identities were largely segmented on the basis of locality, language, varna, jāti, occupation, and sect.

== Definitions ==
&quot;Hinduism&quot; is an umbrella-term,
referring to a broad range of sometimes opposite and often competitive traditions.
In Western ethnography, the term refers to the fusion, or synthesis, of various Indian cultures and traditions, with diverse roots and no founder. This Hindu synthesis emerged after the Vedic period, between –200 BCE and , in the period of the Second Urbanisation and the early classical period of Hinduism, when the epics and the first Puranas were composed. It flourished in the medieval period, with the decline of Buddhism in India. Hinduism&#x27;s variations in belief and its broad range of traditions make it difficult to define as a religion according to traditional Western conceptions.

Hinduism includes a diversity of ideas on spirituality and traditions; Hindus can be polytheistic, pantheistic, panentheistic, pandeistic, henotheistic, monotheistic, monistic, agnostic, atheistic or humanist. According to Mahatma Gandhi, &quot;a man may not believe in God and still call himself a Hindu&quot;. According to Wendy Doniger, &quot;ideas about all the major issues of faith and lifestyle – vegetarianism, nonviolence, belief in rebirth, even caste – are subjects of debate, not dogma.&quot;

Because of the wide range of traditions and ideas covered by the term Hinduism, arriving at a comprehensive definition is difficult. The religion &quot;defies our desire to define and categorize it&quot;. Hinduism has been variously defined as a religion, a religious tradition, a set of religious beliefs, and &quot;a way of life&quot;. From a Western lexical standpoint, Hinduism, like other faiths, is appropriately referred to as a religion. In India, the term &quot;(Hindu) dharma&quot; is used, which is broader than the Western term &quot;religion,&quot; and refers to the religious attitudes and behaviours, the &#x27;right way to live&#x27;, as preserved and transmitted in the various traditions collectively referred to as &quot;Hinduism.&quot;

The study of India and its cultures and religions, and the definition of &quot;Hinduism&quot;, has been shaped by the interests of colonialism and by Western notions of religion. Since the 1990s, those influences and its outcomes have been the topic of debate among scholars of Hinduism, and have also been taken over by critics of the Western view on India.

=== Typology ===

Hinduism as it is commonly known can be subdivided into a number of major currents. Of the historical division into six darsanas (philosophies), two schools, Vedanta and Yoga, are currently the most prominent.
The six āstika schools of Hindu philosophy, which recognise the authority of the Vedas are: Sānkhya, Yoga, Nyāya, Vaisheshika, Mimāmsā, and Vedānta.

Classified by primary deity or deities, four major Hinduism modern currents are Vaishnavism (Vishnu), Shaivism (Shiva), Shaktism (Devi) and Smartism (five deities treated as equals). Hinduism also accepts numerous divine beings, with many Hindus considering the deities to be aspects or manifestations of a single impersonal absolute or ultimate reality or Supreme God, while some Hindus maintain that a specific deity represents the supreme and various deities are lower manifestations of this supreme. Other notable characteristics include a belief in the existence of ātman (self), reincarnation of one&#x27;s ātman, and karma as well as a belief in dharma (duties, rights, laws, conduct, virtues and right way of living), although variation exists, with some not following these beliefs.

June McDaniel (2007) classifies Hinduism into six major kinds and numerous minor kinds, in order to understand the expression of emotions among the Hindus. The major kinds, according to McDaniel are Folk Hinduism, based on local traditions and cults of local deities and is the oldest, non-literate system; Vedic Hinduism based on the earliest layers of the Vedas, traceable to the 2nd millennium BCE; Vedantic Hinduism based on the philosophy of the Upanishads, including Advaita Vedanta, emphasising knowledge and wisdom; Yogic Hinduism, following the text of Yoga Sutras of Patanjali emphasising introspective awareness; Dharmic Hinduism or &quot;daily morality&quot;, which McDaniel states is stereotyped in some books as the &quot;only form of Hindu religion with a belief in karma, cows and caste&quot;; and bhakti or devotional Hinduism, where intense emotions are elaborately incorporated in the pursuit of the spiritual.

Michaels distinguishes three Hindu religions and four forms of Hindu religiosity. The three Hindu religions are &quot;Brahmanic-Sanskritic Hinduism&quot;, &quot;folk religions and tribal religions&quot;, and &quot;founded religions&quot;. The four forms of Hindu religiosity are the classical &quot;karma-marga&quot;, jnana-marga, bhakti-marga, and &quot;heroism&quot;, which is rooted in militaristic traditions. These militaristic traditions include Ramaism (the worship of a hero of epic literature, Rama, believing him to be an incarnation of Vishnu) and parts of political Hinduism. &quot;Heroism&quot; is also called virya-marga. According to Michaels, one out of nine Hindu belongs by birth to one or both of the Brahmanic-Sanskritic Hinduism and Folk religion typology, whether practising or non-practicing. He classifies most Hindus as belonging by choice to one of the &quot;founded religions&quot; such as Vaishnavism and Shaivism that are moksha-focussed and often de-emphasise Brahman (Brahmin) priestly authority yet incorporate ritual grammar of Brahmanic-Sanskritic Hinduism. He includes among &quot;founded religions&quot; Buddhism, Jainism, Sikhism that are now distinct religions, syncretic movements such as Brahmo Samaj and the Theosophical Society, as well as various &quot;Guru-isms&quot; and new religious movements such as Maharishi Mahesh Yogi,
BAPS and ISKCON.

Inden states that the attempt to classify Hinduism by typology started in the imperial times, when proselytising missionaries and colonial officials sought to understand and portray Hinduism from their interests. Hinduism was construed as emanating not from a reason of spirit but fantasy and creative imagination, not conceptual but symbolical, not ethical but emotive, not rational or spiritual but of cognitive mysticism. This stereotype followed and fit, states Inden, with the imperial imperatives of the era, providing the moral justification for the colonial project. From tribal Animism to Buddhism, everything was subsumed as part of Hinduism. The early reports set the tradition and scholarly premises for the typology of Hinduism, as well as the major assumptions and flawed presuppositions that have been at the foundation of Indology. Hinduism, according to Inden, has been neither what imperial religionists stereotyped it to be, nor is it appropriate to equate Hinduism to be merely the monist pantheism and philosophical idealism of Advaita Vedanta.

Some academics suggest that Hinduism can be seen as a category with &quot;fuzzy edges&quot; rather than as a well-defined and rigid entity. Some forms of religious expression are central to Hinduism and others, while not as central, still remain within the category. Based on this idea Gabriella Eichinger Ferro-Luzzi has developed a &#x27;Prototype Theory approach&#x27; to the definition of Hinduism.


To its adherents, Hinduism is a traditional way of life. Many practitioners refer to the &quot;orthodox&quot; form of Hinduism as &quot;&quot;, &quot;the eternal law&quot; or the &quot;eternal way&quot;. Hindus regard Hinduism to be thousands of years old. The Puranic chronology, as narrated in the Mahabharata, Ramayana, and the Puranas, envisions a timeline of events related to Hinduism starting well before 3000 BCE. The word &quot;dharma&quot; is used here to mean &quot;religion&quot; similar to modern Indo-Aryan languages, rather than with its original Sanskrit meaning. All aspects of a Hindu life, namely acquiring wealth (&quot;artha&quot;), fulfilment of desires (&quot;kama&quot;), and attaining liberation (&quot;moksha&quot;), are viewed here as part of &quot;dharma&quot;, which encapsulates the &quot;right way of living&quot; and eternal harmonious principles in their fulfilment. The use of the term &quot;Sanātana Dharma&quot; for Hinduism is a modern usage, based on the belief that the origins of Hinduism lie beyond human history, as revealed in the Hindu texts.

&quot;Sanātana Dharma&quot; refers to &quot;timeless, eternal set of truths&quot; and this is how Hindus view the origins of their religion. It is viewed as those eternal truths and traditions with origins beyond human history– truths divinely revealed (Shruti) in the Vedas, the most ancient of the world&#x27;s scriptures. To many Hindus, Hinduism is a tradition that can be traced at least to the ancient Vedic era. The Western term &quot;religion&quot; to the extent it means &quot;dogma and an institution traceable to a single founder&quot; is inappropriate for their tradition, states Hatcher.

&quot;&quot; historically referred to the &quot;eternal&quot; duties religiously ordained in Hinduism, duties such as honesty, refraining from injuring living beings (&quot;ahiṃsā&quot;), purity, goodwill, mercy, patience, forbearance, self-restraint, generosity, and asceticism. These duties applied regardless of a Hindu&#x27;s class, caste, or sect, and they contrasted with svadharma, one&#x27;s &quot;own duty&quot;, in accordance with one&#x27;s class or caste (&quot;varṇa&quot;) and stage in life (puruṣārtha). In recent years, the term has been used by Hindu leaders, reformers, and nationalists to refer to Hinduism. Sanatana dharma has become a synonym for the &quot;eternal&quot; truth and teachings of Hinduism, that transcend history and are &quot;unchanging, indivisible and ultimately nonsectarian&quot;.

=== &quot;Vaidika dharma&quot; ===

Some have referred to Hinduism as the &quot;Vaidika dharma&quot;. The word &#x27;Vaidika&#x27; in Sanskrit means &#x27;derived from or conformable to the Veda&#x27; or &#x27;relating to the Veda&#x27;. Traditional scholars employed the terms Vaidika and Avaidika, those who accept the Vedas as a source of authoritative knowledge and those who do not, to differentiate various Indian schools from Jainism, Buddhism and Charvaka. According to Klaus Klostermaier, the term Vaidika dharma is the earliest self-designation of Hinduism. According to Arvind Sharma, the historical evidence suggests that &quot;the Hindus were referring to their religion by the term &quot;vaidika dharma&quot; or a variant thereof&quot; by the 4th-century CE. According to Brian K. Smith, &quot;[i]t is &#x27;debatable at the very least&#x27; as to whether the term &quot;Vaidika Dharma&quot; cannot, with the proper concessions to historical, cultural, and ideological specificity, be comparable to and translated as &#x27;Hinduism&#x27; or &#x27;Hindu religion&#x27;.&quot;

Whatever the case, many Hindu religious sources see persons or groups which they consider as non-Vedic (and which reject Vedic varṇāśrama – &#x27;caste and life stage&#x27; orthodoxy) as being heretics (pāṣaṇḍa/pākhaṇḍa). For example, the &quot;Bhāgavata Purāṇa&quot; considers Buddhists, Jains as well as some Shaiva groups like the Paśupatas and Kāpālins to be pāṣaṇḍas (heretics).

According to Alexis Sanderson, the early Sanskrit texts differentiate between Vaidika, Vaishnava, Shaiva, Shakta, Saura, Buddhist and Jaina traditions. However, the late 1st-millennium CE Indic consensus had &quot;indeed come to conceptualize a complex entity corresponding to Hinduism as opposed to Buddhism and Jainism excluding only certain forms of antinomian Shakta-Shaiva&quot; from its fold. Some in the Mimamsa school of Hindu philosophy considered the &quot;Agamas&quot; such as the Pancaratrika to be invalid because it did not conform to the Vedas. Some Kashmiri scholars rejected the esoteric tantric traditions to be a part of Vaidika dharma. The Atimarga Shaivism ascetic tradition, datable to about 500 CE, challenged the Vaidika frame and insisted that their Agamas and practices were not only valid, they were superior than those of the Vaidikas. However, adds Sanderson, this Shaiva ascetic tradition viewed themselves as being genuinely true to the Vedic tradition and &quot;held unanimously that the Śruti and Smṛti of Brahmanism are universally and uniquely valid in their own sphere, [...] and that as such they [Vedas] are man&#x27;s sole means of valid knowledge [...]&quot;.

The term Vaidika dharma means a code of practice that is &quot;based on the Vedas&quot;, but it is unclear what &quot;based on the Vedas&quot; really implies, states Julius Lipner. The Vaidika dharma or &quot;Vedic way of life&quot;, states Lipner, does not mean &quot;Hinduism is necessarily religious&quot; or that Hindus have a universally accepted &quot;conventional or institutional meaning&quot; for that term. To many, it is as much a cultural term. Many Hindus do not have a copy of the Vedas nor have they ever seen or personally read parts of a Veda, like a Christian, might relate to the Bible or a Muslim might to the Quran. Yet, states Lipner, &quot;this does not mean that their [Hindus] whole life&#x27;s orientation cannot be traced to the Vedas or that it does not in some way derive from it&quot;.

Though many religious Hindus implicitly acknowledge the authority of the Vedas, this acknowledgment is often &quot;no more than a declaration that someone considers himself [or herself] a Hindu,&quot; and &quot;most Indians today pay lip service to the Veda and have no regard for the contents of the text.&quot; Some Hindus challenge the authority of the Vedas, thereby implicitly acknowledging its importance to the history of Hinduism, states Lipner.

=== Legal definition ===
Bal Gangadhar Tilak gave the following definition in &quot;Gita Rahasya&quot; (1915): &quot;Acceptance of the Vedas with reverence; recognition of the fact that the means or ways to salvation are diverse; and realization of the truth that the number of gods to be worshipped is large&quot;. It was quoted by the Indian Supreme Court in 1966, and again in 1995, &quot;as an &#x27;adequate and satisfactory definition,&quot; and is still the legal definition of a Hindu today.

== Diversity and unity ==

=== Diversity ===
Hindu beliefs are vast and diverse, and thus Hinduism is often referred to as a family of religions rather than a single religion. Within each religion in this family of religions, there are different theologies, practices, and sacred texts. Hinduism does not have a &quot;unified system of belief encoded in a declaration of faith or a creed&quot;, but is rather an umbrella term comprising the plurality of religious phenomena of India. According to the Supreme Court of India,

Part of the problem with a single definition of the term &quot;Hinduism&quot; is the fact that Hinduism does not have a founder. It is a synthesis of various traditions, the &quot;Brahmanical orthopraxy, the renouncer traditions and popular or local traditions&quot;.

Theism is also difficult to use as a unifying doctrine for Hinduism, because while some Hindu philosophies postulate a theistic ontology of creation, other Hindus are or have been atheists.

=== Sense of unity ===
Despite the differences, there is also a sense of unity. Most Hindu traditions revere a body of religious or sacred literature, the Vedas, although there are exceptions. These texts are a reminder of the ancient cultural heritage and point of pride for Hindus, though Louis Renou stated that &quot;even in the most orthodox domains, the reverence to the Vedas has come to be a simple raising of the hat&quot;.

Halbfass states that, although Shaivism and Vaishnavism may be regarded as &quot;self-contained religious constellations&quot;, there is a degree of interaction and reference between the &quot;theoreticians and literary representatives&quot; of each tradition that indicates the presence of &quot;a wider sense of identity, a sense of coherence in a shared context and of inclusion in a common framework and horizon&quot;.

==== Classical Hinduism ====
Brahmins played an essential role in the development of the post-Vedic Hindu synthesis, disseminating Vedic culture to local communities, and integrating local religiosity into the trans-regional Brahmanic culture. In the post-Gupta period Vedanta developed in southern India, where orthodox Brahmanic culture and the Hindu culture were preserved, building on ancient Vedic traditions while &quot;accommoda[ting] the multiple demands of Hinduism.&quot;

==== Medieval developments ====
The notion of common denominators for several religions and traditions of India further developed from the 12th century CE. Lorenzen traces the emergence of a &quot;family resemblance&quot;, and what he calls as &quot;beginnings of medieval and modern Hinduism&quot; taking shape, at c. 300–600 CE, with the development of the early Puranas, and continuities with the earlier Vedic religion. Lorenzen states that the establishment of a Hindu self-identity took place &quot;through a process of mutual self-definition with a contrasting Muslim Other&quot;. According to Lorenzen, this &quot;presence of the Other&quot; is necessary to recognise the &quot;loose family resemblance&quot; among the various traditions and schools.

According to the Indologist Alexis Sanderson, before Islam arrived in India, the &quot;Sanskrit sources differentiated Vaidika, Vaiṣṇava, Śaiva, Śākta, Saura, Buddhist, and Jaina traditions, but they had no name that denotes the first five of these as a collective entity over and against Buddhism and Jainism&quot;. This absence of a formal name, states Sanderson, does not mean that the corresponding concept of Hinduism did not exist. By late 1st-millennium CE, the concept of a belief and tradition distinct from Buddhism and Jainism had emerged. This complex tradition accepted in its identity almost all of what is currently Hinduism, except certain antinomian tantric movements. Some conservative thinkers of those times questioned whether certain Shaiva, Vaishnava and Shakta texts or practices were consistent with the Vedas, or were invalid in their entirety. Moderates then, and most orthoprax scholars later, agreed that though there are some variations, the foundation of their beliefs, the ritual grammar, the spiritual premises, and the soteriologies were the same. &quot;This sense of greater unity&quot;, states Sanderson, &quot;came to be called Hinduism&quot;.

According to Nicholson, already between the 12th and the 16th centuries &quot;certain thinkers began to treat as a single whole the diverse philosophical teachings of the Upanishads, epics, Puranas, and the schools known retrospectively as the &#x27;six systems&#x27; (&quot;saddarsana&quot;) of mainstream Hindu philosophy.&quot; The tendency of &quot;a blurring of philosophical distinctions&quot; has also been noted by Mikel Burley. Hacker called this &quot;inclusivism&quot; and Michaels speaks of &quot;the identificatory habit&quot;. Lorenzen locates the origins of a distinct Hindu identity in the interaction between Muslims and Hindus, and a process of &quot;mutual self-definition with a contrasting Muslim other&quot;, which started well before 1800. Michaels notes:
==== Colonial views ====
The notion and reports on &quot;Hinduism&quot; as a &quot;single world religious tradition&quot; were also popularised by 19th-century proselytising missionaries and European Indologists, roles sometimes served by the same person, who relied on texts preserved by Brahmins (priests) for their information of Indian religions, and animist observations that the missionary Orientalists presumed was Hinduism. These reports influenced perceptions about Hinduism. Scholars such as Pennington state that the colonial polemical reports led to fabricated stereotypes where Hinduism was mere mystic paganism devoted to the service of devils, while other scholars state that the colonial constructions influenced the belief that the &quot;Vedas&quot;, &quot;Bhagavad Gita&quot;, &quot;Manusmriti&quot; and such texts were the essence of Hindu religiosity, and in the modern association of &#x27;Hindu doctrine&#x27; with the schools of Vedanta (in particular Advaita Vedanta) as a paradigmatic example of Hinduism&#x27;s mystical nature&quot;. Pennington, while concurring that the study of Hinduism as a world religion began in the colonial era, disagrees that Hinduism is a colonial European era invention. He states that the shared theology, common ritual grammar and way of life of those who identify themselves as Hindus is traceable to ancient times.

==== Hindu modernism and neo-Vedanta ====

This inclusivism was further developed in the 19th and 20th centuries by Hindu reform movements and Neo-Vedanta, and has become characteristic of modern Hinduism.

Beginning in the 19th century, Indian modernists re-asserted Hinduism as a major asset of Indian civilisation, meanwhile &quot;purifying&quot; Hinduism from its Tantric elements and elevating the Vedic elements. Western stereotypes were reversed, emphasising the universal aspects, and introducing modern approaches of social problems. This approach had great appeal, not only in India, but also in the west. Major representatives of &quot;Hindu modernism&quot; are Ram Mohan Roy, Swami Vivekananda, Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan and Mahatma Gandhi.

Raja Rammohan Roy is known as the father of the Hindu Renaissance. He was a major influence on Swami Vivekananda, who, according to Flood, was &quot;a figure of great importance in the development of a modern Hindu self-understanding and in formulating the West&#x27;s view of Hinduism&quot;. Central to his philosophy is the idea that the divine exists in all beings, that all human beings can achieve union with this &quot;innate divinity&quot;, and that seeing this divine as the essence of others will further love and social harmony. According to Vivekananda, there is an essential unity to Hinduism, which underlies the diversity of its many forms. According to Flood, Vivekananda&#x27;s vision of Hinduism &quot;is one generally accepted by most English-speaking middle-class Hindus today&quot;. Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan sought to reconcile western rationalism with Hinduism, &quot;presenting Hinduism as an essentially rationalistic and humanistic religious experience&quot;.

This &quot;Global Hinduism&quot; has a worldwide appeal, transcending national boundaries and, according to Flood, &quot;becoming a world religion alongside Christianity, Islam and Buddhism&quot;, both for the Hindu diaspora communities and for westerners who are attracted to non-western cultures and religions. It emphasises universal spiritual values such as social justice, peace and &quot;the spiritual transformation of humanity&quot;. It has developed partly due to &quot;re-enculturation&quot;, or the pizza effect, in which elements of Hindu culture have been exported to the West, gaining popularity there, and as a consequence also gained greater popularity in India. This globalisation of Hindu culture brought &quot;to the West teachings which have become an important cultural force in western societies, and which in turn have become an important cultural force in India, their place of origin&quot;.

==== Modern India and the world ====

The Hindutva movement has extensively argued for the unity of Hinduism, dismissing the differences and regarding India as a Hindu-country since ancient times. And there are assumptions of political dominance of Hindu nationalism in India, also known as &#x27;&quot;Neo-Hindutva&quot;&#x27;. There have also been increase in pre-dominance of Hindutva in Nepal, similar to that of India. The scope of Hinduism is also increasing in the other parts of the world, due to the cultural influences such as Yoga and Hare Krishna movement by many missionaries organisations, especially by ISKCON and this is also due to the migration of Indian Hindus to the other nations of the world. Hinduism is growing fast in many western nations and in some African nations.

== Main traditions ==

=== Denominations ===

Hinduism has no central doctrinal authority and many practising Hindus do not claim to belong to any particular denomination or tradition. Four major denominations are, however, used in scholarly studies: &quot;Shaivism&quot;, &quot;Shaktism&quot;, &quot;Smartism&quot;, and &quot;Vaishnavism&quot;. These denominations differ primarily in the central deity worshipped, the traditions and the soteriological outlook. The denominations of Hinduism, states Lipner, are unlike those found in major religions of the world, because Hindu denominations are fuzzy with individuals practising more than one, and he suggests the term &quot;Hindu polycentrism&quot;.

There are no census data available on demographic history or trends for the traditions within Hinduism. Estimates vary on the relative number of adherents in the different traditions of Hinduism. According to a 2020 estimate by The World Religion Database (WRD), hosted at Boston University’s Institute on Culture, Religion and World Affairs (CURA), the Vaishnavism tradition is the largest group with about 399 million Hindus, followed by Shaivism with 385 million Hindus, Shaktism with 305 million Hindus and other traditions including Neo-Hinduism and Reform Hinduism with 25 million Hindus.    In contrast, according to Jones and Ryan, Shaivism is the largest tradition of Hinduism.

Vaishnavism is the devotional religious tradition that worships Vishnu and his avatars, particularly Krishna and Rama. The adherents of this sect are generally non-ascetic, monastic, oriented towards community events and devotionalism practices inspired by &quot;intimate loving, joyous, playful&quot; &quot;Krishna&quot; and other Vishnu avatars. These practices sometimes include community dancing, singing of Kirtans and Bhajans, with sound and music believed by some to have meditative and spiritual powers. Temple worship and festivals are typically elaborate in Vaishnavism. The Bhagavad Gita and the Ramayana, along with Vishnu-oriented Puranas provide its theistic foundations.

Shaivism is the tradition that focuses on Shiva. Shaivas are more attracted to ascetic individualism, and it has several sub-schools. Their practices include bhakti-style devotionalism, yet their beliefs lean towards nondual, monistic schools of Hinduism such as Advaita and Raja Yoga. Some Shaivas worship in temples, while others emphasise yoga, striving to be one with Shiva within. Avatars are uncommon, and some Shaivas visualise god as half male, half female, as a fusion of the male and female principles (Ardhanarishvara). Shaivism is related to Shaktism, wherein Shakti is seen as spouse of Shiva. Community celebrations include festivals, and participation, with Vaishnavas, in pilgrimages such as the Kumbh Mela. Shaivism has been more commonly practised in the Himalayan north from Kashmir to Nepal, and in south India.

Shaktism focuses on goddess worship of Shakti or Devi as cosmic mother, and it is particularly common in northeastern and eastern states of India such as Assam and Bengal. Devi is depicted as in gentler forms like Parvati, the consort of Shiva; or, as fierce warrior goddesses like Kali and Durga. Followers of Shaktism recognise Shakti as the power that underlies the male principle. Shaktism is also associated with Tantra practices. Community celebrations include festivals, some of which include processions and idol immersion into sea or other water bodies.

Smartism centers its worship simultaneously on all the major Hindu deities: Shiva, Vishnu, Shakti, Ganesha, Surya and Skanda. The Smarta tradition developed during the (early) Classical Period of Hinduism around the beginning of the Common Era, when Hinduism emerged from the interaction between Brahmanism and local traditions. The Smarta tradition is aligned with Advaita Vedanta, and regards Adi Shankara as its founder or reformer, who considered worship of God-with-attributes (Saguna Brahman) as a journey towards ultimately realising God-without-attributes (nirguna Brahman, Atman, Self-knowledge). The term &quot;Smartism&quot; is derived from Smriti texts of Hinduism, meaning those who remember the traditions in the texts. This Hindu sect practices a philosophical Jnana yoga, scriptural studies, reflection, meditative path seeking an understanding of Self&#x27;s oneness with God.

=== Ethnicities ===


Hinduism is traditionally a multi- or polyethnic religion. On the Indian subcontinent, it is widespread among many Indo-Aryan, Dravidian and other South Asian ethnic groups, for example, the Meitei people (Tibeto-Burman ethnicity in the northeastern Indian state Manipur).

In addition, in antiquity and the Middle Ages, Hinduism was the state religion in many Indianized kingdoms of Asia, the &quot;Greater India&quot;from Afghanistan (Kabul) in the West and including almost all of Southeast Asia in the East (Cambodia, Vietnam, Indonesia, partly Philippines)and only by the 15th century was nearly everywhere supplanted by Buddhism and Islam, except several still Hindu minor Austronesian ethnic groups, such as the Balinese and Tenggerese people in Indonesia, and the Chams in Vietnam. Also, a small community of the Afghan Pashtuns who migrated to India after partition remain committed to Hinduism.

The Indo-Aryan Kalash people in Pakistan traditionally practice an indigenous religion which is closely related to ancient Indo-Iranian religion, and resembles the ancient Vedic religion. While it has been related to Greek religion, due to an origin-narrative which says that the Kalash descend from Alexander the Great&#x27;s Greek soldiers, the Kalash speak an Indo-Aryan language, and their religion is closer to Hinduism than to the religion of Alexander&#x27;s army.

There are many new ethnic Ghanaian Hindus in Ghana, who have converted to Hinduism due to the works of Swami Ghanananda Saraswati and Hindu Monastery of Africa From the beginning of the 20th century, by the forces of Baba Premananda Bharati (1858–1914), Swami Vivekananda, A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada and other missionaries, Hinduism gained a certain distribution among the Western peoples.

== Scriptures ==

The ancient scriptures of Hinduism are initially in Vedic Sanskrit and later in classical Sanskrit. These texts are classified into two: Shruti and Smriti. Shruti is &quot;apauruṣeyā&quot;, () but revealed by the &quot;rishis&quot; (), and regarded as having the highest authority, while the smriti are manmade and have secondary authority. They are the two highest sources of dharma, the other two being &quot;Śiṣṭa Āchāra/Sadāchara&quot; () and finally &quot;Ātma tuṣṭi&quot; ().

Hindu scriptures were composed, memorised and transmitted verbally, across generations, for many centuries before they were written down.

&quot;Shruti&quot; () primarily refers to the &quot;Vedas&quot;, which form the earliest record of the Hindu scriptures, and are regarded as eternal truths revealed to the ancient sages (&quot;rishis&quot;). There are four &quot;Vedas&quot; – &quot;Rigveda&quot;, &quot;Samaveda&quot;, &quot;Yajurveda&quot; and &quot;Atharvaveda&quot;. Each Veda has been subclassified into four major text types – the Samhitas (mantras and benedictions), the Aranyakas (text on rituals, ceremonies, sacrifices and symbolic-sacrifices), the Brahmanas (commentaries on rituals, ceremonies and sacrifices), and the Upanishads (text discussing meditation, philosophy and spiritual knowledge). The first two parts of the Vedas were subsequently called the &#x27; (ritualistic portion), while the last two form the &#x27; (knowledge portion, discussing spiritual insight and philosophical teachings).

The Upanishads are the foundation of Hindu philosophical thought and have profoundly influenced diverse traditions. Of the Shrutis (Vedic corpus), the Upanishads alone are widely influential among Hindus, considered scriptures par excellence of Hinduism, and their central ideas have continued to influence its thoughts and traditions. Indian philosopher Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan states that the Upanishads have played a dominating role ever since their appearance. There are 108 Muktikā Upanishads in Hinduism, of which between 10 and 13 are variously counted by scholars as Principal Upanishads.

The most notable of the Smritis () are the Hindu epics and the &quot;Puranas&quot; (). The epics consist of the &quot;Mahabharata&quot; and the &quot;Ramayana&quot;. The &quot;Bhagavad Gita&quot; is an integral part of the &quot;Mahabharata&quot; and one of the most popular sacred texts of Hinduism. It is sometimes called &quot;Gitopanishad&quot;, then placed in the Shruti (&quot;heard&quot;) category, being Upanishadic in content. The &quot;Puranas&quot;, which started to be composed of onward, contain extensive mythologies, and are central in the distribution of common themes of Hinduism through vivid narratives. The &quot;Yoga Sutras&quot; is a classical text for the Hindu Yoga tradition, which gained renewed popularity in the 20th century.

Since the 19th century, Indian modernists have re-asserted the &#x27;Aryan origins&#x27; of Hinduism, &quot;purifying&quot; Hinduism from its Tantric elements and elevating the Vedic elements. Hindu modernists like Vivekananda see the Vedas as the laws of the spiritual world, which would still exist even if they were not revealed to the sages.

Tantra are the religious scriptures that give prominence to the female energy of the deity that in her personified form has both gentle and fierce form. In Tantric tradition, Radha, Parvati, Durga, and Kali are worshipped symbolically as well as in their personified forms. The &quot;Agamas&quot; in Tantra refer to authoritative scriptures or the teachings of Shiva to Shakti, while &quot;Nigamas&quot; refers to the Vedas and the teachings of Shakti to Shiva. In Agamic schools of Hinduism, the Vedic literature and the Agamas are equally authoritative.

== Beliefs ==

Prominent themes in Hindu beliefs include (but are not restricted to) Dharma (ethics/duties),  (the continuing cycle of entanglement in passions and the resulting birth, life, death, and rebirth), Karma (action, intent, and consequences), moksha (liberation from attachment and saṃsāra), and the various yogas (paths or practices). However, not all of these themes are found among the various different systems of Hindu beliefs. Beliefs in moksha or saṃsāra are absent in certain Hindu beliefs, and were also absent among early forms of Hinduism, which was characterised by a belief in an Afterlife, with traces of this still being found among various Hindu beliefs, such as Śrāddha. Ancestor worship once formed an integral part of Hindu beliefs and is today still found as an important element in various Folk Hindu streams.

=== Purusharthas ===
Purusharthas refers to the objectives of human life. Classical Hindu thought accepts four proper goals or aims of human life, known as Puruṣārthas – Dharma, Artha, Kama and Moksha.

==== Dharma (moral duties, righteousness, ethics) ====

Dharma is considered the foremost goal of a human being in Hinduism. The concept of dharma includes behaviours that are considered to be in accord with rta, the order that makes life and universe possible, and includes duties, rights, laws, conduct, virtues and &quot;right way of living&quot;. Hindu dharma includes the religious duties, moral rights and duties of each individual, as well as behaviours that enable social order, right conduct, and those that are virtuous. Dharma is that which all existing beings must accept and respect to sustain harmony and order in the world. It is the pursuit and execution of one&#x27;s nature and true calling, thus playing one&#x27;s role in cosmic concert. The Brihadaranyaka Upanishad states it as:

In the Mahabharata, Krishna defines dharma as upholding both this-worldly and other-worldly affairs. (Mbh 12.110.11). The word &quot;Sanātana&quot; means &quot;eternal&quot;, &quot;perennial&quot;, or &quot;forever&quot;; thus, &quot;Sanātana Dharma&quot; signifies that it is the dharma that has neither beginning nor end.

==== Artha (the means or resources needed for a fulfilling life) ====

Artha is the virtuous pursuit of means, resources, assets, or livelihood, for the purpose of meeting obligations, economic prosperity, and to have a fulfilling life. It is inclusive of political life, diplomacy, and material well-being. The artha concept includes all &quot;means of life&quot;, activities and resources that enables one to be in a state one wants to be in, wealth, career and financial security. The proper pursuit of artha is considered an important aim of human life in Hinduism.

A central premise of Hindu philosophy is that every person should live a joyous, pleasurable and fulfilling life, where every person&#x27;s needs are acknowledged and fulfilled. A person&#x27;s needs can only be fulfilled when sufficient means are available. Artha, then, is best described as the pursuit of the means necessary for a joyous, pleasurable and fulfilling life.

==== Kāma (sensory, emotional and aesthetic pleasure) ====

Kāma (Sanskrit, Pali: काम) means desire, wish, passion, longing, and pleasure of the senses, the aesthetic enjoyment of life, affection and love, with or without sexual connotations.
In contemporary Indian literature kama is often used to refer to sexual desire, but in ancient Indian literature kāma is expansive and includes any kind of enjoyment and pleasure, such as pleasure deriving from the arts. The ancient Indian Epic the Mahabharata describes kama as any agreeable and desirable experience generated by the interaction of one or more of the five senses with anything associated with that sense, when in harmony with the other goals of human life (dharma, artha and moksha).

In Hinduism, kama is considered an essential and healthy goal of human life when pursued without sacrificing dharma, artha and moksha.

==== Mokṣa (liberation, freedom from suffering) ====

Moksha () or mukti () is the ultimate, most important goal in Hinduism. Moksha is a concept associated with liberation from sorrow, suffering, and for many theistic schools of Hinduism, liberation from samsara (a birth-rebirth cycle). A release from this eschatological cycle in the afterlife is called moksha in theistic schools of Hinduism.

Due to the belief in Hinduism that the Atman is eternal, and the concept of Purusha (the cosmic self or cosmic consciousness), death can be seen as insignificant in comparison to the eternal Atman or Purusha.

===== Differing views on the nature of moksha =====
The meaning of &quot;moksha&quot; differs among the various Hindu schools of thought.

Advaita Vedanta holds that upon attaining moksha a person knows their essence, or self, to be pure consciousness or the witness-consciousness and identifies it as identical to Brahman.

More generally, in the theistic schools of Hinduism moksha is usually seen as liberation from saṃsāra, while for other schools, such as the monistic school, moksha happens during a person&#x27;s lifetime and is a psychological concept.

According to Deutsch, moksha is a transcendental consciousness of the perfect state of being, of self-realization, of freedom, and of &quot;realizing the whole universe as the Self&quot;. &quot;Moksha&quot; when viewed as a psychological concept, suggests Klaus Klostermaier, implies a setting free of hitherto fettered faculties, a removing of obstacles to an unrestricted life, permitting a person to be more truly a person in the fullest sense. This concept presumes an unused human potential of creativity, compassion and understanding which had been previously blocked and shut out.

Due to these different views on the nature of moksha, the Vedantic school separates this into two views – &quot;Jivanmukti&quot; (liberation in this life) and &quot;Videhamukti&quot; (liberation after death).

=== Karma and saṃsāra ===

&quot;Karma&quot; translates literally as &quot;action&quot;, &quot;work&quot;, or &quot;deed&quot;, and also refers to a Vedic theory of &quot;moral law of cause and effect&quot;. The theory is a combination of (1) causality that may be ethical or non-ethical; (2) ethicisation, that is good or bad actions have consequences; and (3) rebirth. Karma theory is interpreted as explaining the present circumstances of an individual with reference to his or her actions in the past. These actions and their consequences may be in a person&#x27;s current life, or, according to some schools of Hinduism, in past lives. This cycle of birth, life, death and rebirth is called &quot;saṃsāra&quot;. Liberation from saṃsāra through moksha is believed to ensure lasting happiness and peace. Hindu scriptures teach that the future is both a function of current human effort derived from free will and past human actions that set the circumstances. The idea of reincarnation, or saṃsāra, is not mentioned in the early layers of historical Hindu texts such as the &quot;Rigveda&quot;. The later layers of the &quot;Rigveda&quot; do mention ideas that suggest an approach towards the idea of rebirth, according to Ranade. According to Sayers, these earliest layers of Hindu literature show ancestor worship and rites such as &quot;sraddha&quot; (offering food to the ancestors). The later Vedic texts such as the &quot;Aranyakas&quot; and the &quot;Upanisads&quot; show a different soteriology based on reincarnation, they show little concern with ancestor rites, and they begin to philosophically interpret the earlier rituals. The idea of reincarnation and karma have roots in the Upanishads of the late Vedic period, predating the Buddha and the Mahavira.

=== Concept of God ===
Hinduism is a diverse system of thought with a wide variety of beliefs its concept of God is complex and depends upon each individual and the tradition and philosophy followed. It is sometimes referred to as henotheistic (i.e., involving devotion to a single god while accepting the existence of others), but any such term is an overgeneralisation.
The &quot;Nasadiya Sukta&quot; (&quot;Creation Hymn&quot;) of the &quot;Rig Veda&quot; is one of the earliest texts which &quot;demonstrates a sense of metaphysical speculation&quot; about what created the universe, the concept of god(s) and The One, and whether even The One knows how the universe came into being. The &quot;Rig Veda&quot; praises various deities, none superior nor inferior, in a henotheistic manner. The hymns repeatedly refer to One Truth and One Ultimate Reality. The &quot;One Truth&quot; of Vedic literature, in modern era scholarship, has been interpreted as monotheism, monism, as well as a deified Hidden Principles behind the great happenings and processes of nature.

Hindus believe that all living creatures have a Self. This true &quot;Self&quot; of every person, is called the &quot;ātman&quot;. The Self is believed to be eternal. According to the monistic/pantheistic (non-dualist) theologies of Hinduism (such as Advaita Vedanta school), this Atman is indistinct from Brahman, the supreme spirit or the Ultimate Reality. The goal of life, according to the Advaita school, is to realise that one&#x27;s Self is identical to supreme Self, that the supreme Self is present in everything and everyone, all life is interconnected and there is oneness in all life. Dualistic schools (Dvaita and Bhakti) understand Brahman as a Supreme Being separate from individual Selfs. They worship the Supreme Being variously as Vishnu, Brahma, Shiva, or Shakti, depending upon the sect. God is called &quot;Ishvara&quot;, &quot;Bhagavan&quot;, &quot;Parameshwara&quot;, &quot;Deva&quot; or &quot;Devi&quot;, and these terms have different meanings in different schools of Hinduism.

Hindu texts accept a polytheistic framework, but this is generally conceptualised as the divine essence or luminosity that gives vitality and animation to the inanimate natural substances. There is a divine in everything, human beings, animals, trees and rivers. It is observable in offerings to rivers, trees, tools of one&#x27;s work, animals and birds, rising sun, friends and guests, teachers and parents. It is the divine in these that makes each sacred and worthy of reverence, rather than them being sacred in and of themselves. This perception of divinity manifested in all things, as Buttimer and Wallin view it, makes the Vedic foundations of Hinduism quite distinct from animism, in which all things are themselves divine. The animistic premise sees multiplicity, and therefore an equality of ability to compete for power when it comes to man and man, man and animal, man and nature, etc. The Vedic view does not perceive this competition, equality of man to nature, or multiplicity so much as an overwhelming and interconnecting single divinity that unifies everyone and everything.

The Hindu scriptures name celestial entities called &quot;Devas&quot; (or &#x27; in feminine form), which may be translated into English as &quot;gods&quot; or &quot;heavenly beings&quot;. The devas are an integral part of Hindu culture and are depicted in art, architecture and through icons, and stories about them are related in the scriptures, particularly in Indian epic poetry and the Puranas. They are, however, often distinguished from Ishvara, a personal god, with many Hindus worshipping Ishvara in one of its particular manifestations as their &#x27;, or chosen ideal. The choice is a matter of individual preference, and of regional and family traditions. The multitude of Devas is considered manifestations of Brahman.
The word &quot;avatar&quot; does not appear in the Vedic literature; It appears in verb forms in post-Vedic literature, and as a noun particularly in the Puranic literature after the 6th century CE. Theologically, the reincarnation idea is most often associated with the &quot;avatars&quot; of Hindu god Vishnu, though the idea has been applied to other deities. Varying lists of avatars of Vishnu appear in Hindu scriptures, including the ten Dashavatara of the &quot;Garuda Purana&quot; and the twenty-two avatars in the &quot;Bhagavata Purana&quot;, though the latter adds that the incarnations of Vishnu are innumerable. The avatars of Vishnu are important in Vaishnavism theology. In the goddess-based Shaktism tradition, avatars of the Devi are found and all goddesses are considered to be different aspects of the same metaphysical Brahman and Shakti &quot;(energy)&quot;. While avatars of other deities such as Ganesha and Shiva are also mentioned in medieval Hindu texts, this is minor and occasional.

Both theistic and atheistic ideas, for epistemological and metaphysical reasons, are profuse in different schools of Hinduism. The early Nyaya school of Hinduism, for example, was non-theist/atheist, but later Nyaya school scholars argued that God exists and offered proofs using its theory of logic. Other schools disagreed with Nyaya scholars. Samkhya, Mimamsa and Carvaka schools of Hinduism, were non-theist/atheist, arguing that &quot;God was an unnecessary metaphysical assumption&quot;. Its Vaisheshika school started as another non-theistic tradition relying on naturalism and that all matter is eternal, but it later introduced the concept of a non-creator God. The Yoga school of Hinduism accepted the concept of a &quot;personal god&quot; and left it to the Hindu to define his or her god. Advaita Vedanta taught a monistic, abstract Self and Oneness in everything, with no room for gods or deity, a perspective that Mohanty calls, &quot;spiritual, not religious&quot;. Bhakti sub-schools of Vedanta taught a creator God that is distinct from each human being.
God in Hinduism is often represented having both the feminine and masculine aspects. The notion of the feminine in deity is much more pronounced and is evident in the pairings of Shiva with Parvati (Ardhanarishvara), Vishnu accompanied by Lakshmi, Radha with Krishna and Sita with Rama.

According to Graham Schweig, Hinduism has the strongest presence of the divine feminine in world religion from ancient times to the present. The goddess is viewed as the heart of the most esoteric Saiva traditions.

=== Authority ===

Authority and eternal truths play an important role in Hinduism. Religious traditions and truths are believed to be contained in its sacred texts, which are accessed and taught by sages, gurus, saints or avatars. But there is also a strong tradition of the questioning of authority, internal debate and challenging of religious texts in Hinduism. The Hindus believe that this deepens the understanding of the eternal truths and further develops the tradition. Authority &quot;was mediated through [...] an intellectual culture that tended to develop ideas collaboratively, and according to the shared logic of natural reason.&quot; Narratives in the Upanishads present characters questioning persons of authority. The Kena Upanishad repeatedly asks &quot;kena&quot;, &#x27;by what&#x27; power something is the case. The Katha Upanishad and Bhagavad Gita present narratives where the student criticises the teacher&#x27;s inferior answers. In the Shiva Purana, Shiva questions Vishnu and Brahma. Doubt plays a repeated role in the Mahabharata. Jayadeva&#x27;s Gita Govinda presents criticism via Radha.

== Practices ==

=== Rituals ===
Most Hindus observe religious rituals at home. The rituals vary greatly among regions, villages, and individuals. They are not mandatory in Hinduism. The nature and place of rituals is an individual&#x27;s choice. Some devout Hindus perform daily rituals such as worshiping at dawn after bathing (usually at a family shrine, and typically includes lighting a lamp and offering foodstuffs before the images of deities), recitation from religious scripts, singing bhajans (devotional hymns), yoga, meditation, chanting mantras and others.

Vedic rituals of fire-oblation (&quot;yajna&quot;) and chanting of Vedic hymns are observed on special occasions, such as a Hindu wedding. Other major life-stage events, such as rituals after death, include the &quot;yajña&quot; and chanting of Vedic mantras.

The words of the mantras are &quot;themselves sacred,&quot; and &quot;do not constitute linguistic utterances.&quot; Instead, as Klostermaier notes, in their application in Vedic rituals they become magical sounds, &quot;means to an end.&quot; In the Brahmanical perspective, the sounds have their own meaning, mantras are considered &quot;primordial rhythms of creation&quot;, preceding the forms to which they refer. By reciting them the cosmos is regenerated, &quot;by enlivening and nourishing the forms of creation at their base. As long as the purity of the sounds is preserved, the recitation of the &quot;mantras&quot; will be efficacious, irrespective of whether their discursive meaning is understood by human beings.&quot;

=== &quot;Sādhanā&quot; ===

Sādhanā is derived from the root &quot;sādh-&quot;, meaning &quot;to accomplish&quot;, and denotes a means for the realisation of spiritual goals. Although different denominations of Hinduism have their own particular notions of sādhana, they share the feature of liberation from bondage. They differ on what causes bondage, how one can become free of that bondage, and who or what can lead one on that path.

=== Life-cycle rites of passage ===

Major life stage milestones are celebrated as &quot;sanskara&quot; (&quot;saṃskāra&quot;, rites of passage) in Hinduism. The rites of passage are not mandatory, and vary in details by gender, community and regionally. Gautama Dharmasutras composed in about the middle of 1st millennium BCE lists 48 sanskaras, while Gryhasutra and other texts composed centuries later list between 12 and 16 sanskaras. The list of sanskaras in Hinduism include both external rituals such as those marking a baby&#x27;s birth and a baby&#x27;s name giving ceremony, as well as inner rites of resolutions and ethics such as compassion towards all living beings and positive attitude.

The major traditional rites of passage in Hinduism include Garbhadhana (pregnancy), Pumsavana (rite before the fetus begins moving and kicking in womb), Simantonnayana (parting of pregnant woman&#x27;s hair, baby shower), &quot;Jatakarman&quot; (rite celebrating the new born baby), &quot;Namakarana&quot; (naming the child), &quot;Nishkramana&quot; (baby&#x27;s first outing from home into the world), &quot;Annaprashana&quot; (baby&#x27;s first feeding of solid food), &quot;Chudakarana&quot; (baby&#x27;s first haircut, tonsure), &quot;Karnavedha&quot; (ear piercing), &quot;Vidyarambha&quot; (baby&#x27;s start with knowledge), Upanayana (entry into a school rite), &quot;Keshanta&quot; and &quot;Ritusuddhi&quot; (first shave for boys, menarche for girls), Samavartana (graduation ceremony), Vivaha (wedding), &quot;Vratas&quot; (fasting, spiritual studies) and Antyeshti (cremation for an adult, burial for a child). In contemporary times, there is regional variation among Hindus as to which of these sanskaras are observed; in some cases, additional regional rites of passage such as &quot;Śrāddha&quot; (ritual of feeding people after cremation) are practised.

=== Bhakti (worship) ===

&quot;Bhakti&quot; refers to devotion, participation in and the love of a personal god or a representational god by a devotee. &quot;Bhakti-marga&quot; is considered in Hinduism to be one of many possible paths of spirituality and alternative means to moksha. The other paths, left to the choice of a Hindu, are &quot;Jnana-marga&quot; (path of knowledge), &quot;Karma-marga&quot; (path of works), &quot;Rāja-marga&quot; (path of contemplation and meditation).

Bhakti is practised in a number of ways, ranging from reciting mantras, japas (incantations), to individual private prayers in one&#x27;s home shrine, or in a temple before a murti or sacred image of a deity. Hindu temples and domestic altars, are important elements of worship in contemporary theistic Hinduism. While many visit a temple on special occasions, most offer daily prayers at a domestic altar, typically a dedicated part of the home that includes sacred images of deities or gurus.

One form of daily worship is aarati, or &quot;supplication&quot;, a ritual in which a flame is offered and &quot;accompanied by a song of praise&quot;. Notable aaratis include Om Jai Jagdish Hare, a Hindi prayer to Vishnu, and Sukhakarta Dukhaharta, a Marathi prayer to Ganesha. Aarti can be used to make offerings to entities ranging from deities to &quot;human exemplar[s]&quot;. For instance, Aarti is offered to Hanuman, a devotee of God, in many temples, including Balaji temples, where the primary deity is an incarnation of Vishnu. In Swaminarayan temples and home shrines, aarati is offered to Swaminarayan, considered by followers to be Supreme God.

Other personal and community practices include puja as well as aarati, kirtan, or bhajan, where devotional verses and hymns are read or poems are sung by a group of devotees. While the choice of the deity is at the discretion of the Hindu, the most observed traditions of Hindu devotion include Vaishnavism, Shaivism, and Shaktism. A Hindu may worship multiple deities, all as henotheistic manifestations of the same ultimate reality, cosmic spirit and absolute spiritual concept called Brahman. Bhakti-marga, states Pechelis, is more than ritual devotionalism, it includes practices and spiritual activities aimed at refining one&#x27;s state of mind, knowing god, participating in god, and internalising god. While bhakti practices are popular and easily observable aspect of Hinduism, not all Hindus practice bhakti, or believe in god-with-attributes (&quot;saguna Brahman&quot;). Concurrent Hindu practices include a belief in god-without-attributes (&quot;nirguna Brahman&quot;), and god within oneself.

=== Festivals ===


Hindu festivals (Sanskrit: &quot;Utsava&quot;; literally: &quot;to lift higher&quot;) are ceremonies that weave individual and social life to dharma. Hinduism has many festivals throughout the year, where the dates are set by the lunisolar Hindu calendar, many coinciding with either the full moon (&quot;Holi&quot;) or the new moon (&quot;Diwali&quot;), often with seasonal changes. Some festivals are found only regionally and they celebrate local traditions, while a few such as &quot;Holi&quot; and &quot;Diwali&quot; are pan-Hindu.
The festivals typically celebrate events from Hinduism, connoting spiritual themes and celebrating aspects of human relationships such as the sister-brother bond over the &quot;Raksha Bandhan&quot; (or Bhai Dooj) festival. The same festival sometimes marks different stories depending on the Hindu denomination, and the celebrations incorporate regional themes, traditional agriculture, local arts, family get togethers, Puja rituals and feasts.

Some major regional or pan-Hindu festivals include:

* Ashadhi Ekadashi
* Bonalu
* Chhath
* Dashain
* Diwali or Tihar or Deepawali
* Durga Puja
* Dussehra
* Ganesh Chaturthi
* Gowri Habba
* Gudi Padwa
* Holi
* Karva Chauth
* Kartika Purnima
* Krishna Janmashtami
* Maha Shivaratri
* Makar Sankranti
* Navaratri
* Onam
* Pongal
* Radhashtami
* Raksha Bandhan
* Rama Navami
* Ratha Yatra
* Sharad Purnima
* Shigmo
* Thaipusam
* Ugadi
* Vasant Panchami
* Vishu
=== Pilgrimage ===

Many adherents undertake pilgrimages, which have historically been an important part of Hinduism and remain so today. Pilgrimage sites are called &quot;Tirtha&quot;, &quot;Kshetra&quot;, &quot;Gopitha&quot; or &quot;Mahalaya&quot;. The process or journey associated with &quot;Tirtha&quot; is called &quot;Tirtha-yatra&quot;. According to the Hindu text &quot;Skanda Purana&quot;, Tirtha are of three kinds: Jangam Tirtha is to a place movable of a sadhu, a rishi, a guru; Sthawar Tirtha is to a place immovable, like Benaras, Haridwar, Mount Kailash, holy rivers; while Manas Tirtha is to a place of mind of truth, charity, patience, compassion, soft speech, Self. &quot;Tīrtha-yatra&quot; is, states Knut A. Jacobsen, anything that has a salvific value to a Hindu, and includes pilgrimage sites such as mountains or forests or seashore or rivers or ponds, as well as virtues, actions, studies or state of mind.

Pilgrimage sites of Hinduism are mentioned in the epic Mahabharata and the Puranas. Most Puranas include large sections on &quot;Tirtha Mahatmya&quot; along with tourist guides, which describe sacred sites and places to visit. In these texts, Varanasi (Benares, Kashi), Rameswaram, Kanchipuram, Dwarka, Puri, Haridwar, Sri Rangam, Vrindavan, Ayodhya, Tirupati, Mayapur, Nathdwara, twelve Jyotirlinga and Shakti Pitha have been mentioned as particularly holy sites, along with geographies where major rivers meet (&quot;sangam&quot;) or join the sea. Kumbh Mela is another major pilgrimage on the eve of the solar festival Makar Sankranti. This pilgrimage rotates at a gap of three years among four sites: Prayagraj at the confluence of the Ganges and Yamuna rivers, Haridwar near source of the Ganges, Ujjain on the Shipra river and Nashik on the bank of the Godavari river. This is one of world&#x27;s largest mass pilgrimage, with an estimated 40 to 100 million people attending the event. At this event, they say a prayer to the sun and bathe in the river, a tradition attributed to Adi Shankara.

Some pilgrimages are part of a &quot;Vrata&quot; (vow), which a Hindu may make for a number of reasons. It may mark a special occasion, such as the birth of a baby, or as part of a rite of passage such as a baby&#x27;s first haircut, or after healing from a sickness. It may also be the result of prayers answered. An alternative reason for Tirtha, for some Hindus, is to respect wishes or in memory of a beloved person after his or her death. This may include dispersing their cremation ashes in a Tirtha region in a stream, river or sea to honour the wishes of the dead. The journey to a Tirtha, assert some Hindu texts, helps one overcome the sorrow of the loss.

Other reasons for a Tirtha in Hinduism is to rejuvenate or gain spiritual merit by travelling to famed temples or bathe in rivers such as the Ganges. Tirtha has been one of the recommended means of addressing remorse and to perform penance, for unintentional errors and intentional sins, in the Hindu tradition. The proper procedure for a pilgrimage is widely discussed in Hindu texts. The most accepted view is that the greatest austerity comes from travelling on foot, or part of the journey is on foot, and that the use of a conveyance is only acceptable if the pilgrimage is otherwise impossible.

== Culture ==
The term &quot;Hindu culture&quot; refers to mean aspects of culture that pertain to the religion, such as festivals and dress codes followed by the Hindus which is mainly can be inspired from the culture of India and Southeast Asia.

=== Architecture ===
=== Art ===

Hindu art encompasses the artistic traditions and styles culturally connected to Hinduism and have a long history of religious association with Hindu scriptures, rituals and worship.

=== Calendar ===
The Hindu calendar, Panchanga () or Panjika is one of various lunisolar calendars that are traditionally used in the Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asia, with further regional variations for social and Hindu religious purposes. They adopt a similar underlying concept for timekeeping based on sidereal year for solar cycle and adjustment of lunar cycles in every three years, but differ in their relative emphasis to moon cycle or the sun cycle and the names of months and when they consider the New Year to start. Of the various regional calendars, the most studied and known Hindu calendars are the Shalivahana Shaka (Based on the King Shalivahana, also the Indian national calendar) found in the Deccan region of Southern India and the Vikram Samvat (Bikrami) found in Nepal and the North and Central regions of India – both of which emphasise the lunar cycle. Their new year starts in spring. In regions such as Tamil Nadu and Kerala, the solar cycle is emphasised and this is called the Tamil calendar (though Tamil calendar uses month names like in Hindu Calendar) and Malayalam calendar and these have origins in the second half of the 1st millennium CE. A Hindu calendar is sometimes referred to as Panchangam (पञ्चाङ्गम्), which is also known as Panjika in Eastern India.

The ancient Hindu calendar conceptual design is also found in the Hebrew calendar, the Chinese calendar, and the Babylonian calendar, but different from the Gregorian calendar. Unlike the Gregorian calendar which adds additional days to the month to adjust for the mismatch between twelve lunar cycles (354 lunar days) and nearly 365 solar days, the Hindu calendar maintains the integrity of the lunar month, but inserts an extra full month, once every 32–33 months, to ensure that the festivals and crop-related rituals fall in the appropriate season.

The Hindu calendars have been in use in the Indian subcontinent since Vedic times, and remain in use by the Hindus all over the world, particularly to set Hindu festival dates. Early Buddhist communities of India adopted the ancient Vedic calendar, later Vikrami calendar and then local Buddhist calendars. Buddhist festivals continue to be scheduled according to a lunar system. The Buddhist calendar and the traditional lunisolar calendars of Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Sri Lanka and Thailand are also based on an older version of the Hindu calendar. Similarly, the ancient Jain traditions have followed the same lunisolar system as the Hindu calendar for festivals, texts and inscriptions. However, the Buddhist and Jain timekeeping systems have attempted to use the Buddha and the Mahavira&#x27;s lifetimes as their reference points.

The Hindu calendar is also important to the practice of Hindu astrology and zodiac system. It is also employed for observing the auspicious days of deities and occasions of fasting, such as Ekadashi.

=== Physical culture ===
== Person and society ==

=== Varnas ===
Hindu society has been categorised into four classes, called &quot;varṇas&quot;. They are the &quot;Brahmins&quot;: Vedic teachers and priests; the &quot;Kshatriyas&quot;: warriors and kings; the &quot;Vaishyas&quot;: farmers and merchants; and the &quot;Shudras&quot;: servants and labourers.
The &quot;Bhagavad Gītā&quot; links the varṇa to an individual&#x27;s duty (&quot;svadharma&quot;), inborn nature (&quot;svabhāva&quot;), and natural tendencies (&quot;guṇa&quot;). The &quot;Manusmriti&quot; categorises the different castes.
Some mobility and flexibility within the varṇas challenge allegations of social discrimination in the caste system, as has been pointed out by several sociologists, although some other scholars disagree. Scholars debate whether the so-called &quot;caste system&quot; is part of Hinduism sanctioned by the scriptures or social custom. And various contemporary scholars have argued that the caste system was constructed by the British colonial regime.

A renunciant man of knowledge is usually called &quot;Varṇatita&quot; or &quot;beyond all varṇas&quot; in Vedantic works. The bhiksu is advised to not bother about the caste of the family from which he begs his food. Scholars like Adi Sankara affirm that not only is Brahman beyond all varṇas, the man who is identified with Him also transcends the distinctions and limitations of caste.

=== Yoga ===
In whatever way a Hindu defines the goal of life, there are several methods (yogas) that sages have taught for reaching that goal. Yoga is a Hindu discipline which trains the body, mind, and consciousness for health, tranquility, and spiritual insight. Texts dedicated to yoga include the &quot;Yoga Sutras&quot;, the &quot;Hatha Yoga Pradipika&quot;, the &quot;Bhagavad Gita&quot; and, as their philosophical and historical basis, the Upanishads. Yoga is means, and the four major &quot;marga&quot; (paths) of Hinduism are: Bhakti Yoga (the path of love and devotion), Karma Yoga (the path of right action), Rāja Yoga (the path of meditation), and Jñāna Yoga (the path of wisdom) An individual may prefer one or some yogas over others, according to his or her inclination and understanding. Practice of one yoga does not exclude others. The modern practice of yoga as exercise (traditionally Hatha yoga) has a contested relationship with Hinduism.

=== Symbolism ===

Hinduism has a developed system of symbolism and iconography to represent the sacred in art, architecture, literature and worship. These symbols gain their meaning from the scriptures or cultural traditions. The syllable &quot;Om&quot; (which represents the &quot;Brahman&quot; and Atman) has grown to represent Hinduism itself, while other markings such as the Swastika (from the Sanskrit: स्वस्तिक, &quot;svastika) a&quot; sign that represents auspiciousness, and &quot;Tilaka&quot; (literally, seed) on forehead – considered to be the location of spiritual third eye, marks ceremonious welcome, blessing or one&#x27;s participation in a ritual or rite of passage. Elaborate &quot;Tilaka&quot; with lines may also identify a devotee of a particular denomination. Flowers, birds, animals, instruments, symmetric mandala drawings, objects, lingam, idols are all part of symbolic iconography in Hinduism.

=== Ahiṃsā and food customs ===

Hindus advocate the practice of (nonviolence) and respect for all life because divinity is believed to permeate all beings, including plants and non-human animals. The term &#x27; appears in the Upanishads, the epic Mahabharata and is the first of the five Yamas (vows of self-restraint) in Patanjali&#x27;s Yoga Sutras. Hindu texts such as Śāṇḍilya Upanishad and Svātmārāma recommend Mitahara (eating in moderation) as one of the Yamas (virtuous Self restraints). According to Hindu beliefs, food affects the body, mind, and spirit. The Bhagavad Gita links body and mind to food one consumes in verses 17.8 through 17.10.

In accordance with , many Hindus embrace vegetarianism to respect higher forms of life. Estimates of strict lacto vegetarians in India (includes adherents of all religions) who never eat any meat, fish or eggs vary between 20% and 42%, while others are either less strict vegetarians or non-vegetarians. Those who eat meat seek Jhatka (quick death) method of meat production, and dislike Halal (slow bled death) method, believing that quick death method reduces suffering to the animal. The food habits vary with region, with Bengali Hindus and Hindus living in Himalayan regions, or river delta regions, regularly eating meat and fish. Some avoid meat on specific festivals or occasions. Observant Hindus who do eat meat almost always abstain from beef. Hinduism specifically considers &quot;Bos indicus&quot; to be sacred. The cow in Hindu society is traditionally identified as a caretaker and a maternal figure, and Hindu society honours the cow as a symbol of unselfish giving, selfless sacrifice, gentleness and tolerance.
There are many Hindu groups that have continued to abide by a strict vegetarian diet in modern times. Some adhere to a diet that is devoid of meat, eggs, and seafood.

Some Hindus such as those belonging to the Shaktism tradition, and Hindus in regions such as Bali and Nepal practise animal sacrifice. The sacrificed animal is eaten as ritual food. In contrast, the Vaishnava Hindus abhor and vigorously oppose animal sacrifice. The principle of non-violence to animals has been so thoroughly adopted in Hinduism that animal sacrifice is uncommon and historically reduced to a vestigial marginal practice.

== Institutions ==

=== Temple ===


A Hindu temple is a house of god(s). It is a space and structure designed to bring human beings and gods together, infused with symbolism to express the ideas and beliefs of Hinduism. A temple incorporates all elements of Hindu cosmology, the highest spire or dome representing Mount Meru – reminder of the abode of Brahma and the center of spiritual universe, the carvings and iconography symbolically presenting dharma, kama, artha, moksha and karma. The layout, the motifs, the plan and the building process recite ancient rituals, geometric symbolisms, and reflect beliefs and values innate within various schools of Hinduism. Hindu temples are spiritual destinations for many Hindus (not all), as well as landmarks for arts, annual festivals, rite of passage rituals, and community celebrations.

Hindu temples come in many styles, diverse locations, deploy different construction methods and are adapted to different deities and regional beliefs. Two major styles of Hindu temples include the Gopuram style found in south India, and Nagara style found in north India. Other styles include cave, forest and mountain temples. Yet, despite their differences, almost all Hindu temples share certain common architectural principles, core ideas, symbolism and themes.

Many temples feature one or more idols (murtis). The idol and Grabhgriya in the Brahma-pada (the center of the temple), under the main spire, serves as a focal point (&quot;darsana&quot;, a sight) in a Hindu temple. In larger temples, the central space typically is surrounded by an ambulatory for the devotee to walk around and ritually circumambulate the Purusa (Brahman), the universal essence.

=== Asrama ===

Traditionally the life of a Hindu is divided into four Āśramas (phases or life stages; another meaning includes monastery). The four ashramas are: Brahmacharya (student), Grihastha (householder), Vānaprastha (retired) and Sannyasa (renunciation).
Brahmacharya represents the bachelor student stage of life. Grihastha refers to the individual&#x27;s married life, with the duties of maintaining a household, raising a family, educating one&#x27;s children, and leading a family-centred and a dharmic social life. Grihastha stage starts with Hindu wedding, and has been considered the most important of all stages in sociological context, as Hindus in this stage not only pursued a virtuous life, they produced food and wealth that sustained people in other stages of life, as well as the offsprings that continued mankind. Vanaprastha is the retirement stage, where a person hands over household responsibilities to the next generation, took an advisory role, and gradually withdrew from the world. The Sannyasa stage marks renunciation and a state of disinterest and detachment from material life, generally without any meaningful property or home (ascetic state), and focused on Moksha, peace and simple spiritual life.

The Ashramas system has been one facet of the dharma concept in Hinduism. Combined with four proper goals of human life (Purusartha), the Ashramas system traditionally aimed at providing a Hindu with fulfilling life and spiritual liberation. While these stages are typically sequential, any person can enter Sannyasa (ascetic) stage and become an Ascetic at any time after the Brahmacharya stage. Sannyasa is not religiously mandatory in Hinduism, and elderly people are free to live with their families.

=== Monasticism ===
Some Hindus choose to live a monastic life (Sannyāsa) in pursuit of liberation (moksha) or another form of spiritual perfection. Monastics commit themselves to a simple and celibate life, detached from material pursuits, of meditation and spiritual contemplation. A Hindu monk is called a &quot;Sanyāsī&quot;, &quot;Sādhu&quot;, or &quot;Swāmi&quot;. A female renunciate is called a &quot;Sanyāsini&quot;. Renunciates receive high respect in Hindu society because of their simple ahiṃsā-driven lifestyle and dedication to spiritual liberation (moksha) – believed to be the ultimate goal of life in Hinduism. Some monastics live in monasteries, while others wander from place to place, depending on donated food and charity for their needs.

== History ==

Hinduism&#x27;s varied history overlaps or coincides with the development of religion in the Indian subcontinent since the Iron Age, with some of its traditions tracing back to prehistoric religions such as those of the Bronze Age Indus Valley Civilisation. While the traditional Itihasa-Purana and the Epic-Puranic chronology derived from it present Hinduism as a tradition existing for thousands of years, scholars regard Hinduism as a synthesis of various Indian cultures and traditions, with diverse roots and no single founder, which emerged after the Vedic period, between –200 BCE and .

The history of Hinduism is often divided into periods of development. The first period is the pre-Vedic period, which includes the Indus Valley Civilization and local pre-historic religions, ending at about 1750 BCE. This period was followed in northern India by the Vedic period, which saw the introduction of the historical Vedic religion with the Indo-Aryan migrations, starting somewhere between 1900 BCE to 1400 BCE. The subsequent period, between 800 BCE and 200 BCE, is &quot;a turning point between the Vedic religion and Hindu religions&quot;, and a formative period for Hinduism, Jainism and Buddhism. The Epic and Early Puranic period, from to 500 CE, saw the classical &quot;Golden Age&quot; of Hinduism (), which coincides with the Gupta Empire. In this period the six branches of Hindu philosophy evolved, namely Samkhya, Yoga, Nyaya, Vaisheshika, Mīmāṃsā, and Vedanta. Monotheistic sects like Shaivism and Vaishnavism developed during this same period through the Bhakti movement. The period from roughly 650 to 1100 CE forms the late Classical period or early Middle Ages, in which classical Puranic Hinduism is established, and Adi Shankara&#x27;s influential consolidation of Advaita Vedanta.
Hinduism under both Hindu and Islamic rulers from , saw the increasing prominence of the Bhakti movement, which remains influential today. Historic persecutions of Hindus happened under Muslim rulers and also by Christian Missionaries. In Goa, the 1560 inquisition by Portuguese colonists is also considered one of the most brutal persecutions of Hindus. The colonial period saw the emergence of various Hindu reform movements partly inspired by western movements, such as Unitarianism and Theosophy. In the Kingdom of Nepal, the Unification of Nepal by Shah dynasty was accompanied by the Hinduization of the state and continued till the .&lt;ref name=&quot;Vir 1988 https://books.google.com/books?id=yEHODCDK-8kC&amp;pg=PA56 56&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Indians were hired as plantation labourers in British colonies such as Fiji, Mauritius, Trinidad and Tobago. The Partition of India in 1947 was along religious lines, with the Republic of India emerging with a Hindu majority. Between 200,000 and one million people, including both Muslims and Hindus, were killed during the Partition of India. During the 20th century, due to the Indian diaspora, Hindu minorities have formed in all continents, with the largest communities in absolute numbers in the United States, and the United Kingdom.

Although religious conversion from and to Hinduism has been a controversial and debated subject in India, Nepal, and in Indonesia, in the 20th–21st century, many missionary organisations such as ISKCON, Sathya Sai Organization, Vedanta Society have been influential in spreading the core culture of Hinduism outside India. Religious leaders of some Hindu reform movements such as the Arya Samaj launched &quot;Shuddhi&quot; movement to proselytise and reconvert Muslims and Christians back to Hinduism, while those such as the Brahmo Samaj suggested Hinduism to be a non-missionary religion. All these sects of Hinduism have welcomed new members to their group, while other leaders of Hinduism&#x27;s diverse schools have stated that given the intensive proselytisation activities from missionary Islam and Christianity, this &quot;there is no such thing as proselytism in Hinduism&quot; view must be re-examined. There have also been an increase of Hindu identity in politics, mostly in India, Nepal and Bangladesh in the form of Hindutva. The revivalist movement was mainly started and encouraged by many organisations like RSS, BJP and other organisations of Sangh Parivar in India, while there are also many Hindu nationalist parties and organisations such as Shivsena Nepal and RPP in Nepal, HINDRAF in Malaysia, etc.

<text>A help desk is a department or person that provides assistance and information, usually for electronic or computer problems. In the mid-1990s, research by Iain Middleton of Robert Gordon University studied the value of an organization&#x27;s help desks. It found that value was derived not only from a reactive response to user issues, but also from the help desk&#x27;s unique position of communicating daily with numerous customers or employees. Information gained in areas such as technical problems, user preferences, and satisfaction can be valuable for the planning and development work of other information technology units.

A main function of the help desk is to separate issues from defects. Many issues can be solved at the help desk level such as password resets and simple misunderstandings. Some issues will be the result of actual product defect which should be forwarded to a development team for resolution.

Large help desks have a person or team responsible for managing the incoming requests, called &quot;issues&quot;; they are commonly called queue managers or queue supervisors. The queue manager is responsible for the issue queues, which can be set up in various ways depending on the help desk size or structure. Typically, large help desks have several teams that are experienced in working on different issues. The queue manager will assign an issue to one of the specialized teams based on the type of issue raised. Some help desks may have telephone systems with ACD splits ensuring that calls about specific topics are put through to analysts with the requisite experience or knowledge.

<text>Henry Bordeaux (; 25 January 1870 – 29 March 1963) was a French writer and lawyer.

Bordeaux came from a family of lawyers of Savoy. He was born in Thonon-les-Bains, Haute-Savoie. His grandfather was a magistrate and his father served on the Chambéry bar. During his early life, he relocated between Savoy and Paris and the tensions between provincial and city life influenced his writings. In his professional life he observed closely the dissolution of numerous families and analysed the causes and consequences of these. From the age of seventeen he spent three years in Paris studying law. Then he returned to practice law in Savoy. He returned to Paris after the publication of his first book during 1894. When his father died in 1896 he returned to Savoy.

The writings of Bordeaux reflect the values of traditional provincial Catholic communities. One recurring theme is loyalty. Loyalty is pervasive, and it applies to family, country and God. This theme is particularly evidenced in the novels &quot;La Peur de vivre&quot; and &quot;Les Roquevillard.&quot;

Bordeaux was elected to the Académie française on 22 May 1919. This elite group of writers, popularly known as the &quot;immortals,&quot; are responsible for establishing and maintaining the grammar, usage and acceptance of vocabulary into standard French.

He was a contributor to &quot;Le Visage de l&#x27;Italie&quot;, a 1929 book about Italy prefaced by Benito Mussolini.

Bordeaux died in Paris in 1963.

==Popular culture==
Henry Miller makes fun of Bordeaux in Tropic of Cancer. &quot;I have yet to meet a whore who doesn&#x27;t know of Henry Bordeaux! . . . It seemed to me that I heard her say, &#x27;quand il n&#x27;y aura plus de temps.&#x27; It sounded like that anyway. In the state I was in, a phrase like that was worth a hundred francs. I wondered if it was her own or if she had pulled it from Henry Bordeaux.&quot;

<doc id="13546" wikidata="Q34190" url="?curid=13546" title="Henry Fielding">
<text>Henry Fielding (22 April 1707 – 8 October 1754) was an English writer and magistrate known for the use of humour and satire in his works. His 1749 comic novel &quot;The History of Tom Jones, a Foundling&quot; was a seminal work in the genre. Along with Samuel Richardson, Fielding is seen as the founder of the traditional English novel. He also played an important role in the history of law enforcement in the United Kingdom, using his authority as a magistrate to found the Bow Street Runners, London&#x27;s first professional police force.

==Early life==
Henry Fielding was born on 22 April 1707 at Sharpham Park, the seat of his mother&#x27;s family in Sharpham, Somerset. He was the son of Lt.-Gen. Edmund Fielding and Sarah Gould, daughter of Sir Henry Gould. A scion of the Earl of Denbigh, his father was nephew of William Fielding, 3rd Earl of Denbigh.

Educated at Eton College, Fielding began a lifelong friendship with William Pitt the Elder. His mother died when he was 11. A suit for custody was brought by his grandmother against his charming but irresponsible father, Lt Gen. Edmund Fielding. The settlement placed Henry in his grandmother&#x27;s care, but he continued to see his father in London.

In 1725, Henry tried to abduct his cousin Sarah Andrews (with whom he was infatuated) while she was on her way to church. He fled to avoid prosecution.

In 1728, Fielding travelled to Leiden to study classics and law at the university. However, penury forced him back to London, where he began writing for the theatre. Some of his work savagely criticised the government of Prime Minister Sir Robert Walpole.

==Dramatist and novelist==
According to George R. Levine, Henry Fielding, in his first writings used two forms of &quot;rhetorical poses&quot; that were popular during the eighteenth century. Henry Fielding would construct &quot;the non-ironic pseudonym such as Addison and Steele used in the &quot;Spectator,&quot; and the ironic mask or &quot;Persona&quot;, such as Swift used in A Modest Proposal.&quot; The Theatrical Licensing Act 1737 is said to be a direct response to his activities in writing for the theatre. Although the play that triggered the act was the unproduced, anonymously authored &quot;The Golden Rump&quot;, Fielding&#x27;s dramatic satires had set the tone. Once it was passed, political satire on stage became all but impossible. Fielding retired from the theatre and resumed his legal career to support his wife Charlotte Craddock and two children by becoming a barrister, joining the Middle Temple in 1737 and being called to the bar there in 1740.

Fielding&#x27;s lack of financial acumen meant the family often endured periods of poverty, but they were helped by Ralph Allen, a wealthy benefactor, on whom Squire Allworthy in &quot;Tom Jones&quot; would be based. Allen went on to provide for the education and support of Fielding&#x27;s children after the writer&#x27;s death.
Fielding never stopped writing political satire and satires of current arts and letters. &quot;The Tragedy of Tragedies&quot; (for which Hogarth designed the frontispiece) was, for example, quite successful as a printed play. Based on his earlier &quot;Tom Thumb&quot;, this was another of Fielding&#x27;s irregular plays published under the name of H. Scriblerus Secundus, a pseudonym intended to link himself ideally with the Scriblerus Club of literary satirists founded by Jonathan Swift, Alexander Pope and John Gay. He also contributed several works to journals.

From 1734 to 1739, Fielding wrote anonymously for the leading Tory periodical, &quot;The Craftsman&quot;, against the Prime Minister, Sir Robert Walpole. His patron was the opposition Whig MP George Lyttelton, a boyhood friend from Eton to whom he later dedicated &quot;Tom Jones&quot;. Lyttelton followed his leader Lord Cobham in forming a Whig opposition to Walpole&#x27;s government called the Cobhamites, which included another of Fielding&#x27;s Eton friends, William Pitt. In &quot;The Craftsman&quot;, Fielding voiced an opposition attack on bribery and corruption in British politics. Despite writing for the opposition to Walpole, which included Tories as well as Whigs, Fielding was &quot;unshakably a Whig&quot; and often praised Whig heroes such as the Duke of Marlborough and Gilbert Burnet.

Fielding dedicated his play &quot;Don Quixote in England&quot; to the opposition Whig leader Lord Chesterfield. It appeared on 17 April 1734, the same day writs were issued for the general election. He dedicated his 1735 play &quot;The Universal Gallant&quot; to Charles Spencer, 3rd Duke of Marlborough, a political follower of Chesterfield. The other prominent opposition paper, &quot;Common Sense&quot;, founded by Chesterfield and Lyttelton, was named after a character in Fielding&#x27;s &quot;Pasquin&quot; (1736). Fielding wrote at least two articles for it in 1737 and 1738.

Fielding continued to air political views in satirical articles and newspapers in the late 1730s and early 1740s. He was the main writer and editor from 1739 to 1740 for the satirical paper &quot;The Champion&quot;, which was sharply critical of Walpole&#x27;s government and of pro-government literary and political writers. He sought to evade libel charges by making its political attacks so funny or embarrassing to the victim that a publicized court case would seem even worse. He later became chief writer for the Whig government of Henry Pelham.

Fielding took to novel writing in 1741, angered by Samuel Richardson&#x27;s success with &quot;Pamela&quot;. His first success was an anonymous parody of that novel, called &quot;Shamela&quot;. This follows the model of Tory satirists of the previous generation, notably Swift and Gay.

Fielding followed this with &quot;Joseph Andrews&quot; (1742), an original work supposedly dealing with Pamela&#x27;s brother, Joseph. His purpose, however, was more than parody, for as stated in the preface, he intended a &quot;kind of writing which I do not remember to have seen hitherto attempted in our language.&quot; In what Fielding called a &quot;comic epic poem in prouse&quot;, he blended two classical traditions: that of the epic, which had been poetic, and that of the drama, but emphasizing the comic rather than the tragic. Another distinction of &quot;Joseph Andrews&quot; and the novels to come was use of everyday reality of character and action, as opposed to the fables of the past. While begun as a parody, it developed into an accomplished novel in its own right and is seen as Fielding&#x27;s debut as a serious novelist. In 1743, he published a novel in the &quot;Miscellanies&quot; volume III (which was the first volume of the Miscellanies): &quot;The Life and Death of Jonathan Wild, the Great&quot;, which is sometimes counted as his first, as he almost certainly began it before he wrote &quot;Shamela&quot; and &quot;Joseph Andrews&quot;. It is a satire of Walpole equating him and Jonathan Wild, the gang leader and highwayman. He implicitly compares the Whig party in Parliament with a gang of thieves run by Walpole, whose constant desire to be a &quot;Great Man&quot; (a common epithet with Walpole) ought to culminate in the antithesis of greatness: hanging.

Fielding&#x27;s anonymous &quot;The Female Husband&quot; (1746) fictionalizes a case in which a female transvestite was tried for duping another woman into marriage; this was one of several small pamphlets costing sixpence. Though a minor piece in his life&#x27;s work, it reflects his preoccupation with fraud, shamming and masks.

His greatest work is &quot;The History of Tom Jones, a Foundling&quot; (1749), a meticulous comic novel with elements of the picaresque and the Bildungsroman, telling a convoluted tale of how a foundling came into a fortune. The novel tells of Tom&#x27;s alienation from his foster father, Squire Allworthy, and his sweetheart, Sophia Western, and his reconciliation with them after lively and dangerous adventures on the road and in London. It triumphs as a presentation of English life and character in the mid-18th century. Every social type is represented and through them every shade of moral behaviour. Fielding&#x27;s varied style tempers the basic seriousness of the novel and his authorial comment before each chapter adds a dimension to a conventional, straightforward narrative.

===Sister===
Fielding&#x27;s younger sister, Sarah, also became a successful writer. Her novel &quot;The Governess, or The Little Female Academy&quot; (1749) is thought to be the first in English aimed expressly at children.

==Marriages==
Fielding married Charlotte Craddock in 1734 at the Church of St Mary in Charlcombe, Somerset. She died in 1744, and he later modelled the heroines of &quot;Tom Jones&quot; and of &quot;Amelia&quot; on her. They had five children; their only daughter Henrietta died at the age of 23, having already been &quot;in deep decline&quot; when she married a military engineer, James Gabriel Montresor, some months before. Three years after Charlotte&#x27;s death, Fielding disregarded public opinion by marrying her former maid Mary Daniel, who was pregnant. Mary bore five children: three daughters who died young, and two sons, William and Allen.

==Jurist and magistrate==

Despite the scandal, Fielding&#x27;s consistent anti-Jacobitism and support for the Church of England led to his appointment a year later as Westminster&#x27;s chief magistrate, while his literary career went from strength to strength. Most of his work concerned London&#x27;s criminal population of thieves, informers, gamblers and prostitutes. Though living in a corrupt and callous society, he became noted for impartial judgements, incorruptibility and compassion for those whom social inequities led into crime. The income from his office (&quot;the dirtiest money upon earth&quot;) dwindled as he refused to take money from the very poor. Joined by his younger half-brother John, he helped found what some call London&#x27;s first police force, the Bow Street Runners, in 1749.

According to the historian G. M. Trevelyan, the Fieldings were two of the best magistrates in 18th-century London, who did much to enhance judicial reform and improve prison conditions. Fielding&#x27;s influential pamphlets and enquiries included a proposal for abolishing public hangings. This did not, however, imply opposition to capital punishment as such – as is evident, for example, in his presiding in 1751 over the trial of the notorious criminal James Field, finding him guilty in a robbery and sentencing him to hang. John Fielding, despite being blind by then, succeeded his older brother as chief magistrate, becoming known as the &quot;Blind Beak of Bow Street&quot; for his ability to recognise criminals by their voices alone.
In January 1752 Fielding started a fortnightly, &quot;The Covent-Garden Journal&quot;, published under the pseudonym &quot;Sir Alexander Drawcansir, Knt., Censor of Great Britain&quot; until November of that year. Here Fielding challenged the &quot;armies of Grub Street&quot; and periodical writers of the day in a conflict that became the Paper War of 1752–1753.

Fielding then published &quot;Examples of the Interposition of Providence in the Detection and Punishment of Murder&quot; (1752), a treatise rejecting deistic and materialistic visions of the world in favour of belief in God&#x27;s presence and divine judgement, arguing that the murder rate was rising due to neglect of the Christian religion. In 1753 he wrote &quot;Proposals for Making an Effectual Provision for the Poor&quot;.

==Death==
Fielding&#x27;s humanitarian commitment to justice in the 1750s (for instance in support of Elizabeth Canning) coincided with rapid deterioration in his health. Gout, asthma and cirrhosis of the liver left him on crutches, and with other afflictions sent him to Portugal in 1754 to seek a cure, only to die two months later in Lisbon, reportedly in pain and mental distress. His tomb there is in the British Cemetery (&quot;Cemitério Inglês&quot;), the graveyard of St. George&#x27;s Church, Lisbon.

<doc id="13547" wikidata="Q459409" url="?curid=13547" title="Hate crime">
<text>A hate crime (also known a bias crime) is crime where a perpetrator targets a victim because of their physical appearance or perceived membership of a certain social group.

Examples of such groups can include, and are almost exclusively limited to race, ethnicity, disability, language, nationality, physical appearance, political views, political affiliation, age, religion, sex, gender identity, or sexual orientation. Non-criminal actions that are motivated by these reasons are often called &quot;bias incidents&quot;.

Incidents may involve physical assault, homicide, damage to property, bullying, harassment, verbal abuse (which includes slurs) or insults, mate crime, or offensive graffiti or letters (hate mail).

In the criminal law of the United States, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) defines a hate crime as a traditional offense like murder, arson, or vandalism with an added element of bias. Hate itself is not a hate crime but committing a crime motivated by bias against one or more of the social groups listed above, or by bias against their derivatives constitutes a hate crime. A hate crime law is a law intended to deter bias-motivated violence. Hate crime laws are distinct from laws against hate speech: hate crime laws enhance the penalties associated with conduct which is already criminal under other laws, while hate speech laws criminalize a category of speech. Hate speech is a factor for sentencing enhancement in the United States, distinct from laws that criminalize speech.

==History==
The term &quot;hate crime&quot; came into common usage in the United States during the 1980s, but it is often used retrospectively in order to describe events which occurred prior to that era. From the Roman persecution of Christians to the Nazi slaughter of Jews, hate crimes were committed by individuals as well as governments long before the term was commonly used. A major part of defining crimes as hate crimes is determining that they have been committed against members of historically oppressed groups.

As Europeans began to colonize the world from the 16th century onwards, indigenous peoples in the colonized areas, such as Native Americans, increasingly became the targets of bias-motivated intimidation and violence. During the past two centuries, typical examples of hate crimes in the U.S. include lynchings of African Americans, largely in the South, lynchings of Europeans in the East, and lynchings of Mexicans and Chinese in the West; cross burnings in order to intimidate black activists or drive black families out of predominantly white neighborhoods both during and after Reconstruction; assaults on lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people; the painting of swastikas on Jewish synagogues; and xenophobic responses to a variety of minority ethnic groups.

The verb &quot;to lynch&quot; is attributed to the actions of Charles Lynch, an 18th-century Virginia Quaker. Lynch, other militia officers, and justices of the peace rounded up Tory sympathizers who were given a summary trial at an informal court; sentences which were handed down included whipping, property seizure, coerced pledges of allegiance, and conscription into the military. Originally, the term referred to the extrajudicial organized but unauthorized punishment of criminals. It later evolved to describe executions which were committed outside &quot;ordinary justice&quot;. It is highly associated with white suppression of African Americans in the South, and periods of weak or nonexistent police authority, as in certain frontier areas of the Old West.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the violence against people of Chinese origin significantly increased on the background of accusation of spreading the virus. In May 2020, the Polish-based &quot;NEVER AGAIN&quot; Association published its report titled &quot;The Virus of Hate: The Brown Book of Epidemic&quot;, that documented numerous acts of racism, xenophobia, and discrimination that occurred in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as cases of spreading hate speech and conspiracy theories about the epidemic by the Alt-Right.

==Psychological effects==
Hate crimes can have significant and wide-ranging psychological consequences, not only for their direct victims but for others of the group as well. Moreover, victims of hate crimes often experience a sense of victimization that goes beyond the initial crime, creating a heightened sense of vulnerability towards future victimization. In many ways, hate crime victimization can be reminder to victims of their marginalized status in society, and for immigrants or refugees, may also serve to make them relive the violence that drove them to seek refuge in another country. A 1999 U.S. study of lesbian and gay victims of violent hate crimes documented that they experienced higher levels of psychological distress, including symptoms of depression and anxiety, than lesbian and gay victims of comparable crimes which were not motivated by antigay bias. A manual issued by the Attorney-General of the Province of Ontario in Canada lists the following consequences:

; Impact on the individual victim: psychological and affective disturbances; repercussions on the victim&#x27;s identity and self-esteem; both reinforced by a specific hate crime&#x27;s degree of violence, which is usually stronger than that of a common crime.
; Effect on the targeted group: generalized terror in the group to which the victim belongs, inspiring feelings of vulnerability among its other members, who could be the next hate crime victims.
; Effect on other vulnerable groups: ominous effects on minority groups or on groups that identify themselves with the targeted group, especially when the referred hate is based on an ideology or a doctrine that preaches simultaneously against several groups.
; Effect on the community as a whole: divisions and factionalism arising in response to hate crimes are particularly damaging to multicultural societies.

Hate crime victims can also develop depression and psychological trauma. They suffer from typical symptoms of trauma: lack of concentration, fear, unintentional rethinking of the incident and feeling vulnerable or unsafe. These symptoms may be severe enough to qualify as PTSD. In the United States, the Supreme Court has accepted the claim that hate crimes cause &#x27;distinct emotional harm&#x27; to victims. People who have been victims of hate crimes avoid spaces where they feel unsafe which can make communities less functional when ties with police are strained by persistent group fears and feelings of insecurity. In the United States, hate crime has been shown to reduce educational attainment among affected groups—particularly among black, non-Hispanic victims.

A review of European and American research indicates that terrorist bombings cause Islamophobia and hate crimes to flare up but, in calmer times, they subside again, although to a relatively high level. Terrorists&#x27; most persuasive message is that of fear; a primary and strong emotion, fear increases risk estimates and has distortive effects on the perception of ordinary Muslims. Widespread Islamophobic prejudice seems to contribute to anti-Muslim hate crimes, but indirectly; terrorist attacks and intensified Islamophobic prejudice serve as a window of opportunity for extremist groups and networks.

==Motivation==

Sociologists Jack McDevitt and Jack Levin&#x27;s 2002 study into the motives for hate crimes found four motives, and reported that &quot;thrill-seeking&quot; accounted for 66 percent of all hate crimes overall in the United States:

* &quot;Thrill-seeking&quot; – perpetrators engage in hate crimes for excitement and drama. Often, there is no greater purpose behind the crimes, with victims being vulnerable because they have an ethnic, religious, sexual or gender background that differs from their attackers. While the actual animosity present in such a crime can be quite low, thrill-seeking crimes were determined to often be dangerous, with 70 percent of thrill-seeking hate crimes studied involving physical attacks. Typically, these attacks are perpetrated by groups of young teenagers or adults seeking excitement.
* &quot;Defensive&quot; – perpetrators engage in hate crimes out of a belief they are protecting their communities. Often, these are triggered by a certain background event. Perpetrators believe society supports their actions but is too afraid to act and thus they believe they have communal assent in their actions.
* &quot;Retaliatory&quot; – perpetrators engage in hate crimes out of a desire for revenge. This can be in response to perceived personal slights, other hate crimes or terrorism. The &quot;avengers&quot; target members of a group whom they believe committed the original crime, even if the victims had nothing to do with it. These kinds of hate crimes are a common occurrence after terrorist attacks.
* &quot;Mission offenders&quot; – perpetrators engage in hate crimes out of ideological reasons. They consider themselves to be crusaders, often for a religious or racial cause. They may write complex explanations for their views and target symbolically important sites, trying to maximize damage. They believe that there is no other way to accomplish their goals, which they consider to be justification for excessive violence against innocents. This kind of hate crime often overlaps with terrorism, and is considered by the FBI to be both the rarest and deadliest form of hate crime.

In a later article, Levin and fellow sociologist Ashley Reichelmann found that following the September 11 attacks, thrill motivated hate crimes tended to decrease as the overall rate of violent crime decreased while defensive hate crimes increased substantially. Specifically, they found that 60% of all hate motivated assaults in 2001 were perpetrated against those the offenders perceived to be Middle Eastern and were motivated mainly by a desire for revenge. Levin and McDevitt also argued that while thrill crimes made up the majority of hate crimes in the 1990s, after September 11, 2001, hate crimes in the United States shifted from thrill offenses by young groups to more defensive oriented and more often perpetrated by older individuals respond to a precipitating event.

The motivations of hate-crime offenders are complex. Therefore, there is no one theory that can completely account for hate-motived crimes. However, Mark Austin Walters previously attempted to synthesize three interdisciplinary theories to account for the behavior of hate-crime offenders:

1. Strain Theory: suggests that hate crimes are motivated by perceived economic and material inequality, which results in differential attitudes towards outsiders who may be viewed as “straining” already scarce resources. An example of this can be seen in the discourse surrounding some people&#x27;s apprehension towards immigrants, who feel as though immigrants and/or refugees receive extra benefits from government and strain social systems.

2. Doing Difference Theory: suggests that some individuals fear groups other than their own and, as a result of this, seek to suppress different cultures.
3. Self-Control Theory: suggests that a person&#x27;s upbringing determines their tolerance threshold towards others, here individuals with low self-esteem are often impulsive, have poor employment prospects, and have little academic success.

Walters argues that a synthesis of these theories provides a more well-rounded scope of the motivations behind hate crimes, where he explains that social, cultural, and individual factors interact to elicit the violence behavior of individuals with low self-control.

Additionally, psychological perspectives within the realm of behaviorism have also contributed to theoretical explanations for the motivations of hate crimes particularly as it relates to conditioning and social learning. For instance, the seminal work of John B. Watson and Rosalie Rayner illustrated that hate, a form of prejudice, was a conditioned emotional response. Later on, the work of Arthur Staats and Carolyn Staats illustrated that both hate and fear were learned behavioral responses. In their experiment, Staats and Staats paired positive and negative works with several different nationalities. The pairing of verbal stimuli was a form of conditioning, and it was found to influence attitude formation and attitude change.

These studies are of interest when considering modern forms of prejudice directed towards ethnic, religious, or racial groups. For instance, there was a significant increase in Islamophobia and hate crimes following the 9/11 terrorist attacks on the United States. Simultaneously, the news media was consistently pairing Islam with terrorism. Thus, the pairing of verbal stimuli in the media contributed to widespread prejudice towards all Arab individuals in a process that is known as semantic generalization, which refers to how a learned behavior can generalize across situations based on meaning or other abstract representations. These occurrences continue today with the social and political discourse that contribute to the context in which people learn, come to form beliefs, and engage in behavioural actions. Although not all individuals with prejudicial attitudes go on to engage in hate-motived crime, it has been suggested that hate-crime offenders come to learn their prejudices through social interaction, consumption of biased news media, political hate speech, and internal misrepresentations of cultures other than their own.

=== Risk management for hate-crime offenders ===
Compared to other types of offending, there has been relatively little research directed towards the management of hate-crime offenders. However, risk management for hate-crime offenders is an important consideration for forensic psychology and public safety in order to decrease the potential for future harm. Forensic risk assessments are designed to evaluate the likelihood of re-offending and to aid in risk management strategies. While not specifically designed for hate crime offenders, some of the most common risk assessment tools used to assess risk for hate-crime offenders include the Violence Risk Appraisal Guide (VRAG;), the Historical Clinical Risk Management 20 (HCR-20;) and the Psychopathy Checklist-Revised (PCL-R;). Research has shown that assessing and addressing risk posed by hate-crime offenders is especially complex, and while existing tools are useful, it is important to incorporate bias-oriented factors (Dunbar et al., 2005). That is, hate-crime offenders do tend to score high risk on tools including both static and dynamic factors, but severity has been found to not be solely related to these factors, illustrating a need to incorporate biases and ideological factors.

==Laws==
Hate crime laws generally fall into one of several categories:
# laws defining specific bias-motivated acts as distinct crimes;
# criminal penalty-enhancement laws;
# laws creating a distinct civil cause of action for hate crimes; and
# laws requiring administrative agencies to collect hate crime statistics. Sometimes (as in Bosnia and Herzegovina), the laws focus on war crimes, genocide, and crimes against humanity with the prohibition against discriminatory action limited to public officials.

===Europe and Asia===

====Council of Europe====
Since 2006, with the Additional Protocol to the Convention on Cybercrime, most signatories to that Convention – mostly members of the Council of Europe – committed to punish as a crime racist and xenophobic hate speech done through the internet.
====Andorra====
Discriminatory acts constituting harassment or infringement of a person&#x27;s dignity on the basis of origin, citizenship, race, religion, or gender (Penal Code Article 313). Courts have cited bias-based motivation in delivering sentences, but there is no explicit penalty enhancement provision in the Criminal Code. The government does not track hate crime statistics, although they are relatively rare.

====Armenia====
Armenia has a penalty-enhancement statute for crimes with ethnic, racial, or religious motives (Criminal Code Article 63).

====Austria====
Austria has a penalty-enhancement statute for reasons like repeating a crime, being especially cruel, using others&#x27; helpless states, playing a leading role in a crime, or committing a crime with racist, xenophobic or especially reprehensible motivation (Penal Code section 33(5)). Austria is a party to the Convention on Cybercrime, but not the Additional Protocol.

====Azerbaijan====
Azerbaijan has a penalty-enhancement statute for crimes motivated by racial, national, or religious hatred (Criminal Code Article 61). Murder and infliction of serious bodily injury motivated by racial, religious, national, or ethnic intolerance are distinct crimes (Article 111). Azerbaijan is a party to the Convention on Cybercrime, but not the Additional Protocol.

====Belarus====
Belarus has a penalty-enhancement statute for crimes motivated by racial, national, and religious hatred and discord.

====Belgium====
Belgium&#x27;s Act of 25 February 2003 (&quot;aimed at combating discrimination and modifying the Act of 15 February 1993 which establishes the Centre for Equal Opportunities and the Fight against Racism&quot;) establishes a penalty-enhancement for crimes involving discrimination on the basis of gender, supposed race, color, descent, national or ethnic origin, sexual orientation, civil status, birth, fortune, age, religious or philosophical beliefs, current or future state of health and handicap or physical features. The Act also &quot;provides for a civil remedy to address discrimination.&quot; The Act, along with the Act of 20 January 2003 (&quot;on strengthening legislation against racism&quot;), requires the centre to collect and publish statistical data on racism and discriminatory crimes. Belgium is a party to the Convention on Cybercrime, but not the Additional Protocol.

====Bosnia and Herzegovina====
The Criminal Code of Bosnia and Herzegovina (enacted 2003) &quot;contains provisions prohibiting discrimination by public officials on grounds, inter alia, of race, skin colour, national or ethnic background, religion and language and prohibiting the restriction by public officials of the language rights of the citizens in their relations with the authorities (Article 145/1 and 145/2).&quot;

====Bulgaria====
Bulgarian criminal law prohibits certain crimes motivated by racism, xenophobia and sexual orientation (since 2023), but a 1999 report by the European Commission against Racism and Intolerance found that it does not appear that those provisions &quot;have ever resulted in convictions before the courts in Bulgaria.&quot;

====Croatia====
The Croatian Penal Code explicitly defines hate crime in article 89 as &quot;any crime committed out of hatred for someone&#x27;s race, skin color, sex, sexual orientation, language, religion, political or other belief, national or social background, asset, birth, education, social condition, age, health condition or other attribute&quot;. On 1 January 2013, a new Penal Code was introduced with the recognition of a hate crime based on &quot;race, skin color, religion, national or ethnic background, sexual orientation or gender identity&quot;.

====Czech Republic====
The Czech legislation finds its constitutional basis in the principles of equality and non-discrimination contained in the Charter of Fundamental Rights and Basic Freedoms. From there, we can trace two basic lines of protection against hate-motivated incidents: one passes through criminal law, the other through civil law.
The current Czech criminal legislation has implications both for decisions about guilt (affecting the decision whether to find a defendant guilty or not guilty) and decisions concerning sentencing (affecting the extent of the punishment imposed). It has three levels, to wit:
* a circumstance determining whether an act is a crime – hate motivation is included in the basic constituent elements. If hate motivation is not proven, a conviction for a hate crime is not possible.
* a circumstance determining the imposition of a higher penalty – hate motivation is included in the qualified constituent elements for some types of crimes (murder, bodily harm). If hate motivation is not proven, the penalty is imposed according to the scale specified for the basic constituent elements of the crime.
* general aggravating circumstance – the court is obligated to take the hate motivation into account as a general aggravating circumstance and determines the amount of penalty to impose. Nevertheless, it is not possible to add together a general aggravating circumstance and a circumstance determining the imposition of a higher penalty. (see Annex for details)
Current criminal legislation does not provide for special penalties for acts that target another by reason of his sexual orientation, age or health status. Only the constituent elements of the criminal offence of Incitement to hatred towards a group of persons or to the curtailment of their rights and freedoms and general aggravating circumstances include attacking a so-called different group of people. Such a group of people can then, of course, be also defined by sexual orientation, age or health status. A certain disparity has thus been created between, on the one hand, those groups of people who are victimized by reason of their skin color, faith, nationality, ethnicity or political persuasion and enjoy increased protection, and, on the other hand, those groups that are victimized by reason of their sexual orientation, age or health status and are not granted increased protection. This gap in protection against attacks motivated by the victim&#x27;s sexual orientation, age or health status cannot be successfully bridged by interpretation. Interpretation by analogy is inadmissible in criminal law, sanctionable motivations being exhaustively enumerated.

====Denmark====
Although Danish law does not include explicit hate crime provisions, &quot;section 80(1) of the Criminal Code instructs courts to take into account the gravity of the offence and the offender&#x27;s motive when meting out penalty, and therefore to attach importance to the racist motive of crimes in determining sentence.&quot; In recent years judges have used this provision to increase sentences on the basis of racist motives.

Since 1992, the Danish Civil Security Service (PET) has released statistics on crimes with apparent racist motivation.

====Estonia====
Under section 151 of the Criminal Code of Estonia of 6 June 2001, which entered into force on 1 September 2002, with amendments and supplements and as amended by the Law of 8 December 2011, &quot;activities which publicly incite to hatred, violence or discrimination on the basis of nationality, race, colour, sex, language, origin, religion, sexual orientation, political opinion, or financial or social status, if this results in danger to the life, health or property of a person, are punishable by a fine of up to 300 fine units or by detention&quot;.

====Finland====
Finnish Criminal Code 515/2003 (enacted 31 January 2003) makes &quot;committing a crime against a person, because of his national, racial, ethnical or equivalent group&quot; an aggravating circumstance in sentencing. In addition, ethnic agitation () is criminalized and carries a fine or a prison sentence of not more than two years. The prosecution need not prove that an actual danger to an ethnic group is caused but only that malicious message is conveyed. A more aggravated hate crime, warmongering (), carries a prison sentence of one to ten years. However, in case of warmongering, the prosecution must prove an overt act that evidently increases the risk that Finland is involved in a war or becomes a target for a military operation. The act in question may consist of
# illegal violence directed against a foreign country or its citizens,
# systematic dissemination of false information on Finnish foreign policy or defense
# public influence on the public opinion towards a pro-war viewpoint or
# public suggestion that a foreign country or Finland should engage in an aggressive act.

====France====
In 2003, France enacted penalty-enhancement hate crime laws for crimes motivated by bias against the victim&#x27;s actual or perceived ethnicity, nation, race, religion, or sexual orientation. The penalties for murder were raised from 30 years (for non-hate crimes) to life imprisonment (for hate crimes), and the penalties for violent attacks leading to permanent disability were raised from 10 years (for non-hate crimes) to 15 years (for hate crimes).

====Georgia====
&quot;There is no general provision in Georgian law for racist motivation to be considered an aggravating circumstance in prosecutions of ordinary offenses. Certain crimes involving racist motivation are, however, defined as specific offenses in the Georgian Criminal Code of 1999, including murder motivated by racial, religious, national or ethnic intolerance (article 109); infliction of serious injuries motivated by racial, religious, national or ethnic intolerance (article 117); and torture motivated by racial, religious, national or ethnic intolerance (article 126). ECRI reported no knowledge of cases in which this law has been enforced. There is no systematic monitoring or data collection on discrimination in Georgia.&quot;

====Germany====
The German Criminal Code does not have hate crime legislation, instead, it criminalizes hate speech under a number of different laws, including Volksverhetzung. In the German legal framework motivation is not taken into account while identifying the element of the offence. However, within the sentencing procedure the judge can define certain principles for determining punishment. In section 46 of the German Criminal Code it is stated that &quot;the motives and aims of the perpetrator; the state of mind reflected in the act and the willfulness involved in its commission&quot; can be taken into consideration when determining the punishment; under this statute, hate and bias have been taken into consideration in sentencing in past cases.

Hate crimes are not specifically tracked by German police, but have been studied separately: a recently published EU &quot;Report on Racism&quot; finds that racially motivated attacks are frequent in Germany, identifying 18,142 incidences for 2006, of which 17,597 were motivated by right-wing ideologies, both about a 14% year-by-year increase. Relative to the size of the population, this represents an eightfold higher rate of hate crimes than reported in the US during the same period. Awareness of hate crimes in Germany remains low.

====Greece====
Article Law 927/1979 &quot;Section 1,1 penalises incitement to discrimination, hatred or violence towards individuals or groups because of
their racial, national or religious origin, through public written or oral expressions; Section 1,2 prohibits the establishment of, and membership in, organisations which organise propaganda and activities aimed at racial discrimination; Section 2 punishes public expression of offensive ideas; Section 3 penalises the act of refusing, in the exercise of one&#x27;s occupation, to sell a commodity or to supply a service on racial grounds.&quot; Public prosecutors may press charges even if the victim does not file a complaint. However, as of 2003, no convictions had been attained under the law.

====Hungary====
Violent action, cruelty, and coercion by threat made on the basis of the victim&#x27;s actual or perceived national, ethnic, religious status or membership in a particular social group are punishable under article 174/B of the Hungarian Criminal Code. This article was added to the Code in 1996. Hungary is a party to the Convention on Cybercrime, but not the Additional Protocol.

====Iceland====
Section 233a of the Icelandic Penal Code states &quot;Anyone who in a ridiculing, slanderous, insulting, threatening or any other manner publicly abuses a person or a group of people on the basis of their nationality, skin colour, race, religion or sexual orientation, shall be fined or jailed for up to two years.&quot; Iceland is a party to the Convention on Cybercrime, but not the Additional Protocol.

==== India ====
India does not have any specific laws governing hate crimes in general other than hate speech which is covered under the Indian Penal Code.

====Ireland====

In legal effect since December 31, 2024 Ireland implemented broad-based comprehensive legislation on hate crimes.

The Prohibition of Incitement to Hatred Act 1989 created the offence of inciting hatred against a group of persons on account of their race, colour, nationality, religion, ethnic or national origins, membership of the Traveller community (an indigenous minority group), or sexual orientation. Frustration at the low number of prosecutions (18 by 2011) was attributed to a misconception that the law addressed hate crimes more generally as opposed to incitement in particular.

In 2019, a UN rappourteur told Irish representatives at the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, meeting at UN Geneva, to introduce new hate crime legislation to combat the low prosecution rate for offences under the 1989 act – particularly for online hate speech – and lack of training for the Garda Síochána on racially-motivated crimes. The rapporteur&#x27;s points came during a rise in anti-immigrant rhetoric and racist attacks in Ireland and were based on recommendations submitted by the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission and numerous other civil society organisations. Reforms are supported by the Irish Network Against Racism.

The Criminal Justice (Incitement to Violence or Hatred and Hate Offences) Bill known as the &quot;Hate Crime Bill&quot;, prohibiting hate speech or incitement to hate crimes based on protected characteristics, is in its Third Stage at the Seanad, Ireland&#x27;s upper house, and the &quot;Irish Times&quot; reports it is likely to become law in late 2023. It has drawn concern from the Irish Council for Civil Liberties and from across the political spectrum (specifically from Michael McDowell, Rónán Mullen, and People Before Profit), as well as internationally, from business magnate Elon Musk and political activist Donald Trump Jr. Paul Murphy of People Before Profit said the bill created a &quot;thought crime&quot; by its criminalisation of possessing material prepared for circulation where circulation would incite hatred. Pauline O&#x27;Reilly, a Green Party senator said that the existing legislation was &quot;not effective&quot; and outdated, adding that the Gardaí saw a rise of 30% in hate crime in Ireland.&quot;

Data published by the Gardaí showed a 29% increase in hate crimes and hate-related incidents from 448 in 2021 to 582 in 2022. The Gardaí recognise that &quot;despite improvements, hate crime and hate related incidents are still under-reported&quot;.

====Italy====
Italian criminal law, at Section 3 of Law No. 205/1993, the so-called &quot;Legge Mancino&quot; (Mancino law), contains a penalty-enhancement provision for all crimes motivated by racial, ethnic, national, or religious bias. Italy is a party to the Convention on Cybercrime, but not the Additional Protocol.

====Kazakhstan====
In Kazakhstan, there are constitutional provisions prohibiting propaganda promoting racial or ethnic superiority.

====Kyrgyzstan====
In Kyrgyzstan, &quot;the Constitution of the State party prohibits any kind of discrimination on grounds of origin, sex, race, nationality, language, faith, political or religious convictions or any other personal or social trait or circumstance, and that the prohibition against racial discrimination is also included in other legislation, such as the Civil, Penal and Labour Codes.&quot;

Article 299 of the Criminal Code defines incitement to national, racist, or religious hatred as a specific offense. This article has been used in political trials of suspected members of the banned organization Hizb-ut-Tahrir.

====Poland====
Article 13 of the Constitution of Poland prohibits organizations &quot;whose programmes or activities sanction racial or national hatred&quot;.

====Russia====
Article 29 of Constitution of the Russian Federation bans incitement to riot for the sake of stirring societal, racial, ethnic, and religious hatred as well as the promotion of the superiority of the same. Article 282 of the Criminal code further includes protections against incitement of hatred (including gender) via various means of communication, instilling criminal penalties including fines and imprisonment. Although a former member of the Council of Europe, Russia is not a party to the Convention on Cybercrime.

====Slovenia====

In 2023, Slovenia introduced a penalty-enhancement provision in its Penal Code. If the victim&#x27;s national, racial, religious or ethnic origin, sex, colour, descent, property, education, social status, political or other opinion, disability, sexual orientation or any other personal circumstance was a factor contributing to the commission of the criminal offence, it shall be taken into account when determining the penalty.

====Spain====
Article 22(4) of the Spanish Penal Code includes a penalty-enhancement provision for crimes motivated by bias against the victim&#x27;s ideology, beliefs, religion, ethnicity, race, nationality, gender, sexual orientation, illness or disability.

On 14 May 2019, the Spanish Attorney General distributed a circular instructing on the interpretation of hate crime law. This new interpretation includes nazis as a collective that can be protected under this law.

Although a member of the Council of Europe, Spain is not a party to the Convention on Cybercrime.

====Sweden====
Article 29 of the Swedish Penal Code includes a penalty-enhancement provision for crimes motivated by bias against the victim&#x27;s race, color, nationality, ethnicity, sexual orientation, religion, or &quot;other similar circumstance&quot; of the victim.

====Ukraine====

The constitution of Ukraine guarantees protection against hate crime:

*Article 10: &quot;In Ukraine, free development, use and protection of Russian and &quot;other languages&quot; of ethnic minorities of Ukraine are guaranteed&quot;.
*Article 11: &quot;The State shall promote the development of the ethnic, cultural, linguistic and religious identity of all indigenous peoples and ethnic minorities of Ukraine&quot;.
*Article 24: &quot;There can be no privileges or restrictions on the grounds of race, color of the skin, political, religious or other beliefs, sex, ethnic or social origin, property status, place of residence, language or other grounds&quot;.

Under the Criminal Codex, crimes committed because of hatred are hate crimes and carry increased punishment in many articles of the criminal law. There are also separate articles on punishment for a hate crime.

Article 161: &quot;Violations of equality of citizens depending on their race, ethnicity, religious beliefs, disability and other grounds: Intentional acts aimed at incitement to ethnic, racial or religious hatred and violence, to demean the ethnic honor and dignity, or to repulse citizens&#x27; feelings due to their religious beliefs, as well as direct or indirect restriction of rights or the establishment of direct or indirect privileges of citizens on the grounds of race, color, political, religious or other beliefs, sex, disability, ethnic or social origin, property status, place of residence, language or other grounds&quot; (maximum criminal sentence of up to 8 years in prison).

Article 300: &quot;Importation, manufacture or distribution of literature and other media promoting a cult of violence and cruelty, racial, ethnic or religious intolerance and discrimination&quot; (maximum criminal sentence of up to 5 years in prison).

====United Kingdom====
For England, Wales, and Scotland, the Sentencing Act 2020 makes racial or religious hostility, or hostility related to disability, sexual orientation, or transgender identity an aggravation in sentencing for crimes in general.

Separately, the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 defines separate offences, with increased sentences, for racially or religiously aggravated assaults, harassment, and a handful of public order offences.

For Northern Ireland, Public Order 1987 (S.I. 1987/463 (N.I. 7)) serves the same purposes. A &quot;racial group&quot; is a group of persons defined by reference to race, colour, nationality (including citizenship) or ethnic or national origins. A &quot;religious group&quot; is a group of persons defined by reference to religious belief or lack of religious belief.

&quot;Hate crime&quot; legislation is distinct from &quot;hate speech&quot; legislation. See Hate speech laws in the United Kingdom.

The Crime Survey for England and Wales (CSEW) reported in 2013 that there were an average of 278,000 hate crimes a year with 40 percent being reported according to a victims survey; police records only identified around 43,000 hate crimes a year. It was reported that police recorded a 57-percent increase in hate crime complaints in the four days following the UK&#x27;s European Union membership referendum; however, a press release from the National Police Chief&#x27;s Council stated that &quot;this should not be read as a national increase in hate crime of 57 percent&quot;.

In 2013, Greater Manchester Police began recording attacks on goths, punks and other alternative culture groups as hate crimes.

On 4 December 2013, Essex Police launched the &#x27;Stop the Hate&#x27; initiative as part of a concerted effort to find new ways to tackle hate crime in Essex. The launch was marked by a conference in Chelmsford, hosted by Chief Constable Stephen Kavanagh, which brought together 220 delegates from a range of partner organizations involved in the field. The theme of the conference was &#x27;Report it to Sort it&#x27; and the emphasis was on encouraging people to tell police if they have been a victim of hate crime, whether it be based on race, religion, sexual orientation, transgender identity or disability.

Crown Prosecution Service guidance issued on 21 August 2017 stated that online hate crimes should be treated as seriously as offences in person.

Perhaps the most high-profile hate crime in modern Britain occurred in Eltham, London, on 24 April 1993, when 18-year-old black student Stephen Lawrence was stabbed to death in an attack by a gang of white youths. Two white teenagers were later charged with the murder, and at least three other suspects were mentioned in the national media, but the charges against them were dropped within three months after the Crown Prosecution Service concluded that there was insufficient evidence to prosecute. However, a change in the law a decade later allowed a suspect to be charged with a crime twice if new evidence emerged after the original charges were dropped or a &quot;not guilty&quot; verdict was delivered in court. Gary Dobson, who had been charged with the murder in the initial 1993 investigation, was found guilty of Stephen Lawrence&#x27;s murder in January 2012 and sentenced to life imprisonment, as was David Norris, who had not been charged in 1993. A third suspect, Luke Knight, had been charged in 1993 but was not charged when the case came to court nearly 20 years later.

In September 2020, the Law Commission proposed that sex or gender be added to the list of protected characteristics.

The United Kingdom is a party to the Convention on Cybercrime, but not the Additional Protocol.

A 2021 investigation by &quot;Newsnight&quot; and &quot;The Law Society Gazette&quot; found that alleged hate crimes in which the victim was a police officer were significantly more likely to result in a successful prosecution. The investigation found that in several areas, crimes against police officers and staff constituted up to half of all hate crimes convictions, despite representing a much smaller proportion of reported incidents.

=====Scotland=====
Under Scottish Common law the courts can take any aggravating factor into account when sentencing someone found guilty of an offence. There is legislation dealing with the offences of incitement of racial hatred, racially aggravated harassment, and prejudice relating to religious beliefs, disability, sexual orientation, and transgender identity. A Scottish Executive working group examined the issue of hate crime and ways of combating crime motivated by social prejudice, reporting in 2004. Its main recommendations were not implemented, but in their manifestos for the 2007 Scottish Parliament election several political parties included commitments to legislate in this area, including the Scottish National Party, which now forms the Scottish Government. The Offences (Aggravation by Prejudice) (Scotland) Bill was introduced on 19 May 2008 by Patrick Harvie MSP, having been prepared with support from the Scottish Government, and was passed unanimously by the parliament on 3 June 2009.

The Hate Crime and Public Order (Scotland) Act 2021 comes into force on 1 April 2024. Its introduction was criticised by the Association of Scottish Police Superintendents saying it feared Police Scotland would be deluged by cases, diverting officers from tackling violent offenders and that the Act threatened to fuel claims of “institutional bias” against the force.

====== Non-crime hate incidents ======
In March 2024, Scottish Conservatives MSP Murdo Fraser threatened Police Scotland with legal action following his criticism of the Scottish Government&#x27;s transgender policy was logged as a &quot;hate incident&quot; after being told that his name appears in police records for expressing his view about the policy even though no crime was committed. Fraser had shared a column written by Susan Dalgety for &quot;The Scotsman&quot;, which claimed the Scottish Government&#x27;s &#x27;non-binary equality action plan&#x27; would lead to children being &quot;damaged by this cult&quot; and commenting &quot;Choosing to identify as &#x27;non-binary&#x27; is as valid as choosing to identify as a cat. I&#x27;m not sure governments should be spending time on action plans for either.&quot;

====Eurasian countries with no hate crime laws====
Albania, Cyprus, San Marino and Turkey have no hate crime laws. Nonetheless, all of these except Turkey are parties to the Convention on Cybercrime and the Additional Protocol.

===North America===

====Canada====
&quot;In Canada the legal definition of a hate crime can be found in sections 318 and 319 of the Criminal Code&quot;.

In 1996, the federal government amended a section of the Criminal Code that pertains to sentencing. Specifically, section 718.2. The section states (with regard to the hate crime):

A vast majority (84 percent) of hate crime perpetrators were &quot;male, with an average age of just under 30. Less than 10 of those accused had criminal records, and less than 5 percent had previous hate crime involvement&quot;. &quot;Only 4 percent of hate crimes were linked to an organized or extremist group&quot;.

As of 2004, Jewish people were the largest ethnic group targeted by hate crimes, followed by black people, Muslims, South Asians, and homosexuals (Silver et al., 2004). More recently, hate crimes targeting Jews accounted for 67% of all hate crimes targeting religions in 2022.

During the Nazi regime in Germany, antisemitism was a cause of hate-related violence in Canada. For example, on 16 August 1933, there was a baseball game in Toronto and one team was made up mostly of Jewish players. At the end of the game, a group of Nazi sympathizers unfolded a Swastika flag and shouted &quot;Heil Hitler.&quot; That event erupted into a brawl that pitted Jews and Italians against Anglo Canadians; the brawl went on for hours.

The first time someone was charged for hate speech over the internet occurred on 27 March 1996. &quot;A Winnipeg teenager was arrested by the police for sending an email to a local political activist that contained the message &quot;Death to homosexuals...it&#x27;s prescribed in the Bible! Better watch out next Gay Pride Week.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, Canada saw a sudden rise in hate crimes based on race, religion, and sexual orientation. Statistics Canada reported there was a 72% increase in hate crimes between 2019 and 2021.

====Mexico====
Alejandro Gertz Manero, Attorney General of Mexico, recommended in August 2020 that all murders involving women be investigated as femicides. An average of 11 women are killed every day.

Murders of LGBTQ individuals are not legally classified as hate crimes in Mexico, although Luis Guzman of the &quot;Cohesión de Diversidades para la Sustentabilidad&quot; (Codise) notes that there is a lot of homophobia in Mexico, particularly in the states of Veracruz, Chihuahua, and Michoacán. Between 2014 and May 2020, there have been 209 such murders registered.

====United States====

Hate crime laws have a long history in the United States. The first hate crime laws were passed after the American Civil War, beginning with the Civil Rights Act of 1871, in order to combat the growing number of racially motivated crimes which were being committed by the Reconstruction era—Ku Klux Klan. The modern era of hate-crime legislation began in 1968 with the passage of federal statute, 18 U.S.C.A. § 249, part of the Civil Rights Act which made it illegal to &quot;by force or by threat of force, injure, intimidate, or interfere with anyone who is engaged in six specified protected activities, by reason of their race, color, religion, or national origin.&quot; However, &quot;The prosecution of such crimes must be certified by the U.S. attorney general.&quot;

The first state hate-crime statute, California&#x27;s Section 190.2, was passed in 1978 and provided penalty enhancements in cases when murders were motivated by prejudice against four &quot;protected status&quot; categories: race, religion, color, and national origin. Washington included ancestry in a statute which was passed in 1981. Alaska included creed and sex in 1982, and later disability, sexual orientation, and ethnicity. In the 1990s some state laws began to include age, marital status, membership in the armed forces, and membership in civil rights organizations.

Until California state legislation included all crimes as possible hate crimes in 1987, criminal acts which could be considered hate crimes in various states included aggravated assault, assault and battery, vandalism, rape, threats and intimidation, arson, trespassing, stalking, and various &quot;lesser&quot; acts.

Defined in the 1999 National Crime Victim Survey, &quot;A hate crime is a criminal offence. In the United States, federal prosecution is possible for hate crimes committed on the basis of a person&#x27;s race, religion, or nation origin when engaging in a federally protected activity.&quot; In 2009, capping a broad-based public campaign lasting more than a decade, President Barack Obama signed into law the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act. The Act added actual or perceived gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, and disability to the federal definition of a hate crime, and dropped the prerequisite that the victim be engaging in a federally protected activity. Led by Shepard&#x27;s parents and a coalition of civil rights groups, with ADL (the Anti-Defamation League), in a lead role, the campaign to pass the Matthew Shepard Act lasted 13 years, in large part because of opposition to including the term &quot;sexual orientation&quot; as one of the bases for deeming a crime to be a hate crime.

ADL also drafted model hate crimes legislation in the 1980s that serves as the template for the legislation that a majority of states have adopted. As of the fall of 2020, 46 of the 50 states and Washington, D.C. have statutes criminalizing various types of hate crimes. Thirty-one states and the District of Columbia have statutes creating a civil cause of action in addition to the criminal penalty for similar acts. Twenty-seven states and the District of Columbia have statutes requiring the state to collect hate crime statistics. In May 2020, the killing of African-American jogger Ahmaud Arbery reinvigorated efforts to adopt a hate-crimes law in Georgia, which was one of a handful of states without a such legislation. Led in great part by the Hate-Free Georgia Coalition, a group of 35 nonprofit groups organized by the Georgia state ADL, the legislation was adopted in June 2020, after 16 years of debate.

According to the FBI Hate Crime Statistics report for 2006, hate crimes increased nearly 8 percent nationwide, with a total of 7,722 incidents and 9,080 offences reported by participating law enforcement agencies. Of the 5,449 crimes against persons, 46 percent were classified as intimidation, and 32 percent as simple assaults. Acts of vandalism or destruction comprised 81 percent of the 3,593 crimes against property.

However, according to the FBI Hate Crime Statistics for 2007, the number of hate crimes decreased to 7,624 incidents reported by participating law enforcement agencies. These incidents included nine murders and two rapes (out of the almost 17,000 murders and 90,000 forcible rapes committed in the U.S. in 2007).

In June 2009, Attorney General Eric Holder said recent killings showed the need for a tougher U.S. hate-crimes law to stop &quot;violence masquerading as political activism.&quot;

Leadership Conference on Civil Rights Education Fund published a report in 2009 revealing that 33 percent of hate-crime offenders were under the age of 18, while 29 percent were between the ages of 18 and 24.

The 2011 hate-crime statistics show 46.9 percent were motivated by race, and 20.8 percent by sexual orientation.

In 2015, the Hate Crimes Statistics report identified 5,818 single-bias incidents involving 6,837 offenses, 7,121 victims, and 5,475 known offenders

In 2017, the FBI released new data showing a 17 percent increase in hate crimes between 2016 and 2017.

In 2018, the Hate Crime Statistics report showed 59.5 percent were motivated by race bias and 16.9 percent by sexual orientation.

Prosecutions of hate crimes have been difficult in the United States. Recently, state governments have attempted to re-investigate and re-try past hate crimes. One notable example was Mississippi&#x27;s decision to retry Byron De La Beckwith in 1990 for the 1963 murder of Medgar Evers, a prominent figure in the NAACP and a leader of the civil rights movement. This was the first time in U.S. history that an unresolved civil rights case was re-opened. De La Beckwith, a member of the Ku Klux Klan, was tried for the murder on two previous occasions, resulting in hung juries. A mixed-race jury found Beckwith guilty of murder, and he was sentenced to life in prison in 1994.

According to a November 2016 report issued by the FBI, hate crimes are on the rise in the United States. The number of hate crimes increased from 5,850 in 2015, to 6,121 hate crime incidents in 2016, an increase of 4.6 percent.

The Khalid Jabara-Heather Heyer National Opposition to Hate, Assault, and Threats to Equality Act (NO HATE), which was first introduced in 2017, was reintroduced in June 2019 to improve hate crime reporting and expand support for victims as a response to anti-LGBTQ, anti-Muslim and antisemitic attacks. The bill would fund state hate-crime hotlines, and support expansion of reporting and training programs in law enforcement agencies.

According to a 2021 study, in the years between 1992 and 2014, white people were the offenders in 74.5 percent of anti-Asian hate crimes, 99 percent of anti-black hate crimes, and 81.1 percent of anti-Hispanic hate crimes.

=====Victims in the United States=====
One of the largest waves of hate crimes in the history of the United States took place during the civil rights movement in the 1950s and 1960s. Violence and threats of violence were common against African Americans, and hundreds of people died due to such acts. Members of this ethnic group faced violence from groups such as the Ku Klux Klan, as well as violence from individuals who were committed to maintaining segregation. At the time, civil rights leaders such as Martin Luther King Jr. and their supporters fought hard for the right of African Americans to vote, as well as for equality in their everyday lives. African Americans have been the target of hate crimes since the Civil War, and the humiliation of this ethnic group was also desired by many anti-black individuals. Other frequently reported bias motivations were bias against a religion, bias against a particular sexual orientation, and bias against a particular ethnicity or national origin. At times, these bias motivations overlapped, because violence can be both anti-gay and anti-black, for example.

Analysts have compared groups in terms of the per capita rate of hate crimes committed against them to allow for differing populations. Overall, the total number of hate crimes committed since the first hate crime bill was passed in 1997 is 86,582.

Among the groups which are mentioned in the Hate Crimes Statistics Act, the largest number of hate crimes are committed against African Americans. During the Civil Rights Movement, some of the most notorious hate crimes included the 1968 assassination of Martin Luther King Jr., the 1964 murders of Charles Moore and Henry Dee, the 1963 16th Street Baptist Church bombing, the 1955 murder of Emmett Till, and the burning of crosses, churches, Jewish synagogues, and other places of worship of minority religions. Such acts began to take place more frequently after the racial integration of many schools and public facilities.

Since then, hate crimes targeting Jews have risen sharply, as in 2023, Antisemitic hate crimes increased by 63% to an all time high of 1,832 incidents in the United States. Furthermore, Jews comprise roughly 2% of the American population, but represent 68% of all religion-based hate crimes in the country.

High-profile murders targeting victims based on their sexual orientation have prompted the passage of hate crimes legislation, notably the cases of Sean W. Kennedy and Matthew Shepard. Kennedy&#x27;s murder was mentioned by Senator Gordon Smith in a speech on the floor of the U.S. Senate while he advocated such legislation. The Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act was signed into law in 2009. It included sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, disably status, and military personnel and their family members. This is the first all-inclusive bill ever passed in the United States, taking 45 years to complete.

Gender-based crimes may also be considered hate crimes. This view would designate rape and domestic violence, as well as non-interpersonal violence against women such as the École Polytechnique massacre in Quebec, as hate crimes.

Following the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, the United States experienced a spike in overall hate crimes against Muslim individuals. In the year before, only 28 events had been recorded of hate crimes against Muslims; in 2001, this number jumped to 481. While the number decreased in the following years, the number of Muslim hate crimes remains higher than pre-2001.

In May 2018, &quot;ProPublica&quot; reviewed police reports for 58 cases of purported anti-heterosexual hate crimes. &quot;ProPublica&quot; found that about half of the cases were anti-LGBT hate crimes that had been miscategorized, and that the rest were motivated by hate towards Jews, blacks or women or that there was no element of a hate crime at all. &quot;ProPublica&quot; did not find any cases of hate crimes spurred by anti-heterosexual bias.

====== Anti-trans hate crime ======

In 2017, shortly after President Donald Trump took office, hate crimes against transgender individuals increased. In June 2020, after the death of several African Americans at the hands of police officers – in particular, George Floyd – triggered protests around the world as part of the Black Lives Matter movement, hate crimes against the black trans community began to increase.

===South America===
====Brazil====
In Brazil, hate crime laws focus on racism, racial injury, and other special bias-motivated crimes such as, for example, murder by death squads and genocide on the grounds of nationality, ethnicity, race or religion. Murder by death squads and genocide are legally classified as &quot;hideous crimes&quot; ( in Portuguese).

The crimes of racism and racial injury, although similar, are enforced slightly differently. Article 140, 3rd paragraph, of the Penal Code establishes a harsher penalty, from a minimum of one year to a maximum of three years, for injuries motivated by &quot;elements referring to race, color, ethnicity, religion, origin, or the condition of being an aged or disabled person&quot;. On the other side, Law 7716/1989 covers &quot;crimes resulting from discrimination or prejudice on the grounds of race, color, ethnicity, religion, or national origin&quot;.

In addition, the Brazilian Constitution defines as a &quot;fundamental goal of the Republic&quot; (Article 3rd, clause IV) &quot;to promote the well-being of all, with no prejudice as to origin, race, sex, color, age, and any other forms of discrimination&quot;.

====Chile====
In 2012, the Anti-discrimination law amended the Criminal Code adding a new aggravating circumstance of criminal responsibility, as follows: &quot;Committing or participating in a crime motivated by ideology, political opinion, religion or beliefs of the victim; nation, race, ethnic or social group; sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, age, affiliation, personal appearance or suffering from illness or disability.&quot;

===Middle East===

Israel is the only country in the Middle East that has hate crime laws. Hate crime, as passed by the Israeli Knesset (Parliament), is defined as crime for reason of race, religion, gender and sexual orientation.

===Oceania===

Australia within February 2025, passed comprehensive and extensive legislation on hate crimes at a federal governmental level.

==Support for and opposition to hate crime laws==

===Support===
Justifications for harsher punishments for hate crimes focus on the notion that hate crimes cause greater individual and societal harm. In a 2014 book, author Marian Duggan asserts that when the core of a person&#x27;s identity is attacked, the degradation and dehumanization is especially severe, and additional emotional and physiological problems are likely to result. Wider society can suffer from the disempowerment of a group of people. Furthermore, it is asserted that the chances for retaliatory crimes are greater when a hate crime has been committed. The riots in Los Angeles, California, that followed the beating of Rodney King, a black motorist, by a group of white police officers are cited as support for this argument. The beating of white truck driver Reginald Denny by black rioters during the same riot is also an example that supports this argument.

In &quot;Wisconsin v. Mitchell,&quot; the U.S. Supreme Court unanimously found that &quot;penalty-enhancement&quot; hate crime statutes do not conflict with free speech rights, because they do not punish an individual for exercising freedom of expression; rather, they allow courts to consider motive when sentencing a criminal for conduct which is not protected by the First Amendment. In the case of &quot;Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire,&quot; the court defined &quot;fighting words&quot; as &quot;those which by their very utterance inflict injury or tend to incite an immediate breach of the peace.&quot;

David Brax argues that critics of hate-crime laws are wrong in claiming that hate crimes punish thoughts or motives; he asserts they do not do this, but instead punish people for choosing these reasons to commit a criminal act. Similarly, Andrew Seidel writes, &quot;Hate crime or bias intimidation crimes are not thoughtcrimes. Most crimes require two things: an act and an intent... If you simply hate someone based on race, sexuality, or creed, that thought is not punishable. Only the thought combined with an illegal action is criminal.&quot;

===Opposition===

The U.S. Supreme Court unanimously found the St. Paul Bias-Motivated Crime Ordinance amounted to viewpoint-based discrimination in conflict with rights of free speech, because it selectively criminalized bias-motivated speech or symbolic speech for disfavored topics while permitting such speech for other topics. Many critics further assert that it conflicts with an even more fundamental right: free thought. The claim is that hate-crime legislation effectively makes certain ideas or beliefs, including religious ones, illegal, in other words, thought crimes. Heidi Hurd argues that hate crimes criminalize certain dispositions yet do not show why hate is a morally worse disposition for a crime than one motivated by jealousy, greed, sadism or vengeance or why hatred and bias are uniquely responsive to criminal sanction compared to other motivations. Hurd argues that whether or not a disposition is worse than another is case sensitive and thus it is difficult to argue that some motivations are categorically worse than others.

In their book &quot;Hate Crimes: Criminal Law and Identity Politics&quot;, James B. Jacobs and Kimberly Potter criticize hate crime legislation for exacerbating conflicts between groups. They assert that by defining crimes as being committed by one group against another, rather than as being committed by individuals against their society, the labeling of crimes as &quot;hate crimes&quot; causes groups to feel persecuted by one another, and that this impression of persecution can incite a backlash and thus lead to an actual increase in crime. Jacobs and Potter also argued that hate crime legislation can end up only covering the victimization of some groups rather than all, which is a form of discrimination itself and that attempts to remedy this by making all identifiable groups covered by hate crime protection thus make hate crimes co-terminus with generic criminal law. The authors also suggest that arguments which attempt to portray hate crimes as worse than normal crimes because they spread fear in a community are unsatisfactory, as normal criminal acts can also spread fear yet only hate crimes are singled out. Indeed, it has been argued that victims have varied reactions to hate crimes, so it is not necessarily true that hate crimes are regarded as more harmful than other crimes. Dan Kahan argues that the &quot;greater harm&quot; argument is conceptually flawed, as it is only because people value their group identities that attacks motivated by an animus against those identities are seen as worse, thus making it the victim and society&#x27;s reaction to the crime rather than the crime itself.

Heidi Hurd argues that hate crime represents an effort by the state to encourage a certain moral character in its citizen and thus represents the view that the instillation of virtue and the elimination of vice are legitimate state goals, which she argues is a contradiction of the principles of liberalism. Hurd also argues that increasing punishment for an offence because the perpetrator was motivated by hate compared to some other motivation means that the justice systems is treating the same crime differently, even though treating like cases alike is a cornerstone of criminal justice.

Some have argued hate crime laws bring the law into disrepute and further divide society, as groups apply to have their critics silenced. American forensic psychologist Karen Franklin said that the term &quot;hate crime&quot; is somewhat misleading since it assumes there is a hateful motivation which is not present in many occasions; in her view, laws to punish people who commit hate crimes may not be the best remedy for preventing them because the threat of future punishment does not usually deter such criminal acts. Some on the political left have been critical of hate crime laws for expanding the criminal justice system and dealing with violence against minority groups through punitive measures. Briana Alongi argues that hate crime legislation is inconsistent, redundant and arbitrarily applied, while also being partially motivated by political opportunism and media bias rather than purely by legal principle.

<text>Hans Christian Andersen ( ; ; 2 April 1805 – 4 August 1875) was a Danish author. Although a prolific writer of plays, travelogues, novels, and poems, he is best remembered for his literary fairy tales.

Andersen&#x27;s fairy tales, consisting of 156 stories across nine volumes, have been translated into more than 125 languages. They have become embedded in Western collective consciousness, accessible to children as well as presenting lessons of virtue and resilience in the face of adversity for mature readers. His most famous fairy tales include &quot;The Emperor&#x27;s New Clothes&quot;, &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot;, &quot;The Nightingale&quot;, &quot;The Steadfast Tin Soldier&quot;, &quot;The Red Shoes&quot;, &quot;The Princess and the Pea&quot;, &quot;The Snow Queen&quot;, &quot;The Ugly Duckling&quot;, &quot;The Little Match Girl&quot;, and &quot;Thumbelina.&quot; Andersen&#x27;s stories have inspired ballets, plays, and animated and live-action films.

==Early life==
Andersen was born in Odense, Denmark, on 2 April 1805. He had a half sister named Karen. Andersen&#x27;s father, also named Hans, considered himself related to nobility (his paternal grandmother had told his father that their family had belonged to a higher social class, but investigations have disproved these stories). Although it has been challenged, speculation suggests that Andersen was an illegitimate son of King Christian VIII. Danish historian Jens Jørgensen supported this idea in his book &quot;H.C. Andersen, en sand myte&quot; [a true myth].

Andersen was baptised on 15 April 1805 in Saint Hans Church in Odense. According to his birth certificate, which was not drafted until November 1823, six godparents were present at the baptism ceremony: Madam Sille Marie Breineberg, Maiden Friederiche Pommer, shoemaker Peder Waltersdorff, journeyman carpenter Anders Jørgensen, hospital porter Nicolas Gomard, and royal hatter Jens Henrichsen Dorch.

Andersen&#x27;s father, who had received an elementary school education, introduced his son to literature, reading him &quot;Arabian Nights&quot;. Andersen&#x27;s mother, Anne Marie Andersdatter, was an illiterate washerwoman. Following her husband&#x27;s death in 1816, she remarried in 1818. Andersen was sent to a local school for poor children where he received a basic education and had to support himself, working as an apprentice to a weaver and, later, to a tailor. At 14, Andersen moved to Copenhagen to seek employment as an actor. Having a good soprano voice, he was accepted into the Royal Danish Theatre, but his voice soon changed. A colleague at the theatre told Andersen that he considered Andersen a poet, and taking the suggestion seriously, Andersen began to focus on writing.

Jonas Collin, director of the Royal Danish Theatre, held great affection for Andersen and sent him to a grammar school in Slagelse, persuading King Frederick VI to pay part of Andersen&#x27;s education. Andersen had by then published his first story, &quot;The Ghost at Palnatoke&#x27;s Grave&quot; (1822). Though not a stellar pupil, Andersen also attended school at Elsinore until 1827.

Andersen later said that his years at this school were the darkest and most bitter years of his life. At one school, Andersen lived at his schoolmaster&#x27;s home. There, Andersen was abused and was told that it was done in order &quot;to improve his character.&quot; Andersen later said that the faculty had discouraged him from writing, which resulted in a depression.

==Career==

===Early work===
A very early fairy tale by Andersen, &quot;The Tallow Candle&quot; (), was discovered in a Danish archive in October 2012. The story, written in the 1820s, is about a candle that does not feel appreciated. It was written while Andersen was still in school and dedicated to one of his benefactors. The story remained in that family&#x27;s possession until it was found among other family papers in a local archive.

In 1829, Andersen enjoyed considerable success with the short story &quot;A Journey on Foot from Holmen&#x27;s Canal to the East Point of Amager.&quot; Its protagonist meets characters ranging from Saint Peter to a talking cat. Andersen followed this success with a theatrical piece, &quot;Love on St. Nicholas Church Tower&quot;, and a short volume of poems. He made little progress in writing and publishing immediately following these poems, but did receive a small travel grant from the king in 1833. This enabled Andersen to set out on the first of many journeys throughout Europe. At Jura, near Le Locle, Switzerland, Andersen wrote the story &quot;Agnete and the Merman.&quot; The same year, he spent an evening in the Italian seaside village of Sestri Levante, which inspired the title of &quot;The Bay of Fables.&quot; Andersen arrived in Rome in October 1834. His travels in Italy were reflected in his first novel, a fictionalized autobiography titled &quot;The Improvisatore&quot; (), published in 1835 to instant acclaim.

===Literary fairy tales===
&quot;Fairy Tales Told for Children. First Collection&quot; (Danish: &quot;Eventyr, fortalt for Børn. Første Samling.&quot;) is a collection of nine fairy tales by Andersen. The tales were published in a series of three installments by C. A. Reitzel in Copenhagen between May 1835 and April 1837. They were Andersen&#x27;s first venture into the fairy tale genre.

The first installment was a volume of sixty-one unbound pages published 8 May 1835 containing &quot;The Tinderbox&quot;, &quot;Little Claus and Big Claus&quot;, &quot;The Princess and the Pea&quot; and &quot;Little Ida&#x27;s Flowers&quot;. The first three tales were based on folktales Andersen had heard in his childhood. The fourth was Andersen&#x27;s creation for Ida Thiele, the daughter of folklorist Just Mathias Thiele, Andersen&#x27;s early benefactor. Reitzel paid Andersen thirty rigsdalers for the manuscript, and the booklet was priced at 24 shillings.

The second booklet was published on 16 December 1835 and contained &quot;The Naughty Boy&quot;, and &quot;The Traveling Companion&quot;, and &quot;Thumbelina.&quot; The lattermost was inspired by &quot;Tom Thumb&quot; and other stories of miniature people. &quot;The Naughty Boy&quot; was based on a poem about Eros from the &quot;Anacreontea&quot;, and &quot;The Traveling Companion&quot; was a ghost story Andersen had experimented with in the year 1830.

The third booklet contained &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot; and &quot;The Emperor&#x27;s New Clothes&quot;, and it was published on 7 April 1837. The former was influenced by Friedrich de la Motte Fouqué&#x27;s &quot;Undine&quot; (1811) and legends about mermaids. This tale established Andersen&#x27;s international reputation. The only other tale in the third booklet was &quot;The Emperor&#x27;s New Clothes&quot;, which was based on a medieval Spanish story with Arab and Jewish origins. On the eve of the third installment&#x27;s publication, Andersen revised the conclusion (in which the Emperor simply walks in procession) to its now-famous finale of a child calling out, &quot;The Emperor is not wearing any clothes!&quot;

Danish reviews of the first two booklets first appeared in 1836 and were not enthusiastic. The critics disliked the chatty, informal style and apparent immorality, since children&#x27;s literature was meant to educate rather than to amuse. The critics discouraged Andersen from pursuing this type of style. Andersen believed that he was working against the critics&#x27; preconceived notions about fairy tales, and he temporarily returned to novel-writing, waiting a full year before publishing his third installment.

The nine tales from the three booklets were published in one volume and sold for seventy-two shillings. A title page, a table of contents, and a preface by Andersen were published in this volume.

In 1868, Horace Scudder, the editor of &quot;Riverside Magazine For Young People&quot;, offered Andersen $500 for 12 new stories. Sixteen of Andersen&#x27;s stories were published in the magazine, and 10 of them appeared there before they were printed in Denmark.

===Travelogues===
In 1851, Andersen published &quot;In Sweden&quot;, a volume of travel sketches. The publication received wide acclaim. A keen traveler, he published several other long travelogues: &quot;Shadow Pictures of a Journey to the Harz, Swiss Saxony, etc. etc. in the Summer of 1831&quot;, &quot;A Poet&#x27;s Bazaar&quot;, &quot;In Spain&quot;, and &quot;A Visit to Portugal in 1866&quot;. (The last one describes his visit with his Portuguese friends Jorge and José O&#x27;Neill, whom Andersen knew in the mid-1820s while he was living in Copenhagen.) In his travelogues, Andersen used contemporary conventions related to travel writing but developed the style to make it his own. Each of Andersen&#x27;s travelogues combines documentary and descriptive accounts of his experiences, adding additional philosophical passages on topics such as authorship, immortality, and fiction in literary travel reports. Some of the travelogues, such as &quot;In Sweden&quot;, contain fairy tales.

In the 1840s, Andersen&#x27;s attention returned to the theatre stage, but with little success. He had better luck with the publication of the &quot;Picture-Book without Pictures&quot; (1840). Andersen started a second series of fairy tales in 1838 and a third series in 1845. At this point, he was celebrated throughout Europe, although Andersen&#x27;s native Denmark still showed some resistance to his pretensions.

Between 1845 and 1864, Andersen lived at Nyhavn 67, Copenhagen, where a memorial plaque is now placed.

Patrons of Andersen&#x27;s writings included the monarchy of Denmark, the House of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg. An unexpected invitation from King Christian IX to the royal palace entrenched Andersen&#x27;s folklore in Danish royalty as well as making its way to the Romanov dynasty when Christian IX&#x27;s daughter Maria Feodorovna married Alexander III of Russia.

==Personal life==

===Meetings with Charles Dickens===
In June 1847, Andersen visited England for the first time, enjoying triumphant social success. The Countess of Blessington invited him to her parties where many intellectuals would meet, and at one such party he met Charles Dickens for the first time. They shook hands and walked to the veranda, which Andersen noted in his diary: &quot;We were on the veranda, and I was so happy to see and speak to England&#x27;s now-living writer whom I do love the most.&quot;

The two authors respected each other&#x27;s work and each other as writers, and had in common their depictions of the underclass, who often led difficult lives affected both by the Industrial Revolution and by abject poverty.

In 1857, Andersen visited England again, primarily to meet Dickens. Andersen extended the planned brief visit to Dickens&#x27; home at Gads Hill Place into a five-week stay, much to the distress of Dickens&#x27; family. After Andersen was told to leave, Dickens gradually stopped all correspondence between them, to Andersen&#x27;s great disappointment and confusion; he had enjoyed the visit and never understood why his letters went unanswered.

It is suspected that Dickens modelled the physical appearance and mannerisms of Uriah Heep from &quot;David Copperfield&quot; after Andersen.

===Romantic relationships===
In Andersen&#x27;s early life, his private journal records his refusal to have sexual relations.

Andersen experienced homosexual attraction; he wrote to Edvard Collin: &quot;I languish for you as for a pretty Calabrian wench ... my sentiments for you are those of a woman. The femininity of my nature and our friendship must remain a mystery.&quot; Collin wrote in his own memoir, &quot;I found myself unable to respond to this love, and this caused the author much suffering.&quot; Andersen&#x27;s infatuation with Karl Alexander, the young hereditary duke of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach, did result in a relationship:

The Hereditary Grand Duke walked arm in arm with me across the courtyard of the castle to my room, kissed me lovingly, asked me always to love him though he was just an ordinary person, asked me to stay with him this winter ... Fell asleep with the melancholy, happy feeling that I was the guest of this strange prince at his castle and loved by him ... It is like a fairy tale. 

There is a sharp division in opinion over Andersen&#x27;s physical fulfillment in the sexual sphere. Jackie Wullschlager&#x27;s biography maintains he was possibly lovers with Danish dancer and Andersen&#x27;s &quot;The Snowman&quot; was inspired by their relationship. Scharff first met Andersen when the latter was in his 50s. Andersen was infatuated and Wullschlager sees his journals as implying that their relationship was sexual. Scharff had various dinners alone with Andersen and gifted a silver toothbrush to Andersen on his 57th birthday. Wullschlager asserts that in the winter of 1861–62, the two men entered an affair that brought Andersen &quot;joy, some kind of sexual fulfillment, and a temporary end to loneliness.&quot; He was not discreet in his conduct with Scharff, and displayed his feelings openly. Onlookers regarded the relationship as improper and ridiculous. In his diary in March 1862, Andersen referred to this time in his life as his &quot;erotic period.&quot; On 13 November 1863, Andersen wrote, &quot;Scharff has not visited me in eight days; with him it is over.&quot; He took this calmly and the two thereafter met in overlapping social circles without bitterness, though Andersen attempted to rekindle their relationship many times without success. According to Wullschlager, &quot;Andersen&#x27;s diaries leave no doubt that he was attracted to both sexes; that at times he longed for a physical relationship with a woman and that at other times he was involved in physical liaisons with men.&quot; For example, Wullschlager quotes from Andersen&#x27;s diaries:

&quot;Scharff bounded up to me; threw himself round my neck and kissed me! ... Nervous in the evening&quot; Five days later he received &quot;a visit from Scharff, who was very intimate and nice&quot;. In the following weeks, there was &quot;dinner at Scharff&#x27;s, who was ardent and loving&quot;

The claim that Andersen entertained &quot;physical liaisons&quot; with men has been contested by Klara Bom and Anya Aarenstrup from the H. C. Andersen Centre of University of Southern Denmark. They state:

it is correct to point to the very ambivalent (and also very traumatic) elements in Andersen&#x27;s emotional life concerning the sexual sphere, but it is decidedly just as wrong to describe him as homosexual and maintain that he had physical relationships with men. He did not. Indeed, that would have been entirely contrary to his moral and religious ideas, aspects that are quite outside the field of vision of Wullschlager and her like.

Wullschlager, in fact, argued that, &quot;because&quot; of moral and religious ideas of his time, Andersen could not be open about his homosexual relationships.

Andersen also fell in love with unattainable women, and many interpret references to them in his stories. At one point, Andersen wrote in his diary: &quot;Almighty God, thee only have I; thou steerest my fate, I must give myself up to thee! Give me a livelihood! Give me a bride! My blood wants love, as my heart does!&quot; A girl named Riborg Voigt was the unrequited love of Andersen&#x27;s youth. A small pouch containing a long letter from Voigt was found on Andersen&#x27;s chest when he died, several decades after Andersen first fell in love with her. Other disappointments in love included Sophie Ørsted, the daughter of the physicist Hans Christian Ørsted; and Louise Collin, the youngest daughter of his benefactor Jonas Collin. One of Andersen&#x27;s stories, &quot;The Nightingale&quot;, was written as an expression of his passion for Jenny Lind and was the inspiration for her nickname, the &quot;Swedish Nightingale.&quot; Andersen was shy around women and had extreme difficulty proposing to Lind. When Lind was boarding a train to go to an opera concert, Andersen gave Lind a letter of proposal. Her feelings towards him were not the same; she saw Andersen as a brother, writing to him in 1844: &quot;farewell ... God bless and protect my brother is the sincere wish of his affectionate sister, Jenny.&quot; It is suggested that Andersen expressed his disappointment by portraying Lind as the eponymous antihero of &quot;The Snow Queen.&quot;

==Death==
In early 1872, at the age of 67, Andersen fell out of his bed and was severely hurt; Andersen never fully recovered from the resultant injuries. Soon afterward, he started to show signs of liver cancer.

Andersen died on 4 August 1875 at the age of 70 in a country house called &quot;Rolighed&quot; (literally: calmness) near Copenhagen, the home of his close friends, the banker Moritz G. Melchior and his wife. Shortly before his death, Andersen consulted a composer about the music for his funeral, saying: &quot;Most of the people who will walk after me will be children, so make the beat keep time with little steps.&quot;

Andersen&#x27;s body was interred in the Assistens Kirkegård in the Nørrebro area of Copenhagen, in the Collin family plot. In 1914, the headstone was moved to another cemetery (today known as &quot;&quot;&quot;Frederiksbergs ældre kirkegaard&quot;), where younger Collin family members were buried. For a period, his, Edvard Collin&#x27;s, and Henriette Collin&#x27;s graves were unmarked. A second stone has been erected, marking Andersen&#x27;s grave, now without any mention of the Collin couple, but all three still share the same plot.

At the time of his death, Andersen was internationally revered, and the Danish government paid him an annual stipend for being a &quot;national treasure.&quot;

<text>The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark, often shortened to Hamlet (), is a tragedy written by William Shakespeare sometime between 1599 and 1601. It is Shakespeare&#x27;s longest play. Set in Denmark, the play depicts Prince Hamlet and his attempts to exact revenge against his uncle, Claudius, who has murdered Hamlet&#x27;s father in order to seize his throne and marry Hamlet&#x27;s mother. &quot;Hamlet&quot; is considered among the &quot;most powerful and influential tragedies in the English language&quot;, with a story capable of &quot;seemingly endless retelling and adaptation by others&quot;. It is widely considered one of the greatest plays of all time. Three different early versions of the play are extant: the First Quarto (Q1, 1603); the Second Quarto (Q2, 1604); and the First Folio (F1, 1623). Each version includes lines and passages missing from the others.

Many works have been pointed to as possible sources for Shakespeare&#x27;s play, from ancient Greek tragedies to Elizabethan dramas. The editors of the Arden Shakespeare question the idea of &quot;source hunting&quot;, pointing out that it presupposes that authors always require ideas from other works for their own, and suggests that no author can have an original idea or be an originator. When Shakespeare wrote, there were many stories about sons avenging the murder of their fathers, and many about clever avenging sons pretending to be foolish in order to outsmart their foes. This would include the story of the ancient Roman, Lucius Junius Brutus, which Shakespeare apparently knew, as well as the story of Amleth, which was preserved in Latin by 13th-century chronicler Saxo Grammaticus in his &quot;Gesta Danorum&quot;, and printed in Paris in 1514. The Amleth story was subsequently adapted and then published in French in 1570 by the 16th-century scholar François de Belleforest. It has a number of plot elements and major characters in common with Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Hamlet&quot;, and lacks others that are found in Shakespeare. Belleforest&#x27;s story was first published in English in 1608, after &quot;Hamlet&quot; had been written, though it is possible that Shakespeare had encountered it in the French-language version.

==Plot==
===Act I===
Prince Hamlet of Denmark is the son of the recently deceased King Hamlet, and nephew of King Claudius, his father&#x27;s brother and successor. Claudius hastily married King Hamlet&#x27;s widow, Gertrude, Hamlet&#x27;s mother, and took the throne for himself. Denmark has a long-standing feud with neighbouring Norway, in which King Hamlet slew King Fortinbras of Norway in a battle some years ago. Although Denmark defeated Norway and the Norwegian throne fell to King Fortinbras&#x27;s infirm brother, Denmark fears that an invasion led by the dead Norwegian king&#x27;s son, Prince Fortinbras, is imminent.

On a cold night on the ramparts of Elsinore, the Danish royal castle, the sentries Bernardo and Marcellus discuss a ghost resembling the late King Hamlet which they have recently seen, and bring Prince Hamlet&#x27;s friend Horatio as a witness. After the ghost appears again, the three vow to tell Prince Hamlet what they have witnessed.

The court gathers the next day, and King Claudius and Queen Gertrude discuss affairs of state with their elderly adviser Polonius. Claudius grants permission for Polonius&#x27;s son Laertes to return to school in France, and he sends envoys to inform the King of Norway about Fortinbras. Claudius also questions Hamlet regarding his continuing to grieve for his father, and forbids him to return to his university in Wittenberg. After the court exits, Hamlet despairs of his father&#x27;s death and his mother&#x27;s hasty remarriage. Learning of the ghost from Horatio, Hamlet resolves to see it himself.
As Polonius&#x27;s son Laertes prepares to depart for France, Polonius offers him advice that culminates in the maxim &quot;to thine own self be true.&quot; Polonius&#x27;s daughter, Ophelia, admits her interest in Hamlet, but Laertes warns her against seeking the prince&#x27;s attention, and Polonius orders her to reject his advances. That night on the rampart, the ghost appears to Hamlet, tells the prince that he was murdered by Claudius (by pouring poison into his ear as he slept), and demands that Hamlet avenge the murder. Hamlet agrees, and the ghost vanishes. The prince confides to Horatio and the sentries that from now on he plans to &quot;put an antic disposition on&quot;, or act as though he has gone mad. Hamlet forces them to swear to keep his plans for revenge secret; however, he remains uncertain of the ghost&#x27;s reliability.

===Act II===
Ophelia rushes to her father, telling him that Hamlet arrived at her door the prior night half-undressed and behaving erratically. Polonius blames love for Hamlet&#x27;s madness and resolves to inform Claudius and Gertrude. As he enters to do so, the king and queen are welcoming Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, two student acquaintances of Hamlet, to Elsinore. The royal couple has requested that the two students investigate the cause of Hamlet&#x27;s mood and behaviour. Additional news requires that Polonius wait to be heard: messengers from Norway inform Claudius that the king of Norway has rebuked Prince Fortinbras for attempting to re-fight his father&#x27;s battles. The forces that Fortinbras had conscripted to march against Denmark will instead be sent against Poland, though they will pass through Danish territory to get there.

Polonius tells Claudius and Gertrude his theory regarding Hamlet&#x27;s behaviour, and then speaks to Hamlet in a hall of the castle to try to learn more. Hamlet feigns madness and subtly insults Polonius all the while. When Rosencrantz and Guildenstern arrive, Hamlet greets his &quot;friends&quot; warmly but quickly discerns that they are there to spy on him for Claudius. Hamlet admits that he is upset at his situation but refuses to give the true reason, instead remarking &quot;What a piece of work is a man&quot;. Rosencrantz and Guildenstern tell Hamlet that they have brought along a troupe of actors that they met while travelling to Elsinore. Hamlet, after welcoming the actors and dismissing his friends-turned-spies, asks them to deliver a soliloquy about the death of King Priam, as witnessed by Queen Hecuba, at the climax of the Trojan War. Hamlet then asks the actors to stage &quot;The Murder of Gonzago&quot;, a play featuring a death in the style of his father&#x27;s murder. Hamlet intends to study Claudius&#x27;s reaction to the play, and thereby determine the truth of the ghost&#x27;s story of Claudius&#x27;s guilt.

===Act III===
Polonius forces Ophelia to return Hamlet&#x27;s love letters to the prince while he and Claudius secretly watch in order to evaluate Hamlet&#x27;s reaction. Hamlet is walking alone in the hall as the King and Polonius await Ophelia&#x27;s entrance. Hamlet muses on thoughts of life versus death. When Ophelia enters and tries to return Hamlet&#x27;s things, Hamlet accuses her of immodesty and cries &quot;get thee to a nunnery&quot;, though it is unclear whether this, too, is a show of madness or genuine distress. His reaction convinces Claudius that Hamlet is not mad for love. Shortly thereafter, the court assembles to watch the play Hamlet has commissioned. After seeing the Player King murdered by his rival pouring poison in his ear, Claudius abruptly rises and runs from the room; for Hamlet, this is proof of his uncle&#x27;s guilt.
Gertrude summons Hamlet to her chamber to demand an explanation. Meanwhile, Claudius talks to himself about the impossibility of repenting, since he still has possession of his ill-gotten goods: his brother&#x27;s crown and wife. He sinks to his knees. Hamlet, on his way to visit his mother, sneaks up behind him but does not kill him, reasoning that killing Claudius while he is praying will send him straight to heaven while his father&#x27;s ghost is stuck in purgatory. In the queen&#x27;s bedchamber, Hamlet and Gertrude fight bitterly. Polonius, spying on the conversation from behind a tapestry, calls for help as Gertrude, believing Hamlet wants to kill her, calls out for help herself.

Hamlet, believing it is Claudius, stabs wildly, killing Polonius, but he pulls aside the curtain and sees his mistake. In a rage, Hamlet brutally insults his mother for her apparent ignorance of Claudius&#x27;s villainy, but the ghost enters and reprimands Hamlet for his inaction and harsh words. Unable to see or hear the ghost herself, Gertrude takes Hamlet&#x27;s conversation with it as further evidence of madness. After begging the queen to stop sleeping with Claudius, Hamlet leaves, dragging Polonius&#x27;s corpse away.

===Act IV===
Hamlet jokes with Claudius about where he has hidden Polonius&#x27;s body, and the king, fearing for his life, sends Rosencrantz and Guildenstern to accompany Hamlet to England with a sealed letter to the English king requesting that Hamlet be executed immediately.

Unhinged by grief at Polonius&#x27;s death, Ophelia wanders Elsinore. Laertes arrives back from France, enraged by his father&#x27;s death and his sister&#x27;s madness. Claudius convinces Laertes that Hamlet is solely responsible, but a letter soon arrives indicating that Hamlet has returned to Denmark, foiling Claudius&#x27;s plan. Claudius switches tactics, proposing a fencing match between Laertes and Hamlet to settle their differences. Laertes will be given a poison-tipped foil, and, if that fails, Claudius will offer Hamlet poisoned wine as a congratulation. Gertrude interrupts to report that Ophelia has drowned, though it is unclear whether it was suicide or an accident caused by her madness.

===Act V===
Horatio has received a letter from Hamlet, explaining that the prince escaped by negotiating with pirates who attempted to attack his England-bound ship, and the friends reunite offstage. Two gravediggers discuss Ophelia&#x27;s apparent suicide while digging her grave. Hamlet arrives with Horatio and banters with one of the gravediggers, who unearths the skull of a jester from Hamlet&#x27;s childhood, Yorick. Hamlet picks up the skull, saying &quot;Alas, poor Yorick&quot; as he contemplates mortality. Ophelia&#x27;s funeral procession approaches, led by Laertes. Hamlet and Horatio initially hide, but when Hamlet realizes that Ophelia is the one being buried, he reveals himself, proclaiming his love for her. Laertes and Hamlet fight by Ophelia&#x27;s graveside, but the brawl is broken up.

Back at Elsinore, Hamlet explains to Horatio that he had discovered Claudius&#x27;s letter among Rosencrantz and Guildenstern&#x27;s belongings and replaced it with a forged copy indicating that his former friends should be killed instead. A foppish courtier, Osric, interrupts the conversation to deliver the fencing challenge to Hamlet from Laertes. Hamlet, despite Horatio&#x27;s pleas, accepts it. Hamlet does well at first, leading the match by two hits to none, and Gertrude raises a toast to him using the poisoned glass of wine Claudius had set aside for Hamlet. Claudius tries to stop her but is too late: she drinks, and Laertes realizes the plot will be revealed. Laertes slashes Hamlet with his poisoned blade. In the ensuing scuffle, they switch weapons, and Hamlet wounds Laertes with his own poisoned sword. Gertrude collapses and, claiming she has been poisoned, dies. In his dying moments, Laertes reconciles with Hamlet and reveals Claudius&#x27;s plan. Hamlet rushes at Claudius and kills him. As the poison takes effect, Hamlet, hearing that Fortinbras is marching through the area, names the Norwegian prince as his successor. Horatio, distraught at the thought of being the last survivor and living whilst Hamlet does not, says he will commit suicide by drinking the dregs of Gertrude&#x27;s poisoned wine, but Hamlet begs him to live on and tell his story. Hamlet dies in Horatio&#x27;s arms, proclaiming &quot;the rest is silence&quot;. Fortinbras, who was ostensibly marching towards Poland with his army, arrives at the palace, along with an English ambassador bringing news of Rosencrantz and Guildenstern&#x27;s deaths. Horatio promises to recount the full story of what happened, and Fortinbras, seeing the entire Danish royal family dead, takes the crown for himself and orders a military funeral to honour Hamlet.

==Sources==

&quot;Hamlet&quot;-like legends are so widely found (for example in Italy, Spain, Scandinavia, Byzantium, and Arabia) that the core &quot;hero-as-fool&quot; theme is possibly Indo-European in origin. Several ancient written precursors to &quot;Hamlet&quot; can be identified. The first is the anonymous Scandinavian &quot;Saga of Hrolf Kraki&quot;. In this, the murdered king has two sons—Hroar and Helgi—who spend most of the story in disguise, under false names, rather than feigning madness, in a sequence of events that differs from Shakespeare&#x27;s. The second is the Roman legend of Brutus, recorded in two separate Latin works. Its hero, Lucius (&quot;shining, light&quot;), changes his name and persona to Brutus (&quot;dull, stupid&quot;), playing the role of a fool to avoid the fate of his father and brothers, and eventually slaying his family&#x27;s killer, King Tarquinius. A 17th-century Nordic scholar, Torfaeus, compared the Icelandic hero Amlóði (Amlodi) and the hero Prince Ambales (from the &quot;Ambales Saga&quot;) to Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Hamlet&quot;. Similarities include the prince&#x27;s feigned madness, his accidental killing of the king&#x27;s counsellor in his mother&#x27;s bedroom, and the eventual slaying of his uncle.

Many of the earlier legendary elements are interwoven in the 13th-century &quot;Life of Amleth&quot; () by Saxo Grammaticus, part of &quot;Gesta Danorum&quot;. Written in Latin, it reflects classical Roman concepts of virtue and heroism, and was widely available in Shakespeare&#x27;s day. Significant parallels include the prince feigning madness, his mother&#x27;s hasty marriage to the usurper, the prince killing a hidden spy, and the prince substituting the execution of two retainers for his own. A reasonably faithful version of Saxo&#x27;s story was translated into French in 1570 by François de Belleforest, in his &quot;Histoires tragiques&quot;. Belleforest embellished Saxo&#x27;s text substantially, almost doubling its length, and introduced the hero&#x27;s melancholy.

According to one theory, Shakespeare&#x27;s main source may be an earlier play—now lost—known today as the &quot;Ur-Hamlet&quot;. Possibly written by Thomas Kyd or by Shakespeare, the &quot;Ur-Hamlet&quot; would have existed by 1589, and would have incorporated a ghost. Shakespeare&#x27;s company, the Chamberlain&#x27;s Men, may have purchased that play and performed a version for some time, which Shakespeare reworked. However, no copy of the &quot;Ur-Hamlet&quot; has survived, and it is impossible to compare its language and style with the known works of any of its putative authors. In 1936 Andrew Cairncross suggested that, until more becomes known, it may be assumed that Shakespeare wrote the &quot;Ur-Hamlet&quot;. Eric Sams lists reasons for supporting Shakespeare&#x27;s authorship. Harold Jenkins considers that there are no grounds for thinking that the &quot;Ur-Hamlet&quot; is an early work by Shakespeare, which he then rewrote. Professor Terri Bourus in 2016, one of three general editors of the New Oxford Shakespeare, in her paper &quot;Enter Shakespeare&#x27;s Young Hamlet, 1589&quot; suggests that Shakespeare was &quot;interested in sixteenth-century French literature, from the very beginning of his career&quot; and therefore &quot;did not need Thomas Kyd to pre-digest Belleforest&#x27;s histoire of Amleth and spoon-feed it to him&quot;. She considers that the hypothesized &quot;Ur-Hamlet&quot; is Shakespeare&#x27;s Q1 text, and that this derived directly from Belleforest&#x27;s French version.

The precise combination of Shakespeare&#x27;s use of the &quot;Ur-Hamlet&quot;, Belleforest, Saxo, or Kyd&#x27;s &quot;The Spanish Tragedy&quot; as sources for &quot;Hamlet&quot; is not known. However, elements of Belleforest&#x27;s version which are not in Saxo&#x27;s story do appear in Shakespeare&#x27;s play.

Most scholars reject the idea that &quot;Hamlet&quot; is in any way connected with Shakespeare&#x27;s only son, Hamnet Shakespeare, who died in 1596 at age eleven. Conventional wisdom holds that &quot;Hamlet&quot; is strongly connected to legend, and the name Hamnet was quite popular at the time. However, Stephen Greenblatt has argued that the coincidence of the names and Shakespeare&#x27;s grief for the loss of his son may lie at the heart of the tragedy. He notes that the name of Hamnet Sadler, the Stratford neighbour after whom Hamnet was named, was often written as Hamlet Sadler and that, in the loose orthography of the time, the names were virtually interchangeable.

Scholars have often speculated that &quot;Hamlet&quot;″s Polonius might have been inspired by William Cecil (Lord Burghley)—Lord High Treasurer and chief counsellor to Queen Elizabeth I. E. K. Chambers suggested Polonius&#x27;s advice to Laertes may have echoed Burghley&#x27;s to his son Robert Cecil. John Dover Wilson thought it almost certain that the figure of Polonius caricatured Burghley. A. L. Rowse speculated that Polonius&#x27;s tedious verbosity might have resembled Burghley&#x27;s. Lilian Winstanley thought the name Corambis (in the First Quarto) did suggest Cecil and Burghley. Harold Jenkins considers the idea of Polonius as a caricature of Burghley to be conjecture, perhaps based on the similar role they each played at court, and perhaps also based on the similarity between Burghley addressing his &quot;Ten Precepts&quot; to his son, and Polonius offering &quot;precepts&quot; to his son, Laertes. Jenkins suggests that any personal satire may be found in the name &quot;Polonius&quot;, which might point to a Polish or Polonian connection. G. R. Hibbard hypothesised that differences in names (Corambis/Polonius:Montano/Raynoldo) between the First Quarto and other editions might reflect a desire not to offend scholars at Oxford University. (Robert Pullen, was the founder of Oxford University, and John Rainolds, was the President of Corpus Christi College.)

==Date==

&quot;Any dating of &quot;Hamlet&quot; must be tentative&quot;, states the &quot;New Cambridge&quot; editor, Phillip Edwards. MacCary suggests 1599 or 1600; James Shapiro offers late 1600 or early 1601; Wells and Taylor suggest that the play was written in 1600 and revised later; the New Cambridge editor settles on mid-1601; the New Swan Shakespeare Advanced Series editor agrees with 1601; Thompson and Taylor, tentatively (&quot;according to whether one is the more persuaded by Jenkins or by Honigmann&quot;) suggest a &quot;terminus ad quem&quot; of either Spring 1601 or sometime in 1600.

The earliest date estimate relies on &quot;Hamlet&quot;″s frequent allusions to Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Julius Caesar&quot;, itself dated to mid-1599. The latest date estimate is based on an entry, of 26 July 1602, in the Register of the Stationers&#x27; Company, indicating that &quot;Hamlet&quot; was &quot;latelie Acted by the Lo: Chamberleyne his servantes&quot;.

In 1598, Francis Meres published his &quot;Palladis Tamia&quot;, a survey of English literature from Chaucer to its present day, within which twelve of Shakespeare&#x27;s plays are named. &quot;Hamlet&quot; is not among them, suggesting that it had not yet been written. As &quot;Hamlet&quot; was very popular, Bernard Lott, the series editor of &quot;New Swan&quot;, believes it &quot;unlikely that he [Meres] would have overlooked ... so significant a piece&quot;.

The phrase &quot;little eyases&quot; in the First Folio (F1) may allude to the Children of the Chapel, whose popularity in London forced the Globe company into provincial touring. This became known as the War of the Theatres, and supports a 1601 dating. Katherine Duncan-Jones accepts a 1600–01 attribution for the date &quot;Hamlet&quot; was written, but notes that the Lord Chamberlain&#x27;s Men, playing &quot;Hamlet&quot; in the 3000-capacity Globe, were unlikely to be put to any disadvantage by an audience of &quot;barely one hundred&quot; for the Children of the chapel&#x27;s equivalent play, &quot;Antonio&#x27;s Revenge&quot;; she believes that Shakespeare, confident in the superiority of his own work, was making a playful and charitable allusion to his friend John Marston&#x27;s very similar piece.

A contemporary of Shakespeare&#x27;s, Gabriel Harvey, wrote a marginal note in his copy of the 1598 edition of Chaucer&#x27;s works, which some scholars use as dating evidence. Harvey&#x27;s note says that &quot;the wiser sort&quot; enjoy &quot;Hamlet&quot;, and implies that the Earl of Essex—executed in February 1601 for rebellion—was still alive. Other scholars consider this inconclusive. Edwards, for example, concludes that the &quot;sense of time is so confused in Harvey&#x27;s note that it is really of little use in trying to date &quot;. This is because the same note also refers to Spenser and Watson as if they were still alive (&quot;our flourishing metricians&quot;), but also mentions &quot;Owen&#x27;s new epigrams&quot;, published in 1607.

==Texts==

Three early editions of the text, each different, have survived, making attempts to establish a single &quot;authentic&quot; text problematic.
* First Quarto (Q1): In 1603 the booksellers Nicholas Ling and John Trundell published, and Valentine Simmes printed, the so-called &quot;bad&quot; first quarto, under the name &quot;The Tragicall Historie of Hamlet Prince of Denmarke&quot;. Q1 contains just over half of the text of the later second quarto.
* Second Quarto (Q2): In 1604 Nicholas Ling published, and James Roberts printed, the second quarto, under the same name as the first. Some copies are dated 1605, which may indicate a second impression; consequently, Q2 is often dated &quot;1604/5&quot;. Q2 is the longest early edition, although it omits about 77 lines found in F1 (most likely to avoid offending James I&#x27;s queen, Anne of Denmark).
* First Folio (F1): In 1623 Edward Blount and William and Isaac Jaggard published &quot;The Tragedie of Hamlet, Prince of Denmarke&quot; in the First Folio, the first edition of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Complete Works&quot;.

This list does not include three additional early texts, John Smethwick&#x27;s Q3, Q4, and Q5 (1611–37), which are regarded as reprints of Q2 with some alterations.

Early editors of Shakespeare&#x27;s works, beginning with Nicholas Rowe (1709) and Lewis Theobald (1733), combined material from the two earliest sources of &quot;Hamlet&quot; available at the time, Q2 and F1. Each text contains material that the other lacks, with many minor differences in wording: scarcely 200 lines are identical in the two. Editors have combined them in an effort to create one &quot;inclusive&quot; text that reflects an imagined &quot;ideal&quot; of Shakespeare&#x27;s original. Theobald&#x27;s version became standard for a long time, and his &quot;full text&quot; approach continues to influence editorial practice to the present day. Some contemporary scholarship, however, discounts this approach, instead considering &quot;an authentic &quot;Hamlet&quot; an unrealisable ideal. ... there are &quot;texts&quot; of this play but no &quot;text&quot;&quot;. The 2006 publication by Arden Shakespeare of different &quot;Hamlet&quot; texts in different volumes is perhaps evidence of this shifting focus and emphasis. Other editors have continued to argue the need for well-edited editions taking material from all versions of the play. Colin Burrow has argued that most of us should read a text that is made up by conflating all three versions ... it&#x27;s about as likely that Shakespeare wrote: &quot;To be or not to be, ay, there&#x27;s the point&quot; [in Q1], as that he wrote the works of Francis Bacon. I suspect most people just won&#x27;t want to read a three-text play ... [multi-text editions are] a version of the play that is out of touch with the needs of a wider public.

Traditionally, editors of Shakespeare&#x27;s plays have divided them into five acts. None of the early texts of &quot;Hamlet&quot;, however, were arranged this way, and the play&#x27;s division into acts and scenes derives from a 1676 quarto. Modern editors generally follow this traditional division but consider it unsatisfactory; for example, after Hamlet drags Polonius&#x27;s body out of Gertrude&#x27;s bedchamber, there is an act-break after which the action appears to continue uninterrupted.

Q1 was discovered in 1823. Only two copies are extant. According to Jenkins, &quot;The unauthorized nature of this quarto is matched by the corruption of its text.&quot; Yet Q1 has value: it contains stage directions (such as Ophelia entering with a lute and her hair down) that reveal actual stage practices in a way that Q2 and F1 do not; it contains an entire scene (usually labelled 4.6) that does not appear in either Q2 or F1; and it is useful for comparison with the later editions. The major deficiency of Q1 is in the language: particularly noticeable in the opening lines of the famous &quot;To be, or not to be&quot; soliloquy: &quot;To be, or not to be, aye there&#x27;s the point. / To die, to sleep, is that all? Aye all: / No, to sleep, to dream, aye marry there it goes.&quot; However, the scene order is more coherent, without the problems of Q2 and F1 of Hamlet seeming to resolve something in one scene and enter the next drowning in indecision. New Cambridge editor Kathleen Irace has noted that &quot;Q1&#x27;s more linear plot design is certainly easier [...] to follow [...] but the simplicity of the Q1 plot arrangement eliminates the alternating plot elements that correspond to Hamlet&#x27;s shifts in mood.&quot;

Q1 is considerably shorter than Q2 or F1 and may be a memorial reconstruction of the play as Shakespeare&#x27;s company performed it, by an actor who played a minor role (most likely Marcellus). Scholars disagree whether the reconstruction was pirated or authorised. It is suggested by Irace that Q1 is an abridged version intended especially for travelling productions, thus the question of length may be considered as separate from issues of poor textual quality. Editing Q1 thus poses problems in whether or not to &quot;correct&quot; differences from Q2 and F. Irace, in her introduction to Q1, wrote that &quot;I have avoided as many other alterations as possible, because the differences...are especially intriguing...I have recorded a selection of Q2/F readings in the collation.&quot; The idea that Q1 is not riddled with error but is instead eminently fit for the stage has led to at least 28 different Q1 productions since 1881. Other productions have used the Q2 and Folio texts, but used Q1&#x27;s running order, in particular moving the &quot;to be or not to be&quot; soliloquy earlier. Developing this, some editors such as Jonathan Bate have argued that Q2 may represent &quot;a &#x27;reading&#x27; text as opposed to a &#x27;performance&#x27; one&quot; of &quot;Hamlet&quot;: an edition containing all of Shakespeare&#x27;s material for the play for the pleasure of readers, so not representing the play as it would have been staged.

==Analysis and criticism==
===Critical history===
From the early 17th century, the play was famous for its ghost and vivid dramatisation of melancholy and insanity, leading to a procession of mad courtiers and ladies in Jacobean and Caroline drama. Though it remained popular with mass audiences, late 17th-century Restoration critics saw &quot;Hamlet&quot; as primitive and disapproved of its lack of unity and decorum. This view changed drastically in the 18th century, when critics regarded Hamlet as a hero—a pure, brilliant young man thrust into unfortunate circumstances.

By the mid-18th century, however, the advent of Gothic literature brought psychological and mystical readings, returning madness and the ghost to the forefront. Not until the late 18th century did critics and performers begin to view Hamlet as confusing and inconsistent. Before then, he was either mad, or not; either a hero, or not; with no in-betweens. These developments represented a fundamental change in literary criticism, which came to focus more on character and less on plot. In the 18th century, one negative French review of Hamlet would be widely discussed for centuries, in particular in publications throughout the 19th and 20th century. In 1768, Voltaire wrote a negative review of &quot;Hamlet&quot;, stating that &quot;it is vulgar and barbarous drama, which would not be tolerated by the vilest populace of France or Italy... one would imagine this piece to be a work of a drunken savage&quot;.

By the 19th century, Romantic critics valued &quot;Hamlet&quot; for its internal, individual conflict reflecting the strong contemporary emphasis on internal struggles and inner character in general. Then too, critics started to focus on Hamlet&#x27;s delay as a character trait, rather than a plot device. This focus on character and internal struggle continued into the 20th century, when criticism branched in several directions, discussed in context and interpretation below.

===Dramatic structure===
Modern editors have divided the play into five acts, and each act into scenes. The First Folio marks the first two acts only. The quartos do not have such divisions. The division into five acts follows Seneca, who in his plays, regularized the way ancient Greek tragedies contain five episodes, which are separated by four choral odes. In &quot;Hamlet&quot; the development of the plot or the action are determined by the unfolding of Hamlet&#x27;s character. The soliloquies do not interrupt the plot, instead they are highlights of each block of action. The plot is the developing revelation of Hamlet&#x27;s view of what is &quot;rotten in the state of Denmark.&quot; The action of the play is driven forward in dialogue; but in the soliloquies time and action stop, the meaning of action is questioned, fog of illusion is broached, and truths are exposed.

The contrast between appearance and reality is a significant theme. Hamlet is presented with an image, and then interprets its deeper or darker meaning. Examples begin with Hamlet questioning the reality of the ghost. It continues with Hamlet&#x27;s taking on an &quot;antic disposition&quot; in order to appear mad, though he is not. The contrast (appearance and reality) is also expressed in several &quot;spying scenes&quot;: Act two begins with Polonius sending Reynaldo to spy on his son, Laertes. Claudius and Polonius spy on Ophelia as she meets with Hamlet. In act two, Claudius asks Rosencrantz and Guildenstern to spy on Hamlet. Similarly, the play-within-a-play is used by Hamlet to reveal his step-father&#x27;s hidden nature.

There is no subplot, but the play presents the affairs of the courtier Polonius, his daughter, Ophelia, and his son, Laertes—who variously deal with madness, love and the death of a father in ways that contrast with Hamlet&#x27;s. The graveyard scene eases tension prior to the catastrophe, and, as Hamlet holds the skull, it is shown that Hamlet no longer fears damnation in the afterlife, and accepts that there is a &quot;divinity that shapes our ends&quot;.

Hamlet&#x27;s enquiring mind has been open to all kinds of ideas, but in act five he has decided on a plan, and in a dialogue with Horatio he seems to answer his two earlier soliloquies on suicide: &quot;We defy augury. There is special providence in the fall of a sparrow. If it be now, &#x27;tis not to come; if it be not to come, it will be now; if it be not now, yet it will come. The readiness is all. Since no man, of aught he leaves, knows aught, what is&#x27;t to leave betimes.&quot;

===Length===
The First Quarto (1603) text of &quot;Hamlet&quot; contains 15,983 words, the Second Quarto (1604) contains 28,628 words, and the First Folio (1623) contains 27,602 words. Counting the number of lines varies between editions, partly because prose sections in the play may be formatted with varied lengths. Editions of &quot;Hamlet&quot; that are created by conflating the texts of the Second Quarto and the Folio are said to have approximately 3,900 lines; the number of lines varies between those editions based on formatting the prose sections, counting methods, and how the editors have joined the texts together. &quot;Hamlet&quot; is by far the longest play that Shakespeare wrote, and one of the longest plays in the Western canon. It might require more than four hours to stage; a typical Elizabethan play would need two to three hours. It is speculated that because of the considerable length of Q2 and F1, there was an expectation that those texts would be abridged for performance, or that Q2 and F1 may have been aimed at a reading audience.

That Q1 is so much shorter than Q2 has spurred speculation that Q1 is an early draft, or perhaps an adaptation, a bootleg copy, or a stage adaptation. On the title page of Q2, its text is described as &quot;newly imprinted and enlarged to almost as much again as it was.&quot; That is probably a comparison to Q1.

===Language===
Much of &quot;Hamlet&quot;″s language is courtly: elaborate, witty discourse, as recommended by Baldassare Castiglione&#x27;s 1528 etiquette guide, &quot;The Courtier&quot;. This work specifically advises royal retainers to amuse their masters with inventive language. Osric and Polonius, especially, seem to respect this injunction. Claudius&#x27;s speech is rich with rhetorical figures—as is Hamlet&#x27;s and, at times, Ophelia&#x27;s—while the language of Horatio, the guards, and the gravediggers is simpler. Claudius&#x27;s high status is reinforced by using the royal first person plural (&quot;we&quot; or &quot;us&quot;), and anaphora mixed with metaphor to resonate with Greek political speeches.

Of all the characters, Hamlet has the greatest rhetorical skill. He uses highly developed metaphors, stichomythia, and in nine memorable words deploys both anaphora and asyndeton: &quot;to die: to sleep— / To sleep, perchance to dream&quot;. In contrast, when occasion demands, he is precise and straightforward, as when he explains his inward emotion to his mother: &quot;But I have that within which passes show, / These but the trappings and the suits of woe&quot;. At times, he relies heavily on puns to express his true thoughts while simultaneously concealing them. Pauline Kiernan argues that Shakespeare changed English drama forever in &quot;Hamlet&quot; because he &quot;showed how a character&#x27;s language can often be saying several things at once, and contradictory meanings at that, to reflect fragmented thoughts and disturbed feelings&quot;. She gives the example of Hamlet&#x27;s advice to Ophelia, &quot;get thee to a nunnery&quot;, which, she claims, is simultaneously a reference to a place of chastity and a slang term for a brothel, reflecting Hamlet&#x27;s confused feelings about female sexuality. However Harold Jenkins does not agree, having studied the few examples that are used to support that idea, and finds that there is no support for the assumption that &quot;nunnery&quot; was used that way in slang, or that Hamlet intended such a meaning. The context of the scene suggests that a nunnery would not be a brothel, but instead a place of renunciation and a &quot;sanctuary from marriage and from the world&#x27;s contamination&quot;. Thompson and Taylor consider the brothel idea incorrect considering that &quot;Hamlet is trying to deter Ophelia from &quot;breeding&quot;&quot;.

Hamlet&#x27;s first words in the play are a pun; when Claudius addresses him as &quot;my cousin Hamlet, and my son&quot;, Hamlet says as an aside: &quot;A little more than kin, and less than kind.&quot;

An unusual rhetorical device, hendiadys, appears in several places in the play. Examples are found in Ophelia&#x27;s speech at the end of the nunnery scene: &quot;Th&quot;&#x27;expectancy and rose&quot; of the fair state&quot; and &quot;And I, of ladies most &quot;deject and wretched&quot;&quot;. Many scholars have found it odd that Shakespeare would, seemingly arbitrarily, use this rhetorical form throughout the play. One explanation may be that &quot;Hamlet&quot; was written later in Shakespeare&#x27;s life, when he was adept at matching rhetorical devices to characters and the plot. Linguist George T. Wright suggests that hendiadys had been used deliberately to heighten the play&#x27;s sense of duality and dislocation.

Hamlet&#x27;s soliloquies have captured the attention of scholars. Hamlet interrupts himself, vocalising either disgust or agreement with himself and embellishing his own words. He has difficulty expressing himself directly and instead blunts the thrust of his thought with wordplay. It is not until late in the play, after his experience with the pirates, that Hamlet is able to articulate his feelings freely.

==Context and interpretation==

===Religious===
Written at a time of religious upheaval and in the wake of the English Reformation, the play is alternately Catholic (or piously medieval) and Protestant (or consciously modern). The ghost describes himself as being in purgatory and as dying without last rites. This and Ophelia&#x27;s burial ceremony, which is characteristically Catholic, make up most of the play&#x27;s Catholic connections. Some scholars have observed that revenge tragedies come from Catholic countries such as Italy and Spain, where the revenge tragedies present contradictions of motives, since according to Catholic doctrine the duty to God and family precedes civil justice.

Much of the play&#x27;s Protestant tones derive from its setting in Denmark—both then and now a predominantly Protestant country, though it is unclear whether the fictional Denmark of the play is intended to portray this implicit fact. Dialogue refers explicitly to the German city of Wittenberg where Hamlet, Horatio, and Rosencrantz and Guildenstern attend university, implying where the Protestant reformer Martin Luther nailed the &quot;Ninety-five Theses&quot; to the church door in 1517.

===Philosophical===
Hamlet is often perceived as a philosophical character, expounding ideas that are now described as relativist, existentialist, and sceptical. For example, he expresses a subjectivistic idea when he says to Rosencrantz: &quot;there is nothing either good or bad, but thinking makes it so&quot;. The idea that nothing is real except in the mind of the individual finds its roots in the Greek Sophists, who argued that since nothing can be perceived except through the senses—and since all individuals sense, and therefore perceive things differently—there is no absolute truth, but rather only relative truth. The clearest alleged instance of existentialism is in the &quot;to be, or not to be&quot; speech, where Hamlet is thought by some to use &quot;being&quot; to allude to life and action, and &quot;not being&quot; to death and inaction.

&quot;Hamlet&quot; reflects the contemporary scepticism promoted by the French Renaissance humanist Michel de Montaigne. Prior to Montaigne&#x27;s time, humanists such as Pico della Mirandola had argued that man was God&#x27;s greatest creation, made in God&#x27;s image and able to choose his own nature, but this view was subsequently challenged in Montaigne&#x27;s &quot;Essais&quot; of 1580. Hamlet&#x27;s &quot;What a piece of work is a man&quot; seems to echo many of Montaigne&#x27;s ideas, and many scholars have discussed whether Shakespeare drew directly from Montaigne or whether both men were simply reacting similarly to the spirit of the times.

===Psychoanalytic===
====Sigmund Freud====
Sigmund Freud’s thoughts regarding &quot;Hamlet&quot; were first published in his book &quot;The Interpretation of Dreams&quot; (1899), as a footnote to a discussion of Sophocles’ tragedy, &quot;Oedipus Rex,&quot; all of which is part of his consideration of the causes of neurosis. Freud does not offer over-all interpretations of the plays, but uses the two tragedies to illustrate and corroborate his psychological theories, which are based on his treatments of his patients and on his studies. Productions of &quot;Hamlet&quot; have used Freud&#x27;s ideas to support their own interpretations. In &quot;The Interpretation of Dreams&quot;, Freud says that according to his experience &quot;parents play a leading part in the infantile psychology of all persons who subsequently become psychoneurotics,&quot; and that &quot;falling in love with one parent and hating the other&quot; is a common impulse in early childhood, and is important source material of &quot;subsequent neurosis&quot;. He says that &quot;in their amorous or hostile attitude toward their parents&quot; neurotics reveal something that occurs with less intensity &quot;in the minds of the majority of children&quot;. Freud considered that Sophocles’ tragedy, &quot;Oedipus Rex&quot;, with its story that involves crimes of parricide and incest, &quot;has furnished us with legendary matter which corroborates&quot; these ideas, and that the &quot;profound and universal validity of the old legends&quot; is understandable only by recognizing the validity of these theories of &quot;infantile psychology&quot;.

Freud explores the reason &quot;&quot;Oedipus Rex&quot; is capable of moving a modern reader or playgoer no less powerfully than it moved the contemporary Greeks&quot;. He suggests that &quot;It may be that we were all destined to direct our first sexual impulses toward our mothers, and our first impulses of hatred and violence toward our fathers.&quot; Freud suggests that we &quot;recoil from the person for whom this primitive wish of our childhood has been fulfilled with all the force of the repression which these wishes have undergone in our minds since childhood.&quot;

These ideas, which became a cornerstone of Freud&#x27;s psychological theories, he named the &quot;Oedipus complex&quot;, and, at one point, he considered calling it the &quot;Hamlet complex&quot;. Freud considered that &quot;Hamlet&quot; &quot;is rooted in the same soil as &quot;Oedipus Rex&quot;.&quot; But the difference in the &quot;psychic life&quot; of the two civilizations that produced each play, and the progress made over time of &quot;repression in the emotional life of humanity&quot; can be seen in the way the same material is handled by the two playwrights: In &quot;Oedipus Rex&quot; incest and murder are brought into the light as might occur in a dream, but in &quot;Hamlet&quot; these impulses &quot;remain repressed&quot; and we learn of their existence through Hamlet&#x27;s inhibitions to act out the revenge, while he is shown to be capable of acting decisively and boldly in other contexts. Freud asserts, &quot;The play is based on Hamlet’s hesitation in accomplishing the task of revenge assigned to him; the text does not give the cause or the motive of this.&quot; The conflict is &quot;deeply hidden&quot;.

Hamlet is able to perform any kind of action except taking revenge on the man who murdered his father and has taken his father&#x27;s place with his mother—Claudius has led Hamlet to realize the repressed desires of his own childhood. The loathing which was supposed to drive him to revenge is replaced by &quot;self-reproach, by conscientious scruples&quot; which tell him &quot;he himself is no better than the murderer whom he is required to punish&quot;. Freud suggests that Hamlet&#x27;s sexual aversion expressed in his &quot;nunnery&quot; conversation with Ophelia supports the idea that Hamlet is &quot;an hysterical subject&quot;.

Freud suggests that the character Hamlet goes through an experience that has three characteristics, which he numbered: 1) &quot;the hero is not psychopathic, but becomes so&quot; during the course of the play. 2) &quot;the repressed desire is one of those that are similarly repressed in all of us.&quot; It is a repression that &quot;belongs to an early stage of our individual development&quot;. The audience identifies with the character of Hamlet, because &quot;we are victims of the same conflict.&quot; 3) It is the nature of theatre that &quot;the struggle of the repressed impulse to become conscious&quot; occurs in both the hero onstage and the spectator, when they are in the grip of their emotions, &quot;in the manner seen in psychoanalytic treatment&quot;.

Freud points out that &quot;Hamlet&quot; is an exception in that psychopathic characters are usually ineffective in stage plays; they &quot;become as useless for the stage as they are for life itself&quot;, because they do not inspire insight or empathy, unless the audience is familiar with the character&#x27;s inner conflict. Freud says, &quot;It is thus the task of the dramatist to transport us into the same illness.&quot;

John Barrymore&#x27;s long-running 1922 performance in New York, directed by Thomas Hopkins, &quot;broke new ground in its Freudian approach to character&quot;, in keeping with the post-World War I rebellion against everything Victorian. He had a &quot;blunter intention&quot; than presenting the genteel, sweet prince of 19th-century tradition, imbuing his character with virility and lust.

Beginning in 1910, with the publication of &quot;The Œdipus-Complex as an Explanation of Hamlet&#x27;s Mystery: A Study in Motive&quot; Ernest Jones—a psychoanalyst and Freud&#x27;s biographer—developed Freud&#x27;s ideas into a series of essays that culminated in his book &quot;Hamlet and Oedipus&quot; (1949). Influenced by Jones&#x27;s psychoanalytic approach, several productions have portrayed the &quot;closet scene&quot;, where Hamlet confronts his mother in her private quarters, in a sexual light. In this reading, Hamlet is disgusted by his mother&#x27;s &quot;incestuous&quot; relationship with Claudius while simultaneously fearful of killing him, as this would clear Hamlet&#x27;s path to his mother&#x27;s bed. Ophelia&#x27;s madness after her father&#x27;s death may also be read through the Freudian lens: as a reaction to the death of her hoped-for lover, her father. Ophelia is overwhelmed by having her unfulfilled love for him so abruptly terminated and drifts into the oblivion of insanity. In 1937, Tyrone Guthrie directed Laurence Olivier in a Jones-inspired &quot;Hamlet&quot; at The Old Vic. Olivier later used some of these same ideas in his 1948 film version of the play.

In the &quot;Bloom&#x27;s Shakespeare Through the Ages&quot; volume on Hamlet, editors Bloom and Foster express a conviction that the intentions of Shakespeare in portraying the character of Hamlet in the play exceeded the capacity of the Freudian Oedipus complex to completely encompass the extent of characteristics depicted in Hamlet throughout the tragedy: &quot;For once, Freud regressed in attempting to fasten the Oedipus Complex upon Hamlet: it will not stick, and merely showed that Freud did better than T.S. Eliot, who preferred &quot;Coriolanus&quot; to &quot;Hamlet&quot;, or so he said. Who can believe Eliot, when he exposes his own Hamlet Complex by declaring the play to be an aesthetic failure?&quot; The book also notes James Joyce&#x27;s interpretation, stating that he &quot;did far better in the Library Scene of &quot;Ulysses&quot;, where Stephen marvellously credits Shakespeare, in this play, with universal fatherhood while accurately implying that Hamlet is fatherless, thus opening a pragmatic gap between Shakespeare and Hamlet.&quot;

Joshua Rothman has written in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; that &quot;we tell the story wrong when we say that Freud used the idea of the Oedipus complex to understand &quot;Hamlet&quot;&quot;. Rothman suggests that &quot;it was the other way around: &quot;Hamlet&quot; helped Freud understand, and perhaps even invent, psychoanalysis&quot;. He concludes, &quot;The Oedipus complex is a misnomer. It should be called the &#x27;Hamlet complex&#x27;.&quot;

====Jacques Lacan====
In the 1950s, the French psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan analyzed &quot;Hamlet&quot; to illustrate some of his concepts. His structuralist theories about &quot;Hamlet&quot; were first presented in a series of seminars given in Paris and later published in &quot;Desire and the Interpretation of Desire in &quot;Hamlet&quot;&quot;. Lacan postulated that the human psyche is determined by structures of language and that the linguistic structures of &quot;Hamlet&quot; shed light on human desire. His point of departure is Freud&#x27;s Oedipal theories, and the central theme of mourning that runs through &quot;Hamlet&quot;. In Lacan&#x27;s analysis, Hamlet unconsciously assumes the role of &quot;phallus&quot;—the cause of his inaction—and is increasingly distanced from reality &quot;by mourning, fantasy, narcissism and psychosis&quot;, which create holes (or lack) in the real, imaginary, and symbolic aspects of his psyche. Lacan&#x27;s theories influenced some subsequent literary criticism of &quot;Hamlet&quot; because of his alternative vision of the play and his use of semantics to explore the play&#x27;s psychological landscape.

===Feminist===

In the 20th century, feminist critics opened up new approaches to Gertrude and Ophelia. New historicist and cultural materialist critics examined the play in its historical context, attempting to piece together its original cultural environment. They focused on the gender system of early modern England, pointing to the common trinity of &quot;maid, wife, or widow&quot;, with &quot;whores&quot; outside of that stereotype. In this analysis, the essence of &quot;Hamlet&quot; is the central character&#x27;s changed perception of his mother as a whore because of her failure to remain faithful to Old Hamlet. In consequence, Hamlet loses his faith in all women, treating Ophelia as if she too were a whore and dishonest with Hamlet.
Carolyn Heilbrun&#x27;s 1957 essay &quot;The Character of Hamlet&#x27;s Mother&quot; defends Gertrude, arguing that the text never hints that Gertrude knew of Claudius poisoning King Hamlet. This analysis has been praised by many feminist critics, combating what is, by Heilbrun&#x27;s argument, centuries&#x27; worth of misinterpretation. By this account, Gertrude&#x27;s worst crime is of pragmatically marrying her brother-in-law in order to avoid a power vacuum. This is borne out by the fact that King Hamlet&#x27;s ghost tells Hamlet to leave Gertrude out of Hamlet&#x27;s revenge, to leave her to heaven, an arbitrary mercy to grant to a conspirator to murder.

Ophelia has also been defended by feminist critics, most notably Elaine Showalter. Ophelia is surrounded by powerful men: her father, brother, and Hamlet. All three disappear: Laertes leaves, Hamlet abandons her, and Polonius dies. Conventional theories had argued that without these three powerful men making decisions for her, Ophelia is driven into madness. Feminist theorists argue that she goes mad with guilt because, when Hamlet kills her father, he has fulfilled her sexual desire to have Hamlet kill her father so they can be together. Showalter points out that Ophelia has become the symbol of the distraught and hysterical woman in modern culture.

==Influence==
&quot;Hamlet&quot; is one of the most quoted works in the English language, and is often included on lists of the world&#x27;s greatest literature. As such, it reverberates through the writing of later centuries. Academic Laurie Osborne identifies the direct influence of &quot;Hamlet&quot; in numerous modern narratives, and divides them into four main categories: fictional accounts of the play&#x27;s composition, simplifications of the story for young readers, stories expanding the role of one or more characters, and narratives featuring performances of the play.

English poet John Milton was an early admirer of Shakespeare and took evident inspiration from his work. As John Kerrigan discusses, Milton originally considered writing his epic poem &quot;Paradise Lost&quot; (1667) as a tragedy. While Milton did not ultimately go that route, the poem still shows distinct echoes of Shakespearean revenge tragedy, and of &quot;Hamlet&quot; in particular. As scholar Christopher N. Warren argues, &quot;Paradise Lost&quot;″s Satan &quot;undergoes a transformation in the poem from a Hamlet-like avenger into a Claudius-like usurper,&quot; a plot device that supports Milton&#x27;s larger Republican internationalist project. The poem also reworks theatrical language from &quot;Hamlet&quot;, especially around the idea of &quot;putting on&quot; certain dispositions, as when Hamlet puts on &quot;an antic disposition,&quot; similarly to the Son in &quot;Paradise Lost&quot; who &quot;can put on / [God&#x27;s] terrors.&quot;

Henry Fielding&#x27;s &quot;Tom Jones&quot;, published about 1749, describes a visit to &quot;Hamlet&quot; by Tom Jones and Mr Partridge, with similarities to the &quot;play within a play&quot;. In contrast, Goethe&#x27;s Bildungsroman &quot;Wilhelm Meister&#x27;s Apprenticeship&quot;, written between 1776 and 1796, not only has a production of &quot;Hamlet&quot; at its core but also creates parallels between the ghost and Wilhelm Meister&#x27;s dead father. In the early 1850s, in &quot;Pierre&quot;, Herman Melville focuses on a Hamlet-like character&#x27;s long development as a writer. Ten years later, Dickens&#x27;s &quot;Great Expectations&quot; contains many &quot;Hamlet&quot;-like plot elements: it is driven by revenge-motivated actions, contains ghost-like characters (Abel Magwitch and Miss Havisham), and focuses on the hero&#x27;s guilt. Academic Alexander Welsh notes that &quot;Great Expectations&quot; is an &quot;autobiographical novel&quot; and &quot;anticipates psychoanalytic readings of &quot;Hamlet&quot; itself&quot;. About the same time, George Eliot&#x27;s &quot;The Mill on the Floss&quot; was published, introducing Maggie Tulliver &quot;who is explicitly compared with Hamlet&quot; though &quot;with a reputation for sanity&quot;.

In the 1920s, James Joyce managed &quot;a more upbeat version&quot; of &quot;Hamlet&quot;—stripped of obsession and revenge—in &quot;Ulysses&quot;, though its main parallels are with Homer&#x27;s &quot;Odyssey&quot;. In the 1990s, two novelists were explicitly influenced by &quot;Hamlet&quot;. In Angela Carter&#x27;s &quot;Wise Children&quot;, &quot;To be or not to be&quot; is reworked as a song and dance routine, and Iris Murdoch&#x27;s &quot;The Black Prince&quot; has Oedipal themes and murder intertwined with a love affair between a &quot;Hamlet&quot;-obsessed writer, Bradley Pearson, and the daughter of his rival. In the late 20th century, David Foster Wallace&#x27;s novel &quot;Infinite Jest&quot; draws heavily from &quot;Hamlet&quot; and takes its title from the play&#x27;s text.

There is the story of the woman who read &quot;Hamlet&quot; for the first time and said, &quot;I don&#x27;t see why people admire that play so. It is nothing but a bunch of quotations strung together.&quot;
— Isaac Asimov, &quot;Asimov&#x27;s Guide to Shakespeare&quot;, p. vii, Avenal Books, 1970
==Performance history==

===Shakespeare&#x27;s day to the Interregnum===
Shakespeare almost certainly wrote the role of Hamlet for Richard Burbage. He was the chief tragedian of the Lord Chamberlain&#x27;s Men, with a capacious memory for lines and a wide emotional range. Judging by the number of reprints, &quot;Hamlet&quot; appears to have been Shakespeare&#x27;s fourth most popular play during his lifetime—only &quot;Henry IV Part 1&quot;, &quot;Richard III&quot; and &quot;Pericles&quot; eclipsed it. Shakespeare provides no clear indication of when his play is set; however, as Elizabethan actors performed at the Globe in contemporary dress on minimal sets, this would not have affected the staging.

Firm evidence for specific early performances of the play is scant. It is sometimes argued that the crew of the ship &quot;Red Dragon&quot;, anchored off Sierra Leone, performed &quot;Hamlet&quot; in September 1607; however, this claim is based on a 19th-century insert of a &#x27;lost&#x27; passage into a period document, and is today widely regarded as a hoax, likely to have been perpetrated by John Payne Collier. More credible is that the play toured in Germany within five years of Shakespeare&#x27;s death, and that it was performed before James I in 1619 and Charles I in 1637. Oxford editor George Hibbard argues that, since the contemporary literature contains many allusions and references to &quot;Hamlet&quot; (only Falstaff is mentioned more, from Shakespeare), the play was surely performed with a frequency that the historical record misses.

All theatres were closed down by the Puritan government during the Interregnum. Even during this time, however, playlets known as &quot;drolls&quot; were often performed illegally, including one called &quot;The Grave-Makers&quot; based on act 5, scene 1 of &quot;Hamlet&quot;.

===Restoration and 18th century===

The play was revived early in the Restoration. When the existing stock of pre-civil war plays was divided between the two newly created patent theatre companies, &quot;Hamlet&quot; was the only Shakespearean favourite that Sir William Davenant&#x27;s Duke&#x27;s Company secured. It became the first of Shakespeare&#x27;s plays to be presented with movable flats painted with generic scenery behind the proscenium arch of Lincoln&#x27;s Inn Fields Theatre. This new stage convention highlighted the frequency with which Shakespeare shifts dramatic location, encouraging the recurrent criticism of his failure to maintain unity of place. In the title role, Davenant cast Thomas Betterton, who continued to play the Dane until he was 74. David Garrick at Drury Lane produced a version that adapted Shakespeare heavily; he declared: &quot;I had sworn I would not leave the stage till I had rescued that noble play from all the rubbish of the fifth act. I have brought it forth without the grave-digger&#x27;s trick, Osrick, &amp; the fencing match&quot;. The first actor known to have played Hamlet in North America is Lewis Hallam Jr., in the American Company&#x27;s production in Philadelphia in 1759.

John Philip Kemble made his Drury Lane debut as Hamlet in 1783. His performance was said to be 20 minutes longer than anyone else&#x27;s, and his lengthy pauses provoked the suggestion by Richard Brinsley Sheridan that &quot;music should be played between the words&quot;. Sarah Siddons was the first actress known to play Hamlet; many women have since played him as a breeches role, to great acclaim. In 1748, Alexander Sumarokov wrote a Russian adaptation that focused on Prince Hamlet as the embodiment of an opposition to Claudius&#x27;s tyranny—a treatment that would recur in Eastern European versions into the 20th century. In the years following America&#x27;s independence, Thomas Abthorpe Cooper, the young nation&#x27;s leading tragedian, performed &quot;Hamlet&quot; among other plays at the Chestnut Street Theatre in Philadelphia, and at the Park Theatre in New York. Although chided for &quot;acknowledging acquaintances in the audience&quot; and &quot;inadequate memorisation of his lines&quot;, he became a national celebrity.

===19th century===
From around 1810 to 1840, the best-known Shakespearean performances in the United States were tours by leading London actors—including George Frederick Cooke, Junius Brutus Booth, Edmund Kean, William Charles Macready, and Charles Kemble. Of these, Booth remained to make his career in the States, fathering the nation&#x27;s most notorious actor, John Wilkes Booth (who later assassinated Abraham Lincoln), and its most famous Hamlet, Edwin Booth. Edwin Booth&#x27;s &quot;Hamlet&quot; at the Fifth Avenue Theatre in 1875 was described as &quot;... the dark, sad, dreamy, mysterious hero of a poem. [... acted] in an ideal manner, as far removed as possible from the plane of actual life&quot;. Booth played Hamlet for 100 nights in the 1864/5 season at the Winter Garden Theatre, inaugurating the era of long-run Shakespeare in America.

In the United Kingdom, the actor-managers of the Victorian era (including Kean, Samuel Phelps, Macready, and Henry Irving) staged Shakespeare in a grand manner, with elaborate scenery and costumes. The tendency of actor-managers to emphasise the importance of their own central character did not always meet with the critics&#x27; approval. George Bernard Shaw&#x27;s praise for Johnston Forbes-Robertson&#x27;s performance contains a sideswipe at Irving: &quot;The story of the play was perfectly intelligible, and quite took the attention of the audience off the principal actor at moments. What is the Lyceum coming to?&quot;

In London, Edmund Kean was the first Hamlet to abandon the regal finery usually associated with the role in favour of a plain costume, and he is said to have surprised his audience by playing Hamlet as serious and introspective. In stark contrast to earlier opulence, William Poel&#x27;s 1881 production of the Q1 text was an early attempt at reconstructing the Elizabethan theatre&#x27;s austerity; his only backdrop was a set of red curtains. Sarah Bernhardt played the prince in her popular 1899 London production. In contrast to the &quot;effeminate&quot; view of the central character that usually accompanied a female casting, she described her character as &quot;manly and resolute, but nonetheless thoughtful ... [he] thinks before he acts, a trait indicative of great strength and great spiritual power&quot;.

In France, Charles Kemble initiated an enthusiasm for Shakespeare; and leading members of the Romantic movement such as Victor Hugo and Alexandre Dumas saw his 1827 Paris performance of &quot;Hamlet&quot;, particularly admiring the madness of Harriet Smithson&#x27;s Ophelia. In Germany, &quot;Hamlet&quot; had become so assimilated by the mid-19th century that Ferdinand Freiligrath declared that &quot;Germany is Hamlet&quot;. From the 1850s, the Parsi theatre tradition in India transformed &quot;Hamlet&quot; into folk performances, with dozens of songs added.

===20th century===
Apart from some western troupes&#x27; 19th-century visits, the first professional performance of Hamlet in Japan was Otojirō Kawakami&#x27;s 1903 &quot;Shinpa&quot; (&quot;new school theatre&quot;) adaptation. Tsubouchi Shōyō translated &quot;Hamlet&quot; and produced a performance in 1911 that blended &quot;Shingeki&quot; (&quot;new drama&quot;) and &quot;Kabuki&quot; styles. This hybrid-genre reached its peak in Tsuneari Fukuda&#x27;s 1955 &quot;Hamlet&quot;. In 1998, Yukio Ninagawa produced an acclaimed version of &quot;Hamlet&quot; in the style of Nō theatre, which he took to London.

Konstantin Stanislavski and Edward Gordon Craig—two of the 20th century&#x27;s most influential theatre practitioners—collaborated on the Moscow Art Theatre&#x27;s seminal production of 1911–12. While Craig favoured stylised abstraction, Stanislavski, armed with his &#x27;system,&#x27; explored psychological motivation. Craig conceived of the play as a symbolist monodrama, offering a dream-like vision as seen through Hamlet&#x27;s eyes alone. This was most evident in the staging of the first court scene. The most famous aspect of the production is Craig&#x27;s use of large, abstract screens that altered the size and shape of the acting area for each scene, representing the character&#x27;s state of mind spatially or visualising a dramaturgical progression. The production attracted enthusiastic and unprecedented worldwide attention for the theatre and placed it &quot;on the cultural map for Western Europe&quot;.

The first modern dress stagings of &quot;Hamlet&quot; happened in 1925 in London and then New York.  Barry Jackson&#x27;s Birmingham Repertory Theatre opened their production, directed by H.K. Ayliff at the Kingsway Theatre on August 25, 1925. Ivor Brown reported, &quot;Many of the first night audience came to scoff and remained to hold its breath, to marvel and enjoy. . . .Shakespeare&#x27;s victory over time and tailoring was swift and sweeping.&quot; Horace Brisbin Liveright&#x27;s modern dress production opened at the Booth Theater in New York on November 9, 1925, the same night that the London production moved to Birmingham. It was known &quot;more dryly, and perhaps with a touch of something more sinister, as &#x27;the plain-clothes &quot;Hamlet&quot;&#x27;&quot; and did not reach the same level of success.

&quot;Hamlet&quot; is often played with contemporary political overtones. Leopold Jessner&#x27;s 1926 production at the Berlin Staatstheater portrayed Claudius&#x27;s court as a parody of the corrupt and fawning court of Kaiser Wilhelm. In Poland, the number of productions of &quot;Hamlet&quot; has tended to increase at times of political unrest, since its political themes (suspected crimes, coups, surveillance) can be used to comment on a contemporary situation. Similarly, Czech directors have used the play at times of occupation: a 1941 Vinohrady Theatre production &quot;emphasised, with due caution, the helpless situation of an intellectual attempting to endure in a ruthless environment&quot;. In China, performances of Hamlet often have political significance: Gu Wuwei&#x27;s 1916 &quot;The Usurper of State Power&quot;, an amalgam of &quot;Hamlet&quot; and &quot;Macbeth&quot;, was an attack on Yuan Shikai&#x27;s attempt to overthrow the republic. In 1942, Jiao Juyin directed the play in a Confucian temple in Sichuan Province, to which the government had retreated from the advancing Japanese. In the immediate aftermath of the collapse of the protests at Tiananmen Square, Lin Zhaohua staged a 1990 &quot;Hamlet&quot; in which the prince was an ordinary individual tortured by a loss of meaning. In this production, the actors playing Hamlet, Claudius and Polonius exchanged roles at crucial moments in the performance, including the moment of Claudius&#x27;s death, at which point the actor mainly associated with Hamlet fell to the ground.

Notable stagings in London and New York include Barrymore&#x27;s 1925 production at the Haymarket; it influenced subsequent performances by John Gielgud and Laurence Olivier. Gielgud played the central role many times: his 1936 New York production ran for 132 performances, leading to the accolade that he was &quot;the finest interpreter of the role since Barrymore&quot;. Although &quot;posterity has treated Maurice Evans less kindly&quot;, throughout the 1930s and 1940s he was regarded by many as the leading interpreter of Shakespeare in the United States and in the 1938/39 season he presented Broadway&#x27;s first uncut &quot;Hamlet&quot;, running four and a half hours. Evans later performed a highly truncated version of the play that he played for South Pacific war zones during World War II which made the prince a more decisive character. The staging, known as the &quot;G.I. Hamlet&quot;, was produced on Broadway for 131 performances in 1945/46. Olivier&#x27;s 1937 performance at The Old Vic was popular with audiences but not with critics, with James Agate writing in a famous review in &quot;The Sunday Times,&quot; &quot;Mr. Olivier does not speak poetry badly. He does not speak it at all.&quot; In 1937 Tyrone Guthrie directed the play at Elsinore, Denmark, with Laurence Olivier as Hamlet and Vivien Leigh as Ophelia.

In 1963, Olivier directed Peter O&#x27;Toole as Hamlet in the inaugural performance of the newly formed National Theatre; critics found resonance between O&#x27;Toole&#x27;s Hamlet and John Osborne&#x27;s hero, Jimmy Porter, from &quot;Look Back in Anger&quot;.

Richard Burton received his third Tony Award nomination when he played his second Hamlet, his first under John Gielgud&#x27;s direction, in 1964 in a production that holds the record for the longest run of the play in Broadway history (137 performances).
In 1968, Joseph Papp staged at The Public Theater what became known as &quot;&quot;Naked&quot; Hamlet&quot; because the text was stripped down. It starred Martin Sheen as Hamlet, and Sheen delivered the monologues either in Spanish or with a Spanish accent, as Hamlet&#x27;s alter-ego, a Puerto Rican janitor named Ramon.

Other New York portrayals of &quot;Hamlet&quot; of note include that of Ralph Fiennes&#x27;s in 1995 (for which he won the Tony Award for Best Actor)—which ran, from first preview to closing night, a total of one hundred performances. About the Fiennes &quot;Hamlet&quot; Vincent Canby wrote in &quot;The New York Times&quot; that it was &quot;... not one for literary sleuths and Shakespeare scholars. It respects the play, but it doesn&#x27;t provide any new material for arcane debates on what it all means. Instead it&#x27;s an intelligent, beautifully read ...&quot; Stacy Keach played the role with an all-star cast at Joseph Papp&#x27;s Delacorte Theater in the early 1970s, with Colleen Dewhurst&#x27;s Gertrude, James Earl Jones&#x27;s King, Barnard Hughes&#x27;s Polonius, Sam Waterston&#x27;s Laertes and Raul Julia&#x27;s Osric. Sam Waterston later played the role himself at the Delacorte for the New York Shakespeare Festival, and the show transferred to the Vivian Beaumont Theater in 1975 (Stephen Lang played Bernardo and other roles). Stephen Lang&#x27;s &quot;Hamlet&quot; for the Roundabout Theatre Company in 1992 received mixed reviews and ran for sixty-one performances. David Warner played the role with the Royal Shakespeare Theatre in 1965. William Hurt (at Circle Repertory Company off-Broadway, memorably performing &quot;To be, or not to be&quot; while lying on the floor), Jon Voight at Rutgers, and Christopher Walken (fiercely) at Stratford, Connecticut, have all played the role, as has Diane Venora at The Public Theatre. The Internet Broadway Database lists sixty-six productions of &quot;Hamlet&quot;.

Ian Charleson performed Hamlet from 9 October to 13 November 1989, in Richard Eyre&#x27;s production at the Olivier Theatre, replacing Daniel Day-Lewis, who had abandoned the production. Seriously ill from AIDS at the time, Charleson died eight weeks after his last performance. Fellow actor and friend, Sir Ian McKellen, said that Charleson played Hamlet so well it was as if he had rehearsed the role all his life; McKellen called it &quot;the perfect Hamlet&quot;. The performance garnered other major accolades as well, some critics echoing McKellen in calling it the definitive Hamlet performance.

Keanu Reeves performed Hamlet from 12 January to 4 February 1995 at the Royal Manitoba Theatre Centre (Winnipeg, Manitoba). The production garnered positive reviews from worldwide media outlets.

===21st century===
&quot;Hamlet&quot; continues to be staged regularly. Actors performing the lead role have included: Simon Russell Beale, Ben Whishaw, David Tennant, Tom Hiddleston, Angela Winkler, Samuel West, Christopher Eccleston, Maxine Peake, Rory Kinnear, Oscar Isaac, Michael Sheen, Christian Camargo, Paapa Essiedu and Michael Urie.

In May 2009, &quot;Hamlet&quot; opened with Jude Law in the title role at the Donmar Warehouse West End season at Wyndham&#x27;s Theatre. The production officially opened on 3 June and ran through 22 August 2009. A further production with Jude Law ran at Elsinore Castle in Denmark from 25 to 30 August 2009, and then moved to Broadway, and ran for 12 weeks at the Broadhurst Theatre in New York.

In October 2011, a production starring Michael Sheen opened at the Young Vic, in which the play was set inside a psychiatric hospital.

In 2013, American actor Paul Giamatti played the title role of &quot;Hamlet&quot; in modern dress, at the Yale Repertory Theatre, at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut.

The Globe Theatre of London initiated a project in 2014 to perform &quot;Hamlet&quot; in every country in the world in the space of two years. Titled &quot;Globe to Globe Hamlet&quot;, it began its tour on 23 April 2014, the 450th anniversary of Shakespeare&#x27;s birth, and performed in 197 countries.

Benedict Cumberbatch played the role for a 12-week run in a production at the Barbican Theatre, opening on 25 August 2015. It was called the &quot;most in-demand theatre production of all time&quot; and sold out in seven hours after tickets went on sale 11 August 2014, more than a year before the play opened.

A 2017 Almeida Theatre production, directed by Robert Icke and starring Andrew Scott, was transferred that same year to the West End&#x27;s Harold Pinter Theatre.

Tom Hiddleston played the role for a three-week run at Vanbrugh Theatre that opened on 1 September 2017 and was directed by Kenneth Branagh.

In 2018, The Globe Theatre&#x27;s newly instated artistic director Michelle Terry played the role in a production notable for its gender-blind casting.

A production by Bristol Old Vic starring Billy Howle in title role, Niamh Cusack as Gertrude, Mirren Mack as Ophelia opened on 13 October 2022.

===Film and TV performances===

An early film version of &quot;Hamlet&quot; is Sarah Bernhardt&#x27;s five-minute film of the fencing scene, which was produced in 1900. The film was an early attempt at combining sound and film; music and words were recorded on phonograph records, to be played along with the film. Silent versions were released in 1907, 1908, 1910, 1913, 1917, and 1920. In the 1921 film &quot;Hamlet&quot;, Danish actress Asta Nielsen played the role of Hamlet as a woman who spends her life disguised as a man.

Laurence Olivier&#x27;s 1948 moody black-and-white &quot;Hamlet&quot; won Best Picture and Best Actor Academy Awards and is , the only Shakespeare film to have done so. His interpretation stressed the Oedipal overtones of the play and cast 28-year-old Eileen Herlie as Hamlet&#x27;s mother opposite himself at 41 as Hamlet.

In 1953, actor Jack Manning performed the play in 15-minute segments over two weeks in the short-lived late night DuMont series &quot;Monodrama Theater&quot;. &quot;New York Times&quot; TV critic Jack Gould praised Manning&#x27;s performance as Hamlet.

The 1964 Soviet film &quot;Hamlet&quot; () is based on a translation by Boris Pasternak and directed by Grigori Kozintsev, with a score by Dmitri Shostakovich. Innokenty Smoktunovsky was cast in the role of Hamlet.

John Gielgud directed Richard Burton in a Broadway production at the Lunt-Fontanne Theatre in 1964–65, the longest-running &quot;Hamlet&quot; in the U.S. to date. A live film of the production was produced using &quot;Electronovision&quot;, a method of recording a live performance with multiple video cameras and converting the image to film. Eileen Herlie repeated her role from Olivier&#x27;s film version as the Queen, and the voice of Gielgud was heard as the ghost. The Gielgud/Burton production was also recorded complete and released on LP by Columbia Masterworks.

The first &quot;Hamlet&quot; in color was a 1969 film directed by Tony Richardson with Nicol Williamson as Hamlet and Marianne Faithfull as Ophelia.

In 1990 Franco Zeffirelli, whose Shakespeare films have been described as &quot;sensual rather than cerebral&quot;, cast Mel Gibson—then famous for the &quot;Mad Max&quot; and &quot;Lethal Weapon&quot; movies—in the title role of his 1990 version; Glenn Close—then famous as the psychotic &quot;other woman&quot; in &quot;Fatal Attraction&quot;—played Gertrude, and Paul Scofield played Hamlet&#x27;s father.

Kenneth Branagh adapted, directed, and starred in a 1996 film version of &quot;Hamlet&quot; that contained material from the First Folio and the Second Quarto. Branagh&#x27;s &quot;Hamlet&quot; runs for just over four hours. Branagh set the film with late 19th-century costuming and furnishings, a production in many ways reminiscent of a Russian novel of the time, and Blenheim Palace, built in the early 18th century, became Elsinore Castle in the external scenes. The film is structured as an epic and makes frequent use of flashbacks to highlight elements not made explicit in the play: Hamlet&#x27;s sexual relationship with Kate Winslet&#x27;s Ophelia, for example, or his childhood affection for Yorick (played by Ken Dodd). This version was also the first unabridged theatrical film adaptation of the play, and runs four hours long.

In 2000, Michael Almereyda&#x27;s &quot;Hamlet&quot; set the story in contemporary Manhattan, with Ethan Hawke playing Hamlet as a film student. Claudius (played by Kyle MacLachlan) became the CEO of &quot;Denmark Corporation&quot;, having taken over the company by killing his brother.

The 2014 Bollywood film &quot;Haider&quot; is an adaptation set in modern Kashmir.

==Derivative works==

This section is limited to derivative works written for the stage.

Tom Stoppard&#x27;s 1966 play &quot;Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead&quot; retells many of the events of the story from the point of view of the characters Rosencrantz and Guildenstern and gives them a backstory of their own. Several times since 1995, the American Shakespeare Center has mounted repertories that included both &quot;Hamlet&quot; and &quot;Rosencrantz and Guildenstern&quot;, with the same actors performing the same roles in each.

W. S. Gilbert wrote a short comic play titled &quot;Rosencrantz and Guildenstern&quot;, in which Hamlet&#x27;s play is presented as a tragedy written by Claudius in his youth of which he is greatly embarrassed. Through the chaos triggered by Hamlet&#x27;s staging of it, Guildenstern helps Rosencrantz vie with Hamlet to make Ophelia his bride.

Lee Blessing&#x27;s &quot;Fortinbras&quot; is a comical sequel to &quot;Hamlet&quot; in which all the deceased characters come back as ghosts. &quot;The New York Times&quot; said it is &quot;scarcely more than an extended comedy sketch, lacking the portent and linguistic complexity of Tom Stoppard&#x27;s &quot;Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead&quot;. &quot;Fortinbras&quot; operates on a far less ambitious plane, but it is a ripping yarn and offers Keith Reddin a role in which he can commit comic mayhem&quot;.

Caridad Svich&#x27;s &quot;12 Ophelias (a play with broken songs)&quot; includes elements of the story of &quot;Hamlet&quot; but focuses on Ophelia. In Svich&#x27;s play, Ophelia is resurrected and rises from a pool of water, after her death in &quot;Hamlet&quot;. The play is a series of scenes and songs, and was first staged at a public swimming pool in Brooklyn.

David Davalos&#x27;s &quot;Wittenberg&quot; is a &quot;tragical-comical-historical&quot; prequel to &quot;Hamlet&quot; that depicts the Danish prince as a student at Wittenberg University (now known as the University of Halle-Wittenberg), where he is torn between the conflicting teachings of his mentors John Faustus and Martin Luther. &quot;The New York Times&quot; reviewed the play, saying, &quot;Mr. Davalos has molded a daft campus comedy out of this unlikely convergence&quot;, and &quot;Nytheatre.com&quot;″s review said the playwright &quot;has imagined a fascinating alternate reality, and quite possibly, given the fictional Hamlet a back story that will inform the role for the future.&quot;

&quot;Mad Boy Chronicle&quot; by Canadian playwright Michael O&#x27;Brien is a dark comedy loosely based on &quot;Hamlet&quot;, set in Viking Denmark in 999 AD.

<text>The High German languages (, i.e. &quot;High German dialects&quot;), or simply High German ( ) – not to be confused with Standard High German which is commonly also called &quot;High German&quot; – comprise the varieties of German spoken south of the Benrath and Uerdingen isoglosses in central and southern Germany, Austria, Liechtenstein, Switzerland, Luxembourg, and eastern Belgium, as well as in neighbouring portions of France (Alsace and northern Lorraine), Italy (South Tyrol), the Czech Republic (Bohemia), and Poland (Upper Silesia). They are also spoken in diasporas in Romania, Russia, Canada, the United States, Brazil, Argentina, Mexico, Chile, and Namibia.

High German is marked by the High German consonant shift, separating it from Low German (Low Saxon) and Low Franconian (including Dutch) within the continental West Germanic dialect continuum. &quot;Low&quot; and &quot;high&quot; refer to the lowland and highland geographies typically found in the two areas.

==Classification==
As a technical term, the &quot;high&quot; in High German is a geographical reference to the group of dialects that forms &quot;High German&quot; (i.e. &quot;Highland&quot; German), out of which developed Standard German, Yiddish and Luxembourgish. It refers to the Central Uplands (&quot;Mittelgebirge&quot;) and Alpine areas of central and southern Germany; it also includes Luxembourg, Austria, Liechtenstein, and most of Switzerland. This is opposed to Low German, which is spoken in the lowlands and along the flat sea coasts of the North German Plain.

High German can be subdivided into Upper German (&quot;Oberdeutsch&quot;) and Central or Middle German (&quot;Mitteldeutsch&quot;, this includes Luxembourgish, which itself is now a standard language).

High German varieties are distinguished from other West Germanic varieties in that they took part in the High German consonant shift () to various degrees. To see this, compare the following:
In the southernmost High Alemannic dialects, there is a further shift: &quot;Sack&quot; (like English/Low German &quot;sack/Sack&quot;) is pronounced ( to ).

==History==

Old High German evolved from about 500 AD. Around 1200 the Swabian and East Franconian varieties of Middle High German became dominant as a court and poetry language (&quot;Minnesang&quot;) under the rule of the House of Hohenstaufen.

The term &quot;High German&quot; as spoken in central and southern Germany (Upper Saxony, Franconia, Swabia, Bavaria) and Austria was first documented in the 15th century.

Gradually driving back Low German variants since the Early modern period, the Early New High German varieties, especially the East Central German of the Luther Bible, formed an important basis for the development of Standard German.

==Family==

Divisions between subfamilies within Germanic are rarely precisely defined, because most form continuous clines, with adjacent dialects being mutually intelligible and more separated ones not. In particular, there has never been an original &quot;Proto-High German&quot;. For this and other reasons, the idea of representing the relationships between West Germanic language forms in a tree diagram at all is controversial among linguists. What follows should be used with care in the light of this caveat.

<text>Wayne Francis Woodard ( ; July 2, 1914 – April 11, 1964), known by the pseudonym Hannes Bok, was an American artist and illustrator, as well as an amateur astrologer and writer of fantasy fiction and poetry. He painted nearly 150 covers for various science fiction, fantasy, and detective fiction magazines, as well as contributing hundreds of black and white interior illustrations. Bok&#x27;s work graced the pages of calendars and early fanzines, as well as dust jackets from specialty book publishers like Arkham House, Llewellyn, Shasta Publishers, and Fantasy Press. His paintings achieved a luminous quality through the use of an arduous glazing process, which was learned from his mentor, Maxfield Parrish. Bok shared one of the inaugural 1953 Hugo Awards for science fiction achievement (best Cover Artist).

==Life and career==
Wayne Woodard (the name is sometimes mistakenly rendered as &quot;Woodward&quot;) was born in Kansas City, Missouri. His parents divorced when he was five; and his father and stepmother, strict disciplinarians, discouraged his artistic efforts. Once he graduated high school, in Duluth, Minnesota, Bok cut off contact with his father and moved to Seattle to live with his mother. There he became active in SF fandom, including the publication and illustration of fanzines. It was in connection with these activities that he originated his pseudonym, first &quot;Hans&quot;, then &quot;Hannes&quot;, Bok. The pseudonym derives from Johann Sebastian Bach (whose name can be rendered both as &quot;Johann S. Bach&quot; and &quot;Johannes Bach&quot;).

In 1937, Bok moved to Los Angeles, where he met Ray Bradbury. In 1938, he relocated to Seattle – where he worked for the W.P.A. and became acquainted with artists like Mark Tobey and Morris Graves. Late in 1939, Bok moved to New York City in order to be closer to the editors and magazines which would publish his work, and where he became a member of the influential Futurians science fiction fans. Bok had corresponded with and had met Maxfield Parrish (ca. 1939?), and the influence of Parrish&#x27;s art on Bok&#x27;s is evident in his choice of subject matter, use of color, and application of glazes.

Bok was gay, according to his friends Forrest J Ackerman and Emil Petaja. The erotic fantasy elements of his artwork, especially his male nude subjects, display homoerotic overtones unusual for the time. The opening chapters of his novel &quot;Beyond the Golden Stair&quot; hint at a sexual relationship between two prison inmates, the hero John Hibbert and the gangster Frank Scarlatti.

Like his contemporary Virgil Finlay, Hannes Bok broke into commercial art and achieved initial career success as a &quot;Weird Tales&quot; artist – though he did so through one of the stranger events in the history of science fiction and fantasy. In the summer of 1939, Ray Bradbury carried samples of Bok&#x27;s art eastward to introduce his friend&#x27;s work to magazine editors at the first World Science Fiction Convention. This was a bold move, since Bradbury was a neophyte with no connections to commercial art or the magazine industry; but it reflects the close ties within the fan and professional community. Bradbury was, at the time, a 19-year-old newspaper seller, and he borrowed funds for the trip from fellow science fiction fan Forrest J Ackerman. Bradbury succeeded; Farnsworth Wright, editor of &quot;Weird Tales&quot;, accepted Bok&#x27;s art, which debuted in the December 1939 issue of &quot;Weird Tales&quot;. More than 50 issues of the magazine featured Bok&#x27;s pen-and-ink work until March 1954. Bok also executed six color covers for &quot;Weird Tales&quot; between March 1940 and March 1942. &quot;Weird Tales&quot; also published five of Bok&#x27;s stories and two of his poems between 1942 and 1951. Once he broke through into professional publications, Bok moved to New York City and lived there the rest of his life.

Throughout his life, Bok was deeply interested in astrology, as well as in the music of the Finnish composer Jean Sibelius, with whom Bok had a correspondence. (Bok&#x27;s copy of Karl Ekman&#x27;s &quot;Jean Sibelius: His Life and Personality&quot; [Knopf, 1938], for example, is annotated with Bok&#x27;s comments and astrological charts.) As the years passed, Bok became prone to disagreements with editors over money and artistic issues; he grew reclusive and mystical, and preoccupied with the occult. He eked out a living, often in near poverty, until his death in 1964. He died, apparently of a heart attack (he &quot;starved to death&quot; according to Ackerman), at the age of 49. ISFDB catalogs only a few 1956 interior illustrations after March 1954, his last for &quot;Weird Tales&quot;, and only two cover illustrations after January 1957.

<text>&quot;&quot; () is the unofficial national anthem of Wales. The title, taken from the first words of the song, means &quot;The Old Land of My Fathers&quot; in Welsh, usually rendered in English as simply &quot;Land of My Fathers&quot;. The words were written by Evan James and the tune composed by his son, James James, both residents of Pontypridd, Glamorgan, in January 1856. The earliest written copy survives and is part of the collections of the National Library of Wales.

== History ==
=== Origins ===

&quot;Glan Rhondda&quot; (&quot;Banks of the Rhondda&quot;), as it was known when it was composed, was first performed in the vestry of the original Capel Tabor, Maesteg (which later became a working men&#x27;s club), in either January or February 1856, by Elizabeth John from Pontypridd, and it soon became popular in the locality.

James James, the composer, was a harpist who played his instrument in the public house which he ran, for the purpose of dancing. The song was originally intended to be performed in time but had to be slowed down to its present tempo when it began to be sung by large crowds.

=== Popularity ===
The popularity of the song increased after the Llangollen Eisteddfod of 1858. Thomas Llewelyn of Aberdare won a competition for an unpublished collection of Welsh airs with a collection that included &quot;Glan Rhondda&quot;. The adjudicator of the competition, &quot;Owain Alaw&quot; (John Owen, 1821–1883) asked for permission to include &quot;Glan Rhondda&quot; in his publication, &quot;Gems of Welsh melody&quot; (1860–1864). This volume gave &quot;Glan Rhondda&quot; its more famous title, &quot;&quot;, and was sold in large quantities and ensured the popularity of the anthem across the whole of Wales.

At the Bangor Eisteddfod of 1874 &quot;&quot; gained further popularity when it was sung by Robert Rees (&quot;Eos Morlais&quot;), one of the leading Welsh soloists of his day. It was increasingly sung at patriotic gatherings and gradually it developed into a national anthem.

&quot;Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau&quot; was also one of the first Welsh-language songs recorded, when Madge Breese sang it on 11 March 1899, for the Gramophone Company, as part of the first recording in the Welsh language.

&quot;Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau&quot; was the first national anthem to be sung at the start of a sporting event. In 1905, the Welsh national rugby team hosted New Zealand&#x27;s first touring team, who started every match performing a haka. As a response, Wales player Teddy Morgan led the crowd singing the anthem. Although crowds often sang anthems during games, there was no precedent for an anthem to be sung before a match.

In 1978 for their &quot;Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau&quot; album, Geraint Jarman a&#x27;r Cynganeddwyr recorded a version of the anthem using electric guitars, inspired by Jimi Hendrix&#x27;s rendition of &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot; (as famously performed during the Woodstock festival in 1969 and featured in the documentary of that festival released in 1970). Jarman&#x27;s version, played by Welsh guitarist Tich Gwilym, is one of the most famous modern versions of the song.

==Usage==
Tradition has established &quot;Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau&quot; as a de facto Welsh national anthem since 1905, when it was first sung by fans at rugby games, although the official anthem at the time was &quot;God Save the King&quot;. &quot;Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau&quot; slowly established itself as the more popular anthem over the next four decades and was sung along with &quot;God Bless the Prince of Wales&quot; and &quot;God Save the Queen&quot; before sporting events until 1975, when sports officials decided that &quot;Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau&quot; should be sung alone. Like other British anthems, it has not been established as a national anthem by law, but it has been used as a national anthem at official governmental ceremonies, including the opening of the Welsh Parliament / Senedd Cymru, and at receptions of the British monarchy since the 1970s. Petitions to make the song an official national anthem for Wales are occasionally submitted to the Senedd, but the last time one raised sufficient signatures to be debated, in 2014, the conclusion was that this is &#x27;not currently a possible development&#x27;. It is recognised and used as an anthem at both national and local events in Wales.
Usually, &quot;Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau&quot; will be the only anthem sung: only the first stanza and chorus are usually sung (and in the Welsh language). &quot;God Save the King&quot;, the national anthem of the United Kingdom, is sometimes played alongside &quot;Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau&quot; during official events with a royal connection.

The existence of a separate national anthem for Wales has not always been apparent to those from outside the country. In 1993, the newly appointed Secretary of State for Wales, John Redwood, was embarrassingly videotaped opening and closing his mouth during a communal singing of the national anthem, clearly ignorant of the words but unable to mime convincingly; the pictures were frequently cited as evidence of his unsuitability for the post. According to John Major&#x27;s autobiography, the first thing Redwood&#x27;s successor William Hague said, on being appointed, was that he had better find someone to teach him the words. He found Ffion Jenkins, and later married her.

&quot;Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau&quot; has been adapted to the anthems of Cornwall (&quot;Bro Goth agan Tasow&quot;), Brittany (&quot;Bro Gozh ma Zadoù&quot;), and Y Wladfa (&quot;Gwlad Newydd y Cymry&quot;, see below). These adaptions share the same tune as &quot;Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau&quot; and have similar lyrics.

==Lyrics==
==Cultural influence==
The Welsh poet Dylan Thomas is often quoted as saying &quot;The land of my fathers. My fathers can have it!&quot; in reference to Wales. However, this is misleading, as it was a villainous character in one of Thomas&#x27; short stories that spoke this line.

Gwynfor Evans named his history of Wales &quot;Land of my fathers: 2,000 years of Welsh history&quot;. It was a translation of the Welsh original, &quot;Aros Mae&quot;.

The £1 coins minted in 1985, 1990, 1995 and 2000 with a Welsh emblem on the reverse, also bear the edge inscription (&quot;I am devoted to my country&quot;), from the refrain of &quot;Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau&quot;. The new Royal Badge of Wales adopted in 2008 features this motto.

== &quot;Gwlad Newydd y Cymry&quot; ==
A version of &quot;Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau&quot; was written by Lewis Evans, a migrant from Wales to Y Wladfa, a Welsh-speaking settlement in Patagonia, South America. The version penned by Evans is called &quot;Gwlad Newydd y Cymry&quot; (&quot;The New Country of the Welsh&quot;). &quot;Gwlad Newydd y Cymry&quot; is played to the same tune as &quot;Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau&quot;.

The lyrics to &quot;Gwlad Newydd y Cymry&quot; are as follows (note that the spelling is not consistent with modern Welsh):

<text>Hermanus &quot;Herman&quot; Brood (; 5 November 1946 – 11 July 2001) was a Dutch musician, painter, actor and poet. As a musician he achieved artistic and commercial success in the 1970s and 1980s, and was called &quot;the greatest and only Dutch rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll star&quot;. Later in life he started a successful career as a painter.

Known for his hedonistic lifestyle of &quot;sex, drugs and rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll&quot;, Brood was an &quot;enfant terrible&quot; and a cultural figure whose suicide by jumping from a hotel roof, apparently influenced by a failure to kick his drug and alcohol habit, strengthened his controversial status; according to a poll organised to celebrate fifty years of Dutch popular music, it was the most significant event in its history.

==Musical career==
Herman Brood was born in Zwolle, and started playing the piano at age 12. He founded beat band The Moans in 1964, which would later become Long Tall Ernie and the Shakers. Brood was asked to play with Cuby and the Blizzards, but was removed by management when the record company discovered he used drugs. For a number of years Brood was in jail (for dealing LSD), or abroad, and had a number of short-term engagements (with The Studs, the Flash &amp; Dance Band, Vitesse).

In 1976, Brood started his own group, Herman Brood &amp; His Wild Romance (and started work with photographer Anton Corbijn), initially with Ferdi Karmelk (guitar), Gerrit Veen (bass), Peter Walrecht (drums), and Ellen Piebes and Ria Ruiters (vocals). They played the club and bar circuit, first in Groningen (the northeasternmost province of the Netherlands). In 1977 the band released their first album, &quot;Street&quot;.

The band played all over the Netherlands, playing as many gigs as possible. And Herman&#x27;s drug habit became public: In 1977 for instance the Wild Romance played a gig in a high school in Almelo, the Christelijk Lyceum; during the break Brood was caught on the toilet taking heroin or speed (there are different reports on the type of drug, but it is a well-known story amongst former students), the rest of the concert was cancelled, and this also was the last time a rock concert took place at this school for many years.

They are still best known for their second album, &quot;Shpritsz&quot;—a play on the German word &quot;Spritze&quot; for &quot;syringe&quot;—from 1978. This album contained Brood anthems like &quot;Dope Sucks,&quot; &quot;Rock &amp; Roll Junkie,&quot; and their first Dutch hit single, &quot;Saturday Night.&quot; The band went through many personnel changes over the years; the best-known formation was Freddy Cavalli (bass), Dany Lademacher (guitar) (later replaced with David Hollestelle), and Cees &#x27;Ani&#x27; Meerman (drums). A frequent contributor was Bertus Borgers (saxophone).

Brood&#x27;s outspoken statements in the press about sex and drug use brought him into the Dutch public arena even more than his music. He was romantically involved with the German singer Nina Hagen, with whom he appeared in the 1979 film &quot;Cha-Cha&quot;. He is reputed to be the subject of her song &quot;Herrmann Hiess Er&quot; (English title &quot;Herrmann Was His Name&quot;) from the 1979 &quot;Unbehagen&quot; album, a song about a drug addict. Brood relished the media attention and became the most famous hard drug user in the Netherlands. &quot;It is quite common for an artist to use drugs, but not for him to tell everybody. I admit that it scared me that my popularity could make people start using drugs,&quot; he once said in an interview.

In the summer of 1979, Brood tried to enter the American market, with support from Ariola&#x27;s US division, which was attempting to expand into rock music. Following on the success of &quot;Shpritsz&quot;, the band was booked as a support act for The Kinks and The Cars, playing in auditoriums; &quot;Herman Brood and His Wild Romance Tour Cha Cha &#x27;79&quot; headlined in New York&#x27;s (Bottom Line) and Los Angeles&#x27; (Roxy). A re-recorded version of &quot;Saturday Night&quot; peaked at number 35 in the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, but the big break Brood hoped for didn&#x27;t happen. When he returned to the Netherlands in October 1979, his band had begun to fall apart, and soon his popularity went downhill. &quot;Go Nutz&quot;, the album Brood had recorded while in the States, and the movie &quot;Cha-Cha&quot;, which finally premiered in December 1979, were considered artistic failures, even though &quot;Go Nutz&quot; produced three charting singles in the Netherlands and the &quot;Cha Cha&quot; soundtrack attained platinum status. The 1980 album &quot;Wait a Minute...&quot; was a minor success, but the follow-up albums &quot;Modern Times Revive&quot; (1981) and &quot;Frisz &amp; Sympatisz&quot; (1982) failed to make the Dutch album charts.

Brood continued to record throughout the 1980s and had a few hits—a top-10 single, &quot;Als Je Wint&quot; with Henny Vrienten, and a minor hit with a reggae song, &quot;Tattoo Song,&quot; but he spent more and more time on his art work. At the end of the &#x27;80s he made a comeback of sorts; &quot;Yada Yada&quot; (1988), produced by George Kooymans, was well-received, and he toured Germany with a renewed Wild Romance (which saw the return of Dany Lademacher). In 1990, he won the BV Popprijs, one of the highest Dutch awards for popular music, and recorded &quot;Freeze&quot; with Clarence Clemons of the E Street Band and Tejano accordion player Flaco Jiménez. A live &quot;best of&quot; album, &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, appeared in 1992. His 50th birthday, in 1996, was celebrated with a show at the Paradiso music and cultural center in Amsterdam, and the album (of duets) was released the same year.

==Visual arts career==
After his career in music, Brood turned to painting and became a well-known character in Amsterdam art circles. His art is best described as pop-art, often very colorful and graffiti-inspired screen prints, and he achieved some commercial success and notoriety by, for instance, creating murals in various public spaces in and around Amsterdam. He continued to remain in the public eye, by appearing in the media and by his cooperation with biographical films such as 1994&#x27;s &quot;Rock&#x27;n Roll Junkie&quot;.

==Suicide and legacy==
Toward the end of his life, Brood vowed to abstain from most drugs, reducing his drug use to alcohol and a daily shot of speed (&quot;2 grams per day&quot;). On 11 July 2001, depressed by the failure of his drug rehabilitation program and facing serious medical problems because of his prolonged drug use, he committed suicide by jumping from the roof of the Amsterdam Hilton Hotel at the age of 54. He left a note, stating &quot;Ik heb er geen zin meer in, misschien zie ik jullie nog wel eens. Maak er een mooi feest van.&quot; which translates to &quot;I don&#x27;t feel like it anymore, maybe I&#x27;ll see you all again some day. Have a nice party.&quot;

Extensively covered by the national media, his cremation took place five days later. Before the cremation, Brood&#x27;s coffin was driven from the Hilton hotel to Paradiso, Amsterdam, the streets lined with thousands of spectators. A commemorative concert was held in Paradiso, with performances by Hans Dulfer, André Hazes, and Jules Deelder, and the leading Dutch music magazine &quot;Muziekkrant OOR&quot; devoted an entire issue to him. His ashes were inurned at Zorgvlied cemetery.

Soon after his suicide, Brood&#x27;s version of &quot;My Way&quot; spent three weeks as number one in the Dutch singles charts; the market value of his art work also increased greatly. A characteristic note is that Brood&#x27;s paintings had often been targeted by vandals during his life, but after his death they were stolen for their value. His popularity (or notoriety) was confirmed by the fact that his name turned out to be the strongest brand of the year.

When U2 performed in the Netherlands three weeks after Brood&#x27;s suicide, they paid tribute to him at each of the three shows. They dedicated a version of &quot;Stuck in a Moment You Can&#x27;t Get Out Of&quot; (written for Michael Hutchence after his death) to him, with Bono singing Brood&#x27;s &quot;When I Get Home&quot; as an a capella intro.

At the third show in Arnhem they also dedicated their own &quot;Gone&quot; to him and had his version of &quot;My Way&quot; played over the PA as outro music. In the middle of the show Bono delivered an emotional eulogy to Brood before the band performed &quot;In a Little While&quot;.

On 5 November 2006 the Groninger Museum opened an exposition devoted to Herman Brood&#x27;s life and work, comprising paintings, lyrics, and poetry, portraits by photographer Anton Corbijn, a collection of private pictures (from the family album), and concert photos and videos. The exhibition continued until 28January. It was centered on Herman&#x27;s atelier (studio) where he created most of his paintings. The atelier had been entirely re-built in the museum. During the 1990s, Herman Brood&#x27;s studio was located on the second floor of the gallery in the Spuistraat in Amsterdam and has remained untouched since his death.

In 2007 the film &quot;Wild Romance&quot;, a movie about Brood&#x27;s life, premiered in the Netherlands, with Brood portrayed by Daniël Boissevain. He continues to inspire other artists: the 2007 album &quot;Bluefinger&quot; by Black Francis is based on Brood&#x27;s life and works. A tribute band called the Brood Roosters (&quot;bread toasters&quot;) was active in the Netherlands until they split up in early 2009. Another tribute band called Yada Yada is still active in the Netherlands, often appearing with original members of the Wild Romance (Dany Lademacher, Ramon Rambeaux).

In 2010 the Catastrophic Theatre Company collaborated with Frank Black on a rock opera based on the &quot;Bluefinger&quot; album. The opera&#x27;s first performance, with Matt Kelly portraying Brood, was on 12 November 2010 in Houston, Texas.

<doc id="13564" wikidata="Q215111" url="?curid=13564" title="Homomorphism">
<text>In algebra, a homomorphism is a structure-preserving map between two algebraic structures of the same type (such as two groups, two rings, or two vector spaces). The word &quot;homomorphism&quot; comes from the Ancient Greek language: () meaning &quot;same&quot; and () meaning &quot;form&quot; or &quot;shape&quot;. However, the word was apparently introduced to mathematics due to a (mis)translation of German meaning &quot;similar&quot; to meaning &quot;same&quot;. The term &quot;homomorphism&quot; appeared as early as 1892, when it was attributed to the German mathematician Felix Klein (1849–1925).

Homomorphisms of vector spaces are also called linear maps, and their study is the subject of linear algebra.

The concept of homomorphism has been generalized, under the name of morphism, to many other structures that either do not have an underlying set, or are not algebraic. This generalization is the starting point of category theory.

A homomorphism may also be an isomorphism, an endomorphism, an automorphism, etc. (see below). Each of those can be defined in a way that may be generalized to any class of morphisms.

== Definition ==
A homomorphism is a map between two algebraic structures of the same type (e.g. two groups, two fields, two vector spaces), that preserves the operations of the structures. This means a map formula_1 between two sets formula_2, formula_3 equipped with the same structure such that, if formula_4 is an operation of the structure (supposed here, for simplification, to be a binary operation), then

formula_5

for every pair formula_6, formula_7 of elements of formula_2. One says often that formula_9 preserves the operation or is compatible with the operation.

Formally, a map formula_10 preserves an operation formula_11 of arity formula_12, defined on both formula_2 and formula_3 if 

formula_15 

for all elements formula_16 in formula_2.

The operations that must be preserved by a homomorphism include 0-ary operations, that is the constants. In particular, when an identity element is required by the type of structure, the identity element of the first structure must be mapped to the corresponding identity element of the second structure.

For example:

* A semigroup homomorphism is a map between semigroups that preserves the semigroup operation.
* A monoid homomorphism is a map between monoids that preserves the monoid operation and maps the identity element of the first monoid to that of the second monoid (the identity element is a 0-ary operation).
* A group homomorphism is a map between groups that preserves the group operation. This implies that the group homomorphism maps the identity element of the first group to the identity element of the second group, and maps the inverse of an element of the first group to the inverse of the image of this element. Thus a semigroup homomorphism between groups is necessarily a group homomorphism.
* A ring homomorphism is a map between rings that preserves the ring addition, the ring multiplication, and the multiplicative identity. Whether the multiplicative identity is to be preserved depends upon the definition of &quot;ring&quot; in use. If the multiplicative identity is not preserved, one has a rng homomorphism.
* A linear map is a homomorphism of vector spaces; that is, a group homomorphism between vector spaces that preserves the abelian group structure and scalar multiplication.
* A module homomorphism, also called a linear map between modules, is defined similarly.
* An algebra homomorphism is a map that preserves the algebra operations.

An algebraic structure may have more than one operation, and a homomorphism is required to preserve each operation. Thus a map that preserves only some of the operations is not a homomorphism of the structure, but only a homomorphism of the substructure obtained by considering only the preserved operations. For example, a map between monoids that preserves the monoid operation and not the identity element, is not a monoid homomorphism, but only a semigroup homomorphism.

The notation for the operations does not need to be the same in the source and the target of a homomorphism. For example, the real numbers form a group for addition, and the positive real numbers form a group for multiplication. The exponential function 

formula_18

satisfies

formula_19

and is thus a homomorphism between these two groups. It is even an isomorphism (see below), as its inverse function, the natural logarithm, satisfies 

formula_20
and is also a group homomorphism.

== Examples ==
The real numbers are a ring, having both addition and multiplication. The set of all 2×2 matrices is also a ring, under matrix addition and matrix multiplication. If we define a function between these rings as follows:

formula_21

where is a real number, then is a homomorphism of rings, since preserves both addition:

formula_22

and multiplication:

formula_23

For another example, the nonzero complex numbers form a group under the operation of multiplication, as do the nonzero real numbers. (Zero must be excluded from both groups since it does not have a multiplicative inverse, which is required for elements of a group.) Define a function formula_9 from the nonzero complex numbers to the nonzero real numbers by

formula_25

That is, formula_9 is the absolute value (or modulus) of the complex number formula_27. Then formula_9 is a homomorphism of groups, since it preserves multiplication:

formula_29

Note that cannot be extended to a homomorphism of rings (from the complex numbers to the real numbers), since it does not preserve addition:

formula_30

As another example, the diagram shows a monoid homomorphism formula_9 from the monoid formula_32 to the monoid formula_33. Due to the different names of corresponding operations, the structure preservation properties satisfied by formula_9 amount to formula_35 and formula_36.

A composition algebra formula_2 over a field formula_38 has a quadratic form, called a &quot;norm&quot;, formula_39, which is a group homomorphism from the multiplicative group of formula_2 to the multiplicative group of formula_38.

== Special homomorphisms ==
Several kinds of homomorphisms have a specific name, which is also defined for general morphisms.
=== Isomorphism ===
An isomorphism between algebraic structures of the same type is commonly defined as a bijective homomorphism.

In the more general context of category theory, an isomorphism is defined as a morphism that has an inverse that is also a morphism. In the specific case of algebraic structures, the two definitions are equivalent, although they may differ for non-algebraic structures, which have an underlying set.

More precisely, if 

formula_42

is a (homo)morphism, it has an inverse if there exists a homomorphism

formula_43

such that

formula_44

If formula_2 and formula_3 have underlying sets, and formula_1 has an inverse formula_48, then formula_9 is bijective. In fact, formula_9 is injective, as formula_51 implies formula_52, and formula_9 is surjective, as, for any formula_6 in formula_3, one has formula_56, and formula_6 is the image of an element of formula_2.

Conversely, if formula_1 is a bijective homomorphism between algebraic structures, let formula_60 be the map such that formula_61 is the unique element formula_6 of formula_2 such that formula_64. One has formula_65 and it remains only to show that is a homomorphism. If formula_66 is a binary operation of the structure, for every pair formula_6, formula_7 of elements of formula_3, one has

formula_70

and formula_48 is thus compatible with formula_72 As the proof is similar for any arity, this shows that formula_48 is a homomorphism.

This proof does not work for non-algebraic structures. For example, for topological spaces, a morphism is a continuous map, and the inverse of a bijective continuous map is not necessarily continuous. An isomorphism of topological spaces, called homeomorphism or bicontinuous map, is thus a bijective continuous map, whose inverse is also continuous.

===Endomorphism===
An endomorphism is a homomorphism whose domain equals the codomain, or, more generally, a morphism whose source is equal to its target.

The endomorphisms of an algebraic structure, or of an object of a category, form a monoid under composition.

The endomorphisms of a vector space or of a module form a ring. In the case of a vector space or a free module of finite dimension, the choice of a basis induces a ring isomorphism between the ring of endomorphisms and the ring of square matrices of the same dimension.

===Automorphism===

An automorphism is an endomorphism that is also an isomorphism.

The automorphisms of an algebraic structure or of an object of a category form a group under composition, which is called the automorphism group of the structure.

Many groups that have received a name are automorphism groups of some algebraic structure. For example, the general linear group formula_74 is the automorphism group of a vector space of dimension formula_75 over a field formula_12.

The automorphism groups of fields were introduced by Évariste Galois for studying the roots of polynomials, and are the basis of Galois theory.

===Monomorphism===
For algebraic structures, monomorphisms are commonly defined as injective homomorphisms. 

In the more general context of category theory, a monomorphism is defined as a morphism that is left cancelable. This means that a (homo)morphism formula_77 is a monomorphism if, for any pair formula_48, formula_79 of morphisms from any other object formula_80 to formula_2, then formula_82 implies formula_83.

These two definitions of &quot;monomorphism&quot; are equivalent for all common algebraic structures. More precisely, they are equivalent for fields, for which every homomorphism is a monomorphism, and for varieties of universal algebra, that is algebraic structures for which operations and axioms (identities) are defined without any restriction (the fields do not form a variety, as the multiplicative inverse is defined either as a unary operation or as a property of the multiplication, which are, in both cases, defined only for nonzero elements).

In particular, the two definitions of a monomorphism are equivalent for sets, magmas, semigroups, monoids, groups, rings, fields, vector spaces and modules.

A split monomorphism is a homomorphism that has a left inverse and thus it is itself a right inverse of that other homomorphism. That is, a homomorphism formula_84 is a split monomorphism if there exists a homomorphism formula_85 such that formula_86 A split monomorphism is always a monomorphism, for both meanings of &quot;monomorphism&quot;. For sets and vector spaces, every monomorphism is a split monomorphism, but this property does not hold for most common algebraic structures.
&quot;An injective homomorphism is left cancelable&quot;: If formula_87 one has formula_88 for every formula_6 in formula_80, the common source of formula_48 and formula_79. If formula_9 is injective, then formula_94, and thus formula_83. This proof works not only for algebraic structures, but also for any category whose objects are sets and arrows are maps between these sets. For example, an injective continuous map is a monomorphism in the category of topological spaces.

For proving that, conversely, a left cancelable homomorphism is injective, it is useful to consider a &quot;free object on formula_6&quot;. Given a variety of algebraic structures a free object on formula_6 is a pair consisting of an algebraic structure formula_98 of this variety and an element formula_6 of formula_98 satisfying the following universal property: for every structure formula_101 of the variety, and every element formula_102 of formula_101, there is a unique homomorphism formula_104 such that formula_105. For example, for sets, the free object on formula_6 is simply formula_107; for semigroups, the free object on formula_6 is formula_109 which, as, a semigroup, is isomorphic to the additive semigroup of the positive integers; for monoids, the free object on formula_6 is formula_111 which, as, a monoid, is isomorphic to the additive monoid of the nonnegative integers; for groups, the free object on formula_6 is the infinite cyclic group formula_113 which, as, a group, is isomorphic to the additive group of the integers; for rings, the free object on formula_6 is the polynomial ring formula_115 for vector spaces or modules, the free object on formula_6 is the vector space or free module that has formula_6 as a basis.

&quot;If a free object over formula_6 exists, then every left cancelable homomorphism is injective&quot;: let formula_84 be a left cancelable homomorphism, and formula_120 and formula_121 be two elements of formula_2 such formula_123. By definition of the free object formula_38, there exist homomorphisms formula_48 and formula_79 from formula_38 to formula_2 such that formula_129 and formula_130. As formula_131, one has formula_132 by the uniqueness in the definition of a universal property. As formula_9 is left cancelable, one has formula_83, and thus formula_135. Therefore, formula_9 is injective.

&quot;Existence of a free object on formula_6 for a variety&quot; (see also ): For building a free object over formula_6, consider the set formula_139 of the well-formed formulas built up from formula_6 and the operations of the structure. Two such formulas are said equivalent if one may pass from one to the other by applying the axioms (identities of the structure). This defines an equivalence relation, if the identities are not subject to conditions, that is if one works with a variety. Then the operations of the variety are well defined on the set of equivalence classes of formula_139 for this relation. It is straightforward to show that the resulting object is a free object on formula_6.
===Epimorphism===

In algebra, epimorphisms are often defined as surjective homomorphisms. On the other hand, in category theory, epimorphisms are defined as right cancelable morphisms. This means that a (homo)morphism formula_1 is an epimorphism if, for any pair formula_48, formula_79 of morphisms from formula_3 to any other object formula_80, the equality formula_148 implies formula_83.

A surjective homomorphism is always right cancelable, but the converse is not always true for algebraic structures. However, the two definitions of &quot;epimorphism&quot; are equivalent for sets, vector spaces, abelian groups, modules (see below for a proof), and groups. The importance of these structures in all mathematics, especially in linear algebra and homological algebra, may explain the coexistence of two non-equivalent definitions.

Algebraic structures for which there exist non-surjective epimorphisms include semigroups and rings. The most basic example is the inclusion of integers into rational numbers, which is a homomorphism of rings and of multiplicative semigroups. For both structures it is a monomorphism and a non-surjective epimorphism, but not an isomorphism.

A wide generalization of this example is the localization of a ring by a multiplicative set. Every localization is a ring epimorphism, which is not, in general, surjective. As localizations are fundamental in commutative algebra and algebraic geometry, this may explain why in these areas, the definition of epimorphisms as right cancelable homomorphisms is generally preferred.

A split epimorphism is a homomorphism that has a right inverse and thus it is itself a left inverse of that other homomorphism. That is, a homomorphism formula_84 is a split epimorphism if there exists a homomorphism formula_85 such that formula_152 A split epimorphism is always an epimorphism, for both meanings of &quot;epimorphism&quot;. For sets and vector spaces, every epimorphism is a split epimorphism, but this property does not hold for most common algebraic structures.

In summary, one has 

formula_153

the last implication is an equivalence for sets, vector spaces, modules, abelian groups, and groups; the first implication is an equivalence for sets and vector spaces.

Let formula_84 be a homomorphism. We want to prove that if it is not surjective, it is not right cancelable.

In the case of sets, let formula_121 be an element of formula_3 that not belongs to formula_157, and define formula_158 such that formula_48 is the identity function, and that formula_160 for every formula_161 except that formula_162 is any other element of formula_3. Clearly formula_9 is not right cancelable, as formula_165 and formula_166

In the case of vector spaces, abelian groups and modules, the proof relies on the existence of cokernels and on the fact that the zero maps are homomorphisms: let formula_80 be the cokernel of formula_9, and formula_169 be the canonical map, such that formula_170. Let formula_171 be the zero map. If formula_9 is not surjective, formula_173, and thus formula_165 (one is a zero map, while the other is not). Thus formula_9 is not cancelable, as formula_148 (both are the zero map from formula_2 to formula_80).
== Kernel ==
Any homomorphism formula_179 defines an equivalence relation formula_180 on formula_181 by formula_182 if and only if formula_123. The relation formula_180 is called the kernel of formula_9. It is a congruence relation on formula_181. The quotient set formula_187 can then be given a structure of the same type as formula_181, in a natural way, by defining the operations of the quotient set by formula_189, for each operation formula_190 of formula_181. In that case the image of formula_181 in formula_193 under the homomorphism formula_9 is necessarily isomorphic to formula_195; this fact is one of the isomorphism theorems.

When the algebraic structure is a group for some operation, the equivalence class formula_196 of the identity element of this operation suffices to characterize the equivalence relation. In this case, the quotient by the equivalence relation is denoted by formula_197 (usually read as &quot;formula_181 mod formula_196&quot;). Also in this case, it is formula_196, rather than formula_180, that is called the kernel of formula_9. The kernels of homomorphisms of a given type of algebraic structure are naturally equipped with some structure. This structure type of the kernels is the same as the considered structure, in the case of abelian groups, vector spaces and modules, but is different and has received a specific name in other cases, such as normal subgroup for kernels of group homomorphisms and ideals for kernels of ring homomorphisms (in the case of non-commutative rings, the kernels are the two-sided ideals).

== Relational structures ==

In model theory, the notion of an algebraic structure is generalized to structures involving both operations and relations. Let &quot;L&quot; be a signature consisting of function and relation symbols, and &quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot; be two &quot;L&quot;-structures. Then a homomorphism from &quot;A&quot; to &quot;B&quot; is a mapping &quot;h&quot; from the domain of &quot;A&quot; to the domain of &quot;B&quot; such that

* &quot;h&quot;(&quot;F&quot;&quot;A&quot;(&quot;a&quot;1...,&quot;a&quot;&quot;n&quot;)) = &quot;F&quot;&quot;B&quot;(&quot;h&quot;(&quot;a&quot;1)...,&quot;h&quot;(&quot;a&quot;&quot;n&quot;)) for each &quot;n&quot;-ary function symbol &quot;F&quot; in &quot;L&quot;,
* &quot;R&quot;&quot;A&quot;(&quot;a&quot;1...,&quot;a&quot;&quot;n&quot;) implies &quot;R&quot;&quot;B&quot;(&quot;h&quot;(&quot;a&quot;1)...,&quot;h&quot;(&quot;a&quot;&quot;n&quot;)) for each &quot;n&quot;-ary relation symbol &quot;R&quot; in &quot;L&quot;.

In the special case with just one binary relation, we obtain the notion of a graph homomorphism.

==Formal language theory==
Homomorphisms are also used in the study of formal languages and are often briefly referred to as &quot;morphisms&quot;. Given alphabets formula_203 and formula_204, a function formula_205 such that formula_206 for all formula_207 is called a &quot;homomorphism&quot; on formula_208. If formula_79 is a homomorphism on formula_208 and formula_211 denotes the empty string, then formula_79 is called an formula_211&quot;-free homomorphism&quot; when formula_214 for all formula_215 in formula_208.

A homomorphism formula_205 on formula_208 that satisfies formula_219 for all formula_220 is called a formula_12&quot;-uniform&quot; homomorphism. If formula_222 for all formula_220 (that is, formula_79 is 1-uniform), then formula_79 is also called a &quot;coding&quot; or a &quot;projection&quot;.

The set formula_226 of words formed from the alphabet formula_227 may be thought of as the free monoid generated by Here the monoid operation is concatenation and the identity element is the empty word. From this perspective, a language homomorphism is precisely a monoid homomorphism.

<text>HyperCard is a software application and development kit for Apple Macintosh and Apple IIGS computers. It is among the first successful hypermedia systems predating the World Wide Web.

HyperCard combines a flat-file database with a graphical, flexible, user-modifiable interface. HyperCard includes a built-in programming language called HyperTalk for manipulating data and the user interface.

This combination of features – a database with simple form layout, flexible support for graphics, and ease of programming – suits HyperCard for many different projects such as rapid application development of applications and databases, interactive applications with no database requirements, command and control systems, and many examples in the demoscene.

HyperCard was originally released in 1987 for $49.95 and was included free with all new Macs sold afterwards. It was withdrawn from sale in March 2004, having received its final update in 1998 upon the return of Steve Jobs to Apple. HyperCard was not ported to Mac OS X, but can run in the Classic Environment on versions of Mac OS X that support it.

==Overview==

===Design===

HyperCard is based on the concept of a &quot;stack&quot; of virtual &quot;cards&quot;. Cards hold data, just as they would in a Rolodex card-filing device. Each card contains a set of interactive objects, including text fields, check boxes, buttons, and similar common graphical user interface (GUI) elements. Users browse the stack by navigating from card to card, using built-in navigation features, a powerful search mechanism, or through user-created scripts.

Users build or modify stacks by adding new cards. They place GUI objects on the cards using an interactive layout engine based on a simple drag-and-drop interface. Also, HyperCard includes prototype or template cards called backgrounds; when new cards are created they can refer to one of these background cards, which causes all of the objects on the background to &quot;show through&quot; behind the new card. This way, a stack of cards with a common layout and functionality can be created. The layout engine is similar in concept to a form as used in most rapid application development (RAD) environments such as Borland Delphi, and Microsoft Visual Basic and Visual Studio.

The database features of the HyperCard system are based on the storage of the state of all of the objects on the cards in the physical file representing the stack. The database does not exist as a separate system within the HyperCard stack; no database engine or similar construct exists. Instead, the state of any object in the system is considered to be live and editable at any time. From the HyperCard runtime&#x27;s perspective, there is no difference between moving a text field on the card and typing into it; both operations simply change the state of the target object within the stack. Such changes are immediately saved when complete, so typing into a field causes that text to be stored to the stack&#x27;s physical file. The system operates in a largely stateless fashion, with no need to save during operation. This is in common with many database-oriented systems, although somewhat different from document-based applications.

The final key element in HyperCard is the script, a single code-carrying element of every object within the stack. The script is a text field whose contents are interpreted in the HyperTalk language. Like any other property, the script of any object can be edited at any time and changes are saved as soon as they were complete. When the user invokes actions in the GUI, like clicking on a button or typing into a field, these actions are translated into events by the HyperCard runtime. The runtime then examines the script of the object that is the target of the event, like a button, to see if its script object contains the event&#x27;s code, called a handler. If it does, the HyperTalk engine runs the handler; if it does not, the runtime examines other objects in the visual hierarchy.
These concepts make up the majority of the HyperCard system; stacks, backgrounds and cards provide a form-like GUI system, the stack file provides object persistence and database-like functionality, and HyperTalk allows handlers to be written for GUI events. Unlike the majority of RAD or database systems of the era, however, HyperCard combines all of these features, both user-facing and developer-facing, in a single application. This allows rapid turnaround and immediate prototyping, possibly without any coding, allowing users to author custom solutions to problems with their own personalized interface. &quot;Empowerment&quot; became a catchword as this possibility was embraced by the Macintosh community, as was the phrase &quot;programming for the rest of us&quot;, that is, anyone, not just professional programmers.

It is this combination of features that also makes HyperCard a powerful hypermedia system. Users can build backgrounds to suit the needs of some system, say a rolodex, and use simple HyperTalk commands to provide buttons to move from place to place within the stack, or provide the same navigation system within the data elements of the UI, like text fields. Using these features, it is easy to build linked systems similar to hypertext links on the Web. Unlike the Web, programming, placement, and browsing are all the same tool. Similar systems have been created for HTML, but traditional Web services are considerably more heavyweight.

===HyperTalk===

HyperCard contains an object-oriented scripting language called HyperTalk, which was noted for having a syntax resembling casual English language. HyperTalk language features were predetermined by the HyperCard environment, although they could be extended by the use of externals functions (XFCN) and commands (XCMD), written in a compiled language. The weakly typed HyperTalk supports most standard programming structures such as &quot;if–then&quot; and &quot;repeat&quot;. HyperTalk is verbose, hence its ease of use and readability. HyperTalk code segments are referred to as &quot;scripts&quot;, a term that is considered less daunting to beginning programmers.

===Externals===
HyperCard can be extended significantly through the use of &quot;external command&quot; (XCMD) and &quot;external function&quot; (XFCN) modules. These are code libraries packaged in a resource fork that integrate into either the system generally or the HyperTalk language specifically; this is an early example of the plug-in concept. Unlike conventional plug-ins, these do not require separate installation before they are available for use; they can be included in a stack, where they are directly available to scripts in that stack.

During HyperCard&#x27;s peak popularity in the late 1980s, a whole ecosystem of vendors offered thousands of these externals such as HyperTalk compilers, graphing systems, database access, Internet connectivity, and animation. Oracle offered an XCMD that allows HyperCard to directly query Oracle databases on any platform, superseded by Oracle Card. BeeHive Technologies offered a hardware interface that allows the computer to control external devices. Connected via the Apple Desktop Bus (ADB), this instrument can read the state of connected external switches or write digital outputs to a multitude of devices.

Externals allow access to the Macintosh Toolbox, which contains many lower-level commands and functions not native to HyperTalk, such as control of the serial and ADB ports.

==History==
===Development===
HyperCard was created by Bill Atkinson following an LSD trip. Work for it began in March 1985 under the name of WildCard (hence its creator code of WILD). In 1986, Dan Winkler began work on HyperTalk and the name was changed to HyperCard for trademark reasons. It was released on 11 August 1987 for the first day of the MacWorld Conference &amp; Expo in Boston, with the understanding that Atkinson would give HyperCard to Apple only if the company promised to release it for free on all Macs. Apple timed its release to coincide with the MacWorld Conference &amp; Expo in Boston, Massachusetts to guarantee maximum publicity.

===Launch===
HyperCard was successful almost instantly. The Apple Programmer&#x27;s and Developer&#x27;s Association (APDA) said, &quot;HyperCard has been an informational feeding frenzy. From August [1987, when it was announced] to October our phones never stopped ringing. It was a zoo.&quot; Within a few months of release, there were multiple HyperCard books and a 50 disk set of public domain stacks. Apple&#x27;s project managers found HyperCard was being used by a huge number of people, internally and externally. Bug reports and upgrade suggestions continued to flow in, demonstrating its wide variety of users. Since it was also free, it was difficult to justify dedicating engineering resources to improvements in the software. Apple and its mainstream developers understood that HyperCard&#x27;s user empowerment could reduce the sales of ordinary shrink-wrapped products. Stewart Alsop II speculated that HyperCard might replace Finder as the shell of the Macintosh graphical user interface.

===HyperCard 2.0===
In late 1989, Kevin Calhoun, then a HyperCard engineer at Apple, led an effort to upgrade the program. This resulted in HyperCard 2.0, released in 1990. The new version included an on-the-fly compiler that greatly increased performance of computationally intensive code, a new debugger and many improvements to the underlying HyperTalk language.

At the same time HyperCard 2.0 was being developed, a separate group within Apple developed and in 1991 released HyperCard IIGS, a version of HyperCard for the Apple IIGS system. Aimed mainly at the education market, HyperCard IIGS has roughly the same feature set as the 1.x versions of Macintosh HyperCard, while adding support for the color graphics abilities of the IIGS. Although &quot;stacks&quot; (HyperCard program documents) are not binary-compatible, a translator program (another HyperCard stack) allows them to be moved from one platform to the other.

Then, Apple decided that most of its application software packages, including HyperCard, would be the property of a wholly owned subsidiary called Claris. Many of the HyperCard developers chose to stay at Apple rather than move to Claris, causing the development team to be split. Claris attempted to create a business model where HyperCard could also generate revenues. At first the freely-distributed versions of HyperCard shipped with authoring disabled. Early versions of Claris HyperCard contain an Easter Egg: typing &quot;magic&quot; into the message box converts the player into a full HyperCard authoring environment. When this trick became nearly universal, they wrote a new version, HyperCard Player, which Apple distributed with the Macintosh operating system, while Claris sold the full version commercially. Many users were upset that they had to pay to use software that had traditionally been supplied free and which many considered a basic part of the Mac.

Even after HyperCard was generating revenue, Claris did little to market it. Development continued with minor upgrades, and the first failed attempt to create a third generation of HyperCard. During this period, HyperCard began losing market share. Without several important, basic features, HyperCard authors began moving to systems such as SuperCard and Macromedia Authorware. Nonetheless, HyperCard continued to be popular and used for a widening range of applications, from the game &quot;The Manhole&quot;, an earlier effort by the creators of &quot;Myst&quot;, to corporate information services.

Apple eventually folded Claris back into the parent company, returning HyperCard to Apple&#x27;s core engineering group. In 1992, Apple released the eagerly anticipated upgrade of HyperCard 2.2 and included licensed versions of Color Tools and Addmotion II, adding support for color pictures and animations. However, these tools are limited and often cumbersome to use because HyperCard 2.0 lacks true, internal color support.

===HyperCard 3.0===
Several attempts were made to restart HyperCard development once it returned to Apple. Because of the product&#x27;s widespread use as a multimedia-authoring tool it was rolled into the QuickTime group. A new effort to allow HyperCard to create QuickTime interactive (QTi) movies started, once again under the direction of Kevin Calhoun. QTi extended QuickTime&#x27;s core multimedia playback features to provide true interactive facilities and a low-level programming language based on 68000 assembly language. The resulting HyperCard 3.0 was first presented in 1996 when an alpha-quality version was shown to developers at Apple&#x27;s annual Apple Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC). Under the leadership of Dan Crow development continued through the late 1990s, with public demos showing many popular features such as color support, Internet connectivity, and the ability to play HyperCard stacks (which were now special QuickTime movies) in a web browser. Development upon HyperCard 3.0 stalled when the QuickTime team was focused away from developing QuickTime interactive to the streaming features of QuickTime 4.0. in 1998 Steve Jobs disliked the software because Atkinson had chosen to stay at Apple to finish it instead of joining Jobs at NeXT, and (according to Atkinson) &quot;it had Sculley&#x27;s stink all over it&quot;. In 2000, the HyperCard engineering team was reassigned to other tasks after Jobs decided to abandon the product. Calhoun and Crow both left Apple shortly after, in 2001.

Its final release was in 1998, and it was totally discontinued in March 2004.

HyperCard runs natively only in the classic Mac OS, but it can still be used in Mac OS X&#x27;s Classic mode on PowerPC based machines (G5 and earlier). The last functional native HyperCard authoring environment is Classic mode in Mac OS X 10.4 (Tiger) on PowerPC-based machines.

==Applications==
HyperCard has been used for a range of hypertext and artistic purposes. Before the advent of PowerPoint, HyperCard was often used as a general-purpose presentation program. Examples of HyperCard applications include simple databases, &quot;choose your own adventure&quot;-type games, and educational teaching aids.

Due to its rapid application design facilities, HyperCard was also often used for prototyping applications and sometimes even for version 1.0 implementations. Inside Apple, the QuickTime team was one of HyperCard&#x27;s biggest customers.

HyperCard has lower hardware requirements than Macromedia Director. Several commercial software products were created in HyperCard, most notably the original version of the graphic adventure game &quot;Myst&quot;, the Voyager Company&#x27;s Expanded Books, multimedia CD-ROMs of Beethoven&#x27;s Ninth Symphony CD-ROM, &quot;A Hard Day&#x27;s Night&quot; by the Beatles, and the Voyager &quot;MacBeth&quot;. An early electronic edition of the &quot;Whole Earth Catalog&quot; was implemented in HyperCard. and stored on CD-ROM.

The prototype and demo of the popular game &quot;You Don&#x27;t Know Jack&quot; was written in HyperCard. The French auto manufacturer Renault used it to control their inventory system.

In Quebec, Canada, HyperCard was used to control a robot arm used to insert and retrieve video disks at the National Film Board CinéRobothèque.

In 1989, Hypercard was used to control the BBC Radiophonic Workshop Studio Network, using a single Macintosh.

HyperCard was used to prototype a fully functional prototype of SIDOCI (one of the first experiments in the world to develop an integrated electronic patient record system) and was heavily used by Montréal Consulting firm DMR to demonstrate what &quot;a typical day in the life of a patient about to get surgery&quot; would look like in a paperless age.

Activision, which was until then mainly a game company, saw HyperCard as an entry point into the business market. Changing its name to Mediagenic, it published several major HyperCard-based applications, most notably Danny Goodman&#x27;s Focal Point, a personal information manager, and Reports For HyperCard, a program by Nine To Five Software that allows users to treat HyperCard as a full database system with robust information viewing and printing features.

The HyperCard-inspired SuperCard for a while included the &quot;Roadster&quot; plug-in that allowed stacks to be placed inside web pages and viewed by web browsers with an appropriate browser plug-in. There was even a Windows version of this plug-in allowing computers other than Macintoshes to use the plug-in.

===Exploits===
The first HyperCard virus was discovered in Belgium and the Netherlands in April 1991.

Because HyperCard executed scripts in stacks immediately on opening, it was also one of the first applications susceptible to macro viruses. The Merryxmas virus was discovered in early 1993 by Ken Dunham, two years before the &quot;Concept&quot; virus. Very few viruses were based on HyperCard, and their overall impact was minimal.

==Reception==
&quot;Compute!&#x27;s Apple Applications&quot; in 1987 stated that HyperCard &quot;may make Macintosh the personal computer of choice&quot;. While noting that its large memory requirement made it best suited for computers with 2 MB of memory and hard drives, the magazine predicted that &quot;the smallest programming shop should be able to turn out stackware&quot;, especially for using CD-ROMs. &quot;Compute!&quot; predicted in 1988 that most future Mac software would be developed using HyperCard, if only because using it was so addictive that developers &quot;won&#x27;t be able to tear themselves away from it long enough to create anything else&quot;. &quot;Byte&quot; in 1989 listed it as among the &quot;Excellence&quot; winners of the Byte Awards. While stating that &quot;like any first entry, it has some flaws&quot;, the magazine wrote that &quot;HyperCard opened up a new category of software&quot;, and praised Apple for bundling it with every Mac. In 2001 Steve Wozniak called HyperCard &quot;the best program ever written&quot;.

==Legacy==
HyperCard is one of the first products that made use of and popularized the hypertext concept to a large popular base of users.

Jakob Nielsen has pointed out that HyperCard was really only a hypermedia program since its links started from regions on a card, not text objects; actual HTML-style text hyperlinks were possible in later versions, but were awkward to implement and seldom used. Deena Larsen programmed links into HyperCard for Marble Springs. Bill Atkinson later lamented that if he had only realized the power of network-oriented stacks, instead of focusing on local stacks on a single machine, HyperCard could have become the first Web browser.

HyperCard saw a loss in popularity with the growth of the World Wide Web, since the Web could handle and deliver data in much the same way as HyperCard without being limited to files on a local hard disk. HyperCard had a significant impact on the web as it inspired the creation of both HTTP (through its influence on Tim Berners-Lee&#x27;s colleague Robert Cailliau), and JavaScript (whose creator, Brendan Eich, was inspired by HyperTalk). It was also a key inspiration for ViolaWWW, an early web browser.

The pointing-finger cursor used for navigating stacks was later used in the first web browsers, as the hyperlink cursor.

The &quot;Myst&quot; computer game franchise, initially released as a HyperCard stack and included bundled with some Macs (for example the Performa 5300), still lives on, making HyperCard a facilitating technology for starting one of the best-selling computer games of all time.

According to Ward Cunningham, the inventor of Wiki, the wiki concept can be traced back to a HyperCard stack he wrote in the late 1980s.

In 2017 the Internet Archive established a project to preserve and emulate HyperCard stacks, allowing users to upload their own.

The GUI of the prototype Apple Wizzy Active Lifestyle Telephone was based on HyperCard.

===World Wide Web===
HyperCard influenced the development of the Web in late 1990 through its influence on Robert Cailliau, who assisted in developing Tim Berners-Lee&#x27;s first Web browser. Javascript was inspired by HyperTalk.

Although HyperCard stacks do not operate over the Internet, by 1988, at least 300 stacks were publicly available for download from the commercial CompuServe network (which was not connected to the official Internet yet). The system can link phone numbers on a user&#x27;s computer together and enable them to dial numbers without a modem, using a less expensive piece of hardware, the Hyperdialer.

In this sense, like the Web, it does form an association-based experience of information browsing via links, though not operating remotely over the TCP/IP protocol then. Like the Web, it also allows for the connections of many different kinds of media.

===Similar systems===
Other companies have offered their own versions. , two products are available which offer HyperCard-like abilities:
* HyperStudio, one of the first HyperCard clones, is , developed and published by Software MacKiev.
* LiveCode, published by LiveCode, Ltd., expands greatly on HyperCard&#x27;s feature set and offers color and a GUI toolkit which can be deployed on many popular platforms (Android, iOS, Classic Macintosh system software, Mac OS X, Windows 98 through 10, and Linux/Unix). LiveCode directly imports extant HyperCard stacks and provides a migration path for stacks still in use.

Past products include:
* SuperCard, the first HyperCard clone, was similar to HyperCard, but with many added features such as: full color support, pixel and vector graphics, a full GUI toolkit, and support for many modern macOS features. It could create both standalone applications and projects that run on the freeware SuperCard Player. SuperCard could also convert extant HyperCard stacks into SuperCard projects. It ran only on Macs.
* SK8 was a &quot;HyperCard killer&quot; developed within Apple but never released. It extends HyperTalk to allow arbitrary objects which allowed it to build complete Mac-like applications (instead of stacks). The project was never released, although the source code was placed in the public domain.
* Hyper DA by Symmetry was a Desk Accessory for classic single-tasked Mac OS that allows viewing HyperCard 1.x stacks as added windows in any extant application, and is also embedded into many Claris products (like MacDraw II) to display their user documentation.
* HyperPad from Brightbill-Roberts was a clone of HyperCard, written for DOS. It makes use of ASCII linedrawing to create the graphics of cards and buttons.
* Plus, later renamed WinPlus, was similar to HyperCard, for Windows and Macintosh.
* Oracle purchased Plus and created a cross-platform version as Oracle Card, later renamed Oracle Media Objects, used as a 4GL for database access.
* IBM LinkWay was a mouse-controlled HyperCard-like environment for DOS PCs. It has minimal system requirements, runs in graphics CGA and VGA. It even supported video disc control.
* Asymetrix&#x27;s Windows application ToolBook resembled HyperCard, and later included an external converter to read HyperCard stacks (the first was a third-party product from Heizer software).
* TileStack was an attempt to create a web based version of HyperCard that is compatible with the original HyperCard files. The site closed down January 24, 2011.

In addition, many of the basic concepts of the original system were later re-used in other forms. Apple built its system-wide scripting engine AppleScript on a language similar to HyperTalk; it is often used for desktop publishing (DTP) workflow automation needs. In the 1990s FaceSpan provided a third-party graphical interface. AppleScript also has a native graphical programming front-end called Automator, released with Mac OS X Tiger in April 2005. One of HyperCard&#x27;s strengths was its handling of multimedia, and many multimedia systems like Macromedia Authorware and Macromedia Director are based on concepts originating in HyperCard.

AppWare, originally named Serius Developer, is sometimes seen to be similar to HyperCard, as both are rapid application development (RAD) systems. AppWare was sold in the early 90s and worked on both Mac and Windows systems.

Zoomracks, a DOS application with a similar &quot;stack&quot; database metaphor, predates HyperCard by 4 years, which led to a contentious lawsuit against Apple.

<text>Histology,
also known as microscopic anatomy or microanatomy, is the branch of biology that studies the microscopic anatomy of biological tissues. Histology is the microscopic counterpart to gross anatomy, which looks at larger structures visible without a microscope. Although one may divide microscopic anatomy into &quot;organology&quot;, the study of organs, &quot;histology&quot;, the study of tissues, and &quot;cytology&quot;, the study of cells, modern usage places all of these topics under the field of histology. In medicine, histopathology is the branch of histology that includes the microscopic identification and study of diseased tissue. In the field of paleontology, the term paleohistology refers to the histology of fossil organisms.
==Biological tissues==

===Animal tissue classification ===
There are four basic types of animal tissues: muscle tissue, nervous tissue, connective tissue, and epithelial tissue. All animal tissues are considered to be subtypes of these four principal tissue types (for example, blood is classified as connective tissue, since the blood cells are suspended in an extracellular matrix, the plasma).
===Plant tissue classification===
For plants, the study of their tissues falls under the field of plant anatomy, with the following four main types:
* Dermal tissue
* Vascular tissue
* Ground tissue
* Meristematic tissue

==Medical histology==

Histopathology is the branch of histology that includes the microscopic identification and study of diseased tissue. It is an important part of anatomical pathology and surgical pathology, as accurate diagnosis of cancer and other diseases often requires histopathological examination of tissue samples. Trained physicians, frequently licensed pathologists, perform histopathological examination and provide diagnostic information based on their observations.

===Occupations===
The field of histology that includes the preparation of tissues for microscopic examination is known as histotechnology. Job titles for the trained personnel who prepare histological specimens for examination are numerous and include histotechnicians, histotechnologists, histology technicians and technologists, medical laboratory technicians, and biomedical scientists.

==Sample preparation==

Most histological samples need preparation before microscopic observation; these methods depend on the specimen and method of observation.

===Fixation ===

Chemical fixatives are used to preserve and maintain the structure of tissues and cells; fixation also hardens tissues which aids in cutting the thin sections of tissue needed for observation under the microscope. Fixatives generally preserve tissues (and cells) by irreversibly cross-linking proteins. The most widely used fixative for light microscopy is 10% neutral buffered formalin, or NBF (4% formaldehyde in phosphate buffered saline).

For electron microscopy, the most commonly used fixative is glutaraldehyde, usually as a 2.5% solution in phosphate buffered saline. Other fixatives used for electron microscopy are osmium tetroxide or uranyl acetate.

The main action of these aldehyde fixatives is to cross-link amino groups in proteins through the formation of methylene bridges (-CH2-), in the case of formaldehyde, or by C5H10 cross-links in the case of glutaraldehyde. This process, while preserving the structural integrity of the cells and tissue can damage the biological functionality of proteins, particularly enzymes.

Formalin fixation leads to degradation of mRNA, miRNA, and DNA as well as denaturation and modification of proteins in tissues. However, extraction and analysis of nucleic acids and proteins from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues is possible using appropriate protocols.

===Selection and trimming===

&quot;Selection&quot; is the choice of relevant tissue in cases where it is not necessary to put the entire original tissue mass through further processing. The remainder may remain fixed in case it needs to be examined at a later time.

&quot;Trimming&quot; is the cutting of tissue samples in order to expose the relevant surfaces for later sectioning. It also creates tissue samples of appropriate size to fit into cassettes.

===Embedding===
Tissues are embedded in a harder medium both as a support and to allow the cutting of thin tissue slices. In general, water must first be removed from tissues (dehydration) and replaced with a medium that either solidifies directly, or with an intermediary fluid (clearing) that is miscible with the embedding media.

==== Paraffin wax ====
For light microscopy, paraffin wax is the most frequently used embedding material. Paraffin is immiscible with water, the main constituent of biological tissue, so it must first be removed in a series of dehydration steps. Samples are transferred through a series of progressively more concentrated ethanol baths, up to 100% ethanol to remove remaining traces of water. Dehydration is followed by a &quot;clearing agent&quot; (typically xylene although other environmental safe substitutes are in use) which removes the alcohol and is miscible with the wax, finally melted paraffin wax is added to replace the xylene and infiltrate the tissue. In most histology, or histopathology laboratories the dehydration, clearing, and wax infiltration are carried out in &quot;tissue processors&quot; which automate this process. Once infiltrated in paraffin, tissues are oriented in molds which are filled with wax; once positioned, the wax is cooled, solidifying the block and tissue.

==== Other materials ====

Paraffin wax does not always provide a sufficiently hard matrix for cutting very thin sections (which are especially important for electron microscopy). Paraffin wax may also be too soft in relation to the tissue, the heat of the melted wax may alter the tissue in undesirable ways, or the dehydrating or clearing chemicals may harm the tissue. Alternatives to paraffin wax include, epoxy, acrylic, agar, gelatin, celloidin, and other types of waxes.

In electron microscopy epoxy resins are the most commonly employed embedding media, but acrylic resins are also used, particularly where immunohistochemistry is required.

For tissues to be cut in a frozen state, tissues are placed in a water-based embedding medium. Pre-frozen tissues are placed into molds with the liquid embedding material, usually a water-based glycol, OCT, TBS, Cryogen, or resin, which is then frozen to form hardened blocks.

===Sectioning===

For light microscopy, a knife mounted in a microtome is used to cut tissue sections (typically between 5-15 micrometers thick) which are mounted on a glass microscope slide. For transmission electron microscopy (TEM), a diamond or glass knife mounted in an ultramicrotome is used to cut between 50 and 150 nanometer thick tissue sections.

A limited number of manufacturers are recognized for their production of microtomes, including vibrating microtomes commonly referred to as vibratomes, primarily for research and clinical studies. Additionally, Leica Biosystems is known for its production of products related to light microscopy in the context of research and clinical studies.

===Staining===
Biological tissue has little inherent contrast in either the light or electron microscope. Staining is employed to give both contrast to the tissue as well as highlighting particular features of interest. When the stain is used to target a specific chemical component of the tissue (and not the general structure), the term histochemistry is used.

====Light microscopy====

Hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E stain) is one of the most commonly used stains in histology to show the general structure of the tissue. Hematoxylin stains cell nuclei blue; eosin, an acidic dye, stains the cytoplasm and other tissues in different stains of pink.

In contrast to H&amp;E, which is used as a general stain, there are many techniques that more selectively stain cells, cellular components, and specific substances. A commonly performed histochemical technique that targets a specific chemical is the Perls&#x27; Prussian blue reaction, used to demonstrate iron deposits in diseases like hemochromatosis. The Nissl method for Nissl substance and Golgi&#x27;s method (and related silver stains) are useful in identifying neurons are other examples of more specific stains.

====Historadiography====

In historadiography, a slide (sometimes stained histochemically) is X-rayed. More commonly, autoradiography is used in visualizing the locations to which a radioactive substance has been transported within the body, such as cells in S phase (undergoing DNA replication) which incorporate tritiated thymidine, or sites to which radiolabeled nucleic acid probes bind in in situ hybridization. For autoradiography on a microscopic level, the slide is typically dipped into liquid nuclear tract emulsion, which dries to form the exposure film. Individual silver grains in the film are visualized with dark field microscopy.

====Immunohistochemistry====
Recently, antibodies have been used to specifically visualize proteins, carbohydrates, and lipids. This process is called immunohistochemistry, or when the stain is a fluorescent molecule, immunofluorescence. This technique has greatly increased the ability to identify categories of cells under a microscope. Other advanced techniques, such as nonradioactive &quot;in situ&quot; hybridization, can be combined with immunochemistry to identify specific DNA or RNA molecules with fluorescent probes or tags that can be used for immunofluorescence and enzyme-linked fluorescence amplification (especially alkaline phosphatase and tyramide signal amplification). Fluorescence microscopy and confocal microscopy are used to detect fluorescent signals with good intracellular detail.

====Electron microscopy====
For electron microscopy heavy metals are typically used to stain tissue sections. Uranyl acetate and lead citrate are commonly used to impart contrast to tissue in the electron microscope.

===Specialized techniques===

====Cryosectioning====
Similar to the frozen section procedure employed in medicine, cryosectioning is a method to rapidly freeze, cut, and mount sections of tissue for histology. The tissue is usually sectioned on a cryostat or freezing microtome. The frozen sections are mounted on a glass slide and may be stained to enhance the contrast between different tissues. Unfixed frozen sections can be used for studies requiring enzyme localization in tissues and cells. Tissue fixation is required for certain procedures such as antibody-linked immunofluorescence staining. Frozen sections are often prepared during surgical removal of tumors to allow rapid identification of tumor margins, as in Mohs surgery, or determination of tumor malignancy, when a tumor is discovered incidentally during surgery.

====Ultramicrotomy====

Ultramicrotomy is a method of preparing extremely thin sections for transmission electron microscope (TEM) analysis. Tissues are commonly embedded in epoxy or other plastic resin. Very thin sections (less than 0.1 micrometer in thickness) are cut using diamond or glass knives on an ultramicrotome.

===Artifacts===
Artifacts are structures or features in tissue that interfere with normal histological examination. Artifacts interfere with histology by changing the tissues appearance and hiding structures. Tissue processing artifacts can include pigments formed by fixatives, shrinkage, washing out of cellular components, color changes in different tissues types and alterations of the structures in the tissue. An example is mercury pigment left behind after using Zenker&#x27;s fixative to fix a section. Formalin fixation can also leave a brown to black pigment under acidic conditions.

==History==

In the 17th century the Italian Marcello Malpighi used microscopes to study tiny biological entities; some regard him as the founder of the fields of histology and microscopic pathology. Malpighi analyzed several parts of the organs of bats, frogs and other animals under the microscope. While studying the structure of the lung, Malpighi noticed its membranous alveoli and the hair-like connections between veins and arteries, which he named capillaries. His discovery established how the oxygen breathed in enters the blood stream and serves the body.

In the 19th century histology was an academic discipline in its own right. The French anatomist Xavier Bichat introduced the concept of tissue in anatomy in 1801, and the term &quot;histology&quot; (), coined to denote the &quot;study of tissues&quot;, first appeared in a book by Karl Meyer in 1819. Bichat described twenty-one human tissues, which can be subsumed under the four categories currently accepted by histologists. The usage of illustrations in histology, deemed as useless by Bichat, was promoted by Jean Cruveilhier.

In the early 1830s Purkynĕ invented a microtome with high precision.

During the 19th century many fixation techniques were developed by Adolph Hannover (solutions of chromates and chromic acid), Franz Schulze and Max Schultze (osmic acid), Alexander Butlerov (formaldehyde) and Benedikt Stilling (freezing).

Mounting techniques were developed by Rudolf Heidenhain (1824–1898), who introduced gum Arabic; Salomon Stricker (1834–1898), who advocated a mixture of wax and oil; and Andrew Pritchard (1804–1884) who, in 1832, used a gum/isinglass mixture. In the same year, Canada balsam appeared on the scene, and in 1869 Edwin Klebs (1834–1913) reported that he had for some years embedded his specimens in paraffin.

The 1906 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine was awarded to histologists Camillo Golgi and Santiago Ramon y Cajal. They had conflicting interpretations of the neural structure of the brain based on differing interpretations of the same images. Ramón y Cajal won the prize for his correct theory, and Golgi for the silver-staining technique that he invented to make it possible.

==Future directions==
===&quot;In vivo&quot; histology===
There is interest in developing techniques for &quot;in vivo&quot; histology (predominantly using MRI), which would enable doctors to non-invasively gather information about healthy and diseased tissues in living patients, rather than from fixed tissue samples.

<doc id="13574" wikidata="Q26825" url="?curid=13574" title="Herodotus">
<text>Herodotus (; BC) was a Greek historian and geographer from the Greek city of Halicarnassus (now Bodrum, Turkey), under Persian control in the 5th century BC, and a later citizen of Thurii in modern Calabria, Italy. He wrote the &quot;Histories&quot;, a detailed account of the Greco-Persian Wars among other subjects such as the rise of the Achaemenid Dynasty of Cyrus, and was the first writer to apply the scientific method to historical events. He has been described as &quot;The Father of History&quot;, a title conferred on him by the ancient Roman orator Cicero, and the &quot;Father of Lies&quot; by others.

The &quot;Histories&quot; primarily cover the lives of prominent kings and famous battles such as Marathon, Thermopylae, Artemisium, Salamis, Plataea, and Mycale. His work deviates from the main topics to provide a cultural, ethnographical, geographical, and historiographical background that forms an essential part of the narrative and provides readers with a wellspring of additional information. 

Herodotus was criticized in his times for his inclusion of &quot;legends and fanciful accounts&quot; in his work. The contemporaneous historian Thucydides who covered the infamous Peloponnesian War in his &quot;History of the Peloponnesian War&quot; would separately accuse Herodotus of making up stories for entertainment. Herodotus retorted that he reported what he could see and what he was told. A sizable portion of the &quot;Histories&quot; has since been confirmed by modern historians and archaeologists.

==Life==
Current scholars generally turn to Herodotus&#x27;s own writing for reliable information about his life, supplemented with archaic yet much later sources, such as the Byzantine &quot;Suda&quot;, a 10th-century encyclopedia which possibly took its information from traditional accounts. Still, the challenge is great:

===Childhood===
Herodotus was, according to his own statement, at the beginning of his work, a native of Halicarnassus in Anatolia, and it is generally accepted that he was born there around 485 BC. The &quot;Suda&quot; says his family was influential, that he was the son of Lyxes and Dryo and the brother of Theodorus, and that he was also related to Panyassis – an epic poet of the time.

Halicarnassus was then within the Persian Empire, making Herodotus a Persian subject, and it may be that the young Herodotus heard local eyewitness accounts of events within the empire and of Persian preparations for the invasion of Greece, including the movements of the local fleet under the command of Artemisia I of Caria.

Inscriptions recently discovered at Halicarnassus indicate that Artemesia&#x27;s grandson Lygdamis negotiated with a local assembly to settle disputes over seized property, which is consistent with a tyrant under pressure. His name is not mentioned later in the tribute list of the Athenian Delian League, indicating that there might well have been a successful uprising against him some time before 454 BC.

Herodotus wrote his &quot;Histories&quot; in the Ionian dialect, in spite of being born in a Dorian settlement. According to the &quot;Suda&quot;, Herodotus learned the Ionian dialect as a boy living on the island of Samos, to which he had fled with his family from the oppressions of Lygdamis, tyrant of Halicarnassus and grandson of Artemisia. Panyassis, the epic poet related to Herodotus, is reported to have taken part in a failed uprising.

The &quot;Suda&quot; also states that Herodotus later returned home to lead the revolt that eventually overthrew the despot. Due to recent discoveries of inscriptions at Halicarnassus dated to about Herodotus&#x27;s time, it is now known that Ionic Greek was used in Halicarnassus in some official documents, so there is no need to assume (like the &quot;Suda&quot;) that he must have learned the dialect elsewhere. The &quot;Suda&quot; is the only source placing Herodotus as the heroic liberator of his birthplace, casting doubt upon the veracity of that romantic account.

===Early travels===
As Herodotus himself reveals, Halicarnassus, though a Dorian city, had ended its close relations with its Dorian neighbors after an unseemly quarrel (I,144), and it had helped pioneer Greek trade with Egypt (II, 178). It was, therefore, an outward-looking, international-minded port within the Persian Empire, and the historian&#x27;s family could well have had contacts in other countries under Persian rule, facilitating his travels and his researches.

Herodotus&#x27;s eyewitness accounts indicate that he traveled in Egypt in association with Athenians, probably sometime after 454 BC or possibly earlier, after an Athenian fleet had assisted the uprising against Persian rule in 460–454 BC. He probably traveled to Tyre next and then down the Euphrates to Babylon. For some reason, possibly associated with local politics, he subsequently found himself unpopular in Halicarnassus, and sometime around 447 BC, migrated to Periclean Athens – a city whose people and democratic institutions he openly admired (V, 78). Athens was also the place where he came to know the local topography (VI, 137; VIII, 52–55), and leading citizens such as the Alcmaeonids, a clan whose history is featured frequently in his writing.

According to Plutarch, Herodotus was granted a financial reward by the Athenian assembly in recognition of his work. Plutarch, using Diyllus as a source, says this was 10 talents.

===Later life===
In 443 BC or shortly afterwards, he migrated to Thurii, in modern Calabria, as part of an Athenian-sponsored colony. Aristotle refers to a version of the &quot;Histories&quot; written by &quot;Herodotus of Thurium&quot;, and some passages in the &quot;Histories&quot; have been interpreted as proof that he wrote about Magna Graecia from personal experience there (IV, 15,99; VI, 127). According to Ptolemaeus Chennus, a late source summarized in the Library of Photius, Plesirrhous the Thessalian, the hymnographer, was the eromenos of Herodotus and his heir. This account has also led some historians to assume Herodotus died childless. Intimate knowledge of some events in the first years of the Peloponnesian War (VI, 91; VII, 133, 233; IX, 73) suggests that he returned to Athens, in which case it is possible that he died there during an outbreak of the plague. It is also possible he died in Macedonia instead, after obtaining the patronage of the court there; or else he died back in Thurii. There is nothing in the &quot;Histories&quot; that can be dated to later than 430 BC with any certainty, and it is generally assumed that he died not long afterwards, possibly before his sixtieth year.

===Author and orator===
Herodotus would have made his researches known to the larger world through oral recitations to a public crowd. John Marincola writes in his introduction to the Penguin edition of the &quot;Histories&quot; that there are certain identifiable pieces in the early books of Herodotus&#x27;s work which could be labeled as &quot;performance pieces&quot;. These portions of the research seem independent and &quot;almost detachable&quot;, so that they might have been set aside by the author for the purposes of an oral performance. The intellectual matrix of the 5th century, Marincola suggests, comprised many oral performances in which philosophers would dramatically recite such detachable pieces of their work. The idea was to criticize previous arguments on a topic and emphatically and enthusiastically insert their own in order to win over the audience.

It was conventional in Herodotus&#x27;s day for authors to &quot;publish&quot; their works by reciting them at popular festivals. According to Lucian, Herodotus took his finished work straight from Anatolia to the Olympic Games and read the entire &quot;Histories&quot; to the assembled spectators in one sitting, receiving rapturous applause at the end of it. According to a very different account by an ancient grammarian, Herodotus refused to begin reading his work at the festival of Olympia until some clouds offered him a bit of shade – by which time the assembly had dispersed. (Hence the proverbial expression &quot;Herodotus and his shade&quot; to describe someone who misses an opportunity through delay.) Herodotus&#x27;s recitation at Olympia was a favourite theme among ancient writers, and there is another interesting variation on the story to be found in the &quot;Suda&quot;: that of Photius and Tzetzes, in which a young Thucydides happened to be in the assembly with his father, and burst into tears during the recital. Herodotus observed prophetically to the boy&#x27;s father: &quot;Your son&#x27;s soul yearns for knowledge.&quot;

Eventually, Thucydides and Herodotus became close enough for both to be interred in Thucydides&#x27;s tomb in Athens. Such at least was the opinion of Marcellinus in his &quot;Life of Thucydides&quot;. According to the &quot;Suda&quot;, he was buried in Macedonian Pella and in the agora in Thurii.

==Place in history==

Herodotus announced the purpose and scope of his work at the beginning of his &quot;Histories:&quot;

===Predecessors===
His record of the achievements of others was an achievement in itself, though the extent of it has been debated. Herodotus&#x27;s place in history and his significance may be understood according to the traditions within which he worked. His work is the earliest Greek prose to have survived intact. Dionysius of Halicarnassus, a literary critic of Augustan Rome, listed seven predecessors of Herodotus, describing their works as simple unadorned accounts of their own and other cities and people, Greek or foreign, including popular legends, sometimes melodramatic and naïve, often charming – all traits that can be found in the work of Herodotus himself.

Modern historians regard the chronology as uncertain, but according to the ancient account, these predecessors included Dionysius of Miletus, Charon of Lampsacus, Hellanicus of Lesbos, Xanthus of Lydia and, the best attested of them all, Hecataeus of Miletus. Of these, only fragments of Hecataeus&#x27;s works survived, and the authenticity of these is debatable, but they provide a glimpse into the kind of tradition within which Herodotus wrote his own &quot;Histories&quot;.

===Contemporary and modern critics===

It is on account of the many strange stories and the folk-tales he reported that his critics have branded him &quot;The Father of Lies&quot;. Even his own contemporaries found reason to scoff at his achievement. In fact, one modern scholar has wondered whether Herodotus left his home in Greek Anatolia, migrating westwards to Athens and beyond, because his own countrymen had ridiculed his work, a circumstance possibly hinted at in an epitaph said to have been dedicated to Herodotus at one of his three supposed resting places, Thuria:
Yet it was in Athens where his most formidable contemporary critics could be found. In 425 BC, which is about the time that Herodotus is thought by many scholars to have died, the Athenian comic dramatist Aristophanes created &quot;The Acharnians&quot;, in which he blames the Peloponnesian War on the abduction of some prostitutes – a mocking reference to Herodotus, who reported the Persians&#x27; account of their wars with Greece, beginning with the rapes of the mythical heroines Io, Europa, Medea, and Helen.

Similarly, the Athenian historian Thucydides dismissed Herodotus as a story-teller. Thucydides, who had been trained in rhetoric, became the model for subsequent prose-writers as an author who seeks to appear firmly in control of his material, whereas with his frequent digressions Herodotus appeared to minimize (or possibly disguise) his authorial control. Moreover, Thucydides developed a historical topic more in keeping with the Greek world-view: focused on the context of the &quot;polis&quot; or city-state. The interplay of civilizations was more relevant to Greeks living in Anatolia, such as Herodotus himself, for whom life within a foreign civilization was a recent memory.
Though Herodotus is generally considered a reliable source of ancient history, many present-day historians believe that his accounts are at least partially inaccurate, attributing the observed inconsistencies in the &quot;Histories&quot; to exaggeration.
