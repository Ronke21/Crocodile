<text>British cinema has significantly influenced the global film industry since the 19th century.

The oldest known surviving film in the world, &quot;Roundhay Garden Scene&quot; (1888), was shot in England by French inventor Louis Le Prince. Early colour films were also pioneered in the UK. Film production reached an all-time high in 1936, but the &quot;golden age&quot; of British cinema is usually thought to have occurred in the 1940s, which saw the release of the most critically acclaimed works by filmmakers such as David Lean, Michael Powell, and Carol Reed.

Many British actors have accrued critical success and worldwide recognition, including Patrick Stewart, Julie Andrews, Michael Caine, Joan Collins, Sean Connery, Benedict Cumberbatch, Daniel Craig, Daniel Day-Lewis, Judi Dench, Olivia de Havilland, Audrey Hepburn, Anthony Hopkins, Glynis Johns, Vivien Leigh, Ian Mckellen, Peter O&#x27;Toole, Gary Oldman, Laurence Olivier, Maggie Smith, Emma Thompson, and Kate Winslet. Some of the films with the largest ever box office profits have been made in the United Kingdom, including &quot;Harry Potter&quot; and &quot;James Bond&quot;, the fourth and fifth highest-grossing film franchises of all time.

The identity of British cinema, particularly in relation to the cinema of the United States, has been the subject of debate. Its history has often been affected by its attempts to compete with the United States; the career of producer Alexander Korda was marked by this objective, which the Rank Organisation also attempted to do in the 1940s, as well as Goldcrest in the 1980s. British filmmakers such as Alfred Hitchcock, Christopher Nolan, and Ridley Scott achieved success primarily through their work in the United States, as did British performers such as Charlie Chaplin and Cary Grant.

In 2009, British films grossed around $2 billion worldwide and achieved a market share of around 7% globally and 17% in the United Kingdom. UK box office earnings totalled £1.1 billion in 2012, with 172.5 million admissions. The British Film Institute has produced a poll ranking what it considers to be the 100 greatest British films of all time. The annual BAFTA Awards hosted by the British Academy of Film and Television Arts are considered to be the British equivalent of the Academy Awards.

==History==

===Origins and silent films===
The world&#x27;s first moving picture was shot in Leeds by Louis Le Prince in 1888 and the first moving pictures developed on celluloid film were made in Hyde Park, London in 1889 by British inventor William Friese Greene, who patented the process in 1890.
The first people to build and run a working 35 mm camera in Britain were Robert W. Paul and Birt Acres. They made the first British film &quot;Incident at Clovelly Cottage&quot; in February 1895, shortly before falling out over the camera&#x27;s patent. Soon several British film companies had opened to meet the demand for new films, such as Mitchell and Kenyon in Blackburn. The Lumière brothers first brought their show to London in 1896. In 1898, American producer Charles Urban expanded the London-based Warwick Trading Company to produce British films, mostly documentary and news.

Although the earliest British films were of everyday events, the early 20th century saw the appearance of narrative shorts, mainly comedies and melodramas. The early films were often melodramatic in tone, and there was a distinct preference for story lines already known to the audience, in particular, adaptations of Shakespeare plays and Dickens novels.

In 1898, Gaumont-British Picture Corp. was founded as a subsidiary of the French Gaumont Film Company, constructing Lime Grove Studios in West London in 1915 in the first building built in Britain solely for film production. Also in 1898, Hepworth Studios was founded in Lambeth, South London by Cecil Hepworth, the Bamforths began producing films in Yorkshire, and William Haggar began producing films in Wales.

Directed by Walter R. Booth in 1901, &quot;Scrooge, or, Marley&#x27;s Ghost&quot; is the earliest film adaptation of Charles Dickens&#x27;s festive novella &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot;. Booth&#x27;s &quot;The Hand of the Artist&quot; (1906) has been described as the first British animated film.

In 1902, Ealing Studios was founded by Will Barker. It has become the oldest continuously operating film studio in the world.

In 1902, the earliest colour film in the world was made; capturing everyday events. In 2012, it was found by the National Science and Media Museum in Bradford after lying forgotten in an old tin for 110 years. The previous title for earliest colour film, using Urban&#x27;s inferior Kinemacolor process, was thought to date from 1909. The re-discovered films were made by pioneer Edward Raymond Turner from London who patented his process on 22 March 1899.
In 1909, Urban formed the Natural Color Kinematograph Company, which produced early colour films using his patented Kinemacolor process. This was later challenged in court by Greene, causing the company to go out of business in 1914.

In 1903, Cecil Hepworth and Percy Stow directed &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot;, the first film adaptation of Lewis Carroll&#x27;s children&#x27;s book &quot;Alice&#x27;s Adventures in Wonderland&quot;. Also in 1903, Frank Mottershaw of Sheffield produced the film &quot;A Daring Daylight Robbery&quot;, which launched the chase genre.

In 1911, the Ideal Film Company was founded in Soho, London, distributing almost 400 films by 1934, and producing 80.

In 1913, stage director Maurice Elvey began directing British films, becoming Britain&#x27;s most prolific film director, with almost 200 by 1957.

In 1914, Elstree Studios was founded, and acquired in 1928 by German-born Ludwig Blattner, who invented a magnetic steel tape recording system that was adopted by the BBC in 1930.

In 1915, the Kinematograph Renters’ Society of Great Britain and Ireland was formed to represent the film distribution companies. It is the oldest film trade body in the world. It was known as the Society of Film Distributors until it changed its name again to the Film Distributors’ Association (FDA).

In 1920, Gaumont opened Islington Studios, where Alfred Hitchcock got his start, selling out to Gainsborough Pictures in 1927. Also in 1920 Cricklewood Studios was founded by Sir Oswald Stoll, becoming Britain&#x27;s largest film studio, known for Fu Manchu and Sherlock Holmes film series.

In 1920, the short-lived company Minerva Films was founded in London by the actor Leslie Howard (also producer and director) and his friend and story editor Adrian Brunel. Some of their early films include four written by A. A. Milne including &quot;The Bump&quot;, starring C. Aubrey Smith; &quot;Twice Two&quot;; &quot;Five Pound Reward&quot;; and &quot;Bookworms&quot;.

By the mid-1920s the British film industry was losing out to heavy competition from the United States, which was helped by its much larger home market – in 1914 25% of films shown in the UK were British, but by 1926 this had fallen to 5%. A slump in 1924 caused many British film studios to close, resulting in the passage of the Cinematograph Films Act 1927 to boost local production, requiring that cinemas show a certain percentage of British films. The act was technically a success, with audiences for British films becoming larger than the quota required, but it had the effect of creating a market for poor quality, low cost films, made to satisfy the quota. The &quot;quota quickies&quot;, as they became known, are often blamed by historians for holding back the development of the industry. However, some British film makers, such as Michael Powell, learnt their craft making such films. The act was modified with the Cinematograph Films Act 1938 assisted the British film industry by specifying only films made by and shot in Great Britain would be included in the quota, an act that severely reduced Canadian and Australian film production.

The biggest star of the silent era, English comedian Charlie Chaplin, was Hollywood-based.

===The early sound period===
Scottish solicitor John Maxwell founded British International Pictures (BIP) in 1927. Based at the former British National Pictures Studios in Elstree, the facilities original owners, including producer-director Herbert Wilcox, had run into financial difficulties. One of the company&#x27;s early films, Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s &quot;Blackmail&quot; (1929), is often regarded as the first British sound feature. It was a part-talkie with a synchronised score and sound effects. Earlier in 1929, the first all-talking British feature, &quot;The Clue of the New Pin&quot; was released. It was based on a novel by Edgar Wallace, starring Donald Calthrop, Benita Home and Fred Raines, which was made by British Lion at their Beaconsfield Studios. John Maxwell&#x27;s BIP became the Associated British Picture Corporation (ABPC) in 1933. ABPC&#x27;s studios in Elstree came to be known as the &quot;porridge factory&quot;, according to Lou Alexander, &quot;for reasons more likely to do with the quantity of films that the company turned out, than their quality&quot;. Elstree (strictly speaking almost all the studios were in neighbouring Borehamwood) became the centre of the British film industry, with six film complexes over the years all in close proximity to each other.

By 1927, the largest cinema chains in the United Kingdom consisted of around 20 cinemas but the following year Gaumont-British expanded significantly to become the largest, controlling 180 cinemas by 1928 and up to 300 by 1929. Maxwell formed ABC Cinemas in 1927 which became a subsidiary of BIP and went on to become one of the largest in the country, together with Odeon Cinemas, founded by Oscar Deutsch, who opened his first cinema in 1928. By 1937, these three chains controlled almost a quarter of all cinemas in the country. A booking by one of these chains was indispensable for the success of any British film.

With the advent of sound films, many foreign actors were in less demand, with English received pronunciation commonly used; for example, the voice of Czech actress Anny Ondra in &quot;Blackmail&quot; was substituted by an off-camera Joan Barry during Ondra&#x27;s scenes.

Starting with John Grierson&#x27;s &quot;Drifters&quot; (also 1929), the period saw the emergence of the school of realist Documentary Film Movement, from 1933 associated with the GPO Film Unit. It was Grierson who coined the term &quot;documentary&quot; to describe a non-fiction film, and he produced the movement&#x27;s most celebrated early films, &quot;Night Mail&quot; (1936), written and directed by Basil Wright and Harry Watt, and incorporating the poem by W. H. Auden towards the end of the short.

Music halls also proved influential in comedy films of this period, and a number of popular personalities emerged, including George Formby, Gracie Fields, Jessie Matthews and Will Hay. These stars often made several films a year, and their productions remained important for morale purposes during World War II.
Many of the British films with larger budgets during the 1930s were produced by London Films, founded by Hungarian &quot;emigre&quot; Alexander Korda. The success of &quot;The Private Life of Henry VIII&quot; (1933), made at British and Dominions Elstree Studios, persuaded United Artists and The Prudential to invest in Korda&#x27;s Denham Film Studios, which opened in May 1936, but both investors suffered losses as a result. Korda&#x27;s films before the war included &quot;Things to Come&quot;, &quot;Rembrandt&quot; (both 1936) and &quot;Knight Without Armour&quot; (1937), as well as the early Technicolour films &quot;The Drum&quot; (1938) and &quot;The Four Feathers&quot; (1939). These had followed closely on from &quot;Wings of the Morning&quot; (1937), the UK&#x27;s first three-strip Technicolour feature film, made by the local offshoot of 20th Century Fox. Although some of Korda&#x27;s films indulged in &quot;unrelenting pro-Empire flag waving&quot;, those featuring Sabu turned him into &quot;a huge international star&quot;; &quot;for many years&quot; he had the highest profile of any actor of Indian origin. Paul Robeson was also cast in leading roles when &quot;there were hardly any opportunities&quot; for African Americans &quot;to play challenging roles&quot; in their own country&#x27;s productions.

In 1933, the British Film Institute was established as the lead organisation for film in the UK. They set up the National Film Library in 1935 (now known as the BFI National Archive), with Ernest Lindgren as its curator.

In 1934, J. Arthur Rank became a co-founder of British National Films Company and they helped create Pinewood Studios, which opened in 1936. Also in 1936, Rank took over General Film Distributors and in 1937, Rank founded The Rank Organisation. In 1938, General Film Distributors became affiliated with Odeon Cinemas.
Rising expenditure and over-optimistic expectations of expansion into the American market caused a financial crisis in 1937, after an all-time high of 192 films were released in 1936. Of the 640 British production companies registered between 1925 and 1936, only 20 were still active in 1937. Moreover, the 1927 Films Act was up for renewal. The replacement Cinematograph Films Act 1938 provided incentives, via a &quot;quality test&quot;, for UK companies to make fewer films, but of higher quality, and to eliminate the &quot;quota quickies&quot;. Influenced by world politics, it encouraged American investment and imports. One result was the creation of MGM-British, an English subsidiary of the largest American studio, which produced four films before the war, including &quot;Goodbye, Mr. Chips&quot; (1939).

The new venture was initially based at Denham Studios. Korda himself lost control of the facility in 1939 to the Rank Organisation. Circumstances forced Korda&#x27;s &quot;The Thief of Bagdad&quot; (1940), a spectacular fantasy film, to be completed in California, where Korda continued his film career during the war.

By now contracted to Gaumont British, Alfred Hitchcock had settled on the thriller genre by the mid-1930s with &quot;The Man Who Knew Too Much&quot; (1934), &quot;The 39 Steps&quot; (1935) and &quot;The Lady Vanishes&quot; (1938). Lauded in Britain where he was dubbed &quot;Alfred the Great&quot; by &quot;Picturegoer&quot; magazine, Hitchcock&#x27;s reputation was beginning to develop overseas, with a &quot;New York Times&quot; feature writer asserting; &quot;Three unique and valuable institutions the British have that we in America have not. Magna Carta, the Tower Bridge and Alfred Hitchcock, the greatest director of screen melodramas in the world.&quot; Hitchcock was then signed up to a seven-year contract by Selznick and moved to Hollywood.

===Second World War===
Published in &quot;The Times&quot; on 5 September 1939, two days after Britain declared war on Germany, George Bernard Shaw’s letter protested against a government order to close all places of entertainment, including cinemas. ‘What agent of Chancellor Hitler is it who has suggested that we should all cower in darkness and terror “for the duration”?’. Within two weeks of the order cinemas in the provinces were reopened, followed by central London within a month. In 1940, cinema admissions figures rose, to just over 1 billion for the year, and they continued rising to over 1.5 billion in 1943, 1944 and 1945.

Humphrey Jennings began his career as a documentary film maker just before the war, in some cases working in collaboration with co-directors. &quot;London Can Take It&quot; (with Harry Wat, 1940) detailed the Blitz while &quot;Listen to Britain&quot; (with Stewart McAllister, 1942) looked at the home front. The Crown Film Unit, part of the Ministry of Information took over the responsibilities of the GPO Film Unit in 1940. Paul Rotha and Alberto Cavalcanti were colleagues of Jennings. British films began to make use of documentary techniques; Cavalcanti joined Ealing for &quot;Went the Day Well?&quot; (1942),

Many other films helped to shape the popular image of the nation at war. Among the best known of these films are &quot;In Which We Serve&quot; (1942), &quot;We Dive at Dawn&quot; (1943), &quot;Millions Like Us&quot; (1943) and &quot;The Way Ahead&quot; (1944). The war years also saw the emergence of The Archers partnership between director Michael Powell and the Hungarian-born writer-producer Emeric Pressburger with films such as &quot;The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp&quot; (1943) and &quot;A Canterbury Tale&quot; (1944).

Two Cities Films, an independent production company releasing their films through a Rank subsidiary, also made some important films, including the Noël Coward and David Lean collaborations &quot;This Happy Breed&quot; (1944) and &quot;Blithe Spirit&quot; (1945) as well as Laurence Olivier&#x27;s &quot;Henry V&quot; (1944). By this time, Gainsborough Studios were releasing their series of critically derided but immensely popular period melodramas, including &quot;The Man in Grey&quot; (1943) and &quot;The Wicked Lady&quot; (1945). New stars, such as Margaret Lockwood and James Mason, emerged in the Gainsborough films.

===Post-war cinema===
Towards the end of the 1940s, the Rank Organisation became the dominant force behind British film-making, having acquired a number of British studios and the Gaumont chain (in 1941) to add to its Odeon Cinemas. Rank&#x27;s serious financial crisis in 1949, a substantial loss and debt, resulted in the contraction of its film production. In practice, Rank maintained an industry duopoly with ABPC (later absorbed by EMI) for many years.
For the moment, the industry hit new heights of creativity in the immediate post-war years. Among the most significant films produced during this period were David Lean&#x27;s &quot;Brief Encounter&quot; (1945) and his Dickens adaptations &quot;Great Expectations&quot; (1946) and &quot;Oliver Twist&quot; (1948), Ken Annakin&#x27;s comedy &quot;Miranda&quot; (1948) starring Glynis Johns, Carol Reed&#x27;s thrillers &quot;Odd Man Out&quot; (1947) and &quot;The Third Man&quot; (1949), and Powell and Pressburger&#x27;s &quot;A Matter of Life and Death&quot; (1946), &quot;Black Narcissus&quot; (1947) and &quot;The Red Shoes&quot; (1948), the most commercially successful film of its year in the United States. Laurence Olivier&#x27;s &quot;Hamlet&quot; (also 1948), was the first non-American film to win the Academy Award for Best Picture. Ealing Studios (financially backed by Rank) began to produce their most celebrated comedies, with three of the best remembered films, &quot;Whisky Galore&quot; (1948), &quot;Kind Hearts and Coronets&quot; and &quot;Passport to Pimlico&quot; (both 1949), being on release almost simultaneously. Their portmanteau horror film &quot;Dead of Night&quot; (1945) is also particularly highly regarded.

Under the Import Duties Act 1932, HM Treasury levied a 75% tariff on all film imports on 6 August 1947 which became known as Dalton Duty (after Hugh Dalton then the Chancellor of the Exchequer). The tax came into effect on 8 August, applying to all imported films, of which the overwhelming majority came from the United States; American film studio revenues from the UK had been in excess of US$68 million in 1946. The following day, 9 August, the Motion Picture Association of America announced that no further films would be supplied to British cinemas until further notice. The Dalton Duty was ended on 3 May 1948 with the American studios again exported films to the UK though the Marshall Plan prohibited US film companies from taking foreign exchange out of the nations their films played in.

Following the Cinematograph Film Production (Special Loans) Act 1949, the National Film Finance Corporation (NFFC) was established as a British film funding agency.

The Eady Levy, named after Sir Wilfred Eady was a tax on box office receipts in the United Kingdom in order to support the British Film industry. It was established in 1950 coming into effect in 1957. A direct governmental payment to British-based producers would have qualified as a subsidy under the terms of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, and would have led to objections from American film producers. An indirect levy did not qualify as a subsidy, and so was a suitable way of providing additional funding for the UK film industry whilst avoiding criticism from abroad.

In 1951, the National Film Theatre was initially opened in a temporary building at the Festival of Britain. It moved to its present location on the South Bank in London for the first London Film Festival on 16 October 1957 run by the BFI.
During the 1950s, the British industry began to concentrate on popular comedies and World War II dramas aimed more squarely at the domestic audience. The war films were often based on true stories and made in a similar low-key style to their wartime predecessors. They helped to make stars of actors like John Mills, Jack Hawkins and Kenneth More. Some of the most successful included &quot;The Cruel Sea&quot; (1953), &quot;The Dam Busters&quot; (1954), &quot;The Colditz Story&quot; (1955) and &quot;Reach for the Sky&quot; (1956).

The Rank Organisation produced some comedy successes, such as &quot;Genevieve&quot; (1953). The writer/director/producer team of twin brothers John and Roy Boulting also produced a series of successful satires on British life and institutions, beginning with &quot;Private&#x27;s Progress&quot; (1956), and continuing with (among others) &quot;Brothers in Law&quot; (1957), &quot;Carlton-Browne of the F.O.&quot; (1958), and &quot;I&#x27;m All Right Jack&quot; (1959). Starring in &quot;School for Scoundrels&quot; (1960), the British Film Institute thought Terry-Thomas was &quot;outstanding as a classic British &quot;.

Popular comedy series included the &quot;Doctor&quot; series, beginning with &quot;Doctor in the House&quot; (1954). The series originally starred Dirk Bogarde, probably the British industry&#x27;s most popular star of the 1950s, though later films had Michael Craig and Leslie Phillips in leading roles. The Carry On series began in 1958 with regular instalments appearing for the next twenty years. The Italian director-producer Mario Zampi also made a number of successful black comedies, including &quot;Laughter in Paradise&quot; (1951), &quot;The Naked Truth&quot; (1957) and &quot;Too Many Crooks&quot; (1958). Ealing Studios had continued its run of successful comedies, including &quot;The Lavender Hill Mob&quot; (1951) and &quot;The Ladykillers&quot; (1955), but the company ceased production in 1958, after the studios had already been bought by the BBC.
Less restrictive censorship towards the end of the 1950s encouraged film producer Hammer Films to embark on their series of commercially successful horror films. Beginning with adaptations of Nigel Kneale&#x27;s BBC science fiction serials &quot;The Quatermass Experiment&quot; (1955) and &quot;Quatermass II&quot; (1957), Hammer quickly graduated to &quot;The Curse of Frankenstein&quot; (1957) and &quot;Dracula&quot; (1958), both deceptively lavish and the first gothic horror films in colour. The studio turned out numerous sequels and variants, with English actors Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee being the most regular leads. &quot;Peeping Tom&quot; (1960), a now highly regarded thriller, with horror elements, set in the contemporary period, was badly received by the critics at the time, and effectively finished the career of Michael Powell, its director.

===Social realism===

The British New Wave film makers attempted to produce social realist films (see also &#x27;kitchen sink realism&#x27;) attempted in commercial feature films released between around 1959 and 1963 to convey narratives about a wider spectrum of people in Britain than the country&#x27;s earlier films had done. These individuals, principally Karel Reisz, Lindsay Anderson and Tony Richardson, were also involved in the short lived Oxford film journal &quot;Sequence&quot; and the &quot;Free Cinema&quot; documentary film movement. The 1956 statement of Free Cinema, the name was coined by Anderson, asserted: &quot;No film can be too personal. The image speaks. Sounds amplifies and comments. Size is irrelevant. Perfection is not an aim. An attitude means a style. A style means an attitude.&quot; Anderson, in particular, was dismissive of the commercial film industry. Their documentary films included Anderson&#x27;s &quot;Every Day Except Christmas&quot;, among several sponsored by Ford of Britain, and Richardson&#x27;s &quot;Momma Don&#x27;t Allow&quot;. Another member of this group, John Schlesinger, made documentaries for the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Monitor&quot; arts series.

Together with future James Bond co-producer Harry Saltzman, dramatist John Osborne and Tony Richardson established the company Woodfall Films to produce their early feature films. These included adaptations of Richardson&#x27;s stage productions of Osborne&#x27;s &quot;Look Back in Anger&quot; (1959), with Richard Burton, and &quot;The Entertainer&quot; (1960) with Laurence Olivier, both from Osborne&#x27;s own screenplays. Such films as Reisz&#x27;s &quot;Saturday Night and Sunday Morning&quot; (also 1960), Richardson&#x27;s &quot;A Taste of Honey&quot; (1961), Schlesinger&#x27;s &quot;A Kind of Loving&quot; (1962) and &quot;Billy Liar&quot; (1963), and Anderson&#x27;s &quot;This Sporting Life&quot; (1963) are often associated with a new openness about working-class life or previously taboo issues.

The team of Basil Dearden and Michael Relph, from an earlier generation, &quot;probe[d] into the social issues that now confronted social stability and the establishment of the promised peacetime consensus&quot;. &quot;Pool of London&quot; (1950). and &quot;Sapphire&quot; (1959) were early attempts to create narratives about racial tensions and an emerging multi-cultural Britain. Dearden and Relph&#x27;s &quot;Victim&quot; (1961), was about the blackmail of homosexuals. Influenced by the Wolfenden report of four years earlier, which advocated the decriminalising of homosexual sexual activity, this was &quot;the first British film to deal explicitly with homosexuality&quot;. Unlike the New Wave film makers though, critical responses to Dearden&#x27;s and Relph&#x27;s work have not generally been positive.

===The 1960s===

As the 1960s progressed, American studios returned to financially supporting British films, especially those that capitalised on the &quot;swinging London&quot; image propagated by &quot;Time&quot; magazine in 1966. Films like &quot;Darling&quot;, &quot;The Knack ...and How to Get It&quot; (both 1965), &quot;Alfie&quot; and &quot;Georgy Girl&quot; (both 1966), all explored this phenomenon. &quot;Blowup&quot; (also 1966), and later &quot;Women in Love&quot; (1969), showed female and then male full-frontal nudity on screen in mainstream British films for the first time.

At the same time, film producers Harry Saltzman and Albert R. Broccoli combined sex with exotic locations, casual violence and self-referential humour in the phenomenally successful James Bond series with Sean Connery in the leading role. The first film &quot;Dr. No&quot; (1962) was a sleeper hit in the UK and the second, &quot;From Russia with Love&quot; (1963), a hit worldwide. By the time of the third film, &quot;Goldfinger&quot; (1964), the series had become a global phenomenon, reaching its commercial peak with &quot;Thunderball&quot; the following year. The series&#x27; success led to a spy film boom with many Bond imitations. Bond co-producer Saltzman also instigated a rival series of more realistic spy films based on the novels of Len Deighton. Michael Caine starred as bespectacled spy Harry Palmer in &quot;The Ipcress File&quot; (1965), and two sequels in the next few years. Other more downbeat espionage films were adapted from John le Carré novels, such as &quot;The Spy Who Came In from the Cold&quot; (1965) and &quot;The Deadly Affair&quot; (1966).

American directors were regularly working in London throughout the decade, but several became permanent residents in the UK. Blacklisted in America, Joseph Losey had a significant influence on British cinema in the 1960s, particularly with his collaborations with playwright Harold Pinter and leading man Dirk Bogarde, including &quot;The Servant&quot; (1963) and &quot;Accident&quot; (1967). Voluntary exiles Richard Lester and Stanley Kubrick were also active in the UK. Lester had major hits with The Beatles film &quot;A Hard Day&#x27;s Night&quot; (1964) and &quot;The Knack ...and How to Get It&quot; (1965) and Kubrick with &quot;Dr. Strangelove&quot; (1963) and &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot; (1968). While Kubrick settled in Hertfordshire in the early 1960s and would remain in England for the rest of his career, these two films retained a strong American influence. Other films of this era involved prominent filmmakers from elsewhere in Europe, &quot;Repulsion&quot; (1965) and &quot;Blowup&quot; (1966) were the first English language films of the Polish director Roman Polanski and the Italian Michelangelo Antonioni respectively.

Historical films as diverse as &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot; (1962), &quot;Tom Jones&quot; (1963), and &quot;A Man for All Seasons&quot; (1966) benefited from the investment of American studios. Major films like &quot;Becket&quot; (1964), &quot;Khartoum&quot; (1966) and &quot;The Charge of the Light Brigade&quot; (1968) were regularly mounted, while smaller-scale films, including &quot;Accident&quot; (1967), were big critical successes. Four of the decade&#x27;s Academy Award winners for best picture were British productions, including six Oscars for the film musical &quot;Oliver!&quot; (1968), based on the Charles Dickens novel &quot;Oliver Twist&quot;.

After directing several contributions to the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Wednesday Play&quot; anthology series, Ken Loach began his feature film career with the social realist &quot;Poor Cow&quot; (1967) and &quot;Kes&quot; (1969). Meanwhile, the controversy around Peter Watkins &quot;The War Game&quot; (1965), which won the Best Documentary Film Oscar in 1967, but had been suppressed by the BBC who had commissioned it, would ultimately lead Watkins to work exclusively outside Britain.

===1970s===

American studios cut back on British productions, and in many cases withdrew from financing them altogether. Films financed by American interests were still being made, including Billy Wilder&#x27;s &quot;The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes&quot; (1970), but for a time funds became hard to come by.

More relaxed censorship also brought several controversial films, including Nicolas Roeg and Donald Cammell&#x27;s &quot;Performance&quot;, Ken Russell&#x27;s &quot;The Devils&quot; (1971), Sam Peckinpah&#x27;s &quot;Straw Dogs&quot; (1971), and Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot; (1971) starring Malcolm McDowell as the leader of a gang of thugs in a dystopian future Britain.

Other films during the early 1970s included the Edwardian drama &quot;The Go-Between&quot; (1971), which won the Palme d&#x27;Or at the Cannes Film Festival, Nicolas Roeg&#x27;s Venice-set supernatural thriller &quot;Don&#x27;t Look Now&quot; (1973) and Mike Hodges&#x27; gangster drama &quot;Get Carter&quot; (1971) starring Michael Caine. Alfred Hitchcock returned to Britain to shoot &quot;Frenzy&quot; (1972), Other productions such as Richard Attenborough&#x27;s &quot;Young Winston&quot; (1972) and &quot;A Bridge Too Far&quot; (1977) met with mixed commercial success. The British horror film cycle associated with Hammer Film Productions, Amicus and Tigon drew to a close, despite attempts by Hammer to spice up the formula with added nudity and gore. Although some attempts were made to broaden the range of British horror films, such as with &quot;The Wicker Man&quot; (1973), these films made little impact at the box office, In 1976, British Lion, who produced &quot;The Wicker Man&quot;, were finally absorbed into the film division of EMI, who had taken over ABPC in 1969. The duopoly in British cinema exhibition, via Rank and now EMI, continued.
In the early 1970s, the government reduced its funding of the National Film Finance Corporation so the NFFC started to operate as a consortium, including with banks, which led to them using more commercial criteria for funding British films rather than focusing on quality or new talent, moving to fund films based on TV shows such as &quot;Up Pompeii&quot; (1971).

Some other British producers, including Hammer, turned to television for inspiration, and big screen versions of popular sitcoms like &quot;On the Buses&quot; (1971) and &quot;Steptoe and Son&quot; (1972) proved successful with domestic audiences, the former had greater domestic box office returns in its year than the Bond film, &quot;Diamonds Are Forever&quot; and in 1973, an established British actor Roger Moore was cast as Bond in, &quot;Live and Let Die&quot;, it was a commercial success and Moore would continue the role for the next 12 years. Low-budget British sex comedies included the &quot;Confessions of ...&quot; series starring Robin Askwith, beginning with &quot;Confessions of a Window Cleaner&quot; (1974). More elevated comedy films came from the Monty Python team, also from television. Their two most successful films were &quot;Monty Python and the Holy Grail&quot; (1975) and &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Life of Brian&quot; (1979), the latter a major commercial success, probably at least in part due to the controversy at the time surrounding its subject.

Some American productions did return to the major British studios in 1977–79, including the original &quot;Star Wars&quot; (1977) at Elstree Studios, &quot;Superman&quot; (1978) at Pinewood, and &quot;Alien&quot; (1979) at Shepperton. Successful adaptations were made in the decade of the Agatha Christie novels &quot;Murder on the Orient Express&quot; (1974) and &quot;Death on the Nile&quot; (1978). The entry of Lew Grade&#x27;s company ITC into film production in the latter half of the decade brought only a few box office successes and an unsustainable number of failures

===1980s===

In 1980, only 31 British films were made, a 50% decline from the previous year and the lowest number since 1914, and production fell again in 1981 to 24 films. The industry suffered further blows from falling cinema attendances, which reached a record low of 54 million in 1984, and the elimination of the 1957 Eady Levy, a tax concession, in the same year. The concession had made it possible for an overseas based film company to write off a large amount of its production costs by filming in the UK – this was what attracted a succession of big-budget American productions to British studios in the 1970s. These factors led to significant changes in the industry, with the profitability of British films now &quot;increasingly reliant on secondary markets such as video and television, and Channel 4 ... [became] a crucial part of the funding equation.&quot;

With the removal of the levy, multiplex cinemas were introduced to the United Kingdom with the opening of a ten-screen cinema by AMC Cinemas at The Point in Milton Keynes in 1985 and the number of screens in the UK increased by around 500 over the decade leading to increased attendances of almost 100 million by the end of the decade.

The 1980s soon saw a renewed optimism, led by smaller independent production companies such as Goldcrest, HandMade Films and Merchant Ivory Productions.

Handmade Films, which was partly owned by George Harrison, was originally formed to take over the production of &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Life of Brian&quot;, after EMI&#x27;s Bernard Delfont (Lew Grade&#x27;s brother) had pulled out. Handmade also bought and released the gangster drama &quot;The Long Good Friday&quot; (1980), produced by a Lew Grade subsidiary, after its original backers became cautious. Members of the Python team were involved in other comedies during the decade, including Terry Gilliam&#x27;s fantasy films &quot;Time Bandits&quot; (1981) and &quot;Brazil&quot; (1985), the black comedy &quot;Withnail &amp; I&quot; (1987), and John Cleese&#x27;s hit &quot;A Fish Called Wanda&quot; (1988), while Michael Palin starred in &quot;A Private Function&quot; (1984), from Alan Bennett&#x27;s first screenplay for the cinema screen.

Goldcrest producer David Puttnam has been described as &quot;the nearest thing to a mogul that British cinema has had in the last quarter of the 20th century.&quot; Under Puttnam, a generation of British directors emerged making popular films with international distribution. Some of the talent backed by Puttnam — Hugh Hudson, Ridley Scott, Alan Parker, and Adrian Lyne — had shot commercials; Puttnam himself had begun his career in the advertising industry. When Hudson&#x27;s &quot;Chariots of Fire&quot; (1981) won 4 Academy Awards in 1982, including Best Picture, its writer Colin Welland declared &quot;the British are coming!&quot;. When &quot;Gandhi&quot; (1982), another Goldcrest film, picked up a Best Picture Oscar, it looked as if he was right.

It prompted a cycle of period films – some with a large budget for a British film, such as David Lean&#x27;s final film &quot;A Passage to India&quot; (1984), alongside the lower-budget Merchant Ivory adaptations of the works of E. M. Forster, such as &quot;A Room with a View&quot; (1986). But further attempts to make &#x27;big&#x27; productions for the US market ended in failure, with Goldcrest losing its independence after &quot;Revolution&quot; (1985) and &quot;Absolute Beginners&quot; (1986) were commercial and critical flops. Another Goldcrest film, Roland Joffé&#x27;s &quot;The Mission&quot; (also 1986), won the 1986 Palme d&#x27;Or, but did not go into profit either. Joffé&#x27;s earlier &quot;The Killing Fields&quot; (1984) had been both a critical and financial success. These were Joffé&#x27;s first two feature films and were amongst those produced by Puttnam.

Mainly outside the commercial sector, film makers from the new commonwealth countries had begun to emerge during the 1970s. Horace Ové&#x27;s &quot;Pressure&quot; (1975) had been funded by the British Film Institute as was &quot;A Private Enterprise&quot; (1974), these being the first Black British and Asian British films, respectively. The 1980s however saw a wave of new talent, with films such as Franco Rosso&#x27;s &quot;Babylon&quot; (1980), Menelik Shabazz&#x27;s &quot;Burning an Illusion&quot; (1981) and Po-Chih Leong&#x27;s &quot;Ping Pong&quot; (1986; one of the first films about Britain&#x27;s Chinese community). Many of these films were assisted by the newly formed Channel 4, which had an official remit to provide for &quot;minority audiences.&quot; Commercial success was first achieved with &quot;My Beautiful Laundrette&quot; (1985). Dealing with racial and gay issues, it was developed from Hanif Kureishi&#x27;s first film script. &quot;My Beautiful Laundrette&quot; features Daniel Day-Lewis in a leading role. Day-Lewis and other young British actors who were becoming stars, such as Gary Oldman, Colin Firth, Tim Roth and Rupert Everett, were dubbed the Brit Pack.

With the involvement of Channel 4 in film production, talents from television moved into feature films with Stephen Frears (&quot;My Beautiful Laundrette&quot;) and Mike Newell with &quot;Dance with a Stranger&quot; (1985). John Boorman, who had been working in the US, was encouraged back to the UK to make &quot;Hope and Glory&quot; (1987). Channel Four also became a major sponsor of the British Film Institute&#x27;s Production Board, which backed three of Britain&#x27;s most critically acclaimed filmmakers: Derek Jarman (&quot;The Last of England&quot;, 1987), Terence Davies (&quot;Distant Voices, Still Lives&quot;, 1988), and Peter Greenaway; the latter of whom gained surprising commercial success with &quot;The Draughtsman&#x27;s Contract&quot; (1982) and &quot;The Cook, the Thief, His Wife &amp; Her Lover&quot; (1989). Stephen Woolley&#x27;s company Palace Pictures also produced some successful films, including Neil Jordan&#x27;s &quot;The Company of Wolves&quot; (1984) and &quot;Mona Lisa&quot; (1986), before collapsing amid a series of unsuccessful films. Amongst the other British films of the decade were Bill Forsyth&#x27;s &quot;Gregory&#x27;s Girl&quot; (1981) and &quot;Local Hero&quot; (1983), Lewis Gilbert&#x27;s &quot;Educating Rita&quot; (1983), Peter Yates&#x27; &quot;The Dresser&quot; (1983) and Kenneth Branagh&#x27;s directorial debut, &quot;Henry V&quot; (1989).

===1990s===
Compared to the 1980s, investment in film production rose dramatically. In 1989, annual investment was a meagre £104 million. By 1996, this figure had soared to £741 million. Nevertheless, the dependence on finance from television broadcasters such as the BBC and Channel 4 meant that budgets were often low and indigenous production was very fragmented: the film industry mostly relied on Hollywood inward investment. According to critic Neil Watson, it was hoped that the £90 million apportioned by the new National Lottery into three franchises (The Film Consortium, Pathé Pictures, and DNA) would fill the gap, but &quot;corporate and equity finance for the UK film production industry continues to be thin on the ground and most production companies operating in the sector remain hopelessly under-capitalised.&quot;

These problems were mostly compensated by PolyGram Filmed Entertainment, a film studio whose British subsidiary Working Title Films released a Richard Curtis-scripted comedy &quot;Four Weddings and a Funeral&quot; (1994). It grossed $244 million worldwide and introduced Hugh Grant to global fame, led to renewed interest and investment in British films, and set a pattern for British-set romantic comedies, including &quot;Sliding Doors&quot; (1998) and &quot;Notting Hill&quot; (1999). Other Working Titles films included &quot;Bean&quot; (1997), &quot;Elizabeth&quot; (1998) and &quot;Captain Corelli&#x27;s Mandolin&quot; (2001). PFE was eventually sold and merged with Universal Pictures in 1999, the hopes and expectations of &quot;building a British-based company which could compete with Hollywood in its home market [had] eventually collapsed.&quot;

Tax incentives allowed American producers to increasingly invest in UK-based film production throughout the 1990s, including films such as &quot;Interview with the Vampire&quot; (1994), &quot;&quot; (1996), &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; (1998), &quot;Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace&quot; (1999) and &quot;The Mummy&quot; (1999). Miramax also distributed Neil Jordan&#x27;s acclaimed thriller &quot;The Crying Game&quot; (1992), which was generally ignored on its initial release in the UK, but was a considerable success in the United States. The same company also enjoyed some success releasing the BBC period drama &quot;Enchanted April&quot; (1992) and &quot;The Wings of the Dove&quot; (1997).

Among the more successful British films were the Merchant Ivory productions &quot;Howards End&quot; (1992) and &quot;The Remains of the Day&quot; (1993), Richard Attenborough&#x27;s &quot;Shadowlands&quot; (1993), and Kenneth Branagh&#x27;s Shakespeare adaptations. &quot;The Madness of King George&quot; (1994) proved there was still a market for British costume dramas, and other period films followed, including &quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot; (1995), &quot;Restoration&quot; (1995), &quot;Emma&quot; (1996), &quot;Mrs. Brown&quot; (1997), &quot;Basil&quot; (1998), &quot;Shakespeare in Love&quot; (1998) and &quot;Topsy-Turvy&quot; (1999).

After a six-year hiatus for legal reasons the James Bond films returned to production with the 17th Bond film, &quot;GoldenEye&quot;. With their traditional home Pinewood Studios fully booked, a new studio was created for the film in a former Rolls-Royce aero-engine factory at Leavesden in Hertfordshire.

Mike Leigh emerged as a significant figure in British cinema in the 1990s, with a series of films financed by Channel 4 about working and middle class life in modern England, including &quot;Life Is Sweet&quot; (1991), &quot;Naked&quot; (1993) and his biggest hit &quot;Secrets &amp; Lies&quot; (1996), which won the Palme d&#x27;Or at Cannes.

Other new talents to emerge during the decade included the writer-director-producer team of John Hodge, Danny Boyle and Andrew Macdonald responsible for &quot;Shallow Grave&quot; (1994) and &quot;Trainspotting&quot; (1996). The latter film generated interested in other &quot;regional&quot; productions, including the Scottish films &quot;Small Faces&quot; (1996), &quot;Ratcatcher&quot; (1999) and &quot;My Name Is Joe&quot; (1998).

===2000s===
The first decade of the 21st century was a relatively successful one for the British film industry. Many British films found a wide international audience due to funding from BBC Films, Film 4 and the UK Film Council, and some independent production companies, such as Working Title, secured financing and distribution deals with major American studios. Working Title scored three major international successes, all starring Hugh Grant and Colin Firth, with the romantic comedies &quot;Bridget Jones&#x27;s Diary&quot; (2001), which grossed $254 million worldwide; the sequel &quot;Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason&quot;, which earned $228 million; and Richard Curtis&#x27;s directorial debut &quot;Love Actually&quot; (2003), which grossed $239 million. The most successful of all, Phyllida Lloyd&#x27;s &quot;Mamma Mia!&quot; (2008), grossed $601 million.

The new decade saw a major new film series in the Harry Potter films, beginning with &quot;Harry Potter and the Philosopher&#x27;s Stone&quot; in 2001. David Heyman&#x27;s company Heyday Films has produced seven sequels, with the final title released in two parts – &quot;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 1&quot; in 2010 and &quot;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2&quot; in 2011. All were filmed at Leavesden Studios in England.

Aardman Animations&#x27; Nick Park, the creator of Wallace and Gromit and the Creature Comforts series, produced his first feature-length film, &quot;Chicken Run&quot; in 2000. Co-directed with Peter Lord, the film was a major success worldwide and one of the most successful British films of its year. Park&#x27;s follow up, &quot;Wallace &amp; Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit&quot; was another worldwide hit: it grossed $56 million at the US box office and £32 million in the UK. It also won the 2005 Academy Award for Best Animated Feature.

However it was usually through domestically funded features throughout the decade that British directors and films won awards at the top international film festivals. In 2003, Michael Winterbottom won the Golden Bear at the Berlin Film Festival for &quot;In This World&quot;. In 2004, Mike Leigh directed &quot;Vera Drake&quot;, an account of a housewife who leads a double life as an abortion provider in 1950s London. The film won the Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival. In 2006 Stephen Frears directed &quot;The Queen&quot; based on the events surrounding the death of Princess Diana, which won the Best Actress prize at the Venice Film Festival and Academy Awards and the BAFTA for Best Film. In 2006, Ken Loach won the Palme d&#x27;Or at the Cannes Film Festival with his account of the struggle for Irish Independence in &quot;The Wind That Shakes the Barley&quot;. Joe Wright&#x27;s adaptation of the Ian McEwan novel &quot;Atonement&quot; was nominated for 7 Academy Awards, including Best Film and won the Golden Globe and BAFTA for Best Film. &quot;Slumdog Millionaire&quot; was filmed entirely in Mumbai with a mostly Indian cast, though with a British director (Danny Boyle), producer (Christian Colson), screenwriter (Simon Beaufoy) and star (Dev Patel)—the film was all-British financed via Film4 and Celador. It has received worldwide critical acclaim. It has won four Golden Globes, seven BAFTA Awards and eight Academy Awards, including Best Director and Best Film. &quot;The King&#x27;s Speech&quot;, which tells the story of King George VI&#x27;s attempts to overcome his speech impediment, was directed by Tom Hooper and filmed almost entirely in London. It received four Academy Awards (including Best Film, Best Director, Best Actor and Best Screenplay) in 2011.

The start of the 21st century saw Asian British cinema assert itself at the box office, starting with &quot;East Is East&quot; (1999) and continuing with &quot;Bend It Like Beckham&quot; (2002). Other notable British Asian films from this period include &quot;My Son the Fanatic&quot; (1997), &quot;Ae Fond Kiss... (2004)&quot;, &quot;Mischief Night (2006)&quot;, &quot;Yasmin&quot; (2004) and &quot;Four Lions&quot; (2010). Some argue it has brought more flexible attitudes towards casting Black and Asian British actors, with Robbie Gee and Naomie Harris take leading roles in &quot;Underworld&quot; and &quot;28 Days Later&quot; respectively.

2005 saw the emergence of The British Urban Film Festival, a timely addition to the film festival calendar, which recognised the influence of urban and black films on UK audiences and consequently began to showcase a growing profile of films in a genre previously not otherwise regularly seen in the capital&#x27;s cinemas. Then, in 2006, &quot;Kidulthood&quot;, a film depicting a group of teenagers growing up on the streets of West London, had a limited release. This was successfully followed up with a sequel &quot;Adulthood&quot; (2008) that was written and directed by actor Noel Clarke. The success of &quot;Kidulthood&quot; and &quot;Adulthood&quot; led to the release of several other films in the 2000s and 2010s such as &quot;Bullet Boy&quot; (2004), &quot;Life and Lyrics&quot; (2006), &quot;The Intent&quot; (2016), its sequel &quot;The Intent 2: The Come Up&quot; (2018), &quot;Blue Story&quot; and &quot;Rocks&quot; (both 2019), all of starred Black-British actors.

Like the 1960s, this decade saw plenty of British films directed by imported talent. The American Woody Allen shot &quot;Match Point&quot; (2005) and three later films in London. The Mexican director Alfonso Cuarón helmed &quot;Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban&quot; (2004) and &quot;Children of Men&quot; (2006); New Zealand filmmaker Jane Campion made &quot;Bright Star&quot; (2009), a film set in 19th century London; Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn made &quot;Bronson&quot; (2008), a biopic about the English criminal Michael Gordon Peterson; the Spanish filmmaker Juan Carlos Fresnadillo directed &quot;28 Weeks Later&quot; (2007), a sequel to a British horror film; and two John le Carré adaptations were also directed by foreigners—&quot;The Constant Gardener&quot; by the Brazilian Fernando Meirelles and &quot;Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy&quot; by the Swedish Tomas Alfredson. The decade also saw English actor Daniel Craig became the new James Bond with &quot;Casino Royale&quot;, the 21st entry in the official Eon Productions series.

Despite increasing competition from film studios in Australia and Eastern Europe, British studios such as Pinewood, Shepperton and Leavesden remained successful in hosting major productions, including &quot;Finding Neverland&quot;, &quot;Closer&quot;, &quot;Batman Begins&quot;, &quot;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory&quot;, &quot;United 93&quot;, &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot;, &quot;Sweeney Todd&quot;, &quot;Fantastic Mr. Fox&quot;, &quot;Robin Hood&quot;, &quot;X-Men: First Class&quot;, &quot;Hugo&quot; and &quot;War Horse&quot;.

In February 2007, the UK became home to Europe&#x27;s first DCI-compliant fully digital multiplex cinemas with the launch of Odeon Hatfield and Odeon Surrey Quays (in London), with a total of 18 digital screens.

In November 2010, Warner Bros. completed the acquisition of Leavesden Film Studios, becoming the first Hollywood studio since the 1940s to have a permanent base in the UK, and announced plans to invest £100 million in the site.

A study by the British Film Institute published in December 2013 found that of the 613 tracked British films released between 2003 and 2010 only 7% made a profit. Films with low budgets, those that cost below £500,000 to produce, were even less likely to gain a return on outlay. Of these films, only 3.1% went into the black. At the top end of budgets for the British industry, under a fifth of films that cost £10million went into profit.

===2010s===
On 26 July 2010 it was announced that the UK Film Council, which was the main body responsible for the development of promotion of British cinema during the 2000s, would be abolished, with many of the abolished body&#x27;s functions being taken over by the British Film Institute. Actors and professionals, including James McAvoy, Emily Blunt, Pete Postlethwaite, Damian Lewis, Timothy Spall, Daniel Barber and Ian Holm, campaigned against the council&#x27;s abolition. The move also led American actor and director Clint Eastwood (who had filmed &quot;Hereafter&quot; in London) to write to the British Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne in August 2010 to protest the decision to close the council. Eastwood warned Osborne that the closure could result in fewer foreign production companies choosing to work in the UK. A grass-roots online campaign was launched and a petition established by supporters of the council.

Countering this, a few professionals, including Michael Winner and Julian Fellowes, supported the Government&#x27;s decision. A number of other organisations responded positively.

At the closure of the UK Film Council on 31 March 2011, &quot;The Guardian&quot; reported that &quot;The UKFC&#x27;s entire annual budget was a reported £3m, while the cost of closing it down and restructuring is estimated to have been almost four times that amount.&quot; One of the UKFC&#x27;s last films, &quot;The King&#x27;s Speech&quot;, is estimated to have cost $15m to make and grossed $235m, besides winning several Academy Awards. UKFC invested $1.6m for a 34% share of net profits, a valuable stake that will pass to the British Film Institute.

In June 2012, Warner opened the re-developed Leavesden studio for business. The most commercially successful British directors in recent years are Paul Greengrass, Mike Newell, Christopher Nolan, Ridley Scott and David Yates.

In January 2012, at Pinewood Studios to visit film-related businesses, UK Prime Minister David Cameron said that his government had bold ambitions for the film industry: &quot;Our role, and that of the BFI, should be to support the sector in becoming even more dynamic and entrepreneurial, helping UK producers to make commercially successful pictures that rival the quality and impact of the best international productions. Just as the British Film Commission has played a crucial role in attracting the biggest and best international studios to produce their films here, so we must incentivise UK producers to chase new markets both here and overseas.&quot;

The film industry remains an important earner for the British economy. According to a UK Film Council press release of 20 January 2011, £1.115 billion was spent on UK film production during 2010. A 2014 survey suggested that British-made films were generally more highly rated than Hollywood productions, especially when considering low-budget UK productions.

===2020s===
In November 2022, director Danny Boyle expressed a negative sentiment of the British film industry in recent years, stating that &quot;I am not sure we are great filmmakers, to be absolutely honest. As a nation, our two artforms are theatre, in a middle-class sense, and pop music, because we are extraordinary at it.&quot;

The BFI&#x27;s published figures reported £6.27 billion spent on film and high-end television production in 2022, with domestic UK film spend at £173.6 million. While the total spend was at a record high for the UK, the independent UK filmmaking spend decreased by 31% since 2021.

The UK film industry was affected by the 2023 SAG-AFTRA strike with 80% of behind-the-scenes workers surveyed stating that their jobs had been affected.

==Art cinema==

Although it had been funding British experimental films as early as 1952, the British Film Institute&#x27;s foundation of a production board in 1964—and a substantial increase in public funding from 1971 onwards—enabled it to become a dominant force in developing British art cinema in the 1970s and 80s: from the first of Bill Douglas&#x27;s Trilogy &quot;My Childhood&quot; (1972), and of Terence Davies&#x27; Trilogy &quot;Childhood&quot; (1978), via Peter Greenaway&#x27;s earliest films (including the surprising commercial success of &quot;The Draughtsman&#x27;s Contract&quot; (1982)) and Derek Jarman&#x27;s championing of the New Queer Cinema. The first full-length feature produced under the BFI&#x27;s new scheme was Kevin Brownlow and Andrew Mollo&#x27;s &quot;Winstanley&quot; (1975), while others included &quot;Moon Over the Alley&quot; (1975), &quot;Requiem for a Village&quot; (1975), the openly avant-garde &quot;Central Bazaar&quot; (1973), &quot;Pressure&quot; (1975) and &quot;A Private Enterprise&quot; (1974) – the last two being, respectively, the first British Black and Asian features.

The release of Derek Jarman&#x27;s &quot;Jubilee&quot; (1978) marked the beginning of a successful period of UK art cinema, continuing into the 1980s with filmmakers like Sally Potter and Ken McMullen, and producers like Stewart Richards, with success at the Cannes Film Festival and the Academy Awards. Unlike the previous generation of British film makers who had broken into directing and production after careers in the theatre or on television, the Art Cinema Directors were mostly the products of Art Schools. Many of these filmmakers were championed in their early career by the London Film Makers Cooperative and their work was the subject of detailed theoretical analysis in the journal &quot;Screen Education&quot;. Peter Greenaway was an early pioneer of the use of computer generated imagery blended with filmed footage and was also one of the first directors to film entirely on high definition video for a cinema release.

With the launch of Channel 4 and its Film on Four commissioning strand, Art Cinema was promoted to a wider audience. However, the Channel had a sharp change in its commissioning policy in the early 1990s and Greenaway and others were forced to seek European co-production financing.

==Film technology==

In the 1970s and 1980s, British studios established a reputation for great special effects in films such as &quot;Superman&quot; (1978), &quot;Alien&quot; (1979), and &quot;Batman&quot; (1989). Some of this reputation was founded on the core of talent brought together for the filming of &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot; (1968) who subsequently worked together on series and feature films for Gerry Anderson. Thanks to the Bristol-based Aardman Animations, the UK is still recognised as a world leader in the use of stop-motion animation.

British special effects technicians and production designers are known for creating visual effects at a far lower cost than their counterparts in the US, as seen in &quot;Time Bandits&quot; (1981) and &quot;Brazil&quot; (1985). This reputation has continued through the 1990s and into the 21st century with films such as the James Bond series, &quot;Gladiator&quot; (2000) and the Harry Potter franchise.

From the 1990s to the present day, there has been a progressive movement from traditional film opticals to an integrated digital film environment, with special effects, cutting, colour grading, and other post-production tasks all sharing the same all-digital infrastructure. The London-based visual effects company Framestore, with Tim Webber the visual effects supervisor, have worked on some of the most technically and artistically challenging projects, including, &quot;The Dark Knight&quot; (2008) and &quot;Gravity&quot; (2013), with new techniques involved in &quot;Gravity&quot; realized by Webber and the Framestore team taking three years to complete.

The availability of high-speed internet has made the British film industry capable of working closely with U.S. studios as part of globally distributed productions. As of 2005, this trend is expected to continue with moves towards (currently experimental) digital distribution and projection as mainstream technologies. The British film &quot;This Is Not a Love Song&quot; (2003) was the first to be streamed live on the Internet at the same time as its cinema premiere.

<text>Feminist film theory is a theoretical film criticism derived from feminist politics and feminist theory influenced by second-wave feminism and brought about around the 1970s in the United States. With the advancements in film throughout the years feminist film theory has developed and changed to analyse the current ways of film and also go back to analyse films past. Feminists have many approaches to cinema analysis, regarding the film elements analyzed and their theoretical underpinnings.
==History==
The development of feminist film theory was influenced by second wave feminism and women&#x27;s studies in the 1960s and 1970s. Initially, in the United States in the early 1970s, feminist film theory was generally based on sociological theory and focused on the function of female characters in film narratives or genres. Feminist film theory, such as Marjorie Rosen&#x27;s &quot;Popcorn Venus: Women, Movies, and the American Dream&quot; (1973) and Molly Haskell’s &quot;From Reverence to Rape: The Treatment of Women in Movies&quot; (1974) analyze the ways in which women are portrayed in film, and how this relates to a broader historical context. Additionally, feminist critiques also examine common stereotypes depicted in film, the extent to which the women were shown as active or passive, and the amount of screen time given to women.

In contrast, film theoreticians in England concerned themselves with critical theory, psychoanalysis, semiotics, and Marxism. Eventually, these ideas gained hold within the American scholarly community in the 1980s. Analysis generally focused on the meaning within a film&#x27;s text and the way in which the text constructs a viewing subject. It also examined how the process of cinematic production affects how women are represented and reinforces sexism.

British feminist film theorist, Laura Mulvey, best known for her essay, &quot;Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema&quot;, written in 1973 and published in 1975 in the influential British film theory journal, &quot;Screen&quot; was influenced by the theories of Sigmund Freud and Jacques Lacan. &quot;Visual Pleasure&quot; is one of the first major essays that helped shift the orientation of film theory towards a psychoanalytic framework. Prior to Mulvey, film theorists such as Jean-Louis Baudry and Christian Metz used psychoanalytic ideas in their theoretical accounts of cinema. Mulvey&#x27;s contribution, however, initiated the intersection of film theory, psychoanalysis and feminism.

In 1976, the journal Camera Obscura was published by beginning graduate students Janet Bergstrom, Sandy Flitterman, Elisabeth Lyon, and Constance Penley. They discussed how women were portrayed in films, but excluded from the development process. Camera Obscura is still published to this day by Duke University Press and has moved from just film theory to media studies.

Other key influences come from Metz&#x27;s essay &quot;The Imaginary Signifier&quot;, &quot;Identification, Mirror,&quot; where he argues that viewing film is only possible through scopophilia (pleasure from looking, related to voyeurism), which is best exemplified in silent film. Also, according to Cynthia A. Freeland in &quot;Feminist Frameworks for Horror Films,&quot; feminist studies of horror films have focused on psychodynamics where the chief interest is &quot;on viewers&#x27; motives and interests in watching horror films&quot;.

Beginning in the early 1980s, feminist film theory began to look at film through a more intersectional lens. The film journal &quot;Jump Cut&quot; published a special issue about titled &quot;Lesbians and Film&quot; in 1981 which examined the lack of lesbian identities in film. Jane Gaines&#x27;s essay &quot;White Privilege and Looking Relations: Race and Gender in Feminist Film Theory&quot; examined the erasure of black women in cinema by white male filmmakers. While Lola Young argues that filmmakers of all races fail to break away from the use to tired stereotypes when depicting black women. Other theorists who wrote about feminist film theory and race include bell hooks and Michele Wallace.

From 1985 onward the Matrixial theory of artist and psychoanalyst Bracha L. Ettinger revolutionized feminist film theory. 
 Her concept, from her book, The Matrixial Gaze, has established a feminine gaze and has articulated its differences from the phallic gaze and its relation to feminine as well as maternal specificities and potentialities of &quot;coemergence&quot;, offering a critique of Sigmund Freud&#x27;s and Jacques Lacan&#x27;s psychoanalysis, is extensively used in analysis of films, by female directors, like Chantal Akerman, as well as by male directors, like Pedro Almodovar. The matrixial gaze offers the female the position of a subject, not of an object, of the gaze, while deconstructing the structure of the subject itself, and offers border-time, border-space and a possibility for compassion and witnessing. Ettinger&#x27;s notions articulate the links between aesthetics, ethics and trauma.

Recently, scholars have expanded their work to include analysis of television and digital media. Additionally, they have begun to explore notions of difference, engaging in dialogue about the differences among women (part of movement away from essentialism in feminist work more generally), the various methodologies and perspectives contained under the umbrella of feminist film theory, and the multiplicity of methods and intended effects that influence the development of films. Scholars are also taking increasingly global perspectives, responding to postcolonialist criticisms of perceived Anglo- and Eurocentrism in the academy more generally. Increased focus has been given to, &quot;disparate feminisms, nationalisms, and media in various locations and across class, racial, and ethnic groups throughout the world&quot;. Scholars in recent years have also turned their attention towards women in the silent film industry and their erasure from the history of those films and women&#x27;s bodies and how they are portrayed in the films. Jane Gaines&#x27;s Women&#x27;s Film Pioneer Project (WFPP), a database of women who worked in the silent-era film industry, has been cited as a major achievement in recognizing pioneering women in the field of silent and non-silent film by scholars such as Rachel Schaff.

As of recent years many believe feminist film theory to be a fading area of feminism with the massive amount of coverage currently around media studies and theory. As these areas have grown the framework created in feminist film theory have been adapted to fit into analysing other forms of media.

==Key themes==
===The gaze and the female spectator===
Considering the way that films are put together, many feminist film critics have pointed to what they argue is the &quot;male gaze&quot; that predominates classical Hollywood filmmaking. Budd Boetticher summarizes the view:
:&quot;What counts is what the heroine provokes, or rather what she represents. She is the one, or rather the love or fear she inspires in the hero, or else the concern he feels for her, who makes him act the way he does. In herself, the woman has not the slightest importance.&quot;
Laura Mulvey expands on this conception to argue that in cinema, women are typically depicted in a passive role that provides visual pleasure through scopophilia, and identification with the on-screen male actor. She asserts: &quot;In their traditional exhibitionist role women are simultaneously looked at and displayed, with their appearance coded for strong visual and erotic impact so that they can be said to connote &quot;to-be-looked-at-ness&quot;,&quot; and as a result contends that in film a woman is the &quot;bearer of meaning, not maker of meaning.&quot; Mulvey argues that the psychoanalytic theory of Jacques Lacan is the key to understanding how film creates such a space for female sexual objectification and exploitation through the combination of the patriarchal order of society, and &#x27;looking&#x27; in itself as a pleasurable act of scopophilia, as &quot;the cinema satisfies a primordial wish for pleasurable looking.&quot;

While Laura Mulvey&#x27;s paper has a particular place in the feminist film theory, it is important to note that her ideas regarding ways of watching the cinema (from the voyeuristic element to the feelings of identification) are important to some feminist film theorists in terms of defining spectatorship from the psychoanalytical viewpoint.

Mulvey identifies three &quot;looks&quot; or perspectives that occur in film which, she argues, serve to sexually objectify women. The first is the perspective of the male character and how he perceives the female character. The second is the perspective of the spectator as they see the female character on screen. The third &quot;look&quot; joins the first two looks together: it is the male audience member&#x27;s perspective of the male character in the film. This third perspective allows the male audience to take the female character as his own personal sex object because he can relate himself, through looking, to the male character in the film.

In the paper, Mulvey calls for a destruction of modern film structure as the only way to free women from their sexual objectification in film. She argues for a removal of the voyeurism encoded into film by creating distance between the male spectator and the female character. The only way to do so, Mulvey argues, is by destroying the element of voyeurism and &quot;the invisible guest&quot;. Mulvey also asserts that the dominance men embody is only so because women exist, as without a woman for comparison, a man and his supremacy as the controller of visual pleasure are insignificant. For Mulvey, it is the presence of the female that defines the patriarchal order of society as well as the male psychology of thought.

Mulvey&#x27;s argument is likely influenced by the time period in which she was writing. &quot;Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema&quot; was composed during the period of second-wave feminism, which was concerned with achieving equality for women in the workplace, and with exploring the psychological implications of sexual stereotypes. Mulvey calls for an eradication of female sexual objectivity, aligning herself with second-wave feminism. She argues that in order for women to be equally represented in the workplace, women must be portrayed as men are: as lacking sexual objectification.

Mulvey proposes in her notes to the Criterion Collection DVD of Michael Powell&#x27;s controversial film, &quot;Peeping Tom&quot; (a film about a homicidal voyeur who films the deaths of his victims), that the cinema spectator&#x27;s own voyeurism is made shockingly obvious and even more shockingly, the spectator identifies with the perverted protagonist. The inference is that she includes female spectators in that, identifying with the male observer rather than the female object of the gaze.

===Realism and counter cinema===

The early work of Marjorie Rosen and Molly Haskell on the representation of women in film was part of a movement to depict women more realistically, both in documentaries and narrative cinema. The growing female presence in the film industry was seen as a positive step toward realizing this goal, by drawing attention to feminist issues and putting forth an alternative, true-to-life view of women. However, Rosen and Haskell argue that these images are still mediated by the same factors as traditional film, such as the &quot;moving camera, composition, editing, lighting, and all varieties of sound.&quot; While acknowledging the value in inserting positive representations of women in film, some critics asserted that real change would only come about from reconsidering the role of film in society, often from a semiotic point of view.

Claire Johnston put forth the idea that women&#x27;s cinema can function as &quot;counter cinema.&quot; Through consciousness of the means of production and opposition of sexist ideologies, films made by women have the potential to posit an alternative to traditional Hollywood films. Initially, the attempt to show &quot;real&quot; women was praised, eventually critics such as Eileen McGarry claimed that the &quot;real&quot; women being shown on screen were still just contrived depictions. In reaction to this article, many women filmmakers integrated &quot;alternative forms and experimental techniques&quot; to &quot;encourage audiences to critique the seemingly transparent images on the screen and to question the manipulative techniques of filming and editing&quot;.

=== Additional theories ===
B. Ruby Rich argues that feminist film theory should shift to look at films in a broader sense. Rich&#x27;s essay &quot;In the Name of Feminist Film Criticism&quot; claims that films by women often receive praise for certain elements, while feminist undertones are ignored. Rich goes on to say that because of this feminist theory needs to focus on how film by women are being received.

Coming from a black feminist perspective, American scholar, bell hooks, put forth the notion of the “oppositional gaze,” encouraging black women not to accept stereotypical representations in film, but rather actively critique them. The “oppositional gaze” is a response to Mulvey&#x27;s &quot;visual pleasure&quot; and states that just as women do not identify with female characters that are not &quot;real,&quot; women of color should respond similarly to the one denominational caricatures of black women.
Janet Bergstrom&#x27;s article “Enunciation and Sexual Difference” (1979) uses Sigmund Freud&#x27;s ideas of bisexual responses, arguing that women are capable of identifying with male characters and men with women characters, either successively or simultaneously. Miriam Hansen, in &quot;Pleasure, Ambivalence, Identification: Valentino and Female Spectatorship&quot; (1984) put forth the idea that women are also able to view male characters as erotic objects of desire. In &quot;The Master&#x27;s Dollhouse: Rear Window,&quot; Tania Modleski argues that Hitchcock&#x27;s film, &quot;Rear Window&quot;, is an example of the power of male gazer and the position of the female as a prisoner of the &quot;master&#x27;s dollhouse&quot;.

Carol Clover, in her popular and influential book, &quot;Men, Women, and Chainsaws: Gender in the Modern Horror Film&quot; (Princeton University Press, 1992), argues that young male viewers of the Horror Genre (young males being the primary demographic) are quite prepared to identify with the female-in-jeopardy, a key component of the horror narrative, and to identify on an unexpectedly profound level. Clover further argues that the &quot;final girl&quot; in the psychosexual subgenre of exploitation horror invariably triumphs through her own resourcefulness, and is not by any means a passive, or inevitable, victim. Laura Mulvey, in response to these and other criticisms, revisited the topic in &quot;Afterthoughts on &#x27;Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema&#x27; inspired by &quot;Duel in the Sun&quot;&quot; (1981). In addressing the heterosexual female spectator, she revised her stance to argue that women can take two possible roles in relation to film: a masochistic identification with the female object of desire that is ultimately self-defeating, or an identification with men as the active viewers of the text. A new version of the gaze was offered in the early 1990s by Bracha Ettinger, who proposed the notion of the &quot;matrixial gaze&quot;.

<doc id="10798" wikidata="Q5469986" url="?curid=10798" title="Formalist film theory">
<text>Formalist film theory is an approach to film theory that is focused on the formal or technical elements of a film: i.e., the lighting, scoring, sound and set design, use of color, shot composition, and editing. This approach was proposed by Hugo Münsterberg, Rudolf Arnheim, Sergei Eisenstein, and Béla Balázs. Today, formalist film theory is a recognized approach in film studies.

== Overview ==
Formalism considers the synthesis of the multiple elements of film production, and the effects, emotional and intellectual, of that synthesis and of the individual elements. For example, a formalist views standard Hollywood &quot;continuity editing&quot; for how it creates a comforting effect and non-continuity or how jump cut editing becomes disconcerting.

A formalist considers the synthesis of several elements, such as editing, shot composition, and music. The shoot-out that ends Sergio Leone&#x27;s Spaghetti Western &quot;Dollars Trilogy&quot; is an example of how these elements work together to produce a formalist effect: the shot selection goes from very wide to very close and tense; the length of shots decreases as the sequence progresses towards its end; the music builds. All of these elements, in combination rather than individually, create tension.

Formalism incorporates ideological and auteurist branches of criticism. In both these cases, the common denominator for formalist criticism is style. Ideologues focus on how socio-economic pressures create a particular style, and auteurists on how auteurs put their own stamp on the material. Formalism is concerned with style and how the film communicates ideas, emotions, and themes rather than on the themes of a work itself.

== Formalism in ideological approaches ==
Two examples of ideological interpretations that are related to formalism are the classical Hollywood cinema and film noir.

=== Classical Hollywood cinema ===
Classical Hollywood cinema uses a style referred to as the institutional mode of representation: continuity editing, massive coverage, three-point lighting, &quot;mood&quot; music, and dissolves. The socio-economic ideological explanation for this is style involves Hollywood&#x27;s desire to monetarily profit and appeal to ticket-buyers.

=== Film noir ===
Film noir, which was given its name by Nino Frank, is marked by lower production values, darker images, under lighting, location shooting, and general nihilism: this is because during the war and post-war years filmmakers and filmgoers tended to have a pessimistic outlook. Also, the German Expressionists immigrated to America and brought their stylized lighting effects and disillusionment due to the war to American soil.

<text>Film theory is a set of scholarly approaches within the academic discipline of film or cinema studies that began in the 1920s by questioning the formal essential attributes of motion pictures; and that now provides conceptual frameworks for understanding film&#x27;s relationship to reality, the other arts, individual viewers, and society at large. Film theory is not to be confused with general film criticism, or film history, though these three disciplines interrelate.

Although some branches of film theory are derived from linguistics and literary theory, it also originated and overlaps with the philosophy of film.

==History==

=== Early theory, before 1945 ===
French philosopher Henri Bergson&#x27;s &quot;Matter and Memory&quot; (1896) anticipated the development of film theory during the birth of cinema in the early twentieth century. Bergson commented on the need for new ways of thinking about movement, and coined the terms &quot;the movement-image&quot; and &quot;the time-image&quot;. However, in his 1906 essay &quot;L&#x27;illusion cinématographique&quot; (in &quot;L&#x27;évolution créatrice&quot;; English: &quot;The cinematic illusion&quot;) he rejects film as an example of what he had in mind. Nonetheless, decades later, in &quot;Cinéma I and Cinema II&quot; (1983–1985), the philosopher Gilles Deleuze took &quot;Matter and Memory&quot; as the basis of his philosophy of film and revisited Bergson&#x27;s concepts, combining them with the semiotics of Charles Sanders Peirce. Early film theory arose in the silent era and was mostly concerned with defining the crucial elements of the medium. Ricciotto Canudo was an early Italian film theoretician who saw cinema as &quot;&quot;plastic art in motion&quot;, and gave cinema the label &quot;the Sixth Art&quot;, later changed to &quot;the Seventh Art&quot;&quot;.

In 1915, Vachel Lindsay wrote a book on film, followed a year later by Hugo Münsterberg. Lindsay argued that films could be classified into three categories: &quot;action films&quot;, &quot;intimate films&quot;, as well as &quot;films of splendour&quot;. According to him, the action film was &quot;sculpture-in-motion&quot;, while the intimate film was &quot;painting-in-motion&quot;, and splendour film &quot;architecture-in-motion&quot;. He also argued against the contemporary notion of calling films &quot;photoplays&quot; and seen as filmed versions of theatre, instead seeing film with &quot;camera-born&quot; opportunities. He also described cinema as &quot;hieroglyphic&quot; in the sense of containing symbols in its images. He believed this visuality gave film the potential for universal accessibility. Münsterberg in turn noted the analogies between cinematic techniques and certain mental processes. For example, he compared the close-up to the mind paying attention. The flashback, in turn, was similar to remembering. This was later followed by the &quot;formalism&quot; of Rudolf Arnheim, who studied how techniques influenced film as art.

Among early French theorists, Germaine Dulac brought the concept of &quot;impressionism&quot; to film by describing cinema that explored the malleability of the border between internal experience and external reality, for example through superimposition. &quot;Surrealism&quot; also had an influence on early French film culture. The term &quot;photogénie&quot; was important to both, having been brought to use by Louis Delluc in 1919 and becoming widespread in its usage to capture the unique power of cinema. Jean Epstein noted how filming gives a &quot;personality&quot; or a &quot;spirit&quot; to objects while also being able to reveal &quot;the untrue, the unreal, the &#x27;surreal&#x27;&quot;. This was similar to defamiliarization used by avant-garde artists to recreate the world. He saw the close-up as the essence of &quot;photogénie&quot;. Béla Balázs also praised the close-up for similar reasons. Arnheim also believed defamiliarization to be a critical element of film.

After the Russian Revolution, a chaotic situation in the country also created a sense of excitement at new possibilities. This gave rise to montage theory in the work of Dziga Vertov and Sergei Eisenstein. After the establishment of the Moscow Film School, Lev Kuleshov set up a workshop to study the formal structure of film, focusing on editing as &quot;the essence of cinematography&quot;. This produced findings on the Kuleshov effect. Editing was also associated with the foundational Marxist concept of dialectical materialism. To this end, Eisenstein claimed that &quot;montage is conflict&quot;. Eisenstein&#x27;s theories were focused on montage having the ability create meaning transcending the sum of its parts with a &quot;thematic effect&quot; in a way that ideograms turned graphics into abstract symbols. Multiple scenes could work to produce themes (&quot;tonal montage&quot;), while multiple themes could create even higher levels of meaning (&quot;intellectual montage&quot;). Vertov in turn focused on developing Kino-Pravda, &quot;film truth,&quot; and the Kino-Eye, which he claimed showed a deeper truth than could be seen with the naked eye.

=== Later theory, after 1945 ===
In the years after World War II, the French film critic and theorist André Bazin argued that film&#x27;s essence lay in its ability to mechanically reproduce reality, not in its difference from reality. This had followed the rise of &quot;poetic realism&quot; in French cinema in the 1930s. He believed that the purpose of art is to preserve reality, even famously claiming that &quot;The photographic image is the object itself&quot;. Based on this, he advocated for the use of long takes and deep focus, to reveal the &quot;structural depth&quot; of reality and finding meaning objectively in images. This was soon followed by the rise of Italian neorealism. Siegfried Kracauer was also notable for arguing that realism is the most important function of cinema.

The Auteur theory derived from the approach of critic and filmmaker Alexandre Astruc, among others, and was originally developed in articles in &quot;Cahiers du Cinéma&quot;, a film journal that had been co-founded by Bazin. François Truffaut issued auteurism&#x27;s manifestos in two &quot;Cahiers&quot; essays: &quot;Une certaine tendance du cinéma français&quot; (January 1954) and &quot;Ali Baba et la &#x27;Politique des auteurs&#x27;&quot; (February 1955). His approach was brought to American criticism by Andrew Sarris in 1962. The auteur theory was based on films depicting the directors&#x27; own worldviews and impressions of the subject matter, by varying lighting, camerawork, staging, editing, and so on. Georges Sadoul deemed a film&#x27;s putative &quot;author&quot; potentially even an actor, but a film indeed collaborative. Aljean Harmetz cited major control even by film executives. David Kipen&#x27;s view of screenwriter as indeed main author is termed &quot;Schreiber theory&quot;.

In the 1960s and 1970s, film theory took up residence in academia importing concepts from established disciplines like psychoanalysis, gender studies, anthropology, literary theory, semiotics and linguisticsas advanced by scholars such as Christian Metz. However, not until the late 1980s or early 1990s did film theory &quot;per se&quot; achieve much prominence in American universities by displacing the prevailing humanistic, auteur theory that had dominated cinema studies and which had been focused on the practical elements of film writing, production, editing and criticism. American scholar David Bordwell has spoken against many prominent developments in film theory since the 1970s. He uses the derogatory term &quot;SLAB theory&quot; to refer to film studies based on the ideas of Ferdinand de Saussure, Jacques Lacan, Louis Althusser, and Roland Barthes. Instead, Bordwell promotes what he describes as &quot;neoformalism&quot; (a revival of formalist film theory).

During the 1990s the digital revolution in image technologies has influenced film theory in various ways. There has been a refocus onto celluloid film&#x27;s ability to capture an &quot;indexical&quot; image of a moment in time by theorists like Mary Ann Doane, Philip Rosen and Laura Mulvey who was informed by psychoanalysis. From a psychoanalytical perspective, after the Lacanian notion of &quot;the Real&quot;, Slavoj Žižek offered new aspects of &quot;the gaze&quot; extensively used in contemporary film analysis. From the 1990s onward the Matrixial theory of artist and psychoanalyst Bracha L. Ettinger revolutionized feminist film theory. Her concept The Matrixial Gaze, that has established a feminine gaze and has articulated its differences from the phallic gaze and its relation to feminine as well as maternal specificities and potentialities of &quot;coemergence&quot;, offering a critique of Sigmund Freud&#x27;s and Jacques Lacan&#x27;s psychoanalysis, is extensively used in analysis of films by female authors, like Chantal Akerman, as well as by male authors, like Pedro Almodovar. The matrixial gaze offers the female the position of a subject, not of an object, of the gaze, while deconstructing the structure of the subject itself, and offers border-time, border-space and a possibility for compassion and witnessing. Ettinger&#x27;s notions articulate the links between aesthetics, ethics and trauma. There has also been a historical revisiting of early cinema screenings, practices and spectatorship modes by writers Tom Gunning, Miriam Hansen and Yuri Tsivian.

In &quot;Critical Cinema: Beyond the Theory of Practice&quot; (2011), Clive Meyer suggests that &#x27;cinema is a different experience to watching a film at home or in an art gallery&#x27;, and argues for film theorists to re-engage the specificity of philosophical concepts for cinema as a medium distinct from others.

<text>Film noir (; ) is a style of Hollywood crime dramas that emphasizes cynical attitudes and motivations. The 1940s and 1950s are generally regarded as the &quot;classic period&quot; of American film noir. Film noir of this era is associated with a low-key, black-and-white visual style that has roots in German expressionist cinematography. Many of the prototypical stories and attitudes expressed in classic noir derive from the hardboiled school of crime fiction that emerged in the United States during the Great Depression, known as noir fiction. 

The term &quot;film noir&quot;, French for &quot;black film&quot; (literal) or &quot;dark film&quot; (closer meaning), was first applied to Hollywood films by French critic Nino Frank in 1946, but was unrecognized by most American film industry professionals of that era. Frank is believed to have been inspired by the French literary publishing imprint Série noire, founded in 1945.

Cinema historians and critics defined the category retrospectively. Before the notion was widely adopted in the 1970s, many of the classic films noir were referred to as &quot;melodramas&quot;. Whether film noir qualifies as a distinct genre or whether it should be considered a filmmaking style is a matter of ongoing and heavy debate among film scholars.

Film noir encompasses a range of plots; common archetypical protagonists include a private investigator (&quot;The Big Sleep&quot;), a plainclothes police officer (&quot;The Big Heat&quot;), an aging boxer (&quot;The Set-Up&quot;), a hapless grifter (&quot;Night and the City&quot;), a law-abiding citizen lured into a life of crime (&quot;Gun Crazy&quot;), a femme fatale (&quot;Gilda&quot;) or simply a victim of circumstance (&quot;D.O.A.&quot;). Although film noir was originally associated with American productions, the term has been used to describe films from around the world. Many films released from the 1960s onward share attributes with films noir of the classical period, and often treat its conventions self-referentially. Latter-day works are typically referred to as neo-noir. The clichés of film noir have inspired parody since the mid-1940s.

==Definition==

The question of what defines film noir and what sort of category it is, provokes continuing debate. &quot;We&#x27;d be oversimplifying things in calling film noir oneiric, strange, erotic, ambivalent, and cruel ...&quot;—this set of attributes constitutes the first of many attempts to define film noir made by French critics and Étienne Chaumeton in their 1955 book &quot;Panorama du film noir américain 1941–1953&quot; (&quot;A Panorama of American Film Noir&quot;), the original and seminal extended treatment of the subject.

 They emphasize that not every noir film embodies all five attributes in equal measure—one might be more dreamlike; another, particularly brutal. The authors&#x27; caveats and repeated efforts at alternative definition have been echoed in subsequent scholarship, but in the words of cinema historian Mark Bould, film noir remains an &quot;elusive phenomenon.&quot;

Though film noir is often identified with a visual style that emphasizes low-key lighting and unbalanced compositions, films commonly identified as noir evidence a variety of visual approaches, including ones that fit comfortably within the Hollywood mainstream. Film noir similarly embraces a variety of genres, from the gangster film to the police procedural to the gothic romance to the social problem picture—any example of which from the 1940s and 1950s, now seen as noir&#x27;s classical era, was likely to be described as a melodrama at the time.

While many critics refer to film noir as a genre itself, others argue that it can be no such thing. Foster Hirsch defines a genre as determined by &quot;conventions of narrative structure, characterization, theme, and visual design.&quot; Hirsch, as one who has taken the position that film noir is a genre, argues that these elements are present &quot;in abundance.&quot; Hirsch notes that there are unifying features of tone, visual style and narrative sufficient to classify noir as a distinct genre.

Others argue that film noir is not a genre. It is often associated with an urban setting, but many classic noirs take place in small towns, suburbia, rural areas, or on the open road; setting is not a determinant, as with the Western. Similarly, while the private eye and the femme fatale are stock character types conventionally identified with noir, the majority of films in the genre feature neither. Nor does film noir rely on anything as evident as the monstrous or supernatural elements of the horror film, the speculative leaps of the science fiction film, or the song-and-dance routines of the musical.

An analogous case is that of the screwball comedy, widely accepted by film historians as constituting a &quot;genre&quot;: screwball is defined not by a fundamental attribute, but by a general disposition and a group of elements, some—but rarely and perhaps never all—of which are found in each of the genre&#x27;s films. Because of the diversity of noir (much greater than that of the screwball comedy), certain scholars in the field, such as film historian Thomas Schatz, treat it as not a genre but a &quot;style&quot;.

 Alain Silver, the most widely published American critic specializing in film noir studies, refers to film noir as a &quot;cycle&quot; and a &quot;phenomenon&quot;, even as he argues that it has—like certain genres—a consistent set of visual and thematic codes. Screenwriter Eric R. Williams labels both film noir and screwball comedy a &quot;pathway&quot; in his screenwriters taxonomy; explaining that a pathway has two parts: 1) the way the audience connects with the protagonist and 2) the trajectory the audience expects the story to follow. Other critics treat film noir as a &quot;mood,&quot; a &quot;series&quot;, or simply a chosen set of films they regard as belonging to the noir &quot;canon.&quot; There is no consensus on the matter.

==Background==

===Cinematic sources===
The aesthetics of film noir were influenced by German Expressionism, an artistic movement of the 1910s and 1920s that involved theater, music, photography, painting, sculpture and architecture, as well as cinema. The opportunities offered by the booming Hollywood film industry and then the threat of Nazism led to the emigration of many film artists working in Germany who had been involved in the Expressionist movement or studied with its practitioners. &quot;M&quot; (1931), shot only a few years before director Fritz Lang&#x27;s departure from Germany, is among the first crime films of the sound era to join a characteristically noirish visual style with a noir-type plot, in which the protagonist is a criminal (as are his most successful pursuers). Directors such as Lang, Jacques Tourneur, Robert Siodmak and Michael Curtiz brought a dramatically shadowed lighting style and a psychologically expressive approach to visual composition (&quot;mise-en-scène&quot;) with them to Hollywood, where they made some of the most famous classic noirs.

By 1931, Curtiz had already been in Hollywood for half a decade, making as many as six films a year. Movies of his such as &quot;20,000 Years in Sing Sing&quot; (1932) and &quot;Private Detective 62&quot; (1933) are among the early Hollywood sound films arguably classifiable as noir—scholar Marc Vernet offers the latter as evidence that dating the initiation of film noir to 1940 or any other year is &quot;arbitrary&quot;. Expressionism-orientated filmmakers had free stylistic rein in Universal horror pictures such as &quot;Dracula&quot; (1931), &quot;The Mummy&quot; (1932)—the former photographed and the latter directed by the Berlin-trained Karl Freund—and &quot;The Black Cat&quot; (1934), directed by Austrian émigré Edgar G. Ulmer. The Universal horror film that comes closest to noir, in story and sensibility, is &quot;The Invisible Man&quot; (1933), directed by Englishman James Whale and photographed by American Arthur Edeson. Edeson later photographed &quot;The Maltese Falcon&quot; (1941), widely regarded as the first major film noir of the classic era.

Josef von Sternberg was directing in Hollywood during the same period. Films of his such as &quot;Shanghai Express&quot; (1932) and &quot;The Devil Is a Woman&quot; (1935), with their hothouse eroticism and baroque visual style anticipated central elements of classic noir. The commercial and critical success of Sternberg&#x27;s silent &quot;Underworld&quot; (1927) was largely responsible for spurring a trend of Hollywood gangster films. Successful films in that genre such as &quot;Little Caesar&quot; (1931), &quot;The Public Enemy&quot; (1931) and &quot;Scarface&quot; (1932) demonstrated that there was an audience for crime dramas with morally reprehensible protagonists. An important, possibly influential, cinematic antecedent to classic noir was 1930s French poetic realism, with its romantic, fatalistic attitude and celebration of doomed heroes. The movement&#x27;s sensibility is mirrored in the Warner Bros. drama &quot;I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang&quot; (1932), a forerunner of noir. Among films not considered noir, perhaps none had a greater effect on the development of the genre than &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; (1941), directed by Orson Welles. Its visual intricacy and complex, voiceover narrative structure are echoed in dozens of classic films noir.

Italian neorealism of the 1940s, with its emphasis on quasi-documentary authenticity, was an acknowledged influence on trends that emerged in American noir. &quot;The Lost Weekend&quot; (1945), directed by Billy Wilder, another Vienna-born, Berlin-trained American auteur, tells the story of an alcoholic in a manner evocative of neorealism. It also exemplifies the problem of classification: one of the first American films to be described as a film noir, it has largely disappeared from considerations of the field. Director Jules Dassin of &quot;The Naked City&quot; (1948) pointed to the neorealists as inspiring his use of location photography with non-professional extras. This semidocumentary approach characterized a substantial number of noirs in the late 1940s and early 1950s. Along with neorealism, the style had an American precedent cited by Dassin, in director Henry Hathaway&#x27;s &quot;The House on 92nd Street&quot; (1945), which demonstrated the parallel influence of the cinematic newsreel.

===Literary sources===
The primary literary influence on film noir was the hardboiled school of American detective and crime fiction, led in its early years by such writers as Dashiell Hammett (whose first novel, &quot;Red Harvest&quot;, was published in 1929) and James M. Cain (whose &quot;The Postman Always Rings Twice&quot; appeared five years later), and popularized in pulp magazines such as &quot;Black Mask&quot;. The classic film noirs &quot;The Maltese Falcon&quot; (1941) and &quot;The Glass Key&quot; (1942) were based on novels by Hammett; Cain&#x27;s novels provided the basis for &quot;Double Indemnity&quot; (1944), &quot;Mildred Pierce&quot; (1945), &quot;The Postman Always Rings Twice&quot; (1946), and &quot;Slightly Scarlet&quot; (1956; adapted from &quot;Love&#x27;s Lovely Counterfeit&quot;). A decade before the classic era, a story by Hammett was the source for the gangster melodrama &quot;City Streets&quot; (1931), directed by Rouben Mamoulian and photographed by Lee Garmes, who worked regularly with Sternberg. Released the month before Lang&#x27;s &quot;M&quot;, &quot;City Streets&quot; has a claim to being the first major film noir; both its style and story had many noir characteristics.

Raymond Chandler, who debuted as a novelist with &quot;The Big Sleep&quot; in 1939, soon became the most famous author of the hardboiled school. Not only were Chandler&#x27;s novels turned into major noirs—&quot;Murder, My Sweet&quot; (1944; adapted from &quot;Farewell, My Lovely&quot;), &quot;The Big Sleep&quot; (1946), and &quot;Lady in the Lake&quot; (1947)—he was an important screenwriter in the genre as well, producing the scripts for &quot;Double Indemnity&quot;, &quot;The Blue Dahlia&quot; (1946), and &quot;Strangers on a Train&quot; (1951). Where Chandler, like Hammett, centered most of his novels and stories on the character of the private eye, Cain featured less heroic protagonists and focused more on psychological exposition than on crime solving; the Cain approach has come to be identified with a subset of the hardboiled genre dubbed &quot;noir fiction&quot;. For much of the 1940s, one of the most prolific and successful authors of this often downbeat brand of suspense tale was Cornell Woolrich (sometimes under the pseudonym George Hopley or William Irish). No writer&#x27;s published work provided the basis for more noir films of the classic period than Woolrich&#x27;s: thirteen in all, including &quot;Black Angel&quot; (1946), &quot;Deadline at Dawn&quot; (1946), and &quot;Fear in the Night&quot; (1947).

Another crucial literary source for film noir was W. R. Burnett, whose first novel to be published was &quot;Little Caesar&quot;, in 1929. It was turned into a hit for Warner Bros. in 1931; the following year, Burnett was hired to write dialogue for &quot;Scarface&quot;, while &quot;The Beast of the City&quot; (1932) was adapted from one of his stories. At least one important reference work identifies the latter as a film noir despite its early date. Burnett&#x27;s characteristic narrative approach fell somewhere between that of the quintessential hardboiled writers and their noir fiction compatriots—his protagonists were often heroic in their own way, which happened to be that of the gangster. During the classic era, his work, either as author or screenwriter, was the basis for seven films now widely regarded as noir, including three of the most famous: &quot;High Sierra&quot; (1941), &quot;This Gun for Hire&quot; (1942), and &quot;The Asphalt Jungle&quot; (1950).

==Classic period==

===Overview===
The 1940s and 1950s are generally regarded as the classic period of American film noir. While &quot;City Streets&quot; and other pre-WWII crime melodramas such as &quot;Fury&quot; (1936) and &quot;You Only Live Once&quot; (1937), both directed by Fritz Lang, are categorized as full-fledged noir in Alain Silver and Elizabeth Ward&#x27;s film noir encyclopedia, other critics tend to describe them as &quot;proto-noir&quot; or in similar terms.

The film now most commonly cited as the first &quot;true&quot; film noir is &quot;Stranger on the Third Floor&quot; (1940), directed by Latvian-born, Soviet-trained Boris Ingster. Hungarian émigré Peter Lorre—who had starred in Lang&#x27;s &quot;M&quot;—was top-billed, although he did not play the primary lead. (He later played secondary roles in several other formative American noirs.) Although modestly budgeted, at the high end of the B movie scale, &quot;Stranger on the Third Floor&quot; still lost its studio, RKO, US$56,000 (), almost a third of its total cost. &quot;Variety&quot; magazine found Ingster&#x27;s work: &quot;...too studied and when original, lacks the flare to hold attention. It&#x27;s a film too arty for average audiences, and too humdrum for others.&quot; &quot;Stranger on the Third Floor&quot; was not recognized as the beginning of a trend, let alone a new genre, for many decades.
Most film noirs of the classic period were similarly low- and modestly-budgeted features without major stars—B movies either literally or in spirit. In this production context, writers, directors, cinematographers, and other craftsmen were relatively free from typical big-picture constraints. There was more visual experimentation than in Hollywood filmmaking as a whole: the Expressionism now closely associated with noir and the semi-documentary style that later emerged represent two very different tendencies. Narrative structures sometimes involved convoluted flashbacks uncommon in non-noir commercial productions. In terms of content, enforcement of the Production Code ensured that no film character could literally get away with murder or be seen sharing a bed with anyone but a spouse; within those bounds, however, many films now identified as noir feature plot elements and dialogue that were very risqué for the time.
Thematically, films noir were most exceptional for the relative frequency with which they centered on portrayals of women of questionable virtue—a focus that had become rare in Hollywood films after the mid-1930s and the end of the pre-Code era. The signal film in this vein was &quot;Double Indemnity&quot;, directed by Billy Wilder; setting the mold was Barbara Stanwyck&#x27;s femme fatale, Phyllis Dietrichson—an apparent nod to Marlene Dietrich, who had built her extraordinary career playing such characters for Sternberg. An A-level feature, the film&#x27;s commercial success and seven Oscar nominations made it probably the most influential of the early noirs. A slew of now-renowned noir &quot;bad girls&quot; followed, such as those played by Rita Hayworth in &quot;Gilda&quot; (1946), Lana Turner in &quot;The Postman Always Rings Twice&quot; (1946), Ava Gardner in &quot;The Killers&quot; (1946), and Jane Greer in &quot;Out of the Past&quot; (1947). The iconic noir counterpart to the femme fatale, the private eye, came to the fore in films such as &quot;The Maltese Falcon&quot; (1941), with Humphrey Bogart as Sam Spade, and &quot;Murder, My Sweet&quot; (1944), with Dick Powell as Philip Marlowe.

The prevalence of the private eye as a lead character declined in film noir of the 1950s, a period during which several critics describe the form as becoming more focused on extreme psychologies and more exaggerated in general. A prime example is &quot;Kiss Me Deadly&quot; (1955); based on a novel by Mickey Spillane, the best-selling of all the hardboiled authors, here the protagonist is a private eye, Mike Hammer. As described by Paul Schrader, &quot;Robert Aldrich&#x27;s teasing direction carries &quot;noir&quot; to its sleaziest and most perversely erotic. Hammer overturns the underworld in search of the &#x27;great whatsit&#x27; [which] turns out to be—joke of jokes—an exploding atomic bomb.&quot; Orson Welles&#x27;s baroquely styled &quot;Touch of Evil&quot; (1958) is frequently cited as the last noir of the classic period. Some scholars believe film noir never really ended, but continued to transform even as the characteristic noir visual style began to seem dated and changing production conditions led Hollywood in different directions—in this view, post-1950s films in the noir tradition are seen as part of a continuity with classic noir. A majority of critics, however, regard comparable films made outside the classic era to be something other than genuine film noir. They regard true film noir as belonging to a temporally and geographically limited cycle or period, treating subsequent films that evoke the classics as fundamentally different due to general shifts in filmmaking style and latter-day awareness of noir as a historical source for allusion. These later films are often called neo-noir.

===Directors and the business of noir===
While the inceptive noir, &quot;Stranger on the Third Floor&quot;, was a B picture directed by a virtual unknown, many of the films noir still remembered were A-list productions by well-known film makers. Debuting as a director with &quot;The Maltese Falcon&quot; (1941), John Huston followed with &quot;Key Largo&quot; (1948) and &quot;The Asphalt Jungle&quot; (1950). Opinion is divided on the noir status of several Alfred Hitchcock thrillers from the era; at least four qualify by consensus: &quot;Shadow of a Doubt&quot; (1943), &quot;Notorious&quot; (1946), &quot;Strangers on a Train&quot; (1951) and &quot;The Wrong Man&quot; (1956), Otto Preminger&#x27;s success with &quot;Laura&quot; (1944) made his name and helped demonstrate noir&#x27;s adaptability to a high-gloss 20th Century-Fox presentation. Among Hollywood&#x27;s most celebrated directors of the era, arguably none worked more often in a noir mode than Preminger; his other noirs include &quot;Fallen Angel&quot; (1945), &quot;Whirlpool&quot; (1949), &quot;Where the Sidewalk Ends&quot; (1950) (all for Fox) and &quot;Angel Face&quot; (1952). A half-decade after &quot;Double Indemnity&quot; and &quot;The Lost Weekend&quot;, Billy Wilder made &quot;Sunset Boulevard&quot; (1950) and &quot;Ace in the Hole&quot; (1951), noirs that were not so much crime dramas as satires on Hollywood and the news media respectively. &quot;In a Lonely Place&quot; (1950) was Nicholas Ray&#x27;s breakthrough; his other noirs include his debut, &quot;They Live by Night&quot; (1948) and &quot;On Dangerous Ground&quot; (1952), noted for their unusually sympathetic treatment of characters alienated from the social mainstream.
Orson Welles had notorious problems with financing but his three film noirs were well-budgeted: &quot;The Lady from Shanghai&quot; (1947) received top-level, &quot;prestige&quot; backing, while &quot;The Stranger&quot; (1946), his most conventional film, and &quot;Touch of Evil&quot; (1958), an unmistakably personal work, were funded at levels lower but still commensurate with headlining releases. Like &quot;The Stranger&quot;, Fritz Lang&#x27;s &quot;The Woman in the Window&quot; (1944) was a production of the independent International Pictures. Lang&#x27;s follow-up, &quot;Scarlet Street&quot; (1945), was one of the few classic noirs to be officially censored: filled with erotic innuendo, it was temporarily banned in Milwaukee, Atlanta and New York State. &quot;Scarlet Street&quot; was a semi-independent, cosponsored by Universal and Lang&#x27;s Diana Productions, of which the film&#x27;s co-star, Joan Bennett, was the second biggest shareholder. Lang, Bennett and her husband, the Universal veteran and Diana production head Walter Wanger, made &quot;Secret Beyond the Door&quot; (1948) in similar fashion.

Before leaving the United States while subject to the Hollywood blacklist, Jules Dassin made two classic noirs that also straddled the major/independent line: &quot;Brute Force&quot; (1947) and the influential documentary-style &quot;The Naked City&quot; (1948) were developed by producer Mark Hellinger, who had an &quot;inside/outside&quot; contract with Universal similar to Wanger&#x27;s. Years earlier, working at Warner Bros., Hellinger had produced three films for Raoul Walsh, the proto-noirs &quot;They Drive by Night&quot; (1940), &quot;Manpower&quot; (1941) and &quot;High Sierra&quot; (1941), now regarded as a seminal work in noir&#x27;s development. Walsh had no great name during his half-century as a director but his noirs &quot;The Man I Love&quot; (1947), &quot;White Heat&quot; (1949) and &quot;The Enforcer&quot; (1951) had A-list stars and are seen as important examples of the cycle. Other directors associated with top-of-the-bill Hollywood films noir include Edward Dmytryk (&quot;Murder, My Sweet&quot; (1944), &quot;Crossfire&quot; (1947))—the first important noir director to fall prey to the industry blacklist—as well as Henry Hathaway (&quot;The Dark Corner&quot; (1946), &quot;Kiss of Death&quot; (1947)) and John Farrow (&quot;The Big Clock&quot; (1948), &quot;Night Has a Thousand Eyes&quot; (1948)).

Most of the Hollywood films considered to be classic noirs fall into the category of the B movie. Some were Bs in the most precise sense, produced to run on the bottom of double bills by a low-budget unit of one of the major studios or by one of the smaller Poverty Row outfits, from the relatively well-off Monogram to shakier ventures such as Producers Releasing Corporation (PRC). Jacques Tourneur had made over thirty Hollywood Bs (a few now highly regarded, most forgotten) before directing the A-level &quot;Out of the Past&quot;, described by scholar Robert Ottoson as &quot;the &quot;ne plus ultra&quot; of forties film noir&quot;. Movies with budgets a step up the ladder, known as &quot;intermediates&quot; by the industry, might be treated as A or B pictures depending on the circumstances. Monogram created Allied Artists in the late 1940s to focus on this sort of production. Robert Wise (&quot;Born to Kill&quot; [1947], &quot;The Set-Up&quot; [1949]) and Anthony Mann (&quot;T-Men&quot; [1947] and &quot;Raw Deal&quot; [1948]) each made a series of impressive intermediates, many of them noirs, before graduating to steady work on big-budget productions. Mann did some of his most celebrated work with cinematographer John Alton, a specialist in what James Naremore called &quot;hypnotic moments of light-in-darkness&quot;. &quot;He Walked by Night&quot; (1948), shot by Alton though credited solely to Alfred Werker, directed in large part by Mann, demonstrates their technical mastery and exemplifies the late 1940s trend of &quot;police procedural&quot; crime dramas. It was released, like other Mann-Alton noirs, by the small Eagle-Lion company; it was the inspiration for the &quot;Dragnet&quot; series, which debuted on radio in 1949 and television in 1951.
Several directors associated with noir built well-respected oeuvres largely at the B-movie/intermediate level. Samuel Fuller&#x27;s brutal, visually energetic films such as &quot;Pickup on South Street&quot; (1953) and &quot;Underworld U.S.A.&quot; (1961) earned him a unique reputation; his advocates praise him as &quot;primitive&quot; and &quot;barbarous&quot;. Joseph H. Lewis directed noirs as diverse as &quot;Gun Crazy&quot; (1950) and &quot;The Big Combo&quot; (1955). The former—whose screenplay was written by the blacklisted Dalton Trumbo, disguised by a front—features a bank hold-up sequence shown in an unbroken take of over three minutes that was influential. &quot;The Big Combo&quot; was shot by John Alton and took the shadowy noir style to its outer limits. The most distinctive films of Phil Karlson (&quot;The Phenix City Story&quot; [1955] and &quot;The Brothers Rico&quot; [1957]) tell stories of vice organized on a monstrous scale. The work of other directors in this tier of the industry, such as Felix E. Feist (&quot;The Devil Thumbs a Ride&quot; [1947], &quot;Tomorrow Is Another Day&quot; [1951]), has become obscure. Edgar G. Ulmer spent most of his Hollywood career working at B studios and once in a while on projects that achieved intermediate status; for the most part, on unmistakable Bs. In 1945, while at PRC, he directed a noir cult classic, &quot;Detour&quot;. Ulmer&#x27;s other noirs include &quot;Strange Illusion&quot; (1945), also for PRC; &quot;Ruthless&quot; (1948), for Eagle-Lion, which had acquired PRC the previous year and &quot;Murder Is My Beat&quot; (1955), for Allied Artists.

A number of low- and modestly-budgeted noirs were made by independent, often actor-owned, companies contracting with larger studios for distribution. Serving as producer, writer, director and top-billed performer, Hugo Haas made films like &quot;Pickup&quot; (1951), &quot;The Other Woman&quot; (1954) and Jacques Tourneur, &quot;The Fearmakers (1958)&quot;. It was in this way that accomplished noir actress Ida Lupino established herself as the sole female director in Hollywood during the late 1940s and much of the 1950s. She does not appear in the best-known film she directed, &quot;The Hitch-Hiker&quot; (1953), developed by her company, The Filmakers, with support and distribution by RKO. It is one of the seven classic film noirs produced largely outside of the major studios that have been chosen for the United States National Film Registry. Of the others, one was a small-studio release: &quot;Detour&quot;. Four were independent productions distributed by United Artists, the &quot;studio without a studio&quot;: &quot;Gun Crazy&quot;; &quot;Kiss Me Deadly&quot;; &quot;D.O.A.&quot; (1950), directed by Rudolph Maté and &quot;Sweet Smell of Success&quot; (1957), directed by Alexander Mackendrick. One was an independent distributed by MGM, the industry leader: &quot;Force of Evil&quot; (1948), directed by Abraham Polonsky and starring John Garfield, both of whom were blacklisted in the 1950s. Independent production usually meant restricted circumstances but &quot;Sweet Smell of Success&quot;, despite the plans of the production team, was clearly not made on the cheap, though like many other cherished A-budget noirs, it might be said to have a B-movie soul.

Perhaps no director better displayed that spirit than the German-born Robert Siodmak, who had already made a score of films before his 1940 arrival in Hollywood. Working mostly on A features, he made eight films now regarded as classic-era noir (a figure matched only by Lang and Mann). In addition to &quot;The Killers&quot;, Burt Lancaster&#x27;s debut and a Hellinger/Universal co-production, Siodmak&#x27;s other important contributions to the genre include 1944&#x27;s &quot;Phantom Lady&quot; (a top-of-the-line B and Woolrich adaptation), the ironically titled &quot;Christmas Holiday&quot; (1944), and &quot;Cry of the City&quot; (1948). &quot;Criss Cross&quot; (1949), with Lancaster again the lead, exemplifies how Siodmak brought the virtues of the B-movie to the A noir. In addition to the relatively looser constraints on character and message at lower budgets, the nature of B production lent itself to the noir style for economic reasons: dim lighting saved on electricity and helped cloak cheap sets (mist and smoke also served the cause). Night shooting was often compelled by hurried production schedules. Plots with obscure motivations and intriguingly elliptical transitions were sometimes the consequence of hastily written scripts. There was not always enough time or money to shoot every scene. In &quot;Criss Cross&quot;, Siodmak achieved these effects, wrapping them around Yvonne De Carlo, who played the most understandable of femme fatales; Dan Duryea, in one of his many charismatic villain roles; and Lancaster as an ordinary laborer turned armed robber, doomed by a romantic obsession.

==Outside the United States==

Some critics regard classic film noir as a cycle exclusive to the United States; Alain Silver and Elizabeth Ward, for example, argue, &quot;With the Western, film noir shares the distinction of being an indigenous American form ... a wholly American film style.&quot; However, although the term &quot;film noir&quot; was originally coined to describe Hollywood movies, it was an international phenomenon. Even before the beginning of the generally accepted classic period, there were films made far from Hollywood that can be seen in retrospect as films noir, for example, the French productions &quot;Pépé le Moko&quot; (1937), directed by Julien Duvivier, and &quot;Le Jour se lève&quot; (1939), directed by Marcel Carné. In addition, Mexico experienced a vibrant film noir period from roughly 1946 to 1952, which was around the same time film noir was blossoming in the United States.

During the classic period, there were many films produced in Europe, particularly in France, that share elements of style, theme, and sensibility with American films noir and may themselves be included in the genre&#x27;s canon. In certain cases, the interrelationship with Hollywood noir is obvious: American-born director Jules Dassin moved to France in the early 1950s as a result of the Hollywood blacklist, and made one of the most famous French film noirs, &quot;Rififi&quot; (1955). Other well-known French films often classified as noir include &quot;Quai des Orfèvres&quot; (1947) and &quot;Les Diaboliques&quot; (1955), both directed by Henri-Georges Clouzot. &quot;Casque d&#x27;Or&quot; (1952), &quot;Touchez pas au grisbi&quot; (1954), and &quot;Le Trou&quot; (1960) directed by Jacques Becker; and &quot;Ascenseur pour l&#x27;échafaud&quot; (1958), directed by Louis Malle. French director Jean-Pierre Melville is widely recognized for his tragic, minimalist films noir—&quot;Bob le flambeur&quot; (1955), from the classic period, was followed by &quot;Le Doulos&quot; (1962), &quot;Le deuxième souffle&quot; 1966), &quot;Le Samouraï&quot; (1967), and &quot;Le Cercle rouge&quot; (1970). In the 1960s, Greek films noir &quot;&quot;The Secret of the Red Mantle&quot; and &quot;The Fear&quot;&quot; allowed audience for an anti-ableist reading which challenged stereotypes of disability. .
Scholar Andrew Spicer argues that British film noir evidences a greater debt to French poetic realism than to the expressionistic American mode of noir. Examples of British noir (sometimes described as &quot;Brit noir&quot;) from the classic period include &quot;Brighton Rock&quot; (1947), directed by John Boulting; &quot;They Made Me a Fugitive&quot; (1947), directed by Alberto Cavalcanti; &quot;The Small Back Room&quot; (1948), directed by Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger; &quot;The October Man&quot; (1947), directed by Roy Ward Baker; and &quot;Cast a Dark Shadow&quot; (1955), directed by Lewis Gilbert. Terence Fisher directed several low-budget thrillers in a noir mode for Hammer Film Productions, including &quot;The Last Page&quot; (a.k.a. &quot;Man Bait&quot;; 1952), &quot;Stolen Face&quot; (1952), and &quot;Murder by Proxy&quot; (a.k.a. &quot;Blackout&quot;; 1954). Before leaving for France, Jules Dassin had been obliged by political pressure to shoot his last English-language film of the classic noir period in Great Britain: &quot;Night and the City&quot; (1950). Though it was conceived in the United States and was not only directed by an American but also stars two American actors—Richard Widmark and Gene Tierney—it is technically a UK production, financed by 20th Century-Fox&#x27;s British subsidiary. The most famous of classic British noirs is director Carol Reed&#x27;s &quot;The Third Man&quot; (1949), from a screenplay by Graham Greene. Set in Vienna immediately after World War II, it also stars two American actors, Joseph Cotten and Orson Welles, who had appeared together in &quot;Citizen Kane&quot;.

Elsewhere, Italian director Luchino Visconti adapted Cain&#x27;s &quot;The Postman Always Rings Twice&quot; as &quot;Ossessione&quot; (1943), regarded both as one of the great noirs and a seminal film in the development of neorealism. (This was not even the first screen version of Cain&#x27;s novel, having been preceded by the French &quot;Le Dernier Tournant&quot; in 1939.) In Japan, the celebrated Akira Kurosawa directed several films recognizable as films noir, including &quot;Drunken Angel&quot; (1948), &quot;Stray Dog&quot; (1949), &quot;The Bad Sleep Well&quot; (1960), and &quot;High and Low&quot; (1963). Spanish author Mercedes Formica&#x27;s novel &quot;La ciudad perdida&quot; (The Lost City) was adapted into film in 1960.

Among the first major neo-noir films—the term often applied to films that consciously refer back to the classic noir tradition—was the French &quot;Tirez sur le pianiste&quot; (1960), directed by François Truffaut from a novel by one of the gloomiest of American noir fiction writers, David Goodis. Noir crime films and melodramas have been produced in many countries in the post-classic area. Some of these are quintessentially self-aware neo-noirs—for example, &quot;Il Conformista&quot; (1969; Italy), &quot;Der Amerikanische Freund&quot; (1977; Germany), &quot;The Element of Crime&quot; (1984; Denmark), and &quot;El Aura&quot; (2005; Argentina). Others simply share narrative elements and a version of the hardboiled sensibility associated with classic noir, such as &quot;Castle of Sand&quot; (1974; Japan), &quot;Insomnia&quot; (1997; Norway), &quot;Croupier&quot; (1998; UK), and &quot;Blind Shaft&quot; (2003; China).

==Neo-noir and echoes of the classic mode==

The neo-noir film genre developed mid-way into the Cold War. This cinematological trend reflected much of the cynicism and the possibility of nuclear annihilation of the era. This new genre introduced innovations that were not available to earlier noir films. The violence was also more potent.

===1960s and 1970s===
While it is hard to draw a line between some of the noir films of the early 1960s such as &quot;Blast of Silence&quot; (1961) and &quot;Cape Fear&quot; (1962) and the noirs of the late 1950s, new trends emerged in the post-classic era. &quot;The Manchurian Candidate&quot; (1962), directed by John Frankenheimer, &quot;Shock Corridor&quot; (1963), directed by Samuel Fuller, and &quot;Brainstorm&quot; (1965), directed by experienced noir character actor William Conrad, all treat the theme of mental dispossession within stylistic and tonal frameworks derived from classic film noir. &quot;The Manchurian Candidate&quot; examined the situation of American prisoners of war (POWs) during the Korean War. Incidents that occurred during the war as well as those post-war functioned as an inspiration for a &quot;Cold War Noir&quot; subgenre. The television series &quot;The Fugitive&quot; (1963–67) brought classic noir themes and mood to the small screen for an extended run.
In a different vein, films began to appear that self-consciously acknowledged the conventions of classic film noir as historical archetypes to be revived, rejected, or reimagined. These efforts typify what came to be known as neo-noir. Though several late classic noirs, &quot;Kiss Me Deadly&quot; (1955) in particular, were deeply self-knowing and post-traditional in conception, none tipped its hand so evidently as to be remarked on by American critics at the time. The first major film to overtly work this angle was French director Jean-Luc Godard&#x27;s &quot;À bout de souffle&quot; (&quot;Breathless&quot;; 1960), which pays its literal respects to Bogart and his crime films while brandishing a bold new style for a new day. In the United States, Arthur Penn (1965&#x27;s &quot;Mickey One&quot;, drawing inspiration from Truffaut&#x27;s &quot;Tirez sur le pianiste&quot; and other French New Wave films), John Boorman (1967&#x27;s &quot;Point Blank&quot;, similarly caught up, though in the &quot;Nouvelle vague&#x27;&quot;s deeper waters), and Alan J. Pakula (1971&#x27;s &quot;Klute&quot;) directed films that knowingly related themselves to the original films noir, inviting audiences in on the game.

A manifest affiliation with noir traditions—which, by its nature, allows different sorts of commentary on them to be inferred—can also provide the basis for explicit critiques of those traditions. In 1973, director Robert Altman flipped off noir piety with &quot;The Long Goodbye&quot;. Based on the novel by Raymond Chandler, it features one of Bogart&#x27;s most famous characters, but in iconoclastic fashion: Philip Marlowe, the prototypical hardboiled detective, is replayed as a hapless misfit, almost laughably out of touch with contemporary mores and morality. Where Altman&#x27;s subversion of the film noir mythos was so irreverent as to outrage some contemporary critics, around the same time Woody Allen was paying affectionate, at points idolatrous homage to the classic mode with &quot;Play It Again, Sam&quot; (1972). The &quot;blaxploitation&quot; film &quot;Shaft&quot; (1971), wherein Richard Roundtree plays the titular African-American private eye, John Shaft, takes conventions from classic noir.

The most acclaimed of the neo-noirs of the era was director Roman Polanski&#x27;s 1974 &quot;Chinatown&quot;. Written by Robert Towne, it is set in 1930s Los Angeles, an accustomed noir locale nudged back some few years in a way that makes the pivotal loss of innocence in the story even crueler. Where Polanski and Towne raised noir to a black apogee by turning rearward, director Martin Scorsese and screenwriter Paul Schrader brought the noir attitude crashing into the present day with &quot;Taxi Driver&quot; (1976), a crackling, bloody-minded gloss on bicentennial America. In 1978, Walter Hill wrote and directed &quot;The Driver&quot;, a chase film as might have been imagined by Jean-Pierre Melville in an especially abstract mood.

Hill was already a central figure in 1970s noir of a more straightforward manner, having written the script for director Sam Peckinpah&#x27;s &quot;The Getaway&quot; (1972), adapting a novel by pulp master Jim Thompson, as well as for two tough private eye films: an original screenplay for &quot;Hickey &amp; Boggs&quot; (1972) and an adaptation of a novel by Ross Macdonald, the leading literary descendant of Hammett and Chandler, for &quot;The Drowning Pool&quot; (1975). Some of the strongest 1970s noirs, in fact, were unwinking remakes of the classics, &quot;neo&quot; mostly by default: the heartbreaking &quot;Thieves Like Us&quot; (1974), directed by Altman from the same source as Ray&#x27;s &quot;They Live by Night&quot;, and &quot;Farewell, My Lovely&quot; (1975), the Chandler tale made classically as &quot;Murder, My Sweet&quot;, remade here with Robert Mitchum in his last notable noir role. Detective series, prevalent on American television during the period, updated the hardboiled tradition in different ways, but the show conjuring the most noir tone was a horror crossover touched with shaggy, &quot;Long Goodbye&quot;-style humor: &quot;&quot; (1974–75), featuring a Chicago newspaper reporter investigating strange, usually supernatural occurrences.

===1980s and 1990s===
The turn of the decade brought Scorsese&#x27;s black-and-white &quot;Raging Bull&quot; (1980, cowritten by Schrader). An acknowledged masterpiecein 2007 the American Film Institute ranked it as the greatest American film of the 1980s and the fourth greatest of all timeit tells the story of a boxer&#x27;s moral self-destruction that recalls in both theme and visual ambiance noir dramas such as &quot;Body and Soul&quot; (1947) and &quot;Champion&quot; (1949). From 1981, &quot;Body Heat&quot;, written and directed by Lawrence Kasdan, invokes a different set of classic noir elements, this time in a humid, erotically charged Florida setting. Its success confirmed the commercial viability of neo-noir at a time when the major Hollywood studios were becoming increasingly risk averse. The mainstreaming of neo-noir is evident in such films as &quot;Black Widow&quot; (1987), &quot;Shattered&quot; (1991), and &quot;Final Analysis&quot; (1992). Few neo-noirs have made more money or more wittily updated the tradition of the noir double entendre than &quot;Basic Instinct&quot; (1992), directed by Paul Verhoeven and written by Joe Eszterhas. The film also demonstrates how neo-noir&#x27;s polychrome palette can reproduce many of the expressionistic effects of classic black-and-white noir.

Like &quot;Chinatown&quot;, its more complex predecessor, Curtis Hanson&#x27;s Oscar-winning &quot;L.A. Confidential&quot; (1997), based on the James Ellroy novel, demonstrates the opposite tendency—the deliberately retro film noir; its tale of corrupt cops and femmes fatale is seemingly lifted straight from a film of 1953, the year in which it is set. Director David Fincher followed the immensely successful neo-noir &quot;Seven&quot; (1995) with a film that developed into a cult favorite after its original, disappointing release: &quot;Fight Club&quot; (1999), a &quot;sui generis&quot; mix of noir aesthetic, perverse comedy, speculative content, and satiric intent.

Working generally with much smaller budgets, brothers Joel and Ethan Coen have created one of the most extensive oeuvres influenced by classic noir, with films such as &quot;Blood Simple&quot; (1984) and &quot;Fargo&quot; (1996), the latter considered by some a supreme work in the neo-noir mode. The Coens cross noir with other generic traditions in the gangster drama &quot;Miller&#x27;s Crossing&quot; (1990)—loosely based on the Dashiell Hammett novels &quot;Red Harvest&quot; and &quot;The Glass Key&quot;—and the comedy &quot;The Big Lebowski&quot; (1998), a tribute to Chandler and an homage to Altman&#x27;s version of &quot;The Long Goodbye&quot;. The characteristic work of David Lynch combines film noir tropes with scenarios driven by disturbed characters such as the sociopathic criminal played by Dennis Hopper in &quot;Blue Velvet&quot; (1986) and the delusionary protagonist of &quot;Lost Highway&quot; (1997). The &quot;Twin Peaks&quot; cycle, both the TV series (1990–91) and a film, &quot;Fire Walk with Me&quot; (1992), puts a detective plot through a succession of bizarre spasms. David Cronenberg also mixes surrealism and noir in &quot;Naked Lunch&quot; (1991), inspired by William S. Burroughs&#x27; novel.

Perhaps no American neo-noirs better reflect the classic noir B movie spirit than those of director-writer Quentin Tarantino. Neo-noirs of his such as &quot;Reservoir Dogs&quot; (1992) and &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; (1994) display a relentlessly self-reflexive, sometimes tongue-in-cheek sensibility, similar to the work of the New Wave directors and the Coens. Other films from the era readily identifiable as neo-noir (some retro, some more au courant) include director John Dahl&#x27;s &quot;Kill Me Again&quot; (1989), &quot;Red Rock West&quot; (1992), and &quot;The Last Seduction&quot; (1993); four adaptations of novels by Jim Thompson—&quot;The Kill-Off&quot; (1989), &quot;After Dark, My Sweet&quot; (1990), &quot;The Grifters&quot; (1990), and the remake of &quot;The Getaway&quot; (1994); and many more, including adaptations of the work of other major noir fiction writers: &quot;The Hot Spot&quot; (1990), from &quot;Hell Hath No Fury&quot;, by Charles Williams; &quot;Miami Blues&quot; (1990), from the novel by Charles Willeford; and &quot;Out of Sight&quot; (1998), from the novel by Elmore Leonard. Several films by director-writer David Mamet involve noir elements: &quot;House of Games&quot; (1987), &quot;Homicide&quot; (1991), &quot;The Spanish Prisoner&quot; (1997), and &quot;Heist&quot; (2001). On television, &quot;Moonlighting&quot; (1985–89) paid homage to classic noir while demonstrating an unusual appreciation of the sense of humor often found in the original cycle. Between 1983 and 1989, Mickey Spillane&#x27;s hardboiled private eye Mike Hammer was played with wry gusto by Stacy Keach in a series and several stand-alone television films (an unsuccessful revival followed in 1997–98). The British miniseries &quot;The Singing Detective&quot; (1986), written by Dennis Potter, tells the story of a mystery writer named Philip Marlow; widely considered one of the finest neo-noirs in any medium, some critics rank it among the greatest television productions of all time.

===Neon-noir===
Among big-budget auteurs, Michael Mann has worked frequently in a neo-noir mode, with such films as &quot;Thief&quot; (1981) and &quot;Heat&quot; (1995) and the TV series &quot;Miami Vice&quot; (1984–89) and &quot;Crime Story&quot; (1986–88). Mann&#x27;s output exemplifies a primary strain of neo-noir, or as it is affectionately called, &quot;neon noir&quot;, in which classic themes and tropes are revisited in a contemporary setting with an up-to-date visual style and rock- or hip hop-based musical soundtrack.

Neo-noir film borrows from and reflects many of the characteristics of the film noir: the presence of crime and violence, complex characters and plot-lines, mystery, and moral ambivalence, all of which come into play in the neon-noir sub-genre. But more than just exhibiting the superficial traits of the genre, neon-noir emphasizes the socio-critique of film noir, recalling the specific socio-cultural dimensions of the interwar years when noirs first became prominent; a time of global existential crisis, depression and the mass movement of the rural population to cities. Long shots or montages of cityscapes, often portrayed as dark and menacing, are suggestive of what Dueck referred to as a ‘bleak societal perspective’, providing a critique on global capitalism and consumerism. Other characteristics include the use of highly stylized lighting techniques such chiaroscuro, and neon signs and brightly lit buildings that provide a sense of alienation and entrapment.

Accentuating the use of artificial and neon lighting in the films-noir of the &#x27;40s and &#x27;50s, neon-noir films accentuate this aesthetic with electrifying color and manipulated light in order to highlight their socio-cultural critiques and their references to contemporary and pop culture. In doing so, neon-noir films present the themes of urban decay, consumerist decadence and capitalism, existentialism, sexuality, and issues of race and violence in the contemporary culture, not only in America, but the globalized world at large.

Neon-noirs seek to bring the contemporary noir, somewhat diluted under the umbrella of neo-noir, back to the exploration of culture: class, race, gender, patriarchy, and capitalism. Neon-noirs present an existential exploration of society in a hyper-technological and globalized world. Illustrating society as decadent and consumerist, and identity as confused and anxious, neon-noirs reposition the contemporary noir in the setting of urban decay, often featuring scenes set in underground city haunts: brothels, nightclubs, casinos, strip bars, pawnshops, laundromats.

Neon-noirs were popularized in the &#x27;70s and &#x27;80s by films such as &quot;Taxi Driver&quot; (1976), &quot;Blade Runner&quot; (1982), and films from David Lynch, such as &quot;Blue Velvet&quot; (1986) and later, &quot;Lost Highway&quot; (1997). Other titles from this era included Brian De Palma&#x27;s &quot;Blow Out&quot; (1981) and the Coen Brothers&#x27; debut &quot;Blood Simple&quot; (1984). More currently, films such as Harmony Korine’s highly provocative &quot;Spring Breakers&quot; (2012), and Danny Boyle’s &quot;Trance&quot; (2013) have been especially noted for their neon-infused rendering of film noir; while &quot;Trance&quot; was celebrated for ‘shak(ing) the ingredients (of the noir) like colored sand in a jar’, &quot;Spring Breakers&quot; notoriously produced a slew of criticism referring to its ‘fever-dream’ aesthetic and ‘neon-caked explosion of excess’ (Kohn).

Neon-noir can be seen as a response to the over-use of the term neo-noir. While the term neo-noir functions to bring noir into the contemporary landscape, it has often been criticized for its dilution of the noir genre. Author Robert Arnett commented on its &quot;amorphous&quot; reach: &quot;any film featuring a detective or crime qualifies&quot;. The neon-noir, more specifically, seeks to revive noir sensibilities in a more targeted manner of reference, focalizing socio-cultural commentary and a hyper-stylized aesthetic.

===2000s and 2010s===
The Coen brothers make reference to the noir tradition again with &quot;The Man Who Wasn&#x27;t There&quot; (2001); a black-and-white crime melodrama set in 1949; it features a scene apparently staged to mirror one from &quot;Out of the Past&quot;. Lynch&#x27;s &quot;Mulholland Drive&quot; (2001) continued in his characteristic vein, making the classic noir setting of Los Angeles the venue for a noir-inflected psychological jigsaw puzzle. British-born director Christopher Nolan&#x27;s black-and-white debut, &quot;Following&quot; (1998), was an overt homage to classic noir. During the new century&#x27;s first decade, he was one of the leading Hollywood directors of neo-noir with the acclaimed &quot;Memento&quot; (2000) and the remake of &quot;Insomnia&quot; (2002).

Director Sean Penn&#x27;s &quot;The Pledge&quot; (2001), though adapted from a very self-reflexive novel by Friedrich Dürrenmatt, plays noir comparatively straight, to devastating effect. Screenwriter David Ayer updated the classic noir bad-cop tale, typified by &quot;Shield for Murder&quot; (1954) and &quot;Rogue Cop&quot; (1954), with his scripts for &quot;Training Day&quot; (2001) and, adapting a story by James Ellroy, &quot;Dark Blue&quot; (2002); he later wrote and directed the even darker &quot;Harsh Times&quot; (2006). Michael Mann&#x27;s &quot;Collateral&quot; (2004) features a performance by Tom Cruise as an assassin in the lineage of &quot;Le Samouraï&quot;. The torments of &quot;The Machinist&quot; (2004), directed by Brad Anderson, evoke both &quot;Fight Club&quot; and &quot;Memento&quot;. In 2005, Shane Black directed &quot;Kiss Kiss Bang Bang&quot;, basing his screenplay in part on a crime novel by Brett Halliday, who published his first stories back in the 1920s. The film plays with an awareness not only of classic noir but also of neo-noir reflexivity itself.

With ultra-violent films such as &quot;Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance&quot; (2002) and &quot;Thirst&quot; (2009), Park Chan-wook of South Korea has been the most prominent director outside of the United States to work regularly in a noir mode in the new millennium. The most commercially successful neo-noir of this period has been &quot;Sin City&quot; (2005), directed by Robert Rodriguez in extravagantly stylized black and white with splashes of color. The film is based on a series of comic books created by Frank Miller (credited as the film&#x27;s codirector), which are in turn openly indebted to the works of Spillane and other pulp mystery authors. Similarly, graphic novels provide the basis for &quot;Road to Perdition&quot; (2002), directed by Sam Mendes, and &quot;A History of Violence&quot; (2005), directed by David Cronenberg; the latter was voted best film of the year in the annual &quot;Village Voice&quot; poll. Writer-director Rian Johnson&#x27;s &quot;Brick&quot; (2005), featuring present-day high schoolers speaking a version of 1930s hardboiled argot, won the Special Jury Prize for Originality of Vision at the Sundance Film Festival. The television series &quot;Veronica Mars&quot; (2004–07, 2019) and the movie &quot;Veronica Mars&quot; (2014) also brought a youth-oriented twist to film noir. Examples of this sort of generic crossover have been dubbed &quot;teen noir&quot;.

Neo-noir films released in the 2010s include Kim Jee-woon’s &quot;I Saw the Devil&quot; (2010), Fred Cavaye’s &quot;Point Blank&quot; (2010), Na Hong-jin’s &quot;The Yellow Sea&quot; (2010), Nicolas Winding Refn’s &quot;Drive&quot; (2011), Claire Denis&#x27; &quot;Bastards&quot; (2013) and Dan Gilroy&#x27;s &quot;Nightcrawler&quot; (2014).

===2020s===
The Science Channel broadcast the 2021 science documentary series &quot;Killers of the Cosmos&quot; in a format it describes as &quot;space noir.&quot; In the series, actor Aidan Gillen in animated form serves as the host of the series while portraying a private investigator who takes on &quot;cases&quot; in which he &quot;hunts down&quot; lethal threats to humanity posed by the cosmos. The animated sequences combine the characteristics of film noir with those of a pulp fiction graphic novel set in the mid-20th century, and they link conventional live-action documentary segments in which experts describe the potentially deadly phenomena.

===Science fiction noir===

In the post-classic era, a significant trend in noir crossovers has involved science fiction. In Jean-Luc Godard&#x27;s &quot;Alphaville&quot; (1965), Lemmy Caution is the name of the old-school private eye in the city of tomorrow. &quot;The Groundstar Conspiracy&quot; (1972) centers on another implacable investigator and an amnesiac named Welles. &quot;Soylent Green&quot; (1973), the first major American example, portrays a dystopian, near-future world via a noir detection plot; starring Charlton Heston (the lead in &quot;Touch of Evil&quot;), it also features classic noir standbys Joseph Cotten, Edward G. Robinson, and Whit Bissell. The film was directed by Richard Fleischer, who two decades before had directed several strong B noirs, including &quot;Armored Car Robbery&quot; (1950) and &quot;The Narrow Margin&quot; (1952).

The cynical and stylized perspective of classic film noir had a formative effect on the cyberpunk genre of science fiction that emerged in the early 1980s; the film most directly influential on cyberpunk was &quot;Blade Runner&quot; (1982), directed by Ridley Scott, which pays evocative homage to the classic noir mode (Scott subsequently directed the poignant 1987 noir crime melodrama &quot;Someone to Watch Over Me&quot;). Scholar Jamaluddin Bin Aziz has observed how &quot;the shadow of Philip Marlowe lingers on&quot; in such other &quot;future noir&quot; films as &quot;12 Monkeys&quot; (1995), &quot;Dark City&quot; (1998) and &quot;Minority Report&quot; (2002). Fincher&#x27;s feature debut was &quot;Alien 3&quot; (1992), which evoked the classic noir jail film &quot;Brute Force&quot;.

David Cronenberg&#x27;s &quot;Crash&quot; (1996), an adaptation of the speculative novel by J. G. Ballard, has been described as a &quot;film noir in bruise tones&quot;. The hero is the target of investigation in &quot;Gattaca&quot; (1997), which fuses film noir motifs with a scenario indebted to &quot;Brave New World&quot;. &quot;The Thirteenth Floor&quot; (1999), like &quot;Blade Runner&quot;, is an explicit homage to classic noir, in this case involving speculations about virtual reality. Science fiction, noir, and anime are brought together in the Japanese films of 90s &quot;Ghost in the Shell&quot; (1995) and &quot;Ghost in the Shell 2: Innocence&quot; (2004), both directed by Mamoru Oshii. &quot;The Animatrix&quot; (2003), based on and set within the world of &quot;The Matrix&quot; film trilogy, contains an anime short film in classic noir style titled &quot;A Detective Story&quot;. Anime television series with science fiction noir themes include &quot;Noir&quot; (2001) and &quot;Cowboy Bebop&quot; (1998).

The 2015 film &quot;Ex Machina&quot; puts an understated film noir spin on the Frankenstein mythos, with the sentient android Ava as a potential &quot;femme fatale&quot;, her creator Nathan embodying the abusive husband or father trope, and her would-be rescuer Caleb as a &quot;clueless drifter&quot; enthralled by Ava.
===Rural/outback noir===
A sub-genre of noir fiction has been named &quot;rural noir&quot; in the US; and sometimes &quot;outback noir&quot; in Australia. Many rural noir novels have been adapted for film and TV series in both countries, such as &quot;Ozark&quot;, &quot;No Country for Old Men&quot;, and &quot;Big Sky&quot; in the US, and &quot;Troppo&quot;, &quot;The Dry&quot; (and its sequel &quot;Force of Nature: The Dry 2&quot;), &quot;Scrublands&quot;, and &quot;High Country&quot; (2024) in Australia.

In Australia, outback noir increasingly includes issues relating to Indigenous Australians, such as the dispossession of land from Aboriginal peoples and racism. Filmmaker Ivan Sen is known for his exploration of such themes in his &quot;Mystery Road&quot; TV series and film of the same name with its prequel &quot;Goldstone&quot;, and his more recent award-winning film &quot;Limbo&quot; (2023).

==Parodies==
Film noir has been parodied many times in many manners. In 1945, Danny Kaye starred in what appears to be the first intentional film noir parody, &quot;Wonder Man&quot;. That same year, Deanna Durbin was the singing lead in the comedic noir &quot;Lady on a Train&quot;, which makes fun of Woolrich-brand wistful miserablism. Bob Hope inaugurated the private-eye noir parody with &quot;My Favorite Brunette&quot; (1947), playing a baby-photographer who is mistaken for an ironfisted detective. In 1947 as well, The Bowery Boys appeared in &quot;Hard Boiled Mahoney&quot;, which had a similar mistaken-identity plot; they spoofed the genre once more in &quot;Private Eyes&quot; (1953). Two RKO productions starring Robert Mitchum take film noir over the border into self-parody: &quot;The Big Steal&quot; (1949), directed by Don Siegel, and &quot;His Kind of Woman&quot; (1951). The &quot;Girl Hunt&quot; ballet in Vincente Minnelli&#x27;s &quot;The Band Wagon&quot; (1953) is a ten-minute distillation of—and play on—noir in dance. &quot;The Cheap Detective&quot; (1978), starring Peter Falk, is a broad spoof of several films, including the Bogart classics &quot;The Maltese Falcon&quot; and &quot;Casablanca&quot;. Carl Reiner&#x27;s black-and-white &quot;Dead Men Don&#x27;t Wear Plaid&quot; (1982) appropriates clips of classic noirs for a farcical pastiche, while his &quot;Fatal Instinct&quot; (1993) sends up noir classic (&quot;Double Indemnity&quot;) and neo-noir (&quot;Basic Instinct&quot;). Robert Zemeckis&#x27;s &quot;Who Framed Roger Rabbit&quot; (1988) develops a noir plot set in 1940s Los Angeles around a host of cartoon characters.

Noir parodies come in darker tones as well. &quot;Murder by Contract&quot; (1958), directed by Irving Lerner, is a deadpan joke on noir, with a denouement as bleak as any of the films it kids. An ultra-low-budget Columbia Pictures production, it may qualify as the first intentional example of what is now called a neo-noir film; it was likely a source of inspiration for both Melville&#x27;s &quot;Le Samouraï&quot; and Scorsese&#x27;s &quot;Taxi Driver&quot;. Belying its parodic strain, &quot;The Long Goodbye&quot;″s final act is seriously grave. &quot;Taxi Driver&quot; caustically deconstructs the &quot;dark&quot; crime film, taking it to an absurd extreme and then offering a conclusion that manages to mock every possible anticipated ending—triumphant, tragic, artfully ambivalent—while being each, all at once. Flirting with splatter status even more brazenly, the Coens&#x27; &quot;Blood Simple&quot; is both an exacting pastiche and a gross exaggeration of classic noir. Adapted by director Robinson Devor from a novel by Charles Willeford, &quot;The Woman Chaser&quot; (1999) sends up not just the noir mode but the entire Hollywood filmmaking process, with each shot seemingly staged as the visual equivalent of an acerbic Marlowe wisecrack.

In other media, the television series &quot;Sledge Hammer!&quot; (1986–88) lampoons noir, along with such topics as capital punishment, gun fetishism, and Dirty Harry. &quot;Sesame Street&quot; (1969–curr.) occasionally casts Kermit the Frog as a private eye; the sketches refer to some of the typical motifs of noir films, in particular the voiceover. Garrison Keillor&#x27;s radio program &quot;A Prairie Home Companion&quot; features the recurring character Guy Noir, a hardboiled detective whose adventures always wander into farce (Guy also appears in the Altman-directed film based on Keillor&#x27;s show). Firesign Theatre&#x27;s Nick Danger has trodden the same not-so-mean streets, both on radio and in comedy albums. Cartoons such as &quot;Garfield&#x27;s Babes and Bullets&quot; (1989) and comic strip characters such as Tracer Bullet of &quot;Calvin and Hobbes&quot; have parodied both film noir and the kindred hardboiled tradition—one of the sources from which film noir sprang and which it now overshadows. &quot;It&#x27;s Always Sunny in Philadelphia&quot; parodied the noir genre in its season 14 episode &quot;The Janitor Always Mops Twice.&quot;

==Identifying characteristics==
In their original 1955 canon of film noir, Raymond Borde and Etienne Chaumeton identified twenty-two Hollywood films released between 1941 and 1952 as core examples; they listed another fifty-nine American films from the period as significantly related to the field of noir. A half-century later, film historians and critics had come to agree on a canon of approximately three hundred films from 1940 to 1958. There remain, however, many differences of opinion over whether other films of the era, among them a number of well-known ones, qualify as films noir or not. For instance, &quot;The Night of the Hunter&quot; (1955), starring Robert Mitchum in an acclaimed performance, is treated as a film noir by some critics, but not by others. Some critics include &quot;Suspicion&quot; (1941), directed by Alfred Hitchcock, in their catalogues of noir; others ignore it. Concerning films made either before or after the classic period, or outside of the United States at any time, consensus is even rarer.

To support their categorization of certain films as noirs and their rejection of others, many critics refer to a set of elements they see as marking examples of the mode. The question of what constitutes the set of noir&#x27;s identifying characteristics is a fundamental source of controversy. For instance, critics tend to define the model film noir as having a tragic or bleak conclusion, but many acknowledged classics of the genre have clearly happy endings (e.g., &quot;Stranger on the Third Floor,&quot; &quot;The Big Sleep&quot;, &quot;Dark Passage&quot;, and &quot;The Dark Corner&quot;), while the tone of many other noir denouements is ambivalent. Some critics perceive classic noir&#x27;s hallmark as a distinctive visual style. Others, observing that there is actually considerable stylistic variety among noirs, instead emphasize plot and character type. Still others focus on mood and attitude. No survey of classic noir&#x27;s identifying characteristics can therefore be considered definitive. In the 1990s and 2000s, critics have increasingly turned their attention to that diverse field of films called neo-noir; once again, there is even less consensus about the defining attributes of such films made outside the classic period. Roger Ebert offered &quot;A Guide to Film Noir&quot;, writing that &quot;Film noir is...

# A French term meaning &#x27;black film&#x27;, or film of the night, inspired by the Series Noir, a line of cheap paperbacks that translated hard-boiled American crime authors and found a popular audience in France
# A movie which at no time misleads you into thinking there is going to be a happy ending.
# Locations that reek of the night, of shadows, of alleys, of the back doors of fancy places, of apartment buildings with a high turnover rate, of taxi drivers and bartenders who have seen it all.
# Cigarettes. Everyone in film noir is always smoking, as if to say, &#x27;On top of everything else, I&#x27;ve been assigned to get through three packs today. The best smoking movie of all time is &quot;Out of the Past&quot;, in which Robert Mitchum and Kirk Douglas smoke furiously at each other. At one point, Mitchum enters a room, Douglas extends a pack and says &#x27;Cigarette?&#x27; and Mitchum, holding up his hand, says, &#x27;Smoking.&#x27;
# Women who would just as soon kill you as love you, and vice versa. 
# For women: low necklines, floppy hats, mascara, lipstick, dressing rooms, boudoirs, calling the doorman by his first name, high heels, red dresses, elbowlength gloves, mixing drinks, having gangsters as boyfriends, having soft spots for alcoholic private eyes, wanting a lot of someone else&#x27;s women, sprawling dead on the floor with every limb meticulously arranged and every hair in place.
# For men: fedoras, suits and ties, shabby residential hotels with a neon sign blinking through the window, buying yourself a drink out of the office bottle, cars with running boards, all-night diners, protecting kids who shouldn&#x27;t be playing with the big guys, being on first-name terms with homicide cops, knowing a lot of people whose descriptions end in &#x27;ies,&#x27; such as bookies, newsies, junkies, alkys, jockeys and cabbies.
# Movies either shot in black-and-white, or feeling like they were. 
# Relationships in which love is only the final flop card in the poker game of death. 
# The most American film genre, because no other society could have created a world so full of doom, fate, fear and betrayal, unless it were essentially naive and optimistic.&quot;

===Visual style===
The low-key lighting schemes of many classic films noir are associated with stark light/dark contrasts and dramatic shadow patterning—a style known as chiaroscuro (a term adopted from Renaissance painting). The shadows of Venetian blinds or banister rods, cast upon an actor, a wall, or an entire set, are an iconic visual in noir and had already become a cliché well before the neo-noir era. Characters&#x27; faces may be partially or wholly obscured by darkness—a relative rarity in conventional Hollywood filmmaking. While black-and-white cinematography is considered by many to be one of the essential attributes of classic noir, the color films &quot;Leave Her to Heaven&quot; (1945) and &quot;Niagara&quot; (1953) are routinely included in noir filmographies, while &quot;Slightly Scarlet&quot; (1956), &quot;Party Girl&quot; (1958), and &quot;Vertigo&quot; (1958) are classified as noir by varying numbers of critics.

Film noir is also known for its use of low-angle, wide-angle, and skewed, or Dutch angle shots. Other devices of disorientation relatively common in film noir include shots of people reflected in one or more mirrors, shots through curved or frosted glass or other distorting objects (such as during the strangulation scene in &quot;Strangers on a Train&quot;), and special effects sequences of a sometimes bizarre nature. Night-for-night shooting, as opposed to the Hollywood norm of day-for-night, was often employed. From the mid-1940s forward, location shooting became increasingly frequent in noir.

In an analysis of the visual approach of &quot;Kiss Me Deadly&quot;, a late and self-consciously stylized example of classic noir, critic Alain Silver describes how cinematographic choices emphasize the story&#x27;s themes and mood. In one scene, the characters, seen through a &quot;confusion of angular shapes&quot;, thus appear &quot;caught in a tangible vortex or enclosed in a trap.&quot; Silver makes a case for how &quot;side light is used ... to reflect character ambivalence&quot;, while shots of characters in which they are lit from below &quot;conform to a convention of visual expression which associates shadows cast upward of the face with the unnatural and ominous&quot;.

===Structure and narrational devices===
Films noir tend to have unusually convoluted story lines, frequently involving flashbacks and other editing techniques that disrupt and sometimes obscure the narrative sequence. Framing the entire primary narrative as a flashback is also a standard device. Voiceover narration, sometimes used as a structuring device, came to be seen as a noir hallmark; while classic noir is generally associated with first-person narration (i.e., by the protagonist), Stephen Neale notes that third-person narration is common among noirs of the semidocumentary style. Neo-noirs as varied as &quot;The Element of Crime&quot; (surrealist), &quot;After Dark, My Sweet&quot; (retro), and &quot;Kiss Kiss Bang Bang&quot; (meta) have employed the flashback/voiceover combination.

Bold experiments in cinematic storytelling were sometimes attempted during the classic era: &quot;Lady in the Lake&quot;, for example, is shot entirely from the point of view of protagonist Philip Marlowe; the face of star (and director) Robert Montgomery is seen only in mirrors. &quot;The Chase&quot; (1946) takes oneirism and fatalism as the basis for its fantastical narrative system, redolent of certain horror stories, but with little precedent in the context of a putatively realistic genre. In their different ways, both &quot;Sunset Boulevard&quot; and &quot;D.O.A.&quot; are tales told by dead men. Latter-day noir has been in the forefront of structural experimentation in popular cinema, as exemplified by such films as &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot;, &quot;Fight Club&quot;, and &quot;Memento&quot;.

===Plots, characters, and settings===
Crime, usually murder, is an element of almost all films noir; in addition to standard-issue greed, jealousy is frequently the criminal motivation. A crime investigation—by a private eye, a police detective (sometimes acting alone), or a concerned amateur—is the most prevalent, but far from dominant, basic plot. In other common plots the protagonists are implicated in heists or con games, or in murderous conspiracies often involving adulterous affairs. False suspicions and accusations of crime are frequent plot elements, as are betrayals and double-crosses. According to J. David Slocum, &quot;protagonists assume the literal identities of dead men in nearly fifteen percent of all noir.&quot; Amnesia is fairly epidemic—&quot;noir&#x27;s version of the common cold&quot;, in the words of film historian Lee Server.

Films noir tend to revolve around heroes who are more flawed and morally questionable than the norm, often fall guys of one sort or another. The characteristic protagonists of noir are described by many critics as &quot;alienated&quot;; in the words of Silver and Ward, &quot;filled with existential bitterness&quot;. Certain archetypal characters appear in many film noirs—hardboiled detectives, femme fatales, corrupt policemen, jealous husbands, intrepid claims adjusters, and down-and-out writers. Among characters of every stripe, cigarette smoking is rampant. From historical commentators to neo-noir pictures to pop culture ephemera, the private eye and the femme fatale have been adopted as the quintessential film noir figures, though they do not appear in most films now regarded as classic noir. Of the twenty-six National Film Registry noirs, in only four does the star play a private eye: &quot;The Maltese Falcon&quot;, &quot;The Big Sleep&quot;, &quot;Out of the Past&quot;, and &quot;Kiss Me Deadly&quot;. Just four others readily qualify as detective stories: &quot;Laura&quot;, &quot;The Killers&quot;, &quot;The Naked City&quot;, and &quot;Touch of Evil&quot;. There is usually an element of drug or alcohol use, particularly as part of the detective&#x27;s method to solving the crime, as an example the character of Mike Hammer in the 1955 film &quot;Kiss Me Deadly&quot; who walks into a bar saying &quot;Give me a double bourbon, and leave the bottle&quot;. Chaumeton and Borde have argued that film noir grew out of the &quot;literature of drugs and alcohol&quot;.

Film noir is often associated with an urban setting, and a few cities—Los Angeles, San Francisco, New York, and Chicago, in particular—are the location of many of the classic films. In the eyes of many critics, the city is presented in noir as a &quot;labyrinth&quot; or &quot;maze&quot;. Bars, lounges, nightclubs, and gambling dens are frequently the scene of action. The climaxes of a substantial number of film noirs take place in visually complex, often industrial settings, such as refineries, factories, trainyards, power plants—most famously the explosive conclusion of &quot;White Heat&quot;, set at a chemical plant. In the popular (and, frequently enough, critical) imagination, in noir it is always night and it always raining.

A substantial trend within latter-day noir—dubbed &quot;film soleil&quot; by critic D. K. Holm—heads in precisely the opposite direction, with tales of deception, seduction, and corruption exploiting bright, sun-baked settings, stereotypically the desert or open water, to searing effect. Significant predecessors from the classic and early post-classic eras include &quot;The Lady from Shanghai&quot;; the Robert Ryan vehicle &quot;Inferno&quot; (1953); the French adaptation of Patricia Highsmith&#x27;s &quot;The Talented Mr. Ripley&quot;, &quot;Plein soleil&quot; (&quot;Purple Noon&quot; in the United States, more accurately rendered elsewhere as &quot;Blazing Sun&quot; or &quot;Full Sun&quot;; 1960); and director Don Siegel&#x27;s version of &quot;The Killers&quot; (1964). The tendency was at its peak during the late 1980s and 1990s, with films such as &quot;Dead Calm&quot; (1989), &quot;After Dark, My Sweet&quot; (1990), &quot;The Hot Spot&quot; (1990), &quot;Delusion&quot; (1991), &quot;Red Rock West&quot; (1993) and the television series &quot;Miami Vice&quot;.

===Worldview, morality, and tone===
Film noir is often described as essentially pessimistic. The noir stories that are regarded as most characteristic tell of people trapped in unwanted situations (which, in general, they did not cause but are responsible for exacerbating), striving against random, uncaring fate, and are frequently doomed. The films are seen as depicting a world that is inherently corrupt. Classic film noir has been associated by many critics with the American social landscape of the era—in particular, with a sense of heightened anxiety and alienation that is said to have followed World War II. In author Nicholas Christopher&#x27;s opinion, &quot;it is as if the war, and the social eruptions in its aftermath, unleashed demons that had been bottled up in the national psyche.&quot; Films noir, especially those of the 1950s and the height of the Red Scare, are often said to reflect cultural paranoia; &quot;Kiss Me Deadly&quot; is the noir most frequently marshaled as evidence for this claim.

Film noir is often said to be defined by &quot;moral ambiguity&quot;, yet the Production Code obliged almost all classic noirs to see that steadfast virtue was ultimately rewarded and vice, in the absence of shame and redemption, severely punished (however dramatically incredible the final rendering of mandatory justice might be). A substantial number of latter-day noirs flout such conventions: vice emerges triumphant in films as varied as the grim &quot;Chinatown&quot; and the ribald &quot;Hot Spot&quot;.

The tone of film noir is generally regarded as downbeat; some critics experience it as darker still—&quot;overwhelmingly black&quot;, according to Robert Ottoson. Influential critic (and filmmaker) Paul Schrader wrote in a seminal 1972 essay that &quot;&quot;film noir&quot; is defined by tone&quot;, a tone he seems to perceive as &quot;hopeless&quot;. In describing the adaptation of &quot;Double Indemnity,&quot; noir analyst Foster Hirsch describes the &quot;requisite hopeless tone&quot; achieved by the filmmakers, which appears to characterize his view of noir as a whole. On the other hand, definitive film noirs such as &quot;The Big Sleep&quot;, &quot;The Lady from Shanghai&quot;, &quot;Scarlet Street&quot; and &quot;Double Indemnity&quot; itself are famed for their hardboiled repartee, often imbued with sexual innuendo and self-reflexive humor.

=== Music ===
The music of film noir was typically orchestral, per the Hollywood norm, but often with added dissonance. Many of the prime composers, like the directors and cameramen, were European émigrés, e.g., Max Steiner (&quot;The Big Sleep&quot;, &quot;Mildred Pierce&quot;), Miklós Rózsa (&quot;Double Indemnity&quot;, &quot;The Killers&quot;, &quot;Criss Cross&quot;), and Franz Waxman (&quot;Fury&quot;, &quot;Sunset Boulevard&quot;, &quot;Night and the City&quot;). &quot;Double Indemnity&quot; is a seminal score, initially disliked by Paramount&#x27;s music director for its harshness but strongly endorsed by director Billy Wilder and studio chief Buddy DeSylva. There is a widespread popular impression that &quot;sleazy&quot; jazz saxophone and pizzicato bass constitute the sound of noir, but those characteristics arose much later, as in the late-1950s music of Henry Mancini for &quot;Touch of Evil&quot; and television&#x27;s &quot;Peter Gunn&quot;. Bernard Herrmann&#x27;s score for &quot;Taxi Driver&quot; makes heavy use of saxophone.

<doc id="10803" wikidata="Q79890" url="?curid=10803" title="Finno-Ugric languages">
<text>Finno-Ugric () is a traditional linguistic grouping of all languages in the Uralic language family except for the Samoyedic languages. Its once commonly accepted status as a subfamily of Uralic is based on criteria formulated in the 19th century and is criticized by some contemporary linguists such as Tapani Salminen and Ante Aikio. The three most spoken Uralic languages, Hungarian, Finnish, and Estonian, are all included in Finno-Ugric.

The term &quot;Finno-Ugric&quot;, which originally referred to the entire family, is sometimes used as a synonym for the term &quot;Uralic&quot;, which includes the Samoyedic languages, as commonly happens when a language family is expanded with further discoveries. Before the 20th century, the language family might be referred to as &quot;Finnish&quot;, &quot;Ugric&quot;, &quot;Finno-Hungarian&quot; or with a variety of other names. The name &quot;Finno-Ugric&quot; came into general use in the late 19th or early 20th century.

==Status==
The validity of Finno-Ugric as a phylogenic grouping is currently disputed, with some linguists maintaining that the Finno-Permic languages are as distinct from the Ugric languages as they are from the Samoyedic languages spoken in Siberia, or even that none of the Finno-Ugric, Finno-Permic, or Ugric branches has been established. Received opinion is that the easternmost (and last discovered) Samoyed had separated first and the branching into Ugric and Finno-Permic took place later, but this reconstruction does not have strong support in the linguistic data.

==Origins==

Attempts at reconstructing a Proto-Finno-Ugric proto-language, a common ancestor of all Uralic languages except for the Samoyedic languages, are largely indistinguishable from Proto-Uralic, suggesting that Finno-Ugric might not be a historical grouping but a geographical one, with Samoyedic being distinct by lexical borrowing rather than actually being historically divergent. It has been proposed that the area in which Proto-Finno-Ugric was spoken reached between the Baltic Sea and the Ural Mountains.

Traditionally, the main set of evidence for the genetic proposal of Proto-Finno-Ugric has come from vocabulary. A large amount of vocabulary (e.g. the numerals &quot;one&quot;, &quot;three&quot;, &quot;four&quot; and &quot;six&quot;; the body-part terms &quot;hand&quot;, &quot;head&quot;) is only reconstructed up to the Proto-Finno-Ugric level, and only words with a Samoyedic equivalent have been reconstructed for Proto-Uralic. That methodology has been criticised, as no coherent explanation other than inheritance has been presented for the origin of most of the Finno-Ugric vocabulary (though a small number has been explained as old loanwords from Proto-Indo-European or its immediate successors).

The Samoyedic group has undergone a longer period of independent development, and its divergent vocabulary could be caused by mechanisms of replacement such as language contact. (The Finno-Ugric group is usually dated to approximately 4,000 years ago, the Samoyedic a little over 2,000.) Proponents of the traditional binary division note, however, that the invocation of extensive contact influence on vocabulary is at odds with the grammatical conservatism of Samoyedic.

The consonant &quot;*š&quot; (voiceless postalveolar fricative, ) has not been conclusively shown to occur in the traditional Proto-Uralic lexicon, but it is attested in some of the Proto-Finno-Ugric material. Another feature attested in the Finno-Ugric vocabulary is that &quot;*i&quot; now behaves as a neutral vowel with respect to front-back vowel harmony, and thus there are roots such as &quot;*niwa-&quot; &quot;to remove the hair from hides&quot;.

Regular sound changes proposed for this stage are few and remain open to interpretation. Sammallahti (1988) proposes five, following Janhunen&#x27;s (1981) reconstruction of Proto-Finno-Permic:
* Compensatory lengthening: development of long vowels from the cluster of vowel plus a particular syllable-final element, of unknown quality, symbolized by &quot;*x&quot;
** Long open &quot;*aa&quot; and &quot;*ää&quot; are then raised to mid &quot;*oo&quot; and &quot;*ee&quot; respectively.
*** E.g. &quot;*ńäxli-&quot; → &quot;*ńääli-&quot; → &quot;*ńeeli-&quot; &quot;to swallow&quot; (→ Finnish &quot;niele-&quot;, Hungarian &quot;nyel&quot; etc.)
* Raising of short &quot;*o&quot; to &quot;*u&quot; in open syllables before a subsequent &quot;*i&quot;
* Shortening of long vowels in closed syllables and before a subsequent open vowel &quot;*a&quot;, &quot;*ä&quot;, predating the raising of &quot;*ää&quot; and &quot;*ee&quot;
** E.g. &quot;*ńäxl+mä&quot; → &quot;*ńäälmä&quot; → &quot;*ńälmä&quot; &quot;tongue&quot; (→ Northern Sámi &quot;njalbmi&quot;, Hungarian &quot;nyelv&quot;, etc.)
Sammallahti (1988) further reconstructs sound changes &quot;*oo&quot;, &quot;*ee&quot; → &quot;*a&quot;, &quot;*ä&quot; (merging with original &quot;*a&quot;, &quot;*ä&quot;) for the development from Proto-Finno-Ugric to Proto-Ugric. Similar sound laws are required for other languages as well. Thus, the origin and raising of long vowels may actually belong at a later stage, and the development of these words from Proto-Uralic to Proto-Ugric can be summarized as simple loss of &quot;*x&quot; (if it existed in the first place at all; vowel length only surfaces consistently in the Baltic-Finnic languages.) The proposed raising of &quot;*o&quot; has been alternatively interpreted instead as a lowering &quot;*u&quot; → &quot;*o&quot; in Samoyedic (PU *&quot;lumi&quot; → &quot;*lomə&quot; → Proto-Samoyedic &quot;*jom&quot;).

Janhunen (2007, 2009) notes a number of derivational innovations in Finno-Ugric, including &quot;*ńoma&quot; &quot;hare&quot; → &quot;*ńoma-la&quot;, (vs. Samoyedic &quot;*ńomå&quot;), &quot;*pexli&quot; &quot;side&quot; → &quot;*peel-ka&quot; → &quot;*pelka&quot; &quot;thumb&quot;, though involving Proto-Uralic derivational elements.

==Structural features==

The Finno-Ugric group is not typologically distinct from Uralic as a whole: the most widespread structural features among the group all extend to the Samoyedic languages as well.

==Classification models==
Modern linguistic research has shown that &quot;Volgaic languages&quot; is a geographical classification rather than a linguistic one, because the Mordvinic languages are more closely related to the Finno-Samic languages than the Mari languages.

The relation of the Finno-Permic and the Ugric groups is adjudged remote by some scholars. On the other hand, with a projected time depth of only 3,000 to 4,000 years, the traditionally accepted Finno-Ugric grouping would be far younger than many major families such as Indo-European or Semitic, and would be about the same age as, for instance, the Eastern subfamily of Nilotic. But the grouping is far from transparent or securely established. The absence of early records is a major obstacle. As for the Finno-Ugric &quot;Urheimat&quot;, most of what has been said about it is speculation.

Some linguists criticizing the Finno-Ugric genetic proposal, especially Angela Marcantonio, also question the validity of the entire Uralic family, instead proposing a Ural–Altaic hypothesis, within which they believe Finno-Permic may be as distant from Ugric as from Turkic. However, this approach has been rejected by nearly all other specialists in Uralic linguistics.

==Common vocabulary==

===Loanwords===
One argument in favor of the Finno-Ugric grouping has come from loanwords. Several loans from the Indo-European languages are present in most or all of the Finno-Ugric languages, while being absent from Samoyedic.

According to Häkkinen (1983) the alleged Proto-Finno-Ugric loanwords are disproportionally well-represented in Hungarian and the Permic languages, and disproportionally poorly represented in the Ob-Ugric languages; hence it is possible that such words have been acquired by the languages only after the initial dissolution of the Uralic family into individual dialects, and that the scarcity of loanwords in Samoyedic results from its peripheric location.

===Numbers===
The number systems among the Finno-Ugric languages are particularly distinct from the Samoyedic languages: only the numerals &quot;2&quot;, &quot;5&quot;, and &quot;7&quot; have cognates in Samoyedic, while also the numerals, &quot;1&quot;, &quot;3&quot;, &quot;4&quot;, &quot;6&quot;, &quot;10&quot; are shared by all or most Finno-Ugric languages.

Below are the numbers 1 to 10 in several Finno-Ugric languages. Forms in &quot;italic&quot; do not descend from the reconstructed forms.

The number &#x27;2&#x27; descends in Ugric from a front-vocalic variant *kektä.

The numbers &#x27;9&#x27; and &#x27;8&#x27; in Finnic through Mari are considered to be derived from the numbers &#x27;1&#x27; and &#x27;2&#x27; as &#x27;10–1&#x27; and &#x27;10–2&#x27;. One reconstruction is *&quot;yk+teksa&quot; and *&quot;kak+teksa&quot;, respectively, where *&quot;teksa&quot; cf. &quot;deka&quot; is an Indo-European loan; the difference between /t/ and /d/ is not phonemic, unlike in Indo-European. Another analysis is *&quot;ykt-e-ksa&quot;, *&quot;kakt-e-ksa&quot;, with *&quot;e&quot; being the negative verb.

===Finno-Ugric Swadesh lists===
100-word Swadesh lists for certain Finno-Ugric languages can be compared and contrasted at the Rosetta Project website:
Finnish, Estonian, Hungarian, and Erzya.

==Speakers==
The four largest ethnic groups that speak Finno-Ugric languages are the Hungarians (14.5 million), Finns (6.5 million), Estonians (1.1 million), and Mordvins (0.85 million). Majorities of three (the Hungarians, Finns, and Estonians) inhabit their respective nation states in Europe, i.e. Hungary, Finland, and Estonia, while a large minority of Mordvins inhabit the federal Mordovian Republic within Russia (Russian Federation).

The indigenous area of the Sámi people is known as Sápmi and it consists of the northern parts of the Fennoscandian Peninsula. Some other peoples that speak Finno-Ugric languages have been assigned formerly autonomous republics within Russia. These are the Karelians (Republic of Karelia), Komi (Komi Republic), Udmurts (Udmurt Republic) and Mari (Mari El Republic). The Khanty-Mansi Autonomous Okrug was set up for the Khanty and Mansi of Russia. A once-autonomous Komi-Permyak Okrug was set up for a region of high Komi habitation outside the Komi Republic.

Some of the ethnicities speaking Finno-Ugric languages are:

===International Finno-Ugric societies===

In the Finno-Ugric countries of Finland, Estonia and Hungary that find themselves surrounded by speakers of unrelated tongues, language origins and language history have long been relevant to national identity. In 1992, the 1st &quot;World Congress of Finno-Ugric Peoples&quot; was organized in Syktyvkar in the Komi Republic in Russia, the 2nd World Congress in 1996 in Budapest in Hungary, the 3rd Congress in 2000 in Helsinki in Finland, the 4th Congress in 2004 in Tallinn in Estonia, the 5th Congress in 2008 in Khanty-Mansiysk in Russia, the 6th Congress in 2012 in Siófok in Hungary, the 7th Congress in 2016 in Lahti in Finland, and the 8th Congress in 2021 in Tartu in Estonia. The members of the Finno-Ugric Peoples&#x27; Consultative Committee include: the Erzyas, Estonians, Finns, Hungarians, Ingrian Finns, Ingrians, Karelians, Khants, Komis, Mansis, Maris, Mokshas, Nenetses, Permian Komis, Saamis, Tver Karelians, Udmurts, Vepsians; Observers: Livonians, Setos.

In 2007, the 1st &quot;Festival of the Finno-Ugric Peoples&quot; was hosted by President Vladimir Putin of Russia, and visited by Finnish President, Tarja Halonen, and Hungarian Prime Minister, Ferenc Gyurcsány.

The International Finno-Ugric Students&#x27; Conference (IFUSCO) is organised annually by students of Finno-Ugric languages to bring together people from all over the world who are interested in the languages and cultures. The first conference was held in 1984 in Göttingen in Germany. IFUSCO features presentations and workshops on topics such as linguistics, ethnography, history and more.

The International Congress for Finno-Ugric Studies is the largest scientific meeting of scientists studying the culture and languages of Finno-Ugric peoples, held every five years. The first congress was organized in 1960 in Budapest, the last congress took place in 2022 in Vienna, the next congress is planned to be held in Tartu, Estonia in 2025.

===Population genetics===
The linguistic reconstruction of the Finno-Ugric language family has led to the postulation that the ancient Proto-Finno-Ugric people were ethnically related, and that even the modern Finno-Ugric-speaking peoples are ethnically related. Such hypotheses are based on the assumption that heredity can be traced through linguistic relatedness, although it must be kept in mind that language shift and ethnic admixture, a relatively frequent and common occurrence both in recorded history and most likely also in prehistory, confuses the picture and there is no straightforward relationship, if at all, between linguistic and genetic affiliation. Still, the premise that the speakers of the ancient proto-language were ethnically homogeneous is generally accepted.

Modern genetic studies have shown that the Y-chromosome haplogroup N3, and sometimes N2, is almost specific though certainly not restricted to Uralic- or Finno-Ugric-speaking populations, especially as high frequency or primary paternal haplogroup. These haplogroups branched from haplogroup N, which probably spread north, then west and east from Northern China about 12,000–14,000 years before present from father haplogroup NO (haplogroup O being the most common Y-chromosome haplogroup in Southeast Asia).

A study of the Finno-Ugric-speaking peoples of northern Eurasia (i.e., excluding the Hungarians), carried out between 2002 and 2008 in the Department of Forensic Medicine at the University of Helsinki, showed that the Finno-Ugric-speaking populations do not retain genetic evidence of a common founder. Most possess an amalgamation of West and East Eurasian gene pools that may have been present in central Asia, with subsequent genetic drift and recurrent founder effects among speakers of various branches of Finno-Ugric. Not all branches show evidence of a single founder effect. North Eurasian Finno-Ugric-speaking populations were found to be genetically a heterogeneous group showing lower haplotype diversities compared to more southern populations. North Eurasian Finno-Ugric-speaking populations possess unique genetic features due to complex genetic changes shaped by molecular and population genetics and adaptation to the areas of Boreal and Arctic North Eurasia.

<text>Freestyle, or Latin freestyle (initially called Latin hip hop) is a form of electronic dance music that emerged in the New York metropolitan area, Philadelphia, and Miami, primarily among Black Americans, Hispanic Americans, and Italian Americans. 

An important precursor to freestyle is 1982&#x27;s &quot;Planet Rock&quot; by Afrika Bambaataa &amp; Soul Sonic Force. Shannon&#x27;s 1983 hit &quot;Let the Music Play&quot; is often considered the first freestyle song and the first major song recorded by a Latin American artist is &quot;Please Don&#x27;t Go&quot; by Nayobe from 1984. From there, freestyle gained a large presence in American clubs, especially in New York and Miami. Radio airplay followed in the mid-1980s.

Performers such as Exposé, Lisa Lisa and Cult Jam, Stevie B and Sweet Sensation gained mainstream chart success with the genre in the late 1980s and early 1990s, but its popularity largely faded by the end of the decade. Both classic and newer freestyle output remain popular as a niche genre in Brazil (where it is an influence on &quot;funk carioca&quot;), Germany and Canada.

==History==
===1982–1987: Origin===
Freestyle music developed in the early 1980s, primarily simultaneously in the Hispanic (mainly Puerto Rican/Afro-Latin) communities of Upper Manhattan and The Bronx and in the Italian-American communities in Brooklyn, the Bronx, other boroughs of New York City, New Jersey, Westchester County and Long Island. It initially was a fusion of synthetic instrumentation and syncopated percussion of 1980s electro, as favored by fans of breakdancing. Sampling, as found in synth-pop music and hip-hop, was incorporated. Key influences include Afrika Bambaataa &amp; Soul Sonic Force&#x27;s &quot;Planet Rock&quot; (1982) and Shannon&#x27;s &quot;Let the Music Play&quot; (1983), the latter was a top-ten &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 hit. 

In 1984, a Latin presence was established when the first song recorded in the genre by a Latin American artist, &quot;Please Don&#x27;t Go&quot;, by newcomer Nayobe (a singer from Brooklyn and of Afro-Cuban descent) was recorded and released. The song became a success, reaching No. 23 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart. In 1985, a Spanish version of the song was released with the title &quot;No Te Vayas&quot;. By 1987, freestyle began getting more airplay on American pop radio stations. Songs such as &quot;Come Go with Me&quot; by Exposé, &quot;Show Me&quot; by the Cover Girls, &quot;Fascinated&quot; by Company B, &quot;Silent Morning&quot; by Noel, and &quot;Catch Me (I&#x27;m Falling)&quot; by Pretty Poison, brought freestyle into the mainstream. House music, based partly on disco rhythms, was by 1992 challenging the relatively upbeat, syncopated freestyle sound. Pitchfork considers the Miami Mix of ABC&#x27;s single &quot;When Smokey Sings&quot; to be proto-freestyle, despite that version being released in 1987. 

Many early or popular freestyle artists and DJs were of Hispanic or Italian descent, including Jellybean, Tony Torres, Raul Soto, Roman Ricardo, Mickey Garcia (who is of both Italian and Puerto Rican descent), Lil Suzy, and Nocera, which was one reason for the style&#x27;s popularity among Hispanic Americans and Italian Americans in the New York City area and Philadelphia.

===1988: Pop crossover===
Freestyle&#x27;s Top 40 Radio airplay started to really take off by 1987, and it began to disappear from the airwaves in the early 1990s as radio stations moved to Top 40-only formats. Artists such as George Lamond, Exposé, Sweet Sensation, and Stevie B were still heard on mainstream radio, but other notable freestyle artists did not fare as well. Carlos Berrios and Platinum producer Frankie Cutlass used a freestyle production on &quot;Temptation&quot; by Corina and &quot;Together Forever&quot; by Lisette Melendez. The songs were released in 1991, almost simultaneously, and caused a resurgence in the style when they were embraced by Top 40 radio. &quot;Temptation&quot; reached the number 6 spot on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 Chart. These hits were followed by the success of Lisa Lisa and Cult Jam, who had been one of the earliest freestyle acts. Their records were produced by Full Force, who had also worked with UTFO and James Brown.

Several primarily freestyle artists released ballads during the 1980s and early 1990s that crossed over to the pop charts and charted higher than their previous work. These include &quot;Seasons Change&quot; by Exposé, &quot;Thinking of You&quot; by Sa-Fire, &quot;One More Try&quot; by Timmy T, &quot;Because I Love You (The Postman Song)&quot; by Stevie B, and &quot;If Wishes Came True&quot; by Sweet Sensation. Brenda K. Starr reached the Hot 100 with her ballad &quot;I Still Believe&quot;. Freestyle shortly thereafter gave way to mainstream pop artists such as MC Hammer, Paula Abdul, Bobby Brown, New Kids on the Block, and Milli Vanilli (with some artists utilizing elements of freestyle beginning in the 1980s) using hip hop beats and electro samples in a mainstream form with slicker production and MTV-friendly videos. These artists were successful on crossover stations as well as R&amp;B stations, and freestyle was replaced as an underground genre by newer styles such as new jack swing, trance and Eurodance. Despite this, some freestyle acts managed to garner hits well into the 1990s, with acts such as Cynthia and Rockell scoring minor hits on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 as late as 1998. As this new music style took over many big cities in America, the labels that signed these artists such as Columbia, Warner Bros, and other labels did not know how to market these artists originally. Instead of pushing this style of music as a solidified sound, the labels separated the cities. This caused the Miami sound of freestyle music to be more popularized through the radio compared to NYC&#x27;s sound at the time. The labels who pushed out low quality tracks ended up hurting themselves, instead of making the track a quality piece of music. This is part of the reason freestyle music never reached its full potential.

===Post-freestyle era===

Freestyle remained a largely underground genre with a sizable following in New York, but has recently seen a comeback in the cities where the music originally experienced its greatest success. New York City impresario Steve Sylvester and producer Sal Abbatiello of Fever Records launched Stevie Sly&#x27;s Freestyle Party show at the Manhattan live music venue, Coda on April 1, 2004. The show featured Judy Torres, Cynthia, and the Cover Girls and was attended by several celebrity guests. The Coda show was successful, and was followed by a summer 2006 Madison Square Garden concert that showcased freestyle&#x27;s most successful performers. New freestyle releases are popular with enthusiasts and newcomers alike. Miami rapper Pitbull collaborated with Miami freestyle artist Stevie B to create an updated version of Stevie B&#x27;s hit, &quot;Spring Love&quot;.

Currently, freestyle music continues to have a thriving fanbase in certain parts of the country, with New York City Italian-American DJs such as Bad Boy Joe and Louie DeVito helping to maintain an active freestyle scene in the NYC metro area. In cities like New York, Miami, and Los Angeles, recent concerts by freestyle artists have been extremely successful, with many events selling out.

==Influence on other genres==
===NYC hard house===

As Latin freestyle in the late 1980s and early 1990s gradually became superseded with house music, dance-pop, and regular hip hop on one front and Spanish-language pop music with marginal Latin freestyle influences on another, &quot;harder strain&quot; of house music originating in New York City was known to incorporate elements of Latin freestyle and the old school hip hop sound. Principal architects of the genre were Todd Terry (early instances include &quot;Alright Alright,&quot; and &quot;Dum Dum Cry&quot;) and Nitro Deluxe. Deluxe&#x27;s &quot;This Brutal House,&quot; fusing Latin percussion and the New York electro sound of Man Parrish with brash house music, proved to have an impact on the United Kingdom&#x27;s club music scene, presaging the early 1990s British rave scene.

===Terminology===
The genre was recognized as a subgenre of hip-hop in the mid-1980s. It was dominated by &quot;hard&quot; electro beats of the type used primarily at the time in hip-hop music. Freestyle was more appreciated in larger cities.

==Freestyle scenes==
===New York===
&quot;Let the Music Play&quot; by Shannon, is often named as the genre&#x27;s first hit, and its sound, called &quot;The Shannon Sound&quot;, as the foundation of the genre, although also known as the beginnings of the electro genre which then gave birth to techno. Afrika Bambaataa&#x27;s &quot;Planet Rock&quot; was arguably the first freestyle song produced. &quot;Let the Music Play&quot; eventually became freestyle&#x27;s biggest hit, and still receives frequent airplay. Its producers Chris Barbosa and Mark Liggett changed and redefined the electro funk sound with the addition of Latin-American rhythms and a syncopated drum-machine sound.

In March 2013, Radio City Music Hall hosted a freestyle concert. Top freestyle artists included in the line-up were TKA, Safire, Judy Torres, Cynthia, Cover Girls, Lisa Lisa, Shannon, Noel, and Lisette Melendez. Originally scheduled as a one-night event, a second night was added shortly after the first night was sold out in a matter of days.

===Miami===
Radio stations nationwide began to play hits by artists like TKA, Sweet Sensation, Exposé, and Sa-Fire on the same playlists as Michael Jackson and Madonna. &quot;(You Are My) All and All&quot; by Joyce Sims became the first freestyle record to cross over into the R&amp;B market, and was one of the first to reach the European market. Radio station WPOW/Power 96 was noted for exposing freestyle to South Florida in the mid-&#x27;80s through the early &#x27;90s, as well as mixing in some local Miami bass into its playlist.

&#x27;Pretty Tony&#x27; Butler produced several hits on Miami&#x27;s Jam-Packed Records, including Debbie Deb&#x27;s &quot;When I Hear Music&quot; and &quot;Lookout Weekend&quot;, and Trinere&#x27;s &quot;I&#x27;ll Be All You&#x27;ll Ever Need&quot; and &quot;They&#x27;re Playing Our Song&quot;. Company B, Stevie B, Paris by Air, Linear, Will to Power and Exposé&#x27;s later hits defined Miami freestyle. Tolga Katas is credited as one of the first persons to create a hit record entirely on a computer, and produced Stevie B&#x27;s &quot;Party Your Body&quot;, &quot;In My Eyes&quot; and &quot;Dreamin&#x27; of Love&quot;. Katas&#x27; record label Futura Records was an incubator for artists such as Linear, who achieved international success after a move from Futura to Atlantic Records.

===Philadelphia===
The groundbreaking &quot;Nightime&quot; by Pretty Poison featuring red headed diva Jade Starling in 1984 initially put Philadelphia on the freestyle map. Their follow-up &quot;Catch Me I&#x27;m Falling&quot; was a worldwide hit and brought freestyle to American Bandstand, Soul Train, Solid Gold and the Arsenio Hall Show. &quot;Catch Me I&#x27;m Falling&quot; broke on the street during the summer of 1987 and was the #1 single at WCAU (98 Hot Hits) and #2 at WUSL (Power 99) during the first two weeks of July. Virgin Records was quick to sign Pretty Poison helping to usher in the avalanche of other major label signings from the expanding freestyle scene.

Several freestyle acts followed on the heels of Pretty Poison emerging from the metropolitan Philadelphia, PA area in the early 1990s, benefiting from both the clubs and the overnight success of then-Dance friendly Rhythmic Top 40 WIOQ. Artists such as T.P.E. (The Philadelphia Experiment) enjoyed regional success.

===California===
Freestyle had a notable following in California, especially Los Angeles, the Central Valley, San Francisco Bay, and San Diego. California&#x27;s large Latino community enjoyed the sounds of America&#x27;s East Coast club scene, and a number of California artists became popular with East Coast freestyle enthusiasts. In Northern California, primarily San Francisco and San Jose, they leaned toward a similar rhythm dance to hi-NRG, so most of the Californian freestyle emerged from the southern regions of the Bay Area and Los Angeles.

Timmy T, Bernadette, Caleb-B, SF Spanish Fly, Angelina, One Voice, M:G, Stephanie Fastro and The S Factor were from the Bay Area, and from San Diego were Gustavo Campain, Alex Campain, Jose (Jojo) Santos, Robert Romo of the group Internal Affairs, F. Felix, Leticia and Frankie J.

The Filipino American community in California also embraced freestyle music during the late 1980s and early 1990s. Jaya was one of the first Filipino-American freestyle singers, reaching number 44 in 1990 with &quot;If You Leave Me Now&quot;. Later Filipino-American freestyle artists include Jocelyn Enriquez, Buffy, Korell, Damien Bautista, One Voice, Kuya, Sharyn Maceren, and others.

===Canada===
Freestyle&#x27;s popularity spread outward from the Greater Toronto Area&#x27;s Italian, Hispanic/Latino and Greek populations in the late 1980s and early 1990s. It was showcased alongside house music in various Toronto nightclubs, but by the mid-1990s was replaced almost entirely by house music.

Lil&#x27; Suzy released several 12-inch singles and performed live on the Canadian live dance music television program &quot;Electric Circus&quot;. Montreal singer Nancy Martinez&#x27;s 1986 single &quot;For Tonight&quot; would become the first Canadian freestyle single to reach the top 40 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart, while the Montreal girl group 11:30 reached the Canadian chart with &quot;Ole Ole&quot; in 2000.

===Elsewhere in the world===
Performers and producers associated with the style also came from around the world, including Turkish-American Murat Konar (the writer and singer of Information Society&#x27;s &quot;Running&quot;), Paul Lekakis from Greece, Asian artist Leonard (Leon Youngboy) who released the song &quot;Youngboys&quot;, and British musicians including Freeez, Paul Hardcastle, Samantha Fox (whose singles &quot;Naughty Girls (Need Love Too)&quot;, &quot;Love House&quot; and &quot;I Wanna Have Some Fun&quot; were all top 10 chart hits), and even Robin Gibb of the Bee Gees, who also adopted the freestyle sound in his 1984 album &quot;Secret Agent&quot;, having worked with producer Chris Barbosa. Several British new wave and synth-pop bands also teamed up with freestyle producers or were influenced by the genre, and released freestyle songs or remixes. These include Duran Duran whose song &quot;Notorious&quot; was remixed by the Latin Rascals, and whose album &quot;Big Thing&quot; contained several freestyle inspired songs such as &quot;All She Wants Is&quot;; New Order who teamed up with Arthur Baker, producing and co-writing the track &quot;Confusion&quot;; Erasure and the Der Deutsche mixes of their song &quot;Blue Savannah&quot;; and the Pet Shop Boys, whose song &quot;Domino Dancing&quot; was produced by Miami-based freestyle producer Lewis Martineé. Australian act I&#x27;m Talking utilized freestyle elements into their singles &quot;Trust Me&quot; and &quot;Do You Wanna Be?&quot;, both becoming top ten hits in their native Australia.

<text>In psychology, fantasy is a broad range of mental experiences, mediated by the faculty of imagination in the human brain, and marked by an expression of certain desires through vivid mental imagery. Fantasies are generally associated with scenarios that are impossible or unlikely to happen.

== Conscious fantasy ==
In everyday life, individuals often find their thoughts &quot;pursue a series of fantasies concerning things they wish they could do or wish they had done ... fantasies of control or of sovereign choice ... daydreams.&quot;

George Eman Vaillant in his study of defence mechanisms took as a central example of &quot;an immature defence ... &quot;fantasy&quot; — living in a &#x27;Walter Mitty&#x27; dream world where you imagine you are successful and popular, instead of making real efforts to make friends and succeed at a job.&quot;

Other researchers and theorists find that fantasy has beneficial elements — providing &quot;small regressions and compensatory wish fulfilments which are recuperative in effect.&quot; Research by Deirdre Barrett reports that people differ radically in the vividness, as well as frequency of fantasy, and that those who have the most elaborately developed fantasy life are often the people who make productive use of their imaginations in art, literature, or by being especially creative and innovative in more traditional professions.

==Freud and fantasy==

According to Sigmund Freud, a fantasy is constructed around multiple, often repressed wishes, and employs disguise to mask and mark the very defensive processes by which desire is enacted. The subject&#x27;s desire to maintain distance from the repressed wish and simultaneously experience it opens up a type of third person syntax allowing for multiple entry into the fantasy. Therefore, in fantasy, vision is multiplied—it becomes possible to see from more than one position at the same time, to see oneself and to see oneself seeing oneself, to divide vision and dislocate subjectivity. This radical omission of the &quot;I&quot; position creates space for all those processes that depend upon such a center, including not only identification but also the field and organization of vision itself.

For Freud, sexuality is linked from the very beginning to an object of fantasy. However, &quot;the object to be rediscovered is not the lost object, but its substitute by displacement; the lost object is the object of self-preservation, of hunger, and the object one seeks to re-find in sexuality is an object displaced in relation to that first object.&quot; This initial scene of fantasy is created out of the frustrated infants&#x27; deflection away from the instinctual need for milk and nourishment towards a phantasmization of the mothers&#x27; breast, which is in close proximity to the instinctual need. Now bodily pleasure is derived from the sucking of the mother&#x27;s breast itself. The mouth that was the original source of nourishment is now the mouth that takes pleasure in its own sucking. This substitution of the breast for milk and the breast for a phantasmic scene represents a further level of mediation which is increasingly psychic. The child cannot experience the pleasure of milk without the psychic re-inscription of the scene in the mind. &quot;The finding of an object is in fact a re-finding of it.&quot; It is in the movement and constant restaging away from the instinct that desire is constituted and mobilized.

==Freud and daydreams==

A similarly positive view of fantasy was taken by Sigmund Freud who considered fantasy () a defence mechanism. He considered that men and women &quot;cannot subsist on the scanty satisfaction which they can extort from reality. &#x27;We simply cannot do without auxiliary constructions,&#x27; as Theodor Fontane once said ... [without] dwelling on imaginary wish fulfillments.&quot; As childhood adaptation to the reality principle developed, so too &quot;one species of thought activity was split off; it was kept free from reality-testing and remained subordinated to the pleasure principle alone. This activity is &quot;fantasying&quot; ... continued as &quot;day-dreaming&quot;.&quot; He compared such phantasising to the way a &quot;nature reserve preserves its original state where everything ... including what is useless and even what is noxious, can grow and proliferate there as it pleases.&quot;

Daydreams for Freud were thus a valuable resource. &quot;These day-dreams are cathected with a large amount of interest; they are carefully cherished by the subject and usually concealed with a great deal of sensitivity ... such phantasies may be unconscious just as well as conscious.&quot; He considered these fantasies to include a great deal of the true constitutional essence of a personality, and that the energetic man &quot;is one who succeeds by his efforts in turning his wishful phantasies into reality,&quot; whereas the artist &quot;can transform his phantasies into artistic creations instead of into symptoms ... the doom of neurosis.&quot;

== Klein and unconscious fantasy ==

Melanie Klein extended Freud&#x27;s concept of fantasy to cover the developing child&#x27;s relationship to a world of internal objects. In her thought, this kind of &quot;play activity inside the person is known as &#x27;unconscious fantasy&#x27;. And these phantasies are often very violent and aggressive. They are different from ordinary day-dreams or &#x27;fantasies&#x27;.&quot;

The term &quot;fantasy&quot; became a central issue with the development of the Kleinian group as a distinctive strand within the British Psycho-Analytical Society, and was at the heart of the so-called controversial discussions of the wartime years. &quot;A paper by Susan Isaacs (1952) on &#x27;The nature and function of Phantasy&#x27; ... has been generally accepted by the Klein group in London as a fundamental statement of their position.&quot; As a defining feature, &quot;Kleinian psychoanalysts regard the unconscious as made up of phantasies of relations with objects. These are thought of as primary and innate, and as the mental representations of instincts ... the psychological equivalents in the mind of defence mechanisms.&quot;

Isaacs considered that &quot;unconscious phantasies exert a continuous influence throughout life, both in normal and neurotic people, the difference lying in the specific character of the dominant phantasies.&quot; Most schools of psychoanalytic thought would now accept that both in analysis and life, we perceive reality through a veil of unconscious fantasy. Isaacs however claimed that &quot;Freud&#x27;s &#x27;hallucinatory wish-fulfilment&#x27; and his &#x27;introjection&#x27; and &#x27;projection&#x27; are the basis of the fantasy life,&quot; and how far unconscious fantasy was a genuine development of Freud&#x27;s ideas, how far it represented the formation of a new psychoanalytic paradigm, is perhaps the key question of the controversial discussions.

== Lacan, fantasy, and desire ==
Lacan engaged from early on with &quot;the phantasies revealed by Melanie Klein ... the &quot;imago&quot; of the mother ... this shadow of the &quot;bad internal objects&quot;&quot; — with the Imaginary. Increasingly, however, it was Freud&#x27;s idea of fantasy as a kind of &quot;screen-memory, representing something of more importance with which it was in some way connected&quot; that was for him of greater importance. Lacan came to believe that &quot;the phantasy is never anything more than the screen that conceals something quite primary, something determinate in the function of repetition.&quot;

Phantasies thus both link to and block off the individual&#x27;s unconscious, his kernel or real core: &quot;subject and real are to be situated on either side of the split, in the resistance of the phantasy&quot;, which thus comes close to the centre of the individual&#x27;s personality and its splits and conflicts. &quot;The subject situates himself as determined by the phantasy ... whether in the dream or in any of the more or less well-developed forms of day-dreaming;&quot; and as a rule &quot;a subject&#x27;s fantasies are close variations on a single theme ... the &#x27;fundamental fantasy&#x27; ... minimizing the variations in meaning which might otherwise cause a problem for desire.&quot;

The goal of therapy thus became &quot;&quot;la traversée du fantasme&quot;, the crossing over, traversal, or traversing of the fundamental fantasy.&quot; For Lacan, &quot;The traversing of fantasy involves the subject&#x27;s assumption of a new position with respect to the Other as language and the Other as desire ... a utopian moment beyond neurosis.&quot; The question he was left with was &quot;What, then, does he who has passed through the experience ... who has traversed the radical phantasy ... become?.&quot;

== The &quot;fantasy principle&quot; ==
The postmodern intersubjectivity of the 21st century has seen a new interest in fantasy as a form of interpersonal communication. Here, we are told, &quot;We need to go beyond the pleasure principle, the reality principle, and repetition compulsion to ... the &quot;fantasy principle&quot; - not, as Freud did, reduce fantasies to wishes ... [but consider] all other imaginable emotions&quot; and thus envisage emotional fantasies as a possible means of moving beyond stereotypes to more nuanced forms of personal and social relating.

Such a perspective &quot;sees emotions as central to developing fantasies about each other that are not determined by collective &#x27;typifications&#x27;.&quot;

==Narcissistic personality disorder==
Two characteristics of someone with narcissistic personality disorder are:
* A pervasive pattern of grandiosity (in fantasy or behavior)
* A preoccupation with fantasies of unlimited success, power, brilliance, beauty, or ideal love.

==Schizophrenia==
Fantasy is a common symptom in individuals with schizophrenia; they depict specific patterns of high-neurological activities in their brains&#x27; default mode network, which possibly constitute the biomarker of these fantasies.

<text>Surname conventions and laws vary around the world. This article gives an overview of surnames around the world.
==English-speaking countries==

===Gaelic surnames===


==Spanish-speaking countries==

===Argentina===
In Argentina, normally only one family name, the father&#x27;s paternal family name, is used and registered, as in English-speaking countries. However, it is possible to use both the paternal and maternal name. For example, if &quot;Ana Laura Melachenko&quot; and &quot;Emanuel Darío Guerrero&quot; had a daughter named &quot;Adabel Anahí&quot;, her full name could be &quot;Adabel Anahí Guerrero Melachenko&quot;. Women, however, do not change their family names upon marriage and continue to use their birth family names instead of their husband&#x27;s family names. However, women have traditionally, and some still choose to use the old Spanish custom of adjoining &quot;de&quot; and her husband&#x27;s surname to her own name. For example, if Paula Segovia marries Felipe Cossia, she might keep her birth name or become &quot;Paula Segovia de Cossia&quot; or &quot;Paula Cossia&quot;.

There are some province offices where a married woman can use only her birth name, and some others where she has to use the complete name, for legal purposes. The Argentine Civilian Code states both uses are correct, but police offices and passports are issued with the complete name. Today most women prefer to maintain their birth name given that &quot;de&quot; can be interpreted as meaning they belong to their husbands.

When Eva Duarte married Juan Domingo Perón, she could be addressed as Eva Duarte de Perón, but the preferred style was Eva Perón, or the familiar and affectionate &quot;Evita&quot; (little Eva).

Combined names come from old traditional families and are considered one last name, but are rare. Although Argentina is a Spanish-speaking country, it is also composed of other varied European influences, such as Italian, French, Russian, German, etc.

Children typically use their fathers&#x27; last names only. Some state offices have started to use both last names, in the traditional father then mother order, to reduce the risk of a person being mistaken for others using the same name combinations, e.g. if Eva Duarte and Juan Perón had a child named Juan, he might be misidentified if he were called &quot;Juan Perón&quot;, but not if he was known as Juan Perón Duarte.

In early 2008, some new legislation is under consideration that will place the mother&#x27;s last name ahead the father&#x27;s last name, as it is done in Portuguese-speaking countries and only optionally in Spain, despite Argentina being a Spanish-speaking country.

===Chile===
In Chile, marriage has no effect at all on either of the spouses&#x27; names, so people keep their birth names for all their life, no matter how many times marital status, theirs or that of their parents, may change. However, in some upper-class circles or in older couples, even though considered to be old-fashioned, it is still customary for a wife to use her husband&#x27;s name as reference, as in &quot;Doña María Inés de Ramírez&quot; (literally Lady María Inés (wife) of Ramírez).

Children will always bear the surname of the father followed by that of the mother, but if there is no known father and the mother is single, the children can bear either both of her mother&#x27;s surnames or the mother&#x27;s first surname followed by any of the surnames of the mother&#x27;s parents or grandparents, or the child may bear the mother&#x27;s first surname twice in a row.

==French-speaking countries==
France 
Belgium 
Canadian 

==German-speaking countries==
There are about 850,000 different family names in Germany. German family names most often derive from given names, geographical names, occupational designations, bodily attributes or even traits of character. Hyphenations notwithstanding, they mostly consist of a single word; in those rare cases where the family name is linked to the given names by particles such as &quot;von&quot; or &quot;zu&quot;, they usually indicate noble ancestry. Not all noble families used these names (see Riedesel), while some farm families, particularly in Westphalia, used the particle &quot;von&quot; or &quot;zu&quot; followed by their farm or former farm&#x27;s name as a family name (see &quot;Meyer zu Erpen&quot;).

Family names in German-speaking countries are usually positioned last, after all given names. There are exceptions, however: in parts of Austria and Bavaria and the Alemannic-speaking areas, the family name is regularly put in front of the first given name. Also in many – especially rural – parts of Germany, to emphasize family affiliation there is often an inversion in colloquial use, in which the family name becomes a possessive: &quot;Rüters Erich&quot;, for example, would be Erich of the Rüter family.

In Germany today, upon marriage, both partners can choose to keep their birth name or choose either partner&#x27;s name as the common name. In the latter case the partner whose name was not chosen can keep their birth name hyphenated to the new name (e.g. &quot;Schmidt&quot; and &quot;Meyer&quot; choose to marry under the name &quot;Meyer&quot;. The former &quot;Schmidt&quot; can choose to be called &quot;Meyer&quot;, &quot;Schmidt-Meyer&quot; or &quot;Meyer-Schmidt&quot;), but any children will only get the single common name. In the case that both partners keep their birth name they must decide on one of the two family names for all their future children. (German name)

Changing one&#x27;s family name for reasons other than marriage, divorce or adoption is possible only if the application is approved by the responsible government agency. In Germany, permission will usually be granted if:
* the old name is very common and leads to confusion;
* the old name is overly long or very difficult to spell or pronounce (especially with names of former nobility and of citizens with non-German ancestry); or
* the old name has negative connotations or is easily ridiculed.

Otherwise, name changes will normally not be granted.

==Portuguese-speaking countries==

==Dutch-speaking countries==

The Netherlands and Belgium (Flanders)

==Nordic countries==

In the Nordic countries, family names often, but certainly not always, originate from a patronymic. In Denmark and Norway, the corresponding ending is &quot;-sen&quot;, as in &quot;Karlsen&quot;. Names ending with &quot;dotter/datter&quot; (daughter), such as &quot;Olofsdotter&quot;, are rare but occurring, and only apply to women. Today, the patronymic names are passed on similarly to family names in other Western countries, and a person&#x27;s father does not have to be called Karl if he or she has the surname Karlsson. However, in 2006 Denmark reinstated patronymic and matronymic surnames as an option. Thus, parents Karl Larsen and Anna Hansen can name a son Karlsen or Annasen and a daughter Karlsdotter or Annasdotter.

Before the 19th century there was the same system in Scandinavia as in Iceland today. Noble families, however, as a rule adopted a family name, which could refer to a presumed or real forefather or to the family&#x27;s coat of arms. In many surviving family noble names, such as &quot;Silfversparre&quot; (&quot;silver chevron&quot;; in modern spelling, &quot;Silver-&quot;) or &quot;Stiernhielm&quot; (&quot;star-helmet&quot;; in modernized spelling, &quot;stjärnhjälm&quot;), the spelling is obsolete, but since it applies to a name, remains unchanged. (Some names from relatively modern times also use archaic or otherwise aberrant spelling as a stylistic trait; e.g. &quot;-quist&quot; instead of standard &quot;-kvist&quot; &quot;twig&quot; or &quot;-grén&quot; instead of standard &quot;-gren&quot;, &quot;branch&quot;.)

Later on, people from the Scandinavian middle classes, particularly artisans and town dwellers, adopted names in a similar fashion to that of the nobility. Family names joining two elements from nature such as the Swedish &quot;Bergman&quot; (&quot;mountain man&quot;), &quot;Holmberg&quot; (&quot;island mountain&quot;), &quot;Lindgren&quot; (&quot;linden branch&quot;), &quot;Sandström&quot; (&quot;sand stream&quot;) and &quot;Åkerlund&quot; (&quot;field meadow&quot;) were quite frequent and remain common today. The same is true for similar Norwegian and Danish names.
Another common practice was to adopt one&#x27;s place of origin as a middle or surname.

Even more important a driver of change was the need, for administrative purposes, to develop a system under which each individual had a &quot;stable&quot; name from birth to death. In the old days, people would be known by their name, patronymic and the farm they lived at. This last element would change if a person got a new job, bought a new farm, or otherwise came to live somewhere else. (This is part of the origin, in this part of the world, of the custom of women changing their names upon marriage. Originally it indicated, basically, a change of address, and from older times, there are numerous examples of men doing the same thing). The many patronymic names may derive from the fact that people who moved from the country to the cities, also gave up the name of the farm they came from. As a worker, you passed by your father&#x27;s name, and this name passed on to the next generation as a family name. Einar Gerhardsen, the Norwegian prime minister, used a true patronym, as his father was named Gerhard Olsen (Gerhard, the son of Ola). Gerhardsen passed his own patronym on to his children as a family name. This has been common in many working-class families. The tradition of keeping the farm name as a family name got stronger during the first half of the 20th century in Norway.

These names often indicated the place of residence of the family. For this reason, Denmark and Norway have a very high incidence of last names derived from those of farms, many signified by the suffixes like &quot;-bø&quot;, &quot;-rud&quot;, &quot;-heim/-um&quot;, &quot;-land&quot; or &quot;-set&quot; (these being examples from Norway). In Denmark, the most common suffix is &quot;-gaard&quot; — the modern spelling is &quot;gård&quot; in Danish and can be either &quot;gård&quot; or &quot;gard&quot; in Norwegian, but as in Sweden, archaic spelling persists in surnames. The most well-known example of this kind of surname is probably &quot;Kierkegaard&quot; (combined by the words &quot;kirke/kierke&quot; (= church) and &quot;gaard&quot; (= farm) meaning &quot;the farm located by the Church&quot;. It is, however, a common misunderstanding that the name relates to its direct translation: churchyard/cemetery), but many others could be cited. It should also be noted that, since the names in question are derived from the original owners&#x27; domiciles, the possession of this kind of name is no longer an indicator of affinity with others who bear it.

In many cases, names were taken from the nature around them. In Norway, for instance, there is an abundance of surnames based on coastal geography, with suffixes like &quot;-strand&quot;, &quot;-øy&quot;, &quot;-holm&quot;, &quot;-vik&quot;, &quot;-fjord&quot; or &quot;-nes&quot;. Like the names derived from farms, most of these family names reflected the family&#x27;s place of residence at the time the family name was &quot;fixed&quot;, however. A family name such as Swedish &quot;Dahlgren&quot; is derived from &quot;dahl&quot; meaning valley and &quot;gren&quot; meaning branch; or similarly &quot;Upvall&quot; meaning &quot;upper-valley&quot;; It depends on the country, language, and dialect.

===Sweden===
In Scandinavia family names often, but certainly not always, originate from a patronymic. Later on, people from the Scandinavian middle classes, particularly artisans and town dwellers, adopted surnames in a similar fashion to that of the gentry. Family names joining two elements from nature such as the Swedish &quot;Bergman&quot; (&quot;mountain man&quot;), &quot;Holmberg&quot; (&quot;island mountain&quot;), &quot;Lindgren&quot; (&quot;linden branch&quot;), &quot;Sandström&quot; (&quot;sand stream&quot;) and &quot;Åkerlund&quot; (&quot;field grove&quot;) were quite frequent and remain common today.

===Finland===
Finland including Karelia and Estonia was the eastern part of The Kingdom of Sweden from its unification around 1100–1200 AD until the year 1809 when Finland was conquered by Russia. During the Russian revolution 1917, Finland proclaimed the republic Finland and Sweden and many European countries rapidly acknowledged the new nation Finland. Finland has mainly Finnish (increasing) and Swedish (decreasing) surnames and first names. There are two predominant surname traditions among the &quot;Finnish&quot; in Finland: the West Finnish and the East Finnish. The surname traditions of &quot;Swedish-speaking&quot; farmers, fishermen and craftsmen resembles the West Finnish tradition, while smaller populations of &quot;Sami&quot; and &quot;Romani people&quot; have traditions of their own. Finland was exposed to a very small immigration from Russia, so Russian names barely exists.

Until the mid-20th century, Finland was a predominantly agrarian society, and the names of West Finns were based on their association with a particular area, farm, or homestead, e.g. &quot;Jaakko Jussila&quot; (&quot;Jaakko from the farm of Jussi&quot;). On the other hand, the East Finnish surname tradition dates back to at least the 13th century. There, the Savonians pursued slash-and-burn agriculture which necessitated moving several times during a person&#x27;s lifetime. This in turn required the families to have surnames, which were in wide use among the common folk as early as the 13th century. By the mid-16th century, the East Finnish surnames had become hereditary. Typically, the oldest East Finnish surnames were formed from the first names of the patriarchs of the families, e.g. &quot;Ikävalko&quot;, &quot;Termonen&quot;, &quot;Pentikäinen&quot;. In the 16th, 17th, and 18th centuries, new names were most often formed by adding the name of the former or current place of living (e.g. &quot;Puumalainen&quot; &lt; Puumala). In the East Finnish tradition, the women carried the family name of their fathers in female form (e.g. &quot;Puumalatar&quot; &lt; &quot;Puumalainen&quot;). By the 19th century, this practice fell into disuse due to the influence of the West-European surname tradition.

In Western Finland, agrarian names dominated, and the last name of the person was usually given according to the farm or holding they lived on. In 1921, surnames became compulsory for all Finns. At this point, the agrarian names were usually adopted as surnames. A typical feature of such names is the addition of prefixes &quot;Ala-&quot; (Sub-) or &quot;Ylä-&quot; (Up-), giving the location of the holding along a waterway in relation of the main holding. (e.g. &quot;Yli-Ojanperä&quot;, &quot;Ala-Verronen&quot;). The Swedish speaking farmers along the coast of Österbotten usually used two surnames – one which pointed out the father&#x27;s name (e.g. &quot;Eriksson&quot;, &quot;Andersson&quot;, &quot;Johansson&quot;) and one which related to the farm or the land their family or bigger family owned or had some connection to (e.g. &quot;Holm&quot;, &quot;Fant&quot;, &quot;Westergård&quot;, &quot;Kloo&quot;). So a full name could be &quot;Johan Karlsson Kvist&quot;, for his daughter &quot;Elvira Johansdotter Kvist&quot;, and when she married a man with the Ahlskog farm, Elvira kept the first surname Johansdotter but changed the second surname to her husbands (e.g. &quot;Elvira Johansdotter Ahlskog&quot;). During the 20th century they started to drop the -son surname while they kept the second. So in Western Finland the Swedish speaking had names like &quot;Johan Varg&quot;, &quot;Karl Viskas&quot;, &quot;Sebastian Byskata&quot; and &quot;Elin Loo&quot;, while the Swedes in Sweden at the other side of the Baltic Sea kept surnames ending with &quot;-son&quot; (e.g. &quot;Johan Eriksson&quot;, &quot;Thor Andersson&quot;, &quot;Anna-Karin Johansson&quot;).

A third tradition of surnames was introduced in south Finland by the Swedish-speaking upper and middle classes, which used typical German and Swedish surnames. By custom, all Finnish-speaking persons who were able to get a position of some status in urban or learned society, discarded their Finnish name, adopting a Swedish, German or (in the case of clergy) Latin surname. In the case of enlisted soldiers, the new name was given regardless of the wishes of the individual.

In the late 19th and early 20th century, the overall modernization process, and especially the political movement of fennicization, caused a movement for adoption of Finnish surnames. At that time, many persons with a Swedish or otherwise foreign surname changed their family name to a Finnish one. The features of nature with endings &quot;-o/ö&quot;, &quot;-nen&quot; (&quot;Meriö&quot; &lt; &quot;Meri&quot; &quot;sea&quot;, &quot;Nieminen&quot; &lt; &quot;Niemi&quot; &quot;point&quot;) are typical of the names of this era, as well as more or less direct translations of Swedish names (&quot;Paasivirta&quot; &lt; &quot;Hällström&quot;).

In 21st-century Finland, the use of surnames follows the German model. Every person is legally obligated to have a first and last name. At most, three first names are allowed. The Finnish married couple may adopt the name of either spouse, or either spouse (or both spouses) may decide to use a double name. The parents may choose either surname or the double surname for their children, but all siblings must share the same surname. All persons have the right to change their surname once without any specific reason. A surname that is un-Finnish, contrary to the usages of the Swedish or Finnish languages, or is in use by any person residing in Finland cannot be accepted as the new name, unless valid family reasons or religious or national customs give a reason for waiving this requirement. However, persons may change their surname to any surname that has ever been used by their ancestors if they can prove such claim. Some immigrants have had difficulty naming their children, as they must choose from an approved list based on the family&#x27;s household language.

In the Finnish language, both the root of the surname and the first name can be modified by consonant gradation regularly when inflected to a case.

===Iceland===
In Iceland, most people have no family name; a person&#x27;s last name is most commonly a patronymic, i.e. derived from the father&#x27;s first name. For example, when a man called &quot;Karl&quot; has a daughter called &quot;Anna&quot; and a son called &quot;Magnús&quot;, their full names will typically be &quot;Anna Karlsdóttir&quot; (&quot;Karl&#x27;s daughter&quot;) and &quot;Magnús Karlsson&quot; (&quot;Karl&#x27;s son&quot;). The name is not changed upon marriage.

==Slavic world==
Slavic countries are noted for having masculine and feminine versions for many (but not all) of their names. In most countries the use of a feminine form is obligatory in official documents as well as in other communication, except for foreigners. In some countries only the male form figures in official use (Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Montenegro, Serbia, Slovenia), but in communication (speech, print) a feminine form is often used.

In Slovenia the last name of a female is the same as the male form in official use (identification documents, letters). In speech and descriptive writing (literature, newspapers) a female form of the last name is regularly used.

If the name has no suffix, it may or may not have a feminine version. Sometimes it has the ending changed (such as the addition of &quot;-a&quot;). In the Czech Republic and Slovakia, suffixless names, such as those of German origin, are feminized by adding &quot;-ová&quot; (for example, &quot;Schusterová&quot;).

===Bulgaria===

Bulgarian names usually consist of three components – given name, patronymic (based on father&#x27;s name), family name.

Given names have many variations, but the most common names have Christian/Greek (e.g. , , , Peter, ), Slavic (Ognyan, , ) or Protobulgarian (Krum, ) (pre-Christian) origin.
Father&#x27;s names normally consist of the father&#x27;s first name and the &quot;-ov&quot; (male) or &quot;-ova&quot; (female) or &quot;-ovi&quot; (plural) suffix.

Family names usually also end with the &quot;-ov&quot;, &quot;-ev&quot; (male) or &quot;-ova&quot;, &quot;-eva&quot; (female) or &quot;-ovi&quot;, &quot;-evi&quot; (plural) suffix.

In many cases (depending on the name root) the suffixes can be also &quot;-ski&quot; (male and plural) or &quot;-ska&quot; (female); &quot;-ovski&quot;, &quot;-evski&quot; (male and plural) or &quot;-ovska&quot;, &quot;-evska&quot; (female); &quot;-in&quot; (male) or &quot;-ina&quot; (female) or &quot;-ini&quot; (plural); etc.

The meaning of the suffixes is similar to the English word &quot;of&quot;, expressing membership in/belonging to a family.
For example, the family name Ivanova means a person belonging to the Ivanovi family.

A father&#x27;s name Petrov means son of Peter.

Regarding the different meaning of the suffixes, &quot;-ov&quot;, &quot;-ev&quot;/&quot;-ova&quot;, &quot;-eva&quot; are used for expressing relationship to the father and &quot;-in&quot;/&quot;-ina&quot; for relationship to the mother (often for orphans whose father is dead).

===Czech Republic and Slovakia===
Names of Czech people consist of given name (&quot;křestní jméno&quot;) and surname (&quot;příjmení&quot;). Usage of the second or middle name is not common. Feminine names are usually derived from masculine ones by a suffix &quot;-ová&quot; (&quot;Nováková&quot;) or &quot;-á&quot; for names being originally adjectives (&quot;Veselá&quot;), sometimes with a little change of original name&#x27;s ending (&quot;Sedláčková&quot; from &quot;Sedláček&quot; or &quot;Svobodová&quot; from &quot;Svoboda&quot;). Women usually change their family names when they get married. The family names are usually nouns (&quot;Svoboda&quot;, &quot;Král&quot;, &quot;Růžička&quot;, &quot;Dvořák&quot;, &quot;Beneš&quot;), adjectives (&quot;Novotný&quot;, &quot;Černý&quot;, &quot;Veselý&quot;) or past participles of verbs (&quot;Pospíšil&quot;). There are also a couple of names with more complicated origin which are actually complete sentences (&quot;Skočdopole&quot;, &quot;Hrejsemnou&quot; or &quot;Vítámvás&quot;). The most common Czech family name is &quot;Novák&quot; / &quot;Nováková&quot;.

In addition, many Czechs and some Slovaks have German surnames due to mixing between the ethnic groups over the past thousand years. Deriving women&#x27;s names from German and other foreign names is often problematic since foreign names do not suit Czech language rules, although most commonly &quot;-ová&quot; is simply added (&quot;Schmidtová&quot;; umlauts are often, but not always, dropped, e.g. &quot;Müllerová&quot;), or the German name is respelled with Czech spelling (&quot;Šmitová&quot;). Hungarian names, which can be found fairly commonly among Slovaks, can also be either left unchanged (Hungarian &quot;Nagy&quot;, fem. &quot;Nagyová&quot;) or respelled according to Czech/Slovak orthography (masc. &quot;Naď&quot;, fem. &quot;Naďová&quot;).

===Poland===
In Poland and most of the former Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, surnames first appeared during the late Middle Ages. They initially denoted the differences between various people living in the same town or village and bearing the same name. The conventions were similar to those of English surnames, using occupations, patronymic descent, geographic origins, or personal characteristics. Thus, early surnames indicating occupation include &quot;Karczmarz&quot; (&quot;innkeeper&quot;), &quot;Kowal&quot; (&quot;blacksmith&quot;), &quot;Złotnik&quot; (&quot;gold smith&quot;) and &quot;Bednarczyk&quot; (&quot;young cooper&quot;), while those indicating patronymic descent include &quot;Szczepaniak&quot; (&quot;Son of &quot;Szczepan&quot;), &quot;Józefowicz&quot; (&quot;Son of &quot;Józef&quot;), and &quot;Kaźmirkiewicz&quot; (&quot;Son of &quot;Kazimierz&quot;&quot;). Similarly, early surnames like &quot;Mazur&quot; (&quot;the one from Mazury&quot;) indicated geographic origin, while ones like &quot;Nowak&quot; (&quot;the new one&quot;), &quot;Biały&quot; (&quot;the pale one&quot;), and &quot;Wielgus&quot; (&quot;the big one&quot;) indicated personal characteristics.

In the early 16th century, (the Polish Renaissance), toponymic names became common, especially among the nobility. Initially, the surnames were in a form of &quot;[first name] &quot;z&quot; (&quot;de&quot;, &quot;of&quot;) [location]&quot;. Later, most surnames were changed to adjective forms, e.g. &quot;Jakub Wiślicki&quot; (&quot;James of Wiślica&quot;) and &quot;Zbigniew Oleśnicki&quot; (&quot;&quot;Zbigniew&quot; of Oleśnica&quot;), with masculine suffixes &quot;-ski&quot;, &quot;-cki&quot;, &quot;-dzki&quot; and &quot;-icz&quot; or respective feminine suffixes &quot;-ska&quot;, &quot;-cka&quot;, &quot;-dzka&quot; and &quot;-icz&quot; on the east of Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. Names formed this way are adjectives grammatically, and therefore change their form depending on sex; for example, &quot;Jan Kowalski&quot; and &quot;Maria Kowalska&quot; collectively use the plural &quot;Kowalscy&quot;.

Names with masculine suffixes &quot;-ski&quot;, &quot;-cki&quot;, and &quot;-dzki&quot;, and corresponding feminine suffixes &quot;-ska&quot;, &quot;-cka&quot;, and &quot;-dzka&quot; became associated with noble origin. Many people from lower classes successively changed their surnames to fit this pattern. This produced many &quot;Kowalski&quot;s, &quot;Bednarski&quot;s, &quot;Kaczmarski&quot;s and so on.

A separate class of surnames derive from the names of noble clans. These are used either as separate names or the first part of a double-barrelled name. Thus, persons named &quot;Jan Nieczuja&quot; and &quot;Krzysztof Nieczuja-Machocki&quot; might be related. Similarly, after World War I and World War II, many members of Polish underground organizations adopted their war-time pseudonyms as the first part of their surnames. &quot;Edward Rydz&quot; thus became Marshal of Poland &quot;Edward Śmigły-Rydz&quot; and &quot;Zdzisław Jeziorański&quot; became &quot;Jan Nowak-Jeziorański&quot;.

===Russia===
A full Russian name consists of personal (given) name, patronymic, and family name (surname).

Most Russian family names originated from patronymics, that is, father&#x27;s name usually formed by adding the adjective suffix &quot;-ov(a)&quot; or &quot;-ev(a)&quot;. Contemporary patronymics, however, have a substantive suffix &quot;-ich&quot; for masculine and the adjective suffix &quot;-na&quot; for feminine.

For example, the proverbial triad of most common Russian surnames follows:
* &quot;Ivanov&quot; (son of Ivan),
* &quot;Petrov&quot; (son of Peter),
* &quot;Sidorov&quot; (son of Sidor).

Feminine forms of these surnames have the ending &quot;-a&quot;:
* &quot;Ivanova&quot; (daughter of Ivan),
* &quot;Petrova&quot; (daughter of Peter),
* &quot;Sidorova&quot; (daughter of Sidor).

Such a pattern of name formation is not unique to Russia or even to the Eastern and Southern Slavs in general; quite common are also names derived from professions, places of origin, and personal characteristics, with various suffixes (e.g. &quot;-in(a)&quot; and &quot;-sky (-skaya)&quot;).

Professions:
* &quot;kuznets&quot; (smith) → &quot;Kuznetsov&quot;—&quot;Kuznetsova&quot;
* &quot;portnoi&quot; (tailor) → &quot;Portnov&quot;—&quot;Portnova&quot;
* &quot;pastukh&quot; (shepherd) → &quot;Pastukhov&quot;—&quot;Pastukhova&quot;.

Places of origin:
* &quot;Moskva&quot; (Moscow) → &quot;Moskvin&quot;—&quot;Moskvina&quot;, &quot;Moskovsky&quot;—&quot;Moskovskaya&quot;,
* &quot;Smolensk&quot; → &quot;Smolensky&quot;—&quot;Smolenskaya&quot;,
* &quot;Riazan&quot; → &quot;Riazanov&quot;—&quot;Riazanova&quot;, &quot;Riazantsev&quot;—&quot;Riazantseva&quot;.

Personal characteristics:
* &quot;tolsty&quot; (stout, fat) → &quot;Tolstov&quot;—&quot;Tolstova&quot;, &quot;Tolstoy&quot;—&quot;Tolstaya&quot;,
* &quot;nos&quot; (nose) → &quot;Nosov&quot;—&quot;Nosova&quot;,
* &quot;sedoi&quot; (grey-haired or -headed) → &quot;Sedov&quot;—&quot;Sedova&quot;.

A considerable number of &quot;artificial&quot; names exists, for example, those given to seminary graduates; such names were based on Great Feasts of the Orthodox Church or Christian virtues.

Great Orthodox Feasts:
* &quot;rozhdestvo&quot; (Christmas) → &quot;Rozhdestvensky&quot;—&quot;Rozhdestvenskaya&quot;,
* &quot;voskresenie&quot; (Resurrection) → &quot;Voskresensky&quot;—&quot;Voskresenskaya&quot;,
* &quot;uspenie&quot; (Assumption) → &quot;Uspensky&quot;—&quot;Uspenskaya&quot;.

Christian virtues:
* &quot;philagathos&quot; (one who loves goodness) → &quot;Dobrolubov&quot;—&quot;Dobrolubova&quot;, &quot;Dobrolubsky&quot;—&quot;Dobrolubskaya&quot;,
* &quot;philosophos&quot; (one who loves wisdom) → &quot;Lubomudrov&quot;—&quot;Lubomudrova&quot;,
* &quot;theophilos&quot; (one who loves God) → &quot;Bogolubov&quot;—&quot;Bogolubova&quot;.

Many freed serfs were given surnames after those of their former owners. For example, a serf of the Demidov family might be named &quot;Demidovsky&quot;, which translates roughly as &quot;belonging to Demidov&quot; or &quot;one of Demidov&#x27;s bunch&quot;.

Grammatically, Russian family names follow the same rules as other nouns or adjectives (names ending with &quot;-oy&quot;, &quot;-aya&quot; are grammatically adjectives), with exceptions: some names do not change in different cases and have the same form in both genders (for example, &quot;Sedykh&quot;, &quot;Lata&quot;).

=== Ukraine and Belarus ===
Ukrainian and Belarusian names evolved from the same Old East Slavic and Ruthenian language (western Rus&#x27;) origins. Ukrainian and Belarusian names share many characteristics with family names from other Slavic cultures. Most prominent are the shared root words and suffixes. For example, the root &quot;koval&quot; (blacksmith) compares to the Polish &quot;kowal&quot;, and the root &quot;bab&quot; (woman) is shared with Polish, Slovakian, and Czech. The suffix &quot;-vych&quot; (son of) corresponds to the South Slavic &quot;-vic&quot;, the Russian &quot;-vich&quot;, and the Polish &quot;-wicz&quot;, while &quot;-sky&quot;, &quot;-ski&quot;, and &quot;-ska&quot; are shared with both Polish and Russian, and &quot;-ak&quot; with Polish.

However some suffixes are more uniquely characteristic to Ukrainian and Belarusian names, especially: &quot;-chuk&quot; (Western Ukraine), &quot;-enko&quot; (all other Ukraine) (both son of), &quot;-ko&quot; (little [masculine]), &quot;-ka&quot; (little [feminine]), &quot;-shyn&quot;, and &quot;-uk&quot;. See, for example, Mihalko, Ukrainian Presidents Leonid Kravchuk, and Viktor Yushchenko, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko, or former Soviet diplomat Andrei Gromyko. Such Ukrainian and Belarusian names can also be found in Russia, Poland, or even other Slavic countries (e.g. Croatian general Zvonimir Červenko), but are due to importation by Ukrainian, Belarusian, or Rusyn ancestors.

===South Slavs===
====Endings in -ić and -ič====
Surnames of some South Slavic groups such as Serbs, Croats, Montenegrins, and Bosniaks traditionally end with the suffixes &quot;-ić&quot; and &quot;-vić&quot; (often transliterated to English and other western languages as &quot;ic&quot;, &quot;ich&quot;, &quot;vic&quot; or &quot;vich&quot;. The v is added in the case of a name to which &quot;-ić&quot; is appended would otherwise end with a vowel, to avoid double vowels with the &quot;i&quot; in &quot;-ić&quot;.) These are a diminutive indicating descent i.e. &quot;son of&quot;. In some cases the family name was derived from a profession (e.g. blacksmith – &quot;Kovač&quot; → &quot;Kovačević&quot;).

An analogous ending is also common in Slovenia. As the Slovenian language does not have the softer consonant &quot;ć&quot;, in Slovene words and names only &quot;č&quot; is used. So that people from the former Yugoslavia need not change their names, in official documents &quot;ć&quot; is also allowed (as well as &quot;Đ / đ&quot;). Thus, one may have two surname variants, e.g.: Božič, Tomšič (Slovenian origin or assimilated) and Božić, Tomšić (roots from the Serbo-Croat language continuum area). Slovene names ending in -ič do not necessarily have a patrimonial origin.

In general family names in all of these countries follow this pattern with some family names being typically Serbian, some typically Croat and yet others being common throughout the whole linguistic region.

Children usually inherit their fathers&#x27; family name. In an older naming convention which was common in Serbia up until the mid-19th century, a person&#x27;s name would consist of three distinct parts: the person&#x27;s given name, the patronymic derived from the father&#x27;s personal name, and the family name, as seen, for example, in the name of the language reformer Vuk Stefanović Karadžić.

Official family names do not have distinct male or female forms, except in North Macedonia, though a somewhat archaic unofficial form of adding suffixes to family names to form female form persists, with &quot;-eva&quot;, implying &quot;daughter of&quot; or &quot;female descendant of&quot; or &quot;-ka&quot;, implying &quot;wife of&quot; or &quot;married to&quot;. In Slovenia the feminine form of a surname (&quot;-eva&quot; or &quot;-ova&quot;) is regularly used in non-official communication (speech, print), but not for official IDs or other legal documents.

Bosniak Muslim names follow the same formation pattern but are usually derived from proper names of Islamic origin, often combining archaic Islamic or feudal Turkish titles i.e. Mulaomerović, Šabanović, Hadžihafizbegović, etc. Also related to Islamic influence is the prefix &quot;Hadži-&quot; found in some family names. Regardless of religion, this prefix was derived from the honorary title which a distinguished ancestor earned by making a pilgrimage to either Christian or Islamic holy places; Hadžibegić, being a Bosniak Muslim example, and Hadžiantić an Orthodox Christian one.

In Croatia where tribal affiliations persisted longer, Lika, Herzegovina etc., originally a family name, came to signify practically all people living in one area, clan land or holding of the nobles. The Šubić family owned land around the Zrin River in the Central Croatian region of Banovina. The surname became Šubić Zrinski, the most famous being Nikola Šubić Zrinski.

In Montenegro and Herzegovina, family names came to signify all people living within one clan or bratstvo. As there exists a strong tradition of inheriting personal names from grandparents to grandchildren, an additional patronymic usually using suffix &quot;-ov&quot; had to be introduced to make distinctions between two persons bearing the same personal name and the same family name and living within same area. A noted example is Marko Miljanov Popović, i.e. Marko, son of Miljan, from Popović family.

Due to discriminatory laws in the Austro-Hungarian Empire, some Serb families of Vojvodina discarded the suffix &quot;-ić&quot; in an attempt to mask their ethnicity and avoid heavy taxation.

The prefix &quot;Pop-&quot; in Serbian names indicates descent from a priest, for example Gordana Pop Lazić, i.e. descendant of Pop Laza.

Some Serbian family names include prefixes of Turkish origin, such as &quot;Uzun-&quot; meaning tall, or &quot;Kara-&quot;, black. Such names were derived from nicknames of family ancestors. A famous example is Karađorđević, descendants of Đorđe Petrović, known as Karađorđe or Black Đorđe.

====Endings -ov and -ski====
Among the Bulgarians, another South Slavic people, the typical surname suffix is &quot;-ov&quot; (Ivanov, Kovachev), although other popular suffixes also exist.

In North Macedonia, the most popular suffix today is &quot;-ski&quot;.

===Slovenia===
Slovenes have a great variety of surnames, most of them differentiated according to region. Surnames ending in -ič are by far less frequent than among Croats and Serbs. There are typically Slovenian surnames ending in -ič, such as Blažič, Stanič, Marušič. Many Slovenian surnames, especially in the Slovenian Littoral, end in -čič (Gregorčič, Kocijančič, Miklavčič, etc.), which is uncommon for other South Slavic peoples (except the neighboring Croats, e.g. Kovačić, Jelačić, Kranjčić, etc.). On the other hand, surname endings in -ski and -ov are rare, they can denote a noble origin (especially for the -ski, if it completes a toponym) or a foreign (mostly Czech) origin. One of the most typical Slovene surname endings is -nik (Rupnik, Pučnik, Plečnik, Pogačnik, Podobnik) and other used surname endings are -lin (Pavlin, Mehlin, Ahlin, Ferlin), -ar (Mlakar, Ravnikar, Smrekar Tisnikar) and -lj (Rugelj, Pucelj, Bagatelj, Bricelj). Many Slovenian surnames are linked to Medieval rural settlement patterns. Surnames like Novak (literally, &quot;the new one&quot;) or Hribar (from &quot;hrib&quot;, hill) were given to the peasants settled in newly established farms, usually in high mountains. Peasant families were also named according to the owner of the land which they cultivated: thus, the surname Kralj (King) or Cesar (Emperor) was given to those working on royal estates, Škof (Bishop) or Vidmar to those working on ecclesiastical lands, etc. Many Slovenian surnames are named after animals (Medved – bear, Volk, Vovk or Vouk – wolf, Golob – pigeon, Strnad – yellowhammer, Orel – eagle, Lisjak – fox, or Zajec – rabbit, etc.) or plants Pšenica – wheat, Slak – bindweed, Hrast – oak, etc. Many are named after neighbouring peoples: Horvat, Hrovat, or Hrovatin (Croat), Furlan (Friulian), Nemec (German), Lah (Italian), Vogrin, Vogrič or Vogrinčič (Hungarian), Vošnjak (Bosnian), Čeh (Czech), Turk (Turk), or different Slovene regions: Kranjc, Kranjec or Krajnc (from Carniola), Kraševec (from the Karst Plateau), Korošec (from Carinthia), Kočevar or Hočevar (from the Gottschee county).

==== Use of feminine surnames in Slovenia ====
In Slovenia last name of a female is the same as the male form in official use (identification documents, letters). In speech and descriptive writing (literature, newspapers) a female form of the last name is regularly used. Examples: Novak (m.) &amp; Novakova (f.), Kralj (m.) &amp; Kraljeva (f.), Mali (m.) &amp; Malijeva (f.). Usually surenames on -ova are used together with the title/gender: gospa Novakova (Mrs. Novakova), gospa Kraljeva (Mrs. Kraljeva), gospodična Malijeva (Miss Malijeva, if unmarried), etc. or with the name. So we have Maja Novak on the ID card and Novakova Maja (extremely rarely Maja Novakova) in communication; Tjaša Mali and Malijeva Tjaša (rarely Tjaša Malijeva); respectively. Diminutive forms of last names for females are also available: Novakovka, Kraljevka. As for pronunciation, in Slovenian there is some leeway regarding accentuation. Depending on the region or local usage, you may have either Nóvak &amp; Nóvakova or, more frequently, Novák &amp; Novákova. Accent marks are normally not used.

==Arabic-speaking countries==
The given name is always followed by the father&#x27;s first name, then the father&#x27;s family surname.
Some surnames have a prefix of &quot;ibn&quot;- (&quot;ould&quot;- in Mauritania) meaning &quot;son of&quot;.
The surnames follow similar rules defining a relation to a clan, family, place etc.
Some Arab countries have differences due to historic rule by the Ottoman Empire or due to being a different minority.

A large number of Arabic last names start with &quot;Al-&quot; which means &quot;The&quot;

Arab States of the Persian Gulf:
Names mainly consist of the person&#x27;s name followed by the father&#x27;s first name connected by the word &quot;ibn&quot; or &quot;bin&quot; (meaning &quot;son of&quot;). The last name either refers to the name of the tribe the person belongs to, or to the region, city, or town he/she originates from. In exceptional cases, members of the royal families or ancient tribes mainly, the title (usually H.M./H.E., Prince, or Sheikh) is included in the beginning as a prefix, and the first name can be followed by four names, his father, his grandfather, and great – grandfather, as a representation of the purity of blood and to show the pride one has for his ancestry.

In Arabic-speaking Levantine countries (Jordan, Lebanon, Palestine, Syria) it&#x27;s common to have family names associated with a certain profession or craft, such as &quot;Al-Haddad&quot;/&quot;Haddad&quot; which means &quot;Blacksmith&quot; or &quot;Al-Najjar&quot;/&quot;Najjar&quot; which means &quot;Carpenter&quot;.

==Indian Subcontinent==
===India===

In India, surnames are placed as last names or before first names, which often denote: village of origin, caste, clan, office of authority their ancestors held, or trades of their ancestors. The use of surnames is a relatively new convention, introduced during British colonisation. Typically, parts of northern India follow English-speaking Western naming conventions by having a given name followed by a surname. This is not necessarily the case in southern India, where people may adopt a surname out of necessity when migrating or travelling abroad.

The largest variety of surnames is found in the states of Maharashtra and Goa, which numbers more than the rest of India together. Here surnames are placed last, the order being: the given name, followed by the father&#x27;s name, followed by the family name. The majority of surnames are derived from the place where the family lived, with the &#x27;kar&#x27; (Marathi and Konkani) suffix, for example, Mumbaikar, Punekar, Aurangabadkar, Tendulkar, Parrikar, Mangeshkar, Mahendrakar. Another common variety found in Maharashtra and Goa are the ones ending in &#x27;e&#x27;. These are usually more archaic than the &#x27;Kar&#x27;s and usually denote medieval clans or professions like Rane, Salunkhe, Gupte, Bhonsle, Ranadive, Rahane, Hazare, Apte, Satpute, Shinde, Sathe, Londhe, Salve, Kale, Gore, Godbole, etc.

In Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, surnames usually denote family names. It is easy to track family history and the caste they belonged to using a surname.

In Odisha and West Bengal, surnames denote the caste they belong. There are also several local surnames like Das, Patnaik, Mohanty, Jena etc.

In Kerala, surnames denote the caste they belong. There are also several local surnames like Nair, Menon, Panikkar etc.

It is a common in Kerala, Tamil Nadu, and some other parts of South India that the spouse adopts her husband&#x27;s first name instead of his family or surname name after marriage.

In Rajasthan, the community name and sometimes the gotra or clan name are used as surnames. Usage of community name as surname include: Charan, Jat, Meena, Rajput, etc. Sometimes, the faith name (for example: Jain) can also be used as a surname.

India is a country with numerous distinct cultural and linguistic groups. Thus, Indian surnames, where formalized, fall into seven general types.

Surnames are based on:
* Patronymics and ancestry, whereby the father&#x27;s name or an ancestor&#x27;s given name is used in its original form or in a derived form (e.g. Baranwal or Barnwal or Burnwal derived from the ancestor Ahibaran).
* Occupations (Chamar, Patel or Patil, meaning Village Headman, Gandhi, Kamath, Kulkarni, who used to maintain the accounts and records and collect taxes, Kapadia, Nadkarni, Patwardhan, Patwari, Shenoy, etc.) and priestly distinctions (Bhat, Bhattar, Sastry, Trivedi, Shukla, Chaturvedi, Twivedi, Purohit, Mukhopadhyay); Business people: Shetty, Rai, Hegde is commonly used in ruling castes of the Karnataka coastal belt. In addition, many Parsi, Bohra and Gujarati families have used English trade names as last names since the 18th and 19th centuries (Contractor, Engineer, Builder).
* Clan names (Pillai, Gounder, Goud, Gowda, Boyar, Parmar, Sindhi, Vaish, Reddy, Meena, Nair, Nadar and Naidu) are not surnames but suffixes to first names to indicate their clan or caste.
* Place names or names derived from places of ancestral origin (Aluru, Marwari, Gavaskar, Gaonkar, Mangeshkar, Kapoor, Wamankar, Kokradi, Karnad, Sandhu, Medukonduru, Rachapalli).
* The father&#x27;s first name is used as a surname in certain Southern states, such as Kerala, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu. Spouses and children take on the first name of the father as their last name or &#x27;surname&#x27;.
* Muslim surnames generally follow the same rules used in Pakistan. Khan is among the most popular surnames, often signifying Afghan/Central Asian descent.
* Bestowed titles or other honorifics: titles bestowed by kings, rajas, nawabs and other nobles before the British Raj (Wali, Rai, Rao, Babu, Thakur, Gain/Gayen, Panicker, Vallikappen, Moocken, etc.) and those bestowed by the British (Rai, Bahadur).

The convention is to write the first name followed by middle names and surname. It is common to use the father&#x27;s first name as the middle name or last name even though it is not universal. In some Indian states like Maharashtra, official documents list the family name first, followed by a comma and the given names.

In modern times, in urban areas at least, this practice is not universal and some wives either suffix their husband&#x27;s surname or do not alter their surnames at all. In some rural areas, particularly in North India, wives may also take a new first name after their nuptials. Children inherit their surnames from their father.

Jains generally use Jain, Shah, Firodia, Singhal or Gupta as their last names. Sikhs generally use the words &quot;Singh&quot; (&quot;lion&quot;) and &quot;Kaur&quot; (&quot;princess&quot;) as surnames added to the otherwise unisex first names of men and women, respectively. It is also common to use a different surname after Singh in which case Singh or Kaur are used as middle names (Montek Singh Ahluwalia, Surinder Kaur Badal). The tenth Guru of Sikhism ordered (Hukamnama) that any man who considered himself a Sikh must use &quot;Singh&quot; in his name and any woman who considered herself a Sikh must use &quot;Kaur&quot; in her name. Other middle names or honorifics that are sometimes used as surnames include Kumar, Dev, Lal, and Chand.

The modern-day spellings of names originated when families translated their surnames to English, with no standardization across the country. Variations are regional, based on how the name was translated from the local language to English in the 18th, 19th and 20th centuries during British rule. Therefore, it is understood in the local traditions that Baranwal and Barnwal represent the same name derived from Uttar Pradesh and Punjab respectively. Similarly, Tagore derives from Bengal while Thakur is from Hindi-speaking areas. The officially recorded spellings tended to become the standard for that family. In the modern times, some states have attempted standardization, particularly where the surnames were corrupted because of the early British insistence of shortening them for convenience. Thus Bandopadhyay became Banerji, Mukhopadhay became Mukherji, Chattopadhyay became Chatterji, etc. This coupled with various other spelling variations created several surnames based on the original surnames. The West Bengal Government now insists on re-converting all the variations to their original form when the child is enrolled in school.

Some parts of Sri Lanka, Thailand, Nepal, Myanmar, and Indonesia have similar patronymic customs to those of India.

===Nepal===

Nepali surnames are divided into three origins; Indo-Aryan languages, Tibeto-Burman languages and indigenous origins. Surnames of Khas community contains toponyms as Ghimire, Dahal, Pokharel, Sapkota from respective villages, occupational names as (Adhikari, Bhandari, Karki, Thapa). Many Khas surnames includes suffix as -wal, -al as in Katwal, Silwal, Khanal, Khulal, Rijal. Kshatriya titles such as Bista, Kunwar, Rana, Rawal, Shah, Thakuri, Chand, were taken as surnames by various Kshetri and Thakuris. Khatri Kshetris share surnames with mainstream Pahari Bahuns. Other popular Chhetri surnames include Basnyat, Bogati, Budhathoki, Khadka, Mahat, Raut. Similarly, Brahmin surnames such as Acharya, Joshi, Pandit, Sharma, Upadhyay were taken by Pahari Bahuns. Bahuns bear distinct surnames as Kattel, and share surnames with mainstream Bahuns. Other Bahun surnames include Aryal, Bhattarai, Banskota, Chaulagain, Devkota, Dhakal, Gyawali, Koirala, Mainali, Pandey, Panta, Paudel, Regmi, Subedi, Lamsal, and Dhungel. Khas-Dalits surnames include Kami, Bishwakarma or B.K., Damai, Mijar, Pariyar, Sarki. Newar groups of multiethnic background bears both Indo-Aryan surnames (like Shrestha, Pradhan) and indigenous surnames like Maharjan, Dangol. Magars bear surnames derived from Khas peoples such as Baral, Budhathoki, Lamichhane, Thapa and indigenous origins as Gharti, Pun, Pulami. Other Himalayan Mongoloid castes bears Tibeto-Burmese surnames like Gurung, Tamang, Thakali, Sherpa. Various Kiranti ethnic group contains many Indo-Aryan surnames of Khas origin which were awarded by the government of Khas peoples. These surnames are Rai, Subba depending upon job and position hold by them. Terai community consists both Indo-Aryan and Indigenous origin surnames. Terai Brahmins bears surnames as Jha. Nepalese Muslims bears Islamic surnames such as Ali, Ansari, Begum, Khan, Mohammad, Pathan. Other common Terai surnames are Kayastha.

===Pakistan===

Pakistani surnames are basically divided in three categories: Arab naming convention, tribal or caste names and ancestral names.

Family names indicating Arab ancestry, e.g. Shaikh, Siddiqui, Abbasi, Syed, Zaidi, Khawaja, Naqvi, Farooqi, Osmani, Alavi, Hassani, and Husseini.

People claiming Afghan ancestry include those with family names like Durrani, Gardezi, Suri, Yousafzai, Afridi, Mullagori, Mohmand, Khattak, Wazir, Mehsud, Niazi.

Family names indicating Turkic heritage include Mughal, Baig or Beg, Pasha, Barlas, and Seljuki. Family names indicating Turkish/Kurd ancestry, Dogar.

People claiming Indic ancestry include those with family names Barelwi, Lakhnavi, Delhvi, Godharvi, Bilgrami, and Rajput. A large number of Muslim Rajputs have retained their surnames such as Chauhan, Rathore, Parmar, and Janjua.

People claiming Iranian ancestry include those with family names Agha, Bukhari, Firdausi, Ghazali, Gilani, Hamadani, Isfahani, Kashani, Kermani, Khorasani, Farooqui, Mir, Mirza, Montazeri, Nishapuri, Noorani, Kayani, Qizilbash, Saadi, Sabzvari, Shirazi, Sistani, Suhrawardi, Yazdani, Zahedi, and Zand.

In Pakistan, the official paperwork format regarding personal identity is as follows:

So and so, son of so and so, of such and such tribe or clan and religion and resident of such and such place. For example, Amir Khan s/o Fakeer Khan, tribe Mughal Kayani or Chauhan Rajput, Follower of religion Islam, resident of Village Anywhere, Tehsil Anywhere, District.

==Sinosphere==
In modern Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Taiwanese, and Vietnamese, the family name is placed before the given names, although this order may not be observed in translation. Generally speaking, Chinese, Korean, and Vietnamese names do not alter their order in English (Mao Zedong, Kim Jong-il, Ho Chi Minh) and Japanese names do (Kenzaburō Ōe). However, numerous exceptions exist, particularly for people born in English-speaking countries such as Yo-Yo Ma. This is sometimes systematized: in all Olympic events, the athletes of the People&#x27;s Republic of China list their names in the Chinese ordering, while Chinese athletes representing other countries, such as the United States, use the Western ordering. (In Vietnam, the system is further complicated by the cultural tradition of addressing people by their given name, usually with an honorific. For example, Phan Văn Khải is &quot;properly&quot; addressed as Mr. Khải, even though Phan is his family name.)

Chinese family names have many types of origins, some claiming dates as early as the legendary Yellow Emperor (2nd millennium BC):
* from the land or state that one lived in or awarded: Chen 陳 after the state of Chen, Cai 蔡 after the state of Cai;
* from the given name or posthumous name of one&#x27;s ancestor: Zhuang 莊 after King Zhuang of Chu;
* from the nobility status or officer status of one&#x27;s ancestor: Wang 王 (a king) or Shi 史 (a history-recording officer);
* and some other origins.

In history, some changed their surnames due to a naming taboo (from Zhuang 莊 to Yan 嚴 during the era of Liu Zhuang 劉莊) or when the imperial surname was awarded by the Emperor (the imperial surname Li was often bestowed on senior officers during the Tang dynasty).

In modern times, some Chinese adopt an English name in addition to their native given names: e.g., adopted the English name Martin Lee. Particularly in Hong Kong and Singapore, the convention is to write both names together: Martin Lee Chu-ming. Owing to the confusion this can cause, a further convention is sometimes observed of capitalizing the surname: Martin L Chu-ming. Sometimes, however, the Chinese given name is forced into the Western system as a middle name (&quot;Martin Chu-ming Lee&quot;); less often, the English given name is forced into the Chinese system (&quot;Lee Chu-ming Martin&quot;).

In Japan, the civil law forces a common surname for every married couple, unless in a case of international marriage. In most cases, women surrender their surnames upon marriage, and use the surnames of their husbands. However, a convention that a man uses his wife&#x27;s family name if the wife is an only child is sometimes observed. A similar tradition called &quot;ru zhui&quot; (入贅) is common among Chinese when the bride&#x27;s family is wealthy and has no son but wants the heir to pass on their assets under the same family name. The Chinese character &quot;zhui&quot; (贅) carries a money radical (貝), which implies that this tradition was originally based on financial reasons. All their offspring carry the mother&#x27;s family name. If the groom is the first born with an obligation to carry his own ancestor&#x27;s name, a compromise may be reached in that the first male child carries the mother&#x27;s family name while subsequent offspring carry the father&#x27;s family name. The tradition is still in use in many Chinese communities outside mainland China, but largely disused in China because of social changes from communism. Due to the economic reform in the past decade, accumulation and inheritance of personal wealth made a comeback to the Chinese society. It is unknown if this financially motivated tradition would also come back to mainland China.

In Chinese, Korean, Vietnamese and Singaporean cultures, women keep their own surnames, while the family as a whole is referred to by the surnames of the husbands.

In Hong Kong, some women would be known to the public with the surnames of their husbands preceding their own surnames, such as Anson Chan Fang On Sang. Anson is an English given name, On Sang is the given name in Chinese, Chan is the surname of Anson&#x27;s husband, and Fang is her own surname. A name change on legal documents is not necessary. In Hong Kong&#x27;s English publications, her family names would have been presented in small cap letters to resolve ambiguity, e.g. Anson C F On Sang in full or simply Anson Chan in short form.

In Macau, some people have their names in Portuguese spelt with some Portuguese style, such as &quot;Carlos do Rosario Tchiang&quot;.

Chinese women in Canada, especially Hongkongers in Toronto, would preserve their maiden names before the surnames of their husbands when written in English, for instance, Rosa Chan Leung, where Chan is the maiden name, and Leung is the surname of the husband.

In Chinese, Korean, and Vietnamese, surnames are predominantly monosyllabic (written with one character), though a small number of common disyllabic (or written with two characters) surnames exists (e.g. the Chinese name &quot;Ouyang&quot;, the Korean name &quot;Jegal&quot; and the Vietnamese name &quot;Phan-Tran&quot;).

Many Chinese, Korean, and Vietnamese surnames are of the same origin, but simply pronounced differently and even transliterated differently overseas in Western nations. For example, the common Chinese surnames Chen, Chan, Chin, Cheng and Tan, the Korean surname Jin, as well as the Vietnamese surname Trần are often all the same exact character 陳. The common Korean surname Kim is also the common Chinese surname Jin, and written 金. The common Mandarin surnames Lin or Lim (林) is also one and the same as the common Cantonese or Vietnamese surname &quot;Lam&quot; and Korean family name Lim (written/pronounced as Im in South Korea). There are people with the surname of Hayashi (林) in Japan too. The common Chinese surname 李, translated to English as Lee, is, in Chinese, the same character but transliterated as Li according to pinyin convention. Lee is also a common surname of Koreans, and the character is identical.

===Vietnam===

40% of all Vietnamese have the surname Nguyen. This may be because when a new dynasty took power in Vietnam it was custom to adopt that dynasty&#x27;s surname. The last dynasty in Vietnam was the Nguyen dynasty, so as a result, many people have this surname.

==Africa==

===Burundi and Rwanda===
In Burundi and Rwanda, most, if not all surnames have God in it, for example, Hakizimana (meaning God cures), Nshimirimana (I thank God) or Havyarimana/Habyarimana (God gives birth). But not all surnames end with the suffix -imana. Irakoze is one of these (technically meaning Thank God, though it is hard to translate it correctly in English or probably any other language). Surnames are often different among immediate family members, as parents frequently choose unique surnames for each child, and women keep their maiden names when married. Surnames are placed before given names and frequently written in capital letters, e.g. HAKIZIMANA Jacques.

===East Africa===
In several Northeast Bantu languages such as Kamba, Taita and Kikuyu in Kenya the word &quot;wa&quot; (meaning &quot;of&quot;) is inserted before the surname, for instance, Mugo wa Kibiru (Kikuyu) and Mekatilili wa Menza (Mijikenda).

===Ethiopia and Eritrea===
The patronymic custom in most of the Horn of Africa gives children the father&#x27;s first name as their surname. The family then gives the child its first name. Middle names are unknown. So, for example, a person&#x27;s name might be &quot;Bereket Mekonen &quot;. In this case, &quot;Bereket &quot; is the first name and &quot;Mekonen&quot; is the surname, and also the first name of the father.

The paternal grandfather&#x27;s name is often used if there is a requirement to identify a person further, for example, in school registration. Also, different cultures and tribes use the father&#x27;s or grandfather&#x27;s given name as the family&#x27;s name. For example, some Oromos use Warra Ali to mean families of Ali, where Ali, is either the householder, a father or grandfather.

In Ethiopia, the customs surrounding the bestowal and use of family names is as varied and complex as the cultures to be found there. There are so many cultures, nations or tribes, that currently there can be no one formula whereby to demonstrate a clear pattern of Ethiopian family names. In general, however, Ethiopians use their father&#x27;s name as a surname in most instances where identification is necessary, sometimes employing both father&#x27;s and grandfather&#x27;s names together where exigency dictates.

Many people in Eritrea have Italian surnames, but all of these are owned by Eritreans of Italian descent.

===Libya===
Libya&#x27;s names and surnames have a strong Islamic/Arab nature, with some Turkish influence from Ottoman Empire rule of nearly 400 years.
Amazigh, Touareg and other minorities also have their own name/surname traditions.
Due to its location as a trade route and the different cultures that had their impact on Libya throughout history, one can find names that could have originated in neighboring countries, including clan names from the Arabian Peninsula, and Turkish names derived from military rank or status (&quot;Basha&quot;, &quot;Agha&quot;).

==Other countries==

===Albania===
A full Albanian name consists of a given name (), patronymic () and family name (), for example &quot;Agron Mark Gjoni&quot;. The patronymic is simply the given name of the individual&#x27;s father, with no suffix added. The family name is typically a noun in the definite form or at the very least ends with a vowel or -j (an approximant close to -i). Many traditional last names end with -aj (previously -anj), which is more prevalent in certain regions of Albania and Kosovo. Family names are usually patrilineal, however, the mother&#x27;s surname can be legally added if so wished by the parents.

Proper names in Albanian are fully declinable like any noun (e.g. &quot;Marinelda&quot;, genitive case &quot;i/e Marineldës&quot; &quot;of Marinelda&quot;).

===Armenia===
Armenian surnames almost always have the ending () transliterated into English as -yan or -ian (spelled -ean (եան) in Western Armenian and pre-Soviet Eastern Armenian, of Ancient Armenian or Iranian origin, presumably meaning &quot;son of&quot;), though names with that ending can also be found among Persians and a few other nationalities. Armenian surnames can derive from a geographic location, profession, noble rank, personal characteristic or personal name of an ancestor. Armenians in the diaspora sometimes adapt their surnames to help assimilation. In Russia, many have changed -yan to -ov (or -ova for women). In Turkey, many have changed the ending to -oğlu (also meaning &quot;son of&quot;). In English and French-speaking countries, many have shortened their name by removing the ending (for example Charles Aznavour). In ancient Armenia, many noble names ended with the locative -t&#x27;si (example, Khorenatsi) or -uni (Bagratuni). Several modern Armenian names also have a Turkish suffix which appears before -ian/-yan: -lian denotes a placename; -djian denotes a profession. Some Western Armenian names have a particle Der, while their Eastern counterparts have Ter. This particle indicates an ancestor who was a priest (Armenian priests can choose to marry or remain celibate, but married priests cannot become a bishop). Thus someone named Der Bedrosian (Western) or Ter Petrosian (Eastern) is a descendant of an Armenian priest. The convention is still in use today: the children of a priest named Hagop Sarkisian would be called Der Sarkisian. Other examples of Armenian surnames: Adonts, Sakunts, Vardanyants, Rshtuni.

===Azerbaijan===
It was common for Azerbaijani names to have 3 components: given name, father&#x27;s name and family name. However, in recent years it is becoming increasingly popular to only have 2 components: first name and surname.

While under Soviet rule, it was mandatory for Azerbaijanis to register their names, but most people did not have surnames. This was normally circumvented by taking the individual&#x27;s father&#x27;s name and adding a Russian suffixes such as &quot;-yev&quot;/&quot;-ov&quot; for men and &quot;-yeva/-ova&quot; for women (meaning &quot;born of&quot;). For example, from &quot;Ali&quot; we get &quot;Aliyev&quot; and &quot;Aliyeva&quot; and from &quot;Husein&quot; we get &quot;Huseinov&quot; and &quot;Huseinova&quot;. However, as the Soviet era came to an end, many Azerbaijanis dropped these endings in an attempt to derussify. Some chose to replace these with traditional suffixes like &quot;-zade&quot; (Persian for &quot;born of&quot;) and &quot;-li/-lu&quot; (Turkish for &quot;with&quot; or &quot;belonging to&quot;), &quot;-oglu/-oghlu&quot; (Turkish for &quot;son of&quot;). Some chose to drop the suffixes entirely.

===Georgia===
Most eastern Georgian surnames end with the suffix of &quot;-shvili&quot;, (e.g. Kartveli&#x27;shvili) Georgian for &quot;child&quot; or &quot;offspring&quot;. Western Georgian surnames most commonly have the suffix &quot;-dze&quot;, (e.g. ) Georgian for &quot;son&quot;. Megrelian surnames usually end in &quot;-ia&quot;, &quot;-ua&quot; or &quot;-ava&quot;. Other location-specific endings exist: In Svaneti &quot;-iani&quot;, meaning &quot;belonging to&quot;, or &quot;hailing from&quot;, is common. In the eastern Georgian highlands common endings are &quot;uri&quot; and &quot;uli&quot;. Some noble family names end in &quot;eli&quot;, meaning &quot;of (someplace)&quot;.
In Georgian, the surname is not normally used as the polite form of address; instead, the given name is used together with a title. For instance, Nikoloz Kartvelishvili is politely addressed as &quot;bat&#x27;ono Nikoloz&quot; &quot;My Lord. Nikoloz&quot;.

===Greece and Cyprus===
Greek surnames are most commonly patronymics. Occupation, characteristic, or ethnic background and location/origin-based surnames names also occur; they are sometimes supplemented by nicknames.

Commonly, Greek male surnames end in -s, which is the common ending for Greek masculine proper nouns in the nominative case. Exceptionally, some end in -ou, indicating the genitive case of this proper noun for patronymic reasons.

Although surnames are static today, dynamic and changing patronym usage survives in middle names in Greece where the genitive of the father&#x27;s first name is commonly the middle name.

Because of their codification in the Modern Greek state, surnames have Katharevousa forms even though Katharevousa is no longer the official standard. Thus, the Ancient Greek name Eleutherios forms the Modern Greek proper name Lefteris, and former vernacular practice (prefixing the surname to the proper name) was to call John Eleutherios Leftero-giannis.

Modern practice is to call the same person Giannis Eleftheriou: the proper name is vernacular (and not Ioannis), but the surname is an archaic genitive. However, children are almost always baptised with the archaic form of the name so in official matters, the child will be referred to as Ioannis Eleftheriou and not Giannis Eleftheriou.

Female surnames are most often in the Katharevousa genitive case of a male name. This is an innovation of the Modern Greek state; Byzantine practice was to form a feminine counterpart of the male surname (e.g. masculine Palaiologos, Byzantine feminine Palaiologina, Modern feminine Palaiologou).

In the past, women would change their surname when married to that of their husband (again in the genitive case) signifying the transfer of &quot;dependence&quot; from the father to the husband. In earlier Modern Greek society, women were named with -aina as a feminine suffix on the husband&#x27;s first name: &quot;Giorgaina&quot;, &quot;Mrs George&quot;, &quot;Wife of George&quot;. Nowadays, a woman&#x27;s legal surname does not change upon marriage, though she can use the husband&#x27;s surname socially. Children usually receive the paternal surname, though in rare cases, if the bride and groom have agreed before the marriage, the children can receive the maternal surname.

Some surnames are prefixed with Papa-, indicating ancestry from a priest, e.g. &quot;Papageorgiou&quot;, the &quot;son of a priest named George&quot;. Others, like Archi- and Mastro- signify &quot;boss&quot; and &quot;tradesman&quot; respectively.

Prefixes such as Konto-, Makro-, and Chondro- describe body characteristics, such as &quot;short&quot;, &quot;tall/long&quot; and &quot;fat&quot;. &quot;Gero-&quot; and &quot;Palaio-&quot; signify &quot;old&quot; or &quot;wise&quot;.

Other prefixes include Hadji- (Χαντζή- or Χαντζι-) which was an honorific deriving from the Arabic Hadj or pilgrimage, and indicate that the person had made a pilgrimage (in the case of Christians, to Jerusalem) and Kara- which is attributed to the Turkish word for &quot;black&quot; deriving from the Ottoman Empire era. The Turkish suffix -oglou (derived from a patronym, &quot;-oğlu&quot; in Turkish) can also be found. Although they are of course more common among Greece&#x27;s Muslim minority, they still can be found among the Christian majority, often Greeks or Karamanlides who were pressured to leave Turkey after the Turkish Republic was founded (since Turkish surnames only date to the founding of the Republic, when Atatürk made them compulsory).

Arvanitic surnames also exist; an example is &quot;Tzanavaras&quot; or &quot;Tzavaras&quot;, from the Arvanitic word &quot;çanavar&quot; or &quot;çavar&quot; meaning &quot;brave&quot; (&quot;pallikari&quot; in Greek).

Most Greek patronymic suffixes are diminutives, which vary by region. The most common Hellenic patronymic suffixes are:
* -poulos/-poulou, which has a Latin origin (&quot;pullus&quot;) and means &quot;the little&quot;, representing &quot;the son of ...&quot;, so if a man&#x27;s family name is &quot;Christopoulos&quot;, it means that his father was named &quot;Christos&quot;. This suffix is very widespread throughout Greece and is originally from the Peloponessus in particular.
* -idis/iadis/antis The suffix -idis (often transliterated &quot;-ides&quot; in English and French) is the oldest in use. Zeus, for example, was also referred to as &quot;Cronides&quot; (&quot;son of Cronus&quot;). A common suffix in Byzantium around Bithynia and Byzantine Thrace (Constantinople), also used by Pontic Greeks and Caucasus Greeks in the Pontic Alps, northeast Anatolia, Georgia, and the former Russian Caucasus region of Kars Oblast e.g. &quot;Mikhailidis&quot;, the &quot;clan of Michael&quot;
* -akis/-aki is associated primarily with Crete and the Aegean Islands. It is a patronymic signifying &quot;little&quot; and/or &quot;son&quot;; therefore &quot;Theodorakis&quot; is &quot;little Theodore&quot;.

Others, less common, are:
* -atos/-atou (from Cephallonia and other Ionian Islands)
* -as/-a/-ekas/kas (from Epirus) and Greek Macedonia
* -ellis/-elli (from Lesvos Island)
* -eas/akos/oggonas (from Mani)
* -oglou (from the Turkish suffix for &quot;child of&quot; used by both genders)
* -ou (genitive, from Cyprus)
* -ou/ides/kos (from Macedonia)
* -ekas/las (from Epirus)

Either the surname or the given name may come first in different contexts; in newspapers and in informal uses, the order is &quot;given name + surname&quot;, while in official documents and forums (tax forms, registrations, military service, school forms), the surname is often listed or said first.

===Hungary===
In Hungarian, like Asian languages but unlike most other European ones (see French and German above for exceptions), the family name is placed before the given names. This usage does not apply to non-Hungarian names, for example &quot;Tony Blair&quot; will remain &quot;Tony Blair&quot; when written in Hungarian texts.

Names of Hungarian individuals, however, appear in Western order in English writing.

===Indonesia===
Indonesians comprise more than 600 ethnic groups. Not all of these groups traditionally have surnames, and in the populous Java surnames are not common at all – regardless of which one of the six officially recognized religions the name carrier profess. For instance, a Christian Javanese woman named &quot;Agnes Mega Rosalin&quot; has three forenames and no surname. &quot;Agnes&quot; is her Christian name, but &quot;Mega&quot; can be the first name she uses and the name which she is addressed with. &quot;Rosalin&quot; is only a middle name. Nonetheless, Indonesians are well aware of the custom of family names, which is known as &quot;marga&quot; or &quot;fam&quot;, and such names have become a specific kind of identifier. People can tell what a person&#x27;s heritage is by his or her family or clan name.
* The various ethnicities of Batak people from North Sumatra are known for their strict tradition of preserving their family names, which are actually clan names. See Marga (Batak) for details.
* The matrilineal clan names of the Minangkabau people are passed down from mothers to their children. Minangkabau is the largest matrilineal society in the world.
* The Minahasan people of North Sulawesi have an extensive list of surnames, such as &quot;Toar, Lumimuut, Emor, Muntuan, Nayoan, Wenas&quot; and &quot;Luntungan&quot;.
* The Ambonese people of the Maluku Islands have family names such as &quot;Lawalata, Matulessy&quot; and &quot;Latumahina&quot;.
* The various ethnicities of Dayak people from the provinces in Kalimantan have surnames such as &quot;Dau&quot; and &quot;Narang&quot;.
* The Bugis people from South Sulawesi have surnames such as &quot;Mappanyukki, Mallarangeng&quot; and &quot;Matalatta&quot;.
* Among the Toraja people of South Sulawesi, common surname elements include &quot;Rante–, Pong–, Allo–, –bua, –linggi&quot;. Examples: &quot;Rantedatu, Ranteallo, Pongrambu, Pongtiku, Pongrangga, Allodatu, Randebua, Tanabua, Tarukbua, Datubua, Allobua, Senolinggi&quot;.

Javanese people are the majority in Indonesia, and most do not have any surname. There are some individuals, especially the old generation, who have only one name, such as &quot;Suharto&quot; and &quot;Sukarno&quot;. These are not only common with the Javanese but also with other Indonesian ethnic groups who do not have the tradition of surnames. If, however, they are Muslims, they might opt to follow Arabic naming customs, but Indonesian Muslims do not automatically follow Arabic name traditions.

In conjunction with migration to Europe or America, Indonesians without surnames often adopt a surname based on some family name or middle name. The forms for visa application many Western countries use, has a square for writing the last name which cannot be left unfilled by the applicant.

Most Chinese Indonesians substituted their Chinese surnames with Indonesian-sounding surnames due to political pressure from 1965 to 1998 under Suharto&#x27;s regime.

===Iranian/Persian/Kazan===
Persian last names may be:
* Simple nouns; e.g. Afshar (&quot;Of Afsharid dynasty&quot;), Bahar, Khayyam
* Noun plus a suffix; e.g. Golzaar (Gol + -zaar), Amouzgaar (Amouz + -gaar), Daadgar (Daad + -gar)
* More complex compound nouns; e.g. Bolurforushan (Bolur + forush + -an), Ahmedinejad (Ahmed + -i + -nejad), Farshchian (Farsh + -chi + -an)
* Two or more nouns; e.g. Mostafavi Musavi Khomeini, Hashemi Rafsanjani

Suffixes include: -an (plural suffix), -i (&quot;of&quot;), -zad/-zadeh (&quot;born of&quot;), -pur (&quot;son of&quot;), -nejad (&quot;from the race of&quot;), -nia (&quot;descendant of&quot;), -mand (&quot;having or pertaining to&quot;), -vand (&quot;succeeding&quot;), -far (&quot;holder of&quot;), -doost (&quot;-phile&quot;), -khah (&quot;seeking of&quot;), -manesh (&quot;having the manner of&quot;), -ian/-yan, -gar and -chi (&quot;whose vocation pertains&quot;).

An example is names of geographical locations plus &quot;-i&quot;: Irani (&quot;Iranian&quot;), Gilani (&quot;of Gilan province&quot;), Tabrizi (&quot;of the city of Tabriz&quot;).

Another example is last names that indicate relation to religious groups such as Zoroastrian (e.g. Goshtaspi, Namiranian, Azargoshasp), Jewish (e.g. Yaghubian [Jacobean], Hayyem [Life], Shaul [Saul]) or Muslim (e.g. Alavi, Islamnia, Montazeri)

Last names are arbitrary; their holder need not to have any relation with their meaning.

Traditionally in Iran, the wife does not take her husband&#x27;s surname, although children take the surname of their father. Individual reactions notwithstanding, it is possible to call a married woman by her husband&#x27;s surname. This is facilitated by the fact that English words &quot;Mrs.&quot;, &quot;Miss&quot;, &quot;Woman&quot;, &quot;Lady&quot; and &quot;Wife (of)&quot; in a polite context are all translated into &quot;خانم&quot; (Khaanom). Context, however, is important: &quot;خانم گلدوست&quot; (Khaanom Goldust) may, for instance, refer to the daughter of Mr. Goldust instead of his wife.
When most of Iranian surnames are used with a name, the name will be ended with a suffix _E or _ie (of) such as Hasan_e roshan (Hasan is name and roshan is surname) that means Hasan of Roshan or Mosa_ie saiidi (Muses of saiidi). The _e is not for surname and it is difficult to say it is a part of surname.

===Italy===
Italy has around 350,000 surnames. Most of them derive from the following sources: patronym or (e.g. &quot;Francesco di Marco&quot;, &quot;Francis, son of Mark&quot; or &quot;Eduardo de Filippo&quot;, &quot;Edward belonging to the family of Philip&quot;), occupation (e.g. &quot;Enzo Ferrari&quot;, &quot;Heinz (of the) Blacksmiths&quot;), personal characteristic (e.g. nicknames or pet names like &quot;Dario Forte&quot;, &quot;Darius the Strong&quot;), geographic origin (e.g. &quot;Elisabetta Romano&quot;, &quot;Elisabeth from Rome&quot;) and objects (e.g. &quot;Carlo Sacchi&quot;, &quot;Charles Bags&quot;). The two most common Italian family names, &quot;Russo&quot; and &quot;Rossi&quot;, mean the same thing, &quot;Red&quot;, possibly referring to the hair color.

Both Western and Eastern orders are used for full names: the given name usually comes first, but the family name may come first in administrative settings; lists are usually indexed according to the last name.

Since 1975, women have kept their own surname when married, but until recently (2000) they could have added the surname of the husband according to the civil code, although it was a very seldom-used practice. In recent years, the husband&#x27;s surname cannot be used in any official situation. In some unofficial situations, sometimes both surnames are written (the proper first), sometimes separated by &quot;in&quot; (e.g. &quot;Giuseppina Mauri in Crivelli&quot;) or, in case of widows, &quot;ved.&quot; (&quot;vedova&quot;).

===Latvia===
Latvian male surnames usually end in &quot;-s&quot;, &quot;-š&quot; or &quot;-is&quot; whereas the female versions of the same names end in &quot;-a&quot; or &quot;-e&quot; or &quot;s&quot; in both unmarried and married women.

Before the emancipation from serfdom (1817 in Courland, 1819 in Vidzeme, 1861 in Latgale) only noblemen, free craftsmen or people living in towns had surnames. Therefore, the oldest Latvian surnames originate from German or Low German, reflecting the dominance of German as an official language in Latvia till the 19th century. Examples: &quot;Meijers/Meijere&quot; (German: &quot;Meier&quot;, farm administrator; akin to Mayor), &quot;Millers/Millere&quot; (German: &quot;Müller&quot;, miller), &quot;Šmits/Šmite&quot; (German: &quot;Schmidt&quot;, smith), &quot;Šulcs/Šulce, Šulca&quot; (German: &quot;Schultz&quot; or &quot;Schulz&quot;, constable), &quot;Ulmanis&quot; (German: &quot;Ullmann&quot;, a person from Ulm), &quot;Godmanis&quot; (a God-man), &quot;Pētersons&quot; (son of Peter). Some Latvian surnames, mainly from Latgale are of Polish or Belarusian origin by changing the final &quot;-ski/-cki&quot; to &quot;-skis/-ckis&quot;, &quot;-czyk&quot; to &quot;-čiks&quot; or &quot;-vich/-wicz&quot; to &quot;-vičs&quot;, such as &quot;Sokolovkis/Sokolovska&quot;, &quot;Baldunčiks/Baldunčika&quot; or &quot;Ratkevičs/Ratkeviča&quot;.

Most Latvian peasants received their surnames in 1826 (in Vidzeme), in 1835 (in Courland), and in 1866 (in Latgale). Diminutives were the most common form of family names. Examples: &quot;Kalniņš/Kalniņa&quot; (small hill), &quot;Bērziņš/Bērziņa&quot; (small birch).

Nowadays many Latvians of Slavic descent have surnames of Russian, Belarusian, or Ukrainian origin, for example &quot;Volkovs/Volkova&quot; or &quot;Antoņenko&quot;.

===Lithuania===
Lithuanian names follow the Baltic distinction between male and female suffixes of names, although the details are different. Male surnames usually end in &quot;-a&quot;, &quot;-as&quot;, &quot;-aitis&quot;, &quot;-ys&quot;, &quot;-ius&quot;, or &quot;-us&quot;, whereas the female versions change these suffixes to &quot;-aitė, -ytė, -iūtė&quot;, and &quot;-utė&quot; respectively (if unmarried), &quot;-ienė&quot; (if married), or &quot;-ė&quot; (not indicating the marital status). Some Lithuanians have names of Polish or another Slavic origin, which are made to conform to Lithuanian by changing the final &quot;-ski&quot; to &quot;-skas&quot;, such as &quot;Sadauskas&quot;, with the female version bein -&quot;skaitė&quot; (if unmarried), &quot;-skienė&quot; (if married), or &quot;-skė&quot; (not indicating the marital status).

===Malta===
Different cultures have their impact on the demographics of the Maltese islands, and this is evident in the various surnames Maltese citizens bear nowadays. There are very few &quot;Maltese&quot; surnames per se: the few that originate from Maltese places of origin include &quot;Chircop&quot; (Kirkop), &quot;Lia&quot; (Lija), &quot;Balzan&quot; (Balzan), &quot;Valletta&quot; (Valletta), and &quot;Sciberras&quot; (Xebb ir-Ras Hill, on which Valletta was built). The village of Munxar, Gozo is characterised by the majority of its population having one of two surnames, either &quot;Curmi&quot; or &quot;de Brincat&quot;. In Gozo, the surnames &quot;Bajada&quot; and &quot;Farrugia&quot; are also common.
* Sicilian and Italian surnames
Sicilian and Italian surnames are common due to the close vicinity to Malta. Sicilians were the first to colonise the Maltese islands. Common examples include &quot;Azzopardi&quot;, &quot;Bonello&quot;, &quot;Cauchi&quot;, &quot;Farrugia&quot;, &quot;Gauci&quot;, &quot;Rizzo&quot;, &quot;Schembri&quot;, &quot;Tabone&quot;, &quot;Vassallo&quot;, &quot;Vella&quot;.
* French surnames
Common examples include &quot;Depuis&quot;, &quot;Montfort&quot;, &quot;Monsenuier&quot;, &quot;Tafel&quot;.
* English surnames
English surnames exist for a number of reasons, but mainly due to migration as well as Malta forming a part of the British Empire in the 19th century and most of the 20th. Common examples include &quot;Bone&quot;, &quot;Harding&quot;, &quot;Atkins&quot;, &quot;Mattocks&quot;, &quot;Smith&quot;, &quot;Jones&quot;, &quot;Woods&quot;, &quot;Turner&quot;, &quot;Littlejohn&quot;.
* Sicilian Arabic surnames
Arabic surnames occur in part due to the early presence of the Arabs in Malta. Common examples include &quot;Sammut&quot;, &quot;Camilleri&quot;, &quot;Zammit&quot;, and &quot;Xuereb&quot;.
* Spanish surnames
Common surnames of Spanish origin include &quot;Abela&quot;, &quot;Galdes&quot;, &quot;Herrera&quot;, and &quot;Guzman&quot;.
* German surnames
Surnames from foreign countries from the Middle Ages include German,
such as &quot;von Brockdorff&quot;, &quot;Hyzler&quot;, and &quot;Schranz&quot;.
* Greek surnames
Many of the earliest Maltese surnames are Sicilian Greek, e.g. &quot;Cilia&quot;, &quot;Calleja&quot;, &quot;Brincat&quot;, &quot;Cauchi&quot;. Much less common are recent surnames from Greece; examples include &quot;Dacoutros&quot;, and &quot;Trakosopoulos&quot;
* Jewish surnames
The original Jewish community of Malta and Gozo has left no trace of their presence on the islands since they were expelled in January 1493.
* Customs
In line with the practice in other Christian, European states, women generally assume their husband&#x27;s surname after legal marriage, and this is passed on to any children the couple may bear. Some women opt to retain their old name, for professional/personal reasons, or combine their surname with that of their husband.

===Mongolia===
Mongolians do not use surnames in the way that most Westerners, Chinese or Japanese do. Since the socialist period, patronymics – then called &quot;ovog&quot;, now called &quot;etsgiin ner&quot; – are used instead of a surname. If the father&#x27;s name is unknown, a matronymic is used. The patro- or matronymic is written before the given name. Therefore, if a man with given name Tsakhia has a son, and gives the son the name Elbegdorj, the son&#x27;s full name is Tsakhia Elbegdorj. Very frequently, the patronymic is given in genitive case, i.e. Tsakhiagiin Elbegdorj. However, the patronymic is rather insignificant in everyday use and usually just given as an initial – Ts. Elbegdorj. People are normally just referred to and addressed by their given name (Elbegdorj &quot;guai&quot; – Mr. Elbegdorj), and if two people share a common given name, they are usually just kept apart by their initials, not by the full patronymic.

Since 2000, Mongolians have been officially using clan names – &quot;ovog&quot;, the same word that had been used for the patronymics before – on their IDs. Many people chose the names of the ancient clans and tribes such Borjigin, Besud, Jalair, etc. Also many extended families chose the names of the native places of their ancestors. Some chose the names of their most ancient known ancestor. Some just decided to pass their own given names (or modifications of their given names) to their descendants as clan names. Some chose other attributes of their lives as surnames. Gürragchaa chose Sansar (Cosmos). Clan names precede the patronymics and given names, e.g. Besud Tsakhiagiin Elbegdorj. These clan names have a significance and are included in Mongolian passports.

===Myanmar (Burma)===
People from Myanmar or Burmese, have no family names. This, to some, is the only known Asian people having no family names at all. Some of those from Myanmar or Burma, who are familiar with European or American cultures, began to put to their younger generations with a family name – adopted from the notable ancestors. For example, Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi is the daughter of the late Father of Independence General Aung San; Hayma Ne Win, is the daughter of the famous actor Kawleikgyin Ne Win etc.

===Philippines===


Until the middle of the 19th century, there was no standardization of surnames in the Philippines. There were native Filipinos without surnames, others whose surnames deliberately did not match that of their families, as well as those who took certain surnames simply because they had a certain prestige, usually ones related to the Roman Catholic religion, such as de los Santos (&quot;of the saints&quot;) and de la Cruz (&quot;of the cross&quot;), or of local nobility such as of rajahs or &quot;datus&quot;.

On 21 November 1849, the Spanish Governor-General of the Philippines, Narciso Clavería y Zaldúa, decreed an end to these arbitrary practices, the systematic distribution of surnames to Filipinos without prior surnames and the universal implementation of the Spanish naming system. This produced the &quot;Catálogo alfabético de apellidos&quot; (&quot;Alphabetical Catalogue of Surnames&quot;), which listed permitted surnames with origins in Spanish, Filipino, and Hispanized Chinese words, names, and numbers. Thus, many Spanish-sounding Filipino surnames are not surnames common to the rest of the Spanish-speaking world. The book contained many words coming from Spanish and the Philippine languages such as Tagalog, as well as many Basque and Catalan surnames.

The colonial authorities implemented this decree because many Christianized Filipinos assumed religious names. There soon were too many people surnamed &quot;de los Santos&quot; (&quot;of the saints&quot;), &quot;de la Cruz&quot; (&quot;of the cross&quot;), &quot;del Rosario&quot; (&quot;of the Rosary&quot;) etc., which made it difficult for the Spanish colonists to control the Filipino people, and most importantly, to collect taxes. These extremely common names were also banned by the decree unless the name has been used by a family for at least four generations. This Spanish naming custom also countered the native custom before the Spanish period, wherein siblings assumed different surnames. Clavería&#x27;s decree was enforced to different degrees in different parts of the colony.

Because of this implementation of Spanish naming customs, of the arrangement &quot;given name + paternal surname + maternal surname&quot;, in the Philippines, a Spanish surname does not necessarily denote Spanish ancestry.

In practice, the application of this decree varied from municipality to municipality. Most municipalities received surnames starting with only one initial letter; in others, this was not well enforced. For example, the majority of residents of the island of Banton in the province of Romblon have surnames starting with F such as &quot;Fabicon&quot;, &quot;Fallarme&quot;, &quot;Fadrilan&quot;, and &quot;Ferran&quot;. Other examples are most cities and towns in Albay, Catanduanes, Ilocos Sur and Marinduque, where the majority of their residents have surnames beginning with a particular letter.

Thus, although perhaps a majority of Filipinos have Spanish surnames, such a surname does not indicate Spanish ancestry. In addition, most Filipinos currently do not use Spanish accented letters in their Spanish derived names. The lack of accents in Filipino Spanish has been attributed to the lack of accents on the predominantly American typewriters after the United States gained control of the Philippines.

The vast majority of Filipinos follow a naming system in the American order (i.e. given name + middle name + surname), which is the reverse of the Spanish naming order (i.e. given name + paternal surname + maternal surname). Children take the mother&#x27;s surname as their middle name, followed by their father&#x27;s as their surname; for example, a son of Juan de la Cruz and his wife María Agbayani may be David Agbayani de la Cruz. Women usually take the surnames of their husband upon marriage, and consequently lose their maiden middle names; so upon her marriage to David de la Cruz, the full name of Laura Yuchengco Macaraeg would become Laura Macaraeg de la Cruz. Their maiden last names automatically become their middle names upon marriage.

There are other sources for surnames. Many Filipinos also have Chinese-derived surnames, which in some cases could indicate Chinese ancestry. Many Hispanized Chinese numerals and other Hispanized Chinese words, however, were also among the surnames in the &quot;Catálogo alfabético de apellidos&quot;. For those whose surname may indicate Chinese ancestry, analysis of the surname may help to pinpoint when those ancestors arrived in the Philippines. A Hispanized Chinese surname such as Cojuangco suggests an 18th-century arrival while a Chinese surname such as Lim suggests a relatively recent immigration. Some Chinese surnames such as Tiu-Laurel are composed of the immigrant Chinese ancestor&#x27;s surname as well as the name of that ancestor&#x27;s godparent on receiving Christian baptism.

In the predominantly Muslim areas of the southern Philippines, adoption of surnames was influenced by Islamic religious terms. As a result, surnames among Filipino Muslims are largely Arabic-based, and include such surnames as Hassan and Haradji.

There are also Filipinos who, to this day, have no surnames at all, particularly if they come from indigenous cultural communities.

====Naming customs in the Philippines====
Prior to the establishment of the Philippines as a US territory during the earlier part of the 20th century, Filipinos usually followed Iberian naming customs. However, upon the promulgation of the Family Code of 1987, Filipinos formalized adopting the American system of using their surnames.

A common Filipino name will consist of the given name (mostly 2 given names are given), the initial letter of the mother&#x27;s maiden name and finally the father&#x27;s surname (i.e. Lucy Anne C. de Guzman). Also, women are allowed to retain their maiden name or use both her and her husband&#x27;s surname as a double-barreled surname, separated by a dash. This is common in feminist circles or when the woman holds a prominent office (e.g. Gloria Macapagal Arroyo, Miriam Defensor Santiago). In more traditional circles, especially those who belong to the prominent families in the provinces, the custom of the woman being addressed as &quot;Mrs. Husband&#x27;s Full Name&quot; is still common.

For widows, who chose to marry again, two norms are in existence. For those who were widowed before the Family Code, the full name of the woman remains while the surname of the deceased husband is attached. That is, Maria Andres, who was widowed by Ignacio Dimaculangan will have the name Maria Andres viuda de Dimaculangan. If she chooses to marry again, this name will still continue to exist while the surname of the new husband is attached. Thus, if Maria marries Rene de los Santos, her new name will be Maria Andres viuda de Dimaculangan de los Santos.

However, a new norm is also in existence. The woman may choose to use her husband&#x27;s surname to be one of her middle names. Thus, Maria Andres viuda de Dimaculangan de los Santos may also be called Maria A.D. de los Santos.

Children will however automatically inherit their father&#x27;s surname if they are considered legitimate. If the child is born out of wedlock, the mother will automatically pass her surname to the child, unless the father gives a written acknowledgment of paternity. The father may also choose to give the child both his parents&#x27; surnames if he wishes (that is Gustavo Paredes, whose parents are Eulogio Paredes and Juliana Angeles, while having Maria Solis as a wife, may name his child Kevin S. Angeles-Paredes.

In some Tagalog regions, the norm of giving patronyms, or in some cases matronyms, is also accepted. These names are of course not official, since family names in the Philippines are inherited. It is not uncommon to refer to someone as Juan anak ni Pablo (John, the son of Paul) or Juan apo ni Teofilo (John, the grandson of Theophilus).

===Romania===
In Romania, like in most of Europe, it is customary for a child to take his father&#x27;s family name, and a wife to take her husband&#x27;s last name. However, this is not compulsory spouses and parents are allowed to choose other options too, as the law is flexible (see Art. 282, Art. 449 Art. 450. of the Civil Code of Romania).

Until the 19th century, the names were primarily of the form &quot;[given name] [father&#x27;s name] [grandfather&#x27;s name]&quot;. The few exceptions are usually famous people or the nobility (boyars). The name reform introduced around 1850 had the names changed to a western style, most likely imported from France, consisting of a given name followed by a family name.

As such, the name is called &quot;prenume&quot; (French &quot;prénom&quot;), while the family name is called &quot;nume&quot; or, when otherwise ambiguous, &quot;nume de familie&quot; (&quot;family name&quot;). Although not mandatory, middle names are common.

Historically, when the family name reform was introduced in the mid-19th century, the default was to use a patronym, or a matronym when the father was dead or unknown. A common convention was to append the suffix &quot;-escu&quot; to the father&#x27;s name, e.g. &quot;Anghelescu&quot; (&quot;&quot;Anghel&#x27;s&quot; child&quot;) and &quot;Petrescu&quot; (&quot;&quot;Petre&#x27;s&quot; child&quot;). (The &quot;-escu&quot; seems to come from Latin &quot;-iscum&quot;, thus being cognate with Italian &quot;-esco&quot; and French &quot;-esque&quot;.) Another common convention was to append the suffix &quot;-eanu&quot; to the name of the place of origin, e.g. &quot;Munteanu&quot; (&quot;from the mountains&quot;) and &quot;Moldoveanu&quot; (&quot;from &quot;Moldova&quot;&quot;). These uniquely Romanian suffixes strongly identify ancestral nationality.

There are also descriptive family names derived from occupations, nicknames, and events, e.g. &quot;Botezatu&quot; (&quot;baptised&quot;), &quot;Barbu&quot; (&quot;bushy bearded&quot;), &quot;Prodan&quot; (&quot;foster&quot;), &quot;Bălan&quot; (&quot;blond&quot;), &quot;Fieraru&quot; (&quot;smith&quot;), &quot;Croitoru&quot; (&quot;tailor&quot;), &quot;Păcuraru&quot; (&quot;shepherd&quot;).

Romanian family names remain the same regardless of the sex of the person.

Although given names appear before family names in most Romanian contexts, official documents invert the order, ostensibly for filing purposes. Correspondingly, Romanians occasionally introduce themselves with their family names first, e.g. a student signing a test paper in school.

Romanians bearing names of non-Romanian origin often adopt Romanianised versions of their ancestral surnames. For example, &quot;Jurovschi&quot; for Polish &quot;Żurowski&quot;, or Popovici for Serbian Popović (&quot;son of a priest&quot;), which preserves the original pronunciation of the surname through transliteration. In some cases, these changes were mandated by the state.

===Turkey===
In Turkey, following the Surname Law imposed in 1934 in the context of Atatürk&#x27;s Reforms, every family living in Turkey was given a family name. The surname was generally selected by the elderly people of the family and could be any Turkish word (or a permitted word for families belonging to official minority groups).

Some of the most common family names in Turkey are &quot;Yılmaz&quot; (&#x27;undaunted&#x27;), &quot;Doğan&quot; (&#x27;falcon&#x27;), &quot;Şahin&quot; (&#x27;hawk&#x27;), &quot;Yıldırım&quot; (&#x27;thunderbolt&#x27;), &quot;Şimşek&quot; (&#x27;lightning&#x27;), &quot;Öztürk&quot; (&#x27;purely Turkish&#x27;).

Patronymic surnames do not necessarily refer to ancestry, or in most cases cannot be traced back historically. The most usual Turkish patronymic suffix is &quot;–oğlu&quot;; &quot;–ov(a)&quot;, &quot;–yev(a)&quot; and &quot;–zade&quot; also occur in the surnames of Azeri or other Turkic descendants.

Official minorities like Armenians, Greeks, and Jews have surnames in their own mother languages.
The Armenian families living in Turkey usually have Armenian surnames and generally have the suffix &quot;–yan&quot;, &quot;–ian&quot;, or, using Turkish spelling, &quot;-can&quot;. Greek descendants usually have Greek surnames which might have Greek suffixes like &quot;–ou&quot;, &quot;–aki(s)&quot;, &quot;–poulos/poulou&quot;, &quot;–idis/idou&quot;, &quot;–iadis/iadou&quot; or prefixes like &quot;papa–&quot;.
The Sephardic Jews who were expelled from Spain and settled in Turkey in 1492 have both Jewish/Hebrew surnames, and Spanish surnames, usually indicating their native regions, cities or villages back in Spain, like &quot;De Leon&quot; or &quot;Toledano&quot;.

<text>The franc is any of various units of currency. One franc is typically divided into 100 centimes. The name is said to derive from the Latin inscription &quot;francorum rex&quot; (King of the Franks) used on early French coins and until the 18th century, or from the French &quot;franc&quot;, meaning &quot;frank&quot; (and &quot;free&quot; in certain contexts, such as &quot;coup franc&quot;, &quot;free kick&quot;).

The countries that use francs today include Switzerland, Liechtenstein, and most of Francophone Africa. The Swiss franc is a major world currency today due to the prominence of Swiss financial institutions.

Before the introduction of the euro in 1999, francs were also used in France, Belgium and Luxembourg, while Andorra and Monaco accepted the French franc as legal tender (Monégasque franc). The franc was also used in French colonies including Algeria and Cambodia. The franc is sometimes Italianised or Hispanicised as the &quot;franco&quot;, for instance in Luccan franco.

==Origins==

The franc was originally a French gold coin of 3.87 g minted in 1360 on the occasion of the release of King John II (&quot;the Good&quot;), held by the English since his capture at the Battle of Poitiers four years earlier. It was equivalent to one &quot;livre tournois&quot; (Tours pound).

==French franc==

The French franc was originally a gold coin issued in France from 1360 until 1380, then a silver coin issued between 1575 and 1641. The franc finally became the national currency from 1795 until 1999 (franc coins and notes were legal tender until 2002). Though abolished as a legal coin by King Louis XIII in 1641 in favor of the gold louis and silver écu, the term franc continued to be used in common parlance for the livre tournois. The franc was also minted for many of the former French colonies, such as Morocco, Algeria, French West Africa, and others. Today, after independence, many of these countries continue to use the franc as their standard denomination.

The value of the French franc was locked to the euro at 1 euro = 6.55957 FRF on 31 December 1998, and after the introduction of the euro notes and coins, ceased to be legal tender after 28 February 2002, although they were still exchangeable at banks until 19 February 2012.

==CFA and CFP francs==
Fourteen African countries use the franc CFA (in west Africa, &quot;Communauté financière africaine&quot;; in equatorial Africa, &quot;Coopération financière en Afrique centrale&quot;), originally (1945) worth 1.7 French francs and then from 1948, 2 francs (from 1960: 0.02 new franc) but after January 1994 worth only 0.01 French franc. Therefore, from January 1999, 1 CFA franc is equivalent to €0.00152449.

A separate (franc CFP) circulates in France&#x27;s Pacific territories, worth €0.0084 (formerly 0.055 French franc).

==Comorian franc==
In 1981, the Comoros established an arrangement with the French government similar to that of the CFA franc. Originally, 50 Comorian francs were worth 1 French franc. In January 1994, the rate was changed to 75 Comorian francs to the French franc. Since 1999, the currency has been pegged to the euro.

==Belgian franc and Luxembourg franc==

The conquest of most of western Europe by Revolutionary and Napoleonic France led to the franc&#x27;s wide circulation. Following independence from the Kingdom of the Netherlands, the new Kingdom of Belgium in 1832 adopted its own Belgian franc, equivalent to the French one, followed by Luxembourg adopting the Luxembourgish franc in 1848 and Switzerland in 1850. Newly unified Italy adopted the lira on a similar basis in 1862.

In 1865, France, Belgium, Switzerland and Italy created the Latin Monetary Union (to be joined by Spain and Greece in 1868): each would possess a national currency unit (franc, lira, peseta, drachma) worth 4.5 g of silver or of gold (fine), all freely exchangeable at a rate of 1:1. In the 1870s the gold value was made the fixed standard, a situation which was to continue until 1914.

In 1926, Belgium as well as France experienced depreciation and an abrupt collapse of confidence, leading to the introduction of a new gold currency for international transactions, the &quot;belga&quot; of 5 francs, and the country&#x27;s withdrawal from the monetary union, which ceased to exist at the end of the year. The 1921 monetary union of Belgium and Luxembourg survived and formed the basis for full economic union in 1932.

Like the French franc, the Belgian and Luxembourg francs ceased to exist on 1 January 1999, when they became fixed at 1 EUR = 40.3399 BEF/LUF, thus a Belgian or Luxembourg franc was worth €0.024789. Old franc coins and notes lost their legal tender status on 28 February 2002.

One Luxembourg franc was equal to one Belgian franc. Belgian francs were legal tender inside Luxembourg, and Luxembourg francs were legal tender in the whole of Belgium. (In reality, Luxembourg francs were only accepted as means of payment by shops and businesses in the Belgian province of Luxembourg adjacent to the independent Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, this for historical reasons.)

The equivalent name of the Belgian franc in Dutch and German, Belgium&#x27;s other official languages, was . As mentioned before, in Luxembourg the franc was called (plural ) in Luxembourgish.

==Swiss franc and Liechtenstein franc==
The Swiss franc (ISO code: CHF or 756; ; ), which appreciated significantly against the new European currency from April to September 2000, remains one of the world&#x27;s strongest currencies, worth just over one euro. The Swiss franc is used in Switzerland and in Liechtenstein. Liechtenstein retains the ability to mint its own currency, the Liechtenstein franc, which it does from time to time for commemorative or emergency purposes.

The name of the country &quot;Swiss Confederation&quot; is found on some of the coins in Latin (&quot;Confoederatio Helvetica&quot;), as Switzerland has four official languages, all of which are used on the notes. The denomination is abbreviated &quot;Fr.&quot; on the coins which is the abbreviation in all four languages.

==Saar franc==
The Saar franc, linked at par to the French franc, was introduced in the Saar Protectorate in 1948. On 1 January 1957, the territory joined the Federal Republic of Germany, nevertheless, in its new member state of Saarland, the Saar franc continued to be the currency until 6 July 1959.

The name of the Saar franc in German, the main official language in the Protectorate, was &quot;Franken&quot;. Coins displaying German inscriptions and the coat of arms of the Protectorate were circulated and used together with French francs. As banknotes, only French franc bills existed.

<text>The Federal Reserve System (often shortened to the Federal Reserve, or simply the Fed) is the central banking system of the United States. It was created on December 23, 1913, with the enactment of the Federal Reserve Act, after a series of financial panics (particularly the panic of 1907) led to the desire for central control of the monetary system in order to alleviate financial crises. Over the years, events such as the Great Depression in the 1930s and the Great Recession during the 2000s have led to the expansion of the roles and responsibilities of the Federal Reserve System.

Congress established three key objectives for monetary policy in the Federal Reserve Act: maximizing employment, stabilizing prices, and moderating long-term interest rates. The first two objectives are sometimes referred to as the Federal Reserve&#x27;s dual mandate. Its duties have expanded over the years, and currently also include supervising and regulating banks, maintaining the stability of the financial system, and providing financial services to depository institutions, the U.S. government, and foreign official institutions. The Fed also conducts research into the economy and provides numerous publications, such as the Beige Book and the FRED database.

The Federal Reserve System is composed of several layers. It is governed by the presidentially-appointed board of governors or Federal Reserve Board (FRB). Twelve regional Federal Reserve Banks, located in cities throughout the nation, regulate and oversee privately owned commercial banks. Nationally chartered commercial banks are required to hold stock in, and can elect some board members of, the Federal Reserve Bank of their region.

The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) sets monetary policy by adjusting the target for the federal funds rate, which generally influences market interest rates and, in turn, US economic activity via the monetary transmission mechanism. The FOMC consists of all seven members of the board of governors and the twelve regional Federal Reserve Bank presidents, though only five bank presidents vote at a time—the president of the New York Fed and four others who rotate through one-year voting terms. There are also various advisory councils. It has a structure unique among central banks, and is also unusual in that the United States Department of the Treasury, an entity outside of the central bank, prints the currency used.

The federal government sets the salaries of the board&#x27;s seven governors, and it receives all the system&#x27;s annual profits after dividends on member banks&#x27; capital investments are paid, and an account surplus is maintained. In 2015, the Federal Reserve earned a net income of $100.2 billion and transferred $97.7 billion to the U.S. Treasury, and 2020 earnings were approximately $88.6 billion with remittances to the U.S. Treasury of $86.9 billion. Although an instrument of the U.S. government, the Federal Reserve System considers itself &quot;an independent central bank because its monetary policy decisions do not have to be approved by the president or by anyone else in the executive or legislative branches of government, it does not receive funding appropriated by Congress, and the terms of the members of the board of governors span multiple presidential and congressional terms.&quot; The Federal Reserve has been criticized by some for its approach to managing inflation, perceived lack of transparency, and its role in economic downturns.

== Purpose ==
The primary declared motivation for creating the Federal Reserve System was to address banking panics. Other purposes are stated in the Federal Reserve Act, such as &quot;to furnish an elastic currency, to afford means of rediscounting commercial paper, to establish a more effective supervision of banking in the United States, and for other purposes&quot;. Before the founding of the Federal Reserve System, the United States underwent several financial crises. A particularly severe crisis in 1907 led Congress to enact the Federal Reserve Act in 1913. Today the Federal Reserve System has responsibilities in addition to stabilizing the financial system.

Current functions of the Federal Reserve System include:
* To address the problem of banking panics
* To serve as the central bank for the United States
* To strike a balance between private interests of banks and the centralized responsibility of government
** To supervise and regulate banking institutions
** To protect the credit rights of consumers
* To conduct monetary policy by influencing market interest rates to achieve the sometimes-conflicting goals of
** maximum employment
** stable prices, interpreted as an inflation rate of 2 percent per year on average
** moderate long-term interest rates
* To maintain the stability of the financial system and contain systemic risk in financial markets
* To provide financial services to depository institutions, the U.S. government, and foreign official institutions, including playing a major role in operating the nation&#x27;s payments system
** To facilitate the exchange of payments among regions
** To respond to local liquidity needs
* To strengthen U.S. standing in the world economy
=== Addressing the problem of bank panics ===
Banking institutions in the United States are required to hold reservesamounts of currency and deposits in other banksequal to only a fraction of the amount of the bank&#x27;s deposit liabilities owed to customers. This practice is called fractional-reserve banking. As a result, banks usually invest the majority of the funds received from depositors. On rare occasions, too many of the bank&#x27;s customers will withdraw their savings and the bank will need help from another institution to continue operating; this is called a bank run. Bank runs can lead to a multitude of social and economic problems. The Federal Reserve System was designed as an attempt to prevent or minimize the occurrence of bank runs, and possibly act as a lender of last resort when a bank run does occur. Many economists, following Nobel laureate Milton Friedman, believe that the Federal Reserve inappropriately refused to lend money to small banks during the bank runs of 1929; Friedman argued that this contributed to the Great Depression.

==== Check clearing system ====
Because some banks refused to clear checks from certain other banks during times of economic uncertainty, a check-clearing system was created in the Federal Reserve System. It is briefly described in &quot;The Federal Reserve SystemPurposes and Functions&quot; as follows:

==== Lender of last resort ====
In the United States, the Federal Reserve serves as the lender of last resort to those institutions that cannot obtain credit elsewhere and the collapse of which would have serious implications for the economy. It took over this role from the private sector &quot;clearing houses&quot; which operated during the Free Banking Era; whether public or private, the availability of liquidity was intended to prevent bank runs.

==== Fluctuations ====
Through its discount window and credit operations, Reserve Banks provide liquidity to banks to meet short-term needs stemming from seasonal fluctuations in deposits or unexpected withdrawals. Longer-term liquidity may also be provided in exceptional circumstances. The rate the Fed charges banks for these loans is called the discount rate (officially the primary credit rate).

By making these loans, the Fed serves as a buffer against unexpected day-to-day fluctuations in reserve demand and supply. This contributes to the effective functioning of the banking system, alleviates pressure in the reserves market and reduces the extent of unexpected movements in the interest rates. For example, on September 16, 2008, the Federal Reserve Board authorized an $85 billion loan to stave off the bankruptcy of international insurance giant American International Group (AIG).

=== Central bank ===

In its role as the central bank of the United States, the Fed serves as a banker&#x27;s bank and as the government&#x27;s bank. As the banker&#x27;s bank, it helps to assure the safety and efficiency of the payments system. As the government&#x27;s bank or fiscal agent, the Fed processes a variety of financial transactions involving trillions of dollars. Just as an individual might keep an account at a bank, the U.S. Treasury keeps a checking account with the Federal Reserve, through which incoming federal tax deposits and outgoing government payments are handled. As part of this service relationship, the Fed sells and redeems U.S. government securities such as savings bonds and Treasury bills, notes and bonds. It also issues the nation&#x27;s coin and paper currency. The U.S. Treasury, through its Bureau of the Mint and Bureau of Engraving and Printing, actually produces the nation&#x27;s cash supply and, in effect, sells the paper currency to the Federal Reserve Banks at manufacturing cost, and the coins at face value. The Federal Reserve Banks then distribute it to other financial institutions in various ways. During the Fiscal Year 2020, the Bureau of Engraving and Printing delivered 57.95 billion notes at an average cost of 7.4 cents per note.

==== Federal funds ====
Federal funds are the reserve balances (also called Federal Reserve Deposits) that private banks keep at their local Federal Reserve Bank. These balances are the namesake reserves of the Federal Reserve System. The purpose of keeping funds at a Federal Reserve Bank is to have a mechanism for private banks to lend funds to one another. This market for funds plays an important role in the Federal Reserve System as it is the basis for its monetary policy work. Monetary policy is put into effect partly by influencing how much interest the private banks charge each other for the lending of these funds.

Federal reserve accounts contain federal reserve credit, which can be converted into federal reserve notes. Private banks maintain their bank reserves in federal reserve accounts.

=== Bank regulation ===
The Federal Reserve regulates private banks. The system was designed out of a compromise between the competing philosophies of privatization and government regulation. In 2006 Donald L. Kohn, vice chairman of the board of governors, summarized the history of this compromise:

The balance between private interests and government can also be seen in the structure of the system. Private banks elect members of the board of directors at their regional Federal Reserve Bank while the members of the board of governors are selected by the president of the United States and confirmed by the Senate.

==== Government regulation and supervision ====
The Federal Banking Agency Audit Act, enacted in 1978 as Public Law 95-320 and 31 U.S.C. section 714 establish that the board of governors of the Federal Reserve System and the Federal Reserve banks may be audited by the Government Accountability Office (GAO).

The GAO has authority to audit check-processing, currency storage and shipments, and some regulatory and bank examination functions–though there are restrictions to what the GAO may audit. Under the Federal Banking Agency Audit Act, 31 U.S.C. section 714(b), audits of the Federal Reserve Board and Federal Reserve banks do not include (1) transactions for or with a foreign central bank or government or non-private international financing organization; (2) deliberations, decisions, or actions on monetary policy matters; (3) transactions made under the direction of the Federal Open Market Committee; or (4) a part of a discussion or communication among or between members of the board of governors and officers and employees of the Federal Reserve System related to items (1), (2), or (3). See Federal Reserve System Audits: Restrictions on GAO&#x27;s Access (GAO/T-GGD-94-44), statement of Charles A. Bowsher.

The board of governors in the Federal Reserve System has a number of supervisory and regulatory responsibilities in the U.S. banking system, but not complete responsibility. A general description of the types of regulation and supervision involved in the U.S. banking system is given by the Federal Reserve:

===== Regulatory and oversight responsibilities =====
The board of directors of each Federal Reserve Bank District also has regulatory and supervisory responsibilities. If the board of directors of a district bank has judged that a member bank is performing or behaving poorly, it will report this to the board of governors. This policy is described in law:

=== National payments system ===
The Federal Reserve plays a role in the U.S. payments system. The twelve Federal Reserve Banks provide banking services to depository institutions and to the federal government. For depository institutions, they maintain accounts and provide various payment services, including collecting checks, electronically transferring funds, and distributing and receiving currency and coin. For the federal government, the Reserve Banks act as fiscal agents, paying Treasury checks; processing electronic payments; and issuing, transferring, and redeeming U.S. government securities.

In the Depository Institutions Deregulation and Monetary Control Act of 1980, Congress reaffirmed that the Federal Reserve should promote an efficient nationwide payments system. The act subjects all depository institutions, not just member commercial banks, to reserve requirements and grants them equal access to Reserve Bank payment services.
The Federal Reserve plays a role in the nation&#x27;s retail and wholesale payments systems by providing financial services to depository institutions. Retail payments are generally for relatively small-dollar amounts and often involve a depository institution&#x27;s retail clientsindividuals and smaller businesses. The Reserve Banks&#x27; retail services include distributing currency and coin, collecting checks, electronically transferring funds through FedACH (the Federal Reserve&#x27;s automated clearing house system), and beginning in 2023, facilitating instant payments using the FedNow service. By contrast, wholesale payments are generally for large-dollar amounts and often involve a depository institution&#x27;s large corporate customers or counterparties, including other financial institutions. The Reserve Banks&#x27; wholesale services include electronically transferring funds through the Fedwire Funds Service and transferring securities issued by the U.S. government, its agencies, and certain other entities through the Fedwire Securities Service.

== Structure ==

The Federal Reserve System has a &quot;unique structure that is both public and private&quot; and is described as &quot;independent within the government&quot; rather than &quot;independent of government&quot;. The System does not require public funding, and derives its authority and purpose from the Federal Reserve Act, which was passed by Congress in 1913 and is subject to Congressional modification or repeal. The four main components of the Federal Reserve System are (1) the board of governors, (2) the Federal Open Market Committee, (3) the twelve regional Federal Reserve Banks, and (4) the member banks throughout the country.

=== Board of governors ===
The seven-member board of governors is a large federal agency that functions in business oversight by examining national banks. It is charged with the overseeing of the 12 District Reserve Banks and setting national monetary policy. It also supervises and regulates the U.S. banking system in general.
Governors are appointed by the president of the United States and confirmed by the Senate for staggered 14-year terms. One term begins every two years, on February 1 of even-numbered years, and members serving a full term cannot be renominated for a second term. &quot;[U]pon the expiration of their terms of office, members of the Board shall continue to serve until their successors are appointed and have qualified.&quot; The law provides for the removal of a member of the board by the president &quot;for cause&quot;. The board is required to make an annual report of operations to the Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives.

The chair and vice chair of the board of governors are appointed by the president from among the sitting governors. They both serve a four-year term and they can be renominated as many times as the president chooses, until their terms on the board of governors expire.

==== List of members of the board of governors ====

The current members of the board of governors are:

==== Nominations, confirmations and resignations ====
In late December 2011, President Barack Obama nominated Jeremy C. Stein, a Harvard University finance professor and a Democrat, and Jerome Powell, formerly of Dillon Read, Bankers Trust and The Carlyle Group and a Republican. Both candidates also have Treasury Department experience in the Obama and George H. W. Bush administrations respectively.

&quot;Obama administration officials [had] regrouped to identify Fed candidates after Peter Diamond, a Nobel Prize-winning economist, withdrew his nomination to the board in June [2011] in the face of Republican opposition. Richard Clarida, a potential nominee who was a Treasury official under George W. Bush, pulled out of consideration in August [2011]&quot;, one account of the December nominations noted. The two other Obama nominees in 2011, Janet Yellen and Sarah Bloom Raskin, were confirmed in September. One of the vacancies was created in 2011 with the resignation of Kevin Warsh, who took office in 2006 to fill the unexpired term ending January 31, 2018, and resigned his position effective March 31, 2011. In March 2012, U.S. Senator David Vitter (R, LA) said he would oppose Obama&#x27;s Stein and Powell nominations, dampening near-term hopes for approval. However, Senate leaders reached a deal, paving the way for affirmative votes on the two nominees in May 2012 and bringing the board to full strength for the first time since 2006 with Duke&#x27;s service after term end. Later, on January 6, 2014, the United States Senate confirmed Yellen&#x27;s nomination to be chair of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors; she was the first woman to hold the position. Subsequently, President Obama nominated Stanley Fischer to replace Yellen as the vice-chair.

In April 2014, Stein announced he was leaving to return to Harvard on May 28 with four years remaining on his term. At the time of the announcement, the FOMC &quot;already is down three members as it awaits the Senate confirmation of ... Fischer and Lael Brainard, and as [President] Obama has yet to name a replacement for ... Duke. ... Powell is still serving as he awaits his confirmation for a second term.&quot;

Allan R. Landon, former president and CEO of the Bank of Hawaii, was nominated in early 2015 by President Obama to the board.

In July 2015, President Obama nominated University of Michigan economist Kathryn M. Dominguez to fill the second vacancy on the board. The Senate had not yet acted on Landon&#x27;s confirmation by the time of the second nomination.

Daniel Tarullo submitted his resignation from the board on February 10, 2017, effective on or around April 5, 2017.

=== Federal Open Market Committee ===
The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) consists of 12 members, seven from the board of governors and 5 of the regional Federal Reserve Bank presidents. The FOMC oversees and sets policy on open market operations, the principal tool of national monetary policy. These operations affect the amount of Federal Reserve balances available to depository institutions, thereby influencing overall monetary and credit conditions. The FOMC also directs operations undertaken by the Federal Reserve in foreign exchange markets. The FOMC must reach consensus on all decisions. The president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York is a permanent member of the FOMC; the presidents of the other banks rotate membership at two- and three-year intervals. All Regional Reserve Bank presidents contribute to the committee&#x27;s assessment of the economy and of policy options, but only the five presidents who are then members of the FOMC vote on policy decisions. The FOMC determines its own internal organization and, by tradition, elects the chair of the board of governors as its chair and the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York as its vice chair. Formal meetings typically are held eight times each year in Washington, D.C. Nonvoting Reserve Bank presidents also participate in Committee deliberations and discussion. The FOMC generally meets eight times a year in telephone consultations and other meetings are held when needed.

There is very strong consensus among economists against politicising the FOMC.

=== Federal Advisory Council ===
The Federal Advisory Council, composed of twelve representatives of the banking industry, advises the board on all matters within its jurisdiction.

=== Federal Reserve Banks ===


There are 12 Federal Reserve Banks, each of which is responsible for member banks located in its district. They are located in Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, Minneapolis, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco. The size of each district was set based upon the population distribution of the United States when the Federal Reserve Act was passed.

The charter and organization of each bank is established by law and cannot be altered by the member banks. Member banks do, however, elect six of the nine members of the Federal Reserve Banks&#x27; boards of directors.

Each regional bank has a president, who is the chief executive officer of their bank. Each president is nominated by their bank&#x27;s board of directors, but the nomination is contingent upon approval by the board of governors. Presidents serve five-year terms and may be reappointed.

Each regional bank&#x27;s board has nine members. Members are of three classes: A, B, and C. There are three board members in each class. Class A members are chosen by the regional Bank&#x27;s shareholders, and are intended to represent member banks&#x27; interests. Member banks are divided into three categories: large, medium, and small. Each category elects one of the three class A board members. Class B board members are also nominated by the region&#x27;s member banks, but class B board members are supposed to represent the interests of the public. Lastly, class C board members are appointed by the board of governors, and are also intended to represent the interests of the public.

==== Legal status of regional Federal Reserve Banks ====
The Federal Reserve Banks have an intermediate legal status, with some features of private corporations and some features of public federal agencies. The United States has an interest in the Federal Reserve Banks as tax-exempt federally created instrumentalities whose profits belong to the federal government, but this interest is not proprietary. In &quot;Lewis v. United States&quot;, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit stated that: &quot;The Reserve Banks are not federal instrumentalities for purposes of the FTCA [the Federal Tort Claims Act], but are independent, privately owned and locally controlled corporations.&quot; The opinion went on to say, however, that: &quot;The Reserve Banks have properly been held to be federal instrumentalities for some purposes.&quot; Another relevant decision is &quot;Scott v. Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City&quot;, in which the distinction is made between Federal Reserve Banks, which are federally created instrumentalities, and the board of governors, which is a federal agency.

Regarding the structural relationship between the twelve Federal Reserve banks and the various commercial (member) banks, political science professor Michael D. Reagan has written:


=== Member banks ===

A member bank is a private institution and owns stock in its regional Federal Reserve Bank. All nationally chartered banks hold stock in one of the Federal Reserve Banks. State chartered banks may choose to be members (and hold stock in their regional Federal Reserve bank) upon meeting certain standards.

The amount of stock a member bank must own is equal to 3% of its combined capital and surplus. However, holding stock in a Federal Reserve bank is not like owning stock in a publicly traded company. These stocks cannot be sold or traded, and member banks do not control the Federal Reserve Bank as a result of owning this stock. From their Regional Bank, member banks with $10 billion or less in assets receive a dividend of 6%, while member banks with more than $10 billion in assets receive the lesser of 6% or the current 10-year Treasury auction rate. The remainder of the regional Federal Reserve Banks&#x27; profits is given over to the United States Treasury Department. In 2015, the Federal Reserve Banks made a profit of $100.2 billion and distributed $2.5 billion in dividends to member banks as well as returning $97.7 billion to the U.S. Treasury.

About 38% of U.S. banks are members of their regional Federal Reserve Bank.

=== Accountability ===
An external auditor selected by the audit committee of the Federal Reserve System regularly audits the Board of Governors and the Federal Reserve Banks. The GAO will audit some activities of the Board of Governors. These audits do not cover &quot;most of the Fed&#x27;s monetary policy actions or decisions, including discount window lending (direct loans to financial institutions), open-market operations and any other transactions made under the direction of the Federal Open Market Committee&quot; ...[nor may the GAO audit] &quot;dealings with foreign governments and other central banks.&quot;

The annual and quarterly financial statements prepared by the Federal Reserve System conform to a basis of accounting that is set by the Federal Reserve Board and does not conform to Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) or government Cost Accounting Standards (CAS). The financial reporting standards are defined in the Financial Accounting Manual for the Federal Reserve Banks. The cost accounting standards are defined in the Planning and Control System Manual. , the Federal Reserve Board has been publishing unaudited financial reports for the Federal Reserve banks every quarter.

On November 7, 2008, Bloomberg L.P. brought a lawsuit against the board of governors of the Federal Reserve System to force the board to reveal the identities of firms for which it provided guarantees during the financial crisis of 2007–2008. Bloomberg, L.P. won at the trial court and the Fed&#x27;s appeals were rejected at both the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit and the U.S. Supreme Court. The data was released on March 31, 2011.

== Monetary policy ==
The term &quot;monetary policy&quot; refers to the actions undertaken by a central bank, such as the Federal Reserve, to influence economic activity (the overall demand for goods and services) to help promote national economic goals. The Federal Reserve Act of 1913 gave the Federal Reserve authority to set monetary policy in the United States. The Fed&#x27;s mandate for monetary policy is commonly known as the dual mandate of promoting maximum employment and stable prices, the latter being interpreted as a stable inflation rate of 2 percent per year on average. The Fed&#x27;s monetary policy influences economic activity by influencing the general level of interest rates in the economy, which again via the monetary transmission mechanism affects households&#x27; and firms&#x27; demand for goods and services and in turn employment and inflation.

=== Interbank lending ===
The Federal Reserve sets monetary policy by influencing the federal funds rate, which is the rate of interbank lending of reserve balances. The rate that banks charge each other for these loans is determined in the interbank market, and the Federal Reserve influences this rate through the &quot;tools&quot; of monetary policy described in the &quot;Tools&quot; section below. The federal funds rate is a short-term interest rate that the FOMC focuses on, which affects the longer-term interest rates throughout the economy. The Federal Reserve explained the implementation of its monetary policy in 2021:

Changes in the target for the federal funds rate affect overall financial conditions through various channels, including subsequent changes in the market interest rates that commercial banks and other lenders charge on short-term and longer-term loans, and changes in asset prices and in currency exchange rates, which again affects private consumption, investment and net export. By easening or tightening the stance of monetary policy, i.e. lowering or raising its target for the federal funds rate, the Fed can either spur or restrain growth in the overall US demand for goods and services.

=== Tools ===
There are four main tools of monetary policy that the Federal Reserve uses to implement its monetary policy:

==== Federal funds rate ====

The Federal Reserve System implements monetary policy largely by targeting the federal funds rate. This is the interest rate that banks charge each other for overnight loans of federal funds, which are the reserves held by banks at the Fed. This rate is actually determined by the market and is not explicitly mandated by the Fed. The Fed therefore tries to align the effective federal funds rate with the targeted rate, mainly by adjusting its IORB rate. The Federal Reserve System usually adjusts the federal funds rate target by 0.25% or 0.50% at a time.

==== Interest on reserve balances ====

The interest on reserve balances (IORB) is the interest that the Fed pays on funds held by commercial banks in their reserve balance accounts at the individual Federal Reserve System banks. It is an administrated interest rate (i.e. set directly by the Fed as opposed to a market interest rate which is determined by the forces of supply and demand). As banks are unlikely to lend their reserves in the FFR market for less than they get paid by the Fed, the IORB guides the effective FFR and is used as the primary tool of the Fed&#x27;s monetary policy.

==== Open market operations ====
Open market operations are done through the sale and purchase of United States Treasury securities, or &quot;Treasurys&quot;. The Federal Reserve buys Treasurys both directly and via primary dealers, which have accounts at depository institutions.

The Federal Reserve&#x27;s objective for open market operations has varied over the years. During the 1980s, the focus gradually shifted toward attaining a specified level of the federal funds rate (the rate that banks charge each other for overnight loans of federal funds, which are the reserves held by banks at the Fed), a process that was largely complete by the end of the decade.

Until the 2007–2008 financial crisis, the Fed used open market operations as its primary tool to adjust the supply of reserve balances in order to keep the federal funds rate around the Fed&#x27;s target. This regime is also known as a limited reserves regime. After the financial crisis, the Federal Reserve has adopted a so-called ample reserves regime where open market operations leading to modest changes in the supply of reserves are no longer effective in influencing the FFR. Instead the Fed uses its administered rates, in particular the IORB rate, to influence the FFR. However, open market operations are still an important maintenance tool in the overall framework of the conduct of monetary policy as they are used for ensuring that reserves remain ample.

===== Repurchase agreements =====
To smooth temporary or cyclical changes in the money supply, the desk engages in repurchase agreements (repos) with its primary dealers. Repos are essentially secured, short-term lending by the Fed. On the day of the transaction, the Fed deposits money in a primary dealer&#x27;s reserve account, and receives the promised securities as collateral. When the transaction matures, the process unwinds: the Fed returns the collateral and charges the primary dealer&#x27;s reserve account for the principal and accrued interest. The term of the repo (the time between settlement and maturity) can vary from 1 day (called an overnight repo) to 65 days.

==== Discount window and discount rate ====
The Federal Reserve System also directly sets the discount rate, which is the interest rate for &quot;discount window lending&quot;, overnight loans that member banks borrow directly from the Fed. This rate is generally set at a rate close to 100 basis points above the target federal funds rate. The idea is to encourage banks to seek alternative funding before using the &quot;discount rate&quot; option. The equivalent operation by the European Central Bank is referred to as the &quot;marginal lending facility&quot;.

Both the discount rate and the federal funds rate influence the prime rate, which is usually about 3 percentage points higher than the federal funds rate.

==== Term Deposit facility ====

The Term Deposit facility is a program through which the Federal Reserve Banks offer interest-bearing term deposits to eligible institutions. It is intended to facilitate the implementation of monetary policy by providing a tool by which the Federal Reserve can manage the aggregate quantity of reserve balances held by depository institutions. Funds placed in term deposits are removed from the accounts of participating institutions for the life of the term deposit and thus drain reserve balances from the banking system. The program was announced December 9, 2009, and approved April 30, 2010, with an effective date of June 4, 2010. Fed Chair Ben S. Bernanke, testifying before the House Committee on Financial Services, stated that the Term Deposit Facility would be used to reverse the expansion of credit during the Great Recession, by drawing funds out of the money markets into the Federal Reserve Banks. It would therefore result in increased market interest rates, acting as a brake on economic activity and inflation. The Federal Reserve authorized up to five &quot;small-value offerings&quot; in 2010 as a pilot program. After three of the offering auctions were successfully completed, it was announced that small-value auctions would continue on an ongoing basis.

====Quantitative easing (QE) policy====
A little-used tool of the Federal Reserve is the quantitative easing policy. Under that policy, the Federal Reserve buys back corporate bonds and mortgage backed securities held by banks or other financial institutions. This in effect puts money back into the financial institutions and allows them to make loans and conduct normal business.
The bursting of the United States housing bubble prompted the Fed to buy mortgage-backed securities for the first time in November 2008. Over six weeks, a total of $1.25 trillion were purchased in order to stabilize the housing market, about one-fifth of all U.S. government-backed mortgages.

==== Expired policy tools ====

===== Reserve requirements =====
An instrument of monetary policy adjustment historically employed by the Federal Reserve System was the fractional reserve requirement, also known as the required reserve ratio. The required reserve ratio set the balance that the Federal Reserve System required a depository institution to hold in the Federal Reserve Banks. The required reserve ratio was set by the board of governors of the Federal Reserve System. The reserve requirements have changed over time and some history of these changes is published by the Federal Reserve.

As a response to the financial crisis of 2008, the Federal Reserve started making interest payments on depository institutions&#x27; required and excess reserve balances. The payment of interest on excess reserves gave the central bank greater opportunity to address credit market conditions while maintaining the federal funds rate close to the target rate set by the FOMC. The reserve requirement did not play a significant role in the post-2008 interest-on-excess-reserves regime, and in March 2020, the reserve ratio was set to zero for all banks, which meant that no bank was required to hold any reserves, and hence the reserve requirement effectively ceased to exist.

===== Temporary policy tools during the financial crisis =====

In order to address problems related to the subprime mortgage crisis and United States housing bubble, several new tools were created. The first new tool, called the Term auction facility, was added on December 12, 2007. It was announced as a temporary tool, but remained in place for a prolonged period of time. Creation of the second new tool, called the Term Securities Lending Facility, was announced on March 11, 2008. The main difference between these two facilities was that the Term auction Facility was used to inject cash into the banking system whereas the Term securities Lending Facility was used to inject treasury securities into the banking system. Creation of the third tool, called the Primary Dealer Credit Facility (PDCF), was announced on March 16, 2008. The PDCF was a fundamental change in Federal Reserve policy because it enabled the Fed to lend directly to primary dealers, which was previously against Fed policy. The differences between these three facilities was described by the Federal Reserve:

Some measures taken by the Federal Reserve to address the financial crisis had not been used since the Great Depression.

===== Term auction facility =====
The Term auction Facility was a program in which the Federal Reserve auctioned term funds to depository institutions. The creation of this facility was announced by the Federal Reserve on December 12, 2007, and was done in conjunction with the Bank of Canada, the Bank of England, the European Central Bank, and the Swiss National Bank to address elevated pressures in short-term funding markets. The reason it was created was that banks were not lending funds to one another and banks in need of funds were refusing to go to the discount window. Banks were not lending money to each other because there was a fear that the loans would not be paid back. Banks refused to go to the discount window because it was usually associated with the stigma of bank failure. Under the Term auction Facility, the identity of the banks in need of funds was protected in order to avoid the stigma of bank failure. Foreign exchange swap lines with the European Central Bank and Swiss National Bank were opened so the banks in Europe could have access to U.S. dollars. The final Term Auction Facility auction was carried out on March 8, 2010.

===== Term securities lending facility =====
The Term securities Lending Facility was a 28-day facility that offered Treasury general collateral to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York&#x27;s primary dealers in exchange for other program-eligible collateral. It was intended to promote liquidity in the financing markets for Treasury and other collateral and thus to foster the functioning of financial markets more generally. Like the Term auction Facility, the TSLF was done in conjunction with the Bank of Canada, the Bank of England, the European Central Bank, and the Swiss National Bank. The resource allowed dealers to switch debt that was less liquid for U.S. government securities that were easily tradable. The currency swap lines with the European Central Bank and Swiss National Bank were increased. The TSLF was closed on February 1, 2010.

===== Primary dealer credit facility =====
The Primary Dealer Credit Facility (PDCF) was an overnight loan facility that provided funding to primary dealers in exchange for a specified range of eligible collateral and was intended to foster the functioning of financial markets more generally. It ceased extending credit on March 31, 2021.

===== Asset Backed Commercial Paper Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility =====
The Asset Backed Commercial Paper Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility (ABCPMMMFLF) was also called the AMLF. The Facility began operations on September 22, 2008, and was closed on February 1, 2010.

All U.S. depository institutions, bank holding companies (parent companies or U.S. broker-dealer affiliates), or U.S. branches and agencies of foreign banks were eligible to borrow under this facility pursuant to the discretion of the FRBB.

Collateral eligible for pledge under the Facility was required to meet the following criteria:
* was purchased by Borrower on or after September 19, 2008, from a registered investment company that held itself out as a money market mutual fund;
* was purchased by Borrower at the Fund&#x27;s acquisition cost as adjusted for amortization of premium or accretion of discount on the ABCP through the date of its purchase by Borrower;
* was rated at the time pledged to FRBB, not lower than A1, F1, or P1 by at least two major rating agencies or, if rated by only one major rating agency, the ABCP must have been rated within the top rating category by that agency;
* was issued by an entity organized under the laws of the United States or a political subdivision thereof under a program that was in existence on September 18, 2008; and
* had stated maturity that did not exceed 120 days if the Borrower was a bank or 270 days for non-bank Borrowers.

===== Commercial Paper Funding Facility =====
On October 7, 2008, the Federal Reserve further expanded the collateral it would loan against to include commercial paper using the Commercial Paper Funding Facility (CPFF). The action made the Fed a crucial source of credit for non-financial businesses in addition to commercial banks and investment firms. Fed officials said they would buy as much of the debt as necessary to get the market functioning again. They refused to say how much that might be, but they noted that around $1.3 trillion worth of commercial paper would qualify. There was $1.61 trillion in outstanding commercial paper, seasonally adjusted, on the market , according to the most recent data from the Fed. That was down from $1.70 trillion in the previous week. Since the summer of 2007, the market had shrunk from more than $2.2 trillion. This program lent out a total $738 billion before it was closed. Forty-five out of 81 of the companies participating in this program were foreign firms. Research shows that Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) recipients were twice as likely to participate in the program than other commercial paper issuers who did not take advantage of the TARP bailout. The Fed incurred no losses from the CPFF.

== History ==
=== Central banking in the United States, 1791–1913 ===
The first attempt at a national currency was during the American Revolutionary War. In 1775, the Continental Congress, as well as the states, began issuing paper currency, calling the bills &quot;Continentals&quot;. The Continentals were backed only by future tax revenue, and were used to help finance the Revolutionary War. Overprinting, as well as British counterfeiting, caused the value of the Continental to diminish quickly. This experience with paper money led the United States to strip the power to issue Bills of Credit (paper money) from a draft of the new Constitution on August 16, 1787, as well as banning such issuance by the various states, and limiting the states&#x27; ability to make anything but gold or silver coin legal tender on August 28.

In 1791, the government granted the First Bank of the United States a charter to operate as the U.S. central bank until 1811. The First Bank of the United States came to an end under President Madison when Congress refused to renew its charter. The Second Bank of the United States was established in 1816, and lost its authority to be the central bank of the U.S. twenty years later under President Jackson when its charter expired. Both banks were based upon the Bank of England. Ultimately, a third national bank, known as the Federal Reserve, was established in 1913 and still exists to this day.

==== First Central Bank, 1791 and Second Central Bank, 1816 ====
The first U.S. institution with central banking responsibilities was the First Bank of the United States, chartered by Congress and signed into law by President George Washington on February 25, 1791, at the urging of Alexander Hamilton. This was done despite strong opposition from Thomas Jefferson and James Madison, among numerous others. The charter was for twenty years and expired in 1811 under President Madison, when Congress refused to renew it.

In 1816, however, Madison revived it in the form of the Second Bank of the United States. Years later, early renewal of the bank&#x27;s charter became the primary issue in the reelection of President Andrew Jackson. After Jackson, who was opposed to the central bank, was reelected, he pulled the government&#x27;s funds out of the bank. Jackson was the only President to completely pay off the national debt but his efforts to close the bank contributed to the Panic of 1837. The bank&#x27;s charter was not renewed in 1836, and it would fully dissolve after several years as a private corporation.
From 1837 to 1862, in the Free Banking Era there was no formal central bank.
From 1846 to 1921, an Independent Treasury System ruled.
From 1863 to 1913, a system of national banks was instituted by the 1863 National Banking Act during which series of bank panics, in 1873, 1893, and 1907 occurred.

==== Creation of Third Central Bank, 1907–1913 ====
The main motivation for the third central banking system came from the Panic of 1907, which caused a renewed desire among legislators, economists, and bankers for an overhaul of the monetary system. During the last quarter of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century, the United States economy went through a series of financial panics. According to many economists, the previous national banking system had two main weaknesses: an inelastic currency and a lack of liquidity. In 1908, Congress enacted the Aldrich–Vreeland Act, which provided for an emergency currency and established the National Monetary Commission to study banking and currency reform. The National Monetary Commission returned with recommendations which were repeatedly rejected by Congress. A revision crafted during a secret meeting on Jekyll Island by Senator Aldrich and representatives of the nation&#x27;s top finance and industrial groups later became the basis of the Federal Reserve Act. The House voted on December 22, 1913, with 298 voting yes to 60 voting no. The Senate voted 43–25 on December 23, 1913. President Woodrow Wilson signed the bill later that day.

===== Federal Reserve Act, 1913 =====

The head of the bipartisan National Monetary Commission was financial expert and Senate Republican leader Nelson Aldrich. Aldrich set up two commissions – one to study the American monetary system in depth and the other, headed by Aldrich himself, to study the European central banking systems and report on them.

In early November 1910, Aldrich met with five well known members of the New York banking community to devise a central banking bill. Paul Warburg, an attendee of the meeting and longtime advocate of central banking in the U.S., later wrote that Aldrich was &quot;bewildered at all that he had absorbed abroad and he was faced with the difficult task of writing a highly technical bill while being harassed by the daily grind of his parliamentary duties&quot;. After ten days of deliberation, the bill, which would later be referred to as the &quot;Aldrich Plan&quot;, was agreed upon. It had several key components, including a central bank with a Washington-based headquarters and fifteen branches located throughout the U.S. in geographically strategic locations, and a uniform elastic currency based on gold and commercial paper. Aldrich believed a central banking system with no political involvement was best, but was convinced by Warburg that a plan with no public control was not politically feasible. The compromise involved representation of the public sector on the board of directors.

Aldrich&#x27;s bill met much opposition from politicians. Critics charged Aldrich of being biased due to his close ties to wealthy bankers such as J. P. Morgan and John D. Rockefeller Jr., Aldrich&#x27;s son-in-law. Most Republicans favored the Aldrich Plan, but it lacked enough support in Congress to pass because rural and western states viewed it as favoring the &quot;eastern establishment&quot;. In contrast, progressive Democrats favored a reserve system owned and operated by the government; they believed that public ownership of the central bank would end Wall Street&#x27;s control of the American currency supply. Conservative Democrats fought for a privately owned, yet decentralized, reserve system, which would still be free of Wall Street&#x27;s control.

The original Aldrich Plan was dealt a fatal blow in 1912, when Democrats won the White House and Congress. Nonetheless, President Woodrow Wilson believed that the Aldrich plan would suffice with a few modifications. The plan became the basis for the Federal Reserve Act, which was proposed by Senator Robert Owen in May 1913. The primary difference between the two bills was the transfer of control of the board of directors (called the Federal Open Market Committee in the Federal Reserve Act) to the government. The bill passed Congress on December 23, 1913, on a mostly partisan basis, with most Democrats voting &quot;yea&quot; and most Republicans voting &quot;nay&quot;.

=== Federal Reserve era, 1913–present ===
Key laws affecting the Federal Reserve have been:

* Federal Reserve Act, 1913
* Glass–Steagall Act, 1933
* Banking Act of 1935
* Employment Act of 1946
* Federal Reserve-Treasury Department Accord of 1951

* Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (2010)
== Measurement of economic variables ==
The Federal Reserve records and publishes large amounts of data. A few websites where data is published are at the board of governors&#x27; Economic Data and Research page, the board of governors&#x27; statistical releases and historical data page, and at the St. Louis Fed&#x27;s FRED (Federal Reserve Economic Data) page. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) examines many economic indicators prior to determining monetary policy.

Some criticism involves economic data compiled by the Fed. The Fed sponsors much of the monetary economics research in the U.S., and Lawrence H. White objects that this makes it less likely for researchers to publish findings challenging the status quo.

=== Net worth of households and nonprofit organizations ===
The net worth of households and nonprofit organizations in the United States is published by the Federal Reserve in a report titled &quot;Flow of Funds&quot;. At the end of the third quarter of fiscal year 2012, this value was $64.8 trillion. At the end of the first quarter of fiscal year 2014, this value was $95.5 trillion.

=== Money supply ===
The most common measures are named M0 (narrowest), M1, M2, and M3. In the United States they are defined by the Federal Reserve as follows:

The Federal Reserve stopped publishing M3 statistics in March 2006, saying that the data cost a lot to collect but did not provide significantly useful information. The other three money supply measures continue to be provided in detail.
=== Personal consumption expenditures price index ===
The Personal consumption expenditures price index, also referred to as simply the PCE price index, is used as one measure of the value of money. It is a United States-wide indicator of the average increase in prices for all domestic personal consumption. Using a variety of data including United States Consumer Price Index and U.S. Producer Price Index prices, it is derived from the largest component of the gross domestic product in the BEA&#x27;s National Income and Product Accounts, personal consumption expenditures.

One of the Fed&#x27;s main roles is to maintain price stability, which means that the Fed&#x27;s ability to keep a low inflation rate is a long-term measure of their success. Although the Fed is not required to maintain inflation within a specific range, their long run target for the growth of the PCE price index is between 1.5 and 2 percent. There has been debate among policy makers as to whether the Federal Reserve should have a specific inflation targeting policy.

==== Inflation and the economy ====
Most mainstream economists favor a low, steady rate of inflation. Chief economist, and advisor to the Federal Reserve, the Congressional Budget Office and the Council of Economic Advisers, Diane C. Swonk observed, in 2022, that &quot;From the Fed&#x27;s perspective, you have to remember inflation is kind of like cancer. If you don&#x27;t deal with it now with something that may be painful, you could have something that metastasized and becomes much more chronic later on.&quot;

Low (as opposed to zero or negative) inflation may reduce the severity of economic recessions by enabling the labor market to adjust more quickly in a downturn, and reduce the risk that a liquidity trap prevents monetary policy from stabilizing the economy. The task of keeping the rate of inflation low and stable is usually given to monetary authorities.

=== Unemployment rate ===

One of the stated goals of monetary policy is maximum employment. The unemployment rate statistics are collected by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and like the PCE price index are used as a barometer of the nation&#x27;s economic health.

== Budget ==
The Federal Reserve is self-funded. Over 90percent of Fed revenues come from open market operations, specifically the interest on the portfolio of Treasury securities as well as &quot;capital gains/losses&quot; that may arise from the buying/selling of the securities and their derivatives as part of Open Market Operations. The balance of revenues come from sales of financial services (check and electronic payment processing) and discount window loans. The board of governors (Federal Reserve Board) creates a budget report once per year for Congress. There are two reports with budget information. The one that lists the complete balance statements with income and expenses, as well as the net profit or loss, is the large report simply titled, &quot;Annual Report&quot;. It also includes data about employment throughout the system. The other report, which explains in more detail the expenses of the different aspects of the whole system, is called &quot;Annual Report: Budget Review&quot;. These detailed comprehensive reports can be found at the board of governors&#x27; website under the section &quot;Reports to Congress&quot;

===Remittance payments to the Treasury===

The Federal Reserve has been remitting interest that it has been receiving back to the United States Treasury. Most of the assets the Fed holds are U.S. Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities that it has been purchasing as part of quantitative easing since the 2007–2008 financial crisis. In 2022 the Fed started quantitative tightening (QT) and selling these assets and taking a loss on them in the secondary bond market. As a result, the nearly $100billion that it was remitting annually to the Treasury, is expected to be discontinued during QT.

In 2023, the Federal Reserve reported a net negative income of $114.3 billion. This triggered the creation of a deferred asset liability on the Federal Reserve balance sheet booked as &quot;Interest on Federal Reserve notes due to U.S. Treasury&quot; totaling $133.3 billion. The deferred asset is the amount of net excess revenues the Federal Reserve must realize before remittances can continue. It does not have any impact on the ability of the Federal Reserve to conduct monetary policy or meet its obligations. The Federal Reserve has estimated the deferred asset will last until mid-2027.

== Balance sheet ==


One of the keys to understanding the Federal Reserve is the Federal Reserve balance sheet (or balance statement). In accordance with Section 11 of the Federal Reserve Act, the board of governors of the Federal Reserve System publishes once each week the &quot;Consolidated Statement of Condition of All Federal Reserve Banks&quot; showing the condition of each Federal Reserve bank and a consolidated statement for all Federal Reserve banks. The board of governors requires that excess earnings of the Reserve Banks be transferred to the Treasury as interest on Federal Reserve notes.

The Federal Reserve releases its balance sheet every Thursday. Below is the balance sheet (in billions of dollars):


In addition, the balance sheet also indicates which assets are held as collateral against Federal Reserve Notes.
As of August 2024, the Fed&#x27;s total assets on balance sheet are $7.139 trillion.

== Criticism ==

The Federal Reserve System has faced various criticisms since its inception in 1913. Criticisms include lack of transparency and claims that it is ineffective.

<doc id="10821" wikidata="Q671" url="?curid=10821" title="Francium">
<text>Francium is a chemical element; it has symbol Fr and atomic number 87. It is extremely radioactive; its most stable isotope, francium-223 (originally called &quot;actinium K&quot; after the natural decay chain in which it appears), has a half-life of only 22 minutes. It is the second-most electropositive element, behind only caesium, and is the second rarest naturally occurring element (after astatine). Francium&#x27;s isotopes decay quickly into astatine, radium, and radon. The electronic structure of a francium atom is [Rn] 7s1; thus, the element is classed as an alkali metal.

As a consequence of its extreme instability, bulk francium has never been seen. Because of the general appearance of the other elements in its periodic table column, it is presumed that francium would appear as a highly reactive metal if enough could be collected together to be viewed as a bulk solid or liquid. Obtaining such a sample is highly improbable since the extreme heat of decay resulting from its short half-life would immediately vaporize any viewable quantity of the element.

Francium was discovered by Marguerite Perey in France (from which the element takes its name) on January 7, 1939. Before its discovery, francium was referred to as &quot;eka-caesium&quot; or &quot;ekacaesium&quot; because of its conjectured existence below caesium in the periodic table. It was the last element first discovered in nature, rather than by synthesis. Outside the laboratory, francium is extremely rare, with trace amounts found in uranium ores, where the isotope francium-223 (in the family of uranium-235) continually forms and decays. As little as exists at any given time throughout the Earth&#x27;s crust; aside from francium-223 and francium-221, its other isotopes are entirely synthetic. The largest amount produced in the laboratory was a cluster of more than 300,000 atoms.

==Characteristics==
Francium is one of the most unstable of the naturally occurring elements: its longest-lived isotope, francium-223, has a half-life of only 22 minutes. The only comparable element is astatine, whose most stable natural isotope, astatine-219 (the alpha daughter of francium-223), has a half-life of 56 seconds, although synthetic astatine-210 is much longer-lived with a half-life of 8.1 hours. All isotopes of francium decay into astatine, radium, or radon. Francium-223 also has a shorter half-life than the longest-lived isotope of each synthetic element up to and including element 105, dubnium.

Francium is an alkali metal whose chemical properties mostly resemble those of caesium. A heavy element with a single valence electron, it has the highest equivalent weight of any element. Liquid francium—if created—should have a surface tension of 0.05092 N/m at its melting point. Francium&#x27;s melting point was estimated to be around ; a value of is also often encountered. The melting point is uncertain because of the element&#x27;s extreme rarity and radioactivity; a different extrapolation based on Dmitri Mendeleev&#x27;s method gave . A calculation based on the melting temperatures of binary ionic crystals gives . The estimated boiling point of is also uncertain; the estimates and , as well as the extrapolation from Mendeleev&#x27;s method of , have also been suggested. The density of francium is expected to be around 2.48 g/cm3 (Mendeleev&#x27;s method extrapolates 2.4 g/cm3).

Linus Pauling estimated the electronegativity of francium at 0.7 on the Pauling scale, the same as caesium; the value for caesium has since been refined to 0.79, but there are no experimental data to allow a refinement of the value for francium. Francium has a slightly higher ionization energy than caesium, 392.811(4) kJ/mol as opposed to 375.7041(2) kJ/mol for caesium, as would be expected from relativistic effects, and this would imply that caesium is the less electronegative of the two. Francium should also have a higher electron affinity than caesium and the Fr− ion should be more polarizable than the Cs− ion.

==Compounds==
As a result of francium&#x27;s instability, its salts are only known to a small extent. Francium coprecipitates with several caesium salts, such as caesium perchlorate, which results in small amounts of francium perchlorate. This coprecipitation can be used to isolate francium, by adapting the radiocaesium coprecipitation method of Lawrence E. Glendenin and C. M. Nelson. It will additionally coprecipitate with many other caesium salts, including the iodate, the picrate, the tartrate (also rubidium tartrate), the chloroplatinate, and the silicotungstate. It also coprecipitates with silicotungstic acid, and with perchloric acid, without another alkali metal as a carrier, which leads to other methods of separation.

===Francium perchlorate===
Francium perchlorate is produced by the reaction of francium chloride and sodium perchlorate. The francium perchlorate coprecipitates with caesium perchlorate. This coprecipitation can be used to isolate francium, by adapting the radiocaesium coprecipitation method of Lawrence E. Glendenin and C. M. Nelson. However, this method is unreliable in separating thallium, which also coprecipitates with caesium. Francium perchlorate&#x27;s entropy is expected to be 42.7 e.u (178.7 J mol−1 K−1).

===Francium halides===
Francium halides are all soluble in water and are expected to be white solids. They are expected to be produced by the reaction of the corresponding halogens. For example, francium chloride would be produced by the reaction of francium and chlorine. Francium chloride has been studied as a pathway to separate francium from other elements, by using the high vapour pressure of the compound, although francium fluoride would have a higher vapour pressure.

===Other compounds===
Francium nitrate, sulfate, hydroxide, carbonate, acetate, and oxalate, are all soluble in water, while the iodate, picrate, tartrate, chloroplatinate, and silicotungstate are insoluble. The insolubility of these compounds are used to extract francium from other radioactive products, such as zirconium, niobium, molybdenum, tin, antimony, the method mentioned in the section above. Francium oxide is believed to disproportionate to the peroxide and francium metal. The CsFr molecule is predicted to have francium at the negative end of the dipole, unlike all known heterodiatomic alkali metal molecules. Francium superoxide (FrO2) is expected to have a more covalent character than its lighter congeners; this is attributed to the 6p electrons in francium being more involved in the francium–oxygen bonding. The relativistic destabilisation of the 6p3/2 spinor may make francium compounds in oxidation states higher than +1 possible, such as [FrVF6]−; but this has not been experimentally confirmed.

==Isotopes==
There are 37 known isotopes of francium ranging in atomic mass from 197 to 233. Francium has seven metastable nuclear isomers. Francium-223 and francium-221 are the only isotopes that occur in nature, with the former being far more common.

Francium-223 is the most stable isotope, with a half-life of 21.8 minutes, and it is highly unlikely that an isotope of francium with a longer half-life will ever be discovered or synthesized. Francium-223 is a fifth product of the uranium-235 decay series as a daughter isotope of actinium-227; thorium-227 is the more common daughter. Francium-223 then decays into radium-223 by beta decay (1.149 MeV decay energy), with a minor (0.006%) alpha decay path to astatine-219 (5.4 MeV decay energy).

Francium-221 has a half-life of 4.8 minutes. It is the ninth product of the neptunium decay series as a daughter isotope of actinium-225. Francium-221 then decays into astatine-217 by alpha decay (6.457 MeV decay energy). Although all primordial 237Np is extinct, the neptunium decay series continues to exist naturally in tiny traces due to (n,2n) knockout reactions in natural 238U. Francium-222, with a half-life of 14 minutes, may be produced as a result of the beta decay of natural radon-222; this process has nonetheless not yet been observed, and it is unknown whether this process is energetically possible.

The least stable ground state isotope is francium-215, with a half-life of 90 ns: it undergoes a 9.54 MeV alpha decay to astatine-211.

==Applications==
Due to its instability and rarity, there are no commercial applications for francium. It has been used for research purposes in the fields of chemistry
and of atomic structure. Its use as a potential diagnostic aid for various cancers has also been explored, but this application has been deemed impractical.

Francium&#x27;s ability to be synthesized, trapped, and cooled, along with its relatively simple atomic structure, has made it the subject of specialized spectroscopy experiments. These experiments have led to more specific information regarding energy levels and the coupling constants between subatomic particles. Studies on the light emitted by laser-trapped francium-210 ions have provided accurate data on transitions between atomic energy levels which are fairly similar to those predicted by quantum theory. Francium is a prospective candidate for searching for CP violation.

==History==
As early as 1870, chemists thought that there should be an alkali metal beyond caesium, with an atomic number of 87. It was then referred to by the provisional name &quot;eka-caesium&quot;.

===Erroneous and incomplete discoveries===
In 1914, Stefan Meyer, Viktor F. Hess, and Friedrich Paneth (working in Vienna) made measurements of alpha radiation from various substances, including 227Ac. They observed the possibility of a minor alpha branch of this nuclide, though follow-up work could not be done due to the outbreak of World War I. Their observations were not precise and sure enough for them to announce the discovery of element 87, though it is likely that they did indeed observe the decay of 227Ac to 223Fr.

Soviet chemist Dmitry Dobroserdov was the first scientist to claim to have found eka-caesium, or francium. In 1925, he observed weak radioactivity in a sample of potassium, another alkali metal, and incorrectly concluded that eka-caesium was contaminating the sample (the radioactivity from the sample was from the naturally occurring potassium radioisotope, potassium-40). He then published a thesis on his predictions of the properties of eka-caesium, in which he named the element &quot;russium&quot; after his home country. Shortly thereafter, Dobroserdov began to focus on his teaching career at the Polytechnic Institute of Odesa, and he did not pursue the element further.

The following year, English chemists Gerald J. F. Druce and Frederick H. Loring analyzed X-ray photographs of manganese(II) sulfate. They observed spectral lines which they presumed to be of eka-caesium. They announced their discovery of element 87 and proposed the name &quot;alkalinium&quot;, as it would be the heaviest alkali metal.

In 1930, Fred Allison of the Alabama Polytechnic Institute claimed to have discovered element 87 (in addition to 85) when analyzing pollucite and lepidolite using his magneto-optical machine. Allison requested that it be named &quot;virginium&quot; after his home state of Virginia, along with the symbols Vi and Vm. In 1934, H.G. MacPherson of UC Berkeley disproved the effectiveness of Allison&#x27;s device and the validity of his discovery.

In 1936, Romanian physicist Horia Hulubei and his French colleague Yvette Cauchois also analyzed pollucite, this time using their high-resolution X-ray apparatus. They observed several weak emission lines, which they presumed to be those of element 87. Hulubei and Cauchois reported their discovery and proposed the name &quot;moldavium&quot;, along with the symbol Ml, after Moldavia, the Romanian province where Hulubei was born. In 1937, Hulubei&#x27;s work was criticized by American physicist F. H. Hirsh Jr., who rejected Hulubei&#x27;s research methods. Hirsh was certain that eka-caesium would not be found in nature, and that Hulubei had instead observed mercury or bismuth X-ray lines. Hulubei insisted that his X-ray apparatus and methods were too accurate to make such a mistake. Because of this, Jean Baptiste Perrin, Nobel Prize winner and Hulubei&#x27;s mentor, endorsed moldavium as the true eka-caesium over Marguerite Perey&#x27;s recently discovered francium. Perey took pains to be accurate and detailed in her criticism of Hulubei&#x27;s work, and finally she was credited as the sole discoverer of element 87. All other previous purported discoveries of element 87 were ruled out due to francium&#x27;s very limited half-life.

===Perey&#x27;s analysis===
Eka-caesium was discovered on January 7, 1939, by Marguerite Perey of the Curie Institute in Paris, when she purified a sample of actinium-227 which had been reported to have a decay energy of 220 keV. Perey noticed decay particles with an energy level below 80 keV. Perey thought this decay activity might have been caused by a previously unidentified decay product, one which was separated during purification, but emerged again out of the pure actinium-227. Various tests eliminated the possibility of the unknown element being thorium, radium, lead, bismuth, or thallium. The new product exhibited chemical properties of an alkali metal (such as coprecipitating with caesium salts), which led Perey to believe that it was element 87, produced by the alpha decay of actinium-227. Perey then attempted to determine the proportion of beta decay to alpha decay in actinium-227. Her first test put the alpha branching at 0.6%, a figure which she later revised to 1%.

Perey named the new isotope &quot;actinium-K&quot; (it is now referred to as francium-223) and in 1946, she proposed the name &quot;catium&quot; (Cm) for her newly discovered element, as she believed it to be the most electropositive cation of the elements. Irène Joliot-Curie, one of Perey&#x27;s supervisors, opposed the name due to its connotation of &quot;cat&quot; rather than &quot;cation&quot;; furthermore, the symbol coincided with that which had since been assigned to curium. Perey then suggested &quot;francium&quot;, after France. This name was officially adopted by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) in 1949, becoming the second element after gallium to be named after France. It was assigned the symbol Fa, but it was revised to the current Fr shortly thereafter. Francium was the last element discovered in nature, rather than synthesized, following hafnium and rhenium. Further research into francium&#x27;s structure was carried out by, among others, Sylvain Lieberman and his team at CERN in the 1970s and 1980s.

==Occurrence==

223Fr is the result of the alpha decay of 227Ac and can be found in trace amounts in uranium minerals. In a given sample of uranium, there is estimated to be only one francium atom for every 1 × 1018 uranium atoms. Only about of francium is present naturally in the earth&#x27;s crust.

==Production==

Francium can be synthesized by a fusion reaction when a gold-197 target is bombarded with a beam of oxygen-18 atoms from a linear accelerator in a process originally developed at the physics department of the State University of New York at Stony Brook in 1995. Depending on the energy of the oxygen beam, the reaction can yield francium isotopes with masses of 209, 210, and 211.

:197Au + 18O → 209Fr + 6 n
:197Au + 18O → 210Fr + 5 n
:197Au + 18O → 211Fr + 4 n

The francium atoms leave the gold target as ions, which are neutralized by collision with yttrium and then isolated in a magneto-optical trap (MOT) in a gaseous unconsolidated state. Although the atoms only remain in the trap for about 30 seconds before escaping or undergoing nuclear decay, the process supplies a continual stream of fresh atoms. The result is a steady state containing a fairly constant number of atoms for a much longer time. The original apparatus could trap up to a few thousand atoms, while a later improved design could trap over 300,000 at a time. Sensitive measurements of the light emitted and absorbed by the trapped atoms provided the first experimental results on various transitions between atomic energy levels in francium. Initial measurements show very good agreement between experimental values and calculations based on quantum theory. The research project using this production method relocated to TRIUMF in 2012, where over 106 francium atoms have been held at a time, including large amounts of 209Fr in addition to 207Fr and 221Fr.

Other synthesis methods include bombarding radium with neutrons, and bombarding thorium with protons, deuterons, or helium ions.

223Fr can also be isolated from samples of its parent 227Ac, the francium being milked via elution with NH4Cl–CrO3 from an actinium-containing cation exchanger and purified by passing the solution through a silicon dioxide compound loaded with barium sulfate.

In 1996, the Stony Brook group trapped 3000 atoms in their MOT, which was enough for a video camera to capture the light given off by the atoms as they fluoresce. Francium has not been synthesized in amounts large enough to weigh.

<text>Fermium is a synthetic chemical element; it has symbol Fm and atomic number 100. It is an actinide and the heaviest element that can be formed by neutron bombardment of lighter elements, and hence the last element that can be prepared in macroscopic quantities, although pure fermium metal has not been prepared yet. A total of 20 isotopes are known, with 257Fm being the longest-lived with a half-life of 100.5 days.

Fermium was discovered in the debris of the first hydrogen bomb explosion in 1952, and named after Enrico Fermi, one of the pioneers of nuclear physics. Its chemistry is typical for the late actinides, with a preponderance of the +3 oxidation state but also an accessible +2 oxidation state. Owing to the small amounts of produced fermium and all of its isotopes having relatively short half-lives, there are currently no uses for it outside basic scientific research.

==Discovery==

Fermium was first discovered in the fallout from the &#x27;Ivy Mike&#x27; nuclear test (1 November 1952), the first successful test of a hydrogen bomb. Initial examination of the debris from the explosion had shown the production of a new isotope of plutonium, : this could only have formed by the absorption of six neutrons by a uranium-238 nucleus followed by two β− decays. At the time, the absorption of neutrons by a heavy nucleus was thought to be a rare process, but the identification of raised the possibility that still more neutrons could have been absorbed by the uranium nuclei, leading to new elements.

Element 99 (einsteinium) was quickly discovered on filter papers which had been flown through clouds from the explosion (the same sampling technique that had been used to discover ). It was then identified in December 1952 by Albert Ghiorso and co-workers at the University of California at Berkeley. They discovered the isotope 253Es (half-life ) that was made by the capture of 15 neutrons by uranium-238 nuclei – which then underwent seven successive beta decays:

Some 238U atoms, however, could capture another amount of neutrons (most likely, 16 or 17).

The discovery of fermium () required more material, as the yield was expected to be at least an order of magnitude lower than that of element 99, and so contaminated coral from the Enewetak atoll (where the test had taken place) was shipped to the University of California Radiation Laboratory in Berkeley, California, for processing and analysis. About two months after the test, a new component was isolated emitting high-energy α-particles () with a half-life of about a day. With such a short half-life, it could only arise from the β− decay of an isotope of einsteinium, and so had to be an isotope of the new element 100: it was quickly identified as 255Fm ().

The discovery of the new elements, and the new data on neutron capture, was initially kept secret on the orders of the U.S. military until 1955 due to Cold War tensions. Nevertheless, the Berkeley team was able to prepare elements 99 and 100 by civilian means, through the neutron bombardment of plutonium-239, and published this work in 1954 with the disclaimer that it was not the first studies that had been carried out on the elements. The &quot;Ivy Mike&quot; studies were declassified and published in 1955.

The Berkeley team had been worried that another group might discover lighter isotopes of element 100 through ion-bombardment techniques before they could publish their classified research, and this proved to be the case. A group at the Nobel Institute for Physics in Stockholm independently discovered the element, producing an isotope later confirmed to be 250Fm () by bombarding a target with oxygen-16 ions, and published their work in May 1954. Nevertheless, the priority of the Berkeley team was generally recognized, and with it the prerogative to name the new element in honour of Enrico Fermi, the developer of the first artificial self-sustained nuclear reactor. Fermi was still alive when the name was proposed, but had died by the time it became official.

==Isotopes==

There are 20 isotopes of fermium listed in N 2016, with atomic weights of 241 to 260, of which Fm is the longest-lived with a half-life of 100.5 days. Fm has a half-life of 3 days, while Fm of 5.3 h, Fm of 25.4 h, Fm of 3.2 h, Fm of 20.1 h, and Fm of 2.6 hours. All the remaining ones have half-lives ranging from 30 minutes to less than a millisecond.
The neutron capture product of fermium-257, Fm, undergoes spontaneous fission with a half-life of just 370(14) microseconds; Fm and Fm also undergo spontaneous fission (&quot;t&quot;1/2 = 1.5(3) s and 4 ms respectively). This means that neutron capture cannot be used to create nuclides with a mass number greater than 257, unless carried out in a nuclear explosion. As Fm alpha decays to Cf, and no known fermium isotopes undergo beta minus decay to the next element, mendelevium, fermium is also the last element that can be synthesized by neutron-capture. Because of this impediment in forming heavier isotopes, these short-lived isotopes Fm constitute the &quot;fermium gap.&quot; 
==Occurrence==
===Production===

Fermium is produced by the bombardment of lighter actinides with neutrons in a nuclear reactor. Fermium-257 is the heaviest isotope that is obtained via neutron capture, and can only be produced in picogram quantities. The major source is the 85 MW High Flux Isotope Reactor (HFIR) at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee, USA, which is dedicated to the production of transcurium (&quot;Z&quot; &gt; 96) elements. Lower mass fermium isotopes are available in greater quantities, though these isotopes (254Fm and 255Fm) are comparatively short-lived. In a &quot;typical processing campaign&quot; at Oak Ridge, tens of grams of curium are irradiated to produce decigram quantities of californium, milligram quantities of berkelium and einsteinium, and picogram quantities of fermium. However, nanogram quantities of fermium can be prepared for specific experiments. The quantities of fermium produced in 20–200 kiloton thermonuclear explosions is believed to be of the order of milligrams, although it is mixed in with a huge quantity of debris; 4.0 picograms of 257Fm was recovered from 10 kilograms of debris from the &quot;Hutch&quot; test (16 July 1969). The Hutch experiment produced an estimated total of 250 micrograms of 257Fm.

After production, the fermium must be separated from other actinides and from lanthanide fission products. This is usually achieved by ion-exchange chromatography, with the standard process using a cation exchanger such as Dowex 50 or T eluted with a solution of ammonium α-hydroxyisobutyrate. Smaller cations form more stable complexes with the α-hydroxyisobutyrate anion, and so are preferentially eluted from the column. A rapid fractional crystallization method has also been described.

Although the most stable isotope of fermium is 257Fm, with a half-life of 100.5 days, most studies are conducted on 255Fm (&quot;t&quot;1/2 = 20.07(7) hours), since this isotope can be easily isolated as required as the decay product of 255Es (&quot;t&quot;1/2 = 39.8(12) days).

===Synthesis in nuclear explosions===
The analysis of the debris at the 10-megaton &quot;Ivy Mike&quot; nuclear test was a part of long-term project, one of the goals of which was studying the efficiency of production of transuranium elements in high-power nuclear explosions. The motivation for these experiments was as follows: synthesis of such elements from uranium requires multiple neutron capture. The probability of such events increases with the neutron flux, and nuclear explosions are the most powerful neutron sources, providing densities on the order 10 neutrons/cm within a microsecond, i.e. about 10 neutrons/(cm·s). For comparison, the flux of the HFIR reactor is 5 neutrons/(cm·s). A dedicated laboratory was set up right at Enewetak Atoll for preliminary analysis of debris, as some isotopes could have decayed by the time the debris samples reached the U.S. The laboratory was receiving samples for analysis, as soon as possible, from airplanes equipped with paper filters which flew over the atoll after the tests. Whereas it was hoped to discover new chemical elements heavier than fermium, those were not found after a series of megaton explosions conducted between 1954 and 1956 at the atoll.
The atmospheric results were supplemented by the underground test data accumulated in the 1960s at the Nevada Test Site, as it was hoped that powerful explosions conducted in confined space might result in improved yields and heavier isotopes. Apart from traditional uranium charges, combinations of uranium with americium and thorium have been tried, as well as a mixed plutonium-neptunium charge. They were less successful in terms of yield, which was attributed to stronger losses of heavy isotopes due to enhanced fission rates in heavy-element charges. Isolation of the products was found to be rather problematic, as the explosions were spreading debris through melting and vaporizing rocks under the great depth of 300–600 meters, and drilling to such depth in order to extract the products was both slow and inefficient in terms of collected volumes.

Among the nine underground tests, which were carried between 1962 and 1969 and codenamed Anacostia (5.2 kilotons, 1962), Kennebec (&lt;5 kilotons, 1963), Par (38 kilotons, 1964), Barbel (&lt;20 kilotons, 1964), Tweed (&lt;20 kilotons, 1965), Cyclamen (13 kilotons, 1966), Kankakee (20-200 kilotons, 1966), Vulcan (25 kilotons, 1966) and Hutch (20-200 kilotons, 1969), the last one was most powerful and had the highest yield of transuranium elements. In the dependence on the atomic mass number, the yield showed a saw-tooth behavior with the lower values for odd isotopes, due to their higher fission rates. The major practical problem of the entire proposal, however, was collecting the radioactive debris dispersed by the powerful blast. Aircraft filters adsorbed only about 4 of the total amount and collection of tons of corals at Enewetak Atoll increased this fraction by only two orders of magnitude. Extraction of about 500 kilograms of underground rocks 60 days after the Hutch explosion recovered only about 10 of the total charge. The amount of transuranium elements in this 500-kg batch was only 30 times higher than in a 0.4 kg rock picked up 7 days after the test. This observation demonstrated the highly nonlinear dependence of the transuranium elements yield on the amount of retrieved radioactive rock. In order to accelerate sample collection after the explosion, shafts were drilled at the site not after but before the test, so that the explosion would expel radioactive material from the epicenter, through the shafts, to collecting volumes near the surface. This method was tried in the Anacostia and Kennebec tests and instantly provided hundreds of kilograms of material, but with actinide concentrations 3 times lower than in samples obtained after drilling; whereas such a method could have been efficient in scientific studies of short-lived isotopes, it could not improve the overall collection efficiency of the produced actinides.

Though no new elements (apart from einsteinium and fermium) could be detected in the nuclear test debris, and the total yields of transuranium elements were disappointingly low, these tests did provide significantly higher amounts of rare heavy isotopes than previously available in laboratories. For example, 6 atoms of Fm could be recovered after the Hutch detonation. They were then used in the studies of thermal-neutron induced fission of Fm and in discovery of a new fermium isotope Fm. Also, the rare isotope Cm was synthesized in large quantities, which is very difficult to produce in nuclear reactors from its progenitor Cm; the half-life of Cm (64 minutes) is much too short for months-long reactor irradiations, but is very &quot;long&quot; on the explosion timescale.

===Natural occurrence===
Because of the short half-life of all known isotopes of fermium, any primordial fermium, that is fermium present on Earth during its formation, has decayed by now. Synthesis of fermium from naturally occurring uranium and thorium in the Earth&#x27;s crust requires multiple neutron captures, which is extremely unlikely. Therefore, most fermium is produced on Earth in laboratories, high-power nuclear reactors, or in nuclear tests, and is present for only a few months afterward. The transuranic elements americium to fermium did occur naturally in the natural nuclear fission reactor at Oklo, but no longer do so.

==Chemistry==
The chemistry of fermium has only been studied in solution using tracer techniques, and no solid compounds have been prepared. Under normal conditions, fermium exists in solution as the Fm3+ ion, which has a hydration number of 16.9 and an acid dissociation constant of 1.6 (p&quot;K&quot; = 3.8). Fm forms complexes with a wide variety of organic ligands with hard donor atoms such as oxygen, and these complexes are usually more stable than those of the preceding actinides. It also forms anionic complexes with ligands such as chloride or nitrate and, again, these complexes appear to be more stable than those formed by einsteinium or californium. It is believed that the bonding in the complexes of the later actinides is mostly ionic in character: the Fm ion is expected to be smaller than the preceding An ions because of the higher effective nuclear charge of fermium, and hence fermium would be expected to form shorter and stronger metal–ligand bonds.

Fermium(III) can be fairly easily reduced to fermium(II), for example with samarium(II) chloride, with which fermium(II) coprecipitates. In the precipitate, the compound fermium(II) chloride (FmCl) was produced, though it was not purified or studied in isolation. The electrode potential has been estimated to be similar to that of the ytterbium(III)/(II) couple, or about −1.15 V with respect to the standard hydrogen electrode, a value which agrees with theoretical calculations. The Fm/Fm couple has an electrode potential of −2.37(10) V based on polarographic measurements.

==Toxicity==
Though few people come in contact with fermium, the International Commission on Radiological Protection has set annual exposure limits for the two most stable isotopes. For fermium-253, the ingestion limit was set at 10 becquerels (1 Bq equals one decay per second), and the inhalation limit at 10 Bq; for fermium-257, at 10 Bq and 4,000 Bq respectively.

<doc id="10823" wikidata="Q1268" url="?curid=10823" title="Frédéric Chopin">
<text>Frédéric François Chopin (born Fryderyk Franciszek Chopin; 1 March 181017 October 1849) was a Polish composer and virtuoso pianist of the Romantic period, who wrote primarily for solo piano. He has maintained worldwide renown as a leading composer of his era, one whose &quot;poetic genius was based on a professional technique that was without equal in his generation&quot;.

Chopin was born in Żelazowa Wola and grew up in Warsaw, which in 1815 became part of Congress Poland. A child prodigy, he completed his musical education and composed his earlier works in Warsaw before leaving Poland at the age of 20, less than a month before the outbreak of the November 1830 Uprising. At 21, he settled in Paris. Thereafter he gave only 30 public performances, preferring the more intimate atmosphere of the salon. He supported himself by selling his compositions and by giving piano lessons, for which he was in high demand. Chopin formed a friendship with Franz Liszt and was admired by many of his musical contemporaries, including Robert Schumann. After a failed engagement to Maria Wodzińska from 1836 to 1837, he maintained an often troubled relationship with the French writer Aurore Dupin (known by her pen name George Sand). A brief and unhappy visit to Mallorca with Sand in 1838–39 would prove one of his most productive periods of composition. In his final years, he was supported financially by his admirer Jane Stirling. For most of his life, Chopin was in poor health. He died in Paris in 1849 at the age of 39.

All of Chopin&#x27;s compositions feature the piano. Most are for solo piano, though he also wrote two piano concertos, some chamber music, and 19 songs set to Polish lyrics. His piano pieces are technically demanding and expanded the limits of the instrument; his own performances were noted for their nuance and sensitivity. Chopin&#x27;s major piano works include mazurkas, waltzes, nocturnes, polonaises, the instrumental &quot;ballade&quot; (which Chopin created as an instrumental genre), études, impromptus, scherzi, preludes, and sonatas, some published only posthumously. Among the influences on his style of composition were Polish folk music, the classical tradition of Mozart and Schubert, and the atmosphere of the Paris salons, of which he was a frequent guest. His innovations in style, harmony, and musical form, and his association of music with nationalism, were influential throughout and after the late Romantic period.

Chopin&#x27;s music, his status as one of music&#x27;s earliest celebrities, his indirect association with political insurrection, his high-profile love life, and his early death have made him a leading symbol of the Romantic era. His works remain popular, and he has been the subject of numerous films and biographies of varying historical fidelity. Among his many memorials is the Fryderyk Chopin Institute, which was created by the Parliament of Poland to research and promote his life and works. It hosts the International Chopin Piano Competition, a prestigious competition devoted entirely to his works.

===Early life===

====Childhood====

Frédéric Chopin was born in Żelazowa Wola, 46 kilometres () west of Warsaw, in what was then the Duchy of Warsaw, a Polish state established by Napoleon. The parish baptismal record, which is dated 23 April 1810, gives his birthday as 22 February 1810, and cites his given names in the Latin form (in Polish, he was ). The composer and his family used the birthdate 1 March, which is now generally accepted as the correct date.

His father, Nicolas Chopin, was a Frenchman from Lorraine who had emigrated to Poland in 1787 at the age of sixteen. He married Justyna Krzyżanowska, a poor relative of the Skarbeks, one of the families for whom he worked. Chopin was baptised in the same church where his parents had married, in Brochów. His eighteen-year-old godfather, for whom he was named, was Fryderyk Skarbek, a pupil of Nicolas Chopin. Chopin was the second child of Nicolas and Justyna and their only son; he had an elder sister, Ludwika, and two younger sisters, Izabela and Emilia, whose death at the age of 14 was probably from tuberculosis. Nicolas Chopin was devoted to his adopted homeland, and insisted on the use of the Polish language in the household.
In October 1810, six months after Chopin&#x27;s birth, the family moved to Warsaw, where his father acquired a post teaching French at the Warsaw Lyceum, then housed in the Saxon Palace. Chopin lived with his family on the Palace grounds. His father played the flute and violin; his mother played the piano and gave lessons to boys in the boarding house that the Chopins kept. Chopin was of slight build, and even in early childhood was prone to illnesses.

Chopin may have had some piano instruction from his mother, but his first professional music tutor, from 1816 to 1821, was the Czech-born pianist Wojciech Żywny. His elder sister Ludwika also took lessons from Żywny, and occasionally played duets with her brother. It quickly became apparent that he was a child prodigy. By the age of seven he had begun giving public concerts, and in 1817 he composed two polonaises, in G minor and B-flat major. His next work, a polonaise in A-flat major of 1821, dedicated to Żywny, is his earliest surviving musical manuscript.

In 1817 the Saxon Palace was requisitioned by Warsaw&#x27;s Russian governor for military use, and the Warsaw Lyceum was reestablished in the Kazimierz Palace (today the rectorate of Warsaw University). Chopin and his family moved to a building, which still survives, adjacent to the Kazimierz Palace. During this period, he was sometimes invited to the Belweder Palace as playmate to the son of the ruler of Russian Poland, Grand Duke Konstantin Pavlovich of Russia; he played the piano for Konstantin Pavlovich and composed a march for him. Julian Ursyn Niemcewicz, in his dramatic eclogue, &quot;&quot; (&quot;Our Discourses&quot;, 1818), attested to &quot;little Chopin&#x27;s&quot; popularity.

====Education====

From September 1823 to 1826, Chopin attended the Warsaw Lyceum, where he received organ lessons from the Czech musician Wilhelm Würfel during his first year. In the autumn of 1826 he began a three-year course under the Silesian composer Józef Elsner at the Warsaw Conservatory, studying music theory, figured bass, and composition. Throughout this period he continued to compose and to give recitals in concerts and salons in Warsaw. He was engaged by the inventors of the &quot;aeolomelodicon&quot; (a combination of piano and mechanical organ), and on this instrument in May 1825 he performed his own improvisation and part of a concerto by Moscheles. The success of this concert led to an invitation to give a recital on a similar instrument (the &quot;aeolopantaleon&quot;) before Tsar Alexander I, who was visiting Warsaw; the Tsar presented him with a diamond ring. At a subsequent aeolopantaleon concert on 10 June 1825, Chopin performed his Rondo Op. 1. This was the first of his works to be commercially published and earned him his first mention in the foreign press, when the Leipzig praised his &quot;wealth of musical ideas&quot;.

From 1824 until 1828, Chopin spent his vacations away from Warsaw, at a number of locations. In 1824 and 1825, at Szafarnia, he was a guest of Dominik Dziewanowski, the father of a schoolmate. Here, for the first time, he encountered Polish rural folk music. His letters home from Szafarnia (to which he gave the title &quot;The Szafarnia Courier&quot;), written in a very modern and lively Polish, amused his family with their spoofing of the Warsaw newspapers and demonstrated the youngster&#x27;s literary gift.

In 1827, soon after the death of Chopin&#x27;s youngest sister Emilia, the family moved from the Warsaw University building, adjacent to the Kazimierz Palace, to lodgings just across the street from the university, in the south annex of the Krasiński Palace on Krakowskie Przedmieście, where Chopin lived until he left Warsaw in 1830. Here his parents continued running their boarding house for male students. Four boarders at his parents&#x27; apartments became Chopin&#x27;s intimates: Tytus Woyciechowski, Jan Nepomucen Białobłocki, Jan Matuszyński, and Julian Fontana. The latter two would become part of his Paris milieu.

Chopin was friendly with members of Warsaw&#x27;s young artistic and intellectual world, including Fontana, Józef Bohdan Zaleski, and Stefan Witwicki. Chopin&#x27;s final Conservatory report (July 1829) read: &quot;Chopin F., third-year student, exceptional talent, musical genius.&quot; In 1829 the artist Ambroży Mieroszewski executed a set of portraits of Chopin family members, including the first known portrait of the composer.

Letters from Chopin to Woyciechowski in the period 1829–30 (when Chopin was about twenty) contain apparent homoerotic references to dreams and to offered kisses.
According to Adam Zamoyski, such expressions &quot;were, and to some extent still are, common currency in Polish and carry no greater implication than the &#x27;love concluding letters today. &quot;The spirit of the times, pervaded by the Romantic movement in art and literature, favoured extreme expression of feeling ... Whilst the possibility cannot be ruled out entirely, it is unlikely that the two were ever lovers.&quot; Chopin&#x27;s biographer Alan Walker considers that, insofar as such expressions could be perceived as homosexual in nature, they would not denote more than a passing phase in Chopin&#x27;s life, or be the resultin Walker&#x27;s wordsof a &quot;mental twist&quot;. The musicologist Jeffrey Kallberg notes that concepts of sexual practice and identity were very different in Chopin&#x27;s time, so modern interpretation is problematic. Other scholars argue that these are clear, or potential, demonstrations of homosexual impulses on Chopin&#x27;s part.

Probably in early 1829, Chopin met the singer Konstancja Gładkowska and developed an intense affection for her, although it is not clear that he ever addressed her directly on the matter. In a letter to Woyciechowski of 3 October 1829 he refers to his &quot;ideal, whom I have served faithfully for six months, though without ever saying a word to her about my feelings; whom I dream of, who inspired the Adagio of my Concerto&quot;. All of Chopin&#x27;s biographers, following the lead of Frederick Niecks, agree that this &quot;ideal&quot; was Gładkowska. After what would be Chopin&#x27;s farewell concert in Warsaw in October 1830, which included the concerto, played by the composer, and Gładkowska singing an aria by Gioachino Rossini, the two exchanged rings, and two weeks later she wrote in his album some affectionate lines bidding him farewell. After Chopin left Warsaw, he and Gładkowska did not meet and apparently did not correspond.

===Career===
====Travel and domestic success====
In September 1828, Chopin, while still a student, visited Berlin with a family friend, zoologist Feliks Jarocki, enjoying operas directed by Gaspare Spontini and attending concerts by Carl Friedrich Zelter, Felix Mendelssohn, and other celebrities. On an 1829 return trip to Berlin, he was a guest of Prince Antoni Radziwiłł, governor of the Grand Duchy of Posenhimself an accomplished composer and aspiring cellist. For the prince and his pianist daughter Wanda, he composed his Introduction and Polonaise brillante in C major for cello and piano, Op. 3.

Back in Warsaw that year, Chopin heard Niccolò Paganini play the violin, and composed a set of variations, . It may have been this experience that encouraged him to commence writing his first Études (1829–1832), exploring the capacities of his own instrument. After completing his studies at the Warsaw Conservatory, he made his debut in Vienna. He gave two piano concerts and received many favourable reviewsin addition to some commenting (in Chopin&#x27;s own words) that he was &quot;too delicate for those accustomed to the piano-bashing of local artists&quot;. In the first of these concerts, he premiered his Variations on, Op. 2 (variations on a duet from Mozart&#x27;s opera &quot;Don Giovanni&quot;) for piano and orchestra. He returned to Warsaw in September 1829, where he premiered his Piano Concerto No. 2 in F minor, Op. 21 on 17 March 1830.

Chopin&#x27;s successes as a composer and performer opened the door to western Europe for him, and on 2 November 1830, he set out, in the words of Zdzisław Jachimecki, &quot;into the wide world, with no very clearly defined aim, forever&quot;. With Woyciechowski, he headed for Austria again, intending to go on to Italy. Later that month, in Warsaw, the November 1830 Uprising broke out, and Woyciechowski returned to Poland to enlist. Chopin, now alone in Vienna, was nostalgic for his homeland, and wrote to a friend, &quot;I curse the moment of my departure.&quot; When in September 1831 he learned, while travelling from Vienna to Paris, that the uprising had been crushed, he expressed his anguish in the pages of his private journal: &quot;Oh God! ... You are there, and yet you do not take vengeance!&quot;. The journal is now in the National Library of Poland. Jachimecki ascribes to these events the composer&#x27;s maturing &quot;into an inspired national bard who intuited the past, present and future of his native Poland&quot;.

====Paris====

When he left Warsaw on 2 November 1830, Chopin had intended to go to Italy, but violent unrest there made that a dangerous destination. His next choice was Paris; difficulties obtaining a visa from Russian authorities resulted in him obtaining transit permission from the French. In later years he would quote the passport&#x27;s endorsement (&quot;In transit to London via Paris&quot;), joking that he was in the city &quot;only in passing&quot;. Chopin arrived in Paris on 5 October 1831;
 he would never return to Poland, thus becoming one of many expatriates of the Polish Great Emigration. In France, he used the French versions of his given names, and after receiving French citizenship in 1835, he travelled on a French passport. Chopin remained close to his fellow Poles in exile as friends and confidants. He never felt fully comfortable speaking French or considered himself to be French, despite his father&#x27;s French origins. He always saw himself as a Pole, Adam Zamoyski wrote.

In Paris, Chopin encountered artists and other distinguished figures and found many opportunities to exercise his talents and achieve celebrity. During his years in Paris, he was to become acquainted with, among many others, Hector Berlioz, Franz Liszt, Ferdinand Hiller, Heinrich Heine, Eugène Delacroix, Alfred de Vigny, and Friedrich Kalkbrenner, who introduced him to the piano manufacturer Camille Pleyel. This was the beginning of a long and close association between the composer and Pleyel&#x27;s instruments. Chopin was also acquainted with the poet Adam Mickiewicz, principal of the Polish Literary Society, some of whose verses he set as songs. He also was more than once guest of Marquis Astolphe de Custine, one of his fervent admirers, playing his works in Custine&#x27;s salon.

Two Polish friends in Paris were also to play important roles in Chopin&#x27;s life there. A fellow student at the Warsaw Conservatory, Julian Fontana, had originally tried unsuccessfully to establish himself in England; Fontana was to become, in the words of the music historian Jim Samson, Chopin&#x27;s &quot;general factotum and copyist&quot;. Albert Grzymała, who in Paris became a wealthy financier and society figure, often acted as Chopin&#x27;s adviser and, in Zamoyski&#x27;s words, &quot;gradually began to fill the role of elder brother in [his] life&quot;.

On 7 December 1831, Chopin received the first major endorsement from an outstanding contemporary when Robert Schumann, reviewing the Op. 2 Variations in the (his first published article on music), declared: &quot;Hats off, gentlemen! A genius.&quot; On 25 February 1832 Chopin gave a debut Paris concert in the at 9 rue Cadet, which drew universal admiration. The critic François-Joseph Fétis wrote in the : &quot;Here is a young man who ... taking no model, has found, if not a complete renewal of piano music, ... an abundance of original ideas of a kind to be found nowhere else ...&quot; After this concert, Chopin realised that his essentially intimate keyboard technique was not optimal for large concert spaces. Later that year he was introduced to the wealthy Rothschild banking family, whose patronage also opened doors for him to other private salons (social gatherings of the aristocracy and artistic and literary elite). By the end of 1832 Chopin had established himself among the Parisian musical elite and had earned the respect of his peers such as Hiller, Liszt, and Berlioz. He no longer depended financially upon his father, and in the winter of 1832, he began earning a handsome income from publishing his works and teaching piano to affluent students from all over Europe. This freed him from the strains of public concert-giving, which he disliked.

Chopin seldom performed publicly in Paris. In later years he generally gave a single annual concert at the Salle Pleyel, a venue that seated three hundred. He played more frequently at salons but preferred playing at his own Paris apartment for small groups of friends. The musicologist Arthur Hedley has observed that &quot;As a pianist Chopin was unique in acquiring a reputation of the highest order on the basis of a minimum of public appearancesfew more than thirty in the course of his lifetime.&quot; The list of musicians who took part in some of his concerts indicates the richness of Parisian artistic life during this period. Examples include a concert on 23 March 1833, in which Chopin, Liszt, and Hiller performed (on pianos) a concerto by J. S. Bach for three keyboards; and, on 3 March 1838, a concert in which Chopin, his pupil Adolphe Gutmann, Charles-Valentin Alkan, and Alkan&#x27;s teacher Joseph Zimmermann performed Alkan&#x27;s arrangement, for eight hands, of two movements from Beethoven&#x27;s 7th symphony. Chopin was also involved in the composition of Liszt&#x27;s &quot;Hexameron&quot;; he wrote the sixth (and final) variation on Bellini&#x27;s theme. Chopin&#x27;s music soon found success with publishers, and in 1833 he contracted with Maurice Schlesinger, who arranged for it to be published not only in France but, through his family connections, also in Germany and England.
In the spring of 1834, Chopin attended the Lower Rhenish Music Festival in Aix-la-Chapelle with Hiller, and it was there that Chopin met Felix Mendelssohn. After the festival, the three visited Düsseldorf, where Mendelssohn had been appointed musical director. They spent what Mendelssohn described as &quot;a very agreeable day&quot;, playing and discussing music at his piano, and met Friedrich Wilhelm Schadow, director of the Academy of Art, and some of his eminent pupils such as Lessing, Bendemann, Hildebrandt and Sohn. In 1835 Chopin went to Carlsbad, where he spent time with his parents; it was the last time he would see them. On his way back to Paris, he met old friends from Warsaw, the Wodzińskis, their sons, and their daughters, amongst which Maria, whom he occasionally had given piano lessons in Poland. This meeting prompted him to stay for two weeks in Dresden, when he had previously intended to return to Paris via Leipzig. The sixteen-year-old girl&#x27;s portrait of the composer has been considered, along with Delacroix&#x27;s, as among the best likenesses of Chopin.
In October he finally reached Leipzig, where he met Schumann, Clara Wieck, and Mendelssohn, who organised for him a performance of his own oratorio &quot;St. Paul&quot;, and who considered him &quot;a perfect musician&quot;. In July 1836 Chopin travelled to Marienbad and Dresden to be with the Wodziński family, and in September he proposed to Maria, whose mother Countess Wodzińska approved in principle. Chopin went on to Leipzig, where he presented Schumann with his G minor Ballade. At the end of 1836, he sent Maria an album in which his sister Ludwika had inscribed seven of his songs, and his 1830 Nocturne in C-sharp minor, &quot;Lento con gran espresisione&quot;. The anodyne thanks he received from Maria proved to be the last letter he was to have from her. Chopin placed the letters he had received from Maria and her mother into a large envelope, wrote on it the words &quot;My sorrow&quot; (), and to the end of his life retained in a desk drawer this keepsake of the second love of his life.

====Franz Liszt====

Although it is not known exactly when Chopin first met Franz Liszt after arriving in Paris, on 12 December 1831 he mentioned in a letter to his friend Woyciechowski that &quot;I have met Rossini, Cherubini, Baillot, etc.also Kalkbrenner. You would not believe how curious I was about Herz, Liszt, Hiller, etc.&quot; Liszt was in attendance at Chopin&#x27;s Parisian debut on 26 February 1832 at the Salle Pleyel, which led him to remark: &quot;The most vigorous applause seemed not to suffice to our enthusiasm in the presence of this talented musician, who revealed a new phase of poetic sentiment combined with such happy innovation in the form of his art.&quot;

The two became friends, and for many years lived close to each other in Paris, Chopin at 38 , and Liszt at the on the , a few blocks away. They performed together on seven occasions between 1833 and 1841. The first, on 2 April 1833, was at a benefit concert organised by Hector Berlioz for his bankrupt Shakespearean actress wife Harriet Smithson, during which they played George Onslow&#x27;s &quot;Sonata in F minor&quot; for piano duet. Later joint appearances included a benefit concert for the Benevolent Association of Polish Ladies in Paris. Their last appearance together in public was for a charity concert conducted for the Beethoven Monument in Bonn, held at the Salle Pleyel and the Paris Conservatory on 25 and 26 April 1841.

Although the two displayed great respect and admiration for each other, their friendship was uneasy and had some qualities of a love–hate relationship. Harold C. Schonberg believes that Chopin displayed a &quot;tinge of jealousy and spite&quot; towards Liszt&#x27;s virtuosity on the piano, and others have also argued that he had become enchanted with Liszt&#x27;s theatricality, showmanship, and success. Liszt was the dedicatee of Chopin&#x27;s Op. 10 , and his performance of them prompted the composer to write to Hiller, &quot;I should like to rob him of the way he plays my studies.&quot; However, Chopin expressed annoyance in 1843 when Liszt performed one of his nocturnes with the addition of numerous intricate embellishments, at which Chopin remarked that he should play the music as written or not play it at all, forcing an apology. Most biographers of Chopin state that after this the two had little to do with each other, although in his letters dated as late as 1848 he still referred to him as &quot;my friend Liszt&quot;. Some commentators point to events in the two men&#x27;s romantic lives which led to a rift between them; there are claims that Liszt had displayed jealousy of his mistress Marie d&#x27;Agoult&#x27;s obsession with Chopin, while others believe that Chopin had become concerned about Liszt&#x27;s growing relationship with George Sand.

====George Sand====

In 1836, at a party hosted by Marie d&#x27;Agoult, Chopin met the French author George Sand (born [Amantine] Aurore [Lucile] Dupin). Short (under five feet, or 152 cm), dark, big-eyed and a cigar smoker, she initially repelled Chopin, who remarked, &quot;What an unattractive person &quot;la Sand&quot; is. Is she really a woman?&quot; However, by early 1837 Maria Wodzińska&#x27;s mother had made it clear to Chopin in correspondence that a marriage with her daughter was unlikely to proceed. It is thought that she was influenced by his poor health and possibly also by rumours about his associations with women such as d&#x27;Agoult and Sand. Chopin finally placed the letters from Maria and her mother in a package on which he wrote, in Polish, &quot;My Sorrow&quot;. Sand, in a letter to Grzymała of June 1838, admitted strong feelings for the composer and debated whether to abandon a current affair to begin a relationship with Chopin; she asked Grzymała to assess Chopin&#x27;s relationship with Maria Wodzińska, without realising that the affair, at least from Maria&#x27;s side, was over.

In June 1837, Chopin visited London incognito in the company of the piano manufacturer Camille Pleyel, where he played at a musical soirée at the house of English piano maker James Broadwood. On his return to Paris his association with Sand began in earnest, and by July 1838 they had become lovers. Sand, who was six years older than the composer and had had a series of lovers, wrote at this time: &quot;I must say I was confused and amazed at the effect this little creature had on me ... I have still not recovered from my astonishment, and if I were a proud person I should be feeling humiliated at having been carried away ...&quot; The two spent a miserable winter on Majorca (8 November 1838 to 13 February 1839), where, together with Sand&#x27;s two children, they had journeyed in the hope of improving Chopin&#x27;s health and that of Sand&#x27;s 15-year-old son Maurice, and also to escape the threats of Sand&#x27;s former lover Félicien Mallefille. After discovering that the couple were not married, the deeply traditional Catholic people of Majorca became inhospitable, making accommodation difficult to find. This compelled the group to take lodgings in a former Carthusian monastery in Valldemossa, which gave little shelter from the cold winter weather.
On 3 December 1838, Chopin complained about his bad health and the incompetence of the doctors in Majorca, commenting: &quot;The three most celebrated doctors on the island have seen me ... The first said I was dead, the second that I am dying, and the third that I&#x27;m going to die&quot; He also had problems having his Pleyel piano sent to him, having to rely in the meantime on a piano made in Palma by Juan Bauza. The Pleyel piano finally arrived from Paris in December, just shortly before Chopin and Sand left the island. Chopin wrote to Pleyel in January 1839: &quot;I am sending you my Preludes [Op. 28]. I finished them on your little piano, which arrived in the best possible condition in spite of the sea, the bad weather and the Palma customs.&quot; Chopin was also able to undertake work while in Majorca on his Ballade No. 2, Op. 38; on two Polonaises, Op. 40; and on the Scherzo No. 3, Op. 39.

Although this period had been productive, the bad weather had such a detrimental effect on Chopin&#x27;s health that Sand determined to leave the island. To avoid further customs duties, Sand sold the piano to a local French couple, the Canuts. The group travelled first to Barcelona, then to Marseille, where they stayed for a few months while Chopin convalesced. While in Marseille, Chopin made a rare appearance at the organ during a requiem mass for the tenor Adolphe Nourrit on 24 April 1839, playing a transcription of Franz Schubert&#x27;s (D. 939). George Sand gives a description of Chopin&#x27;s playing in a letter of 28 April 1839:

In May 1839, they headed to Sand&#x27;s estate at Nohant for the summer, where they spent most of the following summers until 1846. In autumn they returned to Paris, where Chopin&#x27;s apartment at 5 rue Tronchet was close to Sand&#x27;s rented accommodation on the rue Pigalle. He frequently visited Sand in the evenings, but both retained some independence. (In 1842 he and Sand moved to the Square d&#x27;Orléans, living in adjacent buildings.)

On 26 July 1840, Chopin and Sand were present at the dress rehearsal of Berlioz&#x27;s , composed to commemorate the tenth anniversary of the July Revolution. Chopin was reportedly unimpressed with the composition. 

During the summers at Nohant, particularly in the years 1839–1843 (except 1840), Chopin found quiet, productive days during which he composed many works, including his Polonaise in A-flat major, Op. 53. Sand compellingly describes Chopin&#x27;s creative process: an inspiration, its painstaking elaboration – sometimes amid tormented weeping and complaining, with hundreds of changes in concept – only to return finally to the initial idea.

Among the visitors to Nohant were Delacroix and the mezzo-soprano Pauline Viardot, whom Chopin had advised on piano technique and composition. Delacroix gives an account of staying at Nohant in a letter of 7 June 1842:

====Decline====
From 1842 onwards, Chopin showed signs of serious illness. After a solo recital in Paris on 21 February 1842, he wrote to Grzymała: &quot;I have to lie in bed all day long, my mouth and tonsils are aching so much.&quot; He was forced by illness to decline a written invitation from Alkan to participate in a repeat performance of the Beethoven 7th Symphony arrangement at Érard&#x27;s on 1 March 1843. Late in 1844, Charles Hallé visited Chopin and found him &quot;hardly able to move, bent like a half-opened penknife and evidently in great pain&quot;, although his spirits returned when he started to play the piano for his visitor. Chopin&#x27;s health continued to deteriorate, particularly from this time onwards. Modern research suggests that apart from any other illnesses, he may also have suffered from temporal lobe epilepsy.

Chopin&#x27;s output as a composer throughout this period declined in quantity year by year. Whereas in 1841 he had written a dozen works, only six were written in 1842 and six shorter pieces in 1843. In 1844 he wrote only the Op. 58 sonata. 1845 saw the completion of three mazurkas (Op. 59). Although these works were more refined than many of his earlier compositions, Zamoyski concludes that &quot;his powers of concentration were failing and his inspiration was beset by anguish, both emotional and intellectual&quot;. Chopin&#x27;s relations with Sand were soured in 1846 by problems involving her daughter Solange and Solange&#x27;s fiancé, the young fortune-hunting sculptor Auguste Clésinger. The composer frequently took Solange&#x27;s side in quarrels with her mother; he also faced jealousy from Sand&#x27;s son Maurice. Moreover, Chopin was indifferent to Sand&#x27;s radical political pursuits, including her enthusiasm for the February Revolution of 1848.

As the composer&#x27;s illness progressed, Sand had become less of a lover and more of a nurse to Chopin, whom she called her &quot;third child&quot;. In letters to third parties she vented her impatience, referring to him as a &quot;child&quot;, a &quot;poor angel&quot;, a &quot;sufferer&quot;, and a &quot;beloved little corpse&quot;. In 1847 Sand published her novel &quot;Lucrezia Floriani&quot;, whose main charactersa rich actress and a prince in weak healthcould be interpreted as Sand and Chopin. In Chopin&#x27;s presence, Sand read the manuscript aloud to Delacroix, who was both shocked and mystified by its implications, writing that &quot;Madame Sand was perfectly at ease and Chopin could hardly stop making admiring comments&quot;. That year their relationship ended following an angry correspondence which, in Sand&#x27;s words, made &quot;a strange conclusion to nine years of exclusive friendship&quot;. Grzymała, who had followed their romance from the beginning, commented, &quot;If [Chopin] had not had the misfortune of meeting G. S. [George Sand], who poisoned his whole being, he would have lived to be Cherubini&#x27;s age.&quot; Chopin would die two years later at thirty-nine; the composer Luigi Cherubini had died in Paris in 1842 at the age of 81.

====Tour of Great Britain====

Chopin&#x27;s public popularity as a virtuoso began to wane, as did the number of his pupils, and this, together with the political strife and instability of the time, caused him to struggle financially. In February 1848, with the cellist Auguste Franchomme, he gave his last Paris concert, which included three movements of the Cello Sonata Op. 65.

In April, during the 1848 Revolution in Paris, he left for London, where he performed at several concerts and numerous receptions in great houses. This tour was suggested to him by his Scottish pupil Jane Stirling and her elder sister. Stirling also made all the logistical arrangements and provided much of the necessary funding.

In London, Chopin took lodgings at Dover Street, where the firm of Broadwood provided him with a grand piano. At his first engagement, on 15 May at Stafford House, the audience included Queen Victoria and Prince Albert. The Prince, who was himself a talented musician, moved close to the keyboard to view Chopin&#x27;s technique. Broadwood also arranged concerts for him; among those attending were the author William Makepeace Thackeray and the singer Jenny Lind. Chopin was also sought after for piano lessons, for which he charged the high fee of one guinea per hour, and for private recitals for which the fee was 20 guineas. At a concert on 7 July he shared the platform with Viardot, who sang arrangements of some of his mazurkas to Spanish texts. A few days later, he performed for Thomas Carlyle and his wife Jane at their home in Chelsea. On 28 August he played at a concert in Manchester&#x27;s Gentlemen&#x27;s Concert Hall, sharing the stage with Marietta Alboni and Lorenzo Salvi.

In late summer he was invited by Jane Stirling to visit Scotland, where he stayed at Calder House near Edinburgh and at Johnstone Castle in Renfrewshire, both owned by members of Stirling&#x27;s family. She clearly had a notion of going beyond mere friendship, and Chopin was obliged to make it clear to her that this could not be so. He wrote at this time to Grzymała: &quot;My Scottish ladies are kind, but such bores&quot;, and responding to a rumour about his involvement, answered that he was &quot;closer to the grave than the nuptial bed&quot;. He gave a public concert in Glasgow on 27 September, and another in Edinburgh at the Hopetoun Rooms on Queen Street (now Erskine House) on 4 October. In late October 1848, while staying at 10 Warriston Crescent in Edinburgh with the Polish physician Adam Łyszczyński, he wrote out his last will and testament&quot;a kind of disposition to be made of my stuff in the future, if I should drop dead somewhere&quot;, he wrote to Grzymała.

Chopin made his last public appearance on a concert platform at London&#x27;s Guildhall on 16 November 1848, when, in a final patriotic gesture, he played for the benefit of Polish refugees. This gesture proved to be a mistake, as most of the participants were more interested in the dancing and refreshments than in Chopin&#x27;s piano artistry, which drained him. By this time he was very seriously ill, weighing under 45 kg (99 lb), and his doctors were aware that his sickness was at a terminal stage.

At the end of November Chopin returned to Paris. He passed the winter in unremitting illness, but gave occasional lessons and was visited by friends, including Delacroix and Franchomme. Occasionally he played, or accompanied the singing of Delfina Potocka, for his friends. During the summer of 1849, his friends found him an apartment in Chaillot, out of the centre of the city, for which the rent was secretly subsidised by an admirer, Princess Yekaterina Dmitrievna Soutzos-Obreskova. He was visited here by Jenny Lind in June 1849.

===Death and funeral===

With his health further deteriorating, Chopin desired to have a family member with him. In June 1849 his sister Ludwika came to Paris with her husband and daughter, and in September, he took an apartment at the Hôtel Baudard de Saint-James on the Place Vendôme, with rent possibly supported by Jane Stirling. After 15 October, when his condition took a marked turn for the worse, only a handful of his closest friends remained with him. Viardot remarked sardonically, though, that &quot;all the grand Parisian ladies considered it to faint in his room&quot;.

Some of his friends provided music at his request; among them, Potocka sang and Franchomme played the cello. Chopin bequeathed his unfinished notes on a piano tuition method, , to Alkan for completion. On 17 October, after midnight, the physician leaned over him and asked whether he was suffering greatly. &quot;No longer&quot;, he replied. He died a few minutes before 2 a.m. He was 39. Those present at the deathbed appear to have included his sister Ludwika, Fr. Aleksander Jełowicki, Princess Marcelina Czartoryska, Sand&#x27;s daughter Solange, and his close friend Thomas Albrecht. Later that morning, Solange&#x27;s husband Clésinger made Chopin&#x27;s death mask and a cast of his left hand.

The funeral, held at the Church of the Madeleine in Paris, was delayed almost two weeks until 30 October. Entrance was restricted to ticket holders, as many people were expected to attend. Over 3,000 people arrived without invitations, from as far as London, Berlin and Vienna, and were excluded.

Mozart&#x27;s Requiem was sung at the funeral; the soloists were the soprano Jeanne-Anaïs Castellan, the mezzo-soprano Pauline Viardot, the tenor Alexis Dupont, and the bass Luigi Lablache; Chopin&#x27;s Preludes No. 4 in E minor and No. 6 in B minor were also played. The organist was Alfred Lefébure-Wély. The funeral procession to Père Lachaise Cemetery, which included Chopin&#x27;s sister Ludwika, was led by the aged Prince Adam Czartoryski. The pallbearers included Delacroix, Franchomme, and Camille Pleyel. At the graveside, the &quot;Funeral March&quot; from Chopin&#x27;s Piano Sonata No. 2 was played, in Reber&#x27;s instrumentation.

Chopin&#x27;s tombstone, featuring the muse of music, Euterpe, weeping over a broken lyre, was designed and sculpted by Clésinger and installed on the anniversary of his death in 1850. The expenses of the monument, amounting to 4,500 francs, were covered by Jane Stirling, who also paid for the return of the composer&#x27;s sister Ludwika to Warsaw. As requested by Chopin, Ludwika took his heart (which had been removed by his doctor Jean Cruveilhier and preserved in alcohol in a vase) back to Poland in 1850. She also took a collection of 200 letters from Sand to Chopin; after 1851 these were returned to Sand, who destroyed them.

Chopin&#x27;s disease and the cause of his death have been topics of debate. His death certificate gave the cause as tuberculosis, and his physician, Cruveilhier, was then the leading French authority on this disease. Other possibilities advanced have included cystic fibrosis, cirrhosis, and alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency. A visual examination of Chopin&#x27;s preserved heart (the jar was not opened), conducted in 2014 and first published in the &quot;American Journal of Medicine&quot; in 2017, suggested that the likely cause of his death was a rare case of pericarditis caused by complications of chronic tuberculosis.

==Music==

===Overview===
Over 230 works of Chopin survive; some compositions from early childhood have been lost. All his known works involve the piano, and only a few range beyond solo piano music, as either piano concertos, songs or chamber music.

Chopin was educated in the tradition of Beethoven, Haydn, Mozart, and Clementi; he used Clementi&#x27;s piano method with his students. He was also influenced by Hummel&#x27;s development of virtuoso, yet Mozartian, piano technique. He cited Bach and Mozart as the two most important composers in shaping his musical outlook. Chopin&#x27;s early works are in the style of the &quot;brilliant&quot; keyboard pieces of his era as exemplified by the works of Ignaz Moscheles, Friedrich Kalkbrenner, and others. Less direct in the earlier period are the influences of Polish folk music and of Italian opera. Much of what became his typical style of ornamentation (for example, his &quot;fioriture&quot;) is taken from singing. His melodic lines were increasingly reminiscent of the modes and features of the music of his native country, such as drones.

Chopin took the new salon genre of the nocturne, invented by the Irish composer John Field, to a deeper level of sophistication. He was the first to write ballades and scherzi as individual concert pieces. He essentially established a new genre with his own set of free-standing preludes (Op. 28, published 1839). He exploited the poetic potential of the concept of the concert étude, already being developed in the 1820s and 1830s by Liszt, Clementi, and Moscheles, in his two sets of studies (Op. 10 published in 1833, Op. 25 in 1837).

Chopin also endowed popular dance forms with a greater range of melody and expression. Chopin&#x27;s mazurkas, while originating in the traditional Polish dance (the &quot;mazurek&quot;), differed from the traditional variety in that they were written for the concert hall rather than the dance hall; as J. Barrie Jones puts it, &quot;it was Chopin who put the mazurka on the European musical map&quot;. The series of seven polonaises published in his lifetime (another nine were published posthumously), beginning with the Op. 26 pair (published 1836), set a new standard for music in the form. His waltzes were also written specifically for the salon recital rather than the ballroom and are frequently at rather faster tempos than their dance-floor equivalents.

===Titles, opus numbers and editions===

Some of Chopin&#x27;s well-known pieces have acquired descriptive titles, such as the &quot;Revolutionary&quot; Étude (Op. 10, No. 12), and the &quot;Minute Waltz&quot; (Op. 64, No. 1). However, except for his &quot;Funeral March&quot;, the composer never named an instrumental work beyond genre and number, leaving all potential extramusical associations to the listener; the names by which many of his pieces are known were invented by others. There is no evidence to suggest that the &quot;Revolutionary&quot; Étude was written with the failed Polish uprising against Russia in mind; it merely appeared at that time. The &quot;Funeral March&quot;, the third movement of his Sonata No. 2 (Op. 35), the one case where he did give a title, was written before the rest of the sonata, but no specific event or death is known to have inspired it.

The last opus number that Chopin himself used was 65, allocated to the Cello Sonata in G minor. He expressed a deathbed wish that all his unpublished manuscripts be destroyed. At the request of the composer&#x27;s mother and sisters, however, his musical executor Julian Fontana selected 23 unpublished piano pieces and grouped them into eight further opus numbers (Opp. 66–73), published in 1855. In 1857, 17 Polish songs that Chopin wrote at various stages of his life were collected and published as Op. 74, though their order within the opus did not reflect the order of composition.

Works published since 1857 have received alternative catalogue designations instead of opus numbers. The most up-to-date catalogue is maintained by the Fryderyk Chopin Institute at its Internet Chopin Information Centre. The older Kobylańska Catalogue (usually represented by the initials &#x27;KK&#x27;), named for its compiler, the Polish musicologist Krystyna Kobylańska, is still considered an important scholarly reference. The most recent catalogue of posthumously published works is that of the National Edition of the Works of Fryderyk Chopin, represented by the initials &#x27;WN&#x27;.

Chopin&#x27;s original publishers included Maurice Schlesinger and Camille Pleyel. His works soon began to appear in popular 19th-century piano anthologies. The first collected edition was by Breitkopf &amp; Härtel (1878–1902). Among modern scholarly editions of Chopin&#x27;s works is the version named after Paderewski (although he died before the work had begun), published between 1949 and 1961. However, scholarly opinion has moved against this edition. The more recent Polish National Edition, edited by Jan Ekier and published between 1967 and 2010, is recommended to contestants of the Chopin Competition. Both editions contain detailed explanations and discussions regarding choices and sources.

Chopin published his music in France, England, and the German states (i.e. he worked with as many as three separate publishers for each piece or set of pieces) due to the copyright laws of the time. Thus there are often three different &quot;first editions&quot; of each work. Each edition is different from the others; Chopin edited them separately, and at times he did some revision to the music while editing it. Furthermore, Chopin provided his publishers with varying sources, including autographs, annotated proofsheets, and scribal copies. Only recently have these differences gained greater recognition.

===Form and harmony===
Improvisation stands at the centre of Chopin&#x27;s creative processes. However, this does not imply impulsive rambling: Nicholas Temperley writes that &quot;improvisation is designed for an audience, and its starting-point is that audience&#x27;s expectations, which include the current conventions of musical form&quot;. The works for piano and orchestra, including the two concertos, are held by Temperley to be &quot;merely vehicles for brilliant piano playing ... formally longwinded and extremely conservative&quot;. After the piano concertos (which are both early, dating from 1830), Chopin made no attempts at large-scale multi-movement forms, save for his late sonatas for piano and cello; &quot;instead he achieved near-perfection in pieces of simple general design but subtle and complex cell-structure&quot;. Rosen suggests that an important aspect of Chopin&#x27;s individuality is his flexible handling of the four-bar phrase as a structural unit.

J. Barrie Jones suggests that &quot;amongst the works that Chopin intended for concert use, the four ballades and four scherzi stand supreme&quot;, and adds that &quot;the Barcarolle Op. 60 stands apart as an example of Chopin&#x27;s rich harmonic palette coupled with an Italianate warmth of melody&quot;. Temperley opines that these works, which contain &quot;immense variety of mood, thematic material and structural detail&quot;, are based on an extended &quot;departure and return&quot; form; &quot;the more the middle section is extended, and the further it departs in key, mood and theme, from the opening idea, the more important and dramatic is the reprise when it at last comes&quot;.

Chopin&#x27;s mazurkas and waltzes are all in straightforward ternary or episodic form, sometimes with a coda. The mazurkas often show more folk features than many of his other works, sometimes including modal scales and harmonies and the use of drone basses. However, some also show unusual sophistication, for example, Op. 63 No. 3, which includes a canon at one beat&#x27;s distance, a great rarity in music.

Chopin&#x27;s polonaises show a marked advance on those of his Polish predecessors in the form (who included his teachers Żywny and Elsner). As with the traditional polonaise, Chopin&#x27;s works are in triple time and typically display a martial rhythm in their melodies, accompaniments, and cadences. Unlike most of their precursors, they also require a formidable playing technique.

His nocturnes are more structured, and of greater emotional depth, than those of Field, whom Chopin met in 1832. Many of the Chopin nocturnes have middle sections marked by agitated expression (and often making very difficult demands on the performer), which heightens their dramatic character.

Chopin&#x27;s études are largely in straightforward ternary form. He used them to teach his own technique of piano playingfor instance playing double thirds (Op. 25, No. 6), playing in octaves (Op. 25, No. 10), and playing repeated notes (Op. 10, No.  7).

The preludes, many of which are very brief, were described by Schumann as &quot;the beginnings of studies&quot;. Inspired by J. S. Bach&#x27;s &quot;The Well-Tempered Clavier&quot;, Chopin&#x27;s preludes move up the circle of fifths (rather than Bach&#x27;s chromatic scale sequence) to create a prelude in each major and minor tonality. The preludes were perhaps not intended to be played as a group, and may even have been used by him and later pianists as generic preludes to others of his pieces, or even to music by other composers. This is suggested by Kenneth Hamilton, who has noted a 1922 recording by Ferruccio Busoni in which the Prelude Op. 28 No. 7 is followed by the Étude Op. 10 No. 5.

The two mature Chopin piano sonatas (No. 2, Op. 35, written in 1839 and No. 3, Op. 58, written in 1844) are in four movements. In Op. 35, Chopin combined within a formal large musical structure many elements of his virtuosic piano technique&quot;a kind of dialogue between the public pianism of the brilliant style and the German sonata principle&quot;. This sonata has been considered as showing the influences of both Bach and Beethoven. The Prelude from Bach&#x27;s Suite No. 6 in D major for cello (BWV 1012) is quoted; and there are references to the Sonata Opus 26 by Beethoven, which, like Chopin&#x27;s Op. 35, has a funeral march as its slow movement. The last movement of Chopin&#x27;s Op. 35, a brief (75-bar) perpetuum mobile in which the hands play in unmodified octave unison throughout, was found shocking and unmusical by contemporaries, including Schumann. The Op. 58 sonata is closer to the German tradition, including many passages of complex counterpoint, &quot;worthy of Brahms&quot; according to Samson.

Chopin&#x27;s harmonic innovations may have arisen partly from his keyboard improvisation technique. In his works, Temperley says, &quot;novel harmonic effects often result from the combination of ordinary appoggiaturas or passing notes with melodic figures of accompaniment&quot;, and cadences are delayed by the use of chords outside the home key (neapolitan sixths and diminished sevenths) or by sudden shifts to remote keys. Chord progressions sometimes anticipate the shifting tonality of later composers such as Claude Debussy, as does Chopin&#x27;s use of modal harmony.

===Technique and performance style===
In 1841 Léon Escudier wrote of a recital given by Chopin that year, &quot;One may say that Chopin is the creator of a school of piano and a school of composition. In truth, nothing equals the lightness, the sweetness with which the composer preludes on the piano; moreover nothing may be compared to his works full of originality, distinction and grace.&quot; Chopin refused to conform to a standard method of playing and believed that there was no set technique for playing well. His style was based extensively on his use of a very independent finger technique. In his he wrote: &quot;Everything is a matter of knowing good fingering ... we need no less to use the rest of the hand, the wrist, the forearm and the upper arm.&quot; He further stated: &quot;One needs only to study a certain position of the hand in relation to the keys to obtain with ease the most beautiful quality of sound, to know how to play short notes and long notes, and [to attain] unlimited dexterity.&quot; The consequences of this approach to technique in Chopin&#x27;s music include the frequent use of the entire range of the keyboard, passages in double octaves and other chord groupings, swiftly repeated notes, the use of grace notes, and the use of contrasting rhythms (four against three, for example) between the hands.

Jonathan Bellman writes that modern concert performance styleset in the &quot;conservatory&quot; tradition of late 19th- and 20th-century music schools, and suitable for large auditoria or recordingsmilitates against what is known of Chopin&#x27;s more intimate performance technique. The composer himself said to a pupil that &quot;concerts are never real music, you have to give up the idea of hearing in them all the most beautiful things of art&quot;. Contemporary accounts indicate that in performance, Chopin avoided rigid procedures sometimes incorrectly attributed to him, such as &quot;always crescendo to a high note&quot;, but that he was concerned with expressive phrasing, rhythmic consistency and sensitive colouring. Berlioz wrote in 1853 that Chopin &quot;has created a kind of chromatic embroidery ... whose effect is so strange and piquant as to be impossible to describe ... virtually nobody but Chopin himself can play this music and give it this unusual turn&quot;. Hiller wrote that &quot;What in the hands of others was elegant embellishment, in his hands became a colourful wreath of flowers.&quot;

Chopin&#x27;s music is frequently played with &quot;rubato&quot;, &quot;the practice in performance of disregarding strict time, &#x27;robbing&#x27; some note-values for expressive effect&quot;. There are differing opinions as to how much, and what type, of &quot;rubato&quot; is appropriate for his works. Charles Rosen comments that &quot;most of the written-out indications of rubato in Chopin are to be found in his mazurkas ... It is probable that Chopin used the older form of rubato so important to Mozart ... [where] the melody note in the right hand is delayed until after the note in the bass ... An allied form of this rubato is the arpeggiation of the chords thereby delaying the melody note; according to Chopin&#x27;s pupil Karol Mikuli, Chopin was firmly opposed to this practice.&quot;

Chopin&#x27;s pupil wrote:

=== Instruments ===
When living in Warsaw, Chopin composed and played on an instrument built by the piano-maker Fryderyk Buchholtz. Later in Paris Chopin purchased a piano from Pleyel. He rated Pleyel&#x27;s pianos as &quot;non plus ultra&quot; (&quot;nothing better&quot;). Franz Liszt befriended Chopin in Paris and described the sound of Chopin&#x27;s Pleyel as being &quot;the marriage of crystal and water&quot;. While in London in 1848, Chopin mentioned his pianos in his letters: &quot;I have a large drawing-room with three pianos, a Pleyel, a Broadwood and an Erard.&quot;

=== Polish identity ===

With his mazurkas and polonaises, Chopin has been credited with introducing to music a new sense of nationalism. Schumann, in his 1836 review of the piano concertos, highlighted the composer&#x27;s strong feelings for his native Poland, writing:

The biography of Chopin published in 1863 under the name of Franz Liszt (but probably written by Carolyne zu Sayn-Wittgenstein) states that Chopin &quot;must be ranked among the first musicians ... individualizing in themselves the poetic sense of an entire nation&quot;.

Some modern commentators have argued against exaggerating Chopin&#x27;s primacy as a &quot;nationalist&quot; or &quot;patriotic&quot; composer. George Golos refers to earlier &quot;nationalist&quot; composers in Central Europe, including Poland&#x27;s Michał Kleofas Ogiński and Franciszek Lessel, who utilised polonaise and mazurka forms. Barbara Milewski suggests that Chopin&#x27;s experience of Polish music came more from &quot;urbanised&quot; Warsaw versions than from folk music, and that attempts by Jachimecki and others to demonstrate genuine folk music in his works are without basis. Richard Taruskin impugns Schumann&#x27;s attitude toward Chopin&#x27;s works as patronising, and comments that Chopin &quot;felt his Polish patriotism deeply and sincerely&quot; but consciously modelled his works on the tradition of Bach, Beethoven, Schubert, and Field.

A reconciliation of these views is suggested by William Atwood:

=== Reception and influence ===
Jones comments that &quot;Chopin&#x27;s unique position as a composer, despite the fact that virtually everything he wrote was for the piano, has rarely been questioned.&quot; He also notes that Chopin was fortunate to arrive in Paris in 1831&quot;the artistic environment, the publishers who were willing to print his music, the wealthy and aristocratic who paid what Chopin asked for their lessons&quot;and these factors, as well as his musical genius, also fuelled his contemporary and later reputation. While his illness and his love affairs conform to some of the stereotypes of romanticism, the rarity of his public recitals (as opposed to performances at fashionable Paris soirées) led Arthur Hutchings to suggest that &quot;his lack of Byronic flamboyance [and] his aristocratic reclusiveness make him exceptional&quot; among his romantic contemporaries such as Liszt and Henri Herz.

Chopin&#x27;s qualities as a pianist and composer were recognised by many of his fellow musicians. Schumann named a piece for him in his suite &quot;Carnaval&quot;, and Chopin later dedicated his Ballade No. 2 in F major to Schumann. Elements of Chopin&#x27;s music can be found in many of Liszt&#x27;s later works. Liszt later transcribed for piano six of Chopin&#x27;s Polish songs. A less fraught friendship was with Alkan, with whom he discussed elements of folk music, and who was deeply affected by Chopin&#x27;s death.

In Paris, Chopin had a number of pupils, including Friedericke Müller, who left memoirs of his teaching and the prodigy Carl Filtsch, to whom both Chopin and Sand became dedicated, Chopin giving him three lessons a week; Filtsch was the only pupil to whom Chopin gave lessons in composition, and, exceptionally, he on several occasions shared a concert platform with him. Two of Chopin&#x27;s long-standing pupils, Karol Mikuli and Georges Mathias, were themselves piano teachers and passed on details of his playing to their students, some of whom (such as Raoul Koczalski) were to make recordings of his music. Other pianists and composers influenced by Chopin&#x27;s style include Louis Moreau Gottschalk, Édouard Wolff, and Pierre Zimmermann. Debussy dedicated his own 1915 piano Études to the memory of Chopin; he frequently played Chopin&#x27;s music during his studies at the Paris Conservatoire, and undertook the editing of Chopin&#x27;s piano music for the publisher Jacques Durand.
Polish composers of the following generation included virtuosi such as Moritz Moszkowski; but, in the opinion of J. Barrie Jones, his &quot;one worthy successor&quot; among his compatriots was Karol Szymanowski. Edvard Grieg, Antonín Dvořák, Isaac Albéniz, Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky, and Sergei Rachmaninoff, among others, are regarded by critics as having been influenced by Chopin&#x27;s use of national modes and idioms. Alexander Scriabin was devoted to the music of Chopin, and his early published works include nineteen mazurkas as well as numerous études and preludes; his teacher Nikolai Zverev drilled him in Chopin&#x27;s works to improve his virtuosity as a performer. In the 20th century, composers who paid homage to (or in some cases parodied) the music of Chopin included George Crumb, Leopold Godowsky, Bohuslav Martinů, Darius Milhaud, Igor Stravinsky, and Heitor Villa-Lobos.

Chopin&#x27;s music was used in the 1909 ballet &quot;Chopiniana&quot;, choreographed by Michel Fokine and orchestrated by Alexander Glazunov. Sergei Diaghilev commissioned additional orchestrationsfrom Stravinsky, Anatoly Lyadov, Sergei Taneyev, and Nikolai Tcherepninfor later productions, which used the title . Other noted composers have created orchestrations for the ballet, including Benjamin Britten, Roy Douglas, Alexander Gretchaninov, Gordon Jacob, and Maurice Ravel, whose score is lost.

Musicologist Erinn Knyt writes: &quot;In the nineteenth century Chopin and his music were commonly viewed as effeminate, androgynous, childish, sickly, and &#x27;ethnically other. Music historian Jeffrey Kallberg says that in Chopin&#x27;s time, &quot;listeners to the genre of the piano nocturne often couched their reactions in feminine imagery&quot;, and he cites many examples of such reactions to Chopin&#x27;s nocturnes. One reason for this may be &quot;demographic&quot;there were more female than male piano players, and playing such &quot;romantic&quot; pieces was seen by male critics as a female domestic pastime. Such genderization was not commonly applied to other genres among Chopin&#x27;s works, such as the scherzo or the polonaise. The cultural historian Edward Said has cited the demonstrations by pianist and writer Charles Rosen, in the latter&#x27;s book &quot;The Romantic Generation&quot;, of Chopin&#x27;s skills in &quot;planning, polyphony, and sheer harmonic creativity&quot;, as effectively overthrowing any legend of Chopin &quot;as a swooning, &#x27;inspired&#x27;, small-scale salon composer&quot;.

Chopin&#x27;s music remains very popular and is regularly performed, recorded and broadcast worldwide. The world&#x27;s oldest monographic music competition, the International Chopin Piano Competition, founded in 1927, is held every five years in Warsaw. The Fryderyk Chopin Institute lists over eighty societies worldwide devoted to the composer and his music. The Institute site also lists over 1500 performances of Chopin works on YouTube .

== Recordings ==
The British Library notes that &quot;Chopin&#x27;s works have been recorded by all the great pianists of the recording era.&quot; The earliest recording was an 1895 performance by Paul Pabst of the Nocturne in E major, Op. 62, No. 2. The British Library site makes available a number of historic recordings, including some by Alfred Cortot, Ignaz Friedman, Vladimir Horowitz, Benno Moiseiwitsch, Ignacy Jan Paderewski, Arthur Rubinstein, Xaver Scharwenka, Josef Hofmann, Vladimir de Pachmann, Moriz Rosenthal and many others. A select discography of recordings of Chopin works by pianists representing the various pedagogic traditions stemming from Chopin is given by James Methuen-Campbell in his work tracing the lineage and character of those traditions.

Numerous recordings of Chopin&#x27;s works are available. On the occasion of the composer&#x27;s bicentenary, the critics of &quot;The New York Times&quot; recommended performances by the following contemporary pianists (among many others): Martha Argerich, Vladimir Ashkenazy, Emanuel Ax, Evgeny Kissin, Ivan Moravec, Murray Perahia, Maria João Pires, Maurizio Pollini, Alexandre Tharaud, Yundi, and Krystian Zimerman. The Warsaw Chopin Society organises the &quot;Grand prix du disque de F. Chopin&quot; for notable Chopin recordings, held every five years.

== In literature, stage, film and television ==

Chopin has figured extensively in Polish literature, both in serious critical studies and in fictional treatments. The earliest manifestation was probably an 1830 sonnet on Chopin by Leon Ulrich. French writers on Chopin (apart from Sand) have included Marcel Proust and André Gide, and he has also featured in works of Gottfried Benn and Boris Pasternak. There are numerous biographies of Chopin in English (see bibliography for some of these).

Possibly the first venture into fictional treatments of Chopin&#x27;s life was a fanciful operatic version of some of its events: &quot;Chopin&quot; (1901). The musicbased on Chopin&#x27;s ownwas assembled by Giacomo Orefice, with a libretto by .

Chopin&#x27;s life has been fictionalised in numerous films. As early as 1919, Chopin&#x27;s relationships with three womenhis youth sweetheart Mariolka, then Polish singer Sonja Radkowska, and later George Sandwere portrayed in the German silent film &quot;Nocturno der Liebe&quot; (1919). The 1945 biographical film &quot;A Song to Remember&quot; earned Cornel Wilde an Academy Award nomination as Best Actor for his portrayal of the composer. Other film treatments have included (1928) by Henry Roussel, with Pierre Blanchar as Chopin; &quot;Impromptu&quot; (1991), starring Hugh Grant as Chopin; (1991); and &quot;&quot; (2002).

Chopin&#x27;s life was covered in a 1999 BBC &quot;Omnibus&quot; documentary by András Schiff and Mischa Scorer, in a 2010 documentary realised by Angelo Bozzolini and Roberto Prosseda for Italian television, and in a BBC Four documentary &quot;ChopinThe Women Behind The Music&quot; (2010).

<text>The Free Democratic Party (, FDP, ) is a liberal political party in Germany.

The FDP was founded in 1948 by members of former liberal political parties which existed in Germany before World War II, namely the German Democratic Party and the German People&#x27;s Party. For most of the second half of the 20th century, particularly from 1961 to 1982, the FDP held the balance of power in the Bundestag. It has been a junior coalition partner to both the CDU/CSU (1949–1956, 1961–1966, 1982–1998 and 2009–2013) and Social Democratic Party (SPD) (1969–1982, 2021–2024). In the 2013 federal election, the FDP failed to win any directly elected seats in the Bundestag and came up short of the 5 percent threshold to qualify for list representation, being left without representation in the Bundestag for the first time in its history. In the 2017 federal election, the FDP regained its representation in the Bundestag, receiving 10.6% of the vote. From the 2021 federal election to the 2024 German government crisis, the FDP was part of governing Scholz cabinet in a &quot;traffic light coalition&quot; with the Social Democratic Party and the Greens. 

Apart from a brief progressive and social liberal period in the 1970s (&quot;Freiburger Thesen&quot;), the FDP has traditionally been located in the centre-right of the political spectrum. Since the 1980s, the party, consistently with its ordoliberal tradition, has pushed economic liberalism and has aligned itself closely to the promotion of free markets and privatization. The FDP is a member of the Liberal International, the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe and Renew Europe.

== History ==
=== Predecessors ===
The history of liberal parties in Germany dates back to 1861, when the German Progress Party (DFP) was founded, being the first political party in the modern sense in Germany. From the establishment of the National Liberal Party in 1867 until the demise of the Weimar Republic in 1933, the liberal-democratic camp was divided into a &quot;national-liberal&quot; and a &quot;left-liberal&quot; line of tradition. After 1918 the national-liberal strain was represented by the German People&#x27;s Party (DVP), the left-liberal one by the German Democratic Party (DDP, which merged into the German State Party in 1930). Both parties played an important role in government during the Weimar Republic era, but successively lost votes during the rise of the Nazi Party beginning in the late-1920s. After the Nazi seizure of power, both liberal parties agreed to the Enabling Act of 1933 and subsequently dissolved themselves. During the 12 years of Hitler&#x27;s rule, some former liberals collaborated with the Nazis (e.g. economy minister Hjalmar Schacht), while others resisted actively against Nazism, with some Liberal leaning members and former members of the military joining up with Henning von Tresckow (e.g. the Solf Circle).

Soon after World War II, the Soviet Union pushed for the creation of licensed &quot;anti-fascist&quot; parties in its occupation zone in East Germany. In July 1945, former DDP politicians Wilhelm Külz, Eugen Schiffer and Waldemar Koch called for the establishment of a pan-German liberal party. Their Liberal-Democratic Party (LDP) was soon licensed by the Soviet Military Administration in Germany, under the condition that the new party joined the pro-Soviet &quot;Democratic Bloc&quot;.

In September 1945, citizens in Hamburg—including the anti-Nazi resistance circle &quot;Association Free Hamburg&quot;—established the &quot;Party of Free Democrats&quot; (PFD) as a bourgeois left-wing party and the first liberal Party in the Western occupation zones. The German Democratic Party was revived in some states of the Western occupation zones (in the Southwestern states of Württemberg-Baden and Württemberg-Hohenzollern under the name of Democratic People&#x27;s Party).

Many former members of DDP and DVP however agreed to finally overcome the traditional split of German liberalism into a national-liberal and a left-liberal branch, aiming for the creation of a united liberal party. In October 1945 a liberal coalition party was founded in the state of Bremen under the name of Bremen Democratic People&#x27;s Party. In January 1946, liberal state parties of the British occupation zone merged into the &quot;Free Democratic Party of the British Zone&quot; (FDP). A similar state party in Hesse, called the Liberal Democratic Party, was licensed by the U.S. military government in January 1946. In the state of Bavaria, a &quot;Free Democratic Party&quot; was founded in May 1946.

In the first post-war state elections in 1946, liberal parties performed well in Württemberg-Baden (16.8%), Bremen (18.3%), Hamburg (18.2%) and Greater Berlin (still undivided; 9.3%). The LDP was especially strong in the October 1946 state elections of the Soviet zone—the last free parliamentary election in East Germany—obtaining an average of 24.6% (highest in Saxony-Anhalt, 29.9%, and Thuringia, 28.5%), thwarting an absolute majority of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED) that was favoured by the Soviet occupation power. This disappointment to the communists however led to a change of electoral laws in the Soviet zone, cutting the autonomy of non-socialist parties including the LDP and forcing it to join the SED-dominated National Front, making it a dependent &quot;bloc party&quot;.

The Democratic Party of Germany (DPD) was established in Rothenburg ob der Tauber on 17 March 1947 as a pan-German party of liberals from all four occupation zones. Its leaders were Theodor Heuss (representing the DVP of Württemberg-Baden in the American zone) and Wilhelm Külz (representing the LDP of the Soviet zone). However, the project failed in January 1948 as a result of disputes over Külz&#x27;s pro-Soviet direction.

=== Founding of the party ===
The Free Democratic Party was established on 11–12 December 1948 in Heppenheim, in Hesse, as an association of all 13 liberal state parties in the three Western zones of occupation. As such, the party included former members of the pre-1933 German People&#x27;s Party (DVP) which represented the more conservative and national tradition of German liberalism and members from the social liberal German Democratic Party (DDP). The proposed name, Liberal Democratic Party, was rejected by the delegates, who voted 64 to 25 in favour of the name Free Democratic Party (FDP).

The party&#x27;s first chairman was Theodor Heuss, a member of the Democratic People&#x27;s Party in Württemberg-Baden; his deputy was Franz Blücher of the FDP in the British Zone. The place for the party&#x27;s foundation was chosen deliberately: the &quot;Heppenheim Assembly&quot; was held at the Hotel &quot;Halber Mond&quot; on 10 October 1847, a meeting of moderate liberals who were preparing for what would be, within a few months, the German revolutions of 1848–1849.

=== 1949–1969: reconstruction of Germany ===
In the first elections to the Bundestag on 14 August 1949, the FDP won a vote share of 11.9 percent (with 12 direct mandates, particularly in Baden-Württemberg and Hesse), and thus obtained 52 of 402 seats. In September of the same year the FDP chairman Theodor Heuss was elected the first President of the Federal Republic of Germany. In his 1954 re-election, he received the best election result to date of a President with 871 of 1018 votes (85.6 percent) of the Federal Assembly. Adenauer was also elected on the proposal of the new German President with an extremely narrow majority as the first Chancellor. The FDP participated with the CDU/CSU and the national-conservative German Party (DP) in Adenauer&#x27;s coalition cabinet; they had three ministers: Franz Blücher (Vice-Chancellor), Thomas Dehler (justice), and Eberhard Wildermuth (housing).

On the most important economic, social and German national issues, the FDP agreed with their coalition partners, the CDU/CSU. However, the FDP offered to middle-class voters a secular party that refused the religious schools and accused the opposition parties of clericalization. The FDP said they were known also as a consistent representative of the market economy, while the CDU was then dominated nominally from the Ahlen Programme, which allowed a Third Way between capitalism and socialism. Ludwig Erhard, the &quot;father&quot; of the social market economy, had his followers in the early years of the Federal Republic in the CDU/CSU rather than in the FDP. The FDP won Hesse&#x27;s 1950 state election with 31.8 percent, the best result in its history, through appealing to East Germans displaced by the war by including them on their ticket.

Up to the 1950s, several of the FDP&#x27;s regional organizations were to the right of the CDU/CSU, particularly the Hesse, Lower Saxony and North Rhine-Westphalia branches where Friedrich Middelhauve tried to foster a „National Rally&quot; as a third bloc next to Social Democrats and Christian Democrats. This was criticized by the social liberals around Theodor Heuss who distanced himself from the &quot;Nazi FDP&quot; branches. Under the influence of the party&#x27;s right wing, the Free Democrats campaigned against West Germany&#x27;s denazification provisions and courted even former office-holders of the Third Reich with nationalist values. At their party conference in Munich in 1951 they demanded the release of all &quot;so-called war criminals&quot; and welcomed the establishment of the &quot;Association of German soldiers&quot; of former Wehrmacht and SS members to advance the integration of the Nazi forces in democracy. The FDP members were seen as part of the &quot;extremist&quot; block along with the German Party in West Germany by the US intelligence officials. The 1953 Naumann Circle, named after Werner Naumann, consisted of a group of former Nazis who tried to infiltrate the party. After the British occupation authorities had arrested seven prominent members of the Naumann Circle, the FDP federal board installed a commission of inquiry, chaired by Thomas Dehler, which particularly sharply criticized the situation in the North Rhine-Westphalian FDP. In the following years, the right wing lost power, and the extreme right increasingly sought areas of activity outside the FDP. In the 1953 federal election, the FDP received 9.5 percent of the party votes, 10.8 percent of the primary vote (with 14 direct mandates, particularly in Hamburg, Lower Saxony, Hesse, Württemberg and Bavaria) and 48 of 487 seats.

In the second term of the Bundestag, the South German Liberal Democrats gained influence in the party controlling the party leadership between 1954 and 1960. Thomas Dehler, a representative of a more social-liberal course from Bavaria took over as party and parliamentary leader. The former Minister of Justice Dehler, who in 1933 suffered persecution by the Nazis, was known for his populist rhetorics and tried to emancipate the party from Adenauer&#x27;s CDU/CSU. In the mid-1950s, there were some disagreements between Dehler and Adenauer over foreign policy issues, particularly the founding of the European Defence Community and the Saar statute. The FDP took an emphatically nationalist stance on both issues. In 1956, the infights between Dehler and Adenauer culminated in a government crisis: The FDP in North Rhine-Westphalia terminated their alliance with the Christian Democrats and formed a new state government with the Social Democratic Party of Germany and the German Center Party which led to a party split. 16 members of parliament, including former party leader Franz Blücher and the four federal ministers from the FDP left their party and founded the short-lived Free People&#x27;s Party (FVP). Whilst the FVP continued the government coalition with Adenauer&#x27;s CDU/CSU and merged with the right-wing German Party (DP) in 1957, the FDP took it to the opposition for the first time in its history.

Only one of the smaller post-war parties, the FDP survived despite many problems. In the 1957 federal elections they still reached 7.7 percent of the vote and held 41 of 497 seats in the Bundestag. However, they still remained in opposition because the Union won an absolute majority. At the federal party meeting in Berlin at the end of January 1957, Thomas Dehler was replaced as party chairman by another liberal democrat from South Germany, Reinhold Maier, who was able to stabilize his party before he made way for Erich Mende from North Rhine-Westphalia in 1960. With Mende as party leader the FDP went into the 1961 federal election with the promise of ending Konrad Adenauer&#x27;s leadership and gained 12.8 percent nationwide, the best result until then. After the election, however, the FDP again formed a coalition with Adenauer&#x27;s CDU on the condition that he would retire as chancellor after two years. These events led to the FDP being nicknamed the (&quot;pushover party&quot;). In the 1962 Spiegel affair, the FDP temporarily withdrew their ministers from the federal government forcing Defence Minister Franz-Josef Strauß to resign. In accordance with his agreement with the FDP, Adenauer resigned from his chancellorship in October 1963, making place for Ludwig Erhard who appointed FDP leader Erich Mende as Vice Chancellor and Minister of All-German Affairs. 

In the 1965 federal elections the FDP gained 9.5 percent. The Free Democrats initially renewed their alliance with the CDU under Erhard but the coalition broke up in 1966 on the issue of tax increases. During the 1966-1969 Grand coalition the party led the opposition. Under their new chairman, Walter Scheel, there were signs of a change both in foreign policy and in party strategy: For the first time, the FDP opened up to a coalition with the SPD on a federal level, embracing foreign minister Willy Brandt&#x27;s Ostpolitik. 

=== 1969–1982: social changes and crises ===


The 1969 West German federal election led to the first social-liberal coalition between Social Democrats and Free Democrats in German post-war history. Even though the Christian Democrats won the election, the Free Democrats rejected a new centre-right alliance and opted for a centre-left coalition under the new Chancellor Willy Brandt. With FDP leader Walter Scheel as Vice Chancellor and Foreign Minister, the liberals initiated a new controversial Ostpolitik effectively normalizing relations between capitalist-democratic West Germany and communist-led East Germany. Within the FDP, this policy was quite controversial, especially after the &quot;de facto&quot; recognition of the Oder-Neisse line by the 1970 Treaty of Warsaw.

In July 1970, right-wing members founded a &quot;non-partisan&quot; organization called the National-Liberal Action with the goal of breaking up the SPD/FDP coalition government. A little later, members of parliament Siegfried Zoglmann, Heinz Starke and former party leader Erich Mende left the party with Starke and Mende joining the CDU and Zoglmann founding a new splinter party called German Union &quot;(Deutsche Union)&quot;. This led to the 1972 snap elections from which the SPD/FDP government emerged even stronger. In 1974, party leader Walter Scheel was the second Liberal to be elected Federal President after Theodor Heuss. He was succeeded by Interior Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher as the new FDP leader and Foreign Minister who continued the centre-left coalition under new SPD Chancellor Helmut Schmidt. 

The party&#x27;s centre-left strategy was supported by a new party manifesto, the 1971 Freiburg Theses (&quot;Freiburger Thesen&quot;) which set the party on a progressive and social liberal course. Among other things, the party committed itself to &quot;self-determination&quot;, &quot;democratization of society&quot;, a &quot;reform of capitalism&quot; and a form of ecoliberalism which prioritized &quot;environmental protection over profit and personal gains&quot;. However, in 1977, the progressive liberal Freiburg Theses were supplemented and partially revised by the more economically liberal Kiel Theses (&quot;Kieler Thesen&quot;), effectively setting the party back on a classical liberal course. 

Even prior to the 1980 West German federal election, cooperation between Social Democrats and Free Democrats seemed to come to an end but the candidacy of CSU chairman Franz Josef Strauss for chancellor led both parties to once again renew their coalition government. 

=== 1982–1998: Kohl government, economic transition and reunification ===
In the fall of 1982, the FDP reneged on its coalition agreement with the SPD and instead threw its support behind the CDU/CSU. On 1 October, the FDP and CDU/CSU were able to oust Schmidt and replace him with CDU party chairman Helmut Kohl as the new Chancellor. The coalition change resulted in severe internal conflicts, and the FDP then lost about 20 percent of its 86,500 members, as reflected in the general election in 1983 by a drop from 10.6 percent to 7.0 percent. The members went mostly to the SPD, the Greens and newly formed splinter parties, such as the left-liberal party Liberal Democrats (LD). The exiting members included the former FDP General Secretary and later EU Commissioner Günter Verheugen. 

At the party convention in November 1982, the Schleswig-Holstein state chairman Uwe Ronneburger challenged Hans-Dietrich Genscher as party chairman. Ronneburger received 186 of the votes—about 40 percent—and was just narrowly defeated by Genscher who went on to act as party chairman as well as Vice Chancellor and Foreign Minister in the new Kohl government. In the following federal election campaigns during the 1980s and 1990s, the party sided with the CDU and CSU, the main conservative parties in Germany. 

in 1980, FDP members who did not agree with the politics of the left-leaning FDP youth organization Young Democrats founded the Young Liberals (JuLis). For a time JuLis and the Young Democrats operated side by side, until the JuLis became the sole official youth wing of the FDP in 1983. The Young Democrats split from the FDP and were left as a party-independent youth organization ultimately merging with a marxist youth group to form the &quot;Young Democrats/Young Left&quot; in 1992.

During the &quot;Peaceful Revolution&quot; of 1989 in the GDR, a couple of new liberal parties emerged from the opposition, like the Free Democratic Party (East Germany) or the German Forum Party. Prior to the March 1990 Volkskammer elections they joined the established Liberal Democratic Party, who had previously acted as a pro-communist bloc party on the side of the SED, to form the Alliance of Free Democrats (BFD). In the Volkskammer election of March 1990 the Association of Free Democrats was heavily supported by the West German FDP and polled 5.28% of the votes. Most of the seats went to Liberal Democratic Party members, whose leader Rainer Ortleb became their parliamentary leader. It then participated in the last GDR government led by Lothar de Maizière. After the Liberal Democratic Party and another former bloc party, the National Democratic Party of Germany, merged into the new party &quot;Association of Free Democrats&quot; in late March, the several liberal parties all united with the West German FDP in August 1990 to form the first all-German party. The merger brought the Free Democrats a great, albeit short-lived, increase in membership and assets of DM 6.3 million in cash and property.

At the time of reunification, the FDP&#x27;s objective was a special economic zone in the former East Germany, but the party could not prevail against the CDU/CSU. In the first all-German Bundestag elections, the centre-right Kohl coalition was confirmed, the FDP received 11.0 percent of the valid votes (79 seats) and won in Genscher&#x27;s city of birth Halle (Saale) the first direct mandate since 1957. During the 1990s, the FDP won between 6.2 and 11 percent of the vote in Bundestag elections. 

In the second half of the 1990s, however, the FDP had to contend with a series of electoral defeats at local and state level, which led to it falling out of twelve of the 16 state parliaments and the European Parliament between 1993 and 1995. The party was derisively referred to as the ‘lady without an abdomen’. At the same time, the party was shaken by new infights between the left and right wings. In 1996, Federal Minister of Justice Sabine Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger, a prominent representative of the party&#x27;s social liberal wing, resigned in protest to the government&#x27;s policy of expanding the state&#x27;s right to interfere in citizens&#x27; private domain by means of acoustic observation &quot;(Großer Lauschangriff&quot;, literally &quot;big eavesdropping attack&quot;). On the other hand, former Public Prosecutor General Alexander von Stahl tried to rebuild the party&#x27;s national liberal wing in an ultimately failed attempt to bring the FDP onto a right-wing course modelled on Jörg Haider&#x27;s FPÖ in Austria.

These infights contributed to the CDU/CSU-FDP defeat in the 1998 German federal election which ended the 16-year centre-right coalition in Germany and the FDP&#x27;s nearly three decade reign in government. For the first time since 1969 (apart from a brief period in 1982), the Free Democrats now found themselves in opposition and out of power on a federal level. 

=== 2002 and 2005 federal elections ===
Following their electoral defeat, the party developed a strategy of equidistance to the CDU and SPD championed by North Rhine-Westfalia state party leader Jürgen Möllemann who led the party to a good result in the 2000 state elections. At their 2001 party conference in Düsseldorf, outgoing party leader Wolfgang Gerhardt was replaced by a 39 year old Guido Westerwelle who became the youngest FDP leader in history. The party conference also adopted a strategy developed by Möllemann which became known as ‘Project 18’. It aimed at winning new groups of voters through new forms of communication and presentation and at profiling the party as an independent force autonomous from SPD and CDU. The name referred to the electoral goal of tripling the party&#x27;s share of the vote from 6% to 18%. While Westerwelle and Möllemann generated a lot of media attention, the party was once again embroiled in controversy on Westerwelle&#x27;s perceived lack of seriousness in his election campaign (&quot;Spaßwahlkampf&quot;) and on Möllemann&#x27;s alleged right-wing populism. Many critics interpreted the use of the number 18 as a hidden right-wing extremist symbol (a code for the letters A and H, meaning Adolf Hitler) and an attempt to attract voters on the far right. In addition, Möllemann launched a leaflet campaign with harsh criticism of the Israeli government under Ariel Sharon and the German-Jewish journalist Michel Friedman, which critics interpreted as anti-Semitism. Amid controversy over a possible right-wing populist orientation associated with this, the FDP ultimately achieved 7.4% instead of the targeted 18 per cent in the 2002 German federal election.
In the 2005 general election the party won 9.8 percent of the vote and 61 federal deputies, an unpredicted improvement from prior opinion polls. It is believed that this was partly due to tactical voting by CDU and Christian Social Union of Bavaria (CSU) alliance supporters who hoped for stronger market-oriented economic reforms than the CDU/CSU alliance called for. However, because the CDU did worse than predicted, the FDP and the CDU/CSU alliance were unable to form a coalition government. At other times, for example after the 2002 federal election, a coalition between the FDP and CDU/CSU was impossible primarily because of the weak results of the FDP.

The CDU/CSU parties had achieved the third-worst performance in German postwar history with only 35.2 percent of the votes. Therefore, the FDP was unable to form a coalition with its preferred partners, the CDU/CSU parties. As a result, the party was considered as a potential member of two other political coalitions, following the election. One possibility was a partnership between the FDP, the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) and the Alliance 90/The Greens, known as a &quot;traffic light coalition&quot;, named after the colors of the three parties. This coalition was ruled out, because the FDP considered the Social Democrats and the Greens insufficiently committed to market-oriented economic reform. The other possibility was a CDU-FDP-Green coalition, known as a &quot;Jamaica coalition&quot; because of the colours of the three parties. This coalition wasn&#x27;t concluded either, since the Greens ruled out participation in any coalition with the CDU/CSU. Instead, the CDU formed a Grand coalition with the SPD, and the FDP entered the opposition. FDP leader Guido Westerwelle became the unofficial leader of the opposition by virtue of the FDP&#x27;s position as the largest opposition party in the Bundestag.

In the 2009 European election, the FDP received 11% of the national vote (2,888,084 votes in total) and returned 12 MEPs.

=== 2009–2013: Merkel II government ===
In the September 2009 federal elections, the FDP increased its share of the vote by 4.8 percentage points to 14.6%, an all-time record. This percentage was enough to offset a decline in the CDU/CSU&#x27;s vote compared to 2005, to create a CDU-FDP centre-right governing coalition in the Bundestag with a 53% majority of seats. On election night, party leader Westerwelle said his party would work to ensure that civil liberties were respected and that Germany got an &quot;equitable tax system and better education opportunities&quot;.

The party also made gains in the two state elections held at the same time, acquiring sufficient seats for a CDU-FDP coalition in the northernmost state, Schleswig-Holstein, and gaining enough votes in left-leaning Brandenburg to clear the 5% hurdle to enter that state&#x27;s parliament.

However, after reaching its best ever election result in 2009, the FDP&#x27;s support collapsed. The party&#x27;s policy pledges were put on hold by Merkel as the Great Recession unfolded and with the onset of the European debt crisis in 2010. By the end of 2010, the party&#x27;s support had dropped to as low as 5%. The FDP retained their seats in the state elections in North Rhine-Westphalia, which was held six months after the federal election, but out of the seven state elections that have been held since 2009, the FDP have lost all their seats in five of them due to failing to cross the 5% threshold.

Support for the party further eroded amid infighting and an internal rebellion over euro-area bailouts during the debt crisis.

Westerwelle stepped down as party leader following the 2011 state elections, in which the party was wiped out in Saxony-Anhalt and Rhineland-Palatinate and lost half its seats in Baden-Württemberg. Westerwelle was replaced in May 2011 by Philipp Rösler. Rösler was the first cabinet minister and vice-chancellor of Asian background in Germany. Rösler was the first cabinet minister and vice-chancellor of Asian background in Germany. The change in leadership failed to revive the FDP&#x27;s fortunes, however, and in the next series of state elections, the party lost all its seats in Bremen, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, and Berlin. In Berlin, the party lost nearly 75% of the support they had had in the previous election.

In March 2012, the FDP lost all their state-level representation in the 2012 Saarland state election. However, this was offset by the Schleswig-Holstein state elections, when they achieved 8% of the vote, which was a severe loss of seats but still over the 5% threshold. In the snap elections in North Rhine-Westphalia a week later, the FDP not only crossed the electoral threshold, but also increased its share of the votes to 2 percentage points higher than in the previous state election. This was attributed to the local leadership of Christian Lindner.

=== 2013 federal election ===
The FDP last won a directly elected seat in 1990, in Halle—the only time it has won a directly elected seat since 1957. The party&#x27;s inability to win directly elected seats came back to haunt it at the 2013 election, in which it came up just short of the 5% threshold. With no directly elected seats, the FDP was shut out of the Bundestag for the first time since 1949. After the previous chairman Philipp Rösler then resigned, Christian Lindner took over the leadership of the party.

=== 2014 European and state elections ===
In the 2014 European parliament elections, the FDP received 3.4% of the national vote (986,253 votes in total) and returned 3 MEPs. In the 2014 Brandenburg state election the party experienced a 5.8% down-swing and lost all their representatives in the Brandenburg state parliament. In the 2014 Saxony state election, the party experienced a 5.2% down-swing, again losing all of its seats. In the 2014 Thuringian state election a similar phenomenon was repeated with the party falling below the 5% threshold following a 5.1% drop in popular vote.

=== 2015–2020 ===
The party managed to enter parliament in the 2015 Bremen state election with the party receiving 6.5% of the vote and gaining 6 seats. However, it failed to get into government as a coalition between the Social Democrats and the Greens was created. In the 2016 Mecklenburg-Vorpommern state election the party failed to get into parliament despite increasing its vote share by 0.3%. The party did manage to get into parliament in Baden-Württemberg, gaining 3% of the vote and a total of 12 seats. This represents a five-seat improvement over their previous results. In the 2016 Berlin state election the party gained 4.9% of the vote and 12 seats but still failed to get into government. A red-red-green coalition was instead formed relegating the FDP to the opposition. In the 2016 Rhineland-Palatinate state election, the party managed to enter parliament receiving 6.2% of the vote and 7 seats. It also managed to enter government under a traffic light coalition. In 2016 Saxony-Anhalt state election the party narrowly missed the 5% threshold, receiving 4.9% of the vote and therefore receiving zero seats despite a 1% swing in their favour.

The 2017 North Rhine-Westphalia state election was widely considered a test of the party&#x27;s future as their chairman Christian Lindner was also leading the party in that state. The party experienced a 4% swing in its favour gaining 6 seats and entering into a coalition with the CDU with a bare majority. In the 2017 Saarland state election the party again failed to gain any seats despite a 1% swing in their favour. The party gained 3 seats and increased its vote share by 3.2% in the 2017 Schleswig-Holstein state election. This success was often credited to their state chairman Wolfgang Kubicki. They also managed to re-enter the government under a Jamaica coalition.

In the 2017 federal election the party scored 10.7% of votes and re-entered the Bundestag, winning 80 seats. After the election, a Jamaica coalition was considered between the CDU, Greens, and FDP. However, FDP chief Christian Lindner walked out of the coalition talks due to a disagreement over European migration policy, saying &quot;It is better not to govern than to govern badly.&quot; As a result, the CDU/CSU formed another grand coalition with the SPD.

The FDP won 5.4% and 5 seats in the 2019 European election.

In the October 2019 Thuringian state election, the FDP won seats in the Landtag of Thuringia for the first time since 2009. It exceeded the 5% threshold by just 5 votes. In February 2020, the FDP&#x27;s Thomas Kemmerich was elected Minister-President of Thuringia by the Landtag with the likely support of the CDU and AfD, becoming the second member of the FDP to serve as head of government in a German state. This was also the first time a head of government had been elected with the support of AfD. Under intense pressure from state and federal politicians, Kemmerich resigned the following day, stating he would seek new elections. The next month, he was replaced by Bodo Ramelow of The Left; the FDP did not run a candidate in the second vote for Minister-President.

=== 2021–present ===
In 2021, the FDP returned to the Saxony-Anhalt state parliament after five years of absence. They had similar success in Baden-Württemberg and Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, but faced setbacks in Baden-Württemberg, Berlin and Rhineland-Palatinate.

In the September 2021 federal election, the CDU/CSU under Armin Laschet was defeated. The FDP saw both its vote share and number of seats grow, to 11.5% and 92 seats respectively. As a result, the SPD, Greens, and FDP entered talks to form an &quot;Ampelkoalition&quot; (traffic light coalition). In the agreement finalised on 24 November, the FDP held four federal ministries in the Scholz cabinet (Finance, Justice, Digital and Transport and Education and Research).

Throughout 2022, the FDP saw poor approval in national opinion polls. In State Parliament elections they also performed poorly. In March, the FDP didn&#x27;t win any seats in Saarland. In May they lost over half their seats in North Rhine-Westphalia and Schleswig-Holstein. In October, the FDP lost all 11 of their seats in Lower Saxony. It also lost all 12 seats in the 2023 Berlin repeat state election. 

In the 2023 Bavarian state election, where Martin Hagen led the party, all 11 seats were lost. In the 2024 European Parliament elections, the FDP narrowly surpassed the 5% threshold, remaining on 5 seats and coming in sixth, behind the newly formed BSW. The FDP were similarly wiped out in the 2024 Thuringian state election, where Thomas Kemmerich lost his party&#x27;s 5 seats. In the 2024 Saxony state election, the FDP achieved less than 1% of the vote.

In November 2024, Christian Lindner was fired as Minister of Finance. The FDP leaving the coalition meant the collapse of the traffic light government. Marco Buschmann and Bettina Stark-Watzinger also resigned from the cabinet. Justice minister Volker Wissing decided to resign from the FDP in order to stay in cabinet.

In the subsequent snap election, FDP failed to reach the 5% threshold needed for parliamentary representation and as a result lost all their seats in Bundestag again. Christian Lindner and Wolfgang Kubicki would resign from party leadership.

== Ideology and platform ==


The FDP&#x27;s political position has variously been described as centrist, centre-right, and right-wing. The FDP has been described as liberal, conservative-liberal, classical-liberal, and liberal-conservative. Other sources have described the party as fiscally conservative, libertarian or right-libertarian.

The FDP is a predominantly classical-liberal inspired party, both in the sense of supporting free market economic policies and in the sense of policies emphasizing the minimization of government interference in individual affairs. During election campaigning, the party has emphasised support for tax cuts, reductions in government spending and balanced budgets. The party has also been described by various media sources as neoliberal. Scholars of political science have historically identified the FDP as closer to the CDU/CSU bloc than to the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) on economic issues but closer to the SPD and the Greens on issues such as civil liberties, education, defense, and foreign policy. The FDP has oriented itself towards a centrist position between the CDU and the SPD, however it is to the right of the CDU in its socioeconomics perspective, environmental and labour policies.

The party is a traditional supporter of ordoliberalism, having been influenced by the economic theories of Wilhelm Röpke and Alexander Rüstow. Otto Graf Lambsdorff, who served as Federal Minister of Economics, is a historical FDP grandee who was a proponent of ordoliberalism. In 1971 during its federal social-liberal coalition with the SPD, the FDP published the Freiburger Thesis programme, heralding an ideological move towards reformism and social liberalism, and support for environmental protection. However, the party&#x27;s 1977 Kiel Theses and 1985 Liberal Manifesto returned the FDP towards its traditional free-market, ordoliberal approach. Historical members of the party&#x27;s social-liberal wing included Gerhart Baum and Werner Maihofer, a faction who remained organised as the Freiberg Circle. Alternatively to the liberal-orientated wings of the party are a conservative or national-conservative wing, influenced by the populist and nationalist developments of the Freedom Party of Austria and the New Right. The FDP&#x27;s national-conservative wing has included individuals such as Rainer Zitelmann, Klaus Rainer Röhl, Alexander von Stahl, and Jürgen Möllemann, and was organised as the Liberal Offensive. Möllemann in the particular was noted for his role during the 2002 federal election in attempting to push the party in a right-wing populist direction, albeit to poor electoral results. 

During the 2017 federal election, the party called for Germany to adopt an immigration channel using a Canada-style points-based immigration system; spend up to 3% of GDP on defense and international security; phase out the solidarity surcharge tax (which was first levied in 1991 to pay for the costs of absorbing East Germany after German reunification); cut taxes by 30 billion euro (twice the amount of the tax cut proposed by the CDU); and improve road infrastructure by spending 2 billion euro annually for each of the next two decades, to be funded by selling government stakes in Deutsche Bahn, Deutsche Telekom, and Deutsche Post. The FDP also called for the improvement of Germany&#x27;s digital infrastructure, the establishment of a Ministry of Digital Affairs, and greater investment in education. The party also supports allowing dual citizenship (in contrast to the CDU/CSU, which opposes it) but also supports requiring third-generation immigrants to select a single nationality.

The FDP supports the legalization of cannabis in Germany and opposes proposals to heighten Internet surveillance. The FDP supports same-sex marriage in Germany. The FDP supports legalisation of altruistic surrogacy.

The FDP has mixed views on European integration. In its 2009 campaign manifesto, the FDP pledged support for ratification of the Lisbon Treaty as well as EU reforms aimed at enhancing transparency and democratic responsiveness, reducing bureaucracy, establishing stringent curbs on the EU budget, and fully liberalizing the Single Market. At its January 2019 congress ahead of the 2019 European Parliament election, FDP&#x27;s manifesto called for further EU reforms, including reducing the number of European Commissioners to 18 from the current 28, abolishing the European Economic and Social Committee, and ending the European Parliament&#x27;s &quot;traveling circus&quot; between Brussels and Strasbourg. Vice chairwoman and Deputy Leader Nicola Beer stated: &quot;We want both more and less Europe.&quot;

== Electorate ==

In 1940s and 1950s, the FDP was the only German party strongly in favour of market economy, while the CDU/CSU was still adhering to a &quot;third way&quot; between capitalism and socialism. Initially founded as a party uniting liberals and nationalists, the early FDP wanted former Nazis to be reintegrated into society and demanded a release of Nazi war criminals.

The party&#x27;s membership has historically been largely male; in 1995, less than one-third of the party&#x27;s members were women, and in the 1980s women made up less than one-tenth of the party&#x27;s national executive committee. By the 1990s, the percentage of women on the FDP&#x27;s national executive committee rose to 20%.

The party tends to draw its support from professionals and self-employed Germans. It lacks consistent support from a voting bloc, such as the trade union membership that supports the SPD or the church membership that supports the CDU/CSU, and thus has historically only garnered a small group of &quot;Stammwähler&quot; (core voters) who consistently vote for the party.

In the 2021 elections, the FDP was the second-most popular party among voters under age 30; among this demographic, the Greens won 22% of the vote, the FDP 19%, the SPD 17%, the CDU/CSU 11%, Die Linke 8%, and the AfD 8%. According to Deutsche Welle in 2021, voters for both the FDP and the Greens are similar in being younger, politically centrist professionals living in cities, unlike left working-class voters and right Christian voters.

== European representation ==
In the European Parliament the Free Democratic Party sits in the Renew Europe group with five MEPs.

In the European Committee of the Regions, the Free Democratic Party sits in the Renew Europe CoR group, with one full member for the 2020–2025 mandate.

<text>Fax (short for facsimile), sometimes called telecopying or telefax (short for telefacsimile), is the telephonic transmission of scanned printed material (both text and images), normally to a telephone number connected to a printer or other output device. The original document is scanned with a fax machine (or a telecopier), which processes the contents (text or images) as a single fixed graphic image, converting it into a bitmap, and then transmitting it through the telephone system in the form of audio-frequency tones. The receiving fax machine interprets the tones and reconstructs the image, printing a paper copy. Early systems used direct conversions of image darkness to audio tone in a continuous or analog manner. Since the 1980s, most machines transmit an audio-encoded digital representation of the page, using data compression to transmit areas that are all-white or all-black, more quickly. 

Initially a niche product, fax machines became ubiquitous in offices in the 1980s and 1990s. However, they have largely been rendered obsolete by Internet-based technologies such as email and the World Wide Web, but are still used in some medical administration and law enforcement settings.

== History ==
=== Wire transmission ===
Scottish inventor Alexander Bain worked on chemical-mechanical fax-type devices and in 1846 Bain was able to reproduce graphic signs in laboratory experiments. He received British patent 9745 on May 27, 1843, for his &quot;Electric Printing Telegraph&quot;. Frederick Bakewell made several improvements on Bain&#x27;s design and demonstrated a telefax machine. The Pantelegraph was invented by the Italian physicist Giovanni Caselli. He introduced the first commercial telefax service between Paris and Lyon in 1865, some 11 years before the invention of the telephone.

In 1880, English inventor Shelford Bidwell constructed the &quot;scanning phototelegraph&quot; that was the first telefax machine to scan any two-dimensional original, not requiring manual plotting or drawing. An account of Henry Sutton&#x27;s &quot;telephane&quot; was published in 1896. Around 1900, German physicist Arthur Korn invented the &quot;Bildtelegraph&quot;, widespread in continental Europe especially following a widely noticed transmission of a wanted-person photograph from Paris to London in 1908, used until the wider distribution of the radiofax. Its main competitors were the &quot;Bélinographe&quot; by Édouard Belin first, then since the 1930s the &quot;Hellschreiber&quot;, invented in 1929 by German inventor Rudolf Hell, a pioneer in mechanical image scanning and transmission.
The 1888 invention of the telautograph by Elisha Gray marked a further development in fax technology, allowing users to send signatures over long distances, thus allowing the verification of identification or ownership over long distances.

On May 19, 1924, scientists of the AT&amp;T Corporation &quot;by a new process of transmitting pictures by electricity&quot; sent 15 photographs by telephone from Cleveland to New York City, such photos being suitable for newspaper reproduction. Previously, photographs had been sent over the radio using this process.

The Western Union &quot;Deskfax&quot; fax machine, announced in 1948, was a compact machine that fit comfortably on a desktop, using special spark printer paper.

=== Wireless transmission ===
As a designer for the Radio Corporation of America (RCA), in 1924, Richard H. Ranger invented the wireless photoradiogram, or transoceanic radio facsimile, the forerunner of today&#x27;s &quot;fax&quot; machines. A photograph of President Calvin Coolidge sent from New York to London on November 29, 1924, became the first photo picture reproduced by transoceanic radio facsimile. Commercial use of Ranger&#x27;s product began two years later. Also in 1924, Herbert E. Ives of AT&amp;T transmitted and reconstructed the first color facsimile, a natural-color photograph of silent film star Rudolph Valentino in period costume, using red, green and blue color separations.

Beginning in the late 1930s, the Finch Facsimile system was used to transmit a &quot;radio newspaper&quot; to private homes via commercial AM radio stations and ordinary radio receivers equipped with Finch&#x27;s printer, which used thermal paper. Sensing a new and potentially golden opportunity, competitors soon entered the field, but the printer and special paper were expensive luxuries, AM radio transmission was very slow and vulnerable to static, and the newspaper was too small. After more than ten years of repeated attempts by Finch and others to establish such a service as a viable business, the public, apparently quite content with its cheaper and much more substantial home-delivered daily newspapers, and with conventional spoken radio bulletins to provide any &quot;hot&quot; news, still showed only a passing curiosity about the new medium.

By the late 1940s, radiofax receivers were sufficiently miniaturized to be fitted beneath the dashboard of Western Union&#x27;s &quot;Telecar&quot; telegram delivery vehicles.

In the 1960s, the United States Army transmitted the first photograph via satellite facsimile to Puerto Rico from the Deal Test Site using the Courier satellite.

Radio fax is still in limited use today for transmitting weather charts and information to ships at sea. The closely related technology of slow-scan television is still used by amateur radio operators.

=== Telephone transmission ===
In 1964, Xerox Corporation introduced (and patented) what many consider to be the first commercialized version of the modern fax machine, under the name (LDX) or Long Distance Xerography. This model was superseded two years later with a unit that would set the standard for fax machines for years to come. Up until this point facsimile machines were very expensive and hard to operate. In 1966, Xerox released the Magnafax Telecopiers, a smaller, facsimile machine. This unit was far easier to operate and could be connected to any standard telephone line. This machine was capable of transmitting a letter-sized document in about six minutes. The first sub-minute, digital fax machine was developed by Dacom, which built on digital data compression technology originally developed at Lockheed for satellite communication.

By the late 1970s, many companies around the world (especially Japanese firms) had entered the fax market. Very shortly after this, a new wave of more compact, faster and efficient fax machines would hit the market. Xerox continued to refine the fax machine for years after their ground-breaking first machine. In later years it would be combined with copier equipment to create the hybrid machines we have today that copy, scan and fax. Some of the lesser known capabilities of the Xerox fax technologies included their Ethernet enabled Fax Services on their 8000 workstations in the early 1980s.

Prior to the introduction of the ubiquitous fax machine, one of the first being the Exxon Qwip in the mid-1970s, facsimile machines worked by optical scanning of a document or drawing spinning on a drum. The reflected light, varying in intensity according to the light and dark areas of the document, was focused on a photocell so that the current in a circuit varied with the amount of light. This current was used to control a tone generator (a modulator), the current determining the frequency of the tone produced. This audio tone was then transmitted using an acoustic coupler (a speaker, in this case) attached to the microphone of a common telephone handset. At the receiving end, a handset&#x27;s speaker was attached to an acoustic coupler (a microphone), and a demodulator converted the varying tone into a variable current that controlled the mechanical movement of a pen or pencil to reproduce the image on a blank sheet of paper on an identical drum rotating at the same rate.

=== Computer facsimile interface ===
In 1985, Hank Magnuski, founder of GammaLink, produced the first computer fax board, called GammaFax. Such boards could provide voice telephony via Analog Expansion Bus.

===In the 21st century===

Although businesses usually maintain some kind of fax capability, the technology has faced increasing competition from Internet-based alternatives. In some countries, such as Germany, because electronic signatures on contracts are not yet recognized by law, while faxed contracts with copies of signatures are, fax machines enjoy continuing support in business. In Japan, faxes are still used extensively as of September 2020 for cultural and They are available for sending to both domestic and international recipients from over 81% of all convenience stores nationwide. Convenience-store fax machines commonly print the slightly re-sized content of the sent fax in the electronic confirmation-slip, in A4 paper size. Use of fax machines for reporting cases during the COVID-19 pandemic has been criticised in Japan for introducing data errors and delays in reporting, slowing response efforts to contain the spread of infections and hindering the transition to remote work.

In many corporate environments, freestanding fax machines have been replaced by fax servers and other computerized systems capable of receiving and storing incoming faxes electronically, and then routing them to users on paper or via an email (which may be secured). Such systems have the advantage of reducing costs by eliminating unnecessary printouts and reducing the number of inbound analog phone lines needed by an office.

The once ubiquitous fax machine has also begun to disappear from the small office and home office environments. Remotely hosted fax-server services are widely available from VoIP and e-mail providers allowing users to send and receive faxes using their existing e-mail accounts without the need for any hardware or dedicated fax lines. Personal computers have also long been able to handle incoming and outgoing faxes using analog modems or ISDN, eliminating the need for a stand-alone fax machine. These solutions are often ideally suited for users who only very occasionally need to use fax services. In July 2017 the United Kingdom&#x27;s National Health Service was said to be the world&#x27;s largest purchaser of fax machines because the digital revolution has largely bypassed it. In June 2018 the Labour Party said that the NHS had at least 11,620 fax machines in operation and in December the Department of Health and Social Care said that no more fax machines could be bought from 2019 and that the existing ones must be replaced by secure email by March 31, 2020.

Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust, generally viewed as digitally advanced in the NHS, was engaged in a process of removing its fax machines in early 2019. This involved quite a lot of e-fax solutions because of the need to communicate with pharmacies and nursing homes which may not have access to the NHS email system and may need something in their paper records.

In 2018 two-thirds of Canadian doctors reported that they primarily used fax machines to communicate with other doctors. Faxes are still seen as safer and more secure and electronic systems are often unable to communicate with each other.

Hospitals are the leading users for fax machines in the United States where some doctors prefer fax machines over emails, often due to concerns about accidentally violating HIPAA.

== Capabilities ==
There are several indicators of fax capabilities: group, class, data transmission rate, and conformance with ITU-T (formerly CCITT) recommendations. Since the 1968 Carterfone decision, most fax machines have been designed to connect to standard PSTN lines and telephone numbers.

=== Group ===

==== Analog ====
Group 1 and 2 faxes are sent in the same manner as a frame of analog television, with each scanned line transmitted as a continuous analog signal. Horizontal resolution depended upon the quality of the scanner, transmission line, and the printer. Analog fax machines are obsolete and no longer manufactured. ITU-T Recommendations T.2 and T.3 were withdrawn as obsolete in July 1996.

* Group 1 faxes conform to the ITU-T Recommendation T.2. Group 1 faxes take six minutes to transmit a single page, with a vertical resolution of 96 scan lines per inch. Group 1 fax machines are obsolete and no longer manufactured.
* Group 2 faxes conform to the ITU-T Recommendations T.3 and T.30. Group 2 faxes take three minutes to transmit a single page, with a vertical resolution of 96 scan lines per inch. Group 2 fax machines are almost obsolete, and are no longer manufactured. Group 2 fax machines can interoperate with Group 3 fax machines.

==== Digital ====
A major breakthrough in the development of the modern facsimile system was the result of digital technology, where the analog signal from scanners was digitized and then compressed, resulting in the ability to transmit high rates of data across standard phone lines. The first digital fax machine was the Dacom Rapidfax first sold in late 1960s, which incorporated digital data compression technology developed by Lockheed for transmission of images from satellites.

Group 3 and 4 faxes are digital formats and take advantage of digital compression methods to greatly reduce transmission times.

* Group 3 faxes conform to the ITU-T Recommendations T.30 and T.4. Group 3 faxes take between 6 and 15 seconds to transmit a single page (not including the initial time for the fax machines to handshake and synchronize). The horizontal and vertical resolutions are allowed by the T.4 standard to vary among a set of fixed resolutions:
** Horizontal: 100 scan lines per inch

Fax Over IP (FoIP) can transmit and receive pre-digitized documents at near-realtime speeds using ITU-T recommendation T.38 to send digitised images over an IP network using JPEG compression. T.38 is designed to work with VoIP services and often supported by analog telephone adapters used by legacy fax machines that need to connect through a VoIP service. Scanned documents are limited to the amount of time the user takes to load the document in a scanner and for the device to process a digital file. The resolution can vary from as little as 150 DPI to 9600 DPI or more. This type of faxing is not related to the e-mail–to–fax service that still uses fax modems at least one way.

=== Class ===
Computer modems are often designated by a particular fax class, which indicates how much processing is offloaded from the computer&#x27;s CPU to the fax modem.

* Class 1 (also known as Class 1.0) fax devices do fax data transfer, while the T.4/T.6 data compression and T.30 session management are performed by software on a controlling computer. This is described in ITU-T recommendation T.31.
* What is commonly known as &quot;Class 2&quot; is an unofficial class of fax devices that perform T.30 session management themselves, but the T.4/T.6 data compression is performed by software on a controlling computer. Implementations of this &quot;class&quot; are based on draft versions of the standard that eventually significantly evolved to become Class 2.0. All implementations of &quot;Class 2&quot; are manufacturer-specific.
* Class 2.0 is the official ITU-T version of Class 2 and is commonly known as Class 2.0 to differentiate it from many manufacturer-specific implementations of what is commonly known as &quot;Class 2&quot;. It uses a different but standardized command set than the various manufacturer-specific implementations of &quot;Class 2&quot;. The relevant ITU-T recommendation is T.32.
* Class 2.1 is an improvement of Class 2.0 that implements faxing over V.34 (33.6 kbit/s), which boosts faxing speed from fax classes &quot;2&quot; and 2.0, which are limited to 14.4 kbit/s. The relevant ITU-T recommendation is T.32 Amendment 1. Class 2.1 fax devices are referred to as &quot;super G3&quot;.

=== Data transmission rate ===
Several different telephone-line modulation techniques are used by fax machines. They are negotiated during the fax-modem handshake, and the fax devices will use the highest data rate that both fax devices support, usually a minimum of 14.4 kbit/s for Group 3 fax.

&quot;Super Group 3&quot; faxes use V.34bis modulation that allows a data rate of up to 33.6 kbit/s.

=== Compression ===
As well as specifying the resolution (and allowable physical size) of the image being faxed, the ITU-T T.4 recommendation specifies two compression methods for decreasing the amount of data that needs to be transmitted between the fax machines to transfer the image. The two methods defined in T.4 are:
* Modified Huffman (MH).
* Modified READ (MR) (&quot;Relative Element Address Designate&quot;), optional.
An additional method is specified in T.6:
* Modified Modified READ (MMR).
Later, other compression techniques were added as options to ITU-T recommendation T.30, such as the more efficient JBIG (T.82, T.85) for bi-level content, and JPEG (T.81), T.43, MRC (T.44), and T.45 for grayscale, palette, and colour content. Fax machines can negotiate at the start of the T.30 session to use the best technique implemented on both sides.

==== Modified Huffman ====

Modified Huffman (MH), specified in T.4 as the one-dimensional coding scheme, is a codebook-based run-length encoding scheme optimised to efficiently compress whitespace. As most faxes consist mostly of white space, this minimises the transmission time of most faxes. Each line scanned is compressed independently of its predecessor and successor.

==== Modified READ ====
Modified READ, specified as an optional two-dimensional coding scheme in T.4, encodes the first scanned line using MH. The next line is compared to the first, the differences determined, and then the differences are encoded and transmitted. This is effective, as most lines differ little from their predecessor. This is not continued to the end of the fax transmission, but only for a limited number of lines until the process is reset, and a new &quot;first line&quot; encoded with MH is produced. This limited number of lines is to prevent errors propagating throughout the whole fax, as the standard does not provide for error correction. This is an optional facility, and some fax machines do not use MR in order to minimise the amount of computation required by the machine. The limited number of lines is 2 for &quot;Standard&quot;-resolution faxes, and 4 for &quot;Fine&quot;-resolution faxes.

==== Modified Modified READ ====

The ITU-T T.6 recommendation adds a further compression type of Modified Modified READ (MMR), which simply allows a greater number of lines to be coded by MR than in T.4. This is because T.6 makes the assumption that the transmission is over a circuit with a low number of line errors, such as digital ISDN. In this case, the number of lines for which the differences are encoded is not limited.

==== JBIG ====

In 1999, ITU-T recommendation T.30 added JBIG (ITU-T T.82) as another lossless bi-level compression algorithm, or more precisely a &quot;fax profile&quot; subset of JBIG (ITU-T T.85). JBIG-compressed pages result in 20% to 50% faster transmission than MMR-compressed pages, and up to 30 times faster transmission if the page includes halftone images.

JBIG performs adaptive compression, that is, both the encoder and decoder collect statistical information about the transmitted image from the pixels transmitted so far, in order to predict the probability for each next pixel being either black or white. For each new pixel, JBIG looks at ten nearby, previously transmitted pixels. It counts, how often in the past the next pixel has been black or white in the same neighborhood, and estimates from that the probability distribution of the next pixel. This is fed into an arithmetic coder, which adds only a small fraction of a bit to the output sequence if the more probable pixel is then encountered.

The ITU-T T.85 &quot;fax profile&quot; constrains some optional features of the full JBIG standard, such that codecs do not have to keep data about more than the last three pixel rows of an image in memory at any time. This allows the streaming of &quot;endless&quot; images, where the height of the image may not be known until the last row is transmitted.

ITU-T T.30 allows fax machines to negotiate one of two options of the T.85 &quot;fax profile&quot;:
* In &quot;basic mode&quot;, the JBIG encoder must split the image into horizontal stripes of 128 lines (parameter L0 = 128) and restart the arithmetic encoder for each stripe.
* In &quot;option mode&quot;, there is no such constraint.

==== Matsushita Whiteline Skip ====
A proprietary compression scheme employed on Panasonic fax machines is Matsushita Whiteline Skip (MWS). It can be overlaid on the other compression schemes, but is operative only when two Panasonic machines are communicating with one another. This system detects the blank scanned areas between lines of text, and then compresses several blank scan lines into the data space of a single character. (JBIG implements a similar technique called &quot;typical prediction&quot;, if header flag TPBON is set to 1.)

=== Typical characteristics ===
Group 3 fax machines transfer one or a few printed or handwritten pages per minute in black-and-white (bitonal) at a resolution of 204×98 (normal) or 204×196 (fine) dots per square inch. The transfer rate is 14.4 kbit/s or higher for modems and some fax machines, but fax machines support speeds beginning with 2400 bit/s and typically operate at 9600 bit/s. The transferred image formats are called ITU-T (formerly CCITT) fax group 3 or 4. Group 3 faxes have the suffix codice_1 and the MIME type codice_2.

The most basic fax mode transfers in black and white only. The original page is scanned in a resolution of 1728 pixels/line and 1145 lines/page (for A4). The resulting raw data is compressed using a modified Huffman code optimized for written text, achieving average compression factors of around 20. Typically a page needs 10 s for transmission, instead of about three minutes for the same uncompressed raw data of 1728×1145 bits at a speed of 9600 bit/s. The compression method uses a Huffman codebook for run lengths of black and white runs in a single scanned line, and it can also use the fact that two adjacent scanlines are usually quite similar, saving bandwidth by encoding only the differences.

Fax classes denote the way fax programs interact with fax hardware. Available classes include Class 1, Class 2, Class 2.0 and 2.1, and Intel CAS. Many modems support at least class 1 and often either Class 2 or Class 2.0. Which is preferable to use depends on factors such as hardware, software, modem firmware, and expected use.

===Printing process===
Fax machines from the 1970s to the 1990s often used direct thermal printers with rolls of thermal paper as their printing technology, but since the mid-1990s there has been a transition towards plain-paper faxes: thermal transfer printers, inkjet printers and laser printers.

One of the advantages of inkjet printing is that inkjets can affordably print in color; therefore, many of the inkjet-based fax machines claim to have color fax capability. There is a standard called ITU-T30e (formally ITU-T Recommendation T.30 Annex E ) for faxing in color; however, it is not widely supported, so many of the color fax machines can only fax in color to machines from the same manufacturer.

=== Stroke speed ===
Stroke speed in facsimile systems is the rate at which a fixed line perpendicular to the direction of scanning is crossed in one direction by a scanning or recording spot. Stroke speed is usually expressed as a number of strokes per minute. When the fax system scans in both directions, the stroke speed is twice this number. In most conventional 20th century mechanical systems, the stroke speed is equivalent to drum speed.

=== Fax paper ===

As a precaution, thermal fax paper is typically not accepted in archives or as documentary evidence in some courts of law unless photocopied. This is because the image-forming coating is eradicable and brittle, and it tends to detach from the medium after a long time in storage.

=== Fax tone ===

A CNG tone is an 1100 Hz tone transmitted by a fax machine when it calls another fax machine. Fax tones can cause complications when implementing fax over IP.

== Internet fax ==
One popular alternative is to subscribe to an Internet fax service, allowing users to send and receive faxes from their personal computers using an existing email account. No software, fax server or fax machine is needed. Faxes are received as attached TIFF or PDF files, or in proprietary formats that require the use of the service provider&#x27;s software. Faxes can be sent or retrieved from anywhere at any time that a user can get Internet access. Some services offer secure faxing to comply with stringent HIPAA and Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act requirements to keep medical information and financial information private and secure. Utilizing a fax service provider does not require paper, a dedicated fax line, or consumable resources.

Another alternative to a physical fax machine is to make use of computer software which allows people to send and receive faxes using their own computers, utilizing fax servers and unified messaging. A virtual (email) fax can be printed out and then signed and scanned back to computer before being emailed. Also the sender can attach a digital signature to the document file.

With the surging popularity of mobile phones, virtual fax machines can now be downloaded as applications for Android and iOS. These applications make use of the phone&#x27;s internal camera to scan fax documents for upload or they can import from various cloud services.
