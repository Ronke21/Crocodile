<text>Gary Snyder (born May 8, 1930) is an American poet, essayist, lecturer, and environmental activist. His early poetry has been associated with the Beat Generation and the San Francisco Renaissance and he has been described as the &quot;poet laureate of Deep Ecology&quot;.
Snyder is a winner of a Pulitzer Prize for Poetry and the American Book Award. His work, in his various roles, reflects an immersion in both Buddhist spirituality and nature. He has translated literature into English from ancient Chinese and modern Japanese. For many years, Snyder was an academic at the University of California, Davis, and for a time served as a member of the California Arts Council.

==Life and career==

===Early life===
Snyder was born in San Francisco, California, to Harold and Lois Hennessy Snyder. Snyder is of German, Scottish, Irish and English ancestry. His family, impoverished by the Great Depression, moved to King County, Washington, when he was two years old. There, they tended dairy-cows, kept laying-hens, had a small orchard, and made cedar-wood shingles. At the age of seven, Snyder was bedridden for four months by an accident. &quot;So my folks brought me piles of books from the Seattle Public Library,&quot; he recalled in an interview, &quot;and it was then I really learned to read and from that time on was voracious — I figure that accident changed my life. At the end of four months, I had read more than most kids do by the time they&#x27;re eighteen. And I didn&#x27;t stop.&quot; Also during his ten childhood years in Washington, Snyder became aware of the presence of the Coast Salish people and developed an interest in the Native American peoples in general and their traditional relationship with nature.

In 1942, following his parents&#x27; divorce, Snyder moved to Portland, Oregon, with his mother and his younger sister, Anthea. Their mother, Lois Snyder Hennessy (born Wilkey), worked during this period as a reporter for &quot;The Oregonian&quot;. One of his boyhood jobs was as a newspaper copy-boy at the &quot;Oregonian&quot;. During his teen years, he attended Lincoln High School, worked as a camp counselor, and went mountain-climbing with the Mazamas youth-group. Climbing remained an interest of his, especially during his twenties and thirties. In 1947, he started attending Reed College on a scholarship. Here, he met, and, for a time, roomed with the writer Carl Proujan, and became acquainted with the young poets Philip Whalen and Lew Welch. During his time at Reed, Snyder published his first poems in a student journal. In 1948 he spent the summer working as a seaman. To get this job, he joined the now-defunct Marine Cooks and Stewards union, and would later work as a seaman in the mid-1950s to gain experience of other cultures in port cities. Snyder married Alison Gass in 1950; they separated after seven months, and divorced in 1952.

While attending Reed, Snyder conducted folklore research on the Warm Springs Indian Reservation in central Oregon. He graduated with a dual degree in anthropology and literature in 1951. Snyder&#x27;s senior thesis, entitled &quot;The Dimensions of a Myth&quot;, employed perspectives from anthropology, folklore, psychology, and literature to examine a myth of the Pacific Northwest&#x27;s Haida people. He spent the following few summers working as a timber scaler at Warm Springs, developing relationships with its people that were rooted less in academia. This experience formed the basis for some of his earliest published poems (including &quot;A Berry Feast&quot;), later collected in the book &quot;The Back Country&quot;. He also encountered the basic ideas of Buddhism and, through its arts, some East Asian traditional attitudes toward nature. He went to Indiana University with a graduate fellowship to study anthropology. (Snyder also began practicing self-taught Zen meditation.) He left after a single semester to return to San Francisco and to &#x27;sink or swim as a poet&#x27;. Snyder worked for two summers in the North Cascades in Washington as a fire lookout, on Crater Mountain in 1952 and Sourdough Mountain in 1953 (both locations on the upper Skagit River). His attempts to get another lookout stint in 1954 (at the peak of McCarthyism), however, failed. He found himself barred from working for the government due to his association with the Marine Cooks and Stewards. Instead, he went back to Warm Springs to work in logging as a choker setter. This experience contributed to his &quot;Myths and Texts&quot; and the essay &quot;Ancient Forests of the Far West&quot;.

===The Beats===
Back in San Francisco, Snyder lived with Whalen, who shared his growing interest in Zen. Snyder&#x27;s reading of the writings of D. T. Suzuki had in fact been a factor in his decision not to continue as a graduate student in anthropology, and in 1953 he enrolled at the University of California, Berkeley, to study Asian culture and languages. He studied ink and wash painting under Chiura Obata and Tang dynasty poetry under Ch&#x27;en Shih-hsiang. Snyder continued to spend summers working in the forests, including one summer as a trail-builder in Yosemite. He spent some months in 1955 and 1956 living in a cabin (which he dubbed &quot;Marin-an&quot;) outside Mill Valley, California with Jack Kerouac. It was also at this time that Snyder was an occasional student at the American Academy of Asian Studies, where Saburo Hasegawa and Alan Watts, among others, were teaching. Hasegawa introduced Snyder to the treatment of landscape painting as a meditative practice. This inspired Snyder to attempt something equivalent in poetry, and with Hasegawa&#x27;s encouragement, he began work on &quot;Mountains and Rivers Without End&quot;, which would be completed and published 40 years later. During these years, Snyder was writing and collecting his own work, as well as embarking on the translation of the &quot;Cold Mountain&quot; poems by the 8th-century Chinese recluse Han Shan; this work appeared in chapbook form in 1959, under the title &quot;Riprap &amp; Cold Mountain Poems&quot;.

Snyder met Allen Ginsberg when the latter sought Snyder out on the recommendation of Kenneth Rexroth. Then, through Ginsberg, Snyder and Kerouac came to know each other. This period provided the materials for Kerouac&#x27;s novel &quot;The Dharma Bums&quot;, and Snyder was the inspiration for the novel&#x27;s main character, Japhy Ryder, in the same way Neal Cassady had inspired Dean Moriarty in &quot;On the Road&quot;. As the large majority of people in the Beat movement had urban backgrounds, writers like Ginsberg and Kerouac found Snyder, with his backcountry and manual-labor experience and interest in things rural, a refreshing and almost exotic individual. Lawrence Ferlinghetti later referred to Snyder as &#x27;the Thoreau of the Beat Generation&#x27;.

Snyder read his poem &quot;A Berry Feast&quot; at the poetry reading at the Six Gallery in San Francisco (October 7, 1955) that heard the first reading of Ginsberg&#x27;s poem &quot;Howl&quot; and marked the emergence into mainstream publicity of the Beats. This also marked Snyder&#x27;s first involvement with the Beats, although he was not a member of the original New York circle, having entered the scene through his association with Whalen and Welch. As recounted in Kerouac&#x27;s &quot;Dharma Bums&quot;, even at age 25 Snyder felt he could have a role in the fateful future meeting of West and East. Snyder&#x27;s first book, &quot;Riprap&quot;, which drew on his experiences as a forest lookout and on the trail crew in Yosemite, was published in 1959.

===Japan and India===
Independently, some of the Beats, including Whalen, had become interested in Zen, but Snyder was one of the more serious scholars of the subject among them, preparing in every way he could think of for eventual study in Japan. In 1955, the First Zen Institute of America offered him a scholarship for a year of Zen training in Japan, but the State Department refused to issue him a passport, informing him that &quot;it has been alleged you are a Communist.&quot; A subsequent District of Columbia Court of Appeals ruling forced a change in policy, and Snyder got his passport. In the end, his expenses were paid by Ruth Fuller Sasaki, for whom he was supposed to work; but initially he served as personal attendant and English tutor to Zen abbot Miura Isshu, at Rinko-in, a temple in Shokoku-ji in Kyoto, where American Buddhist popularizer Dwight Goddard and British author and Japanese culture devotee R. H. Blyth had preceded him. Mornings, after &quot;zazen&quot;, &quot;sutra&quot; chanting, and chores for the abbot, he took Japanese classes, bringing his spoken Japanese up to a level sufficient for &quot;kōan&quot; study. He developed a friendship with Philip Yampolsky, an eminent translator and scholar of Zen Buddhism, who took him around Kyoto. In early July 1955, he took refuge and requested to become Miura&#x27;s disciple, thus formally becoming a Buddhist.

In 1958, he returned to California via the Persian Gulf, Turkey, Sri Lanka and various Pacific Islands, voyaging as a crewman in the engine room on the oil tanker &quot;Sappa Creek&quot;, and took up residence at Marin-an again. He turned one room into a &quot;zendo&quot;, with about six regular participants. In early June, he met the poet Joanne Kyger. She became his girlfriend, and eventually his wife. In 1959, he shipped for Japan again, where he rented a cottage outside Kyoto. He became the first foreign disciple of Rinzai &quot;Rōshi&quot; Oda Sesso, the new abbot of Daitoku-ji. He married Kyger on February 28, 1960, immediately after her arrival in Japan, which Fuller Sasaki insisted they do, if they were to live together and be associated with the Nichibei Daiichi Zen Kyokai. Snyder and Kyger were married from 1960 to 1965.

During the period between 1956 and 1969, Snyder went back and forth between California and Japan, studying Zen, working on translations with Fuller Sasaki, and finally living for a while with a group of other people on the small, volcanic island of Suwanosejima. His previous study of written Chinese assisted his immersion in the Zen tradition, which has its roots in Tang dynasty China, and enabled him to support himself while he was living in Japan. Snyder received the Zen precepts and his dharma name of &quot;Chofu&quot; (&quot;Listen to the Wind&quot;), and lived occasionally as a &quot;de facto&quot; monk, but never registered to become a priest, planning eventually to return to the United States to &quot;turn the wheel of the dharma&quot;. During this time, he published two collections of his poems from the early to mid 1950s, &quot;Myths &amp; Texts&quot; (1960), and &quot;Six Sections from Mountains and Rivers Without End&quot; (1965). This last was the beginning of a project that he was to continue working on until the late 1990s. Much of Snyder&#x27;s poetry expresses experiences, environments, and insights involved with the work he has done for a living: logger, fire-lookout, steam-freighter crew, translator, carpenter, and itinerant poet, among other things. During his years in Japan, Snyder was also initiated into &quot;Shugendo&quot;, a highly syncretic ascetic religious cult.

In the early 1960s he traveled for six months through India with Kyger, Ginsberg, and Ginsberg&#x27;s partner, the poet and actor Peter Orlovsky. Their sojourn took them to Sri Lanka, then to south India, and eventually travelling up into the north. They observed the folkways of the various peoples, went on hikes, stopped at landmarks, temples, burning ghats, monastic caves, and ashrams. As they went, they learned in part through conversations with many Indians and Europeans who could speak English. They visited numerous cities, including Madras, Calcutta, Mumbai, Banaras, Old Delhi and New Delhi, as well as Rishikesh and Hardwar, and Bodh Gaya (where Shakyamuni, the historical Buddha, attained enlightenment). Especially important to Snyder and Ginsberg, in Dharamashala the Dalai Lama met with them and they discussed Buddhist principles and practices.

Snyder and Kyger separated soon after their trip to India, and divorced in 1965.

===Dharma Bums===
In the 1950s, Snyder took part in the rise of a strand of Buddhist anarchism emerging from the Beat movement. Snyder was the inspiration for the Japhy Ryder character in Kerouac&#x27;s novel &quot;The Dharma Bums&quot; (1958). Snyder had spent considerable time in Japan studying Zen Buddhism, and in 1961 published an essay, &quot;Buddhist Anarchism&quot;, where he described the connection he saw between these two traditions, originating in different parts of the world: &quot;The mercy of the West has been social revolution; the mercy of the East has been individual insight into the basic self/void.&quot; He advocated &quot;using such means as civil disobedience, outspoken criticism, protest, pacifism, voluntary poverty and even gentle violence&quot; and defended &quot;the right of individuals to smoke ganja, eat peyote, be polygynous, polyandrous or homosexual&quot; which he saw as being banned by &quot;the Judaeo-Capitalist-Christian-Marxist West&quot;.

===Kitkitdizze===
In 1966, Snyder joined Allen Ginsberg, Richard Baker, future Roshi of the San Francisco Zen Center, and Kriyananda aka Donald J Walters, to buy in the San Juan Ridge area of the Sierra-Nevada foothills, north of Nevada City, Northern California. In 1967 Snyder&#x27;s book &quot;The Back Country&quot; appeared, again mainly a collection of poems stretching back over about fifteen years. Snyder devoted a section at the end of the book to his translations of eighteen poems by Kenji Miyazawa. In 1970, Kitkitdizze (as he named his portion of the San Juan Ridge property) would become his home. By that point, Snyder had already spent the summers of 1967 and 1968 with a group of Japanese back-to-the-land drop-outs known as &quot;the Tribe&quot; on Suwanosejima (a small Japanese island in the East China Sea), where they combed the beaches, gathered edible plants, and fished. On the island, on August 6, 1967, he married Masa Uehara, whom he had met in Osaka a year earlier. In 1968, they moved to California with their infant son, Kai (born April 1968). Their second son, Gen, was born a year later. They were shortly able to move onto the San Juan Ridge property, near the South Yuba River, where they and friends built a house that drew on rural-Japanese and Native-American architectural ideas.

===Later life and writings===
&quot;Regarding Wave&quot; appeared in January 1970, a stylistic departure offering poems that were more emotional, metaphoric, and lyrical. From the late 1960s, the content of Snyder&#x27;s poetry increasingly had to do with family, friends, and community. He continued to publish poetry throughout the 1970s, much of it reflecting his re-immersion in life on the American continent and his involvement in the back-to-the-land movement in the Sierra foothills. His 1974 book &quot;Turtle Island&quot;, titled after a Native American name for the North American continent, won a Pulitzer Prize. It also influenced numerous West Coast Generation X writers, including Alex Steffen, Bruce Barcott and Mark Morford. His 1983 book &quot;Axe Handles&quot;, won an American Book Award. Snyder wrote numerous essays setting forth his views on poetry, culture, social experimentation, and the environment. Many of these were collected in &quot;Earth House Hold&quot; (1969), &quot;The Old Ways&quot; (1977), &quot;The Real Work&quot; (1980), &quot;The Practice of the Wild&quot; (1990), &quot;A Place in Space&quot; (1995), and &quot;The Gary Snyder Reader&quot; (1999). In 1979, Snyder published &quot;He Who Hunted Birds in His Father&#x27;s Village: The Dimensions of a Haida Myth&quot;, based on his Reed thesis. Snyder&#x27;s journals from his travel in India in the mid-1960s appeared in 1983 under the title &quot;Passage Through India&quot;. In these, his wide-ranging interests in cultures, natural history, religions, social critique, contemporary America, and hands-on aspects of rural life, as well as his ideas on literature, were given full-blown articulation.

In 1986, Snyder became a professor in the writing program at the University of California, Davis. Snyder is now professor emeritus of English.

Snyder was married to Uehara for twenty-two years; the couple divorced in 1989. Snyder married Carole Lynn Koda (October 3, 1947 – June 29, 2006), who would write &quot;Homegrown: Thirteen brothers and sisters, a century in America&quot;, in 1991, and remained married to her until her death of cancer. She had been born in the third generation of a successful Japanese-American farming family, noted for its excellent rice. She shared Buddhism, extensive travels, and work with Snyder, and performed independent work as a naturalist.

As Snyder&#x27;s involvement in environmental issues and his teaching grew, he seemed to move away from poetry for much of the 1980s and early 1990s. However, in 1996 he published the complete &quot;Mountains and Rivers Without End&quot;, a mixture of the lyrical and epic modes celebrating the act of inhabitation on a specific place on the planet. This work was written over a 40-year period. It has been translated into Japanese, French and Russian. In 2004 Snyder published &quot;Danger on Peaks&quot;, his first collection of new poems in twenty years.

Snyder was awarded the Levinson Prize from the journal &quot;Poetry&quot;, the American Poetry Society Shelley Memorial Award (1986), was inducted into the American Academy of Arts and Letters (1987), and won the 1997 Bollingen Prize for Poetry and, that same year, the John Hay Award for Nature Writing. Snyder also has the distinction of being the first American to receive the Buddhism Transmission Award (for 1998) from the Japan-based Bukkyo Dendo Kyokai Foundation. For his ecological and social activism, Snyder was named as one of the 100 visionaries selected in 1995 by &quot;Utne Reader&quot;.

Snyder&#x27;s life and work were celebrated in John J. Healy&#x27;s 2010 documentary &quot;The Practice of the Wild.&quot; The film, which debuted at the 53rd San Francisco International Film Festival, features wide-ranging, running conversations between Snyder and poet, writer and longtime colleague Jim Harrison, filmed mostly on the Hearst Ranch in San Simeon, California. The film also shows archival photographs and film of Snyder&#x27;s life.

==Work==

===Poetics===
Snyder uses mainly common speech-patterns as the basis for his lines, though his style has been noted for its &quot;flexibility&quot; and the variety of different forms his poems have taken. He typically uses neither conventional meters nor intentional rhyme. &quot;Love and respect for the primitive tribe, honour accorded the Earth, the escape from city and industry into both the past and the possible, contemplation, the communal&quot;, such, according to Glyn Maxwell, is the awareness and commitment behind the specific poems.

The author and editor Stewart Brand once wrote: &quot;Gary Snyder&#x27;s poetry addresses the life-planet identification with unusual simplicity of style and complexity of effect.&quot; According to Jody Norton, this simplicity and complexity derives from Snyder&#x27;s use of natural imagery (geographical formations, flora, and fauna) in his poems. Such imagery can be both sensual at a personal level yet universal and generic in nature. In the 1968 poem &quot;Beneath My Hand and Eye the Distant Hills, Your Body,&quot; the author compares the intimate experience of a lover&#x27;s caress with the mountains, hills, cinder cones, and craters of the Uintah Mountains. Readers become explorers on both a very private level as well as a very public and grand level. A simplistic touch becoming a very complex interaction occurring at multiple levels. This is the effect Snyder intended. In an interview with Faas, he states, &quot;There is a direction which is very beautiful, and that&#x27;s the direction of the organism being less and less locked into itself, less and less locked into its own body structure and its relatively inadequate sense organs, towards a state where the organism can actually go out from itself and share itself with others.&quot;

Snyder has always maintained that his personal sensibility arose from his interest in Native Americans and their involvement with nature and knowledge of it; indeed, their ways seemed to resonate with his own. And he has sought something akin to this through Buddhist practices, Yamabushi initiation, and other experiences and involvements. However, since his youth he has been quite literate, and he has written about his appreciation of writers of similar sensibilities, like D. H. Lawrence, William Butler Yeats, and some of the great ancient Chinese poets. William Carlos Williams was another influence, especially on Snyder&#x27;s earliest published work. Starting in high school, Snyder read and loved the work of Robinson Jeffers, his predecessor in poetry of the landscape of the American West, but whereas Jeffers valued nature over humankind, Snyder saw humankind as part of nature. Snyder commented in interviews, &quot;I have some concerns that I&#x27;m continually investigating that tie together biology, mysticism, prehistory, general systems theory&quot;. Snyder argues that poets, and humans in general, need to adjust to very long timescales, especially when judging the consequences of their actions. His poetry examines the gap between nature and culture so as to point to ways in which the two can be more closely integrated.

In 2004, receiving the Masaoka Shiki International Haiku Awards Grand Prize, Snyder highlighted traditional ballads and folk songs, Native American songs and poems, William Blake, Walt Whitman, Jeffers, Ezra Pound, Noh drama, Zen aphorisms, Federico García Lorca, and Robert Duncan as significant influences on his poetry, but added, &quot;the influence from haiku and from the Chinese is, I think, the deepest.&quot;

=== Romanticism ===
Snyder is among those writers who have sought to dis-entrench conventional thinking about primitive peoples that has viewed them as simple-minded, ignorantly superstitious, brutish, and prone to violent emotionalism. In the 1960s Snyder developed a &quot;neo-tribalist&quot; view akin to the &quot;post-modernist&quot; theory of French Sociologist Michel Maffesoli. The &quot;re-tribalization&quot; of the modern, mass-society world envisioned by Marshall McLuhan, with all of the ominous, dystopian possibilities that McLuhan warned of, subsequently accepted by many modern intellectuals, is not the future that Snyder expects or works toward. Snyder&#x27;s is a positive interpretation of the tribe and of the possible future.
Todd Ensign describes Snyder&#x27;s interpretation as blending ancient tribal beliefs and traditions, philosophy, physicality, and nature with politics to create his own form of Postmodern environmentalism. Snyder rejects the perspective which portrays nature and humanity in direct opposition to one another. Instead, he chooses to write from multiple viewpoints. He purposely sets out to bring about change on the emotional, physical, and political levels by emphasizing the ecological problems faced by today&#x27;s society.

===Beat===
Snyder is widely regarded as a member of the Beat Generation circle of writers: he was one of the poets that read at the famous &quot;Six Gallery&quot; event, and was written about in one of Kerouac&#x27;s most popular novels, &quot;The Dharma Bums&quot;. Some critics argue that Snyder&#x27;s connection with the Beats is exaggerated and that he might better be regarded as a part of the San Francisco Renaissance, which developed independently. Snyder himself has some reservations about the label &quot;Beat&quot;, but does not appear to have any strong objection to being included in the group. He often talks about the Beats in the first person plural, referring to the group as &quot;we&quot; and &quot;us&quot;.

A quotation from a 1974 interview at the University of North Dakota Writers Conference (published in &quot;The Beat Vision&quot;):

I never did know exactly what was meant by the term &#x27;The Beats&#x27;, but let&#x27;s say that the original meeting, association, comradeship of Allen [Ginsberg], myself, Michael [McClure], Lawrence [Ferlinghetti], Philip Whalen, who&#x27;s not here, Lew Welch, who&#x27;s dead, Gregory [Corso], for me, to a somewhat lesser extent (I never knew Gregory as well as the others) did embody a criticism and a vision which we shared in various ways, and then went our own ways for many years. Where we began to come really close together again, in the late &#x27;60s, and gradually working toward this point, it seems to me, was when Allen began to take a deep interest in Oriental thought and then in Buddhism which added another dimension to our levels of agreement; and later through Allen&#x27;s influence, Lawrence began to draw toward that; and from another angle, Michael and I after the lapse of some years of contact, found our heads very much in the same place, and it&#x27;s very curious and interesting now; and Lawrence went off in a very political direction for a while, which none of us had any objection with, except that wasn&#x27;t my main focus. It&#x27;s very interesting that we find ourselves so much on the same ground again, after having explored divergent paths; and find ourselves united on this position of powerful environmental concern, critique of the future of the individual state, and an essentially shared poetics, and only half-stated but in the background very powerfully there, a basic agreement on some Buddhist type psychological views of human nature and human possibilities.

Snyder has also commented &quot;The term Beat is better used for a smaller group of writers ... the immediate group around Allen Ginsberg and Jack Kerouac, plus Gregory Corso and a few others. Many of us ... belong together in the category of the San Francisco Renaissance. ... Still, beat can also be defined as a particular state of mind ... and I was in that mind for a while&quot;.

<text>Gonzo journalism is a style of journalism that is written without claims of objectivity, often including the reporter as part of the story using a first-person narrative. The word &quot;gonzo&quot; is believed to have been first used in 1970 to describe an article about the Kentucky Derby by Hunter S. Thompson, who popularized the style. It is an energetic first-person participatory writing style in which the author is a protagonist, and it draws its power from a combination of social critique and self-satire. It has since been applied to other subjective artistic endeavors.

Gonzo journalism involves an approach to accuracy that concerns the reporting of personal experiences and emotions, in contrast to traditional journalism, which favors a detached style and relies on facts or quotations that can be verified by third parties. Gonzo journalism disregards the strictly edited product once favored by newspaper media and strives for a more personal approach; the personality of a piece is as important as the event or actual subject of the piece. Use of sarcasm, humour, exaggeration, and profanity is common.

Thompson, who was among the forefathers of the New Journalism movement, said in the February 15, 1973, issue of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, &quot;If I&#x27;d written the truth I knew for the past ten years, about 600 people—including me—would be rotting in prison cells from Rio to Seattle today. Absolute truth is a very rare and dangerous commodity in the context of professional journalism.&quot;

== Etymology ==
The term &quot;gonzo&quot; was first used in connection with Hunter S. Thompson by &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; magazine editor Bill Cardoso in 1970. He described Thompson&#x27;s article &quot;The Kentucky Derby Is Decadent and Depraved&quot;, which was written for the June 1970 edition of &quot;Scanlan&#x27;s Monthly&quot;, as &quot;pure Gonzo journalism&quot;. This predates the December 1970 debut of the Muppet Gonzo in &quot;The Great Santa Claus Switch&quot;. Cardoso said &quot;gonzo&quot; was South Boston Irish slang describing the last man standing after an all-night drinking marathon. He also said it was a corruption of the Canadian French word , which means , although this is disputed.

Another speculation is that the word may have been inspired by the 1960 hit song &quot;Gonzo&quot; by the rhythm and blues pianist James Booker. This possibility is supported by a 2007 oral biography of Thompson, which states that the term is taken from a song by Booker but does not explain why Thompson or Cardoso would have chosen the term to describe Thompson&#x27;s journalism. The 2013 documentary &quot;Bayou Maharaja: The Tragic Genius of James Booker&quot; quotes Thompson&#x27;s literary executor as saying that the song was the origin of the term. According to a Greg Johnson biographical note on Booker, the song title &quot;Gonzo&quot; comes from a character in a movie called &quot;The Pusher&quot;, which in turn may have been inspired by a 1956 Evan Hunter novel of the same title.

Thompson himself first used the term referring to his own work on page 12 of the counterculture classic &quot;Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas&quot;. He wrote, &quot;But what &quot;was&quot; the story? Nobody had bothered to say. So we would have to drum it up on our own. Free Enterprise. The American Dream. Horatio Alger gone mad on drugs in Las Vegas. Do it &quot;now&quot;: pure Gonzo journalism.&quot;

Lexico proposes etymology from and/or .

== Hunter S. Thompson ==

Thompson based his style on William Faulkner&#x27;s notion that &quot;fiction is often the best fact&quot;. While the things that Thompson wrote about are basically true, he used satirical devices to drive his points home. He often wrote about recreational drugs and alcohol use, which added subjective flair to his reporting. The term &quot;gonzo&quot; has also come into (sometimes pejorative) use to describe journalism in Thompson&#x27;s style, characterized by a drug-fueled stream of consciousness writing technique.

&quot;Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas&quot; followed the Mint 400 piece in 1971 and included a main character by the name of Raoul Duke, accompanied by his attorney, Dr. Gonzo, with defining art by Ralph Steadman. Although this book is considered a prime example of gonzo journalism, Thompson regarded it as a failed experiment. He had intended it to be an unedited record of everything he did as it happened, but he edited the book five times before publication.

Thompson would instigate events himself, often in a prankish or belligerent manner, and then document both his actions and those of others. Notoriously neglectful of deadlines, Thompson often annoyed his editors because he submitted articles late, &quot;too late to be edited, yet still in time for the printer&quot;. Thompson wanted his work to be read as he wrote it, in its &quot;true Gonzo&quot; form. Historian Douglas Brinkley said gonzo journalism requires virtually no rewriting and frequently uses transcribed interviews and verbatim telephone conversations.

&quot;I don&#x27;t get any satisfaction out of the old traditional journalist&#x27;s view: &#x27;I just covered the story. I just gave it a balanced view, Thompson said in an interview for the online edition of &quot;The Atlantic&quot;. &quot;Objective journalism is one of the main reasons American politics has been allowed to be so corrupt for so long. You can&#x27;t be objective about Nixon.&quot;

The Gonzo Studies Society proposes eleven features that, to varying degrees, are included in Hunter S. Thompson&#x27;s Gonzo journalism:

* Subjectivity
* Immediacy (using notes, transcripts, etc.)
* A blend of fact and fiction
* Dark comedy
* A peculiar lexis
* Some kind of sidekick figure
* Hyperbole and/or fantasy
* Drug use
* Violence
* Digressions
* Conspiratorial tone

== Influence and legacy ==

Thompson felt that objectivity in journalism was a myth. Gonzo journalism has now become a &quot;bona fide&quot; style of writing that is similar to the New Journalism of the 1960s, led primarily by Tom Wolfe and also championed by Lester Bangs, George Plimpton, Terry Southern, and John Birmingham, and is considered a subgenre of New Journalism. When asked whether there was a difference between the two, Thompson answered, &quot;Yeah, I think so. Unlike Tom Wolfe or Gay Talese, for instance, I almost never try to reconstruct a story. They&#x27;re both much better reporters than I am, but then I don&#x27;t really think of myself as a reporter.&quot;

In 1998, Christopher Locke asserted that the webzine genre is descended from gonzo journalism, a claim that has since been extended to social media. Thompson&#x27;s gonzo journalism influence is reflected in the current website &quot;Gonzo Today&quot; which features a top banner by Thompson&#x27;s longtime illustrator Ralph Steadman, with rotating contributions by others including Thompson associate, poet Ron Whitehead.

It has been claimed that Thai writer Rong Wongsawan wrote in a style that was Gonzo, beginning in the 1960s when he reported from San Francisco. However he wrote in Thai, and he probably developed the style independently of Hunter S. Thompson. He also used the style in his books &quot;Sattahip&quot; and &quot;Takli&quot; which describe American soldiers and Thai bar girls during the Vietnam War. His book &quot;The Man from Bangkok: San Francisco Culture in the 60s&quot; is an English translation of a book published in Thai in 1978.

== Modern gonzo journalism ==
In the early days of YouTube and digital journalism in the early 2000s, outlets such as Vice Media began to create videos in the style of gonzo journalism. Journalist Shane Smith, the founder of Vice, published videos and articles reporting on his visits to extreme locations. These videos included a multi-day propaganda tour he received of North Korea, his visit to a Bangkok brothel, and on-the-ground reports of Darfur and Iran. Vice also published on-the-ground reports from people experiencing current events, such as a 2007 issue written by Iraqi citizens about their ongoing experiences surrounding the Iraq War troop surge.

In more recent years, gonzo journalism can be seen on channels such as Channel 5, where journalist Andrew Callaghan journeys across the United States to interview random passers-by during major political events such as the overturning of Roe V. Wade, Anti-Vaccine demonstrations, and the Black Lives Matter protests of 2020.

Journalist Hamilton Morris wrote &#x27;The Magic Jews&#x27; for Vice in 2008, in which he documented his experience taking LSD with a group of Hasidic Jews. In 2009, Vice hired Morris to write the monthly column Hamilton&#x27;s Pharmacopeia, which quickly evolved into a series of articles and documentaries in which Morris documents the culture, pharmacology, manufacturing, and use of psychoactive drugs; the series generally documents Morris using substances alongside the people he is documenting.

<text>The giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca), also known as the panda bear or simply panda, is a bear species endemic to China. It is characterised by its white coat with black patches around the eyes, ears, legs and shoulders. Its body is rotund; adult individuals weigh and are typically long. It is sexually dimorphic, with males being typically 10 to 20% larger than females. A thumb is visible on its forepaw, which helps in holding bamboo in place for feeding. It has large molar teeth and expanded temporal fossa to meet its dietary requirements. It can digest starch and is mostly herbivorous with a diet consisting almost entirely of bamboo and bamboo shoots.

The giant panda lives exclusively in six montane regions in a few Chinese provinces at elevations of up to . It is solitary and gathers only in mating seasons. It relies on olfactory communication to communicate and uses scent marks as chemical cues and on landmarks like rocks or trees. Females rear cubs for an average of 18 to 24 months. The oldest known giant panda was 38 years old.

As a result of farming, deforestation and infrastructural development, the giant panda has been driven out of the lowland areas where it once lived. The wild population has increased again to 1,864 individuals as of March 2015. Since 2016, it has been listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List. In July 2021, Chinese authorities also classified the giant panda as vulnerable. It is a conservation-reliant species. By 2007, the captive population comprised 239 giant pandas in China and another 27 outside the country. It has often served as China&#x27;s national symbol, appeared on Chinese Gold Panda coins since 1982 and as one of the five Fuwa mascots of the 2008 Summer Olympics held in Beijing.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;panda&quot; was borrowed into English from French, but no conclusive explanation of the origin of the French word &quot;panda&quot; has been found. The closest candidate is the Nepali word &quot;ponya,&quot; possibly referring to the adapted wrist bone of the red panda, which is native to Nepal. In many older sources, the name &quot;panda&quot; or &quot;common panda&quot; refers to the red panda (&quot;Ailurus fulgens&quot;), which was described some 40 years earlier and over that period was the only animal known as a panda. The binomial name &quot;Ailuropoda melanoleuca&quot; means black and white (melanoleuca) cat-foot (ailuropoda).

Since the earliest collection of Chinese writings, the Chinese language has given the bear many different names, including &quot;mò&quot; (, ancient Chinese name for giant panda), &quot;huāxióng&quot; (; &quot;spotted bear&quot;) and &quot;zhúxióng&quot; (; &quot;bamboo bear&quot;). The most popular names in China today are &quot;dàxióngmāo&quot; (; ), or simply &quot;xióngmāo&quot; (; ). As with the word panda in English, &quot;xióngmāo&quot; () was originally used to describe just the red panda, but &quot;dàxióngmāo&quot; () and &quot;xiǎoxióngmāo&quot; (; ) were coined to differentiate between the species. 

In Taiwan, another popular name for panda is the inverted &quot;dàmāoxióng&quot; (; ), though many encyclopedias and dictionaries in Taiwan still use the &quot;bear cat&quot; form as the correct name. Some linguists argue, in this construction, &quot;bear&quot; instead of &quot;cat&quot; is the base noun, making the name more grammatically and logically correct, which have led to the popular choice despite official writings. This name did not gain its popularity until 1988, when a private zoo in Tainan painted a sun bear black and white and created the Tainan fake panda incident.

==Taxonomy==
For many decades, the precise taxonomic classification of the giant panda was under debate because it shares characteristics with both bears and raccoons. In 1985, molecular studies indicated that the giant panda is a true bear, part of the family Ursidae. These studies show it diverged about from the common ancestor of the Ursidae; it is the most basal member of this family and equidistant from all other extant bear species.

===Subspecies===

Two subspecies of giant panda have been recognized on the basis of distinct cranial measurements, colour patterns, and population genetics.
* The nominate subspecies, &quot;A. m. melanoleuca&quot;, consists of most extant populations of the giant panda. These animals are principally found in Sichuan and display the typical stark black and white contrasting colours.
* The Qinling panda, &quot;A. m. qinlingensis&quot;, is restricted to the Qinling Mountains in Shaanxi at elevations of . The typical black and white pattern of Sichuan giant pandas is replaced with a light brown and white pattern. The skull of &quot;A. m. qinlingensis&quot; is smaller than its relatives, and it has larger molars.

A detailed study of the giant panda&#x27;s genetic history from 2012 confirms that the separation of the Qinling population occurred about 300,000 years ago, and reveals that the non-Qinling population further diverged into two groups, named the Minshan and the Qionglai-Daxiangling-Xiaoxiangling-Liangshan group respectively, about 2,800 years ago.

===Phylogeny===
Of the eight extant species in the bear family Ursidae, the giant panda&#x27;s lineage branched off the earliest. 

== Distribution and habitat ==
The giant panda is endemic to China. It is found in small, fragmented populations in six mountainous regions in the country, mainly in Sichuan, and also in neighbouring Shaanxi and Gansu. Successful habitat preservation has seen a rise in panda numbers, though loss of habitat due to human activities remains its biggest threat. In areas with a high concentration of medium-to-large-sized mammalssuch as domestic cattle, a species known to degrade the landscapethe giant panda population is generally low. This is mainly attributed to the panda&#x27;s avoidance of interspecific competition. 

The species has been located at elevations of above sea level. They frequent habitats with a healthy concentration of bamboos, typically old-growth forests, but may also venture into secondary forest habitats. The Daxiangling Mountain population inhabits both coniferous and broadleaf forests. Additionally, the Qinling population often selects evergreen broadleaf and conifer forests, while pandas in the Qionglai mountainous region exclusively select upland conifer forests. The remaining two populations, namely those occurring in the Liangshan and Xiaoxiangling mountains, predominantly occur in broadleaf evergreen and conifer forests.

Giant pandas once roamed across Southeast Asia from Myanmar to northern Vietnam. Their range in China spanned much of the southeast region. By the Pleistocene, climate change affected panda populations, and the subsequent domination of modern humans led to large-scale habitat loss. In 2001, it was estimated that the range of the giant panda had declined by about 99% of its range in earlier millenniums.

==Description==

The giant panda has a body shape typical of bears. It has black fur on its ears, limbs, shoulders and around the eyes. The rest of the animal&#x27;s coat is white. The bear&#x27;s distinctive coloration appears to serve as camouflage in both winter and summer environments as they do not hibernate. The white areas serve as camouflage in snow, while the black shoulders and legs conceal them in shade. Studies in the wild have found that when viewed from a distance, the panda displays disruptive coloration, while up close, they rely more on blending in. The black ears may be used to display aggression, while the eye patches might facilitate them identifying one another. The giant panda&#x27;s thick, woolly coat keeps it warm in the cool forests of its habitat.

The panda&#x27;s skull shape is typical of durophagous carnivorans. It has evolved from previous ancestors to exhibit larger molars with increased complexity and expanded temporal fossa. A study revealed that a giant panda had a bite force of 1298.9 Newton (BFQ 151.4) at canine teeth and 1815.9 Newton (BFQ 141.8) at carnassial teeth.
Adults measure around long, including a tail of about , and tall at the shoulder. Males can weigh up to . Females are generally 10–20% smaller than males. They weigh between and . The average weight for adults is .

The giant panda&#x27;s paw has a digit similar to a thumb and five fingers; the thumb-like digit – actually a modified sesamoid bone – helps it to hold bamboo while eating. The giant panda&#x27;s tail, measuring , is the second-longest in the bear family, behind the sloth bear.

==Ecology==
===Diet===
Despite its taxonomic classification as a carnivoran, the giant panda&#x27;s diet is primarily herbivorous, with approximately 99% of its diet consisting of bamboo. However, the giant panda still has the digestive system of a carnivore, as well as carnivore-specific genes, and thus derives little energy and little protein from the consumption of bamboo. The ability to break down cellulose and lignin is very weak, and their main source of nutrients comes from starch and hemicelluloses. The most important part of their bamboo diet is the shoots, that are rich in starch and have up to 32% protein content. Accordingly, pandas have evolved a higher capability to digest starches than strict carnivores. Raw bamboo is toxic, containing cyanide compounds. Pandas&#x27; body tissues are less able than herbivores to detoxify cyanide, but their gut microbiomes are significantly enriched in putative genes coding for enzymes related to cyanide degradation, suggesting that they have cyanide-digesting gut microbes. It has been estimated that an adult panda absorbs of cyanide a day through its diet. To prevent poisoning, they have evolved anti-toxic mechanisms to protect themselves. About 80% of the cyanide is metabolized to less toxic thiocyanate and discharged in urine, while the remaining 20% is detoxified by other minor pathways. 

During the shoot season (AprilAugust), pandas store a large amount of food in preparation for the months succeeding this seasonal period, in which pandas live off a diet of bamboo leaves. The giant panda is a highly specialised animal with unique adaptations, and has lived in bamboo forests for millions of years.
The average giant panda eats as much as of bamboo shoots a day to compensate for the limited energy content of its diet. Ingestion of such a large quantity of material is possible and necessary because of the rapid passage of large amounts of indigestible plant material through the short, straight digestive tract. It is also noted, however, that such rapid passage of digesta limits the potential of microbial digestion in the gastrointestinal tract, limiting alternative forms of digestion. Given this voluminous diet, the giant panda defecates up to 40 times a day. The limited energy input imposed on it by its diet has affected the panda&#x27;s behavior. The giant panda tends to limit its social interactions and avoids steeply sloping terrain to limit its energy expenditures.

Two of the panda&#x27;s most distinctive features, its large size and round face, are adaptations to its bamboo diet. Anthropologist Russell Ciochon observed: &quot;[much] like the vegetarian gorilla, the low body surface area to body volume [of the giant panda] is indicative of a lower metabolic rate. This lower metabolic rate and a more sedentary lifestyle allows the giant panda to subsist on nutrient poor resources such as bamboo.&quot; The giant panda&#x27;s round face is the result of powerful jaw muscles, which attach from the top of the head to the jaw. Large molars crush and grind fibrous plant material.
The morphological characteristics of extinct relatives of the giant panda suggest that while the ancient giant panda was omnivorous 7 million years ago (mya), it only became herbivorous some 2–2.4 mya with the emergence of &quot;A. microta&quot;. Genome sequencing of the giant panda suggests that the dietary switch could have initiated from the loss of the sole umami taste receptor, encoded by the genes TAS1R1 and TAS1R3 (also known as T1R1 and T1R3), resulting from two frameshift mutations within the T1R1 exons. Umami taste corresponds to high levels of glutamate as found in meat and may have thus altered the food choice of the giant panda. Although the pseudogenisation (conversion into a pseudogene) of the umami taste receptor in &quot;Ailuropoda&quot; coincides with the dietary switch to herbivory, it is likely a result of, and not the reason for, the dietary change. The mutation time for the T1R1 gene in the giant panda is estimated to 4.2 mya while fossil evidence indicates bamboo consumption in the giant panda species at least 7 mya, signifying that although complete herbivory occurred around 2 mya, the dietary switch was initiated prior to T1R1 loss-of-function.

Pandas eat any of 25 bamboo species in the wild, with the most common including &quot;Fargesia dracocephala&quot; and &quot;Fargesia rufa&quot;. Only a few bamboo species are widespread at the high altitudes pandas now inhabit. Bamboo leaves contain the highest protein levels; stems have less. Because of the synchronous flowering, death, and regeneration of all bamboo within a species, the giant panda must have at least two different species available in its range to avoid starvation. While primarily herbivorous, the giant panda still retains decidedly ursine teeth and will eat meat, fish, and eggs when available. In captivity, zoos typically maintain the giant panda&#x27;s bamboo diet, though some will provide specially formulated biscuits or other dietary supplements.

Pandas will travel between different habitats if they need to, so they can get the nutrients that they need and to balance their diet for reproduction.

===Interspecific interactions===

Although adult giant pandas have few natural predators other than humans, young cubs are vulnerable to attacks by snow leopards, yellow-throated martens, eagles, feral dogs, and the Asian black bear. Sub-adults weighing up to may be vulnerable to predation by leopards.

Giant pandas are sympatric with other large mammals and bamboo feeders, such as the takin (&quot;Budorcas taxicolor&quot;). The takin and giant panda share a similar ecological niche, and they consume the same resources. When competition for food is fierce, pandas disperse to the outskirts of takin distribution. Other possible competitors include but is not limited to, the Eurasian wild pig (&quot;Sus scrofa&quot;), Chinese goral (&quot;Naemorhedus griseus&quot;) and the Asian black bear (&quot;Ursus thibetanus&quot;). Giant pandas avoid areas with a mid-to-high density of livestock, as they depress the vegetation. The Tibetan Plateau is the only known area where both giant and red pandas can be found. Although sharing near-identical ecological niches, competition between the two species has rarely been observed. Nearly 50% of their respective distribution overlaps, and successful coexistence is achieved through distinct habitat selection.

===Pathogens and parasites===

A captive female died from toxoplasmosis, a disease caused by an obligate intracellular parasitic protozoan known as &quot;Toxoplasma gondii&quot; that infects most warm-blooded animals, including humans. They are likely susceptible to diseases from &quot;Baylisascaris schroederi&quot;, a parasitic nematode known to infect giant panda intestines. This nematode species is known to give pandas &quot;baylisascariasi&quot;, a deadly disease that kills more wild pandas than any other cause. Additionally, the population is threatened by canine distemper virus (CDV), canine parvovirus, rotavirus, canine adenovirus, and canine coronavirus. Bacteria, such as &quot;Clostridium welchii&quot;, &quot;Proteus mirabilis&quot;, &quot;Klebsiella pneumoniae&quot;, and &quot;Escherichia coli&quot;, may also be lethal.

==Behavior==
The giant panda is a terrestrial animal and primarily spends its life roaming and feeding in the bamboo forests of the Qinling Mountains and in the hilly province of Sichuan. Giant pandas are generally solitary. Each adult has a defined territory and a female is not tolerant of other females in her range. Social encounters occur primarily during the brief breeding season in which pandas in proximity to one another will gather. After mating, the male leaves the female alone to raise the cub. Pandas were thought to fall into the crepuscular category, those who are active twice a day, at dawn and dusk; however, pandas may belong to a category all of their own, with activity peaks in the morning, afternoon and midnight. The low nutrition quality of bamboo means pandas need to eat more frequently, and due to their lack of major predators they can be active at any time of the day. Activity is highest in June and decreases in late summer to autumn with an increase from November through the following March. Activity is also directly related to the amount of sunlight during colder days. There is a significant interaction of solar radiation, such that solar radiation has a stronger positive effect on activity levels of panda bears.

Pandas communicate through vocalisation and scent marking such as clawing trees or spraying urine. They are able to climb and take shelter in hollow trees or rock crevices, but do not establish permanent dens. For this reason, pandas do not hibernate, which is similar to other subtropical mammals, and will instead move to elevations with warmer temperatures. Pandas rely primarily on spatial memory rather than visual memory. Though the panda is often assumed to be docile, it has been known to attack humans on rare occasions. Pandas have been known to cover themselves in horse manure to protect themselves against cold temperatures.

The species communicates foremost through a blatting sound; they achieve peaceful interactions through the emission of this sound. When in oestrus, a female emits a chirp. In hostile confrontations or during fights, the giant panda emits vocalizations such as a roar or growl. On the other hand, squeals typically indicate inferiority and submission in a dispute. Other vocalizations include honks and moans.

=== Olfactory communication ===
Giant pandas heavily rely on olfactory communication to communicate with one another. Scent marks are used to spread these chemical cues and are placed on landmarks like rocks or trees. Chemical communication in giant pandas plays many roles in their social situations. Scent marks and odors are used to spread information about sexual status, whether a female is in estrus or not, age, gender, individuality, dominance over territory, and choice of settlement. Giant pandas communicate by excreting volatile compounds, or scent marks, through the anogenital gland. Giant pandas have unique positions in which they will scent mark. Males deposit scent marks or urine by lifting their hind leg, rubbing their backside, or standing in order to rub the anogenital gland onto a landmark. Females, however, exercise squatting or simply rubbing their genitals onto a landmark.

The season plays a major role in mediating chemical communication. Depending on the season, mainly whether it is breeding season or not, may influence which odors are prioritized. Chemical signals can have different functions in different seasons. During the non-breeding season, females prefer the odors of other females because reproduction is not their primary motivation. However, during breeding season, odors from the opposite sex will be more attractive. Because they are solitary mammals and their breeding season is so brief, female pandas secrete chemical cues in order to let males know their sexual status. The chemical cues female pandas secrete can be considered to be pheromones for sexual reproduction. Females deposit scent marks through their urine which induces an increase in androgen levels in males. Androgen is a sex hormone found in both males and females; testosterone is the major androgen produced by males. Civetone and decanoic acid are chemicals found in female urine which promote behavioral responses in males; both chemicals are considered giant panda pheromones. Male pandas also secrete chemical signals that include information about their sexual reproductivity and age, which is beneficial for a female when choosing a mate. For example, age can be useful for a female to determine sexual maturity and sperm quality. Pandas are also able to determine when the signal was placed, further aiding in the quest to find a potential mate. However, chemical cues are not just used for communication between males and females, pandas can determine individuality from chemical signals. This allows them to be able to differentiate between a potential partner or someone of the same sex, which could be a potential competitor.

Chemical cues, or odors, play an important role in how a panda chooses their habitat. Pandas look for odors that tell them not only the identity of another panda, but if they should avoid them or not. Pandas tend to avoid their species for most of the year, breeding season being the brief time of major interaction. Chemical signaling allows for avoidance and competition. Pandas whose habitats are in similar locations will collectively leave scent marks in a unique location which is termed &quot;scent stations&quot;. When pandas come across these scent stations, they are able to identify a specific panda and the scope of their habitat. This allows pandas to be able to pursue a potential mate or avoid a potential competitor.

Pandas can assess an individual&#x27;s dominance status, including their age and size, via odor cues and may choose to avoid a scent mark if the signaler&#x27;s competitive ability outweighs their own. A panda&#x27;s size can be conveyed through the height of the scent mark. Since larger animals can place higher scent marks, an elevated scent mark advertises a higher competitive ability. Age must also be taken into consideration when assessing a competitor&#x27;s fighting ability. For example, a mature panda will be larger than a younger, immature panda and possess an advantage during a fight.

===Reproduction===

Giant pandas reach sexual maturity between the ages of four and eight, and may be reproductive until age 20. The mating season is between March and May, when a female goes into estrus, which lasts for two or three days and only occurs once a year. When mating, the female is in a crouching, head-down position as the male mounts her from behind. Copulation time ranges from 30 seconds to five minutes, but the male may mount her repeatedly to ensure successful fertilisation. The gestation period is somewhere between 95 and 160 days - the variability is due to the fact that the fertilized egg may linger in the reproductive system for a while before implanting on the uterine wall. Giant pandas give birth to twins in about half of pregnancies. If twins are born, usually only one survives in the wild. The mother will select the stronger of the cubs, and the weaker cub will die due to starvation. The mother is thought to be unable to produce enough milk for two cubs since she does not store fat. The father has no part in helping raise the cub.

When the cub is first born, it is pink, blind, and toothless, weighing only , or about of the mother&#x27;s weight, proportionally the smallest baby of any placental mammal. It nurses from its mother&#x27;s breast six to 14 times a day for up to 30 minutes at a time. For three to four hours, the mother may leave the den to feed, which leaves the cub defenseless. One to two weeks after birth, the cub&#x27;s skin turns grey where its hair will eventually become black. Slight pink colour may appear on the cub&#x27;s fur, as a result of a chemical reaction between the fur and its mother&#x27;s saliva. A month after birth, the colour pattern of the cub&#x27;s fur is fully developed. Its fur is very soft and coarsens with age. The cub begins to crawl at 75 to 80 days; mothers play with their cubs by rolling and wrestling with them. The cubs can eat small quantities of bamboo after six months, though mother&#x27;s milk remains the primary food source for most of the first year. Giant panda cubs weigh at one year and live with their mothers until they are 18 months to two years old. The interval between births in the wild is generally two years.

Initially, the primary method of breeding giant pandas in captivity was by artificial insemination, as they seemed to lose their interest in mating once they were captured. This led some scientists to trying methods such as showing them videos of giant pandas mating and giving the males sildenafil (commonly known as Viagra). In the 2000s, researchers started having success with captive breeding programs, and they have now determined giant pandas have comparable breeding to some populations of the American black bear, a thriving bear species.

In July 2009, Chinese scientists confirmed the birth of the first cub to be successfully conceived through artificial insemination using frozen sperm. The technique for freezing the sperm in liquid nitrogen was first developed in 1980 and the first birth was hailed as a solution to the dwindling availability of giant panda semen, which had led to inbreeding. Panda semen, which can be frozen for decades, could be shared between different zoos to save the species. As of 2009, it is expected that zoos in destinations such as San Diego in the United States and Mexico City will be able to provide their own semen to inseminate more giant pandas. 

Attempts have also been made to reproduce giant pandas by interspecific pregnancy where cloned panda embryos were implanted into the uterus of an animal of another species. This has resulted in panda fetuses, but no live births.

==Human interaction==

===Early references===

In Ancient China, people thought pandas to be rare and noble creatures – the Empress Dowager Bo was buried with a panda skull in her vault. The grandson of Emperor Taizong of Tang is said to have given Japan two pandas and a sheet of panda skin as a sign of goodwill. Unlike many other animals in Ancient China, pandas were rarely thought to have medical uses. The few known uses include the Sichuan tribal peoples&#x27; use of panda urine to melt accidentally swallowed needles, and the use of panda pelts to control menstruation as described in the Qin dynasty encyclopedia &quot;Erya&quot;.

The creature named &quot;mo&quot; (貘) mentioned in some ancient books has been interpreted as giant panda. The dictionary &quot;Shuowen Jiezi&quot; (Eastern Han Dynasty) says that the &quot;mo&quot;, from Shu (Sichuan), is bear-like, but yellow-and-black, although the older &quot;Erya&quot; describes &quot;mo&quot; simply as a &quot;white leopard&quot;. The interpretation of the legendary fierce creature &quot;pixiu&quot; (貔貅) as referring to the giant panda is also common.

During the reign of the Yongle Emperor (early 15th century), his relative from Kaifeng sent him a captured &quot;zouyu&quot; (騶虞), and another &quot;zouyu&quot; was sighted in Shandong. &quot;Zouyu&quot; is a legendary &quot;righteous&quot; animal, which, similarly to a &quot;qilin&quot;, only appears during the rule of a benevolent and sincere monarch.

===In captivity===

Pandas have been kept in zoos as early as the Western Han Dynasty in China, where the writer Sima Xiangru noted that the panda was the most treasured animal in the emperor&#x27;s garden of exotic animals in the capital Chang&#x27;an (present Xi&#x27;an). Not until the 1950s were pandas again recorded to have been exhibited in China&#x27;s zoos. Chi Chi at the London Zoo became very popular. This influenced the World Wildlife Fund to use a panda as its symbol. A 2006 &quot;New York Times&quot; article outlined the economics of keeping pandas, which costs five times more than keeping the next most expensive animal, an elephant. American zoos generally pay the Chinese government $1 million a year in fees, as part of a typical ten-year contract. San Diego&#x27;s contract with China was to expire in 2008, but got a five-year extension at about half of the previous yearly cost. The last contract, with the Memphis Zoo in Memphis, Tennessee, ended in 2013.

In the 1970s, gifts of giant pandas to American and Japanese zoos formed an important part of the diplomacy of the People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC), as it marked some of the first cultural exchanges between China and the West. This practice has been termed &quot;panda diplomacy&quot;. By 1984, however, pandas were no longer given as gifts. Instead, China began to offer pandas to other nations only on 10-year loans for a fee of up to US$1,000,000 per year and with the provision that any cubs born during the loan are the property of China. As a result of this change in policy, nearly all the pandas in the world are owned by China, and pandas leased to foreign zoos and all cubs are eventually returned to China. As of 2022, Xin Xin at the Chapultepec Zoo in Mexico City, was the last living descendant of the gifted pandas.

Since 1998, because of a WWF lawsuit, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service only allows US zoos to import a panda if the zoo can ensure China channels more than half of its loan fee into conservation efforts for giant pandas and their habitat. In May 2005, China offered a breeding pair to Taiwan. The issue became embroiled in cross-Strait relations – due to both the underlying symbolism and technical issues such as whether the transfer would be considered &quot;domestic&quot; or &quot;international&quot; or whether any true conservation purpose would be served by the exchange. A contest in 2006 to name the pandas was held in the mainland, resulting in the politically charged names Tuan Tuan and Yuan Yuan (from , implying reunification). China&#x27;s offer was initially rejected by Chen Shui-bian, then President of Taiwan. However, when Ma Ying-jeou assumed the presidency in 2008, the offer was accepted and the pandas arrived in December of that year.

In the 2020s, certain &quot;celebrity pandas&quot; have gained a cult following amongst internet users, with dedicated fan accounts existing to keep tabs on the animals. Known as &quot;giant panda fever&quot; or &quot;panda-monium&quot;, individual pandas are known to get billions of views and engagements on social media, as well as product lines specifically emulating them. At Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding, certain of these &quot;celebrity pandas&quot; are known to garner hours-long lines specifically to see them. 

==Conservation==
The giant panda is a vulnerable species, threatened by continued habitat loss and fragmentation, and by a very low birthrate, both in the wild and in captivity. Its range is confined to a small portion on the western edge of its historical range, which stretched through southern and eastern China, northern Myanmar, and northern Vietnam. The species is scattered into more than 30 subpopulations of relatively few animals. Building of roads and human settlement near panda habitat, result in population declines. Diseases from domesticated pets and livestock is another threat. By 2100, it is estimated that the distribution of giant pandas will shrink by up to 100%, mainly due to the effects of climate change. The giant panda is listed on CITES Appendix I, meaning trade of their parts is prohibited and that they require this protection to avoid extinction. They have been protected and placed in category 1, by the 1988 Wildlife Protection Act. 

The giant panda has been a target of poaching by locals since ancient times and by foreigners since it was introduced to the West. Starting in the 1930s, foreigners were unable to poach giant pandas in China because of the Second Sino-Japanese War and the Chinese Civil War, but pandas remained a source of soft furs for the locals. The population boom in China after 1949 created stress on the pandas&#x27; habitat and the subsequent famines led to the increased hunting of wildlife, including pandas. After the Chinese economic reform, demand for panda skins from Hong Kong and Japan led to illegal poaching for the black market, acts generally ignored by the local officials at the time. In 1963, the PRC government set up Wolong National Nature Reserve to save the declining panda population.

The giant panda is among the world&#x27;s most adored and protected rare animals, and is one of the few in the world whose natural inhabitant status was able to gain a UNESCO World Heritage Site designation. The Sichuan Giant Panda Sanctuaries, located in the southwest province of Sichuan and covering seven natural reserves, were inscribed onto the World Heritage List in 2006. A 2015 paper found that the giant panda can serve as an umbrella species as the preservation of their habitat also helps other endemic species in China, including 70% of the country&#x27;s forest birds, 70% of mammals and 31% of amphibians.

In 2012, Earthwatch Institute, a global nonprofit that teams volunteers with scientists to conduct important environmental research, launched a program called &quot;On the Trail of Giant Panda&quot;. This program, based in the Wolong National Nature Reserve, allows volunteers to work up close with pandas cared for in captivity, and help them adapt to life in the wild, so that they may breed, and live longer and healthier lives. Efforts to preserve the panda bear populations in China have come at the expense of other animals in the region, including snow leopards, wolves, and dholes. In order to improve living and mating conditions for the fragmented populations of pandas, nearly 70 natural reserves have been combined to form the Giant Panda National Park in 2020. With a size of 10,500 square miles, the park is roughly three times as large as Yellowstone National Park and incorporates the Wolong National Nature Reserve. Small, isolated populations run the risk of inbreeding and smaller genetic variety makes the individuals more vulnerable to various defects and genetic mutation.

=== Population ===

In 2006, scientists reported that the number of pandas living in the wild may have been underestimated at about 1,000. Previous population surveys had used conventional methods to estimate the size of the wild panda population, but using a new method that analyzes DNA from panda droppings, scientists believed the wild population were as large as 3,000. In 2006, there were 40 panda reserves in China, compared to just 13 reserves in 1998. As the species has been reclassified from &quot;endangered&quot; to &quot;vulnerable&quot; since 2016, the conservation efforts are thought to be working. Furthermore, in response to this reclassification, the State Forestry Administration of China announced that they would not accordingly lower the conservation level for panda, and would instead reinforce the conservation efforts.

In 2020, the panda population of the new national park was already above 1,800 individuals, which is roughly 80 percent of the entire panda population in China. Establishing the new protected area in the Sichuan Province also gives various other endangered or threatened species, like the Siberian tiger, the possibility to improve their living conditions by offering them a habitat. Other species who benefit from the protection of their habitat include the snow leopard, the golden snub-nosed monkey, the red panda and the complex-toothed flying squirrel.

In July 2021, Chinese conservation authorities announced that giant pandas are no longer endangered in the wild following years of conservation efforts, with a population in the wild exceeding 1,800. China has received international praise for its conservation of the species, which has also helped the country establish itself as a leader in endangered species conservation.

<text>In music, a glissando (; plural: &quot;glissandi&quot;, abbreviated &quot;gliss.&quot;) is a from one pitch to another (). It is an Italianized musical term derived from the French &quot;glisser&quot;, &quot;to glide&quot;. In some contexts, it is equivalent to portamento, which is a continuous, seamless glide between notes. In other contexts, it refers to discrete, stepped glides across notes, such as on a piano. Some terms that are similar or equivalent in some contexts are slide, sweep bend, smear, rip (for a loud, violent glissando to the beginning of a note), lip (in jazz terminology, when executed by changing one&#x27;s embouchure on a wind instrument), plop, or falling hail (a glissando on a harp using the back of the fingernails). On wind instruments, a scoop is a glissando ascending to the onset of a note achieved entirely with the embouchure, except on instruments that have a slide (such as a trombone).

==Notation==

The glissando is indicated by following the initial note with a line, sometimes wavy, in the desired direction, often accompanied by the abbreviation &quot;gliss.&quot;. Occasionally, the desired notes are notated in the standard method (i.e. semiquavers) accompanied by the word &#x27;glissando&#x27;.

==Discrete glissando==
On some instruments (e.g., piano, harp, xylophone), discrete tones are clearly audible when sliding. For example, on a keyboard, a player&#x27;s fingernails can be made to slide across the white keys or over the black keys, producing either a C major scale or an F major pentatonic scale, or their relative modes; by performing both at once, it is possible to produce a full chromatic scale. Maurice Ravel used glissandi in many of his piano compositions, and &quot;Alborada del Gracioso&quot; contains notable piano glissando passages in thirds executed by the right hand. Rachmaninoff, Prokofiev, Liszt and Gershwin have all used glissandi for piano in notable compositions.

Organ players—particularly in contemporary music—sometimes employ an effect known as the palm glissando, where over the course of the glissando the flat of the hand is used to depress a wide area of keys simultaneously, resulting in a dramatic atonal sweep. 

A similar device on the piano are cluster-glissandos, used extensively by Karlheinz Stockhausen in &quot;Klavierstück X&quot;, and which &quot;more than anything else, lend the work its unique aural flavour&quot;. On a harp, the player can slide their finger across the strings, quickly playing the scale (or on pedal harp even arpeggios such as C-D-E-F-G-A-B). Wind, brass, and fretted-stringed-instrument players can perform an extremely rapid chromatic scale (e.g., sliding up or down a string quickly on a fretted instrument).

Arpeggio effects (likewise named glissando) are also obtained by bowed strings (playing harmonics) and brass, especially the horn.

==Continuous glissando ==
Musical instruments with continuously variable pitch are capable of continuous glissando, sometimes called portamento, over a substantial range. These include unfretted chordophones (such as the violin, viola, cello and double bass, and fretless guitars), stringed instruments with a way of stretching the strings (such as the guitar, veena, sitar or pipa), a fretted guitar or lap steel guitar when accompanied with the use of a slide, wind instruments without valves or stops (such as the trombone or slide whistle), timpani (kettledrums), electronic instruments (such as the theremin, the ondes Martenot, synthesizers and keytars), the water organ, and the human voice.

Wind instruments can effect a similar limited slide by altering the lip pressure (on trumpet, for example) or a combination of embouchure and rolling the head joint (as on the flute), while others such as the clarinet can achieve this by slowly dragging fingers off tone holes or changing the oral cavity&#x27;s resonance by manipulating tongue position, embouchure, and throat shaping.

Many electric guitars are fitted with a tremolo arm which can produce either a portamento, a vibrato, or a combination of both (but not a true tremolo despite the name).

Prescriptive attempts to distinguish the glissando from the portamento by limiting the former to discrete, stepped glides conflict with established usage of the term for instruments like the trombone and timpani. The clarinet gesture that opens &quot;Rhapsody in Blue&quot; was originally notated as a stepped glissando (Gershwin&#x27;s score labels each individual note) but is in practice played as a portamento.

==Bent note==
A bent note is a musical note that is varied in pitch. With unfretted strings or other continuous-pitch instruments such as the trombone, or with the human voice, such variation is more properly described in terms of intonation. A note is commonly bent to a higher pitch on fretted instruments literally by bending the string with excess finger pressure, and to a lower pitch on harmonica (a free-reed aerophone) by altering the vocal tract to shift the resonance of the reed. On brass instruments such as the trumpet, the note is bent by using the lip. &quot;Indeterminately pitched instruments [such as unpitched percussion instruments and friction drum rolls]...produce a pitch or pitch spectrum that becomes higher with an increase of dynamic and lower with a decrease of dynamic.&quot;

The bent note is commonly found in various forms of jazz, blues, and rock.

<text>The giraffe is a large African hoofed mammal belonging to the genus Giraffa. It is the tallest living terrestrial animal and the largest ruminant on Earth. Traditionally, giraffes have been thought of as one species, &quot;Giraffa camelopardalis&quot;, with nine subspecies. Most recently, researchers proposed dividing them into four extant species due to new research into their mitochondrial and nuclear DNA, and individual species can be distinguished by their fur coat patterns. Seven other extinct species of &quot;Giraffa&quot; are known from the fossil record.

The giraffe&#x27;s distinguishing characteristics are its extremely long neck and legs, horn-like ossicones, and spotted coat patterns. It is classified under the family Giraffidae, along with its closest extant relative, the okapi. Its scattered range extends from Chad in the north to South Africa in the south and from Niger in the west to Somalia in the east. Giraffes usually inhabit savannahs and woodlands. Their food source is leaves, fruits, and flowers of woody plants, primarily acacia species, which they browse at heights most other ground-based herbivores cannot reach.

Lions, leopards, spotted hyenas, and African wild dogs may prey upon giraffes. Giraffes live in herds of related females and their offspring or bachelor herds of unrelated adult males but are gregarious and may gather in large groups. Males establish social hierarchies through &quot;necking&quot;, combat bouts where the neck is used as a weapon. Dominant males gain mating access to females, which bear sole responsibility for rearing the young.

The giraffe has intrigued various ancient and modern cultures for its peculiar appearance and has often been featured in paintings, books, and cartoons. It is classified by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) as vulnerable to extinction. It has been extirpated from many parts of its former range. Giraffes are still found in many national parks and game reserves, but estimates as of 2016 indicate there are approximately 97,500 members of &quot;Giraffa&quot; in the wild. More than 1,600 were kept in zoos in 2010.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;giraffe&quot; has its earliest known origins in the Arabic word (), of an ultimately unclear Sub-Saharan African language origin. The Middle English and early Modern English spellings, and , derive from the Arabic form-based Spanish and Portuguese &quot;girafa&quot;. The modern English form developed around 1600 from the French .

&quot;Camelopard&quot; () is an archaic English name for the giraffe; it derives from the Ancient Greek (), from (), &quot;camel&quot;, and (), &quot;leopard&quot;, referring to its camel-like shape and leopard-like colouration.

==Taxonomy==
===Evolution===
The giraffe is one of only two living genera of the family Giraffidae in the order Artiodactyla, the other being the okapi. They are ruminants of the clade Pecora, along with Antilocapridae (pronghorns), Cervidae (deer), Bovidae (cattle, antelope, goats and sheep) and Moschidae (musk deer). A 2019 genome study (cladogram below) finds that Giraffidae are a sister taxon to Antilocapridae, with an estimated split of over 20 million years ago.
The family Giraffidae was once much more extensive, with over 10 fossil genera described. The elongation of the neck appears to have started early in the giraffe lineage. Comparisons between giraffes and their ancient relatives suggest vertebrae close to the skull lengthened earlier, followed by lengthening of vertebrae further down. One early giraffid ancestor was &quot;Canthumeryx&quot;, which has been dated variously to have lived , 17–15 mya or 18–14.3 mya and whose deposits have been found in Libya. This animal resembled an antelope and had a medium-sized, lightly built body. &quot;Giraffokeryx&quot; appeared 15–12 mya on the Indian subcontinent and resembled an okapi or a small giraffe, and had a longer neck and similar ossicones. &quot;Giraffokeryx&quot; may have shared a clade with more massively built giraffids like &quot;Sivatherium&quot; and &quot;Bramatherium&quot;.

Giraffids like &quot;Palaeotragus&quot;, &quot;Shansitherium&quot; and &quot;Samotherium&quot; appeared 14 mya and lived throughout Africa and Eurasia. These animals had broader skulls with reduced frontal cavities. &quot;Paleotragus&quot; resembled the okapi and may have been its ancestor. Others find that the okapi lineage diverged earlier, before &quot;Giraffokeryx&quot;. &quot;Samotherium&quot; was a particularly important transitional fossil in the giraffe lineage, as the length and structure of its cervical vertebrae were between those of a modern giraffe and an okapi, and its neck posture was likely similar to the former&#x27;s. &quot;Bohlinia&quot;, which first appeared in southeastern Europe and lived 9–7 mya, was likely a direct ancestor of the giraffe. &quot;Bohlinia&quot; closely resembled modern giraffes, having a long neck and legs and similar ossicones and dentition.

&quot;Bohlinia&quot; colonised China and northern India and produced the &quot;Giraffa&quot;, which, around , reached Africa. Climate changes led to the extinction of the Asian giraffes, while the African giraffes survived and radiated into new species. Living giraffes appear to have arisen around in eastern Africa during the Pleistocene. Some biologists suggest the modern giraffes descended from &quot;G. jumae&quot;; others find &quot;G. gracilis&quot; a more likely candidate. &quot;G. jumae&quot; was larger and more robust, while &quot;G. gracilis&quot; was smaller and more slender.

The changes from extensive forests to more open habitats, which began 8 mya, are believed to be the main driver for the evolution of giraffes. During this time, tropical plants disappeared and were replaced by arid C4 plants, and a dry savannah emerged across eastern and northern Africa and western India. Some researchers have hypothesised that this new habitat, coupled with a different diet, including acacia species, may have exposed giraffe ancestors to toxins that caused higher mutation rates and a higher rate of evolution. The coat patterns of modern giraffes may also have coincided with these habitat changes. Asian giraffes are hypothesised to have had more okapi-like colourations.

The giraffe genome is around 2.9 billion base pairs in length, compared to the 3.3 billion base pairs of the okapi. Of the proteins in giraffe and okapi genes, 19.4% are identical. The divergence of giraffe and okapi lineages dates to around 11.5 mya. A small group of regulatory genes in the giraffe appears responsible for the animal&#x27;s height and associated circulatory adaptations.

===Species and subspecies===

The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) currently recognises only one species of giraffe with nine subspecies.

Carl Linnaeus originally classified living giraffes as one species in 1758. He gave it the binomial name &quot;Cervus camelopardalis&quot;. Mathurin Jacques Brisson coined the generic name &quot;Giraffa&quot; in 1762. During the 1900s, various taxonomies with two or three species were proposed. A 2007 study on the genetics of giraffes using mitochondrial DNA suggested at least six lineages could be recognised as species. A 2011 study using detailed analyses of the morphology of giraffes, and application of the phylogenetic species concept, described eight species of living giraffes. A 2016 study also concluded that living giraffes consist of multiple species. The researchers suggested the existence of four species, which have not exchanged genetic information between each other for 1 to 2 million years.

A 2020 study showed that depending on the method chosen, different taxonomic hypotheses recognizing from two to six species can be considered for the genus &quot;Giraffa&quot;. That study also found that multi-species coalescent methods can lead to taxonomic over-splitting, as those methods delimit geographic structures rather than species. The three-species hypothesis, which recognises &quot;G&quot;. &quot;camelopardalis&quot;, &quot;G&quot;. &quot;giraffa&quot;, and &quot;G&quot;. &quot;tippelskirchi&quot;, is highly supported by phylogenetic analyses and also corroborated by most population genetic and multi-species coalescent analyses. A 2021 whole genome sequencing study suggests the existence of four distinct species and seven subspecies, which was supported by a 2024 study of cranial morphology. A 2024 study found a higher amount of ancient gene flow than expected between populations.

The cladogram below shows the phylogenetic relationship between the four proposed species and seven subspecies based on a 2021 genome analysis. The eight lineages correspond to eight traditional subspecies in the one-species hypothesis. The Rothschild giraffe is subsumed into &quot;G. camelopardalis camelopardalis&quot;.
The following table compares the different hypotheses for giraffe species. The description column shows the traditional nine subspecies in the one-species hypothesis.

The first extinct species to be described was &quot;Giraffa sivalensis&quot; Falconer and Cautley 1843, a reevaluation of a vertebra that was initially described as a fossil of the living giraffe. While taxonomic opinion may be lacking on some names, the extinct species that have been published include:
* &quot;Giraffa gracilis&quot;
* &quot;Giraffa jumae&quot;
* &quot;Giraffa pomeli&quot;
* &quot;Giraffa priscilla&quot;
* &quot;Giraffa punjabiensis&quot;
* &quot;Giraffa pygmaea&quot;
* &quot;Giraffa sivalensis&quot;
* &quot;Giraffa stillei&quot;

==Anatomy==

Fully grown giraffes stand tall, with males taller than females. The average weight is for an adult male and for an adult female. Despite its long neck and legs, its body is relatively short. The skin is mostly gray or tan, and can reach a thickness of . The long tail ends in a long, dark tuft of hair and is used as a defense against insects.

The coat has dark blotches or patches, which can be orange, chestnut, brown, or nearly black, surrounded by light hair, usually white or cream coloured. Male giraffes become darker as they grow old. The coat pattern has been claimed to serve as camouflage in the light and shade patterns of savannah woodlands. When standing among trees and bushes, they are hard to see at even a few metres distance. However, adult giraffes move about to gain the best view of an approaching predator, relying on their size and ability to defend themselves rather than on camouflage, which may be more important for calves. Each giraffe has a unique coat pattern. Calves inherit some coat pattern traits from their mothers, and variation in some spot traits is correlated with calf survival. The skin under the blotches may regulate the animal&#x27;s body temperature, being sites for complex blood vessel systems and large sweat glands. Spotless or solid-color giraffes are very rare, but have been observed.

The fur may give the animal chemical defense, as its parasite repellents give it a characteristic scent. At least 11 main aromatic chemicals are in the fur, although indole and 3-methylindole are responsible for most of the smell. Because males have a stronger odour than females, it may also have a sexual function.

===Head===

Both sexes have prominent horn-like structures called ossicones, which can reach . They are formed from ossified cartilage, covered in skin, and fused to the skull at the parietal bones. Being vascularised, the ossicones may have a role in thermoregulation, and are used in combat between males. Appearance is a reliable guide to the sex or age of a giraffe: the ossicones of females and young are thin and display tufts of hair on top, whereas those of adult males tend to be bald and knobbed on top. A lump, which is more prominent in males, emerges in the middle of the skull. Males develop calcium deposits that form bumps on their skulls as they age. Multiple sinuses lighten a giraffe&#x27;s skull. However, as males age, their skulls become heavier and more club-like, helping them become more dominant in combat. The occipital condyles at the bottom of the skull allow the animal to tip its head over 90 degrees and grab food on the branches directly above them with the tongue.

With eyes located on the sides of the head, the giraffe has a broad visual field from its great height. Compared to other ungulates, giraffe vision is more binocular and the eyes are larger with a greater retinal surface area. Giraffes may see in colour, and their senses of hearing and smell are sharp. The ears are movable. The nostrils are slit-shaped, possibly to withstand blowing sand. The giraffe&#x27;s tongue is about long. It is black, perhaps to protect against sunburn, and can grasp foliage and delicately pick off leaves. The upper lip is flexible and hairy to protect against sharp prickles. The upper jaw has a hard palate instead of front teeth. The molars and premolars are wide with low crowns on the surface.

===Neck===
The giraffe has an extremely elongated neck, which can be up to in length. Along the neck is a mane made of short, erect hairs. The neck typically rests at an angle of 50–60 degrees, though juveniles are closer to 70 degrees. The long neck results from a disproportionate lengthening of the cervical vertebrae, not from the addition of more vertebrae. Each cervical vertebra is over long. They comprise 52–54 per cent of the length of the giraffe&#x27;s vertebral column, compared with the 27–33 percent typical of similar large ungulates, including the giraffe&#x27;s closest living relative, the okapi. This elongation largely takes place after birth, perhaps because giraffe mothers would have a difficult time giving birth to young with the same neck proportions as adults. The giraffe&#x27;s head and neck are held up by large muscles and a nuchal ligament, which are anchored by long thoracic vertebrae spines, giving them a hump.
The giraffe&#x27;s neck vertebrae have ball and socket joints. The point of articulation between the cervical and thoracic vertebrae of giraffes is shifted to lie between the first and second thoracic vertebrae (T1 and T2), unlike in most other ruminants, where the articulation is between the seventh cervical vertebra (C7) and T1. This allows C7 to contribute directly to increased neck length and has given rise to the suggestion that T1 is actually C8, and that giraffes have added an extra cervical vertebra. However, this proposition is not generally accepted, as T1 has other morphological features, such as an articulating rib, deemed diagnostic of thoracic vertebrae, and because exceptions to the mammalian limit of seven cervical vertebrae are generally characterised by increased neurological anomalies and maladies.

There are several hypotheses regarding the evolutionary origin and maintenance of elongation in giraffe necks. Charles Darwin originally suggested the &quot;competing browsers hypothesis&quot;, which has been challenged only recently. It suggests that competitive pressure from smaller browsers, like kudu, steenbok and impala, encouraged the elongation of the neck, as it enabled giraffes to reach food that competitors could not. This advantage is real, as giraffes can and do feed up to high, while even quite large competitors, such as kudu, can feed up to only about high. There is also research suggesting that browsing competition is intense at lower levels, and giraffes feed more efficiently (gaining more leaf biomass with each mouthful) high in the canopy. However, scientists disagree about just how much time giraffes spend feeding at levels beyond the reach of other browsers, and a 2010 study found that adult giraffes with longer necks actually suffered higher mortality rates under drought conditions than their shorter-necked counterparts. This study suggests that maintaining a longer neck requires more nutrients, which puts longer-necked giraffes at risk during a food shortage.

Another theory, the sexual selection hypothesis, proposes that long necks evolved as a secondary sexual characteristic, giving males an advantage in &quot;necking&quot; contests (see below) to establish dominance and obtain access to sexually receptive females. In support of this theory, some studies have stated that necks are longer and heavier for males than females of the same age, and that males do not employ other forms of combat. However, a 2024 study found that, while males have thicker necks, females actually have proportionally longer ones, which is likely because of their greater need to find more food to sustain themselves and their dependent young. It has also been proposed that the neck serves to give the animal greater vigilance.

===Legs, locomotion and posture===

The front legs tend to be longer than the hind legs, and males have proportionally longer front legs than females, which gives them better support when swinging their necks during fights. The leg bones lack first, second and fifth metapodials. It appears that a suspensory ligament allows the lanky legs to support the animal&#x27;s great weight. The hooves of large male giraffes reach in diameter. The fetlock of the leg is low to the ground, allowing the hoof to better support the animal&#x27;s weight. Giraffes lack dewclaws and interdigital glands. While the pelvis is relatively short, the ilium has stretched-out crests.

A giraffe has only two gaits: walking and galloping. Walking is done by moving the legs on one side of the body, then doing the same on the other side. When galloping, the hind legs move around the front legs before the latter move forward, and the tail will curl up. The movements of the head and neck provide balance and control momentum while galloping. The giraffe can reach a sprint speed of up to , and can sustain for several kilometres. Giraffes would probably not be competent swimmers as their long legs would be highly cumbersome in the water, although they might be able to float. When swimming, the thorax would be weighed down by the front legs, making it difficult for the animal to move its neck and legs in harmony or keep its head above the water&#x27;s surface.

A giraffe rests by lying with its body on top of its folded legs. To lie down, the animal kneels on its front legs and then lowers the rest of its body. To get back up, it first gets on its front knees and positions its backside on top of its hindlegs. It then pulls the backside upwards, and the front legs stand straight up again. At each stage, the animal swings its head for balance. If the giraffe wants to reach down to drink, it either spreads its front legs or bends its knees. Studies in captivity found the giraffe sleeps intermittently around 4.6 hours per day, mostly at night. It usually sleeps lying down; however, standing sleeps have been recorded, particularly in older individuals. Intermittent short &quot;deep sleep&quot; phases while lying are characterised by the giraffe bending its neck backwards and resting its head on the hip or thigh, a position believed to indicate paradoxical sleep.

===Internal systems===
In mammals, the left recurrent laryngeal nerve is longer than the right; in the giraffe, it is over longer. These nerves are longer in the giraffe than in any other living animal; the left nerve is over long. Each nerve cell in this path begins in the brainstem and passes down the neck along the vagus nerve, then branches off into the recurrent laryngeal nerve which passes back up the neck to the larynx. Thus, these nerve cells have a length of nearly in the largest giraffes. Despite its long neck and large skull, the brain of the giraffe is typical for an ungulate. Evaporative heat loss in the nasal passages keep the giraffe&#x27;s brain cool. The shape of the skeleton gives the giraffe a small lung volume relative to its mass. Its long neck gives it a large amount of dead space, in spite of its narrow windpipe. The giraffe also has a high tidal volume, so the balance of dead space and tidal volume is much the same as other mammals. The animal can still provide enough oxygen for its tissues, and it can increase its respiratory rate and oxygen diffusion when running.

The giraffe&#x27;s circulatory system has several adaptations to compensate for its great height. Its and heart must generate approximately double the blood pressure required for a human to maintain blood flow to the brain. As such, the wall of the heart can be as thick as . Giraffes have relatively high heart rates for their size, at 150 beats per minute. When the animal lowers its head, the blood rushes down fairly unopposed and a rete mirabile in the upper neck, with its large cross-sectional area, prevents excess blood flow to the brain. When it raises again, the blood vessels constrict and push blood into the brain so the animal does not faint. The jugular veins contain several (most commonly seven) valves to prevent blood flowing back into the head from the inferior vena cava and right atrium while the head is lowered. Conversely, the blood vessels in the lower legs are under great pressure because of the weight of fluid pressing down on them. To solve this problem, the skin of the lower legs is thick and tight, preventing too much blood from pouring into them.

Giraffes have oesophageal muscles that are strong enough to allow regurgitation of food from the stomach up the neck and into the mouth for . They have four-chambered stomachs, which are adapted to their specialized diet. The intestines of an adult giraffe measure more than in length and have a relatively small ratio of small to large intestine. The giraffe has a small, compact liver. In fetuses there may be a small gallbladder that vanishes before birth.

==Behaviour and ecology==

===Habitat and feeding===

Giraffes usually inhabit savannahs and open woodlands. They prefer areas dominated by Acacieae, &quot;Commiphora&quot;, &quot;Combretum&quot; and &quot;Terminalia&quot; tree over &quot;Brachystegia&quot; which are more densely spaced. The Angolan giraffe can be found in desert environments. Giraffes browse on the twigs of trees, preferring those of the subfamily Acacieae and the genera &quot;Commiphora&quot; and &quot;Terminalia&quot;, which are important sources of calcium and protein to sustain the giraffe&#x27;s growth rate. They also feed on shrubs, grass and fruit. A giraffe eats around of plant matter daily. When stressed, giraffes may chew on large branches, stripping them of bark. Giraffes are also recorded to chew old bones.

During the wet season, food is abundant and giraffes are more spread out, while during the dry season, they gather around the remaining evergreen trees and bushes. Mothers tend to feed in open areas, presumably to make it easier to detect predators, although this may reduce their feeding efficiency. As a ruminant, the giraffe first chews its food, then swallows it for processing and then visibly passes the half-digested cud up the neck and back into the mouth to chew again. The giraffe requires less food than many other herbivores because the foliage it eats has more concentrated nutrients and it has a more efficient digestive system. The animal&#x27;s faeces come in the form of small pellets. When it has access to water, a giraffe will go no more than three days without drinking.

Giraffes have a great effect on the trees that they feed on, delaying the growth of young trees for some years and giving &quot;waistlines&quot; to particularly tall trees. Feeding is at its highest during the first and last hours of daytime. Between these hours, giraffes mostly stand and ruminate. Rumination is the dominant activity during the night, when it is mostly done lying down.

===Social life===

Giraffes usually form groups that vary in size and composition according to ecological, anthropogenic, temporal, and social factors. Traditionally, the composition of these groups had been described as open and ever-changing. For research purposes, a &quot;group&quot; has been defined as &quot;a collection of individuals that are less than a kilometre apart and moving in the same general direction&quot;. More recent studies have found that giraffes have long-lasting social groups or cliques based on kinship, sex or other factors, and these groups regularly associate with other groups in larger communities or sub-communities within a fission–fusion society. Proximity to humans can disrupt social arrangements. Masai giraffes in Tanzania sort themselves into different subpopulations of 60–90 adult females with overlapping ranges, each of which differ in reproductive rates and calf mortality. Dispersal is male biased, and can include spatial and/or social dispersal. Adult female subpopulations are connected by males into super communities of around 300 animals.
The number of giraffes in a group can range from one up to 66 individuals. Giraffe groups tend to be sex-segregated although mixed-sex groups made of adult females and young males also occur. Female groups may be matrilineally related. Generally, females are more selective than males when deciding which individuals of the same sex they associate with. Particularly stable giraffe groups are those made of mothers and their young, which can last weeks or months. Young males also form groups and will engage in playfights. However, as they get older, males become more solitary but may also associate in pairs or with female groups. Giraffes are not territorial, but they have home ranges that vary according to rainfall and proximity to human settlements. Male giraffes occasionally roam far from areas that they normally frequent.

Early biologists suggested giraffes were mute and unable to create enough air flow to vibrate their vocal folds. This has been proved to the contrary; they have been recorded to communicate using snorts, sneezes, coughs, snores, hisses, bursts, moans, grunts, growls and flute-like sounds. During courtship, males emit loud coughs. Females call their young by bellowing. Calves will emit bleats, mooing and mewing sounds. Snorting and hissing is associated with vigilance. During nighttime, giraffes appear to hum to each other. There is some evidence that giraffes use Helmholtz resonance to create infrasound. They also communicate with body language. Dominant males display to other males with an erect posture; holding the chin and head up while walking stiffly and displaying their side. The less dominant show submissiveness by dropping the head and ears, lowering the chin and fleeing.

===Reproduction and parental care===

Reproduction in giraffes is broadly polygamous: a few older males mate with the fertile females. Females can reproduce throughout the year and experience oestrus cycling approximately every 15 days. Female giraffes in oestrus are dispersed over space and time, so reproductive adult males adopt a strategy of roaming among female groups to seek mating opportunities, with periodic hormone-induced rutting behaviour approximately every two weeks. Males prefer young adult females over juveniles and older adults.

Male giraffes assess female fertility by tasting the female&#x27;s urine to detect oestrus, in a multi-step process known as the flehmen response. Once an oestrous female is detected, the male will attempt to court her. When courting, dominant males will keep subordinate ones at bay. A courting male may lick a female&#x27;s tail, lay his head and neck on her body or nudge her with his ossicones. During copulation, the male stands on his hind legs with his head held up and his front legs resting on the female&#x27;s sides.

Giraffe gestation lasts 400–460 days, after which a single calf is normally born, although twins occur on rare occasions. The mother gives birth standing up. The calf emerges head and front legs first, having broken through the fetal membranes, and falls to the ground, severing the umbilical cord. A newborn giraffe is tall. Within a few hours of birth, the calf can run around and is almost indistinguishable from a one-week-old. However, for the first one to three weeks, it spends most of its time hiding, its coat pattern providing camouflage. The ossicones, which have lain flat in the womb, raise up in a few days.

Mothers with calves will gather in nursery herds, moving or browsing together. Mothers in such a group may sometimes leave their calves with one female while they forage and drink elsewhere. This is known as a &quot;calving pool&quot;. Calves are at risk of predation, and a mother giraffe will stand over them and kick at an approaching predator. Females watching calving pools will only alert their own young if they detect a disturbance, although the others will take notice and follow. Allo-sucking, where a calf will suckle a female other than its mother, has been recorded in both wild and captive giraffes. Calves first ruminate at four to six months and stop nursing at six to eight months. Young may not reach independence until they are 14 months old. Females are able to reproduce at four years of age, while spermatogenesis in males begins at three to four years of age. Males must wait until they are at least seven years old to gain the opportunity to mate.
===Necking===

Male giraffes use their necks as weapons in combat, a behaviour known as &quot;necking&quot;. Necking is used to establish dominance, and males that win necking bouts have greater reproductive success. This behaviour occurs at low or high intensity. In low-intensity necking, the combatants rub and lean on each other. The male that can keep itself more upright wins the bout. In high-intensity necking, the combatants will spread their front legs and swing their necks at each other, attempting to land blows with their ossicones. The contestants will try to dodge each other&#x27;s blows and then prepare to counter. The power of a blow depends on the weight of the skull and the arc of the swing. A necking duel can last more than half an hour, depending on how well matched the combatants are. Although most fights do not lead to serious injury, there have been records of broken jaws, broken necks, and even deaths.

After a duel, it is common for two male giraffes to caress and court each other. Such interactions between males have been found to be more frequent than heterosexual coupling. In one study, up to 94 percent of observed mounting incidents took place between males. The proportion of same-sex activities varied from 30 to 75 percent. Only one percent of same-sex mounting incidents occurred between females.

===Mortality and health===

Giraffes have high adult survival probability, and an unusually long lifespan compared to other ruminants, up to 38 years. Adult female survival is significantly correlated with the number of social associations. Because of their size, eyesight and powerful kicks, adult giraffes are mostly safe from predation, with lions being their only major threats. Calves are much more vulnerable than adults and are also preyed on by leopards, spotted hyenas and wild dogs. A quarter to a half of giraffe calves reach adulthood. Calf survival varies according to the season of birth, with calves born during the dry season having higher survival rates.

The local, seasonal presence of large herds of migratory wildebeests and zebras reduces predation pressure on giraffe calves and increases their survival probability. In turn, it has been suggested that other ungulates may benefit from associating with giraffes, as their height allows them to spot predators from further away. Zebras were found to assess predation risk by watching giraffes and spend less time looking around when giraffes are present.

Some parasites feed on giraffes. They are often hosts for ticks, especially in the area around the genitals, which have thinner skin than other areas. Tick species that commonly feed on giraffes are those of genera &quot;Hyalomma&quot;, &quot;Amblyomma&quot; and &quot;Rhipicephalus&quot;. Red-billed and yellow-billed oxpeckers clean giraffes of ticks and alert them to danger. Giraffes host numerous species of internal parasites and are susceptible to various diseases. They were victims of the (now eradicated) viral illness rinderpest. Giraffes can also suffer from a skin disorder, which comes in the form of wrinkles, lesions or raw fissures. As much as 79% of giraffes have symptoms of the disease in Ruaha National Park, but it did not cause mortality in Tarangire and is less prevalent in areas with fertile soils.

==Human relations==
===Cultural significance===
With its lanky build and spotted coat, the giraffe has been a source of fascination throughout human history, and its image is widespread in culture. It has represented flexibility, far-sightedness, femininity, fragility, passivity, grace, beauty and the continent of Africa itself.

Giraffes were depicted in art throughout the African continent, including that of the Kiffians, Egyptians, and Kushites. The Kiffians were responsible for a life-size rock engraving of two giraffes, dated 8,000 years ago, that has been called the &quot;world&#x27;s largest rock art petroglyph&quot;. How the giraffe got its height has been the subject of various African folktales. The Tugen people of modern Kenya used the giraffe to depict their god Mda. Judging from evidence including incised clay pots, archaeologists now believe that, in the ancient Kushite societies located in Nubia, or what is now northern Sudan, giraffes may have featured in popular religion and women&#x27;s religion, though not in elite or royal religion, and may have also had a connection to beliefs about the sun. The Egyptians gave the giraffe its own hieroglyph; &#x27;sr&#x27; in Old Egyptian and &#x27;mmy&#x27; in later periods.

Giraffes have a presence in modern Western culture. Salvador Dalí depicted them with burning manes in some surrealist paintings. Dali considered the giraffe to be a masculine symbol. A flaming giraffe was meant to be a &quot;masculine cosmic apocalyptic monster&quot;. Several children&#x27;s books feature the giraffe, including David A. Ufer&#x27;s &quot;The Giraffe Who Was Afraid of Heights&quot;, Giles Andreae&#x27;s &quot;Giraffes Can&#x27;t Dance&quot; and Roald Dahl&#x27;s &quot;The Giraffe and the Pelly and Me&quot;. Giraffes have appeared in animated films as minor characters in Disney&#x27;s &quot;Dumbo&quot; and &quot;The Lion King&quot;, and in more prominent roles in &quot;The Wild&quot; and the &quot;Madagascar&quot; films. Sophie the Giraffe has been a popular teether since 1961. Another famous fictional giraffe is the Toys &quot;R&quot; Us mascot Geoffrey the Giraffe.

The giraffe has also been used for some scientific experiments and discoveries. Scientists have used the properties of giraffe skin as a model for astronaut and fighter pilot suits because the people in these professions are in danger of passing out if blood rushes to their legs. Computer scientists have modeled the coat patterns of several subspecies using reaction–diffusion mechanisms. The constellation of Camelopardalis, introduced in the 17th century, depicts a giraffe. The Tswana people of Botswana traditionally see the constellation Crux as two giraffes—Acrux and Mimosa forming a male, and Gacrux and Delta Crucis forming the female.
===Captivity===
The Egyptians were among the earliest people to keep giraffes in captivity and shipped them around the Mediterranean. The giraffe was among the many animals collected and displayed by the Romans. The first one in Rome was brought in by Julius Caesar in 46 BC. With the fall of the Western Roman Empire, the housing of giraffes in Europe declined. During the Middle Ages, giraffes were known to Europeans through contact with the Arabs, who revered the giraffe for its peculiar appearance.

Individual captive giraffes were given celebrity status throughout history. In 1414, a giraffe from Malindi was taken to China by explorer Zheng He and placed in a Ming dynasty zoo. The animal was a source of fascination for the Chinese people, who associated it with the mythical Qilin. The Medici giraffe was a giraffe presented to Lorenzo de&#x27; Medici in 1486. It caused a great stir on its arrival in Florence. Zarafa, another famous giraffe, was brought from Egypt to Paris in the early 19th century as a gift for Charles X of France. A sensation, the giraffe was the subject of numerous memorabilia or &quot;giraffanalia&quot;.

Giraffes have become popular attractions in modern zoos, though keeping them is difficult as they prefer large areas and need to eat large amounts of browse. Captive giraffes in North America and Europe appear to have a higher mortality rate than in the wild, the most common causes being poor husbandry, nutrition, and management. Giraffes in zoos display stereotypical behaviours, particularly the licking of inanimate objects and pacing. Zookeepers may offer various activities to stimulate giraffes, including training them to take food from visitors. Stables for giraffes are built particularly high to accommodate their height.

===Exploitation===
Giraffes were probably common targets for hunters throughout Africa. Different parts of their bodies were used for different purposes. Their meat was used for food. The tail hairs were flyswatters, bracelets, necklaces, and threads. Shields, sandals, and drums were made using the skin, and the strings of musical instruments were from the tendons. In Buganda, the smoke of burning giraffe skin was traditionally used to treat nosebleeds. The Humr people of Kordofan consume the drink Umm Nyolokh, which is prepared from the liver and bone marrow of giraffes. Richard Rudgley hypothesised that Umm Nyolokh might contain DMT. The drink is said to cause hallucinations of giraffes, believed to be the giraffes&#x27; ghosts, by the Humr.

==Conservation status==
In 2016, giraffes were assessed as Vulnerable from a conservation perspective by the IUCN. In 1985, it was estimated there were 155,000 giraffes in the wild. This declined to over 140,000 in 1999. Estimates as of 2016 indicate there are approximately 97,500 members of &quot;Giraffa&quot; in the wild. The Masai and reticulated subspecies are endangered, and the Rothschild subspecies is near threatened. The Nubian subspecies is critically endangered.

The primary causes for giraffe population declines are habitat loss and direct killing for bushmeat markets. Giraffes have been extirpated from much of their historic range, including Eritrea, Guinea, Mauritania and Senegal. They may also have disappeared from Angola, Mali, and Nigeria, but have been introduced to Rwanda and Eswatini. , there were more than 1,600 in captivity at Species360-registered zoos. Habitat destruction has hurt the giraffe. In the Sahel, the need for firewood and grazing room for livestock has led to deforestation. Normally, giraffes can coexist with livestock, since they avoid direct competition by feeding above them. In 2017, severe droughts in northern Kenya led to increased tensions over land and the killing of wildlife by herders, with giraffe populations being particularly hit.

Protected areas like national parks provide important habitat and anti-poaching protection to giraffe populations. Community-based conservation efforts outside national parks are also effective at protecting giraffes and their habitats. Private game reserves have contributed to the preservation of giraffe populations in eastern and southern Africa. The giraffe is a protected species in most of its range. It is the national animal of Tanzania, and is protected by law, and unauthorised killing can result in imprisonment. The UN-backed Convention of Migratory Species selected giraffes for protection in 2017. In 2019, giraffes were listed under Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES), which means international trade including in parts/derivatives is regulated.

Translocations are sometimes used to augment or re-establish diminished or extirpated populations, but these activities are risky and difficult to undertake using the best practices of extensive pre- and post-translocation studies and ensuring a viable founding population. Aerial survey is the most common method of monitoring giraffe population trends in the vast roadless tracts of African landscapes, but aerial methods are known to undercount giraffes. Ground-based survey methods are more accurate and can be used in conjunction with aerial surveys to make accurate estimates of population sizes and trends.

<text>Griffith&#x27;s experiment, performed by Frederick Griffith and reported in 1928, was the first experiment suggesting that bacteria are capable of transferring genetic information through a process known as transformation. Griffith&#x27;s findings were followed by research in the late 1930s and early 40s that isolated DNA as the material that communicated this genetic information.

Pneumonia was a serious cause of death in the wake of the post-WWI Spanish influenza pandemic, and Griffith was studying the possibility of creating a vaccine. Griffith used two strains of pneumococcus (&quot;Diplococcus pneumoniae&quot;) bacteria which infect mice – a type III-S (smooth) which was virulent, and a type II-R (rough) strain which was nonvirulent. The III-S strain synthesized a polysaccharide capsule that protected itself from the host&#x27;s immune system, resulting in the death of the host, while the II-R strain did not have that protective capsule and was defeated by the host&#x27;s immune system. A German bacteriologist, Fred Neufeld, had discovered the three pneumococcal types (Types I, II, and III) and discovered the quellung reaction to identify them &quot;in vitro&quot;. Until Griffith&#x27;s experiment, bacteriologists believed that the types were fixed and unchangeable, from one generation to another.

In this experiment, bacteria from the III-S strain were killed by heat, and their remains were added to II-R strain bacteria. While neither alone harmed the mice, the combination was able to kill its host. Griffith was also able to isolate both live II-R and live III-S strains of pneumococcus from the blood of these dead mice. Griffith concluded that the type II-R had been &quot;transformed&quot; into the lethal III-S strain by a &quot;transforming principle&quot; that was somehow part of the dead III-S strain bacteria.

Scientific advances since then have revealed that the &quot;transforming principle&quot; Griffith observed was the DNA of the III-s strain bacteria. While the bacteria had been killed, the DNA had survived the heating process and was taken up by the II-R strain bacteria. The III-S strain DNA contains the genes that form the smooth protective polysaccharide capsule. Equipped with this gene, the former II-R strain bacteria were now protected from the host&#x27;s immune system and could kill the host. The exact nature of the transforming principle (DNA) was verified in the experiments done by Avery, McLeod and McCarty and by Hershey and Chase.

<doc id="12719" wikidata="Q468473" url="?curid=12719" title="Gustave de Molinari">
<text>Gustave de Molinari (; 3 March 1819 – 28 January 1912) was a Belgian political economist and French Liberal School theorist associated with French &quot;laissez-faire&quot; economists such as Frédéric Bastiat and Hippolyte Castille.

== Biography ==
Born in Liège, Wallonia, Molinari&#x27;s critique of the state sometimes resulted in his opposing causes and events which might seemingly be aligned with his overall critique of power and privilege. An example of this was the American Civil War which Molinari believed to be far more about the trade interests of Northern industrialists than about slavery, although he did not deny that abolitionism was a part of the picture. According to Ralph Raico, Molinari never relented in his last work published a year before his death in 1912, writing:
The American Civil War had not been simply a humanitarian crusade to free the slaves. The war &quot;ruined the conquered provinces,&quot; but the Northern plutocrats pulling the strings achieved their aim: the imposition of a vicious protectionism that led ultimately &quot;to the regime of trusts and produced the billionaires.&quot;

Molinari supported his liberal views by citing evolutionary concepts, claiming that the &quot;economic state&quot; (an international commercial system) would have a complete laissez-faire. He argued this was the ultimate stage of social evolution, caused by a struggle for existence between competing commercial actors. War has been the driver of early social systems, he felt, which encouraged invention as a result. After industry developed, however, wars grew detrimental rather than beneficial, replaced with economic competition. Molinari felt this would be better, since it applied to all classes in society. As the less fit were eliminated by competition, the entire society would be raised over time. He argued competition like this would never end, but continue forever. Molinari opposed both monarchy and socialism as a result of being detrimental to this process. Acknowledging that great poverty had risen in tandem with wealth, he argued it would be eliminated through moral evolution occurring alongside the economic progress, which was necessary for it.

== Influence ==
Some anarcho-capitalists consider Molinari to be the first proponent of anarcho-capitalism. In the preface to the 1977 English translation by Murray Rothbard called &quot;The Production of Security&quot; the &quot;first presentation anywhere in human history of what is now called anarcho-capitalism&quot;, although admitting that &quot;Molinari did not use the terminology, and probably would have balked at the name&quot;. Austrian School economist Hans-Hermann Hoppe said that &quot;the 1849 article &#x27;The Production of Security&#x27; is probably the single most important contribution to the modern theory of anarcho-capitalism&quot;. In the past, Molinari influenced some of the political thoughts of individualist anarchist Benjamin Tucker and the &quot;Liberty&quot; circle. The Molinari Institute directed by philosopher Roderick T. Long is named after him, whom it terms the &quot;originator of the theory of Market Anarchism&quot;.

<doc id="12720" wikidata="Q80895" url="?curid=12720" title="Guerrilla warfare">
<text>Guerrilla warfare is a form of unconventional warfare in which small groups of irregular military, such as rebels, partisans, paramilitary personnel or armed civilians, including recruited children, use ambushes, sabotage, terrorism, raids, petty warfare or hit-and-run tactics in a rebellion, in a violent conflict, in a war or in a civil war to fight against regular military, police or rival insurgent forces.

Although the term &quot;guerrilla warfare&quot; was coined in the context of the Peninsular War in the 19th century, the tactical methods of guerrilla warfare have long been in use. In the 6th century BC, Sun Tzu proposed the use of guerrilla-style tactics in &quot;The Art of War&quot;. The 3rd century BC Roman general Quintus Fabius Maximus Verrucosus is also credited with inventing many of the tactics of guerrilla warfare through what is today called the Fabian strategy, and in China Peng Yue is also often regarded as the inventor of guerrilla warfare. Guerrilla warfare has been used by various factions throughout history and is particularly associated with revolutionary movements and popular resistance against invading or occupying armies.

Guerrilla tactics focus on avoiding head-on confrontations with enemy armies, typically due to inferior arms or forces, and instead engage in limited skirmishes with the goal of exhausting adversaries and forcing them to withdraw (see also attrition warfare). Organized guerrilla groups often depend on the support of either the local population or foreign backers who sympathize with the guerrilla group&#x27;s efforts.

== Etymology ==

The Spanish word is the diminutive form of (&quot;war&quot;); hence, &quot;little war&quot;. The term became popular during the early-19th century Peninsular War, when, after the defeat of their regular armies, the Spanish and Portuguese people successfully rose against the Napoleonic troops and defeated a highly superior army using the guerrilla strategy in combination with a scorched earth policy and people&#x27;s war (see also attrition warfare against Napoleon). In correct Spanish usage, a person who is a member of a unit is a () if male, or a () if female. Arthur Wellesley adopted the term &quot;guerrilla&quot; into English from Spanish usage in 1809, to refer to the individual &quot;fighters&quot; (e.g., &quot;I have recommended to set the Guerrillas to work&quot;), and also (as in Spanish) to denote &quot;a group or band&quot; of such fighters. However, in most languages &quot;guerrilla&quot; still denotes a specific style of warfare. The use of the diminutive evokes the differences in number, scale, and scope between the guerrilla army and the formal, professional army of the state.

==History==


Prehistoric tribal warriors presumably employed guerrilla-style tactics against enemy tribes:
Evidence of conventional warfare, on the other hand, did not emerge until 3100 BC in Egypt and Mesopotamia. The Chinese general and strategist Sun Tzu, in his &quot;The Art of War&quot; (6th century BC), became one of the earliest to propose the use of guerrilla warfare. This inspired developments in modern guerrilla warfare.

In the 3rd century BC, Quintus Fabius Maximus Verrucosus, used elements of guerrilla warfare, such as the evasion of battle, the attempt to wear down the enemy, to attack small detachments in an ambush and devised the Fabian strategy, which the Roman Republic used to great effect against Hannibal&#x27;s army, see also &quot;His Excellency : George Washington&quot;: the Fabian choice. The Roman general Quintus Sertorius is also noted for his skillful use of guerrilla warfare during his revolt against the Roman Senate. In China, Han dynasty general Peng Yue is often regarded as the inventor of guerrilla warfare due to his use of irregular warfare in the Chu-Han contention to attack Chu convoys and supplies.

In the Byzantine Empire, guerrilla warfare was frequently practiced between the eighth through tenth centuries along the eastern frontier with the Umayyad and then Abbasid caliphates. Tactics involved a heavy emphasis on reconnaissance and intelligence, shadowing the enemy, evacuating threatened population centres, and attacking when the enemy dispersed to raid. In the later tenth century this form of warfare was codified in a military manual known by its later Latin name as &quot;De velitatione bellica&quot; (&#x27;On Skirmishing&#x27;) so it would not be forgotten in the future.

The Normans often made many forays into Wales, where the Welsh used the mountainous region, which the Normans were unfamiliar with, to spring surprise attacks upon them.

Since the Enlightenment, ideologies such as nationalism, liberalism, socialism, and religious fundamentalism have played an important role in shaping insurgencies and guerrilla warfare.

In the 17th century, Chatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, founder of the Maratha Kingdom, pioneered the &quot;Shiva sutra&quot; or &quot;Ganimi Kava&quot; (Guerrilla Tactics) to defeat the many times larger and more powerful armies of the Mughal Empire.

Kerala Varma (Pazhassi Raja) (1753–1805) used guerrilla techniques chiefly centred in mountain forests in the Cotiote War against the British East India Company in India between 1793 and 1806. Arthur Wellesley (in India 1797–1805) had commanded forces assigned to defeat Pazhassi&#x27;s techniques but failed. It was the longest war waged by East India Company during their military campaigns on the Indian subcontinent. It was one of the bloodiest and hardest wars waged by East India Company in India with Presidency army regiments that suffered losses as high as eighty percent in 10 years of warfare.
The Dominican Restoration War was a guerrilla war between 1863 and 1865 in the Dominican Republic between nationalists and Spain, the latter of which had recolonized the country 17 years after its independence. The war resulted in the withdrawal of Spanish forces and the establishment of a second republic in the Dominican Republic.
The Moroccan military leader Abd el-Krim ( – 1963) and his father unified the Moroccan tribes under their control and took up arms against the Spanish and French occupiers during the Rif War in 1920. For the first time in history, tunnel warfare was used alongside modern guerrilla tactics, which caused considerable damage to both the colonial armies in Morocco.

In the early 20th century Michael Collins and Tom Barry both developed many tactical features of guerrilla warfare during the guerrilla phase of the 1919–1921 Irish War of Independence. Collins developed mainly urban guerrilla warfare tactics in Dublin City (the Irish capital). Operations in which small Irish Republican Army (IRA) units (3 to 6 guerrillas) quickly attacked a target and then disappeared into civilian crowds frustrated the British enemy. The best example of this occurred on Bloody Sunday (21 November 1920), when Collins&#x27;s assassination unit, known as &quot;The Squad&quot;, wiped out a group of British intelligence agents (&quot;the Cairo Gang&quot;) early in the morning (14 were killed, six were wounded) – some regular officers were also killed in the purge. That afternoon, the Royal Irish Constabulary force consisting of both regular RIC personnel and the Auxiliary Division took revenge, shooting into a crowd at a football match in Croke Park, killing fourteen civilians and injuring 60 others.

In West County Cork, Tom Barry was the commander of the IRA West Cork brigade. Fighting in west Cork was rural, and the IRA fought in much larger units than their fellows in urban areas. These units, called &quot;flying columns&quot;, engaged British forces in large battles, usually for between 10 – 30 minutes. The Kilmichael Ambush in November 1920 and the Crossbarry Ambush in March 1921 are the most famous examples of Barry&#x27;s flying columns causing large casualties to enemy forces.

The Algerian Revolution of 1954 started with a handful of Algerian guerrillas. Primitively armed, the guerrillas fought the French for over eight years. This remains a prototype for modern insurgency and counterinsurgency, terrorism, torture, and asymmetric warfare prevalent throughout the world today. In South Africa, African National Congress (ANC) members studied the Algerian War, prior to the release and apotheosis of Nelson Mandela; in their intifada against Israel, Palestinian fighters have sought to emulate it. Additionally, the tactics of Al-Qaeda closely resemble those of the Algerians.

The Mukti Bahini (Bengali: মুক্তিবাহিনী, translates as &quot;freedom fighters&quot;, or liberation army), also known as the Bangladesh Forces, was the guerrilla resistance movement consisting of the Bangladeshi military, paramilitary and civilians during the Bangladesh Liberation War that transformed East Pakistan into Bangladesh in 1971. An earlier name Mukti Fauj was also used.

==Theoretical works==
The growth of guerrilla warfare was inspired in part by theoretical works on guerrilla warfare, starting with the &quot;Manual de Guerra de Guerrillas&quot; by Matías Ramón Mella written in the 19th century:

More recently, Mao Zedong&#x27;s &quot;On Guerrilla Warfare&quot;, Che Guevara&#x27;s &quot;Guerrilla Warfare&quot;, and Lenin&#x27;s &quot;Guerrilla warfare&quot;, were all written after the successful revolutions carried out by them in China, Cuba and Russia, respectively. Those texts characterized the tactic of guerrilla warfare as, according to Che Guevara&#x27;s text, being &quot;used by the side which is supported by a majority but which possesses a much smaller number of arms for use in defense against oppression&quot;.

=== Foco theory ===


In the 1960s, the Marxist revolutionary Che Guevara developed the &quot;foco&quot; () theory of revolution in his book &quot;Guerrilla Warfare&quot;, based on his experiences during the 1959 Cuban Revolution. This theory was later formalized as &quot;focal-ism&quot; by Régis Debray. Its central principle is that vanguardism by cadres of small, fast-moving paramilitary groups can provide a focus for popular discontent against a sitting regime, and thereby lead a general insurrection. Although the original approach was to mobilize and launch attacks from rural areas, many &quot;foco&quot; ideas were adapted into urban guerrilla warfare movements.

== Strategy, tactics and methods ==


=== Strategy ===
Guerrilla warfare is a type of asymmetric warfare: competition between opponents of unequal strength. It is also a type of irregular warfare: that is, it aims not simply to defeat an invading enemy, but to win popular support and political influence, to the enemy&#x27;s cost. Accordingly, guerrilla strategy aims to magnify the impact of a small, mobile force on a larger, more cumbersome one. If successful, guerrillas weaken their enemy by attrition, eventually forcing them to withdraw.

=== Tactics ===

Tactically, guerrillas usually avoid confrontation with large units and formations of enemy troops but seek and attack small groups of enemy personnel and resources to gradually deplete the opposing force while minimizing their own losses. The guerrilla prizes mobility, secrecy, and surprise, organizing in small units and taking advantage of terrain that is difficult for larger units to use. For example, Mao Zedong summarized basic guerrilla tactics at the beginning of the Chinese Civil War as:&quot;The enemy advances, we retreat; the enemy camps, we harass; the enemy tires, we attack; the enemy retreats, we pursue.&quot; At least one author credits the ancient Chinese work &quot;The Art of War&quot; with inspiring Mao&#x27;s tactics. In the 20th century, other communist leaders, including North Vietnamese Ho Chi Minh, often used and developed guerrilla warfare tactics, which provided a model for their use elsewhere, leading to the Cuban &quot;foco&quot; theory and the anti-Soviet Mujahadeen in Afghanistan.

=== Unconventional methods ===
Guerrilla groups may use improvised explosive devices and logistical support by the local population. The opposing army may come at last to suspect all civilians as potential guerrilla backers. The guerrillas might get political support from foreign backers and many guerrilla groups are adept at public persuasion through propaganda and use of force. Some guerrilla movements today also rely heavily on children as combatants, scouts, porters, spies, informants, and in other roles. Many governments and states also recruit children within their armed forces.
=== Comparison of guerrilla warfare and terrorism ===
No commonly accepted definition of &quot;terrorism&quot; has attained clear consensus. The term &quot;terrorism&quot; is often used as political propaganda by belligerents (most often by governments in power) to denounce opponents whose status as terrorists is disputed.

While the primary concern of guerrillas is the enemy&#x27;s active military units, actual terrorists largely are concerned with non-military agents and target mostly civilians.

==Weapons of guerrilla warfare==

Due to the fluid nature of irregular warfare, the weapons of guerrillas vary widely and reflect on the resources available to the unconventional force.
===Molotov cocktail===
The Molotov cocktail is a generic name used for a variety of improvised incendiary weapons. Due to the relative ease of production, they are frequently used by amateur protesters and non-professionally equipped fighters in urban guerrilla warfares. They are primarily intended to set targets ablaze rather than instantly destroy them. A Molotov cocktail is a breakable glass bottle containing a flammable substance such as gasoline/petrol or a napalm-like mixture, with some motor oil added, and usually a source of ignition such as a burning cloth wick held in place by the bottle&#x27;s stopper. The wick is usually soaked in alcohol or kerosene, rather than gasoline.
===Improvised explosive devices===

An improvised explosive device (IED), also known as a roadside bomb, is a homemade bomb constructed and deployed in ways other than in conventional military action. It may be constructed of conventional military explosives, such as an artillery round, attached to a detonating mechanism. IEDs may be used in terrorist actions or in unconventional warfare by guerrillas or commando forces in a theater of operations. In the second Iraq War, IEDs were used extensively against US-led Coalition forces and by the end of 2007 they had become responsible for approximately 63% of Coalition deaths in Iraq. They were also used in Afghanistan by insurgent groups, and caused over 66% of the Coalition casualties in the 2001–2021 Afghanistan War.

Throughout The Troubles, the Provisional IRA made extensive use of remote control IEDs against the British security forces. Initially, bombs were detonated either by timer or by simple command wire, but later in the conflict, bombs could be detonated by radio control; simple servos from radio-controlled aircraft were used to close the electrical circuit and supply power to the detonator. Roadside bombs were also extensively used; they were typically placed in a drain or culvert along a rural road and detonated by remote control when British security forces vehicles were passing. The IRA also used secondary devices to attack British reinforcements sent in after an initial blast as occurred in the Warrenpoint Ambush. IRA bombs became highly sophisticated, featuring anti-handling devices such as a mercury tilt switch or microswitches. These devices would detonate the bomb if it was moved in any way. Typically, the safety-arming device used was a clockwork Memopark timer, which armed the bomb up to 60 minutes after it was placed by completing an electrical circuit supplying power to the anti-handling device. Depending on the particular design, an independent electrical circuit supplied power to a conventional timer set for the intended time delay, e.g. 40 minutes. However, some electronic delays developed by IRA technicians could be set to accurately detonate a bomb weeks after it was hidden. After the British developed jammers, IRA technicians also developed devices that required a sequence of pulsed radio codes to arm and detonate them that were harder to jam.

Starting six months before the invasion of Afghanistan by the USSR on 27 December 1979, the Afghan mujahideen were supplied by the CIA, among others, with large quantities of many different types of anti-tank mines. The insurgents often removed the explosives from several anti-tank mines and combined the explosives in a tin cooking-oil can in order to ensure that a target vehicle would be destroyed. By combining the explosives from several mines and placing them in tin cans, the insurgents made them more powerful, but sometimes also easier to detect by Soviet sappers using mine detectors. After an IED was detonated, the insurgents often used direct-fire weapons such as machine guns and rocket-propelled grenades to initiate an ambush. Afghan insurgents also made IEDs from Soviet unexploded ordnance, such as 250-500 kg (500-1000) aerial bombs. The devices were triggered by a variety of methods, including remote control, pressure plates (some designed to detonate only after several vehicles drove over them), tripwires, pressure-release plates held down by roadblocks, and electrical cables that triggered only when the metal tracks of a tank or BMP drove over them; these devices were hidden under roads and mountain passes and inside water wells, abandoned caves and buildings. The Soviets responded by issuing soldiers with flak jackets, reinforcing and sandbagging the floors of their vehicles, and riding on top of vehicles instead of inside them, but casualties remained high, with 1,995 Soviet soldiers and 1,191 vehicles lost to mines and IEDs during the Soviet-Afghan War. 

During the First and Second Chechen Wars, the separatist Chechen Republic of Ichkeria made use of IEDs extensively against the Russian Armed Forces once they were forced to rely on guerrilla tactics, constructing them from a variety of materials such as 155mm artillery shells, 82mm mortar shells, unexploded ordnance and industrial explosives. These devices were usually command-detonated using an electrical command wire and hidden in sewer lines, piles of trash, destroyed vehicles, or placed directly on or under the surface or shoulder of a road, as well in trees or hillsides. Sometimes, insurgents combined antitank with antipersonnel devices, with one charge to target a vehicle, the other to target infantry dismounting from the vehicle. For propaganda purposes, IED teams often had a cameraman whose job was to record IED attacks and post it online. 

Since the 2001 invasion of Afghanistan, the Taliban and its supporters have used IEDs against NATO and Afghan military and civilian vehicles. This has become the most common method of attack against NATO forces, with IED attacks increasing consistently year on year; according to a report by the Homeland Security Market Research in the US, the number of IEDs used in Afghanistan had increased by 400 percent since 2007 and the number of troops killed by them by 400 percent, and those wounded by 700 percent. It has been reported that IEDs are the number one cause of death among NATO troops in Afghanistan.

Beginning in July 2003, the Iraqi insurgency used IEDs to target invading coalition vehicles. Many of these IEDs were made from military explosives looted from munitions bunkers following the 2003 invasion, such as landmines stripped of their explosives, 155-millimetre artillery shells rigged with blasting caps and modified aviation bombs of 500 lb or more, detonated by systems such as pull-wires and mechanical detonators, cell-phones, garage-door openers, cables, radio control (RC), and infrared lasers among others. To counter increasing armor protection, the insurgents have also developed IEDs that make use of explosively formed projectiles (EFPs); these are essentially cylindrical shaped charges usually constructed with a machined concave metal disc (often copper) facing the target, pointed inward. The force of the shaped charge turns the disc into a high velocity slug, capable of penetrating the armor of most enemy vehicles. Commonly positions for IEDs include on utility poles, road signs or trees, buried underground or in piles of garbage, disguised as rocks or bricks, and even inside dead animals. Typically they explode underneath or to the side of the vehicle, however, IEDs in elevated positions such as on road signs are able hit less protected areas. It has been estimated by the &quot;Washington Post&quot; that as much as 64% of U.S. deaths in Iraq occurred due to IEDs.

IEDs have also been used extensively by other groups, such as Maoists in India, ISIL in Syria and across the world, and by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in Sri Lanka.

===Acquiring conventional weapons===
====Legal civilian firearms====

Initial weapons of the guerrilla can include firearms that are legal for the civilian population to own. Depending on the country, these can range from muzzleloaders and double-barreled shotguns to bolt-action and semi-automatic rifles. These arms can either be legally purchased or stolen. In Cuba, Fidel Castro and his supporters used .22LR rifles in their attack on the Moncada Barracks.
====Captured enemy weapons====
Insurgencies have long made use of weapons stolen, captured or otherwise procured from enemy forces due to the ease of procuring them and their ammunition, something that is very important to an insurgency which will be poorly equipped and will need whatever weaponry it can get. Such weapons are typically acquired by either looting them from enemy soldiers that they have defeated, by having infiltrators and sympathisers in the enemy forces steal munitions and secretly supply it to them, by gathering munitions abandoned by retreating, advancing or neglectful enemy soldiers, or by purchasing munitions sold by enemy soldiers on the black market.

During World War II, firearms captured from the Axis powers were used extensively by resistance movements in Europe and the Pacific, due to their availability. These weapons were used alongside weapons supplied by the Allies and weapons inherited from their countries&#x27; previous militaries. Methods of acquiring weapons included purchasing them on the black market from Axis soldiers or their allies or stealing from German supply depots or transports. Special efforts were also made to capture weapons from the Axis, such as raids were conducted on trains and vehicles carrying equipment to the front, as well as on guardhouses and gendarmerie posts, that proved highly successful. Sometimes weapons were taken from individual Axis soldiers accosted in streets or were brought over by defecting Axis collaborators. During the Warsaw Uprising, the Polish Armia Krajowa (AK, Home Army) even managed to capture several German armored vehicles, most notably a Jagdpanzer 38 Hetzer light tank destroyer renamed &quot;Chwat&quot; and an Sd.Kfz. 251 armoured personnel carrier renamed &quot;Grey Wolf&quot;. Captured German weapons used by European resistance groups included the Karabiner 98k bolt-action rifle and MP 40 submachine gun, while resistance groups in the Pacific used captured Japanese weapons such as the Nambu pistol and Arisaka bolt-action rifle.

During the First Indochina War, the Indochinese Viet Minh used weapons abandoned by or captured from the Japanese during WWII, but also made use of weapons captured from the French and their French Indochina administration, such as the MAS-36 and MAS-49 rifles, MAT-49 submachine gun and the FM 24/29, Reibel, Vickers and Hotchkiss M1914, M1922 and M1929 machine guns.

Japanese and French weapons continued to see service with the Liberation Army of South Vietnam of the Viet Cong during the Vietnam War, with regular units using them during the early stages of the war, before they were passed down to militia units. They also used U.S-made weapons captured from the South Vietnamese Army of the Republic of Vietnam, such as M1911 pistols, Thompson and M3 submachine guns, M1 Garand rifles, M1 and M2 carbines and M1918 BAR and M1919 Browning machine guns, which they either captured in ambushes or raids or purchased off of the black market, the latter case being made possible by corrupt ARVN military officers illegally selling munitions for profit. Later in the war following the U.S intervention, more modern U.S weapons such as M14 and M16 rifles, M60 and M2 Browning machine guns and M79 grenade launchers were captured from U.S forces and the increasingly modernised ARVN.
====Plausible deniability and sanitized arms====
Plausible deniability allows the supply of arms by governments to insurgents without the need for over elaborate ruses. For instance, the sheer number of AKM (an upgraded version of the AK-47 rifle) manufacturers and users in the world means that governments can supply these weapons to insurgents with plausible deniability as to exactly from where and from whom the guns were acquired. The governments of nations with self-sufficient arms industries may intentionally remove identifying marks of their weapons for this purpose. For example, the Yugoslavian Zastava M48BO (for &quot;bez oznake&quot;, &#x27;without markings&#x27;) rifle was manufactured with no markings save for a serial number. These were made in Yugoslavia for delivery to Egypt prior to the Suez Crisis of 1956. Yugoslavia was technically a neutral country, and by sanitizing the rifles sold to the Egyptians, it hoped to distance itself from the conflict between Egypt and Israel. Only a few hundred of the few thousand made were delivered to Egypt, the rest remaining in storage in Yugoslavia until the post-Yugoslav states rediscovered them. They are currently being sold to civilian collectors. 

===Soviet Bloc weaponry===
Due to the massive exportation of weaponry by the Soviet Union and the Eastern Bloc to communist governments and insurgencies in foreign countries, as well as the production of Soviet-made weaponry by many militaries around the world, Soviet-made weapons and their copies are widely available, being present in most Third World countries throughout Asia, Africa and the Middle East. Of particular notability is the AK-47 assault rifle and its AKM variant which have seen service in almost every conflict since the Korean War in the militaries of Third World countries and insurgent groups due to its wide availability, simplicity, reliability, durability and ease of use, however they are just two of countless other types of Soviet World War II-era weapons, such as the TT pistol, Mosin–Nagant bolt-action rifle, PPSh-41 submachine gun, RPD and SG-43 Goryunov medium machine guns and DShK heavy machine gun, and Cold War-era weapons such as the AK-74 assault rifle, RPK light machine gun, PK general-purpose machine gun, SVD-63 Dragunov sniper rifle and RPG-2 and RPG-7 rocket launchers.

The first large-scale usage by an insurgency of the Kalashnikov series weapons was during the Vietnam War, when massive numbers of Soviet, Chinese and Eastern Bloc-produced AKs and RPKs, along with limited numbers of PKs and SVD-63s, were provided by communist countries to North Vietnam, which supplied them to the South Vietnamese Viet Cong, Laotian Pathet Lao and Cambodian Khmer Rouge. Due to the massive numbers of weapons that were supplied, they became the primary weapons of these groups and of the North Vietnamese army, replacing World War II-era French and Soviet-produced bolt-action rifles and submachine guns and supplanting weapons captured from U.S and South Vietnamese forces.
====Rocket-propelled grenades====

Rocket-propelled grenades (RPGs) were used extensively during the Vietnam War (by the Vietnam People&#x27;s Army and Viet Cong), Soviet invasion of Afghanistan by the Mujahideen and against South Africans in Angola and Namibia (formerly South West Africa) by SWAPO guerrillas during what the South Africans called the South African Border War. Twenty years later, they are still being used widely in recent conflict areas such as Chechnya, Iraq, and Sri Lanka.

The RPG still remains a potent threat to armored vehicles, especially in situations such as urban warfare or jungle warfare, where they are favored by guerrillas. They are most effective when used in restricted terrain as the availability of cover and concealment can make it difficult for the intended target to spot the RPG operator. Note that this concealment is often preferably outdoors, because firing an RPG within an enclosed area may create a dangerous backblast.

In Afghanistan, Mujahideen guerrilla fighters used RPG-7s to destroy Soviet vehicles. To assure a kill, two to four RPG shooters would be assigned to each vehicle. Each armored-vehicle hunter-killer team could have had as many as 15 RPGs per unit. In areas where vehicles were confined to a single path (a mountain road, swamps, snow, urban areas), RPG teams trapped convoys by destroying the first and last vehicles in line, preventing movement of the other vehicles. This tactic was especially effective in cities. Convoys learned to avoid approaches with overhangs and to send infantrymen forward in hazardous areas to detect the RPG teams. Multiple shooters were also effective against heavy tanks with reactive armor: The first shot would be against the driver&#x27;s viewing prisms. Following shots would be in pairs, one to set off the reactive armor, the second to penetrate the tank&#x27;s armor. Favored weak spots were the top and rear of the turret. 

The Mujahideen sometimes used RPG-7s at extreme range, exploded by their 4.5-second self-destruct timer, which translates to roughly 950m flight distance, as a method of long distance approach denial for enemy infantry and reconnaissance. 

In the period following the 2003 invasion of Iraq, the RPG became a favorite weapon of the insurgent forces fighting U.S. troops. Since most of the readily available RPG-7 rounds cannot penetrate M1 Abrams tank armor from almost any angle, it is primarily effective against soft-skinned or lightly armored vehicles, and infantry. Even if the RPG hit does not completely disable the tank or kill the crew, it can still damage external equipment, lowering the tank&#x27;s effectiveness or forcing the crew to abandon and destroy it. Newer RPG-7 rounds are more capable, and in August 2006, an RPG-29 round penetrated the frontal ERA of a Challenger 2 tank during an engagement in al-Amarah, Iraq, and wounded several crew members.

During the South African Border War, the Soviet RPGs used by SWAPO guerrillas and their Angolan supporters posed a serious threat to South Africa&#x27;s lightly armored APCs, which could be easily targeted as soon as they stopped to disembark troops. During the First (1994–1996) and Second Chechen Wars (1999–2009), Chechen rebels used RPGs to attack Russian tanks from basements and high rooftops. This tactic was effective because tank main guns could not be depressed or raised far enough to return fire, in addition, armor on the very top and bottom of tanks was usually the weakest. Russian forces had to rely on artillery suppression, good crew gunners and infantry screens to prevent such attacks. Tank columns were eventually protected by attached self-propelled anti-aircraft guns (ZSU-23-4 Shilka, 9K22 Tunguska) used in the ground role to suppress and destroy Chechen ambushes. Chechen fighters formed independent &quot;cells&quot; that worked together to destroy a specific Russian armored target. Each cell contained small arms and some form of RPG (RPG-7V or RPG-18, for example). The small arms were used to button the tank up and keep any infantry occupied, while the RPG gunner struck at the tank. While doing so, other teams would attempt to fire at the target in order to overwhelm the Russians&#x27; ability to effectively counter the attack. To further increase the chance of success, the teams took up positions at different elevations where possible. Firing from the third and higher floors allowed good shots at the weakest armor (the top). When the Russians began moving in tanks fitted with explosive reactive armor (ERA), the Chechens had to adapt their tactics, because the RPGs they had access to were unlikely to result in the destruction of the tank.

Using RPGs as improvised anti-aircraft batteries has proved successful in Somalia, Afghanistan and Chechnya. Helicopters are typically ambushed as they land, take off or hover. In Afghanistan, the Mujahideen often modified RPGs for use against Soviet helicopters by adding a curved pipe to the rear of the launcher tube, which diverted the backblast, allowing the RPG to be fired upward at aircraft from a prone position. This made the operator less visible prior to firing and decreased the risk of injury from hot exhaust gases. The Mujahideen also utilized the 4.5-second timer on RPG rounds to make the weapon function as part of a flak battery, using multiple launchers to increase hit probabilities. At the time, Soviet helicopters countered the threat from RPGs at landing zones by first clearing them with anti-personnel saturation fire. The Soviets also varied the number of accompanying helicopters (two or three) in an effort to upset Afghan force estimations and preparation. In response, the Mujahideen prepared dug-in firing positions with top cover, and again, Soviet forces altered their tactics by using air-dropped thermobaric fuel-air bombs on such landing zones. As the U.S.-supplied Stinger surface-to-air missiles became available to them, the Afghans abandoned RPG attacks as the smart missiles proved especially efficient in the destruction of unarmed Soviet transport helicopters, such as Mil Mi-17. In Somalia, both of the UH-60 Black Hawk helicopters lost by U.S. forces during the Battle of Mogadishu in 1993 were downed by RPG-7s.

===Homemade or improvised firearms===

The Błyskawica (Lightning) was a simple submachine gun produced by the Armia Krajowa, or Home Army, a Polish resistance movement fighting the Germans in occupied Poland. It was produced in underground workshops. Its main feature was its simplicity, so that the weapon could be made even in small workshops, by inexperienced engineers. It used threaded pipes for simplicity.

In some cases, guerrillas have used improvised, repurposed firearms. One example is described by Che Guevara in his book &quot;Guerrilla Warfare&quot;. Called the &quot;M-16&quot;, it consists of a 16 gauge sawed-off shotgun provided with a bipod to hold the barrel at a 45-degree angle. This was loaded with a blank cartridge formed by removing the shot from a standard shot shell, followed by a wooden rod with a Molotov cocktail attached to the front. This formed an improvised mortar capable of firing the incendiary device accurately out to a range of 100 meters.

Flare guns have also been converted to firearms. This may be accomplished by replacing the (often plastic) barrel of the flare gun with a metal pipe strong enough to chamber a shotgun shell, or by inserting a smaller bore barrel into the existing barrel (such as with a caliber conversion sleeve) to chamber a firearm cartridge, such as a .22 Long Rifle.

In the Myanmar Civil War, 3D-printed weapons such as the FGC-9 were seen in the hands of anti-military junta rebel forces. 

=== Purpose-designed weapons ===
A fairly recent class of firearms, purpose-designed insurgency weapons first appeared during World War II, in the form of such arms as the FP-45 Liberator and the Sten submachine gun. Designed to be inexpensive, since they were to be airdropped or smuggled behind enemy lines, insurgency weapons were designed for use by guerrilla and insurgent groups. Most insurgency weapons are of simple design, typically made of sheet steel stampings, which are then folded into shape and welded. Tubular steel in standard sizes is also used when possible, and barrels (one of the few firearm parts that require fine tolerances and high strength) may be rifled (like the Sten) or left smoothbore (like the FP-45).

The CIA Deer gun of the 1960s was similar to the Liberator, but used an aluminum casting for the body of the pistol, and was chambered in 9×19 mm Parabellum, one of the all-time most common handgun cartridges in the world. There is no known explanation for the name &quot;Deer Gun&quot;, but the Deer Gun was intended to be smuggled into Vietnam, attested by the instruction sheet printed in Vietnamese. It was produced by the American Machine &amp; Foundry Co., but was a &quot;sanitized&quot; weapon, meaning it lacked any marking identifying manufacturer or user. Details of the manufacture of insurgency weapons are almost always deliberately obscured by the governments making them, as in the designation of the FP-45 pistol.

Other insurgency weapons may be sanitized versions of traditional infantry or defensive weapons. These may be purpose-made without markings, or they may be standard commercial or military arms that have been altered to remove the manufacturers markings. Due to the covert nature of insurgency weapons, documenting their history is often difficult. Those that can legally be traded on the civilian market, like the Liberator pistol, will often command high prices; although millions of the pistols were made, few survived the war.

These examples are all arms that were either used as insurgency weapons or designed for such use. &quot;Purpose-built&quot; weapons were designed from the start to be used primarily for insurgent use, and are fairly crude, very inexpensive, and simple to operate; many were packaged with instructions targeted to speakers of certain languages, or pictorial instructions usable by illiterate users or speakers of any language. &quot;Dual-use&quot; weapons are those that were designed with special allowances for use by insurgent troops. &quot;Sanitized&quot; weapons are any arms that have been manufactured or altered to remove markings that indicate the point of origin. IEDs are improvised explosive devices.
The FP-45 Liberator was a single-shot .45 ACP derringer-type pistol, made by the U.S. during World War II. It was made from stamped steel with an unrifled barrel. The designation &quot;FP&quot; stood for &quot;flare projector&quot;, which was apparently an attempt to disguise the use of its intended purpose by obscuring the nature of the project. It was packed with ten rounds of ammunition and was intended to be used for assassinating enemy soldiers so that their weapons could then be captured and used by the insurgents. The instructions were pictorial, so that the gun could be distributed in any theatre of war, and used even by illiterate operators. The country in which the largest quantity was used was the Philippines.
The CIA Deer gun was a single-shot 9×19 mm Parabellum pistol, made by the U.S. during the Vietnam War. It was packaged with three rounds of ammunition in the grip and packed with instructions in a plastic box. If air-dropped into water, the plastic box containing the pistol would float. Like the earlier FP-45 Liberator, it was designed primarily for assassination of enemy soldiers, with the intention that it would be replaced by an enemy soldier&#x27;s left-over equipment. The instructions for the Deer Gun were pictorial, with text in Vietnamese.

Although various submachine guns were manufactured in Northern Ireland with &quot;Round Sections&quot; (Round shaped receivers) and &quot;Square Sections&quot; (Square shaped receivers), the Avenger submachine gun which was used by Loyalist Paramilitaries was considered one of the best designs for its type. The bolts were telescoping with a forward recoil/return spring with in the rear, a heavy coil spring that acts as a buffer increasing accuracy and recoil handling. The barrels were usually found lacking rifling but this can in some cases possibly increase ballistics at close quarters. It used Sten magazines and had the capabilities of adapting suppressors.

During the 1970s–80s, International Ordnance Group of San Antonio, Texas released the MP2 machine pistol. It was intended as a more compact alternative to the British Sten gun (although in its components and overall design have nothing directly similar to the STEN), to be used in urban guerrilla actions, to be manufactured cheaply and/or in less-than-well-equipped workshops and distributed to &quot;friendly&quot; undercover forces. Much like the previously mentioned FP-45 &quot;Liberator&quot; pistol of World War 2, it could be discarded during an escape with no substantial loss for the force&#x27;s arsenal. The MP2 is a blowback-operated weapon that fires from an open bolt with an extremely high rate of fire. A more common weapon of Guatemalan origin is the SM-9. Another example is the Métral submachine gun designed by Gerard Métral intended for manufacture during occupation and undercover circumstances.

A unique example is the Soviet S4M pistol, designed to be used expressly for the purpose of assassination. It was a simple break-open, two-shot derringer, but the unique features came from its specialized ammunition, designed around a cut-down version of the 7.62mm rounds used in the Soviet AK-47. The casings of the round contained a piston-like plunger between the bullet and the powder that would move forward inside the casing when fired. The piston would push the round down the barrel and plug the end of the casing, completely sealing off any explosive gases in the casing. This, combined with the inherently low-velocity round resulted in a truly silent pistol. The nature of the gun and ammunition led to it being wildly inaccurate outside of point-blank range. To add further confusion and throw possible suspicion away from the assassin, the barrel rifling was designed to affect the bullet in such a way that ballistics experts would not only conclude that the round was fired from an AK-47, but that the round was fired from several hundred feet away. Due to the politically devastating nature inherent in this design, the S4M was kept highly secret. Information on the pistol was not known by western governments until well after the end of the Cold War.
The Winchester Liberator is a 16-gauge, four-barrelled shotgun, similar to a scaled-up four-shot double-action derringer. It was an implementation of the Hillberg Insurgency Weapon design. Robert Hillberg, the designer, envisioned a weapon that was cheap to manufacture, easy to use, and provided a significant chance of being effective in the hands of someone who had never handled a firearm before. Pistols and submachine guns were eliminated from consideration due to the training required to use them effectively. The shotgun was chosen because it provided a high hit probability. Both Winchester and Colt built prototypes, although the Colt eight-shot design came late in the war and was adapted for the civilian law enforcement market. No known samples were ever produced for military use.
==== Dual-use weapons ====

Some purpose-designed insurgency weapons were designed for a dual use–that is for use by both insurgents and conventional soldiers. The Welrod pistol was a simple, bolt-action pistol developed by the SOE for use in World War II. It was designed for supplying to foreign British-aligned insurgents and for use by covert British forces. The pistol was designed with an integral sound suppressor, and was ideal for killing sentries and other covert work; the bolt-operated action meant that cocking the gun produced almost no noise, and the bulky but efficient suppressor eliminated nearly all of the muzzle blast. Welrod pistols included a magazine that doubled as a hand-grip, and were originally produced with no markings save a serial number.

The Sten was a 9×19 mm Parabellum submachine gun manufactured by the United Kingdom in World War II. Although not designed as an insurgency weapon, it was designed at a time when Britain had a dire need for weapons and was designed to be easily produced in basic machine shops and use a readily available round, it was therefore the ideal weapon to be produced by resistance groups in occupied territories. Towards the end of the war, the German were in need of weapons and they produced both a version of the Sten, the MP 3008, to arm the Volkssturm and near identical copies of the Sten down to makers marks to arm the Werwolf insurgency force.
===Land mines===
Land mines have been used extensively by insurgents throughout Cold War and post-Cold War conflicts such as the First Indochina War, Vietnam War, South African Border War and conflicts in Iraq, Syria and Yemen by insurgents as a method of area denial, psychological warfare and attrition.

During the Portuguese Colonial War, mines and other booby traps were one of the principal weapons used by African nationalist insurgents against Portuguese mechanized forces to great effect, who typically patrolled the mostly unpaved roads of their territories using motor vehicles and armored scout cars. To counter the mine threat, Portuguese engineers commenced the herculean task of tarring the rural road network. Mine detection was accomplished not only by electronic mine detectors, but also by employing trained soldiers (&quot;picadors&quot;) walking abreast with long probes to detect nonmetallic road mines. Guerrillas in all the various revolutionary movements used a variety of mines, often combining anti-tank with anti-personnel mines to ambush Portuguese formations with devastating results. A common tactic was to plant large anti-vehicle mines in a roadway bordered by obvious cover, such as an irrigation ditch, then seed the ditch with anti-personnel mines. Detonation of the vehicle mine would cause Portuguese troops to deploy and seek cover in the ditch, where the anti-personnel mines would cause further casualties. If the insurgents planned to confront the Portuguese openly, one or two heavy machine guns would be sited to sweep the ditch and other likely areas of cover. Mines used included the PMN (Black Widow), TM-46, and POMZ, amphibious mines such as the PDM, and numerous home-made antipersonnel wood box mines and other nonmetallic explosive devices. The impact of mining operations, in addition to causing casualties, undermined the mobility of Portuguese forces, while diverting troops and equipment from security and offensive operations to convoy protection and mine clearance missions.

During the Rhodesian Bush War, the Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army (ZANLA) tried to paralyse the Rhodesian effort and economy by planting Soviet anti-tank mines on the roads. From 1972 to 1980 there were 2,504 vehicle detonations of land mines (mainly Soviet TM46s), killing 632 people and injuring 4,410. Mining of roads increased 33.7% from 1978 (894 mines or 2.44 mines were detonated or recovered per day) to 1979 (2,089 mines or 5.72 mines a day). In response, the Rhodesians co-operated with the South Africans to develop a range of mine-protected vehicles. They began by replacing air in tyres with water which absorbed some of the blast and reduced the heat of the explosion. Initially, they protected the bodies with steel deflector plates, sandbags and mine conveyor belting. Later, purpose-built vehicles with V-shaped blast hulls dispersed the blast, and deaths in such vehicles became unusual events. These developments subsequently led to the South African Hippo, Casspir, Mamba and Nyala wheeled light troop carriers.

Land mines were commonly deployed by insurgents during the South African Border War, leading directly to the development of the first dedicated mine-protected armoured vehicles in South Africa. Namibian insurgents used anti-tank mines to throw South African military convoys into disarray before attacking them. In the areas of fighting that covered vast sparsely populated areas of southern Angola and northern Namibia, it was easy for small groups to infiltrate and lay their mines on roads before escaping again often undetected. The anti-tank mines were most often placed on public roads used by civilian and military vehicles and had a great psychological effect. Mines were often laid in complex arrangements. One tactic was to lay multiple mines on top of each other to increase the blast effect. Another common tactic was to link together several mines placed within a few metres of each other, so that all would detonate when any one was triggered. To discourage detection and removal efforts, they also laid anti-personnel mines directly parallel to the anti-tank mines. This initially resulted in heavy South African military and police casualties, as the vast distances of road network vulnerable to insurgent sappers every day made comprehensive detection and clearance efforts impractical. The only other viable option was the adoption of mine-protected vehicles which could remain mobile on the roads with little risk to their passengers even if a mine was detonated. South Africa is widely credited with inventing the v-hull, a vee-shaped hull for armoured vehicles which deflects mine blasts away from the passenger compartment.

During the Iraqi, Syrian and Yemeni civil wars, landmines have been used for both defensive and guerrilla purposes. Anti-tank mines were also used extensively in Cambodia and along the Thai border, many planted by Pol Pot&#x27;s Khmer Rouge insurgency. Millions of these mines remain in the area, despite clearing efforts. It is estimated that they cause hundreds of deaths annually to civilians.

=== Improvised artillery ===
Improvised and homemade mortars, howitzers and rocket launchers have been used by insurgent groups to attack fortified military installations or to terrorize civilians. They are usually constructed by in a variety of different ways, for example, from heavy steel piping mounted on a steel frame. These weapons may fire factory-made or improvised rounds, and can contain many different explosive fillers and firing mechanisms. 

&quot;Barrack buster&quot; is the colloquial name given to several improvised mortars developed in the 1990s by the Provisional Irish Republican Army (PIRA) during The Troubles. There was several different versions of these mortars constructed by the PIRA, with the most commonly used being the Mark 15 320mm mortar, which fired a projectile constructed of a gas cylinder filled with 196-220 pounds (89-100 kg) of homemade explosives which was remarked as having the effect of a &quot;flying car bomb&quot;, and was used in several different attacks on British Army and RUC bases. It was also used in attacks on a number of British helicopters, two of which were successfully shot down in 1994; a British Army Westland Lynx multipurpose helicopter, and an RAF Aérospatiale SA 330 Puma transport helicopter. Several other types of improvised mortars were created by the PIRA during the Troubles, including the &quot;Mark 16” or &quot;Projected Recoilless Improvised Grenade&quot;, which was used more like a rocket launcher and fired a projectile made of a tin can filled with 600g of Semtex, the &quot;Mark 12” or &quot;Improvised Propelled Grenade&quot; which fired a 40 ounce (1.1 kg) warhead horizontally at security forces bases and vehicles, and the &quot;Mark 10”, which fired a 44–220 pound (20–100 kg) warhead, one of which was responsible for the first intentional killing of a British soldier in a mortar attack. Because of the weight of these mortars, they often had to be transported on vehicles such as tractors and vans.

Improvised artillery has been used extensively by various factions of the Syrian opposition during the Syrian civil war as a way of making up for deficits in the quantity of military-grade artillery. These &quot;Hell Cannons&quot;, as they are known, have been used by various anti-government and Jihadist groups and can fire both improvised and factory-made rounds. The first of these weapons were made in 2012 by the Islamist Ahrar al-Shamal Brigade in the Idlib Governorate around the city of Binnish before the manufacturing was moved to Aleppo by the Free Syrian Army&#x27;s 16th Division which also appropriated the design. The knowledge spread to other groups in Syria, including the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. Variants of these cannons have also been developed by rebel forces, including the &quot;Thunder Cannon&quot; made from the body of a 100mm tank gun round, the &quot;Mortar Cannon&quot; made by the FSA&#x27;s 16th Division that fires factory-made rounds, a compressed air cannon made by Ahrar al-Sham, the &quot;Hellfire Cannon&quot; and a number of multi-barrelled cannons such as the 4-barrelled &quot;Quad Hell Cannon&quot; and the 7-barrelled &quot;Bureji&quot; which is named after a Palestinian refugee camp in Gaza.

<doc id="12727" wikidata="Q7102603" url="?curid=12727" title="Original proof of Gödel's completeness theorem">
<text>The proof of Gödel&#x27;s completeness theorem given by Kurt Gödel in his doctoral dissertation of 1929 (and a shorter version of the proof, published as an article in 1930, titled &quot;The completeness of the axioms of the functional calculus of logic&quot; (in German)) is not easy to read today; it uses concepts and formalisms that are no longer used and terminology that is often obscure. The version given below attempts to represent all the steps in the proof and all the important ideas faithfully, while restating the proof in the modern language of mathematical logic. This outline should not be considered a rigorous proof of the theorem.

== Assumptions ==

We work with first-order predicate calculus. Our languages allow constant, function and relation symbols. Structures consist of (non-empty) domains and interpretations of the relevant symbols as constant members, functions or relations over that domain.

We assume classical logic (as opposed to intuitionistic logic for example).

We fix some axiomatization (i.e. a syntax-based, machine-manageable proof system) of the predicate calculus: logical axioms and rules of inference. Any of the several well-known equivalent axiomatizations will do. Gödel&#x27;s original proof assumed the Hilbert-Ackermann proof system.

We assume without proof all the basic well-known results about our formalism that we need, such as the normal form theorem or the soundness theorem.

We axiomatize predicate calculus &quot;without equality&quot; (sometimes confusingly called &quot;without identity&quot;), i.e. there are no special axioms expressing the properties of (object) equality as a special relation symbol. After the basic form of the theorem has been proved, it will be easy to extend it to the case of predicate calculus &quot;with equality&quot;.

==Statement of the theorem and its proof==

In the following, we state two equivalent forms of the theorem, and show their equivalence.

Later, we prove the theorem. This is done in the following steps:

# Reducing the theorem to sentences (formulas with no free variables) in prenex form, i.e. with all quantifiers ( and ) at the beginning. Furthermore, we reduce it to formulas whose first quantifier is . This is possible because for every sentence, there is an equivalent one in prenex form whose first quantifier is .
# Reducing the theorem to sentences of the form . While we cannot do this by simply rearranging the quantifiers, we show that it is yet enough to prove the theorem for sentences of that form.
# Finally we prove the theorem for sentences of that form.
#* This is done by first noting that a sentence such as is either refutable (its negation is always true) or satisfiable, i.e. there is some model in which it holds (it might even be always true, i.e. a tautology); this model is simply assigning truth values to the subpropositions from which B is built. The reason for that is the completeness of propositional logic, with the existential quantifiers playing no role.
#* We extend this result to more and more complex and lengthy sentences, &quot;D&quot;&quot;n&quot; (&quot;n&quot; = 1,2...), built out from &quot;B&quot;, so that either any of them is refutable and therefore so is &quot;φ&quot;, or all of them are not refutable and therefore each holds in some model.
#* We finally use the models in which the &quot;D&quot;&quot;n&quot; hold (in case all are not refutable) in order to build a model in which &quot;φ&quot; holds.

===Theorem 1. Every valid formula (true in all structures) is provable.===

This is the most basic form of the completeness theorem. We immediately restate it in a form more convenient for our purposes:
When we say &quot;all structures&quot;, it is important to specify that the structures involved are classical (Tarskian) interpretations I, where I =  (U is a non-empty (possibly infinite) set of objects, whereas F is a set of functions from expressions of the interpreted symbolism into U). [By contrast, so-called &quot;free logics&quot; allow possibly empty sets for U. For more regarding free logics, see the work of Karel Lambert.]

===Theorem 2. Every formula φ is either refutable or satisfiable in some structure.===

&quot;&quot;φ&quot; is refutable&quot; means &quot;by definition&quot; &quot;¬&quot;φ&quot; is provable&quot;.

===Equivalence of both theorems===
If Theorem 1 holds, and φ is not satisfiable in any structure, then ¬φ is valid in all structures and therefore provable, thus φ is refutable and Theorem 2 holds. If on the other hand Theorem 2 holds and φ is valid in all structures, then ¬φ is not satisfiable in any structure and therefore refutable; then ¬¬φ is provable and then so is φ, thus Theorem 1 holds.

===Proof of theorem 2: first step===

We approach the proof of Theorem 2 by successively restricting the class of all formulas φ for which we need to prove &quot;φ is either refutable or satisfiable&quot;. At the beginning we need to prove this for all possible formulas φ in our language. However, suppose that for every formula φ there is some formula ψ taken from a more restricted class of formulas C, such that &quot;ψ is either refutable or satisfiable&quot; → &quot;φ is either refutable or satisfiable&quot;. Then, once this claim (expressed in the previous sentence) is proved, it will suffice to prove &quot;φ is either refutable or satisfiable&quot; only for φ&#x27;s belonging to the class C. If φ is provably equivalent to ψ (&quot;i.e.&quot;, (&quot;φ&quot; ≡ &quot;ψ&quot;) is provable), then it is indeed the case that &quot;ψ is either refutable or satisfiable&quot; → &quot;&quot;φ&quot; is either refutable or satisfiable&quot; (the soundness theorem is needed to show this).

There are standard techniques for rewriting an arbitrary formula into one that does not use function or constant symbols, at the cost of introducing additional quantifiers; we will therefore assume that all formulas are free of such symbols. Gödel&#x27;s paper uses a version of first-order predicate calculus that has no function or constant symbols to begin with.

Next we consider a generic formula &quot;φ&quot; (which no longer uses function or constant symbols) and apply the prenex form theorem to find a formula &quot;ψ&quot; in &quot;normal form&quot; such that &quot;φ&quot; ≡ &quot;ψ&quot; (&quot;ψ&quot; being in &quot;normal form&quot; means that all the quantifiers in &quot;ψ&quot;, if there are any, are found at the very beginning of &quot;ψ&quot;). It follows now that we need only prove Theorem 2 for formulas &quot;φ&quot; in normal form.

Next, we eliminate all free variables from &quot;φ&quot; by quantifying them existentially: if, say, &quot;x&quot;1...&quot;x&quot;&quot;n&quot; are free in &quot;φ&quot;, we form formula_1. If &quot;ψ&quot; is satisfiable in a structure &quot;M&quot;, then certainly so is &quot;φ&quot; and if &quot;ψ&quot; is refutable, then formula_2 is provable, and then so is ¬&quot;φ&quot;, thus &quot;φ&quot; is refutable. We see that we can restrict &quot;φ&quot; to be a &quot;sentence&quot;, that is, a formula with no free variables.

Finally, we would like, for reasons of technical convenience, that the &quot;prefix&quot; of &quot;φ&quot; (that is, the string of quantifiers at the beginning of &quot;φ&quot;, which is in normal form) begin with a universal quantifier and end with an existential quantifier. To achieve this for a generic &quot;φ&quot; (subject to restrictions we have already proved), we take some one-place relation symbol F unused in &quot;φ&quot;, and two new variables y and z.. If &quot;φ&quot; = (P)Φ, where (P) stands for the prefix of &quot;φ&quot; and Φ for the &quot;matrix&quot; (the remaining, quantifier-free part of &quot;φ&quot;) we form formula_3. Since formula_4 is clearly provable, it is easy to see that formula_5 is provable.

===Reducing the theorem to formulas of degree 1===

Our generic formula φ now is a sentence, in normal form, and its prefix starts with a universal quantifier and ends with an existential quantifier. Let us call the class of all such formulas R. We are faced with proving that every formula in R is either refutable or satisfiable. Given our formula φ, we group strings of quantifiers of one kind together in blocks:

:formula_6

We define the degree of formula_7 to be the number of universal quantifier blocks, separated by existential quantifier blocks as shown above, in the prefix of formula_7. The following lemma, which Gödel adapted from Skolem&#x27;s proof of the Löwenheim–Skolem theorem, lets us sharply reduce the complexity of the generic formula formula_7 we need to prove the theorem for:

Lemma. Let &quot;k&quot; ≥ 1. If every formula in R of degree &quot;k&quot; is either refutable or satisfiable, then so is every formula in R of degree &quot;k&quot; + 1.

:Comment: Take a formula &quot;φ&quot; of degree &quot;k&quot; + 1 of the form formula_10, where formula_11 is the remainder of formula_7 (it is thus of degree &quot;k&quot; − 1). φ states that for every x there is a y such that... (something). It would have been nice to have a predicate &quot;Q&#x27; &quot; so that for every x, &quot;Q&quot;′(&quot;x&quot;,&quot;y&quot;) would be true if and only if &quot;y&quot; is the required one to make (something) true. Then we could have written a formula of degree &quot;k&quot;, which is equivalent to φ, namely formula_13. This formula is indeed equivalent to φ because it states that for every x, if there is a y that satisfies Q&#x27;(x,y), then (something) holds, and furthermore, we know that there is such a y, because for every x&#x27;, there is a y&#x27; that satisfies Q&#x27;(x&#x27;,y&#x27;). Therefore φ follows from this formula. It is also easy to show that if the formula is false, then so is φ. Unfortunately, in general there is no such predicate Q&#x27;. However, this idea can be understood as a basis for the following proof of the Lemma.

Proof. Let φ be a formula of degree &quot;k&quot; + 1; then we can write it as

:formula_10

where (P) is the remainder of the prefix of formula_7 (it is thus of degree &quot;k&quot; – 1) and formula_16 is the quantifier-free matrix of formula_7. x, y, u and v denote here &quot;tuples&quot; of variables rather than single variables; &quot;e.g.&quot; formula_18 really stands for formula_19 where formula_20 are some distinct variables.

Let now x&#x27; and y&#x27; be tuples of previously unused variables of the same length as x and y respectively, and let Q be a previously unused relation symbol that takes as many arguments as the sum of lengths of x and y; we consider the formula

:formula_21

Clearly, formula_22 is provable.

Now since the string of quantifiers formula_23 does not contain variables from x or y, the following equivalence is easily provable with the help of whatever formalism we&#x27;re using:

:formula_24

And since these two formulas are equivalent, if we replace the first with the second inside Φ, we obtain the formula Φ&#x27; such that Φ≡Φ&#x27;:

:formula_25

Now Φ&#x27; has the form formula_26, where (S) and (S&#x27;) are some quantifier strings, ρ and ρ&#x27; are quantifier-free, and, furthermore, no variable of (S) occurs in ρ&#x27; and no variable of (S&#x27;) occurs in ρ. Under such conditions every formula of the form formula_27, where (T) is a string of quantifiers containing all quantifiers in (S) and (S&#x27;) interleaved among themselves in any fashion, but maintaining the relative order inside (S) and (S&#x27;), will be equivalent to the original formula Φ&#x27;(this is yet another basic result in first-order predicate calculus that we rely on). To wit, we form Ψ as follows:
:formula_28

and we have formula_29.

Now formula_30 is a formula of degree &quot;k&quot; and therefore by assumption either refutable or satisfiable.
If formula_30 is satisfiable in a structure M, then, considering formula_32, we see that formula_7 is satisfiable as well.
If formula_30 is refutable, then so is formula_35, which is equivalent to it; thus formula_36 is provable.
Now we can replace all occurrences of Q inside the provable formula formula_36 by some other formula dependent on the same variables, and we will still get a provable formula.
(&quot;This is yet another basic result of first-order predicate calculus. Depending on the particular formalism adopted for the calculus, it may be seen as a simple application of a &quot;functional substitution&quot; rule of inference, as in Gödel&#x27;s paper, or it may be proved by considering the formal proof of formula_36, replacing in it all occurrences of Q by some other formula with the same free variables, and noting that all logical axioms in the formal proof remain logical axioms after the substitution, and all rules of inference still apply in the same way.&quot;)

In this particular case, we replace Q(x&#x27;,y&#x27;) in formula_36 with the formula formula_40. Here (x,y | x&#x27;,y&#x27;) means that instead of ψ we are writing a different formula, in which x and y are replaced with x&#x27; and y&#x27;. Q(x,y) is simply replaced by formula_41.

formula_36 then becomes

:formula_43

and this formula is provable; since the part under negation and after the formula_44 sign is obviously provable, and the part under negation and before the formula_44 sign is obviously φ, just with x and y replaced by x&#x27; and y&#x27;, we see that formula_46 is provable, and φ is refutable. We have proved that φ is either satisfiable or refutable, and this concludes the proof of the Lemma.

Notice that we could not have used formula_40 instead of Q(x&#x27;,y&#x27;) from the beginning, because formula_30 would not have been a well-formed formula in that case. This is why we cannot naively use the argument appearing at the comment that precedes the proof.

===Proving the theorem for formulas of degree 1===
As shown by the Lemma above, we only need to prove our theorem for formulas φ in R of degree 1. φ cannot be of degree 0, since formulas in R have no free variables and don&#x27;t use constant symbols. So the formula φ has the general form:

:formula_49

Now we define an ordering of the &quot;k&quot;-tuples of natural numbers as follows: formula_50 should hold if either formula_51, or formula_52, and formula_53 precedes formula_54 in lexicographic order. [Here formula_55 denotes the sum of the terms of the tuple.] Denote the nth tuple in this order by formula_56.

Set the formula formula_57 as formula_58. Then put formula_59 as 
:formula_60

Lemma: For every &quot;n&quot;, formula_61.

Proof: By induction on &quot;n&quot;; we have formula_62, where the latter implication holds by variable substitution, since the ordering of the tuples is such that formula_63. But the last formula is equivalent to formula_64φ.

For the base case, formula_65 is obviously a corollary of φ as well. So the Lemma is proven.

Now if formula_66 is refutable for some &quot;n&quot;, it follows that φ is refutable. On the other hand, suppose that formula_66 is not refutable for any &quot;n&quot;. Then for each &quot;n&quot; there is some way of assigning truth values to the distinct subpropositions formula_68 (ordered by their first appearance in formula_59; &quot;distinct&quot; here means either distinct predicates, or distinct bound variables) in formula_70, such that formula_66 will be true when each proposition is evaluated in this fashion. This follows from the completeness of the underlying propositional logic.

We will now show that there is such an assignment of truth values to formula_68, so that all formula_59 will be true: The formula_68 appear in the same order in every formula_66; we will inductively define a general assignment to them by a sort of &quot;majority vote&quot;: Since there are infinitely many assignments (one for each formula_66) affecting formula_77, either infinitely many make formula_77 true, or infinitely many make it false and only finitely many make it true. In the former case, we choose formula_77 to be true in general; in the latter we take it to be false in general. Then from the infinitely many &quot;n&quot; for which formula_77 through formula_81 are assigned the same truth value as in the general assignment, we pick a general assignment to formula_68 in the same fashion.

This general assignment must lead to every one of the formula_83 and formula_84 being true, since if one of the formula_83 were false under the general assignment, formula_59 would also be false for every &quot;n &gt; k&quot;. But this contradicts the fact that for the finite collection of general formula_68 assignments appearing in formula_84, there are infinitely many &quot;n&quot; where the assignment making formula_59 true matches the general assignment.

From this general assignment, which makes all of the formula_84 true, we construct an interpretation of the language&#x27;s predicates that makes φ true. The universe of the model will be the natural numbers. Each i-ary predicate formula_30 should be true of the naturals formula_92 precisely when the proposition formula_93 is either true in the general assignment, or not assigned by it (because it never appears in any of the formula_84).

In this model, each of the formulas formula_95 is true by construction. But this implies that φ itself is true in the model, since the formula_96 range over all possible k-tuples of natural numbers. So φ is satisfiable, and we are done.

====Intuitive explanation====
We may write each &quot;B&quot;&quot;i&quot; as Φ(&quot;x&quot;1...&quot;x&quot;&quot;k&quot;,&quot;y&quot;1...&quot;y&quot;&quot;m&quot;) for some &quot;x&quot;s, which we may call &quot;first arguments&quot; and &quot;y&quot;s that we may call &quot;last arguments&quot;.

Take &quot;B&quot;1 for example. Its &quot;last arguments&quot; are &quot;z&quot;2,&quot;z&quot;3...&quot;z&quot;&quot;m&quot;+1, and for every possible combination of &quot;k&quot; of these variables there is some &quot;j&quot; so that they appear as &quot;first arguments&quot; in &quot;B&quot;&quot;j&quot;. Thus for large enough &quot;n&quot;1, &quot;D&quot;&quot;n&quot;1 has the property that the &quot;last arguments&quot; of &quot;B&quot;1 appear, in every possible combinations of &quot;k&quot; of them, as &quot;first arguments&quot; in other &quot;B&quot;&quot;j&quot;s within &quot;D&quot;&quot;n&quot;. For every Bi there is a Dni with the corresponding property.

Therefore, in a model that satisfies all the &quot;D&quot;&quot;n&quot;s, there are objects corresponding to &quot;z&quot;1, &quot;z&quot;2... and each combination of &quot;k&quot; of these appear as &quot;first arguments&quot; in some &quot;B&quot;&quot;j&quot;, meaning that for every &quot;k&quot; of these objects &quot;z&quot;&quot;p&quot;1...&quot;z&quot;&quot;p&quot;&quot;k&quot; there are &quot;z&quot;&quot;q&quot;1...&quot;z&quot;&quot;q&quot;&quot;m&quot;, which makes Φ(&quot;z&quot;&quot;p&quot;1...&quot;z&quot;&quot;p&quot;&quot;k&quot;,&quot;z&quot;&quot;q&quot;1...&quot;z&quot;&quot;q&quot;&quot;m&quot;) satisfied. By taking a submodel with only these &quot;z&quot;1, &quot;z&quot;2... objects, we have a model satisfying &quot;φ&quot;.

==Extensions==

===Extension to first-order predicate calculus with equality===
Gödel reduced a formula containing instances of the equality predicate to ones without it in an extended language. His method involves replacing a formula φ containing some instances of equality with the formula

: formula_97 formula_98
: formula_99
: formula_100
: formula_101
: formula_102
: formula_99
: formula_104

Here formula_105 denote the predicates appearing in φ (with formula_106 their respective arities), and φ&#x27; is the formula φ with all occurrences of equality replaced with the new predicate &quot;Eq&quot;. If this new formula is refutable, the original φ was as well; the same is true of satisfiability, since we may take a quotient of satisfying model of the new formula by the equivalence relation representing &quot;Eq&quot;. This quotient is well-defined with respect to the other predicates, and therefore will satisfy the original formula φ.

===Extension to countable sets of formulas===

Gödel also considered the case where there are a countably infinite collection of formulas. Using the same reductions as above, he was able to consider only those cases where each formula is of degree 1 and contains no uses of equality. For a countable collection of formulas formula_107 of degree 1, we may define formula_108 as above; then define formula_109 to be the closure of formula_110. The remainder of the proof then went through as before.

===Extension to arbitrary sets of formulas===

When there is an uncountably infinite collection of formulas, the Axiom of Choice (or at least some weak form of it) is needed. Using the full AC, one can well-order the formulas, and prove the uncountable case with the same argument as the countable one, except with transfinite induction. Other approaches can be used to prove that the completeness theorem in this case is equivalent to the Boolean prime ideal theorem, a weak form of AC.

<doc id="12729" wikidata="Q1543770" url="?curid=12729" title="Grits">
<text>Grits are a type of porridge made from coarsely ground dried maize or hominy, the latter being maize that has been treated with an alkali in a process called nixtamalization, with the pericarp (ovary wall) removed. Grits are cooked in warm salted water or milk. They are often served with flavorings as a breakfast dish. Grits can be savory or sweet, with savory seasonings being more common. Grits are similar to other thick maize-based porridges from around the world, such as polenta, , and mămăligă. The dish originated in the Southern United States but is now available nationwide. Grits are often part of the dinner entrée shrimp and grits, served primarily in the Southern United States.

The word &quot;grits&quot; is derived from the Old English word , meaning &quot;coarse meal&quot;. In the Charleston, South Carolina area, cooked hominy grits were primarily referred to as &quot;hominy&quot; until the 1980s.

== Origin ==
The dish originated with the Native American Muscogee tribe using maize. American colonists learned to make the dish from the Native Americans, and it quickly became an American staple.

At that time, maize or hominy for grits was ground on a stone mill. The ground material was passed through screens, the finer sifted material used as grit meal, and the coarser as grits.

Three-quarters of the grits sold in the U.S. are bought in the South, in an area stretching from Lower Texas to Washington, D.C., that is sometimes called the &quot;grits belt&quot;. The state of Georgia declared grits to be its official prepared food in 2002. A similar bill was introduced in South Carolina to name it the official state food, but it did not advance. Nevertheless, South Carolina still has an entire chapter of legislation dealing exclusively with corn meal and grits. State law in South Carolina requires grits and rice meal to be enriched, similar to the requirement for flour.

Grits may be either yellow or white, depending on the color of the maize used. The most common version in supermarkets is &quot;quick&quot; grits, which are made from non-hominy maize and have the germ and hull removed. Whole kernel grits are sometimes called &quot;speckled&quot;.

== Preparation ==

Grits are prepared by mixing water or milk and the dry grits and stirring them over heat, if one uses cornmeal, the food is called mush. Whole-grain grits require much longer to become soft than &quot;quick grits&quot;.

== Dishes ==
Grits are eaten with a wide variety of foods, such as eggs and bacon, fried catfish, shrimp, salmon croquettes, or country ham.

Shrimp and grits is a traditional dish in the coastal communities in the South Carolina Lowcountry and Georgia&#x27;s Lower Coastal Plain. 

Solidified cooked grits can be sliced and fried in vegetable oil, butter, or bacon grease to make fried grits, or they can first be breaded in beaten egg and bread crumbs.

<text>General Electric Company (GE) was an American multinational conglomerate founded in 1892, incorporated in the state of New York and headquartered in Boston. Over the years, the company had multiple divisions, including aerospace, energy, healthcare, lighting, locomotives, appliances, and finance. In 2020, GE ranked among the &quot;Fortune&quot; 500 as the 33rd largest firm in the United States by gross revenue. In 2023, the company was ranked 64th in the Forbes Global 2000. In 2011, GE ranked among the Fortune 20 as the 14th most profitable company, but later very severely underperformed the market (by about 75%) as its profitability collapsed. Two employees of GE—Irving Langmuir (1932) and Ivar Giaever (1973)—have been awarded the Nobel Prize.

Following the Great Recession of the late 2000s decade, General Electric began selling off various divisions and assets, including its appliances and financial capital divisions, under Jeff Immelt&#x27;s leadership as CEO. John Flannery, Immelt&#x27;s replacement in 2017, further divested General Electric&#x27;s assets in locomotives and lighting in order to focus the company more on aviation. Restrictions on air travel during the COVID-19 pandemic caused General Electric&#x27;s revenue to fall significantly in 2020. Ultimately, GE&#x27;s final CEO Larry Culp announced in November 2021 that General Electric was to be broken up into three separate, public companies by 2024. GE Aerospace, the aerospace company, is GE&#x27;s legal successor. GE HealthCare, the healthcare company, was spun off from GE in 2023. GE Vernova, the energy company, was founded when GE finalized the split. Following these transactions, GE Aerospace took the General Electric name and ticker symbols, while the old General Electric ceased to exist as a conglomerate. 
==History==
===Formation===


During 1889, Thomas Edison (1847–1931) had business interests in many electricity-related companies, including Edison Lamp Company, a lamp manufacturer in East Newark, New Jersey; Edison Machine Works, a manufacturer of dynamos and large electric motors in Schenectady, New York; Bergmann &amp; Company, a manufacturer of electric lighting fixtures, sockets, and other electric lighting devices; and Edison Electric Light Company, the patent-holding company and financial arm for Edison&#x27;s lighting experiments, backed by J. P. Morgan (1837–1913) and the Vanderbilt family.

Henry Villard, a long-time Edison supporter and investor, proposed to consolidate all of these business interests. The proposal was supported by Samuel Insull - who served as his secretary and, later, financier - as well other investors. In 1889, Drexel, Morgan &amp; Co.—a company founded by J. P. Morgan and Anthony J. Drexel—financed Edison&#x27;s research and helped merge several of Edison&#x27;s separate companies under one corporation, forming Edison General Electric Company, which was incorporated in New York on April 24, 1889. The new company acquired Sprague Electric Railway &amp; Motor Company in the same year. The consolidation did not involve all of the companies established by Edison; notably, the Edison Illuminating Company, which would later become Consolidated Edison, was not part of the merger.

In 1880, Gerald Waldo Hart formed the American Electric Company of New Britain, Connecticut, which merged a few years later with Thomson-Houston Electric Company, led by Charles Coffin. In 1887, Hart left to become superintendent of the Edison Electric Company. General Electric was formed through the 1892 merger of Edison General Electric Company and Thomson-Houston Electric Company with the support of Drexel, Morgan &amp; Co. The original plants of both companies continue to operate under the GE banner to this day.

The General Electric business was incorporated in New York, with the Schenectady plant used as headquarters for many years thereafter. Around the same time, General Electric&#x27;s Canadian counterpart, Canadian General Electric, was formed.

In 1893, General Electric bought the business of Rudolf Eickemeyer in Yonkers, New York, along with all of its patents and designs. Eickemeyer&#x27;s firm had developed transformers for use in the transmission of electrical power.

===Public company===
In 1896, General Electric was one of the original 12 companies listed on the newly formed Dow Jones Industrial Average, where it remained a part of the index for 122 years, though not continuously.

In 1911, General Electric absorbed the National Electric Lamp Association (NELA) into its lighting business. GE established its lighting division headquarters at Nela Park in East Cleveland, Ohio. The lighting division has since remained in the same location.

===RCA and NBC===
Owen D. Young, who was then GE&#x27;s general counsel and vice president, through GE, founded the Radio Corporation of America (RCA) in 1919. This came after Young, while working with senior naval officers, purchased the Marconi Wireless Telegraph Company of America, which was a subsidiary of the British company Marconi Wireless and Signal Company. He aimed to expand international radio communications. GE used RCA as its retail arm for radio sales. In 1926, RCA co-founded the National Broadcasting Company (NBC), which built two radio broadcasting networks. In 1930, General Electric was charged with antitrust violations and was ordered to divest itself of RCA.

===Television===
In 1927, Ernst Alexanderson of GE made the first demonstration of television broadcast reception at his General Electric Realty Plot home at 1132 Adams Road in Schenectady, New York. On January 13, 1928, he made what was said to be the first broadcast to the public in the United States on GE&#x27;s W2XAD: the pictures were picked up on 1.5 square inches (9.7 square centimeters) screens in the homes of four GE executives. The sound was broadcast on GE&#x27;s WGY (AM).

Experimental television station W2XAD evolved into the station WRGB, which, along with WGY and WGFM (now WRVE), was owned and operated by General Electric until 1983. In 1965, the company expanded into cable with the launch of a franchise, which was awarded to a non-exclusive franchise in Schenectady through subsidiary General Electric Cablevision Corporation. On February 15, 1965, General Electric expanded its holdings in order to acquire more television stations to meet the maximum limit of the FCC, and more cable holdings through subsidiaries General Electric Broadcasting Company and General Electric Cablevision Corporation.

The company also owned television stations such as KOA-TV (now KCNC-TV) in Denver and WSIX-TV (later WNGE-TV, now WKRN) in Nashville, but like WRGB, General Electric sold off most of its broadcasting holdings, but held on to the Denver television station until in 1986, when General Electric bought out RCA and made it into an owned-and-operated station by NBC. It even stayed on until 1995 when it was transferred to a joint venture between CBS and Group W in a swap deal, alongside KUTV in Salt Lake City for longtime CBS O&amp;O in Philadelphia, WCAU-TV.

===Radio stations===


===Power generation===

Led by Sanford Alexander Moss, GE moved into the new field of aircraft turbosuperchargers. This technology also led to the development of industrial gas turbine engines used for power production. GE introduced the first set of superchargers during World War I and continued to develop them during the interwar period. Superchargers became indispensable in the years immediately before World War II. GE supplied 300,000 turbosuperchargers for use in fighter and bomber engines. This work led the U.S. Army Air Corps to select GE to develop the nation&#x27;s first jet engine during the war. This experience, in turn, made GE a natural selection to develop the Whittle W.1 jet engine that was demonstrated in the United States in 1941. GE was ranked ninth among United States corporations in the value of wartime production contracts. However, their early work with Whittle&#x27;s designs was later handed to Allison Engine Company. GE Aviation then emerged as one of the world&#x27;s largest engine manufacturers, bypassing the British company Rolls-Royce plc.

Some consumers boycotted GE light bulbs, refrigerators, and other products during the 1980s and 1990s. The purpose of the boycott was to protest against GE&#x27;s role in nuclear weapons production.

In 2002, GE acquired the wind power assets of Enron during its bankruptcy proceedings. Enron Wind was the only surviving U.S. manufacturer of large wind turbines at the time, and GE increased engineering and supplies for the Wind Division and doubled the annual sales to $1.2 billion in 2003. It acquired ScanWind in 2009.

In 2018, GE Power garnered press attention when a model 7HA gas turbine in Texas was shut down for two months due to the break of a turbine blade. This model uses similar blade technology to GE&#x27;s newest and most efficient model, the 9HA. After the break, GE developed new protective coatings and heat treatment methods. Gas turbines represent a significant portion of GE Power&#x27;s revenue, and also represent a significant portion of the power generation fleet of several utility companies in the United States. Chubu Electric of Japan and Électricité de France also had units that were impacted. Initially, GE did not realize the turbine blade issue of the 9FB unit would impact the new HA units.

===Computing===

GE was one of the eight major computer companies of the 1960s along with IBM, Burroughs, NCR, Control Data Corporation, Honeywell, RCA, and UNIVAC. GE had a line of general purpose and special purpose computers, including the GE 200, GE 400, and GE 600 series general-purpose computers, the GE/PAC 4000 series real-time process control computers, and the DATANET-30 and Datanet 355 message switching computers (DATANET-30 and 355 were also used as front end processors for GE mainframe computers). A Datanet 500 computer was designed but never sold.

In 1956 Homer Oldfield was promoted to General Manager of GE&#x27;s Computer Department. He facilitated the invention and construction of the Bank of America ERMA system, the first computerized system designed to read magnetized numbers on checks. But he was fired from GE in 1958 by Ralph J. Cordiner for overstepping his bounds and successfully gaining the ERMA contract. Cordiner was strongly against GE entering the computer business because he did not see the potential in it.
In 1962, GE started developing its GECOS (later renamed GCOS) operating system, originally for batch processing, but later extended to time-sharing and transaction processing. Versions of GCOS are still in use today. From 1964 to 1969, GE and Bell Laboratories (which soon dropped out) joined with MIT to develop the Multics operating system on the GE 645 mainframe computer. The project took longer than expected and was not a major commercial success, but it demonstrated concepts such as single-level storage, dynamic linking, hierarchical file system, and ring-oriented security. Active development of Multics continued until 1985.

GE got into computer manufacturing because, in the 1950s, they were the largest user of computers outside the United States federal government, aside from being the first business in the world to own a computer. Its major appliance manufacturing plant &quot;Appliance Park&quot; was the first non-governmental site to host one. However, in 1970, GE sold its computer division to Honeywell, exiting the computer manufacturing industry, though it retained its timesharing operations for some years afterward. GE was a big provider of computer time-sharing services through General Electric Information Services (GEIS, now GXS), offering online computing services that included GEnie.

In 2000, when United Technologies Corp. planned to buy Honeywell, GE made a counter-offer that was approved by Honeywell. On July 3, 2001, the European Union issued a statement that &quot;prohibit the proposed acquisition by General Electric Co. of Honeywell Inc.&quot;. The reasons given were it &quot;would create or strengthen dominant positions on several markets and that the remedies proposed by GE were insufficient to resolve the competition concerns resulting from the proposed acquisition of Honeywell&quot;.

On June 27, 2014, GE partnered with collaborative design company Quirky to announce its connected LED bulb called Link. The Link bulb is designed to communicate with smartphones and tablets using a mobile app called Wink.
===Acquisitions and divestments===
In December 1985, GE reacquired the RCA Corporation, primarily to gain ownership of the NBC television network for $6.28 billion; this merger surpassed the Capital Cities/ABC merger from earlier that year as the largest non-oil company merger in world business history. The remainder of RCA&#x27;s divisions and assets were sold to various companies, including Bertelsmann Music Group which acquired RCA Records. Thomson SA, which licensed the manufacture of RCA and GE branded electronics, traced its roots to Thomson-Houston, one of the original components of GE. Also in 1986, Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co., a U.S.-based securities firm, was sold to GE and following heavy losses was sold to PaineWebber in 1994.

In 1997, Genpact was founded as a unit of General Electric in Gurgaon. The company was founded as GE Capital International Services (GECIS). In the beginning, GECIS created processes for outsourcing back-office activities for GE Capital such as processing car loans and credit card transactions. It was an experimental concept at the time and the beginning of the business process outsourcing (BPO) industry. GE sold 60% stake in Genpact to General Atlantic and Oak Hill Capital Partners in 2005 and hived off Genpact into an independent business. GE is still a major client to Genpact today for services in customer service, finance, information technology, and analytics.

In 2001, GE acquired Spanish-language broadcaster Telemundo and incorporated it into NBC.

In 2002, Francisco Partners and Norwest Venture Partners acquired a division of GE called GE Information Systems (GEIS). The new company, named GXS, is based in Gaithersburg, Maryland. GXS is a provider of business-to-business e-commerce solutions. GE maintains a minority stake in GXS. Also in 2002, GE Wind Energy was formed when GE bought the wind turbine manufacturing assets of Enron Wind after the Enron scandals.

In 2004, GE bought 80% of Vivendi Universal Entertainment, the parent of Universal Pictures from Vivendi. Vivendi bought 20% of NBC, forming the company NBCUniversal. GE then owned 80% of NBCUniversal and Vivendi owned 20%. In 2004, GE completed the spin-off of most of its mortgage and life insurance assets into an independent company, Genworth Financial, based in Richmond, Virginia.

In May 2007, GE acquired Smiths Aerospace for $4.8 billion. Also in 2007, GE Oil &amp; Gas acquired Vetco Gray for $1.9 billion, followed by the acquisition of Hydril Pressure &amp; Control in 2008 for $1.1 billion.

GE Plastics was sold in 2008 to SABIC (Saudi Arabia Basic Industries Corporation). In May 2008, GE announced it was exploring options for divesting the bulk of its consumer and industrial business.

On December 3, 2009, it was announced that NBCUniversal would become a joint venture between GE and cable television operator Comcast. Comcast would hold a controlling interest in the company, while GE would retain a 49% stake and would buy out shares owned by Vivendi.

Vivendi would sell its 20% stake in NBCUniversal to GE for US$5.8 billion. Vivendi would sell 7.66% of NBCUniversal to GE for US$2 billion if the GE/Comcast deal was not completed by September 2010 and then sell the remaining 12.34% stake of NBCUniversal to GE for US$3.8 billion when the deal was completed or to the public via an IPO if the deal was not completed.

On March 1, 2010, GE announced plans to sell its 20.85% stake in Turkey-based Garanti Bank. In August 2010, GE Healthcare signed a strategic partnership to bring cardiovascular Computed Tomography (CT) technology from start-up Arineta Ltd. of Israel to the hospital market. In October 2010, GE acquired gas engines manufacturer Dresser Industries in a $3 billion deal and also bought a $1.6 billion portfolio of retail credit cards from Citigroup Inc. On October 14, 2010, GE announced the acquisition of data migration &amp; SCADA simulation specialists Opal Software. In December 2010, for the second time that year (after the Dresser acquisition), GE bought the oil sector company Wellstream, an oil pipe maker, for 800 million pounds ($1.3 billion).

In March 2011, GE announced that it had completed the acquisition of privately held Lineage Power Holdings from The Gores Group. In April 2011, GE announced it had completed its purchase of John Wood plc&#x27;s Well Support Division for $2.8 billion.

In 2011, GE Capital sold its $2 billion Mexican assets to Santander for $162 million and exited the business in Mexico. Santander additionally assumed the portfolio debts of GE Capital in the country. Following this, GE Capital focused on its core business and shed its non-core assets.

In June 2012, CEO and President of GE Jeff Immelt said that the company would invest ₹3 billion to accelerate its businesses in Karnataka. In October 2012, GE acquired $7 billion worth of bank deposits from MetLife Inc.

On March 19, 2013, Comcast bought GE&#x27;s shares in NBCU for $16.7 billion, ending the company&#x27;s longtime stake in television and film media.

In April 2013, GE acquired oilfield pump maker Lufkin Industries for $2.98 billion.

In April 2014, it was announced that GE was in talks to acquire the global power division of French engineering group Alstom for a figure of around $13 billion. A rival joint bid was submitted in June 2014 by Siemens and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI) with Siemens seeking to acquire Alstom&#x27;s gas turbine business for €3.9 billion, and MHI proposing a joint venture in steam turbines, plus a €3.1 billion cash investment. In June 2014, a formal offer from GE worth $17 billion was agreed by the Alstom board. Part of the transaction involved the French government taking a 20% stake in Alstom to help secure France&#x27;s energy and transport interests and French jobs. A rival offer from Siemens Mitsubishi Heavy Industries was rejected. The acquisition was expected to be completed in 2015. In October 2014, GE announced it was considering the sale of its Polish banking business Bank BPH.

Later in 2014, General Electric announced plans to open its global operations center in Cincinnati, Ohio. The Global Operations Center opened in October 2016 as home to GE&#x27;s multifunctional shared services organization. It supports the company&#x27;s finance/accounting, human resources, information technology, supply chain, legal and commercial operations, and is one of GE&#x27;s four multifunctional shared services centers worldwide in Pudong, China; Budapest, Hungary; and Monterrey, Mexico.

In April 2015, GE announced its intention to sell off its property portfolio, worth $26.5 billion, to Wells Fargo and The Blackstone Group. It was announced in April 2015 that GE would sell most of its finance unit and return around $90 billion to shareholders as the firm looked to trim down on its holdings and rid itself of its image of a &quot;hybrid&quot; company, working in both banking and manufacturing. In August 2015, GE Capital agreed to sell its Healthcare Financial Services business to Capital One for US$9 billion. The transaction involved US$8.5 billion of loans made to a wide array of sectors, including senior housing, hospitals, medical offices, outpatient services, pharmaceuticals, and medical devices. Also in August 2015, GE Capital agreed to sell GE Capital Bank&#x27;s on-line deposit platform to Goldman Sachs. Terms of the transaction were not disclosed, but the sale included US$8 billion of on-line deposits and another US$8 billion of brokered certificates of deposit. The sale was part of GE&#x27;s strategic plan to exit the U.S. banking sector and to free itself from tightening banking regulations. GE also aimed to shed its status as a &quot;systematically important financial institution&quot;.

In September 2015, GE Capital agreed to sell its transportation finance unit to Canada&#x27;s Bank of Montreal. The unit sold had US$8.7 billion (CA$11.5 billion) of assets, 600 employees, and 15 offices in the U.S. and Canada. The exact terms of the sale were not disclosed, but the final price would be based on the value of the assets at closing, plus a premium according to the parties. In October 2015, activist investor Nelson Peltz&#x27;s fund Trian bought a $2.5 billion stake in the company.

In January 2016, Haier acquired GE&#x27;s appliance division for $5.4 billion. In October 2016, GE Renewable Energy agreed to pay €1.5 billion to Doughty Hanson &amp; Co for LM Wind Power during 2017.

At the end of October 2016, it was announced that GE was under negotiations for a deal valued at about $30 billion to combine GE Oil &amp; Gas with Baker Hughes. The transaction would create a publicly traded entity controlled by GE. It was announced that GE Oil &amp; Gas would sell off its water treatment business, GE Water &amp; Process Technologies, as part of its divestment agreement with Baker Hughes. The deal was cleared by the EU in May 2017, and by the United States Department of Justice in June 2017. The merger agreement was approved by shareholders at the end of June 2017. On July 3, 2017, the transaction was completed, and Baker Hughes became a GE company and was renamed Baker Hughes, a GE Company (BHGE). In November 2018, GE reduced its stake in Baker Hughes to 50.4%. On October 18, 2019, GE reduced its stake to 36.8% and the company was renamed back to Baker Hughes.

In May 2017, GE had signed $15 billion of business deals with Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia is one of GE&#x27;s largest customers. In September 2017, GE announced the sale of its Industrial Solutions Business to ABB. The deal closed on June 30, 2018.

===Fraud allegations and notice of possible SEC civil action===
On August 15, 2019, Harry Markopolos, a financial fraud investigator known for his discovery of a Ponzi scheme run by Bernard Madoff, accused General Electric of being a &quot;bigger fraud than Enron,&quot; alleging $38 billion in accounting fraud. GE denied wrongdoing.

On October 6, 2020, General Electric reported it received a Wells notice from the Securities and Exchange Commission stating the SEC may take civil action for possible violations of securities laws.

====Insufficient reserves for long-term care policies====
It is alleged that GE is &quot;hiding&quot; (i.e., under-reserved) $29 billion in losses related to its long-term care business.

According to an August 2019 Fitch Ratings report, there are concerns that GE has not set aside enough money to cover its long-term care liabilities.

In 2018, a lawsuit (the Bezio case) was filed in New York state court on behalf of participants in GE&#x27;s 401(k) plan and shareowners alleging violations of Section 11 of the Securities Act of 1933 based on alleged misstatements and omissions related to insurance reserves and performance of GE&#x27;s business segments.

The Kansas Insurance Department (KID) is requiring General Electric to make $14.5 billion of capital contributions for its insurance contracts during the 7-year period ending in 2024.

GE reported the total liability related to its insurance contracts increased significantly from 2016 to 2019:
:December 31, 2016 $26.1 billion
:December 31, 2017 $38.6 billion
:December 31, 2018 $35.6 billion 
:December 31, 2019 $39.6 billion

In 2018, GE announced that the issuance of the new standard by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) regarding Financial Services – Insurance (Topic 944) would materially affect its financial statements. Mr. Markopolos estimated there would be a $US 10.5 billion charge when the new accounting standard is adopted in the first quarter of 2021.

====Anticipated $8 billion loss upon disposition of Baker Hughes====
In 2017, GE acquired a 62.5% interest in Baker Hughes (BHGE) when it combined its oil &amp; gas business with Baker Hughes Incorporated.
In 2018, GE reduced its interest to 50.4%, resulting in the realization of a $2.1 billion loss. GE is planning to divest its remaining interest and has warned that the divestment will result in an additional loss of $8.4 billion (assuming a BHGE share price of $23.57 per share). In response to the fraud allegations, GE noted the amount of the loss would be $7.4 billion if the divestment occurred on July 26, 2019. Mr. Markopolos noted that BHGE is an asset available for sale and therefore mark-to-market accounting is required.

Markopolos noted GE&#x27;s current ratio was only 0.67. He expressed concerns that GE may file for bankruptcy if there is a recession.

===Final years and three-way split (2018–2024)===
In 2018, the GE Pension Plan reported losses of US$3.3 billion on plan assets.

In 2018, General Electric changed the discount rate used to calculate the actuarial liabilities of its pension plans. The rate was increased from 3.64% to 4.34%. Consequently, the reported liability for the underfunded pension plans decreased by $7 billion year-over-year, from $34.2 billion in 2017 to $27.2 billion in 2018.

In October 2018, General Electric announced it would &quot;freeze pensions&quot; for about 20,000 salaried U.S. employees. The employees will be moved to a defined contribution retirement plan in 2021.

On March 30, 2020, General Electric factory workers protested to convert jet engine factories to make ventilators during the COVID-19 crisis.

In June 2020, GE made an agreement to sell its Lighting business to Savant Systems, Inc. Financial details of the transaction were not disclosed.

In November 2020, General Electric warned it would be cutting jobs waiting for a recovery due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

On November 9, 2021, the company announced it would divide itself into three public companies. On July 18, 2022, GE unveiled the brand names of the companies it had devised through its planned separation: GE Aerospace, GE HealthCare, and GE Vernova. The new companies are respectively focused on aerospace, healthcare, and energy (renewable energy, power, and digital). The first spin-off of GE HealthCare was finalized on January 4, 2023; GE continues to hold 10.24% of shares and intends to sell the remaining over time. This was followed by the spin-off of GE&#x27;s portfolio of energy businesses, which became GE Vernova on April 2, 2024. Following these transactions, GE became an aviation-focused company; GE Aerospace is the legal successor of the original GE. The company&#x27;s legal name is still General Electric Company.

== Financial performance ==
=== Dividends ===
General Electric was a longtime &quot;dividend aristocrat&quot; (a company with a long history of maintaining dividend payments to shareholders). Until 2017, the company had never cut dividends for 119 years before a 50% dividend reduction from 24 cents per share to 12 cents per share. In 2018, GE further reduced its quarterly dividend from 12 cents to 1 cent per share.

==Stock==
As a publicly traded company on the New York Stock Exchange, GE stock was one of the 30 components of the Dow Jones Industrial Average from 1907 to 2018, the longest continuous presence of any company on the index, and during this time the only company that was part of the original Dow Jones Industrial Index created in 1896. In August 2000, the company had a market capitalization of $601 billion, and was the most valuable company in the world. On June 26, 2018, the stock was removed from the index and replaced with Walgreens Boots Alliance. In the years leading to its removal, GE was the worst performing stock in the Dow, falling more than 55 percent year on year and more than 25 percent year to date. The company continued to lose value after being removed from the index.
General Electric Co. announced on July 30, 2021 (the completion of) a reverse stock split of GE common stock at a ratio of 1-for-8 and trading on a split-adjusted basis with a new ISIN number (US3696043013) starting on August 2, 2021.

==Corporate affairs==
In 1959, General Electric was accused of promoting the largest illegal cartel in the United States since the adoption of the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890 in order to maintain artificially high prices. In total, 29 companies and 45 executives would be convicted. Subsequent parliamentary inquiries revealed that &quot;white-collar crime&quot; was by far the most costly form of crime for the United States&#x27; finances.

GE is a multinational conglomerate headquartered in Boston, Massachusetts. However its main offices are located at 30 Rockefeller Plaza at Rockefeller Center in New York City, known now as the Comcast Building. It was formerly known as the GE Building for the prominent GE logo on the roof; NBC&#x27;s headquarters and main studios are also located in the building. Through its RCA subsidiary, it has been associated with the center since its construction in the 1930s. GE moved its corporate headquarters from the GE Building on Lexington Avenue to Fairfield, Connecticut in 1974. In 2016, GE announced a move to the South Boston Waterfront neighborhood of Boston, Massachusetts, partly as a result of an incentive package provide by state and city governments. The first group of workers arrived in the summer of 2016, and the full move will be completed by 2018. Due to poor financial performance and corporate downsizing, GE sold the land it planned to build its new headquarters building on, instead choosing to occupy neighboring leased buildings.

GE&#x27;s tax return is the largest return filed in the United States; the 2005 return was approximately 24,000 pages when printed out, and 237 megabytes when submitted electronically. As of 2011, the company spent more on U.S. lobbying than any other company.

In 2005, GE launched its &quot;Ecomagination&quot; initiative in an attempt to position itself as a &quot;green&quot; company.
GE is one of the biggest players in the wind power industry and is developing environment-friendly products such as hybrid locomotives, desalination and water reuse solutions, and photovoltaic cells. The company &quot;plans to build the largest solar-panel-making factory in the U.S.&quot; and has set goals for its subsidiaries to lower their greenhouse gas emissions.

On May 21, 2007, GE announced it would sell its GE Plastics division to petrochemicals manufacturer SABIC for net proceeds of $11.6 billion. The transaction took place on August 31, 2007, and the company name changed to SABIC Innovative Plastics, with Brian Gladden as CEO.

In July 2010, GE agreed to pay $23.4 million to settle an SEC complaint without admitting or denying the allegations that two of its subsidiaries bribed Iraqi government officials to win contracts under the U.N. oil-for-food program between 2002 and 2003.

In February 2017, GE announced that the company intends to close the gender gap by promising to hire and place 20,000 women in technical roles by 2020. The company is also seeking to have a 50:50 male-to-female gender representation in all entry-level technical programs.

In October 2017, GE announced they would be closing research and development centers in Shanghai, Munich and Rio de Janeiro. The company spent $5 billion on R&amp;D in the last year.

On February 25, 2019, GE sold its diesel locomotive business to Wabtec.

===Corporate recognition and rankings===
In 2011, &quot;Fortune&quot; ranked GE the sixth-largest firm in the U.S., and the 14th-most profitable. Other rankings for 2011–2012 include the following:
* #18 company for leaders (&quot;Fortune&quot;)
* #82 green company (&quot;Newsweek&quot;)
* #91 most admired company (&quot;Fortune&quot;)
* #19 most innovative company (&quot;Fast Company&quot;).

In 2012, GE&#x27;s brand was valued at $28.8 billion. CEO Jeff Immelt had a set of changes in the presentation of the brand commissioned in 2004, after he took the reins as chairman, to unify the diversified businesses of GE.

Tom Geismar later stated that looking back at the logos of the 1910s, 1920s, and 1930s, one can clearly judge that they are old-fashioned. Chermayeff &amp; Geismar, along with colleagues Bill Brown and Ivan Chermaev, created the modern 1980 logo. They, in turn, argued that even now the old logos look out of date, earlier they were good. The changes included a new corporate color palette, small modifications to the GE logo, a new customized font (GE Inspira) and a new slogan, &quot;Imagination at work&quot;, composed by David Lucas, to replace the slogan &quot;We Bring Good Things to Life&quot; used since 1979. The standard requires many headlines to be lowercased and adds visual &quot;white space&quot; to documents and advertising. The changes were designed by Wolff Olins and are used on GE&#x27;s marketing, literature, and website. In 2014, a second typeface family was introduced: GE Sans and Serif by Bold Monday, created under art direction by Wolff Olins.

, GE had appeared on the Fortune 500 list for 22 years and held the 11th rank. GE was removed from the Dow Jones Industrial Average on June 28, 2018, after the value had dropped below 1% of the index&#x27;s weight.

==Businesses==

GE&#x27;s primary business divisions are:
* GE Additive
* GE Aerospace
* GE Capital
* GE Digital
* GE Healthcare
* GE Power
* GE Renewable Energy
* GE Research

Through these businesses, GE participates in markets that include the generation, transmission and distribution of electricity (e.g. nuclear, gas and solar), industrial automation, medical imaging equipment, motors, aircraft jet engines, and aviation services. Through GE Commercial Finance, GE Consumer Finance, GE Equipment Services, and GE Insurance, it offers a range of financial services. It has a presence in over 100 countries.

General Imaging manufacturers GE digital cameras.

Even though the first wave of conglomerates (such as ITT Corporation, Ling-Temco-Vought, Tenneco, etc.) fell by the wayside by the mid-1980s, in the late 1990s, another wave (consisting of Westinghouse, Tyco, and others) tried and failed to emulate GE&#x27;s success.

 GE is planning to set up a silicon carbide chip packaging R&amp;D center in coalition with SUNY Polytechnic Institute in Utica, New York. The project will create 470 jobs with the potential to grow to 820 jobs within 10 years.

On September 14, 2015, GE announced the creation of a new unit: GE Digital, which will bring together its software and IT capabilities. The new business unit will be headed by Bill Ruh, who joined GE in 2011 from Cisco Systems and has since worked on GE&#x27;s software efforts.

Morgan Stanley sold a stake in GE HealthCare Technologies for $1.1 billion as part of a deal to swap General Electric Co. debt for GE HealthCare stock.

===Former divisions===
GE Industrial was a division providing appliances, lighting, and industrial products; factory automation systems; plastics, silicones, and quartz products; security and sensors technology; and equipment financing, management, and operating services. As of 2007, it had 70,000 employees, generating $17.7 billion in revenue. After some major realignments in late 2007, GE Industrial was organized in two main sub businesses:
* GE Consumer &amp; Industrial
** Appliances
** Electrical Distribution
** Lighting
* GE Enterprise Solutions
** Digital Energy
** GE Fanuc Intelligent Platforms
** Security
** Sensing &amp; Inspection Technologies

The former GE Plastics division was sold in August 2007 and is now SABIC Innovative Plastics.

On May 4, 2008, it was announced that GE would auction off its appliances business for an expected sale of $5–8 billion. However, this plan fell through as a result of the recession.

The former GE Appliances and Lighting segment was dissolved in 2014 when GE&#x27;s appliance division was attempted to be sold to Electrolux for $5.4 billion, but eventually sold it to Haier in June 2016 due to antitrust filing against Electrolux. GE Lighting (consumer lighting) and the newly created Current, powered by GE, which deals in commercial LED, solar, EV, and energy storage, became stand-alone businesses within the company, until the sale of the latter to American Industrial Partners in April 2019.

The former GE Transportation division merged with Wabtec on February 25, 2019, leaving GE with a 24.9% holding in Wabtec.

On July 1, 2020, GE Lighting was acquired by Savant Systems and remains headquartered at Nela Park in East Cleveland, Ohio.

==Environmental record==
===Carbon footprint===
General Electric Company reported Total CO2e emissions (direct + indirect) for the twelve months ending 31 December 2020 at 2,080 Kt (-310 /-13% y-o-y). There has been a consistent declining trend in reported emissions since 2016.

===Pollution===
Some of GE&#x27;s activities have given rise to large-scale air and water pollution. Based on data from 2000, Researchers at the Political Economy Research Institute listed the corporation as the fourth-largest corporate producer of air pollution in the United States (behind only E. I. Du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co., United States Steel Corp., and ConocoPhillips), with more than 4.4 million pounds per year (2,000 tons) of toxic chemicals released into the air. GE has also been implicated in the creation of toxic waste. According to United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) documents, only the United States Government, Honeywell, and Chevron Corporation are responsible for producing more Superfund toxic waste sites.

In 1983, New York State Attorney General Robert Abrams filed suit in the United States District Court for the Northern District of New York to compel GE to pay for the clean-up of what was claimed to be more than 100,000 tons of chemicals dumped from their plant in Waterford, New York, which polluted nearby groundwater and the Hudson River. In 1999, the company agreed to pay a $250 million settlement in connection with claims it polluted the Housatonic River (at Pittsfield, Massachusetts) and other sites with polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and other hazardous substances.

In 2003, acting on concerns that the plan proposed by GE did not &quot;provide for adequate protection of public health and the environment,&quot; EPA issued an administrative order for the company to &quot;address cleanup at the GE site&quot; in Rome, Georgia, also contaminated with PCBs.

The nuclear reactors involved in the 2011 crisis at Fukushima I in Japan were GE designs, and the architectural designs were done by Ebasco, formerly owned by GE. Concerns over the design and safety of these reactors were raised as early as 1972, but tsunami danger was not discussed at that time. , the same model nuclear reactors designed by GE are operating in the US; however, as of May 31, 2019, the controversial Pilgrim Nuclear Generating Station, in Plymouth, Massachusetts, has been shut down and is in the process of decommission.

====Pollution of the Hudson River====

GE heavily contaminated the Hudson River with PCBs between 1947 and 1977. This pollution caused a range of harmful effects to wildlife and people who eat fish from the river. In 1983 EPA declared a 200-mile (320 km) stretch of the river, from Hudson Falls to New York City, to be a Superfund site requiring cleanup. This Superfund site is considered to be one of the largest in the nation. In addition to receiving extensive fines, GE is continuing its sediment removal operations, pursuant to the Superfund orders, in the 21st century.

====Pollution of the Housatonic River====
From until 1977, GE polluted the Housatonic River with PCB discharges from its plant at Pittsfield, Massachusetts. EPA designated the Pittsfield plant and several miles of the Housatonic to be a Superfund site in 1997, and ordered GE to remediate the site. Aroclor 1254 and Aroclor 1260, products manufactured by Monsanto, were the principal contaminants that were discharged into the river. The highest concentrations of PCBs in the Housatonic River are found in Woods Pond in Lenox, Massachusetts, just south of Pittsfield, where they have been measured up to 110 mg/kg in the sediment. About 50% of all the PCBs currently in the river are estimated to be retained in the sediment behind Woods Pond dam. This is estimated to be about of PCBs. Formerly filled oxbows are also polluted. Waterfowl and fish who live in and around the river contain significant levels of PCBs and can present health risks if consumed. In 2020 GE completed remediation and restoration of its 10 manufacturing plant areas within the city of Pittsfield. plans for cleanup of the river south of the city are not finalized.

== Social responsibility ==

=== Environmental initiatives ===
The environmental work and research of GE can be seen as early as 1968 with the experimental Delta electric car built by the GE Research and Development Center led by Bruce Laumeister. The electric car led to the production shortly after of the cutting-edge technology of the first commercially produced all-electric Elec-Trak garden tractor, which was manufactured from around 1969 until 1975.

On June 6, 2011, GE announced that it had licensed solar thermal technology from California-based eSolar for use in power plants that use both solar and natural gas.

On May 26, 2011, GE unveiled its EV Solar Carport, a carport that incorporates solar panels on its roof, with electric vehicle charging stations under its cover.

In May 2005, GE announced the launch of a program called &quot;Ecomagination&quot;, intended, in the words of CEO Jeff Immelt, &quot;to develop tomorrow&#x27;s solutions such as solar energy, hybrid locomotives, fuel cells, lower-emission aircraft engines, lighter and stronger durable materials, efficient lighting, and water purification technology&quot;. The announcement prompted an op-ed piece in &quot;The New York Times&quot; to observe that, &quot;while General Electric&#x27;s increased emphasis on clean technology will probably result in improved products and benefit its bottom line, Mr. Immelt&#x27;s credibility as a spokesman on national environmental policy is fatally flawed because of his company&#x27;s intransigence in cleaning up its own toxic legacy.&quot;

GE has said that it will invest $1.4 billion in clean technology research and development in 2008 as part of its Ecomagination initiative. As of October 2008, the scheme had resulted in 70 green products being brought to market, ranging from halogen lamps to biogas engines. In 2007, GE raised the annual revenue target for its Ecomagination initiative from $20 billion in 2010 to $25 billion following positive market response to its new product lines. In 2010, GE continued to raise its investment by adding $10 billion into Ecomagination over the next five years.

GE Energy&#x27;s renewable energy business has expanded greatly to keep up with growing U.S. and global demand for clean energy. Since entering the renewable energy industry in 2002, GE has invested more than $850 million in renewable energy commercialization. In August 2008, it acquired Kelman Ltd, a Northern Ireland-based company specializing in advanced monitoring and diagnostics technologies for transformers used in renewable energy generation and announced an expansion of its business in Northern Ireland in May 2010. In 2009, GE&#x27;s renewable energy initiatives, which include solar power, wind power and GE Jenbacher gas engines using renewable and non-renewable methane-based gases, employ more than 4,900 people globally and have created more than 10,000 supporting jobs.

GE Energy and Orion New Zealand (Orion) have announced the implementation of the first phase of a GE network management system to help improve power reliability for customers. GE&#x27;s ENMAC Distribution Management System is the foundation of Orion&#x27;s initiative. The system of smart grid technologies will significantly improve the network company&#x27;s ability to manage big network emergencies and help it restore power faster when outages occur.

In June 2018, GE Volunteers, an internal group of GE employees, along with the Malaysian Nature Society, transplanted more than 270 plants from the Taman Tugu forest reserve so that they may be replanted in a forest trail that is under construction.

===Educational initiatives===
GE Healthcare is collaborating with the Wayne State University School of Medicine and the Medical University of South Carolina to offer an integrated radiology curriculum during their respective MD Programs led by investigators of the Advanced Diagnostic Ultrasound in Microgravity study. GE has donated over one million dollars of Logiq E Ultrasound equipment to these two institutions.

===Marketing initiatives===
Between September 2011 and April 2013, GE ran a content marketing campaign dedicated to telling the stories of &quot;innovators—people who are reshaping the world through act or invention.&quot; The initiative included 30 3-minute films from leading documentary film directors (Albert Maysles, Jessica Yu, Leslie Iwerks, Steve James, Alex Gibney, Lixin Fan, Gary Hustwit and others), and a user-generated competition that received over 600 submissions, out of which 20 finalists were chosen.

&quot;Short Films, Big Ideas&quot; was launched at the 2011 Toronto International Film Festival in partnership with cinelan. Stories included breakthroughs in Slingshot (water vapor distillation system), cancer research, energy production, pain management, and food access. Each of the 30 films received world premiere screenings at a major international film festival, including the Sundance Film Festival and the Tribeca Film Festival. The winning amateur director film, &quot;The Cyborg Foundation&quot;, was awarded a prize at the 2013 Sundance Film Festival. According to GE, the campaign garnered more than 1.5 billion total media impressions, 14 million online views, and was seen in 156 countries.

In January 2017, GE signed an estimated $7 million deal with the Boston Celtics to have its corporate logo put on the NBA team&#x27;s jersey.

=== Charity ===

On March 3, 2022, GE published an international memo pledging to donate $4.5 million to Ukraine amid Russian invasion. According to the memo, $4 million will be used for medical equipment, $400,000 for emergency cash for refugees, and $100,000 will go to Airlink, an NGO that helps communities in crisis.

==Political affiliation==
In the 1950s, GE sponsored Ronald Reagan&#x27;s TV career and launched him on the lecture circuit. GE has also designed social programs, supported civil rights organizations, and funded minority education programs.

==Notable appearances in media==
In the early 1950s, Kurt Vonnegut was a writer for GE. A number of his novels and stories (notably &quot;Cat&#x27;s Cradle&quot; and &quot;Player Piano&quot;) refer to the fictional city of Ilium, which appears to be loosely based on Schenectady, New York. The Ilium Works is the setting for the short story &quot;Deer in the Works&quot;.

In 1981, GE won a Clio award for its 30 Soft White Light Bulbs commercial, We Bring Good Things to Life. The slogan &quot;We Bring Good Things to Life&quot; was created by Phil Dusenberry at the ad agency BBDO.

GE was the primary focus of a 1991 short subject Academy Award-winning documentary, &quot;Deadly Deception: General Electric, Nuclear Weapons, and Our Environment&quot;, that juxtaposed GE&#x27;s &quot;We Bring Good Things To Life&quot; commercials with the true stories of workers and neighbors whose lives have been affected by the company&#x27;s activities involving nuclear weapons.

GE was frequently mentioned and parodied in the NBC comedy sitcom &quot;30 Rock&quot; from 2006 to 2013. Former General Electric CEO Jack Welch even cameoed as himself, appearing in the season four episode &quot;Future Husband&quot;. The episode is a satirical reference to the real-world acquisition of NBC Universal from General Electric by Comcast in November 2009.

In 2013, GE received a National Jefferson Award for Outstanding Service by a Major Corporation.

== Branding ==

The General Electric logo has a blue circle with a white outline. It has four white lines which &quot;suggest the blades of a midcentury tabletop fan.&quot; In the center of the circle is the letters &quot;GE.&quot; Its design has changed little throughout the company&#x27;s history. The logo is officially known as the Monogram but is also known by some as &quot;the meatball.&quot;

<doc id="12731" wikidata="Q2643" url="?curid=12731" title="George Harrison">
<text>George Harrison (25 February 1943 – 29 November 2001) was an English musician, singer and songwriter who achieved international fame as the lead guitarist of the Beatles. Sometimes called &quot;the quiet Beatle&quot;, Harrison embraced Indian culture and helped broaden the scope of popular music through his incorporation of Indian instrumentation and Hindu-aligned spirituality in the Beatles&#x27; work. 

Although most of the band&#x27;s songs were written by John Lennon and Paul McCartney, most Beatles albums from 1965 onwards contained at least two Harrison compositions. His songs for the group include &quot;Taxman&quot;, &quot;Within You Without You&quot;, &quot;While My Guitar Gently Weeps&quot;, &quot;Something&quot; and &quot;Here Comes the Sun&quot;. Harrison&#x27;s earliest musical influences included George Formby and Django Reinhardt; subsequent influences were Carl Perkins, Chet Atkins and Chuck Berry. By 1965, he had begun to lead the Beatles into folk rock through his interest in Bob Dylan and the Byrds, and towards Indian classical music through his use of Indian instruments, such as the sitar, which he had become acquainted with on the set of the film &quot;Help!.&quot; He played sitar on numerous Beatles songs, starting with &quot;Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)&quot;. Having initiated the band&#x27;s embrace of Transcendental Meditation in 1967, he subsequently developed an association with the Hare Krishna movement. 

After the Beatles disbanded, Harrison released the triple album &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot;, a critically acclaimed work that produced his most successful hit single, &quot;My Sweet Lord&quot;, and introduced his signature sound as a solo artist, the slide guitar. He also organised the 1971 Concert for Bangladesh with Indian musician Ravi Shankar, a precursor to later benefit concerts such as Live Aid. In his role as a music and film producer, Harrison produced acts signed to the Beatles&#x27; Apple record label before founding Dark Horse Records in 1974. He co-founded HandMade Films in 1978, initially to produce the Monty Python troupe&#x27;s comedy film &quot;The Life of Brian&quot; (1979).

Harrison released several best-selling singles and albums as a solo performer. In 1988, he co-founded the platinum-selling supergroup the Traveling Wilburys. A prolific recording artist, he was featured as a guest guitarist on tracks by Badfinger, Ronnie Wood, and Billy Preston, and collaborated on songs and music with Dylan, Eric Clapton, Ringo Starr, and Tom Petty. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine ranked him number 31 in their 2023 list of greatest guitarists of all time. He is a two-time Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductee – as a member of the Beatles in 1988, and posthumously for his solo career in 2004.

Harrison&#x27;s first marriage to model Pattie Boyd in 1966 ended in divorce in 1977. In the following year he married Olivia Arias, with whom he had a son, Dhani. A lifelong cigarette smoker, Harrison died of numerous cancers in 2001 at the age of 58, two years after surviving a knife attack by an intruder at his home, Friar Park. His remains were cremated, and the ashes were scattered according to Hindu tradition in a private ceremony in the Ganges and Yamuna rivers in India. He left an estate of almost £100 million.

== Early years: 1943–1958==

George Harrison was born at 12 Arnold Grove in Wavertree, Liverpool, on 25 February 1943. He was the youngest of four children of Harold Hargreaves (or Hargrove) Harrison (1909–1978) and Louise (née French; 1911–1970). Harold was a bus conductor who had worked as a ship&#x27;s steward on the White Star Line, and Louise was a shop assistant of Irish Catholic descent. He had one sister, Louise (16 August 1931 – 29 January 2023), and two brothers, Harold (20 July 1934 - ?) and Peter (20 July 1940 – 1 June 2007).

According to Boyd, Harrison&#x27;s mother was particularly supportive: &quot;All she wanted for her children is that they should be happy, and she recognised that nothing made George quite as happy as making music.&quot; Louise was an enthusiastic music fan, and she was known among friends for her loud singing voice, which at times startled visitors by rattling the Harrisons&#x27; windows. When Louise was pregnant with George, she often listened to the weekly broadcast &quot;Radio India&quot;. Harrison&#x27;s biographer Joshua Greene wrote, &quot;Every Sunday she tuned in to mystical sounds evoked by sitars and tablas, hoping that the exotic music would bring peace and calm to the baby in the womb.&quot;

Harrison lived at 12 Arnold Grove until 1 January 1950. A terraced house on a cul-de-sac, it had an outdoor toilet, and its only heat came from a single coal fire. In the autumn of 1949, the family was offered a council house and moved to 25 Upton Green, Speke. In 1948, Harrison enrolled at Dovedale Primary School. He passed the eleven-plus exam and attended Liverpool Institute High School for Boys from 1954 to 1959. Though the institute did offer a music course, Harrison was disappointed with the absence of guitars, and felt that the school &quot;moulded [students] into being frightened&quot;.

Harrison&#x27;s earliest musical influences included George Formby, Cab Calloway, Django Reinhardt and Hoagy Carmichael; by the 1950s, Carl Perkins and Lonnie Donegan were significant influences. In early 1956, he had an epiphany: while riding his bicycle, he heard Elvis Presley&#x27;s &quot;Heartbreak Hotel&quot; playing from a nearby house, and the song piqued his interest in rock and roll. He often sat at the back of the class drawing guitars in his schoolbooks, and later commented, &quot;I was totally into guitars.&quot; Harrison cited Slim Whitman as another early influence: &quot;The first person I ever saw playing a guitar was Slim Whitman, either a photo of him in a magazine or live on television. Guitars were definitely coming in.&quot;

When George Harrison was about 14, a friend of Harrison, Raymond Hughes, offered to sell a guitar. Harrison&#x27;s mother then paid for the guitar, which cost £3.10s.– (equivalent to £ in 2025). One of his father&#x27;s friends taught Harrison how to play &quot;Whispering&quot;, &quot;Sweet Sue&quot; and &quot;Dinah&quot;. Inspired by Donegan&#x27;s music, Harrison formed a skiffle group, the Rebels, with his brother Peter and a friend, Arthur Kelly. On the bus to school, Harrison met Paul McCartney, who also attended the Liverpool Institute, and the pair bonded over their shared love of music.

==The Beatles: 1958–1970==

McCartney and his friend John Lennon were in a skiffle group called the Quarrymen. In March 1958, at McCartney&#x27;s urging, Harrison auditioned for the Quarrymen at Rory Storm&#x27;s Morgue Skiffle Club, playing Arthur &quot;Guitar Boogie&quot; Smith&#x27;s &quot;Guitar Boogie Shuffle&quot;, but Lennon felt that Harrison, having just turned 15, was too young to join the band. McCartney arranged a second meeting, on the upper deck of a Liverpool bus, during which Harrison impressed Lennon by performing the lead guitar part for the instrumental &quot;Raunchy&quot;. He began socialising with the group, filling in on guitar as needed, and then became accepted as a member. Although his father wanted him to continue his education, Harrison left school at 16 and worked for several months as an apprentice electrician at Blacklers, a local department store. During the group&#x27;s first tour of Scotland, in 1960, Harrison used the pseudonym &quot;Carl Harrison&quot;, in reference to Carl Perkins.
In 1960, promoter Allan Williams arranged for the band, now calling themselves the Beatles, to play at the Indra and Kaiserkeller clubs in Hamburg, both owned by Bruno Koschmider. Their first residency in Hamburg ended prematurely when Harrison was deported for being too young to work in nightclubs. When Brian Epstein became their manager in December 1961, he polished up their image and later secured them a recording contract with EMI. The group&#x27;s first single, &quot;Love Me Do&quot;, peaked at number 17 on the &quot;Record Retailer&quot; chart, and by the time their debut album, &quot;Please Please Me&quot;, was released in early 1963, Beatlemania had arrived. Often serious and focused while on stage with the band, Harrison was known as &quot;the quiet Beatle&quot;. That moniker arose when the Beatles arrived in the United States in early 1964, and Harrison was ill with a case of Strep throat and a fever and was medically advised to limit speaking as much as possible until he performed on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot; as scheduled. As such, the press noticed Harrison&#x27;s apparent laconic nature in public appearances on that tour and the subsequent nickname stuck, much to Harrison&#x27;s amusement. He had two lead vocal credits on the LP, including the Lennon–McCartney song &quot;Do You Want to Know a Secret?&quot;, and three on their second album, &quot;With the Beatles&quot; (1963). The latter included &quot;Don&#x27;t Bother Me&quot;, Harrison&#x27;s first solo writing credit.
Harrison served as the Beatles&#x27; scout for new American releases, being especially knowledgeable about soul music. By 1965&#x27;s &quot;Rubber Soul&quot;, he had begun to lead the other Beatles into folk rock through his interest in the Byrds and Bob Dylan, and towards Indian classical music through his use of the sitar on &quot;Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)&quot;. He later called &quot;Rubber Soul&quot; his &quot;favourite [Beatles] album&quot;. &quot;Revolver&quot; (1966) included three of his compositions: &quot;Taxman&quot;, selected as the album&#x27;s opening track, &quot;Love You To&quot; and &quot;I Want to Tell You&quot;. His drone-like tambura part on Lennon&#x27;s &quot;Tomorrow Never Knows&quot; exemplified the band&#x27;s ongoing exploration of non-Western instruments, while the sitar- and tabla-based &quot;Love You To&quot; represented the Beatles&#x27; first genuine foray into Indian music. According to the ethnomusicologist David Reck, the latter song set a precedent in popular music as an example of Asian culture being represented by Westerners respectfully and without parody. Author Nicholas Schaffner wrote in 1978 that following Harrison&#x27;s increased association with the sitar after &quot;Norwegian Wood&quot;, he became known as &quot;the maharaja of raga-rock&quot;. Harrison continued to develop his interest in non-Western instrumentation, playing swarmandal on &quot;Strawberry Fields Forever&quot;.

By late 1966, Harrison&#x27;s interests had moved away from the Beatles. This was reflected in his choice of Eastern gurus and religious leaders for inclusion on the album cover for &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot; in 1967. His sole composition on the album was the Indian-inspired &quot;Within You Without You&quot;, to which no other Beatle contributed. He played sitar and tambura on the track, backed by musicians from the London Asian Music Circle on dilruba, swarmandal and tabla. He later commented on the &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; album: &quot;It was a millstone and a milestone in the music industry ... There&#x27;s about half the songs I like and the other half I can&#x27;t stand.&quot;

In January 1968, he recorded the basic track for his song &quot;The Inner Light&quot; at EMI&#x27;s studio in Bombay, using a group of local musicians playing traditional Indian instruments. Released as the B-side to McCartney&#x27;s &quot;Lady Madonna&quot;, it was the first Harrison composition to appear on a Beatles single. Derived from a quotation from the &quot;Tao Te Ching&quot;, the song&#x27;s lyric reflected Harrison&#x27;s deepening interest in Hinduism and meditation. During the recording of &quot;The Beatles&quot; that same year, tensions within the group ran high, and drummer Ringo Starr quit briefly. Harrison&#x27;s four songwriting contributions to the double album included &quot;While My Guitar Gently Weeps&quot;, which featured Eric Clapton on lead guitar, and the horn-driven &quot;Savoy Truffle&quot;.
Dylan and the Band were a major musical influence on Harrison at the end of his career with the Beatles. While on a visit to Woodstock in late 1968, he established a friendship with Dylan and found himself drawn to the Band&#x27;s sense of communal music-making and to the creative equality among the band members, which contrasted with Lennon and McCartney&#x27;s domination of the Beatles&#x27; songwriting and creative direction. This coincided with a prolific period in his songwriting and a growing desire to assert his independence from the Beatles. Tensions among the group surfaced again in January 1969, at Twickenham Studios, during the filmed rehearsals that became the 1970 documentary &quot;Let It Be&quot;. Frustrated by the cold and sterile film studio, by Lennon&#x27;s creative disengagement from the Beatles, and by what he perceived as a domineering attitude from McCartney, Harrison quit the group on 10 January. He returned 12 days later, after his bandmates had agreed to move the film project to their own Apple Studio and to abandon McCartney&#x27;s plan for making a return to public performance.
Relations among the Beatles were more cordial, though still strained, when the band recorded their 1969 album &quot;Abbey Road&quot;. The LP included what Lavezzoli describes as &quot;two classic contributions&quot; from Harrison – &quot;Here Comes the Sun&quot; and &quot;Something&quot; – that saw him &quot;finally achieve equal songwriting status&quot; with Lennon and McCartney. During the album&#x27;s recording, Harrison asserted more creative control than before, rejecting suggestions for changes to his music, particularly from McCartney. &quot;Something&quot; became his first A-side when issued on a double A-side single with &quot;Come Together&quot;; the song was number one in Canada, Australia, New Zealand and West Germany, and the combined sides topped the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart in the United States. In the 1970s Frank Sinatra recorded &quot;Something&quot; twice (1970 and 1979) and later dubbed it &quot;the greatest love song of the past fifty years&quot;. Lennon considered it the best song on &quot;Abbey Road&quot;, and it became the Beatles&#x27; second most covered song after &quot;Yesterday&quot;.
In May 1970, Harrison&#x27;s song &quot;For You Blue&quot; was coupled on a US single with McCartney&#x27;s &quot;The Long and Winding Road&quot; and became Harrison&#x27;s second chart-topper when the sides were listed together at number one on the Hot 100. His increased productivity meant that by the time of their break-up he had amassed a stockpile of unreleased compositions. While Harrison grew as a songwriter, his compositional presence on Beatles albums remained limited to two or three songs, increasing his frustration, and significantly contributing to the band&#x27;s break-up. Harrison&#x27;s last recording session with the Beatles was on 4 January 1970, when he, McCartney and Starr recorded overdubs to the song &quot;Let It Be&quot; for the soundtrack album of the same name.

==Solo career: 1968–1987==
===Early solo work: 1968–1969===

Before the Beatles&#x27; break-up, Harrison had already recorded and released two solo albums: &quot;Wonderwall Music&quot; and &quot;Electronic Sound&quot;, both of which contain mainly instrumental compositions. &quot;Wonderwall Music&quot;, a soundtrack to the 1968 film &quot;Wonderwall&quot;, blends Indian and Western instrumentation, while &quot;Electronic Sound&quot; is an experimental album that prominently features a Moog synthesizer. Released in November 1968, &quot;Wonderwall Music&quot; was the first solo album by a Beatle and the first LP released by Apple Records. Indian musicians Aashish Khan and Shivkumar Sharma performed on the album, which contains the experimental sound collage &quot;Dream Scene&quot;, recorded several months before Lennon&#x27;s &quot;Revolution 9&quot;.

In December 1969, Harrison participated in a brief tour of Europe with the American group Delaney &amp; Bonnie and Friends. During the tour, which included Clapton, Bobby Whitlock, drummer Jim Gordon and band leaders Delaney and Bonnie Bramlett, Harrison began to play slide guitar, and also began to write &quot;My Sweet Lord&quot;, which became his first single as a solo artist.

===&quot;All Things Must Pass&quot;: 1970===

For many years, Harrison was restricted in his songwriting contributions to the Beatles&#x27; albums, but he released &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot;, a triple album with two discs of his songs and the third of recordings of Harrison jamming with friends. The album was regarded by many as his best work, and it topped the charts on both sides of the Atlantic. The number-one hit single &quot;My Sweet Lord&quot; and the top-ten single &quot;What Is Life&quot; were taken from the album, which was co-produced by Phil Spector using his &quot;Wall of Sound&quot; approach; the musicians included Starr, Clapton, Gary Wright, Billy Preston, Klaus Voormann, the whole of Delaney and Bonnie&#x27;s Friends band, and the Apple group Badfinger. On its release, &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot; was received with critical acclaim; Ben Gerson of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; described it as being &quot;of classic Spectorian proportions, Wagnerian, Brucknerian, the music of mountain tops and vast horizons&quot;. Author and musicologist Ian Inglis considers the lyrics of the album&#x27;s title track &quot;a recognition of the impermanence of human existence ... a simple and poignant conclusion&quot; to Harrison&#x27;s former band. In 1971, Bright Tunes sued Harrison for copyright infringement over &quot;My Sweet Lord&quot;, owing to its similarity to the 1963 Chiffons hit &quot;He&#x27;s So Fine&quot;. When the case was heard in the United States district court in 1976, he denied deliberately plagiarising the song, but lost the case, as the judge ruled that he had done so subconsciously.

In 2000, Apple Records released a thirtieth-anniversary edition of the album, and Harrison actively participated in its promotion. In an interview, he reflected on the work: &quot;It&#x27;s just something that was like my continuation from the Beatles, really. It was me sort of getting out of the Beatles and just going my own way ... it was a very happy occasion.&quot; He commented on the production: &quot;Well, in those days it was like the reverb was kind of used a bit more than what I would do now. In fact, I don&#x27;t use reverb at all. I can&#x27;t stand it ... You know, it&#x27;s hard to go back to anything thirty years later and expect it to be how you would want it now.&quot;

===The Concert for Bangladesh: 1971===
Harrison responded to a request from Ravi Shankar by organising a charity event, the Concert for Bangladesh, which took place on 1 August 1971. The event drew over 40,000 people to two shows in New York&#x27;s Madison Square Garden. The goal of the event was to raise money to aid starving refugees during the Bangladesh Liberation War. Shankar opened the show, which featured popular musicians such as Dylan, Clapton, Leon Russell, Badfinger, Preston and Starr.

A triple album, &quot;The Concert for Bangladesh&quot;, was released by Apple in December, followed by a concert film in 1972. Credited to &quot;George Harrison and Friends&quot;, the album topped the UK chart and peaked at number 2 in the US, and went on to win the Grammy Award for Album of the Year. Tax troubles and questionable expenses later tied up many of the proceeds, but Harrison commented: &quot;Mainly the concert was to attract attention to the situation ... The money we raised was secondary, and although we had some money problems ... they still got plenty ... even though it was a drop in the ocean. The main thing was, we spread the word and helped get the war ended.&quot;

===&quot;Living in the Material World&quot; to &quot;George Harrison&quot;: 1973–1979===

Harrison&#x27;s 1973 album &quot;Living in the Material World&quot; held the number one spot on the &quot;Billboard&quot; albums chart for five weeks, and the album&#x27;s single, &quot;Give Me Love (Give Me Peace on Earth)&quot;, also reached number one in the US. In the UK, the LP peaked at number two and the single reached number 8. The album was lavishly produced and packaged, and its dominant message was Harrison&#x27;s Hindu beliefs. In Greene&#x27;s opinion it &quot;contained many of the strongest compositions of his career&quot;. Stephen Holden, writing in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, felt the album was &quot;vastly appealing&quot; and &quot;profoundly seductive&quot;, and that it stood &quot;alone as an article of faith, miraculous in its radiance&quot;. Other reviewers were less enthusiastic, describing the release as awkward, sanctimonious and overly sentimental.

In November 1974, Harrison became the first ex-Beatle to tour North America when he began his 45-date Dark Horse Tour. The shows included guest spots by his band members Billy Preston and Tom Scott, and traditional and contemporary Indian music performed by &quot;Ravi Shankar, Family and Friends&quot;. Despite numerous positive reviews, the consensus reaction to the tour was negative. Some fans found Shankar&#x27;s significant presence to be a bizarre disappointment, and many were affronted by what Inglis described as Harrison&#x27;s &quot;sermonizing&quot;. Further, he reworked the lyrics to several Beatles songs, and his laryngitis-affected vocals led to some critics calling the tour &quot;dark hoarse&quot;. The author Robert Rodriguez commented: &quot;While the Dark Horse tour might be considered a noble failure, there were a number of fans who were tuned-in to what was being attempted. They went away ecstatic, conscious that they had just witnessed something so uplifting that it could never be repeated.&quot; Simon Leng called the tour &quot;groundbreaking&quot; and &quot;revolutionary in its presentation of Indian Music&quot;.

On 16 November 1974, Harrison and several others involved in the tour visited the White House. They were invited by President Gerald Ford&#x27;s son, Jack.

In December, Harrison released &quot;Dark Horse&quot;, which was an album that earned him the least favourable reviews of his career. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; called it &quot;the chronicle of a performer out of his element, working to a deadline, enfeebling his overtaxed talents by a rush to deliver a new &#x27;LP product&#x27;, rehearse a band, and assemble a cross-country tour, all within three weeks&quot;. The album reached number 4 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; chart and the single &quot;Dark Horse&quot; reached number 15, but they failed to make an impact in the UK. The music critic Mikal Gilmore described &quot;Dark Horse&quot; as &quot;one of Harrison&#x27;s most fascinating works – a record about change and loss&quot;.
Harrison&#x27;s final studio album for EMI and Apple Records, the soul music-inspired &quot;Extra Texture (Read All About It)&quot; (1975), peaked at number 8 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; chart and number 16 in the UK. Harrison considered it the least satisfactory of the three albums he had recorded since &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot;. Leng identified &quot;bitterness and dismay&quot; in many of the tracks; his long-time friend Klaus Voormann commented: &quot;He wasn&#x27;t up for it ... It was a terrible time because I think there was a lot of cocaine going around, and that&#x27;s when I got out of the picture ... I didn&#x27;t like his frame of mind&quot;. He released two singles from the LP: &quot;You&quot;, which reached the &quot;Billboard&quot; top 20, and &quot;This Guitar (Can&#x27;t Keep from Crying)&quot;, Apple&#x27;s final original single release.

&quot;Thirty Three &amp; 1/3&quot; (1976), Harrison&#x27;s first album release on his own Dark Horse Records label, produced the hit singles &quot;This Song&quot; and &quot;Crackerbox Palace&quot;, both of which reached the top 25 in the US. The surreal humour of &quot;Crackerbox Palace&quot; reflected Harrison&#x27;s association with Monty Python&#x27;s Eric Idle, who directed a comical music video for the song. With an emphasis on melody and musicianship, and a more subtle subject matter than the pious message of his earlier works, &quot;Thirty Three &amp; 1/3&quot; earned Harrison his most favourable critical notices in the US since &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot;. The album peaked just outside the top ten there, but outsold his previous two LPs. As part of his promotion for the release, Harrison performed on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; with Paul Simon.

In 1979, Harrison released &quot;George Harrison&quot;, which followed his second marriage and the birth of his son Dhani. Co-produced by Russ Titelman, the album and the single &quot;Blow Away&quot; both made the &quot;Billboard&quot; top 20. The album marked the beginning of Harrison&#x27;s gradual retreat from the music business, with several of the songs having been written in the tranquil setting of Maui in the Hawaiian archipelago. Leng described &quot;George Harrison&quot; as &quot;melodic and lush ... peaceful ... the work of a man who had lived the rock and roll dream twice over and was now embracing domestic as well as spiritual bliss&quot;.

===&quot;Somewhere in England&quot; to &quot;Cloud Nine&quot;: 1980–1987===
The murder of John Lennon on 8 December 1980 disturbed Harrison and reinforced his decades-long concern about stalkers. The tragedy was also a deep personal loss, although Harrison and Lennon had little contact in the years before Lennon was killed. Following the murder, Harrison commented: &quot;After all we went through together I had and still have great love and respect for John Lennon. I am shocked and stunned.&quot; Harrison modified the lyrics of a song he had written for Starr to make the song a tribute to Lennon. &quot;All Those Years Ago&quot;, which included vocal contributions from Paul and Linda McCartney, as well as Starr&#x27;s original drum part, peaked at number two in the US charts. The single was included on the album &quot;Somewhere in England&quot; in 1981.

Harrison did not release any new albums for five years after 1982&#x27;s &quot;Gone Troppo&quot; received little notice from critics or the public. During this period he made several guest appearances, including a 1985 performance at a tribute to Carl Perkins titled &quot;Blue Suede Shoes: A Rockabilly Session&quot;. In March 1986 he made a surprise appearance during the finale of the Birmingham Heart Beat Charity Concert, an event organised to raise money for the Birmingham Children&#x27;s Hospital. The following year, he appeared at The Prince&#x27;s Trust concert at London&#x27;s Wembley Arena, performing &quot;While My Guitar Gently Weeps&quot; and &quot;Here Comes the Sun&quot;. In February 1987 he joined Dylan, John Fogerty and Jesse Ed Davis on stage for a two-hour performance with the blues musician Taj Mahal. Harrison recalled: &quot;Bob rang me up and asked if I wanted to come out for the evening and see Taj Mahal ... So we went there and had a few of these Mexican beers – and had a few more ... Bob says, &#x27;Hey, why don&#x27;t we all get up and play, and you can sing?&#x27; But every time I got near the microphone, Dylan comes up and just starts singing this rubbish in my ear, trying to throw me.&quot;

In November 1987, Harrison released the platinum album &quot;Cloud Nine&quot;. Co-produced with Jeff Lynne of Electric Light Orchestra (ELO), the album included Harrison&#x27;s rendition of James Ray&#x27;s &quot;Got My Mind Set on You&quot;, which went to number one in the US and number two in the UK. The accompanying music video received substantial airplay, and another single, &quot;When We Was Fab&quot;, a retrospective of the Beatles&#x27; career, earned two MTV Music Video Awards nominations in 1988. Recorded at his estate in Friar Park, Harrison&#x27;s slide guitar playing featured prominently on the album, which included several of his long-time musical collaborators, including Clapton, Jim Keltner and Jim Horn. &quot;Cloud Nine&quot; reached number eight and number ten on the US and UK charts respectively, and several tracks from the album achieved placement on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Mainstream Rock chart – &quot;Devil&#x27;s Radio&quot;, &quot;This Is Love&quot; and &quot;Cloud 9&quot;.

==Later career: 1988–1996==
===The Traveling Wilburys and return to touring: 1988–1992===

In 1988, Harrison formed the Traveling Wilburys with Jeff Lynne, Roy Orbison, Bob Dylan and Tom Petty. The band had gathered in Dylan&#x27;s garage to record a song for a Harrison European single release. Harrison&#x27;s record company decided the track, &quot;Handle with Care&quot;, was too good for its original purpose as a B-side and asked for a full album. The LP, &quot;Traveling Wilburys Vol. 1&quot;, was released in October 1988 and recorded under pseudonyms as half-brothers, supposed sons of Charles Truscott Wilbury Sr. It reached number 16 in the UK and number 3 in the US, where it was certified triple platinum. Harrison&#x27;s pseudonym on the album was &quot;Nelson Wilbury&quot;; he used the name &quot;Spike Wilbury&quot; for their second album.

In 1989, Harrison and Starr appeared in the music video for Petty&#x27;s song &quot;I Won&#x27;t Back Down&quot;. In October that year, Harrison assembled and released &quot;Best of Dark Horse 1976–1989&quot;, a compilation of his later solo work. The album included three new songs, including &quot;Cheer Down&quot;, which Harrison had recently contributed to the &quot;Lethal Weapon 2&quot; film soundtrack.

Following Orbison&#x27;s death in December 1988, the Wilburys recorded as a four-piece. Their second album, issued in October 1990, was mischievously titled &quot;Traveling Wilburys Vol. 3&quot;. According to Lynne, &quot;That was George&#x27;s idea. He said, &#x27;Let&#x27;s confuse the buggers. It peaked at number 14 in the UK and number 11 in the US, where it was certified platinum. The Wilburys never performed live, and the group did not record together again following the release of their second album.

In December 1991, Harrison joined Clapton for a tour of Japan. It was Harrison&#x27;s first since 1974 and no others followed. On 6 April 1992, Harrison held a benefit concert for the Natural Law Party at the Royal Albert Hall, his first London performance since the Beatles&#x27; 1969 rooftop concert. In October 1992, he performed at a Bob Dylan tribute concert at Madison Square Garden in New York City, playing alongside Dylan, Clapton, McGuinn, Petty and Neil Young.

===&quot;The Beatles Anthology&quot;: 1994–1996===

In 1994, Harrison began a collaboration with McCartney, Starr and producer Jeff Lynne for the &quot;Beatles Anthology&quot; project. This included the recording of two new Beatles songs built around solo vocal and piano tapes recorded by Lennon as well as lengthy interviews about the Beatles&#x27; career. Released in December 1995, &quot;Free as a Bird&quot; was the first new Beatles single since 1970. In March 1996, they released a second single, &quot;Real Love&quot;. They also attempted to finish a third single, &quot;Now and Then&quot;, but did not finish it because the audio quality of the cassette was, according to Harrison, &quot;fucking rubbish&quot;. The song was later finished by McCartney and Starr and released in 2023. He later commented on the project: &quot;I hope somebody does this to all my crap demos when I&#x27;m dead, make them into hit songs.&quot;

==Later life and death: 1997–2001==
After the &quot;Anthology&quot; project, Harrison collaborated with Ravi Shankar on the latter&#x27;s &quot;Chants of India&quot;. Harrison&#x27;s final television appearance was a VH-1 special to promote the album, taped in May 1997. Soon afterwards, Harrison was diagnosed with throat cancer; he was treated with radiotherapy, which was thought at the time to be successful. He publicly blamed years of smoking for the illness.

In January 1998, Harrison attended Carl Perkins&#x27; funeral in Jackson, Tennessee, where he performed a brief rendition of Perkins&#x27; song &quot;Your True Love&quot;. In May, he represented the Beatles at London&#x27;s High Court in their successful bid to gain control of unauthorised recordings made of a 1962 performance by the band at the Star-Club in Hamburg. The following year, he was the most active of the former Beatles in promoting the reissue of their 1968 animated film &quot;Yellow Submarine&quot;.

=== Attack at Friar Park: 1999 ===

On 30 December 1999, Harrison and his wife Olivia were attacked at their home, Friar Park. The perpetrator was 34-year-old paranoid schizophrenic man Michael Abram, who broke in and attacked Harrison with a kitchen knife, puncturing a lung and causing head injuries before he was incapacitated by Harrison&#x27;s wife, who struck him repeatedly with a fireplace poker and a lamp. Harrison later commented, &quot;I felt exhausted and could feel the strength draining from me. I vividly remember a deliberate thrust to my chest. I could hear my lung exhaling and had blood in my mouth. I believed I had been fatally stabbed.&quot; Following the attack, Harrison was hospitalised with more than 40 stab wounds, and part of his punctured lung was removed. He released a statement soon afterwards regarding his assailant: &quot;He wasn&#x27;t a burglar, and he certainly wasn&#x27;t auditioning for the Traveling Wilburys. Adi Shankara, an Indian historical, spiritual and groovy-type person, once said, &#x27;Life is fragile like a raindrop on a lotus leaf.&#x27; And you&#x27;d better believe it.&quot; Upon being released from a psychiatric institution in 2002, Abram said: &quot;If I could turn back the clock, I would give anything not to have done what I did in attacking George Harrison, but looking back on it now, I have come to understand that I was at the time not in control of my actions. I can only hope the Harrison family might somehow find it in their hearts to accept my apologies.&quot;

The injuries inflicted on Harrison during the home invasion were downplayed by his family in their comments to the press. Having seen Harrison looking so healthy beforehand, those in his social circle believed that the attack brought about a change in him and was the cause for his cancer&#x27;s return.

=== Death: 2001 ===
In May 2001, it was revealed that Harrison had undergone an operation to remove a cancerous growth from one of his lungs, and in July, it was reported that he was being treated for a brain tumour at a clinic in Switzerland. While in Switzerland, Starr visited him but had to cut short his stay to travel to Boston, where his daughter was undergoing emergency brain surgery. Harrison, who was very weak, quipped: &quot;Do you want me to come with you?&quot; In November 2001, he began radiotherapy at Staten Island University Hospital in New York City for non–small cell lung cancer that had spread to his brain. When the news was made public, Harrison, who would die within the month, bemoaned his physician&#x27;s breach of privacy, and his estate later claimed damages.

On 29 November 2001, Harrison died at a property belonging to McCartney, on Heather Road in Beverly Hills, California. He was 58 years old. He died in the company of Olivia, Dhani, Shankar and the latter&#x27;s wife Sukanya and daughter Anoushka, and Hare Krishna devotees Shyamasundar Das and Mukunda Goswami, who chanted verses from the &quot;Bhagavad Gita&quot;. His final message to the world, as relayed in a statement by Olivia and Dhani, was: &quot;Everything else can wait, but the search for God cannot wait, and love one another.&quot; He was cremated at Hollywood Forever Cemetery, and his funeral was held at the Self-Realization Fellowship Lake Shrine in Pacific Palisades, California. His close family scattered his ashes according to Hindu tradition in a private ceremony in the Ganges and Yamuna rivers near Varanasi, India. He left almost £100 million in his will.

=== Final studio album and singles: 2002–2004 ===
Harrison&#x27;s final studio album, &quot;Brainwashed&quot; (2002), was released posthumously after it was completed by his son Dhani and Jeff Lynne. A quotation from the &quot;Bhagavad Gita&quot; is included in the album&#x27;s liner notes: &quot;There never was a time when you or I did not exist. Nor will there be any future when we shall cease to be.&quot; A media-only single, &quot;Stuck Inside a Cloud&quot;, which Leng describes as &quot;a uniquely candid reaction to illness and mortality&quot;, achieved number 27 on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Adult Contemporary chart. The single &quot;Any Road&quot;, released in May 2003, peaked at number 37 on the UK Singles Chart. &quot;Marwa Blues&quot; went on to receive the 2004 Grammy Award for Best Pop Instrumental Performance, while &quot;Any Road&quot; was nominated for Best Male Pop Vocal Performance.

==Musicianship==
===Guitar work===

Harrison&#x27;s guitar work with the Beatles was varied and flexible. Although not fast or flashy, his lead guitar playing was solid and typified the more subdued lead guitar style of the early 1960s. His rhythm guitar playing was innovative, for example when he used a capo to shorten the strings on an acoustic guitar, as on the &quot;Rubber Soul&quot; (1965) album and &quot;Here Comes the Sun&quot;, to create a bright, sweet sound. Eric Clapton felt that Harrison was &quot;clearly an innovator&quot; as he was &quot;taking certain elements of R&amp;B and rock and rockabilly and creating something unique&quot;. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; founder Jann Wenner described Harrison as &quot;a guitarist who was never showy but who had an innate, eloquent melodic sense. He played exquisitely in the service of the song&quot;. The guitar picking style of Chet Atkins and Carl Perkins influenced Harrison, giving a country music feel to many of the Beatles&#x27; recordings. He identified Chuck Berry as another early influence.

In 1961, the Beatles recorded &quot;Cry for a Shadow&quot;, a blues-inspired instrumental co-written by Lennon and Harrison, who is credited with composing the song&#x27;s lead guitar part, building on unusual chord voicings and imitating the style of other English groups such as the Shadows. Harrison&#x27;s liberal use of the diatonic scale in his guitar playing reveals the influence of Buddy Holly, and his interest in Berry inspired him to compose songs based on the blues scale while incorporating a rockabilly feel in the style of Perkins. Another of Harrison&#x27;s musical techniques was the use of guitar lines written in octaves, as on &quot;I&#x27;ll Be on My Way&quot;.

By 1964, he had begun to develop a distinctive personal style as a guitarist, writing parts that featured the use of nonresolving tones, as with the ending chord arpeggios on &quot;A Hard Day&#x27;s Night&quot;. On this and other songs from the period, he used a Rickenbacker 360/12 – an electric guitar with twelve strings, the low eight of which are tuned in pairs, one octave apart, with the higher four being pairs tuned in unison. His use of the Rickenbacker on &quot;A Hard Day&#x27;s Night&quot; helped to popularise the model, and the jangly sound became so prominent that &quot;Melody Maker&quot; termed it the Beatles&#x27; &quot;secret weapon&quot;. In 1965, Harrison used an expression pedal to control his guitar&#x27;s volume on &quot;I Need You&quot;, creating a syncopated flautando effect with the melody resolving its dissonance through tonal displacements. He used the same volume-swell technique on &quot;Yes It Is&quot;, applying what Everett described as &quot;ghostly articulation&quot; to the song&#x27;s natural harmonics.

In 1966, Harrison contributed innovative musical ideas to &quot;Revolver&quot;. He played backwards guitar on Lennon&#x27;s composition &quot;I&#x27;m Only Sleeping&quot; and a guitar counter-melody on &quot;And Your Bird Can Sing&quot; that moved in parallel octaves above McCartney&#x27;s bass downbeats. His guitar playing on &quot;I Want to Tell You&quot; exemplified the pairing of altered chordal colours with descending chromatic lines and his guitar part for &quot;Sgt Pepper&quot;″s &quot;Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds&quot; mirrors Lennon&#x27;s vocal line in much the same way that a sarangi player accompanies a khyal singer in a Hindu devotional song.
Everett described Harrison&#x27;s guitar solo from &quot;Old Brown Shoe&quot; as &quot;stinging [and] highly Claptonesque&quot;. He identified two of the composition&#x27;s significant motifs: a bluesy trichord and a diminished triad with roots in A and E. Huntley called the song &quot;a sizzling rocker with a ferocious ... solo&quot;. In Greene&#x27;s opinion, Harrison&#x27;s demo for &quot;Old Brown Shoe&quot; contains &quot;one of the most complex lead guitar solos on any Beatles song&quot;.

Harrison&#x27;s playing on &quot;Abbey Road&quot;, and in particular on &quot;Something&quot;, marked a significant moment in his development as a guitarist. The song&#x27;s guitar solo shows a varied range of influences, incorporating the blues guitar style of Clapton and the styles of Indian gamakas. According to author and musicologist Kenneth Womack: Something&#x27; meanders toward the most unforgettable of Harrison&#x27;s guitar solos ... A masterpiece in simplicity, [it] reaches toward the sublime&quot;.

After Delaney Bramlett inspired him to learn slide guitar, Harrison began to incorporate it into his solo work, which allowed him to mimic many traditional Indian instruments, including the sarangi and the dilruba. Leng described Harrison&#x27;s slide guitar solo on Lennon&#x27;s &quot;How Do You Sleep?&quot; as a departure for &quot;the sweet soloist of &#x27;Something, calling his playing &quot;rightly famed ... one of Harrison&#x27;s greatest guitar statements&quot;. Lennon commented: &quot;That&#x27;s the best he&#x27;s ever fucking played in his life.&quot;

A Hawaiian influence is notable in much of Harrison&#x27;s music, ranging from his slide guitar work on &quot;Gone Troppo&quot; (1982) to his televised performance of the Cab Calloway standard &quot;Between the Devil and the Deep Blue Sea&quot; on ukulele in 1992. Lavezzoli described Harrison&#x27;s slide playing on the Grammy-winning instrumental &quot;Marwa Blues&quot; (2002) as demonstrating Hawaiian influences while comparing the melody to an Indian sarod or veena, calling it &quot;yet another demonstration of Harrison&#x27;s unique slide approach&quot;. Harrison was an admirer of George Formby and a member of the Ukulele Society of Great Britain, and played a ukulele solo in the style of Formby at the end of &quot;Free as a Bird&quot;. He performed at a Formby convention in 1991, and served as the honorary president of the George Formby Appreciation Society. Harrison played bass guitar on a few tracks, including the Beatles songs &quot;She Said She Said&quot;, &quot;Golden Slumbers&quot;, &quot;Birthday&quot; and &quot;Honey Pie&quot;. He also played bass on several solo recordings, including &quot;Faster&quot;, &quot;Wake Up My Love&quot; and &quot;Bye Bye Love&quot;.

===Sitar and Indian music===

During the Beatles&#x27; American tour in August 1965, Harrison&#x27;s friend David Crosby of the Byrds introduced him to Indian classical music and the work of sitar maestro Ravi Shankar. Harrison described Shankar as &quot;the first person who ever impressed me in my life ... and he was the only person who didn&#x27;t try to impress me.&quot; Harrison became fascinated with the sitar and immersed himself in Indian music. According to Lavezzoli, Harrison&#x27;s introduction of the instrument on the Beatles&#x27; song &quot;Norwegian Wood&quot; &quot;opened the floodgates for Indian instrumentation in rock music, triggering what Shankar would call &#x27;The Great Sitar Explosion&#x27; of 1966–67&quot;. Lavezzoli recognises Harrison as &quot;the man most responsible for this phenomenon&quot;.

In June 1966, Harrison met Shankar at the home of Mrs Angadi of the Asian Music Circle, asked to be his student, and was accepted. Before this meeting, Harrison had recorded his &quot;Revolver&quot; track &quot;Love You To&quot;, contributing a sitar part that Lavezzoli describes as an &quot;astonishing improvement&quot; over &quot;Norwegian Wood&quot; and &quot;the most accomplished performance on sitar by any rock musician&quot;. On 6 July, Harrison travelled to India to buy a sitar from Rikhi Ram &amp; Sons in New Delhi. In September, following the Beatles&#x27; final tour, he returned to India to study sitar for six weeks with Shankar. He initially stayed in Bombay until fans learned of his arrival, then moved to a houseboat on a remote lake in Kashmir. During this visit, he also received tutelage from Shambhu Das, Shankar&#x27;s protégé.

Harrison studied the instrument until 1968, when, following a discussion with Shankar about the need to find his &quot;roots&quot;, an encounter with Clapton and Jimi Hendrix at a hotel in New York convinced him to return to guitar playing. Harrison commented: &quot;I decided ... I&#x27;m not going to be a great sitar player ... because I should have started at least fifteen years earlier.&quot; Harrison continued to use Indian instrumentation occasionally on his solo albums and remained strongly associated with the genre. Lavezzoli groups him with Paul Simon and Peter Gabriel as the three rock musicians who have given the most &quot;mainstream exposure to non-Western musics, or the concept of &#x27;world music.

===Songwriting===
Harrison wrote his first song, &quot;Don&#x27;t Bother Me&quot;, while sick in a hotel bed in Bournemouth during August 1963, as &quot;an exercise to see if I &quot;could&quot; write a song&quot;, as he remembered. His songwriting ability improved throughout the Beatles&#x27; career, but his material did not earn full respect from Lennon, McCartney and producer George Martin until near the group&#x27;s break-up. In 1969, McCartney told Lennon: &quot;Until this year, our songs have been better than George&#x27;s. Now this year his songs are at least as good as ours&quot;. Harrison often had difficulty getting the band to record his songs. Most Beatles albums from 1965 onwards contain at least two Harrison compositions; three of his songs appear on &quot;Revolver&quot;, &quot;the album on which Harrison came of age as a songwriter&quot;, according to Inglis.
Harrison wrote the chord progression of &quot;Don&#x27;t Bother Me&quot; almost exclusively in the Dorian mode, demonstrating an interest in exotic tones that eventually culminated in his embrace of Indian music. The latter proved a strong influence on his songwriting and contributed to his innovation within the Beatles. According to Mikal Gilmore of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, &quot;Harrison&#x27;s openness to new sounds and textures cleared new paths for his rock and roll compositions. His use of dissonance on ... &#x27;Taxman&#x27; and &#x27;I Want to Tell You&#x27; was revolutionary in popular music – and perhaps more originally creative than the avant-garde mannerisms that Lennon and McCartney borrowed from the music of Karlheinz Stockhausen, Luciano Berio, Edgard Varèse and Igor Stravinsky ...&quot;

Of the 1967 Harrison song &quot;Within You Without You&quot;, author Gerry Farrell said that Harrison had created a &quot;new form&quot;, calling the composition &quot;a quintessential fusion of pop and Indian music&quot;. Lennon called the song one of Harrison&#x27;s best: &quot;His mind and his music are clear. There is his innate talent, he brought that sound together.&quot; In his next fully Indian-styled song, &quot;The Inner Light&quot;, Harrison embraced the Karnatak discipline of Indian music, rather than the Hindustani style he had used in &quot;Love You To&quot; and &quot;Within You Without You&quot;. Writing in 1997, Farrell commented: &quot;It is a mark of Harrison&#x27;s sincere involvement with Indian music that, nearly thirty years on, the Beatles&#x27; &#x27;Indian&#x27; songs remain the most imaginative and successful examples of this type of fusion – for example, &#x27;Blue Jay Way&#x27; and &#x27;The Inner Light&#x27;.&quot;

Beatles biographer Bob Spitz described &quot;Something&quot; as a masterpiece, and &quot;an intensely stirring romantic ballad that would challenge &#x27;Yesterday&#x27; and &#x27;Michelle&#x27; as one of the most recognizable songs they ever produced&quot;. Inglis considered &quot;Abbey Road&quot; a turning point in Harrison&#x27;s development as a songwriter and musician. He described Harrison&#x27;s two contributions to the LP, &quot;Here Comes the Sun&quot; and &quot;Something&quot;, as &quot;exquisite&quot;, declaring them equal to any previous Beatles songs.

===Collaborations===

From 1968 onwards, Harrison collaborated with other musicians; he brought in Eric Clapton to play lead guitar on &quot;While My Guitar Gently Weeps&quot; for the 1968 Beatles&#x27; White Album, and collaborated with John Barham on his 1968 debut solo album, &quot;Wonderwall Music&quot;, which included contributions from Clapton again, as well as Peter Tork from the Monkees. He played on tracks by Dave Mason, Nicky Hopkins, Alvin Lee, Ronnie Wood, Billy Preston and Tom Scott. Harrison co-wrote songs and music with Dylan, Clapton, Preston, Doris Troy, David Bromberg, Gary Wright, Wood, Jeff Lynne and Tom Petty, among others. Harrison&#x27;s music projects during the final years of the Beatles included producing Apple Records artists Doris Troy, Jackie Lomax and Billy Preston.

Harrison co-wrote the song &quot;Badge&quot; with Clapton, which was included on Cream&#x27;s 1969 album, &quot;Goodbye&quot;. Harrison played rhythm guitar on the track, using the pseudonym &quot;L&#x27;Angelo Misterioso&quot; for contractual reasons. In May 1970, he played guitar on several songs during a recording session for Dylan&#x27;s album &quot;New Morning&quot;. Between 1971 and 1973, he co-wrote or produced three top ten hits for Starr: &quot;It Don&#x27;t Come Easy&quot;, &quot;Back Off Boogaloo&quot; and &quot;Photograph&quot;. Aside from &quot;How Do You Sleep?&quot;, his contributions to Lennon&#x27;s 1971 album &quot;Imagine&quot; included a slide guitar solo on &quot;Gimme Some Truth&quot; and dobro on &quot;Crippled Inside&quot;. Also that year, he produced and played slide guitar on Badfinger&#x27;s top ten hit &quot;Day After Day&quot;, and a dobro on Preston&#x27;s &quot;I Wrote a Simple Song&quot;. He worked with Harry Nilsson on &quot;You&#x27;re Breakin&#x27; My Heart&quot; (1972) and with Cheech &amp; Chong on &quot;Basketball Jones&quot; (1973).

In 1974, Harrison founded Dark Horse Records as an avenue for collaboration with other musicians. He wanted Dark Horse to serve as a creative outlet for artists, as Apple Records had for the Beatles. Eric Idle commented: &quot;He&#x27;s extremely generous, and he backs and supports all sorts of people that you&#x27;ll never, ever hear of.&quot; The first acts signed to the new label were Ravi Shankar and the duo Splinter. Harrison produced and made multiple musical contributions to Splinter&#x27;s debut album, &quot;The Place I Love&quot;, which provided Dark Horse with its first hit, &quot;Costafine Town&quot;. He also produced and played guitar and autoharp on Shankar&#x27;s &quot;Shankar Family &amp; Friends&quot;, the label&#x27;s other inaugural release. Other artists signed by Dark Horse include Attitudes, Henry McCullough, Jiva and Stairsteps.

Harrison collaborated with Tom Scott on Scott&#x27;s 1975 album &quot;New York Connection&quot;, and in 1981 he played guitar on &quot;Walk a Thin Line&quot;, from Mick Fleetwood&#x27;s &quot;The Visitor&quot;. His contributions to Starr&#x27;s solo career continued with &quot;Wrack My Brain&quot;, a 1981 US top 40 hit written and produced by Harrison, and guitar overdubs to two tracks on &quot;Vertical Man&quot; (1998). In 1996, Harrison recorded &quot;Distance Makes No Difference With Love&quot; with Carl Perkins for the latter&#x27;s album &quot;Go Cat Go!&quot;, and, in 1990, he played slide guitar on the title track of Dylan&#x27;s &quot;Under the Red Sky&quot; album. In 2001, he performed as a guest musician on Jeff Lynne and Electric Light Orchestra&#x27;s comeback album &quot;Zoom&quot;, and on the song &quot;Love Letters&quot; for Bill Wyman&#x27;s Rhythm Kings. He also co-wrote a new song with his son Dhani, &quot;Horse to the Water&quot;, which was recorded on 2 October, eight weeks before his death. It appeared on Jools Holland&#x27;s album &quot;Small World, Big Band&quot;.

===Guitars===

When Harrison joined the Quarrymen in 1958, his main guitar was a Höfner President Acoustic, which he soon traded for a Höfner Club 40 model. His first solid-body electric guitar was a Czech-built Jolana Futurama/Grazioso. The guitars he used on early recordings were mainly Gretsch models, played through a Vox amplifier, including a Gretsch Duo Jet that he bought secondhand in 1961 and posed with on the album cover for &quot;Cloud Nine&quot; (1987). He also bought a Gretsch Tennessean and a Gretsch Country Gentleman, which he played on &quot;She Loves You&quot;, and during the Beatles&#x27; 1964 appearance on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot;. In 1963, he bought a Rickenbacker 425 Fireglo, and in 1964 he acquired a Rickenbacker 360/12 guitar, which was the second of its kind to be manufactured. Harrison obtained his first Fender Stratocaster in 1965 and first used it during the recording of the &quot;Help!&quot; album that February; he also used it when recording &quot;Rubber Soul&quot; later that year, most notably on the song &quot;Nowhere Man&quot;.

In early 1966, Harrison and Lennon each purchased Epiphone Casinos, which they used on &quot;Revolver&quot;. Harrison also used a Gibson J-160E and a Gibson SG Standard while recording the album. He later painted his Stratocaster in a psychedelic design that included the word &quot;Bebopalula&quot; above the pickguard and the guitar&#x27;s nickname, &quot;Rocky&quot;, on the headstock. He played this guitar in the &quot;Magical Mystery Tour&quot; (1967) film and throughout his solo career. In July 1968, Clapton gave him a Gibson Les Paul that had been stripped of its original finish and stained cherry red, which Harrison nicknamed &quot;Lucy&quot;. Around this time, he obtained a Gibson Jumbo J-200 acoustic guitar, which he subsequently gave to Dylan to use at the 1969 Isle of Wight Festival. In late 1968, Fender Musical Instruments Corporation gave Harrison a custom-made Fender Telecaster Rosewood prototype, made especially for him by Philip Kubicki. In August 2017, Fender released a &quot;Limited Edition George Harrison Rosewood Telecaster&quot; modelled after a Telecaster that Roger Rossmeisl originally created for Harrison.

==Film production and HandMade films==

Harrison helped finance Ravi Shankar&#x27;s documentary &quot;Raga&quot; and released it through Apple Films in 1971. He also produced, with Apple manager Allen Klein, the &quot;Concert for Bangladesh&quot; film. In 1973, he produced the feature film &quot;Little Malcolm&quot;, but the project was lost amid the litigation surrounding the former Beatles ending their business ties with Klein.

In 1973, Peter Sellers introduced Harrison to Denis O&#x27;Brien. Soon after, the two went into business together. In 1978, to produce &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Life of Brian&quot;, they formed the film production and distribution company HandMade Films. Their opportunity for investment came after EMI Films withdrew funding at the demand of their chief executive, Bernard Delfont. Harrison financed the production of &quot;Life of Brian&quot; in part by mortgaging his home, which Idle later called &quot;the most anybody&#x27;s ever paid for a cinema ticket in history&quot;. The film grossed $21 million at the box office in the US. The first film distributed by HandMade Films was &quot;The Long Good Friday&quot; (1980), and the first they produced was &quot;Time Bandits&quot; (1981), a co-scripted project by Monty Python″s Terry Gilliam and Michael Palin. The film featured a new song by Harrison, &quot;Dream Away&quot;, in the closing credits. &quot;Time Bandits&quot; became one of HandMade&#x27;s most successful and acclaimed efforts; with a budget of $5 million, it earned $35 million in the US within ten weeks of its release.

Harrison served as executive producer for 23 films with HandMade, including &quot;A Private Function&quot; (1984), &quot;Mona Lisa&quot; (1986), &quot;Shanghai Surprise&quot; (1986), &quot;Withnail and I&quot; (1987) and &quot;How to Get Ahead in Advertising&quot; (1989). He made cameo appearances in several of these films, including a role as a nightclub singer in &quot;Shanghai Surprise&quot;, for which he recorded five new songs. According to Ian Inglis, &quot;[Harrison&#x27;s] executive role in HandMade Films helped to sustain British cinema at a time of crisis, producing some of the country&#x27;s most memorable movies of the 1980s.&quot; Following a series of box office bombs in the late 1980s, and excessive debt incurred by O&#x27;Brien which was guaranteed by Harrison, HandMade&#x27;s financial situation became precarious. The company ceased operations in 1991 and was sold three years later to Paragon Entertainment, a Canadian corporation. Afterwards, Harrison sued O&#x27;Brien for $25 million for fraud and negligence, resulting in an $11.6 million judgement in 1996.

==Humanitarian work==

Harrison was involved in humanitarian and political activism throughout his life. In the 1960s, the Beatles supported the civil rights movement and protested against the Vietnam War. In early 1971, Ravi Shankar consulted Harrison about how to provide aid to the people of Bangladesh after the 1970 Bhola cyclone and the Bangladesh Liberation War. Harrison hastily wrote and recorded the song &quot;Bangla Desh&quot;, which became pop music&#x27;s first charity single when issued by Apple Records in late July. He also pushed Apple to release Shankar&#x27;s &quot;Joi Bangla&quot; EP in an effort to raise further awareness for the cause.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dooley/Gibson&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Shankar asked for Harrison&#x27;s advice about planning a small charity event in the US. Harrison responded by organising the Concert for Bangladesh, which raised more than $240,000. Around $13.5 million was generated through the album and film releases, although most of the funds were frozen in an Internal Revenue Service audit for ten years, due to Klein&#x27;s failure to register the event as a UNICEF benefit beforehand. In June 1972, UNICEF honoured Harrison and Shankar, and Klein, with the &quot;Child Is the Father of Man&quot; award at an annual ceremony in recognition of their fundraising efforts for Bangladesh.

From 1980, Harrison became a vocal supporter of Greenpeace and CND. He also protested against the use of nuclear energy with Friends of the Earth, and helped finance &quot;Vole&quot;, a green magazine launched by Monty Python member Terry Jones. In 1990, he helped promote his wife Olivia&#x27;s Romanian Angel Appeal on behalf of the thousands of Romanian orphans left abandoned by the state following the fall of Communism in Eastern Europe. Harrison recorded a benefit single, &quot;Nobody&#x27;s Child&quot;, with the Traveling Wilburys, and assembled a fundraising album with contributions from other artists including Clapton, Starr, Elton John, Stevie Wonder, Donovan and Van Morrison.

The Concert for Bangladesh has been described as an innovative precursor for the large-scale charity rock shows that followed, including Live Aid. The George Harrison Humanitarian Fund for UNICEF, a joint effort between the Harrison family and the US Fund for UNICEF, aims to support programmes that help children caught in humanitarian emergencies. In December 2007, they donated $450,000 to help the victims of Cyclone Sidr in Bangladesh. On 13 October 2009, the first George Harrison Humanitarian Award went to Ravi Shankar for his efforts in saving the lives of children, and his involvement with the Concert for Bangladesh.

==Personal life==
===Hinduism===

By the mid-1960s, Harrison had become an admirer of Indian culture and mysticism, introducing it to the other Beatles. During the filming of &quot;Help!&quot; in the Bahamas, they met the founder of Sivananda Yoga, Swami Vishnu-devananda, who gave each of them a signed copy of his book, &quot;The Complete Illustrated Book of Yoga&quot; (1960). Between the end of the last Beatles tour in 1966 and the beginning of the &quot;Sgt Pepper&quot; recording sessions, he made a pilgrimage to India with his first wife, Pattie Boyd; there, he studied sitar with Ravi Shankar, met several gurus, and visited various holy places. In 1968, he travelled with the other Beatles to Rishikesh in northern India to study meditation with Maharishi Mahesh Yogi.

Harrison&#x27;s experiences with LSD in the mid-1960s served as a catalyst for his early pursuance of Hinduism. In a 1977 interview, George recalled:

However, Harrison stopped using LSD after a disenchanting experience in San Francisco&#x27;s Haight-Ashbury neighborhood. He recounted in &quot;The Beatles Anthology&quot;:

After being given various religious texts by Shankar in 1966, he remained a lifelong advocate of the teachings of Swami Vivekananda and Paramahansa Yogananda – yogis and authors, respectively, of &quot;Raja Yoga&quot; (1896) and &quot;Autobiography of a Yogi&quot; (1946). In mid-1969, he produced the single &quot;Hare Krishna Mantra&quot;, performed by members of the London Radha Krishna Temple. Having also helped the Temple devotees become established in Britain, Harrison then met their leader, A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, whom he described as &quot;my friend ... my master&quot; and &quot;a perfect example of everything he preached&quot;. Harrison embraced the Hare Krishna tradition, particularly &quot;japa-yoga&quot; chanting with beads, and became a lifelong devotee. In 1972 he donated his Letchmore Heath mansion north of London to the devotees. It was later converted to a temple and renamed Bhaktivedanta Manor.

Regarding other faiths, he once remarked: &quot;All religions are branches of one big tree. It doesn&#x27;t matter what you call Him just as long as you call.&quot; He commented on his beliefs:

Inglis comments that, in contrast to Cliff Richard&#x27;s conversion to Christianity in 1966: &quot;Harrison&#x27;s spiritual journey was seen as a serious and important development that reflected popular music&#x27;s increasing maturity ... what he, and the Beatles, had managed to overturn was the paternalistic assumption that popular musicians had no role other than to stand on stage and sing their hit songs.&quot;

====Vegetarianism====
In line with the Hindu yoga tradition, Harrison became a vegetarian in the late 1960s. He remained a vegetarian on religious grounds from 1968 until his death, and spent the second half of his life as an advocate for the benefits of vegetarian diet.

===Family and interests===

Harrison married model Pattie Boyd on 21 January 1966, with McCartney serving as best man. Harrison and Boyd had met on set in 1964 during the production of the film &quot;A Hard Day&#x27;s Night&quot;, in which the 19-year-old Boyd had been cast as a schoolgirl. During a lunch break, George &#x27;playfully&#x27; proposed to her. They separated in 1974 and their divorce was finalised in 1977. Boyd said her decision to end the marriage was due largely to George&#x27;s repeated infidelities. The last infidelity culminated in an affair with Ringo&#x27;s wife Maureen, which Boyd called &quot;the final straw&quot;. She characterised the last year of their marriage as &quot;fuelled by alcohol and cocaine&quot;, and she stated: &quot;George used coke excessively, and I think it changed him ... it froze his emotions and hardened his heart.&quot; She subsequently moved in with Eric Clapton, and they married in 1979.

On 2 September 1978, Harrison married Olivia Trinidad Arias, who was a marketing executive for A&amp;M Records, and later Dark Horse Records. As Dark Horse was a subsidiary of A&amp;M, the couple had first met over the phone working on record company business, and then in person at the A&amp;M Records offices in Los Angeles in 1974.&lt;ref name=&quot;Olivia/DHYears&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Together they had one son, Dhani Harrison, born on 1 August 1978.

Harrison restored the English manor house and grounds of Friar Park, his home in Henley-on-Thames, where several of his music videos, including &quot;Crackerbox Palace&quot;, were filmed; the grounds also served as the background for the cover of &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot;. He employed ten workers to maintain the garden. Harrison commented on gardening as a form of escapism: &quot;Sometimes I feel like I&#x27;m actually on the wrong planet, and it&#x27;s great when I&#x27;m in my garden, but the minute I go out the gate I think: &#x27;What the hell am I doing here? His autobiography, &quot;I, Me, Mine&quot;, is dedicated &quot;to gardeners everywhere&quot;. The former Beatles publicist Derek Taylor helped Harrison write the book, which said little about the Beatles, focusing instead on Harrison&#x27;s hobbies, music and lyrics. Taylor commented: &quot;George is not disowning the Beatles ... but it was a long time ago and actually a short part of his life.&quot;

Harrison had an interest in sports cars and motor racing; he was one of the 100 people who purchased the McLaren F1 road car. He had collected photos of racing drivers and their cars since he was young; at 12, he had attended his first race, the 1955 British Grand Prix at Aintree. He wrote &quot;Faster&quot; as a tribute to the Formula One racing drivers Jackie Stewart and Ronnie Peterson. Proceeds from its release went to the Gunnar Nilsson cancer charity, set up after the Swedish driver&#x27;s death from the disease in 1978. Harrison&#x27;s first extravagant car, a 1964 Aston Martin DB5, was sold at auction on 7 December 2011 in London. An anonymous Beatles collector paid £350,000 for the vehicle that Harrison had bought new in January 1965.

===Relationships with the other Beatles===

For most of the Beatles&#x27; career, the relationships in the group were close. According to Hunter Davies, &quot;the Beatles spent their lives not living a communal life, but communally living the same life. They were each other&#x27;s greatest friends.&quot; Harrison&#x27;s ex-wife Pattie Boyd described how the Beatles &quot;all belonged to each other&quot; and admitted, &quot;George has a lot with the others that I can never know about. Nobody, not even the wives, can break through or even comprehend it.&quot; Starr said, &quot;We really looked out for each other and we had so many laughs together. In the old days we&#x27;d have the biggest hotel suites, the whole floor of the hotel, and the four of us would end up in the bathroom, just to be with each other.&quot; He added, &quot;there were some really loving, caring moments between four people: a hotel room here and there – a really amazing closeness. Just four guys who loved each other. It was pretty sensational.&quot;

Lennon stated that his relationship with Harrison was &quot;one of young follower and older guy ... [he] was like a disciple of mine when we started.&quot; The two later bonded over their LSD experiences, finding common ground as seekers of spirituality. They took radically different paths thereafter, with, according to biographer Gary Tillery, Harrison finding God and Lennon coming to the conclusion that people are the creators of their own lives. In 1974, Harrison said of his former bandmate: &quot;John Lennon is a saint and he&#x27;s heavy-duty, and he&#x27;s great and I love him. But at the same time, he&#x27;s such a &quot;bastard&quot; – but that&#x27;s the great thing about him, you see?&quot;

Harrison and McCartney were the first of the Beatles to meet, having shared a school bus, and often learned and rehearsed new guitar chords together. McCartney said that he and Harrison usually shared a bedroom while touring. McCartney has referred to Harrison as his &quot;baby brother&quot;. In a 1974 BBC radio interview with Alan Freeman, Harrison stated: &quot;[McCartney] ruined me as a guitar player&quot;. In the same interview, however, Harrison stated that &quot;I just know that whatever we&#x27;ve been through, there&#x27;s always been something that&#x27;s tied us together.&quot; Perhaps the most significant obstacle to a Beatles reunion after the death of Lennon was Harrison and McCartney&#x27;s personal relationship, as both men admitted that they often got on each other&#x27;s nerves. Rodriguez commented: &quot;Even to the end of George&#x27;s days, theirs was a volatile relationship&quot;. When, in a Yahoo online chat in February 2001, he was asked if Paul &quot;[pisses] you off&quot;, Harrison replied &quot;Scan not a friend with a microscopic glass -- You know his faults -- Then let his foibles pass. Old Victorian Proverb. I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s enough about me that pisses him off, but I think we have now grown old enough to realize that we&#x27;re both pretty damn cute!&quot;

==Legacy==
In June 1965, Harrison and the other Beatles were appointed Members of the Order of the British Empire (MBE). They received their insignia from the Queen at an investiture at Buckingham Palace on 26 October. In 1971, the Beatles received an Academy Award for the best Original Song Score for the film &quot;Let It Be&quot;. The minor planet 4149 Harrison, discovered in 1984, was named after him, as was a variety of Dahlia flower. In December 1992, he became the first recipient of the Billboard Century Award, an honour presented to music artists for significant bodies of work. The award recognised Harrison&#x27;s &quot;critical role in laying the groundwork for the modern concept of world music&quot; and for his having &quot;advanced society&#x27;s comprehension of the spiritual and altruistic power of popular music&quot;. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine ranked him number 11 in their list of the &quot;100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time&quot;. He is also in number 65 in the list of &quot;100 greatest songwriters of all time&quot; by the same magazine.

In 2002, on the first anniversary of his death, the Concert for George was held at the Royal Albert Hall. Eric Clapton organised the event, which included performances by many of Harrison&#x27;s friends and musical collaborators, including McCartney and Starr. Eric Idle, who described Harrison as &quot;one of the few morally good people that rock and roll has produced&quot;, was among the performers of Monty Python&#x27;s &quot;Lumberjack Song&quot;. The profits from the concert went to Harrison&#x27;s charity, the Material World Charitable Foundation.

In 2004, Harrison was posthumously inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a solo artist by his former bandmates Lynne and Petty, and into the Madison Square Garden Walk of Fame in 2006 for the Concert for Bangladesh. On 14 April 2009, the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce awarded Harrison a star on the Walk of Fame in front of the Capitol Records Building. McCartney, Lynne and Petty were present when the star was unveiled. Harrison&#x27;s widow Olivia, the actor Tom Hanks and Idle made speeches at the ceremony, and Harrison&#x27;s son Dhani spoke the Hare Krishna mantra.

A documentary film titled &quot;George Harrison: Living in the Material World&quot;, directed by Martin Scorsese, was released in October 2011. The film features interviews with Olivia and Dhani Harrison, Klaus Voormann, Terry Gilliam, Starr, Clapton, McCartney, Keltner and Astrid Kirchherr.

Harrison was posthumously honoured with The Recording Academy&#x27;s Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award at the Grammy Awards in February 2015.

An Illinois State Historical Society marker in Benton, Illinois, commemorates Harrison&#x27;s visit in the town in 1963 to see his sister, making him the first Beatle to visit the United States. In 2017, a mural installation was unveiled in the town of Harrison painted by artist John Cerney. Statues of Harrison can be found around the world, including several across his native Liverpool and a bust in the Shadhinotar Shagram Triangle Sculpture Garden in Dhaka, Bangladesh, commemorating Harrison&#x27;s contributions to Bangladeshi culture.

On 24 May 2024 a Historic England blue plaque was unveiled at Harrison&#x27;s childhood home at 12 Arnold Grove in Wavertree by his wife Olivia.

<text>A giant planet, sometimes referred to as a jovian planet (&quot;Jove&quot; being another name for the Roman god Jupiter), is a diverse type of planet much larger than Earth. Giant planets are usually primarily composed of low-boiling point materials (volatiles), rather than rock or other solid matter, but massive solid planets can also exist. There are four such planets in the Solar System: Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. Many extrasolar giant planets have been identified.

Giant planets are sometimes known as gas giants, but many astronomers now apply the term only to Jupiter and Saturn, classifying Uranus and Neptune, which have different compositions, as ice giants. Both names are potentially misleading; the Solar System&#x27;s giant planets all consist primarily of fluids above their critical points, where distinct gas and liquid phases do not exist. Jupiter and Saturn are principally made of hydrogen and helium, whilst Uranus and Neptune consist of water, ammonia, and methane.

The defining differences between a very low-mass brown dwarf and a massive gas giant () are debated. One school of thought is based on planetary formation; the other, on the physics of the interior of planets. Part of the debate concerns whether brown dwarfs must, by definition, have experienced nuclear fusion at some point in their history.

== Terminology ==
The term &quot;gas giant&quot; was coined in 1952 by science fiction writer James Blish and was originally used to refer to all giant planets. Arguably it is something of a misnomer, because throughout most of the volume of these planets the pressure is so high that matter is not in gaseous form. Other than the upper layers of the atmosphere, all matter is likely beyond the critical point, where there is no distinction between liquids and gases. &quot;Fluid planet&quot; would be a more accurate term. Jupiter also has metallic hydrogen near its center, but much of its volume is hydrogen, helium, and traces of other gases above their critical points. The observable atmospheres of all these planets (at less than a unit optical depth) are quite thin compared to their radii, only extending perhaps one percent of the way to the center. Thus, the observable parts are gaseous (in contrast to Mars and Earth, which have gaseous atmospheres through which the crust can be seen).

The rather misleading term has caught on because planetary scientists typically use &quot;rock&quot;, &quot;gas&quot;, and &quot;ice&quot; as shorthands for classes of elements and compounds commonly found as planetary constituents, irrespective of the matter&#x27;s phase. In the outer Solar System, hydrogen and helium are referred to as &quot;gas&quot;; water, methane, and ammonia as &quot;ice&quot;; and silicates and metals as &quot;rock&quot;. When deep planetary interiors are considered, it may not be far off to say that, by &quot;ice&quot; astronomers mean oxygen and carbon, by &quot;rock&quot; they mean silicon, and by &quot;gas&quot; they mean hydrogen and helium. The many ways in which Uranus and Neptune differ from Jupiter and Saturn have led some to use the term only for planets similar to the latter two. With this terminology in mind, some astronomers have started referring to Uranus and Neptune as ice giants to indicate the predominance of the &quot;ices&quot; (in fluid form) in their interior composition.

The alternative term &quot;jovian planet&quot; refers to the Roman god Jupiter—the genitive form of which is &quot;Jovis&quot;, hence &quot;Jovian&quot;—and was intended to indicate that all of these planets were similar to Jupiter.

Objects large enough to start deuterium fusion (above 13 Jupiter masses for solar composition) are called brown dwarfs, and these occupy the mass range between that of large giant planets and the lowest-mass stars. The 13-Jupiter-mass () cutoff is a rule of thumb rather than something of precise physical significance. Larger objects will burn most of their deuterium and smaller ones will burn only a little, and the value is somewhere in between. The amount of deuterium burnt depends not only on the mass but also on the composition of the planet, especially on the amount of helium and deuterium present. The Extrasolar Planets Encyclopaedia includes objects up to 60 Jupiter masses, and the Exoplanet Data Explorer up to 24 Jupiter masses.

==Description==

A giant planet is a massive planet and has a thick atmosphere of hydrogen and helium. They may have a condensed &quot;core&quot; of heavier elements, delivered during the formation process. This core may be partially or completely dissolved and dispersed throughout the hydrogen/helium envelope. In &quot;traditional&quot; giant planets such as Jupiter and Saturn (the gas giants) hydrogen and helium make up most of the mass of the planet, whereas they only make up an outer envelope on Uranus and Neptune, which are instead mostly composed of water, ammonia, and methane and therefore increasingly referred to as &quot;ice giants&quot;.

Extrasolar giant planets that orbit very close to their stars are the exoplanets that are easiest to detect. These are called hot Jupiters and hot Neptunes because they have very high surface temperatures. Hot Jupiters were, until the advent of space-borne telescopes, the most common form of exoplanet known, due to the relative ease of detecting them with ground-based instruments.

Giant planets are commonly said to lack solid surfaces, but it is more accurate to say that they lack surfaces altogether since the gases that form them simply become thinner and thinner with increasing distance from the planets&#x27; centers, eventually becoming indistinguishable from the interplanetary medium. Therefore, landing on a giant planet may or may not be possible, depending on the size and composition of its core.

==Subtypes==

===Gas giants===
Gas giants consist mostly of hydrogen and helium. The Solar System&#x27;s gas giants, Jupiter and Saturn, have heavier elements making up between 3 and 13 percent of their mass. Gas giants are thought to consist of an outer layer of molecular hydrogen, surrounding a layer of liquid metallic hydrogen, with a probable molten core with a rocky composition.

Jupiter and Saturn&#x27;s outermost portion of the hydrogen atmosphere has many layers of visible clouds that are mostly composed of water and ammonia. The layer of metallic hydrogen makes up the bulk of each planet, and is referred to as &quot;metallic&quot; because the very high pressure turns hydrogen into an electrical conductor. The core is thought to consist of heavier elements at such high temperatures (20,000 K) and pressures that their properties are poorly understood.

===Ice giants===
Ice giants have distinctly different interior compositions from gas giants. The Solar System&#x27;s ice giants, Uranus and Neptune, have a hydrogen-rich atmosphere that extends from the cloud tops down to about 80% (Uranus) or 85% (Neptune) of their radius. Below this, they are predominantly &quot;icy&quot;, i.e. consisting mostly of water, methane, and ammonia. There is also some rock and gas, but various proportions of ice–rock–gas could mimic pure ice, so that the exact proportions are unknown.

Uranus and Neptune have very hazy atmospheric layers with small amounts of methane, giving them light aquamarine colors. Both have magnetic fields that are sharply inclined to their axes of rotation.

Unlike the other giant planets, Uranus has an extreme tilt that causes its seasons to be severely pronounced. The two planets also have other subtle but important differences. Uranus has more hydrogen and helium than Neptune despite being less massive overall. Neptune is therefore denser and has much more internal heat and a more active atmosphere. The Nice model, in fact, suggests that Neptune formed closer to the Sun than Uranus did, and should therefore have more heavy elements.

===Massive solid planets===

Massive solid planets seemingly can also exist, though their formation mechanisms and occurrence remain subjects of ongoing research and debate.

The possibility of solid planets up to thousands of Earth masses forming around massive stars (B-type and O-type stars; 5–120 solar masses) has been suggested in some earlier studies. The hypothesis proposed that the protoplanetary disk around such stars would contain enough heavy elements, and that high UV radiation and strong winds could photoevaporate the gas in the disk, leaving just the heavy elements. For comparison, Neptune&#x27;s mass equals 17 Earth masses, Jupiter has 318 Earth masses, and the 13 Jupiter-mass limit used in the IAU&#x27;s working definition of an exoplanet equals approximately 4000 Earth masses.

However, it is important to note that more recent research has called into question the likelihood of massive solid planet formation around very massive stars(https://arxiv.org/pdf/1103.0556). Studies have shown that the ratio of protoplanetary disk mass to stellar mass decreases rapidly for stars above 10 solar masses, falling to less than 10^-4. Furthermore, no protoplanetary disks have been observed around O-type stars to date.

The original suggestion of massive solid planets forming around 5-120 solar mass stars, presented in earlier literature, lacks substantial supporting evidence or citations to planetary formation theories. The study in question primarily focused on simulating mass-radius relationships for rocky planets, including hypothetical super-massive solid planets, but did not investigate whether planetary formation theories actually support the existence of such objects. The authors of that study acknowledged that &quot;Such massive exoplanets are not yet known to exist.&quot;

Given these considerations, the formation and existence of massive solid planets around very massive stars remain speculative and require further research and observational evidence.

===Super-Puffs===
A super-puff is a type of exoplanet with a mass only a few times larger than
Earth’s but a radius larger than Neptune, giving it a very low mean density. They are cooler and less massive than the inflated low-density hot-Jupiters. The most extreme examples known are the three planets around Kepler-51 which are all Jupiter-sized but with densities below 0.1 g/cm3.

== Extrasolar giant planets ==
Because of the limited techniques currently available to detect exoplanets, many of those found to date have been of a size associated, in the Solar System, with giant planets. Because these large planets are inferred to share more in common with Jupiter than with the other giant planets, some have claimed that &quot;jovian planet&quot; is a more accurate term for them. Many of the exoplanets are much closer to their parent stars and hence much hotter than the giant planets in the Solar System, making it possible that some of those planets are a type not observed in the Solar System. Considering the relative abundances of the elements in the universe (approximately 98% hydrogen and helium) it would be surprising to find a predominantly rocky planet more massive than Jupiter. On the other hand, models of planetary-system formation have suggested that giant planets would be inhibited from forming as close to their stars as many of the extrasolar giant planets have been observed to orbit.

==Atmospheres==
The bands seen in the atmosphere of Jupiter are due to counter-circulating streams of material called zones and belts, encircling the planet parallel to its equator. The zones are the lighter bands, and are at higher altitudes in the atmosphere. They have an internal updraft and are high-pressure regions. The belts are the darker bands, are lower in the atmosphere, and have an internal downdraft. They are low-pressure regions. These structures are somewhat analogous to the high and low-pressure cells in Earth&#x27;s atmosphere, but they have a very different structure—latitudinal bands that circle the entire planet, as opposed to small confined cells of pressure. This appears to be a result of the rapid rotation and underlying symmetry of the planet. There are no oceans or landmasses to cause local heating and the rotation speed is much higher than that of Earth.

There are smaller structures as well: spots of different sizes and colors. On Jupiter, the most noticeable of these features is the Great Red Spot, which has been present for at least 300 years. These structures are huge storms. Some such spots are thunderheads as well.

<text>A goddess is a female deity. In many known cultures, goddesses are often linked with literal or metaphorical pregnancy or imagined feminine roles associated with how women and girls are perceived or expected to behave. This includes themes of spinning, weaving, beauty, love, sexuality, motherhood, , creativity, and fertility (exemplified by the ancient mother goddess cult). Many major goddesses are also associated with magic, war, strategy, hunting, farming, wisdom, fate, earth, sky, power, laws, justice, and more. Some themes, such as or disease, which are considered negative within their cultural contexts also are found associated with some goddesses. There are as many differently described and understood goddesses as there are male, shapeshifting, or neuter gods.

In some faiths, a sacred female figure holds a central place in religious prayer and worship. For example, Shaktism (one of the three major Hindu sects), holds that the ultimate deity, the source of all reality, is Mahadevi (Supreme Goddess) and in some forms of Tantric Shaivism, the pair of Shiva and Shakti are the ultimate principle (with the goddess representing the active, creative power of God). Meanwhile, in Vajrayana Buddhism, ultimate reality is often seen as being composed of two principles depicted as two deities in union (yab yum, &quot;father-mother&quot;) symbolising the non-duality of the two principles of perfect wisdom (female) and skillful compassion (male).

Polytheist religions, including Polytheistic reconstructionists, honour multiple goddesses and gods, and usually view them as discrete, separate beings. These deities may be part of a pantheon, or different regions may have tutelary deities.

==Etymology==
The noun &quot;goddess&quot; is a secondary formation, combining the Germanic &quot;god&quot; with the Latinate &quot;-ess&quot; suffix. It first appeared in Middle English, from about 1350. The English word follows the linguistic precedent of a number of languages—including Egyptian, Classical Greek, and several Semitic languages—that add a feminine ending to the language&#x27;s word for &quot;god&quot;.

==Historical polytheism==
===Ancient Near East===
====Mesopotamia====
Inanna was the most worshipped goddess in ancient Sumer. She was later syncretised with the East Semitic goddess Ishtar. Other Mesopotamian goddesses include Ninhursag, Ninlil, Antu and Gaga.

==== Ancient Africa (Egypt) ====

* Goddesses of the Ennead of Heliopolis: Tefnut, Nut, Nephthys, Isis
* Goddesses of the Ogdoad of Hermopolis: Naunet, Amaunet, Kauket, Hauhet; originally a cult of Hathor
* Satis and Anuket of the triad of Elephantine

====Canaan====

Goddesses of the Canaanite religion: Ba`alat Gebal, Astarte, Anat.

====Anatolia====
* Cybele: Her Hittite name was Kubaba, but her name changed to Cybele in Phrygian and Roman culture. Her effect can be also seen on Artemis as the Lady of Ephesus.
* Hebat: Mother Goddess of the Hittite pantheon and wife of the leader sky god, Teshub. She was the origin of the Hurrian cult.
* Arinniti: Hittite Goddess of the sun. She became patron of the Hittite Empire and monarchy.
* Leto: A mother Goddess figure in Lykia. She was also the main goddess of the capital city of Lykia League (Letoon)

====Pre-Islamic Arabia====
In pre-Islamic Mecca the goddesses Uzza, Manāt and al-Lāt were known as &quot;the daughters of god&quot;. Uzzā was worshipped by the Nabataeans, who equated her with the Graeco-Roman goddesses Aphrodite, Urania, Venus and Caelestis. Each of the three goddesses had a separate shrine near Mecca. Uzzā, was called upon for protection by the pre-Islamic Quraysh. In 624 AD, during the Battle of Uhud, the war cry of the Qurayshites was, &quot;O people of Uzzā, people of Hubal!&quot; (Tawil 1993).

According to Ibn Ishaq&#x27;s controversial account of the Satanic Verses (&quot;q.v.&quot;), these verses had previously endorsed them as intercessors for Muslims, but were abrogated. Most Muslim scholars have regarded the story as historically implausible, while opinion is divided among western scholars such as Leone Caetani and John Burton, who argue against, and William Muir and William Montgomery Watt, who argue for its plausibility.

The Quran (Q53:19-31) warns of the vanity of trusting to the intercession of female deities, in particular &quot;the daughters of god&quot;.

===Indo-European traditions===

Pre-Christian and pre-Islamic goddesses in cultures that spoke Indo-European languages.

====Celtic====

Goddesses and Otherworldly Women in Celtic polytheism include:
* Celtic antiquity: Brigantia
* Gallo-Roman goddesses: Epona, Dea Matrona
* Irish mythology: Áine, Boann, Brigid, The Cailleach, Danu, Ériu, Fand and The Morrígan (Nemain, Macha, and Badb) among others.
The Celts honoured goddesses of nature and natural forces, as well as those connected with skills and professions such as healing, warfare and poetry. The Celtic goddesses have diverse qualities such as abundance, creation and beauty, as well as harshness, slaughter and vengeance. They have been depicted as beautiful or hideous, old hags or young women, and at times may transform their appearance from one state to another, or into their associated creatures such as crows, cows, wolves or eels, to name but a few. In Irish mythology in particular, tutelary goddesses are often associated with sovereignty and various features of the land, notably mountains, rivers, forests and holy wells.

====Germanic====

Surviving accounts of Germanic mythology and Norse mythology contain numerous tales of female goddesses, giantesses, and divine female figures in their scriptures. The Germanic peoples had altars erected to the &quot;Mothers and Matrons&quot; and held celebrations specific to these goddesses (such as the Anglo-Saxon &quot;Mothers-night&quot;). Various other female deities are attested among the Germanic peoples, such as Nerthus attested in an early account of the Germanic peoples, Ēostre attested among the pagan Anglo-Saxons, and Sinthgunt attested among the pagan continental Germanic peoples. Examples of goddesses attested in Norse mythology include Frigg (wife of Odin, and the Anglo-Saxon version of whom is namesake of the modern English weekday Friday), Skaði (one time wife of Njörðr), Njerda (Scandinavian name of Nerthus), that also was married to Njörðr during Bronze Age, Freyja (wife of Óðr), Sif (wife of Thor), Gerðr (wife of Freyr), and personifications such as Jörð (earth), Sól (the sun), and Nótt (night). Female deities also play heavily into the Norse concept of death, where half of those slain in battle enter Freyja&#x27;s field Fólkvangr, Hel&#x27;s realm of the same name, and Rán who receives those who die at sea. Other female deities such as the valkyries, the norns, and the dísir are associated with a Germanic concept of fate (Old Norse &quot;Ørlög&quot;, Old English &quot;Wyrd&quot;), and celebrations were held in their honour, such as the Dísablót and Disting.

==Folk religion and animism==
===African religions===
In African and African diasporic religions, goddesses are often syncretised with Marian devotion, as in Ezili Dantor (Black Madonna of Częstochowa) and Erzulie Freda (Mater Dolorosa). There is also Buk, a Sudanese and Ethiopian goddess still worshipped in the southern regions. She represents the fertile aspect of women. She is related to the deity of a similar name, Abuk. Another Ethiopian goddess is Atete, the goddess of spring and fertility. Farmers traditionally leave some of their products at the end of each harvesting season as an offering while women sing traditional songs.

A rare example of henotheism focused on a single Goddess is found among the Southern Nuba of Sudan. The Nuba conceive of the creator Goddess as the &quot;Great Mother&quot; who gave birth to earth and to mankind.

===Chinese folk religion===
* Mazu is the goddess of the sea who protects fishermen and sailors, widely worshipped in the south-eastern coastal areas of China and neighbouring areas in Southeast Asia.
* The Goddess Weaver Zhinü, daughter of the Celestial Mother, wove the stars and their light, known as &quot;the Silver River&quot; (what Westerners call &quot;The Milky Way Galaxy&quot;), for heaven and earth. She was identified with the star Westerners know as Vega.

===Shinto===

Goddess Amaterasu is the chief among the Shinto gods (&quot;kami&quot;), while there are important female deities Ame-no-Uzume-no-Mikoto, Inari and Konohanasakuya-hime.

== Indian religions==
In the Indian religions (mainly Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism), there are many goddesses that are widely venerated. The earliest source for several of these goddesses is the Vedas. However, goddesses can also be found in the art of the even more ancient Indus Valley civilisation.

===Hinduism===

Hinduism is a diverse complex of many belief systems which includes numerous gods and goddesses. The earliest Hindu source, the &quot;Rigveda&quot;, contains many goddesses such as Prithvi (earth), Aditi (cosmic moral order), Vāc (sound), Nirṛti (destruction) and Saraswati. The &quot;Devīsūktam&quot; is an important source for the goddess idea in Vedic religion. Important Hindu goddesses today include Lakshmi, Saraswati, Durga, Kali, Tripurasundari, Parvati, and Radha.

There is much diversity in the theology of the various traditions of Hinduism. Some theologies (e.g. Advaita) see all gods and goddesses as emanations of a single formless impersonal source called Brahman. Other theologies are more personal regarding the ultimate deity.

Some traditions posit a dual deity in the form of Lakshmi-Vishnu, Radha-Krishna, Brahma-Saraswati, or Shiva-Parvati. These are presented as a pair with a male god (Shaktiman, &quot;possessor of power&quot;) and his consort, a female &quot;power&quot; (Shakti), and their relationship is interpreted in different ways depending on the tradition&#x27;s theology.

In Shaktism, the supreme deity is the Great Goddess (Mahadevi), called by different names such as Shakti or Adi Parashakti (Primordial Supreme Power). Shaktas consider the Goddess to be the ultimate source of all things and the mother of all gods and goddesses. She is considered to have ten main avatars called the ten mahavidyas in some traditions. Another important concept is the Shakta trinity, the tridevi, which sees Mahadevi as manifesting in three main goddesses: Mahasaraswati, Mahalakshmi, and Mahakali.In the great Shakta scripture known as the &quot;Devi Mahatmya&quot; (Glory of the Goddess), all the goddesses are aspects of one presiding female force—one in truth and many in expression, which also is the creative power of the cosmos. It expresses through philosophical tracts and metaphor, that the potentiality of masculine being is actuated by the feminine divine.

Local deities of different village regions in India were often identified with &quot;mainstream&quot; Hindu deities, a process that has been called &quot;Sanskritisation&quot;. Others attribute it to the influence of monism or &quot;Advaita&quot;, which discounts polytheist or monotheist categorisation. While the monist forces have led to a fusion between some of the goddesses (108 names are common for many goddesses), centrifugal forces have also resulted in new goddesses and rituals gaining ascendance among the laity in different parts of Hindu world. Thus, the immensely popular goddess Durga was a pre-Vedic goddess who was later fused with Parvati, a process that can be traced through texts such as Kalika Purana (10th century), Durgabhaktitarangini (Vidyapati 15th century), Chandimangal (16th century) etc.

Widely celebrated Hindu festival Navaratri is in the honour of the divine feminine Devi (Durga) and spans nine nights of prayer in the autumn, also referred as Sharada Navratri.

=== Buddhism ===


There are numerous female deities in the various Buddhist traditions. Buddhist goddesses are widely depicted in Buddhist art. Early Buddhism in India venerated various female goddesses. These were mostly considered to be devas or spirits (such as yakshinis). They include Prthivi (earth goddess), Hariti, Lakshmi and Mayadevi (the mother of the Buddha). Some of these figures remain important in Theravada Buddhism today, including Maya and Prthivi (known as Phra Mae Thorani in Southeast Asia).

Indian Mahayana Buddhism revered several female deities, including Prajñāpāramitā Devi, Cunda, Marici, Sitātapatra, Tārā, Uṣṇīṣavijayā and Vasudhārā. In the Mahayana, female deities grew in importance, becoming powerful bodhisattva savior figures, liberators associated with powerful mantras (which are also termed &quot;vidyās&quot; when a mantra is seen as a feminine power) and dharanis. In some cases, such as with Prajñāpāramitā Devi, these goddesses were even called &quot;mother of Buddhas&quot; (Sanskrit: buddhamatr) and bhagavati, indicating they were seen as fully awakened Buddhas themselves.

In the Mahayana traditions, some are considered to be bodhisattvas (beings advancing on the path to Buddhahood) or full Buddhas, while others are just devas (worldly deities). The most important Buddhist female deities in East Asian Buddhism are the bodhisattva Guanyin and the &quot;mother of Buddhas&quot; Cundi. In Tibetan Buddhism, Tara is the most important female deity (often considered to be a full Buddha).

The tantric &quot;dakini&quot; Vajrayogini is an important tantric meditation deity (yidam) in Tibetan Vajrayana, and is also considered to be a female Buddha in her own right. Tantric Buddhist goddesses were often considered to be fully awakened Buddhas and sometimes are depicted with unique tantric elements, such as skullcups and flaying knives. These tantric deities include Simhamukha, Mahamaya, Vajrayogini, Chinnamunda and Kurukulla.

Mahayana goddesses are often termed &quot;devis&quot; (Sanskrit: devi, &quot;female deity&quot;, &quot;goddess&quot;, Tibetan: lhamo) or even bhagavani (the female version of bhagavan, indicating Buddhahood).

==Abrahamic religions==

===Judaism===

According to Zohar, Lilith is the name of Adam&#x27;s first wife, who was created at the same time as Adam. She left Adam and refused to return to the Garden of Eden after she mated with archangel Samael. Her story was greatly developed during the Middle Ages in the tradition of Aggadic midrashim, the Zohar and Jewish mysticism.

The Zohar tradition has influenced Jewish folklore, which postulates God created Adam to marry a woman named Lilith. Outside of Jewish tradition, Lilith was associated with the Mother Goddess, Inanna – later known as both Ishtar and Asherah. In The Epic of Gilgamesh, Gilgamesh was said to have destroyed a tree that was in a sacred grove dedicated to the goddess Ishtar/Inanna/Asherah. Lilith ran into the wilderness in despair. She then is depicted in the Talmud and Kabbalah as first wife to God&#x27;s first creation of man, Adam. In time, as stated in the Old Testament, the Hebrew followers continued to worship &quot;False Idols&quot;, like Asherah, as being as powerful as God. Jeremiah speaks of his (and God&#x27;s) displeasure at this behaviour to the Hebrew people about the worship of the goddess in the Old Testament. Lilith is banished from Adam and God&#x27;s presence when she is discovered to be a &quot;demon&quot; and Eve becomes Adam&#x27;s wife.

The following female deities are mentioned in prominent Hebrew texts:
* Agrat bat Mahlat
* Anath
* Asherah
* Ashima
* Astarte
* Eisheth
More commonly, modern Judaism acknowledges &quot;Shekhinah&quot; as the feminine aspect of God. &quot;Shekhinah&quot; is considered to be the presence of God on Earth and/or the spirit of the Jewish people, forever trying to reunite with the other elements of God through &quot;tikkun olam&quot;. She is also associated with the moon, the earth, David, and Rachel.

===Christianity===
The veneration of Mary, the mother of Jesus, as an especially privileged saint has continued since the beginning of the Catholic faith. Mary is venerated as the Mother of God, Queen of Heaven, Mother of the Church, the Blessed Virgin Mary, Star of the Sea, and other lofty titles.

Marian devotion similar to this kind is also found in Eastern Orthodoxy and sometimes in Anglicanism, although not in the majority of denominations of Protestantism.
In some Christian traditions (like the Orthodox tradition), Sophia is the personification of either divine wisdom (or of an archangel) that takes female form. She is mentioned in the first chapter of the Book of Proverbs. Sophia is identified by some as the wisdom imparting Holy Spirit of the Christian Trinity, whose names in Hebrew—Ruach and Shekhinah—are both feminine, and whose symbol of the dove was commonly associated in the Ancient Near East with the figure of the Mother Goddess.

In mysticism, Gnosticism, as well as some Hellenistic religions, there is a female spirit or goddess named Sophia who is said to embody wisdom and who is sometimes described as a virgin. In Roman Catholic mysticism, Saint Hildegard celebrated Sophia as a cosmic figure both in her writing and art. Within the Protestant tradition in England, the 17th-century mystic universalist and founder of the Philadelphian Society Jane Leade wrote copious descriptions of her visions and dialogues with the &quot;Virgin Sophia&quot; who, she said, revealed to her the spiritual workings of the universe. Leade was hugely influenced by the theosophical writings of 16th-century German Christian mystic Jakob Böhme, who also speaks of Sophia in works such as &quot;The Way to Christ&quot;. Jakob Böhme was very influential to a number of Christian mystics and religious leaders, including George Rapp and the Harmony Society.

==== Latter Day Saint movement ====
The members of most denominations in the Latter Day Saint movement believe in, although they do not directly worship, a Heavenly Mother who is the female counterpart of the Heavenly Father. Together they are referred to as Heavenly Parents. Adherents also believe that all humans, both women and men, have the potential to become gods through a process known as exaltation.

==Neopaganism==

Most Modern Pagan traditions honour one or more goddesses. While some who follow Wicca believe in a duotheistic belief system, consisting of a single goddess and a single god, who in hieros gamos represent a united whole, others recognise only one or more goddesses.

===Wicca===

In Wicca &quot;the Goddess&quot; is the deity of prime importance, along with her consort the Horned God.
Within many forms of Wicca the Goddess has come to be considered as a universal deity, more in line with her description in the Charge of the Goddess, a key Wiccan text. In this guise she is the &quot;Queen of Heaven&quot;, similar to Isis. She also encompasses and conceives (creates) all life, much like Gaia. Similarly to Isis and certain late Classical conceptions of Selene, she is the summation of all other goddesses, who represent her different names and aspects across the different cultures. The Goddess is often portrayed with strong lunar symbolism, drawing on various cultures and deities such as Diana, Hecate, and Isis, and is often depicted as the Maiden, Mother, and Crone triad popularised by Robert Graves (see Triple Goddess below). Many depictions of her also draw strongly on Celtic goddesses. Some Wiccans, or Witches, believe there are many goddesses, and in some forms of Wicca, notably Dianic Wicca, the Goddess alone is worshipped, and the God plays very little (or no) part in their worship and ritual. The first history of Wiccans or Witches (nature based religion) appear on cave paintings that show early humans worshipping a feminine nature deity for luck and harvest (BCE). Later Celtics form a more formal form of Witches (Wiccans) with the triquetra (maiden mother crone),pentagram etc. They have evolved into the strong, nature based, animal rights loving and women rights religion of today.

Goddesses or demi-goddesses appear in sets of three in a number of ancient European pagan mythologies; these include the Greek &quot;Erinyes&quot; (Furies) and &quot;Moirai&quot; (Fates); the Norse &quot;Norns&quot;; Brighid and her two sisters, also called Brighid, from Irish or Celtic mythology.

Robert Graves popularised the triad of &quot;Maiden&quot; (or &quot;Virgin&quot;), &quot;Mother&quot; and &quot;Crone&quot;, and while this idea did not rest on sound scholarship, his poetic inspiration has gained a tenacious hold. Considerable variation in the precise conceptions of these figures exists, as typically occurs in Neopaganism and indeed in pagan religions in general. Some choose to interpret them as three stages in a woman&#x27;s life, separated by menarche and menopause. Others find this too biologically based and rigid, and prefer a freer interpretation, with the Maiden as birth (independent, self-centred, seeking), the Mother as giving birth (interrelated, compassionate nurturing, creating), and the Crone as death and renewal (holistic, remote, unknowable) — and all three erotic and wise.

== Feminism ==

===Goddess movement===

At least since first-wave feminism in the United States, there has been interest in analysing religion to see if and how doctrines and practices treat women unfairly, as in Elizabeth Cady Stanton&#x27;s &quot;The Woman&#x27;s Bible&quot;. Again in second-wave feminism in the U.S., as well as in many European and other countries, religion became the focus of some feminist analysis in Judaism, Christianity, and other religions, and some women turned to ancient goddess religions as an alternative to Abrahamic religions (&quot;Womanspirit Rising&quot; 1979; &quot;Weaving the Visions&quot; 1989). Today both women and men continue to be involved in the Goddess movement (Christ 1997). The popularity of organisations such as the Fellowship of Isis attest to the continuing growth of the religion of the Goddess throughout the world.

While much of the attempt at gender equity in mainstream Christianity (Judaism never recognised any gender for God) is aimed at reinterpreting scripture and degenderising language used to name and describe the divine (Ruether, 1984; Plaskow, 1991), there are a growing number of people who identify as Christians or Jews who are trying to integrate goddess imagery into their religions (Kien, 2000; Kidd 1996,&quot;Goddess Christians Yahoo Group&quot;).

===Sacred feminine===
The term &quot;sacred feminine&quot; was first coined in the 1970s, in New Age popularisations of the Hindu Shakti. Hinduism also worships multitude of goddesses that have their important role and thus in all came to interest for the New Age, feminist, and lesbian feminist movements.

==Metaphorical use==
The term &quot;goddess&quot; has also been adapted to poetic and secular use as a complimentary description of a non-mythological woman. The OED notes 1579 as the date of the earliest attestation of such figurative use, in &quot;Lauretta the diuine Petrarches Goddesse&quot;.

Shakespeare had several of his male characters address female characters as goddesses, including Demetrius to Helena in &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot; (&quot;O Helen, goddess, nymph, perfect, divine!&quot;), Berowne to Rosaline in &quot;Love&#x27;s Labour&#x27;s Lost&quot; (&quot;A woman I forswore; but I will prove, Thou being a goddess, I forswore not thee&quot;), and Bertram to Diana in &quot;All&#x27;s Well That Ends Well&quot;. Pisanio also compares Imogen to a goddess to describe her composure under duress in &quot;Cymbeline&quot;.

<text>Gunpowder, also commonly known as black powder to distinguish it from modern smokeless powder, is the earliest known chemical explosive. It consists of a mixture of sulfur, charcoal (which is mostly carbon), and potassium nitrate (saltpeter). The sulfur and charcoal act as fuels while the saltpeter is an oxidizer. Gunpowder has been widely used as a propellant in firearms, artillery, rocketry, and pyrotechnics, including use as a blasting agent for explosives in quarrying, mining, building pipelines, tunnels, and roads.

Gunpowder is classified as a low explosive because of its relatively slow decomposition rate, low ignition temperature and consequently low brisance (breaking/shattering). Low explosives deflagrate (i.e., burn at subsonic speeds), whereas high explosives detonate, producing a supersonic shockwave. Ignition of gunpowder packed behind a projectile generates enough pressure to force the shot from the muzzle at high speed, but usually not enough force to rupture the gun barrel. It thus makes a good propellant but is less suitable for shattering rock or fortifications with its low-yield explosive power. Nonetheless, it was widely used to fill fused artillery shells (and used in mining and civil engineering projects) until the second half of the 19th century, when the first high explosives were put into use.

Gunpowder is one of the Four Great Inventions of China. Originally developed by Taoists for medicinal purposes, it was first used for warfare around AD 904. Its use in weapons has declined due to smokeless powder replacing it, whilst its relative inefficiency led to newer alternatives such as dynamite and ammonium nitrate/fuel oil replacing it in industrial applications.

== Effect ==
Gunpowder is a low explosive: it does not detonate, but rather deflagrates (burns quickly). This is an advantage in a propellant device, where one does not desire a shock that would shatter the gun and potentially harm the operator; however, it is a drawback when an explosion is desired. In that case, the propellant (and most importantly, gases produced by its burning) must be confined. Since it contains its own oxidizer and additionally burns faster under pressure, its combustion is capable of bursting containers such as a shell, grenade, or improvised &quot;pipe bomb&quot; or &quot;pressure cooker&quot; casings to form shrapnel.

In quarrying, high explosives are generally preferred for shattering rock. However, because of its low brisance, gunpowder causes fewer fractures and results in more usable stone compared to other explosives, making it useful for blasting slate, which is fragile, or monumental stone such as granite and marble. Gunpowder is well suited for blank rounds, signal flares, burst charges, and rescue-line launches. It is also used in fireworks for lifting shells, in rockets as fuel, and in certain special effects.

Combustion converts less than half the mass of gunpowder to gas; most of it turns into particulate matter. Some of it is ejected, wasting propelling power, fouling the air, and generally being a nuisance (giving away a soldier&#x27;s position, generating fog that hinders vision, etc.). Some of it ends up as a thick layer of soot inside the barrel, where it also is a nuisance for subsequent shots, and a cause of jamming an automatic weapon. Moreover, this residue is hygroscopic, and with the addition of moisture absorbed from the air forms a corrosive substance. The soot contains potassium oxide or sodium oxide that turns into potassium hydroxide, or sodium hydroxide, which corrodes wrought iron or steel gun barrels. Gunpowder arms therefore require thorough and regular cleaning to remove the residue.

Gunpowder loads can be used in modern firearms as long as they are not gas-operated. The most compatible modern guns are smoothbore-barreled shotguns that are long-recoil operated with chrome-plated essential parts such as barrels and bores. Such guns have minimal fouling and corrosion and are easier to clean.

== History ==


=== China ===

The first confirmed reference to what can be considered gunpowder in China occurred in the 9th century AD during the Tang dynasty, first in a formula contained in the &quot;Taishang Shengzu Jindan Mijue&quot; (太上聖祖金丹秘訣) in 808, and then about 50 years later in a Taoist text known as the &quot;Zhenyuan miaodao yaolüe&quot; (真元妙道要略). The &quot;Taishang Shengzu Jindan Mijue&quot; mentions a formula composed of six parts sulfur to six parts saltpeter to one part birthwort herb. According to the &quot;Zhenyuan miaodao yaolüe&quot;, &quot;Some have heated together sulfur, realgar and saltpeter with honey; smoke and flames result, so that their hands and faces have been burnt, and even the whole house where they were working burned down.&quot; Based on these Taoist texts, the invention of gunpowder by Chinese alchemists was likely an accidental byproduct from experiments seeking to create the elixir of life. This experimental medicine origin is reflected in its Chinese name &quot;huoyao&quot; (), which means &quot;fire medicine&quot;. Saltpeter was known to the Chinese by the mid-1st century AD and was primarily produced in the provinces of Sichuan, Shanxi, and Shandong. There is strong evidence of the use of saltpeter and sulfur in various medicinal combinations. A Chinese alchemical text dated 492 noted saltpeter burnt with a purple flame, providing a practical and reliable means of distinguishing it from other inorganic salts, thus enabling alchemists to evaluate and compare purification techniques; the earliest Latin accounts of saltpeter purification are dated after 1200.

The earliest chemical formula for gunpowder appeared in the 11th century Song dynasty text, &quot;Wujing Zongyao&quot; (&quot;Complete Essentials from the Military Classics&quot;), written by Zeng Gongliang between 1040 and 1044. The &quot;Wujing Zongyao&quot; provides encyclopedia references to a variety of mixtures that included petrochemicals—as well as garlic and honey. A slow match for flame-throwing mechanisms using the siphon principle and for fireworks and rockets is mentioned. The mixture formulas in this book contain at most 50% not enough to create an explosion, they produce an incendiary instead. The &quot;Essentials&quot; was written by a Song dynasty court bureaucrat and there is little evidence that it had any immediate impact on warfare; there is no mention of its use in the chronicles of the wars against the Tanguts in the 11th century, and China was otherwise mostly at peace during this century. However, it had already been used for fire arrows since at least the 10th century. Its first recorded military application dates its use to 904 in the form of incendiary projectiles. In the following centuries various gunpowder weapons such as bombs, fire lances, and the gun appeared in China. Explosive weapons such as bombs have been discovered in a shipwreck off the shore of Japan dated from 1281, during the Mongol invasions of Japan.

By 1083 the Song court was producing hundreds of thousands of fire arrows for their garrisons. Bombs and the first proto-guns, known as &quot;fire lances&quot;, became prominent during the 12th century and were used by the Song during the Jin-Song Wars. Fire lances were first recorded to have been used at the Siege of De&#x27;an in 1132 by Song forces against the Jin. In the early 13th century the Jin used iron-casing bombs. Projectiles were added to fire lances, and re-usable fire lance barrels were developed, first out of hardened paper, and then metal. By 1257 some fire lances were firing wads of bullets. In the late 13th century metal fire lances became &#x27;eruptors&#x27;, proto-cannons firing co-viative projectiles (mixed with the propellant, rather than seated over it with a wad), and by 1287 at the latest, had become true guns, the hand cannon.

=== Middle East ===
According to Iqtidar Alam Khan, it was invading Mongols who introduced gunpowder to the Islamic world. The Muslims acquired knowledge of gunpowder sometime between 1240 and 1280, by which point the Syrian Hasan al-Rammah had written recipes, instructions for the purification of saltpeter, and descriptions of gunpowder incendiaries. It is implied by al-Rammah&#x27;s usage of &quot;terms that suggested he derived his knowledge from Chinese sources&quot; and his references to saltpeter as &quot;Chinese snow&quot; ( &#x27;), fireworks as &quot;Chinese flowers&quot;, and rockets as &quot;Chinese arrows&quot; that knowledge of gunpowder arrived from China. However, because al-Rammah attributes his material to &quot;his father and forefathers&quot;, al-Hassan argues that gunpowder became prevalent in Syria and Egypt by &quot;the end of the twelfth century or the beginning of the thirteenth&quot;. In Persia saltpeter was known as &quot;Chinese salt&quot; () &quot;namak-i chīnī&quot;) or &quot;salt from Chinese salt marshes&quot; ( &#x27;).

Hasan al-Rammah included 107 gunpowder recipes in his text &quot;al-Furusiyyah wa al-Manasib al-Harbiyya&quot; (&quot;The Book of Military Horsemanship and Ingenious War Devices&quot;), 22 of which are for rockets. If one takes the median of 17 of these 22 compositions for rockets (75% nitrates, 9.06% sulfur, and 15.94% charcoal), it is nearly identical to the modern reported ideal recipe of 75% potassium nitrate, 10% sulfur, and 15% charcoal. The text also mentions fuses, incendiary bombs, naphtha pots, fire lances, and an illustration and description of the earliest torpedo. The torpedo was called the &quot;egg which moves itself and burns&quot;. Two iron sheets were fastened together and tightened using felt. The flattened pear-shaped vessel was filled with gunpowder, metal filings, &quot;good mixtures&quot;, two rods, and a large rocket for propulsion. Judging by the illustration, it was evidently supposed to glide across the water. Fire lances were used in battles between the Muslims and Mongols in 1299 and 1303.

Al-Hassan claims that in the Battle of Ain Jalut of 1260, the Mamluks used &quot;the first cannon in history&quot; against the Mongols, utilizing a formula with near-identical ideal composition ratios for explosive gunpowder. Other historians urge caution regarding claims of Islamic firearms use in the 1204–1324 period, as late medieval Arabic texts used the same word for gunpowder, &quot;naft&quot;, that they used for an earlier incendiary, naphtha.

The earliest surviving documentary evidence for cannons in the Islamic world is from an Arabic manuscript dated to the early 14th century. The author&#x27;s name is uncertain but may have been Shams al-Din Muhammad, who died in 1350. Dating from around 1320–1350, the illustrations show gunpowder weapons such as gunpowder arrows, bombs, fire tubes, and fire lances or proto-guns. The manuscript describes a type of gunpowder weapon called a &quot;midfa&quot; which uses gunpowder to shoot projectiles out of a tube at the end of a stock. Some consider this to be a cannon while others do not. The problem with identifying cannons in early 14th century Arabic texts is the term &quot;midfa&quot;, which appears from 1342 to 1352 but cannot be proven to be true hand-guns or bombards. Contemporary accounts of a metal-barrel cannon in the Islamic world do not occur until 1365. Needham believes that in its original form the term &quot;midfa&quot; refers to the tube or cylinder of a naphtha projector (flamethrower), then after the invention of gunpowder it meant the tube of fire lances, and eventually it applied to the cylinder of hand-guns and cannons.

According to Paul E. J. Hammer, the Mamluks certainly used cannons by 1342. According to J. Lavin, cannons were used by Moors at the siege of Algeciras in 1343. A metal cannon firing an iron ball was described by Shihab al-Din Abu al-Abbas al-Qalqashandi between 1365 and 1376.

The musket appeared in the Ottoman Empire by 1465. In 1598, Chinese writer Zhao Shizhen described Turkish muskets as being superior to European muskets. The Chinese military book &quot;Wu Pei Chih&quot; (1621) later described Turkish muskets that used a rack-and-pinion mechanism, which was not known to have been used in European or Chinese firearms at the time.

The state-controlled manufacture of gunpowder by the Ottoman Empire through early supply chains to obtain nitre, sulfur and high-quality charcoal from oaks in Anatolia contributed significantly to its expansion between the 15th and 18th century. It was not until later in the 19th century when the syndicalist production of Turkish gunpowder was greatly reduced, which coincided with the decline of its military might.

=== Europe ===

The earliest Western accounts of gunpowder appear in texts written by English philosopher Roger Bacon in 1267 called and &quot;Opus Tertium&quot;. The oldest written recipes in continental Europe were recorded under the name Marcus Graecus or Mark the Greek between 1280 and 1300 in the &quot;Liber Ignium&quot;, or &quot;Book of Fires&quot;.

Some sources mention possible gunpowder weapons being deployed by the Mongols against European forces at the Battle of Mohi in 1241. Professor Kenneth Warren Chase credits the Mongols for introducing into Europe gunpowder and its associated weaponry. However, there is no clear route of transmission, and while the Mongols are often pointed to as the likeliest vector, Timothy May points out that &quot;there is no concrete evidence that the Mongols used gunpowder weapons on a regular basis outside of China.&quot; May also states, &quot;however [, ...] the Mongols used the gunpowder weapon in their wars against the Jin, the Song and in their invasions of Japan.&quot;

Records show that, in England, gunpowder was being made in 1346 at the Tower of London; a powder house existed at the Tower in 1461, and in 1515 three King&#x27;s gunpowder makers worked there. Gunpowder was also being made or stored at other royal castles, such as Portchester. The English Civil War (1642–1645) led to an expansion of the gunpowder industry, with the repeal of the Royal Patent in August 1641.

In late 14th century Europe, gunpowder was improved by &quot;corning&quot;, the practice of drying it into small clumps to improve combustion and consistency. During this time, European manufacturers also began regularly purifying saltpeter, using wood ashes containing potassium carbonate to precipitate calcium from their dung liquor, and using ox blood, alum, and slices of turnip to clarify the solution.

During the Renaissance, two European schools of pyrotechnic thought emerged, one in Italy and the other at Nuremberg, Germany. In Italy, Vannoccio Biringuccio, born in 1480, was a member of the guild &quot;Fraternita di Santa Barbara&quot; but broke with the tradition of secrecy by setting down everything he knew in a book titled &quot;De la pirotechnia&quot;, written in vernacular. It was published posthumously in 1540, with 9 editions over 138 years, and also reprinted by MIT Press in 1966.

By the mid-17th century fireworks were used for entertainment on an unprecedented scale in Europe, being popular even at resorts and public gardens. With the publication of &quot;Deutliche Anweisung zur Feuerwerkerey&quot; (1748), methods for creating fireworks were sufficiently well-known and well-described that &quot;Firework making has become an exact science.&quot; In 1774 Louis XVI ascended to the throne of France at age 20. After he discovered that France was not self-sufficient in gunpowder, a Gunpowder Administration was established; to head it, the lawyer Antoine Lavoisier was appointed. Although from a bourgeois family, after his degree in law Lavoisier became wealthy from a company set up to collect taxes for the Crown; this allowed him to pursue experimental natural science as a hobby.

Without access to cheap saltpeter (controlled by the British), for hundreds of years France had relied on saltpetremen with royal warrants, the &quot;droit de fouille&quot; or &quot;right to dig&quot;, to seize nitrous-containing soil and demolish walls of barnyards, without compensation to the owners. This caused farmers, the wealthy, or entire villages to bribe the petermen and the associated bureaucracy to leave their buildings alone and the saltpeter uncollected. Lavoisier instituted a crash program to increase saltpeter production, revised (and later eliminated) the &quot;droit de fouille&quot;, researched best refining and powder manufacturing methods, instituted management and record-keeping, and established pricing that encouraged private investment in works. Although saltpeter from new Prussian-style putrefaction works had not been produced yet (the process taking about 18 months), in only a year France had gunpowder to export. A chief beneficiary of this surplus was the American Revolution. By careful testing and adjusting the proportions and grinding time, powder from mills such as at Essonne outside Paris became the best in the world by 1788, and inexpensive.

Two British physicists, Andrew Noble and Frederick Abel, worked to improve the properties of gunpowder during the late 19th century. This formed the basis for the Noble-Abel gas equation for internal ballistics.

The introduction of smokeless powder in the late 19th century led to a contraction of the gunpowder industry. After the end of World War I, the majority of the British gunpowder manufacturers merged into a single company, &quot;Explosives Trades limited&quot;, and a number of sites were closed down, including those in Ireland. This company became Nobel Industries Limited, and in 1926 became a founding member of Imperial Chemical Industries. The Home Office removed gunpowder from its list of &quot;Permitted Explosives&quot;. Shortly afterwards, on 31 December 1931, the former Curtis &amp; Harvey&#x27;s Glynneath gunpowder factory at Pontneddfechan in Wales closed down. The factory was demolished by fire in 1932. The last remaining gunpowder mill at the Royal Gunpowder Factory, Waltham Abbey was damaged by a German parachute mine in 1941 and it never reopened. This was followed by the closure and demolition of the gunpowder section at the Royal Ordnance Factory, ROF Chorley, at the end of World War II, and of ICI Nobel&#x27;s Roslin gunpowder factory which closed in 1954. This left ICI Nobel&#x27;s Ardeer site in Scotland, which included a gunpowder factory, as the only factory in Great Britain producing gunpowder. The gunpowder area of the Ardeer site closed in October 1976.

=== India ===
Gunpowder and gunpowder weapons were transmitted to India through the Mongol invasions of India. The Mongols were defeated by Alauddin Khalji of the Delhi Sultanate, and some of the Mongol soldiers remained in northern India after their conversion to Islam. It was written in the &quot;Tarikh-i Firishta&quot; (1606–1607) that Nasiruddin Mahmud the ruler of the Delhi Sultanate presented the envoy of the Mongol ruler Hulegu Khan with a dazzling pyrotechnics display upon his arrival in Delhi in 1258. Nasiruddin Mahmud tried to express his strength as a ruler and tried to ward off any Mongol attempt similar to the Siege of Baghdad (1258). Firearms known as &quot;top-o-tufak&quot; also existed in many Muslim kingdoms in India by as early as 1366. From then on the employment of gunpowder warfare in India was prevalent, with events such as the &quot;Siege of Belgaum&quot; in 1473 by Sultan Muhammad Shah Bahmani.

The shipwrecked Ottoman Admiral Seydi Ali Reis is known to have introduced the earliest type of matchlock weapons, which the Ottomans used against the Portuguese during the Siege of Diu (1531). After that, a diverse variety of firearms, large guns in particular, became visible in Tanjore, Dacca, Bijapur, and Murshidabad. Guns made of bronze were recovered from Calicut (1504)- the former capital of the Zamorins
The Mughal emperor Akbar mass-produced matchlocks for the Mughal Army. Akbar is personally known to have shot a leading Rajput commander during the Siege of Chittorgarh. The Mughals began to use bamboo rockets (mainly for signalling) and employ sappers: special units that undermined heavy stone fortifications to plant gunpowder charges.

The Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan is known to have introduced much more advanced matchlocks, their designs were a combination of Ottoman and Mughal designs. Shah Jahan also countered the British and other Europeans in his province of Gujarāt, which supplied Europe saltpeter for use in gunpowder warfare during the 17th century. Bengal and Mālwa participated in saltpeter production. The Dutch, French, Portuguese, and English used Chhapra as a center of saltpeter refining.

Ever since the founding of the Sultanate of Mysore by Hyder Ali, French military officers were employed to train the Mysore Army. Hyder Ali and his son Tipu Sultan were the first to introduce modern cannons and muskets, their army was also the first in India to have official uniforms. During the Second Anglo-Mysore War Hyder Ali and his son Tipu Sultan unleashed the Mysorean rockets at their British opponents effectively defeating them on various occasions. The Mysorean rockets inspired the development of the Congreve rocket, which the British widely used during the Napoleonic Wars and the War of 1812.

=== Southeast Asia ===
Cannons were introduced to Majapahit when Kublai Khan&#x27;s Chinese army under the leadership of Ike Mese sought to invade Java in 1293. History of Yuan mentioned that the Mongol used cannons (Chinese: 炮—&quot;Pào&quot;) against Daha forces. Cannons were used by the Ayutthaya Kingdom in 1352 during its invasion of the Khmer Empire. Within a decade large quantities of gunpowder could be found in the Khmer Empire. By the end of the century firearms were also used by the Trần dynasty.

Even though the knowledge of making gunpowder-based weapons was known after the failed Mongol invasion of Java, and the predecessor of firearms, the pole gun (bedil tombak), is recorded as being used by Java in 1413, the knowledge of making &quot;true&quot; firearms came much later, after the middle of the 15th century. It was brought by the Islamic nations of West Asia, most probably the Arabs. The precise year of introduction is unknown, but it may be safely concluded to be no earlier than 1460. Before the arrival of the Portuguese in Southeast Asia, the natives already possessed primitive firearms, the Java arquebus. Portuguese influence to local weaponry after the capture of Malacca (1511) resulted in a new type of hybrid tradition matchlock firearm, the istinggar.

When the Portuguese came to the archipelago, they referred to the breech-loading swivel gun as &quot;berço&quot;, while the Spaniards call it &quot;verso&quot;. By the early 16th century, the Javanese already locally producing large guns, some of them still survived until the present day and dubbed as &quot;sacred cannon&quot; or &quot;holy cannon&quot;. These cannons varied between 180- and 260-pounders, weighing anywhere between 3 and 8 tons, length of them between 3 and 6 m.

Saltpeter harvesting was recorded by Dutch and German travelers as being common in even the smallest villages and was collected from the decomposition process of large dung hills specifically piled for the purpose. The Dutch punishment for possession of non-permitted gunpowder appears to have been amputation. Ownership and manufacture of gunpowder was later prohibited by the colonial Dutch occupiers. According to colonel McKenzie quoted in Sir Thomas Stamford Raffles&#x27;, &quot;The History of Java&quot; (1817), the purest sulfur was supplied from a crater from a mountain near the straits of Bali.

=== Historiography ===

On the origins of gunpowder technology, historian Tonio Andrade remarked, &quot;Scholars today overwhelmingly concur that the gun was invented in China.&quot; Gunpowder and the gun are widely believed by historians to have originated from China due to the large body of evidence that documents the evolution of gunpowder from a medicine to an incendiary and explosive, and the evolution of the gun from the fire lance to a metal gun, whereas similar records do not exist elsewhere. As Andrade explains, the large amount of variation in gunpowder recipes in China relative to Europe is &quot;evidence of experimentation in China, where gunpowder was at first used as an incendiary and only later became an explosive and a propellant... in contrast, formulas in Europe diverged only very slightly from the ideal proportions for use as an explosive and a propellant, suggesting that gunpowder was introduced as a mature technology.&quot;

However, the history of gunpowder is not without controversy. A major problem confronting the study of early gunpowder history is ready access to sources close to the events described. Often the first records potentially describing use of gunpowder in warfare were written several centuries after the fact, and may well have been colored by the contemporary experiences of the chronicler. Translation difficulties have led to errors or loose interpretations bordering on artistic licence. Ambiguous language can make it difficult to distinguish gunpowder weapons from similar technologies that do not rely on gunpowder. A commonly cited example is a report of the Battle of Mohi in Eastern Europe that mentions a &quot;long lance&quot; sending forth &quot;evil-smelling vapors and smoke&quot;, which has been variously interpreted by different historians as the &quot;first-gas attack upon European soil&quot; using gunpowder, &quot;the first use of cannon in Europe&quot;, or merely a &quot;toxic gas&quot; with no evidence of gunpowder. It is difficult to accurately translate original Chinese alchemical texts, which tend to explain phenomena through metaphor, into modern scientific language with rigidly defined terminology in English. Early texts potentially mentioning gunpowder are sometimes marked by a linguistic process where semantic change occurred. For instance, the Arabic word &quot;naft&quot; transitioned from denoting naphtha to denoting gunpowder, and the Chinese word &quot;pào&quot; changed in meaning from trebuchet to a cannon. This has led to arguments on the exact origins of gunpowder based on etymological foundations. Science and technology historian Bert S. Hall makes the observation that, &quot;It goes without saying, however, that historians bent on special pleading, or simply with axes of their own to grind, can find rich material in these terminological thickets.&quot;

Another major area of contention in modern studies of the history of gunpowder is regarding the transmission of gunpowder. While the literary and archaeological evidence supports a Chinese origin for gunpowder and guns, the manner in which gunpowder technology was transferred from China to the West is still under debate. It is unknown why the rapid spread of gunpowder technology across Eurasia took place over several decades whereas other technologies such as paper, the compass, and printing did not reach Europe until centuries after they were invented in China.

== Components ==

Gunpowder is a granular mixture of:

* a nitrate, typically potassium nitrate (KNO3), which supplies oxygen for the reaction;
* charcoal, which provides carbon and other fuel for the reaction, simplified as carbon (C);
* sulfur (S), which, while also serving as a fuel, lowers the temperature required to ignite the mixture, thereby increasing the rate of combustion.

Potassium nitrate is the most important ingredient in terms of both bulk and function because the combustion process releases oxygen from the potassium nitrate, promoting the rapid burning of the other ingredients. To reduce the likelihood of accidental ignition by static electricity, the granules of modern gunpowder are typically coated with graphite, which prevents the build-up of electrostatic charge.

Charcoal does not consist of pure carbon; rather, it consists of partially pyrolyzed cellulose, in which the wood is not completely decomposed. Carbon differs from ordinary charcoal. Whereas charcoal&#x27;s autoignition temperature is relatively low, carbon&#x27;s is much greater. Thus, a gunpowder composition containing pure carbon would burn similarly to a match head, at best.

The current standard composition for the gunpowder manufactured by pyrotechnicians was adopted as long ago as 1780. Proportions by weight are 75% potassium nitrate (known as saltpeter or saltpetre), 15% softwood charcoal, and 10% sulfur. These ratios have varied over the centuries and by country, and can be altered somewhat depending on the purpose of the powder. For instance, power grades of black powder, unsuitable for use in firearms but adequate for blasting rock in quarrying operations, are called blasting powder rather than gunpowder with standard proportions of 70% nitrate, 14% charcoal, and 16% sulfur; blasting powder may be made with the cheaper sodium nitrate substituted for potassium nitrate and proportions may be as low as 40% nitrate, 30% charcoal, and 30% sulfur. In 1857, Lammot du Pont solved the main problem of using cheaper sodium nitrate formulations when he patented DuPont &quot;B&quot; blasting powder. After manufacturing grains from press-cake in the usual way, his process tumbled the powder with graphite dust for 12 hours. This formed a graphite coating on each grain that reduced its ability to absorb moisture.

Neither the use of graphite nor sodium nitrate was new. Glossing gunpowder corns with graphite was already an accepted technique in 1839, and sodium nitrate-based blasting powder had been made in Peru for many years using the sodium nitrate mined at Tarapacá (now in Chile). Also, in 1846, two plants were built in south-west England to make blasting powder using this sodium nitrate. The idea may well have been brought from Peru by Cornish miners returning home after completing their contracts. Another suggestion is that it was William Lobb, the plant collector, who recognised the possibilities of sodium nitrate during his travels in South America. Lammot du Pont would have known about the use of graphite and probably also knew about the plants in south-west England. In his patent he was careful to state that his claim was for the combination of graphite with sodium nitrate-based powder, rather than for either of the two individual technologies.

French war powder in 1879 used the ratio 75% saltpeter, 12.5% charcoal, 12.5% sulfur. English war powder in 1879 used the ratio 75% saltpeter, 15% charcoal, 10% sulfur. The British Congreve rockets used 62.4% saltpeter, 23.2% charcoal and 14.4% sulfur, but the British Mark VII gunpowder was changed to 65% saltpeter, 20% charcoal and 15% sulfur. The explanation for the wide variety in formulation relates to usage. Powder used for rocketry can use a slower burn rate since it accelerates the projectile for a much longer time—whereas powders for weapons such as flintlocks, cap-locks, or matchlocks need a higher burn rate to accelerate the projectile in a much shorter distance. Cannons usually used lower burn-rate powders, because most would burst with higher burn-rate powders.

=== Other compositions ===

Besides black powder, there are other historically important types of gunpowder. &quot;Brown gunpowder&quot; is cited as composed of 79% nitre, 3% sulfur, and 18% charcoal per 100 of dry powder, with about 2% moisture. Prismatic Brown Powder is a large-grained product the Rottweil Company introduced in 1884 in Germany, which was adopted by the British Royal Navy shortly thereafter. The French navy adopted a fine, 3.1 millimeter, not prismatic grained product called &quot;Slow Burning Cocoa&quot; (SBC) or &quot;cocoa powder&quot;. These brown powders reduced burning rate even further by using as little as 2 percent sulfur and using charcoal made from rye straw that had not been completely charred, hence the brown color.

Lesmok powder was a product developed by DuPont in 1911, one of several semi-smokeless products in the industry containing a mixture of black and nitrocellulose powder. It was sold to Winchester and others primarily for .22 and .32 small calibers. Its advantage was that it was believed at the time to be less corrosive than smokeless powders then in use. It was not understood in the U.S. until the 1920s that the actual source of corrosion was the potassium chloride residue from potassium chlorate sensitized primers. The bulkier black powder fouling better disperses primer residue. Failure to mitigate primer corrosion by dispersion caused the false impression that nitrocellulose-based powder caused corrosion. Lesmok had some of the bulk of black powder for dispersing primer residue, but somewhat less total bulk than straight black powder, thus requiring less frequent bore cleaning. It was last sold by Winchester in 1947.

=== Sulfur-free powders ===
The development of smokeless powders, such as cordite, in the late 19th century created the need for a spark-sensitive priming charge, such as gunpowder. However, the sulfur content of traditional gunpowders caused corrosion problems with Cordite Mk I and this led to the introduction of a range of sulfur-free gunpowders, of varying grain sizes. They typically contain 70.5% of saltpeter and 29.5% of charcoal. Like black powder, they were produced in different grain sizes. In the United Kingdom, the finest grain was known as &quot;sulfur-free mealed powder&quot; (&quot;SMP&quot;). Coarser grains were numbered as sulfur-free gunpowder (SFG n): &#x27;SFG 12&#x27;, &#x27;SFG 20&#x27;, &#x27;SFG 40&#x27; and &#x27;SFG 90&#x27;, for example where the number represents the smallest BSS sieve mesh size, which retained no grains.

Sulfur&#x27;s main role in gunpowder is to decrease the ignition temperature. A sample reaction for sulfur-free gunpowder would be:
:&lt;chem&gt;6 KNO3 + C7H4O -&gt; 3 K2CO3 + 4 CO2 + 2 H2O + 3 N2&lt;/chem&gt;

=== Smokeless powders ===

The term &quot;black powder&quot; was coined in the late 19th century, primarily in the United States, to distinguish prior gunpowder formulations from the new smokeless powders and semi-smokeless powders. Semi-smokeless powders featured bulk volume properties that approximated black powder, but had significantly reduced amounts of smoke and combustion products. Smokeless powder has different burning properties (pressure vs. time) and can generate higher pressures and work per gram. This can rupture older weapons designed for black powder. Smokeless powders ranged in color from brownish tan to yellow to white. Most of the bulk semi-smokeless powders ceased to be manufactured in the 1920s.

== Granularity ==

=== Serpentine ===

The original dry-compounded powder used in 15th-century Europe was known as &quot;Serpentine&quot;, either a reference to Satan or to a common artillery piece that used it. The ingredients were ground
together with a mortar and pestle, perhaps for 24 hours, resulting in a fine flour. Vibration during transportation could cause the components to separate again, requiring remixing in the field. Also if the quality of the saltpeter was low (for instance if it was contaminated with highly hygroscopic calcium nitrate), or if the powder was simply old (due to the mildly hygroscopic nature of potassium nitrate), in humid weather it would need to be re-dried. The dust from &quot;repairing&quot; powder in the field was a major hazard.

Loading cannons or bombards before the powder-making advances of the Renaissance was a skilled art. Fine powder loaded haphazardly or too tightly would burn incompletely or too slowly. Typically, the breech-loading powder chamber in the rear of the piece was filled only about half full, the serpentine powder neither too compressed nor too loose, a wooden bung pounded in to seal the chamber from the barrel when assembled, and the projectile placed on. A carefully determined empty space was necessary for the charge to burn effectively. When the cannon was fired through the touchhole, turbulence from the initial surface combustion caused the rest of the powder to be rapidly exposed to the flame.

The advent of much more powerful and easy to use &quot;corned&quot; powder changed this procedure, but serpentine was used with older guns into the 17th century.

=== Corning ===

For propellants to oxidize and burn rapidly and effectively, the combustible ingredients must be reduced to the smallest possible particle sizes, and be as thoroughly mixed as possible. Once mixed, however, for better results in a gun, makers discovered that the final product should be in the form of individual dense grains that spread the fire quickly from grain to grain, much as straw or twigs catch fire more quickly than a pile of sawdust.

In late 14th century Europe and China, gunpowder was improved by wet grinding; liquid such as distilled spirits were added during the grinding-together of the ingredients and the moist paste dried afterwards. The principle of wet mixing to prevent the separation of dry ingredients, invented for gunpowder, is used today in the pharmaceutical industry. It was discovered that if the paste was rolled into balls before drying the resulting gunpowder absorbed less water from the air during storage and traveled better. The balls were then crushed in a mortar by the gunner immediately before use, with the old problem of uneven particle size and packing causing unpredictable results. If the right size particles were chosen, however, the result was a great improvement in power. Forming the damp paste into &quot;corn&quot;-sized clumps by hand or with the use of a sieve instead of larger balls produced a product after drying that loaded much better, as each tiny piece provided its own surrounding air space that allowed much more rapid combustion than a fine powder. This &quot;corned&quot; gunpowder was from 30% to 300% more powerful. An example is cited where of serpentine was needed to shoot a ball, but only of corned powder.

Because the dry powdered ingredients must be mixed and bonded together for extrusion and cut into grains to maintain the blend, size reduction and mixing is done while the ingredients are damp, usually with water. After 1800, instead of forming grains by hand or with sieves, the damp &quot;mill-cake&quot; was pressed in molds to increase its density and extract the liquid, forming &quot;press-cake&quot;. The pressing took varying amounts of time, depending on conditions such as atmospheric humidity. The hard, dense product was broken again into tiny pieces, which were separated with sieves to produce a uniform product for each purpose: coarse powders for cannons, finer grained powders for muskets, and the finest for small hand guns and priming. Inappropriately fine-grained powder often caused cannons to burst before the projectile could move down the barrel, due to the high initial spike in pressure. &quot;Mammoth&quot; powder with large grains, made for Rodman&#x27;s 15-inch cannon, reduced the pressure to only 20 percent as high as ordinary cannon powder would have produced.

In the mid-19th century, measurements were made determining that the burning rate within a grain of black powder (or a tightly packed mass) is about 6 cm/s (0.20 feet/s), while the rate of ignition propagation from grain to grain is around 9 m/s (30 feet/s), over two orders of magnitude faster.

=== Modern types ===
Modern corning first compresses the fine black powder meal into blocks with a fixed density (1.7 g/cm3). In the United States, gunpowder grains were designated F (for fine) or C (for coarse). Grain diameter decreased with a larger number of Fs and increased with a larger number of Cs, ranging from about for 7F to for 7C. Even larger grains were produced for artillery bore diameters greater than about . The standard DuPont &quot;Mammoth&quot; powder developed by Thomas Rodman and Lammot du Pont for use during the American Civil War had grains averaging in diameter with edges rounded in a glazing barrel. Other versions had grains the size of golf and tennis balls for use in Rodman guns. In 1875 DuPont introduced &quot;Hexagonal&quot; powder for large artillery, which was pressed using shaped plates with a small center core—about diameter, like a wagon wheel nut, the center hole widened as the grain burned. By 1882 German makers also produced hexagonal grained powders of a similar size for artillery.

By the late 19th century manufacturing focused on standard grades of black powder from Fg used in large bore rifles and shotguns, through FFg (medium and small-bore arms such as muskets and fusils), FFFg (small-bore rifles and pistols), and FFFFg (extreme small bore, short pistols and most commonly for priming flintlocks). A coarser grade for use in military artillery blanks was designated A-1. These grades were sorted on a system of screens with oversize retained on a mesh of 6 wires per inch, A-1 retained on 10 wires per inch, Fg retained on 14, FFg on 24, FFFg on 46, and FFFFg on 60. Fines designated FFFFFg were usually reprocessed to minimize explosive dust hazards. In the United Kingdom, the main service gunpowders were classified RFG (rifle grained fine) with diameter of one or two millimeters and RLG (rifle grained large) for grain diameters between two and six millimeters. Gunpowder grains can alternatively be categorized by mesh size: the BSS sieve mesh size, being the smallest mesh size, which retains no grains. Recognized grain sizes are Gunpowder G 7, G 20, G 40, and G 90.

Owing to the large market of antique and replica black-powder firearms in the US, modern black powder substitutes like Pyrodex, Triple Seven and Black Mag3 pellets have been developed since the 1970s. These products, which should not be confused with smokeless powders, aim to produce less fouling (solid residue), while maintaining the traditional volumetric measurement system for charges. Claims of less corrosiveness of these products have been controversial however. New cleaning products for black-powder guns have also been developed for this market.

== Chemistry ==

A simple, commonly cited, chemical equation for the combustion of gunpowder is:

: 2 KNO3 + S + 3 C → K2S + N2 + 3 CO2.

A balanced, but still simplified, equation is:

: 10 KNO3 + 3 S + 8 C → 2 K2CO3 + 3 K2SO4 + 6 CO2 + 5 N2.

The exact percentages of ingredients varied greatly through the medieval period as the recipes were developed by trial and error, and needed to be updated for changing military technology.

Gunpowder does not burn as a single reaction, so the byproducts are not easily predicted. One study showed that it produced (in order of descending quantities) 55.91% solid products: potassium carbonate, potassium sulfate, potassium sulfide, sulfur, potassium nitrate, potassium thiocyanate, carbon, ammonium carbonate and 42.98% gaseous products: carbon dioxide, nitrogen, carbon monoxide, hydrogen sulfide, hydrogen, methane, 1.11% water.

Gunpowder made with less-expensive and more plentiful sodium nitrate instead of potassium nitrate (in appropriate proportions) works just as well. Gunpowder releases 3 megajoules per kilogram and contains its own oxidant. This is less than TNT (4.7 megajoules per kilogram), or gasoline (47.2 megajoules per kilogram in combustion, but gasoline requires an oxidant; for instance, an optimized gasoline and O2 mixture releases 10.4 megajoules per kilogram, taking into account the mass of the oxygen).

Gunpowder also has a low energy density compared to modern &quot;smokeless&quot; powders, and thus to achieve high energy loadings, large amounts are needed with heavy projectiles.

== Production ==

For the most powerful black powder, meal powder, a wood charcoal is used. The best wood for the purpose is Pacific willow, but others such as alder or buckthorn can be used. In Great Britain between the 15th and 19th centuries charcoal from alder buckthorn was greatly prized for gunpowder manufacture; cottonwood was used by the American Confederate States. The ingredients are reduced in particle size and mixed as intimately as possible. Originally, this was with a mortar-and-pestle or a similarly operating stamping-mill, using copper, bronze or other non-sparking materials, until supplanted by the rotating ball mill principle with non-sparking bronze or lead. Historically, a marble or limestone edge runner mill, running on a limestone bed, was used in Great Britain; however, by the mid 19th century this had changed to either an iron-shod stone wheel or a cast iron wheel running on an iron bed. The mix was dampened with alcohol or water during grinding to prevent accidental ignition. This also helps the extremely soluble saltpeter to mix into the microscopic pores of the very high surface-area charcoal.


Around the late 14th century, European powdermakers first began adding liquid during grinding to improve mixing, reduce dust, and with it the risk of explosion. The powder-makers would then shape the resulting paste of dampened gunpowder, known as mill cake, into corns, or grains, to dry. Not only did corned powder keep better because of its reduced surface area, gunners also found that it was more powerful and easier to load into guns. Before long, powder-makers standardized the process by forcing mill cake through sieves instead of corning powder by hand.

The improvement was based on reducing the surface area of a higher density composition. At the beginning of the 19th century, makers increased density further by static pressing. They shoveled damp mill cake into a two-foot square box, placed this beneath a screw press and reduced it to half its volume. &quot;Press cake&quot; had the hardness of slate. They broke the dried slabs with hammers or rollers, and sorted the granules with sieves into different grades. In the United States, Eleuthere Irenee du Pont, who had learned the trade from Lavoisier, tumbled the dried grains in rotating barrels to round the edges and increase durability during shipping and handling. (Sharp grains rounded off in transport, producing fine &quot;meal dust&quot; that changed the burning properties.)

Another advance was the manufacture of kiln charcoal by distilling wood in heated iron retorts instead of burning it in earthen pits. Controlling the temperature influenced the power and consistency of the finished gunpowder. In 1863, in response to high prices for Indian saltpeter, DuPont chemists developed a process using potash or mined potassium chloride to convert plentiful Chilean sodium nitrate to potassium nitrate.

The following year (1864) the Gatebeck Low Gunpowder Works in Cumbria (Great Britain) started a plant to manufacture potassium nitrate by essentially the same chemical process. This is nowadays called the &#x27;Wakefield Process&#x27;, after the owners of the company. It would have used potassium chloride from the Staßfurt mines, near Magdeburg, Germany, which had recently become available in industrial quantities.

During the 18th century, gunpowder factories became increasingly dependent on mechanical energy. Despite mechanization, production difficulties related to humidity control, especially during the pressing, were still present in the late 19th century. A paper from 1885 laments that &quot;Gunpowder is such a nervous and sensitive spirit, that in almost every process of manufacture it changes under our hands as the weather changes.&quot; Pressing times to the desired density could vary by a factor of three depending on the atmospheric humidity.

== Legal status ==

The United Nations Model Regulations on the Transportation of Dangerous Goods and national transportation authorities, such as United States Department of Transportation, have classified gunpowder (black powder) as a &quot;Group A: Primary explosive substance&quot; for shipment because it ignites so easily. Complete manufactured devices containing black powder are usually classified as &quot;Group D: Secondary detonating substance, or black powder, or article containing secondary detonating substance&quot;, such as firework, class D model rocket engine, etc., for shipment because they are harder to ignite than loose powder. As explosives, they all fall into the category of Class 1.

== Other uses ==

Besides its use as a propellant in firearms and artillery, black powder&#x27;s other main use has been as a blasting powder in quarrying, mining, and road construction (including railroad construction). During the 19th century, outside of war emergencies such as the Crimean War or the American Civil War, more black powder was used in these industrial uses than in firearms and artillery. Dynamite gradually replaced it for those uses. Today, industrial explosives for such uses are still a huge market, but most of the market is in newer explosives rather than black powder.

Beginning in the 1930s, gunpowder or smokeless powder was used in rivet guns, stun guns for animals, cable splicers and other industrial construction tools. The &quot;stud gun&quot;, a powder-actuated tool, drove nails or screws into solid concrete, a function not possible with hydraulic tools, and today is still an important part of various industries, but the cartridges usually use smokeless powders. Industrial shotguns have been used to eliminate persistent material rings in operating rotary kilns (such as those for cement, lime, phosphate, etc.) and clinker in operating furnaces, and commercial tools make the method more reliable.

Gunpowder has occasionally been employed for other purposes besides weapons, mining, fireworks and construction:

* After the Battle of Aspern-Essling (1809), Dominique-Jean Larrey, the surgeon of the Napoleonic Army, lacking salt, seasoned a horse meat bouillon for the wounded under his care with gunpowder. It was also used for sterilization in ships when there was no alcohol.
* British sailors used gunpowder to create tattoos when ink wasn&#x27;t available, by pricking the skin and rubbing the powder into the wound in a method known as traumatic tattooing.
* Christiaan Huygens experimented with gunpowder in 1673 in an early attempt to build an gunpowder engine, but he did not succeed. Modern attempts to recreate his invention were similarly unsuccessful.
* Near London in 1853, Captain Shrapnel demonstrated a mineral processing use of black powder in a method for crushing gold-bearing ores by firing them from a cannon into an iron chamber, and &quot;much satisfaction was expressed by all present&quot;. He hoped it would be useful on the goldfields of California and Australia. Nothing came of the invention, as continuously operating crushing machines that achieved more reliable comminution were already coming into use.
* Starting in 1967, Los Angeles-based artist Ed Ruscha began using gunpowder as an artistic medium for a series of works on paper.

Gunpowder had originally been produced for medicinal purposes. It was eaten, in hopes of curing digestive ailments; inhaled, for respiratory disorders; and, as mentioned, rubbed onto skin level disorders like rashes or burns.

<doc id="12740" wikidata="Q92627" url="?curid=12740" title="Gary Kildall">
<text>Gary Arlen Kildall (; May 19, 1942 – July 11, 1994) was an American computer scientist and microcomputer entrepreneur. During the 1970s, Kildall created the CP/M operating system among other operating systems and programming tools, and subsequently founded Digital Research, Inc. to market and sell his software products. He is considered a pioneer of the personal computer revolution.
In 1974 in Pacific Grove, Kildall demonstrated the first working prototype of CP/M, which would go on to become the dominant operating system on microcomputers. Together with his invention of the BIOS (Basic Input Output System), his operating system allowed a microprocessor-based computer to communicate with a disk storage. Kildall was among the earliest individuals to recognize microprocessors as fully capable computers. During the 1980s, Kildall also appeared on PBS as co-host of &quot;Computer Chronicles&quot;, a weekly informational program that covered the latest developments in personal computing.

== Early life ==
Gary Kildall was born and grew up in Seattle, Washington, where his family operated a seamanship school. His father, Joseph Kildall, was a captain of Norwegian heritage. His mother Emma was of half Swedish descent, as Kildall&#x27;s grandmother was born in Långbäck, Sweden, in Skellefteå Municipality, but emigrated to Canada at 23 years of age.

=== Education ===

Kildall earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree in mathematics in 1967 and a master&#x27;s degree in Computer Science in 1968, both from the University of Washington. At one point, he had hoped to become a mathematics teacher. During his studies, Kildall became increasingly interested in computer technology and enrolled to attain a Ph.D. in Computer Science.

Kildall fulfilled his draft obligation by teaching at the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, California.

Kildall briefly returned to UW and finished his doctorate in computer science in 1972.

Intel lent him systems using the 8008 and 8080 processors, and in 1973, he developed the first high-level programming language for microprocessors, called PL/M. For Intel he also wrote 8008 and 8080 instruction set simulators named INTERP/8 and INTERP/80. He created CP/M the same year to enable the 8080 to control a floppy drive, combining for the first time all the essential components of a computer at the microcomputer scale. He demonstrated CP/M to Intel, but Intel had little interest and chose to market PL/M instead.

== Business career ==
=== CP/M ===

In 1973 Kildall and Kathryn Strutynski developed the language PL/M to produce CP/M, one of the first operating systems for personal computers, they used as reference their experience with the IBM mainframe computers and the operating system VM.

Kildall and his wife Dorothy established a company, originally called &quot;Intergalactic Digital Research&quot; (later renamed as Digital Research, Inc.), to market the operating system CP/M through advertisements in hobbyist magazines. Digital Research licensed CP/M for the IMSAI 8080, a popular clone of the Altair 8800. As more manufacturers licensed CP/M, it became a de facto standard and had to support an increasing number of hardware variations. In response, Kildall pioneered the concept of a BIOS, a set of simple programs stored in the computer hardware (ROM or EPROM chip) that enabled CP/M to run on different systems without modification.

CP/M&#x27;s quick success took Kildall by surprise, and he was slow to update it for high density floppy disks and hard disk drives. After hardware manufacturers talked about creating a rival operating system, Kildall started a rush project to develop CP/M 2. By 1981, at the peak of its popularity, CP/M ran on different computer models and DRI had  million in yearly revenues.

Between 1983 and 1984, Digital Research offered several of their business and educational applications for the IBM PC on bootable floppy diskettes bundled with SpeedStart CP/M, a reduced version of CP/M-86 as a bootable runtime environment.

=== IBM dealings ===
IBM approached Digital Research in 1980, at Bill Gates&#x27; suggestion, to negotiate the purchase of a forthcoming version of CP/M called CP/M-86 for the IBM PC. Gary had left initial negotiations to his wife, Dorothy, as he usually did, while he and colleague and developer of MP/M operating system Tom Rolander used Gary&#x27;s private aeroplane to deliver software to manufacturer Bill Godbout. Before the IBM representatives would explain the purpose of their visit, they insisted that Dorothy sign a non-disclosure agreement. On the advice of DRI attorney Gerry Davis, Dorothy refused to sign the agreement without Gary&#x27;s approval. Gary returned in the afternoon and tried to move the discussion with IBM forward, and accounts disagree on whether he signed the non-disclosure agreement, as well as whether he ever met with the IBM representatives.

Various reasons have been given for the two companies failing to reach an agreement. DRI, which had only a few products, might have been unwilling to sell its main product to IBM for a one-time payment rather than its usual royalty-based plan. Dorothy might have believed that the company could not deliver CP/M-86 on IBM&#x27;s proposed schedule, as the company was busy developing an implementation of the PL/I programming language for Data General. Also possible, the IBM representatives might have been annoyed that DRI had spent hours on what they considered a routine formality. According to Kildall, the IBM representatives took the same flight to Florida that night that he and Dorothy took for their vacation, and they negotiated further on the flight, reaching a handshake agreement. IBM lead negotiator Jack Sams insisted that he never met Gary, and one IBM colleague has confirmed that Sams said so at the time. He accepted that someone else in his group might have been on the same flight, and noted that he flew back to Seattle to talk with Microsoft again.

Sams related the story to Gates, who had already agreed to provide a BASIC interpreter and several other programs for the PC. Gates&#x27; impression of the story was that Gary capriciously &quot;went flying&quot;, as he would later tell reporters. Sams left Gates with the task of finding a usable operating system, and a few weeks later he proposed using the operating system 86-DOS—an independently developed operating system that implemented Kildall&#x27;s CP/M API—from Seattle Computer Products (SCP). Paul Allen negotiated a licensing deal with SCP. Allen had 86-DOS adapted for IBM&#x27;s hardware, and IBM shipped it as IBM PC DOS.

Kildall obtained a copy of PC DOS, examined it, and concluded that it infringed on CP/M. When he asked Gerry Davis what legal options were available, Davis told him that intellectual property law for software was not clear enough to sue. Instead Kildall only threatened IBM with legal action, and IBM responded with a proposal to offer CP/M-86 as an option for the PC in return for a release of liability. Kildall accepted, believing that IBM&#x27;s new system (like its previous personal computers) would not be a significant commercial success. When the IBM PC was introduced, IBM sold its operating system as an unbundled option. One of the operating system options was PC DOS, priced at . PC DOS was seen as a practically necessary option; most software titles required it and without it the IBM PC was limited to its built-in Cassette BASIC. CP/M-86 shipped a few months later six times more expensive at , and sold poorly against DOS and enjoyed far less software support.

=== Multi-Programming Monitor Control Program (MP/M) ===

With the loss of the IBM deal, Gary and Dorothy found themselves under pressure to bring in more experienced management, and Gary&#x27;s influence over the company waned. He worked in various experimental and research projects, such as a version of CP/M with multitasking (MP/M), created by Digital Research developer Tom Rolander in 1979. Kildall also worked on an implementation of the Logo programming language. He hoped that Logo, an educational dialect of LISP, would supplant BASIC in education, but it did not.

=== FlexOS ===
In 1985 Digital Research developed FlexOS, a modular real-time multiuser multitasking operating system (RTOS).

=== Graphics Environment Manager (GEM) ===

After seeing a demonstration of the Apple Lisa, Kildall oversaw the creation of DRI&#x27;s own graphical user interface, called GEM, which was introduced on February 28, 1985. Novell acquired DRI in 1991 in a deal that netted millions for Kildall.

Kildall resigned as CEO of Digital Research on 28 June 1985, but remained chairman of the board.

=== Computer Chronicles ===
Kildall co-hosted a public television program produced by PBS called &quot;Computer Chronicles&quot;. It followed trends in personal computing. Gary co-hosted the program for seven years during the first eight seasons from 1983 to 1990. After this time the program continued through its 19th season, with the last episode aired on June 25, 2002.

=== Activenture ===

In 1984 Gary started another company, &quot;Activenture&quot;, which adapted optical disc technology for computer use, using as reference the Red Book developed by Sony and Phillips in 1980. In 1985 the CD-ROM was presented by Philips and Sony, the same year Activenture was renamed &quot;KnowledgeSet&quot;.

==== The Electronic Encyclopedia ====

In June 1985 Digital Research released &quot;The Electronic Encyclopedia&quot;, a CD-ROM version of Grolier&#x27;s &quot;Academic American Encyclopedia&quot;. The first computer encyclopedia, it included pictures in 1990 and added audio and videos in 1992. The encyclopedia was acquired by Banta Corporation; its last CD-ROM version was published in 2003. 

=== Prometheus Light and Sound (PLS) ===

Kildall&#x27;s final business venture, known as &quot;Prometheus Light and Sound&quot; (PLS) and based in Austin, Texas, developed a modular PBX communication system that integrated land-line telephones with mobile phones (called &quot;Intelliphone&quot;) to reduce the then-high online costs and to remotely connect with home appliances.

Prometheus Light and Sound system included a UUCP-based store and forward system to exchange emails and files between the various nodes and was planned to include TCP/IP support at a later point in time.

=== Computer Animation ===

According to Brian Halla, Intel&#x27;s technical liaison to Digital Research in the 1970s, Gary Kildall showed him a VAX 11/780 running in his house generating a Coke bottle spinning. According to Halla, Kildall sold it a few months later to Pixar.

== &quot;Computer Connections&quot; ==
In 1992, Kildall was invited to the University of Washington computer science program&#x27;s 25th anniversary event. As a distinguished graduate of the program, Kildall was disappointed when asked to attend simply as an audience member. He also took offense at the decision to give the keynote speech to Bill Gates, a Harvard dropout who had donated to UW, but had never attended.

In response, Kildall began writing a memoir, entitled &quot;Computer Connections: People, Places, and Events in the Evolution of the Personal Computer Industry&quot;. The memoir, which Kildall sought to publish, expressed his frustration that people did not seem to value elegance in computer software. 

Writing about Bill Gates, Kildall described him as &quot;more of an opportunist than a technical type, and severely opinionated, even when the opinion he holds is absurd.&quot;

In an appendix, he called DOS &quot;plain and simple theft&quot; because its first 26 system calls worked the same as CP/M&#x27;s. He accused IBM of contriving the price difference between PC DOS and CP/M-86 in order to marginalize CP/M.

Kildall had completed a rough draft of the manuscript by the end of 1993, but the full text remains unpublished. Journalist Harold Evans used the memoir as a primary source for a chapter about Kildall in the 2004 book &quot;They Made America&quot;, concluding that Microsoft had robbed Kildall of his inventions. IBM veterans from the PC project disputed the book&#x27;s description of events, and Microsoft described it as &quot;one-sided and inaccurate.&quot;

In August 2016, Kildall&#x27;s family made the first seven chapters of &quot;Computer Connections&quot; available as a free public download.

== Personal life ==
Kildall self-described as a &quot;greaser&quot; during high school, and his colleagues recall him as creative, easygoing, and adventurous. In addition to flying, he loved sports cars, auto racing, and boating, and had a lifelong love of the sea.

Although Kildall preferred to leave the IBM affair in the past and to be known for his work before and afterward, he continually faced comparisons between himself and Bill Gates, as well as fading memories of his contributions. A legend grew around the fateful IBM-DRI meeting, encouraged by Gates and various journalists, suggesting that Kildall had irresponsibly taken the day off for a recreational flight.

In later years, Kildall privately expressed bitter feelings about being overshadowed by Microsoft, and began suffering from alcoholism.

Selling DRI to Novell had made Kildall a wealthy man, and he moved to the West Lake Hills suburb of Austin. His Austin house was a lakeside property, with stalls for several sports cars, and a video studio in the basement. Kildall owned and flew his own Learjet and had at least one boat on the lake. While in Austin he also participated in volunteer efforts to assist children with HIV/AIDS. He also owned a mansion with a panoramic ocean view in Pebble Beach, California, near the headquarters of DRI.

== Death and legacy ==
On July 8, 1994, at the age of 52, Kildall sustained a head injury at the Franklin Street Bar &amp; Grill, a biker bar in Monterey, California. The exact circumstances of the injury are unclear. Various sources have claimed he fell from a chair, fell down steps, or was assaulted because he had entered the establishment wearing Harley-Davidson leathers. Harold Evans, in &quot;They Made America&quot;, states that Kildall &quot;stumbled and hit his head&quot; inside the premises, and &quot;was found on the floor.&quot;

Following the injury, Kildall was discharged from the hospital twice. He was pronounced dead at the Community Hospital of the Monterey Peninsula, on July 11, 1994. An autopsy, conducted on July 12, did not conclusively determine the cause of death. Evans states that Kildall&#x27;s head injury triggered a cerebral hemorrhage, causing a blood clot to form inside the skull. A CP/M Usenet FAQ states that Kildall was concussed due to his injury, and died of a heart attack; the connection between the two is unclear. Medical evidence of chronic alcoholism was found during the autopsy.

Initial news reports and police investigation viewed Kildall&#x27;s death as a possible homicide. According to the coroner&#x27;s report, Kildall&#x27;s fatal injury may have taken place &quot;as a result of foul play,&quot; and the case was referred to the Monterey Police Department. &quot;We&#x27;re going to investigate it as a possible homicide,&quot; said police Sgt. Frank Sollecito. &quot;I&#x27;m not going to flat-out say it&#x27;s a homicide&quot;.

Kildall&#x27;s body was cremated. His remains were buried in Evergreen Washelli Memorial Park, in north Seattle.

=== Recognition ===
Following the announcement of Kildall&#x27;s death, Bill Gates commented that he was &quot;one of the original pioneers of the PC revolution&quot; and &quot;a very creative computer scientist who did excellent work. Although we were competitors, I always had tremendous respect for his contributions to the PC industry. His untimely death was very unfortunate and his work will be missed.&quot;

Stewart Cheifet, his co-host on &quot;Computer Chronicles&quot;, said that Kildall was his &quot;favorite guy&quot; and praised his skills and contributions in the development of personal computing. Cheifet also commented: &quot;Gary&#x27;s problem was that he was too much of a gentleman. He wasn&#x27;t a killer business kind of guy&quot;, adding that he was &quot;a decent man in a business that was hard to succeed in if you were decent.&quot;

In March 1995, Kildall was posthumously honored by the Software Publishers Association (SPA) for his contributions to the microcomputer industry:

* The first programming language and first compiler specifically for microprocessors: PL/M. (1973)
* The first microprocessor disk operating system, which eventually sold a quarter of a million copies: CP/M. (1974)
* The first successful open system architecture by segregating system-specific hardware interfaces in a set of BIOS routines. (1975)
* Creation of the first diskette track buffering schemes, read-ahead algorithms, file directory caches, and RAM drive emulators.
* Introduction of operating systems with preemptive multitasking and windowing capabilities and menu-driven user interfaces (with Digital Research): MP/M, Concurrent CP/M, Concurrent DOS, DOS Plus, GEM.
* Introduction of a binary recompiler: XLT86. (1981)
* The first computer interface for video disks to allow automatic nonlinear playback, presaging today&#x27;s interactive multimedia. (1984, with Activenture)
* The file system and data structures for the first consumer CD-ROM. (1985, with KnowledgeSet)

In April 2014, the city of Pacific Grove installed a commemorative plaque outside Kildall&#x27;s former residence, which also served as the early headquarters of Digital Research.

==In popular culture==
Steve Hauk wrote a play &quot;A Mild Concussion&quot;. Later, with Stewart Cheifet, a second version of the play was written under the title &quot;The Forgotten Computer Genius&quot;. The play looks at the final days of a computer genius.

<doc id="12741" wikidata="Q939074" url="?curid=12741" title="Gesta Danorum">
<text> (&quot;Deeds of the Danes&quot;) is a patriotic work of Danish history, by the 12th-century author Saxo Grammaticus (&quot;Saxo the Literate&quot;, literally &quot;the Grammarian&quot;). It is the most ambitious literary undertaking of medieval Denmark and is an essential source for the nation&#x27;s early history. It is also one of the oldest known written documents about the history of Estonia and Latvia.

Consisting of sixteen books written in Latin on the invitation of Archbishop Absalon, describes Danish history and to some degree Scandinavian history in general, from prehistory to the late 12th century. In addition, offers singular reflections on European affairs in the High Middle Ages from a unique Scandinavian perspective, supplementing what has been handed down by historians from Western and Southern Europe.

== Books ==
The sixteen books, in prose with an occasional excursion into poetry, can be categorized into two parts: Books 1–9, which deal with Norse mythology and semi-legendary Danish history, and Books 10–16, which deal with medieval history. Book 9 ends with Gorm the Old. The last three books (14–16), which describe Danish conquests on the south shore of the Baltic Sea and wars against Slavic peoples (the Northern Crusades), are very valuable for the history of West Slavic tribes (Polabian Slavs, Pomeranians) and Slavic paganism. Book 14 contains a unique description of the temple on the island of Rügen.

=== Overview ===
==== Book 1 ====
The first book is mostly Saxo&#x27;s original work, sharing little with other primary works, but taking some inspiration from Ancient Greek epics. It very briefly covers the rule of the eponymous founder of the Danish nation, Dan, but also his brother Angul, his sons Humble and Lother, and Dan&#x27;s grandson, Skiold, whose son, Gram is the first Danish king to be given some detail, his reign revolves around conquering Sweden and Finland, only to die in a battle. Most of the book deals with the adventures of Hading, the son of Gram and Finnish princess, Signe. Here the adventure concerns the loss of Denmark to the Swedes as well as Hading&#x27;s attempts to reclaim it with the help of giants and Odin. The book concludes with Hading&#x27;s suicide after hearing of his friend&#x27;s death.

==== Book 2 ====
Book 2 follows adventures of Hading&#x27;s descendants, who perform cunning raids across the Baltic Sea and far as England, while encountering many supernatural events and being forced to solve disputes via single combat. This book includes the stories of kings Helge and Rolf Krake, which are also told in &quot;Hrólfs saga kraka&quot;.

==== Book 3 ====
Book 3 begins with the story of a Swedish prince, Hother, in an alternate version of the story of Höðr and the death of the god Baldr (here presented as a false god named Balderus). Hother eventually does become King in Denmark after the deaths of Rolf Krake and his usurper Hiartuar.

The second half of the book introduces Amleth, as a grandson of the Danish king Rorik. Amleth&#x27;s father was murdered by his uncle, the governor of Jylland. Amleth pretends to be a fool in fear of his uncle who has married his mother. He is sent to Britain by his uncle to be put to death, but secretly rewrites the death warrant and instead marries the daughter of the king. Then he returns to Denmark and kills his uncle. This story was later told by Shakespeare as &quot;Hamlet&quot;.

==== Book 4 ====
After killing his uncle and securing the support of his people in doing so, he returns to Britain. His father-in-law sends him to woo (on the King&#x27;s behalf) the Scottish Queen Hermutrude, who is famous for murdering all her suitors. However, Hermutrude refuses to marry the King and instead marries Amleth, making the King into Amleth&#x27;s enemy. Amleth is killed by the new King of Denmark, Wiglek, who then marries Hermutrude. Many subsequent kings follow.

==== Book 5 ====
Book 5 covers the life of just a single king, Frotho III, and focuses on his empire-building and the exploits of his brilliant Norwegian advisor, Erick the Eloquent (later King of Sweden). Ultimately Frotho ends up ruling over Britain, Scandinavia, the Slavs, and the Huns. Other tales from Norse legend are included in this book, within Frotho&#x27;s lifetime, including the story of Hedin and Hogni and the story of Hialmar and Arrow-Odd. Saxo says that it was during Frotho&#x27;s reign that Jesus came to Earth, and there was uninterrupted peace around the world. Frotho is eventually killed by a sorceress in the form of a sea-cow.

==== Book 6 ====
Follows the adventurers of the legendary hero, Starkad who is disappointed in the decadent ways of Frothi III&#x27;s descendants.

==== Book 7 ====

==== Book 9 ====
The book deals with Ragnar Lothbrok and his rising empire, he appoints many of his sons to govern parts of his empire all the way from Scotland to Scythia.
== History ==

=== Chronology ===
When exactly was written is the subject of numerous works; however, it is generally agreed that was not finished before 1208. The last event described in the last book (Book 16) is King Canute VI of Denmark subduing Pomerania under Duke Bogislaw I, in 1186. However the preface of the work, dedicated to Archbishop Anders Sunesen, mentions the Danish conquest of the areas north of the Elbe in 1208.

Book 14, comprising nearly one-quarter of the text of the entire work, ends with Absalon&#x27;s appointment to archbishop in 1178. Since this book is so large and &quot;Absalon&quot; has greater importance than King Valdemar I, this book may have been written first and comprised a work on its own. It is possible that Saxo then enlarged it with Books 15 and 16, telling the story of King Valdemar I&#x27;s last years and King Canute VI&#x27;s first years.

It is believed that Saxo then wrote Books 11, 12, and 13. Svend Aagesen&#x27;s history of Denmark, &quot;Brevis Historia Regum Dacie&quot; (circa 1186), states that Saxo had decided to write about &quot;The king-father and his sons,&quot; which would be King Sweyn Estridson, in Books 11, 12, and 13. He would later add the first ten books. This would also explain the 22 years between the last event described in the last book (Book 16) and the 1208 event described in the preface.

=== Manuscripts ===
The original manuscripts of the work are lost, except for four fragments: the Angers Fragment, Lassen Fragment, Kall-Rasmussen Fragment and Plesner Fragment. The Angers Fragment is the biggest fragment, and the only one attested to be in Saxo&#x27;s own handwriting. The other ones are copies from . All four fragments are in the collection of the Danish Royal Library in Copenhagen, Denmark.

The text has, however, survived. In 1510–1512, Christiern Pedersen, a Danish translator working in Paris, searched Denmark high and low for an existing copy of Saxo&#x27;s works, which by that time was nearly all but lost. By that time most knowledge of Saxo&#x27;s work came from a summary located in &quot;Chronica Jutensis&quot;, from around 1342, called &quot;Compendium Saxonis&quot;. It is also in this summary that the name is found. The title Saxo himself used for his work is unknown.

Christiern Pedersen finally found a copy in the collection of Archbishop Birger Gunnersen of Lund, Skåne (Skåne is now part of Sweden, but at the time was still part of Denmark), which he gladly lent him. With the help of printer Jodocus Badius, was refined and printed.

=== Printing ===

The first printed press publication and the oldest known complete text of Saxo&#x27;s works is Christiern Pedersen&#x27;s Latin edition, printed and published by Jodocus Badius in Paris, France, on 15 March 1514 under the title of &quot;Danorum Regum heroumque Historiae&quot; (&quot;History of the Kings and heroes of the Danes&quot;). The edition features the following colophon: ...&quot;impressit in inclyta Parrhisorum academia Iodocus Badius Ascensius Idibus Martiis. MDXIIII. Supputatione Romana.&quot; (the Ides of March, 1514).

The full front page reads (with abbreviations expanded) in Latin:
&quot;Danorum Regum heroumque Historiae stilo eleganti a Saxone Grammatico natione Zialandico necnon Roskildensis ecclesiae praeposito, abhinc supra trecentos annos conscriptae et nunc primum literaria serie illustratae tersissimeque impressae.&quot;

English language:
&quot;Histories of the Kings and heroes of the Danes, composed in elegant style by Saxo Grammaticus, a Zealander and also provost of the church of Roskilde, over three hundred years ago, and now for the first time illustrated and printed correctly in a learned compilation.&quot;

== Hamlet ==
Certain aspects of formed the basis for William Shakespeare&#x27;s play &quot;Hamlet&quot;. Saxo&#x27;s version, told of in Books 3 and 4, is very similar to that of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Hamlet&quot;. In Saxo&#x27;s version, two brothers, Orvendil and Fengi are given the rule over Jutland by King Rørik Slyngebond of the Danes. Soon after, Orvendil marries King Rørik&#x27;s daughter, Geruth (Gertrude in &quot;Hamlet&quot;). Amleth is their first and only child.

Fengi becomes resentful of his brother&#x27;s marriage, and also wants sole leadership of Jutland, so therefore murders Orvendil. After a very brief period of mourning, Fengi marries Geruth, and declares himself sole leader of Jutland. Eventually, Amleth avenges his father&#x27;s murder and plans the murder of his uncle, making him the new and rightful King of Jutland. However, while Hamlet dies in Shakespeare&#x27;s version just after his uncle&#x27;s death, in Saxo&#x27;s version Amleth survives and begins ruling his kingdom, going on to other adventures.

<text>Gary Edward &quot;Garrison&quot; Keillor (; born August 7, 1942) is an American author, singer, humorist, voice actor, and radio personality. He created the Minnesota Public Radio (MPR) show &quot;A Prairie Home Companion&quot; (called &quot;Garrison Keillor&#x27;s Radio Show&quot; in some international syndication), which he hosted from 1974 to 2016. Keillor created the fictional Minnesota town Lake Wobegon, the setting of many of his books, including &quot;Lake Wobegon Days &quot;and &quot;Leaving Home: A Collection of Lake Wobegon Stories&quot;. Other creations include Guy Noir, a detective voiced by Keillor who appeared in &quot;A Prairie Home Companion&quot; comic skits. Keillor is also the creator of the five-minute daily radio/podcast program &quot;The Writer&#x27;s Almanac&quot;, which pairs poems of his choice with a script about important literary, historical, and scientific events that coincided with that date in history.

In November 2017, Minnesota Public Radio cut all business ties with Keillor after an allegation of inappropriate behavior with a freelance writer for &quot;A Prairie Home Companion&quot;. Internal and external investigations by MPR concluded Keillor had engaged in dozens of sexually inappropriate incidents over a period of years, including unwanted sexual touching. On April 13, 2018, MPR and Keillor announced a settlement that allows archives of &quot;A Prairie Home Companion&quot; and &quot;The Writer&#x27;s Almanac&quot; to be publicly available again, and soon thereafter, Keillor began publishing new episodes of &quot;The Writer&#x27;s Almanac&quot; on his website. He also continues to tour a stage version of &quot;A Prairie Home Companion&quot;; these shows are not broadcast by MPR or American Public Media.

==Early life and education==

Keillor was born in Anoka, Minnesota, the son of Grace Ruth (&quot;née&quot; Denham) and John Philip Keillor. His father was a carpenter and postal worker of English ancestry; Keillor&#x27;s paternal grandfather was from Kingston, Ontario. His maternal grandparents were Scottish emigrants from Glasgow. He was the third of six children, with three brothers and two sisters.

Keillor&#x27;s family belonged to the Plymouth Brethren, an Evangelical Christian movement that he has since left. In 2006, he told &quot;Christianity Today&quot; that he was attending the St. John the Evangelist Episcopal church in Saint Paul, Minnesota, after previously attending a Lutheran church in New York.

Keillor graduated from Anoka High School in 1960 and from the University of Minnesota with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in English in 1966. During college, he began his broadcasting career on the student-operated radio station known today as Radio K.

In his 2004 book &quot;Homegrown Democrat: A Few Plain Thoughts from the Heart of America&quot;, Keillor mentions some of his noteworthy ancestors, including John Crandall, who was an associate of Roger Williams, who founded Rhode Island and the first American Baptist church; and Prudence Crandall, who founded the first African-American women&#x27;s school in America.

==Career==
===Radio===
Garrison Keillor started his professional radio career in November 1969 with Minnesota Educational Radio (MER), later Minnesota Public Radio (MPR), which today distributes programs under the American Public Media (APM) brand. He hosted a weekday drive-time broadcast called &quot;A Prairie Home Entertainment&quot;, on KSJR FM at St. John&#x27;s University in Collegeville. The show&#x27;s eclectic music was a major divergence from the station&#x27;s usual classical fare. During this time he submitted fiction to &quot;The New Yorker&quot; magazine, where his first story for that publication, &quot;Local Family Keeps Son Happy,&quot; appeared in September 1970.

Keillor resigned from &quot;The Morning Program&quot; in February 1971 in protest of what he considered interference with his musical programming; as part of his protest, he played nothing but the Beach Boys&#x27; &quot;Help Me, Rhonda&quot; during one broadcast. When he returned to the station in October, the show was dubbed &quot;A Prairie Home Companion&quot;.

Keillor has attributed the idea for the live Saturday night radio program to his 1973 assignment to write about the Grand Ole Opry for &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, but he had already begun showcasing local musicians on the morning show, despite limited studio space. In August 1973, MPR announced plans to broadcast a Saturday night version of &quot;A Prairie Home Companion&quot; with live musicians.

&quot;A Prairie Home Companion&quot; (&quot;PHC&quot;) debuted as an old-style variety show before a live audience on July 6, 1974; it featured guest musicians and a cadre cast doing musical numbers and comic skits replete with elaborate live sound effects. The show was punctuated by spoof commercial spots for &quot;PHC&quot; fictitious sponsors such as Powdermilk Biscuits, the Ketchup Advisory Board, and the Professional Organization of English Majors (POEM); it presented parodic serial melodramas, such as &quot;The Adventures of Guy Noir, Private Eye&quot; and &quot;The Lives of the Cowboys.&quot; Keillor voiced Noir, the cowboy Lefty, and other recurring characters, and provided lead or backup vocals for some of the show&#x27;s musical numbers. The show aired from the Fitzgerald Theater in St. Paul.

After the show&#x27;s intermission, Keillor read clever and often humorous greetings to friends and family at home submitted by members of the theater audience in exchange for an honorarium. Also in the second half of the show, Keillor delivered a monologue called &quot;The News from Lake Wobegon&quot;, a fictitious town based in part on Keillor&#x27;s hometown of Anoka, Minnesota, and on Freeport and other small towns in Stearns County, Minnesota, where he lived in the early 1970s. Lake Wobegon is a quintessentially Minnesota small town characterized by the narrator as a place &quot;... where all the women are strong, all the men are good-looking, and all the children are above average.&quot;
The original &quot;PHC&quot; ran until 1987, when Keillor ended it to focus on other projects. In 1989, he launched a new live radio program from New York City, &quot;The American Radio Company of the Air&quot;, which had essentially the same format as &quot;PHC&quot;. In 1992, he moved ARC back to St. Paul, and a year later changed the name back to &quot;A Prairie Home Companion&quot;; it remained a fixture of Saturday night radio broadcasting for decades.

On a typical broadcast of &quot;A Prairie Home Companion&quot;, Keillor&#x27;s name was not mentioned unless a guest addressed him by name, although some sketches featured Keillor as his alter ego, Carson Wyler. In the closing credits, which Keillor read, he gave himself no billing or credit except &quot;written by Sarah Bellum,&quot; a joking reference to his own brain.

Keillor regularly took the radio company on the road to broadcast from popular venues around the United States; the touring production typically featured local celebrities and skits incorporating local color. In April 2000, he took the program to Edinburgh, Scotland, producing two performances in the city&#x27;s Queen&#x27;s Hall, which were broadcast by BBC Radio. He toured Scotland with the program to celebrate its 25th anniversary. (In the UK, Ireland, Australia, and New Zealand, the program is known as &quot;Garrison Keillor&#x27;s Radio Show&quot;.) Keillor produced broadcast performances similar to &quot;PHC&quot; but without the &quot;Prairie Home Companion&quot; brand, as in his 2008 appearance at the Oregon Bach Festival. He was also the host of &quot;The Writer&#x27;s Almanac,&quot; from 1993 to 2017, which, like &quot;PHC&quot;, was produced and distributed by American Public Media.

In a March 2011 interview, Keillor announced that he would be retiring from &quot;A Prairie Home Companion&quot; in 2013; but in a December 2011 interview with the &quot;Sioux City Journal&quot;, Keillor said: &quot;The show is going well. I love doing it. Why quit?&quot; During an interview on July 20, 2015, Keillor announced his intent to retire from the show after the 2015–2016 season, saying, &quot;I have a lot of other things that I want to do. I mean, nobody retires anymore. Writers never retire. But this is my last season. This tour this summer is the farewell tour.&quot;

Keillor&#x27;s final episode of the show was recorded live for an audience of 18,000 fans at the Hollywood Bowl in California on July 1, 2016, and broadcast the next day, ending 42 seasons of the show. After the performance, President Barack Obama phoned Keillor to congratulate him. The show continued on October 15, 2016, with Chris Thile as its host.

==== Separation from MPR ====
On November 29, 2017, the &quot;Star Tribune&quot; reported that Minnesota Public Radio was terminating all business relationships with Keillor as a result of &quot;allegations of his inappropriate behavior with an individual who worked with him.&quot; In January 2018, MPR CEO Jon McTaggart elaborated that they had received allegations of &quot;dozens&quot; of sexually inappropriate incidents from the individual, including requests for sexual contact. Keillor denied any wrongdoing and said his firing stems from an incident when he touched a woman&#x27;s bare back while trying to console her. He said he had apologized to her soon after, that they had already made up, and that he was surprised to hear the allegations when her lawyer called.

In its statement of termination, MPR announced that Keillor would keep his executive credit for the show, but that since he owns the trademark for the phrase &quot;prairie home companion&quot;, they would cease rebroadcasting episodes of &quot;A Prairie Home Companion&quot; featuring Keillor and remove the trademarked phrase from the radio show hosted by Chris Thile. MPR also eliminated its business connections to PrairieHome.org and stopped distributing Keillor&#x27;s daily program &quot;The Writer&#x27;s Almanac&quot;. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; also canceled Keillor&#x27;s weekly column when they learned he had continued writing columns, including a controversial piece criticizing Al Franken&#x27;s resignation because of sexual misconduct allegations, without revealing that he was under investigation at MPR.

Several fans wrote MPR to protest Keillor&#x27;s firing, but only 153 members canceled their memberships because of it. In January 2018, Keillor announced he was in mediation with MPR over the firing. On January 23, 2018, MPR News reported further on the investigation after interviewing almost 60 people who had worked with Keillor. The story described other alleged sexual misconduct by Keillor, and a $16,000 severance check for a woman who was asked to sign a confidentiality agreement to prevent her from talking about her time at MPR (she refused and never deposited the check).

==== Settlement and access to archived shows ====
Keillor received a letter from the MPR CEO, Jon McTaggart, dated April 5, 2018, confirming that both sides wanted archives of &quot;A Prairie Home Companion&quot; and &quot;The Writer&#x27;s Almanac&quot; to be publicly available again. In April 2018, MPR and Keillor announced a settlement under which MPR would restore the online archives.

==== &quot;Finding Your Roots&quot; segment ====
Also due to the allegations of inappropriate behavior, Keillor&#x27;s segment in the PBS series &quot;Finding Your Roots&quot; episode that aired on December 19, 2017, was replaced by an older segment featuring Maya Rudolph.

===Writing===
At age 13, Keillor adopted the pen name &quot;Garrison&quot; to distinguish his personal life from his professional writing. He commonly uses &quot;Garrison&quot; in public and in other media.

Keillor has been called &quot;[o]ne of the most perceptive and witty commentators about Midwestern life&quot; by Randall Balmer in &quot;Encyclopedia of Evangelicalism.&quot; He has written numerous magazine and newspaper articles and more than a dozen books for adults as well as children. In addition to writing for &quot;The New Yorker,&quot; he has written for &quot;The Atlantic Monthly&quot; and &quot;National Geographic.&quot; He has also written for Salon.com and authored an advice column there under the name &quot;Mr. Blue.&quot; Following a heart operation, he resigned on September 4, 2001, his last column being titled &quot;Every dog has his day&quot;:

In 2004, Keillor published a collection of political essays, &quot;Homegrown Democrat: A Few Plain Thoughts from the Heart of America,&quot; and in June 2005 he began a column called &quot;The Old Scout&quot;, which ran at Salon.com and in syndicated newspapers. The column went on hiatus in April 2010 so that he could &quot;finish a screenplay and start writing a novel.&quot;

===Bookselling===

On November 1, 2006, Keillor opened an independent bookstore, &quot;Common Good Books, G. Keillor, Prop.&quot; in the Blair Arcade Building at the southwest corner of Selby and N. Western Avenues in the Cathedral Hill area in the Summit-University neighborhood of Saint Paul, Minnesota.

In April 2012, the store moved to a new location on Snelling Avenue across from Macalester College in the Macalester-Groveland neighborhood. In April 2019, Keillor sold his interest in the bookstore. The store was renamed Next Chapter and is in the same location.

===Voice-over work===
Probably owing in part to his distinctive North-Central accent, Keillor is often used as a voice-over actor. Some notable appearances include:
* Voiceover artist for Honda UK&#x27;s &quot;the Power of Dreams&quot; campaign. The campaign&#x27;s most memorable advertisement is the 2003 Honda Accord commercial &quot;Cog&quot;, which features a Heath Robinson contraption (or Rube Goldberg Machine) made entirely of car parts. The commercial ends with Keillor asking, &quot;Isn&#x27;t it nice when things just work?&quot; Since then, Keillor has voiced the tagline for most if not all UK Honda advertisements, and even sang the voiceover in the 2004 Honda Diesel commercial &quot;Grrr&quot;. His most recent ad was a reworking of an existing commercial with digitally added England flags to tie in with the World Cup. Keillor&#x27;s tagline was &quot;Come on, England, keep the dream alive.&quot;
* Voice of the Norse god Odin in an episode of the Disney animated series &quot;&quot;
* Voice of Walt Whitman and other historical figures in Ken Burns&#x27;s documentary series &quot;The Civil War&quot; and &quot;Baseball&quot;
* Narrator of &quot;River of Dreams&quot; Documentary at the National Mississippi River Museum and Aquarium in Dubuque, Iowa
* In 1991, Keillor released &quot;Songs of the Cat,&quot; an album of original and parody songs about cats.

=== Film ===
In 2006, Keillor wrote and portrayed himself in the musical comedy film &quot;A Prairie Home Companion&quot;, directed by Robert Altman. It is a fictional representation of behind-the-scenes activities at the long-running public radio show of the same name. The film received mostly positive reviews and was a moderate box-office success on a small budget. It features an ensemble cast including Woody Harrelson, Tommy Lee Jones, Kevin Kline, Lindsay Lohan, Virginia Madsen, John C. Reilly, Maya Rudolph, Meryl Streep, and Lily Tomlin.

==Reception==
In &quot;Slate&quot;, Sam Anderson called Keillor &quot;very clearly a genius. His range and stamina alone are incredible—after 30 years, he rarely repeats himself—and he has the genuine wisdom of a Cosby or Mark Twain.&quot; But Keillor&#x27;s &quot;willful simplicity,&quot; Anderson wrote, &quot;is annoying because, after a while, it starts to feel prescriptive. Being a responsible adult doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean speaking slowly about tomatoes.&quot; Anderson also noted that in 1985, when &quot;Time&quot; magazine called Keillor the funniest man in America, Bill Cosby said, &quot;That&#x27;s true if you&#x27;re a pilgrim.&quot;

===In popular culture===
Keillor&#x27;s style, particularly his speaking voice, has often been parodied.
*&quot;The Simpsons&quot; parodied him in an episode in which the family is shown watching a Keillor-like monologist on television; they are perplexed at why the studio audience is laughing so much, prompting Homer to ask &quot;What the hell&#x27;s so funny?&quot; and Bart to suggest &quot;Maybe it&#x27;s the TV.&quot; Homer then hits the set, exclaiming: &quot;Stupid TV! Be more funny!&quot;
*On the November 19, 2011, episode of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, cast member Bill Hader impersonated Keillor in a sketch depicting celebrities auditioning to replace Regis Philbin as co-host of &quot;Live! with Kelly&quot;.
*One Boston radio critic likens Keillor and his &quot;down-comforter voice&quot; to &quot;a hypnotist intoning, &#x27;You are getting sleepy now&#x27;,&quot; while noting that Keillor does play to listeners&#x27; intelligence.
*Pennsylvanian singer-songwriter Tom Flannery wrote a song in 2003 titled &quot;I Want a Job Like Garrison Keillor&#x27;s.&quot;
*Two parody books by &quot;Harrison Geillor&quot;: &quot;The Zombies of Lake Woebegotten&quot; and &quot;The Twilight of Lake Woebegotten&quot;, were published by Night Shade Books in 2010 and 2011.

==Personal life==

Keillor is a member of the Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party. He is tall. He considers himself a loner and prefers not to make eye contact with people. Though not formally diagnosed, he also considers himself to be on the high-functioning end of the autism spectrum. He spoke about his experiences as an autistic person in his keynote address at the 19th Annual Minnesota Autism Conference in 2014.

Keillor has been married three times. He was married to Mary Guntzel from 1965 to 1976; they had one son. He was married to Ulla Skaerved, a former exchange student from Denmark at Keillor&#x27;s high school whom he re-encountered at a class reunion, from 1985 to 1990. He married classical string player Jenny Lind Nilsson (born 1957), who is also from Anoka, in 1995. They have one daughter.

Between his first and second marriages, Keillor was romantically involved with Margaret Moos, who worked as a producer of &quot;A Prairie Home Companion&quot;.

On September 7, 2009, Keillor was briefly hospitalized after suffering a minor stroke. He returned to work a few days later.

In 2006, after a visit to a United Methodist church in Highland Park, Texas, Keillor created a local controversy with his remarks about the event, including the rhetorical suggestion of a connection between event participants and supporters of torture and a statement creating an impression of political intimidation: &quot;I walked in, was met by two burly security men ... and within 10 minutes was told by three people that this was the Bushes&#x27; church and that it would be better if I didn&#x27;t talk about politics.&quot; In response, the lecture series coordinator said the two &quot;burly security men&quot; were a local policeman and the church&#x27;s own security supervisor, both present because the agreement with Keillor&#x27;s publisher specified that the venue provide security. In addition, the coordinator said that Keillor arrived at the church, declined an introduction, and took the stage without an opportunity to mingle with the audience, so he did not know when these warnings might have been dispensed. The publicist concurred, saying that Keillor did not have contact with any church members or people in the audience before he spoke.

Supposedly, before Keillor&#x27;s remarks, participants at the event had considered the visit cordial and warm. Asked to respond, Keillor stuck to his story, describing the people who advised him not to discuss politics and saying he had no security guards at other stops on the tour.

In 2007, Keillor wrote a column that in part criticized &quot;stereotypical&quot; gay parents, who he said were &quot;sardonic fellows with fussy hair who live in over-decorated apartments with a striped sofa and a small weird dog and who worship campy performers.&quot; In response to the strong reactions of many readers, Keillor said:

In 2008, Keillor created a controversy in St. Paul when he filed a lawsuit against his neighbor&#x27;s plan to build an addition on her home, citing his need for &quot;light and air&quot; and a view of &quot;open space and beyond&quot;. Keillor&#x27;s home is significantly larger than others in his neighborhood and it would still be significantly larger than his neighbor&#x27;s with its planned addition. Keillor came to an undisclosed settlement with his neighbor shortly after the story became public.

In 2009, one of Keillor&#x27;s &quot;Old Scout&quot; columns contained a reference to &quot;lousy holiday songs by Jewish guys&quot; and a complaint about &quot;Silent Night&quot; as rewritten by Unitarians, upsetting some readers. A Unitarian minister named Cynthia Landrum responded, &quot;Listening to him talk about us over the years, it&#x27;s becoming more and more evident that he isn&#x27;t laughing with us—he&#x27;s laughing at us&quot;, while Jeff Jacoby of &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; called Keillor &quot;cranky and intolerant&quot;.

<text>Galatia (; , &quot;Galatía&quot;) was an ancient area in the highlands of central Anatolia, roughly corresponding to the provinces of Ankara and Eskişehir in modern Turkey. Galatia was named after the Gauls from Thrace (cf. Tylis), who settled here and became a small transient foreign tribe in the 3rd century BC, following the Gallic invasion of the Balkans in 279 BC. It has been called the &quot;Gallia&quot; of the East.

==Geography==
Galatia was bounded to the north by Bithynia and Paphlagonia, to the east by Pontus and Cappadocia, to the south by Cilicia and Lycaonia, and to the west by Phrygia. Its capital was Ancyra (i.e. Ankara, today the capital of modern Turkey).
==Celtic Galatia==
The terms &quot;Galatians&quot; came to be used by the Greeks for the three Celtic peoples of Anatolia: the Tectosages, the Trocmii, and the Tolistobogii. By the 1st century BC, the Celts had become so Hellenized that some Greek writers called them &quot;Hellenogalatai&quot; (Ἑλληνογαλάται). The Romans called them &quot;Gallograeci&quot;. Though the Celts had, to a large extent, integrated into Hellenistic Asia Minor, they preserved their linguistic and ethnic identity.

By the 4th century BC, the Celts had penetrated into the Balkans, coming into contact with the Thracians and Greeks. In 380 BC, they fought in the southern regions of Dalmatia (present day Croatia), and rumors circulated around the ancient world that Alexander the Great″s father, Philip II of Macedonia had been assassinated by someone using a dagger of Celtic origins. Arrian writes that &quot;Celts established on the Ionic coast&quot; were among those who came to meet Alexander the Great during a campaign against the Getae in 335 BC. Several ancient accounts mention that the Celts formed an alliance with Dionysius I of Syracuse who sent them to fight alongside the Macedonians against the Thebans. In 279 BC, two Celtic factions united under the leadership of Brennus and began to push southwards from southern Bulgaria towards the Greek states. According to Livy, a sizable force split off from this main group and headed toward Asia Minor.
For several years, a federation of Hellespontine cities, including Byzantion and Chalkedon, prevented the Celts from entering Asia Minor. During the course of the power struggle between Nikomedes I of Bithynia and his brother Zipoetes, the former hired 20,000 Galatian mercenaries. The Galatians split into two groups headed by Leonnorius and Lutarius, which crossed the Bosporus and the Hellespont, respectively. In 277 BC, when the hostilities had ended the Galatians came out of Nikomedes&#x27; control and began raiding Greek cities in Asia Minor while Antiochus was solidifying his rule in Syria. The Galatians looted Cyzikus, Ilion, Didyma, Priene, Thyatira and Laodicea on the Lycus, while the citizens of Erythras paid them ransom. Either in 275 or 269 BC, Antiochus&#x27; army faced the Galatians somewhere on the plain of Sardis in the Battle of Elephants. In the aftermath of the battle, the Celts then settled in northern Phrygia, a region that eventually came to be known as Galatia.

The territory of Celtic Galatia included the cities of Ancyra (present day Ankara), Pessinus, Tavium, and Gordion.

==Roman Galatia==

Upon the death of Deiotarus, the Kingdom of Galatia was given to Amyntas, an auxiliary commander in the Roman army of Brutus and Cassius who gained the favor of Mark Antony. After his death in 25 BC, Galatia was incorporated by Augustus into the Roman Empire, becoming a Roman province. Near his capital Ancyra (modern Ankara), Pylamenes, the king&#x27;s heir, rebuilt a temple of the Phrygian god Men to venerate Augustus (the Monumentum Ancyranum), as a sign of fidelity. It was on the walls of this temple in Galatia that the major source for the &quot;Res Gestae&quot; of Augustus were preserved for modernity. Few of the provinces proved more enthusiastically loyal to Rome.

Josephus related the Biblical figure Gomer to Galatia (or perhaps to Gaul in general): &quot;For Gomer founded those whom the Greeks now call Galatians, [Galls], but were then called Gomerites.&quot; Others have related Gomer to Cimmerians.

Paul the Apostle visited Galatia in his missionary journeys, and wrote to the Christians there in the Epistle to the Galatians.

Although originally possessing a strong cultural identity, by the 2nd century AD, the Galatians had become assimilated (Hellenization) into the Hellenistic civilization of Anatolia. The Galatians were still speaking the Galatian language in the time of St. Jerome (347–420 AD), who wrote that the Galatians of Ancyra and the Treveri of Trier (in what is now the Rhineland) spoke the same language (&quot;Comentarii in Epistolam ad Galatos&quot;, 2.3, composed c. 387).

In an administrative reorganisation (&quot;c.&quot; 386–395), two new provinces succeeded it, &quot;Galatia Prima&quot; and &quot;Galatia Secunda&quot; or &quot;Salutaris&quot;, which included part of Phrygia. The fate of the Galatian people is a subject of some uncertainty, but they seem ultimately to have been absorbed into the Greek-speaking populations of Anatolia.

<doc id="12746" wikidata="Q170084" url="?curid=12746" title="Generalization">
<text>A generalization is a form of abstraction whereby common properties of specific instances are formulated as general concepts or claims. Generalizations posit the existence of a domain or set of elements, as well as one or more common characteristics shared by those elements (thus creating a conceptual model). As such, they are the essential basis of all valid deductive inferences (particularly in logic, mathematics and science), where the process of verification is necessary to determine whether a generalization holds true for any given situation.

Generalization can also be used to refer to the process of identifying the parts of a whole, as belonging to the whole. The parts, which might be unrelated when left on their own, may be brought together as a group, hence belonging to the whole by establishing a common relation between them.

However, the parts cannot be generalized into a whole—until a common relation is established among &quot;all&quot; parts. This does not mean that the parts are unrelated, only that no common relation has been established yet for the generalization.

The concept of generalization has broad application in many connected disciplines, and might sometimes have a more specific meaning in a specialized context (e.g. generalization in psychology, generalization in learning). 

In general, given two related concepts &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B,&quot; &quot;A&quot; is a &quot;generalization&quot; of &quot;B&quot; (equiv., &quot;B&quot; is a special case of &quot;A&quot;) if and only if both of the following hold:

* Every instance of concept &quot;B&quot; is also an instance of concept &quot;A.&quot;
* There are instances of concept &quot;A&quot; which are not instances of concept &quot;B&quot;.

For example, the concept &quot;animal&quot; is a generalization of the concept &quot;bird&quot;, since every bird is an animal, but not all animals are birds (dogs, for instance). For more, see Specialisation (biology).

==Hypernym and hyponym==

The connection of &quot;generalization&quot; to &quot;specialization&quot; (or &quot;particularization&quot;) is reflected in the contrasting words hypernym and hyponym. A hypernym as a generic stands for a class or group of equally ranked items, such as the term &quot;tree&quot; which stands for equally ranked items such as &quot;peach&quot; and &quot;oak&quot;, and the term &quot;ship&quot; which stands for equally ranked items such as &quot;cruiser&quot; and &quot;steamer&quot;. In contrast, a hyponym is one of the items included in the generic, such as &quot;peach&quot; and &quot;oak&quot; which are included in &quot;tree&quot;, and &quot;cruiser&quot; and &quot;steamer&quot; which are included in &quot;ship&quot;. A hypernym is superordinate to a hyponym, and a hyponym is subordinate to a hypernym.

==Examples==

===Biological generalization===

An animal is a generalization of a mammal, a bird, a fish, an amphibian and a reptile.

===Cartographic generalization of geo-spatial data===

Generalization has a long history in cartography as an art of creating maps for different scale and purpose. Cartographic generalization is the process of selecting and representing information of a map in a way that adapts to the scale of the display medium of the map. In this way, every map has, to some extent, been generalized to match the criteria of display. This includes small cartographic scale maps, which cannot convey every detail of the real world. As a result, cartographers must decide and then adjust the content within their maps, to create a suitable and useful map that conveys the geospatial information within their representation of the world.

Generalization is meant to be context-specific. That is to say, correctly generalized maps are those that emphasize the most important map elements, while still representing the world in the most faithful and recognizable way. The level of detail and importance in what is remaining on the map must outweigh the insignificance of items that were generalized—so as to preserve the distinguishing characteristics of what makes the map useful and important.

===Mathematical generalizations===
In mathematics, one commonly says that a concept or a result is a &quot;generalization&quot; of if is defined or proved before (historically or conceptually) and is a special case of .

* The complex numbers are a generalization of the real numbers, which are a generalization of the rational numbers, which are a generalization of the integers, which are a generalization of the natural numbers.
* A polygon is a generalization of a 3-sided triangle, a 4-sided quadrilateral, and so on to &quot;n&quot; sides. 
* A hypercube is a generalization of a 2-dimensional square, a 3-dimensional cube, and so on to &quot;n&quot; dimensions.
* A quadric, such as a hypersphere, ellipsoid, paraboloid, or hyperboloid, is a generalization of a conic section to higher dimensions.
* A Taylor series is a generalization of a MacLaurin series.
* The binomial formula is a generalization of the formula for formula_1.
* A ring is a generalization of a field.

<doc id="12747" wikidata="Q230824" url="?curid=12747" title="Gia Carangi">
<text>Gia Marie Carangi (January 29, 1960November 18, 1986) was an American supermodel, considered by some to be the first supermodel. In 2023, Harpers Bazaar ranked her 15th among the greatest supermodels in the 1980s. She was featured on the cover of numerous magazines, including multiple editions of &quot;Vogue&quot; and &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot;, and appeared in advertising campaigns for fashion houses including Armani, Dior, Versace and Yves Saint Laurent.

After Carangi became addicted to heroin, her career rapidly declined, which ultimately led her to quit modeling in 1983. In 1986, at age 26, she died of AIDS-related complications. Believed to have contracted it from a contaminated needle, she became one of the early notable women to die of the virus. Her life was dramatized in the television film &quot;Gia&quot; (1998), directed by Michael Cristofer and starring Angelina Jolie as Carangi.

==Early life==

Carangi was born on January 29, 1960, in Philadelphia, the third and youngest child of Joseph Carangi, a restaurant owner, and Kathleen Carangi (&quot;née&quot; Adams), a homemaker. She had three older brothers, one of them was from her father&#x27;s previous marriage and one younger half-brother. Her father was Italian, and her mother was of Irish and Welsh ancestry. Joseph and Kathleen had an unstable, violent marriage, ultimately leading Kathleen to abandon the family when Carangi was eleven years old. Gia was described as &quot;needy and manipulative&quot; by relatives who recalled her as spoiled and shy as a child and a &quot;mommy&#x27;s girl&quot; who did not receive the motherly attention that she desired. Those who knew Gia blamed her &quot;fractured childhood&quot; for the instability and drug dependence that plagued her adult life. Carangi was sexually abused when she was 5 years old, an event which traumatized her.

In her adolescent years, Carangi found the attention she sought from other teenage girls, befriending them by sending flowers. While attending Abraham Lincoln High School, Carangi bonded with &quot;the Bowie kids&quot;, a group of obsessive David Bowie fans who emulated Bowie&#x27;s &quot;defiantly weird, high-glam&quot; style. Carangi was drawn to Bowie for his fashion preferences and his ambiguous gender play and outspoken bisexuality. One of Carangi&#x27;s friends later spoke of her &quot;tomboy persona&quot;, describing her relaxed openness about her sexuality as reminiscent of the character Cay in the film &quot;Desert Hearts&quot; (1985). Carangi and her &quot;bi-try Bowie-mad&quot; friends hung out in Philadelphia&#x27;s gay clubs and bars. Though she&#x27;s associated with the lesbian community, she did not want to take up &quot;the accepted lesbian style.&quot;

==Career==
After being featured in Philadelphia newspaper ads and being discovered by Sondra Scerca in Maurice Tannenbaum&#x27;s hair salon, Carangi moved to New York City at the age of 17, where she signed with Wilhelmina Models. Her first major shoot, published in October 1978, was with top fashion photographer Chris von Wangenheim, who had her pose nude behind a chain-link fence with makeup artist Sandy Linter. Carangi immediately became infatuated with Linter and pursued her, though the relationship never became stable. By the end of 1978, her first year in New York, Carangi was already a well-established model. Of her quick rise to prominence, described by &quot;Vogue&quot; as &quot;meteoric&quot;, Carangi later said, &quot;I started working with very good people, I mean all the time, very fast. I didn&#x27;t build into a model, I just sort of became one.&quot; Carangi was earning half a million dollars in a year at the height of her career.

Carangi was a favorite model of various fashion photographers, including Von Wangenheim, Francesco Scavullo, Arthur Elgort, Richard Avedon and Denis Piel. Well-integrated within the fashion world, she had the selection of several photographers, most notably Scavullo. Carangi was featured on the cover of many fashion magazines, including the April 1979 issue of &quot;British Vogue&quot;, the April 1979 and August 1980 issues of &quot;Vogue Paris&quot;, the August 1980 issue of &quot;Vogue&quot;, the February 1981 issue of &quot;Vogue Italia&quot;, and multiple issues of &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot; between 1979 and 1982. During these years, she also appeared in various advertising campaigns for high-profile fashion houses, including Armani, André Laug, Christian Dior, Versace, and Yves Saint Laurent. At the height of her career, Carangi was most known in modeling circles by only her first name. During this time, she also appeared in the Blondie music video for the single &quot;Atomic&quot;.

A regular at Studio 54 and the Mudd Club, Carangi usually used cocaine in clubs. After her agent, mentor and friend Wilhelmina Cooper, died of lung cancer in March 1980, a devastated Carangi began using drugs and developed an addiction to heroin. Carangi&#x27;s addiction soon began to affect her work; she had violent temper tantrums, walked out of photo shoots to buy drugs, and fell asleep in front of the camera. Scavullo recalled a fashion shoot with Carangi in the Caribbean when &quot;she was crying, she couldn&#x27;t find her drugs. I literally had to lay her down on her bed until she fell asleep.&quot; During one of her final location shoots for American &quot;Vogue&quot;, Carangi had red bumps in the crooks of her elbows where she had injected heroin. Despite airbrushing, some of the photos, as published in the November 1980 issue, reportedly still showed visible needle marks.

In November 1980, Carangi left Wilhelmina Models and signed with Ford Models, but she was dropped within weeks. By then, her career was in a steep decline. Modeling offers soon ceased and her fashion industry friends, including Sandy Linter, refused to speak to her, fearing their association with her would harm their careers. In an attempt to quit using drugs, she moved back to Philadelphia with her mother and stepfather in February 1981. Carangi underwent a 21-day detox program, but her sobriety was short-lived. She was arrested in March 1981 after she drove into a fence in a suburban neighborhood. After a chase with police, she was taken into custody where it was later determined she was under the influence of alcohol and cocaine. After her release, Carangi briefly signed with a new agency, Legends, and worked sporadically, mainly in Europe.

In late 1981, although still using drugs, Carangi was determined to make a comeback in the fashion industry and signed with Elite Model Management. While some clients refused to work with her, others were willing to hire her because of her past status as a top model. Scavullo photographed her for the April 1982 cover of &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot;, her last cover appearance for an American magazine. Sean Byrnes, Scavullo&#x27;s long-time assistant, later said, &quot;What she was doing to herself finally became apparent in her pictures. ... I could see the change in her beauty. There was an emptiness in her eyes.&quot;

Carangi then mainly worked with photographer Albert Watson and found work modeling for department stores and catalogs. She appeared in an advertising campaign for &quot;Versace&quot;, shot by Richard Avedon. He hired her for the fashion house&#x27;s next campaign, but during the photo shoot, in late 1982, Carangi became uncomfortable and left before any usable shots of her were taken. Around this time, Carangi enrolled in an outpatient methadone program but soon began using heroin again. By the end of 1982, she had only a few clients that were willing to hire her. Carangi&#x27;s final photo shoot was for German mail-order clothing company Otto GmbH in Tunisia; she was sent home during the shoot for using heroin. She left New York for the final time in early 1983.

==Death==
Carangi spent most of her modeling earnings on drugs, and spent the final three years of her life with various lovers, friends, and family members in Philadelphia and Atlantic City, New Jersey. She was admitted to an intense drug treatment program at Eagleville Hospital in December 1984. She was in intense therapy and was able to stay sober for 7 months. After treatment, she got a job in a clothing store, which she eventually quit. She later found employment as a checkout clerk and then worked in the cafeteria of a nursing home. By late 1985, she had begun using drugs again and was engaging in prostitution in Atlantic City. She had cancelled the meetings with her therapist, bought as much heroin as she could, and attempted suicide but failed.

In December 1985, Carangi was admitted to Warminster General Hospital in Warminster, Pennsylvania with bilateral pneumonia. A few days later, she was diagnosed with AIDS-related complex. Carangi was hospitalized in October 1986, feeling weak. On October 18, she was admitted to Hahnemann University Hospital in Philadelphia. Carangi died at the Hahnemann Hospital of AIDS-related complications one month later, on November 18, 1986, at the age of 26. Her funeral was held on November 23 at a small funeral home in Philadelphia. No one from the fashion world attended. However, weeks later, fashion photographer Francesco Scavullo, Carangi&#x27;s friend and confidant, sent a Mass card when he learned of her death.

==Filmography==
==Legacy==
Carangi&#x27;s rise to fame as an androgynous brunette in an industry full of blue-eyed blondes is believed to have started heroin chic. Carangi is often considered to be the first supermodel, although that title has been applied to others, including Margaux Hemingway, Audrey Munson, Lisa Fonssagrives, Dorian Leigh, Twiggy, Jean Shrimpton, Cheryl Tiegs and Janice Dickinson. Model Cindy Crawford, who rose to prominence the year Carangi died, was referred to as &quot;Baby Gia&quot; because of her resemblance to Carangi. Crawford later recalled, &quot;My agents took me to all the photographers who liked Gia: Albert Watson, Francesco Scavullo, Bill King. Everyone loved her look so much that they gladly saw me.&quot; Additionally, Carangi, whose sexual orientation has been reported as either lesbian or bisexual, is considered a lesbian icon and is said to have &quot;epitomized lesbian chic more than a decade before the term was coined.&quot; Argentine model Mica Argañaraz has often been compared to Carangi, whom she considers a beauty icon.

Carangi&#x27;s life has been the subject of several works. A biography of Carangi by Stephen Fried titled &quot;Thing of Beauty&quot;—taken from the first line of John Keats&#x27; famous poem &quot;Endymion&quot;—was published in 1993. &quot;Gia&quot;, a biographical film starring Angelina Jolie, debuted on HBO in 1998. Jolie won a Golden Globe Award and a Screen Actors Guild Award for her performance, among other accolades. A documentary titled &quot;The Self-Destruction of Gia&quot;, released in 2003, showcased footage of Carangi, contemporary interviews with Carangi&#x27;s family and former colleagues, including Sandy Linter, and footage of actress-screenwriter Zoë Lund, herself a heroin addict, who had been commissioned to write a screenplay based upon Carangi&#x27;s life at the time of her own death of drug-related causes in 1999.

Carangi is commemorated on the AIDS Memorial Quilt on block #5949, block #3505, and block #4113

<doc id="12750" wikidata="Q7311" url="?curid=12750" title="Giacomo Puccini">
<text>Giacomo Puccini (22 December 1858 29 November 1924) was an Italian composer known primarily for his operas. Regarded as the greatest and most successful proponent of Italian opera after Verdi, he was descended from a long line of composers, stemming from the late Baroque era. Though his early work was firmly rooted in traditional late-nineteenth-century Romantic Italian opera, it later developed in the realistic &quot;verismo&quot; style, of which he became one of the leading exponents.

His most renowned works are &quot;La bohème&quot; (1896), &quot;Tosca&quot; (1900), &quot;Madama Butterfly&quot; (1904), and the unfinished &quot;Turandot&quot; (posthumously completed by Franco Alfano), all of which are among the most frequently performed and recorded in the entirety of the operatic repertoire.

==Family and education==
Born in Lucca in the Grand Duchy of Tuscany, in 1858; he was the sixth of nine children of Michele Puccini (1813–1864) and Albina Magi (1830–1884). The Puccini family was established in Lucca as a local musical dynasty by Puccini&#x27;s great-great-grandfather – also named Giacomo (1712–1781). This first Giacomo Puccini, though often referred to as Jacopo, was &quot;maestro di cappella&quot; of the Cattedrale di San Martino in Lucca. He was succeeded in this position by his son, Antonio Puccini, and then by Antonio&#x27;s son Domenico, and then his son, Michele. Each Puccini studied music at Bologna, and some took additional musical studies elsewhere. Domenico Puccini studied for a time under Giovanni Paisiello. Each composed music for the church. In addition, Domenico composed several operas, and Michele composed one opera. Puccini&#x27;s father Michele enjoyed a reputation throughout northern Italy, and his funeral was an occasion of public mourning, at which the then-famed composer Giovanni Pacini conducted a Requiem.

With the Puccini family having occupied the position of &quot;maestro di cappella&quot; for 124 years (1740–1864) by the time of Michele&#x27;s death, it was anticipated that Michele&#x27;s son Giacomo would occupy that position as well when he was old enough. However, when Michele Puccini died in 1864, Giacomo was only six years old and thus incapable of assuming his father&#x27;s post. As a child, he nevertheless participated in the musical life of the Cattedrale di San Martino, as a member of the boys&#x27; choir, and later as a substitute organist.

Puccini received a general education at the San Michele seminary in Lucca, and then at the seminary of the cathedral. One of Puccini&#x27;s uncles, Fortunato Magi, supervised his musical education. In 1880 Puccini achieved a diploma from Lucca&#x27;s Pacini School of Music, having studied there with Magi, and later with Carlo Angeloni, who had also instructed Alfredo Catalani. A grant from Queen Margherita, and assistance from another uncle, Nicholas Cerù, provided the funds necessary for Puccini to continue his studies at the Milan Conservatory for a further three years; there, he studied composition with Stefano Ronchetti-Monteviti, Amilcare Ponchielli, Amintore Galli, and Antonio Bazzini. He shared his dorm with Pietro Mascagni. Later that year, Puccini composed his &quot;Mass&quot;, marking the culmination of his family&#x27;s long association with liturgical music in his native Lucca.

==Early career and first operas==
As a thesis piece for the Milan Conservatory, Puccini composed the orchestral &quot;Capriccio sinfonico&quot; (&quot;Symphonic caprice&quot;). Puccini&#x27;s teachers, Ponchielli and Bazzini were impressed by the work, and it was performed at a student concert at the conservatory on 14 July 1883, conducted by Franco Faccio. The &quot;Capriccio&quot; was favourably reviewed in the Milanese publication &quot;La Perseveranza&quot;, and thus Puccini began to build a reputation as a young composer of promise in Milanese music circles.

===&quot;Le Villi&quot;===
Following the première of the &quot;Capriccio sinfonico&quot;, Ponchielli and Puccini discussed the possibility that Puccini&#x27;s next work might be an opera. Ponchielli invited Puccini to stay at his villa, where Puccini was introduced to Ferdinando Fontana. They agreed to collaborate on an opera, for which Fontana would provide the libretto. Puccini submitted the work, titled (&#x27;The Fairies&#x27;), for &#x27;s first of four musical competitions, advertised in April 1883, for a new, unperformed opera &quot;inspired by the best traditions of Italian opera&quot;, which could be &quot;idyllic, serious, or comic&quot;, to be judged by a panel including Galli and Ponchielli. Puccini&#x27;s submission was disqualified because its manuscript was illegible; the second competition, in 1889, was notably won by Mascagni&#x27;s &quot;Cavalleria rusticana&quot;.

Despite the defeat in the competition, &quot;Le Villi&quot; was later staged at the Teatro Dal Verme, premiering on 31 May 1884. Casa Ricordi assisted with the première by printing the libretto without charge. Fellow students from the Milan Conservatory formed a large part of the orchestra. The performance was enough of a success that Casa Ricordi purchased the opera. Revised into a two-act version with an intermezzo between the acts, &quot;Le Villi&quot; was performed at La Scala in Milan, on 24 January 1885. However, Ricordi did not publish the score until 1887, hindering further performance of the work.

===&quot;Edgar&quot;===
Impressed with &quot;Le Villi&quot; and its composer, music publisher Giulio Ricordi commissioned a second opera from Puccini, which would result in &quot;Edgar&quot;. Work begun in 1884 when Fontana began working out the scenario for the libretto. Puccini finished primary composition in 1887, and orchestration in 1888. &quot;Edgar&quot; premiered at La Scala on 21 April 1889 to a lukewarm response. The work was withdrawn for revisions after its third performance. In a Milanese newspaper, Giulio Ricordi published a defence of Puccini&#x27;s skill as a composer, while criticizing Fontana&#x27;s libretto. A revised version met with success at the Teatro del Giglio in Puccini&#x27;s native Lucca on 5 September 1891. In 1892, further revisions reduced the length of the opera from four acts to three, in a version that was well received in Ferrara and was performed in Turin and in Spain. Puccini made further revisions in 1901 and 1905, but the work never achieved popularity. Without the personal support of Ricordi, &quot;Edgar&quot; might have cost Puccini his career. Puccini had eloped with his former piano student, the married Elvira Gemignani (), and Ricordi&#x27;s associates were willing to turn a blind eye to his lifestyle as long as he was successful. When &quot;Edgar&quot; failed, they suggested to Ricordi that he should drop Puccini, but Ricordi said that he would stay with him and continued his allowance until his next opera.

===&quot;Manon Lescaut&quot;===
On commencing his next opera, &quot;Manon Lescaut&quot;, Puccini announced that he would write his own libretto so that &quot;no fool of a librettist&quot; could spoil it. Ricordi persuaded him to accept Ruggero Leoncavallo as his librettist, but Puccini soon asked Ricordi to remove him from the project. Four other librettists were then involved with the opera, as Puccini constantly changed his mind about the structure of the piece. It was almost by accident that the final two, Luigi Illica and Giuseppe Giacosa, came together to complete the opera.

&quot;Manon Lescaut&quot; premiered at the Teatro Regio in Turin on 2 February 1893. By coincidence, Puccini&#x27;s first enduringly popular opera appeared within a week of the premiere of Verdi&#x27;s last opera, &quot;Falstaff&quot;, which was first performed on 9 February 1893. In anticipation of the premiere, wrote that Puccini was a young man concerning whom &quot;great hopes&quot; had a real basis (&quot;&quot;). Because of the failure of &quot;Edgar&quot;, however, a failure of &quot;Manon Lescaut&quot; could have jeopardized Puccini&#x27;s future as a composer. Although Giulio Ricordi, head of Casa Ricordi, was supportive of Puccini while &quot;Manon Lescaut&quot; was still in development, the Casa Ricordi board of directors was considering cutting off Puccini&#x27;s financial support. In any event, &quot;&quot;Manon Lescaut&quot; was Puccini&#x27;s first and only uncontested triumph, acclaimed by critics and public alike.&quot; After the London premiere in 1894, George Bernard Shaw pronounced: &quot;Puccini looks to me more like the heir of Verdi than any of his rivals.&quot;

&quot;Manon Lescaut&quot; was a great success and established Puccini&#x27;s reputation as the most promising rising composer of his generation, and the most likely &quot;successor&quot; to Verdi as the leading exponent of the Italian operatic tradition. Illica and Giacosa returned as librettists for Puccini for his next three operas, probably his greatest successes: &quot;La bohème&quot;, &quot;Tosca&quot; and &quot;Madama Butterfly&quot;.

==Middle career==

===&quot;La bohème&quot;===
Puccini&#x27;s next work after &quot;Manon Lescaut&quot; was &quot;La bohème&quot; (&quot;The Bohemian&quot;)&quot;,&quot; a four-act opera based on the 1851 book by Henri Murger, &quot;La Vie de Bohème&quot;. &quot;La bohème&quot; premiered in Turin in 1896, conducted by Arturo Toscanini. Within a few years, it had been performed in many of the leading opera houses of Europe, including in Britain, as well as in the United States. It was a popular success and remains one of the most frequently performed operas ever written.

The libretto of the opera, freely adapted from Murger&#x27;s episodic novel, combines comic elements of the impoverished life of the young protagonists with tragic aspects, such as the death of the young seamstress Mimí. Puccini&#x27;s own life as a young man in Milan served as a source of inspiration for elements of the libretto. During his years as a conservatory student and in the years before &quot;Manon Lescaut&quot;, he experienced poverty similar to that of the bohemians in &quot;La bohème&quot;, including a chronic shortage of necessities like food, clothing and money to pay rent. Although Puccini was granted a small monthly stipend by the Congregation of Charity in Rome (), he frequently had to pawn his possessions to cover basic expenses. Early biographers such as Wakeling Dry and Eugenio Checchi, who were Puccini&#x27;s contemporaries, drew express parallels between these incidents and particular events in the opera. Checchi cited a diary kept by Puccini while he was still a student, which recorded an occasion in which, as in Act 4 of the opera, a single herring served as a dinner for four people. Puccini himself commented: &quot;I lived that &quot;Bohème&quot;, when there wasn&#x27;t yet any thought stirring in my brain of seeking the theme of an opera&quot;. (&quot;&quot;)

Puccini&#x27;s composition of &quot;La bohème&quot; was the subject of a public dispute between Puccini and fellow composer Ruggiero Leoncavallo. In early 1893, the two composers discovered that they were both engaged in writing operas based on Murger&#x27;s work. Leoncavallo had started his work first, and he and his music publisher claimed to have &quot;priority&quot; on the subject (although Murger&#x27;s work was in the public domain). Puccini responded that he started his own work without having any knowledge of Leoncavallo&#x27;s project, and wrote: &quot;Let him compose. I will compose. The audience will decide.&quot; Puccini&#x27;s opera premiered a year before that of Leoncavallo, and has been a perennial audience favourite, while Leoncavallo&#x27;s version quickly faded into obscurity.

===&quot;Tosca&quot;===
Puccini&#x27;s next work after &quot;La bohème&quot; was &quot;Tosca&quot; (1900), arguably Puccini&#x27;s first foray into &quot;verismo&quot;, the realistic depiction of many facets of real life including violence. Puccini had been considering an opera on this theme since he saw the play &quot;Tosca&quot; by Victorien Sardou in 1889, when he wrote to his publisher, Giulio Ricordi, begging him to get Sardou&#x27;s permission for the work to be made into an opera: &quot;I see in this &quot;Tosca&quot; the opera I need, with no overblown proportions, no elaborate spectacle, nor will it call for the usual excessive amount of music.&quot;

The music of &quot;Tosca&quot; employs musical signatures for particular characters and emotions, which have been compared to Wagnerian leitmotivs, and some contemporaries saw Puccini as thereby adopting a new musical style influenced by Richard Wagner. Others viewed the work differently. Rejecting the allegation that &quot;Tosca&quot; displayed Wagnerian influences, a critic reporting on the Torino premiere of 20 February 1900 wrote: &quot;I don&#x27;t think you could find a more Puccinian score than this.&quot;

===Automobile crash and near-death===
On 25 February 1903, Puccini was seriously injured in a car crash during a nighttime journey on the road from Lucca to Torre del Lago. The car was driven by Puccini&#x27;s chauffeur and was carrying Puccini, his future wife Elvira, and their son Antonio. It went off the road, fell several metres, and flipped over. Elvira and Antonio were flung from the car and escaped with minor injuries. Puccini&#x27;s chauffeur, also thrown from the car, suffered a serious fracture of his femur. Puccini was pinned under the vehicle, with a severe fracture of his right leg and with a portion of the car pressing down on his chest. A doctor living near the scene of the crash, together with another person who came to investigate, saved Puccini from the wreckage. The injury did not heal well, and Puccini remained under treatment for months. During the medical examinations that he underwent it was also found that he was suffering from a form of diabetes. The accident and its consequences slowed Puccini&#x27;s completion of his next work, &quot;Madama Butterfly&quot;.

===&quot;Madama Butterfly&quot;===
The original version of &quot;Madama Butterfly&quot; (&quot;Madam Butterfly&quot;) premiered at La Scala on 17 February 1904 with Rosina Storchio in the title role. It was initially greeted with great hostility (probably largely owing to inadequate rehearsals). When Storchio&#x27;s kimono accidentally lifted during the performance, some in the audience started shouting: &quot;The butterfly is pregnant&quot; and &quot;There is the little Toscanini&quot;. The latter comment referred to her well-publicised affair with Arturo Toscanini. This version was in two acts; after its disastrous premiere, Puccini withdrew the opera, revising it for what was virtually a second premiere at Brescia in May 1904 and performances in Buenos Aires, London, the US and Paris. In 1907, Puccini made his final revisions to the opera in a fifth version, which has become known as the &quot;standard version&quot;. Today, the standard version of the opera is the version most often performed around the world. However, the original 1904 version is occasionally performed as well, and has been recorded.

==Later works==

After 1904, Puccini&#x27;s compositions were less frequent. In 1906 Giacosa died and, in 1909, there was a scandal after Puccini&#x27;s wife, Elvira, falsely accused their maid Doria Manfredi of having an affair with Puccini. Finally, in 1912, the death of Giulio Ricordi, Puccini&#x27;s editor and publisher, ended a productive period of his career.

===&quot;La fanciulla del West&quot;===
Puccini completed &quot;La fanciulla del West&quot; (&quot;The Damsel of the West&quot;), based on a play by David Belasco, in 1910. This was commissioned by, and first performed at, the Metropolitan Opera in New York on 10 December 1910 with Met stars Enrico Caruso and Emmy Destinn for whom Puccini created the leading roles of Dick Johnson and Minnie. Toscanini, then the musical director of the Met, conducted. This was the first world premiere of an opera at the Met. The premiere was a great success. However, the compositional style employed in the opera, with few stand-alone arias, was criticized at the time. Some contemporaries also criticized the opera for failing to achieve an &quot;American&quot; tone. However, the opera has been acclaimed for its incorporation of advanced harmonic language and rhythmic complexity into the Italian operatic form. In addition, one aria from the opera, &quot;Ch&#x27;ella mi creda&quot;, has become a staple of compilation albums by operatic tenors. It is said that during World War I, Italian soldiers sang this aria to maintain their spirits. The 2008 Italian film, &quot;Puccini e la fanciulla&quot; (&quot;Puccini and the Girl&quot;), is based on the period of his life when he was composing the opera.

===&quot;La rondine&quot;===
Puccini completed the score of &quot;La rondine&quot; (&quot;The Swallow&quot;) to a libretto by Giuseppe Adami in 1916 after two years of work, and it was premiered at the Grand Théâtre de Monte Carlo on 27 March 1917. The opera had been originally commissioned by Vienna&#x27;s Carltheater; however, the outbreak of World War I prevented the premiere from being given there. Moreover, the firm of Ricordi had declined the score of the opera – Giulio Ricordi&#x27;s son Tito was then in charge and he described the opera as &quot;bad Lehár&quot;. It was taken up by their rival, Lorenzo Sonzogno, who arranged the first performance in neutral Monaco. The composer continued to work at revising this, the least known of his mature operas, until his death.

&quot;La rondine&quot; was initially conceived as an operetta, but Puccini eliminated spoken dialogue, rendering the work closer in form to an opera. A modern reviewer described &quot;La rondine&quot; as &quot;a continuous fabric of lilting waltz tunes, catchy pop-styled melodies, and nostalgic love music,&quot; while characterizing the plot as recycling characters and incidents from works like &#x27;La traviata&#x27; and &#x27;Die Fledermaus&#x27;.

===&quot;Il trittico&quot;: &quot;Il tabarro&quot;, &quot;Suor Angelica&quot;, and &quot;Gianni Schicchi&quot;===
In 1918, &quot;Il trittico&quot; (&quot;The Triptych&quot;) premiered in New York. This work is composed of three one-act operas, each concerning the concealment of a death: a horrific episode (&quot;Il tabarro&quot;; &quot;The Cloak&quot;) in the style of the Parisian Grand Guignol, a sentimental tragedy (&quot;Suor Angelica&quot;; &quot;Sister Angelica&quot;), and a comedy (&quot;Gianni Schicchi&quot;).

===&quot;Turandot&quot;===
&quot;Turandot&quot;, Puccini&#x27;s final opera, was left unfinished at the composer&#x27;s death in November 1924, and the last two scenes were completed by Franco Alfano based on the composer&#x27;s sketches. The libretto for &quot;Turandot&quot; was based on a play of the same name by Carlo Gozzi. The music of the opera is heavily inflected with pentatonic motifs, intended to produce an Asiatic flavour to the music. &quot;Turandot&quot; contains a number of memorable stand-alone arias, among them &quot;Nessun dorma&quot;.

==Librettists==
The libretto of &quot;Edgar&quot; was a significant factor in the failure of that opera. Thereafter, especially throughout his middle and late career, Puccini was extremely selective, and at times indecisive, in his choice of subject matter for new works. Puccini was deeply involved in the process of writing the libretto itself, requiring many iterative revisions of his libretti in terms of both structure and text. Puccini&#x27;s relationships with his librettists were at times very difficult. His publisher, Casa Ricordi, was frequently required to mediate disputes and impasses between them.

Puccini explored many possible subjects that he ultimately rejected only after a significant amount of effort—such as the creation of a libretto—had been put into them. Among the subjects that Puccini seriously considered, but abandoned, were: &quot;Cristoforo Sly&quot;, &quot;Anima Allegra&quot; (based on the play &quot;El genio alegre&quot; by Serafín and Joaquín Álvarez Quintero), &quot;Two Little Wooden Shoes&quot; (&quot;I due zoccoletti&quot;) (a short story by Maria Louise Ramé, a.k.a. Ouida), the life of Marie Antoinette, Margherita da Cortona, and &quot;Conchita&quot; (based on the novel &quot;La Femme et le pantin&quot; – &quot;The Woman and the Puppet&quot;, by Pierre Loüys). Some of these abandoned subjects were taken up and turned into operas by other composers. For example, Franco Vittadini made an opera of &quot;Anima Allegra&quot;, Mascagni&#x27;s opera &quot;Lodoletta&quot; is derived from &quot;Two Little Wooden Shoes&quot;, and Riccardo Zandonai eventually wrote &quot;Conchita&quot;.

==Torre del Lago==

From 1891 onwards, Puccini spent most of his time, when not travelling on business, at Torre del Lago, a small community about fifteen miles from Lucca situated between the Ligurian Sea and Lake Massaciuccoli, just south of Viareggio. Torre del Lago was the primary place for Puccini to indulge his love of hunting. &quot;I love hunting, I love cars: and for these things, in the isolation of Torre del Lago, I keep the faith.&quot; (&quot;Amo la caccia, adoro l&#x27;automobile: e a questo e a quella nelle solitudini di Torre del Lago serbo intera la mia fede.&quot;)

By 1900, he had acquired land and built a villa on the lake, now known as the &quot;Villa Puccini&quot;. He lived there until 1921, when pollution produced by peat works on the lake forced him to move to Viareggio, a few kilometres north. After his death, a mausoleum was created in the Villa Puccini and the composer is buried there in the chapel, along with his wife and son who died later.

The Villa Museo was owned by his granddaughter, Simonetta Puccini, until her death, and is open to the public. An annual Festival Puccini is held at Torre del Lago.

==Marriage and affairs==

In the autumn of 1884, in Lucca, Puccini began a relationship with a married woman named Elvira Gemignani (), a former piano student of his. Elvira&#x27;s husband, Narciso Gemignani, was an &quot;unrepentant womanizer&quot;, and Elvira&#x27;s marriage was not a happy one. Elvira became pregnant by Puccini, and their son, Antonio (1886–1946), was born in Monza. Elvira left Lucca when the pregnancy began to show and gave birth elsewhere to avoid gossip. Elvira, Antonio and Elvira&#x27;s daughter by Narciso, Fosca (1880–1968), began to live with Puccini shortly afterwards. Narciso was killed by the husband of a woman that Narciso had an affair with, dying on 26 February 1903, one day after Puccini&#x27;s car accident. Only then, in early 1904, were Puccini and Elvira able to marry, and to legitimize Antonio.

The marriage between Puccini and Elvira was also troubled by infidelity, as Puccini had frequent affairs himself, including with well-known singers such as Maria Jeritza, Emmy Destinn, Cesira Ferrani, and Hariclea Darclée. In 1906, while attending the opening of &quot;Madama Butterfly&quot; in Budapest, Puccini fell in love with Blanke Lendvai, the sister of Hungarian composer Ervin Lendvai (his friend and protégé for many years). Blanke and Puccini exchanged love letters until 1911, when he started an affair with German aristocrat Baroness Josephine von Stangel, which lasted for six years.

In 1909, Puccini&#x27;s wife Elvira publicly accused Doria Manfredi, a maid working for the Puccini family, of having an affair with the composer. After the accusation, Manfredi committed suicide. However, an autopsy determined that Manfredi had died a virgin, refuting the allegations made against her. Elvira Puccini was prosecuted for slander and was sentenced to more than five months in prison, although a payment to the Manfredi family by Puccini spared Elvira from having to serve the sentence. Some music critics and interpreters of Puccini&#x27;s work have speculated that the psychological effects of this incident on Puccini interfered with his ability to complete compositions later in his career, and also influenced the development of his characters such as Liù (from &quot;Turandot&quot;), a slave girl who dies tragically by suicide.

In 2007, documents were found in the possession of Nadia Manfredi, a descendant of the Manfredi family, which indicated that Puccini was actually having an affair with Giulia Manfredi, Doria&#x27;s cousin. Upon the discovery of these documents, the press began to allege that Puccini had fathered Giulia Manfredi&#x27;s son Antonio, which would make Nadia a granddaughter of Puccini.

==Politics==
Unlike Wagner and Verdi, Puccini was not active in politics. Puccini biographer Mary Jane Phillips-Matz wrote: &quot;Throughout this entire period [of World War I and its immediate aftermath], Puccini&#x27;s interest in politics was close to zero, as it had been all his life, so far as one can judge. He seemed almost indifferent to everything from mayoral elections in Viareggio to cabinet appointments in Rome.&quot; Another biographer speculates that Puccini may have been—if he had a political philosophy—a monarchist.

Puccini&#x27;s indifference to politics caused him problems during World War I. Puccini&#x27;s long-standing and close friendship with Toscanini was interrupted for nearly a decade because of an argument in the summer of 1914 (in the opening months of the war) during which Puccini remarked that Italy could benefit from German organization. Puccini was also criticized during the war for his work on &quot;La rondine&quot; under a 1913 commission contract with an Austrian theater after Italy and Austria-Hungary became opponents in the war in 1915 (although the contract was ultimately cancelled). Puccini did not participate in the public war effort, but privately rendered assistance to individuals and families affected by the war.

In 1919, Puccini was commissioned to write music to an ode by honouring Italy&#x27;s victories in World War I. The work, &quot;Inno a Roma&quot; (Hymn to Rome), was to premiere on 21 April 1919, during a celebration of the anniversary of the founding of Rome. The premiere was delayed to 1 June 1919, when it was played at the opening of a gymnastics competition. Although not written for the fascists, &quot;Inno a Roma&quot; was widely played during Fascist street parades and public ceremonies.

Puccini had some contact with Benito Mussolini and the Italian Fascist Party in the year preceding his death. In 1923 the Fascist Party in Viareggio made Puccini an honorary member and sent him a membership card. However, evidence that Puccini was actually a member of the Fascist Party is ambiguous. The Italian Senate has traditionally included a small number of members appointed in recognition of their cultural contributions to the nation. Puccini hoped to attain this honour, which had been granted to Verdi, and undertook to use his connections to bring about the appointment. While honorary senators could vote, there is no indication that Puccini sought the appointment for this purpose. Puccini also wished to establish a national theatre in Viareggio, a project which would require government support. Puccini met with Mussolini twice, in November and December 1923, seeking support for the theatre project. While the theatre project never came to fruition, Puccini was named Senator (&quot;senatore a vita&quot;) a few months before his death.

At the time Puccini met with Mussolini, Mussolini had been prime minister for approximately a year, but his party had not yet taken full control of the Italian Parliament through the violence and irregularities of the 1924 general election. Puccini was no longer alive when Mussolini announced the end of representative government and the beginning of a fascist dictatorship, in his speech before the Chamber of Deputies on 3 January 1925.

==Death==

A chain smoker of Toscano cigars and cigarettes, Puccini began to complain of a chronic sore throat towards the end of 1923. A diagnosis of throat cancer led his doctors to recommend a new and experimental radiation therapy treatment which was being offered in Brussels. Puccini and his wife never understood how serious the cancer was, as the news was revealed only to his son.

Puccini died in Brussels on 29 November 1924, aged 65, from complications after the treatment; uncontrolled bleeding led to a heart attack the day after surgery. News of his death reached Rome during a performance of &quot;La bohème&quot;. The opera was immediately stopped, and the orchestra played Chopin&#x27;s &quot;Funeral March&quot; for the stunned audience. 

His funeral took place at Saint Mary&#x27;s Royal Church in Schaerbeek, Brussels.
He was buried in Milan, in Toscanini&#x27;s family tomb, but that was always intended as a temporary measure. In 1926, on the 2nd anniversary of his death, his son arranged to transfer his father&#x27;s remains to a specially created chapel inside the Puccini villa at Torre del Lago.

==Style and critical reception==
Most broadly, Puccini wrote in the style of the late-Romantic period of classical music (see Romantic music). Music historians also refer to Puccini as a component of the &quot;giovane scuola&quot; (&quot;young school&quot;), a cohort of composers who came onto the Italian operatic scene as Verdi&#x27;s career came to an end, such as Mascagni, Leoncavallo, and others mentioned below. Puccini is also frequently referred to as a &quot;verismo&quot; composer.

Puccini&#x27;s career extended from the end of the Romantic period into the modern period. He consciously attempted to &#x27;update&#x27; his style to keep pace with new trends but did not attempt to fully adopt a modern style. One critic, Andrew Davis, has stated: &quot;Loyalty toward nineteenth-century Italian-opera traditions and, more generally, toward the musical language of his Tuscan heritage is one of the clearest features of Puccini&#x27;s music.&quot; Davis also identifies, however, a &quot;stylistic pluralism&quot; in Puccini&#x27;s work, including influences from &quot;the German symphonic tradition, French harmonic and orchestrational traditions, and, to a lesser extent, aspects of Wagnerian chromaticism&quot;. In addition, Puccini frequently sought to introduce music or sounds from outside sources into his operas, such as his use of Chinese folk melodies in &quot;Turandot&quot;.

All of Puccini&#x27;s operas have at least one set piece for a lead singer that is separate enough from its surroundings that it can be treated as a distinct aria, and most of his works have several of these. At the same time, Puccini&#x27;s work continued the trend away from operas constructed from a series of set pieces, and instead used a more &quot;through-composed&quot; or integrated construction. His works are strongly melodic. In orchestration, Puccini frequently doubled the vocal line in unison or at octaves in order to emphasize and strengthen the melodic line.

&quot;Verismo&quot; is a style of Italian opera that began in 1890 with the first performance of Mascagni&#x27;s &quot;Cavalleria rusticana&quot;, peaked in the early 1900s, and lingered into the 1920s. The style is distinguished by realistic – sometimes sordid or violent – depictions of everyday life, especially the life of the contemporary lower classes. Verismo does not usually employ the historical or mythical subjects associated with Romanticism. &quot;Cavalleria rusticana&quot;, &quot;Pagliacci&quot;, and &quot;Andrea Chénier&quot; are uniformly considered to be &quot;verismo&quot; operas. Puccini&#x27;s career as a composer is almost entirely coincident in time with the &quot;verismo&quot; movement. Only his &quot;Le Villi&quot; and &quot;Edgar&quot; preceded &quot;Cavalleria rusticana&quot;. Some view Puccini as essentially a &quot;verismo&quot; composer, while others, although acknowledging that he took part in the movement to some degree, do not view him as a &quot;pure&quot; &quot;verismo&quot; composer. In addition, critics differ as to the degree to which particular operas by Puccini are, or are not, properly described as &quot;verismo&quot; operas. Two of Puccini&#x27;s operas, &quot;Tosca&quot; and &quot;Il Tabarro&quot;, are universally considered to be &quot;verismo&quot; operas. Puccini scholar Mosco Carner places only two of Puccini&#x27;s operas other than &quot;Tosca&quot; and &quot;Il tabarro&quot; within the &quot;verismo&quot; school: &quot;Madama Butterfly&quot;, and &quot;La Fanciulla del West&quot;. Because only three &quot;verismo&quot; works that were composed by Puccini continue to appear regularly on stage (the aforementioned &quot;Cavalleria rusticana&quot;, &quot;Pagliacci&quot;, and &quot;Andrea Chénier&quot;), Puccini&#x27;s contribution has had lasting significance to the genre.

Both during his lifetime and in posterity, Puccini&#x27;s success outstripped other Italian opera composers of his time, and he has been matched in this regard by only a handful of composers in the entire history of opera. Between 2004 and 2018, Puccini ranked third (behind Verdi and Mozart) in the number of performances of his operas worldwide, as surveyed by Operabase. Three of his operas (&quot;La bohème&quot;, &quot;Tosca&quot;, and &quot;Madama Butterfly&quot;) were amongst the 10 most frequently performed operas worldwide.

Gustav Kobbé, the original author of &quot;The Complete Opera Book&quot;, a standard reference work on opera, wrote in the 1919 edition: &quot;Puccini is considered the most important figure in operatic Italy today, the successor of Verdi, if there is any.&quot; Other contemporaries shared this view. Italian opera composers of the generation with whom Puccini was compared included Pietro Mascagni (1863–1945), Ruggero Leoncavallo (1857–1919), Umberto Giordano (1867–1948), Francesco Cilea (1866–1950), Baron Pierantonio Tasca (1858–1934), Gaetano Coronaro (1852–1908), and Alberto Franchetti (1860–1942). Only three composers, and three works, by Italian contemporaries of Puccini appear on the Operabase list of most-performed works: &quot;Cavalleria rusticana&quot; by Mascagni, &quot;Pagliacci&quot; by Ruggero Leoncavallo, and &quot;Andrea Chénier&quot; by Umberto Giordano. Kobbé contrasted Puccini&#x27;s ability to achieve &quot;sustained&quot; success with the failure of Mascagni and Leoncavallo to produce more than merely &quot;one sensationally successful short opera&quot;. By the time of Puccini&#x27;s death in 1924, he had earned $4 million from his works.

Although the popular success of Puccini&#x27;s work is undeniable, and his mastery of the craft of composition has been consistently recognized, opinion among critics as to the artistic value of his work has always been divided. Grove Music Online described Puccini&#x27;s strengths as a composer as follows:
Puccini succeeded in mastering the orchestra as no other Italian had done before him, creating new forms by manipulating structures inherited from the great Italian tradition, loading them with bold harmonic progressions which had little or nothing to do with what was happening then in Italy, though they were in step with the work of French, Austrian and German colleagues.

In his work on Puccini, Julian Budden describes Puccini as a gifted and original composer, noting the innovation hidden in the popularity of works such as &quot;Che gelida manina&quot;. He describes the aria in musical terms (the signature embedded in the harmony for example), and points out that its structure was rather unheard of at the time, having three distinct musical paragraphs that nonetheless form a complete and coherent whole. This gumption in musical experimentation was the essence of Puccini&#x27;s style, as evidenced in his diverse settings and use of the motif to express ideas beyond those in the story and text.

Puccini has, however, consistently been the target of condescension by some music critics who find his music insufficiently sophisticated or difficult. Some have explicitly condemned his efforts to please his audience, such as this contemporary Italian critic:
He willingly stops himself at minor genius, stroking the taste of the public ... obstinately shunning too-daring innovation ... A little heroism, but not taken to great heights; a little bit of veristic comedy, but brief; a lot of sentiment and romantic idyll: this is the recipe in which he finds happiness. ()

Budden attempted to explain the paradox of Puccini&#x27;s immense popular success and technical mastery on the one hand, and the relative disregard in which his work has been held by academics:
No composer communicates more directly with an audience than Puccini. Indeed, for many years he has remained a victim of his own popularity; hence the resistance to his music in academic circles. Be it remembered, however, that Verdi&#x27;s melodies were once dismissed as barrel-organ fodder. The truth is that music that appeals immediately to a public becomes subject to bad imitation, which can cast a murky shadow over the original. So long as counterfeit Puccinian melody dominated the world of sentimental operetta, many found it difficult to come to terms with the genuine article. Now that the current coin of light music has changed, the composer admired by Schoenberg, Ravel, and Stravinsky can be seen to emerge in his full stature.

==Puccini studies==
Founded in 1996 in Lucca, the Centro di studi Giacomo Puccini embraces a wide range of approaches to the study of Puccini&#x27;s work. In the US, the American Center for Puccini Studies specializes in the presentation of unusual performing editions of the composer&#x27;s works and introduces neglected or unknown Puccini pieces. It was founded in 2004 by the singer and director Harry Dunstan.

==Works==

Puccini wrote orchestral pieces, sacred music, chamber music, solo music for piano and organ and songs for voice and piano, most notably his 1880 mass &quot;Messa di gloria&quot;, his &quot;Preludio Sinfonico&quot; of 1882, and his 1890 string quartet movement &quot;Crisantemi&quot;.
