<doc id="11753" wikidata="Q2600338" url="?curid=11753" title="List of freshwater aquarium plant species">
<text>Aquatic plants are used to give the freshwater aquarium a natural appearance, oxygenate the water, absorb ammonia, and provide habitat for fish, especially fry (babies) and for invertebrates. Some aquarium fish and invertebrates also eat live plants. Hobbyists use aquatic plants for aquascaping, of several aesthetic styles.

Most of these plant species are found either partially or fully submerged in their natural habitat. Although there are a handful of obligate aquatic plants that must be grown entirely underwater, most can grow fully emersed if the soil is moist. Though some are just living at the water margins, still, they can live in the completely submerged habitat.

==By scientific name==
The taxonomy of most plant genera is not final. Scientific names listed here may, therefore, contradict other sources. Many of these species are dangerous invasives and should be disposed of in a way that guarantees that they will not enter local waters.

===Algae===

Most algae in hobby aquaria are unwanted, nuisance plants. Few algae, such as marimo (&quot;Aegagropila linnaei&quot;), are sought after and intentionally cultivated in freshwater aquaria.

==False aquatics or pseudo-aquarium plants==
Several species of terrestrial plants are frequently sold as &quot;aquarium plants&quot;. While such plants are beautiful and can survive and even flourish for months under water, they will eventually die and must be removed so their decay does not contaminate the aquarium water. These plants have no necessary biology to live underwater.

<text>Fonni () is a town and &quot;comune&quot; in Sardinia, in the province of Nuoro (Italy).

It is the highest town in Sardinia, and situated among fine scenery with some chestnut woods. Fonni is a winter sports centre with a ski lift to Monte Spada and Bruncu Spina.

==Etymology==
The term &quot;Fonni/-e&quot; probably derives from the Latin &quot;fons&quot;, meaning &quot;fountain&quot; or &quot;god of the sources&quot;. In fact the village contains numerous spring water fountains.

==Climate==


==Culture==
The local costumes are extremely picturesque, and are well seen on the day of St John the Baptist, the patron saint. The men&#x27;s costume is similar to that worn in the district generally; the linen trousers are long and black gaiters are worn. The women wear a white chemise; over that a very small corselet, and over that a red jacket with blue and black velvet facings. The skirt is brown above and red below, with a blue band between the two colours; it is accordion-pleated. Two identical skirts are often worn, one above the other. The unmarried girls wear white kerchiefs, the married women black.

==Neighborhoods==
Neighborhoods in Fonni are called &quot;Rioni&quot; of these the oldest is called &quot;su piggiu&quot; or the peak, probably derived by the fact this is the highest and first layer of the village. Others include &quot;puppuai&quot; and &quot;cresiedda&quot; to the south, and &quot;logotza&quot; to the east.

==Churches==
*Sanctuary of the Vergine dei Martiri, Fonni

<text>A fasces ( ; ; a , from the Latin word , meaning &#x27;bundle&#x27;; ) is a bound bundle of wooden rods, often but not always including an axe (occasionally two axes) with its blade emerging. The fasces is an Italian symbol that had its origin in the Etruscan civilization and was passed on to ancient Rome, where it symbolized a Roman king&#x27;s power to punish his subjects, and later, a magistrate&#x27;s power and jurisdiction. The axe has its own separate and older origin. Initially associated with the labrys (; ), the double-bitted axe originally from Crete, is one of the oldest symbols of Greek civilization.

The image of fasces has survived in the modern world as a representation of magisterial power, law, and governance. The fasces frequently occurs as a charge in heraldry: it is present on the reverse of the U.S. Mercury dime coin and behind the podium in the United States House of Representatives and in the Seal of the U.S. Senate; and it was the origin of the name of the National Fascist Party in Italy (from which the term &quot;fascism&quot; is derived).

During the first half of the twentieth century, both the fasces and the swastika (each symbol having its own unique ancient religious and mythological associations) became heavily identified with the fascist political movements of Benito Mussolini and Adolf Hitler. This is due to Mussolini&#x27;s more active usage of the symbol and the campaigns of Hitler, Nazis, and anti-fascists alike to make various allusions and comparisons between the two dictators to associate Hitler with Mussolini and his symbolism. During this period the swastika became deeply stigmatized, but the fasces did not undergo a similar process outside Italy.

The fasces remained in use in many societies after World War II because it had already been adopted and incorporated into the iconography of numerous governments outside Italy, prior to Mussolini. Such iconographical use persists in governmental and various other contexts. In contrast, the swastika remains in common usage only in Asia, where it originated as an ancient Hindu symbol, and in Navajo iconography, where its religious significance is entirely unrelated to, and predates, early 20th-century European fascism.

== Symbolism ==

The fasces, as a bundle of rods with an axe, was a grouping of all the equipment needed to inflict corporal or capital punishment. In ancient Rome, the bundle was a material symbol of a Roman magistrate&#x27;s full civil and military power, known as . They were carried in a procession with a magistrate by lictors, who carried the fasces and at times used the birch rods as punishment to enforce obedience with magisterial commands. In common language and literature, the fasces were regularly associated with certain offices: praetors were referred to in Greek as the () and the consuls were referred to as &quot;the twelve fasces&quot; as literary metonymy. Beyond serving as insignia of office, it also symbolised the Roman Republic and its prestige.

After the classical period, with the fall of the Roman state, thinkers were removed from the &quot;psychological terror generated by the original Roman fasces&quot; in the antique period. By the Renaissance, there emerged a conflation of the fasces with a Greek fable first recorded by Babrius in the second century AD depicting how individual sticks can be easily broken but how a bundle could not be. This story is common across Eurasian culture and by the thirteenth century AD was recorded in the &quot;Secret History of the Mongols&quot;. While there is no historical connection between the original fasces and this fable, by the sixteenth century AD, fasces were &quot;inextricably linked&quot; with interpretations of the fable as one expressing unity and harmony.

== In the ancient world ==

=== Origin ===
The English word &quot;fasces&quot; comes from Latin, with singular . The word is usually used in its plural to refer to magisterial insignia, but is sometimes used to refer to bushels or bundles in an agricultural context. This word itself comes from the Indo-European root , referring to a bundle.

The earliest archaeological remains of a fasces are those discovered in a necropolis near the Etruscan hamlet now called Vetulonia by the archaeologist Isidoro Falchi in 1897. The discovery is now dated to the relatively narrow range of 630‚Äì625¬†BC, which coincides with the traditional dating of Rome&#x27;s legendary fifth king Lucius Tarquinius Priscus. An Etruscan origin, furthermore, is supported by ancient literary evidence: the poet Silius Italicus, who flourished in the late 1st century AD, posited that Rome adopted many of its emblems of office ‚Äì viz the fasces, the curule chair, and the ‚Äì specifically from Vetulonia. A story of Etruscan origin is further supported by Dionysius of Halicarnassus in his antiquarian work, &quot;Roman Antiquities&quot;.

=== Rome ===

==== Regal period ====
Ancient Roman literary sources are unanimous in describing the ancient kings of Rome as being accompanied by twelve lictors carrying fasces. Dionysius, in &quot;Roman Antiquities&quot;, gave a complex story explaining this number: for him, the practice originated in Etruria and each bundle symbolised one of the twelve Etruscan city-states; the twelve states together represented a joint military campaign and were given to the Etruscan king of Rome, Tarquinius Priscus, on his accession to the throne. While Livy concurred with Dionysius&#x27; story, he also relates a different story ascribing fasces to the first Roman king ‚Äì Romulus ‚Äì who selected twelve to correspond to the twelve birds which appeared in augury at the founding of Rome.

Later stories gave different aetiologies: some described fasces as coming from Latium, others from Italy in general. Macrobius, writing in the 5th century AD, have the Romans taking fasces from the Etruscans as spoils of war rather than adopted by cultural diffusion. In general, it seems that by the sixth century BC, fasces had become a common symbol in central Italy and Etruria ‚Äì if not also into southern Italy, as Livy implies ‚Äì for royal prestige and coercive power. The ancient Roman literary record largely depicts the fasces of their time as carried largely symbolically by lictors who were present primarily to defend their charges from violence. However, the same stories depict fasces far more negatively in the context of tyrannies or regal displays.

Plutarch, in his &quot;Life of Publicola&quot;, describes an incident in which Lucius Junius Brutus, the first Roman consul, has lictors scourge with rods and decapitate with axes ‚Äì components of the fasces ‚Äì his own sons who were conspiring to restore the Tarquins to the throne. After Brutus&#x27; alleged death in battle, Publicola then passed reforms subordinating magisterial use of fasces for coercion to the people: consuls would lower the fasces before the people during speeches and there would be appeal to the people against a magistrate ordering capital or corporal punishment.

==== Republican period ====

During the republic, the Romans used the number of fasces accompanying a magistrate to mark out rank and distinction. The two consuls each had 12 lictors, as did the traditional dictators. The late republican dictators ‚Äì of which Sulla was the first ‚Äì were accompanied by 24 lictors and fasces. However, the consuls alternated initiative by month. The consul without initiative would retain a negative on the other consul&#x27;s actions but would be preceded only by an and be followed by lictors bearing reduced fasces.

Praetors normally held six fasces and were so described on campaign in Greek sources. There were, however, some exceptions. After 197¬†BC, praetors sent to Hispania were dispatched with proconsular status and therefore received twelve fasces. Around the same time, in the , the number of fasces accompanying a praetor in court was reduced to merely two, possibly because a praetor in court &quot;with six fasces might seem imperious&quot;.

By the late second century BC, magistrates who had won victories abroad that were proclaimed ‚Äì a victory title ‚Äì were decorated with laurel. This acclamation was a necessary prerequisite for celebrating a triumph, a prestigious award for which commanders might wait years. Within the , Rome&#x27;s sacred city boundary, the magistrates normally removed the axes from their fasces to symbolise the appealable nature of their civic powers. However, an exception was made during a triumph, when the triumphing general&#x27;s military auspices were extended into the city so that he could make sacrifices at the Temple of Jupiter on the Capitoline Hill. The laurels decorating the triumphator&#x27;s axed fasces were removed and decided in a ceremony, placing them in the lap of the cult statue of the Capitoline Jupiter.

During the republic, only persons possessing were granted full complements of fasces; the number granted to promagistrates for their analogous rank was not diminished. Lieutenants exercising delegated were, in the late republic, regularly granted two fasces. When others were sometimes assigned lictors as bodyguards or otherwise to assist in official duties, they probably did not carry fasces. Italian municipal officials during the republic were usually accompanied by local lictors, but these lictors did not carry fasces until imperial times.

Popular resistance to magistrates during the late republic sometimes took the form of mobs smashing magisterial fasces. In 133¬†BC, Tiberius Gracchus incited a mob to take and break a praetor&#x27;s fasces; two praetors, a certain Brutus and Servilius, were dispatched in 88¬†BC to order Lucius Cornelius Sulla, then consul, to desist from his march on Rome and had their insignia of office defaced and destroyed; Marcus Calpurnius Bibulus&#x27;s lictors were set upon in 59¬†BC when he ‚Äì along with some plebeian tribunes ‚Äì attempted to veto Julius Caesar&#x27;s land reform bill during their joint consulship, leading to his lictors&#x27; fasces being lost entirely. This last breaking of fasces was &quot;a ritualistic act of symbolic violence (the People thus disposing of tokens of the imperium that was in their gift) that substituted for direct physical violence against the person of the consul&quot;.

==== Imperial period ====

During the Roman Empire, the number of people who were entitled to fasces and lictors expanded. Fasces were first granted to Vestal Virgins by the Senate in 42¬†BC when the six vestals were allowed one lictor each. They were joined by fasces granted to the three major (high priests). Single lictors also preceded members of the , who were priests of the imperial cult. At the death of the first emperor, Augustus, in AD 14, his widow Livia was voted a lictor by the Senate, though sources disagree as to whether she ever exercised the privilege.

The division of the Roman provinces into imperial and senatorial provinces, with Augustus holding proconsular imperium over the imperial provinces and administering them through legates, also further expanded the number of fasces. Augustus appointed legates with as governors, each of which was granted five lictors. When Italy was divided into fourteen regions in 7¬†BC, the of each region was granted two lictors while in office and on station. After the creation of the (military treasury) in AD¬†6, the three ex-praetors administering it were each granted two lictors as well. Municipal magistrates&#x27; lictors also gained fasces during the imperial period.

By the reign of the Severans at the start of the third century, fasces had been redesigned. Depicted on a sestertius struck , fasces no longer took the form of a bundle of sticks, but rather took the form of a long curved stick or two of such sticks bound together. The number of fasces granted to imperial governors titled proconsul stayed at twelve into the late fourth century AD; governors of the rank received five fasces, but most governors ‚Äì with the rank ‚Äì had no fasces at all. This later form persisted through to the Eastern Roman Empire: the Byzantine antiquarian, John the Lydian, writing in the sixth century AD described fasces as &quot;long rods evenly bound together&quot; with red straps and axes held aloft. Into the mediaeval period, Byzantine emperors remained guarded by men ‚Äì by the 14th century, the Varangian Guard ‚Äì carrying staves and axes.

== Post-classical reception ==
While the Latin word did not fall out of use in the mediaeval period, its technical meaning was forgotten. By the end of the first millennium, it was glossed as &quot;somehow connot[ing] &#x27;supreme power&#x27; or &#x27;official honours. For example, , Jean de Rovroy, when translating Frontinus&#x27; &quot;Stratagems&quot;, was deceived by a false cognate and thought referred to ribbons Roman magistrates would wear on their heads; such misconceptions were apparently common, and dated back to the 11th century. Visual representations of the bundle itself were rare ‚Äì the 11th century AD Junius manuscript excepted ‚Äì until the Renaissance.

=== Renaissance ===
Renaissance humanists, especially those who read more Latin, however, quickly became well-informed on fasces and their legal technicalities, including the customary removal of axes within the city, lowering before the people, and alternation by the consuls. By the first decade of the 16th century, references to fasces in a more Roman context started to appear. At the same time, recognisable depictions started to reappear in Italy, such as Raphael&#x27;s painting &quot;Conversion of the Proconsul&quot; ().

By the mid-1500s, the fasces also began to symbolise other things which would have been &quot;unimportant or even unknown to the Romans&quot;. Pope Clement VIII&#x27;s reassertion of Papal juridical authority after the sack of Rome in 1527 started iconographic developments that would associate fasces with personifications of Justice.

Syncretism of fasces with the Aesop fable of a bundle of sticks being harder to break than each stick alone associated fasces also with domestic concord and in art with personifications of Concord. This symbology also merged with that of justice in that unbinding the rods and axes promoted reflection over just action. In this context, Cardinal Mazarin placed fasces on his coat of arms, &quot;the first individual in the modern era to do so&quot;.

From here, depictions of fasces exploded. Antje Middeldorf-Kosegarten, in &quot;Reallexikon zur Deutschen Kunstgeschichte&quot;,

By the mid-seventeenth century, fasces had become &quot;well established throughout Europe as a catch-all symbol for stable and competent governance&quot;. It also expanded to symbolise competent corporate governance. Yet, due to a massive expansion in meaning, the symbol seemed to have died by the 1760s, muddled as little more than a reference to the past.

=== Revolution ===
As an emblem, fasces made their way to the colonies in British North America. There, during the American Revolution, the fasces&#x27; symbology as referencing strength through unity was adopted as a symbol of the united colonial effort against British rule.

Fasces similarly came to adopt a privileged symbology during the French Revolution. First referring to the 83 departments of 1789, as a symbol of unity, it came to be associated with &quot;fraternit√©&quot; and a united French people. Topped with a Phrygian cap, fasces were seen as a reference to the &quot;imagined spirit of the early Roman republic [and] its assertion of ideals of liberty and justice against tyranny&quot;. In France, however, use of fasces as a symbol declined starting with the establishment of the Consulate in 1799 through to the proclamation of the Second Republic in 1848.

Similar usage proliferated in the aftermath of the French Revolution. Haiti, in its revolution against France, coined with many depictions of fasces, as did Mexico during its first republic, Ecuador, Chile, and the Roman Republic of 1798.

== Modern usage ==
Numerous governments and other authorities have used the image of the fasces as a symbol of power since the end of the Roman Empire. It also has been used to hearken back to the Roman Republic, particularly by those who see themselves as modern-day successors to that republic or its ideals.

The Ecuadorian coat of arms incorporated the fasces in 1830, although it had already been in use in the coat of arms of Gran Colombia.

=== Italy ===
The Italian word &quot;fascio&quot; (: &quot;fasci&quot;), etymologically related to &quot;fasces&quot;, was used by various political organizations in the late 19th and early 20th centuries with the figurative meaning of &quot;league&quot; or &quot;union&quot;.

Italian Fascism, which derives its name from the fasces, arguably used this symbolism the most in the twentieth century. The British Union of Fascists also used it in the 1930s. The fasces, as a widespread and long-established symbol in the West, however, has avoided the stigma associated with much of fascist symbolism (except in Italy, where exhibiting the fasces can lead to an indictment) and many authorities continue to display them, including the federal government of the United States.

=== France ===
A review of the images included in &quot;Les Grands Palais de France : Fontainebleau&quot; reveals that French architects used the Roman fasces (&quot;faisceaux romains&quot;) as a decorative device as early as the reign of Louis XIII (1610‚Äì1643) and continued to employ it through the periods of Napoleon I&#x27;s Empire (1804‚Äì1815).

The fasces typically appeared in a context reminiscent of the Roman Republic and of the Roman Empire. The French Revolution used many references to the ancient Roman Republic in its imagery. During the First Republic, topped by the Phrygian cap, the fasces is a tribute to the Roman Republic and means that power belongs to the people. It also symbolizes the &quot;unity and indivisibility of the Republic&quot;, as stated in the French Constitution. In 1848 and after 1870, it appears on the seal of the French Republic, held by the figure of Liberty. There is the fasces in the arms of the French Republic with the &quot;RF&quot; for &quot;R√©publique fran√ßaise&quot; (see image below), surrounded by leaves of olive tree (as a symbol of peace) and oak (as a symbol of justice). While it is used widely by French officials, this symbol never was officially adopted by the government.

President Val√©ry Giscard d&#x27;Estaing placed one on his presidential flag. In 2015, a logo representing a stylized fasces was used for internet communication by the Presidency of the French Republic. Since 1870, it has also appeared on the badges of deputies and senators known as barometers, which they place conspicuously on their vehicles.

The fasces appears on the helmet and the buckle insignia of the French Army&#x27;s Autonomous Corps of Military Justice, as well as on that service&#x27;s distinct cap badges for the prosecuting and defending lawyers in a court-martial.

=== United States ===
Since the original founding of the United States in the 18th century, several offices and institutions in the United States have heavily incorporated representations of the fasces into much of their iconography.

==== Federal fasces iconography ====

* On the podium of the Emancipation Memorial in Washington D.C., beneath Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s right hand
* The reverse of the Mercury Dime, the design used from 1916 until the adoption of the current FDR dime in 1945, features a fasces.

<text>The fast combat support ship (US Navy hull classification symbol: AOE) is a type of replenishment auxiliary ship. Different from traditional logistic ships, the fast combat support ship is designed with high speed to keep up with the carrier battle group/carrier strike group, while the multi-product station is capable of supplying all types of necessities for the fleet.

==History==
===US Navy===
The fast combat support ship is designed to perform the functions of three old logistic ship types in one hull - fleet oiler (AO), ammunition ship (AE), and refrigerated stores ship (AF). Aside from supplying ships, fast combat support ships need the speed, weapons, sensors, and communications equipment, to serve as an integrated component of the carrier strike battle group. The concept of fast combat support ship was envisioned by United States Navy admiral Arleigh Burke, who laid out the concept as the solution to logistics problems he encountered in World War II.

The first class of the fast combat support ship was the , built with multi-product supply stations, the largest fuel capacity, and the largest ammunition capacity in the US Navy at the time. The four ships of the &quot;Sacramento&quot;-class were 53,000 tons at full load, 796 feet overall length, and carried two Boeing Vertol CH-46 Sea Knight helicopters. The &quot;Sacramento&quot;-class was retired in 2005.

After replacing the &quot;Sacramento&quot;-class, the became the largest combat logistics ship in the United States. They can carry more than 177,000 barrels of oil, 2,150 tons of ammunition, 500 tons of dry stores, and 250 tons of refrigerated stores. They receive petroleum products, ammunition, and stores from various shuttle ships and redistributes these items when needed to ships in the carrier strike group. This greatly reduces the number of service ships needed to travel with carrier strike groups. The ships of the class displaced 48,800 tons full load and carried two Boeing Vertol CH-46 Sea Knight or two Sikorsky MH-60S Knighthawk helicopters.

Air defense includes the RIM-7 Sea Sparrow radar and infrared surface-to-air missile in eight-cell launchers to provide point defense with 15km to 25km range. There are also two 20mm Phalanx CIWS (close-in weapon systems) and two Mk38 25mm cannons. All &quot;Supply&quot;-class combat support ships were commissioned until 2001, and then were transferred to Military Sealift Command.

A program to replace the &quot;Supply&quot;-class ships, the&quot; T-AOE(X) station-ship replacement project&quot;, was cancelled in 2005 by US Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld.

As of early 2023, USNS &quot;Rainier&quot; and USNS &quot;Bridge&quot; have been taken out of service and struck. Along with the remaining two &quot;Supply&quot;-class ships, US Navy fleets are currently supplied by s as well as and s.

===PLA Navy===
In the 21st century, China also developed the Type 901 fast combat support ship, which serves a similar mission in their navy.

<text>FASA Corporation was an American publisher of role-playing games, wargames and board games between 1980 and 2001, after which they closed publishing operations for several years, becoming an IP holding company under the name FASA Inc. In 2012, a wholly owned subsidiary called FASA Games Inc. went into operation, using the name and logo under license from the parent company. FASA Games Inc. works alongside Ral Partha Europe, also a subsidiary of FASA Corporation, to bring out new editions of existing properties such as Earthdawn and Demonworld, and to develop new properties within the FASA cosmology.

FASA first appeared as a &quot;Traveller&quot; licensee, producing supplements for that Game Designers&#x27; Workshop role-playing game, especially the work of the Keith Brothers. The company went on to establish itself as a major gaming company with the publication of the &quot;Star Trek&quot; RPG, then several successful original games. Noteworthy lines included &quot;BattleTech&quot; and &quot;Shadowrun&quot;. Their &quot;Star Trek&quot; role-playing supplements and tactical ship game enjoyed popularity outside the wargaming community since, at the time, official descriptions of the &quot;Star Trek&quot; universe were not common, and the gaming supplements offered details fans craved.

The highly successful &quot;BattleTech&quot; line led to a series of video games, some of the first virtual reality gaming suites, called Virtual World (created by a subdivision of the company known at the time of development as ESP, an acronym for &quot;Extremely Secret Project&quot;) and a Saturday-morning .

Originally, the name FASA was an acronym for &quot;Freedonian Aeronautics and Space Administration&quot;, a joking allusion to the Marx Brothers film &quot;Duck Soup&quot;. This tongue-in-cheek attitude was carried over in humorous self-references in its games. For example, in &quot;Shadowrun&quot;, a tactical nuclear device was detonated near FASA&#x27;s offices at 1026 W. Van Buren St in Chicago, Illinois.

==History==
FASA Corporation was founded by Jordan Weisman and L. Ross Babcock III in 1980 with a starting capital of $350 ($1,200 adjusted for inflation). The two were fellow gamers at the United States Merchant Marine Academy. Mort Weisman, Jordan&#x27;s father, joined the company in 1985 to lead the company&#x27;s operational management, having sold his book publishing business, Swallow Press.

Under the new commercial direction and with Mort&#x27;s capital injection, the company diversified into books and miniature figures. After consulting their UK distributor, Chart Hobby Distributors, FASA licensed the manufacture of its &quot;BattleTech&quot; figurines to Miniature Figurines (also known as Minifigs). FASA would later acquire the U.S. figures manufacturer Ral Partha, which was the US manufacturer of Minifigs. While Mort ran the paper and metal based sides of the business, the company&#x27;s founders focused on the development of computer-based games. They were particularly interested in virtual reality (particularly the BattleTech Centers / Virtual World) but also developed desktop computer games.

When Microsoft acquired the FASA Interactive subsidiary, Babcock went with that company. After the sale of Virtual World, Jordan turned his attention to the founding of a new games venture called WizKids.

==Current status and intellectual property==
FASA unexpectedly ceased active operations on April 30, 2001, but still exists as a corporation holding intellectual property rights, which it licenses to other publishers. Contrary to popular belief, the company did not go bankrupt. Allegedly, the owners decided to quit while the company was still financially sound in a market they perceived as going downhill. Mort Weisman had been talking of retirement for some years, and his confidence in the future of the paper-based games business was low. He considered the intellectual property of FASA to be of high value, but did not wish to continue working as he had been for the last decade or more. Unwilling to wrestle with the complexities of dividing up the going concern, the owners issued a press release on January 25, 2001, announcing the immediate closure of the business.

The &quot;BattleTech&quot; and &quot;Shadowrun&quot; properties were sold to WizKids, who in turn licensed their publication to FanPro LLC and then to Catalyst Game Labs. The &quot;Earthdawn&quot; license was sold to WizKids, and then back to FASA. Living Room Games published &quot;Earthdawn&quot; (Second Edition), RedBrick published &quot;Earthdawn&quot; (Classic and Third Editions), but the license has now returned to FASA Corporation, and FASA Games, Inc. is the current license holder for new material. &quot;Crimson Skies&quot; was originally developed by Zipper Interactive under the FASA Interactive brand in late 2000 and used under license by FASA; FASA Interactive had been purchased by Microsoft, so rights to &quot;Crimson Skies&quot; stayed with Microsoft. Rights to the miniatures game &quot;&quot; reverted to the designer Mike &quot;Skuzzy&quot; Nielsen, but it has not been republished in any form due partly to legal difficulties. Microsoft officially closed the FASA team in the company&#x27;s gaming division on September 12, 2007.

On December 6, 2007, FASA founder Jordan Weisman announced that his new venture, Smith &amp; Tinker, had licensed the electronic gaming rights to &quot;MechWarrior&quot;, &quot;Shadowrun&quot;, and &quot;Crimson Skies&quot; from Microsoft.

On April 28, 2008, Mike &quot;Skuzzy&quot; Nielsen announced plans to create &quot; 2.0&quot;.

At Gen Con 2012, FASA Games, Inc. was revealed, which includes FASA Corporation co-founder Ross Babcock on the board of directors. While FASA Corporation still owns and manages the FASA IP and brands, FASA Games, Inc would release new games and content.

<doc id="11759" wikidata="Q151432" url="?curid=11759" title="McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II">
<text>The McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II is an American tandem two-seat, twin-engine, all-weather, long-range supersonic jet interceptor and fighter-bomber that was developed by McDonnell Aircraft for the United States Navy. It entered service with the Navy in 1961, then was adopted by the United States Marine Corps and the United States Air Force, and within a few years became a major part of their air arms. A total of 5,195 Phantoms were built from 1958 to 1981, making it the most-produced American supersonic military aircraft in history and a signature combat aircraft of the Cold War.

The Phantom is a large fighter with a top speed of over Mach¬†2.2. It can carry more than 18,000 pounds (8,400¬†kg) of weapons on nine external hardpoints, including air-to-air missiles, air-to-ground missiles, and various bombs. Like other interceptors of its time, the F-4 was initially designed without an internal cannon, but some later models incorporated an internal M61 Vulcan rotary cannon. Beginning in 1959, it set 15 world records for in-flight performance, including an absolute speed record and an absolute altitude record.

The F-4 was used extensively during the Vietnam War, first as the principal air superiority fighter for the U.S. Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps, and later as a ground-attack and aerial reconnaissance aircraft. During the Vietnam War, all five American servicemen who became acesone U.S. Air Force pilot and two weapon systems officers (WSOs), one U.S. Navy pilot and one radar intercept officer (RIO)did so in F-4s. The Phantom remained a major part of U.S. military air power into the 1980s, when it was gradually replaced by more modern aircraft such as the F-15 Eagle and F-16 Fighting Falcon in the U.S. Air Force, the F-14 Tomcat in the U.S. Navy, and the F/A-18 Hornet in the U.S. Navy and U.S. Marine Corps.

The Phantom was used for reconnaissance and Wild Weasel (Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses) missions in the 1991 Gulf War, and finally left combat service in 1996. It was the only aircraft used by both U.S. flight demonstration teams: the United States Air Force Thunderbirds (F-4E) and the United States Navy Blue Angels (F-4J). The was also operated by the armed forces of 11 other nations. Israeli Phantoms saw extensive combat in several Arab‚ÄìIsraeli conflicts, while Iran used its large fleet of Phantoms, acquired before the fall of the Shah, in the Iran‚ÄìIraq War. The F-4 remains in active service with the air forces of Iran, Greece, and Turkey. The aircraft has most recently been in service against the Islamic State group in the Middle East.

== Development ==
=== Origins ===
In 1952, McDonnell&#x27;s Chief of Aerodynamics, Dave Lewis, was appointed by CEO Jim McDonnell to be the company&#x27;s preliminary design manager. With no new aircraft competitions on the horizon, internal studies concluded the Navy had the greatest need for a new and different aircraft type: an attack fighter.
In 1953, McDonnell Aircraft began work on revising its F3H Demon naval fighter, seeking expanded capabilities and better performance. The company developed several projects, including a variant powered by a Wright J67 engine, and variants powered by two Wright J65 engines, or two General Electric J79 engines. The J79-powered version promised a top speed of Mach¬†1.97. On 19 September 1953, McDonnell approached the United States Navy with a proposal for the &quot;Super Demon&quot;. Uniquely, the aircraft was to be modular, as it could be fitted with one- or two-seat noses for different missions, with different nose cones to accommodate radar, photo cameras, four 20¬†mm (.79¬†in) cannon, or 56 FFAR unguided rockets in addition to the nine hardpoints under the wings and the fuselage. The Navy was sufficiently interested to order a full-scale mock-up of the F3H-G/H, but felt that the upcoming Grumman XF9F-9 and Vought XF8U-1 already satisfied the need for a supersonic fighter.

The McDonnell design was therefore reworked into an all-weather fighter-bomber with 11 external hardpoints for weapons and on 18 October 1954, the company received a letter of intent for two YAH-1 prototypes. Then on 26 May 1955, four Navy officers arrived at the McDonnell offices and, within an hour, presented the company with an entirely new set of requirements. Because the Navy already had the Douglas A-4 Skyhawk for ground attack and F-8 Crusader for dogfighting, the project now had to fulfill the need for an all-weather fleet defense interceptor. A second crewman was added to operate the powerful radar; designers believed that air combat in the next war would overload solo pilots with information.

===XF4H-1 prototype===
The XF4H-1 was designed to carry four semi-recessed AAM-N-6 Sparrow III radar-guided missiles, and to be powered by two J79-GE-8 engines. As in the McDonnell F-101 Voodoo, the engines sat low in the fuselage to maximize internal fuel capacity and ingested air through fixed geometry intakes. The thin-section wing had a leading edge sweep of 45¬∞ and was equipped with blown flaps for better low-speed handling.

Wind tunnel testing had revealed lateral instability, requiring the addition of 5¬∞ dihedral to the wings. To avoid redesigning the titanium central section of the aircraft, McDonnell engineers angled up only the outer portions of the wings by 12¬∞, which averaged to the required 5¬∞ over the entire wingspan. The wings also received the distinctive &quot;dogtooth&quot; for improved control at high angles of attack. The all-moving tailplane was given 23¬∞ of anhedral to improve control at high angles of attack, while still keeping the tailplane clear of the engine exhaust. In addition, air intakes were equipped with one fixed ramp and one variable geometry ramp with angle scheduled to give maximum pressure recovery between Mach 1.4 and Mach 2.2. Airflow matching between the inlet and engine was achieved by bypassing the engine as secondary air into the exhaust nozzle. All-weather intercept capability was achieved with the AN/APQ-50 radar. To meet requirements for carrier operations, the landing gear was designed to withstand landings with a maximum sink rate of , while the nose strut could extend by to increase angle of attack on the catapult portion of a takeoff.
On 25 July 1955, the Navy ordered two XF4H-1 test aircraft and five YF4H-1 pre-production examples. The Phantom made its maiden flight on 27 May 1958 with Robert C. Little at the controls. A hydraulic problem precluded the retraction of the landing gear, but subsequent flights went more smoothly. Early testing resulted in redesign of the air intakes, including the distinctive addition of 12,500 holes to &quot;bleed off&quot; the slow-moving boundary layer air from the surface of each intake ramp. Series production aircraft also featured splitter plates to divert the boundary layer away from the engine intakes. The aircraft was soon in competition with the XF8U-3 Crusader III. Due to cockpit workload, the Navy wanted a two-seat aircraft and on 17 December 1958 the F4H was declared the winner. Delays with the J79-GE-8 engines meant that the first production aircraft were fitted with J79-GE-2 and ‚àí2A engines, each having 16,100¬†lbf (71.8¬†kN) of afterburning thrust. In 1959, the Phantom began carrier suitability trials with the first complete launch-recovery cycle performed on 15 February 1960 from .

There were proposals to name the F4H &quot;Satan&quot; and &quot;Mithras&quot;. In the end, the aircraft was given the less controversial name &quot;Phantom II&quot;, the first &quot;Phantom&quot; being another McDonnell jet fighter, the FH-1 Phantom. The Phantom II was briefly given the designation F-110A and named &quot;Spectre&quot; by the USAF and the Tri-Service aircraft designation system, F-4, was adopted in September 1962.

===Production===
Early in production, the radar was upgraded to the Westinghouse AN/APQ-72, an AN/APQ-50 with a larger radar antenna, necessitating the bulbous nose, and the canopy was reworked to improve visibility and make the rear cockpit less claustrophobic. During its career the Phantom underwent many changes in the form of numerous variants developed.

The USN operated the F4H-1 (re-designated F-4A in 1962) with J79-GE-2 and -2A engines of 16,100¬†lbf (71.62¬†kN) thrust and later builds receiving -8 engines. A total of 45 F-4As were built; none saw combat, and most ended up as test or training aircraft. The USN and USMC received the first definitive Phantom, the F-4B which was equipped with the Westinghouse APQ-72 radar (pulse only), a Texas Instruments AAA-4 Infrared search and track pod under the nose, an AN/AJB-3 bombing system and powered by J79-GE-8,-8A and -8B engines of 10,900¬†lbf (48.5¬†kN) dry and 16,950¬†lbf (75.4¬†kN) afterburner (reheat) with the first flight on 25 March 1961. 649 F-4Bs were built with deliveries beginning in 1961 and VF-121 &quot;Pacemakers&quot; receiving the first examples at NAS Miramar.

The USAF received Phantoms as the result of Defense Secretary Robert McNamara&#x27;s push to create a unified fighter for all branches of the US military. After an F-4B won the &quot;Operation Highspeed&quot; fly-off against the Convair F-106 Delta Dart, the USAF borrowed two Naval F-4Bs, temporarily designating them F-110A in January 1962, and developed requirements for their own version. Unlike the US Navy&#x27;s focus on air-to-air interception in the Fleet Air Defense (FAD) mission, the USAF emphasized both an air-to-air and an air-to-ground fighter-bomber role. With McNamara&#x27;s unification of designations on 18 September 1962, the Phantom became the F-4 with the naval version designated F-4B and USAF F-4C. The first Air Force Phantom flew on 27 May 1963, exceeding Mach¬†2 on its maiden flight.
The F-4J improved both air-to-air and ground-attack capability; deliveries begun in 1966 and ended in 1972 with 522 built. It was equipped with J79-GE-10 engines with 17,844¬†lbf (79.374¬†kN) thrust, the Westinghouse AN/AWG-10 Fire Control System (making the F-4J the first fighter in the world with operational look-down/shoot-down capability), a new integrated missile control system and the AN/AJB-7 bombing system for expanded ground attack capability.

The F-4N (updated F-4Bs) with smokeless engines and F-4J aerodynamic improvements started in 1972 under a U.S. Navy-initiated refurbishment program called &quot;Project Bee Line&quot; with 228 converted by 1978. The F-4S model resulted from the refurbishment of 265 F-4Js with J79-GE-17 smokeless engines of 17,900¬†lbf (79.379¬†kN), AWG-10B radar with digitized circuitry for improved performance and reliability, Honeywell AN/AVG-8 Visual Target Acquisition Set or VTAS (world&#x27;s first operational Helmet Sighting System), classified avionics improvements, airframe reinforcement and leading edge slats for enhanced maneuvering. The USMC also operated the RF-4B with reconnaissance cameras with 46 built; the RF-4B flew alone and unarmed, with a requirement to fly straight and level at 5,000 feet while taking photographs. They relied on the shortcomings of the anti-aircraft defenses to survive as they were unable to make evasive maneuvers.

Phantom II production ended in the United States in 1979 after 5,195 had been built (5,057 by McDonnell Douglas and 138 in Japan by Mitsubishi). Of these, 2,874 went to the USAF, 1,264 to the Navy and Marine Corps, and the rest to foreign customers. The last U.S.-built F-4 went to South Korea, while the last F-4 built was an F-4EJ built by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries in Japan and delivered on 20 May 1981. As of 2008, 631 Phantoms were in service worldwide, while the Phantoms were in use as a target drone (specifically QF-4Cs) operated by the U.S. military until 21 December 2016, when the Air Force officially ended use of the type.

===World records===
To show off their new fighter, the Navy led a series of record-breaking flights early in Phantom development: All in all, the Phantom set 16 world records. Five of the speed records remained unbeaten until the F-15 Eagle appeared in 1975.
* Operation Top Flight: On 6 December 1959, the second XF4H-1 performed a zoom climb to a world record 98,557¬†ft (30,040¬†m). Commander Lawrence E. Flint Jr., USN accelerated his aircraft to at 47,000¬†ft (14,330¬†m) and climbed to 90,000¬†ft (27,430¬†m) at a 45¬∞ angle. He then shut down the engines and glided to the peak altitude. As the aircraft fell through 70,000¬†ft (21,300¬†m), Flint restarted the engines and resumed normal flight.
* On 5 September 1960, an F4H-1 averaged 1,216.78¬†mph (1,958.16¬†km/h) over a 500¬†km (311¬†mi) closed-circuit course.
* On 25 September 1960, an F4H-1F averaged 1,390.24¬†mph (2,237.37¬†km/h) over a 100¬†km (62.1¬†mi) closed-circuit course. FAIRecord File Number 8898.
* Operation LANA: To celebrate the 50th anniversary of Naval aviation (L is the Roman numeral for 50 and ANA stood for Anniversary of Naval Aviation) on 24 May 1961, Phantoms flew across the continental United States in under three hours and included several tanker refuelings. The fastest of the aircraft averaged 869.74¬†mph (1,400.28¬†km/h) and completed the trip in 2¬†hours 47¬†minutes, earning the pilot (and future NASA Astronaut), Lieutenant Richard Gordon, USN and RIO, Lieutenant Bobbie Young, USN, the 1961 Bendix trophy.
* Operation Sageburner: On 28 August 1961, a F4H-1F Phantom II averaged 1,452.777 kilometers per hour (902.714 miles per hour) over a 3¬†mi (4.82¬†km) course flying below at all times. Commander J.L. Felsman, USN was killed during the first attempt at this record on 18 May 1961 when his aircraft disintegrated in the air after pitch damper failure.
* Operation Skyburner: On 22 November 1961, a modified Phantom with water injection, piloted by Lt. Col. Robert B. Robinson, set an absolute world record average speed over a 20-mile (32.2¬†km) long 2-way straight course of 1,606.342¬†mph (2,585.086¬†km/h).
* On 5 December 1961, another Phantom set a sustained altitude record of .
* Project High Jump: A series of time-to-altitude records was set in early 1962: 34.523 seconds to , 48.787 seconds to , 61.629 seconds to , 77.156 seconds to , 114.548 seconds to , 178.5 s to , 230.44 s to , and 371.43 s to . All High Jump records were set by F4H-1 production number 108 (Bureau Number 148423). Two of the records were set by future distinguished NASA astronaut LCdr John Young.

==Design==

===Overview===
The F-4 Phantom is a tandem-seat fighter-bomber designed as a carrier-based interceptor to fill the U.S. Navy&#x27;s fleet defense fighter role. Innovations in the F-4 included use of pulse-doppler radar (only on late variants such as the F-4F) and extensive use of titanium in its airframe.

Despite imposing dimensions and a maximum takeoff weight of over 60,000¬†lb (27,000¬†kg), the F-4 has a top speed of Mach¬†2.23 and an initial climb rate of over 41,000¬†ft/min (210¬†m/s). The F-4&#x27;s nine external hardpoints have a capability of up to 18,650 pounds (8,480¬†kg) of weapons, including air-to-air and air-to-surface missiles, and unguided, guided, and thermonuclear weapons. Like other interceptors of its day, the F-4 was designed without an internal cannon.

The baseline performance of a Mach¬†2-class fighter with long range and a bomber-sized payload would be the template for the next generation of large and light/middle-weight fighters optimized for daylight air combat.

===Flight characteristics===
&quot;Speed is life&quot; was F-4 pilots&#x27; slogan, as the Phantom&#x27;s greatest advantage in air combat was acceleration and thrust, which permitted a skilled pilot to engage and disengage from the fight at will. MiGs usually could outturn the F-4 because of the high drag on the Phantom&#x27;s airframe; as a massive fighter aircraft designed to fire radar-guided missiles from beyond visual range, the F-4 lacked the agility of its Soviet opponents and was subject to adverse yaw during hard maneuvering. Although the F-4 was subject to irrecoverable spins during aileron rolls, pilots reported the aircraft to be very responsive and easy to fly on the edge of its performance envelope. In 1972, the F-4E model was upgraded with leading edge slats on the wing, greatly improving high angle of attack maneuverability at the expense of top speed.
The J79 had a reduced time lag between the pilot advancing the throttle, from idle to maximum thrust, and the engine producing maximum thrust compared to earlier engines. While landing on John Chesire&#x27;s tailhook missed the arresting gear as he (mistakenly) reduced thrust to idle. He then slammed the throttle to full afterburner, the engine&#x27;s response time being enough to return to full thrust quickly, and he was able get the Phantom airborne again successfully (bolter). The J79 produced noticeable amounts of black smoke (at mid-throttle/cruise settings), a severe disadvantage in that it made it easier for the enemy to spot the aircraft. Two decades after the aircraft entered service this was solved on the F-4S, which was fitted with the ‚àí10A engine variant with a smokeless combustor.

The lack of an internal gun &quot;was the biggest mistake on the F-4&quot;, Chesire said; &quot;Bullets are cheap and tend to go where you aim them. I needed a gun, and I really wished I had one.&quot; Marine Corps General John R. Dailey recalled that &quot;everyone in RF-4s wished they had a gun on the aircraft.&quot; For a brief period, doctrine held that turning combat would be impossible at supersonic speeds and little effort was made to teach pilots air combat maneuvering. In reality, engagements quickly became subsonic, as pilots would slow down in an effort to get behind their adversaries. Furthermore, the relatively new heat-seeking and radar-guided missiles at the time were frequently reported as unreliable and pilots had to fire multiple missiles just to hit one enemy fighter. To compound the problem, rules of engagement in Vietnam precluded long-range missile attacks in most instances, as visual identification was normally required. Many pilots found themselves on the tail of an enemy aircraft, but too close to fire short-range Falcons or Sidewinders. Although by 1965 USAF F-4Cs began carrying SUU-16 external gunpods containing a 20¬†mm (.79¬†in) M61A1 Vulcan Gatling cannon, USAF cockpits were not equipped with lead-computing gunsights until the introduction of the SUU-23, virtually assuring a miss in a maneuvering fight. Some Marine Corps aircraft carried two pods for strafing. In addition to the loss of performance due to drag, combat showed the externally mounted cannon to be inaccurate unless frequently boresighted, yet far more cost-effective than missiles. The lack of a cannon was finally addressed by adding an internally mounted 20¬†mm (.79¬†in) M61A1 Vulcan on the F-4E.

==Operational history==
===United States Navy===
On 30 December 1960, VF-121 &quot;Pacemakers&quot; at NAS Miramar became the first Phantom operator with its F4H-1Fs (F-4As). The VF-74 &quot;Be-devilers&quot; at NAS Oceana became the first deployable Phantom squadron when it received its F4H-1s (F-4Bs) on 8 July 1961. The squadron completed carrier qualifications in October 1961 and Phantom&#x27;s first full carrier deployment between August 1962 and March 1963 aboard . The second deployable U.S. Atlantic Fleet squadron to receive F-4Bs was the VF-102 &quot;Diamondbacks&quot;, who promptly took their new aircraft on the shakedown cruise of . The first deployable U.S. Pacific Fleet squadron to receive the F-4B was the VF-114 &quot;Aardvarks&quot;, which participated in the September 1962 cruise aboard .

By the time of the Tonkin Gulf incident, 13 of 31 deployable navy squadrons were armed with the type. F-4Bs from made the first Phantom combat sortie of the Vietnam War on 5 August 1964, flying bomber escort in Operation Pierce Arrow. Navy fighter pilots were unused to flying with a non-pilot RIO, but learned from air combat in Vietnam the benefits of the GiB &quot;guy in back&quot; or &quot;voice in the luggage compartment&quot; helping with the workload. The first Phantom air-to-air victory of the war took place on 9 April 1965 when an F-4B from VF-96 &quot;Fighting Falcons&quot; piloted by Lieutenant (junior grade) Terence M. Murphy and his RIO, Ensign Ronald Fegan, shot down a Chinese MiG-17. The Phantom was then shot down, probably by an AIM-7 Sparrow from one of its wingmen. There continues to be controversy over whether the Phantom was shot down by MiG guns or, as enemy reports later indicated, an AIM-7 Sparrow III from one of Murphy&#x27;s and Fegan&#x27;s wingmen. On 17 June 1965, an F-4B from VF-21 &quot;Freelancers&quot; piloted by Commander Louis Page and Lieutenant John C. Smith shot down the first North Vietnamese MiG of the war.

On 10 May 1972, Lieutenant Randy &quot;Duke&quot; Cunningham and Lieutenant (junior grade) William P. Driscoll flying an F-4J, call sign &quot;Showtime 100&quot;, shot down three MiG-17s to become the first American flying aces of the war. Their fifth victory was believed at the time to be over a mysterious North Vietnamese ace, Colonel Nguyen Toon, now considered mythical. On the return flight, the Phantom was damaged by an enemy surface-to-air missile. To avoid being captured, Cunningham and Driscoll flew their burning aircraft using only the rudder and afterburner (the damage to the aircraft rendered conventional control nearly impossible), until they could eject over water.
During the war, U.S. Navy F-4 Phantom squadrons participated in 84 combat tours with F-4Bs, F-4Js, and F-4Ns. The Navy claimed 40 air-to-air victories at a cost of 73 Phantoms lost in combat (seven to enemy aircraft, 13 to SAMs and 53 to AAA). An additional 54 Phantoms were lost in mishaps.

In 1984, all Navy F-4Ns were retired from Fleet service in deployable USN squadrons and by 1987 the last F-4Ss were retired from deployable USN squadrons. On 25 March 1986, an F-4S belonging to the VF-151 &quot;Vigilantes&quot;, became the last active duty U.S. Navy Phantom to launch from an aircraft carrier, in this case, &quot;Midway&quot;. On 18 October 1986, an F-4S from the VF-202 &quot;Superheats&quot;, a Naval Reserve fighter squadron, made the last-ever Phantom carrier landing while operating aboard . In 1987, the last of the Naval Reserve-operated F-4S aircraft were replaced by F-14As. The last Phantoms in service with the Navy were QF-4N and QF-4S target drones operated by the Naval Air Warfare Center at NAS Point Mugu, California. These were subsequently retired in 2004.

===United States Marine Corps===
The Marine Corps received its first F-4Bs in June 1962, with the &quot;Black Knights&quot; of VMFA-314 at Marine Corps Air Station El Toro, California becoming the first operational squadron. Marine Phantoms of VMFA-323, flying from Puerto Rico, provided air cover during Operation Power Pack for the evacuation of US citizens from the Dominican Republic and assisted the 508th Infantry Regiment in taking and securing a position east of the Duarte bridge. Marine Phantoms from VMFA-531 &quot;Grey Ghosts&quot; were assigned to Da Nang Air Base on South Vietnam&#x27;s northeast coast on 10 May 1965 and were initially assigned to provide air defense for the USMC. They soon began close air support missions (CAS) and VMFA-314, VMFA-232 &quot;Red Devils&quot;, VMFA-323 &quot;Death Rattlers&quot; and VMFA-542 &quot;Tigers&quot; soon arrived at the primitive airfield. Marine F-4 pilots claimed three enemy MiGs (two while on exchange duty with the USAF) at the cost of 75 aircraft lost in combat, mostly to ground fire, and four in accidents.

Marine Phantoms from VMFA-323 and VMFA-531 operating from the participated in Operation Eagle Claw, the attempted rescue of American hostages from Iran, with orders to shoot down any Iranian aircraft. The Phantoms were painted with an orange stripe enclosed by two black stripes in order to distinguish the American F-4s from the Iranian F-4s. The operation was called off in the early stages of execution.

The VMCJ-1 &quot;Golden Hawks&quot; (later VMAQ-1 and VMAQ-4 which had the old RM tailcode) flew the first photo recon mission with an RF-4B variant on 3 November 1966 from Da Nang and remained there until 1970 with no RF-4B losses and only one aircraft damaged by anti-aircraft artillery (AAA) fire. VMCJ-2 and VMCJ-3 (now VMAQ-3) provided aircraft for VMCJ-1 in Da Nang and VMFP-3 was formed in 1975 at MCAS El Toro, CA consolidating all USMC RF-4Bs in one unit that became known as &quot;The Eyes of the Corps.&quot; VMFP-3 disestablished in August 1990 after the Advanced Tactical Airborne Reconnaissance System was introduced for the F/A-18D Hornet.

The F-4 continued to equip fighter-attack squadrons in both active and reserve Marine Corps units throughout the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s and into the early 1990s. In the early 1980s, these squadrons began to transition to the F/A-18 Hornet, starting with the same squadron that introduced the F-4 to the Marine Corps, VMFA-314 at MCAS El Toro, California. On 18 January 1992, the last Marine Corps Phantom, an F-4S in the Marine Corps Reserve, was retired by the &quot;Cowboys&quot; of VMFA-112 at NAS Dallas, Texas, after which the squadron was re-equipped with F/A-18 Hornets.

===United States Air Force===
In USAF service, the F-4 was initially designated the F-110A prior to the introduction of the 1962 United States Tri-Service aircraft designation system. The USAF quickly embraced the design and became the largest Phantom user. The first Phantoms that the USAF operated were F-4Bs loaned from the Navy, with 27 jets delivered to the 4453rd Combat Crew Training Wing at MacDill Air Force Base, Florida, in November 1963. The first operational unit was the 12th Tactical Fighter Wing, who received the USAF&#x27;s first F-4Cs in January 1964, achieving initial operational capability (IOC) in October 1964. The first USAF Phantoms to participate in the Vietnam War were F-4Cs from the 45th Tactical Fighter Squadron, who deployed to Ubon Royal Thai Air Force Base, Thailand, in April 1965.

Unlike the U.S. Navy and U.S. Marine Corps, which flew the Phantom with a Naval Aviator (pilot) in the front seat and a naval flight officer as a radar intercept officer (RIO) in the back seat, the USAF initially flew its Phantoms with a rated Air Force Pilot in front and back seats. Pilots usually did not like flying in the back seat; while the GIB, or &quot;guy in back&quot;, could fly and ostensibly land the aircraft, he had fewer flight instruments and a very restricted forward view. The Air Force later assigned a rated Air Force Navigator qualified as a weapon/targeting systems officer (later designated as weapon systems officer or WSO) in the rear seat instead of another pilot.

On 10 July 1965, F-4Cs of the 45th TFS, 15th TFW, scored the USAF&#x27;s first victories against North Vietnamese MiG-17s using AIM-9 Sidewinder air-to-air missiles. On 26 April 1966, an F-4C from the 480th Tactical Fighter Squadron scored the first aerial victory by a U.S. aircrew over a North Vietnamese MiG-21 &quot;Fishbed&quot;. On 24 July 1965, another Phantom from the 45th Tactical Fighter Squadron became the first American aircraft to be downed by an enemy SAM, and on 5 October 1966 an 8th Tactical Fighter Wing F-4C became the first U.S. jet lost to an air-to-air missile, fired by a MiG-21.

On 2 January 1967, F-4Cs of the 8th Tactical Fighter Wing, under the command of Robin Olds, executed Operation Bolo, a response to heavy losses sustained during Operation Rolling Thunder. Olds&#x27; and his flight flew out of Ubon in Thailand and simulated an F-105 strike force. In response, the VPAF sent up MiG-21s to shoot down the Phantoms. The ensuing battle resulted in the VPAF losing half of their MiG-21 fleet with no losses from the American side.

Early aircraft suffered from leaks in wing fuel tanks that required re-sealing after each flight and 85 aircraft were found to have cracks in outer wing ribs and stringers. There were also problems with aileron control cylinders, electrical connectors, and engine compartment fires. Reconnaissance RF-4Cs made their debut in Vietnam on 30 October 1965, flying the hazardous post-strike reconnaissance missions. The USAF Thunderbirds used the F-4E from the 1969 season until 1974.
Although the F-4C was essentially identical to the Navy/Marine Corps F-4B in-flight performance and carried the AIM-9 Sidewinder missiles, USAF-tailored F-4Ds initially arrived in June 1967 equipped with AIM-4 Falcons. However, the Falcon, like its predecessors, was designed to shoot down heavy bombers flying straight and level. Its reliability proved no better than others and its complex firing sequence and limited seeker-head cooling time made it virtually useless in combat against agile fighters. The F-4Ds reverted to using Sidewinders under the &quot;Rivet Haste&quot; program in early 1968, and by 1972 the AIM-7E-2 &quot;Dogfight Sparrow&quot; had become the preferred missile for USAF pilots. Like other Vietnam War Phantoms, the F-4Ds were urgently fitted with radar warning receivers to detect the Soviet-built S-75 Dvina SAMs.

From the initial deployment of the F-4C to Southeast Asia, USAF Phantoms performed both air superiority and ground attack roles, supporting not only ground troops in South Vietnam, but also conducting bombing sorties in Laos and North Vietnam. As the F-105 force underwent severe attrition between 1965 and 1968, the bombing role of the F-4 proportionately increased until after November 1970 (when the last F-105D was withdrawn from combat) it became the primary USAF tactical ordnance delivery system. In October 1972 the first squadron of EF-4C Wild Weasel aircraft deployed to Thailand on temporary duty. The &quot;E&quot; prefix was later dropped and the aircraft was simply known as the F-4C Wild Weasel.
Sixteen squadrons of Phantoms were permanently deployed to Indochina between 1965 and 1973, and 17 others deployed on temporary combat assignments. Peak numbers of combat F-4s occurred in 1972, when 353 were based in Thailand. A total of 445 Air Force Phantom fighter-bombers were lost, 370 in combat and 193 of those over North Vietnam (33 to MiGs, 30 to SAMs and 307 to AAA).

The RF-4C was operated by four squadrons, and of the 83 losses, 72 were in combat including 38 over North Vietnam (seven to SAMs and 65 to AAA). By war&#x27;s end, the U.S. Air Force had lost a total of 528 F-4 and RF-4C Phantoms. When combined with U.S. Navy and Marine Corps losses of 233 Phantoms, 761 F-4/RF-4 Phantoms were lost in the Vietnam War.

On 28 August 1972, Captain Steve Ritchie became the first USAF ace of the war. On 9 September 1972, WSO Capt Charles B. DeBellevue became the highest-scoring American ace of the war with six victories. and WSO Capt Jeffrey Feinstein became the last USAF ace of the war on 13 October 1972. Upon return to the United States, DeBellevue and Feinstein were assigned to undergraduate pilot training (Feinstein was given a vision waiver) and requalified as USAF pilots in the F-4. USAF F-4C/D/E crews claimed 107.5 MiG kills in Southeast Asia (50 by Sparrow, 31 by Sidewinder, five by Falcon, 15.5 by gun, and six by other means).

On 31 January 1972, the 170th Tactical Fighter Squadron, 183d Tactical Fighter Group of the Illinois Air National Guard became the first Air National Guard (ANG) unit to transition to Phantoms from Republic F-84F Thunderstreaks. Phantoms would eventually equip numerous tactical fighter and tactical reconnaissance units in the USAF active, ANG, and Air Force Reserve (AFRES).

On 2 June 1972, a Phantom flying at supersonic speed shot down a MiG-19 over Thud Ridge in Vietnam with its cannon. At a recorded speed of Mach 1.2, Major Phil Handley&#x27;s shoot down was the first and only recorded gun kill while flying at supersonic speeds.

In early December 1989, USAF F-4s, from Clark Air Base, participated in Operation Classic Resolve, President Bush&#x27;s response to the 1989 Philippine coup attempt. The F-4s were ordered to buzz the rebel planes at their base, fire at them if any tried to take off, and shoot them down if they did. The buzzing by the US F-4s soon caused the coup to collapse. On December 2, President Bush reported that on 1 December, US fighter aircraft from Clark Air Base assisted Aquino repel a coup attempt.
On 15 August 1990, 24 F-4G Wild Weasel Vs and six RF-4Cs were deployed to Isa Air Base, Bahrain, for Operation Desert Storm. The F-4G was the only aircraft in the USAF inventory equipped for the Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses (SEAD) role, and was needed to protect coalition aircraft from Iraq&#x27;s extensive air defense system. The RF-4C was the only aircraft equipped with the ultra-long-range KS-127 LOROP (long-range oblique photography) camera and was used for a variety of reconnaissance missions. In spite of flying almost daily missions, only one RF-4C was lost in a fatal accident before the start of hostilities. One F-4G was lost when enemy fire damaged the fuel tanks and the aircraft ran out of fuel near a friendly airbase. The last USAF Phantoms, F-4G Wild Weasel Vs from 561st Fighter Squadron, were retired on 26 March 1996. The last operational flight of the F-4G Wild Weasel was from the 190th Fighter Squadron, Idaho Air National Guard, in April 1996. The last operational USAF/ANG F-4 to land was flown by Maj Mike Webb and Maj Gary Leeder of the Idaho ANG.

====Target drone====
Like the Navy, the Air Force also operated QF-4 target drones, serving with the 82d Aerial Targets Squadron at Tyndall Air Force Base, Florida, and Holloman Air Force Base, New Mexico. Replacing the QF-106, the QF-4 program achieved IOC in 1997, with the last QF-106 being shot down on 20 February 1997. It was expected that the F-4 would remain in the target role with the 82d ATRS until at least 2015, when they would be replaced by early versions of the F-16 Fighting Falcon converted to a QF-16 configuration.
On 19 November 2013, BAE Systems delivered its 314th, and last, QF-4 aerial target to the Air Force. The example, RF-4C &quot;68-0599&quot;, had been in storage for over 20 years before being converted. Over 16 years, BAE had converted 314 F-4 and RF-4 Phantom IIs into QF-4s and QRF-4s, with each aircraft taking six months to adapt. By December 2013, QF-4 and QRF-4 aircraft had flown over 16,000 manned and 600 unmanned training sorties, with 250 unmanned aircraft being shot down in firing exercises. The remaining QF-4s and QRF-4s held their training role until the first of 126 QF-16s were delivered by Boeing. The first QF-16 was delivered to Tyndall AFB in September 2014, achieving IOC on 23 September 2015. The final flight of an Air Force QF-4 from Tyndall AFB took place on 27 May 2015 to Holloman AFB.

After Tyndall AFB ceased operations, the 53d Weapons Evaluation Group at Holloman became the fleet of 22 QF-4s&#x27; last remaining operator. The base continued using them to fly manned test and unmanned live fire test support and Foreign Military Sales testing. The final unmanned flight took place on 17 August 2016, with QF-4E &quot;72-0166&quot; being fired upon by a Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II before returning safely back to Holloman AFB. The type was officially retired from US military service with a four‚Äìship flight at Holloman during an event on 21 December 2016. The last 13 QF-4s were stripped of their systems after 1 January 2017 and transferred to the White Sands Missile Range to be used as static targets. During its career as a target drone, several QF-4s retained the capability to be flown as a manned aircraft and were maintained in historical color schemes, being displayed as part of Air Combat Command&#x27;s Heritage Flight at air shows, base open houses, and other events while serving as non-expendable target aircraft during the week.

===Aerial combat in the Vietnam War===
The USAF and the US Navy had high expectations of the F-4 Phantom, assuming that the massive firepower, the best available on-board radar, the highest speed and acceleration properties, coupled with new tactics, would provide Phantoms with an advantage over the MiGs. However, in confrontations with the lighter MiG-21, F-4s did not always succeed and began to suffer losses. Over the course of the air war in Vietnam, between 3 April 1965 and 8 January 1973, each side would ultimately claim favorable kill ratios.

During the war, U.S. Navy F-4 Phantoms claimed 40 air-to-air victories at a loss of seven Phantoms to enemy aircraft. USMC F-4 pilots claimed three enemy MiGs at the cost of one aircraft in air-combat. USAF F-4 Phantom crews scored MiG kills (including MiG-17s, eight MiG-19s and 66 MiG-21s) at a cost of 33 Phantoms in air-combat. F-4 pilots were credited with a total of MiG kills at a cost of 42 Phantoms in air-combat.

According to the Vietnam People&#x27;s Air Force (VPAF), 103 F-4 Phantoms were shot down by MiG-21s at a cost of 54 MiG-21s downed by F-4s. During the war, the VPAF lost 131 MiGs in air combat (63 MiG-17s, eight MiG-19s and 60 MiG-21s) of which one half were by F-4s.

From 1966 to November 1968, in 46 air battles conducted over North Vietnam between F-4s and MiG-21s, VPAF claimed 27 F-4s were shot down by MiG-21s at a cost of 20 MiG-21s In 1970, one F-4 Phantom was shot down by a MiG-21. The struggle culminated on 10 May 1972, with VPAF aircraft completing 64 sorties, resulting in 15 air battles. The VPAF claimed seven F-4s were shot down, while U.S. confirmed five F-4s were lost. The Phantoms, in turn, managed to destroy two MiG-21s, three MiG-17s, and one MiG-19. On 11 May, two MiG-21s, which played the role of &quot;bait&quot;, brought the four F-4s to two MiG-21s circling at low altitude. The MiGs quickly engaged and shot down two F-4s. On 18 May, Vietnamese aircraft made 26 sorties in eight air engagements, which cost 4 F-4 Phantoms; Vietnamese fighters on that day did not suffer losses.

On 5 August 1967, the USS &quot;Forrestal&quot; was stationed off the Indochina coast to carry out strikes against North Vietnam. An electrical fault caused a Zuni rocket to be fired from an F-4. The rocket struck the fuel tank of an A-4 Skyhawk attack aircraft, starting a fire which quickly spread to other airplanes, setting off several bombs. The fire and explosions killed 134 men and seriously wounded 161 more in what became known as the 1967 USS Forrestal fire.

===Non-U.S. users===
The Phantom has served with the air forces of many countries, including Australia, Egypt, Germany, United Kingdom, Greece, Iran, Israel, Japan, Spain, South Korea and Turkey.

====Australia====
The Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) leased 24 USAF F-4Es from 1970 to 1973 while waiting for their order for the General Dynamics F-111C to be delivered. They were so well-liked that the RAAF considered retaining the aircraft after the F-111Cs were delivered. They were operated from RAAF Amberley by No. 1 Squadron and No. 6 Squadron.

====Egypt====
In 1979, the Egyptian Air Force purchased 35 former USAF F-4Es along with a number of Sparrow, Sidewinder and Maverick missiles from the U.S. for $594¬†million as part of the &quot;Peace Pharaoh&quot; program. An additional seven surplus USAF aircraft were purchased in 1988. Three attrition replacements had been received by the end of the 1990s.

Egyptian F-4Es were retired in 2020, with their former base at Cairo West Air Base being reconfigured for the operation of F-16C/D Fighting Falcons.

====Germany====
The West German air force (&quot;Luftwaffe&quot;) initially ordered the reconnaissance RF-4E in 1969, receiving a total of 88 aircraft from January 1971. In 1973, under the &quot;Peace Rhine&quot; program, the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; purchased 175 units of the F-4F. The ‚ÄúF‚Äù variant was a more agile version of the ‚ÄúE‚Äù, due to its lower weight and slatted wings. However this was achieved at the expense of reduced fuel capacity, and the elimination of AIM-7 Sparrow capability. These purchases made Germany the largest export customer for the Phantom.

In 1975, West Germany also received 10 F-4Es for training in the U.S. In the late 1990s, these were withdrawn from service after being replaced by F-4Fs. In 1982, the initially unarmed RF-4Es were given a secondary ground attack capability; these aircraft were retired in 1994. The F-4F was upgraded in the mid-1980s. West Germany also initiated the Improved Combat Efficiency (ICE) program in 1983. The 110 ICE-upgraded F-4Fs entered service in 1992, and were expected to remain in service until 2012. All the remaining Luftwaffe Phantoms were based at Wittmund with &quot;Jagdgeschwader&quot; 71 (fighter wing 71) in Northern Germany and WTD61 at Manching. A total of 24 German F-4F Phantom IIs were operated by the 49th Tactical Fighter Wing of the USAF at Holloman AFB to train &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; crews until December 2004. Phantoms were deployed to NATO states under the Baltic Air Policing starting in 2005, 2008, 2009, 2011 and 2012. The German Air Force retired its last F-4Fs on 29 June 2013. German F-4Fs flew 279,000 hours from entering service on 31 August 1973 until retirement.

====Greece====
In 1971, the Hellenic Air Force ordered brand new F-4E Phantoms, with deliveries starting in 1974. In the early 1990s, the Hellenic AF acquired surplus RF-4Es and F-4Es from the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; and U.S. ANG. Following the success of the German ICE program, on 11 August 1997, a contract was signed between DASA of Germany and Hellenic Aerospace Industry for the upgrade of 39 aircraft to the very similar &quot;Peace Icarus 2000&quot; standard. On 5 May 2017, the Hellenic Air Force officially retired the RF-4E Phantom II during a public ceremony.

====Iran====
In the 1960s and 1970s when the U.S. and Iran were on friendly terms, the U.S. delivered 225 F-4D, F-4E, and RF-4E Phantoms to Iran, making it the second largest export customer. The Imperial Iranian Air Force saw at least one engagement, resulting in a loss, after an RF-4C was rammed by a Soviet MiG-21 during Project Dark Gene, an ELINT operation during the Cold War.

The Islamic Republic of Iran Air Force Phantoms saw heavy action in the Iran‚ÄìIraq War in the 1980s and were kept operational by overhaul and servicing from Iran&#x27;s aerospace industry. Notable operations of Iranian F-4s during the war included Operation Scorch Sword, an attack by two F-4s against the Iraqi Osirak nuclear reactor site near Baghdad on 30 September 1980, and the attack on H3, a 4 April 1981 strike by eight Iranian F-4s against the H-3 complex of air bases in the far west of Iraq, which resulted in many Iraqi aircraft being destroyed or damaged for no Iranian losses.

On 5 June 1984, two Saudi Arabian fighter pilots shot down two Iranian F-4 fighters. The Royal Saudi Air Force pilots were flying American-built F-15s and fired air-to-air missiles to bring down the Iranian planes. The Saudi fighter pilots had Boeing KC-135 Stratotanker planes and Boeing E-3 Sentry AWACS surveillance planes assist in the encounter. The aerial fight occurred in Saudi airspace over the Persian Gulf near the Saudi island Al Arabiyah, about 60 miles northeast of Jubail.

Iranian F-4s were in use as of late 2014; the aircraft reportedly conducted air strikes on ISIS targets in the eastern Iraqi province of Diyala.

====Israel====
The Israeli Air Force acquired between 212 and 222 newly built and ex-USAF aircraft, and modified several as one-off special reconnaissance variants. The first F-4Es, nicknamed &quot;&quot;Kurnass&quot; (Sledgehammer), and RF-4Es, nicknamed &quot;Orev&quot;&quot; (Raven), were delivered in 1969 under the &quot;Peace Echo I&quot; program. Additional Phantoms arrived during the 1970s under &quot;Peace Echo II&quot; through &quot;Peace Echo V&quot; and &quot;Nickel Grass&quot; programs. Israeli Phantoms saw extensive combat during Arab‚ÄìIsraeli conflicts, first seeing action during the War of Attrition. In the 1980s, Israel began the &quot;Kurnass 2000&quot; modernization program which significantly updated avionics. The last Israeli F-4s were retired in 2004.

====Japan====
From 1968, the Japan Air Self-Defense Force (JASDF) purchased a total of 140 F-4EJ Phantoms without aerial refueling, AGM-12 Bullpup missile system, nuclear control system or ground attack capabilities. Mitsubishi built 138 under license in Japan and 14 unarmed reconnaissance RF-4Es were imported. One of the aircraft (&quot;17-8440&quot;) was the last of the 5,195 F-4 Phantoms to be produced. It was manufactured by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries on 21 May 1981. &quot;The Final Phantom&quot; served with 306th Tactical Fighter Squadron and later transferred to the 301st Tactical Fighter Squadron.
Of these, 96 F-4EJs were modified to the F-4EJ standard. 15 F-4EJ and F-4EJ &quot;Kai&quot; were converted to reconnaissance aircraft designated RF-4EJ. Japan had a fleet of 90 F-4s in service in 2007. After studying several replacement fighters the F-35A Lightning II was chosen in 2011. The 302nd Tactical Fighter Squadron became the first JASDF F-35 Squadron at Misawa Air Base when it converted from the F-4EJ &quot;Kai&quot; on 29 March 2019. The JASDF&#x27;s sole aerial reconnaissance unit, the 501st Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron, retired their RF-4Es and RF-4EJs on 9 March 2020, and the unit itself dissolved on 26 March.

The 301st Tactical Fighter Squadron then became the sole user of the F-4EJ in the Air Defense Command, with their retirement originally scheduled in 2021 along with the unit&#x27;s transition to the F-35A. However, on 20 November 2020, the 301st Tactical Fighter Squadron announced the earlier retirement of their remaining F-4EJs, concluding the Phantom&#x27;s long-running career in the JASDF Air Defense Command. Although retirement was announced, the 301st TFS continued operations up until 10 December 2020, with the squadron&#x27;s Phantoms being decommissioned on 14 December. Two F-4EJs and a F-4EJ &quot;Kai&quot; continued to be operated by the Air Development and Test Wing in Gifu Prefecture until their retirement on 17 March 2021, marking an end of Phantom operations in Japan.

====South Korea====
The Republic of Korea Air Force received its first batch of used USAF F-4D Phantoms in 1969 under the &quot;Peace Spectator&quot; program. The F-4Ds continued to be delivered until 1988. The &quot;Peace Pheasant II&quot; program also provided new-built and former USAF F-4Es. In 1975, South Korea fundraised to buy five new F-4 Phantoms with the money donated from South Korean citizens in a national fundraising drive set up to buy the jets (a necessity at the time as South Korea was a poor country and in the aftermath of the Korean War, needed the extra jets to defend against North Korea which had a larger air force back then). In total, the ROKAF operated 92 F-4Ds, 27 RF-4Cs, and 103 F-4Es. The last ROKAF F-4Es were retired on 7 June 2024.

====Spain====
The Spanish Air Force acquired its first batch of ex-USAF F-4C Phantoms in 1971 under the &quot;Peace Alfa&quot; program. Designated C.12, the aircraft were retired in 1989. At the same time, the air arm received a number of ex-USAF RF-4Cs, designated CR.12. In 1995‚Äì1996, these aircraft received extensive avionics upgrades. Spain retired its RF-4s in 2002.

====Turkey====
The Turkish Air Force (TAF) received 40 F-4Es in 1974, with a further 32 F-4Es and 8 RF-4Es in 1977‚Äì78 under the &quot;Peace Diamond III&quot; program, followed by 40 ex-USAF aircraft in &quot;Peace Diamond IV&quot; in 1987, and a further 40 ex-U.S. Air National Guard Aircraft in 1991. A further 32 RF-4Es were transferred to Turkey after being retired by the Luftwaffe between 1992 and 1994. In 1995, Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI) implemented an upgrade similar to Kurnass 2000 on 54 Turkish F-4Es which were dubbed the F-4E 2020 Terminator. Turkish F-4s, and more modern F-16s have been used to strike Kurdish PKK bases in ongoing military operations in Northern Iraq. On 22 June 2012, a Turkish RF-4E was shot down by Syrian air defenses while flying a reconnaissance flight near the Turkish-Syrian border. Turkey has stated the reconnaissance aircraft was in international airspace when it was shot down, while Syrian authorities stated it was inside Syrian airspace. Turkish F-4s remained in use as of 2020, and it plans to fly them at least until 2030.

On 24 February 2015, two RF-4Es crashed in the Malatya region in the southeast of Turkey, under yet unknown circumstances, killing both crew of two each. On 5 March 2015, an F-4E-2020 crashed in central Anatolia killing both crew. After the recent accidents, the TAF withdrew RF-4Es from active service. Turkey was reported to have used F-4 jets to attack PKK separatists and the ISIS capital on 19 September 2015. The Turkish Air Force has reportedly used the F-4E 2020s against the more recent Third Phase of the PKK conflict on heavy bombardment missions into Iraq on 15 November 2015, 12 January 2016, and 12 March 2016.

====United Kingdom====

The United Kingdom bought versions based on the U.S. Navy&#x27;s F-4J for use with the Royal Air Force and the Royal Navy&#x27;s Fleet Air Arm. The UK was the only country outside the United States to operate the Phantom at sea, with them operating from . The main differences were the use of the British Rolls-Royce Spey engines and of British-made avionics. The RN and RAF versions were given the designation F-4K and F-4M respectively, and entered service with the British military aircraft designations Phantom FG.1 (fighter/ground attack) and Phantom FGR.2 (fighter/ground attack/reconnaissance).

Initially, the FGR.2 was used in the ground attack and reconnaissance role, primarily with RAF Germany, while 43 Squadron was formed in the air defense role using the FG.1s that had been intended for the Fleet Air Arm for use aboard . The superiority of the Phantom over the English Electric Lightning in terms of both range and weapons system capability, combined with the successful introduction of the SEPECAT Jaguar, meant that, during the mid-1970s, most of the ground attack Phantoms in Germany were redeployed to the UK to replace air defense Lightning squadrons. A second RAF squadron, 111 Squadron, was formed on the FG.1 in 1979 after the disbandment of 892 NAS.

In 1982, during the Falklands War, three Phantom FGR2s of No. 29 Squadron were on active Quick Reaction Alert duty on Ascension Island to protect the base from air attack. After the Falklands War, 15 upgraded ex-USN F-4Js, known as the F-4J(UK) entered RAF service to compensate for one interceptor squadron redeployed to the Falklands.

Around 15 RAF squadrons received various marks of Phantom, many of them based in Germany. The first to be equipped was No. 228 Operational Conversion Unit at RAF Coningsby in August 1968. One noteworthy operator was No. 43 Squadron where Phantom FG1s remained the squadron equipment for 20 years, arriving in September 1969 and departing in July 1989. During this period the squadron was based at Leuchars.

The interceptor Phantoms were replaced by the Panavia Tornado F3 from the late 1980s onwards. Originally to be used until 2003, it was set back to 1992 due to restructuring of the British Armed Forces and the last combat British Phantoms were retired in October 1992 when No. 74(F) Squadron was disbanded. Phantom FG.1 &quot;XT597&quot; was the last British Phantom to be retired on 28 January 1994, it was used as a test jet by the Aeroplane and Armament Experimental Establishment for its whole service life.

===Civilian use===
In 1988, Sandia National Laboratories mounted an F-4 on a &quot;rocket sled&quot;, then crashed it into reinforced concrete to learn about the collision of aircraft with structures such as a nuclear power plant.
An F-4D (civilian registration NX749CF) is operated by the Massachusetts-based non-profit organization Collings Foundation as a &quot;living history&quot; exhibit. Funds to maintain and operate the aircraft, which is based in Houston, Texas, are raised through donations and sponsorships from public and commercial parties.

In the 1960s, NASA used the F-4 to photograph and film Titan II missiles after their launch from Cape Canaveral after finding the Lockheed F-104 Starfighter inadequate. Jack Petry, a retired U.S. Air Force colonel, said he put his F-4 into a Mach 1.2 dive synchronized to the launch countdown, then &quot;walked the [rocket&#x27;s] contrail&quot;. Petry&#x27;s Phantom stayed with the Titan for 90 seconds, reaching 68,000 feet, then broke away as the missile continued into space.

NASA&#x27;s Dryden Flight Research Center acquired an F-4A on 3 December 1965. It made 55 flights flying chase on X-15 missions and lifting body flights. The F-4 also supported a biomedical monitoring program involving 1,000 flights by NASA Flight Research Center aerospace research pilots and students of the USAF Aerospace Research Pilot School flying high-performance aircraft. The pilots were instrumented to record accurate and reliable data of electrocardiogram, respiration rate, and normal acceleration. In 1967, the Phantom supported a brief military-inspired program to determine whether an airplane&#x27;s sonic boom could be directed and whether it could be used as a weapon of sorts, or at least an annoyance. NASA also flew an F-4C in a spanwise blowing study from 1983 to 1985, after which it was returned.

===Nicknames===
The Phantom gathered a number of nicknames during its career. Some of these names included &quot;Snoopy&quot;, &quot;Rhino&quot;, &quot;Double Ugly&quot;, &quot;Old Smokey&quot;, the &quot;Flying Anvil&quot;, &quot;Flying Footlocker&quot;, &quot;Flying Brick&quot;, &quot;Lead Sled&quot;, the &quot;Big Iron Sled&quot;, and the &quot;St. Louis Slugger&quot; (owing to it being produced in St. Louis). In recognition of its record of downing large numbers of Soviet-built MiGs, it was called the &quot;World&#x27;s Leading Distributor of MiG Parts&quot;. As a reflection of excellent performance in spite of its bulk, the F-4 was dubbed &quot;the triumph of thrust over aerodynamics.&quot; German &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; crews called their F-4s the &quot;Eisenschwein&quot; (&quot;Iron Pig&quot;), &quot;Fliegender Ziegelstein&quot; (&quot;Flying Brick&quot;) and &quot;Luftverteidigungsdiesel&quot; (&quot;Air Defense Diesel&quot;). In the RAF it was most commonly referred to as &quot;The Toom&quot; (not tomb). Whilst the Turkish Air Force crewmen nicknamed it as &quot;Baba&quot; (&quot;Father&quot;).

===Reputation===
Imitating the spelling of the aircraft&#x27;s name, McDonnell issued a series of patches. Pilots became &quot;Phantom Phlyers&quot;, backseaters became &quot;Phantom Pherrets&quot;, fans of the F-4 &quot;Phantom Phanatics&quot;, and call it the &quot;Phabulous Phantom&quot;. Ground crewmen who worked on the aircraft are known as &quot;Phantom Phixers&quot;.

Several active websites are devoted to sharing information on the F-4, and the aircraft is grudgingly admired as brutally effective by those who have flown it. Colonel (Ret.) Chuck DeBellevue reminisced, &quot;The F-4 Phantom was the last plane that looked like it was made to kill somebody. It was a beast. It could go through a flock of birds and kick out barbeque from the back.&quot; It had &quot;A reputation of being a clumsy bruiser reliant on brute engine power and obsolete weapons technology.&quot;

===The Spook===
The aircraft&#x27;s emblem is a whimsical cartoon ghost called &quot;The Spook&quot;, which was created by McDonnell Douglas technical artist, Anthony &quot;Tony&quot; Wong, for shoulder patches. The name &quot;Spook&quot; was coined by the crews of either the 12th Tactical Fighter Wing or the 4453rd Combat Crew Training Wing at MacDill AFB. The figure is ubiquitous, appearing on many items associated with the F-4. The Spook has followed the Phantom around the world adopting local fashions; for example, the British adaptation of the U.S. &quot;Phantom Man&quot; is a Spook that sometimes wears a bowler hat and smokes a pipe.

==Aircraft on display==
As a result of its extensive number of operators and large number of aircraft produced, a significant number of F-4 Phantom IIs of a variety of variants have been preserved in museums and other locations around the world.

==Notable accidents==
* On 6 June 1971, Hughes Airwest Flight 706, a McDonnell Douglas DC-9-31 collided in mid-air with a United States Marine Corps F-4B Phantom above the San Gabriel Mountains, while en route from Los Angeles International Airport to Salt Lake City. All 49 on board the DC-9 were killed, while the pilot of the F-4B was unable to eject and died when the aircraft crashed shortly afterwards. The F-4B&#x27;s Radar Intercept Officer successfully ejected from the plane and parachuted to safety, being the sole survivor of the incident.
* On 9 August 1974, a Royal Air Force Phantom FGR2 was involved in a fatal collision with a civilian PA-25-235 Pawnee crop-sprayer over Norfolk, England.
* On 17 August 1978, during a training exercise of the Mediterranean Sea, a US Navy F-4 shot down another US Navy F-4 with an AIM-9H. The pilots of the downed aircraft ejected and were recovered.
* On 21 March 1987, Captain Dean Paul Martin, a pilot in the 163d Tactical Fighter Group of the California Air National Guard and son of entertainer Dean Martin, crashed his F-4C into San Gorgonio Mountain, California, shortly after departure from March Air Force Base. Both Martin and his weapon systems officer (WSO) Captain Ramon Ortiz were killed.
* On 22 September 1987, a US Air Force RF-4C Phantom II was shot down by a US Navy F-14 Tomcat during training NATO Exercise Display Determination 87 over the Mediterranean. The RF-4C was conducting a simulated attack on when the F-14 pilot became confused and launched a live AIM-9 Sidewinder. The RF-4C crew ejected and were recovered.
* On 30 January 2023, a Greek Air Force F-4E Phantom II crashed into the Ionian Sea. The aircraft was conducting a training exercise when it crashed 46¬†km south of the Andravida Air Base. The pilot, Captain Efstathios Tsitlakidis, and co-pilot, First Lieutenant Marios Michael Touroutsikas were killed in the crash.

<text>The McDonnell FH Phantom is a twinjet, straight-wing, carrier-based fighter aircraft designed and first flown during late World War II for the United States Navy. As a first-generation jet fighter, the Phantom was the first purely jet-powered aircraft to land on an American aircraft carrier and the first jet deployed by the United States Marine Corps. Although only 62 FH-1s were built it helped prove the viability of carrier-based jet fighters. As McDonnell&#x27;s first successful fighter, it led to the development of the follow-on F2H Banshee, which was one of the two most important naval jet fighters of the Korean War; combined, the two established McDonnell as an important supplier of navy aircraft.

McDonnell chose to bring the name back with the third-generation, Mach 2-capable McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II, the most versatile and widely used Western combat aircraft of the Vietnam War era.

The FH Phantom was originally designated the FD Phantom, but this was changed as the aircraft entered production.

==Design and development==
In early 1943, aviation officials at the United States Navy were impressed with McDonnell&#x27;s audacious XP-67 Bat project. McDonnell was invited by the navy to cooperate in the development of a shipboard jet fighter, using an engine from the turbojets under development by Westinghouse Electric Corporation. Three prototypes were ordered on 30 August 1943 and the designation XFD-1 was assigned. Under the 1922 United States Navy aircraft designation system, the letter &quot;D&quot; before the dash designated the aircraft&#x27;s manufacturer. The Douglas Aircraft Company had previously been assigned this letter, but the USN elected to reassign it to McDonnell because Douglas had not provided any fighters for navy service in years.

McDonnell engineers evaluated a number of engine combinations, varying from eight diameter engines down to two engines of diameter. The final design used the two engines after it was found to be the lightest and simplest configuration. The engines were buried in the wing root to keep intake and exhaust ducts short, offering greater aerodynamic efficiency than underwing nacelles, and the engines were angled slightly outwards to protect the fuselage from the hot exhaust blast. Placement of the engines in the middle of the airframe allowed the cockpit with its bubble-style canopy to be placed ahead of the wing, granting the pilot excellent visibility in all directions. This engine location also freed up space under the nose, allowing designers to use tricycle gear, thereby elevating the engine exhaust path and reducing the risk that the hot blast would damage the aircraft carrier deck. The construction methods and aerodynamic design of the Phantom were fairly conventional for the time; the aircraft had unswept wings, a conventional empennage, and an aluminum monocoque structure with flush riveted aluminum skin. Folding wings were used to reduce the width of the aircraft in storage configuration. Provisions for four .50-caliber (12.7 mm) machine guns were made in the nose, while racks for eight High Velocity Aircraft Rockets could be fitted under the wings, although these were seldom used in service. Adapting a jet to carrier use was a much greater challenge than producing a land-based fighter because of slower landing and takeoff speeds required on a small carrier deck. The Phantom used split flaps on both the folding and fixed wing sections to enhance low-speed landing performance, but no other high-lift devices were used. Provisions were also made for Rocket Assisted Take Off (RATO) bottles to improve takeoff performance.

When the first XFD-1, serial number &quot;48235&quot;, was completed in January 1945, only one Westinghouse 19XB-2B engine was available for installation. Ground runs and taxi tests were conducted with the single engine, and such was the confidence in the aircraft that the first flight on 26 January 1945 was made with only the one turbojet engine. During flight tests, the Phantom became the first U.S. Navy aircraft to exceed 500¬†mph (434 kn, 805¬†km/h). With successful completion of tests, a production contract was awarded on 7 March 1945 for 100 FD-1 aircraft. With the end of the war, the Phantom production contract was reduced to 30 aircraft, but was soon increased back to 60.

The first prototype was lost in a fatal crash on 1 November 1945, but the second and final Phantom prototype (serial number &quot;48236&quot;) was completed early the next year and became the first purely jet-powered aircraft to operate from an American aircraft carrier, completing four successful takeoffs and landings on 21 July 1946, from near Norfolk, Virginia. At the time, she was the largest carrier serving with the U.S. Navy, allowing the aircraft to take off without assistance from a catapult. The second prototype crashed on 26 August 1946.

Production Phantoms incorporated a number of design improvements. These included provisions for a flush-fitting centerline drop tank, an improved gunsight, and the addition of speed brakes. Production models used Westinghouse J30-WE-20 engines with of thrust per engine. The top of the vertical tail had a more square shape than the rounder tail used on the prototypes, and a smaller rudder was used to resolve problems with control surface clearance discovered during test flights. The horizontal tail surfaces were shortened slightly, while the fuselage was stretched by . The amount of framing in the windshield was reduced to enhance pilot visibility.

Halfway through the production run, the navy reassigned the designation letter &quot;D&quot; back to Douglas, with the Phantom being redesignated FH-1. Including the two prototypes, a total of 62 Phantoms were finally produced, with the last FH-1 rolling off the assembly line in May 1948.

Realizing that the production of more powerful jet engines was imminent, McDonnell engineers proposed a more powerful variant of the Phantom while the original aircraft was still under development¬†‚Äì a proposal that would lead to the design of the Phantom&#x27;s replacement, the F2H Banshee. Although the new aircraft was originally envisioned as a modified Phantom, the need for heavier armament, greater internal fuel capacity, and other improvements eventually led to a substantially heavier and bulkier aircraft that shared few parts with its agile predecessor. Despite this, the two aircraft were similar enough that McDonnell was able to complete its first F2H-1 in August 1948, a mere three months after the last FH-1 had rolled off the assembly line.

==Operational history==

The first Phantoms were delivered to USN fighter squadron VF-17A (later redesignated VF-171) in August 1947; the squadron received a full complement of 24 aircraft on 29 May 1948. Beginning in November 1947, Phantoms were delivered to United States Marine Corps squadron VMF-122, making it the first USMC combat squadron to deploy jets. VF-17A became the USN&#x27;s first fully operational jet carrier squadron when it deployed aboard on 5 May 1948.

The Phantom was one of the first jets used by the U.S. military for exhibition flying. Three Phantoms used by the Naval Air Test Center were used by a unique demonstration team called the Gray Angels, whose members consisted entirely of naval aviators holding the rank of rear admiral (Daniel V. Gallery, Apollo Soucek and Edgar A. Cruise.) The team&#x27;s name was an obvious play on the name of the recently formed U.S. Navy Blue Angels, who were still flying propeller-powered Grumman F8F Bearcats at the time. The &quot;Grays&quot; flew in various air shows during the summer of 1947, but the team was abruptly disbanded after their poorly timed arrival at a September air show in Cleveland, Ohio, nearly caused a head-on low-altitude collision with a large formation of other aircraft; their Phantoms were turned over to test squadron VX-3. The VMF-122 Phantoms were later used for air show demonstrations until they were taken out of service in 1949, with the team being known alternately as the Marine Phantoms or the Flying Leathernecks.

The Phantom&#x27;s service as a frontline fighter would be short-lived. Its limited range and light armament¬†‚Äì notably, its inability to carry bombs¬†‚Äì made it best suited for duty as a point-defence interceptor aircraft. However, its speed and rate of climb were only slightly better than existing propeller-powered fighters and fell short of other contemporary jets, such as the Lockheed P-80 Shooting Star, prompting concerns that the Phantom would be outmatched by future enemy jets it might soon face. Moreover, recent experience in World War II had demonstrated the value of naval fighters that could double as fighter-bombers, a capability the Phantom lacked. Finally, the aircraft exhibited some design deficiencies¬†‚Äì its navigational avionics were poor, it could not accommodate newly developed ejection seats, and the location of the machine guns in the upper nose caused pilots to be dazzled by muzzle flash.

The F2H Banshee and Grumman F9F Panther, both of which began flight tests around the time of the Phantom&#x27;s entry into service, better satisfied the navy&#x27;s desire for a versatile, long-range, high-performance jet. Consequently, the FH-1 saw little weapons training, and was primarily used for carrier qualifications to transition pilots from propeller-powered fighters to jets in preparation for flying the Panther or Banshee. In June 1949, VF-171 (VF-17A) re-equipped with the Banshee, and their Phantoms were turned over to VF-172; this squadron, along with the NATC, VX-3, and VMF-122, turned over their Phantoms to the United States Naval Reserve by late 1949 after receiving F2H-1 Banshees. The FH-1 would see training duty with the USNR until being replaced by the F9F Panther in July 1954; none ever saw combat, having been retired from frontline service prior to the outbreak of the Korean War.

===Civilian use===
In 1964, Progressive Aero, Incorporated of Fort Lauderdale, Florida purchased three surplus Phantoms, intending to use them to teach civilians how to fly jets. A pair were stripped of military equipment and restored to flying condition, but the venture was unsuccessful, and the aircraft were soon retired once again.

<text>A fricative is a consonant produced by forcing air through a narrow channel made by placing two articulators close together. These may be the lower lip against the upper teeth, in the case of ; the back of the tongue against the soft palate in the case of German (the final consonant of &quot;Bach&quot;); or the side of the tongue against the molars, in the case of Welsh (appearing twice in the name &quot;Llanelli&quot;). This turbulent airflow is called frication. 

A particular subset of fricatives are the sibilants. When forming a sibilant, one still is forcing air through a narrow channel, but in addition, the tongue is curled lengthwise to direct the air over the edge of the teeth. English , , , and are examples of sibilants.

The usage of two other terms is less standardized: &quot;Spirant&quot; is an older term for fricatives used by some American and European phoneticians and phonologists for non-sibilant fricatives. &quot;Strident&quot; could mean just &quot;sibilant&quot;, but some authors include also labiodental and uvular fricatives in the class.

==Types==
The airflow is not completely stopped in the production of fricative consonants. In other words, the airflow experiences friction.

===Sibilants===
* voiceless coronal sibilant, as in English &quot;s&quot;ip
* voiced coronal sibilant, as in English &quot;z&quot;ip
** voiceless dental sibilant
** voiced dental sibilant
** voiceless apical sibilant
** voiced apical sibilant
** voiceless predorsal sibilant (laminal, with tongue tip at lower teeth)
** voiced predorsal sibilant (laminal)
** voiceless postalveolar sibilant (laminal)
** voiced postalveolar sibilant (laminal)
* voiceless palato-alveolar sibilant (domed, partially palatalized), as in English &quot;sh&quot;ip
* voiced palato-alveolar sibilant (domed, partially palatalized), as the &quot;si&quot; in English vi&quot;si&quot;on
* voiceless alveolo-palatal sibilant (laminal, palatalized)
* voiced alveolo-palatal sibilant (laminal, palatalized)
* voiceless retroflex sibilant (apical or subapical)
* voiced retroflex sibilant (apical or subapical)

All sibilants are coronal, but may be dental, alveolar, postalveolar, or palatal (retroflex) within that range. However, at the postalveolar place of articulation, the tongue may take several shapes: domed, laminal, or apical, and each of these is given a separate symbol and a separate name. Prototypical retroflexes are subapical and palatal, but they are usually written with the same symbol as the apical postalveolars. The alveolars and dentals may also be either apical or laminal, but this difference is indicated with diacritics rather than with separate symbols.

===Central non-sibilant fricatives===
* voiceless bilabial fricative
* voiced bilabial fricative
* voiceless labiodental fricative, as in English &quot;f&quot;ine
* voiced labiodental fricative, as in English &quot;v&quot;ine
* voiceless linguolabial fricative
* voiced linguolabial fricative
* voiceless dental non-sibilant fricative, as in English &quot;th&quot;ing
* voiced dental non-sibilant fricative, as in English &quot;th&quot;at
* voiceless alveolar non-sibilant fricative
* voiced alveolar non-sibilant fricative
* Voiceless alveolar fricative trill
* Voiced alveolar fricative trill
* voiceless palatal fricative
* voiced palatal fricative
* voiceless velar fricative
* voiced velar fricative
* voiceless palatal-velar fricative (articulation disputed)

The IPA also has letters for epiglottal fricatives,
* voiceless epiglottal fricative
* voiced epiglottal fricative
with allophonic trilling, but these might be better analyzed as pharyngeal trills.
* voiceless velopharyngeal fricative (often occurs with a cleft palate)
* voiced velopharyngeal fricative

===Lateral fricatives===
* voiceless dental lateral fricative
* voiced dental lateral fricative
* voiceless alveolar lateral fricative
* voiced alveolar lateral fricative
* voiceless postalveolar lateral fricative (Mehri)
* voiced postalveolar lateral fricative
* or extIPA voiceless retroflex lateral fricative
* or extIPA Voiced retroflex lateral fricative (in Ao)
* or or extIPA voiceless palatal lateral fricative 
* or extIPA voiced palatal lateral fricative (allophonic in Jebero)
* or extIPA voiceless velar lateral fricative 
* or extIPA voiced velar lateral fricative

The lateral fricative occurs as the &quot;ll&quot; of Welsh, as in &quot;Lloyd&quot;, &quot;Llewelyn&quot;, and &quot;Machynlleth&quot; (, a town), as the unvoiced &#x27;hl&#x27; and voiced &#x27;dl&#x27; or &#x27;dhl&#x27; in the several languages of Southern Africa (such as Xhosa and Zulu), and in Mongolian.

* or and voiceless lateral-median fricative (a laterally lisped or ) (Modern South Arabian)
* or and voiced lateral-median fricative (a laterally lisped or ) (Modern South Arabian)

===IPA letters used for both fricatives and approximants===
* voiceless uvular fricative
* voiced uvular fricative
* voiceless pharyngeal fricative
* voiced pharyngeal fricative

No language distinguishes fricatives from approximants at these places, so the same symbol is used for both. For the pharyngeal, approximants are more numerous than fricatives. A fricative realization may be specified by adding the uptack to the letters, . Likewise, the downtack may be added to specify an approximant realization, .

(The bilabial approximant and dental approximant do not have dedicated symbols either and are transcribed in a similar fashion: . However, the base letters are understood to specifically refer to the fricatives.)

===Pseudo-fricatives===

* voiceless glottal transition, as in English &quot;hat&quot;
* breathy-voiced glottal transition

In many languages, such as English or Korean, the glottal &quot;fricatives&quot; are unaccompanied phonation states of the glottis, without any accompanying manner, fricative or otherwise. They may be mistaken for real glottal constrictions in a number of languages, such as Finnish.

===Aspirated fricatives===
Fricatives are very commonly voiced, though cross-linguistically voiced fricatives are not nearly as common as tenuis (&quot;plain&quot;) fricatives. Other phonations are common in languages that have those phonations in their stop consonants. However, phonemically aspirated fricatives are rare. contrasts with a tense, unaspirated in Korean; aspirated fricatives are also found in a few Sino-Tibetan languages, in some Oto-Manguean languages, in the Siouan language Ofo ( and ), and in the (central?) Chumash languages ( and ). The record may be Cone Tibetan, which has four contrastive aspirated fricatives: , , and .

===Nasalized fricatives===
Phonemically nasalized fricatives are rare. Umbundu has and Kwangali and Souletin Basque have . In Coatzospan Mixtec, appear allophonically before a nasal vowel, and in Igbo nasality is a feature of the syllable; when occur in nasal syllables they are themselves nasalized.


==Occurrence==
Until its extinction, Ubykh may have been the language with the most fricatives (29 not including ), some of which did not have dedicated symbols or diacritics in the IPA. This number actually outstrips the number of all consonants in English (which has 24 consonants). By contrast, approximately 8.7% of the world&#x27;s languages have no phonemic fricatives at all. This is a typical feature of Australian Aboriginal languages, where the few fricatives that exist result from changes to plosives or approximants, but also occurs in some indigenous languages of New Guinea and South America that have especially small numbers of consonants. However, whereas is &quot;entirely&quot; unknown in indigenous Australian languages, most of the other languages without true fricatives do have in their consonant inventory.

Voicing contrasts in fricatives are largely confined to Europe, Africa, and Western Asia. Languages of South and East Asia, such as Mandarin Chinese, Korean, and the Austronesian languages, typically do not have such voiced fricatives as and , which are familiar to many European speakers. In some Dravidian languages they occur as allophones. These voiced fricatives are also relatively rare in indigenous languages of the Americas. Overall, voicing contrasts in fricatives are much rarer than in plosives, being found only in about a third of the world&#x27;s languages as compared to 60 percent for plosive voicing contrasts.

About 15 percent of the world&#x27;s languages, however, have &quot;unpaired voiced fricatives&quot;, i.e. a voiced fricative without a voiceless counterpart. Two-thirds of these, or 10 percent of all languages, have unpaired voiced fricatives but no voicing contrast between any fricative pair.

This phenomenon occurs because voiced fricatives have developed from lenition of plosives or fortition of approximants. This phenomenon of unpaired voiced fricatives is scattered throughout the world, but is confined to nonsibilant fricatives with the exception of a couple of languages that have but lack . (Relatedly, several languages have the voiced affricate but lack , and vice versa.) The fricatives that occur most often without a voiceless counterpart are ‚Äì in order of ratio of unpaired occurrences to total occurrences ‚Äì , , , and .

==Acoustics==
Fricatives appear in waveforms as somewhat random noise caused by the turbulent airflow, upon which a periodic pattern is overlaid if voiced. Fricatives produced in the front of the mouth tend to have energy concentration at higher frequencies than ones produced in the back. The centre of gravity (&quot;CoG&quot;), i.e. the average frequency in a spectrum weighted by the amplitude (also known as &quot;spectral mean&quot;), may be used to determine the place of articulation of a fricative relative to that of another.

<text>Frost is a thin layer of ice on a solid surface, which forms from water vapor that deposits onto a freezing surface. Frost forms when the air contains more water vapor than it can normally hold at a specific temperature. The process is similar to the formation of dew, except it occurs below the freezing point of water typically without crossing through a liquid state. 

Air always contains a certain amount of water vapor, depending on temperature. Warmer air can hold more than colder air. When the atmosphere contains more water than it can hold at a specific temperature, its relative humidity rises above 100% becoming supersaturated, and the excess water vapor is forced to deposit onto any nearby surface, forming seed crystals. The temperature at which frost will form is called the dew point, and depends on the humidity of the air. When the temperature of the air drops below its dew point, excess water vapor is forced out of solution, resulting in a phase change directly from water vapor (a gas) to ice (a solid). As more water molecules are added to the seeds, crystal growth occurs, forming ice crystals. Crystals may vary in size and shape, from an even layer of numerous microscopic-seeds to fewer but much larger crystals, ranging from long dendritic crystals (tree-like) growing across a surface, acicular crystals (needle-like) growing outward from the surface, snowflake-shaped crystals, or even large, knifelike blades of ice covering an object, which depends on many factors such as temperature, air pressure, air motion and turbulence, surface roughness and wettability, and the level of supersaturation. For example, water vapor adsorbs to glass very well, so automobile windows will often frost before the paint, and large hoar-frost crystals can grow very rapidly when the air is very cold, calm, and heavily saturated, such as during an ice fog.

Frost may occur when warm, moist air comes into contact with a cold surface, cooling it below its dew point, such as warm breath on a freezing window. In the atmosphere, it more often occurs when both the air and the surface are below freezing, when the air experiences a drop in temperature bringing it below its dew point, for example, when the temperature falls after the sun sets. In temperate climates, it most commonly appears on surfaces near the ground as fragile white crystals; in cold climates, it occurs in a greater variety of forms. The propagation of crystal formation occurs by the process of nucleation, in specific, water nucleation, which is the same phenomenon responsible for the formation of clouds, fog, snow, rain and other meteorological phenomena.

The ice crystals of frost form as the result of fractal process development. The depth of frost crystals varies depending on the amount of time they have been accumulating, and the concentration of the water vapor (humidity). Frost crystals may be invisible (black), clear (translucent), or, if a mass of frost crystals scatters light in all directions, the coating of frost appears white.

Types of frost include crystalline frost (hoar frost or radiation frost) from deposition of water vapor from air of low humidity, white frost in humid conditions, window frost on glass surfaces, advection frost from cold wind over cold surfaces, black frost without visible ice at low temperatures and very low humidity, and rime under supercooled wet conditions.

Plants that have evolved in warmer climates suffer damage when the temperature falls low enough to freeze the water in the cells that make up the plant tissue. The tissue damage resulting from this process is known as &quot;frost damage&quot;. Farmers in those regions where frost damage has been known to affect their crops often invest in substantial means to protect their crops from such damage.

==Formation==

If a solid surface is chilled below the dew point of the surrounding humid air, and the surface itself is colder than freezing, ice will form on it. If the water deposits as a liquid that then freezes, it forms a coating that may look glassy, opaque, or crystalline, depending on its type. Depending on context, that process may also be called atmospheric icing. The ice it produces differs in some ways from crystalline frost, which consists of spicules of ice that typically project from the solid surface on which they grow.

The main difference between the ice coatings and frost spicules arises because the crystalline spicules grow directly from desublimation of water vapour from air, and desublimation is not a factor in icing of freezing surfaces. For desublimation to proceed, the surface must be below the frost point of the air, meaning that it is sufficiently cold for ice to form without passing through the liquid phase. The air must be humid, but not sufficiently humid to permit the condensation of liquid water, or icing will result instead of desublimation. The size of the crystals depends largely on the temperature, the amount of water vapor available, and how long they have been growing undisturbed.

As a rule, except in conditions where supercooled droplets are present in the air, frost will form only if the deposition surface is colder than the surrounding air. For instance, frost may be observed around cracks in cold wooden sidewalks when humid air escapes from the warmer ground beneath. Other objects on which frost commonly forms are those with low specific heat or high thermal emissivity, such as blackened metals, hence the accumulation of frost on the heads of rusty nails.

The apparently erratic occurrence of frost in adjacent localities is due partly to differences of elevation, the lower areas becoming colder on calm nights. Where static air settles above an area of ground in the absence of wind, the absorptivity and specific heat of the ground strongly influence the temperature that the trapped air attains.

==Types==

===Hoar frost===

Hoar frost, also hoarfrost, radiation frost, or pruina, refers to white ice crystals deposited on the ground or loosely attached to exposed objects, such as wires or leaves. They form on cold, clear nights when conditions are such that heat radiates into outer space faster than it can be replaced from nearby warm objects or brought in by the wind. Under suitable circumstances, objects cool to below the frost point of the surrounding air, well below the freezing point of water. Such freezing may be promoted by effects such as flood frost or frost pocket. These occur when ground-level radiation cools air until it flows downhill and accumulates in pockets of very cold air in valleys and hollows. Hoar frost may freeze in such low-lying cold air even when the air temperature a few feet above ground is well above freezing.

The word &quot;hoar&quot; comes from an Old English adjective that means &quot;showing signs of old age&quot;. In this context, it refers to the frost that makes trees and bushes look like white hair. 

Hoar frost may have different names depending on where it forms:
*Air hoar is a deposit of hoar frost on objects above the surface, such as tree branches, plant stems, and wires.
*Surface hoar refers to fern-like ice crystals directly deposited on snow, ice, or already frozen surfaces.
*Crevasse hoar consists of crystals that form in glacial crevasses where water vapour can accumulate under calm weather conditions.
*Depth hoar refers to faceted crystals that have slowly grown large within cavities beneath the surface of banks of dry snow. Depth hoar crystals grow continuously at the expense of neighbouring smaller crystals, so typically are visibly stepped and have faceted hollows.

When surface hoar covers sloping snowbanks, the layer of frost crystals may create an avalanche risk; when heavy layers of new snow cover the frosty surface, furry crystals standing out from the old snow hold off the falling flakes, forming a layer of voids that prevents the new snow layers from bonding strongly to the old snow beneath. Ideal conditions for hoarfrost to form on snow are cold, clear nights, with very light, cold air currents conveying humidity at the right rate for growth of frost crystals. Wind that is too strong or warm destroys the furry crystals, and thereby may permit a stronger bond between the old and new snow layers. However, if the winds are strong enough and cold enough to lay the crystals flat and dry, carpeting the snow with cold, loose crystals without removing or destroying them or letting them warm up and become sticky, then the frost interface between the snow layers may still present an avalanche danger, because the texture of the frost crystals differs from the snow texture, and the dry crystals will not stick to fresh snow. Such conditions still prevent a strong bond between the snow layers.

In very low temperatures where fluffy surface hoar crystals form without subsequently being covered with snow, strong winds may break them off, forming a dust of ice particles and blowing them over the surface. The ice dust then may form &quot;yukimarimo&quot;, as has been observed in parts of Antarctica, in a process similar to the formation of dust bunnies and similar structures.

Hoar frost and white frost also occur in man-made environments such as in freezers or industrial cold-storage facilities. If such cold spaces or the pipes serving them are not well insulated and are exposed to ambient humidity, the moisture will freeze instantly depending on the freezer temperature. The frost may coat pipes thickly, partly insulating them, but such inefficient insulation still is a source of heat loss.

===Advection frost===
Advection frost (also called wind frost) refers to tiny ice spikes that form when very cold wind is blowing over tree branches, poles, and other surfaces. It looks like rimming on the edges of flowers and leaves, and usually forms against the direction of the wind. It can occur at any hour, day or night.

===Window frost===
Window frost (also called fern frost or ice flowers) forms when a glass pane is exposed to very cold air on the outside and warmer, moderately moist air on the inside. If the pane is a bad insulator (for example, if it is a single-pane window), water vapour condenses on the glass, forming frost patterns. With very low temperatures outside, frost can appear on the bottom of the window even with double-pane energy-efficient windows because the air convection between two panes of glass ensures that the bottom part of the glazing unit is colder than the top part. On unheated motor vehicles, the frost usually forms on the outside surface of the glass first. The glass surface influences the shape of crystals, so imperfections, scratches, or dust can modify the way ice nucleates. The patterns in window frost form a fractal with a fractal dimension greater than one, but less than two. This is a consequence of the nucleation process being constrained to unfold in two dimensions, unlike a snowflake, which is shaped by a similar process, but forms in three dimensions and has a fractal dimension greater than two.

If the indoor air is very humid, rather than moderately so, water first condenses in small droplets, and then freezes into clear ice.

Similar patterns of freezing may occur on other smooth vertical surfaces, but they seldom are as obvious or spectacular as on clear glass.

===White frost===
White frost is a solid deposition of ice that forms directly from water vapour contained in air.

White frost forms when relative humidity is above 90% and the temperature below ‚àí8¬†¬∞C (18¬†¬∞F), and it grows against the wind direction, since air arriving from windward has a higher humidity than leeward air, but the wind must not be strong, else it damages the delicate icy structures as they begin to form. White frost resembles a heavy coating of hoar frost with big, interlocking crystals, usually needle-shaped.

===Rime===
Rime is a type of ice deposition that occurs quickly, often under heavily humid and windy conditions. Technically speaking, it is not a type of frost, since usually supercooled water drops are involved, in contrast to the formation of hoar frost, in which water vapour desublimates slowly and directly. Ships travelling through Arctic seas may accumulate large quantities of rime on the rigging. Unlike hoar frost, which has a feathery appearance, rime generally has an icy, solid appearance.

===Black frost===

Black frost (or &quot;killing frost&quot;) is not strictly speaking frost at all, because it is the condition seen in crops when the humidity is too low for frost to form, but the temperature falls so low that plant tissues freeze and die, becoming blackened, hence the term &quot;black frost&quot;. Black frost often is called &quot;killing frost&quot; because white frost tends to be less cold, partly because the latent heat of freezing of the water reduces the temperature drop.

==Effect on plants==

===Damage===
Many plants can be damaged or killed by freezing temperatures or frost. This varies with the type of plant, the tissue exposed, and how low temperatures get; a &quot;light frost&quot; of damages fewer types of plants than a &quot;hard frost&quot; below .

Plants likely to be damaged even by a light frost include vines‚Äîsuch as beans, grapes, squashes, melons‚Äîalong with nightshades such as tomatoes, eggplants, and peppers. Plants that may tolerate (or even benefit from) frosts include:
*root vegetables (e.g. beets, carrots, parsnips, onions)
*leafy greens (e.g. lettuces, spinach, chard, cucumber)
*cruciferous vegetables (e.g. cabbages, cauliflower, bok choy, broccoli, Brussels sprouts, radishes, kale, collard, mustard, turnips, rutabagas)
Even those plants that tolerate frost may be damaged once temperatures drop even lower (below ). Hardy perennials, such as &quot;Hosta&quot;, become dormant after the first frosts and regrow when spring arrives. The entire visible plant may turn completely brown until the spring warmth, or may drop all of its leaves and flowers, leaving the stem and stalk only. Evergreen plants, such as pine trees, withstand frost although all or most growth stops. Frost crack is a bark defect caused by a combination of low temperatures and heat from the winter sun.

Vegetation is not necessarily damaged when leaf temperatures drop below the freezing point of their cell contents. In the absence of a site nucleating the formation of ice crystals, the leaves remain in a supercooled liquid state, safely reaching temperatures of . However, once frost forms, the leaf cells may be damaged by sharp ice crystals. Hardening is the process by which a plant becomes tolerant to low temperatures. See also Cryobiology.

Certain bacteria, notably &quot;Pseudomonas syringae&quot;, are particularly effective at triggering frost formation, raising the nucleation temperature to about . Bacteria lacking ice nucleation-active proteins (ice-minus bacteria) result in greatly reduced frost damage.

===Protection methods===
Typical measures to prevent frost or reduce its severity include one or more of:
*Deploying powerful blowers to simulate wind, thereby preventing the formation of accumulations of cold air. There are variations on this theme. One variety is the wind machine, an engine-driven propeller mounted on a vertical pole that blows air almost horizontally. Wind machines were introduced as a method for frost protection in California during the 1920s, but they were not widely accepted until the 1940s and 1950s. Now, they are commonly used in many parts of the world. Another is the selective inverted sink, a device which prevents frost by drawing cold air from the ground and blowing it up through a chimney. It was originally developed to prevent frost damage to citrus fruits in Uruguay. In New Zealand, helicopters are used in similar fashion, especially in the vineyard regions such as Marlborough. By dragging down warmer air from the inversion layers, and preventing the ponding of colder air on the ground, the low-flying helicopters prevent damage to the fruit buds. As the operations are conducted at night, and have in the past involved up to 130 aircraft per night in one region, safety rules are strict. Although not a dedicated method, wind turbines have a similar (although smaller) effect of vertically mixing air layers of different temperature.
*For high-value crops, farmers may wrap trees and use physical crop coverings.
*For high-value crops grown over small areas, heating to slow the drop in temperature may be practical.
*Production of smoke to reduce cooling by radiation, now thought to be of little benefit.
*Spraying crops with a layer of water releases latent heat, preventing harmful freezing of the tissues of the plants that it coats.
Such measures need to be applied with discretion, because they may do more harm than good; for example, spraying crops with water can cause damage if the plants become overburdened with ice. An effective, low cost method for small crop farms and plant nurseries, exploits the latent heat of freezing. A pulsed irrigation timer delivers water through existing overhead sprinklers at a low volumes to combat frosts down to . If the water freezes, it gives off its latent heat, preventing the temperature of the foliage from falling much below zero.

==Frost-free areas==
Frost-free areas are found mainly in the lowland tropics, where they cover almost all land except at altitudes above about near the equator and around in the semiarid areas in tropical regions. Some areas on the oceanic margins of the subtropics are also frost-free, as are highly oceanic areas near windward coasts. The most poleward frost-free areas are the lower altitudes of the Azores, √éle Amsterdam, √éle Saint-Paul, and Tristan da Cunha.

In the contiguous United States, southern Florida around Miami Beach and the Florida Keys are the only reliably frost-free areas, as well as the Channel Islands off the coast of California. The hardiness zones in these regions are 11a and 11b.

==Permafrost==
Permafrost is a layer of frozen earth underground which never heats above freezing even during summer months, remaining frozen year round. Although not frost in the atmospheric sense, it consists of dirt, soil, sand, rocks, clay, or organic matter (peat) bound firmly together by ice crystals, making the material very hard and difficult to penetrate. Permafrost exists in the colder climates of the Arctic and Antarctic, such as Russia, Canada, Alaska, Norway, Greenland, or Antarctica, where the warmer conditions of summer are insufficient to penetrate the insulation of the Earth to reach deep enough to thaw the permafrost layer. The permafrost may begin from the surface of the ground or many meters beneath it, and may extend from just a meter to over a thousand meters in thickness. Permafrost contains a significant portion of the Earth&#x27;s water and carbon, and prevents surface water from penetrating very deep into the ground, making it responsible in part for the typical taiga and spruce bog environments common in northern latitudes.

==Personifications==

Frost is personified in Russian culture as Ded Moroz. Indigenous peoples of Russia such as the Mordvins have their own traditions of frost deities.

English folklore tradition holds that Jack Frost, an elfish creature, is responsible for feathery patterns of frost found on windows on cold mornings.

== On other planets ==
In 2024, two European Space Agency spacecraft, Exomars TGO and Mars Express, discovered a thin but very wide layer of water frost on the peak of Olympus Mons, the highest mountain on Mars. This layer of frost appears for a few hours around sunrise, and then evaporates into the atmosphere for the rest of the Martian day. This was the first instance of frost discovered in the equatorial region of Mars.

<text>Franz Schmidt, also Ferenc Schmidt (, 22 December 1874 ‚Äì 11 February 1939) was an Austro-Hungarian composer, cellist and pianist.

== Life ==
Schmidt was born in Pozsony/Pressburg, in the Hungarian part of Austria-Hungary (today Bratislava, Slovakia) to a half-Hungarian father ‚Äì with the same name, born in the same city ‚Äì and to a Hungarian mother, M√°ria Ravasz. He was a Roman Catholic.

His earliest teacher was his mother, M√°ria Ravasz, an accomplished pianist, who gave him a systematic instruction in the keyboard works of J. S. Bach. He received a foundation in theory from , the organist at the Franciscan church in Pressburg. He studied piano briefly with Theodor Leschetizky, with whom he clashed. He moved to Vienna with his family in 1888, and studied at the Vienna Conservatory (composition with Robert Fuchs, cello with Ferdinand Hellmesberger, and, for a few lessons, counterpoint with Anton Bruckner, who was already seriously ill at that time), graduating &quot;with excellence&quot; in 1896.

He obtained a post as cellist with the Vienna Court Opera Orchestra, where he played until 1914, often under Gustav Mahler. Mahler habitually had Schmidt play all the cello solos, even though Friedrich Buxbaum was the principal cellist. Schmidt was also in demand as a chamber musician. Schmidt and Arnold Schoenberg maintained cordial relations despite their vast differences in eventual outlook and style (Schmidt certainly shows a perceptible influence from Schoenberg&#x27;s early, tonal works such as &quot;Verkl√§rte Nacht&quot;, Op. 4, in whose Viennese premi√®re he participated as cellist, the &quot;Chamber Symphony No. 1&quot;, Op. 9 and the gigantic cantata &quot;Gurre-Lieder&quot;. Unable to procure a teaching position for Schoenberg at the academy, Schmidt rehearsed his students in a performance of &quot;Pierrot Lunaire&quot;, Op. 21 which Schoenberg warmly praised). Also a brilliant pianist, in 1914 Schmidt took up a professorship in piano at the Vienna Conservatory, which had been recently renamed Imperial Academy of Music and the Performing Arts. (Apparently, when asked who the greatest living pianist was, Leopold Godowsky replied, &quot;The other one is Franz Schmidt.&quot;) In 1925 he became Director of the academy, and from 1927 to 1931 its Rector.

As teacher of piano, cello and counterpoint and composition at the academy, Schmidt trained numerous instrumentalists, conductors, and composers who later achieved fame. Among his best-known students were the pianist Friedrich W√ºhrer and Alfred Ros√© (son of Arnold Ros√©, the founder of the Ros√© Quartet, Konzertmeister of the Vienna Philharmonic and brother-in-law of Gustav Mahler). Among the composers were Walter Bricht (his favourite student), Theodor Berger, Marcel Rubin, Alfred Uhl and ƒΩudov√≠t Rajter. He received many tokens of the high esteem in which he was held, notably the Order of Franz Joseph, and an Honorary Doctorate from the University of Vienna.

Schmidt&#x27;s private life was in stark contrast to the success of his distinguished professional career. His first wife, Karoline Perssin (c. 1880‚Äì1943), was confined in the Vienna mental hospital Am Steinhof in 1919, and three years after his death was murdered under the Nazi euthanasia program. Their daughter Emma Schmidt Holzschuh (1902‚Äì1932, married 1929) died unexpectedly after the birth of her first child. Schmidt experienced a spiritual and physical breakdown after this, and achieved an artistic revival and resolution in his Fourth Symphony of 1933 (which he inscribed as &quot;Requiem for my Daughter&quot;) and, especially, in his oratorio &quot;The Book with Seven Seals&quot;. His second marriage in 1923, to a successful young piano student Margarethe Jirasek (1891‚Äì1964), for the first time brought some desperately needed stability into the private life of the artist, who was plagued by many serious health problems.

Schmidt&#x27;s worsening health forced his retirement from the academy in early 1937. In the last year of his life Austria was brought into the German Reich by the Anschluss, and Schmidt was feted by the Nazi authorities as the greatest living composer of the so-called Ostmark. He was given a commission to write a cantata entitled &quot;The German Resurrection&quot;, which, after 1945, was taken by many as a reason to brand him as having been tainted by Nazi sympathy. However, Schmidt left this composition unfinished, and in the summer and autumn of 1938, a few months before his death, set it aside to devote himself to two other commissioned works for the one-armed pianist Paul Wittgenstein: the Quintet in A major for piano left-hand, clarinet, and string trio; and the Toccata in D minor for solo piano.
Schmidt died on 11 February 1939.

== Musical works ==
As a composer, Schmidt was slow to develop, but his reputation, at least in Austria, saw a steady growth from the late 1890s until his death in 1939. In his music, Schmidt continued to develop the Viennese classic-romantic traditions he inherited from Schubert, Brahms, and Bruckner. He also takes forward the &quot;gypsy&quot; style of Liszt and Brahms. His works are monumental in form and firmly tonal in language, though quite often innovative in their designs and clearly open to some of the new developments in musical syntax initiated by Mahler and Schoenberg. Although Schmidt did not write a lot of chamber music, what he did write, in the opinion of such critics as Wilhelm Altmann, was important and of high quality. Although Schmidt&#x27;s organ works may resemble others of the era in terms of length, complexity, and difficulty, they are forward-looking in being conceived for the smaller, clearer, classical-style instruments of the &quot;Orgelbewegung&quot;, which he advocated. Schmidt worked mainly in large forms, including four symphonies (1899, 1913, 1928 and 1933) and two operas: &quot;Notre Dame&quot; (1904‚Äì6) and &quot;Fredigundis&quot; (1916‚Äì21). A CD recording of &quot;Notre Dame&quot; has been available for many years, starring Dame Gwyneth Jones and James King.

===&quot;Fredigundis&quot;===
No really adequate recording has been made of Schmidt&#x27;s second and last opera &quot;Fredigundis&quot;, of which there has been but one &quot;unauthorized&quot; release in the early 1980s on the Voce label of an Austrian Radio broadcast of a 1979 Vienna performance under the direction of Ernst M√§rzendorfer. Aside from numerous &quot;royal fanfares&quot; (Fredigundis held the French throne in the sixth century) the score contains some fine examples of Schmidt&#x27;s transitional style between his earlier and later manner. In many respects, Schmidt seldom ventured so far from traditional tonality again, and his third and final period (in the last decade-and-a-half of his life) was generally one of (at least partial) retrenchment, consolidation and the integration of the style of his opulently scored and melodious early compositions (the First Symphony, &quot;Notre Dame&quot;) with elements of the overt experimentation seen in &quot;Fredigundis&quot;, combined with an economy of utterance born of artistic maturity. &quot;New Grove&quot; encyclopaedia states that &quot;Fredigundis&quot; was a critical and popular failure, which may be partly attributable to the fact that Fredigundis (Fredegund, the widow of Chilperic I), is presented as a murderous and sadistic feminine monster. Add to this some structural problems with the libretto, and the opera&#x27;s failure to make headway ‚Äì despite an admirable and impressive score ‚Äì becomes comprehensible.

===&quot;The Book with Seven Seals&quot;===

Aside from the mature symphonies (Nos. 2‚Äì4), Schmidt&#x27;s crowning achievement was the oratorio &quot;The Book with Seven Seals&quot; (1935‚Äì37), a setting of passages from the Book of Revelation. His choice of subject was prophetic: with hindsight the work appears to foretell, in the most powerful terms, the disasters that were shortly to be visited upon Europe in the Second World War. Here his invention rises to a sustained pitch of genius. A narrative upon the text of the oratorio was provided by the composer.

Schmidt&#x27;s oratorio stands in the Austro-German tradition stretching back to the time of J. S. Bach and Handel. He was one of relatively few composers to write an oratorio fully on the subject of the Book of Revelation (earlier works include Georg Philipp Telemann: &quot;Der Tag des Gerichts&quot;, Schneider: &quot;Das Weltgericht&quot;, Louis Spohr: &quot;Die letzten Dinge&quot;, Joachim Raff: &quot;Weltende&quot;, and Ralph Vaughan Williams: &quot;Sancta Civitas&quot;). Far from glorifying its subject, it is a mystical contemplation, a horrified warning, and a prayer for salvation. The premiere was held in Vienna on 15 June 1938, with the Vienna Symphony Orchestra under Oswald Kabasta: the soloists were Rudolf Gerlach (John), Erika Rokyta, Enid Sz√°nth√≥, Anton Dermota, Josef von Manowarda and Franz Sch√ºtz at the organ.

===Symphonies===
Schmidt is generally regarded as a conservative composer, but the rhythmic subtlety and harmonic complexity of much of his music belie this. His music combines a reverence for the Austro-German lineage of composers with innovations in harmony and orchestration (showing an awareness of the output of composers such as Debussy and Ravel, whose piano music he greatly admired, along with a knowledge of more recent composers in his own German-speaking realm, such as Schoenberg, Berg, Hindemith, etc.).

*Symphony No. 1 in E major. Written in 1896 at age 22. The scherzo (which shows a mature absorption of Bruckner and Richard Strauss) is especially noteworthy, while Schmidt demonstrates his contrapuntal skills in the Finale.
*Symphony No. 2 in E-flat major. Written in 1913 in a style reminiscent of Strauss and Reger while also paying homage to the monumentality of Bruckner. This is Schmidt&#x27;s longest symphony and it employs a huge orchestra. The central movement (of three) is an ingenious set of variations, which are grouped to suggest the characters of slow movement and scherzo. The complex scoring renders it a considerable challenge for most orchestras.
*Symphony No. 3 in A major. A sunny, melodic work in the Schubert vein (although its lyricism and superb orchestration do much to conceal the fact that it is one of the composer&#x27;s most harmonically advanced works). Winner of the Austrian section of the 1928 International Columbia Graphophone Competition (the overall winner was Swedish composer Kurt Atterberg with his 6th Symphony), it enjoyed some popularity at the time (1928).
*Symphony No. 4 in C major.Written in 1933, this is the best-known work of his entire oeuvre. The composer called it &quot;A requiem for my daughter&quot;. It begins with a long 23-bar melody on an unaccompanied solo trumpet (which returns at the symphony&#x27;s close, &quot;transfigured&quot; by all that has intervened). The Adagio is an immense ABA ternary structure. The first A is an expansive threnody on solo cello (Schmidt&#x27;s own instrument) whose seamless lyricism predates Strauss&#x27;s &quot;Metamorphosen&quot; by more than a decade (its theme is later adjusted to form the scherzo of the symphony); the B section is an equally expansive funeral march (unmistakably referencing the &quot;Marcia Funebre&quot; from Beethoven&#x27;s &quot;Eroica&quot; in its texture) whose dramatic climax is marked by an orchestral crescendo culminating in a gong and cymbal crash (again, a clear allusion to similar climaxes in the later symphonies of Bruckner, and followed by what Harold Truscott has described as a &quot;reverse climax&quot;, leading back to a repeat of the A section).

==Schmidt and Nazism==
Schmidt&#x27;s premiere of &quot;The Book with Seven Seals&quot; was made much of by the Nazis (who had annexed Austria shortly before in the Anschluss), and Schmidt was seen to give the Nazi salute (according to a report by Georg Tintner, who revered Schmidt and whose intent to record his symphonies was never realised). His conductor Oswald Kabasta was apparently an enthusiastic Nazi who, being prohibited from conducting in 1946 during de-nazification, committed suicide. These facts long placed Schmidt&#x27;s posthumous reputation under a cloud. His lifelong friend and colleague Oskar Adler, who fled the Nazis in 1938, wrote afterwards that Schmidt was never a Nazi and never antisemitic but was extremely naive about politics. Hans Keller gave a similar endorsement. Regarding Schmidt&#x27;s political naivety, Michael Steinberg, in his book &quot;The Symphony&quot;, tells of Schmidt&#x27;s recommending &quot;Variations on a Hebrew Theme&quot; by his student Israel Brandmann to a musical group associated with the proto-Nazi German National Party. Most of Schmidt&#x27;s principal musical friends were Jews, and they benefited from his generosity.

Schmidt&#x27;s last listed work, the cantata &quot;Deutsche Auferstehung&quot; (&quot;German Resurrection&quot;), was composed to a Nazi text. As one of the most famous living Austrian composers, Schmidt was well known to Hitler and received this commission after the Anschluss. He left it unfinished, to be completed later by Robert Wagner. Already seriously ill, Schmidt worked instead on other compositions such as the Quintet in A major for piano (left hand), clarinet and string trio, intended for Paul Wittgenstein and incorporating a variation set based on a theme by Wittgenstein&#x27;s old teacher, Josef Labor. His failure to complete the cantata is likely to be a further indication that he was not committed to the Nazi cause.

In a 1996 issue of &quot;The Musical Quarterly&quot;, Peter Laki argued that Schmidt was falsely associated with Nazism, although Leon Botstein disagreed.

<doc id="11772" wikidata="Q211855" url="?curid=11772" title="Finnish Civil War">
<text>The Finnish Civil War was a civil war in Finland in 1918 fought for the leadership and control of the country between White Finland and the Finnish Socialist Workers&#x27; Republic (Red Finland) during the country&#x27;s transition from a grand duchy ruled by the Russian Empire to a fully independent state. The clashes took place in the context of the national, political, and social turmoil caused by World War I (Eastern Front) in Europe. The war was fought between the Red Guards, led by a section of the Social Democratic Party, and the White Guards, conducted by the senate and those who opposed socialism with assistance late in the war by the German Imperial Army at the request of the Finnish civil government. The paramilitary Red Guards, which were composed of industrial and agrarian workers, controlled the cities and industrial centres of southern Finland. The paramilitary White Guards, which consisted of land owners and those in the middle and upper classes, controlled rural central and northern Finland, and were led by General C. G. E. Mannerheim.

In the years before the conflict, Finland had experienced rapid population growth, industrialisation, urbanisation and the rise of a comprehensive labour movement. The country&#x27;s political and governmental systems were in an unstable phase of democratisation and modernisation. The socio-economic condition and education of the population had gradually improved, and national awareness and culture had progressed. World War I led to the collapse of the Russian Empire, causing a power vacuum in Finland, and the subsequent struggle for dominance led to militarisation and an escalating crisis between the left-leaning labour movement and the conservatives. The Reds carried out an unsuccessful general offensive in February 1918, supplied with weapons by Soviet Russia. A counteroffensive by the Whites began in March, reinforced by the German Empire&#x27;s military detachments in April. The decisive engagements were the Battles of Tampere and Viipuri, won by the Whites, and the Battles of Helsinki and Lahti, won by German troops, leading to overall victory for the Whites and the German forces. Political violence became a part of this warfare. Around 12,500 Red prisoners died of malnutrition and disease in camps. About 39,000 people, of whom 36,000 were Finns, died in the conflict.

In the immediate aftermath, the Finns passed from Russian governance to the German sphere of influence with a plan to establish a German-led Finnish monarchy. The scheme ended with Germany&#x27;s defeat in World War I, and Finland instead emerged as an independent, democratic republic. The civil war divided the nation for decades. Finnish society was reunited through social compromises based on a long-term culture of moderate politics and religion and a post-war economic recovery.

==Names==
The war has been assigned several designations according to different political and ideological viewpoints. War of Independence () was used during the war by both sides to express the fight for liberation from capitalism for the Reds and freedom from Soviet Russian influence by the Whites; Civil War is the term increasingly employed by the reconstituted social democrats after their defeat in the war. The general terms for the conflict, Civil War () and Citizen War (), are synonymous and appeared mostly after the war. More ideologic names were also used including Class War () and Revolution () by the Reds and their supporters while Red Rebellion () was used by the Whites and their supporters. Another designation, Brethren War (), is applied in some poetic settings. According to a 2008 interview of 1,005 people done by the newspaper &quot;Aamulehti&quot;, the most popular names were as follows: Civil War: 29%, Citizen War: 25%, Class War: 13%, War of Independence: 11%, Red Rebellion: 5%, Revolution: 1%, other name: 2% and no answer: 14%.

==Background==
=== Finland as grand duchy: 1809‚Äì1917 ===
From 1809 to 1898, a period called the &quot;Pax Russica&quot;, the peripheral authority of the Finns gradually increased, and relations between Russian Empire and Grand Duchy of Finland were exceptionally peaceful for a many years. Russia&#x27;s defeat in the Crimean War in the 1850s led to attempts to speed up the modernisation of the country. This caused more than 50 years of economic, industrial, cultural and educational progress in the Grand Duchy of Finland, including an improvement in the status of the Finnish language. All this encouraged Finnish nationalism and cultural unity through the birth of the Fennoman movement, which bound the Finns to the domestic administration and led to the idea that the Grand Duchy was an increasingly autonomous state ruled by the Russian Empire.

However, in 1899, the Russian Empire had begun to initiate a policy of integration through the Russification of Finland.

The strengthened, pan-slavist central power tried to unite the &quot;Russian Multinational Dynastic Union&quot; as the military and strategic situation of Russia became more perilous due to the rise of Germany and Japan. Finns called the increased military and administrative control, &quot;the First Period of Oppression&quot;, and for the first time Finnish politicians drew up plans for disengagement from Russia or full sovereignty for Finland. In the struggle against integration, activists drawn from sections of the working class and the Swedish-speaking intelligentsia carried out terrorist acts. During World War I and the rise of Germanism, the pro-Swedish Svecomans began their covert collaboration with Imperial Germany and, from 1915 to 1917, a J√§ger (; ) battalion consisting of 1,900 Finnish volunteers was trained in Germany.

===Domestic politics===
The major reasons for rising political tensions among Finns were the autocratic rule of the Russian tsar and the undemocratic class system of the estates of the realm. The latter system originated in the regime of the Swedish Empire that preceded Russian governance and divided the Finnish people economically, socially and politically. Finland&#x27;s population grew rapidly in the nineteenth century (from 860,000 in 1810 to 3,130,000 in 1917), and a class of agrarian and industrial workers, as well as crofters, emerged over the period. The Industrial Revolution was rapid in Finland, though it started later than in the rest of Western Europe. Industrialisation was financed by the state and some of the social problems associated with the industrial process were diminished by the administration&#x27;s actions. Among urban workers, socio-economic problems steepened during periods of industrial depression. The position of rural workers worsened after the end of the nineteenth century, as farming became more efficient and market-oriented, and the development of industry was insufficiently vigorous to fully utilise the rapid population growth of the countryside.

The difference between Scandinavian-Finnish and Russian-Slavic culture affected the nature of Finnish national integration. The upper social strata took the lead and gained domestic authority from the Russian tsar in 1809. The estates planned to build an increasingly autonomous Finnish state, led by the elite and the intelligentsia. The Fennoman movement aimed to include the common people in a non-political role; the labour movement, youth associations and the temperance movement were initially led &quot;from above&quot;.

Between 1870 and 1916 industrialisation gradually improved social conditions and the self-confidence of workers, but while the standard of living of the common people rose in absolute terms, the rift between rich and poor deepened markedly. The commoners&#x27; rising awareness of socio-economic and political questions interacted with the ideas of socialism, social liberalism and nationalism. The workers&#x27; initiatives and the corresponding responses of the dominant authorities intensified social conflict in Finland.

The Finnish labour movement, which emerged at the end of the nineteenth century from temperance, religious movements and Fennomania, had a Finnish nationalist, working-class character. From 1899 to 1906, the movement became conclusively independent, shedding the paternalistic thinking of the Fennoman estates, and it was represented by the Finnish Social Democratic Party, established in 1899. Workers&#x27; activism was directed both toward opposing Russification and in developing a domestic policy that tackled social problems and responded to the demand for democracy. This was a reaction to the domestic dispute, ongoing since the 1880s, between the Finnish nobility-bourgeoisie and the labour movement concerning voting rights for the common people. Despite their obligations as obedient, peaceful and non-political inhabitants of the Grand Duchy (who had, only a few decades earlier, accepted the class system as the natural order of their life), the commoners began to demand their civil rights and citizenship in Finnish society. The power struggle between the Finnish estates and the Russian administration gave a concrete role model and free space for the labour movement. On the other side, due to an at-least century-long tradition and experience of administrative authority, the Finnish elite saw itself as the inherent natural leader of the nation. The political struggle for democracy was solved outside Finland, in international politics: the Russian Empire&#x27;s failed 1904‚Äì1905 war against Japan led to the 1905 Revolution in Russia and to a general strike in Finland. In an attempt to quell the general unrest, the system of estates was abolished in the Parliamentary Reform of 1906. The general strike increased support for the social democrats substantially. The party encompassed a higher proportion of the population than any other socialist movement in the world.

The Reform of 1906 was a giant leap towards the political and social liberalisation of the common Finnish people because the Russian House of Romanov had been the most autocratic and conservative ruler in Europe. The Finns adopted a unicameral parliamentary system, the Parliament of Finland (; ) with universal suffrage. The number of voters increased from 126,000 to 1,273,000, including female citizens. The reform led to the social democrats obtaining about fifty per cent of the popular vote, but the Tsar regained his authority after the crisis of 1905. Subsequently, during the more severe programme of Russification, called &quot;the Second Period of Oppression&quot; by the Finns, the Tsar neutralised the power of the Finnish Parliament between 1908 and 1917. He dissolved the assembly, ordered parliamentary elections almost annually, and determined the composition of the Finnish Senate, which did not correlate with the Parliament.

The capacity of the Finnish Parliament to solve socio-economic problems was stymied by confrontations between the largely uneducated commoners and the former estates. Another conflict festered as employers denied collective bargaining and the right of the labour unions to represent workers. The parliamentary process disappointed the labour movement, but as dominance in the Parliament and legislation was the workers&#x27; most likely way to obtain a more balanced society, they identified themselves with the state. Overall domestic politics led to a contest for leadership of the Finnish state during the ten years before the collapse of the Russian Empire.

===International politics===
The main factor behind the Finnish Civil War was a political crisis arising out of World War I. Under the pressures of the Great War, the Russian Empire collapsed, leading to the February and October Revolutions in 1917. This breakdown caused a power vacuum and a subsequent struggle for power in Eastern Europe. The Grand Duchy of Finland became embroiled in the turmoil. Geopolitically less important than the continental Moscow‚ÄìWarsaw gateway, Finland, isolated by the Baltic Sea, was relatively peaceful until early 1918. The war between the German Empire and Russia had only indirect effects on the Finns. Since the end of the 19th century, the Grand Duchy had become a vital source of raw materials, industrial products, food and labour for the growing Imperial Russian capital Petrograd (modern Saint Petersburg), and World War I emphasised that role. Strategically, the Finnish territory was the less important northern section of the Estonian‚ÄìFinnish gateway and a buffer zone to and from Petrograd through the Narva area, the Gulf of Finland and the Karelian Isthmus.

The German Empire saw Eastern Europe - particularly Russia - as a major source of vital products and raw materials, both during World War I and for the future. Russia&#x27;s resources overstretched by the two-front war, Germany attempted to divide Russia by providing financial support to revolutionary groups, such as the Bolsheviks and the Socialist Revolutionary Party, and to radical, separatist factions, such as the Finnish national activist movement leaning toward Germanism. Between 30 and 40 million Reichsmark were spent on this endeavour. Controlling the Finnish area would allow the Imperial German Army to penetrate Petrograd and the Kola Peninsula, an area rich in raw materials for the mining industry. Finland possessed large ore reserves and a well-developed forest industry.

===February Revolution===
====Build-up====
The February Revolution removed Tsar Nicholas II. The collapse of the Russian Empire was caused by military defeats, war-weariness against the duration and hardships of the Great War, and the collision between the most conservative regime in Europe and a Russian people desiring modernisation. The Tsar&#x27;s power was transferred to the State Duma (Russian Parliament) and the left-leaning Provisional Government, but this new authority was challenged by the Petrograd Soviet (city council), leading to dual power in the country.

In Finland, mass meetings and local strikes of early 1917 escalated to a general strike in support of the Finnish state&#x27;s power struggle and for increased availability of foodstuffs. The Second Period of Russification was stopped and the autonomous status of 1809‚Äì1899 was returned to the Finns by the 15th March 1917 manifesto of the Russian Provisional Government. For the first time in history, &quot;de facto&quot; political power existed in the Parliament of Finland. The political left, consisting mainly of social democrats, covered a wide spectrum from moderate to revolutionary socialists. The political right was even more diverse, ranging from social liberals and moderate conservatives to rightist conservative elements. The four main parties were:
* The conservative Finnish Party;
* the Young Finnish Party, which included both liberals and conservatives, with the liberals divided between social liberals and economic liberals;
* the social reformist, centrist Agrarian League, which drew its support mainly from peasants with small or mid-sized farms; and
* the conservative Swedish People&#x27;s Party, which sought to retain the rights of the former nobility and the Swedish-speaking minority of Finland.

During 1917, a power struggle and social disintegration interacted. The collapse of Russia induced a chain reaction of disintegration, starting from the government, military and economy, and spreading to all fields of society, such as local administration, workplaces and to individual citizens. The social democrats wanted to retain the civil rights already achieved and to increase the socialists&#x27; power over society. The conservatives feared the loss of their long-held socio-economic dominance. Both factions collaborated with their equivalents in Russia, deepening the split in the nation.

The Social Democratic Party gained an absolute majority in the parliamentary elections of 1916. A new Senate was formed in March 1917 by Oskari Tokoi, but it did not reflect the socialists&#x27; large parliamentary majority: it comprised six social democrats and six non-socialists. In theory, the Senate consisted of a broad national coalition, but in practice (with the main political groups unwilling to compromise and top politicians remaining outside of it), it proved unable to solve any major Finnish problem. After the February Revolution, political authority descended to the street level: mass meetings, strike organisations and worker-soldier councils on the left and to active organisations of employers on the right, all serving to undermine the authority of the state.

The February Revolution halted the Finnish economic boom caused by the Russian war-economy. The collapse in business led to unemployment and high inflation, but the employed workers gained an opportunity to resolve workplace problems. The commoners&#x27; call for the eight-hour working day, better working conditions and higher wages led to demonstrations and large-scale strikes in industry and agriculture.

While the Finns had specialised in milk and butter production, the bulk of the food supply for the country depended on cereals produced in southern Russia. The cessation of cereal imports from disintegrating Russia led to food shortages in Finland. The Senate responded by introducing rationing and price controls. The farmers resisted the state control and thus a black market, accompanied by sharply rising food prices, formed. As a consequence, export to the free market of the Petrograd area increased. Food supply, prices and, in the end, the fear of starvation became emotional political issues between farmers and urban workers, especially those who were unemployed. Common people, their fears exploited by politicians and an incendiary, polarised political media, took to the streets. Despite the food shortages, no actual large-scale starvation hit southern Finland before the civil war and the food market remained a secondary stimulator in the power struggle of the Finnish state.

====Contest for leadership====
The passing of the Tokoi Senate bill called the &quot;Law of Supreme Power&quot; (, more commonly known as &quot;valtalaki&quot;; ) in July 1917, triggered one of the key crises in the power struggle between the social democrats and the conservatives. The fall of the Russian Empire opened the question of who would hold sovereign political authority in the former Grand Duchy. After decades of political disappointment, the February Revolution offered the Finnish social democrats an opportunity to govern; they held the absolute majority in Parliament. The conservatives were alarmed by the continuous increase of the socialists&#x27; influence since 1899, which reached a climax in 1917.

The &quot;Law of Supreme Power&quot; incorporated a plan by the socialists to substantially increase the authority of Parliament, as a reaction to the non-parliamentary and conservative leadership of the Finnish Senate between 1906 and 1916. The bill furthered Finnish autonomy in domestic affairs: the Russian Provisional Government was only allowed the right to control Finnish foreign and military policies. The Act was adopted with the support of the Social Democratic Party, the Agrarian League, part of the Young Finnish Party and some activists eager for Finnish sovereignty. The conservatives opposed the bill and some of the most right-wing representatives resigned from Parliament.

In Petrograd, the social democrats&#x27; plan had the backing of the Bolsheviks. They had been plotting a revolt against the Provisional Government since April 1917, and pro-Soviet demonstrations during the July Days brought matters to a head. The Helsinki Soviet and the Regional Committee of the Finnish Soviets, led by the Bolshevik Ivar Smilga, both pledged to defend the Finnish Parliament, were it threatened with attack. However, the Provisional Government still had sufficient support in the Russian army to survive and as the street movement waned, Vladimir Lenin fled to Karelia. In the aftermath of these events, the &quot;Law of Supreme Power&quot; was overruled and the social democrats eventually backed down; more Russian troops were sent to Finland and, with the co-operation and insistence of the Finnish conservatives, Parliament was dissolved and new elections announced.

In the October 1917 elections, the social democrats lost their absolute majority, which radicalised the labour movement and decreased support for moderate politics. The crisis of July 1917 did not bring about the Red Revolution of January 1918 on its own, but together with political developments based on the commoners&#x27; interpretation of the ideas of Fennomania and socialism, the events favoured a Finnish revolution. In order to win power, the socialists had to overcome Parliament.

The February Revolution resulted in a loss of institutional authority in Finland and the dissolution of the police force, creating fear and uncertainty. In response, both the right and left assembled their own security groups, which were initially local and largely unarmed. By late 1917, following the dissolution of Parliament, in the absence of a strong government and national armed forces, the security groups began assuming a broader and more paramilitary character. The Civil Guards (; ; ) and the later White Guards (; ) were organised by local men of influence: conservative academics, industrialists, major landowners, and activists. The Workers&#x27; Order Guards (; ) and the Red Guards (; ) were recruited through the local social democratic party sections and from the labour unions.

===October Revolution===

The Bolsheviks&#x27; and Vladimir Lenin&#x27;s October Revolution of 7 November 1917 transferred political power in Petrograd to the radical, left-wing socialists. The German government&#x27;s decision to arrange safe-conduct for Lenin and his comrades from exile in Switzerland to Petrograd in April 1917, was a success. An armistice between Germany and the Bolshevik regime came into force on 6 December and peace negotiations began on 22 December 1917 at Brest-Litovsk.

November 1917 became another watershed in the 1917‚Äì1918 rivalry for the leadership of Finland. After the dissolution of the Finnish Parliament, polarisation between the social democrats and the conservatives increased markedly and the period witnessed the appearance of political violence. An agricultural worker was shot during a local strike on 9 August 1917 at Yp√§j√§ and a Civil Guard member was killed in a local political crisis at Malmi on 24 September. The October Revolution disrupted the informal truce between the Finnish non-socialists and the Russian Provisional Government. After political wrangling over how to react to the revolt, the majority of the politicians accepted a compromise proposal by Santeri Alkio, the leader of the Agrarian League. Parliament seized the sovereign power in Finland on 15 November 1917 based on the socialists&#x27; &quot;Law of Supreme Power&quot; and ratified their proposals of an eight-hour working day and universal suffrage in local elections, from July 1917.
The purely non-socialist, conservative-led government of Pehr Evind Svinhufvud was appointed on 27 November. This nomination was both a long-term aim of the conservatives and a response to the challenges of the labour movement during November 1917. Svinhufvud&#x27;s main aspirations were to separate Finland from Russian rule, to strengthen the Civil Guards, and to return a part of Parliament&#x27;s new authority to the Senate. There were 149 Civil Guards on 31 August 1917 in Finland, counting local units and subsidiary White Guards in towns and rural communes; 251 on 30 September; 315 on 31 October; 380 on 30 November and 408 on 26 January 1918. The first attempt at serious military training among the Guards was the establishment of a 200-strong cavalry school at the Saksanniemi estate in the vicinity of the town of Porvoo, in September 1917. The vanguard of the Finnish J√§gers and German weaponry arrived in Finland during October‚ÄìNovember 1917 on the &#x27; freighter and the German U-boat &#x27;; around 50 J√§gers had returned by the end of 1917.

After political defeats in July and October 1917, the social democrats put forward an uncompromising program called &quot;We Demand&quot; (; ) on 1 November, in order to push for political concessions. They insisted upon a return to the political status before the dissolution of Parliament in July 1917, disbandment of the Civil Guards and elections to establish a Finnish Constituent Assembly. The demands of the program were not accepted and the socialists initiated a general strike during 14‚Äì19 November to increase political pressure on the conservatives, who had opposed the &quot;Law of Supreme Power&quot; and the parliamentary proclamation of sovereign power on 15 November.

Revolution became the goal of the radicalised socialists after the loss of political control, and events in November 1917 offered momentum for a socialist uprising. In this phase, Lenin and Joseph Stalin, under threat in Petrograd, urged the social democrats to take power in Finland. The majority of Finnish socialists were moderate and preferred parliamentary methods, prompting the Bolsheviks to label them &quot;reluctant revolutionaries&quot;. The reluctance diminished as the general strike appeared to offer a major channel of influence for the workers in southern Finland. The strike leadership voted by a narrow majority to start a revolution on 16 November, but the uprising had to be called off the same day due to the lack of active revolutionaries to execute it.
At the end of November 1917, the moderate socialists among the social democrats won a second vote over the radicals in a debate over revolutionary versus parliamentary means, but when they tried to pass a resolution to completely abandon the idea of a socialist revolution, the party representatives and several influential leaders voted it down. The Finnish labour movement wanted to sustain a military force of its own and to keep the revolutionary road open, too. The wavering Finnish socialists disappointed V. I. Lenin and in turn, he began to encourage the Finnish Bolsheviks in Petrograd.

Among the labour movement, a more marked consequence of the events of 1917 was the rise of the Workers&#x27; Order Guards. There were 20‚Äì60 separate guards between 31 August and 30 September 1917, but on 20 October, after defeat in parliamentary elections, the Finnish labour movement proclaimed the need to establish more worker units. The announcement led to a rush of recruits: on 31 October the number of guards was 100‚Äì150; 342 on 30 November 1917 and 375 on 26 January 1918. Since May 1917, the paramilitary organisations of the left had grown in two phases, the majority of them as Workers&#x27; Order Guards. The minority were Red Guards, these were partly underground groups formed in industrialised towns and industrial centres, such as Helsinki, Kotka and Tampere, based on the original Red Guards that had been formed during 1905‚Äì1906 in Finland.

The presence of the two opposing armed forces created a state of dual power and divided sovereignty on Finnish society. The decisive rift between the guards broke out during the general strike: the Reds executed several political opponents in southern Finland and the first armed clashes between the Whites and Reds took place. In total, 34 casualties were reported. Eventually, the political rivalries of 1917 led to an arms race and an escalation towards civil war.

===Full independence of Finland===

The disintegration of Russia offered Finns a historic opportunity to gain national independence. After the October Revolution, the conservatives were eager for secession from Russia in order to control the left and minimise the influence of the Bolsheviks. The socialists were skeptical about sovereignty under conservative rule, but they feared a loss of support among nationalistic workers, particularly after having promised increased national liberty through the &quot;Law of Supreme Power&quot;. Eventually, both political factions supported an independent Finland, despite strong disagreement over the composition of the nation&#x27;s leadership.

Nationalism had become a &quot;civic religion&quot; in Finland by the end of nineteenth century, but the goal during the general strike of 1905 had been a return to the autonomy of 1809‚Äì1898, not full independence. In contrast to their status under the unitary Swedish regime, the domestic power of Finns had increased under the less uniform Russian rule. Economically, the Grand Duchy of Finland benefited from having an independent domestic state budget, a central bank with national currency, the markka (deployed 1860), and customs organisation and the industrial progress of 1860‚Äì1916. The economy was dependent on the huge Russian market and separation would disrupt the profitable Finnish financial zone. The economic collapse of Russia and the power struggle of the Finnish state in 1917 were among the key factors that brought sovereignty to the fore in Finland.

Svinhufvud&#x27;s Senate introduced Finland&#x27;s Declaration of Independence on 4 December 1917 and Parliament adopted it on 6 December. The social democrats voted against the Senate&#x27;s proposal, while presenting an alternative declaration of sovereignty. The establishment of an independent state was not a guaranteed conclusion for the small Finnish nation. Recognition by Russia and other great powers was essential; Svinhufvud accepted that he had to negotiate with Lenin for the acknowledgement. The socialists, having been reluctant to enter talks with the Russian leadership in July 1917, sent two delegations to Petrograd to request that Lenin approve Finnish sovereignty.

In December 1917, Lenin was under intense pressure from the Germans to conclude peace negotiations at Brest-Litovsk, and the Bolsheviks&#x27; rule was in crisis, with an inexperienced administration and the demoralised army facing powerful political and military opponents. Lenin calculated that the Bolsheviks could fight for central parts of Russia but had to give up some peripheral territories, including Finland in the geopolitically less important north-western corner. As a result, Svinhufvud&#x27;s delegation won Lenin&#x27;s concession of sovereignty on 31 December 1917.

By the beginning of the Civil War, Austria-Hungary, Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Norway, Sweden and Switzerland had recognised Finnish independence. The United Kingdom and United States did not approve it; they waited and monitored the relations between Finland and Germany (the main enemy of the Allies), hoping to override Lenin&#x27;s regime and to get Russia back into the war against the German Empire. In turn, the Germans hastened Finland&#x27;s separation from Russian rule so as to move the country to within their sphere of influence.

==Warfare==
===Escalation===
The final escalation towards war began in early January 1918, as each military or political action of the Reds or the Whites resulted in a corresponding counteraction by the other. Both sides justified their activities as defensive measures, particularly to their own supporters. On the left, the vanguard of the movement was the urban Red Guards from Helsinki, Kotka and Turku; they led the rural Reds and convinced the socialist leaders who wavered between peace and war to support the revolution. On the right, the vanguard was the J√§gers, who had transferred to Finland, and the volunteer Civil Guards of southwestern Finland, southern Ostrobothnia and Viipuri province in the southeastern corner of Finland. The first local battles were fought during 9‚Äì21 January 1918 in southern and southeastern Finland, mainly to win the arms race and to control Viipuri.
On 12 January 1918, Parliament authorised the Svinhufvud Senate to establish internal order and discipline on behalf of the state. On 15 January, Carl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim, a former Finnish general of the Imperial Russian Army, was appointed the commander-in-chief of the Civil Guards. The Senate appointed the Guards, henceforth called the White Guards, as the White Army of Finland. Mannerheim placed his Headquarters of the White Army in the Vaasa‚ÄìSein√§joki area. The White Order to engage was issued on 25 January. The Whites gained weaponry by disarming Russian garrisons during 21‚Äì28 January, in particular in southern Ostrobothnia.

The Red Guards, led by Ali Aaltonen, refused to recognise the Whites&#x27; hegemony and established a military authority of their own. Aaltonen installed his headquarters in Helsinki and nicknamed it Smolna echoing the Smolny Institute, the Bolsheviks&#x27; headquarters in Petrograd. The Red Order of Revolution was issued on 26 January, and a red lantern, a symbolic indicator of the uprising, was lit in the tower of the Helsinki Workers&#x27; House. A large-scale mobilisation of the Reds began late in the evening of 27 January, with the Helsinki Red Guard and some of the Guards located along the Viipuri-Tampere railway having been activated between 23 and 26 January, in order to safeguard vital positions and escort a heavy railroad shipment of Bolshevik weapons from Petrograd to Finland. White troops tried to capture the shipment: 20‚Äì30 Finns, Red and White, died in the Battle of K√§m√§r√§ at the Karelian Isthmus on 27 January 1918. The Finnish rivalry for power had culminated.

===Opposing parties===

====Red Finland and White Finland====
At the beginning of the war, a discontinuous front line ran through southern Finland from west to east, dividing the country into White Finland and Red Finland. The Red Guards controlled the area to the south, including nearly all the major towns and industrial centres, along with the largest estates and farms with the highest numbers of crofters and tenant farmers. The White Army controlled the area to the north, which was predominantly agrarian and contained small or medium-sized farms and tenant farmers. The number of crofters was lower and they held a better social status than those in the south. Enclaves of the opposing forces existed on both sides of the front line: within the White area lay the industrial towns of Varkaus, Kuopio, Oulu, Raahe, Kemi and Tornio; within the Red area lay Porvoo, Kirkkonummi and Uusikaupunki. The elimination of these strongholds was a priority for both armies in February 1918.

Red Finland was led by the Finnish People&#x27;s Delegation (; ), established on 28 January 1918 in Helsinki, which was supervised by the Central Workers&#x27; Council. The delegation sought democratic socialism based on the Finnish Social Democratic Party&#x27;s ethos; their visions differed from Lenin&#x27;s dictatorship of the proletariat. Otto Ville Kuusinen formulated a proposal for a new constitution, influenced by those of Switzerland and the United States. With it, political power was to be concentrated to Parliament, with a lesser role for a government. The proposal included a multi-party system; freedom of assembly, speech and press; and the use of referendums in political decision-making. In order to ensure the authority of the labour movement, the common people would have a right to permanent revolution. The socialists planned to transfer a substantial part of property rights to the state and local administrations.

In foreign policy, Red Finland leaned on Bolshevist Russia. A Red-initiated Finno‚ÄìRussian treaty and peace agreement was signed on 1 March 1918, where Red Finland was called the Finnish Socialist Workers&#x27; Republic (; ). The negotiations for the treaty implied that ‚Äì as in World War I in general ‚Äì nationalism was more important for both sides than the principles of international socialism. The Red Finns did not simply accept an alliance with the Bolsheviks and major disputes appeared, for example, over the demarcation of the border between Red Finland and Soviet Russia. The significance of the Russo‚ÄìFinnish Treaty evaporated quickly due to the signing of the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk between the Bolsheviks and the German Empire on 3 March 1918.

Lenin&#x27;s policy on the right of nations to self-determination aimed at preventing the disintegration of Russia during the period of military weakness. He assumed that in war-torn, splintering Europe, the proletariat of free nations would carry out socialist revolutions and unite with Soviet Russia later. The majority of the Finnish labour movement supported Finland&#x27;s independence. The Finnish Bolsheviks, influential, though few in number, favoured annexation of Finland by Russia.

The government of White Finland, Pehr Evind Svinhufvud&#x27;s first senate, was called the Vaasa Senate after its relocation to the safer west-coast city of Vaasa, which acted as the capital of the Whites from 29 January to 3 May 1918. In domestic policy, the White Senate&#x27;s main goal was to return the political right to power in Finland. The conservatives planned a monarchist political system, with a lesser role for Parliament. A section of the conservatives had always supported monarchy and opposed democracy; others had approved of parliamentarianism since the revolutionary reform of 1906, but after the crisis of 1917‚Äì1918, concluded that empowering the common people would not work. Social liberals and reformist non-socialists opposed any restriction of parliamentarianism. They initially resisted German military help, but the prolonged warfare changed their stance.

In foreign policy, the Vaasa Senate relied on the German Empire for military and political aid. Their objective was to defeat the Finnish Reds; end the influence of Bolshevist Russia in Finland and expand Finnish territory to East Karelia, a geopolitically significant home to people speaking Finnic languages. The weakness of Russia inspired an idea of Greater Finland among the expansionist factions of both the right and left: the Reds had claims concerning the same areas. General Mannerheim agreed on the need to take over East Karelia and to request German weapons, but opposed actual German intervention in Finland. Mannerheim recognised the Red Guards&#x27; lack of combat skill and trusted in the abilities of the German-trained Finnish J√§gers. As a former Russian army officer, Mannerheim was well aware of the demoralisation of the Russian army. He co-operated with White-aligned Russian officers in Finland and Russia.

====Aviation====
During the war, the Red Guard utilized aircraft, however, little information regarding their activities and the organisation of detachments was preserved. Its various operations included bombings, reconnaissance, spreading of propaganda literature, and connection flights. Since the Reds had no Finnish pilots, they solely relied on foreign pilots, most of whom were Russian. The Reds had four main operational flight detachments located in Helsinki, Tampere, Kouvola and Viipuri. They divided their detachments into three fronts. The northern front, which was overseen by the detachment in Tampere, consisted of the red troops between the Gulf of Bothnia and Lake P√§ij√§nne. The central front was between the Lake P√§ij√§nne and Lake Saimaa that was operated by the Kouvola detachment. The base in Viipuri acted as the base for the eastern front, which was located between Lake Saimaa and the national border. Due to poor central command, inadequate fuel quality, low training experience, and poor maintenance, the aerial activity of the Reds was scattered and ineffective.

 The White Guard&#x27;s also had aircraft during the course of the war, which would later evolve into the Finnish Air Force. In February 1918, the Whites would have received an aircraft donation of a reconnaissance and training plane from Sweden, the NAB Type 9 Albatros, however its transport to Vaasa was stopped when the ferry&#x27;s engine failed at Jakobstad. Therefore, the first plane to officially arrive to the Whites was the license manufactured Morane-Saulnier MS Parasol/Thulin D donated on 6 March 1918 by Swedish Count Eric von Rosen. The aircraft carried Rosen&#x27;s personal symbol of luck, a right-facing, blue swastika. The symbol was further adopted as the official insignia of the Finnish Air Force till the end of World War II. During the war, the Whites obtained seven additional aircraft which included four Friedrichshafens, two DFWs, and one Rumpler, all of which were bought from Germany. Like the Reds, the Whites also had no domestic pilots and relied on Swedish, Danish, and Russian pilots. The White Guard had two flight detachments during the war; one based at Kolho in northern Pirkanmaa and the other at Antrea in the Viipuri Province. They carried out rather small operations of reconnaissance, leaflet drops, and bombings.

====Soldiers and weapons====
The number of Finnish troops on each side varied from 70,000 to 90,000 and both had around 100,000 rifles, 300‚Äì400 machine guns and a few hundred cannons. While the Red Guards consisted mostly of volunteers, with wages paid at the beginning of the war, the White Army consisted predominantly of conscripts with 11,000‚Äì15,000 volunteers. The main motives for volunteering were socio-economic factors, such as salary and food, as well as idealism and peer pressure. The Red Guards included 2,600 women, mostly recruited from the industrial centres and cities of southern Finland. Urban and agricultural workers constituted the majority of the Red Guards, whereas land-owning farmers and well-educated people formed the backbone of the White Army. Both armies used child soldiers, mainly between 14 and 17 years of age. The use of juvenile soldiers was not rare in World War I; children of the time were under the absolute authority of adults and were not shielded against exploitation.

Rifles and machine guns from Imperial Russia were the main armaments of the Reds and the Whites. The most commonly used rifle was the Russian 
7.62mm (.30 cal) Mosin‚ÄìNagant Model 1891. In total, around ten different rifle models were in service, causing problems for ammunition supply. The Maxim gun was the most-used machine gun, along with the less-used M1895 Colt‚ÄìBrowning, Lewis and Madsen guns. The machine guns caused a substantial part of the casualties in combat. Russian field guns were mostly used with direct fire.

The Civil War was fought primarily along railways; vital means for transporting troops and supplies, as well for using armoured trains, equipped with light cannons and heavy machine guns. The strategically most important railway junction was Haapam√§ki, approximately northeast of Tampere, connecting eastern and western Finland and as well as southern and northern Finland. Other critical junctions included Kouvola, Riihim√§ki, Tampere, Toijala and Viipuri. The Whites captured Haapam√§ki at the end of January 1918, leading to the Battle of Vilppula.

====Red Guards and Soviet troops====
The Finnish Red Guards seized the early initiative in the war by taking control of Helsinki on 28 January 1918 and by undertaking a general offensive lasting from February till early March 1918. The Reds were relatively well-armed, but a chronic shortage of skilled leaders, both at the command level and in the field, left them unable to capitalise on this momentum, and most of the offensives came to nothing. The military chain of command functioned relatively well at company and platoon level, but leadership and authority remained weak as most of the field commanders were chosen by the vote of the troops. The common troops were more or less armed civilians, whose military training, discipline and combat morale were both inadequate and low.

Ali Aaltonen was replaced on 28 January 1918 by Eero Haapalainen as commander-in-chief. He, in turn, was displaced by the Bolshevik triumvirate of Eino Rahja, Adolf Taimi and Evert Eloranta on 20 March. The last commander-in-chief of the Red Guard was Kullervo Manner, from 10 April until the last period of the war when the Reds no longer had a named leader. Some talented local commanders, such as Hugo Salmela in the Battle of Tampere, provided successful leadership, but could not change the course of the war. The Reds achieved some local victories as they retreated from southern Finland toward Russia, such as against German troops in the Battle of Syrj√§ntaka on 28‚Äì29 April in Tuulos.

Around 50,000 of the former tsar&#x27;s army troops were stationed in Finland in January 1918. The soldiers were demoralised and war-weary, and the former serfs were thirsty for farmland set free by the revolutions. The majority of the troops returned to Russia by the end of March 1918. In total, 7,000 to 10,000 Red Russian soldiers supported the Finnish Reds, but only around 3,000, in separate, smaller units of 100‚Äì1,000 soldiers, could be persuaded to fight in the front line.

The revolutions in Russia divided the Soviet army officers politically and their attitude towards the Finnish Civil War varied. Mikhail Svechnikov led Finnish Red troops in western Finland in February and Konstantin Yeremejev Soviet forces on the Karelian Isthmus, while other officers were mistrustful of their revolutionary peers and instead co-operated with General Mannerheim, in disarming Soviet garrisons in Finland. On 30 January 1918, Mannerheim proclaimed to Russian soldiers in Finland that the White Army did not fight against Russia, but that the objective of the White campaign was to beat the Finnish Reds and the Soviet troops supporting them.

The number of Soviet soldiers active in the civil war declined markedly once Germany attacked Russia on 18 February 1918. The German-Soviet Treaty of Brest-Litovsk of 3 March restricted the Bolsheviks&#x27; support for the Finnish Reds to weapons and supplies. The Soviets remained active on the south-eastern front, mainly in the Battle of Rautu on the Karelian Isthmus between February and April 1918, where they defended the approaches to Petrograd.

====White Guards and Sweden&#x27;s role====

While the conflict has been called by some, &quot;The War of Amateurs&quot;, the White Army had two major advantages over the Red Guards: the professional military leadership of Gustaf Mannerheim and his staff, which included 84 Swedish volunteer officers and former Finnish officers of the tsar&#x27;s army; and 1,450 soldiers of the 1,900-strong, J√§ger battalion. The majority of the unit arrived in Vaasa on 25 February 1918. On the battlefield, the J√§gers, battle-hardened on the Eastern Front, provided strong leadership that made disciplined combat of the common White troopers possible. The soldiers were similar to those of the Reds, having brief and inadequate training. At the beginning of the war, the White Guards&#x27; top leadership had little authority over volunteer White units, which obeyed only their local leaders. At the end of February, the J√§gers started a rapid training of six conscript regiments.

The J√§ger battalion was politically divided, too. Four-hundred-and-fifty ‚Äìmostly socialist‚Äì J√§gers remained stationed in Germany, as it was feared they were likely to side with the Reds. White Guard leaders faced a similar problem when drafting young men to the army in February 1918: 30,000 obvious supporters of the Finnish labour movement never showed up. It was also uncertain whether common troops drafted from the small-sized and poor farms of central and northern Finland had strong enough motivation to fight the Finnish Reds. The Whites&#x27; propaganda promoted the idea that they were fighting a defensive war against Bolshevist Russians, and belittled the role of the Red Finns among their enemies. Social divisions appeared both between southern and northern Finland and within rural Finland. The economy and society of the north had modernised more slowly than that of the south. There was a more pronounced conflict between Christianity and socialism in the north, and the ownership of farmland conferred major social status, motivating the farmers to fight against the Reds.

Sweden declared neutrality both during World War I and the Finnish Civil War. General opinion, in particular among the Swedish elite, was divided between supporters of the Allies and the Central powers, Germanism being somewhat more popular. Three war-time priorities determined the pragmatic policy of the Swedish liberal-social democratic government: sound economics, with export of iron-ore and foodstuff to Germany; sustaining the tranquility of Swedish society; and geopolitics. The government accepted the participation of Swedish volunteer officers and soldiers in the Finnish White Army in order to block expansion of revolutionary unrest to Scandinavia.

A 1,000-strong paramilitary Swedish Brigade, led by Hjalmar Frisell, took part in the Battle of Tampere and in the fighting south of the town. In February 1918, the Swedish Navy escorted the German naval squadron transporting Finnish J√§gers and German weapons and allowed it to pass through Swedish territorial waters. The Swedish socialists tried to open peace negotiations between the Whites and the Reds. The weakness of Finland offered Sweden a chance to take over the geopolitically vital Finnish √Öland Islands, east of Stockholm, but the German army&#x27;s Finland operation stalled this plan.

====German intervention====

In March 1918, the German Empire intervened in the Finnish Civil War on the side of the White Army. Finnish activists leaning on Germanism had been seeking German aid in freeing Finland from Soviet hegemony since late 1917, but because of the pressure they were facing at the Western Front, the Germans did not want to jeopardise their armistice and peace negotiations with the Soviet Union. The German stance changed after 10 February when Leon Trotsky, despite the weakness of the Bolsheviks&#x27; position, broke off negotiations, hoping revolutions would break out in the German Empire and change everything. On 13 February, the German leadership decided to retaliate and send military detachments to Finland too. As a pretext for aggression, the Germans invited &quot;requests for help&quot; from the western neighbouring countries of Russia. Representatives of White Finland in Berlin duly requested help on 14 February.

The Imperial German Army attacked Russia on 18 February. The offensive led to a rapid collapse of the Soviet forces and to the signing of the first Treaty of Brest-Litovsk by the Bolsheviks on 3 March 1918. Finland, the Baltic countries, Poland and Ukraine were transferred to the German sphere of influence. The Finnish Civil War opened a low-cost access route to Fennoscandia, where the geopolitical status was altered as a Royal Navy squadron occupied the Soviet harbour of Murmansk by the Arctic Ocean on 9 March 1918. The leader of the German war effort, General Erich Ludendorff, wanted to keep Petrograd under threat of attack via the Viipuri-Narva area and to install a German-led monarchy in Finland.

On 5 March 1918, a German naval squadron landed on the √Öland Islands (in mid-February 1918, the islands had been occupied by a Swedish military expedition, which departed from there in May). On 3 April 1918, the 10,000-strong Baltic Sea Division (), led by General R√ºdiger von der Goltz, launched the main attack at Hanko, west of Helsinki. It was followed on 7 April by Colonel Otto von Brandenstein&#x27;s 3,000-strong Detachment Brandenstein () taking the town of Loviisa east of Helsinki. The larger German formations advanced eastwards from Hanko and took Helsinki on 12‚Äì13 April, while Detachment Brandenstein overran the town of Lahti on 19 April. The main German detachment proceeded northwards from Helsinki and took Hyvink√§√§ and Riihim√§ki on 21‚Äì22 April, followed by H√§meenlinna on 26 April. The final blow to the cause of the Finnish Reds was dealt when the Bolsheviks broke off the peace negotiations at Brest-Litovsk, leading to the German eastern offensive in February 1918.

===Decisive engagements===

====Battle of Tampere====

In February 1918, General Mannerheim deliberated on where to focus the general offensive of the Whites. There were two strategically vital enemy strongholds: Tampere, Finland&#x27;s major industrial town in the south-west, and Viipuri, Karelia&#x27;s main city. Although seizing Viipuri offered many advantages, his army&#x27;s lack of combat skills and the potential for a major counterattack by the Reds in the area or in the south-west made it too risky.

Mannerheim decided to strike first at Tampere, despite the fact that the town, mostly known for its working class, housed nearly 15,000 heavily armed Red Guards. He launched the main assault on 16 March 1918, at L√§ngelm√§ki north-east of the town, through the right flank of the Reds&#x27; defence. At the same time, the Whites attacked through the north-western frontline Vilppula‚ÄìKuru‚ÄìKyr√∂skoski‚ÄìSuodenniemi. Although the Whites were unaccustomed to offensive warfare, some Red Guard units collapsed and retreated in panic under the weight of the offensive, while other Red detachments defended their posts to the last and were able to slow the advance of the White troops. Eventually, the Whites lay siege to Tampere. They cut off the Reds&#x27; southward connection at Lemp√§√§l√§ on 24 March and westward ones at Siuro, Nokia, and Yl√∂j√§rvi on 25 March.

A [[propaganda]] leaflet signed by [[General Mannerheim]] circulated by the Whites urging the Red defenders to surrender. [
The Battle for Tampere was fought between 16,000 White and 14,000 Red soldiers. It was Finland&#x27;s first large-scale urban battle and one of the four most decisive military engagements of the war. The fight for the area of Tampere began on 28 March, on the eve of Easter 1918, later called &quot;Bloody Maundy Thursday&quot;, in the Kalevankangas Cemetery. The White Army did not achieve a decisive victory in the fierce combat, suffering more than 50 per cent losses in some of their units. The Whites had to re-organise their troops and battle plans, managing to raid the town centre in the early hours of 3 April.

After a heavy, concentrated artillery barrage, the White Guards advanced from house to house and street to street, as the Red Guards retreated. In the late evening of 3 April, the Whites reached the eastern banks of the Tammerkoski rapids. The Reds&#x27; attempts to break the siege of Tampere from the outside along the Helsinki-Tampere railway failed. The Red Guards lost the western parts of the town between 4 and 5 April. The Tampere City Hall was among the last strongholds of the Reds. The battle ended 6 April 1918 with the surrender of Red forces in the Pyynikki and Pispala sections of Tampere.

The Reds, now on the defensive, showed increased motivation to fight during the battle. General Mannerheim was compelled to deploy some of the best-trained J√§ger detachments, initially meant to be conserved for later use in the Viipuri area. The Battle of Tampere was the bloodiest action of the Civil War. The White Army lost 700‚Äì900 men, including 50 J√§gers, the highest number of deaths the J√§ger battalion suffered in a single battle of the 1918 war. The Red Guards lost 1,000‚Äì1,500 soldiers, with a further 11,000‚Äì12,000 captured. Seventy-one civilians died, mainly due to artillery fire. The eastern parts of the city, consisting mostly of wooden buildings, were completely destroyed.

====Battle of Helsinki====
After peace talks between Germans and the Finnish Reds were broken off on 11 April 1918, the battle for the capital of Finland began. At 05:00 on 12 April, around 2,000‚Äì3,000 German Baltic Sea Division soldiers, led by Colonel Hans von Tschirsky und von B√∂gendorff, attacked the city from the north-west, supported via the Helsinki-Turku railway. The Germans broke through the area between Munkkiniemi and Pasila, and advanced on the central-western parts of the town. The German naval squadron led by Vice Admiral Hugo Meurer blocked the city harbour, bombarded the southern town area, and landed &quot;Seebataillon&quot; marines at Katajanokka.

Around 7,000 Finnish Reds defended Helsinki, but their best troops fought on other fronts of the war. The main strongholds of the Red defence were the Workers&#x27; Hall, the Helsinki railway station, the Red Headquarters at Smolna, the Senate Palace‚ÄìHelsinki University area and the former Russian garrisons. By the late evening of 12 April, most of the southern parts and all of the western area of the city had been occupied by the Germans. Local Helsinki White Guards, having hidden in the city during the war, joined the battle as the Germans advanced through the town.

On 13 April, German troops took over the Market Square, the Smolna, the Presidential Palace and the Senate-Ritarihuone area. Toward the end, a German brigade with 2,000‚Äì3,000 soldiers, led by Colonel Kondrad Wolf joined the battle. The unit rushed from north to the eastern parts of Helsinki, pushing into the working-class neighbourhoods of Hermanni, Kallio and S√∂rn√§inen. German artillery bombarded and destroyed the Workers&#x27; Hall and put out the red lantern of the Finnish revolution. The eastern parts of the town surrendered around 14:00 on 13 April, when a white flag was raised in the tower of the Kallio Church. Sporadic fighting lasted until the evening. In total, 60 Germans, 300‚Äì400 Reds and 23 White Guard troopers were killed in the battle. Around 7,000 Reds were captured. The German army celebrated the victory with a military parade in the centre of Helsinki on 14 April 1918.

====Battle of Hyvink√§√§====
After losing Helsinki, the Red Defense Command moved to Riihim√§ki, where it was headed by painter and congressman Efraim Kronqvist. The Germans troops, led by Major General Konrad Wolf, on the other hand, attacked Helsinki north on April 15 and conquered Klaukkala four days later, continuing from there to H√§meenlinna. In that connection, the Battle of Hyvink√§√§ took place in the town of Hyvink√§√§, in connection with which killed 21 Germans and about 50 Red Guards. After the battle, at least 150 of the Reds were executed by the Whites.

====Battle of Lahti====

On 19 April 1918, Detachment Brandenstein took over the town of Lahti. The German troops advanced from the east-southeast via Nastola, through the Mustankallio graveyard in Salpausselk√§ and the Russian garrisons at Hennala. The battle was minor but strategically important as it cut the connection between the western and eastern Red Guards. Local engagements broke out in the town and the surrounding area between 22 April and 1 May 1918 as several thousand western Red Guards and Red civilian refugees tried to push through on their way to Russia. The German troops were able to hold major parts of the town and halt the Red advance. In total, 600 Reds and 80 German soldiers perished, and 30,000 Reds were captured in and around Lahti.

====Battle of Viipuri====

After the defeat in Tampere, the Red Guards began a slow retreat eastwards. As the German army seized Helsinki, the White Army shifted the military focus to Viipuri area, where 18,500 Whites advanced against 15,000 defending Reds. General Mannerheim&#x27;s war plan had been revised as a result of the Battle for Tampere, a civilian, industrial town. He aimed to avoid new, complex city combat in Viipuri, an old military fortress. The J√§ger detachments tried to tie down and destroy the Red force outside the town. The Whites were able to cut the Reds&#x27; connection to Petrograd and weaken the troops on the Karelian Isthmus on 20‚Äì26 April, but the decisive blow remained to be dealt in Viipuri. The final attack began on late 27 April with a heavy J√§ger artillery barrage. The Reds&#x27; defence collapsed gradually, and eventually the Whites conquered ‚Äîthe Reds&#x27; symbolic last stand of the 1918 uprising‚Äîin the early hours of 29 April 1918. In total, 400 Whites died, and 500‚Äì600 Reds perished and 12,000‚Äì15,000 were captured.

===Red and White terror===

 Both Whites and Reds carried out political violence through executions, respectively termed White Terror (; ) and Red Terror (; ). Large-scale terror operations were born and bred in Europe during World War I, the first total war. The February and October Revolutions initiated similar violence in Finland: at first by Russian army troops executing their officers, and then later between the Finnish Whites and Reds.

The terror consisted of a calculated aspect of general warfare and, on the other hand, the local, personal murders and corresponding acts of revenge. In the former, the commanding staff planned and organised the actions and gave orders to the lower ranks. At least a third of the Red terror and most of the White terror was centrally led. In February 1918, a &quot;Desk of Securing Occupied Areas&quot; was implemented by the highest-ranking White staff, and the White troops were given &quot;Instructions for Wartime Judicature&quot;, later called the Shoot on the Spot Declaration. This order authorised field commanders to execute essentially anyone they saw fit. No order by the less-organised, highest Red Guard leadership authorising Red Terror has been found.

The main goals of the terror were to destroy the command structure of the enemy; to clear and secure the areas governed and occupied by armies; and to create shock and fear among the civil population and the enemy soldiers. Additionally, the common troops&#x27; paramilitary nature and their lack of combat skills drove them to use political violence as a military weapon. Most of the executions were carried out by cavalry units called Flying Patrols, consisting of 10 to 80 soldiers aged 15 to 20 and led by an experienced, adult leader with absolute authority. The patrols, specialised in search and destroy operations and death squad tactics, were similar to German Sturmbattalions and Russian Assault units organized during World War I. The terror achieved some of its objectives but also gave additional motivation to fight against an enemy perceived to be inhuman and cruel. Both Red and White propaganda made effective use of their opponents&#x27; actions, increasing the spiral of revenge.
The Red Guards executed influential Whites, including politicians, major landowners, industrialists, police officers, civil servants and teachers as well as White Guards. Ten priests of the Evangelical Lutheran Church and 90 moderate socialists were killed. The number of executions varied over the war months, peaking in February as the Reds secured power, but March saw low counts because the Reds could not seize new areas outside of the original frontlines. The numbers rose again in April as the Reds aimed to leave Finland. The two major centres for Red Terror were Toijala and Kouvola, where 300‚Äì350 Whites were executed between February and April 1918.

The White Guards executed Red Guard and party leaders, Red troops, socialist members of the Finnish Parliament and local Red administrators, and workers. The numbers varied over the months as the Whites conquered southern Finland. Comprehensive White Terror started with their general offensive in March 1918 and increased constantly. It peaked at the end of the war and declined and ceased after the enemy troops had been transferred to prison camps. During the high point of the executions, between the end of April and the beginning of May, 200 Reds were shot per day. White Terror was decisive against Russian soldiers who assisted the Finnish Reds, and several Russian non-socialist civilians were killed in the Viipuri massacre, the aftermath of the Battle of Viipuri.

In total, 1,650 Whites died as a result of Red Terror, while around 10,000 Reds perished by White Terror, which turned into political cleansing. White victims have been recorded exactly, while the number of Red troops executed immediately after battles remains unclear. Together with the harsh prison-camp treatment of the Reds during 1918, the executions inflicted the deepest mental scars on the Finns, regardless of their political allegiance. Some of those who carried out the killings were traumatised, a phenomenon that was later documented.

===End===
On 8 April 1918, after the defeat in Tampere and the German army intervention, the People&#x27;s Delegation retreated from Helsinki to Viipuri. The loss of Helsinki pushed them to Petrograd on 25 April. The escape of the leadership embittered many Reds, and thousands of them tried to flee to Russia, but most of the refugees were encircled by White and German troops. In the Lahti area they surrendered on 1‚Äì2 May. The long Red caravans included women and children, who experienced a desperate, chaotic escape with severe losses due to White attacks. The scene was described as a &quot;road of tears&quot; for the Reds, but for the Whites, the sight of long, enemy caravans heading east was a victorious moment. The Red Guards&#x27; last strongholds between the Kouvola and Kotka area fell by 5 May, after the Battle of Ahvenkoski. The war of 1918 ended on 15 May 1918, when the Whites took over Fort Ino, a Russian coastal artillery base on the Karelian Isthmus, from the Russian troops. White Finland and General Mannerheim celebrated the victory with a large military parade in Helsinki on 16 May 1918.

The Red Guards had been defeated. The Finnish labour movement had lost the Civil War, several military leaders committed suicide and a majority of the Reds were sent to prison camps. The Vaasa Senate returned to Helsinki on 4 May 1918, but the capital was under the control of the German Army. White Finland had become a protectorate of the German Empire and General R√ºdiger von der Goltz was called &quot;the true Regent of Finland&quot;. No armistice or peace negotiations were carried out between the Whites and Reds and an official peace treaty to end the Finnish Civil War was never signed.

==Aftermath and impact==

===Casualties===
Casualties of Finnish Civil War were according to a Finnish Government project (2004): Died in battle: White Guard 3,414, Red Guard 5,199; Missing: whites 46, reds 1,767; Executed: whites 1,424, reds 7,370; Died in prison camps: whites 4, reds 11,652 ‚Äì total deaths 36,640.

===Prison camps===
The White Army and German troops captured around 80,000 Red prisoners, including 5,000 women, 1,500 children and 8,000 Russians. The largest prison camps were Suomenlinna (an island facing Helsinki), H√§meenlinna, Lahti, Riihim√§ki, Tammisaari, Tampere and Viipuri. The Senate decided to keep the prisoners detained until each individual&#x27;s role in the Civil War had been investigated. Legislation making provision for a Treason Court (; ) was enacted on 29 May 1918. The judicature of the 145 inferior courts led by the Supreme Treason Court (; ) did not meet the standards of impartiality, due to the condemnatory atmosphere of White Finland. In total 76,000 cases were examined and 68,000 Reds were convicted, primarily for treason; 39,000 were released on parole while the mean-length of punishment for the rest was two to four years in jail. 555 people were sentenced to death, of whom 113 were executed. The trials revealed that some innocent adults had been imprisoned.

Combined with the severe food shortages caused by the Civil War, mass imprisonment led to high mortality rates in the prison camps, and the catastrophe was compounded by the angry, punitive and uncaring mentality of the victors. Female Red Guard prisoners were often subjected to brutal rapes. Many prisoners felt that they had been abandoned by their own leaders, who had fled to Russia. The physical and mental condition of the prisoners declined in May 1918. Many prisoners had been sent to the camps in Tampere and Helsinki in the first half of April and food supplies were disrupted during the Reds&#x27; eastward retreat. Consequently, in June 2,900 prisoners starved to death, or died as a result of diseases caused by malnutrition or the Spanish flu: 5,000 in July; 2,200 in August; and 1,000 in September. The mortality rate was highest in the Tammisaari camp at 34 per cent, while the rate varied between 5 per cent and 20 per cent in the others. In total, around 12,500 Finns perished (3,000‚Äì4,000 due to the Spanish flu) while detained. The dead were buried in mass graves near the camps, of which more than 2,500 Red Guards have been buried in the large mass grave located in the Kalevankangas Cemetery. Moreover, 700 severely weakened prisoners died soon after release from the camps.

Most prisoners were paroled or pardoned by the end of 1918, after a shift in the political situation. There were 6,100 Red prisoners left at the end of the year and 4,000 at the end of 1919. In January 1920, 3,000 prisoners were pardoned and civil rights were returned to 40,000 former Reds. In 1927, the Social Democratic Party government led by V√§in√∂ Tanner pardoned the last 50 prisoners. The Finnish government paid reparations to 11,600 prisoners in 1973. The traumatic hardships of the prison camps increased support for communism in Finland.

===War-torn nation===

The Civil War was a catastrophe for Finland: around 36,000 people ‚Äì 1.2 per cent of the population ‚Äì perished. The war left approximately 15,000 children orphaned. Most of the casualties occurred outside the battlefields: in the prison camps and the terror campaigns. Many Reds fled to Russia at the end of the war and during the period that followed. The fear, bitterness and trauma caused by the war deepened the divisions within Finnish society and many moderate Finns identified themselves as &quot;citizens of two nations.&quot; During the war and after that, the warring sides have been derogatively referred to as &quot;butchers&quot; (for Whites; ) and &quot;red russkies&quot; (for Reds; or &quot;punaryss√§&quot;) or just &quot;commies&quot;. Among the Reds in particular, the loss of the war caused such bitterness that some of those who fled behind the eastern border tried to carry out the assassination of General Mannerheim during a White Guard&#x27;s victory parade of Tampere in 1920, with poor results.

The conflict caused disintegration within both socialist and non-socialist factions. The rightward shift of power caused a dispute between conservatives and liberals on the best system of government for Finland to adopt: the former demanded monarchy and restricted parliamentarianism; the latter demanded a democratic republic. Both sides justified their views on political and legal grounds. The monarchists leaned on the Swedish regime&#x27;s 1772 monarchist constitution (accepted by Russia in 1809), belittled the Declaration of Independence of 1917, and proposed a modernised, monarchist constitution for Finland. The republicans argued that the 1772 law lost validity in the February Revolution, that the authority of the Russian tsar was assumed by the Finnish Parliament on 15 November 1917, and that the Republic of Finland had been adopted on 6 December that year. The republicans were able to halt the passage of the monarchists&#x27; proposal in Parliament. The royalists responded by applying the 1772 law to select a new monarch for the country without reference to Parliament.

The Finnish labour movement was divided into three parts: moderate social democrats in Finland; radical socialists in Finland; and communists in Soviet Russia. The Social Democratic Party had its first official party meeting after the Civil War on 25 December 1918, at which the party proclaimed a commitment to parliamentary means and disavowed Bolshevism and communism. The leaders of Red Finland, who had fled to Russia, established the Communist Party of Finland (SKP) () in Moscow on 29 August 1918. After the power struggle of 1917 and the bloody civil war, the former Fennomans and the social democrats who had supported &quot;ultra-democratic&quot; means in Red Finland declared a commitment to revolutionary Bolshevism‚Äìcommunism and to the dictatorship of the proletariat, under the control of Lenin. Between the party&#x27;s creation in 1918 and its official banning in 1930, the Social Democracy Party opposed the activity of the SKP while the Communists influenced socialist and agrarian parliamentary groups. In January 1922, the Socialist Workers&#x27; Party of Finland (SSTP), a group of communists and other far-left socialists, had members of its executive committee arrested and later several hundred other members, including members of Parliament arrested in August 1923. In 1925, those arrested were convicted of plotting and assisting treason against the state. In December 1929, Parliament passed bills that further deprived the party of political rights and by November 1930, the party was officially illegal, a policy that would remain until the 1944 Moscow Armistice.

In May 1918, a conservative-monarchist Senate was formed by J. K. Paasikivi, and the Senate asked the German troops to remain in Finland. 3 March 1918 Treaty of Brest-Litovsk and 7 March German-Finnish agreements bound White Finland to the German Empire&#x27;s sphere of influence. General Mannerheim resigned his post on 25 May after disagreements with the Senate about German hegemony over Finland, and about his planned attack on Petrograd to repulse the Bolsheviks and capture Russian Karelia. The Germans opposed these plans due to their peace treaties with Lenin. The Civil War weakened the Finnish Parliament; it became a Rump Parliament that included only three socialist representatives.

On 9 October 1918, under pressure from Germany, the Senate and Parliament elected a German prince, Friedrich Karl, the brother-in-law of German Emperor William II, to become the King of Finland. The German leadership was able to utilise the breakdown of Russia for the geopolitical benefit of the German Empire in Fennoscandia also. The Civil War and the aftermath diminished independence of Finland, compared to the status it had held at the turn of the year 1917‚Äì1918.

The economic condition of Finland deteriorated drastically from 1918; recovery to pre-conflict levels was achieved only in 1925. The most acute crisis was in food supply, already deficient in 1917, though large-scale starvation had been avoided that year. The Civil War caused marked starvation in southern Finland. Late in 1918, Finnish politician Rudolf Holsti appealed for relief to Herbert Hoover, the American chairman of the Committee for Relief in Belgium. Hoover arranged for the delivery of food shipments and persuaded the Allies to relax their blockade of the Baltic Sea, which had obstructed food supplies to Finland, and to allow food into the country.

===Compromise===

On 15 March 1917, the fate of Finns had been decided outside Finland, in Petrograd. On 11 November 1918, the future of the nation was determined in Berlin, as a result of Germany&#x27;s surrender to end World War I. The German Empire collapsed in the German Revolution of 1918‚Äì19, caused by lack of food, war-weariness and defeat in the battles of the Western Front. General R√ºdiger von der Goltz and his division left Helsinki on 16 December 1918, and Prince Friedrich Karl, who had not yet been crowned, abandoned his role four days later. Finland&#x27;s status shifted from a monarchist protectorate of the German Empire to an independent republic. The new system of government was confirmed by the Constitution Act (; ) on 17 July 1919.

The first local elections based on universal suffrage in Finland were held during 17‚Äì28 December 1918, and the first free parliamentary election took place after the Civil War on 3 March 1919. The United States and the United Kingdom recognised Finnish sovereignty on 6‚Äì7 May 1919. The Western powers demanded the establishment of democratic republics in post-war Europe, to lure the masses away from widespread revolutionary movements. The Finno‚ÄìRussian Treaty of Tartu was signed on 14 October 1920, with the aim of stabilizing political relations between Finland and Russia and settling the border question.

In April 1918, the leading Finnish social liberal and the eventual first President of Finland, Kaarlo Juho St√•hlberg wrote: &quot;It is urgent to get the life and development in this country back on the path that we had already reached in 1906 and which the turmoil of war turned us away from.&quot; Moderate social democrat V√§in√∂ Voionmaa agonised in 1919: &quot;Those who still trust in the future of this nation must have an exceptionally strong faith. This young independent country has lost almost everything due to the war.&quot; Voionmaa was a vital companion for the leader of the reformed Social Democratic Party, V√§in√∂ Tanner.

Santeri Alkio supported moderate politics. His party colleague, Ky√∂sti Kallio urged in his Nivala address of 5 May 1918: &quot;We must rebuild a Finnish nation, which is not divided into the Reds and Whites. We have to establish a democratic Finnish republic, where all the Finns can feel that we are true citizens and members of this society.&quot; In the end, many of the moderate Finnish conservatives followed the thinking of National Coalition Party member Lauri Ingman, who wrote in early 1918: &quot;A political turn more to the right will not help us now, instead it would strengthen the support of socialism in this country.&quot;

Together with other broad-minded Finns, the new partnership constructed a Finnish compromise which eventually delivered a stable and broad parliamentary democracy. The compromise was based both on the defeat of the Reds in the Civil War and the fact that most of the Whites&#x27; political goals had not been achieved. After foreign forces left Finland, the militant factions of the Reds and the Whites lost their backing, while the pre-1918 cultural and national integrity and the legacy of Fennomania stood out among the Finns.

The weakness of both Germany and Russia after World War I empowered Finland and made a peaceful, domestic Finnish social and political settlement possible. A reconciliation process led to a slow and painful, but steady, national unification. In the end, the power vacuum and interregnum of 1917‚Äì1919 gave way to the Finnish compromise. From 1919 to the present, the democracy and sovereignty of the Finns withstood challenges from right-wing and left-wing political radicalism, the Soviet invasion of 1939 and the other crisis of World War II, pressure from the Soviet Union during the Cold War and threat of Russia in &quot;Bellum Russica&quot; since 2014.

==In popular culture==

===Literature===
Despite the fact that the Civil War was one of the most sensitive and controversial topics more than a hundred years later in Finland, still between 1918 and the 1950s, mainstream literature and poetry presented the 1918 war from the White victors&#x27; point of view, with works such as the &quot;Psalm of the Cannons&quot; () by in 1918. In poetry, Bertel Gripenberg, who had volunteered for the White Army, celebrated its cause in &quot;The Great Age&quot; () in 1928 and V. A. Koskenniemi in &quot;Young Anthony&quot; () in 1918. The war tales of the Reds were kept silent.

The first neutrally critical books were written soon after the war, notably, &quot;Devout Misery&quot; () written by the Nobel Prize laureate Frans Emil Sillanp√§√§ in 1919; &quot;Dead Apple Trees&quot; () by Joel Lehtonen in 1918; and &quot;Homecoming&quot; () by Runar Schildt in 1919. These were followed by Jarl Hemmer in 1931 with the book &quot;A Man and His Conscience&quot; () and Oiva Paloheimo in 1942 with &quot;Restless Childhood&quot; (). Lauri Viita&#x27;s book &quot;Scrambled Ground&quot; () from 1950 presented the life and experiences of a worker family in the Tampere of 1918, including a point of view from outsiders to the Civil War.

Between 1959 and 1962, V√§in√∂ Linna described in his trilogy &quot;Under the North Star&quot; () the Civil War and World War II from the viewpoint of the common people. Part II of Linna&#x27;s work opened a larger view of these events and included tales of the Reds in the 1918 war. At the same time, a new outlook on the war was opened by Paavo Haavikko&#x27;s book &quot;Private Matters&quot; (), Veijo Meri&#x27;s &quot;The Events of 1918&quot; () and Paavo Rintala&#x27;s &quot;My Grandmother and Mannerheim&quot; (), all published in 1960. In poetry, Viljo Kajava, who had experienced the Battle of Tampere at the age of nine, presented a pacifist view of the Civil War in his &quot;Poems of Tampere&quot; () in 1966. The same battle is described in the novel &quot;Corpse Bearer&quot; () by Antti Tuuri from 2007. The multilayered &quot;Malmi 1917&quot; (2013) by describes contradictory emotions and attitudes in a village drifting towards civil war.

V√§in√∂ Linna&#x27;s trilogy turned the general tide, and after it, several books were written mainly from the Red viewpoint: The Tampere-trilogy by in 1977; &quot;Juho 18&quot; by in 1998; &quot;The Command&quot; () by Leena Lander in 2003; and &quot;Sandra&quot; by in 2017. Kjell West√∂&#x27;s epic novel &quot;Where We Once Went&quot; (), published in 2006, deals with the period of 1915‚Äì1930 from both the Red and the White sides. West√∂&#x27;s book &quot;Mirage 38&quot; () from 2013, describes post-war traumas of the 1918 war and Finnish mentality in the 1930s. Many of the stories have been utilised in motion pictures and in theatre.

===Cinema and television===
The Civil War and the literature about it has inspired many Finnish filmmakers to take it the subject for the film and television adaptations. As early as 1957, &quot;1918&quot;, a film directed by Toivo S√§rkk√§ and based on Jarl Hemmer&#x27;s play and novel &quot;A Man and His Conscience&quot;, was screened at the 7th Berlin International Film Festival. The most recent films about the civil war include the 2007 film &quot;The Border&quot;, directed by Lauri T√∂rh√∂nen, and the 2008 film &quot;Tears of April&quot;, directed by Aku Louhimies and based on Leena Lander&#x27;s novel &quot;The Command&quot;. However, perhaps the most famous film about the Finnish Civil War is the 1968 film &quot;Here, Beneath the North Star&quot;, directed by Edvin Laine and based on the first two books of V√§in√∂ Linna&#x27;s &quot;Under the North Star&quot; trilogy.

In 2012, the dramatized documentary &#x27; (or &quot;The Battle of N√§silinna 1918&quot;; ) was made, which tells the story of the Battle of Tampere during the Civil War. Other noteworthy documentary-styled films about the Finnish Civil War include &#x27; from 1973, &quot;Trust&quot; from 1976, and &quot;Flame Top&quot; from 1980.

===Games===
In 2020, GMT Games released a strategy-based board game entitled &quot;All Bridges Burning: Red Revolt and White Guard in Finland, 1917-18&quot; in the tenth volume of their COIN series, which emulated the conflict of the civil war.

<doc id="11773" wikidata="Q508736" url="?curid=11773" title="Flynn effect">
<text>The Flynn effect is the substantial and long-sustained increase in both fluid and crystallized intelligence test scores that were measured in many parts of the world over the 20th century, named after researcher James Flynn (1934‚Äì2020). When intelligence quotient (IQ) tests are initially standardized using a sample of test-takers, by convention the average of the test results is set to 100 and their standard deviation is set to 15 or 16 IQ points. When IQ tests are revised, they are again standardized using a new sample of test-takers, usually born more recently than the first; the average result is set to 100. When the new test subjects take the older tests, in almost every case their average scores are significantly above 100.

Test score increases have been continuous and approximately linear from the earliest years of testing to the present. For example, a study published in the year 2009 found that British children&#x27;s average scores on the Raven&#x27;s Progressive Matrices test rose by 14 IQ points from 1942 to 2008. Similar gains have been observed in many other countries in which IQ testing has long been widely used, including other Western European countries, as well as Japan and South Korea. Improvements have also been reported for semantic and episodic memory. 

There are numerous proposed explanations of the Flynn effect, such as the rise in efficiency of education, along with skepticism concerning its implications. Some researchers have suggested the possibility of a mild reversal in the Flynn effect (i.e., a decline in IQ scores) in developed countries, beginning in the 1990s, sometimes referred to as reverse Flynn effect. In certain cases, this apparent reversal may be due to cultural changes rendering parts of intelligence tests obsolete. However, meta-analyses indicate that, overall, the Flynn effect continues, either at the same rate, or at a slower rate in developed countries.

==Origin of term==

The Flynn effect is named for James Robert Flynn, who did much to document it and promote awareness of its implications. The term was coined by Richard Herrnstein and Charles Murray in their 1994 book &quot;The Bell Curve&quot;. Flynn stated that, if asked, he would have named the effect after Read D. Tuddenham who &quot;was the first to present convincing evidence of massive gains on mental tests using a nationwide sample&quot; in a 1948 article.

Although the general term for the phenomenon‚Äîreferring to no researcher in particular‚Äîcontinues to be &quot;secular rise in IQ scores&quot;, many textbooks on psychology and IQ testing have now followed the lead of Herrnstein and Murray in calling the phenomenon the Flynn effect.

==Rise in IQ==
IQ tests are updated periodically. For example, the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC), originally developed in 1949, was updated in 1974, 1991, 2003, and again in 2014. The revised versions are standardized based on the performance of test-takers in standardization samples. A standard score of IQ 100 is defined as the mean performance of the standardization sample. Thus one way to see changes in norms over time is to conduct a study in which the same test-takers take both an old and new version of the same test. Doing so confirms IQ gains over time. Some IQ tests‚Äîfor example, tests used for military draftees in NATO countries in Europe‚Äîreport raw scores, and those also confirm a trend of rising scores over time. The average rate of increase seems to be about three IQ points per decade in the United States, as scaled by the Wechsler tests. The increasing test performance over time appears on every major test, in every age range, at every ability level, and in every modern industrialized country, although not necessarily at the same rate as in the United States. The increase was continuous and roughly linear from the earliest days of testing to the mid-1990s. Though the effect is most associated with IQ increases, a similar effect has been found with increases in attention and of semantic and episodic memory.

Ulric Neisser estimated that using the IQ values of 1997, the average IQ of the United States in 1932, according to the first Stanford‚ÄìBinet Intelligence Scales standardization sample, was 80. Neisser states that &quot;Hardly any of them would have scored &#x27;very superior&#x27;, but nearly one-quarter would have appeared to be &#x27;deficient.&#x27;&quot; He also wrote that &quot;Test scores are certainly going up all over the world, but whether intelligence itself has risen remains controversial.&quot; Quantitative psychologist, Joseph Lee Rodgers argues that the effect occurs outside of families in any case.

Trahan et al. (2014) found that the effect was about 2.93 points per decade, based on both Stanford‚ÄìBinet and Wechsler tests; they also found no evidence the effect was diminishing. In contrast, Pietschnig and Voracek (2015) reported, in their meta-analysis of studies involving nearly 4 million participants, that the Flynn effect had decreased in recent decades. They also reported that the magnitude of the effect was different for different types of intelligence (&quot;0.41, 0.30, 0.28, and 0.21 IQ points annually for fluid, spatial, full-scale, and crystallized IQ test performance, respectively&quot;), and that the effect was stronger for adults than for children.

Raven (2000) found that, as Flynn suggested, data interpreted as showing a decrease in many abilities with increasing age must be re-interpreted as showing that there has been a dramatic increase of these abilities with the date of birth. On many tests this occurs at all levels of ability.

Some studies have found the gains of the Flynn effect to be particularly concentrated at the lower end of the distribution. Teasdale and Owen (1989), for example, found the effect primarily reduced the number of low-end scores, resulting in an increased number of moderately high scores, with no increase in very high scores. In another study, two large samples of Spanish children were assessed with a 30-year gap. Comparison of the IQ distributions indicated that the mean IQ scores on the test had increased by 9.7 points (the Flynn effect), the gains were concentrated in the lower half of the distribution and negligible in the top half, and the gains gradually decreased as the IQ of the individuals increased. Some studies have found a reverse Flynn effect with declining scores for those with high IQ.

In 1987, Flynn took the position that the very large increase indicates that IQ tests do not measure intelligence but only a minor sort of &quot;abstract problem-solving ability&quot; with little practical significance. He argued that if IQ gains did reflect intelligence increases, there would have been consequent changes of our society that have not been observed (a presumed non-occurrence of a &quot;cultural renaissance&quot;). By 2012 Flynn no longer endorsed this view of intelligence, having elaborated and refined his view of what rising IQ scores meant.

===Precursors to Flynn&#x27;s publications===
Earlier investigators had discovered rises in raw IQ test scores in some study populations, but had not published general investigations of that issue in particular. Historian Daniel C. Calhoun cited earlier psychology literature on IQ score trends in his book &quot;The Intelligence of a People&quot; (1973). Robert L. Thorndike ‚Äì not to be confused with his famous father &quot;Edward&quot; ‚Äì drew attention to rises in Stanford-Binet scores in a 1975 review of the history of intelligence testing. In 1982, Richard Lynn recorded an increase in average IQ among the population of Japan.

===Intelligence===

There is debate about whether the rise in IQ scores also corresponds to a rise in general intelligence, or only a rise in special skills related to taking IQ tests. Because children attend school longer now and have become much more familiar with the testing of school-related material, one might expect the greatest gains to occur on such school content-related tests as vocabulary, arithmetic or general information. Just the opposite is the case: abilities such as these have experienced relatively small gains and even occasional decreases over the years. Meta-analytic findings indicate that Flynn effects occur for tests assessing both fluid and crystallized abilities. For example, Dutch conscripts gained 21 points during only 30 years, or 7 points per decade, between 1952 and 1982. This rise in IQ test scores is not wholly explained by an increase in general intelligence. Studies have shown that while test scores have improved over time, the improvement is not fully correlated with latent factors related to intelligence. Other researchers argue that the IQ gains described by the Flynn effect are due in part to increasing intelligence, and in part to increases in test-specific skills. One study suggested that the IQ gains reflected changes in modes of thinking that better reflected cognitive skills assessed by IQ tests rather than raw intelligence itself.

==Proposed explanations==
===Schooling and test familiarity===
The duration of average schooling has increased steadily. However, a criticism of this explanation is that if (in the United States) older and younger subjects, with similar educational levels, are compared together, then the IQ gains appear almost undiminished in each group compared to when they are considered individually.

Many studies find that children who do not attend school score drastically lower on the tests than their regularly attending peers. During the 1960s, when some Virginia counties closed their public schools to avoid racial integration, compensatory private schooling was available only for White children. On average, the scores of African-American children who received no formal education during that period decreased at a rate of about six IQ points per year.

Another explanation is an increased familiarity of the general population with tests and testing. For example, children who take the very same IQ test a second time usually gain five or six points. However, this seems to set an upper limit on the effects of test sophistication. One problem with this explanation and others related to schooling is that in the US, the groups with greater test familiarity show smaller IQ increases.

Early intervention programs have shown mixed results. Some preschool (ages 3‚Äì4) intervention programs like &quot;Head Start&quot; do not produce lasting changes of IQ, although they may confer other benefits. The &quot;Abecedarian Early Intervention Project&quot;, an all-day program that provided various forms of environmental enrichment to children from infancy onward, showed IQ gains that did not diminish over time. The IQ gains in the experimental group compared to the control group was 4.4 points. These gains persisted until at least age 21.

Citing a high correlation between rising literacy rates and gains in IQ, David Marks has argued that the Flynn effect is caused by changes in literacy rates.

===Nutrition===

Improved nutrition is another possible explanation. Today&#x27;s average adult from an industrialized nation is taller than a comparable adult of a century ago. That increase of stature, likely the result of general improvements in nutrition and health, has been at a rate of more than a centimeter per decade. Available data suggest that these gains have been accompanied by analogous increases in head size, and by an increase in the average size of the brain. This argument had been thought to suffer the difficulty that groups who tend to be of smaller overall body size (e.g. women, or people of Asian ancestry) do not have lower average IQs.

A 2005 study presented data supporting the nutrition hypothesis, which predicts that gains will occur predominantly at the low end of the IQ distribution, where nutritional deprivation is probably most severe. An alternative interpretation of skewed IQ gains could be that improved education has been particularly important for this group.

A century ago, nutritional deficiencies may have limited body and organ functionality, including skull volume. The first two years of life are a critical time for nutrition. The consequences of malnutrition can be irreversible and may include poor cognitive development, educability, and future economic productivity. On the other hand, Flynn has pointed to 20-point gains on Dutch military (Raven&#x27;s type) IQ tests between 1952, 1962, 1972, and 1982. In 1962 he observed that Dutch 18-year-olds had a major nutritional handicap. They were either in the womb or were recently born, during the great Dutch famine of 1944‚Äîwhen German troops monopolized food and 18,000 people died of starvation. Yet, concludes Flynn, &quot;they do not show up even as a blip in the pattern of Dutch IQ gains. It is as if the famine had never occurred.&quot; It appears that the effects of diet are gradual, taking effect over decades (affecting mother as well as the child) rather than a few months.

In support of the nutritional hypothesis, it is known that, in the United States, the average height before 1900 was about 10¬†cm (~4¬†inches) shorter than it is today. Possibly related to the Flynn effect is a similar change of skull size and shape during the last 150 years. A Norwegian study found that height gains were strongly correlated with intelligence gains until the cessation of height gains in military conscript cohorts towards the end of the 1980s.&lt;ref name=&quot;doi10.1016/j.intell.2004.06.004&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Both height and skull size increases probably result from a combination of phenotypic plasticity and genetic selection over this period. With only five or six human generations in 150 years, time for natural selection has been very limited, suggesting that increased skeletal size resulting from changes in population phenotypes is more likely than recent genetic evolution.

It is well known that micronutrient deficiencies change the development of intelligence. For instance, one study has found that iodine deficiency causes a fall, on average, of 12 IQ points in China.

Scientists James Feyrer, Dimitra Politi, and David N. Weil have found in the U.S. that the proliferation of iodized salt increased IQ by 15 points in some areas. Journalist Max Nisen has stated that with this type of salt becoming popular, that &quot;the aggregate effect has been extremely positive.&quot;

Daley et al. (2003) found a significant Flynn effect among children in rural Kenya, and concluded that nutrition was one of the hypothesized explanations that best explained their results (the others were parental literacy and family structure).

===Generally more stimulating environment===
Still another theory is that the general environment today is much more complex and stimulating. One of the most striking 20th-century changes in the human intellectual environment has come from the increase of exposure to many types of visual media. From pictures on the wall to movies to television to video games to computers, each successive generation has been exposed to richer optical displays than the one before and may have become more adept at visual analysis. This would explain why visual tests like the Raven&#x27;s have shown the greatest increases. An increase only of particular forms of intelligence would explain why the Flynn effect has not caused a &quot;cultural renaissance too great to be overlooked.&quot;

In 2001, William Dickens and James Flynn presented a model for resolving several contradictory findings regarding IQ. They argue that the measure &quot;heritability&quot; includes both a direct effect of the genotype on IQ and also indirect effects such that the genotype changes the environment, thereby affecting IQ. That is, those with a greater IQ tend to seek stimulating environments that further increase IQ. These reciprocal effects result in gene environment correlation. The direct effect could initially have been very small, but feedback can create large differences in IQ. In their model, an environmental stimulus can have a very great effect on IQ, even for adults, but this effect also decays over time unless the stimulus continues (the model could be adapted to include possible factors, like nutrition during early childhood, that may cause permanent effects). The Flynn effect can be explained by a generally more stimulating environment for all people. The authors suggest that any program designed to increase IQ may produce long-term IQ gains if that program teaches children how to replicate the types of cognitively demanding experiences that produce IQ gains outside the program. To maximize lifetime IQ, the programs should also motivate them to continue searching for cognitively demanding experiences after they have left the program.

Flynn, in his 2007 book &quot;What Is Intelligence?&quot;, further expanded on this theory. Environmental changes resulting from modernization‚Äîsuch as more intellectually demanding work, greater use of technology, and smaller families‚Äîhave meant that a much larger proportion of people are more accustomed to manipulating abstract concepts such as hypotheses and categories than a century ago. Substantial portions of IQ tests deal with these abilities. Flynn gives, as an example, the question &#x27;What do a dog and a rabbit have in common?&#x27; A modern respondent might say they are both mammals (an abstract, or &quot;a priori&quot; answer, which depends only on the meanings of the words &quot;dog&quot; and &quot;rabbit&quot;), whereas someone a century ago might have said that humans catch rabbits with dogs (a concrete, or &quot;a posteriori&quot; answer, which depended on what happened to be the case at that time).

===Infectious diseases===

Eppig, Fincher, and Thornhill (2011) conducted a study looking at different US states found that states with a higher prevalence of infectious diseases had lower average IQ. The effect remained after controlling for the effects of wealth and educational variation.

Atheendar Venkataramani (2010) studied the effect of malaria on IQ in a sample of Mexicans. Malaria eradication during the birth year was associated with increases in IQ. It also increased the probability of employment in a skilled occupation. The author suggests that this may be one explanation for the Flynn effect and that this may be an important explanation for the link between national malaria burden and economic development. A literature review of 44 papers states that cognitive abilities and school performance were shown to be impaired in sub-groups of patients (with either cerebral malaria or uncomplicated malaria) when compared with healthy controls. Studies comparing cognitive functions before and after treatment for acute malarial illness continued to show significantly impaired school performance and cognitive abilities even after recovery. Malaria prophylaxis was shown to improve cognitive function and school performance in clinical trials when compared to placebo groups.

===Heterosis===

Heterosis, or &quot;hybrid vigor&quot;, associated with historical reductions of the levels of inbreeding, has been proposed by Michael Mingroni as an alternative explanation of the Flynn effect. However, James Flynn has pointed out that even if everyone mated with a sibling in 1900, subsequent increases in heterosis would not be a sufficient explanation of the observed IQ gains.

===Reduction of lead in gasoline===
One study found the drop in blood lead levels in the United States from the 1970s to 2007 correlated with a 4‚Äì5 point increase in IQ.

==Possible end of progression==

Jon Martin Sundet and colleagues (2004) examined scores on intelligence tests given to Norwegian conscripts between the 1950s and 2002. They found that the increase of scores of general intelligence stopped after the mid-1990s and declined in numerical reasoning sub-tests.

Teasdale and Owen (2005) examined the results of IQ tests given to Danish male conscripts. Between 1959 and 1979 the gains were 3 points per decade. Between 1979 and 1989 the increase approached 2 IQ points. Between 1989 and 1998 the gain was about 1.3 points. Between 1998 and 2004 IQ declined by about the same amount as it gained between 1989 and 1998. They speculate that &quot;a contributing factor in this recent fall could be a simultaneous decline in proportions of students entering 3-year advanced-level school programs for 16‚Äì18-year-olds.&quot; The same authors in a more comprehensive 2008 study, again on Danish male conscripts, found that there was a 1.5-point increase between 1988 and 1998, but a 1.5-point decrease between 1998 and 2003/2004.

In Australia, the IQ of 6‚Äì12-year-olds (as measured by colored progressive matrices) has shown no increase from 1975 to 2003.

In the United Kingdom, a study by Flynn (2009) himself found that tests carried out in 1980 and again in 2008 show that the IQ score of an average 14-year-old dropped by more than two points over the period. For the upper half of the results, the performance was even worse. Average IQ scores declined by six points. However, children aged between five and 10 saw their IQs increase by up to half a point a year over the three decades. Flynn argues that the abnormal drop in British teenage IQ could be due to youth culture having &quot;stagnated&quot; or even dumbed down.

Bratsberg &amp; Rogeberg (2018) present evidence that the Flynn effect in Norway has reversed between the years 1962‚Äì1991, and that both the original rise in mean IQ scores and their subsequent decline within this period can be observed within families consisting of native-born parents and their children, indicating that environmental factors were the likely cause for these changes. Because IQ data was only available for male Norwegians, who were subject to military conscription, years of schooling were used as an approximation for female IQ to support this conclusion.

One possible explanation of a worldwide decline in intelligence is an increase in air pollution; coal burning emits mercury, and intelligence has continued to climb in areas, like the southern United States, where coal burning has declined.

Winter et al. (2024) when comparing two WAIS-5 validity studies found a reduced Flynn effect of an increase of 1.2 IQ points per decade rather than the expected 3 IQ point increase per decade. The authors identified various novel factors including social media dependency and the COVID-19 pandemic which may have contributed to a reduced Flynn effect.

==IQ group differences==
If the Flynn effect has ended in developed nations but continues in less developed ones, this would tend to diminish national differences in IQ scores.

Also, if the Flynn effect has ended for the majority in developed nations, it may still continue for minorities, especially for groups like immigrants where many may have received poor nutrition during early childhood or have had other disadvantages. A study in the Netherlands found that children of non-Western immigrants had improvements for g, educational achievements, and work proficiency compared to their parents, although there were still remaining differences compared to ethnic Dutch.

In the United States, the IQ gap between black and white people was gradually closing over the last decades of the 20th century, as black test-takers increased their average scores relative to white test-takers. For instance, Vincent reported in 1991 that the black‚Äìwhite IQ gap was decreasing among children, but that it was remaining constant among adults. Similarly, a 2006 study by Dickens and Flynn estimated that the difference between mean scores of black people and white people closed by about 5 or 6 IQ points between 1972 and 2002, a reduction of about one-third. In the same period, the educational achievement disparity also diminished. Reviews by Flynn and Dickens, Nicholas Mackintosh, and Nisbett et al. all concluded that the gradual closing of the gap was a real phenomenon.

Flynn has commented that he never claimed that the Flynn effect has the same causes as observed differences in average IQ test performance between blacks and whites, but that it shows that environmental factors can create IQ differences of a magnitude similar to that gap. Wicherts &quot;et al&quot;. had previously suggested a similar interpretation in a 2004 paper. Flynn also argued that his findings undermine the so-called Spearman&#x27;s hypothesis, which hypothesized that differences in g factor are the major driver of the blacks-whites IQ gap.

<text>The field-ion microscope (FIM) was invented by M√ºller in 1951. It is a type of microscope that can be used to image the arrangement of atoms at the surface of a sharp metal tip.

On October 11, 1955, Erwin M√ºller and his Ph.D. student, Kanwar Bahadur (Pennsylvania State University) observed individual tungsten atoms on the surface of a sharply pointed tungsten tip by cooling it to 21 K and employing helium as the imaging gas. M√ºller &amp; Bahadur were the first persons to observe individual atoms directly.

==Introduction==

In FIM, a sharp (&lt;50¬†nm tip radius) metal tip is produced and placed in an ultra high vacuum chamber, which is backfilled with an imaging gas such as helium or neon. The tip is cooled to cryogenic temperatures (20‚Äì100 K). A positive voltage of 5 to 10 kilovolts is applied to the tip. Gas atoms adsorbed on the tip are ionized by the strong electric field in the vicinity of the tip (thus, &quot;field ionization&quot;), becoming positively charged and being repelled from the tip. The curvature of the surface near the tip causes a natural magnification ‚Äî ions are repelled in a direction roughly perpendicular to the surface (a &quot;point projection&quot; effect). A detector is placed so as to collect these repelled ions; the image formed from all the collected ions can be of sufficient resolution to image individual atoms on the tip surface.

Unlike conventional microscopes, where the spatial resolution is limited by the wavelength of the particles which are used for imaging, the FIM is a projection type microscope with atomic resolution and an approximate magnification of a few million times.

==Design, limitations and applications==

FIM like field-emission microscopy (FEM) consists of a sharp sample tip and a fluorescent screen (now replaced by a multichannel plate) as the key elements. However, there are some essential differences as follows:
#The tip potential is positive.
#The chamber is filled with an imaging gas (typically, He or Ne at 10‚àí5 to 10‚àí3 Torr).
#The tip is cooled to low temperatures (~20-80K).
Like FEM, the field strength at the tip apex is typically a few V/√Ö. The experimental set-up and image formation in FIM is illustrated in the accompanying figures.

In FIM the presence of a strong field is critical. The imaging gas atoms (He, Ne) near the tip are polarized by the field and since the field is non-uniform the polarized atoms are attracted towards the tip surface. The imaging atoms then lose their kinetic energy performing a series of hops and accommodate to the tip temperature. Eventually, the imaging atoms are ionized by tunneling electrons into the surface and the resulting positive ions are accelerated along the field lines to the screen to form a highly magnified image of the sample tip.

In FIM, the ionization takes place close to the tip, where the field is strongest. The electron that tunnels from the atom is picked up by the tip. There is a critical distance, xc, at which the tunneling probability is a maximum. This distance is typically about 0.4¬†nm. The very high spatial resolution and high contrast for features on the atomic scale arises from the fact that the electric field is enhanced in the vicinity of the surface atoms because of the higher local curvature. The resolution of FIM is limited by the thermal velocity of the imaging ion. Resolution of the order of 1√Ö (atomic resolution) can be achieved by effective cooling of the tip.

Application of FIM, like FEM, is limited by the materials which can be fabricated in the shape of a sharp tip, can be used in an ultra high vacuum (UHV) environment, and can tolerate the high electrostatic fields. For these reasons, refractory metals with high melting temperature (e.g. W, Mo, Pt, Ir) are conventional objects for FIM experiments. Metal tips for FEM and FIM are prepared by electropolishing (electrochemical polishing) of thin wires. However, these tips usually contain many asperities. The final preparation procedure involves the in situ removal of these asperities by field evaporation just by raising the tip voltage. Field evaporation is a field induced process which involves the removal of atoms from the surface itself at very high field strengths and typically occurs in the range 2-5 V/√Ö. The effect of the field in this case is to reduce the effective binding energy of the atom to the surface and to give, in effect, a greatly increased evaporation rate relative to that expected at that temperature at zero fields. This process is self-regulating since the atoms that are at positions of high local curvature, such as adatoms or ledge atoms, are removed preferentially. The tips used in FIM is sharper (tip radius is 100~300 √Ö) compared to those used in FEM experiments (tip radius ~1000 √Ö).

FIM has been used to study dynamical behavior of surfaces and the behavior of adatoms on surfaces. The problems studied include adsorption-desorption phenomena, surface diffusion of adatoms and clusters, adatom-adatom interactions, step motion, equilibrium crystal shape, etc. However, there is the possibility of the results being affected by the limited surface area (i.e. edge effects) and by the presence of large electric field.

In a recent study from G√ºnther Rupprechter laboratory examined a rhodium nanocrystal surface using field emission microscopy consisting of different nanometer-sized nanofacets as a model of a compartmentalized reaction nanosystem. Different reaction modes were observed, including a transition to spatio-temporal chaos. The transitions between different modes were caused by variations of the hydrogen pressure modifying the strength of diffusive coupling between individual nanofacets.

<text>The First Battle of El Alamein (1‚Äì27 July 1942) was a battle of the Western Desert campaign of World War II, fought in Egypt between Axis (German and Italian) forces of the Panzer Army Africa‚Äîwhich included the under Field Marshal Erwin Rommel‚Äîand Allied (British Empire and Commonwealth) forces of the Eighth Army under General Claude Auchinleck.

In this battle the British halted a second advance by the Axis forces into Egypt. Axis positions near El Alamein, only from Alexandria, were dangerously close to the ports and cities of Egypt, the base facilities of the Commonwealth forces and the Suez Canal. However, the Axis forces were too far from their base at Tripoli in Libya to remain at El Alamein indefinitely, which led both sides to accumulate supplies for more offensives, against the constraints of time and distance.

==Background==
===Retreat from Gazala===
After their defeat at the Battle of Gazala in Eastern Libya in June 1942, the British Eighth Army, commanded by Lieutenant-General Neil Ritchie, had retreated east from the Gazala line into north-western Egypt as far as Mersa Matruh, roughly inside the border. Ritchie had decided not to hold the defences on the Egyptian border, because the defensive plan there was for infantry to hold defended localities and a strong armoured force behind them to meet any attempts to penetrate or outflank the fixed defences. Since General Ritchie had virtually no armoured units left fit to fight, the infantry positions would be defeated in detail. The Mersa defence plan also included an armoured reserve but in its absence Ritchie believed he could organise his infantry to cover the minefields between the defended localities to prevent Axis engineers from having undisturbed access.

To defend the Matruh line, Ritchie placed 10th Indian Infantry Division (in Matruh itself) and 50th (Northumbrian) Infantry Division (some down the coast at Gerawla) under X Corps HQ, newly arrived from Syria. Inland from X Corps would be XIII Corps with 5th Indian Infantry Division (with only one infantry brigade, 29th Indian, and two artillery regiments) around Sidi Hamza about inland, and the newly arrived 2nd New Zealand Division (short one brigade, the 6th, which had been left out of combat in case the division was captured and it would be needed to serve as the nucleus of a new division) at Minqar Qaim (on the escarpment inland) and 1st Armoured Division in the open desert to the south. The 1st Armoured Division had taken over 4th and 22nd Armoured Brigades from 7th Armoured Division which by this time had only three tank regiments (battalions) between them.
On 25 June, General Claude Auchinleck‚ÄîCommander-in-Chief (C-in-C) Middle East Command‚Äîrelieved Ritchie and assumed direct command of the Eighth Army himself. He decided not to seek a decisive confrontation at the Mersa Matruh position. He concluded that his inferiority in armour after the Gazala defeat, meant he would be unable to prevent Rommel either breaking through his centre or enveloping his open left flank to the south in the same way he had at Gazala. He decided instead to employ delaying tactics while withdrawing a further or more east to a more defensible position near El Alamein on the Mediterranean coast. Only to the south of El Alamein, the steep slopes of the Qattara Depression ruled out the possibility of Axis armour moving around the southern flank of his defences and limited the width of the front he had to defend.

===Battle of Mersa Matruh===

While preparing the Alamein positions, Auchinleck fought strong delaying actions, first at Mersa Matruh on 26‚Äì27 June and then Fuka on 28 June. The late change of orders resulted in some confusion in the forward formations (X Corps and XIII Corps) between the desire to inflict damage on the enemy and the intention not to get trapped in the Matruh position but retreat in good order. The result was poor co-ordination between the two forward Corps and units within them. Late on 26 June, the German 90th Light and 21st Panzer Divisions managed to find their way through the minefields in the centre of the front. Early on 27 June, resuming its advance, the 90th Light was checked by British 50th Division&#x27;s artillery. Meanwhile, the 15th and 21st Panzer Divisions advanced east above and below the escarpment. The 15th Panzer Division were blocked by 4th Armoured and 7th Motor Brigades, but the 21st Panzer Division were ordered on to attack Minqar Qaim. Rommel ordered 90th Light to resume its advance, requiring it to cut the coast road behind 50th Division by the evening. As the 21st Panzer Division moved on Minqar Qaim, the 2nd New Zealand Division found itself surrounded but broke out on the night of 27/28 June without serious losses and withdrew east.
Auchinleck had planned a second delaying position at Fuka, some east of Matruh, and at 21:20 he issued the orders for a withdrawal to Fuka. Confusion in communication led the division withdrawing immediately to the El Alamein position. X Corps, having made an unsuccessful attempt to secure a position on the escarpment, were out of touch with Eighth Army from 19:30 until 04:30 the next morning. Only then did they discover that the withdrawal order had been given. The withdrawal of XIII Corps had left the southern flank of X Corps on the coast at Matruh exposed and their line of retreat compromised by the cutting of the coastal road east of Matruh. They were ordered to break out southwards into the desert and then make their way east. Auchinleck ordered XIII Corps to provide support but they were in no position to do so. At 21:00 on 28 June, X Corps‚Äîorganised into brigade groups‚Äîheaded south. In the darkness, there was considerable confusion as they came across enemy units laagered for the night. In the process, 5th Indian Division in particular sustained heavy casualties, including the destruction of the 29th Indian Infantry Brigade at Fuka. Axis forces captured more than 6,000 prisoners, in addition to 40 tanks and an enormous quantity of supplies.

==Prelude==

===Defences at El Alamein===

Alamein itself was an inconsequential railway station on the coast. Some to the south lay the Ruweisat Ridge, a low stony prominence that gave excellent observation for many miles over the surrounding desert; to the south was the Qattara Depression. The line the British chose to defend stretched between the sea and the Depression, which meant that Rommel could outflank it only by taking a significant detour to the south and crossing the Sahara Desert. The British Army in Egypt recognised this before the war and had the Eighth Army begin construction of several &quot;boxes&quot; (localities with dug-outs and surrounded by minefields and barbed wire) the most developed being around the railway station at Alamein. Most of the &quot;line&quot; was open, empty desert. Lieutenant-General William Norrie (General officer commanding [GOC] XXX Corps) organised the position and started to construct three defended &quot;boxes&quot;. The first and strongest, at El Alamein on the coast, had been partly wired and mined by 1st South African Division. The Bab el Qattara box‚Äîsome from the coast and south-west of the Ruweisat Ridge‚Äîhad been dug but had not been wired or mined, while at the Naq Abu Dweis box (on the edge of the Qattara Depression), from the coast, very little work had been done.

The British position in Egypt was desperate, the rout from Mersa Matruh had created a panic in the British headquarters at Cairo, something later called &quot;the Flap&quot;. On what came to be referred to as &quot;Ash Wednesday&quot;, at British headquarters, rear echelon units and the British Embassy, papers were hurriedly burned in anticipation of the fall of the city. Auchinleck‚Äîalthough believing he could stop Rommel at Alamein‚Äîfelt he could not ignore the possibility that he might once more be outmanoeuvred or outfought. To maintain his army, plans must be made for the possibility of a further retreat whilst maintaining morale and retaining the support and co-operation of the Egyptians. Defensive positions were constructed west of Alexandria and on the approaches to Cairo while considerable areas in the Nile delta were flooded. The Axis, too, believed that the capture of Egypt was imminent; Italian leader Benito Mussolini‚Äîsensing a historic moment‚Äîflew to Libya to prepare for his triumphal entry into Cairo.
The scattering of X Corps at Mersa Matruh disrupted Auchinleck&#x27;s plan for occupying the Alamein defences. On 29 June, he ordered XXX Corps‚Äîthe 1st South African, 5th and 10th Indian divisions‚Äîto take the coastal sector on the right of the front and XIII Corps‚Äîthe 2nd New Zealand Division and 4th Indian divisions‚Äîto be on the left. The remains of the 1st Armoured Division and the 7th Armoured Division were to be held as a mobile army reserve. His intention was for the fixed defensive positions to channel and disorganise the enemy&#x27;s advance while mobile units would attack their flanks and rear.

On 30 June, Rommel&#x27;s &quot;Panzerarmee Afrika&quot; approached the Alamein position. The Axis forces were exhausted and understrength. Rommel had driven them forward ruthlessly, being confident that, provided he struck quickly before Eighth Army had time to settle, his momentum would take him through the Alamein position and he could then advance to the Nile with little further opposition. Supplies remained a problem because the Axis staff had originally expected a pause of six weeks after the capture of Tobruk. German air units were also exhausted and providing little help against the RAF&#x27;s all-out attack on the Axis supply lines which, with the arrival of United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) heavy bombers, could reach as far as Benghazi. Although captured supplies proved useful, water and ammunition were constantly in short supply, while a shortage of transport impeded the distribution of the supplies that the Axis forces did have.

===Axis plan of attack===

Rommel&#x27;s plan was for the 90th Light Division and the 15th and 21st &quot;Panzer&quot; divisions of the &quot;Afrika Korps&quot; to penetrate the Eighth Army lines between the Alamein box and Deir el Abyad (which he believed was defended). The 90th Light Division was then to veer north to cut the coastal road and trap the defenders of the Alamein box (which Rommel thought was occupied by the remains of the 50th Infantry Division) and the &quot;Afrika Korps&quot; would veer right to attack the rear of XIII Corps.

==Battle==
An Italian division was to attack the Alamein box from the west and another was to follow the 90th Light Division. The Italian XX Corps was to follow the &quot;Afrika Korps&quot; and deal with the Qattara box while the 133rd Armoured Division &quot;Littorio&quot; and German reconnaissance units would protect the right flank. Rommel had planned to attack on 30 June but supply and transport difficulties had resulted in a day&#x27;s delay, vital to the defending forces reorganising on the Alamein line. On 30 June, the 90th Light Division was still short of its start line, 21st &quot;Panzer&quot; Division was immobilised through lack of fuel and the promised air support had yet to move into its advanced airfields.

===Panzer Army Africa attacks===
At 03:00 on 1 July, 90th Light Infantry Division advanced east but strayed too far north and ran into the 1st South African Division&#x27;s defences and became pinned down. The 15th and 21st &quot;Panzer&quot; Divisions of the &quot;Afrika Korps&quot; were delayed by a sandstorm and then a heavy air attack. It was broad daylight by the time they circled round the back of Deir el Abyad where they found the feature to the east of it occupied by 18th Indian Infantry Brigade which, after a hasty journey from Iraq, had occupied the exposed position just west of Ruweisat Ridge and east of Deir el Abyad at Deir el Shein late on 28 June to create one of Norrie&#x27;s additional defensive boxes.

At about 10:00 on 1 July, 21st &quot;Panzer&quot; Division attacked Deir el Shein. 18th Indian Infantry Brigade‚Äîsupported by 23 25-pounder gun-howitzers, 16 of the new 6-pounder anti-tank guns and nine Matilda tanks‚Äîheld out the whole day in desperate fighting but by evening the Germans succeeded in over-running them. The time they bought allowed Auchinleck to organise the defence of the western end of Ruweisat Ridge. The 1st Armoured Division had been sent to intervene at Deir el Shein. They ran into 15th &quot;Panzer&quot; Division just south of Deir el Shein and drove it west. By the end of the day&#x27;s fighting, the &quot;Afrika Korps&quot; had 37 tanks left out of its initial complement of 55.

During the early afternoon, 90th Light had extricated itself from the El Alamein box defences and resumed its move eastward. It came under artillery fire from the three South African brigade groups and was forced to dig in.

On 2 July, Rommel ordered the resumption of the offensive. Once again, 90th Light failed to make progress so Rommel called the &quot;Afrika Korps&quot; to abandon its planned sweep southward and instead join the effort to break through to the coast road by attacking east toward Ruweisat Ridge. The British defence of Ruweisat Ridge relied on an improvised formation called &quot;Robcol&quot;, comprising a regiment each of field artillery and light anti-aircraft artillery and a company of infantry. Robcol‚Äîin line with normal British Army practice for &quot;ad hoc&quot; formations‚Äîwas named after its commander, Brigadier Robert Waller, the Commander Royal Artillery of the 10th Indian Infantry Division. Robcol was able to buy time, and by late afternoon the two British armoured brigades joined the battle with 4th Armoured Brigade engaging 15th &quot;Panzer&quot; and 22nd Armoured Brigade 21st &quot;Panzer&quot; respectively. They drove back repeated attacks by the Axis armour, who then withdrew before dusk. The British reinforced Ruweisat on the night of 2 July. The now enlarged Robcol became &quot;Walgroup&quot;. Meanwhile, the Royal Air Force (RAF) made heavy air attacks on the Axis units.

The next day, 3 July, Rommel ordered the &quot;Afrika Korps&quot; to resume its attack on the Ruweisat ridge with the Italian XX Motorised Corps on its southern flank. Italian X Corps, meanwhile were to hold El Mreir. By this stage the &quot;Afrika Korps&quot; had only 26 operational tanks. There was a sharp armoured exchange south of Ruweisat ridge during the morning and the main Axis advance was held. On 3 July, the RAF flew 780 sorties.

To relieve the pressure on the right and centre of the Eighth Army line, XIII Corps on the left advanced from the Qattara box (known to the New Zealanders as the Kaponga box). The plan was that the New Zealand 2nd Division‚Äîwith the remains of Indian 5th Division and 7th Motor Brigade under its command‚Äîwould swing north to threaten the Axis flank and rear. This force encountered the 132nd Armoured Division &quot;Ariete&quot;&#x27;s artillery, which was driving on the southern flank of the division as it attacked Ruweisat. The Italian commander ordered his battalions to fight their way out independently but the &quot;Ariete&quot; lost 531 men (about 350 were prisoners), 36 pieces of artillery, six (or eight?) tanks, and 55 trucks. By the end of the day, the &quot;Ariete&quot; Division had only five tanks. The day ended once again with the &quot;Afrika Korps&quot; and &quot;Ariete&quot; coming off second best to the superior numbers of the British 22nd Armoured and 4th Armoured Brigades, frustrating Rommel&#x27;s attempts to resume his advance. The RAF once again played its part, flying 900 sorties during the day.

To the south, on 5 July the New Zealand group resumed its advance northwards towards El Mreir intending to cut the rear of the &quot;Ariete&quot; Division. Heavy fire from the Italian 27th Infantry Division &quot;Brescia&quot; at El Mreir, however, north of the Qattara box, checked their progress and led XIII Corps to call off its attack.

===Rommel digs in===
At this point, Rommel decided his exhausted forces could make no further headway without resting and regrouping. He reported to the German High Command that his three German divisions numbered just 1,200‚Äì1,500 men each and resupply was proving highly problematic because of enemy interference from the air. He expected to have to remain on the defensive for at least two weeks.

Rommel was by this time suffering from the extended length of his supply lines. The Allied Desert Air Force (DAF) was concentrating fiercely on his fragile and elongated supply routes while British mobile columns moving west and striking from the south were causing havoc in the Axis rear echelons. Rommel could afford these losses even less since shipments from Italy had been substantially reduced (in June, he received of supplies compared with in May and 400 vehicles (compared with 2,000 in May). Meanwhile, the Eighth Army was reorganising and rebuilding, benefiting from its short lines of communication. By 4 July, the Australian 9th Division had entered the line in the north, and on 9 July the Indian 5th Infantry Brigade also returned, taking over the Ruweisat position. At the same time, the fresh Indian 161st Infantry Brigade reinforced the depleted Indian 5th Infantry Division.

===Tel el Eisa===
On 8 July, Auchinleck ordered the new XXX Corps commander‚ÄîLieutenant-General William Ramsden‚Äîto capture the low ridges at Tel el Eisa and Tel el Makh Khad and then to push mobile battle groups south toward Deir el Shein and raiding parties west toward the airfields at El Daba. Meanwhile, XIII Corps would prevent the Axis from moving troops north to reinforce the coastal sector. Ramsden tasked the Australian 9th Division with 44th Royal Tank Regiment under command with the Tel el Eisa objective and the South African 1st Division with eight supporting tanks, Tel el Makh Khad. The raiding parties were to be provided by 1st Armoured Division.

Following a bombardment which started at 03:30 on 10 July, the Australian 26th Brigade launched an attack against the ridge north of Tel el Eisa station along the coast (Trig 33). The bombardment was the heaviest barrage yet experienced in North Africa, which created panic in the inexperienced soldiers of the Italian 60th Infantry Division &quot;Sabratha&quot; who had only just occupied sketchy defences in the sector. The Australian attack took more than 1,500 prisoners, routed an Italian Division and overran the German Signals Intercept Company 621. Meanwhile, the South Africans had by late morning taken Tel el Makh Khad and were in covering positions.

Elements of the German 164th Light Division and Italian 101st Motorised Division &quot;Trieste&quot; arrived to plug the gap torn in the Axis defences. That afternoon and evening, tanks from the German 15th Panzer and Italian &quot;Trieste&quot; Divisions launched counter-attacks against the Australian positions, the counter-attacks failing in the face of overwhelming Allied artillery and the Australian anti-tank guns.

At first light on 11 July, the Australian 2/24th Battalion supported by tanks from 44th Royal Tank Regiment attacked the western end of Tel el Eisa hill (Point 24). By early afternoon, the feature was captured and was then held against a series of Axis counter-attacks throughout the day. A small column of armour, motorised infantry, and guns then set off to raid Deir el Abyad and caused a battalion of Italian infantry to surrender. Its progress was checked at the Miteirya ridge and it was forced to withdraw that evening to the El Alamein box. During the day, more than 1,000 Italian prisoners were taken.

On 12 July, the 21st &quot;Panzerdivision&quot; launched a counter-attack against Trig 33 and Point 24, which was beaten off after a 2¬Ω-hour fight, with more than 600 German dead and wounded left strewn in front of the Australian positions. The next day, the 21st &quot;Panzerdivision&quot; launched an attack against Point 33 and South African positions in the El Alamein box. In the El Alamein Box, the Royal Durban Light Infantry (RDLI) faced the full force of the German attacks. The RDLI did not have adequate anti-tank guns and the German artillery cut the South African telephone cables, disrupting their field artillery support. The attack was halted by intense artillery fire from the defenders. Although the South Africans repulsed the German attack, by 16:10, German tanks and dive bombers had advanced up to 300 metres from the South African positions. The 9th Australian field artillery, 7th British Medium Regiment had to assist in repulsing the German attack. At last light, the 79th British Anti-Tank Regiment was deployed to assist the South African forces, but the German attack was petering out. The South African losses on 13 July totalled nine dead and 42 wounded. 

South African casualties were relatively light due to their skill in withstanding the German attacks negated their casualties. Had the El Alamein Box been captured by Rommel&#x27;s forces, the consequences for the Eighth Army would have been devastating; the El Alamein line would have been ruptured, and Australian forces would have been cut off from the Eighth Army and forced into a general retreat to the Nile Delta. Rommel was still determined to drive the British forces from the northern salient. Although the Australian defenders had been forced back from Point 24, heavy casualties had been inflicted on 21st &quot;Panzerddivision&quot;. Another attack was mounted on 15 July but made no ground against tenacious resistance. On 16 July, the Australians‚Äîsupported by British tanks‚Äîlaunched an attack to try to take Point 24 but were forced back by German counter-attacks, suffering nearly fifty per cent casualties.

After seven days of fierce fighting, the battle in the north for the Tel el Eisa salient petered out. Australian 9th Division estimated at least 2,000 Axis troops had been killed and more than 3,700 prisoners of war taken in the battle. Possibly the most important feature of the battle, however, was that the Australians had captured Signals Intercept Company 621, which had been providing Rommel with priceless intelligence from British radio communications.

===First Battle of Ruweisat Ridge===
As the Axis forces dug in, Auchinleck‚Äîhaving drawn a number of German units to the coastal sector during the Tel el Eisa fighting‚Äîdeveloped a plan codenamed Operation Bacon to attack the Italian 17th Infantry Division &quot;Pavia&quot; and &quot;Brescia&quot; Divisions in the centre of the front at the Ruweisat ridge. Signals intelligence was giving Auchinleck clear details of the Axis order of battle and force dispositions. His policy was to &quot;...hit the Italians wherever possible in view of their low morale and because the Germans cannot hold extended fronts without them.&quot;

The intention was for the 4th New Zealand Brigade and 5th New Zealand Brigade (on 4th Brigade&#x27;s right) to attack north-west to seize the western part of the ridge and on their right the Indian 5th Infantry Brigade to capture the eastern part of the ridge in a night attack. Then, the 2nd Armoured Brigade would pass through the centre of the infantry objectives to exploit toward Deir el Shein and the Miteirya Ridge. On the left, the 22nd Armoured Brigade would be ready to move forward to protect the infantry as they consolidated on the ridge.

The attack commenced at 23:00 on 14 July. Shortly before dawn on 15 July, the two New Zealand brigades took their objectives, but minefields and pockets of resistance left behind the forward troops&#x27; advance created disarray among the attackers, impeding the move forward of reserves, artillery, and support arms. As a result, the New Zealand brigades occupied exposed positions on the ridge without support weapons except for a few anti-tank guns. More significantly, the two British armoured brigades failed to move forward to protect the infantry. At first light, a detachment from the 15th &quot;Panzerdivisions&quot; 8th &quot;Panzer&quot; Regiment launched a counter-attack against New Zealand 4th Brigade&#x27;s 22nd Battalion. A sharp exchange knocked out their anti-tank guns, and the infantry found themselves exposed in the open with no alternative but to surrender. Approximately 350 New Zealanders were taken prisoner.

While the 2nd New Zealand Division attacked the western slopes of Ruweisat Ridge, the Indian 5th Brigade made small gains on Ruweisat ridge to the east. By 07:00, word finally reached the 2nd Armoured Brigade, which started to move north west. Two regiments became embroiled in a minefield, but the third was able to join Indian 5th Infantry Brigade as it renewed its attack. With the help of the armour and artillery, the Indians were able to take their objectives by early afternoon. Meanwhile, the 22nd Armoured Brigade had been engaged at Alam Nayil by 90th Light Division and the &quot;Ariete&quot; Armoured Division, advancing from the south. While‚Äîwith help from mobile infantry and artillery columns from 7th Armoured Division‚Äîthey pushed back the Axis probe with ease, they were prevented from advancing north to protect the New Zealand flank.

Seeing the &quot;Brescia&quot; and &quot;Pavia&quot; under pressure, Rommel rushed German troops to Ruweisat. By 15:00, the 3rd Reconnaissance Regiment and part of 21st &quot;Panzerdivision&quot; from the north and 33rd Reconnaissance Regiment and the Baade Group comprising elements from 15th &quot;Panzerdivision&quot; from the south were in place under Lieutenant-General (&quot;General der Panzertruppe&quot;) Walther Nehring. At 17:00, Nehring launched his counter-attack. 4th New Zealand Brigade were still short of support weapons and also, by this time, ammunition. Once again, the anti-tank defences were overwhelmed and about 380 New Zealanders were taken prisoner including Captain Charles Upham who gained a second Victoria Cross for his actions, including destroying a German tank, several guns, and vehicles with grenades despite being shot through the elbow by a machine gun bullet. At about 18:00, the brigade HQ was overrun. At about 18:15, the 2nd Armoured Brigade engaged the German armour and halted the Axis eastward advance. At dusk, Nehring broke off the action.Early on 16 July, Nehring renewed his attack. The 5th Indian Infantry Brigade pushed them back, but it was clear from intercepted radio traffic that a further attempt would be made. Strenuous preparations to dig in anti-tank guns were made, artillery fire plans organised, and a regiment from the 22nd Armoured Brigade Gsent to reinforce the 2nd Armoured Brigade. When the attack resumed late in the afternoon, it was repulsed. After the battle, the Indians counted 24 knocked out tanks, as well as armoured cars and numerous anti-tank guns left on the battlefield.
In three days&#x27; fighting, the Allies took more than 2,000 Axis prisoners, mostly from the Italian &quot;Brescia&quot; and &quot;Pavia&quot; Divisions; the New Zealand division suffered 1,405 casualties. The fighting at Tel el Eisa and Ruweisat had caused the destruction of three Italian divisions, forced Rommel to redeploy his armour from the south, and made it necessary to lay minefields in front of the remaining Italian divisions and stiffen them with detachments of German troops.

===Miteirya Ridge (Ruin Ridge)===
To relieve pressure on Ruweisat ridge, Auchinleck ordered the Australian 9th Division to make another attack from the north. In the early hours of 17 July, the Australian 24th Brigade‚Äîsupported by 44th Royal Tank Regiment (RTR) and strong fighter cover from the air‚Äîassaulted Miteirya ridge (known as &quot;Ruin ridge&quot; to the Australians). The initial night attack went well, with 736 prisoners taken, mostly from the Italian &quot;Trento&quot; and &quot;Trieste&quot; motorised divisions. Once again, however, a critical situation for the Axis forces was retrieved by vigorous counter-attacks from hastily assembled German and Italian forces, which forced the Australians to withdraw back to their start line with 300 casualties. Although the Australian Official History of the 24th Brigade&#x27;s 2/32nd Battalion describes the counter-attack force as &quot;German&quot;, the Australian historian Mark Johnston reports that German records indicate that it was the &quot;Trento&quot; Division that overran the Australian battalion.

===Second Battle of Ruweisat Ridge (El Mreir)===

The Eighth Army now enjoyed a massive superiority in material over the Axis forces: 1st Armoured Division had 173 tanks and more in reserve or in transit, including 61 Grants while Rommel possessed only 38 German tanks and 51 Italian tanks although his armoured units had some 100 tanks awaiting repair.

Auchinleck&#x27;s plan was for Indian Infantry 161st Brigade to attack along Ruweisat ridge to take Deir el Shein, while the New Zealand 6th Brigade attacked from south of the ridge to the El Mreir depression. At daylight, two British armoured brigades‚Äî2nd Armoured Brigade and the fresh 23rd Armoured Brigade‚Äîwould sweep through the gap created by the infantry. The plan was complicated and ambitious.

The infantry night attack began at 16:30 on 21 July. The New Zealand attack took their objectives in the El Mreir depression but, once again, many vehicles failed to arrive and they were short of support arms in an exposed position. At daybreak on 22 July, the British armoured brigades again failed to advance. At daybreak on 22 July, Nehring&#x27;s 5th and 8th &quot;Panzer&quot; Regiments responded with a rapid counter-attack which quickly overran the New Zealand infantry in the open, inflicting more than 900 casualties on the New Zealanders. 2nd Armoured Brigade sent forward two regiments to help but they were halted by mines and anti-tank fire.

The attack by Indian 161st Brigade had mixed fortunes. On the left, the initial attempt to clear the western end of Ruweisat failed but at 08:00 a renewed attack by the reserve battalion succeeded. On the right, the attacking battalion broke into the Deir el Shein position but was driven back in hand-to-hand fighting.

Compounding the disaster at El Mreir, at 08:00 the commander of 23rd Armoured Brigade ordered his brigade forward, intent on following his orders to the letter. Major-General Gatehouse‚Äîcommanding 1st Armoured Division‚Äîhad been unconvinced that a path had been adequately cleared in the minefields and had suggested the advance be cancelled. However, XIII Corps commander‚ÄîLieutenant-General William Gott‚Äîrejected this and ordered the attack but on a centre line south of the original plan which he incorrectly believed was mine-free. These orders failed to get through and the attack went ahead as originally planned. The brigade found itself mired in mine fields and under heavy fire. They were then counter-attacked by 21st Panzer at 11:00 and forced to withdraw. The 23rd Armoured Brigade was destroyed, with the loss of 40 tanks destroyed and 47 badly damaged.

At 17:00, Gott ordered 5th Indian Infantry Division to execute a night attack to capture the western half of Ruweisat ridge and Deir el Shein. 3/14th Punjab Regiment from 9th Indian Infantry Brigade attacked at 02:00 on 23 July but failed as they lost their direction. A further attempt in daylight succeeded in breaking into the position but intense fire from three sides resulted in control being lost as the commanding officer was killed, and four of his senior officers were wounded or went missing.

===Attack on Tel el Eisa resumed===

To the north, Australian 9th Division continued its attacks. At 06:00 on 22 July, Australian 26th Brigade attacked Tel el Eisa and Australian 24th Brigade attacked Tel el Makh Khad toward Miteirya (Ruin Ridge). It was during this fighting that Arthur Stanley Gurney performed the actions for which he was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross. The fighting for Tel el Eisa was costly, but by the afternoon the Australians controlled the feature. That evening, Australian 24th Brigade attacked Tel el Makh Khad with the tanks of 50th RTR in support. The tank unit had not been trained in close infantry support and failed to co-ordinate with the Australian infantry. The result was that the infantry and armour advanced independently and having reached the objective 50th RTR lost 23 tanks because they lacked infantry support.

Once more, the Eighth Army had failed to destroy Rommel&#x27;s forces, despite its overwhelming superiority in men and equipment. On the other hand, for Rommel the situation continued to be grave as, despite successful defensive operations, his infantry had suffered heavy losses and he reported that &quot;the situation is critical in the extreme&quot;.

====Operation Manhood====
On 26/27 July, Auchinleck launched Operation Manhood in the northern sector in a final attempt to break the Axis forces. XXX Corps was reinforced with 1st Armoured Division (less 22nd Armoured Brigade), 4th Light Armoured Brigade, and 69th Infantry Brigade. The plan was to break the enemy line south of Miteirya ridge and exploit north-west. The South Africans were to make and mark a gap in the minefields to the south-east of Miteirya by midnight of 26/27 July. By 01:00 on 27 July, 24th Australian Infantry Brigade was to have captured the eastern end of the Miteirya ridge and would exploit toward the north-west. The 69th Infantry Brigade would pass through the minefield gap created by the South Africans to Deir el Dhib and clear and mark gaps in further minefields. The 2nd Armoured Brigade would then pass through to El Wishka and would be followed by 4th Light Armoured Brigade which would attack the Axis lines of communication.
This was the third attempt to break through in the northern sector, and the Axis defenders were expecting the attack. Like the previous attacks, it was hurriedly and therefore poorly planned. The Australian 24th Brigade managed to take their objectives on Miteirya Ridge by 02:00 of 27 July. To the south, the British 69th Brigade set off at 01:30 and managed to take their objectives by about 08:00. However, the supporting anti-tank units became lost in the darkness or delayed by minefields, leaving the attackers isolated and exposed when daylight came. There followed a period during which reports from the battlefront regarding the minefield gaps were confused and conflicting. As a consequence, the advance of 2nd Armoured Brigade was delayed. Rommel launched an immediate counter-attack and the German armoured battlegroups overran the two forward battalions of 69th Brigade. Meanwhile, 50th RTR supporting the Australians was having difficulty locating the minefield gaps made by Australian 2/24th Battalion. They failed to find a route through and in the process were caught by heavy fire and lost 13 tanks. The unsupported 2/28th Australian battalion on the ridge was overrun. The 69th Brigade suffered 600 casualties and the Australians 400 for no gain.

The Eighth Army was exhausted, and on 31 July Auchinleck ordered an end to offensive operations and the strengthening of the defences to meet a major counter-offensive.
Rommel was later to blame the failure to break through to the Nile on how the sources of supply to his army had dried up and how:
Rommel complained bitterly about the failure of important Italian convoys to get desperately needed tanks and supplies through to him, always blaming the Italian Supreme Command, never suspecting British code breaking.

According to Dr James Sadkovich and others, Rommel often displayed a distinct tendency to blame and scapegoat his Italian allies to cover up his own mistakes and deficiencies as a commander in the field. For example, while Rommel was a very good tactical commander, the Italian and German High Commands were concerned that he lacked operational awareness and a sense of strategic objectives. Dr Sadkovich points out that he would often out-run his logistics and squander valuable (mostly Italian) military hardware and resources, in battle after battle, without clear strategic goals or an appreciation of the limited logistics with which his Italian allies were desperately trying to provide him.

==Aftermath==

The battle was a stalemate, but it had halted the Axis advance on Alexandria (and then Cairo and ultimately the Suez Canal). The Eighth Army had suffered over 13,000 casualties in July, including 4,000 in the 2nd New Zealand Division, 3,000 in the 5th Indian Infantry Division and 2,552 battle casualties in the 9th Australian Division but had taken 7,000 prisoners and inflicted heavy damage on Axis men and machines. In his appreciation of 27 July, Auchinleck wrote that the Eighth Army would not be ready to attack again until mid-September at the earliest. He believed that because Rommel understood that with the passage of time the Allied situation would only improve, he was compelled to attack as soon as possible and before the end of August when he would have superiority in armour. Auchinleck therefore made plans for a defensive battle.

In early August, Winston Churchill and General Sir Alan Brooke‚Äîthe Chief of the Imperial General Staff (CIGS)‚Äîvisited Cairo on their way to meet Joseph Stalin in Moscow. They decided to replace Auchinleck, appointing the XIII Corps commander, William Gott, to the Eighth Army command and General Sir Harold Alexander as C-in-C Middle East Command. Persia and Iraq were to be split from Middle East Command as a separate Persia and Iraq Command and Auchinleck was offered the post of C-in-C (which he refused). Gott was killed on the way to take up his command when his aircraft was shot down. Lieutenant-General Bernard Montgomery was appointed in his place and took command on 13 August.

==Legacy==
The battle and the Second Battle of El Alamein three months later remain important to some of the countries that took part. Particularly in New Zealand, this is due to the country&#x27;s significant contribution to the defence of El Alamein, especially the heavy role the MƒÅori Battalion played. Members of this battalion have been labelled war heroes since, such as commander Frederick Baker, James Henare and Eruera Te Whiti o Rongomai Love, the last of whom was killed in action.

<doc id="11776" wikidata="Q989115" url="?curid=11776" title="First Italo-Ethiopian War">
<text>The First Italo-Ethiopian War, also referred to as the First Italo-Abyssinian War, or simply known as the Abyssinian War in Italy, (), was a military confrontation fought between Italy and Ethiopia from 1895 to 1896. It originated from the disputed Treaty of Wuchale, which the Italians claimed turned Ethiopia into an Italian protectorate, while the Ethiopians claimed that the treaty simply ensured peace between the two powers. Full-scale war broke out in 1895, with Italian troops from Italian Eritrea achieving initial successes against Tigrayan warlords at Coatit, Senafe and Debra Ail√†, until they were reinforced by a large Ethiopian army led by Emperor Menelik II. The Italian defeat came about after the Battle of Adwa, where the Ethiopian army dealt the outnumbered Italian soldiers and Eritrean askaris a decisive blow and forced their retreat back into Eritrea. The war concluded with the Treaty of Addis Ababa. Because this was one of the first decisive victories by African forces over a European colonial power, this war became a preeminent symbol of pan-Africanism and secured Ethiopia&#x27;s sovereignty until the Second Italo-Ethiopian War of 1935‚Äì37.

== Background ==

The Khedive of Egypt Isma&#x27;il Pasha, better known as Isma&#x27;il the Magnificent, had conquered Eritrea as part of his efforts to give Egypt an African empire. Isma&#x27;il had tried to follow up that conquest with Ethiopia, but the Egyptian attempts to conquer that realm ended in humiliating defeat in the Egyptian‚ÄìEthiopian War. After Egypt&#x27;s bankruptcy in 1876 followed by the &quot;Ansar&quot; revolt under the leadership of the Mahdi in 1881, the Egyptian position in Eritrea was hopeless with the Egyptian forces cut off and unpaid for years. By 1884 the Egyptians began to pull out of both Sudan and Eritrea.

On 3 June 1884, the Hewett Treaty was signed between Britain, Egypt and Ethiopia that allowed the Ethiopians to occupy parts of the dissolved Habesh Eyalet which allowed Ethiopian goods to pass in and out of Massawa duty-free. From the viewpoint of Britain, it was highly undesirable that the French replace the Egyptians in Massawa as that would allow the French to have more naval bases on the Red Sea that could interfere with British shipping using the Suez Canal, and as the British did not want the financial burden of ruling Massawa, they looked for another power who would be interested in replacing the Egyptians. The Hewett treaty seemed to suggest that Massawa would fall into the Ethiopian sphere of influence as the Egyptians pulled out. After initially encouraging the Emperor Yohannes IV to move into Massawa to replace the Egyptians, London decided to have the Italians move into Massawa. In his history of Ethiopia, British historian Augustus Wylde wrote: &quot;England made use of King John [Emperor Yohannes] as long as he was of any service and then threw him over to the tender mercies of Italy...It is one of our worst bits of business out of the many we have been guilty of in Africa...one of the vilest bites of treachery&quot;.

On 5 February 1885, Italian troops landed at Massawa to replace the Egyptians. The Italian government for its part was more than happy to embark upon an imperialist policy to distract its people from the failings in post &quot;Risorgimento&quot; Italy. In 1861, the unification of Italy was supposed to mark the beginning of a glorious new era in Italian life, and many Italians were gravely disappointed to find that not much had changed in the new Kingdom of Italy with the vast majority of Italians still living in abject poverty. To compensate, a chauvinist mood was rampant among the upper classes in Italy with the newspaper &quot;Il Diritto&quot; writing in an editorial: &quot;Italy must be ready. The year 1885 will decide her fate as a great power. It is necessary to feel the responsibility of the new era; to become again strong men afraid of nothing, with the sacred love of the fatherland, of all Italy, in our hearts&quot;. The struggle against the &quot;Ansar&quot; from Sudan complicated Yohannes&#x27;s relations with the Italians, whom he sometimes asked to provide him with guns to fight the &quot;Ansar&quot; and other times he resisted the Italians and proposed a truce with the &quot;Ansar&quot;.

On 18 January 1887, at a village named Saati, an advancing Italian army detachment defeated the Ethiopians in a skirmish, but it ended with the numerically superior Ethiopians surrounding the Italians in Saati after they retreated in face of the enemy&#x27;s numbers. Some 500 Italian soldiers under Colonel de Christoforis together with 50 Eritrean auxiliaries were sent to support the besieged garrison at Saati. At Dogali on his way to Saati, de Christoforis was ambushed by an Ethiopian force under &quot;Ras&quot; Alula, whose men armed with spears skillfully encircled the Italians who retreated to one hill and then to another higher hill. After the Italians ran out of ammunition, &quot;Ras&quot; Alula ordered his men to charge and the Ethiopians swiftly overwhelmed the Italians in an action that featured bayonets against spears. The Battle of Dogali ended with the Italians losing 23 officers and 407 other ranks killed. As a result of the defeat at Dogali, the Italians abandoned Saati and retreated back to the Red Sea coast. Italian newspapers called the battle a &quot;massacre&quot; and excoriated the &quot;Regio Esercito &quot; for not assigning de Chistoforis enough ammunition. Having, at first, encouraged Emperor Yohannes to move into Eritrea, and then having encouraged the Italians to also do so, London realised a war was brewing and decided to try to mediate, largely out of the fear that the Italians might actually lose.

The defeat at Dogali made the Italians cautious for a moment, but on 10 March 1889, Emperor Yohannes died after being wounded in battle against the &quot;Ansar&quot; and on his deathbed admitted that &quot;Ras&quot; Mengesha, the supposed son of his brother, was actually his own son and asked that he succeed him. The revelation that the emperor had slept with his brother&#x27;s wife scandalised intensely Orthodox Ethiopia, and instead the &quot;Negus&quot; Menelik was proclaimed emperor on 26 March 1889. &quot;Ras&quot; Mengesha, one of the most powerful Ethiopian noblemen, was unhappy about being by-passed in the succession and for a time allied himself with the Italians against the Emperor Menelik. Under the feudal Ethiopian system, there was no standing army, and instead, the nobility raised up armies on behalf of the Emperor. In December 1889, the Italians advanced inland again and took the cities of Asmara and Keren.

=== Outbreak of the war ===

On 25 March 1889, the Shewa ruler Menelik II declared himself Emperor of Ethiopia (or &quot;Abyssinia&quot;, as it was commonly called in Europe at the time). Barely a month later, on 2 May he signed the Treaty of Wuchale with the Italians, which apparently gave them control over Eritrea, the Red Sea coast to the northeast of Ethiopia, in return for recognition of Menelik&#x27;s rule, a sum of money and the provision of 30,000 rifles and 28 artillery cannons.

However, the bilingual treaty did not say the same thing in Italian and Amharic; the Italian version did not give the Ethiopians the &quot;significant autonomy&quot; written into the Amharic translation. The Italian text stated that Ethiopia must conduct its foreign affairs through Italy (making it an Italian protectorate), but the Amharic version merely stated that Ethiopia &quot;could&quot; contact foreign powers and conduct foreign affairs using the embassy of Italy. Italian diplomats, however, claimed that the original Amharic text included the clause and Menelik knowingly signed a modified copy of the Treaty. In October 1889, the Italians informed all of the other European governments because of the Treaty of Wuchale that Ethiopia was now an Italian protectorate and therefore the other European nations could not conduct diplomatic relations with Ethiopia. With the exceptions of the Ottoman Empire, which still maintained its claim to Eritrea, and Russia, which disliked the idea of an Orthodox nation being subjugated to a Roman Catholic nation, all of the European powers accepted the Italian claim to a protectorate.
The Italian claim that Menelik was aware of Article XVII turning his nation into an Italian protectorate seems unlikely given that the Emperor Menelik sent letters to Queen Victoria in late 1889 and was informed in the replies in early 1890 that Britain could not have diplomatic relations with Ethiopia on the account of Article XVII of the Treaty of Wuchale, a revelation that came as a great shock to the Emperor. The tone of Victoria&#x27;s letter was polite. The Queen informed Menelik that the restrictions on the import of arms were no longer in force and to prove this mentioned that Ras Makonnen received permission &quot;to pass two thousand rifles through Zeila, return to Harar&quot; i.e. from Italy. But on the question of further diplomatic contacts, she left no doubt in Menelik&#x27;s mind: &quot;We shall communicate to the Government of our Friend His Majesty the King of Italy copies of Your Majesty&#x27;s letter and of our reply.&quot; 
Francesco Crispi, the Italian Prime Minister, was an ultra-imperialist who believed the newly unified Italian state required &quot;the grandeur of a second Roman empire&quot;. Crispi believed that the Horn of Africa was the best place for the Italians to start building the new colonial empire. Because of the Ethiopian refusal to abide by the Italian version of the treaty and despite economic handicaps at home, the Italian government decided on a military solution to force Ethiopia to abide by the Italian version of the treaty. In doing so, they believed that they could exploit divisions within Ethiopia and rely on tactical and technological superiority to offset any inferiority in numbers. The efforts of Emperor Menelik, viewed as pro-French by London, to unify Ethiopia and thus bring the source of the Blue Nile under his control was perceived in Whitehall as a threat to their influence in Egypt. As Menelik became increasingly successful in expanding Ethiopia, the British government courted the Italians to counter Ethiopian expansion.

The only European ally of Ethiopia was Russia. The Ethiopian emperor sent his first diplomatic mission to St. Petersburg in 1895. In June 1895, the newspapers in St. Petersburg wrote, &quot;Along with the expedition, Menelik II sent his diplomatic mission to Russia, including his princes and his bishop&quot;. Many citizens of the capital came to meet the train that brought Prince Damto, General Genemier, Prince Belyakio, Bishop of Harer Gabraux Xavier and other members of the delegation to St. Petersburg. On the eve of war, an agreement providing military help for Ethiopia was concluded. Russia had been trying to gain a foothold in Ethiopia, and in 1894, after denouncing the Treaty of Wuchale in July, it received an Ethiopian mission in St. Petersburg and sent arms and ammunition to Ethiopia. The Russian travel writer Alexander Bulatovich who went to Ethiopia to serve as a Red Cross volunteer with the Emperor Menelik made a point of emphasizing in his books that the Ethiopians converted to Christianity before any of the Europeans ever did, described the Ethiopians as a deeply religious people like the Russians, and argued the Ethiopians did not have the &quot;low cultural level&quot; of the other African peoples, making them equal to the Europeans.

In 1893, judging that his power over Ethiopia was secure, Menelik repudiated the treaty; in response the Italians ramped up the pressure on his domain in a variety of ways, including the annexation of small territories bordering their original claim under the Treaty of Wuchale, and finally culminating with a military campaign and across the Mareb River into Tigray (on the border with Eritrea) in December 1894. The Italians expected disaffected potentates like Negus Tekle Haymanot of Gojjam, Ras Mengesha Yohannes, and the Sultan of Aussa to join them; instead, all of the Ethiopians flocked to the Emperor Menelik&#x27;s side in a display of both nationalism and anti-Italian feeling, while other peoples of dubious loyalty (e.g. the Sultan of Aussa) were watched by Imperial garrisons. In June 1894, &quot;Ras&quot; Mengesha and his generals appeared in Addis Ababa carrying large stones which they dropped before the Emperor Menelik (a gesture that is a symbol of submission in Ethiopian culture). There was overwhelming national unity in Ethiopia as various feuding noblemen rallied behind the emperor who insisted that Ethiopia, unlike the other African nations, would retain its freedom and not be subjugated by Italy.

Menelik had spent much of his reign building up a vast arsenal of modern weapons and ammunition acquired though treaty negotiations and purchases from the Russians, French, British, and even the Italians. In 1884, Count , the Italian envoy to Menelik II, was able to import 50,000 Remington rifles and 10 million cartridges in exchange for 600 camels bearing gold, ivory and civet. After Italian sources dried up Menelik strove to increase his other imports, in the few years preceding the war the arms trade expanded considerably. In November 1893, Menelik&#x27;s Swiss friend and advisor, Alfred Ilg, went to Paris where he traded gold and ivory for 80,000 Fusil Gras mle 1874, 33 pieces of artillery and 5,000 artillery shells. Menelik had also purchased 15,000 quick-firing rifles left over from the Franco-Hova Wars from the French arms trader L√©on Chefneux. By the end of 1894, 30,000 Berdan rifles and loads of ammunition were imported from Russia, and at least 250,000 cartridges were imported from French Djibouti.

==Course of the war==

In December 1894, Bahta Hagos led a rebellion against the Italians in Akkele Guzay, claiming support of Ras Mengesha Yohannes. Units of General Oreste Baratieri&#x27;s army under Major Pietro Toselli crushed the rebellion and killed Bahta at the Battle of Halai. Baratieri suspected that Mengesha would invade Eritrea, and met him at the Battle of Coatit in January 1895. The victorious Italians chased the retreating Mengesha, defeating him again at the battle of Senafe. Baratieri promptly marched into Adigrat on March 8 and occupied Adwa on April 2. He issued a proclamation, annexing Tigray province into Italian Eritrea, then moved into Mekelle and fortified an old church above the town&#x27;s spur. At this point, Emperor Menelik turned to France, offering a treaty of alliance; the French response was to abandon the Emperor in order to secure Italian approval of the Treaty of Bardo which would secure French control of Tunisia. Virtually alone, on 17 September 1895, Emperor Menelik issued a proclamation calling up the men of Abyssinia to join his army at Were Ilu. Leaders of every region in Ethiopia responded to Menelik&#x27;s call to arms and would assemble an army of over 100,000 men before marching north to face the Italian invaders.

The next clash came at Amba Alagi on 7 December 1895, when Ras Makonnen brought up his largely Shewan army to the slopes of Amba Alagi in southern Tigray. They were confronted by Major Pietro Toselli with 2,000 Eritreans and local Tigrayan askaris that had joined the Italians for various reasons. Makonnen was joined by Ras Mengesha Yohannes and Welle Betul, and together they overran the Italian positions on the natural fortress, killing Major Toselli and most of his men. General Giuseppe Arimondi, who had just arrived to reinforce Toselli, was barely able to escape and retreated with 400 survivors to the unfinished Italian fort at Mekele. Arimondi left a small garrison of approximately 1,150 askaris and 200 Italians there, commanded by Major Giuseppe Galliano, and took the bulk of his troops to Adigrat, where General Oreste Baratieri was concentrating the Italian army.

The first Ethiopian troops reached Mekele in the following days. Ras Makonnen surrounded the fort at Mekelle on 18 December. By the first days of January, Emperor Menelik II, accompanied by his Queen Taytu Betul, had led their massive imperial army into Tigray and joined Ras Makonnen at Mekele on 6 January 1896. While Italian journalists filled sensational reports of their brave country holding out against &quot;war-crazed black barbarians&quot;, Menelik had established contact with the Italian commander and gave him the opportunity to leave peacefully to Adigrat. The commander was defiant until the Ethiopians cut off the water supply to the fort and on January 21, with permission from the Italian high command, he agreed to surrender. Menelik allowed them to leave Mekelle with their weapons, and even provided the defeated Italians mules and pack animals to rejoin Baratieri. While some historians read this generous act as a sign that Emperor Menelik still hoped for a peaceful resolution to the war, Harold Marcus points out that this escort allowed him a tactical advantage: &quot;Menelik craftily managed to establish himself in Hawzien, at Gendepata, near Adwa, where the mountain passes were not guarded by Italian fortifications.&quot;

Menelik decided against attacking the Italian headquarters at Adigrat and instead marched west towards the plateau of Adwa. Baratieri feared that the Emperor intended to invade Eritrea and hence abandoned his positions at Adigrat and moved towards the area. On February 28, 1896, Baratieri called an assembly of all his generals and informed them that their provisions would run out, and asked if the army should retreat back to Asmara or attack Menelik&#x27;s army. All of his generals were opposed to retreat. Baratieri decided to rely on surprise by making up for his deficiency in manpower and issued a battle order on the next day.

=== Battle of Adwa ===
The decisive battle of the war was the Battle of Adwa on March 1, 1896, which took place in the mountainous country north of the actual town of Adwa (or Adowa). The Italian army comprised four brigades totaling approximately 17,700 men, with fifty-six artillery pieces; the Ethiopian army comprised several brigades numbering between 73,000 and 120,000 men (80‚Äì100,000 with firearms: according to Richard Pankhurst, the Ethiopians were armed with approximately 100,000 rifles of which about half were quick-firing), with almost fifty artillery pieces. General Oreste Baratieri underestimated the size of the Ethiopian force, predicating that Menelik could only field 30,000 men; also, the Ethiopians were better armed, being equipped with thousands of modern rifles and Hotchkiss artillery guns together with ammunition and shells which were superior to the Italian rifles and artillery. Menelik had ensured that his infantry and artillerymen were properly trained in their use, giving the Ethiopians a crucial advantage as the Hotchkiss artillery could fire more rapidly than the Italian artillery.

On the night of 29 February and the early morning of 1 March, three Italian brigades advanced separately towards Adwa over narrow mountain tracks, while a fourth remained camped. However, the three leading Italian brigades had become separated during their overnight march and by dawn were spread across several miles of very difficult terrain. Unbeknownst to General Baratieri, Emperor Menelik knew his troops had exhausted the ability of the local peasants to support them and had planned to break camp the next day. The Emperor had risen early when spies from Ras Alula brought him news that the Italians were advancing. The Emperor summoned the separate armies of his nobles and with the Empress Taytu Betul beside him, ordered his forces forward.

The Italian forces were hit by wave after wave of attacks, until Menelik released his reserve of 25,000 men, which overran an Italian brigade. Another brigade was cut off, and destroyed by a cavalry charge. The last two brigades were destroyed piecemeal in a devastating rout. By noon, the Italian survivors were in full retreat.

George Berkeley records that the Italian casualties were 6,133 men killed: 261 officers, 2,918 white NCOs and privates, 954 permanently missing, and about 2,000 ascari. Another 1,428 were wounded ‚Äì 470 Italians (including 31 officers) and 958 ascari. With 1,865 Italians and 1,000‚Äì2,000 ascaris taken prisoner. Richard Caulk estimates that the number of Italians killed were 300 officers, 4,600 Italian rank and 1,000 askari for a total of 5,900 dead. As well as and 1,000 of those who escaped wounded and at least 2,000 captured. Citing contemporary figures, Caulk records Ethiopian losses to be 3,886 killed and 6,000 wounded. Whereas Berkeley estimates Ethiopian losses to be 7,000 killed and 10,000 wounded. In their flight to Eritrea, the Italians left behind all of their artillery and 11,000 rifles, as well as most of their transport. As Paul B. Henze notes, &quot;Baratieri&#x27;s army had been completely annihilated while Menelik&#x27;s was intact as a fighting force and gained thousands of rifles and a great deal of equipment from the fleeing Italians.&quot; 800 captured Eritrean Ascari, regarded as traitors by the Ethiopians, had their right hands and left feet amputated, some were even castrated. The Italian prisoners were generally treated better. Although, about 70 Italian prisoners were massacred in retaliation for the death of Bashah Aboye, the officer responsible for the massacre was supposedly imprisoned by Menelik.

== Outcome and consequences ==

The Italian telegraph lines brought news of the disaster to Italy and the world almost immediately. Italy was shaken by political crisis and popular demonstrations. Riots broke out in several Italian cities, and within two weeks, Crispi was forced to resign amidst Italian disenchantment with &quot;foreign adventures&quot;. Soon after the battle, Menelik II later sent a message to Antonio Baldissera informing him that he would conclude peace if Italy publicly renounced their protectorate claim over Ethiopia. Baldissera agreed to accept only if Ethiopia agreed to not accept protection from any other European powers. At this Italian arrogance, Menelik broke off talks and withdrew his original offer. Upon returning to his capital at Addis Ababa, Menelik secured the Treaty of Addis Ababa in October, which delineated the borders of Eritrea and forced Italy to recognize &quot;absolutely and without any reserve&quot; the independence of Ethiopia.

The Russian support for Ethiopia led to a Russian Red Cross mission, though conceived as a medical support for the Ethiopian troops it arrived too late for the actual fighting. The mission arrived in Addis Ababa some three months after Menelik&#x27;s victory at Adwa. Owing to Russia&#x27;s diplomatic support of her fellow Orthodox nation, Russia&#x27;s prestige greatly increased in Ethiopia. The adventuresome Seljan brothers, Mirko and Stjepan, who were actually Catholic Croats, were warmly welcomed when they arrived in Ethiopia in 1899 when they misinformed their hosts by saying they were Russians.

Following this victory, the European powers moved rapidly to adjust relations with the Ethiopian Empire. Delegations from the United Kingdom and France‚Äîwhose colonial possessions lay next to Ethiopia‚Äîsoon arrived in the Ethiopian capital to negotiate their own treaties with this newly proven power. Quickly taking advantage of the Italian defeat, French influence increased markedly and France became one of the most influential European powers in Menelik&#x27;s court. In December 1896, a French diplomatic mission in Addis Ababa arrived and on 20 March 1897 signed a treaty that was described as &quot;&quot;v√©ritable trait√© d&#x27;alliance&quot;. In turn, the increase in French influence in Ethiopia led to fears in London that the French would gain control of the Blue Nile and would be able to &quot;lever&quot; the British out of Egypt. On the eve of the Battle of Adwa, two Sudanese envoys from the &quot;Mahdiyya&quot; state arrived at Menelik&#x27;s camp in Adwa to discuss concentrated action against the Italians, in July 1896 an Ethiopian envoy was present at Abdallahi ibn Muhammad&#x27;s court in Omdurman. The British, fearing that Menelik would support the Mahdist revolt, sent a diplomatic mission to Ethiopia and on 14 May 1897 signed the Anglo-Ethiopian Treaty of 1897 where Menelik assured the British that he would not support the Mahdists and declared the Mahdists as the enemy of his country. In December 1897, Ras Makonnen led an expedition against the Mahdists to seize the gold producing region of Benishangul-Gumuz.

In 1935, Italy launched a second invasion, which ended in 1937 with an Italian victory and the annexation of Ethiopia to Italian East Africa. Ethiopia was occupied by Italy until the Italians were driven out in 1941 by the Ethiopian Arbegnoch, patriots with assistance from the British Empire during World War II.

<doc id="11778" wikidata="Q102830" url="?curid=11778" title="Frederick Soddy">
<text>Frederick Soddy FRS (2 September 1877 ‚Äì 22 September 1956) was an English radiochemist who explained, with Ernest Rutherford, that radioactivity is due to the transmutation of elements, now known to involve nuclear reactions. He also proved the existence of isotopes of certain radioactive elements. In 1921, he received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry &quot;for his contributions to our knowledge of the chemistry of radioactive substances, and his investigations into the origin and nature of isotopes&quot;. Soddy was a polymath who mastered chemistry, nuclear physics, statistical mechanics, finance, and economics.

==Biography==
Soddy was born at 6 Bolton Road, Eastbourne, England, the son of Benjamin Soddy, corn merchant, and his wife Hannah Green. He went to school at Eastbourne College, before going on to study at University College of Wales at Aberystwyth and at Merton College, Oxford, where he graduated in 1898 with first class honours in chemistry. He was a researcher at Oxford from 1898 to 1900.

== Scientific career ==
In 1900, he became a demonstrator in chemistry at McGill University in Montreal, Quebec, where he worked with Ernest Rutherford on radioactivity.
He and Rutherford realized that the anomalous behaviour of radioactive elements was because they decayed into other elements.
This decay also produced alpha, beta, and gamma radiation. When radioactivity was first discovered, no one was sure what the cause was. It needed careful work by Soddy and Rutherford to prove that atomic transmutation was in fact occurring.

In 1903, with Sir William Ramsay at University College London, Soddy showed that the decay of radium produced helium gas. In the experiment a sample of radium was enclosed in a thin-walled glass envelope sited within an evacuated glass bulb. After leaving the experiment running for a long period of time, a spectral analysis of the contents of the former evacuated space revealed the presence of helium. Later in 1907, Rutherford and Thomas Royds showed that the helium was first formed as positively charged nuclei of helium (He2+) which were identical to alpha particles, which could pass through the thin glass wall but were contained within the surrounding glass envelope.

From 1904 to 1914, Soddy was a lecturer at the University of Glasgow. Ruth Pirret worked as his research assistant during this time. In May 1910 Soddy was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society. In 1914 he was appointed to a chair at the University of Aberdeen, where he worked on research related to World War I.

In 1913, Soddy showed that an atom moves lower in atomic number by two places on alpha emission, higher by one place on beta emission. This was discovered at about the same time by Kazimierz Fajans, and is known as the radioactive displacement law of Fajans and Soddy, a fundamental step toward understanding the relationships among families of radioactive elements. In 1913 Soddy also described the phenomenon in which a radioactive element may have more than one atomic mass though the chemical properties are identical. He named this concept isotope meaning &quot;same place&quot;. The word was initially suggested to him by Margaret Todd. Later, J. J. Thomson showed that non-radioactive elements can also have multiple isotopes.

The work that Soddy and his research assistant Ada Hitchins did at Glasgow and Aberdeen showed that uranium decays to radium.

Soddy published (1909) and &quot;Atomic Transmutation&quot; (1953).

In 1918, working with the Scottish scientist John Arnold Cranston, he announced the discovery of an isotope of the element later named protactinium. This slightly post-dated its discovery by the Germans Lise Meitner and Otto Hahn; however, it is said their discovery was actually made in 1915 but its announcement was delayed due to Cranston&#x27;s notes being locked away whilst on active service in the First World War.

In 1919, he moved to the University of Oxford as the first Dr. Lee&#x27;s Professor of Chemistry, where, in the period up till 1936, he reorganized the laboratories and the syllabus in chemistry. He received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his research in radioactive decay and particularly for his formulation of the theory of isotopes.

His work and essays popularising the new understanding of radioactivity was the main inspiration for H. G. Wells&#x27;s &quot;The World Set Free&quot; (1914), which features atomic bombs dropped from biplanes in a war set many years in the future. Wells&#x27;s novel is also known as &quot;The Last War&quot; and imagines a peaceful world emerging from the chaos. In &quot;Wealth, Virtual Wealth and Debt&quot; Soddy praises Wells&#x27;s &quot;The World Set Free&quot;. He also says that radioactive processes probably power the stars.

== Economics ==

In four books written from 1921 to 1934, Soddy carried on a &quot;campaign for a radical restructuring of global monetary relationships&quot;, offering a perspective on economics rooted in physics ‚Äì the laws of thermodynamics, in particular ‚Äì and was &quot;roundly dismissed as a crank&quot;. While most of his proposals ‚Äì &quot;to abandon the gold standard, let international exchange rates float, use federal surpluses and deficits as macroeconomic policy tools that could counter cyclical trends, and establish bureaus of economic statistics (including a consumer price index) in order to facilitate this effort&quot; ‚Äì are now conventional practice, his critique of fractional-reserve banking still &quot;remains outside the bounds of conventional wisdom&quot; although a recent paper by the IMF reinvigorated his proposals. Soddy wrote that financial debts grew exponentially at compound interest but the real economy was based on exhaustible stocks of fossil fuels. Energy obtained from the fossil fuels could not be used again. This criticism of economic growth is echoed by his intellectual heirs in the now emergent field of ecological economics.

&quot;The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics&quot;, an influential reference text in economics, recognized Soddy as a &quot;reformer&quot; for his works on monetary reforms.

== Political views ==

In &quot;Wealth, Virtual Wealth and Debt,&quot; Soddy cited the &quot;Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion&quot;, which had been widely disseminated by Henry Ford in the United States, as evidence that the belief in a &quot;financial conspiracy to enslave the world&quot; was widespread at the time. He further wrote that &quot;conscious conspiracy or not a corrupt monetary system strikes at the very life of the nation&quot;. Later in life he published a pamphlet &quot;Abolish Private Money, or Drown in Debt&quot; (1939).

The influence of his writing can be gauged, for example, in this quote from Ezra Pound:
Though some activists have insubstantially accused Soddy of anti-Semitism, most of his biographers dispute this narrative and argue that among Soddy&#x27;s friends and students were some Jews who held positive views of him.

== Descartes&#x27; theorem ==
He rediscovered the Descartes&#x27; theorem in 1936 and published it as a poem, &quot;The Kiss Precise&quot;, quoted at Problem of Apollonius. The kissing circles in this problem are sometimes known as Soddy circles.

== Honours and awards ==
He received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1921 and the same year was elected member of the International Atomic Weights Committee. A small crater on the far side of the Moon as well as the radioactive uranium mineral soddyite are named after him. The author H. G. Wells dedicated his novel &quot;The World Set Free&quot; to Soddy&#x27;s &quot;Interpretation of Radium&quot; (1909).

==Personal life==
In 1908, Soddy married Winifred Moller Beilby (1885‚Äì1936), the daughter of industrial chemist Sir George Beilby and Lady Emma Bielby, a philanthropist to women&#x27;s causes. The couple worked together and co-published a paper in 1910 on the absorption of gamma rays from radium. He died in Brighton, England in 1956, twenty days after his 79th birthday.

<text>Fur seals are any of nine species of pinnipeds belonging to the subfamily Arctocephalinae in the family Otariidae. They are much more closely related to sea lions than true seals, and share with them external ears (pinnae), relatively long and muscular foreflippers, and the ability to walk on all fours. They are marked by their dense underfur, which made them a long-time object of commercial hunting. Eight species belong to the genus &quot;Arctocephalus&quot; and are found primarily in the Southern Hemisphere, while a ninth species also sometimes called fur seal, the Northern fur seal (&quot;Callorhinus ursinus&quot;), belongs to a different genus and inhabits the North Pacific. The fur seals in &quot;Arctocephalus&quot; are more closely related to sea lions than they are to the Northern fur seal, but all three groups are more closely related to one another than they are to true seals.

==Taxonomy==

Fur seals and sea lions make up the family Otariidae. Along with the Phocidae and Odobenidae, ottariids are pinnipeds descending from a common ancestor most closely related to modern bears (as hinted by the subfamily Arctocephalinae, meaning &quot;bear-headed&quot;). The name pinniped refers to mammals with front and rear flippers. Otariids arose about 15-17 million years ago in the Miocene, and were originally land mammals that rapidly diversified and adapted to a marine environment, giving rise to the semiaquatic marine mammals that thrive today. Fur seals and sea lions are closely related and commonly known together as the &quot;eared seals&quot;. 
Until recently, fur seals were all grouped under a single subfamily of Pinnipedia, called the Arctocephalinae, to contrast them with Otariinae ‚Äì the sea lions ‚Äì based on the most prominent common feature, namely the coat of dense underfur intermixed with guard hairs. Recent genetic evidence, however, suggests &quot;Callorhinus&quot; is more closely related to some sea lion species, and the fur seal/sea lion subfamily distinction has been eliminated from many taxonomies. Nonetheless, all fur seals have certain features in common: the fur, generally smaller sizes, farther and longer foraging trips, smaller and more abundant prey items, and greater sexual dimorphism. For these reasons, the distinction remains useful. Fur seals comprise two genera: &quot;Callorhinus&quot;, and &quot;Arctocephalus&quot;. &quot;Callorhinus&quot; is represented by just one species in the Northern Hemisphere, the northern fur seal (&quot;Callorhinus ursinus&quot;), and &quot;Arctocephalus&quot; is represented by eight species in the Southern Hemisphere. The southern fur seals comprising the genus &quot;Arctocephalus&quot; include Antarctic fur seals, Galapagos fur seals, Juan Fernandez fur seals, New Zealand fur seals, brown fur seals, South American fur seals, and subantarctic fur seals.
==Physical appearance==

Along with the previously mentioned thick underfur, fur seals are distinguished from sea lions by their smaller body structure, greater sexual dimorphism, smaller prey, and longer foraging trips during the feeding cycle. The physical appearance of fur seals varies with individual species, but the main characteristics remain constant. 

Fur seals are characterized by their external pinnae, dense underfur, vibrissae, and long, muscular limbs. They share with other otariids the ability to rotate their rear limbs forward, supporting their bodies and allowing them to ambulate on land. In water, their front limbs, typically measuring about a fourth of their body length, act as oars and can propel them forward for optimal mobility. The surfaces of these long, paddle-like fore limbs are leathery with small claws. Otariids have a dog-like head, sharp, well-developed canines, sharp eyesight, and keen hearing. 

They are extremely sexually dimorphic mammals, with the males often two to five times the size of the females, with proportionally larger heads, necks, and chests. Size ranges from about 1.5 m, 64¬†kg in the male Galapagos fur seal (also the smallest pinniped) to 2.5 m, 180¬†kg in the adult male New Zealand fur seal. Most fur seal pups are born with a black-brown coat that molts at 2‚Äì3 months, revealing a brown coat that typically gets darker with age. Some males and females within the same species have significant differences in appearance, further contributing to the sexual dimorphism. Females and juveniles often have a lighter colored coat overall or only on the chest, as seen in South American fur seals. In a northern fur seal population, the females are typically silvery-gray on the dorsal side and reddish-brown on their ventral side with a light gray patch on their chest. This makes them easily distinguished from the males with their brownish-gray to reddish-brown or black coats.

==Habitat==
Of the fur seal family, eight species are considered southern fur seals, and only one is found in the Northern Hemisphere. The southern group includes Antarctic, Galapagos, Guadalupe, Juan Fernandez, New Zealand, brown, South American, and subantarctic fur seals. They typically spend about 70% of their lives in subpolar, temperate, and equatorial waters. Colonies of fur seals can be seen throughout the Pacific and Southern Oceans from south Australia, Africa, and New Zealand, to the coast of Peru and north to California. They are typically nonmigrating mammals, with the exception of the northern fur seal, which has been known to travel distances up to 10,000¬†km. Fur seals are often found near isolated islands or peninsulas, and can be seen hauling out onto the mainland during winter. Although they are not migratory, they have been observed wandering hundreds of miles from their breeding grounds in times of scarce resources. For example, the subantarctic fur seal typically resides near temperate islands in the South Atlantic and Indian Oceans north of the Antarctic Polar Front, but juvenile males have been seen wandering as far north as Brazil and South Africa.

==Behavior and ecology==

Typically, fur seals gather during the summer in large rookeries at specific beaches or rocky outcrops to give birth and breed. All species are polygynous, meaning dominant males reproduce with more than one female. For most species, total gestation lasts about 11.5 months, including a several-month period of delayed implantation of the embryo. Northern fur seal males aggressively select and defend the specific females in their harems. Females typically reach sexual maturity around 3‚Äì4 years. The males reach sexual maturity around the same time, but do not become territorial or mate until 6‚Äì10 years. 

The breeding season typically begins in November and lasts 2‚Äì3 months. The northern fur seals begin their breeding season as early as June due to their region, climate, and resources. In all cases, the males arrive a few weeks early to fight for their territory and groups of females with which to mate. They congregate at rocky, isolated breeding grounds and defend their territory through fighting and vocalization. Males typically do not leave their territory for the entirety of the breeding season, fasting and competing until all energy sources are depleted. 

The Juan Fernandez fur seals deviate from this typical behavior, using aquatic breeding territories not seen in other fur seals. They use rocky sites for breeding, but males fight for territory on land and on the shoreline and in the water. Upon arriving to the breeding grounds, females give birth to their pups from the previous season. About a week later, the females mate again and shortly after begin their feeding cycle, which typically consists of foraging and feeding at sea for about 5 days, then returning to the breeding grounds to nurse the pups for about 2 days. Mothers and pups locate each other using call recognition during nursing period. The Juan Fernandez fur seal has a particularly long feeding cycle, with about 12 days of foraging and feeding and 5 days of nursing. Most fur seals continue this cycle for about 9 months until they wean their pup. The exception to this is the Antarctic fur seal, which has a feeding cycle that lasts only 4 months. During foraging trips, most female fur seals travel around 200¬†km from the breeding site, and can dive around 200 m depending on food availability.

The remainder of the year, fur seals lead a largely pelagic existence in the open sea, pursuing their prey wherever it is abundant. They feed on moderately sized fish, squid, and krill. Several species of the southern fur seal also have sea birds, especially penguins, as part of their diets. Fur seals, in turn, are preyed upon by sharks, orcas, and occasionally by larger sea lions. These opportunistic mammals tend to feed and dive in shallow waters at night, when their prey are swimming near the surface. Fur seals occasionally gang up and evict sharks. South American fur seals exhibit a different diet; adults feed almost exclusively on anchovies, while juveniles feed on demersal fish, most likely due to availability.

When fur seals were hunted in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, they hauled out on remote islands where no predators were present. The hunters reported being able to club the unwary animals to death one after another, making the hunt profitable, though the price per seal skin was low.

==Population and survival==
The average lifespan of fur seals varies with different species from 13 to 25 years, with females typically living longer. Most populations continue to expand as they recover from previous commercial hunting and environmental threats. 
Many species were heavily exploited by commercial sealers, especially during the 19th century, when their fur was highly valued. Beginning in the 1790s, the ports of Stonington and New Haven, Connecticut, were leaders of the American fur seal trade, which primarily entailed clubbing fur seals to death on uninhabited South Pacific islands, skinning them, and selling the hides in China. Many populations, notably the Guadalupe fur seal, northern fur seal, and Cape fur seal, suffered dramatic declines and are still recovering. Currently, most species are protected, and hunting is mostly limited to subsistence harvest. Globally, most populations can be considered healthy, mostly because they often prefer remote habitats that are relatively inaccessible to humans. Nonetheless, environmental degradation, competition with fisheries, and climate change potentially pose threats to some populations.

<text>Federico Fellini (; 20 January 1920 ‚Äì 31 October 1993) was an Italian film director and screenwriter. He is known for his distinctive style, which blends fantasy and baroque images with earthiness. He is recognized as one of the greatest and most influential filmmakers of all time. His films have ranked highly in critical polls such as that of &quot;Cahiers du Cin√©ma&quot; and &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot;, which lists his 1963 film &quot;&quot; as the 10th-greatest film.

Fellini&#x27;s best-known films include &quot;I vitelloni&quot; (1953), &quot;La Strada&quot; (1954), &quot;Nights of Cabiria&quot; (1957), &quot;La Dolce Vita&quot; (1960), &quot;8¬Ω&quot; (1963), &quot;Juliet of the Spirits&quot; (1965), &quot;Fellini Satyricon&quot; (1969), &quot;Roma&quot; (1972), &quot;Amarcord&quot; (1973), and &quot;Fellini&#x27;s Casanova&quot; (1976).

Fellini was nominated for 17 Academy Awards over the course of his career, winning a total of four in the category of Best Foreign Language Film (the most for any director in the history of the award). He received an honorary award for Lifetime Achievement at the 65th Academy Awards in Los Angeles. Fellini also won the Palme d&#x27;Or for &quot;La Dolce Vita&quot; in 1960, two times the Moscow International Film Festival in 1963 and 1987, and the Career Golden Lion at the 42nd Venice International Film Festival in 1985. In &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot;s 2002 list of the greatest directors of all time, Fellini was ranked 2nd in the directors&#x27; poll and 7th in the critics&#x27; poll.

Fellini was born on 20 January 1920, to middle-class parents in Rimini, then a small town on the Adriatic Sea. On 25 January, at the San Nicol√≤ church he was baptized Federico Domenico Marcello Fellini. His father, Urbano Fellini (1894‚Äì1956), born to a family of Romagnol peasants and small landholders from Gambettola, moved to Rome in 1915 as a baker apprenticed to the Pantanella pasta factory. His mother, Ida Barbiani (1896‚Äì1984), came from a bourgeois Catholic family of Roman merchants. Despite her family&#x27;s vehement disapproval, she had eloped with Urbano in 1917 to live at his parents&#x27; home in Gambettola. A civil marriage followed in 1918 with the religious ceremony held at Santa Maria Maggiore in Rome a year later.

The couple settled in Rimini where Urbano became a traveling salesman and wholesale vendor. Fellini had two siblings, Riccardo (1921‚Äì1991), a documentary director for RAI Television, and Maria Maddalena (m. Fabbri; 1929‚Äì2002).

In 1924, Fellini started primary school in an institute run by the nuns of San Vincenzo in Rimini, attending the Carlo Tonini public school two years later. An attentive student, he spent his leisure time drawing, staging puppet shows and reading &quot;Il corriere dei piccoli&quot;, the popular children&#x27;s magazine that reproduced traditional American cartoons by Winsor McCay, George McManus and Frederick Burr Opper. (Opper&#x27;s &quot;Happy Hooligan&quot; would provide the visual inspiration for Gelsomina in Fellini&#x27;s 1954 film &quot;La Strada&quot;; McCay&#x27;s &quot;Little Nemo&quot; would directly influence his 1980 film &quot;City of Women&quot;.) In 1926, he discovered the world of Grand Guignol, the circus with Pierino the Clown and the movies. Guido Brignone&#x27;s &quot;Maciste all&#x27;inferno&quot; (1925, &quot;Maciste in Hell&quot;), the first film he saw, would mark him in ways linked to Dante and the cinema throughout his entire career.

Enrolled at the Ginnasio Giulio Cesare in 1929, he made friends with Luigi &quot;Titta&quot; Benzi, later a prominent Rimini lawyer (and the model for young Titta in &quot;Amarcord&quot; (1973)). In Mussolini&#x27;s Italy, Fellini and Riccardo became members of the &quot;Avanguardista&quot;, the compulsory Fascist youth group for males. He visited Rome with his parents for the first time in 1933, the year of the maiden voyage of the transatlantic ocean liner &quot;SS Rex&quot; (which is shown in &quot;Amarcord&quot;). The sea creature found on the beach at the end of &quot;La Dolce Vita&quot; (1960) has its basis in a giant fish marooned on a Rimini beach during a storm in 1934.

Although Fellini adapted key events from his childhood and adolescence in films such as &quot;I Vitelloni&quot; (1953), &quot;&quot; (1963), and &quot;Amarcord&quot; (1973), he insisted that such autobiographical memories were inventions: 
In 1937, Fellini opened Febo, a portrait shop in Rimini, with the painter Demos Bonini. His first humorous article appeared in the &quot;Postcards to Our Readers&quot; section of Milan&#x27;s &quot;Domenica del Corriere&quot;. Deciding on a career as a caricaturist and gag writer, Fellini travelled to Florence in 1938, where he published his first cartoon in the weekly &quot;420&quot;. According to a biographer, Fellini found school &quot;exasperating&quot; and, in one year, had 67 absences. Failing his military culture exam, he graduated from high school in 1939.

===Rome (1939)===
In September 1939, he enrolled in law school at the Sapienza University of Rome to please his parents. Biographer Hollis Alpert reports that &quot;there is no record of his ever having attended a class&quot;. Installed in a family &quot;pensione&quot;, he met another lifelong friend, the painter Rinaldo Geleng. Desperately poor, they unsuccessfully joined forces to draw sketches of restaurant and caf√© patrons. Fellini eventually found work as a cub reporter on the dailies &quot;Il Piccolo&quot; and &quot;Il Popolo di Roma&quot;, but quit after a short stint, bored by the local court news assignments.

Four months after publishing his first article in &quot;Marc&#x27;Aurelio&quot;, the highly influential biweekly humour magazine, he joined the editorial board, achieving success with a regular column titled &quot;But Are You Listening?&quot;. Described as &quot;the determining moment in Fellini&#x27;s life&quot;, the magazine gave him steady employment between 1939 and 1942, when he interacted with writers, gagmen, and scriptwriters. These encounters eventually led to opportunities in show business and cinema. Among his collaborators on the magazine&#x27;s editorial board were the future director Ettore Scola, Marxist theorist and scriptwriter Cesare Zavattini, and Bernardino Zapponi, a future Fellini screenwriter. Conducting interviews for &quot;CineMagazzino&quot; also proved congenial: when asked to interview Aldo Fabrizi, Italy&#x27;s most popular variety performer, he established such immediate personal rapport with the man that they collaborated professionally. Specializing in humorous monologues, Fabrizi commissioned material from his young prot√©g√©.

==Career and later life==
=== Early screenplays (1940‚Äì1943) ===

Retained on business in Rimini, Urbano sent his wife and family to Rome in 1940 to share an apartment with his son. Fellini and Ruggero Maccari, also on the staff of &quot;Marc&#x27;Aurelio&quot;, began writing radio sketches and gags for films.

Not yet twenty and with Fabrizi&#x27;s help, Fellini obtained his first screen credit as a comedy writer on Mario Mattoli&#x27;s &quot;Il pirata sono io&quot; (&quot;The Pirate&#x27;s Dream&quot;). Progressing rapidly to numerous collaborations on films at Cinecitt√†, his circle of professional acquaintances widened to include novelist Vitaliano Brancati and scriptwriter Piero Tellini. In the wake of Mussolini&#x27;s declaration of war against France and Britain on 10 June 1940, Fellini discovered Kafka&#x27;s &quot;The Metamorphosis&quot;, Gogol, John Steinbeck and William Faulkner along with French films by Marcel Carn√©, Ren√© Clair, and Julien Duvivier. In 1941 he published &quot;Il mio amico Pasqualino&quot;, a 74-page booklet in ten chapters describing the absurd adventures of Pasqualino, an alter ego.

Writing for radio while attempting to avoid the draft, Fellini met his future wife Giulietta Masina in a studio office at the Italian public radio broadcaster EIAR in the autumn of 1942. Well-paid as the voice of Pallina in Fellini&#x27;s radio serial, &quot;Cico and Pallina&quot;, Masina was also well known for her musical-comedy broadcasts which cheered an audience depressed by the war.
 In November 1942, Fellini was sent to Libya, occupied by Fascist Italy, to work on the screenplay of &quot;I cavalieri del deserto&quot; (&quot;Knights of the Desert&quot;, 1942), directed by Osvaldo Valenti and Gino Talamo. Fellini welcomed the assignment as it allowed him &quot;to secure another extension on his draft order&quot;. Responsible for emergency re-writing, he also directed the film&#x27;s first scenes. When Tripoli fell under siege by British forces, he and his colleagues made a narrow escape by boarding a German military plane flying to Sicily. His African adventure, later published in &quot;Marc&#x27;Aurelio&quot; as &quot;The First Flight&quot;, marked &quot;the emergence of a new Fellini, no longer just a screenwriter, working and sketching at his desk, but a filmmaker out in the field&quot;.

The apolitical Fellini was finally freed of the draft when an Allied air raid over Bologna destroyed his medical records. Fellini and Giulietta hid in her aunt&#x27;s apartment until Mussolini&#x27;s fall on 25 July 1943. After dating for nine months, the couple were married on 30 October 1943. Several months later, Masina fell down the stairs and suffered a miscarriage. She gave birth to a son, Pierfederico, on 22 March 1945, but the child died of encephalitis 11 days later on 2 April 1945. Masina and Fellini had no other children. The tragedy had enduring emotional and artistic repercussions.

===Neorealist apprenticeship (1944‚Äì1949)===
After the Allied liberation of Rome on 4 June 1944, Fellini and Enrico De Seta opened the Funny Face Shop where they survived the postwar recession drawing caricatures of American soldiers. He became involved with Italian Neorealism when Roberto Rossellini, at work on &quot;Stories of Yesteryear&quot; (later &quot;Rome, Open City&quot;), met Fellini in his shop, and proposed he contribute gags and dialogue for the script. Aware of Fellini&#x27;s reputation as Aldo Fabrizi&#x27;s &quot;creative muse&quot;, Rossellini also requested that he try to convince the actor to play the role of Father Giuseppe Morosini, the parish priest executed by the SS on 4 April 1944.

In 1947, Fellini and Sergio Amidei received an Oscar nomination for the screenplay of &quot;Rome, Open City&quot;.

Working as both screenwriter and assistant director on Rossellini&#x27;s &quot;Pais√†&quot; (&quot;Paisan&quot;) in 1946, Fellini was entrusted to film the Sicilian scenes in Maiori. In February 1948, he was introduced to Marcello Mastroianni, then a young theatre actor appearing in a play with Giulietta Masina. Establishing a close working relationship with Alberto Lattuada, Fellini co-wrote the director&#x27;s &quot;Senza piet√†&quot; (&quot;Without Pity&quot;) and &quot;Il mulino del Po&quot; (&quot;The Mill on the Po&quot;). Fellini also worked with Rossellini on the anthology film &quot;L&#x27;Amore&quot; (1948), co-writing the screenplay and in one segment titled, &quot;The Miracle&quot;, acting opposite Anna Magnani. To play the role of a vagabond rogue mistaken by Magnani for a saint, Fellini had to bleach his black hair blond.

===Early films (1950‚Äì1953)===

In 1950 Fellini co-produced and co-directed with Alberto Lattuada &quot;Variety Lights&quot; (&quot;Luci del variet√†&quot;), his first feature film. A backstage comedy set among the world of small-time travelling performers, it featured Giulietta Masina and Lattuada&#x27;s wife, Carla Del Poggio. Its release to poor reviews and limited distribution proved disastrous for all concerned. The production company went bankrupt, leaving both Fellini and Lattuada with debts to pay for over a decade. In February 1950, &quot;Pais√†&quot; received an Oscar nomination for the screenplay by Rossellini, Sergio Amidei, and Fellini.

After travelling to Paris for a script conference with Rossellini on &quot;Europa &#x27;51&quot;, Fellini began production on &quot;The White Sheik&quot; in September 1951, his first solo-directed feature. Starring Alberto Sordi in the title role, the film is a revised version of a treatment first written by Michelangelo Antonioni in 1949 and based on the &quot;fotoromanzi&quot;, the photographed cartoon strip romances popular in Italy at the time. Producer Carlo Ponti commissioned Fellini and Tullio Pinelli to write the script but Antonioni rejected the story they developed. With Ennio Flaiano, they re-worked the material into a light-hearted satire about newlywed couple Ivan and Wanda Cavalli (Leopoldo Trieste, Brunella Bovo) in Rome to visit the Pope. Ivan&#x27;s prissy mask of respectability is soon demolished by his wife&#x27;s obsession with the White Sheik. Highlighting the music of Nino Rota, the film was selected at Cannes (among the films in competition was Orson Welles&#x27;s &quot;Othello&quot;) and then retracted. Screened at the 13th Venice International Film Festival, it was razzed by critics in &quot;the atmosphere of a soccer match&quot;. One reviewer declared that Fellini had &quot;not the slightest aptitude for cinema direction&quot;.

In 1953, &quot;I Vitelloni&quot; found favour with the critics and public. Winning the Silver Lion Award in Venice, it secured Fellini his first international distributor.

===Beyond neorealism (1954‚Äì1960)===
Fellini directed &quot;La Strada&quot; based on a script completed in 1952 with Pinelli and Flaiano. It starred his wife Giulietta Masina, Anthony Quinn, and Richard Basehart. During the last three weeks of shooting, Fellini experienced the first signs of severe clinical depression. Aided by his wife, he undertook a brief period of therapy with Freudian psychoanalyst Emilio Servadio.

Fellini cast American actor Broderick Crawford to interpret the role of an aging swindler in &quot;Il Bidone&quot;. Based partly on stories told to him by a petty thief during production of &quot;La Strada&quot;, Fellini developed the script into a con man&#x27;s slow descent. To incarnate the role&#x27;s &quot;intense, tragic face&quot;, Fellini&#x27;s first choice had been Humphrey Bogart, but after learning of the actor&#x27;s lung cancer, chose Crawford after seeing his face on the theatrical poster of &quot;All the King&#x27;s Men&quot; (1949). The film shoot was wrought with difficulties stemming from Crawford&#x27;s alcoholism. Savaged by critics at the 16th Venice International Film Festival, the film did miserably at the box office and did not receive international distribution until 1964.

During the autumn, Fellini researched and developed a treatment based on a film adaptation of Mario Tobino&#x27;s novel, &quot;The Free Women of Magliano&quot;. Set in a mental institution for women, the project was abandoned when financial backers considered the subject had no potential.

While preparing &quot;Nights of Cabiria&quot; in spring 1956, Fellini learned of his father&#x27;s death by cardiac arrest at the age of sixty-two. Produced by Dino De Laurentiis and starring Giulietta Masina, the film took its inspiration from news reports of a woman&#x27;s severed head retrieved in a lake and stories by Wanda, a shantytown prostitute Fellini met on the set of &quot;Il Bidone&quot;. Pier Paolo Pasolini was hired to translate Flaiano and Pinelli&#x27;s dialogue into Roman dialect and to supervise researches in the vice-afflicted suburbs of Rome. The movie won the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film at the 30th Academy Awards and brought Masina the Best Actress Award at Cannes for her performance.

With Pinelli, he developed &quot;Journey with Anita&quot; for Sophia Loren and Gregory Peck. An &quot;invention born out of intimate truth&quot;, the script was based on Fellini&#x27;s return to Rimini with a mistress to attend his father&#x27;s funeral. Due to Loren&#x27;s unavailability, the project was shelved and resurrected twenty-five years later as &quot;Lovers and Liars&quot; (1981), a comedy directed by Mario Monicelli with Goldie Hawn and Giancarlo Giannini. For Eduardo De Filippo, he co-wrote the script of &quot;Fortunella&quot;.

The Hollywood on the Tiber phenomenon of 1958 in which American studios profited from the cheap studio labour available in Rome provided the backdrop for photojournalists to steal shots of celebrities on the via Veneto. The scandal provoked by Turkish dancer Haish Nana&#x27;s improvised striptease at a nightclub captured Fellini&#x27;s imagination: he decided to end his latest script-in-progress, &quot;Moraldo in the City&quot;, with an all-night &quot;orgy&quot; at a seaside villa. Pierluigi Praturlon&#x27;s photos of Anita Ekberg after an evening spent with the actress in a Rome night club provided further inspiration for Fellini and his screenwriters.

Changing the title of the screenplay to &quot;La Dolce Vita&quot;, Fellini soon clashed with his producer on casting: The director insisted on the relatively unknown Mastroianni while De Laurentiis wanted Paul Newman as a hedge on his investment. Reaching an impasse, De Laurentiis sold the rights to publishing mogul Angelo Rizzoli. Shooting began on 16 March 1959 with Anita Ekberg climbing the stairs to the cupola of Saint Peter&#x27;s in a mammoth d√©cor constructed at Cinecitt√†. The statue of Christ flown by helicopter over Rome to St. Peter&#x27;s Square was inspired by an actual media event on 1 May 1956, which Fellini had witnessed.

&quot;La Dolce Vita&quot; broke all box office records. Despite scalpers selling tickets at 1000 lire, crowds queued in line for hours to see an &quot;immoral movie&quot; before the censors banned it. At an exclusive Milan screening on 5 February 1960, one outraged patron spat on Fellini while others hurled insults. Denounced in parliament by right-wing conservatives, undersecretary Domenico Magr√¨ of the Christian Democrats demanded tolerance for the film&#x27;s controversial themes. The Vatican&#x27;s official press organ, &quot;L&#x27;Osservatore Romano&quot;, lobbied for censorship while the Board of Roman Parish Priests and the Genealogical Board of Italian Nobility attacked the film. In one documented instance involving favourable reviews written by the Jesuits of San Fedele, defending &quot;La Dolce Vita&quot; had severe consequences. In competition at Cannes alongside Antonioni&#x27;s &quot;L&#x27;Avventura&quot;, the film won the Palme d&#x27;Or awarded by presiding juror Georges Simenon. The Belgian writer was promptly &quot;hissed at&quot; by the disapproving festival crowd.

===Art films and dreams (1961‚Äì1969)===

A major discovery for Fellini after his Italian neorealism period (1950‚Äì1959) was the work of Carl Jung. After meeting Jungian psychoanalyst Dr. Ernst Bernhard in early 1960, he read Jung&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;Memories, Dreams, Reflections&quot; (1963) and experimented with LSD. Bernhard also recommended that Fellini consult the &quot;I Ching&quot; and keep a record of his dreams. What Fellini formerly accepted as &quot;his extrasensory perceptions&quot; were now interpreted as psychic manifestations of the unconscious. Bernhard&#x27;s focus on Jungian depth psychology proved to be the single greatest influence on Fellini&#x27;s mature style and marked the turning point in his work from neorealism to filmmaking that was &quot;primarily oneiric&quot;. As a consequence, Jung&#x27;s seminal ideas on the &quot;anima&quot; and the &quot;animus&quot;, the role of archetypes and the collective unconscious directly influenced such films as &quot;&quot; (1963), &quot;Juliet of the Spirits&quot; (1965), &quot;Fellini Satyricon&quot; (1969), &quot;Casanova&quot; (1976), and &quot;City of Women&quot; (1980). Other key influences on his work include Luis Bu√±uel, Charlie Chaplin, Sergei Eisenstein, Buster Keaton, Laurel and Hardy, the Marx Brothers, and Roberto Rossellini.

Exploiting &quot;La Dolce Vita&quot;‚Ä≥s success, financier Angelo Rizzoli set up Federiz in 1960, an independent film company, for Fellini and production manager Clemente Fracassi to discover and produce new talent. Despite the best intentions, their overcautious editorial and business skills forced the company to close down soon after cancelling Pasolini&#x27;s project, &quot;Accattone&quot; (1961).

Condemned as a &quot;public sinner&quot;, for &quot;La Dolce Vita&quot;, Fellini responded with &quot;The Temptations of Doctor Antonio&quot;, a segment in the omnibus &quot;Boccaccio &#x27;70&quot;. His second colour film, it was the sole project green-lighted at Federiz. Infused with the surrealistic satire that characterized the young Fellini&#x27;s work at &quot;Marc&#x27;Aurelio&quot;, the film ridiculed a crusader against vice, interpreted by Peppino De Filippo, who goes insane trying to censor a billboard of Anita Ekberg espousing the virtues of milk.

In an October 1960 letter to his colleague Brunello Rondi, Fellini first outlined his film ideas about a man suffering creative block: &quot;Well then ‚Äì a guy (a writer? any kind of professional man? a theatrical producer?) has to interrupt the usual rhythm of his life for two weeks because of a not-too-serious disease. It&#x27;s a warning bell: something is blocking up his system.&quot; Unclear about the script, its title, and his protagonist&#x27;s profession, he scouted locations throughout Italy &quot;looking for the film&quot;, in the hope of resolving his confusion. Flaiano suggested &quot;La bella confusione&quot; (literally &quot;The Beautiful Confusion&quot;) as the movie&#x27;s title. Under pressure from his producers, Fellini finally settled on &quot;&quot;, a self-referential title referring principally (but not exclusively) to the number of films he had directed up to that time.

Giving the order to start production in spring 1962, Fellini signed deals with his producer Rizzoli, fixed dates, had sets constructed, cast Mastroianni, Anouk Aim√©e, and Sandra Milo in lead roles, and did screen tests at the Scalera Studios in Rome. He hired cinematographer Gianni Di Venanzo, among key personnel. But apart from naming his hero Guido Anselmi, he still couldn&#x27;t decide what his character did for a living. The crisis came to a head in April when, sitting in his Cinecitt√† office, he began a letter to Rizzoli confessing he had &quot;lost his film&quot; and had to abandon the project. Interrupted by the chief machinist requesting he celebrate the launch of &quot;&quot;, Fellini put aside the letter and went on the set. Raising a toast to the crew, he &quot;felt overwhelmed by shame‚Ä¶ I was in a no exit situation. I was a director who wanted to make a film he no longer remembers. And lo and behold, at that very moment everything fell into place. I got straight to the heart of the film. I would narrate everything that had been happening to me. I would make a film telling the story of a director who no longer knows what film he wanted to make&quot;. The self-mirroring structure makes the entire film inseparable from its reflecting construction.

Shooting began on 9 May 1962. Perplexed by the seemingly chaotic, incessant improvisation on the set, Deena Boyer, the director&#x27;s American press officer at the time, asked for a rationale. Fellini told her that he hoped to convey the three levels &quot;on which our minds live: the past, the present, and the conditional ‚Äî the realm of fantasy&quot;. After shooting wrapped on 14 October, Nino Rota composed various circus marches and fanfares that would later become signature tunes of the maestro&#x27;s cinema. Nominated for four Oscars, &quot;&quot; won awards for best foreign language film and best costume design in black-and-white. In California for the ceremony, Fellini toured Disneyland with Walt Disney the day after.

Increasingly attracted to parapsychology, Fellini met the Turin antiquarian Gustavo Rol in 1963. Rol, a former banker, introduced him to the world of Spiritism and s√©ances. In 1964, Fellini took LSD under the supervision of Emilio Servadio, his psychoanalyst during the 1954 production of &quot;La Strada&quot;. For years reserved about what actually occurred that Sunday afternoon, he admitted in 1992 that
...¬†objects and their functions no longer had any significance. All I perceived was perception itself, the hell of forms and figures devoid of human emotion and detached from the reality of my unreal environment. I was an instrument in a virtual world that constantly renewed its own meaningless image in a living world that was itself perceived outside of nature. And since the appearance of things was no longer definitive but limitless, this paradisiacal awareness freed me from the reality external to my self. The fire and the rose, as it were, became one.

Fellini&#x27;s hallucinatory insights were given full flower in his first colour feature &quot;Juliet of the Spirits&quot; (1965), depicting Giulietta Masina as Juliet, a housewife who rightly suspects her husband&#x27;s infidelity and succumbs to the voices of spirits summoned during a s√©ance at her home. Her sexually voracious next door neighbor Suzy (Sandra Milo) introduces Juliet to a world of uninhibited sensuality, but Juliet is haunted by childhood memories of her Catholic guilt and a teenaged friend who committed suicide. Complex and filled with psychological symbolism, the film is set to a jaunty score by Nino Rota.

===Nostalgia, sexuality, and politics (1970‚Äì1980)===
To help promote &quot;Satyricon&quot; in the United States, Fellini flew to Los Angeles in January 1970 for interviews with Dick Cavett and David Frost. He also met with film director Paul Mazursky who wanted to cast him in a starring role alongside Donald Sutherland in his new film, &quot;Alex in Wonderland&quot;. In February, Fellini scouted locations in Paris for &quot;The Clowns&quot;, a docufiction both for cinema and television, based on his childhood memories of the circus and a &quot;coherent theory of clowning.&quot; As he saw it, the clown &quot;was always the caricature of a well-established, ordered, peaceful society. But today all is temporary, disordered, grotesque. Who can still laugh at clowns?... All the world plays a clown now.&quot;

In March 1971, Fellini began production on &quot;Roma&quot;, a seemingly random collection of episodes informed by the director&#x27;s memories and impressions of Rome. The &quot;diverse sequences,&quot; writes Fellini scholar Peter Bondanella, &quot;are held together only by the fact that they all ultimately originate from the director&#x27;s fertile imagination.&quot; The film&#x27;s opening scene anticipates &quot;Amarcord&quot; while its most surreal sequence involves an ecclesiastical fashion show in which nuns and priests roller skate past shipwrecks of cobwebbed skeletons.

Over a period of six months between January and June 1973, Fellini shot the Oscar-winning &quot;Amarcord&quot;. Loosely based on the director&#x27;s 1968 autobiographical essay &quot;My Rimini&quot;, the film depicts the adolescent Titta and his friends working out their sexual frustrations against the religious and Fascist backdrop of a provincial town in Italy during the 1930s. Produced by Franco Cristaldi, the seriocomic movie became Fellini&#x27;s second biggest commercial success after &quot;La Dolce Vita&quot;. Circular in form, &quot;Amarcord&quot; avoids plot and linear narrative in a way similar to &quot;The Clowns&quot; and &quot;Roma&quot;. The director&#x27;s overriding concern with developing a poetic form of cinema was first outlined in a 1965 interview he gave to &quot;The New Yorker&quot; journalist Lillian Ross: &quot;I am trying to free my work from certain constrictions ‚Äì a story with a beginning, a development, an ending. It should be more like a poem with metre and cadence.&quot;

===Late films and projects (1981‚Äì1990)===

Organized by his publisher Diogenes Verlag in 1982, the first major exhibition of 63 drawings by Fellini was held in Paris, Brussels, and the Pierre Matisse Gallery in New York. A gifted caricaturist, he found much of the inspiration for his sketches from his own dreams while the films-in-progress both originated from and stimulated drawings for characters, decor, costumes and set designs. Under the title, &quot;I disegni di Fellini&quot; (Fellini&#x27;s Designs), he published 350 drawings executed in pencil, watercolours, and felt pens.

On 6 September 1985 Fellini was awarded the Golden Lion for lifetime achievement at the 42nd Venice Film Festival. That same year, he became the first non-American to receive the Film Society of Lincoln Center&#x27;s annual award for cinematic achievement.

Long fascinated by Carlos Castaneda&#x27;s &quot;The Teachings of Don Juan: A Yaqui Way of Knowledge&quot;, Fellini accompanied the Peruvian author on a journey to the Yucat√°n to assess the feasibility of a film. After first meeting Castaneda in Rome in October 1984, Fellini drafted a treatment with Pinelli titled &quot;Viaggio a Tulun&quot;. Producer Alberto Grimaldi, prepared to buy film rights to all of Castaneda&#x27;s work, then paid for pre-production research taking Fellini and his entourage from Rome to Los Angeles and the jungles of Mexico in October 1985. When Castaneda inexplicably disappeared and the project fell through, Fellini&#x27;s mystico-shamanic adventures were scripted with Pinelli and serialized in &quot;Corriere della Sera&quot; in May 1986. A barely veiled satirical interpretation of Castaneda&#x27;s work, &quot;Viaggio a Tulun&quot; was published in 1989 as a graphic novel with artwork by Milo Manara and as &quot;Trip to Tulum&quot; in America in 1990.

For &quot;Intervista&quot;, produced by Ibrahim Moussa and RAI Television, Fellini intercut memories of the first time he visited Cinecitt√† in 1939 with present-day footage of himself at work on a screen adaptation of Franz Kafka&#x27;s &quot;Amerika&quot;. A meditation on the nature of memory and film production, it won the special 40th Anniversary Prize at Cannes and the 15th Moscow International Film Festival Golden Prize. In Brussels later that year, a panel of thirty professionals from eighteen European countries named Fellini the world&#x27;s best director and &quot;&quot; the best European film of all time.

In early 1989 Fellini began production on &quot;The Voice of the Moon&quot;, based on Ermanno Cavazzoni&#x27;s novel, &quot;Il poema dei lunatici&quot; (&quot;The Lunatics&#x27; Poem&quot;). A small town was built at Empire Studios on the via Pontina outside Rome. Starring Roberto Benigni as Ivo Salvini, a madcap poetic figure newly released from a mental institution, the character is a combination of &quot;La Strada&quot;‚Ä≥s Gelsomina, Pinocchio, and Italian poet Giacomo Leopardi. Fellini improvised as he filmed, using as a guide a rough treatment written with Pinelli. Despite its modest critical and commercial success in Italy, and its warm reception by French critics, it failed to interest North American distributors.

Fellini won the &quot;Praemium Imperiale&quot;, an international prize in the visual arts given by the Japan Art Association in 1990.

===Final years (1991‚Äì1993)===
In July 1991 and April 1992, Fellini worked in close collaboration with Canadian filmmaker Damian Pettigrew to establish &quot;the longest and most detailed conversations ever recorded on film&quot;. Described as the &quot;Maestro&#x27;s spiritual testament&quot; by his biographer Tullio Kezich, excerpts culled from the conversations later served as the basis of their feature documentary, &quot;&quot; (2002) and the book, &quot;I&#x27;m a Born Liar: A Fellini Lexicon&quot;.

In April 1993 Fellini received his fifth Oscar, for lifetime achievement, &quot;in recognition of his cinematic accomplishments that have thrilled and entertained audiences worldwide&quot;. On 16 June, he entered the Cantonal Hospital in Z√ºrich for an angioplasty on his femoral artery but suffered a stroke at Rimini&#x27;s Grand Hotel two months later. Partially paralyzed, he was first transferred to Ferrara for rehabilitation and then to the Policlinico Umberto I in Rome to be near his wife, also hospitalized. He suffered a second stroke and fell into an irreversible coma.

==Death==

Fellini died in Rome on 31 October 1993 at the age of 73 after a heart attack he suffered a few weeks earlier, a day after his 50th wedding anniversary. The memorial service, in Studio 5 at Cinecitt√†, was attended by an estimated 70,000 people. At Giulietta Masina&#x27;s request, trumpeter Mauro Maur played Nino Rota&#x27;s &quot;Improvviso dell&#x27;Angelo&quot; during the ceremony.

Five months later, on 23 March 1994, Masina died of lung cancer. Fellini is buried with Masina and their son, Pierfederico, in a bronze sepulchre sculpted by Arnaldo Pomodoro in the Monumental Cemetery of Rimini. Rimini&#x27;s Federico Fellini Airport is named in his honour.

==Religious views==
Fellini was raised in a Roman Catholic family and considered himself a Catholic, but avoided formal activity in the Catholic Church. Fellini&#x27;s films include Catholic themes; some celebrate Catholic teachings, while others criticize or ridicule church dogma.

In 1965, Fellini said: 
==Political views==
While Fellini was for the most part indifferent to politics, he had a general dislike of authoritarian institutions, and is interpreted by Bondanella as believing in &quot;the dignity and even the nobility of the individual human being&quot;. In a 1966 interview, he said, &quot;I make it a point to see if certain ideologies or political attitudes threaten the private freedom of the individual. But for the rest, I am not prepared nor do I plan to become interested in politics.&quot;

Despite various famous Italian actors favouring the Communists, Fellini was opposed to communism. He preferred to move within the world of the moderate left, and voted for the Italian Republican Party of his friend Ugo La Malfa as well as the reformist socialists of Pietro Nenni, another friend of his, and voted only once for the Christian Democracy party (&quot;Democrazia Cristiana&quot;, DC) in 1976 to keep the Communists out of power. Bondanella writes that DC &quot;was far too aligned with an extremely conservative and even reactionary pre-Vatican II church to suit Fellini&#x27;s tastes.&quot;

Apart from satirizing Silvio Berlusconi and mainstream television in &quot;Ginger and Fred&quot;, Fellini rarely expressed political views in public and never directed an overtly political film. He directed two electoral television spots during the 1990s: one for DC and another for the Italian Republican Party (PRI). His slogan &quot;Non si interrompe un&#x27;emozione&quot; (&quot;Don&#x27;t interrupt an emotion&quot;) was directed against the excessive use of TV advertisements. The Democratic Party of the Left also used the slogan in the referendums of 1995.

==Influence and legacy==
Personal and highly idiosyncratic visions of society, Fellini&#x27;s films are a unique combination of memory, dreams, fantasy and desire. The adjectives &quot;Fellinian&quot; and &quot;Felliniesque&quot; are &quot;synonymous with any kind of extravagant, fanciful, even baroque image in the cinema and in art in general&quot;. &quot;La Dolce Vita&quot; contributed the term &quot;paparazzi&quot; to the English language, derived from Paparazzo, the photographer friend of journalist Marcello Rubini (Marcello Mastroianni).

Contemporary filmmakers such as Martin Scorsese, Woody Allen, Pedro Almod√≥var, Roy Andersson, Darren Aronofsky, Greta Gerwig, Ari Aster, Tim Burton, Terry Gilliam, Emir Kusturica, Peter Greenaway, Alejandro Gonz√°lez I√±√°rritu, Luca Guadagnino, Alejandro Jodorowsky, Yorgos Lanthimos, George Lucas, David Lynch, Paolo Sorrentino, and Giuseppe Tornatore have cited Fellini&#x27;s influence on their work.

Polish director Wojciech Has, whose two best-received films, &quot;The Saragossa Manuscript&quot; (1965) and &quot;The Hour-Glass Sanatorium&quot; (1973), are examples of modernist fantasies, has been compared to Fellini for the sheer &quot;luxuriance of his images&quot;.

Roman Polanski considered Fellini to be among the three film-makers he favored most, along with Akira Kurosawa and Orson Welles.

&quot;I Vitelloni&quot; inspired European directors Juan Antonio Bardem, Marco Ferreri, and Lina Wertm√ºller and influenced Martin Scorsese&#x27;s &quot;Mean Streets&quot; (1973), George Lucas&#x27;s &quot;American Graffiti&quot; (1974), Joel Schumacher&#x27;s &quot;St. Elmo&#x27;s Fire&quot; (1985), and Barry Levinson&#x27;s &quot;Diner&quot; (1982), among many others. When the American magazine &quot;Cinema&quot; asked Stanley Kubrick in 1963 to name his ten favorite films, he ranked &quot;I Vitelloni&quot; number one.

International film directors who have named &quot;La Strada&quot; as one of their favorite films include Stanley Kwan, Anton Corbijn, Gillies MacKinnon, Andreas Dresen, Ji≈ô√≠ Menzel, Adoor Gopalakrishnan, Mike Newell, Rajko Grliƒá, Spike Lee, Laila Pakalni≈Üa, Ann Hui, Akira Kurosawa, Kazuhiro Soda, Julian Jarrold, Krzysztof Zanussi, and Andrey Konchalovsky. David Cronenberg credits &quot;La Strada&quot; for opening his eyes to the possibilities of cinema when, as a child, he saw adults leave a showing of the film openly weeping.

&quot;Nights of Cabiria&quot; was adapted as the Broadway musical &quot;Sweet Charity&quot; and the movie &quot;Sweet Charity&quot; (1969) by Bob Fosse starring Shirley MacLaine. &quot;City of Women&quot; was adapted for the Berlin stage by Frank Castorf in 1992.

&#x27; inspired, among others, &quot;Mickey One&quot; (Arthur Penn, 1965), &quot;Alex in Wonderland&quot; (Paul Mazursky, 1970), &quot;Beware of a Holy Whore&quot; (Rainer Werner Fassbinder, 1971), &quot;Day for Night&quot; (Fran√ßois Truffaut, 1973), &quot;All That Jazz&quot; (Bob Fosse, 1979), &quot;Stardust Memories&quot; (Woody Allen, 1980), &quot;Sogni d&#x27;oro&quot; (Nanni Moretti, 1981), &quot;Parad Planet&quot; (Vadim Abdrashitov, 1984), &quot;La Pel√≠cula del rey&quot; (Carlos Sorin, 1986), &quot;Living in Oblivion&quot; (Tom DiCillo, 1995), &quot;Women&quot; (Peter Greenaway, 1999), &quot;Falling Down&quot; (Joel Schumacher, 1993), and the Broadway musical &quot;Nine&quot; (Maury Yeston and Arthur Kopit, 1982). &quot;Yo-Yo Boing!&quot; (1998), a Spanish novel by Puerto Rican writer Giannina Braschi, features a dream sequence with Fellini inspired by &#x27;.

&quot;Alice&quot; by Woody Allen is a loose reworking of Fellini&#x27;s 1965 film &quot;Juliet of the Spirits&quot;.

Fellini&#x27;s work is referenced on the albums &quot;Fellini Days&quot; (2001) by Fish, &quot;Another Side of Bob Dylan&quot; (1964) by &quot;Bob Dylan&quot; with &quot;Motorpsycho Nitemare&quot;, &quot;Funplex&quot; (2008) by the B-52&#x27;s with the song &quot;Juliet of the Spirits&quot;, and in the opening traffic jam of the music video &quot;Everybody Hurts&quot; by R.E.M. American singer Lana Del Rey has cited Fellini as an influence. His work influenced the American TV shows &quot;Northern Exposure&quot; and &quot;Third Rock from the Sun&quot;. Wes Anderson&#x27;s short film &quot;Castello Cavalcanti&quot; (2013) is in many places a direct homage to Fellini. In 1996, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; ranked Fellini tenth on its &quot;50 Greatest Directors&quot; list. In 2002 MovieMaker magazine ranked Fellini No. 9 on their list of &quot;The 25 Most Influential Directors of All Time&quot;. In 2007, &quot;Total Film&quot; magazine ranked Fellini at No. 67 on its &quot;100 Greatest Film Directors Ever&quot; list.

Various film-related material and personal papers of Fellini are in the Wesleyan University Cinema Archives, to which scholars and media experts have full access. In October 2009, the Jeu de Paume in Paris opened an exhibit devoted to Fellini that included ephemera, television interviews, behind-the-scenes photographs, &quot;The Book of Dreams&quot; (based on 30 years of the director&#x27;s illustrated dreams and notes), along with excerpts from &quot;La dolce vita&quot; and &quot;&quot;.

In 2014 the weekly entertainment-trade magazine &quot;Variety&quot; announced that French director Sylvain Chomet was moving forward with &quot;The Thousand Miles&quot;, a project based on various Fellini works, including his unpublished drawings and writings.

Also in 2014, the Blue Devils Drum and Bugle Corps performed their program &quot;Felliniesque&quot;, a show inspired by the works and life of Fellini. This show would go on to earn the gold medal at the Drum Corps International 2014 world championships, and as of 2024 is the highest scoring show in Drum corps history with a score of 99.650.

The Fellini Museum, which showcases his films and collection, was inaugurated in Rimini in August 2021.

<doc id="11787" wikidata="Q106648" url="?curid=11787" title="Fleetwood Mac">
<text>Fleetwood Mac are a British-American rock band formed in London in 1967 by guitarist and singer Peter Green. Green named the band by combining the surnames of drummer Mick Fleetwood and bassist John McVie, who have remained with the band throughout its many line-up changes. Fleetwood Mac have sold more than 120 million records worldwide, making them one of the world&#x27;s best-selling bands.

Primarily a British blues band in their early years, Fleetwood Mac achieved a UK number-one single in 1968 with the instrumental &quot;Albatross&quot; and had other UK top ten hits with &quot;Man of the World&quot;, &quot;Oh Well&quot; (both 1969), and &quot;The Green Manalishi (With the Two Prong Crown)&quot; (1970). Green left the band in May 1970, with McVie&#x27;s wife Christine McVie (who had previously contributed to the band as a session musician) joining as an official member on vocals and keyboards two months later. Other key members during the band&#x27;s early years were Jeremy Spencer, Danny Kirwan, and Bob Welch. By the end of 1974, these members had departed, which left the band without a guitarist and male vocalist. While Fleetwood was scouting studios in Los Angeles, he heard the American folk rock duo Buckingham Nicks, consisting of guitarist and singer Lindsey Buckingham and singer Stevie Nicks. In December 1974, he asked Buckingham to join Fleetwood Mac, with Buckingham agreeing on the condition that Nicks could also join. The addition of Buckingham and Nicks gave the band a more pop rock sound, and their 1975 album &quot;Fleetwood Mac&quot; topped the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart in the United States. Their next album, &quot;Rumours&quot; (1977) reached number one in multiple countries around the world and won the Grammy Award for Album of the Year in 1978.

The line-up remained stable through three more studio albums, but by the late 1980s began to disintegrate. After Buckingham left in 1987, he was replaced by Billy Burnette and Rick Vito, although Vito left in 1990 along with Nicks. A 1993 one-off performance for the first inauguration of President Bill Clinton reunited the classic 1974‚Äì1987 line-up for the first time in six years. A full-scale reunion took place four years later, and Fleetwood Mac released their fourth U.S. No. 1 album, &quot;The Dance&quot; (1997), a live album marking the 20th anniversary of &quot;Rumours&quot; and the band&#x27;s 30th anniversary. Christine McVie left in 1998 after the completion of The Dance Tour. Fleetwood Mac released their final studio album, &quot;Say You Will&quot;, in 2003. Christine McVie rejoined in 2014 for their On With the Show Tour. In 2018, Buckingham was fired and replaced by Mike Campbell, formerly of Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, and Neil Finn of Split Enz and Crowded House. After Christine McVie&#x27;s death in 2022, Nicks said in 2024 that the band would not continue without her.

In 1979, Fleetwood Mac were honoured with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. In 1998, they were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and received the Brit Award for Outstanding Contribution to Music. In 2018, Fleetwood Mac received the MusiCares Person of the Year award from the Recording Academy in recognition of their artistic achievement in the music industry and dedication to philanthropy.

==History==
===1967‚Äì1970: Formation and early years===

Fleetwood Mac were formed in July 1967 in London, England, by Peter Green after he left the British blues band John Mayall &amp; the Bluesbreakers. Green had previously replaced guitarist Eric Clapton in the Bluesbreakers and had received critical acclaim for his work on their album &quot;A Hard Road&quot;. Green had been in two bands with Mick Fleetwood, Peter B&#x27;s Looners and the subsequent Shotgun Express (which featured a young Rod Stewart as vocalist), and suggested Fleetwood as a replacement for drummer Aynsley Dunbar when Dunbar left the Bluesbreakers to join the Jeff Beck Group. John Mayall agreed and Fleetwood joined the Bluesbreakers.
The Bluesbreakers then consisted of Green, Fleetwood, John McVie and Mayall. Mayall gave Green free recording time as a gift, which Fleetwood, McVie and Green used to record five songs. The fifth song was an instrumental that Green named after the rhythm section, &quot;Fleetwood Mac&quot; (&quot;Mac&quot; being short for McVie).
Soon after this, Green suggested to Fleetwood that they form a new band. The pair wanted McVie on bass guitar and named the band &quot;Fleetwood Mac&quot; to entice him, but McVie opted to keep his steady income with Mayall rather than take a risk with a new band. In the meantime, Green and Fleetwood teamed up with slide guitarist Jeremy Spencer and bassist Bob Brunning. Brunning was in the band on the understanding that he would leave if McVie agreed to join. The band made its debut on Sunday 13 August 1967 at the National Jazz and Blues Festival (a forerunner of the Reading Festival), billed as &quot;Peter Green&#x27;s Fleetwood Mac featuring Jeremy Spencer&quot;. Brunning played only a few gigs with Fleetwood Mac. Within a few weeks of their first show, John McVie agreed to join the band as permanent bassist.
Fleetwood Mac&#x27;s self-titled debut album was released by the Blue Horizon label in February 1968. The song &quot;Long Grey Mare&quot; was recorded earlier with Brunning on bass, while the rest of the album was recorded with McVie. The album was successful in the UK and reached no. 4, although no tracks were released as singles. Later in the year, the singles &quot;Black Magic Woman&quot; (later a big hit when covered by Santana) and &quot;Need Your Love So Bad&quot; were released, both going top-forty in the UK.

The band&#x27;s second studio album, &quot;Mr. Wonderful&quot;, was released in August 1968. The album was recorded live in the studio with miked amplifiers and a PA system, rather than being plugged into the board. The sessions featured a horn section as well as friend of the band, Christine Perfect of Chicken Shack, on keyboards. Later that year, Chicken Shack would score a British hit with a cover of the Etta James classic &quot;I&#x27;d Rather Go Blind&quot;, with Perfect on lead vocal. Perfect was voted female artist of the year by &quot;Melody Maker&quot; in 1969 and 1970.
Shortly after the release of &quot;Mr. Wonderful&quot;, 18-year-old guitarist Danny Kirwan joined the band, making Fleetwood Mac a five-piece band with three guitarists. Kirwan was in the South London blues trio Boilerhouse with Trevor Stevens (bass) and Dave Terrey (drums). Green and Fleetwood had watched Boilerhouse rehearse in a basement boiler-room, and Green had been so impressed that he invited the band to play support slots for Fleetwood Mac. Green wanted Boilerhouse to become a professional band, but Stevens and Terrey were not prepared to turn professional, so Green tried to find another rhythm section for Kirwan by placing an ad in &quot;Melody Maker&quot;. There were over 300 applicants, but when Green and Fleetwood ran auditions at the Nag&#x27;s Head in Battersea (home of the Mike Vernon&#x27;s Blue Horizon Club) the hard-to-please Green could not find anyone good enough. Instead, Fleetwood invited Kirwan to join Fleetwood Mac as a third guitarist.

Green was frustrated that Jeremy Spencer did not contribute to his songs. Kirwan, a talented self-taught guitarist, had a signature vibrato and a unique style that added a new dimension to the band&#x27;s sound. In November 1968, with Kirwan in the band, they released their first number-one single in Europe, &quot;Albatross&quot;, an instrumental with lead guitar by both Green and Kirwan. Green said later that the success of &quot;Albatross&quot; was thanks to Kirwan: &quot;If it wasn&#x27;t for Danny, I would never have had a number one hit record.&quot; In January 1969, they released their first compilation album &quot;English Rose&quot;, which contained half of &quot;Mr. Wonderful&quot; plus new songs from Kirwan. Their next and more successful compilation album &quot;The Pious Bird of Good Omen&quot; was released in August and contained various singles, B-sides and tracks the band had recorded as back-up for Eddie Boyd.

On tour in the US in January 1969, the band recorded &quot;Fleetwood Mac in Chicago&quot; (released in December as a double album) at the soon-to-close Chess Records Studio with some of the blues legends of Chicago, including Willie Dixon, Buddy Guy and Otis Spann. These were Fleetwood Mac&#x27;s last all-blues recordings, with the band moving more towards rock. Along with the change of style, the band was also going through label changes. Until that point, they had been on the Blue Horizon label, but with Kirwan in the band the musical possibilities had become too diverse for a blues-only label. The band signed with Immediate Records and released the single &quot;Man of the World&quot;, which became another British and European hit. For the B-side, Spencer fronted Fleetwood Mac as &quot;Earl Vince and the Valiants&quot; and recorded &quot;Somebody&#x27;s Gonna Get Their Head Kicked In Tonite&quot;, typifying the more raucous rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll side of the band. Immediate Records was in bad shape however, so the band shopped around for a new deal. The Beatles wanted the band on Apple Records (Mick Fleetwood and George Harrison were brothers-in-law), but the band&#x27;s manager Clifford Davis decided to go with Warner Bros. Records (through Reprise Records, a Frank Sinatra-founded label), the label they have stayed with ever since.

Under the wing of Reprise, Fleetwood Mac released their third studio album, &quot;Then Play On&quot;, in September 1969. Although the initial pressing of the American release of this album was the same as the British version, it was altered to contain the song &quot;Oh Well&quot;, which featured consistently in live performances from the time of its release through 1997 and again starting in 2009. &quot;Then Play On&quot;, which saw the band broaden their style away from straight blues, was written by Kirwan and Green, plus a track each by Fleetwood and McVie. Jeremy Spencer, meanwhile, had recorded a solo album of 1950s-style rock and roll songs, backed by the rest of the band except Green.

By 1969, Green was using LSD. During a European tour towards the end of that year, he experienced a bad acid trip at a hippie commune in Munich. Clifford Davis, the band&#x27;s manager, singled out this incident as the crucial point in Green&#x27;s mental decline. He said: &quot;The truth about Peter Green and how he ended up how he did is very simple. We were touring Europe in late 1969. When we were in Germany, Peter told me he had been invited to a party. I knew there were going to be a lot of drugs around and I suggested that he didn&#x27;t go. But he went anyway and I understand from him that he took what turned out to be very bad, impure LSD. He was never the same again.&quot; German author and filmmaker Rainer Langhans stated in his autobiography that he and his then-girlfriend, model Uschi Obermaier, met Green in Munich and invited him to their Highfisch-Kommune, where the drinks were spiked with acid. Langhans and Obermaier were planning to organise an open-air &quot;Bavarian Woodstock&quot;, for which they wanted Jimi Hendrix and The Rolling Stones to be the main acts. Already in contact with Hendrix, they hoped Green would help them to get in contact with The Rolling Stones.

Green&#x27;s last studio recording with Fleetwood Mac was &quot;The Green Manalishi (With the Two Prong Crown)&quot; and its B-side, &quot;World in Harmony&quot;. The tracks were recorded at Warner-Reprise&#x27;s studios in Hollywood on the band&#x27;s third US tour in April 1970, a few weeks before Green left the band. Released as a single the following month, it made No. 10 in the UK. Prior to its studio recording, the band had played the song live at the Boston Tea Party in February 1970. Some recordings of the three Boston Tea Party gigs (5‚Äì7 February 1970) were eventually released in the 1980s as the &quot;Live in Boston&quot; album. A more complete remastered three-volume compilation of these shows was released by Snapper Music in the late 1990s. &quot;Green Manalishi&quot; was released as Green&#x27;s mental stability deteriorated. He wanted the band to give all their money to charity, but the other members of the band disagreed. In April 1970, Green decided to quit the band after the completion of their European tour. His last show with Fleetwood Mac was on 20 May 1970.

===1970‚Äì1973: Transitional era===
The remaining four members, Fleetwood, McVie, Spencer and Kirwan, set about working on their next album. In September 1970, Fleetwood Mac released their fourth studio album, &quot;Kiln House&quot;, to generally positive reviews. Kirwan&#x27;s songs on the album moved the band in a melodic rock direction, while Spencer&#x27;s contributions focused on re-creating the country-tinged &quot;Sun Sound&quot; of the late 1950s. Christine Perfect, now Christine McVie following her marriage to John McVie, had retired from the music business after one unsuccessful solo album, though she contributed (uncredited) to &quot;Kiln House&quot;, singing backup vocals and playing keyboards. She also drew the album cover. After &quot;Kiln House&quot;, Fleetwood Mac were progressing and developing a new sound, and she was invited to join the band to help fill in the rhythm section. The first time she had played live with the band had been a guest appearance at Bristol University, England, in May 1969, just as she was leaving Chicken Shack, while her first gig as an official member of the band was on 1 August 1970 in New Orleans, Louisiana. In early 1971, the band released a non-album single, Danny Kirwan&#x27;s &quot;Dragonfly&quot; b/w &quot;The Purple Dancer&quot; in the UK and certain European countries, but despite good notices in the press, it was not a success. In 1971, CBS Records, which now owned Fleetwood Mac&#x27;s original record company Blue Horizon (except in the US and Canada), released the band&#x27;s third compilation album, &quot;The Original Fleetwood Mac&quot;, containing previously unreleased material from 1967 and 1968.

While on a US tour in February 1971, Jeremy Spencer said he was going out to &quot;get a magazine&quot; but never returned. After several days of frantic searching, the band discovered that Spencer had joined a religious group, the Children of God. The band were liable for the remaining shows on the tour and asked Peter Green to step in as a replacement. Green brought along his friend Nigel Watson, who played the congas (twenty-five years later Green and Watson collaborated again to form the Peter Green Splinter Group), and insisted on playing only new material and none he had written. Green and Watson played the last week of the tour, with a show in San Bernardino on 20 February 1971 being recorded. Green did not want to re-join the band permanently and a search for a guitarist to replace Spencer began after the tour was completed.

In the summer of 1971, the band held auditions for a replacement guitarist at their large country home, &quot;Benifold&quot;, which they had jointly bought with their manager Davis for ¬£23,000 () prior to the &quot;Kiln House&quot; tour. A friend of the band, Judy Wong, recommended her high school friend Bob Welch, who was living in Paris, France, at the time. The band held a few meetings with Welch and decided to hire him, without actually playing with him, after they heard a tape of his songs.

In September 1971, the band released their fifth studio album, &quot;Future Games&quot;. As a result of Welch&#x27;s arrival and Spencer&#x27;s departure, the album was different from anything they had done previously, with the band moving further away from their blues rock roots towards a more melodic rock style, and vocal harmonies starting to become a key part of their sound. While it became the band&#x27;s first studio album to miss the charts in the UK, it helped to expand the band&#x27;s appeal in the United States. In Europe, CBS released Fleetwood Mac&#x27;s first &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; album in late 1971.

In 1972, six months after the release of &quot;Future Games&quot;, the band released their sixth studio album, &quot;Bare Trees&quot;. Mostly composed by Kirwan, &quot;Bare Trees&quot; featured the Welch-penned single &quot;Sentimental Lady&quot;, which would be a much bigger hit for Welch five years later when he re-recorded it for his solo album &quot;French Kiss&quot;, backed by Mick Fleetwood and Christine McVie. &quot;Bare Trees&quot; also featured &quot;Spare Me a Little of Your Love&quot;, a Christine McVie song that became a staple of the band&#x27;s live act throughout the early to mid-1970s.

While the band was doing well in the studio, their tours started to be problematic. By 1972, Kirwan had developed an alcohol dependency and was becoming alienated from Welch and the McVies. In August 1972, before a concert on a US tour, Kirwan smashed his Gibson Les Paul Custom guitar and refused to go on stage. The band played the show as a quartet, after which Kirwan criticised their performance, and he was subsequently fired from the band. Fleetwood said later that the pressure had become too much for Kirwan, and he had suffered a breakdown.

Following Kirwan&#x27;s departure, the band recruited guitarist Bob Weston and vocalist Dave Walker, the latter formerly of Savoy Brown and Idle Race. Bob Weston was well known as a slide guitarist and had known the band from his touring period with Long John Baldry. Fleetwood Mac also hired Savoy Brown&#x27;s road manager, John Courage. Fleetwood, the McVies, Welch, Weston and Walker recorded the band&#x27;s seventh studio album, &quot;Penguin&quot;, which was released in January 1973. After the subsequent tour the band fired Walker because they felt his vocal and performance style did not fit well with the rest of the band.
The remaining five members carried on and recorded the band&#x27;s eighth studio album, &quot;Mystery to Me&quot;, six months later. This album contained Welch&#x27;s song &quot;Hypnotized&quot;, which received airplay on the radio. While &quot;Mystery to Me&quot; eventually received a Gold certification from the RIAA, personal problems within the band emerged. The McVies&#x27; marriage was under a lot of stress, which was aggravated by their constant working with each other and by John McVie&#x27;s considerable alcohol abuse.

In 1973, Weston had an affair with Fleetwood&#x27;s wife Jenny Boyd, sister of George Harrison&#x27;s first wife Pattie Boyd. Fleetwood found out two weeks into a US tour. His devastation led to the band firing Weston and cancelling the remaining 26 dates of the tour. The last date played was Lincoln, Nebraska, on 20 October 1973. In a late-night meeting after that show, the band told their sound engineer that the tour was over and Fleetwood Mac was splitting up.

===1973‚Äì1974: Name dispute and &quot;fake Fleetwood Mac&quot;===
In late 1973, after the collapse of the US tour, the band&#x27;s manager, Clifford Davis, was left with major touring commitments to fulfill and no band. Fleetwood Mac had &quot;temporarily disbanded&quot; in Nebraska and its members had gone their separate ways. Davis was concerned that failing to complete the tour would destroy his reputation with bookers and promoters. He sent the band a letter in which he said he &quot;hadn&#x27;t slaved for years to be brought down by the whims of irresponsible musicians&quot;. Davis claimed that he owned the name &#x27;Fleetwood Mac&#x27; and the right to choose the band members. He recruited members of the band Legs, which had recently issued one single under Davis&#x27;s management, to tour the US in early 1974 under the name &quot;The New Fleetwood Mac&quot; and perform the rescheduled dates. This band‚Äîwho former vocalist Dave Walker said were &quot;very good&quot;‚Äîconsisted of Elmer Gantry (Dave Terry, formerly of Velvet Opera: vocals, guitar), Kirby Gregory (formerly of Curved Air: guitar), Paul Martinez (formerly of the Downliners Sect: bass), John Wilkinson (also known as Dave Wilkinson: keyboards) and Australian drummer Craig Collinge (formerly of Manfred Mann Chapter Three, The Librettos, Procession and Third World War). The members of this group were told that Mick Fleetwood would join them on the tour to validate the use of the name. Fleetwood said later that he had not agreed to be part of the tour.

The &quot;New Fleetwood Mac&quot; tour began on 16 January 1974 at the Syria Mosque in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and was initially successful. One of the band members said the first concert &quot;went down a storm&quot;. The promoter was dubious at first but said later that the crowd had loved the band and they were &quot;actually really good&quot;. More successful gigs followed, but then word got around that this was not the real Fleetwood Mac and audiences became hostile. The band was turned away from several gigs and the next six shows were pulled by promoters. The band struggled on and played further dates in the face of increasing hostility and heckling. More dates were pulled, the keyboard player quit, and after a concert in Edmonton where bottles were thrown at the stage, the tour collapsed. The band dissolved and the remainder of the tour was cancelled.

The lawsuit that followed regarding who owned the rights to the name &quot;Fleetwood Mac&quot; put the real Fleetwood Mac on hiatus for almost a year. Although the band was named after Mick Fleetwood and John McVie, they had apparently signed contracts in which they had forfeited the rights to the name. Their record company, Warner Bros. Records, when appealed to, said they did not know who owned it. The dispute was eventually settled out of court, four years later, in what was described as &quot;a reasonable settlement not unfair to either party&quot;. In later years Fleetwood said that, in the end, he was grateful to Davis because the lawsuit was the reason the band moved to California.

Nobody from the alternative line-up was ever made a part of the real Fleetwood Mac, although some of them later played in Danny Kirwan&#x27;s studio band. Gantry and Gregory went on to become members of Stretch, whose 1975 UK hit single &quot;Why Did You Do It?&quot; was written about the touring debacle. Gantry later collaborated with the Alan Parsons Project. Martinez went on to play with the Deep Purple offshoot Paice Ashton Lord, as well as Robert Plant&#x27;s backing band.

===1974: Return of the authentic Fleetwood Mac===
While the fake Fleetwood Mac were on tour, Welch stayed in Los Angeles and connected with entertainment attorneys. He realised that Fleetwood Mac was being neglected by Warner Bros and that they would need to change their base of operation from England to America, to which the rest of the band agreed. The presence of a false Fleetwood Mac had also confused matters. Rock promoter Bill Graham wrote a letter to Warner Bros to convince them that the real Fleetwood Mac was Mick Fleetwood, John McVie, Christine McVie, and Bob Welch. This did not end the legal battle, but the band was able to record as Fleetwood Mac again. Instead of hiring another manager, Fleetwood Mac, having re-formed, became the only major rock band managed by the artists themselves.

In September 1974, Fleetwood Mac signed a new recording contract with Warner Bros, but remained on the Reprise label. In the same month, the band released their ninth studio album, &quot;Heroes Are Hard to Find&quot;. This was the first time Fleetwood Mac had only one guitarist. While on tour, they briefly added a second keyboardist, Doug Graves, who had been an engineer on &quot;Heroes Are Hard to Find&quot;. In 1980, Christine McVie said Graves had been there to back her up, but after the first two or three concerts it was decided that she was better off without him: &quot;The band wanted me to expand my role and have a little more freedom, but he didn&#x27;t play the same way I did.&quot; Keyboard player Robert (&quot;Bobby&quot;) Hunt, who had been in the band Head West with Bob Welch in 1970, replaced Graves for the remaining dates on the tour but was not invited to join the band full time. By the time the tour ended (on 5 December 1974 at Cal State University), the &quot;Heroes&quot; album had reached a higher position on the American charts than any of the band&#x27;s previous records.

===1974‚Äì1987: Addition of Buckingham and Nicks, and global success===

In Bob Welch&#x27;s words, following the &quot;Heroes are Hard to Find&quot; tour, &quot;the buzz that the &quot;Mystery to Me&quot; band had started to create...[was] gone. I [was] totally exhausted by writing, singing, touring, negotiating, moving, and frankly so [were] Mick, John and Chris. We were &quot;all&quot; discouraged that &quot;Heroes&quot; [hadn&#x27;t] done better. Something needs to change, but what? ‚Ä¶ There was also a kind of fatigue, anger and bitterness that all the work we had done hadn&#x27;t really paid off and we were just all sort of shaking our heads saying &#x27;what do we do now&#x27; ‚Ä¶ Everybody knew that we had to find some new creative juice.&quot; Welch himself had grown tired of the constant struggles to keep Fleetwood Mac functioning and was openly considering leaving the band.

Whilst Fleetwood was checking out Sound City Studios in Los Angeles during the autumn of 1974, the house engineer, Keith Olsen, played him a track he had recorded, &quot;Frozen Love&quot;, from the album &quot;Buckingham Nicks&quot; (1973). Fleetwood liked it and was introduced to the guitarist from the band, Lindsey Buckingham, who was at Sound City that day recording demos. Fleetwood asked him to join Fleetwood Mac, and Buckingham agreed, on the condition that his music partner and girlfriend, Stevie Nicks, be included. Welch considered remaining as part of this extended lineup but opted to depart for a solo career. Buckingham and Nicks joined the band on New Year&#x27;s Eve 1974.

In 1975, the new line-up released their first album together, the self-titled &quot;Fleetwood Mac&quot;, the band&#x27;s tenth studio album overall. The album was a breakthrough for the band and became a huge hit, reaching No. 1 in the US and selling over 7 million copies. Among the hit singles from this album were Christine McVie&#x27;s &quot;Over My Head&quot; and &quot;Say You Love Me&quot; and Stevie Nicks&#x27; &quot;Rhiannon&quot;, as well as the much-played album track &quot;Landslide&quot;, a live rendition of which became a hit twenty years later on &quot;The Dance&quot; album.
In 1976, the band was suffering from severe stress. With success came the end of John and Christine McVie&#x27;s marriage, as well as Buckingham and Nicks&#x27;s long-term romantic relationship. Fleetwood, meanwhile, was in the midst of divorce proceedings from his wife, Jenny, and had also begun an affair with Nicks. The pressure on Fleetwood Mac to release a successful follow-up album, combined with their new-found wealth, led to creative and personal tensions which were allegedly fuelled by high consumption of drugs and alcohol.
The band&#x27;s eleventh studio album, &quot;Rumours&quot; (the band&#x27;s first release on the main Warner label after Reprise was retired and all of its acts were reassigned to the parent label), was released in February 1977. In this album, the band members laid bare the emotional turmoil they were experiencing at the time. &quot;Rumours&quot; was critically acclaimed and won the Grammy Award for Album of the Year in 1977. The album generated four top-ten singles: Buckingham&#x27;s &quot;Go Your Own Way&quot;, Nicks&#x27; US No. 1 &quot;Dreams&quot;, and Christine McVie&#x27;s &quot;Don&#x27;t Stop&quot; and &quot;You Make Loving Fun&quot;. Buckingham&#x27;s &quot;Second Hand News&quot;, Nicks&#x27; &quot;Gold Dust Woman&quot;, and &quot;The Chain&quot; (the only song written by all five band members) also received significant radio airplay. By 2003, &quot;Rumours&quot; had sold over 19 million copies in the US alone (certified as a diamond album by the RIAA) and a total of 40 million copies worldwide, bringing it to eighth on the list of best-selling albums. Fleetwood Mac supported the album with a lucrative tour.

On 10 October 1979, Fleetwood Mac were honoured for their contributions to the music industry with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6608 Hollywood Boulevard.

Buckingham convinced Fleetwood to let his work on their next album be more experimental and to be allowed to work on tracks at home before bringing them to the rest of the band in the studio. The result of this, the band&#x27;s twelfth studio album &quot;Tusk&quot;, was a 20-track double album released in 1979. It produced three hit singles: Buckingham&#x27;s &quot;Tusk&quot; (US No. 8), which featured the USC Trojan Marching Band; Christine McVie&#x27;s &quot;Think About Me&quot; (US No. 20); and Nicks&#x27; six-and-a-half minute opus &quot;Sara&quot; (US No. 7). &quot;Sara&quot; was cut to four-and-a-half minutes for both the single and the first CD release of the album in the 1980s, but the full version has since been restored on the 1988 &quot;Greatest Hits&quot;, the 1992 &quot;25 Years ‚Äì The Chain&quot; box set, 2002&#x27;s &quot;The Very Best of Fleetwood Mac&quot;, and the 2004 remaster of &quot;Tusk&quot;. Original guitarist Peter Green also took part in the sessions of &quot;Tusk&quot;, although his playing on the Christine McVie track &quot;Brown Eyes&quot;, is not credited on the album. In an interview in 2019, Fleetwood described &quot;Tusk&quot; as his &quot;personal favourite&quot; and said, &quot;Kudos to Lindsey ‚Ä¶ for us not doing a replica of &quot;Rumours&quot;.&quot;

&quot;Tusk&quot; sold four million copies worldwide. Fleetwood blamed the album&#x27;s relative lack of commercial success on the RKO radio chain having played the album in its entirety prior to release, thereby allowing mass home taping.

The band embarked on an 11-month tour to support and promote &quot;Tusk&quot;. They travelled around the world, including the US, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, France, Belgium, Germany, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom. In Germany, they shared the bill with reggae musician Bob Marley. On this world tour, the band recorded music for their first live album, which was released at the end of 1980.

The band&#x27;s thirteenth studio album, &quot;Mirage&quot;, was released in 1982. Following 1981 solo albums by Nicks (&quot;Bella Donna&quot;), Fleetwood (&quot;The Visitor&quot;), and Buckingham (&quot;Law and Order&quot;), there was a return to a more conventional approach. Buckingham had been chided by critics, fellow band members, and music business managers for the lesser commercial success of &quot;Tusk&quot;. Recorded at Ch√¢teau d&#x27;H√©rouville in France and produced by Richard Dashut, &quot;Mirage&quot; was an attempt to recapture the huge success of &quot;Rumours&quot;. Its hits included Christine McVie&#x27;s &quot;Hold Me&quot; and &quot;Love in Store&quot; (co-written by Robbie Patton and Jim Recor, respectively), Nicks&#x27; &quot;Gypsy&quot;, and Buckingham&#x27;s &quot;Oh Diane&quot;, which made the Top 10 in the UK. A minor hit was also scored by Buckingham&#x27;s &quot;Can&#x27;t Go Back&quot;.

In contrast to the Tusk Tour, the band embarked on only a short tour of 18 American cities, with the Los Angeles show being recorded and released on video. They also headlined the first US Festival, on 5 September 1982, for which the band was paid $500,000 (equivalent to $ in 2024). &quot;Mirage&quot; was certified double platinum in the US.

Following &quot;Mirage&quot; the band went on hiatus, which allowed members to pursue solo careers. Nicks released two more solo albums (1983&#x27;s &quot;The Wild Heart&quot; and 1985&#x27;s &quot;Rock a Little&quot;). Buckingham issued &quot;Go Insane&quot; in 1984, the same year that Christine McVie made an eponymous album (yielding the Top 10 hit &quot;Got a Hold on Me&quot; and the Top 40 hit &quot;Love Will Show Us How&quot;). All three became successful in their solo efforts, with Nicks being the most popular. During this period, Fleetwood had filed for bankruptcy, Nicks was admitted to the Betty Ford Clinic for addiction problems, and John McVie had suffered an addiction-related seizure ‚Äì all of which were attributed to the lifestyle of excess afforded to them by their worldwide success. It was rumoured that Fleetwood Mac had disbanded, but Buckingham commented that he was unhappy at allowing &quot;Mirage&quot; to remain the band&#x27;s last effort.

The lineup featuring Fleetwood, the McVies, Buckingham, and Nicks recorded one more album, their fourteenth studio album, &quot;Tango in the Night&quot;, in 1987. The recording started off as a Buckingham solo album before becoming a full group project. The album went on to become their best-selling release since &quot;Rumours&quot;, especially in the UK where it hit No. 1 three times in the following year. The album sold three million copies in the US and contained four hits: Christine McVie&#x27;s &quot;Little Lies&quot; and &quot;Everywhere&quot; (&quot;Little Lies&quot; being co-written with her new husband, Eddy Quintela), Sandy Stewart and Nicks&#x27; &quot;Seven Wonders&quot;, and Buckingham&#x27;s &quot;Big Love&quot;. &quot;Family Man&quot; (Buckingham and Richard Dashut) and &quot;Isn&#x27;t It Midnight&quot; (Christine McVie) were also released as singles.

===1987‚Äì1995: Departures of Buckingham and Nicks===
With a ten-week tour scheduled, Buckingham held back at the last minute, saying he felt his creativity was being stifled. A group meeting at Christine McVie&#x27;s house on 7 August 1987 resulted in turmoil. Tensions were coming to a head. Fleetwood said in his autobiography that there was a physical altercation between Buckingham and Nicks. Buckingham left the band the following day. After Buckingham&#x27;s departure, Fleetwood Mac added two new guitarists to the band, Billy Burnette and Rick Vito, again without auditions.

Burnette was the son of Dorsey Burnette and nephew of Johnny Burnette, both of The Rock and Roll Trio. He had already worked with Fleetwood in Zoo, with Christine McVie as part of her solo band, had done some session work with Nicks, and backed Buckingham on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;. Fleetwood and Christine McVie had played on his &quot;Try Me&quot; album in 1985. Vito, a Peter Green admirer, had played with many artists from Bonnie Raitt to John Mayall, to Roger McGuinn in Thunderbyrd and worked with John McVie on two Mayall albums.

The 1987‚Äì88 &quot;Shake the Cage&quot; tour was the first outing for this line-up. It was successful enough to warrant the release of a concert video, also titled &quot;Tango in the Night&quot;, which was filmed at San Francisco&#x27;s Cow Palace arena in December 1987.

Capitalising on the success of the &quot;Tango in the Night&quot; album, the band released a &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; album in 1988. It featured singles from the 1975‚Äì1988 era and included two new compositions, &quot;No Questions Asked&quot; written by Nicks and Kelly Johnston, and &quot;As Long as You Follow&quot;, written by Christine McVie and Quintela. &#x27;As Long as You Follow&#x27; was released as a single in 1988 but only made No. 43 in the US and No. 66 in the UK, although it reached No.1 on the US Adult Contemporary charts. The &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; album, which peaked at No. 3 in the UK and No. 14 in the US (though it has since sold over 8 million copies there) was dedicated by the band to Buckingham, with whom they were now reconciled.

In 1990, Fleetwood Mac released their fifteenth studio album, &quot;Behind the Mask&quot;. With this album, the band veered away from the stylised sound that Buckingham had evolved during his tenure (which was also evident in his solo work) and developed a more adult contemporary style with producer Greg Ladanyi. The album yielded only one Top 40 hit, Christine McVie&#x27;s &quot;Save Me&quot;. &quot;Behind the Mask&quot; only achieved Gold album status in the US, peaking at No. 18 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; album chart, though it entered the UK Albums Chart at No. 1. It received mixed reviews and was seen by some music critics as a low point for the band in the absence of Buckingham (who had actually made a guest appearance playing on the title track). But &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine said that Vito and Burnette were &quot;the best thing to ever happen to Fleetwood Mac&quot;. The subsequent &quot;Behind the Mask&quot; tour saw the band play sold-out shows at London&#x27;s Wembley Stadium. In the final show in Los Angeles, Buckingham joined the band onstage. The two women of the band, McVie and Nicks, had decided that the tour would be their last (McVie&#x27;s father had died during the tour), although both stated that they would still record with the band. In 1991, however, Nicks and Rick Vito left Fleetwood Mac altogether.

In 1992, Fleetwood arranged a 4-CD box set, spanning highlights from the band&#x27;s 25-year history, entitled &quot;25 Years ‚Äì The Chain&quot; (a cut-down 2-CD box set, &quot;Selections from 25 Years ‚Äì The Chain&quot;, was also released). A notable inclusion in the box set was &quot;Silver Springs&quot;, a Nicks composition that was recorded during the &quot;Rumours&quot; sessions but was omitted from the album and used as the B-side of &quot;Go Your Own Way&quot;. Nicks had requested use of this track for her 1991 best-of compilation &quot;TimeSpace&quot;, but Fleetwood had refused as he had planned to include it in this collection as a rarity. The disagreement between Nicks and Fleetwood garnered press coverage and was believed to have been the main reason for Nicks leaving the band in 1991. The box set also included a new Nicks/Vito composition, &quot;Paper Doll&quot;, which was released in the US as a single and produced by Buckingham and Richard Dashut. There were also two new Christine McVie compositions, &quot;Heart of Stone&quot; and &quot;Love Shines&quot;. &quot;Love Shines&quot; was released as a single in the UK and elsewhere. Buckingham also contributed a new song, &quot;Make Me a Mask&quot;. Fleetwood also released a deluxe hardcover companion book to coincide with the release of the box set, titled &quot;My 25 Years in Fleetwood Mac&quot;. The volume featured notes written by Fleetwood detailing the band&#x27;s 25-year history and many rare photographs.

The classic 1974‚Äì1987 line-up reunited in 1993 at the request of US President Bill Clinton for his first Inaugural Ball. Clinton had made Fleetwood Mac&#x27;s &quot;Don&#x27;t Stop&quot; his campaign theme song. His request for it to be performed at the Inauguration Ball was met with enthusiasm by the band, although this line-up had no intention of reuniting permanently.

Inspired by the new interest in the band, Mick Fleetwood, John McVie, Christine McVie, and Billy Burnette recorded another album as Fleetwood Mac, with Bekka Bramlett, who had worked a year earlier with Fleetwood&#x27;s Zoo, joining the band. Solo singer-songwriter/guitarist and original Traffic member Dave Mason, who had worked with Bekka&#x27;s parents Delaney &amp; Bonnie twenty-five years earlier, was also added.

Although she remained an official band member and would be part of the next studio album, Christine McVie chose to take a break from touring around this time. The other five members (Fleetwood, J. McVie, Burnette, Bramlett and Mason) toured in 1994, opening for Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash, and in 1995 as part of a package with REO Speedwagon and Pat Benatar. This tour saw the band perform classic Fleetwood Mac songs spanning the band&#x27;s whole history to that point. In 1995, at a concert in Tokyo, the band was greeted by former member Jeremy Spencer, who performed a few songs with them.

On 10 October 1995, Fleetwood Mac released their sixteenth studio album, &quot;Time&quot;, which was not a success. Although it hit the UK Top 50 for one week, the album had zero impact in the US. It failed to graze the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top 200 albums chart, a reversal for a band that had been a mainstay on that chart for most of the previous two decades. Shortly after the album&#x27;s release, Christine McVie informed the band that the album would be her last. Bramlett and Burnette subsequently formed a country music duo, Bekka &amp; Billy.

=== 1995‚Äì2007: Reformation, reunion, and Christine McVie&#x27;s departure ===
Just weeks after disbanding Fleetwood Mac, Mick Fleetwood started working with Lindsey Buckingham again. John McVie was added to the sessions, and later Christine McVie. Stevie Nicks also enlisted Buckingham to produce a song for a soundtrack. In May 1996, Fleetwood, John McVie, Christine McVie, and Nicks performed together at a private party in Louisville, Kentucky, prior to the Kentucky Derby, with Steve Winwood filling in for Buckingham. A week later, the &quot;Twister&quot; film soundtrack was released, which featured the Nicks-Buckingham duet &quot;Twisted&quot;, with Fleetwood on drums. This eventually led to a full reunion of the &quot;Rumours&quot; line-up, which officially reformed in March 1997.

The regrouped Fleetwood Mac performed a live concert on a soundstage at Warner Bros. Burbank, California, on 22 May 1997. Buckingham said in an interview with &quot;Mojo magazine&quot; regarding the five of them coming together again that their &quot;chemistry was very present&quot;. The concert was recorded and filmed, and from this performance came the 1997 live album and video &quot;The Dance&quot;, which brought the band back to the top of the US album charts for the first time in ten years. In addition to live performances of their most notable songs, the album also featured new songs including &quot;Bleed to Love Her&quot; and &quot;Temporary One&quot;. The album was certified five million units by the RIAA. An arena tour followed the MTV premiere of &quot;The Dance&quot; video and kept the reunited Fleetwood Mac on the road throughout much of 1997, the 20th anniversary of &quot;Rumours&quot;. With additional musicians Neale Heywood on guitar, Brett Tuggle on keyboards, Lenny Castro on percussion and Sharon Celani (who had toured with the band in the late 1980s) and Mindy Stein on backing vocals, this would be the final appearance of the classic line-up including Christine McVie for 16 years. Neale Heywood and Sharon Celani remain touring members to this day.
In 1998 Fleetwood Mac were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Members inducted included the 1968‚Äì1970 band, Mick Fleetwood, John McVie, Peter Green, Jeremy Spencer, and Danny Kirwan, and &quot;Rumours&quot;-era members Christine McVie, Stevie Nicks, and Lindsey Buckingham. Bob Welch was not included, despite his key role in keeping the band alive during the early 1970s. The &quot;Rumours&quot;-era version of the band performed both at the induction ceremony and at the Grammy Awards programme that year. Peter Green attended the induction ceremony but did not perform with his former bandmates, opting instead to perform his composition &quot;Black Magic Woman&quot; with Santana, who were inducted the same night. Neither Jeremy Spencer nor Danny Kirwan attended. Fleetwood Mac also received the &quot;Outstanding Contribution to Music&quot; award at the Brit Awards (British Phonographic Industry Awards) the same year. Shortly after this, Christine McVie officially left the band.

2002 saw the release of &quot;The Very Best of Fleetwood Mac&quot;, issued as a 21-track single CD in the UK and a 40-track double CD in the US. Christine McVie&#x27;s departure left Buckingham and Nicks as the two singer-songwriters on the band&#x27;s seventeenth studio album, &quot;Say You Will&quot;, released in 2003 (although Christine contributed some backing vocals and keyboards as a guest). The album debuted at No.3 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart (No. 6 in the UK) and yielded chart hits with &quot;Peacekeeper&quot; and the title track, and a successful world arena tour which lasted through 2004. The tour grossed $27,711,129 and was ranked No. 21 in the top 25 grossing tours of 2004.

Around 2004‚Äì05 there were rumours of a reunion of the early line-up of Fleetwood Mac involving Peter Green and Jeremy Spencer. While these two apparently remained unconvinced, in April 2006 bassist John McVie, during a question-and-answer session on the &quot;Penguin&quot; Fleetwood Mac fan website, said of the reunion idea:

In interviews given in November 2006 to support his solo album &quot;Under the Skin&quot;, Buckingham stated that plans for the band to reunite once more for a 2008 tour were still in the cards. Recording plans had been put on hold for the foreseeable future. In an interview Nicks gave to the UK newspaper &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; in September 2007, she stated that she was unwilling to carry on with the band unless Christine McVie returned.

===2008‚Äì2013: Touring activity ===
In March 2008, it was mooted that Sheryl Crow might work with Fleetwood Mac in 2009. Crow and Stevie Nicks had collaborated in the past and Crow had stated that Nicks had been a great teacher and inspiration to her. Later, Buckingham said that the potential collaboration with Crow had &quot;lost its momentum&quot; and the idea was abandoned.
In March 2009, Fleetwood Mac started their &quot;Unleashed&quot; tour, again without Christine McVie. It was a greatest hits show, although album tracks such as &quot;Storms&quot; and &quot;I Know I&#x27;m Not Wrong&quot; were also played. During their show on 20 June 2009 in New Orleans, Louisiana, Stevie Nicks premiered part of a new song that she had written about Hurricane Katrina. The song was later released as &quot;New Orleans&quot; on Nicks&#x27;s 2011 album &quot;In Your Dreams&quot; with Mick Fleetwood on drums. In October 2009 and November, the band toured Europe, followed by Australia and New Zealand in December. In October, 2002&#x27;s &quot;The Very Best of Fleetwood Mac&quot; was re-released in the UK, this time using the US 2-CD track listing, entering at number six on the UK Albums Chart. On 1 November 2009 a one-hour documentary, &quot;Fleetwood Mac: Don&#x27;t Stop&quot;, was broadcast in the UK on BBC One, featuring recent interviews with all four current band members. During the documentary, Nicks gave a candid summary of the current state of her relationship with Buckingham, saying, &quot;Maybe when we&#x27;re 75 and Fleetwood Mac is a distant memory, we might be friends.&quot;

On 6 November 2009, Fleetwood Mac played the last show of the European leg of their &quot;Unleashed&quot; tour at London&#x27;s Wembley Arena. Christine McVie was in the audience. Nicks paid tribute to her from the stage to a standing ovation from the audience, saying that she thought about her former bandmate &quot;every day&quot;, and dedicated that night&#x27;s performance of &quot;Landslide&quot; to her. On 19 December 2009, Fleetwood Mac played the second-to-last show of their &quot;Unleashed&quot; tour to a sell-out crowd in New Zealand, at what was intended to be a one-off event at the TSB Bowl of Brooklands in New Plymouth. Tickets, after pre-sales, sold out within twelve minutes of public release. Another date, Sunday 20 December, was added and also sold out. The tour grossed $84,900,000 and was ranked No. 13 in the highest grossing worldwide tours of 2009. On 19 October 2010, Fleetwood Mac played a private show at the Phoenician Hotel in Scottsdale, Arizona for TPG (Texas Pacific Group).

On 3 May 2011, the Fox Network broadcast an episode of &quot;Glee&quot; entitled &quot;Rumours&quot; that featured six songs from the band&#x27;s 1977 album. The show sparked renewed interest in the band and its most commercially successful album, and &quot;Rumours&quot; re-entered the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart at No.11 in the same week that Nicks&#x27;s solo album &quot;In Your Dreams&quot; debuted at No.6. (She was quoted by &quot;Billboard&quot; saying that her new album was &quot;my own little &quot;Rumours&quot;.&quot;) The two recordings sold about 30,000 and 52,000 units respectively. Music downloads accounted for 91 per cent of the &quot;Rumours&quot; sales. The spike in sales for &quot;Rumours&quot; represented an increase of 1,951%. It was the highest chart entry by a previously issued album since &quot;The Rolling Stones&quot;&#x27; reissue of &quot;Exile On Main St.&quot; re-entered the chart at No. 2 on 5 June 2010. In an interview in July 2012 Nicks confirmed that the band would reunite for a tour in 2013.

Original Fleetwood Mac bassist Bob Brunning died on 18 October 2011 at the age of 68. Former guitarist and singer Bob Weston was found dead on 3 January 2012 at the age of 64. Former singer and guitarist Bob Welch was found dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound on 7 June 2012 at the age of 66. Don Aaron, a spokesman at the scene, stated, &quot;He died from an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound to the chest.&quot; A suicide note was found. Welch had been struggling with health issues and was dealing with depression. His wife discovered his body.

The band&#x27;s 2013 tour, which took place in 34 cities, started on 4 April in Columbus, Ohio. The band performed two new songs (&quot;Sad Angel&quot; and &quot;Without You&quot;), which Buckingham described as some of the most &quot;Fleetwood Mac-ey&quot;-sounding songs since &quot;Mirage&quot;. &quot;Without You&quot; was rerecorded from the Buckingham-Nicks era. The band released their first new studio material in ten years, &quot;Extended Play&quot;, on 30 April 2013. The EP debuted and peaked at No. 48 in the US and produced one single, &quot;Sad Angel&quot;.

On 25 and 27 September 2013, the second and third nights of the band&#x27;s London O2 shows, Christine McVie joined them on stage for &quot;Don&#x27;t Stop&quot;. &quot;[Buckingham&#x27;s] words to us were, &#x27;She can&#x27;t just come and go,&#x27;&quot; Nicks recalled. &quot;That&#x27;s important to him, but it&#x27;s not so important to me... Much as Lindsey adores her ‚Äì and he does; she&#x27;s the only one in Fleetwood Mac he was ever really willing to listen to ‚Äì he doesn&#x27;t want the first-night reviews to be all about Christine&#x27;s one song, rather than the set we rehearsed for two months. But it will be wonderful to have her back up there ‚Äì and, from there, who knows?&quot;

On 27 October 2013, the band cancelled their New Zealand and Australian performances after John McVie had been diagnosed with cancer so that he could undergo treatment. They said: &quot;We are sorry not to be able to play these Australian and New Zealand dates. We hope our Australian and New Zealand fans as well as Fleetwood Mac fans everywhere will join us in wishing John and his family all the best.&quot; Also in October 2013, Stevie Nicks appeared in &quot;American Horror Story: Coven&quot; with Fleetwood Mac&#x27;s song &quot;Seven Wonders&quot; playing in the background. In November 2013, Christine McVie expressed interest in a return to Fleetwood Mac, and also affirmed that John McVie&#x27;s prognosis was &quot;really good&quot;.

===2014‚Äìpresent: Final years===
On 11 January 2014, Mick Fleetwood confirmed that Christine McVie would be rejoining Fleetwood Mac. On with the Show, a 33-city North American tour, opened in Minneapolis, Minnesota, on 30 September 2014. A series of May‚ÄìJune 2015 arena dates in the United Kingdom went on sale on 14 November, selling out in minutes. High demand caused additional dates to be added to the tour, including an Australian leg.

In January 2015, Buckingham suggested that the new album and tour might be Fleetwood Mac&#x27;s last, and that the band would cease operations in 2015 or soon afterwards. He said work would continue on the new album, and solo work would be low priority for a few years. Fleetwood said the new album might take a few years to complete and that they were waiting for contributions from Nicks, who had been ambivalent about committing to a new record.

In August 2016, Fleetwood said that while the band had &quot;a huge amount of recorded music&quot;, virtually none of it featured Nicks. Buckingham and Christine McVie, however, had contributed many songs to the new project. Nicks explained her reluctance to record another album with Fleetwood Mac. &quot;Do you want to take a chance on [spending a year recording an album with] a bunch of arguing people? And then not wanting to go on tour because you just spent a year arguing?&quot;

On 9 June 2017, Buckingham and Christine McVie released a new album, titled &quot;Lindsey Buckingham/Christine McVie&quot;, which included contributions from Mick Fleetwood and John McVie. The album was preceded by the single &quot;In My World&quot;. A 38-date tour to support the album began on 21 June and concluded 16 November. Fleetwood Mac also planned to embark on another tour in 2018. The band headlined the second night of the Classic West concert on 16 July 2017 at Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles, and the second night of the Classic East concert at New York City&#x27;s Citi Field on 30 July 2017.

In January 2018, Fleetwood Mac received the MusiCares Person of the Year award and reunited to perform several songs at the Grammy-hosted gala honouring them. In April 2018, the song &quot;Dreams&quot; re-entered the Hot Rock Songs chart at No. 16 after a viral meme had featured it. This chart re-entry came 40 years after the song had topped the Hot 100. The song&#x27;s streaming totals also translated into 7,000 &quot;equivalent album units&quot;, a jump of 12 per cent, which helped &quot;Rumours&quot; to go from No. 21 to No. 13 on the Top Rock Albums chart.

In April 2018 Buckingham departed from the group a second time, having reportedly been dismissed. The reason was said to have been a disagreement about the nature of the tour, and in particular the question of whether newer or less well-known material would be included, as Buckingham wanted. Fleetwood stated on &quot;CBS This Morning&quot; on 25 April 2018 that Buckingham would not sign off on a tour that the group had been planning for a year and a half and they had reached a disagreement. When asked if Buckingham had been fired, he said, &quot;We don&#x27;t use that word because I think it&#x27;s ugly.&quot; He said Buckingham&#x27;s work in Fleetwood Mac would continue to be respected.

In October 2018, Buckingham filed a lawsuit against Fleetwood Mac for breach of fiduciary duty, breach of oral contract, and intentional interference with prospective economic advantage, among other claims. He later reached a settlement with the band but did not reveal the specific terms that were agreed upon. Buckingham also provided his version of what had led to his departure from the band. He said that after their performance at the MusiCares event, the band&#x27;s manager, Irving Azoff, had told him that, among other things, Nicks was not happy about his reaction to the intro music for their acceptance speech being &quot;Rhiannon&quot;, and about the way he had allegedly &quot;smirked&quot; during her thank-you speech. Buckingham conceded the first point. &quot;It wasn&#x27;t about it being &#x27;Rhiannon&#x27;. It just undermined the impact of our entrance.&quot; Azoff subsequently told him that Nicks had given the rest of the band an ultimatum: either Buckingham went or she would.

Former Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers guitarist Mike Campbell and Neil Finn of Crowded House were named to replace Buckingham. Aside from touring, the band planned to record new music with Campbell and Finn in the future. The band&#x27;s &quot;An Evening with Fleetwood Mac&quot; tour started in October 2018. The band launched the tour at the iHeartRadio Music Festival on 21 September 2018 at the T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas.

On 8 June 2018, former Fleetwood Mac guitarist Danny Kirwan died at the age of 68 in a hostel for homeless alcoholics in London, after contracting pneumonia earlier in the year. &quot;Mojo&quot; quoted Christine McVie as saying: &quot;Nobody else could play like him. He was a one-off. Danny was a perfectionist; a fantastic musician and a fantastic writer.&quot; One of Kirwan&#x27;s songs, &quot;Tell Me All the Things You Do&quot; from &quot;Kiln House&quot;, was included in the set of the &quot;An Evening with Fleetwood Mac&quot; tour.

On 28 May 2020, Neil Finn, featuring Nicks and McVie with Campbell on guitar, released the song &quot;Find Your Way Back Home&quot; for the Auckland homeless shelter Auckland City Mission.

Founding member Peter Green died on 25 July 2020 at the age of 73.

In October 2020, &quot;Rumours&quot; again entered the &quot;Billboard&quot; top 10. The album received 30.6 million streams on streaming platforms the week of 15 October, which was in part due to a viral video featuring the song &quot;Dreams&quot;.

On 30 November 2022, Christine McVie died at the age of 79. In February 2023, when asked about further activity from the band, Fleetwood expressed his belief that the band was &quot;done&quot; and said the other surviving members were keeping themselves busy with other musical pursuits. In an October 2023 interview, Nicks stated that she saw no reason to continue the band after McVie&#x27;s death, which she reiterated in interviews with &quot;Mojo&quot; and &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; the following year. However, in an interview with &quot;Mojo&quot; in September 2024, Fleetwood stated that he was open to re-assembling the band.

<doc id="11788" wikidata="Q700425" url="?curid=11788" title="Frederick I, Margrave of Brandenburg-Ansbach">
<text>Frederick I of Ansbach and Bayreuth (also known as Frederick V; or ; 8 May 1460 ‚Äì 4 April 1536) was born at Ansbach as the eldest son of Albert III, Margrave of Brandenburg by his second wife Anna, daughter of Frederick II, Elector of Saxony. His elder half-brother was the Elector John Cicero of Brandenburg. Friedrich succeeded his father as Margrave of Ansbach in 1486 and his younger brother Siegmund as Margrave of Bayreuth in 1495.

After depleting the finances of the margraviate with his lavish lifestyle, Frederick I was deposed by his two elder sons, Casimir and George, in 1515. He was then locked up at Plassenburg Castle by his eldest son Casimir in a tower room from which he could not escape for 12 years. Thereupon, his son Casimir took up the rule of the Margraviate of Bayreuth (Kulmbach) and his son George took up the rule of the Margraviate of Ansbach. However, the overthrow of Frederick did outrage his other younger sons and led to far-reaching political countermeasures. When Elector Joachim I of Brandenburg visited Kulmbach during his journey to Augsburg, and wanted to plead for Frederick&#x27;s release, he was nevertheless denied entry to Plassenburg Castle. The dispute was finally cleared when an agreement was reached in 1522, in which the demands of the younger sons of Frederick were met.

<text>Frederick William I (; 14 August 1688 ‚Äì 31 May 1740), known as the Soldier King (), was King in Prussia and Elector of Brandenburg from 1713 until his death in 1740, as well as Prince of Neuch√¢tel. 

Born in Berlin, he was raised by the Huguenot governess Marthe de Roucoulle. His political awakening occurred during the Great Northern War&#x27;s plague outbreak in Prussia, leading to his challenge against corruption and inefficiency in government. He initiated reforms, especially in the military, doubling the Prussian Army and increased the officer corps to 3,000. A believer in absolute monarchy, he focused on state development and financial reorganization, imposing taxes and stringent regulations on public servants. He made efforts to reduce crime and centralized his authority during his 27 years&#x27; reign, cementing Prussia as a regional power.

Despite his effective rule, he had a harsh nature, exacerbated by his health issues. He engaged in colonial affairs, but prioritized military expansion over colonial investments. His notable decisions included selling Prussian overseas colonies and the foundation of the Canton system, as well as the conquest of the port of Stettin.

His death in 1740 marked the end of a reign characterized by military and administrative reform. He was succeeded by his son, Frederick the Great.

==Early years==
Frederick William was born in Berlin to King Frederick I of Prussia and Princess Sophia Charlotte of Hanover. During his first years, he was raised by the Huguenot governess Marthe de Roucoulle. When the Great Northern War plague outbreak devastated Prussia, the inefficiency and corruption of the king&#x27;s favorite ministers and senior officials were highlighted. Frederick William with a party that formed at the court brought down the leading minister Johann Kasimir Kolbe von Wartenberg and his cronies, following an official investigation that exposed Wartenberg&#x27;s huge-scale misappropriation and embezzlement. His close associate August David zu Sayn-Wittgenstein-Hohenstein was imprisoned at Spandau Citadel, fined 70,000 thalers and banished subsequently. The incident exerted great influence on Frederick William, making him resent crime, corruption, wastage and inefficiency and realize the necessity of institutional reform. It also became the first time he actively participated in politics. From then on, Frederick I began to let his son take more power.

== Reign ==

His father had successfully acquired the title of king for the Duchy of Prussia for which he had paid the high price of 2 million ducats to Emperor Leopold I, 600,000 ducats to the German clergy and 20,000 thalers to the Jesuit order. In addition, Frederick was obligated to provide Leopold with 8,000 soldiers for the War of the Spanish Succession. To demonstrate his new status, he had the Berlin Palace, Charlottenburg Palace, and K√∂nigsberg Castle doubled in size and furnished at considerable expense. However, in doing so, he had largely ruined the state&#x27;s finances.

On ascending the throne in 1713, Frederick William therefore dismissed his father&#x27;s corrupt &quot;Cabinet of Three Counts&quot;. He worked persistently to reorganize the finances that had been shattered by his father, furthermore to enhance the economic development of his far-flung countries and to build up one of the largest and best equipped and trained armies in Europe. He would expand the Prussian Army from 38,000 men in 1713 to 80,000 in 1740, with an average of 1 out of every 25 Prussian men serving in the military. He expanded military obligations for the peasant class while replacing mandatory military service among the middle class with an annual tax, and he established schools and hospitals. The king encouraged farming, reclaimed marshes, stored grain in good times and sold it in bad times. 

Frederick would also work to expand state income. He increased excise taxes, both on domestic and foreign goods, as well as subjecting the Prussian nobility to a land tax. He dictated the manual of Regulations for State Officials, containing 35 chapters and 297 paragraphs in which every public servant in Prussia could find his duties precisely set out: a minister or councillor failing to attend a committee meeting, for example, would lose six months&#x27; pay; if he absented himself a second time, he would be discharged from the royal service. In short, Frederick William I concerned himself with every aspect of his country, ruling an absolute monarchy with great energy and skill.

The king also took an interest in Prussian colonial affairs. In 1717, he revoked the charter of the Brandenburg Africa Company (BAC), which had been granted said charter by his father to establish a colony in West Africa known as the Brandenburg Gold Coast. The king was unwilling to spend money on maintaining either the colony or the Prussian Navy, preferring to utilise state revenues on enlarging the Royal Prussian Army. In 1717, Frederick William sold the Brandenburg Gold Coast to the Dutch West India Company.

In 1732, the king invited the Salzburg Protestants to settle in East Prussia, which had been depopulated by plague in 1709. Under the terms of the Peace of Augsburg, the prince-archbishop of Salzburg could require his subjects to practice the Catholic faith, but Protestants had the right to emigrate to a Protestant state. Prussian commissioners accompanied 20,000 Protestants to their new homes on the other side of Germany. Frederick William I personally welcomed the first group of migrants and sang Protestant hymns with them.

In 1733 he began building the Dutch Quarter in Potsdam, where he invited talented Dutch craftsmen to settle.

Frederick William intervened briefly in the Great Northern War, allied with Peter the Great of Russia, in order to gain a small portion of Swedish Pomerania; this gave Prussia new ports on the Baltic Sea coast. More significantly, aided by his close friend Leopold I, Prince of Anhalt-Dessau, the &quot;Soldier-King&quot; made considerable reforms to the Prussian army&#x27;s training, tactics and conscription program‚Äîintroducing the canton system, and greatly increasing the Prussian infantry&#x27;s rate of fire through the introduction of the iron ramrod. Frederick William&#x27;s reforms left his son Frederick with the most formidable army in Europe, which Frederick used to increase Prussia&#x27;s power.

Although a highly effective ruler, Frederick William had a perpetually short temper which sometimes drove him to physically attack servants (or even his own children) with a cane at the slightest perceived provocation. His violent, harsh nature was further exacerbated by his inherited porphyritic disease, which gave him gout, obesity and frequent crippling stomach pains. He also had a notable contempt for France, and would sometimes fly into a rage at the mere mention of that country, although this did not stop him from encouraging the immigration of French Huguenot refugees to Prussia.

==Burial and reburials==
Frederick William died in 1740 at age 51 and was interred at the Garrison Church in Potsdam. During World War II, in order to protect it from advancing allied forces, Hitler ordered the king&#x27;s coffin, as well as those of Frederick the Great and Paul von Hindenburg, into hiding, first to Berlin and later to a salt mine outside of Bernterode. The coffins were later discovered by occupying American forces, who re-interred the bodies in St. Elizabeth&#x27;s Church, Marburg in 1946. In 1953 the coffin was moved to Hohenzollern Castle, where it remained until 1991, when it was finally laid to rest on the steps of the altar in the Kaiser Friedrich Mausoleum in the Church of Peace on the palace grounds of Sanssouci. The original black marble sarcophagus collapsed at Burg Hohenzollern‚Äîthe current one is a copper copy.

==Relationship with Frederick II==

His eldest surviving son was Frederick II (Fritz), born in 1712. Frederick William wanted him to become a fine soldier. As a small child, Fritz was awakened each morning by the firing of a cannon. At the age of 6, he was given his own regiment of children to drill as cadets, and a year later, he was given a miniature arsenal.

The love and affection Frederick William had for his heir initially was soon soured due to their increasingly different personalities. Frederick William ordered Fritz to undergo a minimal education, live a simple Protestant lifestyle, and focus on the Army and statesmanship as he had. However, the intellectual Fritz was more interested in music, books and French culture, which were forbidden by his father as decadent and unmanly. As Fritz&#x27;s defiance for his father&#x27;s rules increased, Frederick William would frequently beat or humiliate Fritz (he preferred his younger sibling Augustus William). Fritz was beaten for being thrown off a bolting horse and wearing gloves in cold weather. 

At age 16, Frederick seems to have embarked upon a youthful affair with Peter Karl Christoph von Keith, a 17-year-old page of his father. Rumors of the liaison spread in the court, and the &quot;intimacy&quot; between the two boys provoked the comments of his sister, Wilhelmine, who wrote, &quot;Though I had noticed that he was on more familiar terms with this page than was proper in his position, I did not know how intimate the friendship was.&quot; Rumors finally reached King Frederick William, who cultivated an ideal of ultramasculinity in his court, and derided his son&#x27;s supposedly effeminate tendencies. As a result, Keith was dismissed from his service to the king and sent away to a regiment by the Dutch border, while Frederick was sent to the king&#x27;s hunting lodge at K√∂nigs Wusterhausen in order to &quot;repent of his sin&quot;. 

After the prince attempted to flee to England with his tutor, Hans Hermann von Katte, the enraged king had Katte beheaded before the eyes of the prince, who himself was court-martialled. The king may have thought that Frederick&#x27;s relationship with Katte was also romantic, a suspicion that may have played a role in Katte receiving a death sentence. In any case, the court declared itself not competent in the case of the crown prince. Whether it was the king&#x27;s intention to have his son executed as well (as Voltaire claims) is not clear. However, the Holy Roman Emperor Charles VI intervened, claiming that a prince could only be tried by the Imperial Diet of the Holy Roman Empire itself. Frederick was imprisoned in the Fortress of K√ºstrin from 2 September to 19 November 1731 and exiled from court until February 1732, during which time he was rigorously schooled in matters of state. After achieving a measure of reconciliation, Frederick William had his son married to Princess Elisabeth Christine of Brunswick-Wolfenb√ºttel-Bevern, whom Frederick despised, but then grudgingly allowed him to indulge in his musical and literary interests again. He also gifted him a stud farm in East Prussia, and Rheinsberg Palace. By the time of Frederick William&#x27;s death in 1740, he and Frederick were on at least reasonable terms with each other.

Although the relationship between Frederick William and Frederick was clearly hostile, Frederick wrote in his memoirs that his father &quot;penetrated and understood great objectives and knew the best interests of his country better than any minister or general.&quot;

==Marriage and family==
Frederick William married his first cousin Sophia Dorothea of Hanover, George II&#x27;s younger sister (daughter of his uncle, King George I of Great Britain and Sophia Dorothea of Celle) on 28 November 1706. Frederick William was faithful and loving to his wife but they did not have a happy relationship: Sophia Dorothea feared his unpredictable temper and resented him, both for allowing her no influence or independence at court, and for refusing to marry her children to their English cousins. She also abhorred his cruelty towards their son and heir Frederick (with whom she was close), although rather than trying to mend the relationship between father and son she frequently spurred Frederick on in his defiance. They had fourteen children, including:

He was the godfather of the Prussian envoy Friedrich Wilhelm von Thulemeyer and of his grand-nephew, Prince Edward Augustus of Great Britain.

== Memorial site and exhibition ==
K√∂nigs Wusterhausen Castle, the king&#x27;s hunting lodge and garden, were his favourite place to stay and to indulge in hunting when he wanted to relax from his state duties, which he performed at the Berlin Palace and the City Palace, Potsdam. His children also had to spend their holidays here regularly. Frederick the Great had a strong dislike for the place, but the two youngest sons, in old age, after Frederick&#x27;s death, returned together a few times out of sentimental memories to where they spent so much time growing up.

Today the castle, southeast of the Berlin city limits not far from Berlin Airport, is a museum of the Prussian Palaces and Gardens Foundation Berlin-Brandenburg. Numerous valuable objects of baroque paintings and handicrafts are on display, mostly with connections to Frederick William and his family, many pieces of the original interior, as well as a large collection of portraits, mainly of officers, which the &quot;Soldier King&quot; painted himself.

<doc id="11795" wikidata="Q847257" url="?curid=11795" title="Felsic">
<text>In geology, felsic is a modifier describing igneous rocks that are relatively rich in elements that form feldspar and quartz. It is contrasted with mafic rocks, which are richer in magnesium and iron. Felsic refers to silicate minerals, magma, and rocks which are enriched in the lighter elements such as silicon, oxygen, aluminium, sodium, and potassium. Molten felsic magma and lava is more viscous than molten mafic magma and lava. Felsic magmas and lavas have lower temperatures of melting and solidification than mafic magmas and lavas.

Felsic rocks are usually light in color and have specific gravities less than 3. The most common felsic rock is granite. Common felsic minerals include quartz, muscovite, orthoclase, and the sodium-rich plagioclase feldspars (albite-rich).

==Terminology==

=== Acid rock ===
In modern usage, the term &quot;acid rock&quot;, although sometimes used as a synonym, normally now refers specifically to a high-silica-content (greater than 63% SiO2 by weight) volcanic rock, such as rhyolite. Older, broader usage is now considered archaic. That usage, with the contrasting term &quot;basic rock&quot; (MgO, FeO, mafic), was based on an ancient concept, dating from the 19th century, that &quot;silicic acid&quot; (H4SiO4 or Si(OH)4) was the chief form of silicon occurring in siliceous rocks. Although this intuition makes sense from an acid-base perspective in aquatic chemistry considering water-rock interactions and silica dissolution, siliceous rocks are not formed by this protonated monomeric species, but by a tridimensional network of SiO44‚Äì tetrahedra connected to each other. Once released in water and hydrolyzed, these silica entities can indeed form silicic acid in aqueous solution. 

=== Etymology ===
The term &quot;felsic&quot; is a derivation of the words &quot;feldspar&quot; and &quot;silica&quot;. The similarity of the resulting term &quot;felsic&quot; to the German &quot;felsig&quot;, &quot;rocky&quot; (from &quot;Fels&quot;, &quot;rock&quot;), is accidental. &quot;Feldspar&quot; is from the German &quot;Feldspat&quot;, a compound of the German &quot;Feld&quot;, meaning field, plus &quot;spat[h]&quot;, meaning mineral.

==Classification of felsic rocks==

In order for a rock (rather than a mineral) to be classified as felsic, it generally needs to contain more than 75% felsic minerals (namely quartz, orthoclase and plagioclase). Rocks with greater than 90% felsic minerals can also be called leucocratic, from the Greek words for white and dominance.

Felsite is a petrologic field term used to refer to very fine-grained or aphanitic, light-colored volcanic rocks which might be later reclassified after a more detailed microscopic or chemical analysis.

In some cases, felsic volcanic rocks may contain phenocrysts of mafic minerals, usually hornblende, pyroxene or a feldspar mineral, and may need to be named after their phenocryst mineral, such as &#x27;hornblende-bearing felsite&#x27;.

The chemical name of a felsic rock is given according to the TAS classification of Le Maitre (1975). However, this only applies to volcanic rocks. If the rock is analyzed and found to be felsic but is metamorphic and has no definite volcanic protolith, it may be sufficient to simply call it a &#x27;felsic schist&#x27;. There are examples known of highly sheared granites which can be mistaken for rhyolites.

For phaneritic felsic rocks, the QAPF diagram should be used, and a name given according to the granite nomenclature. Often the species of mafic minerals is included in the name, for instance, hornblende-bearing granite, pyroxene tonalite or augite megacrystic monzonite, because the term &quot;granite&quot; already assumes content with feldspar and quartz.

The rock texture thus determines the basic name of a felsic rock.

<doc id="11797" wikidata="Q106416" url="?curid=11797" title="Frisians">
<text>The Frisians () are an ethnic group indigenous to the coastal regions of the Netherlands, north-western Germany and southern Denmark, and during the Early Middle Ages in the north-western coastal zone of Flanders, Belgium. They inhabit an area known as Frisia and are concentrated in the Dutch provinces of Friesland and Groningen and, in Germany, East Frisia and North Frisia (which was a part of Denmark until 1864). 

The Frisian languages are spoken by more than 500,000 people; West Frisian is officially recognised in the Netherlands (in Friesland), and North Frisian and Saterland Frisian are recognised as regional languages in Germany.

==Name==
There are several theories about the origin of the name of the Frisians, which is derived from &quot;Frisii&quot; or &quot;Fresones&quot;, names used by the Romans to describe a Germanic tribe that inhabited the same region but disappeared during the 5th century before the appearance of the Frisians. Most probably the name is derived from the verb &quot;fresare&quot; in Vulgar Latin, meaning &#x27;milling, cutting, grooving, crushing, removing shells&#x27;; this name may have been given to the Frisii because they &#x27;cut the land&#x27;: digging ditches and dykes to irrigate the wet marshlands where they lived. Compare &quot;fresar el paisaje&quot; in the Romance language Spanish&quot;.&quot; Another theory is the name derives from &quot;frisselje&quot; (to braid, thus referring to braided hair).

==History==
Prior to the appearance of the modern Frisians, their namesake, the ancient Frisii, enter recorded history in the Roman account of Drusus&#x27;s 12¬†BC war against the Rhine Germans and the Chauci. They occasionally appear in the accounts of Roman wars against the Germanic tribes of the region, up to and including the Revolt of the Batavi around 70¬†AD. Frisian mercenaries were hired as cavalry to assist the Roman invasion of Britain. They are not mentioned again until 296, when they were deported into Roman territory as &quot;laeti&quot; (i.e., Roman-era serfs; see Binchester Roman Fort and Cuneus Frisionum). The discovery of a type of earthenware unique to fourth century Frisia, called &quot;terp Tritzum&quot;, shows that an unknown number of them were resettled in Flanders and Kent, probably as &quot;laeti&quot; under Roman coercion.
From the third through the fifth centuries, Frisia suffered marine transgressions that made most of the land uninhabitable, aggravated by a change to a cooler and wetter climate. Whatever population may have remained dropped dramatically, and the coastal lands remained largely unpopulated for the next two centuries. When conditions improved, Frisia received an influx of new settlers, mostly Angles and Saxons. These people would eventually be referred to as &#x27;Frisians&#x27; (, ), though they were not necessarily descended from the ancient Frisii. It is these &#x27;new Frisians&#x27; who are largely the ancestors of the medieval and modern Frisians.

By the end of the sixth century, Frisian territory had expanded westward to the North Sea coast and, in the seventh century, southward down to Dorestad. This farthest extent of Frisian territory is sometimes referred to as &quot;Frisia Magna&quot;. Early Frisia was ruled by a High King, with the earliest reference to a &#x27;Frisian King&#x27; being dated 678.

In the early eighth century, the Frisians mostly worshipped Germanic gods such as Thor and Odin outside the vicinity of Utrecht. Slightly later, the Frisian nobles came into increasing conflict with the Franks to their south, resulting in a series of wars in which the Frankish Empire eventually subjugated Frisia in 734. These wars benefited attempts by Anglo-Irish missionaries (which had begun with Saint Boniface) to convert the Frisian populace to Christianity, in which Saint Willibrord largely succeeded.

Some time after the death of Charlemagne, the Frisian territories were in theory under the control of the Count of Holland, but in practice the Hollandic counts, starting with Count Arnulf in 993, were unable to assert themselves as the sovereign lords of Frisia. The resulting stalemate resulted in a period of time called the &#x27;Frisian freedom&#x27;, a period in which feudalism and serfdom (as well as central or judicial administration) did not exist, and in which the Frisian lands only owed their allegiance to the Holy Roman Emperor.

During the 13th century, however, the counts of Holland became increasingly powerful and, starting in 1272, sought to reassert themselves as rightful lords of the Frisian lands in a series of wars, which (with a series of lengthy interruptions) ended in 1422 with the Hollandic conquest of Western Frisia and with the establishment of a more powerful noble class in Central and Eastern Frisia.

In 1524, Frisia became part of the Seventeen Provinces and in 1568 joined the Dutch revolt against Philip II, king of Spain, heir of the Burgundian territories; Central Frisia has remained a part of the Netherlands ever since. The eastern periphery of Frisia would become part of various German states (later Germany) and Denmark. An old tradition existed in the region of exploitation of peatlands.

==Migration to England and Scotland==

Though it is impossible to know exact numbers and migration patterns, research has indicated that many Frisians were part of the wave of ethnic groups to colonise areas of present-day England alongside the Angles, Saxons and Jutes, starting from around the fifth century when Frisians arrived along the coastline of Kent.

Frisians principally settled in modern-day Kent, East Anglia, the East Midlands, North East England, and Yorkshire. Across these areas, evidence of their settlement includes place names of Frisian origin, such as Frizinghall in Bradford and Frieston in Lincolnshire.

Similarities in dialect between Great Yarmouth and Friesland have been noted, originating from trade between these areas during the Middle Ages. Frisians are also known to have founded the Freston area of Ipswich.

In Scotland, historians have noted that colonies of Angles and Frisians settled as far north as the River Forth. This corresponds to those areas of Scotland which historically constituted part of Northumbria.

== Frisians in Denmark ==
The earliest traces of Frisians in modern-day Denmark date back from the 8th century, when Frisian traders and craftsmen settled down in Ribe. In the Later Middle Ages Frisians farmers settled around T√∏ndermarsken west of T√∏nder. The evidence for this are the dwelling mounds or terps (&quot;v√¶rfter&quot;) in the area that are built after the same method as the ones alongside the Wadden Sea further south. Colonists from the south also settled down in Misthusum in the Ballum marshes near Sk√¶rb√¶k during the 12th of 13th century. According to documents around 1400 at least some of them were considered as &quot;Hollanders&quot;.

In modern times, Frisian culture in Denmark is described as assimilated and most people of Frisian descent do not consider themselves Frisian. In regards of the Frisian language, very few may speak it as first language but it was traditionally spoken in several polder hamlets near the border with Germany. One estimate puts the Frisian population in Denmark somewhere between 2,000 and 5,000. This number, however, might be grossly exaggerated. Frisian identity in Denmark was promoted by the Eiderstedt farmer and political activist Cornelius Petersen, who built a traditional Frisian farmstead in M√∏gelt√∏nder in 1914 and founded the rural protest movement &quot;Bondens Selvstyre&quot; (&quot;Farmers&#x27; self-government&quot;). More recently, the retired journalist Benny Siewertsen wrote a partisan pamphlet on Frisian heritage in Denmark.

== Language ==

As both the Anglo-Saxons of England and the early Frisians were formed from similar tribal confederacies, their respective languages were very similar, together forming the Anglo-Frisian family. Old Frisian is the most closely related language to Old English and the modern Frisian dialects are in turn the closest related languages to contemporary English that themselves derive not from Old English (although modern Frisian and English are not mutually intelligible).

The Frisian language group is divided into three mutually unintelligible languages:
*West Frisian, spoken in the Dutch province of Friesland
*Saterland Frisian, spoken in the German municipality of Saterland just south of East Frisia
*North Frisian, spoken in the German region of North Frisia (within the of Nordfriesland) on the west coast of Jutland.

Of these three languages both Saterland Frisian (2,000 speakers) and North Frisian (10,000 speakers) are endangered. West Frisian is spoken by around 350,000 native speakers in Friesland, and as many as 470,000 when including speakers in neighbouring Groningen province. West Frisian is not listed as threatened, although research published by Radboud University in 2016 has challenged that assumption.

==Identity==
Today, there exists a tripartite division of North, East and West Frisians; this was caused by Frisia&#x27;s continual loss of territory in the Middle Ages. The West Frisians, in general, do not see themselves as part of a larger group of Frisians, and, according to a 1970 poll, identify themselves more with the Dutch than with the East or North Frisians.

<doc id="11801" wikidata="Q216582" url="?curid=11801" title="Filippo Tommaso Marinetti">
<text>Filippo Tommaso Emilio Marinetti (; 22 December 1876 ‚Äì 2 December 1944) was an Italian poet, editor, art theorist, and founder of the Futurist movement. He was associated with the utopian and Symbolist artistic and literary community Abbaye de Cr√©teil between 1907 and 1908. Marinetti is best known as the author of the &quot;Manifesto of Futurism&quot;, which was written and published in 1909, and as a co-author of the Fascist Manifesto, in 1919.

==Childhood and adolescence==
Emilio Angelo Carlo Marinetti (some documents give his name as &quot;Filippo Achille Emilio Marinetti&quot;) spent the first years of his life in Alexandria, Egypt, where his father, Enrico Marinetti, and mother, Amalia Grolli, lived together &quot;more uxorio&quot; (as if married). Enrico was a lawyer from Piedmont, and his mother was the daughter of a literary professor from Milan. They had come to Egypt in 1865 at the invitation of Khedive Isma&#x27;il Pasha to act as legal advisers for foreign companies that were taking part in his modernization program.

Marinetti&#x27;s love for literature developed during the school years. His mother was an avid reader of poetry and introduced her young son to the Italian and other European classics. At 17, he started his first school magazine, &quot;Papyrus&quot;; the Jesuits threatened to expel him for publicizing √âmile Zola&#x27;s scandalous novels in the school.

He studied in Egypt and then in Paris, obtained a &quot;baccalaur√©at&quot; degree in 1894 at the Sorbonne University and in Italy, and graduated in law at the University of Pavia in 1899.

He decided not to be a lawyer but to develop a literary career. He experimented with every type of literature (poetry, narrative, theatre, &quot;words in liberty&quot;) and signed everything &quot;Filippo Tommaso Marinetti&quot;.

==Futurism==

Marinetti and Constantin Br√¢ncu»ôi were visitors of the Abbaye de Cr√©teil around 1908, along with young writers like Roger Allard (one of the first to defend Cubism), Pierre Jean Jouve and Paul Castiaux, who wanted to publish their works through the Abbaye. The Abbaye de Cr√©teil was a &quot;phalanst√®re&quot; community founded in the autumn of 1906 by the painter Albert Gleizes, and the poets Ren√© Arcos, Henri-Martin Barzun, Alexandre Mercereau and Charles Vildrac. The movement drew its inspiration from the &quot;Abbaye de Th√©l√®me&quot;, a fictional creation by Rabelais in his novel &quot;Gargantua&quot;. It was closed down by its members in early 1908.

Marinetti is known best as the author of the &quot;Futurist Manifesto&quot;, which he wrote in 1909. It was published in French on the front page of the most prestigious French daily newspaper, &quot;Le Figaro&quot;, on 20 February 1909. Marinetti declared in it, &quot;Art, in fact, can be nothing but violence, cruelty, and injustice&quot;. Georges Sorel, who influenced the entire political spectrum from anarchism to Fascism, also argued for the importance of violence. Futurism had both anarchist and Fascist elements; Marinetti later became an active supporter of Benito Mussolini.

Marinetti, who admired speed, had a minor car crash outside Milan in 1908 after he veered into a ditch to avoid two cyclists. He referred to the crash in the &quot;Futurist Manifesto&quot;. The Marinetti who was helped out of the ditch was a new man, determined to end the pretense and decadence of the prevailing Liberty style. He discussed a new and strongly revolutionary programme with his friends, in which they should end every artistic relationship with the past, &quot;destroy the museums, the libraries, every type of academy&quot;. Together, he wrote, &quot;We will glorify war‚Äîthe world&#x27;s only hygiene‚Äîmilitarism, patriotism, the destructive gesture of freedom-bringers, beautiful ideas worth dying for, and scorn for woman&quot;.

The &quot;Futurist Manifesto&quot; was read and debated all across Europe, but Marinetti&#x27;s first &#x27;Futurist works were not as successful. In April, the opening night of his drama &quot;Le Roi bombance&quot; (The Feasting King), written in 1905, was interrupted by loud, derisive whistling by the audience and by Marinetti himself, who thus introduced another element of Futurism, &quot;the desire to be heckled&quot;. Marinetti, however, fought a duel with a critic whom he considered too harsh.

His drama &quot;La donna √® mobile&quot; (Poup√©es √©lectriques), first presented in Turin, was not successful either. Nowadays, the play is remembered through a later version, &quot;Elettricit√† sessuale&quot; (Sexual Electricity), mainly for the appearance onstage of humanoid automatons ten years before the Czech writer Karel ƒåapek invented the term &quot;robot&quot;.
In 1910, his first novel, &quot;Mafarka il futurista&quot;, was cleared of all charges by an obscenity trial. That year, Marinetti discovered some allies in three young painters (Umberto Boccioni, Carlo Carr√† and Luigi Russolo), who adopted the Futurist philosophy. Together with them and poets such as Aldo Palazzeschi, Marinetti began a series of Futurist Evenings, theatrical spectacles in which Futurists declaimed their manifestos in front of a crowd that in part attended the performances to throw vegetables at them.

The most successful &quot;happening&quot; of that period was the publicization of the &quot;Manifesto Against Past-Loving Venice&quot; in Venice. In the flier, Marinetti demands &quot;fill(ing) the small, stinking canals with the rubble from the old, collapsing and leprous palaces&quot; to &quot;prepare for the birth of an industrial and militarized Venice, capable of dominating the great Adriatic, a great Italian lake&quot;.

In 1911, the Italo-Turkish War began, and Marinetti departed for Libya as a war correspondent for a French newspaper. His articles were eventually collected and published in &quot;The Battle of Tripoli&quot;. He then covered the First Balkan War of 1912‚Äì1913 and witnessed the surprise success of Bulgarian troops against the Ottoman Empire during the Siege of Adrianople. In this period, he also made a number of visits to London, which he considered &#x27;the Futurist city par excellence&#x27; and where a number of exhibitions, lectures and demonstrations of Futurist music were staged.

Marinetti sought to establish an English Futurism and initially had an ally in Harold Monro, the editor of &quot;Poetry and Drama&quot;, a London literary journal. Monro devoted the September 1913 issue to Futurism, praising Marinetti in a long editorial. However, although a number of artists, including Wyndham Lewis, were interested in the new movement, only one British convert was made, the young artist C.R.W. Nevinson. Marinetti&#x27;s campaign both threatened and influenced Ezra Pound, who founded his own literary movement, Imagism and wrote manifestos to publicize it and attack Futurism. One result of Pound&#x27;s strong reaction to Marinetti was his advocacy of James Joyce and T.S. Eliot. Joyce was exposed to Futurism while living in Trieste. The movement&#x27;s techniques are reflected in &quot;Ulysses&quot; and in &quot;Finnegans Wake&quot;, one section of which alludes to ‚Äúcrucial elements of Futurism&quot;.

Futurism was an important influence upon Lewis&#x27;s Vorticist philosophy. Vorticism, named by Pound, was founded with the publication of Blast to which Pound was a major contributor. An advertisement promised that &quot;Blast&quot; would cover &quot;Cubism, Futurism, Imagisme and All Vital Forms of Modern Art&quot;. &quot;Blast&quot; was published only twice, in 1914 and 1915. Writing to Monro, Marinetti said that he was saddened by the reviews of Vorticism in the English press unfavorably comparing it with Futurism and would rather have worked in collaboration with the Vorticists. He and Pound later became friends, and in Canto LXXII, written in Italian, Pound meets the spirit of the recently deceased Marinetti.

Meanwhile, Marinetti worked on a very anti-Catholic and anti-Austr-Hungarian verse-novel, &quot;Le monoplan du Pape&quot; (&quot;The Pope&#x27;s Aeroplane&quot;, 1912), and edited an anthology of futurist poets, but his attempts to renew the style of poetry did not satisfy him. So much so that, in his foreword to the anthology, he declared a new revolution: it was time to be done with traditional syntax and to use &quot;words in freedom&quot; (&quot;parole in libert√†&quot;). His sound-poem &quot;Zang Tumb Tumb&quot;, an account of the Battle of Adrianople, exemplifies words in freedom. Recordings can be heard of Marinetti reading some of his sound poems: &quot;Battaglia, Peso + Odore&quot; (1912); &quot;Dune, parole in libert√†&quot; (1914); &quot;La Battaglia di Adrianopoli&quot; (1926) (recorded 1935).

==First World War==
Marinetti agitated for Italian involvement in the First World War and, once Italy had been engaged, promptly volunteered for service. In the fall of 1915, he and several other Futurists who were members of the Lombard Volunteer Cyclists were stationed at Lake Garda, in Trentino Province, high in the mountains along the Italo-Austrian border. They endured several weeks of fighting in harsh conditions before the cyclists units, deemed inappropriate for mountain warfare, were disbanded.

Marinetti spent most of 1916 supporting Italy&#x27;s war effort with speeches, journalism and theatrical work and then returned to military service as a regular army officer in 1917. In May 1917, he was seriously wounded while serving with an artillery battalion on the Isonzo Front. He returned to service after a long recovery and participated in the decisive Italian victory at Vittorio Veneto in October 1918.

==Marriage==
After an extended courtship, in 1923 Marinetti married Benedetta Cappa (1897‚Äì1977), a writer and painter and a pupil of Giacomo Balla. Born in Rome, she had joined the Futurists in 1917. They&#x27;d met in 1918, moved in together in Rome, and chose to marry only to avoid legal complications on a lecture tour of Brazil. They had three daughters: Vittoria, Ala, and Luce.

Cappa and Marinetti collaborated on a genre of mixed-media assemblages in the mid-1920s they called &quot;tattilismo&quot; (&quot;Tactilism&quot;), and she was a strong proponent and practitioner of the aeropittura movement after its inception in 1929. She also produced three experimental novels. Cappa&#x27;s major public work is likely a series of five murals at the Palermo Post Office (1926‚Äì1935) for the Fascist public-works architect Angiolo Mazzoni.

==Fascism==

In early 1918, Marinetti founded the Futurist Political Party, which only a year later merged with Benito Mussolini&#x27;s &quot;Fasci Italiani di Combattimento&quot;. Marinetti was one of the first affiliates of the Italian Fascist Party. In 1919, he co-wrote with Alceste De Ambris the &quot;Fascist Manifesto&quot;, the original manifesto of Italian Fascism. He opposed Fascism&#x27;s later exaltation of existing institutions, terming them &quot;reactionary&quot;. After walking out of the 1920 Fascist party congress in disgust, he withdrew from politics for three years; however, he remained a notable force in developing the party philosophy throughout the regime&#x27;s existence. For example, at the end of the &quot;Congress of Fascist Culture&quot; that was held in Bologna on 30 March 1925, Giovanni Gentile addressed Sergio Panunzio on the need to define Fascism more purposefully by way of Marinetti&#x27;s opinion: &quot;Great spiritual movements make recourse to precision when their primitive inspirations‚Äîwhat F. T. Marinetti identified this morning as artistic, that is to say, the creative and truly innovative ideas, from which the movement derived its first and most potent impulse‚Äîhave lost their force. We today find ourselves at the very beginning of a new life and we experience with joy this obscure need that fills our hearts‚Äîthis need that is our inspiration, the genius that governs us and carries us with it.&quot;

As part of his campaign to overturn tradition, Marinetti also attacked traditional Italian food. His &quot;Manifesto of Futurist Cooking&quot; was published in the Turin &quot;Gazzetta del Popolo&quot; on 28 December 1930. Arguing that &quot;People think, dress[,] and act in accordance with what they drink and eat&quot;, Marinetti proposed wide-ranging changes to diet. He condemned pasta, blaming it for lassitude, pessimism, and lack of virility, ‚Äî and promoted the eating of Italian-grown rice. In that as in other ways, his proposed Futurist cooking was nationalistic by rejecting foreign foods and food names. It was also militaristic by seeking to stimulate men to be fighters.

Marinetti also sought to increase creativity. His attraction to whatever was new made scientific discoveries appealing to him, but his views on diet were not scientifically based. He was fascinated with the idea of processed food, predicted that someday pills would replace food as a source of energy, and called for the creation of &quot;plastic complexes&quot; to replace natural foods. Food, in turn, would become a matter of artistic expression. Many of the meals Marinetti described and ate resemble performance art, such as the &quot;Tactile Dinner&quot;, recreated in 2014 for an exhibit at the Guggenheim Museum. Participants wore pajamas decorated with sponge, sandpaper, and aluminum, and ate salads without using cutlery.

During the Fascist regime, Marinetti sought to make Futurism the official state art of Italy but failed to do so. Mussolini was personally uninterested in art and chose to give patronage to numerous styles to keep artists loyal to the regime. Opening the exhibition of art by the Novecento Italiano group in 1923, he said: &quot;I declare that it is far from my idea to encourage anything like a state art. Art belongs to the domain of the individual. The state has only one duty: not to undermine art, to provide humane conditions for artists, to encourage them from the artistic and national point of view.&quot; Mussolini&#x27;s mistress, Margherita Sarfatti, successfully promoted the rival Novecento Group, and even persuaded Marinetti to be part of its board.

In Fascist Italy, modern art was tolerated and even approved by the Fascist hierarchy. Towards the end of the 1930s, some Fascist ideologues (for example, the ex-Futurist Ardengo Soffici) wished to import the concept of &quot;degenerate art&quot; from Germany to Italy and condemned modernism although their demands were ignored by the regime. In 1938, hearing that Adolf Hitler wanted to include Futurism in a traveling exhibition of degenerate art, Marinetti persuaded Mussolini to refuse to let it enter Italy.

On 17 November 1938, Italy passed the Racial Laws, discriminating against Italian Jews, much like the discrimination by Germany pronounced by the Nuremberg Laws. The antisemitic trend in Italy resulted in attacks against modern art, which was judged too foreign, radical and anti-nationalist. In the 11 January 1939 issue of the Futurist journal, &quot;Artecrazia&quot;, Marinetti expressed his condemnation of such attacks on modern art by noting that Futurism was both Italian and nationalist, not foreign, and stating that there were no Jews in Futurism. Furthermore, he claimed Jews were not active in the development of modern art. Regardless, the Italian state shut down &quot;Artecrazia&quot;.

Marinetti made numerous attempts to ingratiate himself with the regime by becoming less radical and avant garde with each attempt. He relocated from Milan to Rome. He became an academician despite his condemnation of academies and said, &quot;It is important that Futurism be represented in the Academy&quot;.

He was an atheist, but by the mid-1930s, he had come to accept the influence of the Catholic Church on Italian society. In &quot;Gazzetta del Popolo&quot;, 21 June 1931, Marinetti proclaimed that &quot;Only Futurist artists...are able to express clearly...the simultaneous dogmas of the Catholic faith, such as the Holy Trinity, the Immaculate Conception and Christ&#x27;s Calvary.&quot; In his last works, written just before his death in 1944 &quot;L&#x27;aeropoema di Ges√π&quot; (&quot;The Aeropoem of Jesus&quot;) and &quot;Quarto d&#x27;ora di poesia per the X Mas&quot; (&quot;A Fifteen Minutes&#x27; Poem of the tenth MAS&quot;), Marinetti sought to reconcile his newfound love for God and his passion for the action that accompanied him throughout his life.

There were other contradictions in his character: despite his nationalism, he was international, had been educated in Egypt and France, rote his first poems in French, published the Futurist Manifesto in a French newspaper and travelled to promote his ideas.

Marinetti volunteered for active service in the Second Italo-Abyssinian War and the Second World War, serving on the Eastern Front for a few weeks in the summer and the autumn of 1942 at the age of 65.

He died of cardiac arrest in Bellagio on 2 December 1944 while he was working on a collection of poems praising the wartime achievements of the Decima Flottiglia MAS.

<text>Franz Anton Mesmer ( ; ; 23 May 1734 ‚Äì 5 March 1815) was a German physician with an interest in astronomy. He theorized the existence of a process of natural energy transference occurring between all animate and inanimate objects; this he called &quot;animal magnetism&quot;, later referred to as &quot;mesmerism&quot;. Mesmer&#x27;s theory attracted a wide following between about 1780 and 1850, and continued to have some influence until the end of the 19th century. In 1843, the Scottish doctor James Braid proposed the term &quot;hypnotism&quot; for a technique derived from animal magnetism; today the word &quot;&quot; generally functions as a synonym of &quot;hypnosis&quot;. Mesmer also supported the arts, specifically music; he was on friendly terms with Haydn and Mozart.

==Early life==
Mesmer was born in the village of Iznang (now part of the municipality of Moos), on the shore of Lake Constance in Swabia. He was a son of master forester Anton Mesmer (1701‚Äìafter 1747) and his wife, Maria Ursula (n√©e Michel; 1701‚Äì1770). After studying at the Jesuit universities of Dillingen and Ingolstadt, he took up the study of medicine at the University of Vienna in 1759. In 1766 he published a doctoral dissertation with the Latin title &quot;De planetarum influxu in corpus humanum&quot; (&quot;On the Influence of the Planets on the Human Body&quot;), in which he discussed the influence of the moon and the planets on the human body and disease.

Building largely on Isaac Newton&#x27;s theory of the tides, Mesmer expounded on certain tides in the human body that might be accounted for by the movements of the sun and moon. Evidence assembled by Frank A. Pattie suggests that Mesmer plagiarized most of his dissertation from other works, including &quot;De imperio solis ac lunae in corpora humana et morbius inde oriundis&quot; (1704) by Richard Mead, an eminent English physician and Newton&#x27;s friend. However, in Mesmer&#x27;s day doctoral theses were not expected to be original.

In January 1768, Mesmer married Anna Maria von Posch, a wealthy widow, and established himself as a doctor in Vienna. In the summers he lived on a splendid estate and became a patron of the arts. In 1768, when court intrigue prevented the performance of &quot;La finta semplice&quot; (K. 51), for which the twelve-year-old Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart had composed 500 pages of music, Mesmer is said to have arranged a performance in his garden of Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Bastien und Bastienne&quot; (K. 50), a one-act opera, although Mozart&#x27;s biographer Nissen found no proof that this performance actually took place. Mozart later immortalized his former patron by including a comedic reference to Mesmer in his opera &quot;Cos√¨ fan tutte&quot;.
==Animal magnetism==

In 1774, Mesmer produced an &quot;artificial tide&quot; in a patient, Francisca √ñsterlin, who suffered from hysteria, by having her swallow a preparation containing iron and then attaching magnets to various parts of her body. She reported feeling streams of a mysterious fluid running through her body and was relieved of her symptoms for several hours. Mesmer did not believe that the magnets had achieved the cure on their own. He felt that he had contributed animal magnetism, which had accumulated in his work, to her. He soon stopped using magnets as a part of his treatment.

In the same year Mesmer collaborated with Maximilian Hell.

In 1775, Mesmer was invited to give his opinion before the Munich Academy of Sciences on the exorcisms carried out by Johann Joseph Gassner (Ga√üner), a priest and healer who grew up in Vorarlberg, Austria. Mesmer said that while Gassner was sincere in his beliefs, his cures resulted because he possessed a high degree of animal magnetism. This confrontation between Mesmer&#x27;s secular ideas and Gassner&#x27;s religious beliefs marked the end of Gassner&#x27;s career and, according to Henri Ellenberger, the emergence of dynamic psychiatry.

The scandal that followed Mesmer&#x27;s only partial success in curing the blindness of an 18-year-old musician, Maria Theresia Paradis, led him to leave Vienna in 1777. In February 1778, Mesmer moved to Paris, rented an apartment in a part of the city preferred by the wealthy and powerful, and established a medical practice. There he would reunite with Mozart, who often visited him. Paris soon divided into those who thought he was a charlatan who had been forced to flee from Vienna and those who thought he had made a great discovery.

In his first years in Paris, Mesmer tried and failed to get either the Royal Academy of Sciences or the Royal Society of Medicine to provide official approval for his doctrines. He found only one physician of high professional and social standing, Charles d&#x27;Eslon, to become a disciple. In 1779, with d&#x27;Eslon&#x27;s encouragement, Mesmer wrote an 88-page book, &quot;M√©moire sur la d√©couverte du magn√©tisme animal&quot;, to which he appended his famous 27 Propositions. These propositions outlined his theory at that time. Some contemporary scholars equate Mesmer&#x27;s animal magnetism with the qi (chi) of Traditional Chinese Medicine and mesmerism with medical Qigong practices.

According to d&#x27;Eslon, Mesmer understood health as the free flow of the process of life through thousands of channels in our bodies. Illness was caused by obstacles to this flow. Overcoming these obstacles and restoring flow produced crises, which restored health. When Nature failed to do this spontaneously, contact with a conductor of animal magnetism was a necessary and sufficient remedy. Mesmer aimed to aid or provoke the efforts of Nature. To cure an insane person, for example, involved causing a fit of madness. The advantage of magnetism involved accelerating such crises without danger.

===Procedure===
Mesmer treated patients both individually and in groups. With individuals he would sit in front of his patient with his knees touching the patient&#x27;s knees, pressing the patient&#x27;s thumbs in his hands, looking fixedly into the patient&#x27;s eyes. Mesmer made &quot;passes&quot;, moving his hands from the patient&#x27;s shoulders down along their arms. He then pressed his fingers on the patient&#x27;s hypochondrium (the area below the diaphragm), sometimes holding his hands there for hours. Many patients felt peculiar sensations or had convulsions that were regarded as crises and were supposed to bring about the cure. Mesmer would often conclude his treatments by playing some music on a glass harmonica.

By 1780, Mesmer had more patients than he could treat individually, and he established a collective treatment known as the &quot;baquet.&quot; An English doctor who observed Mesmer described the treatment as follows:In the middle of the room is placed a vessel of about a foot and a half high which is called here a &quot;baquet&quot;. It is so large that twenty people can easily sit round it; near the edge of the lid which covers it, there are holes pierced corresponding to the number of persons who are to surround it; into these holes are introduced iron rods, bent at right angles outwards, and of different heights, so as to answer to the part of the body to which they are to be applied. Besides these rods, there is a rope which communicates between the baquet and one of the patients, and from him is carried to another, and so on the whole round. The most sensible effects are produced on the approach of Mesmer, who is said to convey the fluid by certain motions of his hands or eyes, without touching the person. I have talked with several who have witnessed these effects, who have convulsions occasioned and removed by a movement of the hand...

===Investigation===

In 1784, without Mesmer having requested it, King Louis XVI appointed four members of the Faculty of Medicine as commissioners to investigate animal magnetism and Mesmerism. At the request of these commissioners, the king appointed Baron de Breteuil, minister of the Department of Paris, to establish investigative commissions. One was composed of individuals from the Royal Academy of Sciences, and the other of individuals from the Academy of Sciences and the Faculty of Medicine. The investigative teams included the chemist Antoine Lavoisier, the doctor Joseph-Ignace Guillotin, the astronomer Jean Sylvain Bailly, and the American ambassador Benjamin Franklin.

The commission conducted a series of experiments aimed not just at determining whether Mesmer&#x27;s treatment worked, but whether he had discovered a new physical fluid. The commission concluded that there was no evidence for such a fluid. Whatever benefit the treatment produced was attributed to &quot;imagination&quot;. One of the commissioners, the botanist Antoine Laurent de Jussieu took exception to the official reports, authoring a dissenting opinion.

The commission did not examine Mesmer specifically, but instead observed the practice of d&#x27;Eslon. They used blind trials, blindfolding the subjects, in their investigation, and found that Mesmerism seemed to work only when the subject was aware of it. Their findings are considered the first observation of the placebo effect. Even d&#x27;Eslon himself was convinced by the commission, stating that, &quot;the imagination thus directed to the relief of suffering humanity would be a most valuable means in the hands of the medical profession.&quot;

Mesmer was driven into exile soon after the investigations on animal magnetism. However, his influential student, Amand-Marie-Jacques de Chastenet, Marquis of Puys√©gur (1751‚Äì1825), continued to have many followers until his death. 

Mesmer continued to practice in Frauenfeld, Switzerland, for a number of years. He died in 1815 in Meersburg, Germany.

In Mozart&#x27;s 1790 opera buffa &quot;Cos√¨ fan tutte,&quot; a humorous scam involves the &quot;Albanian&quot; visitors staging a suicide attempt with poison, so &quot;Doctor&quot; Despina can demonstrate a piece of &quot;Mesmer&#x27;s magnet&quot; as a miracle cure.

In Gregory Ratoff&#x27;s 1949 film &quot;Black Magic&quot;, Mesmer was portrayed by Charles Goldner. In Roger Spottiswoode&#x27;s &quot;Mesmer&quot; (1994), he was portrayed by Alan Rickman.

<doc id="11806" wikidata="Q5464172" url="?curid=11806" title="Foix‚ÄìAlajouanine syndrome">
<text>Foix‚ÄìAlajouanine syndrome, also called subacute ascending necrotizing myelitis, is a disease caused by an arteriovenous malformation of the spinal cord. In particular, most cases involve dural arteriovenous malformations that present in the lower thoracic or lumbar spinal cord. The condition is named after Charles Foix and Th√©ophile Alajouanine who first described the condition in 1926.
==Signs and symptoms==
The patients can present with symptoms indicating spinal cord involvement such as (paralysis of arms and legs, numbness and loss of sensation and sphincter dysfunction), and pathological examination reveals disseminated nerve cell death in the spinal cord.
==Diagnosis==
Clinically, the patient may present with neurological symptoms such as numbness, weakness, loss of reflexes, or even sudden or progressive paralysis. The affected portion of the body will correlate to where the lesion lies within the spinal cord. The disease typically has an insidious onset, but symptoms may manifest suddenly. A thorough physical exam may lead a physician toward targeted imaging, with MRI being the most appropriate imaging modality for initial diagnosis. A spinal MRA will serve as a superior imaging technique to visualize the extent of the arteriovenous malformation within the cord and may be especially useful if surgical treatment is attempted.

==Treatment==
Surgical treatment may be attempted with endovascular embolization or ligation of the arteriovenous malformation within the spinal cord. Corticosteroids may be used acutely to help slow the progression of symptoms or they may be used chronically in a poor surgical candidate. In either case, physical therapy will be an important part of the recovery process in helping the patient regain strength and coordination.

<doc id="11807" wikidata="Q184207" url="?curid=11807" title="Ferromagnetism">
<text>Ferromagnetism is a property of certain materials (such as iron) that results in a significant, observable magnetic permeability, and in many cases, a significant magnetic coercivity, allowing the material to form a permanent magnet. Ferromagnetic materials are noticeably attracted to a magnet, which is a consequence of their substantial magnetic permeability. 

Magnetic permeability describes the induced magnetization of a material due to the presence of an external magnetic field. For example, this temporary magnetization inside a steel plate accounts for the plate&#x27;s attraction to a magnet. Whether or not that steel plate then acquires permanent magnetization depends on both the strength of the applied field and on the coercivity of that particular piece of steel (which varies with the steel&#x27;s chemical composition and any heat treatment it may have undergone).

In physics, multiple types of material magnetism have been distinguished. Ferromagnetism (along with the similar effect ferrimagnetism) is the strongest type and is responsible for the common phenomenon of everyday magnetism. An example of a permanent magnet formed from a ferromagnetic material is a refrigerator magnet.

Substances respond weakly to three other types of magnetism‚Äîparamagnetism, diamagnetism, and antiferromagnetism‚Äîbut the forces are usually so weak that they can be detected only by lab instruments. 

Permanent magnets (materials that can be magnetized by an external magnetic field and remain magnetized after the external field is removed) are either ferromagnetic or ferrimagnetic, as are the materials that are attracted to them. Relatively few materials are ferromagnetic. They are typically pure forms, alloys, or compounds of iron, cobalt, nickel, and certain rare-earth metals. 

Ferromagnetism is vital in industrial applications and modern technologies, forming the basis for electrical and electromechanical devices such as electromagnets, electric motors, generators, transformers, magnetic storage (including tape recorders and hard disks), and nondestructive testing of ferrous materials.

Ferromagnetic materials can be divided into magnetically soft materials (like annealed iron), which do not tend to stay magnetized, and magnetically hard materials, which do. Permanent magnets are made from hard ferromagnetic materials (such as alnico) and ferrimagnetic materials (such as ferrite) that are subjected to special processing in a strong magnetic field during manufacturing to align their internal microcrystalline structure, making them difficult to demagnetize. To demagnetize a saturated magnet, a magnetic field must be applied. The threshold at which demagnetization occurs depends on the coercivity of the material. Magnetically hard materials have high coercivity, whereas magnetically soft materials have low coercivity. 

The overall strength of a magnet is measured by its magnetic moment or, alternatively, its total magnetic flux. The local strength of magnetism in a material is measured by its magnetization.

==Terms==

Historically, the term &quot;ferromagnetism&quot; was used for any material that could exhibit spontaneous magnetization: a net magnetic moment in the absence of an external magnetic field; that is, any material that could become a magnet. This definition is still in common use.

In a landmark paper in 1948, Louis N√©el showed that two levels of magnetic alignment result in this behavior. One is ferromagnetism in the strict sense, where all the magnetic moments are aligned. The other is &quot;ferrimagnetism&quot;, where some magnetic moments point in the opposite direction but have a smaller contribution, so spontaneous magnetization is present.

In the special case where the opposing moments balance completely, the alignment is known as &quot;antiferromagnetism&quot;; antiferromagnets do not have a spontaneous magnetization.
==Materials==


Ferromagnetism is an unusual property that occurs in only a few substances. The common ones are the transition metals iron, nickel, and cobalt, as well as their alloys and alloys of rare-earth metals. It is a property not just of the chemical make-up of a material, but of its crystalline structure and microstructure. Ferromagnetism results from these materials having many unpaired electrons in their d-block (in the case of iron and its relatives) or f-block (in the case of the rare-earth metals), a result of Hund&#x27;s rule of maximum multiplicity. There are ferromagnetic metal alloys whose constituents are not themselves ferromagnetic, called Heusler alloys, named after Fritz Heusler. Conversely, there are non-magnetic alloys, such as types of stainless steel, composed almost exclusively of ferromagnetic metals.

Amorphous (non-crystalline) ferromagnetic metallic alloys can be made by very rapid quenching (cooling) of an alloy. These have the advantage that their properties are nearly isotropic (not aligned along a crystal axis); this results in low coercivity, low hysteresis loss, high permeability, and high electrical resistivity. One such typical material is a transition metal-metalloid alloy, made from about 80% transition metal (usually Fe, Co, or Ni) and a metalloid component (B, C, Si, P, or Al) that lowers the melting point.
A relatively new class of exceptionally strong ferromagnetic materials are the rare-earth magnets. They contain lanthanide elements that are known for their ability to carry large magnetic moments in well-localized f-orbitals.

The table lists a selection of ferromagnetic and ferrimagnetic compounds, along with their Curie temperature (&quot;T&quot;C), above which they cease to exhibit spontaneous magnetization.

=== Unusual materials ===
Most ferromagnetic materials are metals, since the conducting electrons are often responsible for mediating the ferromagnetic interactions. It is therefore a challenge to develop ferromagnetic insulators, especially multiferroic materials, which are both ferromagnetic and ferroelectric.

A number of actinide compounds are ferromagnets at room temperature or exhibit ferromagnetism upon cooling. PuP is a paramagnet with cubic symmetry at room temperature, but which undergoes a structural transition into a tetragonal state with ferromagnetic order when cooled below its . In its ferromagnetic state, PuP&#x27;s easy axis is in the ‚ü®100‚ü© direction.

In NpFe2 the easy axis is ‚ü®111‚ü©. Above , NpFe2 is also paramagnetic and cubic. Cooling below the Curie temperature produces a rhombohedral distortion wherein the rhombohedral angle changes from 60¬∞ (cubic phase) to 60.53¬∞. An alternate description of this distortion is to consider the length along the unique trigonal axis (after the distortion has begun) and as the distance in the plane perpendicular to . In the cubic phase this reduces to . Below the Curie temperature, the lattice acquires a distortion

: formula_1

which is the largest strain in any actinide compound. NpNi2 undergoes a similar lattice distortion below , with a strain of (43¬†¬±¬†5)¬†√ó¬†10‚àí4. NpCo2 is a ferrimagnet below 15¬†K.

In 2009, a team of MIT physicists demonstrated that a lithium gas cooled to less than one¬†kelvin can exhibit ferromagnetism. The team cooled fermionic lithium-6 to less than (150¬†billionths of one¬†kelvin) using infrared laser cooling. This demonstration is the first time that ferromagnetism has been demonstrated in a gas.

In rare circumstances, ferromagnetism can be observed in compounds consisting of only s-block and p-block elements, such as rubidium sesquioxide.

In 2018, a team of University of Minnesota physicists demonstrated that body-centered tetragonal ruthenium exhibits ferromagnetism at room temperature.

===Electrically induced ferromagnetism===
Recent research has shown evidence that ferromagnetism can be induced in some materials by an electric current or voltage. Antiferromagnetic LaMnO3 and SrCoO have been switched to be ferromagnetic by a current. In July 2020, scientists reported inducing ferromagnetism in the abundant diamagnetic material iron pyrite (&quot;fool&#x27;s gold&quot;) by an applied voltage. In these experiments, the ferromagnetism was limited to a thin surface layer.

==Explanation==
The Bohr‚ÄìVan Leeuwen theorem, discovered in the 1910s, showed that classical physics theories are unable to account for any form of material magnetism, including ferromagnetism; the explanation rather depends on the quantum mechanical description of atoms. Each of an atom&#x27;s electrons has a magnetic moment according to its spin state, as described by quantum mechanics. The Pauli exclusion principle, also a consequence of quantum mechanics, restricts the occupancy of electrons&#x27; spin states in atomic orbitals, generally causing the magnetic moments from an atom&#x27;s electrons to largely or completely cancel. An atom will have a &quot;net&quot; magnetic moment when that cancellation is incomplete.

===Origin of atomic magnetism===
One of the fundamental properties of an electron (besides that it carries charge) is that it has a magnetic dipole moment, i.e., it behaves like a tiny magnet, producing a magnetic field. This dipole moment comes from a more fundamental property of the electron: its quantum mechanical spin. Due to its quantum nature, the spin of the electron can be in one of only two states, with the magnetic field either pointing &quot;up&quot; or &quot;down&quot; (for any choice of up and down). Electron spin in atoms is the main source of ferromagnetism, although there is also a contribution from the orbital angular momentum of the electron about the nucleus. When these magnetic dipoles in a piece of matter are aligned (point in the same direction), their individually tiny magnetic fields add together to create a much larger macroscopic field.

However, materials made of atoms with filled electron shells have a total dipole moment of zero: because the electrons all exist in pairs with opposite spin, every electron&#x27;s magnetic moment is cancelled by the opposite moment of the second electron in the pair. Only atoms with partially filled shells (i.e., unpaired spins) can have a net magnetic moment, so ferromagnetism occurs only in materials with partially filled shells. Because of Hund&#x27;s rules, the first few electrons in an otherwise unoccupied shell tend to have the same spin, thereby increasing the total dipole moment.

These unpaired dipoles (often called simply &quot;spins&quot;, even though they also generally include orbital angular momentum) tend to align in parallel to an external magnetic field leading to a macroscopic effect called paramagnetism. In ferromagnetism, however, the magnetic interaction between neighboring atoms&#x27; magnetic dipoles is strong enough that they align with &quot;each other&quot; regardless of any applied field, resulting in the spontaneous magnetization of so-called domains. This results in the large observed magnetic permeability of ferromagnetics, and the ability of magnetically hard materials to form permanent magnets.

===Exchange interaction===

When two nearby atoms have unpaired electrons, whether the electron spins are parallel or antiparallel affects whether the electrons can share the same orbit as a result of the quantum mechanical effect called the exchange interaction. This in turn affects the electron location and the Coulomb (electrostatic) interaction and thus the energy difference between these states.

The exchange interaction is related to the Pauli exclusion principle, which says that two electrons with the same spin cannot also be in the same spatial state (orbital). This is a consequence of the spin‚Äìstatistics theorem and that electrons are fermions. Therefore, under certain conditions, when the orbitals of the unpaired outer valence electrons from adjacent atoms overlap, the distributions of their electric charge in space are farther apart when the electrons have parallel spins than when they have opposite spins. This reduces the electrostatic energy of the electrons when their spins are parallel compared to their energy when the spins are antiparallel, so the parallel-spin state is more stable. This difference in energy is called the exchange energy. In simple terms, the outer electrons of adjacent atoms, which repel each other, can move further apart by aligning their spins in parallel, so the spins of these electrons tend to line up.

This energy difference can be orders of magnitude larger than the energy differences associated with the magnetic dipole‚Äìdipole interaction due to dipole orientation, which tends to align the dipoles antiparallel. In certain doped semiconductor oxides, RKKY interactions have been shown to bring about periodic longer-range magnetic interactions, a phenomenon of significance in the study of spintronic materials.

The materials in which the exchange interaction is much stronger than the competing dipole‚Äìdipole interaction are frequently called &quot;magnetic materials&quot;. For instance, in iron (Fe) the exchange force is about 1,000 times stronger than the dipole interaction. Therefore, below the Curie temperature, virtually all of the dipoles in a ferromagnetic material will be aligned. In addition to ferromagnetism, the exchange interaction is also responsible for the other types of spontaneous ordering of atomic magnetic moments occurring in magnetic solids: antiferromagnetism and ferrimagnetism. There are different exchange interaction mechanisms which create the magnetism in different ferromagnetic, ferrimagnetic, and antiferromagnetic substances‚Äîthese mechanisms include direct exchange, RKKY exchange, double exchange, and superexchange.

===Magnetic anisotropy===
Although the exchange interaction keeps spins aligned, it does not align them in a particular direction. Without magnetic anisotropy, the spins in a magnet randomly change direction in response to thermal fluctuations, and the magnet is superparamagnetic. There are several kinds of magnetic anisotropy, the most common of which is magnetocrystalline anisotropy. This is a dependence of the energy on the direction of magnetization relative to the crystallographic lattice. Another common source of anisotropy, inverse magnetostriction, is induced by internal strains. Single-domain magnets also can have a &quot;shape anisotropy&quot; due to the magnetostatic effects of the particle shape. As the temperature of a magnet increases, the anisotropy tends to decrease, and there is often a blocking temperature at which a transition to superparamagnetism occurs.

===Magnetic domains===


The spontaneous alignment of magnetic dipoles in ferromagnetic materials would seem to suggest that every piece of ferromagnetic material should have a strong magnetic field, since all the spins are aligned; yet iron and other ferromagnets are often found in an &quot;unmagnetized&quot; state. This is because a bulk piece of ferromagnetic material is divided into tiny regions called &quot;magnetic domains&quot; (also known as &quot;Weiss domains&quot;). Within each domain, the spins are aligned, but if the bulk material is in its lowest energy configuration (i.e. &quot;unmagnetized&quot;), the spins of separate domains point in different directions and their magnetic fields cancel out, so the bulk material has no net large-scale magnetic field.

Ferromagnetic materials spontaneously divide into magnetic domains because the exchange interaction is a short-range force, so over long distances of many atoms, the tendency of the magnetic dipoles to reduce their energy by orienting in opposite directions wins out. If all the dipoles in a piece of ferromagnetic material are aligned parallel, it creates a large magnetic field extending into the space around it. This contains a lot of magnetostatic energy. The material can reduce this energy by splitting into many domains pointing in different directions, so the magnetic field is confined to small local fields in the material, reducing the volume of the field. The domains are separated by thin domain walls a number of molecules thick, in which the direction of magnetization of the dipoles rotates smoothly from one domain&#x27;s direction to the other.

===Magnetized materials===
Thus, a piece of iron in its lowest energy state (&quot;unmagnetized&quot;) generally has little or no net magnetic field. However, the magnetic domains in a material are not fixed in place; they are simply regions where the spins of the electrons have aligned spontaneously due to their magnetic fields, and thus can be altered by an external magnetic field. If a strong-enough external magnetic field is applied to the material, the domain walls will move via a process in which the spins of the electrons in atoms near the wall in one domain turn under the influence of the external field to face in the same direction as the electrons in the other domain, thus reorienting the domains so more of the dipoles are aligned with the external field. The domains will remain aligned when the external field is removed, and sum to create a magnetic field of their own extending into the space around the material, thus creating a &quot;permanent&quot; magnet. The domains do not go back to their original minimum energy configuration when the field is removed because the domain walls tend to become &#x27;pinned&#x27; or &#x27;snagged&#x27; on defects in the crystal lattice, preserving their parallel orientation. This is shown by the Barkhausen effect: as the magnetizing field is changed, the material&#x27;s magnetization changes in thousands of tiny discontinuous jumps as domain walls suddenly &quot;snap&quot; past defects.

This magnetization as a function of an external field is described by a hysteresis curve. Although this state of aligned domains found in a piece of magnetized ferromagnetic material is not a minimal-energy configuration, it is metastable, and can persist for long periods, as shown by samples of magnetite from the sea floor which have maintained their magnetization for millions of years.

Heating and then cooling (annealing) a magnetized material, subjecting it to vibration by hammering it, or applying a rapidly oscillating magnetic field from a degaussing coil tends to release the domain walls from their pinned state, and the domain boundaries tend to move back to a lower energy configuration with less external magnetic field, thus demagnetizing the material.

Commercial magnets are made of &quot;hard&quot; ferromagnetic or ferrimagnetic materials with very large magnetic anisotropy such as alnico and ferrites, which have a very strong tendency for the magnetization to be pointed along one axis of the crystal, the &quot;easy axis&quot;. During manufacture the materials are subjected to various metallurgical processes in a powerful magnetic field, which aligns the crystal grains so their &quot;easy&quot; axes of magnetization all point in the same direction. Thus, the magnetization, and the resulting magnetic field, is &quot;built in&quot; to the crystal structure of the material, making it very difficult to demagnetize.

===Curie temperature===

As the temperature of a material increases, thermal motion, or entropy, competes with the ferromagnetic tendency for dipoles to align. When the temperature rises beyond a certain point, called the Curie temperature, there is a second-order phase transition and the system can no longer maintain a spontaneous magnetization, so its ability to be magnetized or attracted to a magnet disappears, although it still responds paramagnetically to an external field. Below that temperature, there is a spontaneous symmetry breaking and magnetic moments become aligned with their neighbors. The Curie temperature itself is a critical point, where the magnetic susceptibility is theoretically infinite and, although there is no net magnetization, domain-like spin correlations fluctuate at all length scales.

The study of ferromagnetic phase transitions, especially via the simplified Ising spin model, had an important impact on the development of statistical physics. There, it was first clearly shown that mean field theory approaches failed to predict the correct behavior at the critical point (which was found to fall under a &quot;universality class&quot; that includes many other systems, such as liquid-gas transitions), and had to be replaced by renormalization group theory.
