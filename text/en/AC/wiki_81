<text>Humphrey DeForest Bogart ( ; December 25, 1899 – January 14, 1957), nicknamed Bogie, was an American actor. His performances in classic Hollywood cinema made him an American cultural icon. In 1999, the American Film Institute selected Bogart as the greatest male star of classic American cinema.

Bogart began acting in Broadway shows. Debuting in film in &quot;The Dancing Town&quot; (1928), he appeared in supporting roles for more than a decade, regularly portraying gangsters. He was praised for his work as Duke Mantee in &quot;The Petrified Forest&quot; (1936). Bogart also received positive reviews for his performance as gangster Hugh &quot;Baby Face&quot; Martin in William Wyler&#x27;s &quot;Dead End&quot; (1937).

His breakthrough came in &quot;High Sierra&quot; (1941), and he catapulted to stardom as the lead in John Huston&#x27;s &quot;The Maltese Falcon&quot; (1941), considered one of the first great &quot;noir&quot; films. Bogart&#x27;s private detectives, Sam Spade (in &quot;The Maltese Falcon&quot;) and Philip Marlowe (in 1946&#x27;s &quot;The Big Sleep&quot;), became the models for detectives in other &quot;noir&quot; films. In 1947, he played a war hero in another &quot;noir&quot;, &quot;Dead Reckoning&quot;, tangled in a dangerous web of brutality and violence as he investigates his friend&#x27;s murder, co-starring Lizabeth Scott. His first romantic lead role was a memorable one, as Rick Blaine, paired with Ingrid Bergman as Ilsa Lund in &quot;Casablanca&quot; (1942). Blaine was ranked as the fourth greatest hero of American cinema by the American Film Institute, and Blaine and Lund&#x27;s romance the greatest love story in American cinema, also by the American Film Institute. Raymond Chandler, in a 1946 letter, wrote that &quot;Like Edward G. Robinson when he was younger, all he has to do to dominate a scene is to enter it.&quot;

44-year-old Bogart and 19-year-old Lauren Bacall fell in love during the filming of &quot;To Have and Have Not&quot; (1944). In 1945, a few months after principal photography for &quot;The Big Sleep&quot;, their second film together, he divorced his third wife and married Bacall. After their marriage, they played each other&#x27;s love interest in the mystery thrillers &quot;Dark Passage&quot; (1947) and &quot;Key Largo&quot; (1948). Bogart&#x27;s performances in Huston&#x27;s &quot;The Treasure of the Sierra Madre&quot; (1948) and Nicholas Ray&#x27;s &quot;In a Lonely Place&quot; (1950) are now considered among his best, although they were not recognized as such when the films were released. He reprised those unsettled, unstable characters as a World War II naval-vessel commander in &quot;The Caine Mutiny&quot; (1954), which was a critical and commercial hit and earned him another Best Actor nomination. He won the Academy Award for Best Actor for his portrayal of a cantankerous river steam launch skipper opposite Katharine Hepburn&#x27;s missionary in the World War I African adventure &quot;The African Queen&quot; (1951), another collaboration with Huston. Other significant roles in his later years included &quot;The Barefoot Contessa&quot; (1954) with Ava Gardner and his on-screen competition with William Holden for Audrey Hepburn in &quot;Sabrina&quot; (1954).

A heavy smoker and drinker, Bogart died from esophageal cancer in January 1957. Four films he starred in, &quot;Casablanca&quot;, &quot;The Maltese Falcon&quot;, &quot;The Treasure of the Sierra Madre&quot; and &quot;The African Queen&quot;, made the American Film Institute&#x27;s 1998 list of the greatest American movies of all time, with &quot;Casablanca&quot; ranked second. Regarding her husband&#x27;s enduring popularity, Bacall later said, &quot;There was something that made him able to be a man of his own, and it showed through his work. There was also a purity, which is amazing considering the parts he played. Something solid too. I think as time goes by, we all believe less and less. Here was someone who believed in something.&quot;

== Early life and education ==
Humphrey DeForest Bogart was born on Christmas Day 1899 in New York City, the eldest child of Belmont DeForest Bogart and Maud Humphrey. Belmont was the only child of the unhappy marriage of Adam Welty Bogart (a Canandaigua, New York, innkeeper) and Julia Augusta Stiles, a wealthy heiress. The name &quot;Bogart&quot; derives from the Dutch surname &quot;Bogaert&quot;, meaning &quot;orchard&quot;. &quot;Boomgaard&quot; in modern Dutch means &quot;orchard&quot;; Bogaert is a very common Flemish surname. Belmont and Maud married in June 1898. He was a Presbyterian, of English and Dutch descent, and a descendant of Sarah Rapelje (the first female European Christian child born in New Netherland). Maud was an Episcopalian of English heritage and a descendant of &quot;Mayflower&quot; passenger John Howland. Humphrey was raised Episcopalian but was non-practicing for most of his adult life.

The date of Bogart&#x27;s birth has been disputed. Clifford McCarty wrote that Warner Bros. publicity department had altered it to January 23, 1900, &quot;to foster the view that a man born on Christmas Day couldn&#x27;t be as villainous as he appeared to be on screen&quot;. The &quot;corrected&quot; January birth date subsequently appeared—and in some cases, remains—in many otherwise-authoritative sources. According to biographers Ann M. Sperber and Eric Lax, Bogart always celebrated his birthday on December 25 and listed it on official records (including his marriage license).

Lauren Bacall wrote in her autobiography that Bogart&#x27;s birthday was always celebrated on Christmas Day, saying that he joked about being cheated out of a present every year. Sperber and Lax noted that a birth announcement in the &quot;Ontario County Times&quot; of January 10, 1900, rules out the possibility of a January 23 birth date; state and federal census records from 1900 also report a Christmas 1899 birth date. Bogart&#x27;s birth record confirms he was actually born on December 25, 1899.

Belmont, Bogart&#x27;s father, was a cardiopulmonary surgeon. Maud was a commercial illustrator who received her art training in New York and France, including study with James Abbott McNeill Whistler. She later became art director of the fashion magazine &quot;The Delineator&quot; and a militant suffragette. Maud used a drawing of baby Humphrey in an advertising campaign for Mellins Baby Food. She earned over $50,000 a year at the peak of her career – a very large sum of money at the time, and considerably more than her husband&#x27;s $20,000. The Bogarts lived in an Upper West Side apartment, and had a cottage on a 55-acre estate on Canandaigua Lake in upstate New York. When he was young, Bogart&#x27;s group of friends at the lake would put on plays.

He had two younger sisters: Frances (&quot;Pat&quot;) and Catherine Elizabeth (&quot;Kay&quot;). Bogart&#x27;s parents were busy in their careers, and frequently fought. Very formal, they showed little emotion towards their children. Maud told her offspring to call her &quot;Maud&quot; instead of &quot;Mother&quot;, and showed little, if any, physical affection for them. When she was pleased, she &quot;[c]lapped you on the shoulder, almost the way a man does&quot;, Bogart recalled. &quot;I was brought up very unsentimentally but very straightforwardly. A kiss, in our family, was an event. Our mother and father didn&#x27;t glug over my two sisters and me.&quot;

Bogart was teased as a boy for his curls, tidiness, the &quot;cute&quot; pictures his mother had him pose for, the Little Lord Fauntleroy clothes in which she dressed him, and for his first name. He inherited from his father a tendency to needle, a fondness for fishing, a lifelong love of boating, and an attraction to strong-willed women.

Bogart attended the private Delancey School until the fifth grade and then attended the prestigious Trinity School. He was an indifferent, sullen student who showed no interest in after-school activities. Bogart later attended Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts, a boarding school to which he was admitted based on family connections. Although his parents hoped that he would go on to Yale University, Bogart left Phillips in 1918 after one semester (although the Phillips Academy website claims he was in the graduating class of 1920). He failed four out of six classes. Several reasons have been given; according to one, he was expelled for throwing the headmaster (or a groundskeeper) into Rabbit Pond on campus. Another cited smoking, drinking, poor academic performance, and (possibly) inappropriate comments made to the staff. In a third scenario, Bogart was withdrawn by his father for failing to improve his grades. His parents were deeply disappointed in their failed plans for his future.

== Navy ==
With no viable career options, Bogart enlisted in the United States Navy in the spring of 1918, during World War I. He recalled later, &quot;At eighteen, war was great stuff. Paris! Sexy French girls! Hot damn!&quot; Bogart was recorded as a model sailor, who spent most of his sea time after the armistice ferrying troops back from Europe. Bogart left the service on June 18, 1919, at the rank of Petty Officer 2nd Class. During World War II, Bogart attempted to re-enlist in the Navy but was rejected due to his age. He then volunteered for the Coast Guard Temporary Reserve in 1944, patrolling the California coastline in his yacht, the &quot;Santana&quot;.

He may have received his trademark scar and developed his characteristic lisp during his naval stint. There are several conflicting stories. In one, his lip was cut by shrapnel when his ship (the ) was shelled. The ship was never shelled, however, and Bogart may not have been at sea before the armistice. Another story, held by longtime friend Nathaniel Benchley, was that Bogart was injured while taking a prisoner to Portsmouth Naval Prison in Kittery, Maine. While changing trains in Boston, the handcuffed prisoner reportedly asked Bogart for a cigarette. When Bogart looked for a match, the prisoner smashed him across the mouth with the cuffs (cutting Bogart&#x27;s lip) and fled before being recaptured and imprisoned. In an alternative version, Bogart was struck in the mouth by a handcuff loosened while freeing his charge; the other handcuff was still around the prisoner&#x27;s wrist. By the time Bogart was treated by a doctor, a scar had formed. David Niven said that when he first asked Bogart about his scar, however, he said that it was caused by a childhood accident. &quot;Goddamn doctor&quot;, Bogart later told Niven. &quot;Instead of stitching it up, he screwed it up.&quot; According to Niven, the stories that Bogart got the scar during wartime were made up by the studios. His post-service physical did not mention the lip scar, although it noted many smaller scars. When actress Louise Brooks met Bogart in 1924, he had scar tissue on his upper lip which Brooks said Bogart may have had partially repaired before entering the film industry in 1930. Brooks said that his &quot;lip wound gave him no speech impediment, either before or after it was mended.&quot;

== Acting ==
=== First performances ===
Bogart returned home to find his father in poor health, his medical practice faltering, and much of the family&#x27;s wealth lost in bad timber investments. His character and values developed separately from his family during his navy days, and he began to rebel. Bogart became a liberal who disliked pretension, phonies and snobs, sometimes defying conventional behavior and authority; he was also well-mannered, articulate, punctual, self-effacing and standoffish. After his naval service, he worked as a shipper and a bond salesman, joining the Coast Guard Reserve.

Frank Kelly Rich writes that Bogart &quot;dove headfirst into the Jazz Age lifestyle, always up for late night revels... When his meager wages were exhausted, he&#x27;d play chess against all comers in arcades for a dollar a match (he was a brilliant player) to fund his outings.&quot; Mike Doyle of Chess.com writes that &quot;Before he made any money from acting, he would hustle players for dimes and quarters, playing in New York parks and at Coney Island.&quot; Bogart resumed his friendship with Bill Brady Jr. (whose father had show-business connections), and obtained an office job with William A. Brady&#x27;s new World Films company. Although he wanted to try his hand at screenwriting, directing, and production, he excelled at none. Bogart was stage manager for Brady&#x27;s daughter Alice&#x27;s play &quot;A Ruined Lady&quot;. He made his stage debut a few months later as a Japanese butler in Alice&#x27;s 1921 play &quot;Drifting&quot; (nervously delivering one line of dialogue), and appeared in several of her subsequent plays.

Although Bogart had been raised to believe that acting was a lowly profession, he liked the late hours actors kept and the attention they received: &quot;I was born to be indolent and this was the softest of rackets.&quot; He spent much of his free time in speakeasies, drinking heavily. A bar-room brawl at this time was also a purported cause of Bogart&#x27;s lip damage, dovetailing with Louise Brooks&#x27; account.

Preferring to learn by doing, he never took acting lessons. Bogart was persistent and worked steadily at his craft, appearing in at least 18 Broadway productions between 1922 and 1935, 11 of which were comedies. He played juveniles or romantic supporting roles in drawing-room comedies and is reportedly the first actor to say, &quot;Tennis, anyone?&quot; on stage. According to Alexander Woollcott, Bogart &quot;is what is usually and mercifully described as inadequate.&quot; Other critics were kinder. Heywood Broun, reviewing &quot;Nerves&quot;, wrote: &quot;Humphrey Bogart gives the most effective performance ... both dry and fresh, if that be possible&quot;. He played a juvenile lead (reporter Gregory Brown) in Lynn Starling&#x27;s comedy &quot;Meet the Wife&quot;, which had a successful 232-performance run at the Klaw Theatre from November 1923 through July 1924. Bogart disliked his trivial, effeminate early-career parts, calling them &quot;White Pants Willie&quot; roles.

While playing a double role in &quot;Drifting&quot; at the Playhouse Theatre in 1922, he met actress Helen Menken; they were married on May 20, 1926, at the Gramercy Park Hotel in New York City. Divorced on November 18, 1927, they remained friends. Menken said in her divorce filing that Bogart valued his career more than marriage, citing neglect and abuse. He married actress Mary Philips on April 3, 1928, at her mother&#x27;s apartment in Hartford, Connecticut; Bogart and Philips had worked together in the play &quot;Nerves&quot; during its brief run at the Comedy Theatre in 1924.

Theatrical production dropped off sharply after the Wall Street Crash of 1929, and many of the more-photogenic actors headed for Hollywood. Bogart debuted on film with Helen Hayes in the 1928 two-reeler &quot;The Dancing Town&quot;, which survives intact. He also appeared with Joan Blondell and Ruth Etting in a Vitaphone short, &quot;Broadway&#x27;s Like That&quot; (1930), which was rediscovered in 1963.

=== Broadway to Hollywood ===

Bogart signed a contract with the Fox Film Corporation for $750 a week. There he met Spencer Tracy, a Broadway actor whom Bogart liked and admired, and the two men became close friends and drinking companions. In 1930, Tracy first called him &quot;Bogie&quot;. Tracy made his feature film debut in his only movie with Bogart, John Ford&#x27;s early sound film &quot;Up the River&quot; (1930), in which their leading roles were as inmates. Tracy received top billing, but Bogart&#x27;s picture appeared on the film&#x27;s posters. He was billed fourth behind Tracy, Claire Luce and Warren Hymer but his role was almost as large as Tracy&#x27;s and much larger than Luce&#x27;s or Hymer&#x27;s. A quarter of a century later, the two men planned to make &quot;The Desperate Hours&quot; together. Both insisted upon top billing, however; Tracy dropped out, and was replaced by Fredric March.

Bogart then had a supporting role in &quot;Bad Sister&quot; (1931) with Bette Davis. Bogart shuttled back and forth between Hollywood and the New York stage from 1930 to 1935, out of work for long periods. His parents had separated; his father died in 1934 in debt, which Bogart eventually paid off. He inherited his father&#x27;s gold ring, which he wore in many of his films. At his father&#x27;s deathbed, Bogart finally told him how much he loved him. Bogart&#x27;s second marriage was rocky; dissatisfied with his acting career, depressed and irritable, he drank heavily.

=== In Hollywood permanently: &quot;The Petrified Forest&quot; ===

In 1934, Bogart starred in the Broadway play &quot;Invitation to a Murder&quot; at the Theatre Masque (renamed the John Golden Theatre in 1937). Its producer, Arthur Hopkins, heard the play from offstage; he sent for Bogart and offered him the role of escaped murderer Duke Mantee in Robert E. Sherwood&#x27;s forthcoming play, &quot;The Petrified Forest&quot;. Hopkins later recalled:

The play had 197 performances at the Broadhurst Theatre in New York in 1935. Although Leslie Howard was the star, &quot;The New York Times&quot; critic Brooks Atkinson said that the play was &quot;a peach ... a roaring Western melodrama ... Humphrey Bogart does the best work of his career as an actor.&quot; Bogart said that the play &quot;marked my deliverance from the ranks of the sleek, sybaritic, stiff-shirted, swallow-tailed &#x27;smoothies&#x27; to which I seemed condemned to life.&quot; However, he still felt insecure. Warner Bros. bought the screen rights to &quot;The Petrified Forest&quot; in 1935. The play seemed ideal for the studio, which was known for its socially-realistic pictures for a public entranced by real-life criminals such as John Dillinger and Dutch Schultz. Bette Davis and Leslie Howard were cast. Howard, who held the production rights, made it clear that he wanted Bogart to star with him.

The studio tested several Hollywood veterans for the Duke Mantee role and chose Edward G. Robinson, who had star appeal and was due to make a film to fulfill his contract. Bogart cabled news of this development to Howard in Scotland, who replied: &quot;Att: Jack Warner Insist Bogart Play Mantee No Bogart No Deal L.H.&quot;. When Warner Bros. saw that Howard would not budge, they gave in and cast Bogart. Jack Warner wanted Bogart to use a stage name but Bogart declined, having built a reputation with his name in Broadway theater. The film version of &quot;The Petrified Forest&quot; was released in 1936. According to &quot;Variety&quot;, &quot;Bogart&#x27;s menace leaves nothing wanting&quot;. Frank S. Nugent wrote for &quot;The New York Times&quot; that the actor &quot;can be a psychopathic gangster more like Dillinger than the outlaw himself&quot;. The film was successful at the box office, earning $500,000 in rentals, and made Bogart a star. He never forgot Howard&#x27;s favor and named his only daughter, Leslie Howard Bogart, after him in 1952.

=== Supporting gangster and villain roles ===
Despite his success in &quot;The Petrified Forest&quot; (an &quot;A movie&quot;), Bogart signed a tepid 26-week contract at $550 per week and was typecast as a gangster in a series of B movie crime dramas. Although he was proud of his success, the fact that it derived from gangster roles weighed on him: &quot;I can&#x27;t get in a mild discussion without turning it into an argument. There must be something in my tone of voice, or this arrogant face—something that antagonizes everybody. Nobody likes me on sight. I suppose that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m cast as the heavy.&quot;

In spite of his success, Warner Bros. had no interest in raising Bogart&#x27;s profile. His roles were repetitive and physically demanding; studios were not yet air-conditioned, and his tightly scheduled job at Warners was anything but the indolent and &quot;peachy&quot; actor&#x27;s life he hoped for. Although Bogart disliked the roles chosen for him, he worked steadily. &quot;In the first 34 pictures&quot; for Warner&#x27;s, he told journalist George Frazier, &quot;I was shot in 12, electrocuted or hanged in 8, and was a jailbird in 9&quot;. He averaged a film every two months between 1936 and 1940, sometimes working on two films at the same time. Bogart used these years to begin developing his film persona: a wounded, stoical, cynical, charming, vulnerable, self-mocking loner with a code of honor.

Amenities at Warners were few, compared to the prestigious Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. Bogart thought that the Warners wardrobe department was cheap, and often wore his own suits in his films. He chose his own dog named Zero, to play Pard (his character&#x27;s dog) in &quot;High Sierra&quot;. His disputes with Warner Bros. over roles and money were similar to those waged by the studio with more established and less malleable stars such as Bette Davis and James Cagney.

Leading men at Warner Bros. included George Raft, James Cagney and Edward G. Robinson. Most of the studio&#x27;s better scripts went to them or others, leaving Bogart with what was left: films like &quot;San Quentin&quot; (1937), &quot;Racket Busters&quot; (1938), and &quot;You Can&#x27;t Get Away with Murder&quot; (1939). His only leading role during this period was in &quot;Dead End&quot; (1937, on loan to Samuel Goldwyn), as a gangster modeled after Baby Face Nelson.

Bogart played violent roles so often that in Nevil Shute&#x27;s 1939 novel, &quot;What Happened to the Corbetts&quot;, the protagonist replies &quot;I&#x27;ve seen Humphrey Bogart with one often enough&quot; when asked if he knows how to operate an automatic weapon. Although he played a variety of supporting roles in films such as &quot;Angels with Dirty Faces&quot; (1938), Bogart&#x27;s roles were either rivals of characters played by Cagney and Robinson or a secondary member of their gang. In &quot;Black Legion&quot; (1937), a movie Graham Greene described as &quot;intelligent and exciting, if rather earnest&quot;, he played a good man who was caught up with (and destroyed by) a racist organization.

The studio cast Bogart as a wrestling promoter in &quot;Swing Your Lady&quot; (1938), a &quot;hillbilly musical&quot; which he reportedly considered his worst film performance. He played a rejuvenated, formerly-dead scientist in &quot;The Return of Doctor X&quot; (1939), his only horror film: &quot;If it&#x27;d been Jack Warner&#x27;s blood ... I wouldn&#x27;t have minded so much. The trouble was they were drinking mine and I was making this stinking movie.&quot; His wife, Mary, had a stage hit in &quot;A Touch of Brimstone&quot; and refused to abandon her Broadway career for Hollywood. After the play closed, Mary relented; she insisted on continuing her career, however, and they divorced in 1937.
On August 21, 1938, Bogart entered a turbulent third marriage to actress Mayo Methot, a lively, friendly woman when sober but paranoid and aggressive when drunk. She became convinced that Bogart was unfaithful to her (which he eventually was, with Lauren Bacall, while filming &quot;To Have and Have Not&quot; in 1944). They drifted apart; Methot&#x27;s drinking increased, and she threw plants, crockery and other objects at Bogart. She set their house afire, stabbed him with a knife, and slashed her wrists several times. Bogart needled her; apparently enjoying confrontation, he was sometimes violent as well. The press called them &quot;the Battling Bogarts&quot;.

According to their friend, Julius Epstein, &quot;The Bogart-Methot marriage was the sequel to the Civil War&quot;. Bogart bought a motor launch which he named &quot;Sluggy,&quot; his nickname for Methot: &quot;I like a jealous wife .. We get on so well together (because) we don&#x27;t have illusions about each other ... I wouldn&#x27;t give you two cents for a dame without a temper.&quot; Louise Brooks said that &quot;except for Leslie Howard, no one contributed as much to Humphrey&#x27;s success as his third wife, Mayo Methot.&quot; Methot&#x27;s influence was increasingly destructive, however, and Bogart also continued to drink.

He had a lifelong disdain for pretension and phoniness, and was again irritated by his inferior films. Bogart rarely watched his own films and avoided premieres, issuing fake press releases about his private life to satisfy journalistic and public curiosity. When he thought an actor, director or studio had done something shoddy, he spoke up publicly about it. Bogart advised Robert Mitchum that the only way to stay alive in Hollywood was to be an &quot;againster&quot;. He was not the most popular of actors, and some in the Hollywood community shunned him privately to avoid trouble with the studios. Bogart once said,
The Hollywood press, unaccustomed to such candor, was delighted.

=== Early stardom ===

==== &quot;High Sierra&quot; ====

&quot;High Sierra&quot; (1941, directed by Raoul Walsh) featured a screenplay written by John Huston, Bogart&#x27;s friend and drinking partner, adapted from a novel by W. R. Burnett, author of the novel on which &quot;Little Caesar&quot; was based. Paul Muni, George Raft, Cagney and Robinson turned down the lead role, giving Bogart the opportunity to play a character with some depth. Walsh initially opposed Bogart&#x27;s casting, preferring Raft for the part. It was Bogart&#x27;s last major film as a gangster; a supporting role followed in &quot;The Big Shot&quot;, released in 1942. He worked well with Ida Lupino, sparking jealousy from Mayo Methot.

The film cemented a strong personal and professional connection between Bogart and Huston. Bogart admired (and somewhat envied) Huston for his skill as a writer; a poor student, Bogart was a lifelong reader. He could quote Plato, Alexander Pope, Ralph Waldo Emerson and over a thousand lines of Shakespeare, and subscribed to the &quot;Harvard Law Review&quot;. Bogart admired writers; some of his best friends were screenwriters, including Louis Bromfield, Nathaniel Benchley, and Nunnally Johnson. He enjoyed intense, provocative conversation (accompanied by stiff drinks), as did Huston. Both were rebellious and enjoyed playing childish pranks. Huston was reportedly easily bored during production and admired Bogart (also bored easily off-camera) for his acting talent and his intense concentration on-set.

==== &quot;The Maltese Falcon&quot; ====

Now regarded as a classic film noir, &quot;The Maltese Falcon&quot; (1941) was John Huston&#x27;s directorial debut. Based on the Dashiell Hammett novel, it was first serialized in the pulp magazine &quot;Black Mask&quot; in 1929 and was the basis of two earlier film versions; the second was &quot;Satan Met a Lady&quot; (1936), starring Bette Davis. Producer Hal B. Wallis initially offered to cast George Raft as the leading man, but Raft (then better known than Bogart) had a contract stipulating he was not required to appear in remakes. Fearing that it would be nothing more than a sanitized version of the pre-Production Code &quot;The Maltese Falcon&quot; (1931), Raft turned down the role to make &quot;Manpower&quot; with director Raoul Walsh, with whom he had worked on &quot;The Bowery&quot; in 1933. Huston then eagerly accepted Bogart as his Sam Spade.

Complementing Bogart were co-stars Sydney Greenstreet, Peter Lorre, Elisha Cook Jr., and Mary Astor as the treacherous female foil. Bogart&#x27;s sharp timing and facial expressions were praised by the cast and director as vital to the film&#x27;s quick action and rapid-fire dialogue. It was a commercial hit, and a major triumph for Huston. Bogart was unusually happy with the film: &quot;It is practically a masterpiece. I don&#x27;t have many things I&#x27;m proud of ... but that&#x27;s one&quot;.

==== &quot;Casablanca&quot; ====

Bogart played his first romantic lead in &quot;Casablanca&quot; (1942): Rick Blaine, an expatriate nightclub owner hiding from a suspicious past and negotiating a fine line among Nazis, the French underground, the Vichy prefect and unresolved feelings for his ex-girlfriend. Bosley Crowther wrote in his November 1942 &quot;New York Times&quot; review that Bogart&#x27;s character was used &quot;to inject a cold point of tough resistance to evil forces afoot in Europe today&quot;. The film, directed by Michael Curtiz and produced by Hal Wallis, featured Ingrid Bergman, Claude Rains, Sydney Greenstreet, Paul Henreid, Conrad Veidt, Peter Lorre and Dooley Wilson.

Bogart and Bergman&#x27;s on-screen relationship was based on professionalism rather than actual rapport, although Mayo Methot assumed otherwise. Off the set, the co-stars hardly spoke. Bergman (who had a reputation for affairs with her leading men) later said about Bogart, &quot;I kissed him but I never knew him.&quot; Because she was taller, Bogart had blocks attached to his shoes in some scenes.

Bogart is reported to have been responsible for the notion that Rick Blaine should be portrayed as a chess player, a metaphor for the relationships he maintained with friends, enemies, and allies. He played tournament-level chess (one division below master) in real life, often enjoying games with crew members and cast but finding his better in Paul Henreid. During the production, Bogart also began playing games of correspondence chess against American G.I.s through mail. The series of long distance matches began after a private who Bogart versed on set was transferred to the South Pacific. The letters began to be intercepted by the FBI due to fears the algebraic notation used in chess games was actually an encrypted message.

&quot;Casablanca&quot; won the Academy Award for Best Picture at the 16th Academy Awards for 1943. Bogart was nominated for Best Actor in a Leading Role, but lost to Paul Lukas for his performance in &quot;Watch on the Rhine&quot;. The film vaulted Bogart from fourth place to first in the studio&#x27;s roster, however, finally overtaking James Cagney. He more than doubled his annual salary to over $460,000 by 1946, making him the world&#x27;s highest-paid actor.

Bogart went on United Service Organizations and War Bond tours with Methot in 1943 and 1944, making arduous trips to Italy and North Africa (including Casablanca). He was still required to perform in films with weak scripts, leading to conflicts with the front office. He starred in &quot;Conflict&quot; (1945, again with Greenstreet), but turned down &quot;God Is My Co-Pilot&quot; that year.

=== Bogie and Bacall ===

==== &quot;To Have and Have Not&quot; ====

Howard Hawks introduced Bogart and Lauren Bacall while Bogart was filming &quot;Passage to Marseille&quot; (1944). The three subsequently collaborated on &quot;To Have and Have Not&quot; (1944), a loose adaptation of the Ernest Hemingway novel, and Bacall&#x27;s film debut. It has several similarities to &quot;Casablanca&quot;: the same kind of hero and enemies, and a piano player (portrayed this time by Hoagy Carmichael) as a supporting character. When they met, Bacall was 19 and Bogart 44; he nicknamed her &quot;Baby&quot;. A model since age 16, she had appeared in two failed plays. Bogart was attracted by Bacall&#x27;s high cheekbones, green eyes, tawny blond hair, lean body, maturity, poise and earthy, outspoken honesty; he reportedly said, &quot;I just saw your test. We&#x27;ll have a lot of fun together&quot;.

Their emotional bond was strong from the start, their difference in age and acting-experience encouraged a mentor-student dynamic. In contrast to the Hollywood norm, their affair was Bogart&#x27;s first with a leading lady. His early meetings with Bacall were discreet and brief, their separations bridged by love letters. The relationship made it easier for Bacall to make her first film, and Bogart did his best to put her at ease with jokes and quiet coaching. He encouraged her to steal scenes; Howard Hawks also did his best to highlight her role, and found Bogart easy to direct.

However, Hawks began to disapprove of the relationship. He considered himself Bacall&#x27;s protector and mentor, and Bogart was usurping that role. Not usually drawn to his starlets, the married director also fell for Bacall; he told her that she meant nothing to Bogart and threatened to send her to the poverty-row studio Monogram Pictures. Bogart calmed her down, and then went after Hawks; Jack Warner settled the dispute, and filming resumed. Hawks said about Bacall, &quot;Bogie fell in love with the character she played, so she had to keep playing it the rest of her life.&quot; However, Bacall wrote in her memoir about the love she and Bogart shared, &quot;No one has ever written a romance better than we lived it.&quot; and she said regarding Bogart&#x27;s personality, &quot;He was a very gentle soul. He was very strong, and very sure about what he believed in and what he thought was important and not important. He couldn&#x27;t be pushed around. But he was a gentle man. I was very, very lucky to have even met him, much less have been married to him. He had extraordinary gifts. He was much more of a complete individual than most people are. He had the kind of standards my mother had. Their values were very much the same. It was very interesting. He had tremendous character and a great sense of honor and would not tolerate lies, even if they asked him what he thought of a movie.&quot;

==== &quot;The Big Sleep&quot; ====

Months after wrapping &quot;To Have and Have Not&quot;, Bogart and Bacall were reunited for an encore: the film noir &quot;The Big Sleep&quot; (1946), based on the novel by Raymond Chandler with script help from William Faulkner. Chandler admired the actor&#x27;s performance: &quot;Bogart can be tough without a gun. Also, he has a sense of humor that contains that grating undertone of contempt.&quot; Although the film was completed and scheduled for release in 1945, it was withdrawn and re-edited to add scenes exploiting Bogart and Bacall&#x27;s box-office chemistry in &quot;To Have and Have Not&quot; and the publicity surrounding their offscreen relationship. At the insistence of director Howard Hawks, production partner Charles K. Feldman agreed to a rewrite of Bacall&#x27;s scenes to heighten the &quot;insolent&quot; quality which had intrigued critics such as James Agee and audiences of the earlier film, and a memo was sent to studio head Jack Warner.

The dialogue, especially in the added scenes supplied by Hawks, was full of sexual innuendo. The film was successful, although some critics found its plot confusing and overly complicated. According to Chandler, Hawks and Bogart argued about who killed the chauffeur; when Chandler received an inquiry by telegram, he could not provide an answer.

==== Marriage to Bacall ====

Bogart filed for divorce from Methot in February 1945. He and Bacall married in a small ceremony at the country home of Bogart&#x27;s close friend, Pulitzer Prize-winning author Louis Bromfield, at Malabar Farm (near Lucas, Ohio) on May 21, 1945. They moved into a $160,000 ($ in ) white brick mansion in an exclusive neighborhood of Los Angeles&#x27; Holmby Hills. At the time of the 1950 United States census, the couple was living at 2707 Benedict Canyon Drive in Beverly Hills with their son and nursemaid. Bacall is listed as Betty Bogart. The marriage was a mostly happy one but not without its troubles. Bogart&#x27;s drinking was sometimes problematic and he initially wasn&#x27;t happy about having his first child. He was a homebody, and Bacall liked the nightlife; he loved the sea, and it made her seasick. Bogart and Bacall both had affairs but they never stopped loving each other, a fact Bacall mentions throughout her memoir &quot;By Myself&quot;. In a 1997 &quot;Parade&quot; magazine cover story, she told reporter Dotson Rader that Bogart said &quot;&#x27;If you want a career more than anything, I will do everything I can to help you, and I will send you on your way, but I will not marry you. I&#x27;ve been through it, and I know it doesn&#x27;t work.&#x27; He was right. He loved me and wanted me with him. I made the deal, and I stuck to it, and I&#x27;m damn glad that I did.&quot;

Bogart bought the &quot;Santana&quot;, a sailing yacht, from actor Dick Powell in 1945. He found the sea a sanctuary and spent about thirty weekends a year on the water, with a particular fondness for sailing around Catalina Island: &quot;An actor needs something to stabilize his personality, something to nail down what he really is, not what he is currently pretending to be.&quot; Bogart joined the Coast Guard Temporary Reserve (a forerunner of the modern Coast Guard Auxiliary), offering the Coast Guard use of the &quot;Santana&quot;. He reportedly attempted to enlist, but was turned down due to his age.

==== &quot;Dark Passage&quot; and &quot;Key Largo&quot; ====

The suspenseful &quot;Dark Passage&quot; (1947) was Bogart and Bacall&#x27;s next collaboration. Vincent Parry (Bogart) is intent on finding the real murderer for a crime of which he was convicted and sentenced to prison. According to Bogart&#x27;s biographer, Stefan Kanfer, it was &quot;a production line film noir with no particular distinction&quot;.

Bogart and Bacall&#x27;s last pairing in a film was in &quot;Key Largo&quot; (1948). Directed by John Huston, Edward G. Robinson was billed second (behind Bogart) as gangster Johnny Rocco: a seething, older synthesis of many of his early bad-guy roles. The billing question was hard-fought and at the end of at least one of the trailers, Robinson is listed above Bogart in a list of the actors&#x27; names in the last frame; and in the film itself, Robinson&#x27;s name, appearing between Bogart&#x27;s and Bacall&#x27;s, is pictured slightly higher onscreen than the other two. Robinson had top billing over Bogart in their four previous films together: &quot;Bullets or Ballots&quot; (1936), &quot;Kid Galahad&quot; (1937), &quot;The Amazing Dr. Clitterhouse&quot; (1938) and &quot;Brother Orchid&quot; (1940). In some posters for &quot;Key Largo&quot;, Robinson&#x27;s picture is substantially larger than Bogart&#x27;s, and in the foreground manhandling Bacall while Bogart is in the background. The characters are trapped during a hurricane in a hotel owned by Bacall&#x27;s father-in-law, portrayed by Lionel Barrymore. Claire Trevor won an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her performance as Rocco&#x27;s physically abused, alcoholic girlfriend.

=== Later career ===

==== &quot;The Treasure of the Sierra Madre&quot; ====

Riding high in 1947 with a new 15-year contract with Warners which provided limited script refusal and the right to form his own production company, Bogart rejoined with John Huston for &quot;The Treasure of the Sierra Madre&quot;: a stark tale of greed among three gold prospectors in Mexico. Lacking a love interest or a happy ending, it was considered a risky project. Bogart later said about co-star (and John Huston&#x27;s father) Walter Huston, &quot;He&#x27;s probably the only performer in Hollywood to whom I&#x27;d gladly lose a scene.&quot;

The film was shot in the heat of summer for greater realism and atmosphere and was grueling to make. James Agee wrote, &quot;Bogart does a wonderful job with this character ... miles ahead of the very good work he has done before.&quot; Although John Huston won the Academy Award for Best Director and screenplay and his father won the Best Supporting Actor award, the film had mediocre box-office results. Bogart complained, &quot;An intelligent script, beautifully directed—something different—and the public turned a cold shoulder on it.&quot;

==== House Un-American Activities Committee ====
Bogart, a liberal Democrat, organized the Committee for the First Amendment (a delegation to Washington, D.C.) opposing what he saw as the House Un-American Activities Committee&#x27;s harassment of Hollywood screenwriters and actors. He later wrote an article, &quot;I&#x27;m No Communist&quot;, for the March 1948 issue of &quot;Photoplay&quot; magazine distancing himself from the Hollywood Ten to counter negative publicity resulting from his appearance. Bogart wrote, &quot;The ten men cited for contempt by the House Un-American Activities Committee were not defended by us.&quot;

==== Santana Productions ====
Bogart created his film company, Santana Productions (named after his yacht and the cabin cruiser in &quot;Key Largo&quot;), in 1948. The right to create his own company had left Jack Warner furious, fearful that other stars would do the same and further erode the major studios&#x27; power. In addition to pressure from freelancing actors such as Bogart, James Stewart, and Henry Fonda, they were beginning to buckle from the impact of television and the enforcement of antitrust laws which broke up theater chains. Bogart&#x27;s new contract with Warners had required him to make one film a year for Warners but he only made &quot;Chain Lightning&quot; (1950) and &quot;The Enforcer&quot; (1951) for them during the contract period. In 1953, his contract with Warners was dissolved by mutual consent.
Except for &quot;Beat the Devil&quot; (1953), originally distributed in the United States by United Artists, the company released its films through Columbia Pictures; Columbia re-released &quot;Beat the Devil&quot; a decade later. In quick succession, Bogart starred in &quot;Knock on Any Door&quot; (1949), &quot;Tokyo Joe&quot; (1949), &quot;In a Lonely Place&quot; (1950), and &quot;Sirocco&quot; (1951). Santana also made two films without him: &quot;And Baby Makes Three&quot; (1949) and &quot;The Family Secret&quot; (1951).

Although most lost money at the box office (ultimately forcing Santana&#x27;s sale), at least two retain a reputation; &quot;In a Lonely Place&quot; is considered a film-noir high point. Bogart plays Dixon Steele, an embittered writer with a violent reputation who is the primary suspect in the murder of a young woman and falls in love with failed actress Laurel Gray (Gloria Grahame). Several Bogart biographers, and actress-writer Louise Brooks, have felt that this role is closest to the real Bogart. According to Brooks, the film &quot;gave him a role that he could play with complexity, because the film character&#x27;s pride in his art, his selfishness, drunkenness, lack of energy stabbed with lightning strokes of violence were shared by the real Bogart&quot;. The character mimics some of Bogart&#x27;s personal habits, twice ordering the actor&#x27;s favorite meal (ham and eggs).

A parody of sorts of &quot;The Maltese Falcon&quot;, &quot;Beat the Devil&quot; was the final film for Bogart and John Huston. Co-written by Truman Capote, the eccentrically filmed story follows an amoral group of rogues, one of whom was portrayed by Peter Lorre, chasing an unattainable treasure. Bogart sold his interest in Santana to Columbia for over $1 million in 1955.

==== &quot;The African Queen&quot; ====
Outside Santana Productions, Bogart starred with Katharine Hepburn in the John Huston-directed &quot;The African Queen&quot; in 1951. The C. S. Forester novel on which it was based was overlooked and left undeveloped for 15 years until producer Sam Spiegel and Huston bought the rights. Spiegel sent Katharine Hepburn the book; she suggested Bogart for the male lead, believing that &quot;he was the only man who could have played that part&quot;. Huston&#x27;s love of adventure, his deep, longstanding friendship (and success) with Bogart, and the chance to work with Hepburn convinced the actor to leave Hollywood for a difficult shoot on location in the Belgian Congo. Bogart was to get 30 percent of the profits and Hepburn 10 percent, plus a relatively small salary for both. The stars met in London and announced that they would work together.

Bacall came for the over-four-month duration, leaving their young son in Los Angeles. The Bogarts began the trip with a junket through Europe, including a visit with Pope Pius XII. Bacall later made herself useful as a cook, nurse and clothes washer; her husband said: &quot;I don&#x27;t know what we&#x27;d have done without her. She Luxed my undies in darkest Africa.&quot; Nearly everyone in the cast developed dysentery except Bogart and Huston, who subsisted on canned food and alcohol; Bogart said, &quot;All I ate was baked beans, canned asparagus and Scotch whisky. Whenever a fly bit Huston or me, it dropped dead.&quot; Hepburn (a teetotaler) fared worse in the difficult conditions, losing weight and at one point becoming very ill. Bogart resisted Huston&#x27;s insistence on using real leeches in a key scene where Charlie has to drag his steam launch through an infested marsh, and reasonable fakes were employed. The crew overcame illness, army-ant infestations, leaky boats, poor food, attacking hippos, poor water filters, extreme heat, isolation, and a boat fire to complete the film. Despite the discomfort of jumping from the boat into swamps, rivers and marshes, &quot;The African Queen&quot; apparently rekindled Bogart&#x27;s early love of boats; when he returned to California, he bought a classic mahogany Hacker-Craft runabout which he kept until his death.

His performance as cantankerous skipper Charlie Allnut earned Bogart an Academy Award for Best Actor in 1951 (his only award of three nominations), and he considered it the best of his film career. Promising friends that if he won his speech would break the convention of thanking everyone in sight, Bogart advised Claire Trevor when she was nominated for &quot;Key Largo&quot; to &quot;just say you did it all yourself and don&#x27;t thank anyone&quot;. When Bogart won, however, he said: &quot;It&#x27;s a long way from the Belgian Congo to the stage of this theatre. It&#x27;s nicer to be here. Thank you very much ... No one does it alone. As in tennis, you need a good opponent or partner to bring out the best in you. John and Katie helped me to be where I am now.&quot; Despite the award and its accompanying recognition, Bogart later said: &quot;The way to survive an Oscar is never to try to win another one ... too many stars ... win it and then figure they have to top themselves ... they become afraid to take chances. The result: A lot of dull performances in dull pictures.&quot; &quot;The African Queen&quot; was Bogart&#x27;s first starring Technicolor role.

==== &quot;The Caine Mutiny&quot; ====

Bogart dropped his asking price to obtain the role of Captain Queeg in Edward Dmytryk&#x27;s drama, &quot;The Caine Mutiny&quot; (1954). Though he retained some of his old bitterness about having to do so, he delivered a strong performance in the lead; he received his final Oscar nomination and was the subject of a June 7, 1954, &quot;Time&quot; magazine cover story.

Despite his success, Bogart was still melancholy; he grumbled to (and feuded with) the studio, while his health began to deteriorate. Like his portrayal of Fred C. Dobbs in &quot;The Treasure of the Sierra Madre&quot;, Bogart&#x27;s Queeg is a paranoid, self-pitying character whose small-mindedness eventually destroys him. Henry Fonda played a different role in the Broadway version of &quot;The Caine Mutiny&quot;, generating publicity for the film.

==== Final roles ====
For &quot;Sabrina&quot; (1954), Billy Wilder wanted Cary Grant for the older male lead but chose Bogart to play the conservative brother who competes with his younger, playboy sibling (William Holden) for the affection of the Cinderella-like Sabrina (Audrey Hepburn). Although Bogart was lukewarm about the part, he agreed to it on a handshake with Wilder without a finished script but with the director&#x27;s assurance that he would take good care of Bogart during filming. The actor, however, got along poorly with his director and co-stars; he complained about the script&#x27;s last-minute drafting and delivery, and accused Wilder of favoring Hepburn and Holden on and off the set. Wilder was the opposite of Bogart&#x27;s ideal director (John Huston) in style and personality; Bogart complained to the press that Wilder was &quot;overbearing&quot; and &quot;is [a] kind of Prussian German with a riding crop. He is the type of director I don&#x27;t like to work with ... the picture is a crock of crap. I got sick and tired of who gets Sabrina.&quot; Wilder later said, &quot;We parted as enemies but finally made up.&quot; Despite the acrimony, the film was successful; according to a review in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Bogart was &quot;incredibly adroit ... the skill with which this old rock-ribbed actor blends the gags and such duplicities with a manly manner of melting is one of the incalculable joys of the show&quot;.

Joseph L. Mankiewicz&#x27;s &quot;The Barefoot Contessa&quot; (1954) was filmed in Rome. In this Hollywood backstory, Bogart is a broken-down man, a cynical director-narrator who saves his career by making a star of a flamenco dancer modeled on Rita Hayworth. He was uneasy with Ava Gardner in the female lead; she had just broken up with his Rat Pack buddy Frank Sinatra, and Bogart was annoyed by her inexperienced performance. The actor was generally praised as the film&#x27;s strongest part. During filming and while Bacall was home, Bogart resumed his discreet affair with Verita Bouvaire-Thompson (his long-time studio assistant, whom he drank with and took sailing). When Bacall found them together, she extracted an expensive shopping spree from her husband; the three traveled together after the shooting.

Bogart could be generous with actors, particularly those who were blacklisted, down on their luck or having personal problems. During the filming of the Edward Dmytryk–directed &quot;The Left Hand of God&quot; (1955), he noticed his co-star Gene Tierney having a hard time remembering her lines and behaving oddly; he coached her, feeding Tierney her lines. Familiar with mental illness because of his sister&#x27;s bouts of depression, Bogart encouraged Tierney to seek treatment. He also stood behind Joan Bennett and insisted on her as his co-star in Michael Curtiz&#x27;s &quot;We&#x27;re No Angels&quot; (1955) when a scandal made her &quot;persona non grata&quot; with studio head Jack Warner.

Bogart had already been diagnosed with terminal cancer when shooting &quot;The Harder They Fall&quot;, a boxing drama with Rod Steiger in a supporting role. Steiger later mentioned Bogart&#x27;s courage and geniality during his final performance:

Bogey and I got on very well. Unlike some other stars, when they had closeups, you might have been relegated to a two-shot, or cut out altogether. Bogey didn&#x27;t play those games. He was a professional and had tremendous authority. He&#x27;d come in exactly at 9 a.m. and leave at precisely 6 p.m. I remember once walking to lunch in between takes and seeing Bogey on the lot. I shouldn&#x27;t have because his work was finished for the day. I asked him why he was still on the lot, and he said, &quot;They want to shoot some retakes of my closeups because my eyes are too watery&quot;. A little while later, after the film, somebody came up to me with word of Bogey&#x27;s death. Then it struck me. His eyes were watery because he was in pain with the cancer. I thought: &quot;How dumb can you be, Rodney&quot;!

==== Television and radio ====

Bogart rarely performed on television, but he and Bacall appeared on Edward R. Murrow&#x27;s &quot;Person to Person&quot; and disagreed on the answer to every question. He also appeared on &quot;The Jack Benny Program&quot;, where a surviving kinescope of the live telecast captures him in his only TV sketch-comedy performance (October 25, 1953).

Bogart and Bacall worked on an early color telecast in 1955, an NBC adaptation of &quot;The Petrified Forest&quot; for &quot;Producers&#x27; Showcase&quot;. Bogart received top billing, Henry Fonda played Leslie Howard&#x27;s role and Bacall played Bette Davis&#x27;s part. Jack Klugman, Richard Jaeckel, and Jack Warden played supporting roles. In the late 1990s, Bacall donated the only known kinescope of the 1955 performance (in black and white) to the Museum of Television &amp; Radio (now the Paley Center for Media), where it remains archived for viewing in New York City and Los Angeles. It is now in the public domain.

Bogart also performed radio adaptations of some of his best-known films, such as &quot;Casablanca&quot; and &quot;The Maltese Falcon&quot;, and recorded a radio series entitled &quot;Bold Venture&quot; with Bacall.

== Personal life ==

=== Children ===
Bogart became a father at age 49, when Bacall gave birth to their son Stephen Humphrey Bogart on January 6, 1949, during the filming of &quot;Tokyo Joe&quot;. The name was taken from Steve, Bogart&#x27;s character&#x27;s nickname in &quot;To Have and Have Not&quot;. Stephen became an author and biographer and hosted a television special about his father on Turner Classic Movies. The couple&#x27;s second child and daughter, Leslie Howard Bogart, was born on August 23, 1952. Her first and middle names honor Leslie Howard, Bogart&#x27;s friend and co-star in &quot;The Petrified Forest&quot;.

=== Rat Pack ===
Bogart was a founding member and the original leader of the Hollywood Rat Pack. In the spring of 1955, after a long party in Las Vegas attended by Frank Sinatra, Judy Garland and her husband Sidney Luft, Michael Romanoff and his wife Gloria, David Niven, Angie Dickinson and others, Bacall surveyed the wreckage and said: &quot;You look like a goddamn rat pack.&quot;

The name stuck and was made official at Romanoff&#x27;s in Beverly Hills. Sinatra was dubbed pack president; Bacall den mother; Bogart director of public relations, and Sid Luft acting cage manager. Asked by columnist Earl Wilson what the group&#x27;s purpose was, Bacall replied: &quot;To drink a lot of bourbon and stay up late.&quot;

=== Illness and death ===
After signing a long-term deal with Warner Bros., Bogart predicted with glee that his teeth and hair would fall out before the contract ended. By 1955, however, his health was failing. In the wake of Santana, Bogart had formed a new company and had plans for a film (&quot;Melville Goodwin, U.S.A.&quot;) in which he would play a general and Bacall a press magnate. His persistent cough and difficulty eating became too serious to ignore, though, and he dropped the project. The film was re-tooled as &quot;Top Secret Affair&quot; and released just two weeks after Bogart&#x27;s death in 1957, with Kirk Douglas and Susan Hayward replacing Bogart and Bacall.

A heavy smoker and drinker, Bogart had developed esophageal cancer. He did not talk about his health and visited a doctor in late January 1956 after considerable persuasion from Bacall. The disease worsened and several weeks later, on March 1, Bogart had surgery to remove his esophagus, two lymph nodes and a rib. The surgery was unsuccessful, and chemotherapy followed. He had additional surgery in November 1956, when the cancer had metastasized. Although he became too weak to walk up and down stairs, he joked despite the pain: &quot;Put me in the dumbwaiter and I&#x27;ll ride down to the first floor in style.&quot; It was then altered to accommodate his wheelchair. Frank Sinatra, Katharine Hepburn, and Spencer Tracy visited him on January 13, 1957. In an interview, Hepburn said:

Bogart lapsed into a coma and died the following day; at the time of his death, he weighed only . A simple funeral was held at All Saints Episcopal Church, with music by Bogart&#x27;s favorite composers: Johann Sebastian Bach and Claude Debussy. Among those who attended Bogart&#x27;s funeral were Ingrid Bergman, Mary Astor, Olivia de Havilland, Bing Crosby, James Cagney, Henry Fonda, Harry Cohn, David O. Selznick and Jack L. Warner. Bacall asked Tracy to give the eulogy; he was too upset, however, and John Huston spoke instead:

Bogart was cremated, and his ashes were interred in Forest Lawn Memorial Park&#x27;s Columbarium of Eternal Light in its Garden of Memory in Glendale, California. He was buried with a small, gold whistle that had been part of a charm bracelet he had given to Bacall before they married. On it was inscribed, &quot;If you want anything, just whistle.&quot; This alluded to a scene in &quot;To Have and Have Not&quot; when Bacall&#x27;s character says to Bogart shortly after their first meeting, &quot;You know how to whistle, don&#x27;t you, Steve? You just put your lips together and blow.&quot;
Bogart&#x27;s estate had a gross value of $910,146 and a net value of $737,668.

== Awards and honors ==
On August 21, 1946, he recorded his hand- and footprints in cement in a ceremony at Grauman&#x27;s Chinese Theatre. On February 8, 1960, Bogart was posthumously inducted into the Hollywood Walk of Fame with a motion-picture star at 6322 Hollywood Boulevard. There is a street named after Bogart in San Antonio, Texas.
== Legacy and tributes ==
After his death, a &quot;Bogie cult&quot; formed at the Brattle Theatre in Cambridge, Massachusetts, in Greenwich Village, and in France; this contributed to his increased popularity during the late 1950s and 1960s. In 1997, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; magazine ranked Bogart the number-one movie legend of all time; two years later, the American Film Institute rated him the greatest male screen legend.

Jean-Luc Godard&#x27;s &quot;Breathless&quot; (1960) was the first film to pay tribute to Bogart. Over a decade later, in Woody Allen&#x27;s comic paean &quot;Play It Again, Sam&quot; (1972), Bogart&#x27;s ghost aids Allen&#x27;s character: a film critic having difficulties with women who says that his &quot;sex life has turned into the &#x27;Petrified Forest.

The United States Postal Service honored Bogart with a stamp in its &quot;Legends of Hollywood&quot; series in 1997, the third figure recognized. At a ceremony attended by Lauren Bacall and the Bogart children, Stephen and Leslie, USPS governing-board chair Tirso del Junco delivered a tribute:

&quot;Today, we mark another chapter in the Bogart legacy. With an image that is small and yet as powerful as the ones he left in celluloid, we will begin today to bring his artistry, his power, his unique star quality, to the messages that travel the world.&quot;

On June 24, 2006, 103rd Street between Broadway and West End Avenue in New York City was renamed Humphrey Bogart Place. Lauren Bacall and her son, Stephen Bogart, attended the ceremony. &quot;Bogie would never have believed it&quot;, she said to the assembled city officials and onlookers.

=== In popular culture ===

Bogart has inspired multiple artists.
* Two Bugs Bunny cartoons featured impersonations of the actor: &quot;Slick Hare&quot; (1947) and &quot;8 Ball Bunny&quot; (1950, based on &quot;The Treasure of the Sierra Madre&quot;).
* &quot;The Man with Bogart&#x27;s Face&quot; (1981, starring Bogart lookalike Robert Sacchi) was an homage to the actor. 
* Al Stewart&#x27;s 1976 song &quot;Year of the Cat&quot; was influenced by &quot;Casablanca&quot; and begins with the line &quot;In a morning from a Bogart movie, in a country where they turn back time...&quot;
* The lyrics of Bertie Higgins&#x27; 1981 song &quot;Key Largo&quot; refer to two of Bogart&#x27;s films, &quot;Key Largo&quot; and &quot;Casablanca&quot;. 
* In 2023, notable artist William Kentridge included a drawing of Bogart in his solo museum exhibition at The Broad in Los Angeles. 
* In the cartoon &quot;Shirt Tales&quot;, Bogey Orangutan was based on the voice and the likeness of Bogart.

<text>History painting is a genre in painting defined by its subject matter rather than any artistic style or specific period. History paintings depict a moment in a narrative story, most often (but not exclusively) Greek and Roman mythology and Bible stories, opposed to a specific and static subject, as in portrait, still life, and landscape painting. The term is derived from the wider senses of the word &quot;historia&quot; in Latin and &quot;histoire&quot; in French, meaning &quot;story&quot; or &quot;narrative&quot;, and essentially means &quot;story painting&quot;. Most history paintings are not of scenes from history, especially paintings from before about 1850.

In modern English, &quot;historical painting&quot; is sometimes used to describe the painting of scenes from history in its narrower sense, especially for 19th-century art, excluding religious, mythological, and allegorical subjects, which are included in the broader term &quot;history painting&quot;, and before the 19th century were the most common subjects for history paintings.

History paintings almost always contain a number of figures, often a large number, and normally show some typical states on that is a moment in a narrative. The genre includes depictions of moments in religious narratives, above all the &quot;Life of Christ&quot;, Middle eastern culture as well as narrative scenes from mythology, and also allegorical scenes. These groups were for long the most frequently painted; works such as Michelangelo&#x27;s Sistine Chapel ceiling are therefore history paintings, as are most very large paintings before the 19th century. The term covers large paintings in oil on canvas or fresco produced between the Renaissance and the late 19th century, after which the term is generally not used even for the many works that still meet the basic definition.

History painting may be used interchangeably with historical painting, and was especially so used before the 20th century. Where a distinction is made, &quot;historical painting&quot; is the painting of scenes from secular history, whether specific episodes or generalized scenes. In the 19th century, historical painting in this sense became a distinct genre. In phrases such as &quot;historical painting materials&quot;, &quot;historical&quot; means in use before about 1900, or some earlier date.

==Prestige==

History paintings were traditionally regarded as the highest form of Western painting, occupying the most prestigious place in the hierarchy of genres, and considered the equivalent to the epic in literature. In his &quot;De Pictura&quot; of 1436, Leon Battista Alberti had argued that multi-figure history painting was the noblest form of art, as being the most difficult, which required mastery of all the others, because it was a visual form of history, and because it had the greatest potential to move the viewer. He placed emphasis on the ability to depict the interactions between the figures by gesture and expression.

This view remained general until the 19th century, when artistic movements began to struggle against the establishment institutions of academic art, which continued to adhere to it. At the same time, there was from the latter part of the 18th century an increased interest in depicting in the form of history painting moments of drama from recent or contemporary history, which had long largely been confined to battle-scenes and scenes of formal surrenders and the like. Scenes from ancient history had been popular in the early Renaissance, and once again became common in the Baroque and Rococo periods, and still more so with the rise of Neoclassicism. In some 19th or 20th century contexts, the term may refer specifically to paintings of scenes from secular history, rather than those from religious narratives, literature or mythology.

==Development==

The term is generally not used in art history in speaking of medieval painting, although the Western tradition was developing in large altarpieces, fresco cycles, and other works, as well as miniatures in illuminated manuscripts. It comes to the fore in Italian Renaissance painting, where a series of increasingly ambitious works were produced, many still religious, but several, especially in Florence, which did actually feature near-contemporary historical scenes such as the set of three huge canvases on &quot;The Battle of San Romano&quot; by Paolo Uccello, the abortive &quot;Battle of Cascina&quot; by Michelangelo and the &quot;Battle of Anghiari&quot; by Leonardo da Vinci, neither of which were completed. Scenes from ancient history and mythology were also popular. Writers such as Alberti and the following century Giorgio Vasari in his &quot;Lives of the Artists&quot;, followed public and artistic opinion in judging the best painters above all on their production of large works of history painting (though in fact the only modern (post-classical) work described in &quot;De Pictura&quot; is Giotto&#x27;s huge &quot;Navicella&quot; in mosaic). Artists continued for centuries to strive to make their reputation by producing such works, often neglecting genres to which their talents were better suited.
There was some objection to the term, as many writers preferred terms such as &quot;poetic painting&quot; (&quot;poesia&quot;), or wanted to make a distinction between the &quot;true&quot; &quot;istoria&quot;, covering history including biblical and religious scenes, and the &quot;fabula&quot;, covering pagan myth, allegory, and scenes from fiction, which could not be regarded as true. The large works of Raphael were long considered, with those of Michelangelo, as the finest models for the genre.

In the Raphael Rooms in the Vatican Palace, allegories and historical scenes are mixed together, and the Raphael Cartoons show scenes from the Gospels, all in the Grand Manner that from the High Renaissance became associated with, and often expected in, history painting. In the Late Renaissance and Baroque the painting of actual history tended to degenerate into panoramic battle-scenes with the victorious monarch or general perched on a horse accompanied with his retinue, or formal scenes of ceremonies, although some artists managed to make a masterpiece from such unpromising material, as Velázquez did with his &quot;The Surrender of Breda&quot;.

An influential formulation of the hierarchy of genres, confirming the history painting at the top, was made in 1667 by André Félibien, a historiographer, architect and theoretician of French classicism became the classic statement of the theory for the 18th century:Celui qui fait parfaitement des païsages est au-dessus d&#x27;un autre qui ne fait que des fruits, des fleurs ou des coquilles. Celui qui peint des animaux vivants est plus estimable que ceux qui ne représentent que des choses mortes &amp; sans mouvement; &amp; comme la figure de l&#x27;homme est le plus parfait ouvrage de Dieu sur la Terre, il est certain aussi que celui qui se rend l&#x27;imitateur de Dieu en peignant des figures humaines, est beaucoup plus excellent que tous les autres ... un Peintre qui ne fait que des portraits, n&#x27;a pas encore cette haute perfection de l&#x27;Art, &amp; ne peut prétendre à l&#x27;honneur que reçoivent les plus sçavans. Il faut pour cela passer d&#x27;une seule figure à la représentation de plusieurs ensemble; il faut traiter l&#x27;histoire &amp; la fable; il faut représenter de grandes actions comme les historiens, ou des sujets agréables comme les Poëtes; &amp; montant encore plus haut, il faut par des compositions allégoriques, sçavoir couvrir sous le voile de la fable les vertus des grands hommes, &amp; les mystères les plus relevez.

He who produces perfect landscapes is above another who only produces fruit, flowers or seashells. He who paints living animals is more than those who only represent dead things without movement, and as man is the most perfect work of God on the earth, it is also certain that he who becomes an imitator of God in representing human figures, is much more excellent than all the others ... a painter who only does portraits still does not have the highest perfection of his art, and cannot expect the honour due to the most skilled. For that he must pass from representing a single figure to several together; history and myth must be depicted; great events must be represented as by historians, or like the poets, subjects that will please, and climbing still higher, he must have the skill to cover under the veil of myth the virtues of great men in allegories, and the mysteries they reveal&quot;.

By the late 18th century, with both religious and mytholological painting in decline, there was an increased demand for paintings of scenes from history, including contemporary history. This was in part driven by the changing audience for ambitious paintings, which now increasingly made their reputation in public exhibitions rather than by impressing the owners of and visitors to palaces and public buildings. Classical history remained popular, but scenes from national histories were often the best-received. From 1760 onwards, the Society of Artists of Great Britain, the first body to organize regular exhibitions in London, awarded two generous prizes each year to paintings of subjects from British history. 
The unheroic nature of modern dress was regarded as a serious difficulty. When, in 1770, Benjamin West proposed to paint &quot;The Death of General Wolfe&quot; in contemporary dress, he was firmly instructed to use classical costume by many people. He ignored these comments and showed the scene in modern dress. Although George III refused to purchase the work, West succeeded both in overcoming his critics&#x27; objections and inaugurating a more historically accurate style in such paintings. Other artists depicted scenes, regardless of when they occurred, in classical dress and for a long time, especially during the French Revolution, history painting often focused on depictions of the heroic male nude.

The large production, using the finest French artists, of propaganda paintings glorifying the exploits of Napoleon, were matched by works, showing both victories and losses, from the anti-Napoleonic alliance by artists such as Goya and J. M. W. Turner. Théodore Géricault&#x27;s &quot;The Raft of the Medusa&quot; (1818–1819) was a sensation, appearing to update the history painting for the 19th century, and showing anonymous figures famous only for being victims of what was then a famous and controversial disaster at sea. Conveniently their clothes had been worn away to classical-seeming rags by the point the painting depicts. At the same time the demand for traditional large religious history paintings very largely fell away.
In the mid-nineteenth century there arose a style known as historicism, which marked a formal imitation of historical styles and/or artists. Another development in the nineteenth century was the treatment of historical subjects, often on a large scale, with the values of genre painting, the depiction of scenes of everyday life, and anecdote. Grand depictions of events of great public importance were supplemented with scenes depicting more personal incidents in the lives of the great, or of scenes centred on unnamed figures involved in historical events, as in the Troubadour style. At the same time scenes of ordinary life with moral, political or satirical content became often the main vehicle for expressive interplay between figures in painting, whether given a modern or historical setting.

By the later 19th century, history painting was often explicitly rejected by avant-garde movements such as the Impressionists (except for Édouard Manet) and the Symbolists, and according to one recent writer &quot;Modernism was to a considerable extent built upon the rejection of History Painting... All other genres are deemed capable of entering, in one form or another, the &#x27;pantheon&#x27; of modernity considered, but History Painting is excluded&quot;.

==History painting and historical painting== 
===The terms===
Initially, &quot;history painting&quot; and &quot;historical painting&quot; were used interchangeably in English, as when Sir Joshua Reynolds in his fourth &quot;Discourse&quot; uses both indiscriminately to cover &quot;history painting&quot;, while saying &quot;...it ought to be called poetical, as in reality it is&quot;, reflecting the French term &quot;peinture historique&quot;, one equivalent of &quot;history painting&quot;. The terms began to separate in the 19th century, with &quot;historical painting&quot; becoming a sub-group of &quot;history painting&quot; restricted to subjects taken from history in its normal sense. In 1853 John Ruskin asked his audience: &quot;What do you at present &quot;mean&quot; by historical painting? Now-a-days it means the endeavour, by the power of imagination, to portray some historical event of past days.&quot; So for example Harold Wethey&#x27;s three-volume catalogue of the paintings of Titian (Phaidon, 1969–75) is divided between &quot;Religious Paintings&quot;, &quot;Portraits&quot;, and &quot;Mythological and Historical Paintings&quot;, though both volumes I and III cover what is included in the term &quot;History Paintings&quot;. This distinction is useful but is by no means generally observed, and the terms are still often used in a confusing manner. Because of the potential for confusion modern academic writing tends to avoid the phrase &quot;historical painting&quot;, talking instead of &quot;historical subject matter&quot; in history painting, but where the phrase is still used in contemporary scholarship it will normally mean the painting of subjects from history, very often in the 19th century. &quot;Historical painting&quot; may also be used, especially in discussion of painting techniques in conservation studies, to mean &quot;old&quot;, as opposed to modern or recent painting.
In 19th-century British writing on art the terms &quot;subject painting&quot; or &quot;anecdotic&quot; painting were often used for works in a line of development going back to William Hogarth of monoscenic depictions of crucial moments in an implied narrative with unidentified characters, such as William Holman Hunt&#x27;s 1853 painting &quot;The Awakening Conscience&quot; or Augustus Egg&#x27;s &quot;Past and Present&quot;, a set of three paintings, updating sets by Hogarth such as &quot;Marriage à-la-mode&quot;.

===19th century===

History painting was the dominant form of academic painting in the various national academies in the 18th century, and for most of the 19th, and increasingly historical subjects dominated. During the Revolutionary and Napoleonic periods the heroic treatment of contemporary history in a frankly propagandistic fashion by Antoine-Jean, Baron Gros, Jacques-Louis David, Carle Vernet and others was supported by the French state, but after the fall of Napoleon in 1815 the French governments were not regarded as suitable for heroic treatment and many artists retreated further into the past to find subjects, though in Britain depicting the victories of the Napoleonic Wars mostly occurred after they were over. Another path was to choose contemporary subjects that were oppositional to government either at home and abroad, and many of what were arguably the last great generation of history paintings were protests at contemporary episodes of repression or outrages at home or abroad: Goya&#x27;s &quot;The Third of May 1808&quot; (1814), Théodore Géricault&#x27;s &quot;The Raft of the Medusa&quot; (1818–19), Eugène Delacroix&#x27;s &quot;The Massacre at Chios&quot; (1824) and &quot;Liberty Leading the People&quot; (1830). These were heroic, but showed heroic suffering by ordinary civilians.

Romantic artists such as Géricault and Delacroix, and those from other movements such as the English Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood continued to regard history painting as the ideal for their most ambitious works. Others such as Jan Matejko in Poland, Vasily Surikov in Russia, José Moreno Carbonero in Spain and Paul Delaroche in France became specialized painters of large historical subjects. The &quot;style troubadour&quot; (&quot;troubadour style&quot;) was a somewhat derisive French term for earlier paintings of medieval and Renaissance scenes, which were often small and depicting moments of anecdote rather than drama; Ingres, Richard Parkes Bonington and Henri Fradelle painted such works. Sir Roy Strong calls this type of work the &quot;Intimate Romantic&quot;, and in French it was known as the &quot;peinture de genre historique&quot; or &quot;peinture anecdotique&quot; (&quot;historical genre painting&quot; or &quot;anecdotal painting&quot;).

Church commissions for large group scenes from the Bible had greatly reduced, and historical painting became very significant. Especially in the early 19th century, much historical painting depicted specific moments from historical literature, with the novels of Sir Walter Scott a particular favourite, in France and other European countries as much as Great Britain. By the middle of the century medieval scenes were expected to be very carefully researched, using the work of historians of costume, architecture and all elements of decor that were becoming available. An example of this is the extensive research of Byzantine architecture, clothing, and decoration made in Parisian museums and libraries by Moreno Carbonero for his masterwork &quot;The Entry of Roger de Flor in Constantinople&quot;. The provision of examples and expertise for artists, as well as revivalist industrial designers, was one of the motivations for the establishment of museums like the Victoria and Albert Museum in London.

New techniques of printmaking such as the chromolithograph made good quality reproductions both relatively cheap and very widely accessible, and also hugely profitable for artist and publisher, as the sales were so large. Historical painting often had a close relationship with Nationalism, and painters like Matejko in Poland could play an important role in fixing the prevailing historical narrative of national history in the popular mind. In France, &quot;L&#x27;art Pompier&quot; (&quot;Fireman art&quot;) was a derisory term for official academic historical painting, and in a final phase, &quot;History painting of a debased sort, scenes of brutality and terror, purporting to illustrate episodes from Roman and Moorish history, were Salon sensations. On the overcrowded walls of the exhibition galleries, the paintings that shouted loudest got the attention&quot;. Orientalist painting was an alternative genre that offered similar exotic costumes and decor, and at least as much opportunity to depict sex and violence.

<text>In mathematics, a hyperbola is a type of smooth curve lying in a plane, defined by its geometric properties or by equations for which it is the solution set. A hyperbola has two pieces, called connected components or branches, that are mirror images of each other and resemble two infinite bows. The hyperbola is one of the three kinds of conic section, formed by the intersection of a plane and a double cone. (The other conic sections are the parabola and the ellipse. A circle is a special case of an ellipse.) If the plane intersects both halves of the double cone but does not pass through the apex of the cones, then the conic is a hyperbola.

Besides being a conic section, a hyperbola can arise as the locus of points whose difference of distances to two fixed foci is constant, as a curve for each point of which the rays to two fixed foci are reflections across the tangent line at that point, or as the solution of certain bivariate quadratic equations such as the reciprocal relationship formula_1 In practical applications, a hyperbola can arise as the path followed by the shadow of the tip of a sundial&#x27;s gnomon, the shape of an open orbit such as that of a celestial object exceeding the escape velocity of the nearest gravitational body, or the scattering trajectory of a subatomic particle, among others.

Each branch of the hyperbola has two arms which become straighter (lower curvature) further out from the center of the hyperbola. Diagonally opposite arms, one from each branch, tend in the limit to a common line, called the asymptote of those two arms. So there are two asymptotes, whose intersection is at the center of symmetry of the hyperbola, which can be thought of as the mirror point about which each branch reflects to form the other branch. In the case of the curve formula_2 the asymptotes are the two coordinate axes.

Hyperbolas share many of the ellipses&#x27; analytical properties such as eccentricity, focus, and directrix. Typically the correspondence can be made with nothing more than a change of sign in some term. Many other mathematical objects have their origin in the hyperbola, such as hyperbolic paraboloids (saddle surfaces), hyperboloids (&quot;wastebaskets&quot;), hyperbolic geometry (Lobachevsky&#x27;s celebrated non-Euclidean geometry), hyperbolic functions (sinh, cosh, tanh, etc.), and gyrovector spaces (a geometry proposed for use in both relativity and quantum mechanics which is not Euclidean).

==Etymology and history==
The word &quot;hyperbola&quot; derives from the Greek , meaning &quot;over-thrown&quot; or &quot;excessive&quot;, from which the English term hyperbole also derives. Hyperbolae were discovered by Menaechmus in his investigations of the problem of doubling the cube, but were then called sections of obtuse cones. The term hyperbola is believed to have been coined by Apollonius of Perga () in his definitive work on the conic sections, the &quot;Conics&quot;.
The names of the other two general conic sections, the ellipse and the parabola, derive from the corresponding Greek words for &quot;deficient&quot; and &quot;applied&quot;; all three names are borrowed from earlier Pythagorean terminology which referred to a comparison of the side of rectangles of fixed area with a given line segment. The rectangle could be &quot;applied&quot; to the segment (meaning, have an equal length), be shorter than the segment or exceed the segment.

==Definitions==

===As locus of points===
A hyperbola can be defined geometrically as a set of points (locus of points) in the Euclidean plane:
The midpoint formula_3 of the line segment joining the foci is called the &quot;center&quot; of the hyperbola. The line through the foci is called the &quot;major axis&quot;. It contains the &quot;vertices&quot; formula_4, which have distance formula_5 to the center. The distance formula_6 of the foci to the center is called the &quot;focal distance&quot; or &quot;linear eccentricity&quot;. The quotient formula_7 is the &quot;eccentricity&quot; formula_8.

The equation formula_9 can be viewed in a different way (see diagram):
If formula_10 is the circle with midpoint formula_11 and radius formula_12, then the distance of a point formula_13 of the right branch to the circle formula_10 equals the distance to the focus formula_15:
formula_16
formula_10 is called the &quot;circular directrix&quot; (related to focus formula_11) of the hyperbola. In order to get the left branch of the hyperbola, one has to use the circular directrix related to formula_15. This property should not be confused with the definition of a hyperbola with help of a directrix (line) below.

===Hyperbola with equation ===
If the &quot;xy&quot;-coordinate system is rotated about the origin by the angle formula_20 and new coordinates formula_21 are assigned, then formula_22.
The rectangular hyperbola formula_23 (whose semi-axes are equal) has the new equation formula_24.
Solving for formula_25 yields formula_26

Thus, in an &quot;xy&quot;-coordinate system the graph of a function formula_27 with equation
formula_28 is a &quot;rectangular hyperbola&quot; entirely in the first and third quadrants with
*the coordinate axes as &quot;asymptotes&quot;,
*the line formula_29 as &quot;major axis&quot; ,
*the &quot;center&quot; formula_30 and the &quot;semi-axis&quot; formula_31
*the &quot;vertices&quot; formula_32
*the &quot;semi-latus rectum&quot; and &quot;radius of curvature &quot; at the vertices formula_33
*the &quot;linear eccentricity&quot; formula_34 and the eccentricity formula_35
*the &quot;tangent&quot; formula_36 at point formula_37

A rotation of the original hyperbola by formula_38 results in a rectangular hyperbola entirely in the second and fourth quadrants, with the same asymptotes, center, semi-latus rectum, radius of curvature at the vertices, linear eccentricity, and eccentricity as for the case of formula_20 rotation, with equation
formula_40
*the &quot;semi-axes&quot; formula_31
*the line formula_42 as major axis,
*the &quot;vertices&quot; formula_43

Shifting the hyperbola with equation formula_44 so that the new center is yields the new equation
formula_45
and the new asymptotes are formula_46 and formula_47. The shape parameters formula_48 remain unchanged.

===By the directrix property===
The two lines at distance formula_49 from the center and parallel to the minor axis are called directrices of the hyperbola (see diagram).

For an arbitrary point formula_13 of the hyperbola the quotient of the distance to one focus and to the corresponding directrix (see diagram) is equal to the eccentricity:
formula_51
The proof for the pair formula_52 follows from the fact that formula_53 and formula_54 satisfy the equation
formula_55
The second case is proven analogously.

The &quot;inverse statement&quot; is also true and can be used to define a hyperbola (in a manner similar to the definition of a parabola):

For any point formula_56 (focus), any line formula_57 (directrix) not through formula_56 and any real number formula_8 with formula_60 the set of points (locus of points), for which the quotient of the distances to the point and to the line is formula_8
formula_62
is a hyperbola.

(The choice formula_63 yields a parabola and if formula_64 an ellipse.)

====Proof====
Let formula_65 and assume formula_30 is a point on the curve.
The directrix formula_57 has equation formula_68. With formula_69, the relation formula_70 produces the equations
:formula_71 and formula_72
The substitution formula_73 yields
formula_74
This is the equation of an &quot;ellipse&quot; (formula_75) or a &quot;parabola&quot; (formula_76) or a &quot;hyperbola&quot; (formula_77). All of these non-degenerate conics have, in common, the origin as a vertex (see diagram).

If formula_60, introduce new parameters formula_79 so that formula_80, and then the equation above becomes
formula_81
which is the equation of a hyperbola with center formula_82, the &quot;x&quot;-axis as major axis and the major/minor semi axis formula_79.
====Construction of a directrix====
Because of formula_84 point formula_85 of directrix formula_86 (see diagram) and focus formula_15 are inverse with respect to the circle inversion at circle formula_88 (in diagram green). Hence point formula_89 can be constructed using the theorem of Thales (not shown in the diagram). The directrix formula_86 is the perpendicular to line formula_91 through point formula_89.

&quot;Alternative construction of formula_89&quot;: Calculation shows, that point formula_89 is the intersection of the asymptote with its perpendicular through formula_15 (see diagram).

===As plane section of a cone ===

The intersection of an upright double cone by a plane not through the vertex with slope greater than the slope of the lines on the cone is a hyperbola (see diagram: red curve). In order to prove the defining property of a hyperbola (see above) one uses two Dandelin spheres formula_96, which are spheres that touch the cone along circles formula_97 and the intersecting (hyperbola) plane at points formula_15 and It turns out: formula_99 are the &quot;foci&quot; of the hyperbola.
# Let formula_13 be an arbitrary point of the intersection curve.
# The generatrix of the cone containing formula_13 intersects circle formula_102 at point formula_103 and circle formula_10 at a point formula_105.
# The line segments formula_106 and formula_107 are tangential to the sphere formula_108 and, hence, are of equal length.
# The line segments formula_109 and formula_110 are tangential to the sphere formula_111 and, hence, are of equal length.
# The result is: formula_112 is independent of the hyperbola point because no matter where point formula_13 is, formula_114 have to be on circles and line segment formula_115 has to cross the apex. Therefore, as point formula_13 moves along the red curve (hyperbola), line segment formula_117 simply rotates about apex without changing its length.

===Pin and string construction===

The definition of a hyperbola by its foci and its circular directrices (see above) can be used for drawing an arc of it with help of pins, a string and a ruler:
# A &quot;ruler&quot; is fixed at point formula_11 free to rotate around formula_11. Point formula_105 is marked at distance formula_12.
# A &quot;string&quot; gets its one end pinned at point formula_103 on the ruler and its length is made formula_123.
# The free end of the string is pinned to point formula_15.
# Take a &quot;pen&quot; and hold the string tight to the edge of the ruler.
# &quot;Rotating&quot; the ruler around formula_11 prompts the pen to draw an arc of the right branch of the hyperbola, because of formula_126 (see the definition of a hyperbola by &quot;circular directrices&quot;).

===Steiner generation of a hyperbola===
The following method to construct single points of a hyperbola relies on the Steiner generation of a non degenerate conic section:

For the generation of points of the hyperbola formula_127 one uses the pencils at the vertices formula_128. Let formula_129 be a point of the hyperbola and formula_130. The line segment formula_131 is divided into n equally-spaced segments and this division is projected parallel with the diagonal formula_115 as direction onto the line segment formula_133 (see diagram). The parallel projection is part of the projective mapping between the pencils at formula_134 and formula_135 needed. The intersection points of any two related lines formula_136 and formula_137 are points of the uniquely defined hyperbola.

&quot;Remarks:&quot;
* The subdivision could be extended beyond the points formula_103 and formula_105 in order to get more points, but the determination of the intersection points would become more inaccurate. A better idea is extending the points already constructed by symmetry (see animation).
* The Steiner generation exists for ellipses and parabolas, too.
* The Steiner generation is sometimes called a &quot;parallelogram method&quot; because one can use other points rather than the vertices, which starts with a parallelogram instead of a rectangle.

===Inscribed angles for hyperbolas and the 3-point-form===

A hyperbola with equation formula_140 is uniquely determined by three points formula_141 with different &quot;x&quot;- and &quot;y&quot;-coordinates. A simple way to determine the shape parameters formula_142 uses the &quot;inscribed angle theorem&quot; for hyperbolas:

Analogous to the inscribed angle theorem for circles one gets the
A consequence of the inscribed angle theorem for hyperbolas is the
===As an affine image of the unit hyperbola ===

Another definition of a hyperbola uses affine transformations:

====Parametric representation====
An affine transformation of the Euclidean plane has the form formula_143, where formula_103 is a regular matrix (its determinant is not 0) and formula_145 is an arbitrary vector. If formula_146 are the column vectors of the matrix formula_103, the unit hyperbola formula_148 is mapped onto the hyperbola

formula_149

formula_145 is the center, formula_151 a point of the hyperbola and formula_152 a tangent vector at this point.

====Vertices====
In general the vectors formula_146 are not perpendicular. That means, in general formula_154 are &quot;not&quot; the vertices of the hyperbola. But formula_155 point into the directions of the asymptotes. The tangent vector at point formula_156 is
formula_157
Because at a vertex the tangent is perpendicular to the major axis of the hyperbola one gets the parameter formula_158 of a vertex from the equation
formula_159
and hence from
formula_160
which yields

formula_161

The formulae and formula_162 were used.

The two &quot;vertices&quot; of the hyperbola are formula_163

====Implicit representation====
Solving the parametric representation for formula_164 by Cramer&#x27;s rule and using formula_165, one gets the implicit representation
formula_166

====Hyperbola in space====
The definition of a hyperbola in this section gives a parametric representation of an arbitrary hyperbola, even in space, if one allows formula_167 to be vectors in space.

===As an affine image of the hyperbola ===

Because the unit hyperbola formula_168 is affinely equivalent to the hyperbola formula_169, an arbitrary hyperbola can be considered as the affine image (see previous section) of the hyperbola 

formula_170

formula_171 is the center of the hyperbola, the vectors formula_172 have the directions of the asymptotes and formula_173 is a point of the hyperbola. The tangent vector is
formula_174
At a vertex the tangent is perpendicular to the major axis. Hence
formula_175
and the parameter of a vertex is

formula_176

formula_177 is equivalent to formula_178 and formula_179 are the vertices of the hyperbola.

The following properties of a hyperbola are easily proven using the representation of a hyperbola introduced in this section.

====Tangent construction====

The tangent vector can be rewritten by factorization:
formula_180
This means that

This property provides a way to construct the tangent at a point on the hyperbola.

This property of a hyperbola is an affine version of the 3-point-degeneration of Pascal&#x27;s theorem.

;Area of the grey parallelogram:
The area of the grey parallelogram formula_181 in the above diagram is
formula_182
and hence independent of point formula_13. The last equation follows from a calculation for the case, where formula_13 is a vertex and the hyperbola in its canonical form formula_185

====Point construction====
For a hyperbola with parametric representation formula_186 (for simplicity the center is the origin) the following is true:
The simple proof is a consequence of the equation formula_187.

This property provides a possibility to construct points of a hyperbola if the asymptotes and one point are given.

This property of a hyperbola is an affine version of the 4-point-degeneration of Pascal&#x27;s theorem.

====Tangent–asymptotes triangle====

For simplicity the center of the hyperbola may be the origin and the vectors formula_188 have equal length. If the last assumption is not fulfilled one can first apply a parameter transformation (see above) in order to make the assumption true. Hence formula_189 are the vertices, formula_190 span the minor axis and one gets formula_191 and formula_192.

For the intersection points of the tangent at point formula_193 with the asymptotes one gets the points
formula_194
The &quot;area&quot; of the triangle formula_195 can be calculated by a 2 × 2 determinant:
formula_196
(see rules for determinants).
formula_197 is the area of the rhombus generated by formula_188. The area of a rhombus is equal to one half of the product of its diagonals. The diagonals are the semi-axes formula_79 of the hyperbola. Hence:

===Reciprocation of a circle===
The reciprocation of a circle &quot;B&quot; in a circle &quot;C&quot; always yields a conic section such as a hyperbola. The process of &quot;reciprocation in a circle &quot;C&quot;&quot; consists of replacing every line and point in a geometrical figure with their corresponding pole and polar, respectively. The &quot;pole&quot; of a line is the inversion of its closest point to the circle &quot;C&quot;, whereas the polar of a point is the converse, namely, a line whose closest point to &quot;C&quot; is the inversion of the point.

The eccentricity of the conic section obtained by reciprocation is the ratio of the distances between the two circles&#x27; centers to the radius &quot;r&quot; of reciprocation circle &quot;C&quot;. If B and C represent the points at the centers of the corresponding circles, then

formula_200

Since the eccentricity of a hyperbola is always greater than one, the center B must lie outside of the reciprocating circle &quot;C&quot;.

This definition implies that the hyperbola is both the locus of the poles of the tangent lines to the circle &quot;B&quot;, as well as the envelope of the polar lines of the points on &quot;B&quot;. Conversely, the circle &quot;B&quot; is the envelope of polars of points on the hyperbola, and the locus of poles of tangent lines to the hyperbola. Two tangent lines to &quot;B&quot; have no (finite) poles because they pass through the center C of the reciprocation circle &quot;C&quot;; the polars of the corresponding tangent points on &quot;B&quot; are the asymptotes of the hyperbola. The two branches of the hyperbola correspond to the two parts of the circle &quot;B&quot; that are separated by these tangent points.

===Quadratic equation===
A hyperbola can also be defined as a second-degree equation in the Cartesian coordinates formula_201 in the plane,

formula_202

provided that the constants formula_203 formula_204 formula_205 formula_206 formula_207 and formula_208 satisfy the determinant condition

formula_209

This determinant is conventionally called the discriminant of the conic section.

A special case of a hyperbola—the &quot;degenerate hyperbola&quot; consisting of two intersecting lines—occurs when another determinant is zero:

formula_210

This determinant formula_211 is sometimes called the discriminant of the conic section.

The general equation&#x27;s coefficients can be obtained from known semi-major axis formula_212 semi-minor axis formula_213 center coordinates formula_214, and rotation angle formula_215 (the angle from the positive horizontal axis to the hyperbola&#x27;s major axis) using the formulae:

formula_216

These expressions can be derived from the canonical equation

formula_217

by a translation and rotation of the coordinates 

formula_218

Given the above general parametrization of the hyperbola in Cartesian coordinates, the eccentricity can be found using the formula in Conic section#Eccentricity in terms of coefficients.

The center formula_219 of the hyperbola may be determined from the formulae

formula_220

In terms of new coordinates, formula_221 and formula_222 the defining equation of the hyperbola can be written

formula_223

The principal axes of the hyperbola make an angle formula_224 with the positive formula_225-axis that is given by

formula_226

Rotating the coordinate axes so that the formula_225-axis is aligned with the transverse axis brings the equation into its canonical form

formula_228

The major and minor semiaxes formula_5 and formula_230 are defined by the equations

formula_231

where formula_232 and formula_233 are the roots of the quadratic equation

formula_234

For comparison, the corresponding equation for a degenerate hyperbola (consisting of two intersecting lines) is

formula_235

The tangent line to a given point formula_236 on the hyperbola is defined by the equation

formula_237

where formula_238 formula_239 and formula_240 are defined by

formula_241

The normal line to the hyperbola at the same point is given by the equation

formula_242

The normal line is perpendicular to the tangent line, and both pass through the same point formula_243

From the equation

formula_244

the left focus is formula_245 and the right focus is formula_246 where formula_8 is the eccentricity. Denote the distances from a point formula_201 to the left and right foci as formula_249 and formula_250 For a point on the right branch,

formula_251

and for a point on the left branch,

formula_252

This can be proved as follows:

If formula_201 is a point on the hyperbola the distance to the left focal point is

formula_254

To the right focal point the distance is

formula_255

If formula_201 is a point on the right branch of the hyperbola then formula_257 and

formula_258

Subtracting these equations one gets

formula_259

If formula_201 is a point on the left branch of the hyperbola then formula_261 and

formula_262

Subtracting these equations one gets

formula_263

==In Cartesian coordinates==

===Equation===
If Cartesian coordinates are introduced such that the origin is the center of the hyperbola and the &quot;x&quot;-axis is the major axis, then the hyperbola is called &quot;east-west-opening&quot; and
:the &quot;foci&quot; are the points formula_264,
:the &quot;vertices&quot; are formula_265.
For an arbitrary point formula_266 the distance to the focus formula_267 is formula_268 and to the second focus formula_269. Hence the point formula_266 is on the hyperbola if the following condition is fulfilled
formula_271
Remove the square roots by suitable squarings and use the relation formula_272 to obtain the equation of the hyperbola:

formula_273

This equation is called the canonical form of a hyperbola, because any hyperbola, regardless of its orientation relative to the Cartesian axes and regardless of the location of its center, can be transformed to this form by a change of variables, giving a hyperbola that is congruent to the original (see below).

The axes of symmetry or &quot;principal axes&quot; are the &quot;transverse axis&quot; (containing the segment of length 2&quot;a&quot; with endpoints at the vertices) and the &quot;conjugate axis&quot; (containing the segment of length 2&quot;b&quot; perpendicular to the transverse axis and with midpoint at the hyperbola&#x27;s center). As opposed to an ellipse, a hyperbola has only two vertices: formula_274. The two points formula_275 on the conjugate axes are &quot;not&quot; on the hyperbola.

It follows from the equation that the hyperbola is &quot;symmetric&quot; with respect to both of the coordinate axes and hence symmetric with respect to the origin.

====Eccentricity====
For a hyperbola in the above canonical form, the eccentricity is given by

formula_276

Two hyperbolas are geometrically similar to each other – meaning that they have the same shape, so that one can be transformed into the other by rigid left and right movements, rotation, taking a mirror image, and scaling (magnification) – if and only if they have the same eccentricity.

===Asymptotes===
Solving the equation (above) of the hyperbola for formula_277 yields
formula_278
It follows from this that the hyperbola approaches the two lines
formula_279
for large values of formula_280. These two lines intersect at the center (origin) and are called &quot;asymptotes&quot; of the hyperbola formula_281

With the help of the second figure one can see that
:formula_282 The &quot;perpendicular distance from a focus to either asymptote&quot; is formula_230 (the semi-minor axis).

From the Hesse normal form formula_284 of the asymptotes and the equation of the hyperbola one gets:
:formula_285 The &quot;product of the distances from a point on the hyperbola to both the asymptotes&quot; is the constant formula_286 which can also be written in terms of the eccentricity &quot;e&quot; as formula_287

From the equation formula_288 of the hyperbola (above) one can derive:
:formula_289 The &quot;product of the slopes of lines from a point P to the two vertices&quot; is the constant formula_290

In addition, from (2) above it can be shown that
:formula_291 &quot;The product of the distances from a point on the hyperbola to the asymptotes along lines parallel to the asymptotes&quot; is the constant formula_292

===Semi-latus rectum===
The length of the chord through one of the foci, perpendicular to the major axis of the hyperbola, is called the &quot;latus rectum&quot;. One half of it is the &quot;semi-latus rectum&quot; formula_293. A calculation shows
formula_294
The semi-latus rectum formula_293 may also be viewed as the &quot;radius of curvature &quot; at the vertices.

===Tangent===
The simplest way to determine the equation of the tangent at a point formula_296 is to implicitly differentiate the equation formula_297 of the hyperbola. Denoting &quot;dy/dx&quot; as &quot;y′&quot;, this produces
formula_298
With respect to formula_299, the equation of the tangent at point formula_296 is
formula_301

A particular tangent line distinguishes the hyperbola from the other conic sections. Let &quot;f&quot; be the distance from the vertex &quot;V&quot; (on both the hyperbola and its axis through the two foci) to the nearer focus. Then the distance, along a line perpendicular to that axis, from that focus to a point P on the hyperbola is greater than 2&quot;f&quot;. The tangent to the hyperbola at P intersects that axis at point Q at an angle ∠PQV of greater than 45°.

===Rectangular hyperbola===
In the case formula_302 the hyperbola is called &quot;rectangular&quot; (or &quot;equilateral&quot;), because its asymptotes intersect at right angles. For this case, the linear eccentricity is formula_303, the eccentricity formula_304 and the semi-latus rectum formula_305. The graph of the equation formula_169 is a rectangular hyperbola.

===Parametric representation with hyperbolic sine/cosine===
Using the hyperbolic sine and cosine functions formula_307, a parametric representation of the hyperbola formula_297 can be obtained, which is similar to the parametric representation of an ellipse:
formula_309
which satisfies the Cartesian equation because formula_310

Further parametric representations are given in the section Parametric equations below.
=== Conjugate hyperbola ===

For the hyperbola formula_311, change the sign on the right to obtain the equation of the conjugate hyperbola:
:formula_312 (which can also be written as formula_313).

A hyperbola and its conjugate may have diameters which are conjugate. In the theory of special relativity, such diameters may represent axes of time and space, where one hyperbola represents events at a given spatial distance from the center, and the other represents events at a corresponding temporal distance from the center.

:formula_314 and formula_315 also specify conjugate hyperbolas.

==In polar coordinates==


===Origin at the focus===
The polar coordinates used most commonly for the hyperbola are defined relative to the Cartesian coordinate system that has its &quot;origin in a focus&quot; and its x-axis pointing toward the origin of the &quot;canonical coordinate system&quot; as illustrated in the first diagram.

In this case the angle formula_224 is called true anomaly.

Relative to this coordinate system one has that

formula_317

and

formula_318

===Origin at the center===
With polar coordinates relative to the &quot;canonical coordinate system&quot; (see second diagram)
one has that

formula_319

For the right branch of the hyperbola the range of formula_320 is
formula_321

===Eccentricity===

When using polar coordinates, the eccentricity of the hyperbola can be expressed as formula_322 where formula_323 is the limit of the angular coordinate. As formula_224 approaches this limit, &quot;r&quot; approaches infinity and the denominator in either of the equations noted above approaches zero, hence:

formula_325

formula_326

formula_327

==Parametric equations==
A hyperbola with equation formula_328 can be described by several parametric equations:
# Through hyperbolic trigonometric functions formula_329
# As a &quot;rational&quot; representation formula_330
# Through circular trigonometric functions formula_331
# With the tangent slope as parameter: A parametric representation, which uses the slope formula_332 of the tangent at a point of the hyperbola can be obtained analogously to the ellipse case: Replace in the ellipse case formula_333 by formula_334 and use formulae for the hyperbolic functions. One gets formula_335 Here, formula_336 is the upper, and formula_337 the lower half of the hyperbola. The points with vertical tangents (vertices formula_338) are not covered by the representation. The equation of the tangent at point formula_339 is formula_340 This description of the tangents of a hyperbola is an essential tool for the determination of the orthoptic of a hyperbola.

==Hyperbolic functions==

Just as the trigonometric functions are defined in terms of the unit circle, so also the hyperbolic functions are defined in terms of the unit hyperbola, as shown in this diagram. In a unit circle, the angle (in radians) is equal to twice the area of the circular sector which that angle subtends. The analogous hyperbolic angle is likewise defined as twice the area of a hyperbolic sector.

Let formula_5 be twice the area between the formula_225 axis and a ray through the origin intersecting the unit hyperbola, and define formula_343 as the coordinates of the intersection point.
Then the area of the hyperbolic sector is the area of the triangle minus the curved region past the vertex at formula_344:
formula_345
which simplifies to the area hyperbolic cosine
formula_346
Solving for formula_225 yields the exponential form of the hyperbolic cosine:
formula_348
From formula_168 one gets
formula_350
and its inverse the area hyperbolic sine:
formula_351
Other hyperbolic functions are defined according to the hyperbolic cosine and hyperbolic sine, so for example
formula_352

==Properties==

===Reflection property===

The tangent at a point formula_13 bisects the angle between the lines formula_354 This is called the &quot;optical property&quot; or &quot;reflection property&quot; of a hyperbola.
;Proof:
Let formula_355 be the point on the line formula_109 with the distance formula_12 to the focus formula_11 (see diagram, formula_5 is the semi major axis of the hyperbola). Line formula_360 is the bisector of the angle between the lines formula_361. In order to prove that formula_360 is the tangent line at point formula_13, one checks that any point formula_364 on line formula_360 which is different from formula_13 cannot be on the hyperbola. Hence formula_360 has only point formula_13 in common with the hyperbola and is, therefore, the tangent at point formula_13. 
From the diagram and the triangle inequality one recognizes that formula_370 holds, which means: formula_371. But if formula_364 is a point of the hyperbola, the difference should be formula_12.

===Midpoints of parallel chords===
The midpoints of parallel chords of a hyperbola lie on a line through the center (see diagram).

The points of any chord may lie on different branches of the hyperbola.

The proof of the property on midpoints is best done for the hyperbola formula_169. Because any hyperbola is an affine image of the hyperbola formula_169 (see section below) and an affine transformation preserves parallelism and midpoints of line segments, the property is true for all hyperbolas:
For two points formula_376 of the hyperbola formula_169

:the midpoint of the chord is formula_378

:the slope of the chord is formula_379

For parallel chords the slope is constant and the midpoints of the parallel chords lie on the line formula_380

Consequence: for any pair of points formula_381 of a chord there exists a &quot;skew reflection&quot; with an axis (set of fixed points) passing through the center of the hyperbola, which exchanges the points formula_381 and leaves the hyperbola (as a whole) fixed. A skew reflection is a generalization of an ordinary reflection across a line formula_332, where all point-image pairs are on a line perpendicular to formula_332.

Because a skew reflection leaves the hyperbola fixed, the pair of asymptotes is fixed, too. Hence the midpoint formula_3 of a chord formula_386 divides the related line segment formula_387 between the asymptotes into halves, too. This means that formula_388. This property can be used for the construction of further points formula_364 of the hyperbola if a point formula_13 and the asymptotes are given.

If the chord degenerates into a &quot;tangent&quot;, then the touching point divides the line segment between the asymptotes in two halves.

===Orthogonal tangents – orthoptic===
For a hyperbola formula_391 the intersection points of &quot;orthogonal&quot; tangents lie on the circle formula_392. 
This circle is called the &quot;orthoptic&quot; of the given hyperbola.

The tangents may belong to points on different branches of the hyperbola.

In case of formula_393 there are no pairs of orthogonal tangents.

===Pole-polar relation for a hyperbola===

Any hyperbola can be described in a suitable coordinate system by an equation formula_297. The equation of the tangent at a point formula_395 of the hyperbola is formula_396 If one allows point formula_395 to be an arbitrary point different from the origin, then

:point formula_398 is mapped onto the line formula_399, not through the center of the hyperbola.

This relation between points and lines is a bijection.

The inverse function maps

:line formula_400 onto the point formula_401 and

:line formula_402 onto the point formula_403

Such a relation between points and lines generated by a conic is called pole-polar relation or just &quot;polarity&quot;. The pole is the point, the polar the line. See Pole and polar.

By calculation one checks the following properties of the pole-polar relation of the hyperbola:
* For a point (pole) &quot;on&quot; the hyperbola the polar is the tangent at this point (see diagram: formula_404).
* For a pole formula_13 &quot;outside&quot; the hyperbola the intersection points of its polar with the hyperbola are the tangency points of the two tangents passing formula_13 (see diagram: formula_407).
* For a point &quot;within&quot; the hyperbola the polar has no point with the hyperbola in common. (see diagram: formula_408).

&quot;Remarks:&quot;
# The intersection point of two polars (for example: formula_409) is the pole of the line through their poles (here: formula_410).
# The foci formula_411 and formula_412 respectively and the directrices formula_413 and formula_414 respectively belong to pairs of pole and polar.
Pole-polar relations exist for ellipses and parabolas, too.

===Other properties===
* The following are concurrent: (1) a circle passing through the hyperbola&#x27;s foci and centered at the hyperbola&#x27;s center; (2) either of the lines that are tangent to the hyperbola at the vertices; and (3) either of the asymptotes of the hyperbola.
* The following are also concurrent: (1) the circle that is centered at the hyperbola&#x27;s center and that passes through the hyperbola&#x27;s vertices; (2) either directrix; and (3) either of the asymptotes.
* Since both the transverse axis and the conjugate axis are axes of symmetry, the symmetry group of a hyperbola is the Klein four-group.
* The rectangular hyperbolas &quot;xy&quot; = constant admit group actions by squeeze mappings which have the hyperbolas as invariant sets.

==Arc length==
The arc length of a hyperbola does not have an elementary expression. The upper half of a hyperbola can be parameterized as

formula_415

Then the integral giving the arc length formula_416 from formula_417 to formula_418 can be computed as:

formula_419

After using the substitution formula_420, this can also be represented using the incomplete elliptic integral of the second kind formula_421 with parameter formula_422:

formula_423

Using only real numbers, this becomes

formula_424

where formula_56 is the incomplete elliptic integral of the first kind with parameter formula_422 and formula_427 is the Gudermannian function.

==Derived curves==

Several other curves can be derived from the hyperbola by inversion, the so-called inverse curves of the hyperbola. If the center of inversion is chosen as the hyperbola&#x27;s own center, the inverse curve is the lemniscate of Bernoulli; the lemniscate is also the envelope of circles centered on a rectangular hyperbola and passing through the origin. If the center of inversion is chosen at a focus or a vertex of the hyperbola, the resulting inverse curves are a limaçon or a strophoid, respectively.

==Elliptic coordinates==
A family of confocal hyperbolas is the basis of the system of elliptic coordinates in two dimensions. These hyperbolas are described by the equation

formula_428

where the foci are located at a distance &quot;c&quot; from the origin on the &quot;x&quot;-axis, and where θ is the angle of the asymptotes with the &quot;x&quot;-axis. Every hyperbola in this family is orthogonal to every ellipse that shares the same foci. This orthogonality may be shown by a conformal map of the Cartesian coordinate system &quot;w&quot; = &quot;z&quot; + 1/&quot;z&quot;, where &quot;z&quot;= &quot;x&quot; + &quot;iy&quot; are the original Cartesian coordinates, and &quot;w&quot;=&quot;u&quot; + &quot;iv&quot; are those after the transformation.

Other orthogonal two-dimensional coordinate systems involving hyperbolas may be obtained by other conformal mappings. For example, the mapping &quot;w&quot; = &quot;z&quot;2 transforms the Cartesian coordinate system into two families of orthogonal hyperbolas.

==Conic section analysis of the hyperbolic appearance of circles==

Besides providing a uniform description of circles, ellipses, parabolas, and hyperbolas, conic sections can also be understood as a natural model of the geometry of perspective in the case where the scene being viewed consists of circles, or more generally an ellipse. The viewer is typically a camera or the human eye and the image of the scene a central projection onto an image plane, that is, all projection rays pass a fixed point &quot;O&quot;, the center. The lens plane is a plane parallel to the image plane at the lens &quot;O&quot;.

The image of a circle c is

(Special positions where the circle plane contains point &quot;O&quot; are omitted.)

These results can be understood if one recognizes that the projection process can be seen in two steps: 1) circle c and point &quot;O&quot; generate a cone which is 2) cut by the image plane, in order to generate the image.

One sees a hyperbola whenever catching sight of a portion of a circle cut by one&#x27;s lens plane. The inability to see very much of the arms of the visible branch, combined with the complete absence of the second branch, makes it virtually impossible for the human visual system to recognize the connection with hyperbolas.

==Applications==

===Sundials===
Hyperbolas may be seen in many sundials. On any given day, the sun revolves in a circle on the celestial sphere, and its rays striking the point on a sundial traces out a cone of light. The intersection of this cone with the horizontal plane of the ground forms a conic section. At most populated latitudes and at most times of the year, this conic section is a hyperbola. In practical terms, the shadow of the tip of a pole traces out a hyperbola on the ground over the course of a day (this path is called the &quot;declination line&quot;). The shape of this hyperbola varies with the geographical latitude and with the time of the year, since those factors affect the cone of the sun&#x27;s rays relative to the horizon. The collection of such hyperbolas for a whole year at a given location was called a &quot;pelekinon&quot; by the Greeks, since it resembles a double-bladed axe.

===Multilateration===
A hyperbola is the basis for solving multilateration problems, the task of locating a point from the differences in its distances to given points — or, equivalently, the difference in arrival times of synchronized signals between the point and the given points. Such problems are important in navigation, particularly on water; a ship can locate its position from the difference in arrival times of signals from a LORAN or GPS transmitters. Conversely, a homing beacon or any transmitter can be located by comparing the arrival times of its signals at two separate receiving stations; such techniques may be used to track objects and people. In particular, the set of possible positions of a point that has a distance difference of 2&quot;a&quot; from two given points is a hyperbola of vertex separation 2&quot;a&quot; whose foci are the two given points.

===Path followed by a particle===
The path followed by any particle in the classical Kepler problem is a conic section. In particular, if the total energy &quot;E&quot; of the particle is greater than zero (that is, if the particle is unbound), the path of such a particle is a hyperbola. This property is useful in studying atomic and sub-atomic forces by scattering high-energy particles; for example, the Rutherford experiment demonstrated the existence of an atomic nucleus by examining the scattering of alpha particles from gold atoms. If the short-range nuclear interactions are ignored, the atomic nucleus and the alpha particle interact only by a repulsive Coulomb force, which satisfies the inverse square law requirement for a Kepler problem.

===Korteweg–de Vries equation===
The hyperbolic trig function formula_429 appears as one solution to the Korteweg–de Vries equation which describes the motion of a soliton wave in a canal.

===Angle trisection===
As shown first by Apollonius of Perga, a hyperbola can be used to trisect any angle, a well studied problem of geometry. Given an angle, first draw a circle centered at its vertex O, which intersects the sides of the angle at points A and B. Next draw the line segment with endpoints A and B and its perpendicular bisector formula_430. Construct a hyperbola of eccentricity &quot;e&quot;=2 with formula_430 as directrix and B as a focus. Let P be the intersection (upper) of the hyperbola with the circle. Angle POB trisects angle AOB.

To prove this, reflect the line segment OP about the line formula_430 obtaining the point P&#x27; as the image of P. Segment AP&#x27; has the same length as segment BP due to the reflection, while segment PP&#x27; has the same length as segment BP due to the eccentricity of the hyperbola. As OA, OP&#x27;, OP and OB are all radii of the same circle (and so, have the same length), the triangles OAP&#x27;, OPP&#x27; and OPB are all congruent. Therefore, the angle has been trisected, since 3×POB = AOB.

===Efficient portfolio frontier===
In portfolio theory, the locus of mean-variance efficient portfolios (called the efficient frontier) is the upper half of the east-opening branch of a hyperbola drawn with the portfolio return&#x27;s standard deviation plotted horizontally and its expected value plotted vertically; according to this theory, all rational investors would choose a portfolio characterized by some point on this locus.

===Biochemistry===
In biochemistry and pharmacology, the Hill equation and Hill-Langmuir equation respectively describe biological responses and the formation of protein–ligand complexes as functions of ligand concentration. They are both rectangular hyperbolae.

==Hyperbolas as plane sections of quadrics==
Hyperbolas appear as plane sections of the following quadrics:
* Elliptic cone
* Hyperbolic cylinder
* Hyperbolic paraboloid
* Hyperboloid of one sheet
* Hyperboloid of two sheets

<text>Nasir al-Din Muhammad (6 March 1508 – 27 January 1556), commonly known by his regnal name Humayun (), was the second Mughal emperor, who ruled over territory in what is now Eastern Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Northern India, and Pakistan from 1530 to 1540 and again from 1555 to his death in 1556. At the time of his death, the Mughal Empire spanned almost one million square kilometers.

On 26 December 1530, Humayun succeeded his father Babur to the throne of Delhi as ruler of the Mughal territories in the Indian subcontinent. Humayun was an inexperienced ruler when he came to power at the age of 22. His half-brother Kamran Mirza inherited Kabul and Kandahar, the northernmost parts of their father&#x27;s empire; the two half-brothers became bitter rivals.

Early in his reign, Humayun lost his entire empire to Sher Shah Suri but regained it 15 years later with Safavid aid. His return from Persia was accompanied by a large retinue of Persian noblemen, signaling an important change in Mughal court culture. The Central Asian origins of the dynasty were largely overshadowed by the influences of Persian art, architecture, language, and literature. To this day, stone carvings and thousands of Persian manuscripts in India dating from the time of Humayun remain in the subcontinent. Following his return to power, Humayun quickly expanded the Empire, leaving a substantial legacy for his son, Akbar.

==Background==
Humayun was born as Nasir al-Din Muhammad to Babur&#x27;s favourite wife Māham Begum on Tuesday 6 March 1508. According to Abul Fazl, Māham was related to the noble family of Sultan Husayn Bayqara, the Timurid ruler of Herat. She was also related to Sheikh Ahmad-e Jami.

The decision of Babur to divide the territories of his empire between two of his sons was unusual in India, although it had been a common Central Asian practice since the time of Genghis Khan. Unlike most monarchies, which practised primogeniture, the Timurids followed the example of Genghis and did not leave an entire kingdom to the eldest son. Although under that system only a Chingissid could claim sovereignty and Khanal authority, any male Chinggisid within a given sub-branch had an equal right to the throne (though the Timurids were not Chinggisid in their paternal ancestry). While Genghis Khan&#x27;s Empire had been peacefully divided between his sons upon his death, almost every Chinggisid succession since had resulted in fratricide.

After Timur&#x27;s death, his territories were divided among Pir Muhammad, Miran Shah, Khalil Sultan and Shah Rukh, which resulted in inter-family warfare. Upon Babur&#x27;s death, Humayun&#x27;s territories were the least secure. He had ruled only four years, and not all &quot;umarah&quot; (nobles) viewed Humayun as the rightful ruler. Indeed, earlier, when Babur had become ill, some of the nobles had tried to install his brother-in-law, Mahdi Khwaja, as ruler. Although this attempt failed, it was a sign of problems to come.

==Early reign==

When Humayun came to the throne of the Mughal Empire, several of his brothers revolted against him after he split the empire among them. Another brother, Hindal Mirza, supported Humayun but was assassinated. The Emperor commenced construction of a tomb for his brother, but this was not yet finished when he was forced to flee to Persia. Sher Shah Suri destroyed the structure and no further work was done on it after Humayun&#x27;s restoration.

Humayun had two major rivals for his lands: Sultan Bahadur of Gujarat to the southwest and Sher Shah Suri (Sher Khan) settled along the river Ganges in Bihar to the east. Humayun&#x27;s first campaign was to confront Sher Shah Suri. Halfway through this offensive, Humayun had to abandon it to focus on Gujarat, where a threat from Ahmed Shah had emerged. Humayun was victorious annexing Gujarat, Malwa, Champaner and the great fort of Mandu.

During the first five years of Humayun&#x27;s reign, Bahadur and Sher Khan extended their rule, although Sultan Bahadur faced pressure in the east from sporadic conflicts with the Portuguese. While the Mughals had obtained firearms via the Ottoman Empire, Bahadur&#x27;s Gujarat had acquired them through a series of contracts drawn up with the Portuguese, allowing the Portuguese to establish a strategic foothold in northwestern India.

In 1535 Humayun was made aware that the Sultan of Gujarat was planning an assault on the Mughal territories in Bayana with Portuguese aid. Humayun gathered an army and marched on Bahadur. Within a month he had captured the forts of Mandu and Champaner. However, instead of pressing his attack, Humayun ceased the campaign and consolidated his newly conquered territory. Sultan Bahadur, meanwhile escaped and took up refuge with the Portuguese. Like his father, Humayun was a frequent user of opium. In a popular revolt Bahadur Shah recaptured all of Gujarat in 1536 and began an attack on Malwa.

==Strife with Sher Shah Suri==
Shortly after Humayun had marched on Gujarat, Sher Shah Suri saw an opportunity to wrest control of Agra from the Mughals. He began to gather his army together hoping for a rapid and decisive siege of the Mughal capital. Upon hearing this alarming news, Humayun quickly marched his troops back to Agra allowing Bahadur to easily regain control of the territories Humayun had recently taken. In February 1537, however, Bahadur was killed when a botched plan to kidnap the Portuguese viceroy ended in a fire-fight that the Sultan lost. Bahadur&#x27;s passing caused a power vacuum in Gujarat, which ultimately paved the way for the Mughals to become the region&#x27;s dominant force.

While Humayun succeeded in protecting Agra from Sher Shah, the second city of the Empire, Gaur the capital of the &quot;vilayat&quot; of Bengal, was sacked. Humayun&#x27;s troops had been delayed while trying to take Chunar, a fort occupied by Sher Shah&#x27;s son, in order to protect his troops from an attack from the rear. The stores of grain at Gauri, the largest in the empire, were emptied, and Humayun arrived to see corpses littering the roads. The vast wealth of Bengal was depleted and brought East, giving Sher Shah a substantial war chest.

Sher Shah withdrew to the east, but Humayun did not follow: instead he &quot;shut himself up for a considerable time in his Harem, and indulged himself in every kind of luxury&quot;. Hindal, Humayun&#x27;s 19-year-old brother, had agreed to aid him in this battle and protect the rear from attack, but he abandoned his position and withdrew to Agra, where he decreed himself acting emperor. When Humayun sent the grand &quot;Mufti&quot;, Sheikh Buhlul, to reason with him; the Sheikh was killed. Further provoking the rebellion, Hindal ordered that the &quot;Khutba&quot;, or sermon, in the main mosque be surrounded.

Humayun&#x27;s other brother, Kamran Mirza, marched from his territories in the Punjab, ostensibly to aid Humayun. However, his return home had treacherous motives as he intended to stake a claim for Humayun&#x27;s apparently collapsing empire. He brokered a deal with Hindal providing that his brother would cease all acts of disloyalty in return for a share in the new empire, which Kamran would create once Humayun was deposed.

In June 1539 Sher Shah met Humayun in the Battle of Chausa on the banks of the Ganges, near Buxar. This was to become an entrenched battle in which both sides spent a lot of time digging themselves into positions. The major part of the Mughal army, the artillery, was now immobile, and Humayun decided to engage in some diplomacy using Muhammad Aziz as ambassador. Humayun agreed to allow Sher Shah to rule over Bengal and Bihar, but only as provinces granted to him by his Emperor, Humayun, falling short of outright sovereignty. The two rulers also struck a bargain in order to save face: Humayun&#x27;s troops would charge those of Sher Shah whose forces then retreat in feigned fear. Thus honour would, supposedly, be satisfied.

Once the Army of Humayun had made its charge and Sher Shah&#x27;s troops made their agreed-upon retreat, the Mughal troops relaxed their defensive preparations and returned to their entrenchments without posting a proper guard. Observing the Mughals&#x27; vulnerability, Sher Shah reneged on his earlier agreement. That very night, his army approached the Mughal camp and finding the Mughal troops unprepared with a majority asleep, they advanced and killed most of them. The Emperor survived by swimming across the Ganges using an air-filled &quot;water skin&quot;, and quietly returned to Agra. Humayun was assisted across the Ganges by Shams al-Din Muhammad.

===In Agra===
When Humayun returned to Agra, he found that all three of his brothers were present. Humayun once again not only pardoned his brothers for plotting against him, but even forgave Hindal for his outright betrayal. With his armies travelling at a leisurely pace, Sher Shah was gradually drawing closer and closer to Agra. This was a serious threat to the entire family, but Humayun and Kamran squabbled over how to proceed. Kamran withdrew after Humayun refused to make a quick attack on the approaching enemy, instead opting to build a larger army under his own name.

When Kamran returned to Lahore, Humayun, with his other brothers Askari and Hindal, marched to meet Sher Shah east of Agra at the battle of Kannauj on 17 May 1540. Humayun was soundly defeated. He retreated to Agra, pursued by Sher Shah, and thence through Delhi to Lahore. Sher Shah&#x27;s founding of the short-lived Sur Empire, with its capital at Delhi, resulted in Humayun&#x27;s exile for 15 years in the court of Shah Tahmasp I.

===In Lahore===
The four brothers were united in Lahore, but every day they were informed that Sher Shah was getting closer and closer. When he reached Sirhind, Humayun sent an ambassador carrying the message &quot;I have left you the whole of Hindustan [i.e. the lands to the East of Punjab, comprising most of the Ganges Valley]. Leave Lahore alone, and let Sirhind be a boundary between you and me.&quot; Sher Shah, however, replied &quot;I have left you Kabul. You should go there.&quot; Kabul was the capital of the empire of Humayun&#x27;s brother Kamran, who was far from willing to hand over any of his territories to his brother. Instead, Kamran approached Sher Shah and proposed that he actually revolt against his brother and side with Sher Shah in return for most of the Punjab. Sher Shah dismissed his help, believing it not to be required, though word soon spread to Lahore about the treacherous proposal, and Humayun was urged to make an example of Kamran and kill him. Humayun refused, citing the last words of his father, Babur, &quot;Do nothing against your brothers, even though they may deserve it.&quot;

===Meeting with the Sikh Guru – Guru Angad Sahib===
Humayun visited Guru Angad at around 1540 after Humayun lost the Battle of Kannauj, and thereby the Mughal throne to Sher Shah Suri. According to Sikh hagiographies, when Humayun arrived in Gurdwara Mal Akhara Sahib at Khadur Sahib, Guru Angad was sitting and teaching children. The failure to greet the Emperor immediately angered Humayun. Humayun lashed out but the Guru reminded him that the time when you needed to fight when you lost your throne you ran away and did not fight and now you want to attack a person engaged in prayer. In the Sikh texts written more than a century after the event, Guru Angad is said to have blessed the emperor, and reassured him that someday he will regain the throne.

===Withdrawing further===

Humayun decided it would be wise to withdraw still further. He and his army rode out through and across the Thar Desert, when the Hindu ruler Rao Maldeo Rathore allied with Sher Shah Suri against the Mughal Empire. In many accounts Humayun mentions how he and his pregnant wife had to trace their steps through the desert at the hottest time of year. Their rations were low, and they had little to eat; even drinking water was a major problem in the desert. When Hamida Bano&#x27;s horse died, no one would lend the Queen (who was now eight months pregnant) a horse, so Humayun did so himself, resulting in him riding a camel for six kilometres (four miles), although Khaled Beg then offered him his mount. Humayun was later to describe this incident as the lowest point in his life. Humayun asked that his brothers join him as he fell back into Sindh. While the previously rebellious Hindal Mirza remained loyal and was ordered to join his brothers in Kandahar, Kamran Mirza and Askari Mirza instead decided to head to the relative peace of Kabul. This was to be a definitive schism in the family. Humayun headed for Sindh because he expected aid from the Emir of Sindh, Hussein Umrani, whom he had appointed and who owed him his allegiance. Also, his wife Hamida hailed from Sindh; she was the daughter of a prestigious &quot;pir&quot; family (a &quot;pir&quot; is an Islamic religious guide) of Persian heritage long settled in Sindh. En route to the Emir&#x27;s court, Humayun had to break journey because his pregnant wife Hamida was unable to travel further. Humayun sought refuge with the Hindu ruler of the oasis town of Amarkot (now part of Sindh province).

Rana Prasad Rao of Amarkot duly welcomed Humayun into his home and sheltered the refugees for several months. Here, in the household of a Hindu Rajput nobleman, Humayun&#x27;s wife Hamida Bano, daughter of a Sindhi family, gave birth to the future Emperor Akbar on 15 October 1542. The date of birth is well established because Humayun consulted his astronomer to utilise the astrolabe and check the location of the planets. The infant was the long-awaited heir-apparent to the 34-year-old Humayun and the answer of many prayers. Shortly after the birth, Humayun and his party left Amarkot for Sindh, leaving Akbar behind, who was not ready for the grueling journey ahead in his infancy. He was later adopted by Askari Mirza.

For a change, Humayun was not deceived in the character of the man on whom he has pinned his hopes. Emir Hussein Umrani, ruler of Sindh, welcomed Humayun&#x27;s presence and was loyal to him, just as he had been loyal to Babur against the renegade Arghuns. While in Sindh, Humayun alongside Hussein Umrani, gathered horses and weapons and formed new alliances that helped regain lost territories. Until finally Humayun had gathered hundreds of Sindhi and Baloch tribesmen alongside his Mughals and then marched towards Kandahar and later Kabul, thousands more gathered by his side as Humayun continually declared himself the rightful Timurid heir of the first Mughal Emperor, Babur.

==Retreat to Kabul==
After Humayun set out from his expedition in Sindh, along with 300 camels (mostly wild) and 2000 loads of grain, he set off to join his brothers in Kandahar after crossing the Indus River on 11 July 1543 along with the ambition to regain the Mughal Empire and overthrow the Suri dynasty. Among the tribes that had sworn allegiance to Humayun were the Leghari, Magsi, Rind and many others.

In Kamran Mirza&#x27;s territory, Hindal Mirza had been placed under house arrest in Kabul after refusing to have the &quot;Khutba&quot; recited in Kamran Mirza&#x27;s name. His other brother, Askari Mirza, was now ordered to gather an army and march on Humayun. When Humayun received word of the approaching hostile army he decided against facing them, and instead sought refuge elsewhere. Akbar was left behind in camp close to Kandahar, as it was December, too cold and dangerous to include the 14-month-old toddler in the march through the mountains of the Hindu Kush. Askari Mirza took Akbar in, leaving the wives of Kamran and Askari Mirza to raise him. The &quot;Akbarnama&quot; specifies Kamran Mirza&#x27;s wife, Sultan Begam.

Once again Humayun turned toward Kandahar where his brother Kamran Mirza was in power, but he received no help and had to seek refuge with the Shah of Persia

==Refuge in Persia==

Humayun fled to the refuge of the Safavid Empire in Persia, marching with 40 men, his wife Bega Begum, and her companion through mountains and valleys. Among other trials the Imperial party were forced to live on horse meat boiled in the soldiers&#x27; helmets. These indignities continued during the month it took them to reach Herat, however after their arrival they were reintroduced to the finer things in life. Upon entering the city his army was greeted with an armed escort, and they were treated to lavish food and clothing. They were given fine accommodations and the roads were cleared and cleaned before them. The Shah, Tahmasp I, unlike Humayun&#x27;s own family, actually welcomed the Mughal, and treated him as a royal visitor. Here Humayun went sightseeing and was amazed at the Persian artwork and architecture he saw: much of this was the work of the Timurid Sultan Husayn Bayqarah and his ancestor, princess Gauhar Shad, thus he was able to admire the work of his relatives and ancestors at first hand.

The Mughal monarch was introduced to the work of the Persian miniaturists, and Kamaleddin Behzad sent two of his pupils to join Humayun&#x27;s court. Humayun was amazed by their work and asked if they would serve him if he regained the sovereignty of Hindustan; they agreed. With so much happening, Humayun did not meet Tahmasp until July, six months after his arrival in Persia. After a lengthy journey from Herat the two met in Qazvin where a large feast and parties were held for the event. The meeting of the two emperors is depicted in a famous wall-painting in the Chehel Sotoun (Forty Columns) palace in Esfahan.

Tahmasp urged that Humayun convert from Sunni to Shia Islam in order to keep himself and several hundred followers alive. Although the Mughals initially disagreed to their conversion they knew that with this outward acceptance of Shi&#x27;ism, Tahmasp was eventually prepared to offer Humayun more substantial support. When Humayun&#x27;s brother, Kamran Mirza, offered to cede Kandahar to the Persians in exchange for Humayun, dead or alive, Tahmasp refused. Instead he staged a celebration, with 300 tents, an imperial Persian carpet, 12 musical bands and &quot;meat of all kinds&quot;. Here the Shah announced that all this, and 12,000 elite cavalry were Humayun&#x27;s to lead an attack on Kamran. All that Tahmasp asked for was that, if Humayun&#x27;s forces were victorious, Kandahar would be his.

==Kandahar and onward==
With this Persian Safavid aid Humayun took Kandahar from Askari Mirza after a two-week siege. He noted how the nobles who had served Askari Mirza quickly flocked to serve him, &quot;in very truth the greater part of the inhabitants of the world are like a flock of sheep, wherever one goes the others immediately follow&quot;. Kandahar was, as agreed, given to the Shah of Persia who sent his infant son, Murad, as the viceroy. However, the baby soon died and Humayun thought himself strong enough to assume power.

Humayun now prepared to take Kabul, ruled by his brother Kamran Mirza. In the end, there was no actual siege. Kamran Mirza was detested as a leader and as Humayun&#x27;s Persian army approached the city hundreds of the former&#x27;s troops changed sides, flocking to join Humayun and swelling his ranks. Kamran Mirza absconded and began building an army outside the city. In November 1545, Hamida and Humayun were reunited with their son Akbar, and held a huge feast. They also held another feast in the child&#x27;s honour when he was circumcised.

However, while Humayun had a larger army than Kamran Mirza and had the upper hand, on two occasions his poor military judgement allowed the latter to retake Kabul and Kandahar, forcing Humayun to mount further campaigns for their recapture. He might have been aided by his reputation for leniency towards the troops who had defended the cities against him, unlike Kamran Mirza, whose brief periods of possession were marked by atrocities against the inhabitants who he believed had helped his brother.

His youngest brother, Hindal Mirza, formerly the most disloyal of his siblings, died fighting on his behalf. His brother Askari Mirza was shackled in chains at the behest of his nobles and aides. He was allowed go on Hajj, and died en route in the desert outside Damascus.

Humayun&#x27;s other brother, Kamran Mirza, had repeatedly sought to have him killed. In 1552 Kamran Mirza attempted to make a pact with Islam Shah, Sher Shah&#x27;s successor, but was apprehended by a Gakhar. The Gakhars were one of the minority of tribal groups who had consistently remained loyal to their oath to the Mughals. Sultan Adam of the Gakhars handed Kamran Mirza over to Humayun. Humayun, though inclined to forgive Kamran Mirza, was warned that allowing his brother&#x27;s repeated acts of treachery to go unpunished could foment rebellion amongst his own supporters. So, instead of killing Kamran Mirza, Humayun had him blinded, thereby ending any claim by the latter to the throne. He then sent Kamran Mirza on Hajj, as he hoped to see his brother thereby absolved of his offences. However Kamran Mirza died close to Mecca in the Arabian Peninsula in 1557.

==Restoration of the Mughal Empire==

In 1535, When Humayun was Governor of Gujarat, he encamped near Cambay (Khambhat). Humayun and his army was robbed and plundered by Kolis of Gujarat.

Sher Shah Suri died in 1545, and his son and successor, Islam Shah, died in 1554. These two deaths left the dynasty reeling and disintegrating. Three rivals for the throne marched on Delhi, while in many cities, leaders tried to stake a claim for independence. This created a perfect opportunity for the Mughals to march back to India.

The Mughal Emperor Humayun gathered a vast army and attempted the challenging task of retaking the throne in Delhi. Due to the Safavid role in Humayun&#x27;s army, the vast majority of the soldiers were of the Shi’a faith. As one Shaikh Ahmad described to Humayun, &quot;My king, I see the whole of your army are Rafizi... Everywhere the names of your soldiers are of this kind. I find they are all Yar Ali or Kashfi Ali or Haider Ali and I have, not found a single man bearing the names of the other Companions.&quot; Humayun placed the army under the leadership of Bairam Khan, a wise move given Humayun&#x27;s record of military ineptitude, and it turned out to be prescient as Bairam proved himself a great tactician.

Bairam Khan led the army through the Punjab virtually unopposed. The only major battle faced by Humayun&#x27;s armies was against Sikandar Shah Suri in Sirhind, where Bairam Khan employed a tactic whereby he engaged his enemy in open battle but then retreated quickly in apparent fear. When the enemy followed after them, they were surprised by entrenched defensive positions and were easily annihilated. At the Battle of Sirhind on 22 June 1555, the armies of Sikandar Shah Suri were decisively defeated and the Mughal Empire was reestablished.

After Sirhind, most towns and villages chose to welcome the invading army as it made its way to the capital. On 23 July 1555, Humayun once again sat on Babur&#x27;s throne in Delhi.

===Marriage relations with the Khanzadas===
The &quot;Gazetteer of Ulwur&quot; states:
===Ruling Kashmir===
With all of Humayun&#x27;s brothers now dead, there was no fear of another usurping his throne during his military campaigns. He was also now an established leader and could trust his generals. With this new-found strength Humayun embarked on a series of military campaigns aimed at extending his reign over areas in the east and west of the subcontinent. His sojourn in exile seems to have reduced his reliance, and his military leadership came to imitate the more effective methods that he had observed in Persia.

==Character==
Edward S. Holden writes; &quot;He was uniformly kind and considerate to his dependents, devotedly attached to his son Akbar, to his friends, and to his turbulent brothers. The misfortunes of his reign arose in great part, from his failure to treat them with rigor.&quot; He further writes: &quot;The very defects of his character, which render him less admirable as a successful ruler of nations, make us more fond of him as a man. His renown has suffered in that his reign came between the brilliant conquests of Babur and the beneficent statesmanship of Akbar; but he was not unworthy to be the son of the one and the father of the other.&quot;

Stanley Lane-Poole writes in his book &quot;Medieval India&quot;: &quot;His name meant the winner (Lucky/Conqueror), there is no king in the history to be named as wrong as Humayun&quot;, he was of a forgiving nature. He further writes, &quot;He was in fact unfortunate ... Scarcely had he enjoyed his throne for six months in Delhi when he slipped down from the polished steps of his palace and died in his forty-ninth year (Jan. 24, 1556). If there was a possibility of falling, Humayun was not the man to miss it. He tumbled through his life and tumbled out of it.&quot;

Humayun ordered the crushing by elephant of an imam he mistakenly believed to be critical of his reign.

==Death and legacy==

On 24 January 1556, Humayun, with his arms full of books, was descending the staircase from his library Sher Mandal when the muezzin announced the Azaan (the call to prayer). It was his habit, wherever and whenever he heard the summons, to bow his knee in holy reverence. Trying to kneel, he caught his foot in his robe, slipped down several steps and hit his temple on a rugged stone edge. He died three days later. His body was laid to rest in Purana Quila initially, but, because of an attack by Hemu on Delhi and the capture of Purana Qila, Humayun&#x27;s body was exhumed by the fleeing army and transferred to Kalanaur in Punjab where Akbar was crowned. After young Mughal emperor Akbar defeated and killed Hemu in the Second Battle of Panipat. Humayun&#x27;s body was buried in Humayun&#x27;s Tomb in Delhi the first very grand garden tomb in Mughal architecture, setting the precedent later followed by the Taj Mahal and many other Indian monuments. It was commissioned by his favorite and devoted chief wife, Bega Begum.

Akbar later asked his paternal aunt, Gulbadan Begum, to write a biography of his father Humayun, the &quot;Humayun nameh&quot; (or &quot;Humayun-nama&quot;), and what she remembered of Babur.
The full title is &quot;Ahwal Humayun Padshah Jamah Kardom Gulbadan Begum bint Babur Padshah amma Akbar Padshah&quot;. She was only eight when Babur died, and was married at 17, and her work is in simple Persian style.
Unlike other Mughal royal biographies (the &quot;Zafarnama&quot; of Timur, &quot;Baburnama&quot;, and Akbar&#x27;s own &quot;Akbarnama&quot;) no richly illustrated copy has survived, and the work is only known from a single battered and slightly incomplete manuscript, now in the British Library, that emerged in the 1860s. Annette Beveridge published an English translation in 1901, and editions in English and Bengali have been published since 2000.

<text>The prince-electors ( pl. , , ) were the members of the electoral college that elected the ruler of the Holy Roman Empire. Usually, half of the electors were archbishops.

From the 13th century onwards, a small group of prince-electors gained the privilege of electing the King of the Romans. The king would then later be crowned Emperor by the pope. Charles V (elected in 1519) was the last emperor to be crowned (1530); his successors assumed the title &quot;Elected Emperor of the Romans&quot; (; ) upon their coronation as kings.

The dignity of elector carried great prestige and was considered to be behind only the emperor, kings, and the highest dukes. The electors held exclusive privileges that were not shared with other princes of the Empire, and they continued to hold their original titles alongside that of elector.

The heir apparent to a secular prince-elector was known as an electoral prince ().

== Rights and privileges ==
Electors were rulers of (Imperial Estates), enjoying precedence over the other Imperial Princes. They were, until the 18th century, exclusively entitled to be addressed with the title (Serene Highness). In 1742, the electors became entitled to the superlative (Most Serene Highness), while other princes were promoted to .

As rulers of Imperial Estates, the electors enjoyed all the privileges of princes, including the right to enter into alliances, to autonomy in relation to dynastic affairs, and to precedence over other subjects. The Golden Bull granted them the Privilegium de non appellando, which prevented their subjects from lodging an appeal to a higher Imperial court. Although this privilege, and some others, were automatically granted to Electors, they were not exclusive to them and many of the larger Imperial Estates were also to be individually granted some or all those rights and privileges.

== Imperial Diet ==
The electors, like the other princes ruling States of the Empire, were members of the Imperial Diet, which was divided into three &quot;collegia&quot;: the Council of Electors, the Council of Princes, and the Council of Cities. In addition to being members of the Council of Electors, most electors were also members of the Council of Princes by virtue of possessing territory or holding ecclesiastical position. The assent of both bodies was required for important decisions affecting the structure of the Empire, such as the creation of new electorates or States of the Empire.

Many electors ruled a number of States of the Empire or held several ecclesiastical titles, and therefore had multiple votes in the Council of Princes. In 1792, the Elector of Brandenburg had eight votes, the Elector of Bavaria six votes, the Elector of Hanover six votes, the King of Bohemia three votes, the Elector-Archbishop of Trier three votes, the Elector-Archbishop of Cologne two votes, and the Elector-Archbishop of Mainz one vote. Thus, of the hundred votes in the Council of Princes in 1792, twenty-nine belonged to electors, giving them considerable influence in the Council of Princes in addition to their positions as electors.

In addition to voting by colleges or councils, the Imperial Diet also voted in religious coalitions, as provided for in the Peace of Westphalia. The Archbishop of Mainz presided over the Catholic body, the , while the Elector of Saxony presided over the Protestant body, the . The division into religious bodies was on the basis of the official religion of the state.

== Elections ==
The electors were originally summoned by the Archbishop of Mainz within one month of an Emperor&#x27;s death, and met within three months of being summoned. During the &quot;interregnum&quot;, imperial power was exercised by two imperial vicars. Each vicar, in the words of the Golden Bull, was &quot;the administrator of the empire itself, with the power of passing judgments, of presenting to ecclesiastical benefices, of collecting returns and revenues and investing with fiefs, of receiving oaths of fealty for and in the name of the holy empire&quot;. The Elector of Saxony was vicar in areas operating under Saxon law (Saxony, Westphalia, Hannover, and northern Germany), while the Elector Palatine was vicar in the remainder of the Empire (Franconia, Swabia, the Rhine, and southern Germany). The Elector of Bavaria replaced the Elector Palatine in 1623, but when the latter was granted a new electorate in 1648, there was a dispute between the two as to which was vicar. In 1659, both purported to act as vicar, but ultimately, the other vicar recognized the Elector of Bavaria. Later, the two electors made a pact to act as joint vicars, but the Imperial Diet rejected the agreement. In 1711, while the Elector of Bavaria was under the ban of the Empire, the Elector Palatine again acted as vicar, but his cousin was restored to his position upon his restoration three years later.

Finally, in 1745, the two agreed to alternate as vicars, with Bavaria starting first. This arrangement was upheld by the Imperial Diet in 1752. In 1777, the question was settled when the Elector Palatine inherited Bavaria. On many occasions, however, there was no interregnum, as a new king had been elected during the lifetime of the previous Emperor.

Frankfurt regularly served as the site of the election from the 14th century on, but elections were also held at Cologne (1531), Regensburg (1575 and 1636), and Augsburg (1653 and 1690). An elector could appear in person or could appoint another elector as his proxy. More often, an electoral suite or embassy was sent to cast the vote; the credentials of such representatives were verified by the Archbishop of Mainz, who presided over the ceremony. The deliberations were held at the city hall, but voting occurred in the cathedral. In Frankfurt, a special electoral chapel, or , was used for elections. Under the Golden Bull, a majority of electors sufficed to elect a king, and each elector could cast only one vote. Electors were free to vote for whomsoever they pleased (including themselves), but dynastic considerations played a great part in the choice.

From the 16th century on, electors drafted a , or electoral capitulation, which was presented to the king-elect. The capitulation may be described as a contract between the princes and the king, the latter conceding rights and powers to the electors and other princes. Once an individual swore to abide by the electoral capitulation, he assumed the office of King of the Romans.

In the 10th and 11th centuries, princes often acted merely to confirm hereditary succession in the Ottonian and Salian dynasties. But with the actual formation of the prince-elector class, elections became more open, starting with the election of Lothair III in 1125. The Staufen dynasty managed to get its sons formally elected in their fathers&#x27; lifetimes almost as a formality. After those lines ended in extinction, the electors began to elect kings from different families, so that the throne would not once again settle within a single dynasty. All kings elected from 1438 onwards were from among the Habsburg dynasty until 1740, when Austria was inherited by a woman, Maria Theresa, sparking the War of the Austrian Succession and the short-lived rule of a Bavarian Wittelsbach emperor. In 1745, Maria Theresa&#x27;s husband, Francis I of Lorraine, was elected emperor. All of his successors were also from the Habsburg-Lorraine family. 

=== High offices ===

Each elector held a &quot;High Office of the Empire&quot; () analogous to a modern cabinet office position and was a member of the ceremonial Imperial Household. The three spiritual electors became Archchancellors (, ): the Archbishop of Mainz became &quot;Archchancellor of Germany&quot;, the Archbishop of Cologne became &quot;Archchancellor of Italy&quot;, and the Archbishop of Trier became &quot;Archchancellor of Burgundy&quot;. The secular electors were granted heraldic augmentations to their coats of arms reflecting their positions in the Household. These augmentations were displayed in three alternative ways:
* as an inescutcheon on their coat of arms (as in the case of the Arch-Steward, Treasurer, and Chamberlain);
* as dexter impalements (as in the case of the Arch-Marshal and Arch-Bannerbearer)
* integrated into the charge within the escutcheon (as in the case of the Arch-Cupbearer, where the Lion of Bohemia acquired a &quot;simple crown&quot; held in its dexter paw).

When the Duke of Bavaria replaced the Elector Palatine in 1623, he assumed the latter&#x27;s office of Arch-Steward. When the Count Palatine was granted a new electorate, he assumed the position of Arch-Treasurer of the Empire. When the Duke of Bavaria was banned in 1706, the Elector Palatine returned to the office of Arch-Steward, and in 1710, the Elector of Hanover was promoted to the post of Arch-Treasurer. Matters were complicated by the Duke of Bavaria&#x27;s restoration in 1714; the Elector of Bavaria resumed the office of Arch-Steward, while the Elector Palatine returned to the post of Arch-Treasurer, and the Elector of Hanover was given the new office of Archbannerbearer. The Electors of Hanover, however, continued to be styled Arch-Treasurers, though the Elector Palatine was the one who actually exercised the office until 1777, when he inherited Bavaria and the Arch-Stewardship. After 1777, no further changes were made to the Imperial Household; new offices were planned for the Electors admitted in 1803, but the Empire was abolished before they could be created. The Duke of Württemberg, however, started to adopt the trappings of the Arch-Bannerbearer.

The electors discharged the ceremonial duties associated with their offices only during coronations, where they bore the crown and regalia of the Empire. Otherwise, they were represented by holders of corresponding &quot;Hereditary Offices of the Household&quot;. The Arch-Butler was represented by the Hereditary Butler (Cupbearer) (the Count of Althann), the Arch-Seneschal by the Hereditary Steward (the Count of Waldburg, who adopted the title into their name as &quot;Truchsess von Waldburg&quot;), the Arch-Chamberlain by the Hereditary Chamberlain (the Count of Hohenzollern), the Arch-Marshal by the Hereditary Marshal (the Count of Pappenheim), and the Arch-Treasurer by the Hereditary Treasurer (the Count of Sinzendorf). After 1803, the Duke of Württemberg as Arch-Bannerbearer assigned the count of Zeppelin-Aschhausen as Hereditary Bannerbearer.&lt;br&gt;

== History ==
The German practice of electing monarchs began when ancient Germanic tribes formed &quot;ad hoc&quot; coalitions and elected the leaders thereof. Elections were irregularly held by the Franks, whose successor states include France and the Holy Roman Empire. The French monarchy eventually became hereditary, but the Holy Roman Emperors remained elective. While all free men originally exercised the right to vote in such elections, suffrage eventually came to be limited to the leading men of the realm. In the election of Lothar III in 1125, a small number of eminent nobles chose the monarch and then submitted him to the remaining magnates for their approbation.

Soon, the right to choose the monarch was settled on an exclusive group of princes, and the procedure of seeking the approval of the remaining nobles was abandoned. The college of electors was mentioned in 1152 and again in 1198. The composition of electors at that time is unclear, but appears to have included bishops and the dukes of the stem duchies.

=== 1257 to Thirty Years&#x27; War ===

The electoral college is known to have existed by 1152, but its composition is unknown. A letter written by Pope Urban IV in 1265 suggests that by &quot;immemorial custom&quot;, seven princes had the right to elect the King and future Emperor. The pope wrote that the seven electors were those who had just voted in the election of 1257, which resulted in the election of two kings.

* Three ecclesiastical Electors:
** The Archbishop of Mainz
** The Archbishop of Trier
** The Archbishop of Cologne
* Four secular Electors:
** The King of Bohemia
** The Count Palatine of the Rhine
** The Duke of Saxony
** The Margrave of Brandenburg

The three Archbishops oversaw the most venerable and powerful sees in Germany. Since 1214, the Palatinate and Bavaria were held by the same individual, but in 1253, they were divided between two members of the House of Wittelsbach. The other electors refused to allow two princes from the same dynasty to have electoral rights, so a heated rivalry arose between the Count Palatine and the Duke of Bavaria over who should hold the Wittelsbach seat.

Meanwhile, the King of Bohemia, who held the ancient imperial office of Arch-Cupbearer, asserted his right to participate in elections. Sometimes he was challenged on the grounds that his kingdom was not German, though usually he was recognized, instead of Bavaria, which, after all, was just a younger line of Wittelsbachs.

The Declaration of Rhense issued in 1338 had the effect that election by the majority of the electors automatically conferred the royal title and rule over the empire, without papal confirmation. The Golden Bull of 1356 finally resolved the disputes among the electors. Under it, the Archbishops of Mainz, Trier, and Cologne, as well as the King of Bohemia, the Count Palatine of the Rhine, the Duke of Saxony, and the Margrave of Brandenburg held the right to elect the King.

The college&#x27;s composition remained unchanged until the 17th century, although the Electorate of Saxony was transferred from the senior to the junior branch of the Wettin family in 1547, in the aftermath of the Schmalkaldic War.

=== Thirty Years&#x27; War to Napoleon ===

In 1623, the Elector Palatine, Frederick V, came under the imperial ban after participating in the Bohemian Revolt (a part of the Thirty Years&#x27; War). The Elector Palatine&#x27;s seat was conferred on the Duke of Bavaria, the head of a junior branch of his family. Originally, the Duke held the electorate personally, but it was later made hereditary along with the duchy. When the Thirty Years&#x27; War concluded with the Peace of Westphalia in 1648, a new electorate was created for the Count Palatine of the Rhine. Since the Elector of Bavaria retained his seat, the number of electors increased to eight; the two Wittelsbach lines were now sufficiently estranged so as not to pose a combined potential threat.

In 1685, the religious composition of the College of Electors was disrupted when a Catholic branch of the Wittelsbach family inherited the Palatinate. A new Protestant electorate was created in 1692 for the Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg, who became known as the Elector of Hanover (the Imperial Diet officially confirmed the creation in 1708). The Elector of Saxony converted to Catholicism in 1697 so that he could become King of Poland, but no additional Protestant electors were created. Although the Elector of Saxony was personally Catholic, the Electorate itself remained officially Protestant, and the Elector even remained the leader of the Protestant body in the Reichstag.

In 1706, the Elector of Bavaria and Archbishop of Cologne were outlawed during the War of the Spanish Succession, but both were restored in 1714 after the Peace of Baden. In 1777, the number of electors was reduced to eight when the Elector Palatine inherited Bavaria.

Many changes to the composition of the college were necessitated by Napoleon&#x27;s aggression during the early 19th century. The Treaty of Lunéville (1801), which ceded territory on the Rhine&#x27;s left bank to France, led to the abolition of the archbishoprics of Trier and Cologne, and the transfer of the remaining spiritual Elector from Mainz to Regensburg. In 1803, electorates were created for the Duke of Württemberg, the Margrave of Baden, the Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel, and the Duke of Salzburg, bringing the total number of electors to ten. When Austria annexed Salzburg under the Treaty of Pressburg (1805), the Duke of Salzburg moved to the Grand Duchy of Würzburg and retained his electorate. None of the new electors, however, had an opportunity to cast votes, as the Holy Roman Empire was abolished in 1806, and the new electorates were never confirmed by the Emperor.

In 1788, the ruling family of Savoy pushed to receive an electoral title. Their ambition was backed by Brandenburg-Prussia. Nonetheless, the French Revolution and subsequent Coalition Wars soon rendered this a moot point.

=== After the Empire ===

After the abolition of the Holy Roman Empire in August 1806, the Electors continued to reign over their territories, many of them taking higher or alternative titles. The Electors of Bavaria, Württemberg, and Saxony styled themselves Kings, while the Electors of Baden, Regensburg, and Würzburg became Grand Dukes. The Elector of Hesse-Kassel, however, retained the meaningless title &quot;Elector of Hesse&quot;, thus distinguishing himself from other Hessian princes (the Grand Duke of Hesse(-Darmstadt) and the Landgrave of Hesse-Homburg). Napoleon soon exiled him and Kassel was annexed to the Kingdom of Westphalia, a new creation. The King of Great Britain remained at war with Napoleon and continued to style himself Elector of Hanover, while the Hanoverian government continued to operate in London.

The Congress of Vienna accepted the Electors of Bavaria, Württemberg, and Saxony as Kings, along with the newly created Grand Duke of Baden. The Elector of Hanover finally joined his fellow Electors by declaring himself the King of Hanover. The restored Elector of Hesse tried to be recognized as the King of the Chatti. The European powers refused to acknowledge this title at the Congress of Aix-la-Chapelle (1818), however, and instead listed him with the Grand Dukes as a &quot;Royal Highness&quot;. Believing the title of Prince-Elector to be superior in dignity to that of Grand Duke, the Elector of Hesse-Kassel chose to remain an Elector, even though there was no longer a Holy Roman Emperor to elect. Hesse-Kassel remained the only Electorate in Germany until 1866, when the country backed the losing side in the Austro-Prussian War and was absorbed into Prussia.

====Napoleonic additions====

As Napoleon waged war on Europe, between 1803 and 1806, the following changes to the Constitution of the Holy Roman Empire were attempted until the Empire&#x27;s collapse. The arch-chancellor of Germany and archbishop elector of Mainz continued to be an elector, but as the prince of Regensburg, which took over Mainz&#x27;s arch-episcopal status. The prince of Württemberg received the formerly defunct office of Arch-Bannerbearer, while the other new electors were not given augments or high office in the imperial household, though new offices were planned.

<text>Howard Robard Hughes Jr. (December 24, 1905 – April 5, 1976) 
was an American aerospace engineer, business magnate, film producer, investor, philanthropist and aircraft pilot. He was best known during his lifetime as one of the richest and most influential people in the world. He first became prominent as a film producer, and then as an important figure in the aviation industry. Later in life, he became known for his eccentric behavior and reclusive lifestyle—oddities that were caused in part by his worsening obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), chronic pain from a near-fatal plane crash, and increasing deafness.

As a film tycoon, Hughes gained fame in Hollywood beginning in the late 1920s, when he produced big-budget and often controversial films such as &quot;The Racket&quot; (1928), &quot;Hell&#x27;s Angels&quot; (1930), and &quot;Scarface&quot; (1932). He later acquired the RKO Pictures film studio in 1948, recognized then as one of the Big Five studios of Hollywood&#x27;s Golden Age, although the production company struggled under his control and ultimately ceased operations in 1957.

Through his interest in aviation and aerospace travel, Hughes formed the Hughes Aircraft Company in 1932, hiring numerous engineers, designers, and defense contractors. He spent the rest of the 1930s and much of the 1940s setting multiple world air speed records and building the Hughes H-1 Racer (1935) and the gigantic H-4 Hercules (the &quot;Spruce Goose&quot;, 1947), the largest flying boat in history with the longest wingspan of any aircraft from the time it was built until 2019. He acquired and expanded Trans World Airlines and later acquired Air West, renaming it Hughes Airwest. Hughes won the Harmon Trophy on two occasions (1936 and 1938), the Collier Trophy (1938), and the Congressional Gold Medal (1939) all for his achievements in aviation throughout the 1930s. He was inducted into the National Aviation Hall of Fame in 1973 and was included in &quot;Flying&quot; magazine&#x27;s 2013 list of the 51 Heroes of Aviation, ranked at 25.

During his final years, Hughes extended his financial empire to include several major businesses in Las Vegas, such as real estate, hotels, casinos, and media outlets. Known at the time as one of the most powerful men in the state of Nevada, he is largely credited with transforming Las Vegas into a more refined cosmopolitan city. After years of mental and physical decline, Hughes died of kidney failure in 1976. His legacy is maintained through the Howard Hughes Medical Institute and Howard Hughes Holdings Inc.

==Early life==

Howard Robard Hughes Jr. was the only child of Allene Stone Gano (1883–1922) and of Howard R. Hughes Sr. (1869–1924), a successful inventor and businessman from Missouri. He had English, Welsh and some French Huguenot ancestry, and was a descendant of John Gano (1727–1804), the minister who allegedly baptized George Washington. Through John Gano&#x27;s sister Sussanah, Hughes was a 5th cousin once-removed of the Wright brothers, Orville and Wilbur, who invented the first successful airplane.

Hughes Sr. patented the two-cone roller bit in 1909, which allowed rotary drilling for petroleum in previously inaccessible places. The senior Hughes made the shrewd and lucrative decision to commercialize the invention by leasing the bits instead of selling them, obtaining several early patents, and founding the Hughes Tool Company in 1909.

Hughes&#x27; uncle was the famed novelist, screenwriter, and film director Rupert Hughes.

A 1941 affidavit birth certificate of Hughes, signed by his aunt Annette Gano Lummis and by Estelle Boughton Sharp, states that he was born on December 24, 1905, in Harris County, Texas. However, his certificate of baptism, recorded on October 7, 1906, in the parish register of St. John&#x27;s Episcopal Church in Keokuk, Iowa, listed his date of birth as September 24, 1905, without any reference to the place of birth.

At a young age, Hughes Jr. showed interest in science and technology. In particular, he had a great engineering aptitude, and built Houston&#x27;s first &quot;wireless&quot; radio transmitter at age 11. He went on to be one of the first licensed ham-radio operators in Houston, having the assigned callsign W5CY (originally 5CY). At 12, Hughes was photographed for the local newspaper, which identified him as the first boy in Houston to have a &quot;motorized&quot; bicycle, which he had built from parts of his father&#x27;s steam engine. He was an indifferent student, with a liking for mathematics, flying, and mechanics. He took his first flying lesson at 14, and attended Fessenden School in Massachusetts in 1921.

After a brief stint at The Thacher School, Hughes attended math and aeronautical engineering courses at Caltech. The house where Hughes lived as a teenager at 3921 Yoakum Blvd., Houston, still stands, now known as Hughes House on the grounds of the University of St. Thomas.

His mother Allene died in March 1922 from complications of an ectopic pregnancy. Howard Hughes Sr. died of a heart attack in 1924. Their deaths apparently inspired Hughes to include the establishment of a medical research laboratory in the will that he signed in 1925 at age 19. Howard Sr.&#x27;s will had not been updated since Allene&#x27;s death, and Hughes Jr. inherited 75% of the family fortune. On his 19th birthday, Hughes was declared an emancipated minor, enabling him to take full control of his life.

From a young age, Hughes became a proficient and enthusiastic golfer. He often scored near-par figures, playing the game to a two-three handicap during his 20s, and for a time aimed for a professional golf career. He golfed frequently with top players, including Gene Sarazen. Hughes rarely played competitively and gradually gave up his passion for the sport to pursue other interests.

Hughes played golf every afternoon at LA courses including the Lakeside Golf Club, Wilshire Country Club, or the Bel-Air Country Club. Partners included George Von Elm or Ozzie Carlton. After Hughes hurt himself in the late 1920s, his golfing tapered off, and after his XF-11 crash, Hughes was unable to play at all.

Hughes withdrew from Rice University shortly after his father&#x27;s death. On June 1, 1925, he married Ella Botts Rice, daughter of David Rice and Martha Lawson Botts of Houston, and great-niece of William Marsh Rice, for whom Rice University was named. They moved to Los Angeles, where he hoped to make a name for himself as a filmmaker.

They moved into the Ambassador Hotel, and Hughes proceeded to learn to fly a Waco, while simultaneously producing his first motion picture, &quot;Swell Hogan&quot;.
In 1929, Hughes&#x27; wife of four years, Ella, returned to Houston and filed for divorce.

==Business career==
Hughes enjoyed a highly successful business career beyond engineering, aviation and film-making; many of his career endeavors involved varying entrepreneurial roles.

===Entertainment===
Ralph Graves persuaded Hughes to finance a short film, &quot;Swell Hogan&quot;, which Graves had written and would star in. Hughes himself produced it. When he screened it, he thought it was a disaster. After hiring a film editor to try to salvage it, he finally ordered that it be destroyed. His next two films, &quot;Everybody&#x27;s Acting&quot; (1926) and &quot;Two Arabian Knights&quot; (1927), achieved financial success; the latter won the first Academy Award for Best Director of a comedy picture. &quot;The Racket&quot; (1928) and &quot;The Front Page&quot; (1931) were also nominated for Academy Awards.

Hughes spent $3.5 million to make the flying film &quot;Hell&#x27;s Angels&quot; (1930). &quot;Hell&#x27;s Angels&quot; received one Academy Award nomination for Best Cinematography.

He produced another hit, &quot;Scarface&quot; (1932), a production delayed by censors&#x27; concern over its violence.

&quot;The Outlaw&quot; premiered in 1943, but was not released nationally until 1946. The film featured Jane Russell, who received considerable attention from industry censors, this time owing to her revealing costumes.

====RKO====


From the 1940s to the late 1950s, the Hughes Tool Company ventured into the film industry when it obtained partial ownership of the RKO companies, which included RKO Pictures, RKO Studios, a chain of movie theaters known as RKO Theatres and a network of radio stations known as the RKO Radio Network.

In 1948, Hughes gained control of RKO, a struggling major Hollywood studio, by acquiring the 929,000 shares owned by Floyd Odlum&#x27;s Atlas Corporation, for $8,825,000 ($107,165,160 in 2023). Within weeks of acquiring the studio, Hughes dismissed 700 employees. Production dwindled to 9 pictures during the first year of Hughes&#x27; control; previously RKO had averaged 30 per year.

That same year, 1948, he was able to arrange for his previous films with United Artists (UA), &quot;The Outlaw&quot;, &quot;Mad Wednesday&quot;, and &quot;Vendetta&quot; to be transferred to RKO. In exchange for the three completed being removed from UA distribution, Hughes and James and Theodore Nasser of General Service Studios would provide the financing of three independent films for distribution by UA. In terms of negotiations directly with RKO, the company agree to remove the production of the film &quot;Jet Pilot&quot; from David O. Selznick to Hughes. Hughes produced the film during the years 1949-1950 and owned RKO and in turn the distribution for the film. However, the film was not released until 1957 by Universal Pictures due in part to the subsequent events that would take place at RKO Distribution, and largely due the extra aerial film footage that had been filmed over the years after the film&#x27;s 1950 completion. Hughes was undertaking a final edit before the 1957 release.

After his acquisition of RKO, Hughes shut down production at the studio for six months, during which time he ordered investigations into the political leanings of every remaining RKO employee. Only after ensuring that the stars under contract to RKO had no suspect affiliations would Hughes approve completed pictures to be sent back for re-shooting. This was especially true of the women under contract to RKO at that time. If Hughes felt that his stars did not properly represent the political views of his liking or if a film&#x27;s anti-communist politics were not sufficiently clear, he pulled the plug. In 1952, an abortive sale to a Chicago-based five-man syndicate, two of whom had a history of complaints about their business practices and none with any experience in the movie industry, disrupted studio operations at RKO even further.

In 1953, Hughes became involved with a high-profile lawsuit as part of the settlement of the &quot;United States v. Paramount Pictures, Inc.&quot; Antitrust Case. As a result of the hearings, the shaky status of RKO became increasingly apparent. A steady stream of lawsuits from RKO&#x27;s minority shareholders had grown to become extremely annoying to Hughes. They had accused him of financial misconduct and corporate mismanagement. Since Hughes wanted to focus primarily on his aircraft manufacturing and TWA holdings during the years of the Korean War of 1950 to 1953, Hughes offered to buy out all other RKO stockholders in order to dispense with their distractions.

By the end of 1954, Hughes had gained near-total control of RKO at a cost of nearly $24 million, becoming the first sole owner of a major Hollywood studio since the silent-film era. Six months later Hughes sold the studio to the General Tire and Rubber Company for $25 million. Hughes retained the rights to pictures that he had personally produced, including those made at RKO. He also retained Jane Russell&#x27;s contract. For Howard Hughes, this was the virtual end of his 25-year involvement in the motion-picture industry. However, his reputation as a financial wizard emerged unscathed. During that time period, RKO became known as the home of classic &quot;film noir&quot; productions, thanks in part to the limited budgets required to make such films during Hughes&#x27; tenure. Hughes reportedly walked away from RKO having made $6.5 million in personal profit. According to Noah Dietrich, Hughes made a $10,000,000 profit from the sale of the theaters and made a profit of $1,000,000 from his 7-year ownership of RKO.

===Real estate===
According to Noah Dietrich, &quot;Land became a principal asset for the Hughes empire&quot;. Hughes acquired 1200 acres in Culver City for Hughes Aircraft, bought 7 sections [4,480 acres] in Tucson for his Falcon missile-plant, and purchased 25,000 acres near Las Vegas. In 1968, the Hughes Tool Company purchased the North Las Vegas Air Terminal.

Originally known as Summa Corporation, the Howard Hughes Corporation formed in 1972 when the oil-tools business of Hughes Tool Company, then owned by Howard Hughes Jr., floated on the New York Stock Exchange under the &quot;Hughes Tool&quot; name. This forced the remaining businesses of the &quot;original&quot; Hughes Tool to adopt a new corporate name: &quot;Summa&quot;. The name &quot;Summa&quot;Latin for &quot;highest&quot;was adopted without the approval of Hughes himself, who preferred to keep his own name on the business, and suggested &quot;HRH Properties&quot; (for Hughes Resorts and Hotels, and also his own initials). In 1988 Summa announced plans for Summerlin, a master-planned community named for the paternal grandmother of Howard Hughes, Jean Amelia Summerlin.

Initially staying in the Desert Inn, Hughes refused to vacate his room, and instead decided to purchase the entire hotel. Hughes extended his financial empire to include Las Vegas real estate, hotels, and media outlets, spending an estimated $300 million, and using his considerable powers to acquire many of the well-known hotels, especially the venues connected with organized crime. He quickly became one of the most powerful men in Las Vegas. He was instrumental in changing the image of Las Vegas from its Wild West and, later, Mafia / organized crime roots into a more refined cosmopolitan city. In addition to the Desert Inn, Hughes would eventually own the Sands, Frontier, Silver Slipper, Castaways, and Landmark and Harold&#x27;s Club in Reno. During his four years in Las Vegas, Hughes became the largest employer in Nevada.

===Aviation and aerospace===
Another portion of Hughes&#x27; commercial interests involved aviation, airlines, and the aerospace and defense industries. A lifelong aircraft enthusiast and pilot, Hughes survived four airplane accidents: one in a Thomas-Morse Scout while filming &quot;Hell&#x27;s Angels&quot;, one while setting the airspeed record in the Hughes Racer, one at Lake Mead in 1943, and the near-fatal crash of the Hughes XF-11 in 1946. At Rogers Airport in Los Angeles, he learned to fly from pioneer aviators, including Moye Stephens and J.B. Alexander. He set many world records and commissioned the construction of custom aircraft for himself while heading Hughes Aircraft at the airport in Glendale, CA. Operating from there, the most technologically important aircraft he commissioned was the Hughes H-1 Racer. On September 13, 1935, Hughes, flying the H-1, set the landplane airspeed record of over his test course near Santa Ana, California (Giuseppe Motta reaching 362 mph in 1929 and George Stainforth reached 407.5 mph in 1931, both in seaplanes). This marked the last time in history that an aircraft built by a private individual set the world airspeed record. A year and a half later, on January 19, 1937, flying the same H-1 Racer fitted with longer wings, Hughes set a new transcontinental airspeed record by flying non-stop from Los Angeles to Newark in seven hours, 28 minutes, and 25 seconds (beating his own previous record of nine hours, 27 minutes). His average ground-speed over the flight was .

The H-1 Racer featured a number of design innovations: it had retractable landing gear (as Boeing Monomail had five years before), and all rivets and joints set flush into the body of the aircraft to reduce drag. The H-1 Racer is thought to have influenced the design of a number of World War II fighters such as the Mitsubishi A6M Zero, Focke-Wulf Fw 190, and F8F Bearcat, although that has never been reliably confirmed. In 1975 the H-1 Racer was donated to the Smithsonian.

====Hughes Aircraft====
In 1932 Hughes founded the Hughes Aircraft Company, a division of Hughes Tool Company, in a rented corner of a Lockheed Aircraft Corporation hangar in Burbank, California, to build the H-1 racer.

Shortly after founding the company, Hughes used the alias &quot;Charles Howard&quot; to accept a job as a baggage handler for American Airlines. He was soon promoted to co-pilot.
Hughes continued to work for American Airlines until his real identity was discovered.

During and after World War II Hughes turned his company into a major defense contractor. The Hughes Helicopters division started in 1947 when helicopter manufacturer Kellett sold their latest design to Hughes for production. Hughes Aircraft became a major U.S. aerospace- and defense contractor, manufacturing numerous technology-related products that included spacecraft vehicles, military aircraft, radar systems, electro-optical systems, the first working laser, aircraft computer systems, missile systems, ion-propulsion engines (for space travel), commercial satellites, and other electronics systems.

In 1948 Hughes created a new division of Hughes Aircraft: the Hughes Aerospace Group. The Hughes Space and Communications Group and the Hughes Space Systems Division were later spun off in 1948 to form their own divisions and ultimately became the Hughes Space and Communications Company in 1961. In 1953 Howard Hughes gave all his stock in the Hughes Aircraft Company to the newly formed Howard Hughes Medical Institute, thereby turning the aerospace and defense contractor into a tax-exempt charitable organization. The Howard Hughes Medical Institute sold Hughes Aircraft in 1985 to General Motors for $5.2 billion. In 1997 General Motors sold Hughes Aircraft to Raytheon and in 2000, sold Hughes Space &amp; Communications to Boeing. A combination of Boeing, GM, and Raytheon acquired the Hughes Research Laboratories, which focused on advanced developments in microelectronics, information &amp; systems sciences, materials, sensors, and photonics; their work-space spans from basic research to product delivery. It has particularly emphasized capabilities in high-performance integrated circuits, high-power lasers, antennas, networking, and smart materials.

====Round-the-world flight====
On July 14, 1938, Hughes set another record by completing a flight around the world in just 91 hours (three days, 19 hours, 17 minutes), beating the previous record of 186 hours (seven days, 18 hours, 49 minutes) set in 1933 by Wiley Post in a single-engine Lockheed Vega by almost four days. Hughes returned home ahead of photographs of his flight. Taking off from New York City, Hughes continued to Paris, Moscow, Omsk, Yakutsk, Fairbanks, and Minneapolis, then returning to New York City. For this flight he flew a Lockheed 14 Super Electra (NX18973, a twin-engine transport with a crew of four) fitted with the latest radio and navigational equipment. Harry Connor was the co-pilot, Thomas Thurlow the navigator, Richard Stoddart the engineer, and Ed Lund the mechanic. Hughes wanted the flight to be a triumph of U.S. aviation technology, illustrating that safe, long-distance air travel was possible. Albert Lodwick of Mystic, Iowa, provided organizational skills as the flight operations manager. While Hughes had previously been relatively obscure despite his wealth, better known for dating Katharine Hepburn, New York City now gave him a ticker-tape parade in the Canyon of Heroes. Hughes and his crew were awarded the 1938 Collier Trophy for flying around the world in record time. He was awarded the Harmon Trophy in 1936 and 1938 for the record-breaking global circumnavigation.

In 1938 the William P. Hobby Airport in Houston, Texas—known at the time as Houston Municipal Airport—was renamed after Hughes, but the name was changed back due to public outrage over naming the airport after a living person. Hughes also had a role in the financing of the Boeing 307 Stratoliner for TWA, and the design and financing of the Lockheed L-049 Constellation.

Other aviator awards include: the Bibesco Cup of the Fédération Aéronautique Internationale in 1938, the Octave Chanute Award in 1940, and a special Congressional Gold Medal in 1939 &quot;in recognition of the achievements of Howard Hughes in advancing the science of aviation and thus bringing great credit to his country throughout the world&quot;.

President Harry S. Truman sent the Congressional medal to Hughes after the F-11 crash. After his around-the-world flight, Hughes had declined to go to the White House to collect it.

====Hughes D-2====

Development of the D-2 began around 1937, but little is known about its early gestation because Hughes&#x27; archives on the aircraft have not been made public. Aircraft historian René Francillon speculates that Hughes designed the aircraft for another circumnavigation record attempt, but the outbreak of World War II closed much of the world&#x27;s airspace and made it difficult to buy aircraft parts without government approval, so he decided to sell the aircraft to the U.S. Army instead. In December 1939, Hughes proposed that the United States Army Air Corps (USAAC) procure it as a &quot;pursuit type airplane&quot; (i.e. a fighter aircraft). It emerged as a two or three-seat twin-boom aircraft powered by two Pratt &amp; Whitney R-2800-49 engines and constructed mostly of Duramold, a type of molded plywood. The United States Army Air Forces (USAAF, successor to the USAAC) struggled to define a mission for the D-2, which lacked both the maneuverability of a fighter and the payload of a bomber, and was highly skeptical of the extensive use of plywood; however, the project was kept alive by high-level intervention from General Henry H. Arnold. The prototype was brought to Harper&#x27;s Dry Lake in California in great secrecy in 1943 and first flew on June 20 of that year. The initial test flights revealed serious flight control problems, so the D-2 returned to the hangar for extensive changes to its wings, and Hughes proposed to redesignate it as the D-5. However, in November 1944, the still-incomplete D-2 was destroyed in a hangar fire reportedly caused by a lightning strike.

====Fatal crash of the Sikorsky S-43====
In the spring of 1943 Hughes spent nearly a month in Las Vegas, test-flying his Sikorsky S-43 amphibious aircraft, practicing touch-and-go landings on Lake Mead in preparation for flying the H-4 Hercules. The weather conditions at the lake during the day were ideal and he enjoyed Las Vegas at night. On May 17, 1943, Hughes flew the Sikorsky from California, carrying two Civil Aeronautics Authority (CAA) aviation inspectors, two of his employees, and actress Ava Gardner. Hughes dropped Gardner off in Las Vegas and proceeded to Lake Mead to conduct qualifying tests in the S-43. The test flight did not go well. The Sikorsky crashed into Lake Mead, killing CAA inspector Ceco Cline and Hughes&#x27; employee Richard Felt. Hughes suffered a severe gash on the top of his head when he hit the upper control panel and had to be rescued by one of the others on board. Hughes paid divers $100,000 to raise the aircraft and later spent more than $500,000 restoring it. Hughes sent the plane to Houston, where it remained for many years.

====Hughes XF-11====

Acting on a recommendation of the president&#x27;s son, Colonel Elliott Roosevelt, who had become friends with Hughes, in September 1943 General Arnold issued a directive to order 100 of a reconnaissance development of the D-2, known as the F-11 (XF-11 in prototype form). The project was controversial from the beginning, as the USAAF Air Materiel Command deeply doubted that Hughes Aircraft could fulfill a contract this large, but Arnold pushed the project forward. Materiel Command demanded a host of major design changes notably including the elimination of Duramold; Hughes, who sought $3.9 million in reimbursement for sunk costs from the D-2, strenuously objected because this undercut his argument that the XF-11 was a modified D-2 rather than a new design. Protracted negotiations caused months of delays but ultimately yielded few design concessions. The war ended before the first XF-11 prototype was completed and the F-11 production contract was canceled. The XF-11 emerged in 1946 as an all-metal, twin-boom, three-seat reconnaissance aircraft, substantially larger than the D-2 and powered by two Pratt &amp; Whitney R-4360-31 engines, each driving a set of contra-rotating propellers. Only two prototypes were completed; the second one had a conventional single propeller per side.

=====Near-fatal crash of the XF-11=====

Hughes was almost killed on July 7, 1946, while performing the first flight of the XF-11 near Hughes Airfield at Culver City, California. Hughes extended the test flight well beyond the 45-minute limit decreed by the USAAF, possibly distracted by landing gear retraction problems. An oil leak caused one of the contra-rotating propellers to reverse pitch, causing the aircraft to yaw sharply and lose altitude rapidly. Hughes attempted to save the aircraft by landing it at the Los Angeles Country Club golf course, but just seconds before reaching the course, the XF-11 started to drop dramatically and crashed in the Beverly Hills neighborhood surrounding the country club.

When the XF-11 finally came to a halt after destroying three houses, the fuel tanks exploded, setting fire to the aircraft and a nearby home at 808 North Whittier Drive owned by Charles E. Meyer. Hughes managed to pull himself out of the flaming wreckage but lay beside the aircraft until he was rescued by U.S. Marine Corps Master Sergeant William L. Durkin, who happened to be in the area visiting friends. Hughes sustained significant injuries in the crash, including a crushed collar bone, multiple cracked ribs, crushed chest with collapsed left lung, shifting his heart to the right side of the chest cavity, and numerous third-degree burns. An oft-told story said that Hughes sent a check to the Marine weekly for the remainder of his life as a sign of gratitude. Noah Dietrich asserted that Hughes did send Durkin $200 a month, but Durkin&#x27;s daughter denied knowing that he received any money from Hughes.

Despite his physical injuries, Hughes took pride that his mind was still working. As he lay in his hospital bed, he decided that he did not like the bed&#x27;s design. He called in plant engineers to design a customized bed, equipped with hot and cold running water, built in six sections, and operated by 30 electric motors, with push-button adjustments. Hughes designed the hospital bed specifically to alleviate the pain caused by moving with severe burn injuries. He never used the bed that he designed. Hughes&#x27; doctors considered his recovery almost miraculous.

Many attribute his long-term dependence on opiates to his use of codeine as a painkiller during his convalescence. Yet Dietrich asserts that Hughes recovered the &quot;hard way—no sleeping pills, no opiates of any kind&quot;. The trademark mustache he wore afterward hid a scar on his upper lip resulting from the accident.

====H-4 Hercules====
The War Production Board, a civilian government agency that supervised war production from 1942 to 1945, originally contracted with Henry Kaiser and Hughes to produce the gigantic HK-1 Hercules flying boat for use during World War II to transport troops and equipment across the Atlantic as an alternative to seagoing troop transport ships that were vulnerable to German U-boats. The military services opposed the project, thinking it would siphon resources from higher-priority programs, but Hughes&#x27; powerful allies in Washington, D.C. advocated it. After disputes, Kaiser withdrew from the project and Hughes elected to continue it as the H-4 Hercules. However, the aircraft was not completed until after World War II.

The Hercules was the world&#x27;s largest flying boat, the largest aircraft made from wood, and, at , had the longest wingspan of any aircraft (the next-largest wingspan was about ). (The Hercules is no longer the longest nor heaviest aircraft ever built - surpassed by the Antonov An-225 &quot;Mriya&quot; produced in 1985.)

The Hercules flew only once for , and above the water, with Hughes at the controls, on November 2, 1947.

Critics nicknamed the Hercules the &quot;Spruce Goose&quot;, but it was actually made largely from birch (not spruce) rather than from aluminum, because the contract required that Hughes build the aircraft of &quot;non-strategic materials&quot;. It was built in Hughes&#x27; Westchester, California, facility. In 1947, Howard Hughes was summoned to testify before the Senate War Investigating Committee to explain why the H-4 development had been so troubled, and why $22 million had produced only two prototypes of the XF-11. General Elliott Roosevelt and numerous other USAAF officers were also called to testify in hearings that transfixed the nation during August and November 1947. In hotly-disputed testimony over TWA&#x27;s route awards and malfeasance in the defense-acquisition process, Hughes turned the tables on his main interlocutor, Maine senator Owen Brewster, and the hearings were widely interpreted as a Hughes victory. After being displayed at the harbor of Long Beach, California, the Hercules was moved to McMinnville, Oregon, where it features at the Evergreen Aviation &amp; Space Museum.

On November 4, 2017, the 70th anniversary of the only flight of the H-4 Hercules was celebrated at the Evergreen Aviation &amp; Space Museum with Hughes&#x27; paternal cousin Michael Wesley Summerlin and Brian Palmer Evans, son of Hughes radio technology pioneer Dave Evans, taking their positions in the recreation of a photo that was previously taken of Hughes, Dave Evans, and Joe Petrali on board the H-4 Hercules.

====Airlines====
In 1939, at the urging of Jack Frye, president of Transcontinental &amp; Western Airlines, the predecessor of Trans World Airlines (TWA), Hughes began to quietly purchase a majority share of TWA stock (78% of stock, to be exact); he took a controlling interest in the airline by 1944. Although he never had an official position with TWA, Hughes handpicked the board of directors, which included Noah Dietrich, and often issued orders directly to airline staff. Hughes Tool Co. purchased the first six Stratoliners Boeing manufactured. Hughes used one personally, and he let TWA operate the other five.

Hughes is commonly credited as the driving force behind the Lockheed Constellation airliner, which Hughes and Frye ordered in 1939 as a long-range replacement for TWA&#x27;s fleet of Boeing 307 Stratoliners. Hughes personally financed TWA&#x27;s acquisition of 40 Constellations for $18 million, the largest aircraft order in history up to that time. The Constellations were among the highest-performing commercial aircraft of the late 1940s and 1950s and allowed TWA to pioneer nonstop transcontinental service. During World War II Hughes leveraged political connections in Washington to obtain rights for TWA to serve Europe, making it the only U.S. carrier with a combination of domestic and transatlantic routes.

After the announcement of the Boeing 707, Hughes opted to pursue a more advanced jet aircraft for TWA and approached Convair in late 1954. Convair proposed two concepts to Hughes, but Hughes was unable to decide which concept to adopt, and Convair eventually abandoned its initial jet project after the mockups of the 707 and Douglas DC-8 were unveiled. Even after competitors such as United Airlines, American Airlines and Pan American World Airways had placed large orders for the 707, Hughes only placed eight orders for 707s through the Hughes Tool Company and forbade TWA from using the aircraft. After finally beginning to reserve 707 orders in 1956, Hughes embarked on a plan to build his own &quot;superior&quot; jet aircraft for TWA, applied for CAB permission to sell Hughes aircraft to TWA, and began negotiations with the state of Florida to build a manufacturing plant there. However, he abandoned this plan around 1958, and in the interim, negotiated new contracts for 707 and Convair 880 aircraft and engines totaling $400 million.

The financing of TWA&#x27;s jet orders precipitated the end of Hughes&#x27; relationship with Noah Dietrich, and ultimately Hughes&#x27; ouster from control of TWA. Hughes did not have enough cash on hand or future cash flow to pay for the orders and did not immediately seek bank financing. Hughes&#x27; refusal to heed Dietrich&#x27;s financing advice led to a major rift between the two by the end of 1956. Hughes believed that Dietrich wished to have Hughes committed as mentally incompetent, although the evidence of this is inconclusive. Dietrich resigned by telephone in May 1957 after repeated requests for stock options, which Hughes refused to grant, and with no further progress on the jet financing. As Hughes&#x27; mental state worsened, he ordered various tactics to delay payments to Boeing and Convair; his behavior led TWA&#x27;s banks to insist that he be removed from management as a condition for further financing.

In 1960, Hughes was ultimately forced out of the management of TWA, although he continued to own 78% of the company. In 1961, TWA filed suit against Hughes Tool Company, claiming that the latter had violated antitrust law by using TWA as a captive market for aircraft trading. The claim was largely dependent upon obtaining testimony from Hughes himself. Hughes went into hiding and refused to testify. A default judgment was issued against Hughes Tool Company for $135 million in 1963 but was overturned by the Supreme Court of the United States in 1973, on the basis that Hughes was immune from prosecution. In 1966, Hughes was forced to sell his TWA shares. The sale of his TWA shares brought Hughes $546,549,771.

Hughes acquired control of Boston-based Northeast Airlines in 1962. However, the airline&#x27;s lucrative route authority between major northeastern cities and Miami was terminated by a CAB decision around the time of the acquisition, and Hughes sold control of the company to a trustee in 1964. Northeast went on to merge with Delta Air Lines in 1972.

In 1970, Hughes acquired San Francisco-based Air West and renamed it Hughes Airwest. Air West had been formed in 1968 by the merger of Bonanza Air Lines, Pacific Air Lines, and West Coast Airlines, all of which operated in the western U.S. By the late 1970s, Hughes Airwest operated an all-jet fleet of Boeing 727-200, Douglas DC-9-10, and McDonnell Douglas DC-9-30 jetliners serving an extensive route network in the western U.S. with flights to Mexico and western Canada as well. By 1980, the airline&#x27;s route system reached as far east as Houston (Hobby Airport) and Milwaukee with a total of 42 destinations being served. Hughes Airwest was then acquired by and merged into Republic Airlines (1979–1986) in late 1980. Republic was subsequently acquired by and merged into Northwest Airlines which in turn was ultimately merged into Delta Air Lines in 2008.

=== Business with David Charnay ===

Hughes made numerous business partnerships through his friend, the industrialist and producer David Charnay, beginning with their work on the film &quot;The Conqueror (1956)&quot;. Though the film made money at the box office, its themes, dialogue, and casting were ridiculed. It was shot in St. George, Utah, which had been badly affected by the testing of more than 100 nuclear bombs. Many of the cast and crew were later diagnosed with cancer, leading it to be called an &quot;RKO Radioactive Picture&quot;. Hughes eventually bought every copy of the film he could, and is reported to have watched the film at home every night in the years before he died.

Charnay later bought Four Star, the film and television production company that produced &quot;The Conqueror.&quot;

Hughes and Charnay&#x27;s most published dealings were with a contested AirWest leveraged buyout. Charnay led the buyout group that involved Howard Hughes and their partners acquiring Air West. Hughes, Charnay, as well as three others, were indicted. The indictment, made by U.S. Attorney DeVoe Heaton, accused the group of conspiring to drive down the stock price of Air West in order to pressure company directors to sell to Hughes. The charges were dismissed after a judge had determined that the indictment had failed to allege an illegal action on the part of Hughes, Charnay, and all the other accused in the indictment. Thompson, the federal judge that made the decision to dismiss the charges, called the indictment one of the worst claims that he had ever seen. The charges were filed a second time by U.S. Attorney DeVoe Heaton&#x27;s assistant, Dean Vernon. The Federal Judge ruled on November 13, 1974, and elaborated to say that the case suggested a &quot;reprehensible misuse of the power of great wealth,&quot; but in his judicial opinion, &quot;no crime had been committed.&quot; The aftermath of the Air West deal was later settled with the SEC by paying former stockholders for alleged losses from the sale of their investment in Air West stock. As noted above, Air West was subsequently renamed Hughes Airwest. During a long pause between the years of the dismissed charges against Hughes, Charnay, and their partners, Howard Hughes died mid-flight while on the way to Houston from Acapulco. No further attempts were made to file any indictments after Hughes died.

==Howard Hughes Medical Institute==
In 1953, Hughes launched the Howard Hughes Medical Institute in Miami (currently located in Chevy Chase, Maryland near Washington, D.C.), with the express goal of basic biomedical research, including trying to understand, in Hughes&#x27; words, the &quot;genesis of life itself,&quot; due to his lifelong interest in science and technology. Hughes&#x27; first will, which he signed in 1925 at the age of 19, stipulated that a portion of his estate should be used to create a medical institute bearing his name. When a major battle with the IRS loomed ahead, Hughes gave all his stock in the Hughes Aircraft Company to the institute, thereby turning the aerospace and defense contractor into a for-profit entity of a fully tax-exempt charity. Hughes&#x27; internist, Verne Mason, who treated Hughes after his 1946 aircraft crash, was chairman of the institute&#x27;s medical advisory committee. The Howard Hughes Medical Institute&#x27;s new board of trustees sold Hughes Aircraft in 1985 to General Motors for $5.2 billion, allowing the institute to grow dramatically.

In 1954, Hughes transferred Hughes Aircraft to the foundation, which paid Hughes Tool Co. $18,000,000 for the assets. The foundation leased the land from Hughes Tool Co., which then subleased it to Hughes Aircraft Corp. The difference in rent, $2,000,000 per year, became the foundation&#x27;s working capital.

The deal was the topic of a protracted legal battle between Hughes and the Internal Revenue Service, which Hughes ultimately won. After his death in 1976, many thought that the balance of Hughes&#x27; estate would go to the institute, although it was ultimately divided among his cousins and other heirs, given the lack of a will to the contrary. The HHMI was the fourth largest private organization and one of the largest devoted to biological and medical research, with an endowment of $20.4 billion .

==&quot;Glomar Explorer&quot; and the taking of &quot;K-129&quot;==
In 1972, during the Cold War era, Hughes was approached by the CIA through his longtime partner, David Charnay, to help secretly recover the Soviet submarine &quot;K-129&quot;, which had sunk near Hawaii four years earlier. Hughes&#x27; involvement provided the CIA with a plausible cover story, conducting expensive civilian marine research at extreme depths and the mining of undersea manganese nodules. The recovery plan used the special-purpose salvage vessel &quot;Glomar Explorer&quot;. In the summer of 1974, &quot;Glomar Explorer&quot; attempted to raise the Soviet vessel. However, during the recovery, a mechanical failure in the ship&#x27;s grapple caused half of the submarine to break off and fall to the ocean floor. This section is believed to have held many of the most sought-after items, including its code book and nuclear missiles. Two nuclear-tipped torpedoes and some cryptographic machines were recovered, along with the bodies of six Soviet submariners who were subsequently given formal burial at sea in a filmed ceremony. The operation, known as Project Azorian (but incorrectly referred to by the press as Project Jennifer), became public in February 1975 after secret documents, obtained by burglars of Hughes&#x27; headquarters in June 1974, were released. Although he lent his name and his company&#x27;s resources to the operation, Hughes and his companies had no operational involvement in the project. The &quot;Glomar Explorer&quot; was eventually acquired by Transocean, and was sent to the scrap yard in 2015 during a large decline in oil prices.

==Personal life==
=== Early romances ===

Hughes dated many famous women, including Joan Crawford, Terry Moore, Debra Paget, Billie Dove, Faith Domergue, Bette Davis, Yvonne De Carlo, Ava Gardner, Olivia de Havilland, Katharine Hepburn, Hedy Lamarr, Ginger Rogers, Pat Sheehan, Gloria Vanderbilt, Mamie Van Doren and Gene Tierney.

He also proposed to Joan Fontaine several times, according to her autobiography &quot;No Bed of Roses&quot;. Jean Harlow accompanied him to the premiere of &quot;Hell&#x27;s Angels&quot;, but Noah Dietrich wrote many years later that the relationship was strictly professional, as Hughes disliked Harlow personally. In his 1971 book, &quot;Howard: The Amazing Mr. Hughes&quot;, Dietrich said that Hughes genuinely liked and respected Jane Russell, but never sought romantic involvement with her. According to Russell&#x27;s autobiography, however, Hughes once tried to bed her after a party. Russell (who was married at the time) refused him, and Hughes promised it would never happen again. The two maintained a professional and private friendship for many years. Hughes remained good friends with Tierney who, after his failed attempts to seduce her, was quoted as saying &quot;I don&#x27;t think Howard could love anything that did not have a motor in it&quot;. Later, when Tierney&#x27;s daughter Daria was born deaf and blind and with a severe learning disability because of Tierney&#x27;s exposure to rubella during her pregnancy, Hughes saw to it that Daria received the best medical care and paid all expenses.

=== Luxury yacht ===

In 1933, Hughes made a purchase of a luxury steam yacht named the &quot;Rover&quot;, which was previously owned by Scottish shipping magnate James Mackay, 1st Earl of Inchcape. Hughes stated that &quot;I have never seen the &quot;Rover&quot; but bought it on the blueprints, photographs and the reports of Lloyd&#x27;s surveyors. My experience is that the English are the most honest race in the world.&quot; Hughes renamed the yacht &quot;Southern Cross&quot; and later sold her to Swedish entrepreneur Axel Wenner-Gren.

=== 1936 automobile accident ===

On July 11, 1936, Hughes struck and killed a pedestrian named Gabriel S. Meyer with his car at the corner of 3rd Street and Lorraine in Los Angeles. After the crash, Hughes was taken to the hospital and certified as sober, but an attending doctor made a note that Hughes had been drinking. A witness to the crash told police that Hughes was driving erratically and too fast and that Meyer had been standing in the safety zone of a streetcar stop. Hughes was booked on suspicion of negligent homicide and held overnight in jail until his attorney, Neil S. McCarthy, obtained a writ of &quot;habeas corpus&quot; for his release pending a coroner&#x27;s inquest. By the time of the coroner&#x27;s inquiry, however, the witness had changed his story and claimed that Meyer had moved directly in front of Hughes&#x27; car. Nancy Bayly (Watts), who was in the car with Hughes at the time of the crash, corroborated this version of the story. On July 16, 1936, Hughes was held blameless by a coroner&#x27;s jury at the inquest into Meyer&#x27;s death. Hughes told reporters outside the inquiry, &quot;I was driving slowly and a man stepped out of the darkness in front of me&quot;.

===Marriage to Jean Peters===
On January 12, 1957, Hughes married actress Jean Peters at a small hotel in Tonopah, Nevada. The couple met in the 1940s, before Peters became a film actress. They had a highly publicized romance in 1947 and there was talk of marriage, but she said she could not combine it with her career. Some later claimed that Peters was &quot;the only woman [Hughes] ever loved&quot;, and he reportedly had his security officers follow her everywhere even when they were not in a relationship. Such reports were confirmed by actor Max Showalter, who became a close friend of Peters while shooting &quot;Niagara&quot; (1953). Showalter told an interviewer that because he frequently met with Peters, Hughes&#x27; men threatened to ruin his career if he did not leave her alone.

=== Connections to Richard Nixon and Watergate ===

Shortly before the 1960 Presidential election, Richard Nixon was alarmed when it was revealed that his brother, Donald, had received a $205,000 loan from Hughes. It has long been speculated that Nixon&#x27;s drive to learn what the Democrats were planning in 1972 was based in part on his belief that the Democrats knew about a later bribe that his friend Bebe Rebozo had received from Hughes after Nixon took office.

In late 1971, Donald Nixon was collecting intelligence for his brother in preparation for the upcoming presidential election. One of his sources was John H. Meier, a former business adviser of Hughes who had also worked with Democratic National Committee Chairman Larry O&#x27;Brien.

Meier, in collaboration with former Vice President Hubert Humphrey and others, wanted to feed misinformation to the Nixon campaign. Meier told Donald that he was sure the Democrats would win the election because Larry O&#x27;Brien had a great deal of information on Richard Nixon&#x27;s illicit dealings with Howard Hughes that had never been released; O&#x27;Brien did not actually have any such information, but Meier wanted Nixon to think that he did. Donald told his brother that O&#x27;Brien was in possession of damaging information that could destroy his campaign. Terry Lenzner, who was the chief investigator for the Senate Watergate Committee, speculates that it was Nixon&#x27;s desire to know what O&#x27;Brien knew about Nixon&#x27;s dealings with Hughes that may have partially motivated the Watergate break-in.

==Last years==
===Physical and mental decline===
Hughes was widely considered eccentric and suffered from severe obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).

Dietrich wrote that Hughes ate the same dinner daily: a New York strip steak cooked medium rare, dinner salad, and peas; but only the smaller peas, pushing the larger ones aside. For breakfast, his eggs had to be cooked the way Lily, his family cook, made them. Hughes had a &quot;phobia about germs&quot;, and &quot;his passion for secrecy became a mania.&quot;

While directing &quot;The Outlaw&quot;, Hughes became fixated on a small flaw in one of Jane Russell&#x27;s blouses, claiming that the fabric bunched up along a seam and gave the appearance of two nipples on each breast. He wrote a detailed memorandum to the crew on how to fix the problem. Richard Fleischer, who directed &quot;His Kind of Woman&quot; with Hughes as executive producer, wrote at length in his autobiography about the difficulty of dealing with the tycoon. In his book &quot;Just Tell Me When to Cry&quot;, Fleischer explained that Hughes was fixated on trivial details and was alternately indecisive and obstinate. He also revealed that Hughes&#x27; unpredictable mood swings made him wonder if the film would ever be completed.

In 1947, Hughes told his aides that he wanted to screen some movies at a film studio near his home. He stayed in the studio&#x27;s darkened screening room for more than four months, never leaving. He ate only chocolate bars and chicken and drank only milk and was surrounded by dozens of boxes of Kleenex that he continuously stacked and re-arranged. He wrote detailed memos to his aides giving them explicit instructions neither to look at him nor speak to him unless spoken to. Throughout this period, Hughes sat fixated in his chair, often naked, continuously watching movies. When he finally emerged in the spring of 1948, his hygiene was terrible. He had neither bathed nor cut his hair and nails for weeks; this may have been due to allodynia, which results in a pain response to stimuli that would normally not cause pain.

After the screening room incident, Hughes moved into a bungalow at the Beverly Hills Hotel where he also rented rooms for his aides, his wife, and numerous girlfriends. He would sit naked in his bedroom with a pink hotel napkin placed over his genitals, watching movies. This may have been because Hughes found the touch of clothing painful due to allodynia. He may have watched movies to distract himself from his pain—a common practice among patients with intractable pain, especially those who do not receive adequate treatment. In one year, he spent an estimated $11 million at the hotel.

Hughes began purchasing restaurant chains and four-star hotels that had been founded within the state of Texas. This included, if for only a short period, many unknown franchises currently out of business. He placed ownership of the restaurants with the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, and all licenses were resold shortly after.

He became obsessed with the 1968 film &quot;Ice Station Zebra&quot;, and had it run on a continuous loop in his home. According to his aides, he watched it 150 times. Feeling guilty about the failure of his film &quot;The Conqueror&quot;, a commercial and critical flop, he bought every copy of the film for $12 million, watching the film on repeat. Paramount Pictures acquired the rights of the film in 1979, three years after his death.

Hughes insisted on using tissues to pick up objects to insulate himself from germs. He would also notice dust, stains, or other imperfections on people&#x27;s clothes and demand that they take care of them. Once one of the most visible men in America, Hughes ultimately vanished from public view, although tabloids continued to follow rumors of his behavior and whereabouts. He was reported to be terminally ill, mentally unstable, or even dead.

Injuries from numerous aircraft crashes caused Hughes to spend much of his later life in pain, and he eventually became addicted to codeine, which he injected intramuscularly. He had his hair cut and nails trimmed only once a year, likely due to the pain caused by the RSD/CRPS, which was caused by the plane crashes. He also stored his urine in bottles.

=== Later years in Las Vegas ===

The wealthy and aging Hughes, accompanied by his entourage of personal aides, began moving from one hotel to another, always taking up residence in the top floor penthouse. In the last ten years of his life, 1966 to 1976, Hughes lived in hotels in many cities—including Beverly Hills, Boston, Las Vegas, Nassau, Freeport and Vancouver.

On November 24, 1966 (Thanksgiving Day), Hughes arrived in Las Vegas by railroad car and moved into the Desert Inn. Because he refused to leave the hotel and to avoid further conflicts with the owners, Hughes bought the Desert Inn in early 1967. The hotel&#x27;s eighth floor became the center of Hughes&#x27; empire, and the ninth-floor penthouse became his personal residence. Between 1966 and 1968, he bought several other hotel-casinos, including the Castaways, New Frontier, the Landmark Hotel and Casino, and the Sands. Hughes was rumored to have bought the Silver Slipper casino to move its trademark neon silver slipper which was visible from his bedroom, but this is not credible. After Hughes left the Desert Inn, hotel employees discovered that his drapes had not been opened during the time he lived there and had rotted through.

Hughes wanted to change the image of Las Vegas to something more glamorous. He wrote in a memo to an aide, &quot;I like to think of Las Vegas in terms of a well-dressed man in a dinner jacket and a beautifully jeweled and furred female getting out of an expensive car.&quot; Hughes bought several local television stations (including KLAS-TV).

Eventually, the brain trauma from Hughes&#x27; previous accidents, the effects of neurosyphilis diagnosed in 1932 and undiagnosed obsessive-compulsive disorder considerably affected his decision-making. A small panel, unofficially dubbed the &quot;Mormon Mafia&quot; for the many Latter-day Saints on the committee, was led by Frank William Gay and originally served as Hughes&#x27; &quot;secret police&quot; headquartered at 7000 Romaine, Hollywood. Over the next two decades, however, this group oversaw and controlled considerable business holdings, with the CIA anointing Gay while awarding a contract to the Hughes corporation to acquire sensitive information on a sunken Russian submarine. In addition to supervising day-to-day business operations and Hughes&#x27; health, they also went to great pains to satisfy Hughes&#x27; every whim. For example, Hughes once became fond of Baskin-Robbins&#x27;s banana nut ice cream, so his aides sought to secure a bulk shipment for him, only to discover that Baskin-Robbins had discontinued the flavor. They put in a request for the smallest amount the company could provide for a special order, 350 gallons (1,300 L), and had it shipped from Los Angeles. A few days after the order arrived, Hughes announced he was tired of banana nut and wanted only French vanilla ice cream. The Desert Inn ended up distributing free banana nut ice cream to casino customers for a year. In a 1996 interview, former Howard Hughes Chief of Nevada Operations Robert Maheu said, &quot;There is a rumor that there is still some banana nut ice cream left in the freezer. It is most likely true.&quot;

As an owner of several major Las Vegas businesses, Hughes wielded much political and economic influence in Nevada and elsewhere. During the 1960s and early 1970s, he disapproved of underground nuclear testing at the Nevada Test Site. Hughes was concerned about the risk from residual nuclear radiation and attempted to halt the tests. When the tests finally went through despite Hughes&#x27; efforts, the detonations were powerful enough that the entire hotel in which he was living trembled from the shock waves. In two separate, last-ditch maneuvers, Hughes instructed his representatives to offer bribes of $1 million to both Presidents Lyndon B. Johnson and Richard Nixon.

In 1970, Jean Peters filed for divorce. The two had not lived together for many years. Peters requested a lifetime alimony payment of $70,000 a year, adjusted for inflation, and waived all claims to Hughes&#x27; estate. Hughes offered her a settlement of over a million dollars, but she declined it. Hughes did not insist on a confidentiality agreement from Peters as a condition of the divorce. Aides reported that Hughes never spoke ill of her. She refused to discuss her life with Hughes and declined several lucrative offers from publishers and biographers. Peters would state only that she had not seen Hughes for several years before their divorce and had dealt with him only by phone.

Hughes was living in the Intercontinental Hotel near Lake Managua in Nicaragua, seeking privacy and security, when a magnitude 6.5 earthquake damaged Managua in December 1972. As a precaution, Hughes moved to a large tent facing the hotel; after a few days, he moved to the Nicaraguan National Palace and stayed there as a guest of Anastasio Somoza Debayle before leaving for Florida on a private jet the following day. He subsequently moved into the penthouse at the Xanadu Princess Resort on Grand Bahama Island, which he had recently purchased. He lived almost exclusively in the penthouse of the Xanadu Beach Resort &amp; Marina for the last four years of his life. Hughes spent a total of $300 million on his many properties in Las Vegas.

====Autobiography hoax====
In 1972, author Clifford Irving caused a media sensation when he claimed he had co-written an authorized Hughes autobiography. Irving claimed he and Hughes had corresponded through the United States mail and offered as proof handwritten notes allegedly sent by Hughes. Publisher McGraw-Hill, Inc. was duped into believing the manuscript was authentic. Hughes was so reclusive that he did not immediately publicly refute Irving&#x27;s statement, leading many to believe that Irving&#x27;s book was genuine. However, before the book&#x27;s publication, Hughes finally denounced Irving in a teleconference attended by reporters Hughes knew personally: James Bacon of the Hearst papers, Marvin Miles of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, Vernon Scott of UPI, Roy Neal of NBC News, Gene Handsaker of AP, Wayne Thomas of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, and Gladwin Hill of the &quot;New York Times&quot;.

The entire hoax finally unraveled. The United States Postal Inspection Service (USPIS) got a subpoena to force Irving to turn over samples of his handwriting. The USPIS investigation led to Irving&#x27;s indictment and subsequent conviction for using the postal service to commit fraud. He was incarcerated for 17 months. In 1974, the Orson Welles film &quot;F for Fake&quot; included a section on the Hughes autobiography hoax, leaving a question open as to whether it was actually Hughes who took part in the teleconference (since so few people had actually heard or seen him in recent years). In 1977, &quot;The Hoax&quot; by Clifford Irving was published in the United Kingdom, telling his story of these events. The 2006 film &quot;The Hoax&quot;, starring Richard Gere, is also based on these events.

===Death===
Hughes is reported to have died on April 5, 1976, at 1:27 p.m. on board an aircraft, Learjet 24B N855W, owned by Robert Graf and piloted by Roger Sutton and Jeff Abrams. He was en route from his penthouse at the Acapulco Princess Hotel (now the Princess Mundo Imperial) in Mexico to the Methodist Hospital in Houston.

His reclusiveness and possibly his drug use made him practically unrecognizable. His hair, beard, fingernails, and toenails were long—his tall frame now weighed barely , and the FBI had to use fingerprints to conclusively identify the body. Howard Hughes&#x27; alias, John T. Conover, was used when his body arrived at a morgue in Houston on the day of his death.

An autopsy recorded kidney failure as the cause of death. In an eighteen-month study investigating Hughes&#x27; drug abuse for the estate, it was found that &quot;someone administered a deadly injection of the painkiller to this comatose man ... obviously needlessly and almost certainly fatal&quot;. He suffered from malnutrition and was covered in bedsores. While his kidneys were damaged, his other internal organs, including his brain, which had no visible damage or illnesses, were deemed perfectly healthy. X-rays revealed five broken-off hypodermic needles in the flesh of his arms. To inject codeine into his muscles, Hughes had used glass syringes with metal needles that easily became detached.

Hughes is buried next to his parents at Glenwood Cemetery in Houston.

====Alleged survival====
Following his death, Hughes was subject to several widely rebuked conspiracy theories that he had faked his own death. A notable allegation came from retired Major General Mark Musick, Assistant Secretary of the Air Force, who claimed Hughes went on to live under an assumed identity, dying on November 15, 2001, in Troy, Alabama.

===Estate===
Approximately three weeks after Hughes&#x27; death, a handwritten will was found on the desk of an official of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Salt Lake City, Utah. The so-called &quot;Mormon Will&quot; gave $1.56 billion to various charitable organizations (including $625 million to the Howard Hughes Medical Institute), nearly $470 million to the upper management in Hughes&#x27; companies and to his aides, $156 million to first cousin William Lummis, and $156 million split equally between his two ex-wives Ella Rice and Jean Peters.

A further $156 million was endowed to a gas station owner, Melvin Dummar, who told reporters that in 1967, he found a disheveled and dirty man lying along U.S. Route 95, just north of Las Vegas. The man asked for a ride to Vegas. Dropping him off at the Sands Hotel, Dummar said the man told him that he was Hughes. Dummar later claimed that days after Hughes&#x27; death a &quot;mysterious man&quot; appeared at his gas station, leaving an envelope containing the will on his desk. Unsure if the will was genuine and unsure of what to do, Dummar left the will at the LDS Church office. In 1978, a Nevada court ruled the Mormon Will a forgery and officially declared that Hughes had died intestate (without a valid will). Dummar&#x27;s story was later adapted into Jonathan Demme&#x27;s film &quot;Melvin and Howard&quot; in 1980.

Hughes&#x27; $2.5 billion estate was eventually split in 1983 among 22 cousins, including William Lummis, who serves as a trustee of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute. The Supreme Court of the United States ruled that Hughes Aircraft was owned by the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, which sold it to General Motors in 1985 for $5.2 billion. The court rejected suits by the states of California and Texas that claimed they were owed inheritance tax.

In 1984, Hughes&#x27; estate paid an undisclosed amount to Terry Moore, who claimed she and Hughes had secretly married on a yacht in international waters off Mexico in 1949 and never divorced. Moore never produced proof of a marriage, but her book, &quot;The Beauty and the Billionaire,&quot; became a bestseller.

==In popular culture==
===Film===
* In &quot;The Carpetbaggers&quot; (1964), the main character Jonas Cord (played by George Peppard) is loosely based on Howard Hughes.
* The James Bond film &quot;Diamonds Are Forever&quot; (1971) features a tall, Texan, reclusive billionaire character named Willard Whyte (played by Jimmy Dean) who operates his business empire from the penthouse of a Las Vegas hotel. Although he appears only late in the film, his habitual seclusion and his control of a major aerospace contracting firm are key elements of the film&#x27;s plot. Several sequences were actually filmed on location at The Landmark Hotel and Casino, which was owned by Hughes at the time.
* &quot;The Amazing Howard Hughes&quot; is a 1977 American made-for-television biographical film which aired as a mini-series on the CBS network, made a year after Hughes&#x27; death and based on Noah Dietrich&#x27;s book &quot;Howard: The Amazing Mr. Hughes&quot;. Tommy Lee Jones plays Hughes.
* &quot;Melvin and Howard&quot; (1980), directed by Jonathan Demme and starring Jason Robards as Howard Hughes and Paul Le Mat as Melvin Dummar. The film won Academy Awards for Best Original Screenplay (Bo Goldman) and Best Supporting Actress (Mary Steenburgen). The film focuses on Melvin Dummar&#x27;s claims of meeting Hughes in the Nevada desert and subsequent estate battles over his inclusion in Hughes&#x27; will. Critic Pauline Kael called the film &quot;an almost flawless act of sympathetic imagination&quot;.
*The film &quot;Creepshow&quot; from 1982 has a segment titled &quot;They&#x27;re Creeping Up on You!&quot;. The reclusive, paranoid, tycoon Upson Pratt, played by E. G. Marshall appears to be loosely based upon Hughes. 
*In &quot;&quot;, (1988), Hughes (played by Dean Stockwell) figures in the plot by telling Preston Tucker to source steel and engines for Tucker&#x27;s automobiles from a helicopter manufacturer in New York. Scene occurs in a hangar with the Hercules. 
* In &quot;The Rocketeer&quot;, a 1991 American period superhero film from Walt Disney Pictures, the title character attracts the attention of Howard Hughes (played by Terry O&#x27;Quinn) and the FBI, who are hunting for a missing jet pack, as well as Nazi operatives. 
* &quot;Howard Hughes Documentary&quot;, broadcast in 1992 as an episode of the &quot;Time Machine&quot; documentary series, was introduced by Peter Graves, later released by A&amp;E Home Video.
* In &quot;Conspiracy Theory&quot; (1997), the character Jerry Fletcher (played by Mel Gibson) mentions one of his theories to a street vendor by saying, &quot;Did you know that the whole Vietnam War was fought over a bet that Howard Hughes lost to Aristotle Onassis?&quot; referring to his (Fletcher&#x27;s) thoughts on the politics of that conflict.
* In &quot;The Aviator&quot; (2004), directed by Martin Scorsese, Hughes is portrayed by Leonardo DiCaprio. The film focuses on Hughes&#x27; personal life from the making of &quot;Hell&#x27;s Angels&quot; through his successful flight of the Hercules or &quot;Spruce Goose&quot;. Critically acclaimed, it was nominated for 11 Academy Awards, winning five for Best Cinematography; Best Film Editing; Best Costume Design; Best Art Direction; and Best Actress in a Supporting Role for Cate Blanchett. 
* &quot;Howard Hughes: The Real Aviator&quot; documentary was broadcast in 2004 and went on to win the Grand Festival Award for Best Documentary at the 2004 Berkeley Video &amp; Film Festival.

* &quot;Captain America: The First Avenger&quot; (2011), the character Howard Stark (played by Dominic Cooper), a wealthy inventor of futuristic technology, clearly embodying Hughes&#x27; persona and enthusiasm. His subsequent appearances in the TV series &quot;Agent Carter&quot; further this persona, as well as depicting him as sharing the real Hughes&#x27; reputation as a womanizer. Stan Lee has noted that Howard&#x27;s son Tony Stark (Iron Man), who shared several of these traits himself, was based on Hughes.
* &quot;Rules Don&#x27;t Apply&quot; (2016), written and directed by Warren Beatty, features Beatty as Hughes from 1958 through 1964.
* In the &quot;Dark Knight Trilogy&quot;, director Christopher Nolan&#x27;s characterization of Bruce Wayne is heavily inspired by Hughes&#x27; perceived lifestyle – from a playboy in &quot;Batman Begins&quot; to a recluse in &quot;The Dark Knight Rises&quot;. Nolan is reported to have integrated his original material intended for a shelved Hughes biopic into the trilogy.
* In &quot;The Hoax&quot; (2006) - in what would cause a fantastic media frenzy - Clifford Irving sells his bogus biography of Howard Hughes to a premiere publishing house in the early 1970s.

Years later, when Ryan&#x27;s vision for Rapture falls into dystopia, he hides himself away and uses armies of mutated humans, &quot;Splicers&quot;, to defend himself and fight against those trying to take over his city, including the player-character.
* In &quot;L.A. Noire&quot;, Hughes makes an appearance presenting his Hercules H-4 aircraft in the game opening scene. The H-4 is later a central plot piece of DLC Arson Case, &quot;Nicholson Electroplating&quot;.
* In &quot;&quot;, the character of Robert Edwin House, a wealthy business magnate and entrepreneur who owns the New Vegas strip, is based on Howard Hughes and closely resembles him in appearance, personality and background. A portrait of Mr. House can also be found in the game which strongly resembles a portrait of Howard Hughes standing in front of a Boeing Army Pursuit Plane.

===Literature===
* Stan Lee repeatedly stated he created the Marvel Comics character Iron Man&#x27;s civilian persona, Tony Stark, drawing inspiration from Howard Hughes&#x27; colorful lifestyle and personality. Additionally, the first name of Stark&#x27;s father is Howard.
* Hughes is a supporting character in all three parts of James Ellroy&#x27;s Underworld USA Trilogy, employing several of the protagonists as private investigators, bagmen, and consultants in his attempt to assume control of Las Vegas. Referred to behind his back as &quot;Count Dracula&quot; (due to his reclusiveness and rumored obsession with blood transfusions from Mormon donors), Hughes is portrayed as a spoiled, racist, opioid-addicted whose grandiose plans for Las Vegas are undermined by the manipulations of the Chicago Outfit.
* In the 1981 novel &quot;Dream Park&quot; by Larry Niven and Steven Barnes, the weapon &quot;which might have defeated the Japs if it hadn&#x27;t come so late&quot; is revealed to be the Spruce Goose, which had been magically hijacked on its test flight by evil Foré sorcerers in New Guinea. Hughes&#x27; skeleton is found at the controls, identified by Hughes&#x27; trademark fedora and cloth-and-leather jacket.

Oh, yea... Get your fuckin&#x27; jumbo jet off my airport&quot;

<doc id="14062" wikidata="Q990130" url="?curid=14062" title="Hook of Holland">
<text>Hook of Holland (, ) is a coastal village in the southwestern corner of Holland, hence the name; &quot;hoek&quot; means &quot;corner&quot; and was in use before the word &quot;&quot; – &quot;cape&quot;. The English translation using Hook is a false cognate of the Dutch Hoek, but has become commonplace (in official government records in English, the name tends not to get translated and Hoek van Holland is used). It is located at the mouth of the New Waterway shipping canal into the North Sea. The village is administered as a district of the municipality of Rotterdam. Its district covers an area of 18.53 km2, of which 14.19 km2 is land. On 1 January 2023 it had an estimated population of 10,560.

Settlements near &quot;the Hook&quot; () include the small towns Monster, Naaldwijk and &#x27;s-Gravenzande and the city Delft to the northeast, and the town Maassluis to the southeast. On the other side of the river is the harbor Europort and the Maasvlakte. The wide sandy beach, one section of which is designated for use by naturists, runs for approximately 18 kilometres to Scheveningen and for most of this distance is backed by extensive sand dunes through which there are foot and cycle paths. On the north side of the New Waterway, to the west of the village, is a pier, part of which is accessible to pedestrians and cyclists.

The Berghaven is a small harbour on the New Waterway where the Rotterdam and Europoort pilots are based. This small harbour is only for the use of the pilot service, government vessels and the Hook of Holland lifeboat.

== History ==

The Hook of Holland area was created as a sandbar in the Maas estuary, when it became more and more silted after St. Elizabeth&#x27;s flood of 1421. All kinds of plans were designed to improve the shipping channel to Rotterdam. In 1863 it was finally decided to construct the New Waterway which was dug between 1866 and 1868. The route ran through the Hook of Holland, where a primitive settlement, Old Hook (Oude Hoek - nowadays the Zuidelijk Strandcentrum), was created. Many workers and senior employees of the Rijkswaterstaat settled in Old Hook.

The Hook initially fell under the administrative authority of &#x27;s-Gravenzande. An attempt by the inhabitants to transform the place into an independent municipality failed and, on 1 January 1914, Hook of Holland was added to Rotterdam. After the First World War the village started to develop into a seaside resort. It has since been informally known as &#x27;Rotterdam by the sea&#x27;.

During World War II, the Hook was one of the most important places for the Wehrmacht to hold because of its harbour, which comprised an important and strategic part of the Atlantic Wall. The German Army installed three 11&quot; guns (removed from the damaged battleship Gneisenau) as shore batteries to protect the port area from invasion.

Hook of Holland already had a ward council in 1947 and has been a borough since 1973. In 2014, it was replaced by an &quot;area committee&quot;.
==Kindertransport monument==
The &quot;kindertransport&quot;, with which Jewish children from Germany, Austria, Poland and Czechoslovakia could be brought to England from December 1938 until the outbreak of the World War II, usually went from the children&#x27;s home stations to the Netherlands by train. The crossing to Harwich then largely took place from Hook of Holland. The transports were supported by the Dutch government and by volunteers. The first transport, which started on December 1, 1938, at the Berlin Anhalter Bahnhof, reached England on December 2, 1938. When the transport was allowed, the British government stipulated that the children could not be older than seventeen and that their parents could not come along. The Nazis stipulated, among other things, that the children at the railway station were not allowed to say goodbye to those left behind. By the time the war broke out in 1939, approximately 10,000 children had been brought to Britain in this way.
==Transport links==

===Railways===
The Schiedam–Hoek van Holland railway was a 24-kilometre train service branch line from Schiedam Centrum station via Vlaardingen and Maassluis. The final two stations on the line were located within the village. Hoek van Holland Haven, the penultimate station, was close to the village centre, adjacent to the ferry terminal and the small harbour, the Berghaven. Hoek van Holland Strand, the terminus, is closest to the beach. The railway line opened for service in 1893 and was electrified in 1935. International trains ran from Berlin and Moscow to connected these with London via the ferry service. From 1928 to 1939 and from 1962 to 1979, Hook of Holland was the northern terminus of the Rheingold Express to Frankfurt and Geneva. Services on the line to Rotterdam Centraal station were operated by NS every half-hour during the day until April 2017, when the line was closed.

It was then converted to a metro/lightrail system. It was reopened in September 2019, as an extension of the Rotterdam Metro / lightrail. The metro/lightrail service from Hook of Holland terminates at the beach, stops at the redeveloped Hoek van Holland Haven metro station where it connects to the Stena Line ferry to Harwich. It connects to Dutch trains services at Schiedam Centrum station, Rotterdam Blaak station and Rotterdam Alexander station and after changing to other metro lines at Beurs metro station to Rotterdam Centraal.

===Ferry===
Hook of Holland is also the location of an international ferry terminal, from which service to eastern England has operated since 1893 except for the durations of the two World Wars. Currently, two routes are operated: one, a day-and-night freight and passenger service to Harwich, Essex, and the other, a night, freight-only service to North Killingholme Haven, Lincolnshire. The passenger ferry service is operated by Stena Line as part of the Dutchflyer rail-ferry service between Hook van Holland Haven station and Harwich International station in England, from which Greater Anglia provides service to Liverpool Street station in central London.

A local ferry operated by RET links the Hook with the Maasvlakte part of the Port of Rotterdam.

===Motorways===
The A20 motorway begins approximately 10 kilometres east of Hook of Holland near Westerlee, heading east towards Rotterdam and Utrecht. It connects to the A4 heading north towards The Hague and Amsterdam 17 kilometres east of the village.

<text>Hugh Binning (1627–1653) was a Scottish philosopher and theologian. He was born in Scotland during the reign of Charles I and was ordained in the (Presbyterian) Church of Scotland. He died in 1653, during the time of Oliver Cromwell and the Commonwealth of England.

==Personal life==

Hugh Binning was the son of John Binning of Dalvennan, Straiton, South Ayrshire. and Margaret M&#x27;Kell. Margaret was the daughter of Matthew McKell,
who was a minister in the parish of Bothwell, Scotland, and sister of Hugh M&#x27;Kell, a minister in Edinburgh. Binning was born on his father&#x27;s estate in Dalvennan. The family owned other lands in the parishes of Straiton and Colmonell as well as Maybole in Carrick.

A precocious child, Binning was admitted to the study of philosophy at the University of Glasgow at age thirteen. Binning has been described as &quot;an extraordinary instance of precocious learning and genius.&quot;

In 1645, James Dalrymple, 1st Viscount of Stair, who was Hugh&#x27;s master (primary professor) in the study of philosophy, announced he was retiring from the University of Glasgow. Dalrymple was afterward President of the Court of Session, and Viscount Stair. After a national search for a replacement on the faculty, three men were selected to compete for the position. Binning was one of those selected, but was at a disadvantage because of his extreme youth and because he was not of noble birth. However, he had strong support from the existing faculty, who suggested that the candidates speak extemporaneously on any topic of the candidate&#x27;s choice. After hearing Hugh speak, the other candidates withdrew, making Hugh a regent and professor of philosophy, while he was still 18 years old.

On 7 February 1648, (at the age of 21) Hugh was appointed an Advocate before the Court of Sessions (an attorney). In the same year, he married Barbara Simpson (sometimes called Mary), daughter of James Simpson a minister in Ireland. Their son, John, was born in 1650.

Binning became a minister on 25 October 1649. As minister of Govan, he was the successor of William Wilkie. His ordination took place on 8 January 1649, when Mr David Dickson, one of the theological professors at the College of Glasgow, and author of &quot;Therapeutica Sacra&quot;, presided. He was ordained in January, at the age of 22, holding his regency until 14 May that year. At that time Govan was a separate town rather than part of Glasgow.

Hugh died around September 1653 and was buried in the churchyard of Govan, where Patrick Gillespie, then principal of the University of Glasgow, ordered a monument inscribed in Latin, roughly translated:
Hugh&#x27;s widow, Barbara (or Mary), then remarried James Gordon, an Anglican priest at Cumber in Ireland. Together they had a daughter,Jean who married Daniel MacKenzie, who was on the winning side of the Battle of Bothwell Bridge serving as an ensign under Lieutenant-Colonel William Ramsay (who became the third Earl of Dalhousie), in the Earl of Mar&#x27;s Regiment of Foot.

Binning&#x27;s son, John Binning, married Hanna Keir, who was born in Ireland. The Binnings were Covenanters, a resistance movement that objected to the return of Charles II (who was received into the Catholic Church on his deathbed). They were on the losing side in the 1679 Battle of Bothwell Bridge. Most of the rebels who were not executed were exiled to the Americas; about 30 Covenanters were exiled to the Carolinas on the Carolina Merchant in 1684. After the battle, John and Hanna were separated.

In the aftermath of the battle at Bothwell Bridge, Hugh Binning&#x27;s widow (now Barbara Gordon) tried to reclaim the family estate at Dalvennan by saying that John and his wife owed his stepfather a considerable some of money. The legal action was successful and Dalvennan became the possession of John&#x27;s half-sister Jean, and her husband Daniel MacKenzie. In addition, Jean came into possession of Hanna Keir&#x27;s property in Ireland.

By 1683, Jean was widowed. John Binning was branded a traitor, was sentenced to death and forfeited his property to the Crown. John&#x27;s wife (Hanna Keir) was branded as a traitor and forfeited her property in Ireland. In 1685, Jean &quot;donated&quot; the Binning family&#x27;s home at Dalvennan and other properties, along with the Keir properties, to Roderick MacKenzie, who was a Scottish advocate of James II (James VII of Scotland), and the baillie of Carrick. According to an act of the Scottish Parliament, Roderick MacKenzie was also very effective in &quot;suppressing the rebellious, fanatical party in the western and other shires of this realm, and putting the laws to vigorous execution against them&quot;.

Since Bothwell Bridge, Hanna had been hiding from the authorities. In 1685, Hanna was in Edinburgh where she was found during a sweep for subversives and imprisoned in the Tolbooth of Edinburgh, a combination city hall and prison. Those arrested with Hanna were exiled to North America, however, she developed dysentery and remained behind. By 1687, near death, Hanna petitioned the Privy Council of Scotland for her release; she was exiled to her family in Ireland, where she died around 1692.
In 1690, the Scottish Parliament rescinded John&#x27;s fines and forfeiture, but he was unable to recover his family&#x27;s estates, the courts suggesting that he had relinquished his claim to Dalvennan in exchange for forgiveness of debt, rather than forfeiture.

There is little documentation about John after his wife&#x27;s death. John received a small income from royalties on his father&#x27;s works after parliament extended copyrights on Binning&#x27;s writings to him. However, the income was not significant and John made several petitions to the Scottish parliament for money, the last occurring in 1717. It is thought that he died in Somerset county, in southwestern England.

He died of consumption at the age of 26 on September 1653. He was remarkably popular as a preacher, having been considered &quot;the most accomplished philosopher and divine in his time, and styled the Scottish Cicero.&quot; He married (cont. 17 May 1650), Mary (who died at Paisley in 1694) and had a son, John of Dalvennan. She was the daughter of Richard Simson, minister of Sprouston. After John&#x27;s early death Mary married her second husband, James Gordon, minister of Comber, in Ireland. A marble tablet, with an inscription in classical Latin, was erected to his memory by his friend Mr Patrick Gillespie, who was then Principal of the University of Glasgow. It has been placed in the vestibule of the present parish church. The whole of his works are posthumous publications.

He was a follower of James Dalrymple. In later life, he was well known as an evangelical Christian.

==Impact of the Commonwealth==
Hugh Binning was born two years after Charles I became monarch of England, Ireland, and Scotland. At the time, each was an independent country sharing the same monarch. The Acts of Union 1707 integrated Scotland and England to form the Kingdom of Great Britain, and the Acts of Union 1800 integrated Ireland to form the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland.

The period was dominated by both political and religious strife between the three independent countries. Religious disputes centered on questions such as whether religion was to be dictated by the monarch or was to be the choice of the people, and whether individuals had a direct relationship with God or needed to use an intermediary. Civil disputes centered on debates about the extent of the King&#x27;s power (a question of the Divine right of kings), and specifically whether the King had the right to raise taxes and armed forces without the consent of the governed. These wars ultimately changed the relationship between king and subjects.

In 1638, the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland voted to remove bishops and the &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot; that had been introduced by Charles I to impose the Anglican model on the Presbyterian Church of Scotland. Public riots followed, culminating in the Wars of the Three Kingdoms, an interrelated series of conflicts that took place in the three countries. The first conflict, which was also the first of the Bishops&#x27; Wars, took place in 1639 and was a single border skirmish between England and Scotland, also known as &quot;the war the armys did not wanted to fight.&quot;

To maintain his English power base, Charles I made secret alliances with Catholic Ireland and Presbyterian Scotland to invade Anglican England, promising that each country could establish their own separate state religion. Once these secret entreaties became known to the English Long Parliament, the Congregationalist faction (of which Oliver Cromwell was a primary spokesman) took matters into its own hands and Parliament established an army separate from the King. Charles I was executed in January 1649, which led to the rule of Cromwell and the establishment of the Commonwealth. The conflicts concluded with The English Restoration of the monarchy and the return of Charles II in 1660.

The Act of Classes was passed by the Parliament of Scotland on 23 January 1649; the act banned Royalists (people supporting the monarchy) from holding political or military office. In exile, Charles II signed the Treaty of Breda (1650) with the Scottish Parliament; among other things, the treaty established Presbyterianism as the national religion. Charles was crowned King of Scots at Scone in January 1651. By September 1651, Scotland was annexed by England, its legislative institutions abolished, Presbyterianism dis-established, and Charles was forced into exile in France.

The Scottish Parliament rescinded the Act of Classes in 1651, which produced a split within Scottish society. The sides of the conflict were called the Resolutioners (who supported the rescission of the act – supported the monarchy and the Scottish House of Stewart) and the Protesters (who supported Cromwell and the Commonwealth); Binning sided with the Protestors. Binning joined the Protesters in 1651. When Cromwell had sent troops to Scotland, he was also attempting to dis-establish Presbyterianism and the Church of Scotland, Binning spoke against Cromwell&#x27;s act.

On Saturday 19 April 1651, Cromwell entered Glasgow and the next day he heard a sermon by three ministers who condemned him for invading Scotland. That evening, Cromwell summoned those ministers and others, to a debate on the issue. a discussion on some of the controverted points of the times was held in his presence, between his chaplains, the learned Dr John Owen, Joseph Caryl, and others on the one side, and some Scots ministers on the other. Mr. Binning, who was one of the disputants, apparently nonplussed the Independents, which led Cromwell to ask who the learned and bold young man was. Told it was Binning, he said: &quot;He hath bound well, indeed,&quot; ... &quot; but, laying his hand on his sword, this will lose all again.&quot; The late Mr. Orme was of the opinion that there is nothing improbable in the account of the meeting, but that such a meeting took place is certain. This appears from two letters which were written by Principal Robert Baillie, who was then Professor of Theology at the University of Glasgow.At the debate, Rev Hugh Binning is said to have out-debated Cromwell&#x27;s ministers so completely that he silenced them.

==Politics==

Hugh Binning&#x27;s political views were based on his theology. Binning was a Covenanter, a movement that began in Scotland at Greyfriars Kirkyard in 1638 with the National Covenant and continued with the 1643 Solemn League and Covenant—in effect a treaty between the English Long Parliament and Scotland for the preservation of the reformed religion in exchange for troops to confront the threat of Irish Catholic troops joining the Royalist army. Binning could also be described as a Protestor; both political positions were taken because of their religious implications. However, he saw the evils of the politics of his day was not a &quot;fomenter of factions&quot; writing &quot;A Treatise of Christian Love&quot; as a response.

==Theology==
Because of the tumultuous time in which Hugh Binning lived, politics and religion were inexorably intertwined. Binning was a Calvinist and follower of John Knox. As a profession, Binning was trained as a Philosopher, and he believed that philosophy was the servant of theology. He thought that both Philosophy and Theology should be taught in parallel. Binning&#x27;s writing, which is primarily a collection of his sermons, &quot;forms an important bridge between the 17th century, when philosophy in Scotland was heavily dominated by Calvinism, and the 18th century when figures such as Francis Hutcheson re-asserted a greater degree of independence between the two and allied philosophy with the developing human sciences.&quot;

Religiously, Hugh Binning was, what we would call today, an Evangelical Calvinist. He spoke on the primacy of God&#x27;s love as the ground of salvation: 
&quot;... our salvation is not the business of Christ alone, but the whole Godhead is interested in it deeply, so deeply that you cannot say who loves it most, or who likes it most. The Father is the very fountain of it, his love is the spring of all.&quot;

With regards to the extent of the &#x27;atonement&#x27;, Hugh Binning, did not hold that the offer of redemption applied only to the few that are elect but said that &quot;the ultimate ground of faith is in the electing will of God.&quot; In Scotland, during the 1600s, the questions concerning atonement revolved around the terms in which the offer was expressed.

Binning believed that &quot;forgiveness is based on Christ&#x27;s death, understood as a satisfaction and as a sacrifice: &#x27;If he had pardoned sin without any satisfaction what rich grace it had been! But truly, to provide the Lamb and sacrifice himself, to find out the ransom, and to exact it of his own Son, in our name, is a testimony
of mercy and grace far beyond that. But then, his justice is very conspicuous in this work&#x27;.&quot;

==Works==

All of the works of Hugh Binning were published posthumously and were primarily collections of his sermons. Of his speaking style, it was said: &quot;There is originality without any affectation, a rich imagination, without anything fanciful or extravert, the utmost simplicity, without an thing mean or trifling.&quot; 
*&quot;The Common Principles of the Christian Religion, Clearly Proved, and Singularly Improved; or, A Practical Catechism&quot; published by Patrick Gillespie in 1660 An analysis of the Westminster Confession of Faith. The work was translated into Dutch in 1678 by James Koelman, a minister of Sluys in Flanders.

(The Common Principles of the Christian Religion, fulltext) Quotations from the publication include: 
::&quot;On the love of God&quot;
:::And what is love but the very motion of the soul to God? And so till it have attained that, to be in him, it can find no place of rest. 
::&quot;On the free grace of the Gospel&quot;
:::I am guilty, and can say nothing against it, while I stand alone. But though I cannot satisfy, and have not; yet there is one, Jesus Christ, who gave his life a ransom for many, and whom God hath given as a propitiation for sins. He hath satisfied and paid the debt in my name; go and apprehend the cautioner, since he hath undertaken it, nay, he hath done it, and is absolved.
::&quot;On Learning&quot; 
:::Be not ignorant as beasts, that know no other things than to follow the drove; quæ pergunt, non quo eundum est, sed quo itur; &quot;they follow not whither they ought to go, but whither most go&quot;. You are men, and have reasonable souls within you; therefore I beseech you, be not composed and fashioned according to custom and example, that is, brutish, but according to some inward knowledge and reason. Retire once from the multitude, and ask in earnest at God, What is the way? Him that fears him he will teach the way that he should choose. The way to his blessed end is very strait, very difficult; you must have a guide in it,—you must have a lamp and a light in it,—else you cannot but go wrong.
*&quot;Sinner&#x27;s Sanctuary, being forty Sermons upon the eighth Chapter of the Epistle of the Romans, from the First Verse down to the Eighteenth.&quot; a treatise originally published in 1670 
*&quot;Fellowship with God, being Twenty Eight Sermons on the First Epistle of John, Chap. 1st and Chap. 2nd, Verses 1, 2, 3.&quot; a treatise originally published in 1671 by &quot;A.S. who in the preferace to the reader, styles himself, his servant in the gosple of our dearest Lord and Savior&quot; 
*&quot;Heart Humiliation or Miscellany Sermons, preached upon some choice texts at several solemn occasions.&quot; originally published in 1676 by the same A.S. that published the treatice &quot;Fellowship with God&quot;. The first of the sermons was preached July 1650 
*&quot;An Useful Case of Conscience, Learnedly and Accurately Discussed and Resolved, Concerning Associations and Confederacies with Idolaters, Infidels, Heretics, Malignants or any other Known Enemies of Truth and Godliness. &quot; The treatise was used by the Covenanters and seems to have been originally published in Holland in 1693. There is a reference to the treatise at a &quot;general meeting of Society people ... at Edinburgh 28 May 1683.&quot; The treatise expressed the opinion that Scotland should not support Charles I without some restraint placed on relatively absolute royal power and without assurance the Presbyterian religion could be maintained. The documents seem to have been presented to the Society either by Hugh Binning&#x27;s son, John, or his widow, Barbara Gordon (who remarried about 1657 to James Gordon; he was born in Ireland and became a minister at Paisley, Renfrewshire, Scotland.) (An Useful Case of Conscience, fulltext). In the treatise Binning writes:
::Where God hath given us liberty by the law of nature, or his word, no king can justly tie us, and when God binds and obliges us by any of these, no king or parliament can loose or untie us.
*&quot;A Treatise of Christian Love&quot; a sermon based on John 13:35, “By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one to another” and 1 Corinthians 13. Binning explores the concept that as a believer in Christ, there is a need for Christians to show by their love for one another. (A Treatise of Christian Love, fulltext) Binning argues: 
::But Christ’s last words persuade this, that unity in affection is more essential and fundamental. This is the badge he left to his disciples. If we cast away this upon every different apprehension of mind, we disown our Master, and disclaim his token and badge.
::&quot;On Charity&quot;
:::Charity &quot;thinketh no evil.&quot; [1 Cor. 13:5] Charity is apt to take all things in the best sense. If a thing may be subject to diverse acceptations, it can put the best construction on it. It is so benign and good in its own nature that it is not inclinable to suspect others. It desires to condemn no man, but would gladly, as far as reason and conscience will permit, absolve every man. It is so far from desire of revenge, that it is not provoked or troubled with an injury. For that were nothing else but to wrong itself because others have wronged it already, and it is so far from wronging others, that it will not willingly so much as think evil of them. Yet if need requires, charity can execute justice, and inflict chastisement, not out of desire of another’s misery, but out of love and compassion to mankind. Charitas non punit quia peccatum est, sed ne peccaretur, &quot;it looks more to prevention of future sin, than to revenge of a bypast fault&quot;, and can do all without any discomposure of spirit, as a physician cuts a vein without anger. Quis enim cut medetur irascitur? &quot;&quot;Who is angry at his own patient&quot;?&quot;

* In 1735, the collections of Binning&#x27;s works were published posthumously, originally edited by M. Leishman, a minister who was a later successor to Hugh in the parish of Govan, which contained sermons not previously published. There have been several editions of &quot;The Complete Works of the Rev. Hugh Binning&quot;, one of the latest (Classic Reprint) was published by Forgotten Books in 2012.

<doc id="14064" wikidata="Q1341370" url="?curid=14064" title="Henry Home, Lord Kames">
<text>Henry Home, Lord Kames (1696–27 December 1782) was a Scottish writer, philosopher and judge who played a major role in Scotland&#x27;s Agricultural Revolution. A central figure of the Scottish Enlightenment, he was a founding member of the Philosophical Society of Edinburgh and active in The Select Society. Home acted as patron to some of the most influential thinkers of the Scottish Enlightenment, including philosopher David Hume, economist Adam Smith, writer James Boswell, philosopher William Cullen and naturalist John Walker.

==Life==

Henry Home was born in 1696 at Kames House, between Eccles and Birgham in Berwickshire. Henry was the son of George Home of Kames, and was homeschooled by Mr Wingate, a private tutor, until the age of 16. In 1712, Home was apprenticed as a lawyer under a Writer to the Signet in Edinburgh, and was called to the Scottish bar as an advocate bar in 1724. He soon acquired reputation by a number of publications on the civil and Scottish law, and was one of the leaders of the Scottish Enlightenment. In 1752, he was &quot;raised to the bench&quot;, thus acquiring the title of Lord Kames.

Kames held an interest in the development and production of linen in Scotland. Kames was one of the original proprietors of the British Linen Company, serving as a director of the company from 1754 to 1756. Kames was on the panel of judges in the &quot;Knight v. Wedderburn&quot; case which ruled that slavery was illegal in Scotland. In 1775, he lived in a townhouse in Canongate. The house was located the head of the street&#x27;s east side, facing onto the Canongate. 

He died of old age, aged 86, and is buried in the Home-Drummond plot at Kincardine-in-Menteith west of Blair Drummond.

==Writings==
Home wrote much about the importance of property to society. In his &quot;Essay Upon Several Subjects Concerning British Antiquities&quot;, written just after the Jacobite rising of 1745, he showed that the politics of Scotland were based not on loyalty to Kings, as the Jacobites had said, but on the royal land grants that lay at the base of feudalism, the system whereby the sovereign maintained &quot;an immediate hold of the persons and property of his subjects&quot;.

In &quot;Historical Law Tracts&quot; Home described a four-stage model of social evolution that became &quot;a way of organizing the history of Western civilization&quot;. The first stage was that of the hunter-gatherer, wherein families avoided each other as competitors for the same food. The second was that of the herder of domestic animals, which encouraged the formation of larger groups but did not result in what Home considered a true society. No laws were needed at these early stages except those given by the head of the family, clan, or tribe. Agriculture was the third stage, wherein new occupations such as &quot;plowman, carpenter, blacksmith, stonemason&quot; made &quot;the industry of individuals profitable to others as well as to themselves&quot;, and a new complexity of relationships, rights, and obligations required laws and law enforcers. A fourth stage evolved with the development of market towns and seaports, &quot;commercial society&quot;, bringing yet more laws and complexity but also providing more benefit. Lord Kames could see these stages within Scotland itself, with the pastoral Highlands, the agricultural Lowlands, the &quot;polite&quot; commercial towns of Glasgow and Edinburgh, and in the Western Isles a remaining culture of rude huts where fishermen and gatherers of seaweed eked out their subsistence living.

Home was a polygenist, he believed God had created different races on earth in separate regions. In his book &quot;Sketches of the History of Man&quot;, in 1774, Home claimed that the environment, climate, or state of society could not account for racial differences, so that the races must have come from distinct, separate stocks.

The above studies created the genre of the story of civilization and defined the fields of anthropology and sociology and therefore the modern study of history for two hundred years.

In the popular book &quot;Elements of Criticism&quot; (1762) Home interrogated the notion of fixed or arbitrary rules of literary composition, and endeavoured to establish a new theory based on the principles of human nature. The late eighteenth-century tradition of sentimental writing was associated with his notion that &quot;the genuine rules of criticism are all of them derived from the human heart.&quot; Neil Rhodes has argued that Lord Kames played a significant role in the development of English as an academic discipline in the Scottish Universities.

==Family==
He was married to Agatha Drummond of Blair Drummond. Their children included George Drummond-Home.

<doc id="14065" wikidata="Q990616" url="?curid=14065" title="Harwich">
<text>Harwich is a town in Essex, England, and one of the Haven ports on the North Sea coast. It is in the Tendring district. Nearby places include Felixstowe to the north-east, Ipswich to the north-west, Colchester to the south-west and Clacton-on-Sea to the south. It is the northernmost coastal town in Essex.

Its position on the estuaries of the Stour and Orwell rivers, with its usefulness to mariners as the only safe anchorage between the Thames and the Humber, led to a long period of civil and military maritime significance. The town became a naval base in 1657 and was heavily fortified, with Harwich Redoubt, Beacon Hill Battery, and Bath Side Battery.

Harwich is the likely launch point of the &quot;Mayflower&quot;, which carried English Puritans to North America, and is the presumed birthplace of &quot;Mayflower&quot; captain Christopher Jones.

Harwich today is contiguous with Dovercourt and the two, along with Parkeston, are often referred to collectively as &quot;Harwich&quot;.

==History==

The town&#x27;s name means &quot;military settlement&quot;, from Old English &quot;here-wic&quot;.

In 885 the River Stour Suffolk north of the town was the location for the two Battles of the River Stour.

The town received its charter in 1238, although there is evidence of earlier settlement – for example, a record of a chapel in 1177, and some indications of a possible Roman presence.

The town was the target of an abortive raid by French forces under Antonio Doria on 24 March 1339 during the Hundred Years&#x27; War.

Because of its strategic position, Harwich was the target for the invasion of Britain by William of Orange on 11 November 1688. However, unfavourable winds forced his fleet to sail into the English Channel instead and eventually land at Torbay. Due to the involvement of the Schomberg family in the invasion, Charles Louis Schomberg was made Marquess of Harwich.

Writer Daniel Defoe devotes a few pages to the town in &quot;A tour thro&#x27; the Whole Island of Great Britain&quot;. Visiting in 1722, he noted its formidable fort and harbour &quot;of a vast extent&quot;. The town, he recounts, was also known for an unusual chalybeate spring rising on Beacon Hill (a promontory to the north-east of the town), which &quot;petrified&quot; clay, allowing it to be used to pave Harwich&#x27;s streets and build its walls. The locals also claimed that &quot;the same spring is said to turn wood into iron&quot;, but Defoe put this down to the presence of &quot;copperas&quot; in the water. Regarding the atmosphere of the town, he states: &quot;Harwich is a town of hurry and business, not much of gaiety and pleasure; yet the inhabitants seem warm in their nests and some of them are very wealthy&quot;.

Harwich played an important part in the Napoleonic and more especially the two world wars. Of particular note:
1793–1815: Post Office Station for communication with Europe, one of embarkation and evacuation bases for expeditions to Holland in 1799, 1809, and 1813/14; base for capturing enemy privateers. The dockyard built many ships for the Navy, including HMS &quot;Conqueror&quot; which captured the French Admiral Villeneuve at the Battle of Trafalgar. The Redoubt and the now-demolished Ordnance Building date from that era.

1914–1918: Base for the Royal Navy&#x27;s Harwich Force light cruisers and destroyers under Commodore Tyrwhitt, and for British submarines. In November 1918, the German U-boat fleet surrendered to the Royal Navy in the harbour.

1939–1945: One of main East Coast minesweeping and destroyer bases, at one period base for British and French submarines; assembled fleets for Dutch and Dunkirk evacuations and follow-up to D-Day; unusually, a target for Italian bombers during the Battle of Britain.

===Royal Naval Dockyard===

Harwich Dockyard was established as a Naval Dockyard in 1652. It ceased to operate as a Royal Dockyard in 1713 (though a Royal Navy presence was maintained until 1829). During the various wars with France and Holland, through to 1815, the dockyard was responsible for both building and repairing numerous warships. HMS &quot;Conqueror&quot;, a 74-gun ship completed in 1801, captured the French admiral Villeneuve at Trafalgar. The yard was then a semi-private concern, with the actual shipbuilding contracted to Joseph Graham, who was sometimes mayor of the town. During World War II parts of Harwich were again requisitioned for naval use and ships were based at HMS &quot;Badger&quot;; &quot;Badger&quot; was decommissioned in 1946, but the Royal Naval Auxiliary Service maintained a headquarters on the site until 1992.

===Lighthouses===
In 1665, not long after the establishment of the Dockyard, a pair of lighthouses were set up on the Town Green to serve as leading lights for ships entering the harbour. Completely rebuilt in 1818, both towers are still standing (though they ceased functioning as lighthouses in 1863, when they were replaced by a new pair of lights at Dovercourt).

==Transport==

The Royal Navy no longer has a presence in Harwich but Harwich International Port at nearby Parkeston continues to offer regular ferry services to the Hook of Holland (Hoek van Holland) in the Netherlands.
Many operations of the Port of Felixstowe and of Trinity House, the lighthouse authority, are managed from Harwich.

The Mayflower railway line serves Harwich and there are three operational passenger stations: , and . The line also allows freight trains to access the Port.

The port is famous for the phrase &quot;Harwich for the Continent&quot;, seen on road signs and in London and North Eastern Railway (LNER) advertisements.

From 1924 to 1987 (with a break during the Second World War), a train ferry service operated between Harwich and Zeebrugge. The train ferry linkspan still exists today and the rails leading from the former goods yard of Harwich Town railway station are still in position across the road, although the line is blocked by the Trinity House buoy store.

== Architecture ==

Despite, or perhaps because of, its small size Harwich is highly regarded in terms of architectural heritage, and the whole of the older part of the town, excluding Navyard Wharf, is a conservation area.

The regular street plan with principal thoroughfares connected by numerous small alleys indicates the town&#x27;s medieval origins, although many buildings of this period are hidden behind 18th century facades.

The extant medieval structures are largely private homes. The house featured in the image of Kings Head St to the left is unique in the town and is an example of a sailmaker&#x27;s house, thought to have been built circa 1600. Notable public buildings include the parish church of St. Nicholas of 1820–1822 (architect: M G Thompson of Dedham), in a restrained Gothic style, with many original furnishings, including a somewhat altered organ in the west end gallery. There is also the Harwich Guildhall of 1769, the only Grade I listed building in Harwich.
The Pier Hotel of 1860 and the building that was the Great Eastern Hotel of 1864 can both been seen on the quayside, both reflecting the town&#x27;s new importance to travellers following the arrival of the Great Eastern Main Line from Colchester in 1854. In 1923, The Great Eastern Hotel was closed by the newly formed LNER, as the Great Eastern Railway had opened a new hotel with the same name at the new passenger port at Parkeston Quay, causing a decline in numbers. The hotel became the Harwich Town Hall, which included the Magistrates Court and, following changes in local government, was sold and divided into apartments.

Also of interest are the High Lighthouse (1818), the unusual Treadwheel Crane (late 17th century), the Old Custom Houses on West Street, a number of Victorian shopfronts and the Electric Palace Cinema (1911), one of the oldest purpose-built cinemas to survive complete with its ornamental frontage and original projection room still intact and operational.

There is little notable building from the later parts of the 20th century, but major recent additions include the lifeboat station and two new structures for Trinity House. The Trinity House office building, next door to the Old Custom Houses, was completed in 2005. All three additions are influenced by the high-tech style.

==International Shanty Festival ==

A Harwich International Shanty Festival was set up in 2006 to organise and co-ordinate an annual sea shanty festival in October. Through concerts, &#x27;singarounds&#x27;, pub sessions, talks and workshops, the seafaring history and heritage of Harwich is celebrated by local people and international groups. This unique event for Essex attracts audiences countrywide and beyond. The festival is one of the biggest shanty festivals in the country.

He was one of the earliest landscape painters of the 17th-century Dutch school, he specialized in painting the Netherlands in winter. His paintings are colorful and lively, with carefully crafted images of the people in the landscape. His works give a vivid depiction of sport and leisure in the Netherlands in the beginning of the 17th century. Many of Avercamp&#x27;s paintings feature people ice skating on frozen lakes.

Avercamp&#x27;s work enjoyed great popularity and he sold his drawings, many of which were tinted with water-color, as finished pictures to be pasted into the albums of collectors. The Royal Collection has an outstanding collection of his works.

== Life ==
Avercamp was born in Amsterdam, where he studied with the Danish-born portrait painter Pieter Isaacsz (1569–1625), and perhaps also with David Vinckboons, who was a follower of Pieter Brueghel the Elder. In 1608 he moved from Amsterdam to Kampen in the province of Overijssel. Avercamp was mute and probably deaf, he was known as &quot;de Stomme van Kampen&quot; (the mute of Kampen). He also had a nephew Barent Avercamp (1621-1679) who was also a painter and who imitated Hendrick&#x27;s style of painting. Avercamp lived his entire life through the Eighty Years&#x27; war, where the young Dutch Republic resisted in a war against the Spanish Habsburgs. He died in Kampen and was interred there in the Sint Nicolaaskerk.

==Artwork==

Avercamp probably painted in his studio on the basis of sketches he had made in the winter.
Avercamp was famous even from abroad for his winter landscapes. The passion for painting skating characters probably came from his childhood as he practiced skating with his parents. The last quarter of the 16th century, during which Avercamp was born, was one of the coldest periods of the Little Ice Age.

The Flemish painting tradition is mainly expressed in Avercamp&#x27;s early work. This is consistent with the landscapes of Pieter Bruegel the Elder. Avercamp painted landscapes with a high horizon and many figures who were working on something. Many of his paintings are narrative-based, with many anecdotes. For instance, included in the painting &quot;Winter Landscape with Skaters&quot; are several prurient details: a couple making love, naked buttocks, and a peeing male. 

Avercamp used the painting technique of aerial perspective. The depth is suggested by a change of color in the distance. To the front objects are painted in richer colors, such as trees or a boat, while farther objects are lighter. This technique strengthens the impression of depth in the painting.

Sometimes Avercamp used paper frames, which were a cheap alternative to oil paintings. He first drew with pen and ink. This work was then covered with finishing paint. The contours of the drawing remained. Even with this technique, Avercamp could show the pale wintry colors and nuances of the ice. Avercamp has also painted cattle and seascapes. Later in his life drawing the atmosphere was also important in his work.

Avercamp produced about a hundred paintings. The bulk of his artwork can be seen in the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam and the Mauritshuis in The Hague. 
From November 20, 2009, to February 15, 2010, the Rijksmuseum presented an exhibition of his work entitled The &quot;Little Ice Age&quot;.

<text>Hans Baldung (1484 or 1485 – September 1545), called Hans Baldung Grien, (being an early nickname, because of his predilection for the colour green), was a painter, printer, engraver, draftsman, and stained glass artist, who was considered the most gifted student of Albrecht Dürer and whose art belongs to both German Renaissance and Mannerism. 
Throughout his lifetime, he developed a distinctive style, full of colour, expression and imagination. His talents were varied, and he produced a great and extensive variety of work including portraits, woodcuts, drawings, tapestries, altarpieces, and stained glass, often relying on allegories and mythological motifs.

==Life==

===Early life, c. 1484–1500===

Hans was born in Schwäbisch Gmünd (formerly Gmünd in Germany), a small free city of the Empire, part of the East Württemberg region in former Swabia, Germany, in the year 1484 or 1485. Baldung was the son of Johann Baldung, a university-educated jurist, who held the office of legal adviser to the bishop of Strasbourg (Albert of Bavaria) from 1492, and Margarethe Herlin, daughter of Arbogast Herlin. His uncle, Hieronymus Baldung, was a doctor in medicine, with a son, Pius Hieronymus, Hans&#x27; cousin, who taught law at Freiburg and became chancellor of Tyrol in 1527.

Hans was not propertyless, but with unknown occupation. He was the first male in his family not to attend university, but was one of the first German artists to come from an academic family.

==Life as a student of Dürer==
Baldung&#x27;s earliest training as an artist began around 1500 in the Upper Rhineland with an artist from Strasbourg. Beginning in 1503, during the &quot;Wanderjahre&quot; (&quot;years of wandering&quot;) required of artists of the time, Baldung became an assistant in Albrecht Dürer&#x27;s studio in Nuremberg, where he perfected his art between 1503 and 1507.

Here, he may have been given his nickname &quot;Grien&quot;. This name is thought to have come foremost from a preference to the color green: he seems to have worn green clothing. He may also have been given this nickname to distinguish him from at least two other Hanses in Dürer&#x27;s shop, Hans Schäufelin and Hans Suess von Kulmbach. He later included the name &quot;Grien&quot; in his monogram, and it has also been suggested that the name came from, or consciously echoed, &quot;grienhals&quot;, a German word for witch—one of his signature themes. 

Hans quickly picked up Dürer&#x27;s influence and style, and they became friends. Baldung seems to have managed Dürer&#x27;s workshop during the latter&#x27;s second sojourn in Venice. In a later trip to the Netherlands in 1521 Dürer&#x27;s account book records that he took with him and sold prints by Baldung. Near the end of his Nuremberg years, Grien oversaw the production by Dürer of stained glass, woodcuts and engravings, and therefore developed an affinity for these media and for the Nuremberg master&#x27;s handing of them. On Dürer&#x27;s death Baldung was sent a lock of his hair, which suggests a close friendship.

==Strasbourg==
In 1509, when Baldung&#x27;s time in Nuremberg was complete, he moved back to Strasbourg and became a citizen there. He became a celebrity of the town and received many important commissions. The following year, at age 26, he married Margarethe Herlin, a local merchant&#x27;s daughter, with whom he had one child, Margarethe Baldungin. He also joined the guild &quot;Zur Steltz&quot;, opened a workshop, and began signing his works with the HGB monogram that he used for the rest of his career. 

His style became much more deliberately individual—a tendency art historians used to term &quot;mannerist.&quot; He stayed in Freiburg im Breisgau in 1513–1516 where he made, among other things, the .

Like Dürer and Cranach, Baldung supported the Protestant Reformation. He was present at the diet of Augsburg in 1518, and one of his woodcuts represents Luther in quasi-saintly guise, under the protection of (or being inspired by) the Holy Spirit, which hovers over him in the shape of a dove.

==Witchcraft and religious imagery==
In addition to traditional religious subjects, Baldung was concerned during these years with the profane themes of the imminence of death and the relation between the sexes, as well as with scenes of sorcery and witchcraft. The number of Baldung&#x27;s religious works diminished with the Protestant Reformation, which generally repudiated church art as either wasteful or idolatrous.

While Dürer had occasionally included images of witches in his work, Baldung was the first German artist to heavily incorporate witches and witchcraft and erotic themes into his artwork. His most characteristic works in this area are small in scale and mostly in the medium of drawing; these include a series of puzzling, often erotic allegories and mythological works executed in quill pen and ink and white body color on primed paper. 

His fascination with witchcraft began early, in 1510 when he produced an important chiaroscuro woodcut known as &quot;The Witches&#x27; Sabbath&quot;, and lasted to the end of his career. Witches were also a local interest: Strasbourg&#x27;s humanists studied witchcraft and its bishop was charged with finding and prosecuting witches. 

Baldung&#x27;s work depicting witches was produced in the first half of the 16th century, before witch hunting became a widespread cultural phenomenon in Europe. According to one view, Baldung&#x27;s work did not represent widespread cultural beliefs at the time of creation but reflected largely individual choices. 
On the other hand, Baldung may have taken inspiration from the humanism of the early 16th century. Baldung, through his family, stood closer to the leading humanist intellectuals of the day than any of his contemporaries and partook in this culture, producing not only many works depicting Strasbourg humanists and scenes from ancient art and literature, but also works reflecting their attitude, drawn in large part from classical poetry and satire, toward witches. To take one example, Baldung is believed to have alluded to the notion expressed in Latin and Greek literature that witches could control the weather in his 1523 oil painting &quot;Weather Witches&quot;, which showcases two attractive and naked witches in front of a stormy sky. As Gert von der Osten commented, &quot;Baldung [treats] his witches humorously, an attitude that reflects the dominant viewpoint of the humanists in Strasbourg at this time who viewed witchcraft as &#x27;lustig,&#x27; a matter that was more amusing than serious&quot;. 

However, it has also proved difficult to distinguish between the satirical tone that some critics observe in Baldung&#x27;s work and a more serious vilifying intent, just as it is for many other artists, including his rough contemporary Hieronymus Bosch. Baldung could also draw on a burgeoning literature on witchcraft, as well as on developing juridical and forensic strategies for witch-hunting. While Baldung never worked directly with any Reformation leaders to spread religious ideals through his artwork, even though he lived in fervently religious Strasbourg, he was a supporter of the movement, working on the high altar in the city of Münster, Germany.

Baldung also regularly incorporated scenes of witches flying in his art, a characteristic that had been contested centuries before his artwork came into being. Flying was inherently attributed to witches by those who believed in the myth of the Sabbath Flight; without their ability to fly, the myth fragmented. Baldung depicted this in works such as &quot;Witches Preparing for the Sabbath Flight&quot; (1514).

==Work==

===Painting===
Baldung settled eventually in Strasbourg and then to Freiburg im Breisgau, where he executed what is held to be his masterpiece: an eleven-panel altarpiece for the Freiburg Cathedral, still intact today, depicting scenes from the life of the Virgin, including &quot;The Annunciation&quot;, &quot;The Visitation&quot;, &quot;The Nativity&quot;, &quot;The Flight into Egypt&quot;, &quot;The Crucifixion&quot;, &quot;Four Saints&quot; and &quot;The Donators&quot;. These depictions were a large part of the artist&#x27;s greater body of work containing several renowned depictions of the Virgin.

The earliest pictures assigned to him by some are altar-pieces with the monogram H. B. interlaced, and the date of 1496, in the monastery chapel of Lichtenthal near Baden-Baden. &quot;The Martyrdom of St Sebastian and the Epiphany&quot; (now Berlin, 1507) was painted for the market-church of Halle in Saxony.

Baldung is well known as a portrait painter, known for his sharp characterization of his subjects. His works include historical pictures and portraits, such as Maximilian I and Charles V. At a later period he had sittings with Margrave Christopher of Baden, Ottilia his wife, and all their children, and the picture containing these portraits is still in the gallery at Karlsruhe. 

While Dürer rigorously details his models, Baldung&#x27;s style differs by focusing more on the personality of the represented character, an abstract conception of the model&#x27;s state of mind.

===Printmaking===
His prints are more important than his paintings. Baldung&#x27;s prints, though Düreresque, are very individual in style, and often in subject, showing little direct Italian influence. He worked mainly in woodcut, although he made six engravings, one very fine. He joined in the fashion for chiaroscuro woodcuts, adding a tone block to a woodcut of 1510. Most of his hundreds of woodcuts were commissioned for books, as was usual at the time; his &quot;single-leaf&quot; woodcuts (i.e. prints not for book illustration) are fewer than 100, though no two catalogues agree as to the exact number.

Unconventional as a draughtsman, his treatment of human form is often exaggerated and eccentric (hence his linkage, in the art historical literature, with European Mannerism), whilst his ornamental style—profuse, eclectic, and akin to the self-consciously &quot;German&quot; strain of contemporary limewood sculptors—is equally distinctive. Though Baldung has been commonly called the Correggio of the north, his compositions are a curious medley of glaring and heterogeneous colours, in which pure black is contrasted with pale yellow, dirty grey, impure red and glowing green. Flesh is a mere glaze under which the features are indicated by lines.

His works are notable for their individualistic departure from the Renaissance composure of his model, Dürer, for the wild and fantastic strength that some of them display, and for their remarkable themes. In the field of painting, his &quot;Eve, the Serpent and Death&quot; (National Gallery of Canada) shows his strengths well. There is special force in the &quot;Death and the Maiden&quot; panel of 1517 (Basel), in the &quot;Weather Witches&quot; (Frankfurt), in the monumental panels of &quot;Adam&quot; and &quot;Eve&quot; (Madrid), and in his many powerful portraits. Baldung&#x27;s most sustained effort is the altarpiece of Freiburg, where the &quot;Coronation of the Virgin&quot;, and the &quot;Twelve Apostles&quot;, the &quot;Annunciation&quot;, &quot;Visitation&quot;, &quot;Nativity&quot; and &quot;Flight into Egypt&quot;, and the &quot;Crucifixion&quot;, with portraits of donors, are executed with some of that fanciful power that Martin Schongauer bequeathed to the Swabian school.

===Other works===
One of his earliest works is a portrait of the emperor Maximilian, drawn in 1501 on a leaf of a sketch-book now in the print-room at Karlsruhe. 

His bust of Margrave Philip in the Munich Gallery tells us that he was connected with the reigning family of Baden as early as 1514.

<text>The hammered dulcimer (also called the hammer dulcimer) is a percussion-stringed instrument which consists of strings typically stretched over a trapezoidal resonant sound board. The hammered dulcimer is set before the musician, who in more traditional styles may sit cross-legged on the floor, or in a more modern style may stand or sit at a wooden support with legs. The player holds a small spoon-shaped mallet hammer in each hand to strike the strings. The Graeco-Roman word &quot;dulcimer&quot; (&quot;sweet song&quot;) derives from the Latin &quot;dulcis&quot; (sweet) and the Greek &quot;melos&quot; (song). The dulcimer, in which the strings are beaten with small hammers, originated from the psaltery, in which the strings are plucked.
Hammered dulcimers and other similar instruments are traditionally played in Iraq, India, Iran, Southwest Asia, China, Korea, and parts of Southeast Asia, Central Europe (Hungary, Slovenia, Romania, Slovakia, Poland, Czech Republic, Switzerland [particularly Appenzell], Austria and Bavaria), the Balkans, Eastern Europe (Ukraine and Belarus), and Scandinavia. The instrument is also played in the United Kingdom (Wales, East Anglia, Northumbria), and the United States, where its traditional use in folk music saw a revival in the late 20th century.

== History ==
The santur, a type of hammered dulcimer, originates from the Middle East. The earliest evidence comes from Assyrian and Babylonian stone carvings dated to 669 BC, showing the instrument being played while hanging from the player&#x27;s neck. This instrument was traded and travelled to different parts of the Middle East. Musicians modified the original design over the centuries, yielding a wide array of musical scales and tunings. The original santur was likely made with wood and stone and strung with goat intestines. The Babylonian santur was the ancestor of the harp, yangqin, harpsichord, qanun, cimbalom and hammered dulcimers. 

In Western Europe, a hammered dulcimer first appears in textual and iconographic sources from the early 15th century. The hammered dulcimer was extensively used during the Middle Ages in England, France, Italy, Germany, the Netherlands, and Spain. 

==Strings and tuning==


A dulcimer usually has two bridges, a bass bridge near the right and a treble bridge on the left side. The bass bridge holds up bass strings, which are played to the left of the bridge. The treble strings can be played on either side of the treble bridge. In the usual construction, playing them on the left side gives a note a fifth higher than playing them on the right of the bridge.

The dulcimer comes in various sizes, identified by the number of strings that cross each of the bridges. A 15/14, for example, has 15 strings crossing the treble bridge and 14 crossing the bass bridge, and can span three octaves. The strings of a hammered dulcimer are usually found in pairs, two strings for each note (though some instruments have three or four strings per note). Each set of strings is tuned in unison and is called a course. As with a piano, the purpose of using multiple strings per course is to make the instrument louder, although as the courses are rarely in perfect unison, a chorus effect usually results like a mandolin. A hammered dulcimer, like an autoharp, harp, or piano, requires a tuning wrench for tuning, since the dulcimer&#x27;s strings are wound around tuning pins with square heads. (Ordinarily, 5 mm &quot;zither pins&quot; are used, similar to, but smaller in diameter than piano tuning pins, which come in various sizes ranging upwards from &quot;1/0&quot; or 7 mm.)

The strings of the hammered dulcimer are often tuned according to a circle of fifths pattern. Typically, the lowest note (often a G or D) is struck at the lower right-hand of the instrument, just to the left of the right-hand (bass) bridge. As a player strikes the courses above in sequence, they ascend following a repeating sequence of two whole steps and a half step. With this tuning, a diatonic scale is broken into two tetrachords, or groups of four notes. For example, on an instrument with D as the lowest note, the D major scale is played starting in the lower-right corner and ascending the bass bridge: D – E – F – G. This is the lower tetrachord of the D major scale. At this point the player returns to the bottom of the instrument and shifts to the treble strings to the right of the treble bridge to play the higher tetrachord: A – B – C – D. The player can continue up the scale on the right side of the treble bridge with E – F – G – A – B, but the next note will be C, not C, so he or she must switch to the left side of the treble bridge (and closer to the player) to continue the D major scale. See the drawing on the left above, in which &quot;DO&quot; would correspond to D (see Movable do solfège).

The shift from the bass bridge to the treble bridge is required because the bass bridge&#x27;s fourth string G is the start of the lower tetrachord of the G scale. The player could go on up a couple notes (G – A – B), but the next note will be a flatted seventh (C natural in this case), because this note is drawn from the G tetrachord. This D major scale with a flatted seventh is the mixolydian mode in D.

The same thing happens as the player goes up the treble bridge – after getting to La (B in this case), one has to go to the left of the treble bridge. Moving from the left side of the bass bridge to the right side of the treble bridge is analogous to moving from the right side of the treble bridge to the left side of the treble bridge.

The whole pattern can be shifted up by three courses, so that instead of a D-major scale one would have a G-major scale, and so on. This transposes one equally tempered scale to another. Shifting down three courses transposes the D-major scale to A-major, but of course the first Do-Re-Mi would be shifted off the instrument.

This tuning results in most, but not all, notes of the chromatic scale being available. To fill in the gaps, many modern dulcimer builders include extra short bridges at the top and bottom of the soundboard, where extra strings are tuned to some or all of the missing pitches. Such instruments are often called &quot;chromatic dulcimers&quot; as opposed to the more traditional &quot;diatonic dulcimers&quot;.

The tetrachord markers found on the bridges of most hammered dulcimers in the English-speaking world were introduced by the American player and maker Sam Rizzetta in the 1960s.

In the Alps there are also chromatic dulcimers with crossed strings, which are in a whole tone distance in every row. This chromatic &quot;Salzburger hackbrett&quot; was developed in the mid 1930s from the diatonic hammered dulcimer by Tobi Reizer and his son along with Franz Peyer and Heinrich Bandzauner. In the postwar period it was one of the instruments taught in state-sponsored music schools.

Hammered dulcimers of non-European descent may have other tuning patterns, and builders of European-style dulcimers sometimes experiment with alternate tuning patterns.

==Hammers==
The instrument is referred to as &quot;hammered&quot; in reference to the small mallets (referred to as &quot;hammers&quot;) that players use to strike the strings. Hammers are usually made of wood (most likely hardwoods such as maple, cherry, padauk, oak, walnut, or any other hardwood), but can also be made from any material, including metal and plastic. In the Western hemisphere, hammers are usually stiff, but in Asia, flexible hammers are often used. The head of the hammer can be left bare for a sharp attack sound, or can be covered with adhesive tape, leather, or fabric for a softer sound. Two-sided hammers are also available. The heads of two sided hammers are usually oval or round. Most of the time, one side is left as bare wood while the other side may be covered in leather or a softer material such as piano felt.

Several traditional players have used hammers that differ substantially from those in common use today. Paul Van Arsdale (1920–2018), a player from upstate New York, used flexible hammers made from hacksaw blades, with leather-covered wooden blocks attached to the ends (these were modeled after the hammers used by his grandfather, Jesse Martin). The Irish player John Rea (1915–1983) used hammers made of thick steel wire, which he made himself from old bicycle spokes wrapped with wool. Billy Bennington (1900–1986), a player from Norfolk, England, used cane hammers bound with wool.

The piano, like the dulcimer, uses a hammering action to strike the strings.

<text> (Latin, meaning &#x27;Of Human Life&#x27;) is an encyclical written by Pope Paul VI and dated 25 July 1968. The text was issued at a Vatican press conference on 29 July. Subtitled &quot;On the Regulation of Birth&quot;, it re-affirmed the teaching of the Catholic Church regarding married love, responsible parenthood, and the rejection of artificial contraception. In formulating his teaching he explained why he did not accept the conclusions of the Pontifical Commission on Birth Control established by his predecessor, Pope John XXIII, a commission he himself had expanded.

Mainly because of its restatement of the Church&#x27;s opposition to artificial contraception, the encyclical was politically controversial. It affirmed traditional Church moral teaching on the sanctity of life and the procreative and unitive nature of conjugal relations.

It was the last of Paul&#x27;s seven encyclicals.

==Summary==

===Affirmation of traditional teaching===
In this encyclical Paul VI reaffirmed the Catholic Church&#x27;s view of marriage and marital relations and a continued condemnation of &quot;artificial&quot; birth control. Referencing two Papal committees and numerous independent experts examining new developments in artificial birth control, Paul VI built on the teachings of his predecessors, especially Pius XI, Pius XII and John XXIII, all of whom had insisted on the divine obligations of the marital partners in light of their partnership with God the creator.

===Doctrinal basis===

Paul VI himself, even as commission members issued their personal views over the years, always reaffirmed the teachings of the Church, repeating them more than once in the first years of his Pontificate.

To Pope Paul VI, marital relations were much more than a union of two people. In his view, they constitute a union of the loving couple with a loving God, in which the two persons generate the matter for the body, while God creates the unique soul of a person. For this reason, Paul VI teaches in the first sentence of , that the &quot;transmission of human life is a most serious role in which married people collaborate freely and responsibly with God the Creator.&quot; This is divine partnership, so Paul VI does not allow for arbitrary human decisions, which may limit divine providence. According to Paul VI, marital relations are a source of great joy, but also of difficulties and hardships. The question of human procreation with God, exceeds in the view of Paul VI specific disciplines such as biology, psychology, demography or sociology. According to Paul VI, married love takes its origin from God, who is love, and from this basic dignity, he defines his position:

The encyclical opens with an assertion of the competency of the magisterium of the Catholic Church to decide questions of morality. It then goes on to observe that circumstances often dictate that married couples should limit the number of children, and that the sexual act between husband and wife is still worthy even if it can be foreseen not to result in procreation. Nevertheless, it is held that the sexual act must retain its intrinsic relationship to the procreation of human life.

Every action specifically intended to prevent procreation is forbidden, except in medically necessary circumstances. Therapeutic means necessary to cure diseases are exempted, even if a foreseeable impediment to procreation should result, but only if infertility is not directly intended. This is held to directly contradict the moral order which was established by God. Abortion, even for therapeutic reasons, is absolutely forbidden, as is sterilization, even if temporary. Therapeutic means which induce infertility are allowed (e.g., hysterectomy), if they are not specifically intended to cause infertility (e.g., the uterus is cancerous, so the preservation of life is intended). If there are well grounded reasons (arising from the physical or psychological condition of husband or wife, or from external circumstances), natural family planning methods (abstaining from intercourse during certain parts of the menstrual cycle) are allowed, since they take advantage of a faculty provided by nature.

The acceptance of artificial methods of birth control is then claimed to result in several negative consequences, among them a general lowering of moral standards resulting from sex without consequences, and the danger that men may reduce women to being a mere instrument for the satisfaction of [their] own desires; finally, abuse of power by public authorities, and a false sense of autonomy.

===Appeal to natural law and conclusion===
Public authorities should oppose laws which undermine natural law; scientists should further study effective methods of natural birth control; doctors should further familiarize themselves with this teaching, in order to be able to give advice to their patients, and priests must spell out clearly and completely the Church&#x27;s teaching on marriage. The encyclical acknowledges that &quot;perhaps not everyone will easily accept this particular teaching&quot;, but that &quot;it comes as no surprise to the church that she, no less than her Divine founder is destined to be a sign of contradiction.&quot; Noted is the duty of proclaiming the entire moral law, &quot;both natural and evangelical.&quot; The encyclical also points out that the Roman Catholic Church cannot &quot;declare lawful what is in fact unlawful&quot;, because she is concerned with &quot;safeguarding the holiness of marriage, in order to guide married life to its full human and Christian perfection.&quot; This is to be the priority for his fellow bishops and priests and lay people. Paul VI predicted that future progress in social cultural and economic spheres would make marital and family life more joyful, provided God&#x27;s design for the world was faithfully followed. The encyclical closes with an appeal to observe the natural laws of the most high God. &quot;These laws must be wisely and lovingly observed.&quot;

==History==

===Origins===

There had been a long-standing general Christian prohibition on contraception and abortion, with such Church Fathers as Clement of Alexandria and Saint Augustine condemning the practices. It was not until the 1930 Lambeth Conference that the Anglican Communion allowed for contraception in limited circumstances. Mainline Protestant denominations have since removed prohibitions against artificial contraception. In a partial reaction, Pope Pius XI wrote the encyclical (&quot;On Christian Marriage&quot;) in 1930, reaffirming the Catholic Church&#x27;s belief in various traditional Christian teachings on marriage and sexuality, including the prohibition of artificial birth control even within marriage. is against contraception and regarding natural family planning allowed married couples to use their nuptial rights &quot;in the proper manner&quot; when because of either time or defects, new life could not be brought forth.

===The commission of John XXIII===

With the appearance of the first oral contraceptives in 1960, dissenters in the Church argued for a reconsideration of the Church positions. In 1963 Pope John XXIII established a commission of six European non-theologians to study questions of birth control and population. It met once in 1963 and twice in 1964. As Vatican Council II was concluding, Pope Paul VI enlarged it to fifty-eight members, including married couples, laywomen, theologians and bishops. The last document issued by the council () contained a section titled &quot;Fostering the Nobility of Marriage&quot; (1965, nos. 47–52), which discussed marriage from the personalist point of view. The &quot;duty of responsible parenthood&quot; was affirmed, but the determination of licit and illicit forms of regulating birth was reserved to Pope Paul VI. In the spring of 1966, following the close of the council, the commission held its fifth and final meeting, having been enlarged again to include sixteen bishops as an executive committee. The commission was only consultative but it submitted a report approved by a majority of 64 members to Paul VI. It proposed the approval of artificial contraception without distinction of the various means. A minority of four members opposed this report and issued a parallel report to the Pope. Arguments in the minority report, against change in the church&#x27;s teaching, were that a loosening of contraception restrictions would mean the Catholic Church would &quot;have to concede frankly that the Holy Spirit had been on the side of the Protestant churches in 1930&quot; (when was promulgated), and that &quot;it should likewise have to be admitted that for a half a century the Spirit failed to protect Pius XI, Pius XII, and a large part of the Catholic hierarchy from a very serious error.&quot;

After two more years of study and consultation, the pope issued , which removed any doubt that the Church views hormonal anti-ovulants as contraceptive. He explained why he did not accept the opinion of the majority report of the commission (1968, #6). Arguments were raised in the decades that followed that his decision has never passed the condition of &quot;reception&quot; to become church doctrine.

===Drafting of the encyclical===
In his role as Theologian of the Pontifical Household, Mario Luigi Ciappi advised Pope Paul VI during the drafting of . Ciappi, a doctoral graduate of the , the future Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, , served as professor of dogmatic theology there and was Dean of the &#x27;s Faculty of Theology from 1935 to 1955.

According to George Weigel, Paul VI named Archbishop Karol Wojtyła (later Pope John Paul II) to the commission, but Polish government authorities would not permit him to travel to Rome. Wojtyła had earlier defended the church&#x27;s position from a philosophical standpoint in his 1960 book &quot;Love and Responsibility&quot;. Wojtyła&#x27;s position was strongly considered and it was reflected in the final draft of the encyclical, although much of his language and arguments were not incorporated. Weigel attributes much of the poor reception of the encyclical to the omission of many of Wojtyła&#x27;s arguments.

In 2017, anticipating the 50th anniversary of the encyclical, four theologians led by Mgr. Gilfredo Marengo, a professor of theological anthropology at the Pontifical John Paul II Institute for Studies on Marriage and Family, launched a research project he called &quot;a work of historical-critical investigation without any aim other than reconstructing as well as possible the whole process of composing the encyclical&quot;. Using the resources of the Vatican Secret Archives and the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, they hope to detail the writing process and the interaction between the commission, publicity surrounding the commission&#x27;s work, and Paul&#x27;s own authorship.

==Reception==

===Galileo affair comparison===

Cardinal Leo Joseph Suenens, a moderator of the ecumenical council, questioned, &quot;whether moral theology took sufficient account of scientific progress, which can help determine, what is according to nature. I beg you my brothers let us avoid another Galileo affair. One is enough for the Church.&quot; In an interview in on 15 May 1969, he criticized the Pope&#x27;s decision again as frustrating the collegiality defined by the council, calling it a non-collegial or even an anti-collegial act. He was supported by Vatican II theologians such as Karl Rahner, Hans Küng, several Episcopal conferences, e.g. the Episcopal Conference of Austria, Germany, and Switzerland, as well as several bishops, including Christopher Butler, who called it one of the most important contributions to contemporary discussion in the Church.

===Open dissent===
The publication of the encyclical marks the first time in the twentieth century that open dissent from the laity about teachings of the Church was voiced widely and publicly. The teaching has been criticized by development organizations and others who claim that it limits the methods available to fight worldwide population growth and struggle against HIV/AIDS. Within two days of the encyclical&#x27;s release, a group of dissident theologians, led by Rev. Charles Curran, then Catholic University of America, issued a statement stating, &quot;spouses may responsibly decide according to their conscience that artificial contraception in some circumstances is permissible and indeed necessary to preserve and foster the value and sacredness of marriage.&quot;

===Canadian bishops===
Two months later, the controversial Winnipeg Statement issued by the Canadian Conference of Catholic Bishops stated that those who cannot accept the teaching should not be considered shut off from the Catholic Church, and that individuals can in good conscience use contraception as long as they have first made an honest attempt to accept the difficult directives of the encyclical.

===Dutch Catechism===
The Dutch Catechism of 1966, based on the Dutch bishops&#x27; interpretation of the just completed Vatican Council, and the first post-Council comprehensive Catholic catechism, noted the lack of mention of artificial contraception in the council. &quot;As everyone can ascertain nowadays, there are several methods of regulating births. The Second Vatican Council did not speak of any of these concrete methods[...] This is a different standpoint than that taken under Pius XI some thirty years ago which was also maintained by his successor[...] we can sense here a clear development in the Church, a development, which is also going on outside the Church.&quot;

===Soviet Union===
In the Soviet Union, &quot;Literaturnaya Gazeta&quot;, a publication of Soviet intellectuals, included an editorial and statement by Russian physicians against the encyclical.

===Ecumenical reactions===
Ecumenical reactions were mixed. Liberal and Moderate Lutherans and the World Council of Churches were disappointed. Eugene Carson Blake criticised the concepts of nature and natural law, which, in his view, still dominated Catholic theology, as outdated. This concern dominated several articles in Catholic and non-Catholic journals at the time. Patriarch Athenagoras I stated his full agreement with Pope Paul VI: &quot;He could not have spoken in any other way.&quot;

===Latin America===
In Latin America, much support developed for the Pope and his encyclical. As World Bank President Robert McNamara declared at the 1968 Annual Meeting of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank Group that countries permitting birth control practices will get preferential access to resources, doctors in La Paz, Bolivia, called it insulting that money should be exchanged for the conscience of a Catholic nation. In Colombia, Cardinal Aníbal Muñoz Duque declared, &quot;if American conditionality undermines Papal teachings, we prefer not to receive one cent&quot;. The Senate of Bolivia passed a resolution, stating that can be discussed in its implications on individual consciences, but is of greatest significance because it defends the rights of developing nations to determine their own population policies. The Jesuit Journal &quot;Sic&quot; dedicated one edition to the encyclical with supportive contributions. However, against eighteen insubordinate priests, professors of theology at Pontifical Catholic University of Chile, and the ensuing conspiracy of silence practiced by the Chilean Episcopate, which had to be censured by the Nuncio in Santiago at the behest of Cardinal Gabriel-Marie Garrone, prefect of the Congregation for Catholic Education, triggering eventually a media conflict with , Plinio Corrêa de Oliveira expressed his affliction with the lamentations of Jeremiah: &quot;O ye all that pass through the way…&quot; (Lamentations 1:12, King James Bible).

===Cardinal Martini===
In the book &quot;Nighttime conversations in Jerusalem. On the risk of faith.&quot;, well-known liberal Cardinal Carlo Maria Martini accused Paul VI of deliberately concealing the truth, leaving it to theologians and pastors to fix things by adapting precepts to practice: &quot;I knew Paul VI well. With the encyclical, he wanted to express consideration for human life. He explained his intention to some of his friends by using a comparison: although one must not lie, sometimes it is not possible to do otherwise; it may be necessary to conceal the truth, or it may be unavoidable to tell a lie. It is up to the moralists to explain where sin begins, especially in the cases in which there is a higher duty than the transmission of life.&quot;

=== Karol Wojtyła ===
The future Pope John Paul II (at the time Archbishop of Krakow Karol Wojtyła) asked Paul VI to apply Papal infallibility &quot;in docendo&quot; (in teaching) to the encyclical, equating it with the authority of a dogma. Paul VI and John XXIII did not. Wojtyła himself declared the encyclical part of the ordinary and universal Magisterium of the Roman Catholic Church.

===Response of Pope Paul VI===
Pope Paul VI was troubled by the encyclical&#x27;s reception in the West. Acknowledging the controversy, Paul VI in a letter to the Congress of German Catholics (30 August 1968), stated: &quot;May the lively debate aroused by our encyclical lead to a better knowledge of God&#x27;s will.&quot; In March 1969, he had a meeting with one of the main critics of , Cardinal Leo Joseph Suenens. Paul heard him out and said merely, &quot;Yes, pray for me; because of my weaknesses, the Church is badly governed.&quot; To jog the memory of his critics, he also put in their minds the experience of no less a figure than Peter: &quot;[n]ow I understand St Peter: he came to Rome twice, the second time to be crucified&quot;, – herewith directing their attention to his rejoicing in glorifying the Lord. Increasingly convinced, that &quot;the smoke of Satan entered the temple of God from some fissure&quot;, Paul VI reaffirmed, on 23 June 1978, weeks before his death, in an address to the College of Cardinals, his : &quot;following the confirmations of serious science&quot;, and which sought to affirm the principle of respect for the laws of nature and of &quot;a conscious and ethically responsible paternity&quot;.

=== Padre Pio ===
In his last letter to Pope Paul VI, Christian mystic and canonized saint Padre Pio called &quot;clear and decisive words&quot;.

==Legacy==
Polls have shown that many self-identified Catholics use artificial means of contraception, and that very few use natural family planning. However, John L. Allen Jr. wrote in 2008: &quot;Three decades of bishops&#x27; appointments by John Paul II and Benedict XVI, both unambiguously committed to , mean that senior leaders in Catholicism these days are far less inclined than they were in 1968 to distance themselves from the ban on birth control, or to soft-pedal it. Some Catholic bishops have brought out documents of their own defending .&quot; Developments in fertility awareness since the 1960s have also given rise to natural family planning organizations such as the Billings Ovulation Method, Couple to Couple League and the Creighton Model FertilityCare System, which actively provide formal instruction on the use and reliability of natural methods of birth control.

===Pope John Paul I===
Albino Luciani&#x27;s views on have been debated. Journalist John L. Allen Jr. claims that &quot;it&#x27;s virtually certain that John Paul I would not have reversed Paul VI&#x27;s teaching, particularly since he was no doctrinal radical. Moreover, as Patriarch in Venice some had seen a hardening of his stance on social issues as the years went by.&quot; According to Allen, &quot;it is reasonable to assume that John Paul I would not have insisted upon the negative judgment in as aggressively and publicly as John Paul II did, and probably would not have treated it as a quasi-infallible teaching. It would have remained a more &#x27;open&#x27; question&quot;. Other sources take a different view and note that during his time as Patriarch of Venice that &quot;Luciani was intransigent with his upholding of the teaching of the Church and severe with those, through intellectual pride and disobedience paid no attention to the Church&#x27;s prohibition of contraception&quot;, though while not condoning the sin, he was tolerant of those who sincerely tried and failed to live up to the Church&#x27;s teaching. Raymond and Lauretta&#x27;s book &quot;The Smiling Pope, The Life &amp; Teaching of John Paul I&quot; states that &quot;if some people think that his compassion and gentleness in this respect implies he was against one can only infer it was wishful thinking on their part and an attempt to find an ally in favor of artificial contraception.&quot;

===Pope John Paul II===

After he became pope in 1978, John Paul II continued on the Catholic Theology of the Body of his predecessors with a series of lectures, entitled &quot;Theology of the Body&quot;, in which he talked about an &quot;original unity between man and women&quot;, purity of heart (on the Sermon on the Mount), marriage and celibacy and reflections on , focusing largely on responsible parenthood and marital chastity.

In 1981, the Pope&#x27;s Apostolic exhortation, , restated the Church&#x27;s opposition to artificial birth control stated previously in .

John Paul II readdressed some of the same issues in his 1993 encyclical . He reaffirmed much of , and specifically described the practice of artificial contraception as an act not permitted by Catholic teaching in any circumstances. The same encyclical also clarifies the use of conscience in arriving at moral decisions, including in the use of contraception. However, John Paul also said, &quot;It is not right then to regard the moral conscience of the individual and the magisterium of the Church as two contenders, as two realities in conflict. The authority which the magisterium enjoys by the will of Christ exists so that the moral conscience can attain the truth with security and remain in it.&quot; John Paul quoted as a compassionate encyclical, &quot;Christ has come not to judge the world but to save it, and while he was uncompromisingly stern towards sin, he was patient and rich in mercy towards sinners&quot;.

Pope John Paul&#x27;s 1995 encyclical (&#x27;The Gospel of Life&#x27;) affirmed the Church&#x27;s position on contraception and multiple topics related to the culture of life.

===Pope Benedict XVI===
On 12 May 2008, Benedict XVI accepted an invitation to talk to participants in the International Congress organized by the Pontifical Lateran University on the 40th anniversary of . He put the encyclical in the broader view of love in a global context, a topic he called &quot;so controversial, yet so crucial for humanity&#x27;s future.&quot; became &quot;a sign of contradiction but also of continuity of the Church&#x27;s doctrine and tradition... What was true yesterday is true also today.&quot; The Church continues to reflect &quot;in an ever new and deeper way on the fundamental principles that concern marriage and procreation.&quot; The key message of is love. Benedict states, that the fullness of a person is achieved by a unity of soul and body, but neither spirit nor body alone can love, only the two together. If this unity is broken, if only the body is satisfied, love becomes a commodity.

===Pope Francis===

On 16 January 2015, Pope Francis said to a meeting with families in Manila, insisting on the need to protect the family: &quot;The family is[...] threatened by growing efforts on the part of some to redefine the very institution of marriage, by relativism, by the culture of the ephemeral, by a lack of openness to life. I think of Blessed Paul VI. At a time when the problem of population growth was being raised, he had the courage to defend openness to life in families. He knew the difficulties that are there in every family, and so in his Encyclical he was very merciful towards particular cases, and he asked confessors to be very merciful and understanding in dealing with particular cases. But he also had a broader vision: he looked at the peoples of the earth and he saw this threat of the destruction of the family through the privation of children [original Spanish: ]. Paul VI was courageous; he was a good pastor and he warned his flock of the wolves who were coming.&quot;

A year before, on 1 May 2014, Pope Francis, in an interview given to Italian newspaper , expressed his opinion and praise for : &quot;Everything depends on how is interpreted. Paul VI himself, in the end, urged confessors to be very merciful and pay attention to concrete situations. But his genius was prophetic, he had the courage to take a stand against the majority, to defend moral discipline, to exercise a cultural restraint, to oppose present and future neo-Malthusianism. The question is not of changing doctrine, but of digging deep and making sure that pastoral care takes into account situations and what it is possible for persons to do.&quot;

<text>Wikipedia, a free-content online encyclopedia written and maintained by a community of volunteers known as Wikipedians, began with its first edit on 15 January 2001, two days after the domain was registered. It grew out of Nupedia, a more structured free encyclopedia, as a way to allow easier and faster drafting of articles and translations.

The technological and conceptual underpinnings of Wikipedia predate this; the earliest known proposal for an online encyclopedia was made by Rick Gates in 1993, and the concept of a free-as-in-freedom online encyclopedia (as distinct from mere open source) was proposed by Richard Stallman in 1998.

Stallman&#x27;s concept specifically included the idea that no central organization should control editing. This contrasted with contemporary digital encyclopedias such as Microsoft Encarta and &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica.&quot; In 2001, the license for Nupedia was changed to GFDL, and Jimmy Wales and Larry Sanger launched Wikipedia as a complementary project, using an online wiki as a collaborative drafting tool.

While Wikipedia was initially imagined as a place to draft articles and ideas for eventual polishing in Nupedia, it quickly overtook its predecessor, becoming both draft space and home for the polished final product of a global project in hundreds of languages, inspiring a wide range of other online reference projects.

In 2014, Wikipedia had approximately 495 million monthly readers. In 2015, according to comScore, Wikipedia received over 115 million monthly unique visitors from the United States alone. In September 2018, the projects saw 15.5 billion monthly page views.

==Historical overview==
===Background===
The concept of compiling the world&#x27;s knowledge in a single location dates back to the ancient Library of Alexandria and Library of Pergamum, but the modern concept of a general-purpose, widely distributed, printed encyclopedia originated with Denis Diderot and the 18th-century French encyclopedists. The idea of using automated machinery beyond the printing press to build a more useful encyclopedia can be traced to Paul Otlet&#x27;s 1934 book &quot;Traité de Documentation&quot;. Otlet also founded the Mundaneum, an institution dedicated to indexing the world&#x27;s knowledge, in 1910. This concept of a machine-assisted encyclopedia was further expanded in H. G. Wells&#x27; book of essays &quot;World Brain&quot; (1938) and Vannevar Bush&#x27;s future vision of the microfilm-based Memex in his essay &quot;As We May Think&quot; (1945). Another milestone was Ted Nelson&#x27;s hypertext design Project Xanadu, which began in 1960.

The use of volunteers was integral in making and maintaining Wikipedia. However, even without the internet, huge complex projects of similar nature had made use of volunteers. Specifically, the creation of the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; was conceived with the speech at the London Library, on Guy Fawkes Day, 5 November 1857, by Richard Chenevix Trench. It took about 70 years to complete. Dr. Trench envisioned a grand new dictionary of every word in the English language, and to be used democratically and freely. According to author Simon Winchester, &quot;The undertaking of the scheme, he said, was beyond the ability of any one man. To peruse all of English literatureand to comb the London and New York newspapers and the most literate of the magazines and journalsmust be instead &#x27;the combined action of many.&#x27; It would be necessary to recruit a teammoreover, a huge oneprobably comprising hundreds and hundreds of unpaid amateurs, all of them working as volunteers.&quot;

Advances in information technology in the late 20th century led to changes in the form of encyclopedias. While previous encyclopedias, notably the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot;, were often book-based, Microsoft&#x27;s Encarta, published in 1993, was available on CD-ROM and hyperlinked. The development of the World Wide Web led to many attempts to develop internet encyclopedia projects. An early proposal for an online encyclopedia was Interpedia in 1993 by Rick Gates; this project died before generating any encyclopedic content. Free software proponent Richard Stallman described the usefulness of a &quot;Free Universal Encyclopedia and Learning Resource&quot; in 1998. His published document outlined how to &quot;ensure that progress continues towards this best and most natural outcome.&quot;

Wikipedia co-founder Jimmy Wales said that the concept of Wikipedia came when he was a graduate student at Indiana University, where he was impressed with the successes of the open-source movement and found Richard Stallman&#x27;s Emacs Manifesto promoting free software and a sharing economy interesting. Wales also credits Austrian School economist Friedrich Hayek&#x27;s essay, &quot;The Use of Knowledge in Society,&quot; which he read as an undergraduate, as &quot;central&quot; to his thinking about &quot;how to manage the Wikipedia project.&quot; The essay asserts that information is decentralized—that each individual only knows a small fraction of what is known collectively—and that as a result, decisions are best made by those with local knowledge, rather than by a central authority. At the time, Wales was studying finance and was intrigued by the incentives of the many people who contributed as volunteers toward creating free software, where many examples were having excellent results. According to &quot;The Economist&quot;, Wikipedia &quot;has its roots in the techno-optimism that characterised the internet at the end of the 20th century. It held that ordinary people could use their computers as tools for liberation, education, and enlightenment.&quot;

===Formulation of the concept===
Wikipedia was initially conceived as a feeder project for the Wales-founded Nupedia, an earlier project to produce a free online encyclopedia, volunteered by Bomis, a web-advertising firm owned by Jimmy Wales, Tim Shell and Michael E. Davis. Nupedia was founded upon the use of qualified volunteer contributors and a considered multi-step peer review process. Despite its mailing list of over 2000 interested editors, and the presence of Sanger as full-time editor-in-chief, the production of content for Nupedia was extremely slow, with only 12 articles written during the first year.

The Nupedians discussed various ways to create content more rapidly. Wikis had been used elsewhere on the web to organize knowledge, and the idea of a wiki-based complement to Nupedia was seeded by a conversation between Sanger and Ben Kovitz, and by another between Wales and Jeremy Rosenfeld. Kovitz was a computer programmer and regular on Ward Cunningham&#x27;s revolutionary wiki &quot;the WikiWikiWeb&quot;. He explained to Sanger what wikis were, over a dinner on 2 January 2001. Wales stated in October 2001 that &quot;Larry had the idea to use Wiki software&quot; for people bored by Nupedia process, and later stated in December 2005 that Rosenfeld had introduced him to the wiki concept. Sanger thought a wiki would be a good platform to use, and proposed on the Nupedia mailing list that a wiki based upon UseModWiki (then v. 0.90) be set up as a &quot;feeder&quot; project for Nupedia. Under the subject &quot;Let&#x27;s make a wiki&quot;, he wrote:
Wales set one up and put it online on Wednesday 10 January 2001, under the nupedia.com domain. This moved to a new wiki under the wikipedia.com domain on 15 January. On 17 January, the Free Software Foundation&#x27;s (FSF) GNUPedia project went online, potentially competing with Nupedia, but within a few years the FSF encouraged people &quot;to visit and contribute to [Wikipedia]&quot; instead.

===Founding of Wikipedia===

There was some hesitation among editors about binding Nupedia too closely to a wiki-style workflow. After a Nupedia wiki was launched under on 10 January 2001, Wales proposed launching the new project under its own name, and Sanger proposed &quot;Wikipedia&quot;, framing it as &quot;a supplementary project to Nupedia which operates entirely independently.&quot; A new wiki was launched at on Monday 15 January 2001. The bandwidth and server (located in San Diego) used for these initial projects were donated by Bomis. Many former Bomis employees later contributed content to the encyclopedia: notably Tim Shell, co-founder and later CEO of Bomis, and programmer Jason Richey.

Wales stated in December 2008 that he made Wikipedia&#x27;s first edit, a test edit with the text &quot;Hello, World!&quot;, but this may have been to an old version of Wikipedia which soon after was scrapped and replaced by a restart. The first recovered edit to Wikipedia.com was to the HomePage on 15 January 2001, reading &quot;This is the new WikiPedia!&quot;; it can be found . The existence of the project was formally announced and an appeal for volunteers to engage in content creation was made to the Nupedia mailing list on 17 January 2001.

The project received many new participants after being mentioned on the Slashdot website in July 2001, having already earned two minor mentions in March 2001. It then received a prominent pointer to a story on the community-edited technology and culture website Kuro5hin on 25 July. Between these influxes of traffic, there had been a steady stream of traffic from other sources, especially Google, which alone sent hundreds of new visitors to the site every day. Its first major mainstream media coverage was in &quot;The New York Times&quot; on 20 September 2001.

=== Divisions and internationalization ===
Early in Wikipedia&#x27;s development, it began to expand internationally, with the creation of new namespaces, each with a distinct set of usernames. The first subdomain created for a non-English Wikipedia was (created on Friday 16 March 2001, 01:38 UTC), followed after a few hours by (at 13:07 UTC). The Japanese Wikipedia, started as , was created around that period, and initially used only Romanized Japanese. For about two months Catalan was the one with the most articles in a non-English language, although statistics of that early period are imprecise.

The French Wikipedia was created on or around 11 May 2001, in a wave of new language versions that also included Chinese, Dutch, Esperanto, Hebrew, Italian, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, and Swedish. These languages were soon joined by Arabic and Hungarian. In September 2001, an announcement pledged commitment to the multilingual provision of Wikipedia, notifying users of an upcoming roll-out of Wikipedias for all major languages, the establishment of core standards, and a push for the translation of core pages for the new wikis. At the end of that year, when international statistics first began to be logged, Afrikaans, Norwegian, and Serbian versions were announced.

In January 2002, 90% of all Wikipedia articles were in English. By January 2004, fewer than 50% were English, and this internationalization has continued to increase as the encyclopedia grows. , about 85% of all Wikipedia articles were in non-English Wikipedia versions. , the English and Simple English Wikipedias have 7 million articles between them, but roughly 90% of articles were in non-English Wikipedias.

===Development of Wikipedia===

In March 2002, following the withdrawal of funding by Bomis during the dot-com bust, Sanger left both Nupedia and Wikipedia. By 2002, he and Wales differed in their views on how best to manage open encyclopedias. Both still supported the open-collaboration concept, but they disagreed on how to handle disruptive editors, specific roles for experts, and the best way to guide the project to success.

Wales went on to establish self-governance and bottom-up self-direction by editors on Wikipedia. He made it clear that he would not be involved in the community&#x27;s day-to-day management, but would encourage it to learn to self-manage and find its own best approaches. , Wales mostly restricted his role to occasional input on serious matters, executive activity, advocacy of knowledge, and encouragement of similar reference projects.

Sanger said he is an &quot;inclusionist&quot; and is open to almost anything, and proposed that experts still have a place in the Web 2.0 world. In 2006 he founded Citizendium, an open encyclopedia that used real names for contributors to reduce disruptive editing, and hoped to facilitate &quot;gentle expert guidance&quot; to increase the accuracy of its content. Decisions about article content were to be up to the community, but the site was to include a statement about &quot;family-friendly content&quot;.

=== Past content of Wikipedia ===
Old, even obsolete, encyclopedia articles are highly valuable for historical research. For each Wikipedia article, past versions are accessible through the &quot;View history&quot; link at the top of the page. The full version history of all Wikipedia articles is also available for download as , in the form of compressed XML files.

In addition, the ZIM File Archive, at Internet Archive, contains past full snapshots of Wikipedia as well as article selections, in multiple languages, from different years. They can be opened with Kiwix software. Between 2007 and 2011, three CD/DVD versions (called Wikipedia Version , and ) containing a selection of articles from English Wikipedia were released. They became available as Kiwix ZIM files, both from the ZIM File Archive and from the Kiwix download site.
===Evolution of logo===
==Timeline==
===First decade: 2000–2009===
====2000====

In March 2000, the Nupedia project was started. Its intention was to publish articles written by experts which would be licensed as free content. Nupedia was founded by Wales, with Sanger as editor-in-chief, and funded by the web-advertising company Bomis.

====2001====
In January 2001, Wikipedia began as a side-project of Nupedia, to allow collaboration on articles prior to entering the peer-review process. The name was suggested by Sanger on 11 January 2001 as a portmanteau of the words &quot;wiki&quot; (Hawaiian for &quot;quick&quot;) and &quot;encyclopedia&quot;. The &quot;wikipedia.com&quot; and &quot;wikipedia.org&quot; domain names were registered on 12 and 13 January, respectively, with &quot;wikipedia.org&quot; being brought online on the same day. The project formally opened on 15 January (&quot;&quot;), with the first international Wikipedias – the French, German, Catalan, Swedish, and Italian editions – being created between March and May. The &quot;neutral point of view&quot; () policy was officially formulated at this time, and Wikipedia&#x27;s first slashdotter wave arrived on 26 July. The first media report about Wikipedia appeared in August 2001 in the newspaper &quot;Wales on Sunday&quot;.

The September 11 attacks spurred the appearance of breaking news stories on the homepage, as well as information boxes linking related articles. At the time, approximately 100 articles related to 9/11 had been created. After the September 11 attacks, a link to the Wikipedia article on the attacks appeared on Yahoo!&#x27;s home page, resulting in a spike in traffic.

====2002====
2002 saw the reduction of funding for Wikipedia from Bomis and the departure of Sanger. A fork of the Spanish Wikipedia took place, with the establishment of the &quot;Enciclopedia Libre&quot;. Jimmy Wales confirmed that Wikipedia would never run commercial advertising. The first portable MediaWiki software went live on 25 January. Bots were introduced. The first sister project (Wiktionary) and first formal Manual of Style were launched. Close to 200 contributors were editing Wikipedia daily.

====2003====

The English Wikipedia passed 100,000 articles in 2003, while the next largest edition, the German Wikipedia, passed 10,000. The Wikimedia Foundation was established. Wikipedia adopted its jigsaw world logo. Mathematical formulae using TeX were reintroduced to the website. The first Wikipedian social meeting took place in Munich, Germany, in October. The basic principles of English Wikipedia&#x27;s (&quot;ArbCom&quot;) were developed. Wikisource was created as a separate project on 24 November 2003, to host free textual sources as its aim in multiple languages and translations.

====2004====
The worldwide Wikipedia article pool continued to grow rapidly in 2004, doubling in size in 12 months, from under 500,000 articles in late 2003 to over 1 million in over 100 languages by the end of 2004. The English Wikipedia accounted for just under half of these articles. The website&#x27;s server farms were moved from California to Florida. and CSS style configuration sheets were introduced. The first attempt to block Wikipedia occurred, with the website being blocked in China for two weeks in June. Formal elections began for a board for the Foundation, and an Arbitration Committee on English Wikipedia. The first national chapter of the Foundation, Wikimedia Deutschland, was recognized. The first social meeting in the United States took place in Boston, . Wikimedia Commons was created on 7 September 2004 to host media files for Wikipedia in all languages.

&quot;Bourgeois v. Peters&quot;, (11th Cir. 2004), a court case decided by the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit was one of the earliest court opinions to cite and quote Wikipedia. It stated: &quot;We also reject the notion that the Department of Homeland Security&#x27;s threat advisory level somehow justifies these searches. Although the threat level was &#x27;elevated&#x27; at the time of the protest, &#x27;to date, the threat level has stood at yellow (elevated) for the majority of its time in existence. It has been raised to orange (high) six times.&quot;

====2005====
In 2005, Wikipedia became the most popular reference website on the Internet, according to Hitwise, with English Wikipedia alone exceeding 750,000 articles. Wikipedia&#x27;s first multilingual and subject portals were established in 2005. A formal fundraiser held in the first quarter of the year raised almost US$100,000 for system upgrades to handle growing demand. China again blocked Wikipedia in October 2005.

The first major Wikipedia scandal, the Seigenthaler incident, occurred in 2005 when a well-known figure was found to have a vandalized biography that had gone unnoticed for months. In the wake of this and other concerns, the first policy and system changes specifically designed to counter this form of abuse were established. These included a new privilege policy update to assist in sock puppetry investigations, a new feature called , a more strict policy on biographies of living people and the tagging of such articles for stricter review. A restriction of new article creation to registered users only was put in place in December 2005. Wikimania 2005, the first Wikimania conference, was held from 4 to 8 August 2005 at the &quot;Haus der Jugend&quot; in Frankfurt, attracting about 380 attendees.

====2006====
The English Wikipedia gained its one-millionth article, Jordanhill railway station, on 1 March 2006. The first approved Wikipedia article selection was made freely available to download, and &quot;Wikipedia&quot; became registered as a trademark of the Wikimedia Foundation. The congressional aides biography scandals – multiple incidents in which congressional staffers and a campaign manager were caught trying to covertly alter Wikipedia biographies – came to public attention, leading to the resignation of the campaign manager. Nonetheless, Wikipedia was rated as one of the top five global brands of 2006.

Jimmy Wales indicated at Wikimania 2006 that Wikipedia had achieved sufficient volume and called for an emphasis on quality, perhaps best expressed in the call for . A new privilege, &quot;oversight&quot;, was created, allowing specific versions of archived pages with unacceptable content to be marked as non-viewable. Semi-protection against anonymous vandalism, introduced in 2005, proved more popular than expected, with over 1,000 pages being semi-protected at any given time in 2006.

====2007====
Wikipedia continued to grow rapidly in 2007, possessing over 5 million registered editor accounts by 13 August. The 250 language editions of Wikipedia contained a combined total of 7.5 million articles, totalling 1.74 billion words, by 13 August. The English Wikipedia gained articles at a steady rate of 1,700 a day, with the wikipedia.org domain name ranked the 10th-busiest in the world. Wikipedia continued to garner visibility in the press – the Essjay controversy broke out when a prominent member of Wikipedia was found to have lied about his credentials. Citizendium, a competing online encyclopedia, launched publicly. A new trend developed in Wikipedia, with the encyclopedia addressing people whose notability stemmed from being a participant in a news story by adding a redirect from their name to the larger story, rather than creating a distinct biographical article.

On 9 September 2007, the English Wikipedia gained its two-millionth article, &quot;El Hormiguero&quot;. There was some controversy in late 2007 when the Volapük Wikipedia jumped from 797 to over 112,000 articles, briefly becoming the 15th-largest Wikipedia edition, due to automated stub generation by an enthusiast for the Volapük constructed language. According to the &quot;MIT Technology Review&quot;, the number of regularly active editors on the English-language Wikipedia peaked in 2007 at more than 51,000, and has since been declining. In April 2007, Wikipedia Version 0.5 article selection release was published.

====2008====
Various in many areas continued to expand and refine article contents within their scope. In April 2008, the 10-millionth Wikipedia article was created, and by the end of the year the English Wikipedia exceeded 2.5 million articles.

====2009====
On 25 June 2009 at 22:15 UTC, following the death of Michael Jackson, the website temporarily crashed. The Wikimedia Foundation reported nearly a million visitors to Jackson&#x27;s biography within one hour, probably the most visitors in a one-hour period to any article in Wikipedia&#x27;s history. By late August 2009, the number of articles in all Wikipedia editions had exceeded 14 million. The three-millionth article on the English Wikipedia, Beate Eriksen, was created on 17 August 2009 at 04:05 UTC. On 27 December 2009, the German Wikipedia exceeded one million articles, becoming the second edition after the English Wikipedia to do so. A &quot;TIME&quot; article listed Wikipedia among 2009&#x27;s best websites. Wikipedia content became licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike license in 2009.

===Second decade: 2010–2019===
====2010====
On 24 March, the European Wikipedia servers went offline due to an overheating problem. Failover to servers in Florida turned out to be broken, causing DNS resolution for Wikipedia to fail across the world. The problem was resolved quickly, but due to DNS caching effects, some areas were slower to regain access to Wikipedia than others.

On 13 May, the site released a new interface. New features included an updated logo, new navigation tools, and a link wizard. However, the classic interface remained available for those who wished to use it. On 12 December, the English Wikipedia passed the 3.5-million-article mark, while the French Wikipedia&#x27;s millionth article was created on 21 September. The 1-billionth Wikimedia project edit was performed on 16 April. In early 2010, Wikipedia Version 0.7 article selection release was published.

====2011====
Wikipedia and its users held many celebrations worldwide to commemorate the site&#x27;s 10th anniversary on 15 January. The site began efforts to expand its growth in India, holding its first Indian conference in Mumbai in November 2011. The English Wikipedia passed the 3.6-million-article mark on 2 April, and reached 3.8 million articles on 18 November. On 7 November 2011, the German Wikipedia exceeded 100 million page edits, becoming the second language edition to do so after the English edition, which attained 500 million page edits on 24 November 2011. The Dutch Wikipedia exceeded 1 million articles on 17 December 2011, becoming the fourth Wikipedia edition to do so.

On 3 March 2011, Wikipedia Version 0.8 article selection release was published. The &quot;Wikimania 2011 – Haifa, Israel&quot; stamp was issued by Israel Post on 2 August 2011. This was the first-ever stamp dedicated to a Wikimedia-related project. Between 4 and 6 October 2011, the Italian Wikipedia became intentionally inaccessible in protest against the Italian Parliament&#x27;s proposed DDL intercettazioni law, which, if approved, would allow any person to force websites to remove information that is perceived as untrue or offensive, without the need to provide evidence. Also in October 2011, Wikimedia announced the launch of Wikipedia Zero, an initiative to enable free mobile access to Wikipedia in developing countries through partnerships with mobile operators.

====2012====

On 16 January, Wikipedia co-founder Jimmy Wales announced that the English Wikipedia would shut down for 24 hours on 18 January as part of a protest meant to call public attention to the proposed Stop Online Piracy Act and PROTECT IP Act, two anti-piracy laws under debate in the United States Congress. Calling the blackout a &quot;community decision&quot;, Wales and other opponents of the laws believed that they would endanger free speech and online innovation. A similar blackout was staged on 10 July by the Russian Wikipedia, in protest against a proposed Russian internet regulation law.

In late March 2012, the announced Wikidata, a universal platform for sharing data between all Wikipedia language editions. The US$1.7-million Wikidata project was partly funded by Google, the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, and the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence. Wikimedia Deutschland assumed responsibility for the first phase of Wikidata, and initially planned to make the platform available to editors by December 2012. Wikidata&#x27;s first phase became fully operational in March 2013.
In April 2012, Justin Knapp became the first single contributor to make over one million edits to Wikipedia. Jimmy Wales congratulated Knapp for his work and presented him with the site&#x27;s &quot;Special Barnstar&quot; medal and the &quot;Golden Wiki&quot; award for his achievement. Wales also declared that 20 April would be &quot;Justin Knapp Day&quot;.

On 13 July 2012, the English Wikipedia gained its 4-millionth article, Izbat al-Burj. In October 2012, historian and Wikipedia editor Richard J. Jensen opined that the English Wikipedia was &quot;nearing completion&quot;, noting that the number of regularly active editors had fallen significantly since 2007, despite Wikipedia&#x27;s rapid growth in article count and readership. According to Alexa Internet, Wikipedia was the world&#x27;s sixth-most-popular website as of November 2012. Dow Jones ranked Wikipedia fifth worldwide as of December 2012.

====2013====
On 22 January 2013, the Italian Wikipedia became the fifth language edition of Wikipedia to exceed 1 million articles, while the Russian and Spanish Wikipedias gained their millionth articles on 11 and 16 May respectively. On 15 July the Swedish and on 24 September the Polish Wikipedias gained their millionth articles, becoming the eighth and ninth Wikipedia editions to do so. On 27 January, the main belt asteroid 274301 was officially renamed &quot;Wikipedia&quot; by the Committee for Small Body Nomenclature.

The first phase of the Wikidata database, automatically providing interlanguage links and other data, became available for all language editions in March 2013. In April 2013, the French secret service was accused of attempting to censor Wikipedia by threatening a Wikipedia volunteer with arrest unless &quot;classified information&quot; about a military radio station was deleted.
In July, the VisualEditor editing system was launched, forming the first stage of an effort to allow articles to be edited with a word processor-like interface instead of using wiki markup. An editor specifically designed for smartphones and other mobile devices was also launched.

====2014====

In February 2014, a project to make a print edition of the English Wikipedia, consisting of 1,000 volumes and over 1,100,000 pages, was launched by German Wikipedia contributors. The project sought funding through Indiegogo, and was intended to honor the contributions of Wikipedia&#x27;s editors. On 22 October 2014, the first monument to Wikipedia was unveiled in the Polish town of Slubice.

On 8 June, 15 June, and 16 July 2014, the Waray Wikipedia, the Vietnamese Wikipedia and the Cebuano Wikipedia each exceeded the one million article mark. They were the tenth, eleventh and twelfth Wikipedias to reach that milestone. Despite having very few active users, the Waray and Cebuano Wikipedias had a high number of automatically generated articles created by bots.

====2015====

In mid-2015, Wikipedia was the world&#x27;s seventh-most-popular website according to Alexa Internet, down one place from the position it held in November 2012. At the start of 2015, Wikipedia remained the largest general-knowledge encyclopedia online, with a combined total of over 36 million mainspace articles across all 291 language editions. On average, Wikipedia receives a total of 10 billion global pageviews from around 495 million unique visitors every month, including 85 million visitors from the United States alone, where it is the sixth-most-popular site.
&quot;Print Wikipedia&quot; was an art project by Michael Mandiberg that created the ability to print 7473 volumes of Wikipedia as it existed on 7 April 2015. Each volume has 700 pages and only 110 were printed by the artist. On 1 November 2015, the English Wikipedia reached 5,000,000 articles with the creation of an article on &quot;Persoonia terminalis&quot;, a type of shrub.

====2016====
On 19 January 2016, the Japanese Wikipedia exceeded the one million article mark, becoming the thirteenth Wikipedia to reach that milestone. The millionth article was of Wave 224, a World War II submarine of the Imperial Japanese Navy. In mid-2016, Wikipedia was once again the world&#x27;s sixth-most-popular website according to Alexa Internet, up one place from the position it held in the previous year.

====2017====
In mid-2017, Wikipedia was listed as the world&#x27;s fifth-most-popular website according to Alexa Internet, rising one place from the position it held in the previous year. Wikipedia Zero was made available in Iraq and Afghanistan. On 29 April 2017, online access to Wikipedia was blocked across all language editions in Turkey by the Turkish authorities. This block lasted until 15 January 2020, as the court of Turkey ruled that the block violated human rights. The encrypted Japanese Wikipedia has been blocked in China since 28 December 2017.

====2018====
On 13 April 2018, the number of Chinese Wikipedia articles exceeded 1 million, becoming the fourteenth Wikipedia to reach that milestone. The Chinese Wikipedia has been blocked in Mainland China since May 2015. Later in the year, on 26 June, the Portuguese Wikipedia exceeded the one million article mark, becoming the fifteenth Wikipedia to reach that milestone. The millionth article was &quot;Perdão de Richard Nixon&quot; (the Pardon of Richard Nixon). During 2018, Wikipedia retained its listing as the world&#x27;s fifth-most-popular website according to Alexa Internet. One notable development was the use of Artificial Intelligence to create draft articles on overlooked topics.

====2019====
On 23 April 2019, Chinese authorities expanded the block of Wikipedia to versions in all languages. The timing of the block coincided with the 30th anniversary of the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and massacre and the 100th anniversary of the May Fourth Movement, resulting in stricter internet censorship in China. In August 2019, according to Alexa.com, Wikipedia fell from fifth-placed to seventh-placed website in the world for global internet engagement.

===Third decade: 2020–present===
====2020====

On 23 January 2020, the six millionth article, the biography of Maria Elise Turner Lauder, was added to the English Wikipedia. Despite this growth in articles, Wikipedia&#x27;s global internet engagement, as measured by Alexa, continued to decline. By February 2020, Wikipedia fell to the eleventh-placed website in the world for global internet engagement. Both Wikipedia&#x27;s coverage of the COVID-19 pandemic crisis and the supporting edits, discussions, and even deletions were thought to be a useful resource for future historians seeking to understand the period in detail. The World Health Organization collaborated with Wikipedia as a key resource for the dissemination of COVID-19-related information as to help combat the spread of misinformation.

====2021====
In January 2021, was noted in the media. On 13 January 2021, the English Wikipedia reached one billion edits, where the billionth edit was made by Steven Pruitt. MIT Press published an open access book of essays &quot;Wikipedia @ 20: Stories of an Unfinished Revolution&quot;, edited by Joseph Reagle and Jackie Koerner with contributions from prominent Wikipedians, Wikimedians, researchers, journalists, librarians and other experts reflecting on particular histories and themes. By November 2021, Wikipedia had fallen to the thirteenth-placed website in the world for global internet engagement.

==== 2022 ====
On 6 December 2022, Wikipedian Richard Knipel created the article Artwork title, whose first revision was a draft generated by ChatGPT that Knipel had made minor edits to more closely conform with Wikipedia standards. Knipel stated on a talk page that he believed this was the first time anyone had used ChatGPT to compose a Wikipedia article. The posting of this article was criticized by other editors and sparked controversy within the Wikipedia community, leading to an extensive debate about whether ChatGPT and similar models should be used in writing content for Wikipedia and, if so, to what extent.

====2023====
In January 2023, the default Wikipedia desktop interface was changed for the first time since 2010, to Vector 2022. The new interface received massive critique from users, of many, centered around the fixed width which resulted in an abundance of white space on wide monitors, leading to a 90,000-word-long discussion on whether the new skin should be default, the autumn prior. Swahili Wikipedia unanimously voted to reject the new skin and &quot;curtly&quot; demanded a return to the old skin. Other critique was aimed at the Wikimedia Foundation hiring a design team with limited wiki-experience. Brandon Harris, who was a senior designer at Wikipedia from 2010 to 2014, said: &quot;Wikimedia Foundation often hires designers who aren’t familiar with the community, and they come in and try to make all these changes—running head-first into a buzz saw—and the community understandably resists&quot;.
After consultation and a contest, the first sound logo of Wikimedia (including Wikipedia) was adopted.

==History by subject area==

===Hardware and software===
:&quot;The software that runs Wikipedia, and the computer hardware, server farms and other systems upon which Wikipedia relies.&quot;
* In January 2001, Wikipedia ran on UseModWiki, written in Perl by Clifford Adams. The server still runs on Linux, although the original text was stored in files rather than in a database. Articles were named with the CamelCase convention.
* In January 2002, &quot;Phase II&quot; of the wiki software powering Wikipedia was introduced, replacing the older UseModWiki. Written specifically for the project by Magnus Manske, it included a PHP wiki engine.
* In July 2002, a major rewrite of the software powering Wikipedia went live; dubbed &quot;Phase III&quot;, it replaced the older &quot;Phase II&quot; version, and became MediaWiki. It was written by Lee Daniel Crocker in response to the increasing demands of the growing project.
* In October 2002, Derek Ramsey created a botan automated program called Rambotto add a large number of articles about United States towns; these articles were automatically generated from U.S. census data. He thus increased the number of Wikipedia articles by 33,832. This has been called &quot;the most controversial move in Wikipedia history&quot;.
* In January 2003, support for mathematical formulas in TeX was added. The code was contributed by Tomasz Wegrzanowski.
* On 9 June 2003, Wikipedia&#x27;s ISBN interface was amended to make ISBNs in articles link to Special:Booksources, which fetches its contents from the user-editable page . Before this, ISBN link targets were coded into the software and new ones were suggested on the page. See the edit that changed this.
* After 6 December 2003, various system messages shown to Wikipedia users were no longer hard coded, allowing Wikipedia to modify certain parts of MediaWiki&#x27;s interface, such as the message shown to blocked users.
* On 12 February 2004, server operations were moved from San Diego, California to Tampa, Florida.
* On 29 May 2004, all the various websites were updated to a new version of the MediaWiki software.
* On 30 May 2004, the first instances of &quot;categorization&quot; entries appeared. Category schemes, like Recent Changes and Edit This Page, had existed since the founding of Wikipedia. However, Sanger had viewed the schemes as lists, and even hand-entered articles, whereas the categorization effort centered on individual categorization entries in each article of the encyclopedia, as part of a larger automatic categorization of the articles of the encyclopedia.
* After 3 June 2004, administrators could edit the style of the interface by changing the CSS in the monobook stylesheet at .
* Also on 30 May 2004, with MediaWiki 1.3, the Template namespace was created, allowing transclusion of standard texts.
* On 7 June 2005 at 3:00 a.m. Eastern Standard Time, the bulk of the Wikimedia servers were moved to a new facility across the street. All Wikimedia projects were down during this time.
* In March 2013, the first phase of the Wikidata interwiki database became available across Wikipedia&#x27;s language editions.
* In July 2013, the VisualEditor editing interface was inaugurated, allowing users to edit Wikipedia using a WYSIWYG text editor (similar to a word processor) instead of wiki markup. An editing interface optimised for mobile devices was also released.

===Look and feel===
:&quot;The external face of Wikipedia, its look and feel, and the Wikipedia branding, as presented to users.&quot;
* On 4 April 2002, BrilliantProse, since renamed Featured Articles, was moved to the Wikipedia namespace from the article namespace.
* Around 15 October 2003, a new Wikipedia logo was installed. The logo concept was selected by a voting process, which was followed by a revision process to select the best variant. The final selection was created by David Friedland (who edits Wikipedia under the username &quot;nohat&quot;) based on a logo design and concept created by Paul Stansifer.
* On 22 February 2004, Did You Know (DYK) made its first Main Page appearance.
* On 23 February 2004, a coordinated new look for the Main Page appeared at 19:46 UTC. Hand-chosen entries for the Daily Featured Article, Anniversaries, In the News, and Did You Know rounded out the new look.
* On 10 January 2005, the multilingual portal at www.wikipedia.org was set up, replacing a redirect to the English-language Wikipedia.
* On 5 February 2005, was created, becoming the first thematic &quot;portal&quot; on the English Wikipedia. However, the concept was pioneered on the German Wikipedia, where Portal:Recht (law studies) was set up in October 2003.
* On 16 July 2005, the English Wikipedia began the practice of including the day&#x27;s &quot;featured pictures&quot; on the Main Page.
* On 19 March 2006, following a vote, the Main Page of the English-language Wikipedia featured its first redesign in nearly two years.
* On 13 May 2010, the site released a new interface. New features included an updated logo, new navigation tools, and a link wizard.

==== Layout changes in 2023 ====

Vector 2022, an update to Wikipedia&#x27;s previous skin Vector 2010, was announced in September 2020, and initially slated for debut in 2021, before being ultimately deployed in January 2023. By January 2023, Wikimedia had made the update available to 300 of its language editions; it was the default for the Arabic and Greek versions.

Vector 2022 features a revised user interface which makes numerous changes to the arrangement of the interface elements. Among them, the language selection menu, previously located to the left of the screen, now is found in the top right corner of the display of the article that is currently read. Additionally, the sidebar is collapsible behind a hamburger button. Vector 2022 additionally increases the margins of the article display, which has the effect of limiting the width of the article; a toggle exists which can decrease the margins and expand the line width of the article to fill the screen. The default size of the text has not been increased, although the Wikimedia Foundation told &quot;Engadget&quot; that they hope to make this an option in future. The search function was also updated in Vector 2022, as the suggested results in response to user queries now include images and short descriptions from the pages in question.

The Wikimedia Foundation said that the change was motivated by a desire to modernize the site and improve the navigation and editing experience for readers inexperienced with the internet, as the previous skin was deemed &quot;clunky and overwhelming.&quot; Tests conducted by the foundation yielded results of a 30 percent increase in user searches, and a 15 percent decrease in scrolling. Early versions of Vector 2022 first went live in 2020 on the French-, Hebrew-, and Portuguese-language Wikipedia sites, as the skin&#x27;s new features were rolled out to users for testing gradually before its full release. The skin went live as the default skin for readers of Wikimedia sites in 300 (out of 318) languages on 18 January 2023.

Following the mass rollout of Vector 2022, it is still possible to read Wikipedia using the previous skin. However, to do so requires readers to register for a Wikipedia account, and then set their preferences to display Vector 2010 instead. No changes were made to existing Wikipedia skins such as Monobook and Timeless, which also remain available to use.

Wikipedia users were divided on the changes. A request for comment on the English Wikipedia asking the community whether or not Vector 2022 should be deployed as the default skin accumulated over 90,000 words in responses. Critics of the redesign objected most prominently to the white space left empty in the new skin, while other users criticized said critics as having a kneejerk resistance to change. 165 editors participating in the discussion disapproved of the new skin, while 153 were in favor, and nine remained neutral. Despite the larger number of editors who expressed that they did not want Vector 2022 to be deployed in its then-current form, as consensus on Wikipedia is not decided by vote, the discussion was closed in favor of the redesign, considering the positive comments left by other users. The Vector 2022 developers made some changes to the skin in response to the criticisms, such as adding a toggle to enable article content to fill the entire width of the screen. Users on the Swahili Wikipedia unanimously disagreed with the enactment of the new skin.

Journalists responding to Vector 2022&#x27;s rollout considered the update and the new features introduced as useful additions, but generally characterized the skin as a minor update that did not fundamentally change their reading experience on Wikipedia. Annie Rauwerda, creator of the Depths of Wikipedia social media accounts, wrote in &quot;Slate&quot; that Vector 2022 was not &quot;dramatically different&quot; from the previous skin. Rauwerda additionally noted the similarity between the Wikipedia community backlash against the design and previous resistances to similar visual changes on popular sites such as Reddit. Rauwerda, and Mike Pearl of &quot;Mashable&quot;, commented that users displeased with the change could weigh in on a discussion about the skin, or use the site&#x27;s built-in customization features to alter their reading experience.

===Internal structures===
:&quot;Landmarks in the Wikipedia community, and the development of its organization, , and .&quot;
* In April 2001, Wales formally defines the &quot;neutral point of view&quot;, Wikipedia&#x27;s core non-negotiable editorial policy, a reformulation of the &quot;Lack of Bias&quot; policy outlined by Sanger for Nupedia in spring or summer 2000, which covered many of the same core principles.
* In September 2001, collaboration by subject matter in is introduced.
* In February 2002, concerns over the risk of future censorship and commercialization by Bomis Inc (Wikipedia&#x27;s original host) combined with a lack of guarantee this would not happen, led most participants of the Spanish Wikipedia to break away and establish it independently as the &quot;Enciclopedia Libre&quot;. Following clarification of Wikipedia&#x27;s status and non-commercial nature later that year, re-merger talks between Enciclopedia Libre and the re-founded Spanish Wikipedia occasionally took place in 2002 and 2003, but no conclusion was reached. As of October 2009, the two continue to coexist as substantial Spanish language reference sources, with around 43,000 articles (EL) and 520,000 articles (Sp.W) respectively.
* Also in 2002, policy and style issues were clarified with the creation of the &quot;Manual of Style&quot;, along with a number of other policies and guidelines.
* In November 2002, new mailing lists for WikiEN and Announce were set up, as well as other language mailing lists, to reduce the volume of traffic on mailing lists.
* In July 2003, the rule against editing one&#x27;s is introduced.
* On 28 October 2003, the first &quot;real&quot; meeting of Wikipedians happened in Munich. Many cities followed suit, and soon a number of regular Wikipedian get-togethers were established around the world. Several Internet communities, including one on the popular blog website LiveJournal, have also sprung up since.
* From 10 July to 30 August 2004 the and formerly on the Main Page were replaced by links to overviews. On 27 August 2004 the &quot;Community Portal&quot; was started, to serve as a focus for community efforts. These were previously accomplished on an informal basis, by individual queries of the Recent Changes, in wiki style, as ad hoc collaborations between like-minded editors.
* During September to December 2005 following the Seigenthaler controversy and other similar concerns, several anti-abuse features and policies were added to Wikipedia. These were:
::* The (a MediaWiki extension to assist detection of abuse via internet sock-puppetry) was established in November 2005. Checkuser function had previously existed but was viewed more as a system tool at the time, so there had been no need for a policy covering use on a more routine basis.
::*Creation of new pages on the English Wikipedia was restricted to editors who had created a user account.
::* The introduction and rapid adoption of the policy , giving a far tighter quality control and fact-check system to biographical articles related to living people.
::* The &quot;semi-protection&quot; function and policy, allowing pages to be protected so that only those with an account could edit.
* In May 2006, a new &quot;oversight&quot; feature was introduced on the English Wikipedia, allowing a handful of highly trusted users to permanently erase page revisions containing copyright infringements or libelous or personal information from a page&#x27;s history. Previous to this, page version deletion was laborious, and also deleted versions remained visible to other administrators and could be un-deleted by them.
* On 1 January 2007, the subcommunity named was disbanded by communal consent. Esperanza had begun as an effort to promote &quot;&quot; and a social support network, but had developed its own subculture and private structures. Its disbanding was described as the painful but necessary remedy for a project that had allowed editors to &quot;see themselves as Esperanzans first and foremost&quot;. A number of Esperanza&#x27;s subprojects were integrated back into Wikipedia as free-standing projects, but most of them are now inactive. When the group was founded in September 2005, there had been concerns expressed that it would eventually be condemned as such.
* In April 2007, the results of a 4-month policy review by a working group of several hundred editors seeking to merge the core Wikipedia policies into one core policy () were polled for community support. The proposal did not gain consensus; a significant view became evident that the existing structure of three strong focused policies covering the respective areas of policy, was frequently seen as more helpful to quality control than one more general merged proposal.
* A one-day blackout of Wikipedia was called by Jimmy Wales on 18 January 2012, in conjunction with Google and over 7,000 other websites, to protest the Stop Online Piracy Act then under consideration by the United States Congress.

===The Wikimedia Foundation and legal structures===
:&quot;Legal and organizational structure of the Wikimedia Foundation, its executive, and its activities as a foundation.&quot;
* In August 2002, shortly after Jimmy Wales announced that he would never run commercial advertisements on Wikipedia, the URL of Wikipedia was changed from &quot;wikipedia.com&quot; to &quot;wikipedia.org&quot; (.com and .org).
* On 20 June 2003, the Wikimedia Foundation was founded.
* Communications committee was formed in January 2006 to handle media inquiries and emails received for the foundation and Wikipedia via the newly implemented OTRS (a ticket handling system).

===Fundraising===
Every year, the Wikimedia Foundation runs fundraising campaigns on Wikipedia to support its operations. These generally last about a month and happen at different times of the year in different countries. In addition to the fundraising banners on Wikipedia itself, there are also email campaigns; some emails invite people to leave the Wikimedia Foundation money in their wills. Revenue has risen every year of the Wikimedia Foundation&#x27;s existence, reaching as of 30 June 2023, versus expenses of . In addition, the Wikimedia Endowment, an organizationally separate fundraising effort begun in 2016, reached $100 million in 2021, five years sooner than planned.

===External impact===
* In 2007, Wikipedia was deemed fit to be used as a major source by the UK Intellectual Property Office in a Formula One trademark case ruling.
* Over time, Wikipedia gained recognition amongst more traditional media as a &quot;key source&quot; for major new events, such as the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and related tsunami, the 2008 American Presidential election, and 2007 Virginia Tech shooting. The latter article was accessed 750,000 times in two days, with newspapers published locally to the shootings adding that &quot;Wikipedia has emerged as the clearinghouse for detailed information on the event.&quot;
* On 21 February 2007, Noam Cohen of the &quot;New York Times&quot; reported that some academics were banning the use of Wikipedia as a research tool.
* On 27 February 2007, an article in &quot;The Harvard Crimson&quot; newspaper reported that some professors at Harvard University included Wikipedia in their syllabi, but that there was a split in their perception of using Wikipedia.
* In July 2013, a large-scale study by four major universities identified the most disputed articles on Wikipedia, finding that Israel, Adolf Hitler, and God were more fiercely debated than any other subjects.

====Effect of biographical articles====
Because Wikipedia biographies are often updated with new information comes, they are often used as a reference source on the lives of notable people. This has led to attempts to manipulate and falsify Wikipedia articles for promotional or defamatory purposes (Controversies) and has also led to novel uses of the biographical material provided.
* In November 2005, the Seigenthaler controversy occurred when a hoaxer asserted on Wikipedia that journalist John Seigenthaler had been involved in the Kennedy assassination of 1963.
* In December 2006, German comedian Atze Schröder sued Arne Klempert, secretary of Wikimedia Deutschland because he did not want his real name published in Wikipedia. Schröder later withdrew his complaint but wanted his attorney&#x27;s costs to be paid by Klempert. A court decided that the artist had to cover those costs himself.
* On 16 February 2007, Turkish historian Taner Akçam was briefly detained upon arrival at Montréal–Pierre Elliott Trudeau International Airport because of false information on his Wikipedia biography claiming he was a terrorist.
* In November 2008, the German Left Party politician Lutz Heilmann claimed that some remarks in his Wikipedia article caused damage to his reputation. He succeeded in getting a court order to make Wikimedia Deutschland remove a key search portal. The result was a national outpouring of support for Wikipedia, more donations to Wikimedia Deutschland, and a rise in daily pageviews of the Lutz Heilmann article from a few dozen to half a million. Shortly after, Heilmann asked the court to withdraw the court order.
* In December 2008, Wikimedia Nederland, the Dutch chapter, won a preliminary injunction after an entrepreneur was linked in &quot;his&quot; article with the criminal Willem Holleeder and wanted the article deleted. The judge in Utrecht believed Wikimedia&#x27;s assertion that it has no influence on the content of Dutch Wikipedia.
* In February 2009, when Karl Theodor Maria Nikolaus Johann Jacob Philipp Franz Joseph Sylvester Buhl-Freiherr von und zu Guttenberg became federal minister on 10 February 2009, an unregistered user added an eleventh given name in the article on German Wikipedia: &quot;Wilhelm&quot;. Numerous newspapers took it over. When wary Wikipedians wanted to erase &quot;Wilhelm&quot;, the revert was reverted with regard to those newspapers. This case about Wikipedia reliability and journalists copying from Wikipedia became known as &quot;Falscher Wilhelm&quot; (&quot;wrong Wilhelm&quot;).

===Early roles of Wales and Sanger===

Wales, along with others, came up with and funded the idea of an open-source, collaborative encyclopedia that would accept contributions from ordinary people. Sanger played an important role in this as Nupedia&#x27;s editor-in-chief and main employee. In Sanger&#x27;s introductory message to the Nupedia mailing list, he said that Jimmy Wales &quot;contacted me and asked me to apply as editor-in-chief of Nupedia. [...] He had had the idea for Nupedia since at least last fall. He tells me that, when thinking about people (particularly philosophers) he knew who could manage this sort of long-term project, he thought I would be perfect for the job. This is indeed my dream job&quot;.

Sanger suggested using a wiki to provide a complementary project for people &quot;intimidated and bored&quot; by Nupedia&#x27;s elaborate processes, and coined the portmanteau &quot;Wikipedia&quot; as the project name. This was broadly seen as a way to unblock the growing community of Nupedians who found it hard to contribute. Sanger continued to work on Nupedia while contributing to Wikipedia (including drafting policies such as &quot;Ignore all rules&quot; and &quot;Neutral point of view&quot;) and worked with an outreach lead to build up the community of both Nupedia and Wikipedia editors. Upon departure in March 2002, Sanger emphasized the main issue was purely the cessation of funding for his role, which was not viable part-time, and encouraged others to continue contributing to Wikipedia while noting that Nupedia could not survive without a full-time editor-in-chief. Later that year he stopped contributing to either project, and by 2004 had become publicly critical of Wikipedia. In December 2004 he wrote an essay arguing that Wikipedia was suffering from anti-elitism. In April 2005 he published a two-part memoir of his work on Nupedia and Wikipedia, highlighting his role in their creation and continuing belief that Nupedia deserved to be saved. Later that year Wales began to push back on Sanger&#x27;s characterization of his role in the project. By 2006, after the launch of Citizendium, Sanger was harshly critical of Wikipedia, describing it as &quot;broken beyond repair.&quot;

In 2005, Wales described himself simply as the founder of Wikipedia; however, according to Brian Bergstein of the Associated Press, &quot;Sanger has long been cited as a co-founder.&quot; Sanger and Wales were referred to as co-founders in various press releases, interviews, and news reports from 2001 and 2002. Before January 2004, Wales did not dispute Sanger&#x27;s status as co-founder. In 2006, Wales said, &quot;He used to work for me [...] I don&#x27;t agree with calling him a co-founder, but he likes the title&quot;. Starting in 2006, when Sanger wrote and was interviewed extensively about the launch of Citizendium, he emphasized his status as co-founder, and these earlier sources that described him as such.

===Controversies===
* In November 2005, the Seigenthaler controversy caused Brian Chase to resign from his employment, after his identity was ascertained by Daniel Brandt of Wikipedia Watch. Following this, the scientific journal &quot;Nature&quot; undertook a peer reviewed study to test articles in Wikipedia against their equivalents in &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot;, and concluded they are comparable in terms of accuracy. &quot;Britannica&quot; rejected their methodology and their conclusion. &quot;Nature&quot; refused to release any form of apology, and instead asserted the reliability of its study and a rejection of the criticisms.
* During early-to-mid-2006, the congressional aides biography scandals were publicized, whereby several political aides were caught trying to influence the Wikipedia biographies of several politicians. The aides removed undesirable information (including pejorative quotes, or broken campaign promises), added favorable information or &quot;glowing&quot; tributes, or replaced the article in part or whole by staff-authored biographies. The staff of at least five politicians were implicated: Marty Meehan, Norm Coleman, Conrad Burns, Joe Biden and Gil Gutknecht. The activities documented were:

In a separate but similar incident, the campaign manager for Cathy Cox, Morton Brilliant, resigned after being found to have added negative information to the Wikipedia entries of political opponents. Following media publicity, the incidents tapered off around August 2006.
* In July 2006, Joshua Gardner was exposed as a fake Duke of Cleveland with a Wikipedia page.
* In January 2007, English-language Wikipedians in Qatar were briefly blocked from editing, following a spate of vandalism, by an administrator who did not realize that the country&#x27;s internet traffic is routed through a single IP address. Multiple media sources promptly declared that Wikipedia was banning Qatar from the site.
* On 23 January 2007, a Microsoft employee offered to pay Rick Jelliffe to review and change certain Wikipedia articles regarding an open-source document standard which was rival to a Microsoft format.
* In February 2007, &quot;The New Yorker&quot; magazine issued a rare editorial correction that a prominent English Wikipedia editor and administrator known as &quot;Essjay&quot;, had invented a persona using fictitious credentials. The editor, Ryan Jordan, became a Wikia employee in January 2007 and divulged his real name; this was noticed by Daniel Brandt of Wikipedia Watch, and communicated to the original article author (Essjay controversy).
* Also in February 2007, Barbara Bauer, a literary agent, sued Wikimedia for defamation and causing harm to her business, the Barbara Bauer Literary Agency. In &quot;Bauer v. Glatzer&quot;, Bauer claimed that information on Wikipedia critical of her abilities as a literary agent caused this harm. The Electronic Frontier Foundation defended Wikipedia and moved to dismiss the case on 1 May 2008. The case against the Wikimedia Foundation was dismissed on 1 July 2008.
* In June 2007, an anonymous user posted hoax information that, by coincidence, foreshadowed the Chris Benoit murder-suicide, hours before the bodies were found by investigators. The discovery of the edit attracted widespread media attention and was first covered in the sister site .
* In October 2007, in their obituaries of recently deceased TV theme composer Ronnie Hazlehurst, many British media organisations reported that he had co-written the S Club 7 song &quot;Reach&quot;. In fact, he had not, and it was discovered that this information had been sourced from a hoax edit to Hazlehurst&#x27;s Wikipedia article.
* On 14 July 2009, the National Portrait Gallery issued a cease-and-desist letter for alleged breach of copyright, against a Wikipedia editor who downloaded more than 3,000 high-resolution images from the NPG website, and placed them on Wikimedia Commons (National Portrait Gallery and Wikimedia Foundation copyright dispute).
* In April and May 2010, there was controversy over the hosting and display of sexual drawing and pornographic images including images of children on Wikipedia. It led to the mass removal of pornographic content from Wikimedia Foundation sites.
* In November 2012, Lord Justice Leveson wrote in his report on British press standards, &quot;&quot;The Independent&quot; was founded in 1986 by the journalists Andreas Whittam Smith, Stephen Glover and Brett Straub...&quot; He had used the Wikipedia article for &quot;The Independent&quot; newspaper as his source, but an act of vandalism had replaced Matthew Symonds (a genuine co-founder) with Brett Straub (an unknown character). &quot;The Economist&quot; said of the Leveson report, &quot;Parts of it are a scissors-and-paste job culled from Wikipedia.&quot;
* In late 2013, commentators publicly shared observations of the reappearance of many of the pornographic images deleted from Wikipedia since 2010.

=== Notable forks and derivatives ===
There are a large number of . Other sites also use the MediaWiki software and concept, popularized by Wikipedia. No list of them is maintained. Specialized foreign language forks using the Wikipedia concept include Enciclopedia Libre (Spanish), &quot;Wikiweise&quot; (German), &quot;WikiZnanie&quot; (Russian), Susning.nu (Swedish), and Baidu Baike (Chinese). Some of these (such as &quot;Enciclopedia Libre&quot;) use GFDL or compatible licenses as used by Wikipedia, leading to the exchange of material with their respective language Wikipedias. In 2006, Sanger founded Citizendium, based upon a modified version of MediaWiki. The site said it aimed &#x27;to improve on the Wikipedia model with &quot;gentle expert oversight&quot;, among other things&#x27;. In 2006, conservative activist and lawyer Andrew Schlafly founded Conservapedia, based on MediaWiki.

===Publication on other media===
The German Wikipedia was the first to be partly published also using other media (rather than online on the internet), including releases on CD in November 2004 and more extended versions on CDs or DVD in April 2005 and December 2006. In December 2005, the publisher Zenodot Verlagsgesellschaft mbH, a sister company of Directmedia, published a 139-page book explaining Wikipedia, its history and policies, which was accompanied by a 7.5 GB DVD containing 300,000 articles and 100,000 images from the German Wikipedia. Originally, Directmedia also announced plans to print the German Wikipedia in its entirety, in 100 volumes of 800 pages each. The publication was due to begin in October 2006, and finish in 2010. In March 2006, however, this project was called off.

In September 2008, Bertelsmann published a 1000 pages volume with a selection of popular German Wikipedia articles. Bertelsmann paid voluntarily 1 Euro per sold copy to Wikimedia Deutschland. A free software project has also been launched to make a static version of English Wikipedia available for use on iPods. The &quot;Encyclopodia&quot; project was started around March 2006 and can currently be used on 1st to 4th-generation iPods.

==== English Wikipedia CD/DVD/Kiwix ZIM file releases ====

As of June 2022, there have been no more article selection releases since Wikipedia Version 0.8.

===Lawsuits===
In limited ways, the Wikimedia Foundation is protected by Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. In the defamation action &quot;Bauer et al. v. Glatzer et al.&quot;, it was held that Wikimedia had no case to answer because of this section. A similar law in France caused a lawsuit to be dismissed in October 2007. In 2013, a German appeals court or Oberlandesgericht (the Higher Regional Court of Stuttgart) ruled that Wikipedia is a &quot;service provider&quot; not a &quot;content provider&quot;, and as such is immune from liability as long as it takes down content that is accused of being illegal.

<text>Hydropower (from Ancient Greek -, &quot;water&quot;), also known as water power or water energy, is the use of falling or fast-running water to produce electricity or to power machines. This is achieved by converting the gravitational potential or kinetic energy of a water source to produce power. Hydropower is a method of sustainable energy production. Hydropower is now used principally for hydroelectric power generation, and is also applied as one half of an energy storage system known as pumped-storage hydroelectricity.

Hydropower is an attractive alternative to fossil fuels as it does not directly produce carbon dioxide or other atmospheric pollutants and it provides a relatively consistent source of power. Nonetheless, it has economic, sociological, and environmental downsides and requires a sufficiently energetic source of water, such as a river or elevated lake. International institutions such as the World Bank view hydropower as a low-carbon means for economic development.

Since ancient times, hydropower from watermills has been used as a renewable energy source for irrigation and the operation of mechanical devices, such as gristmills, sawmills, textile mills, trip hammers, dock cranes, domestic lifts, and ore mills. A trompe, which produces compressed air from falling water, is sometimes used to power other machinery at a distance.

== Calculating the amount of available power ==
A hydropower resource can be evaluated by its available power. Power is a function of the hydraulic head and volumetric flow rate. The head is the energy per unit weight (or unit mass) of water. The static head is proportional to the difference in height through which the water falls. Dynamic head is related to the velocity of moving water. Each unit of water can do an amount of work equal to its weight times the head.

The power available from falling water can be calculated from the flow rate and density of water, the height of fall, and the local acceleration due to gravity:

::formula_1

:where
::* formula_2 (work flow rate out) is the useful power output (SI unit: watts)
::* formula_3 (&quot;eta&quot;) is the efficiency of the turbine (dimensionless)
::* formula_4 is the mass flow rate (SI unit: kilograms per second)
::* formula_5 (&quot;rho&quot;) is the density of water (SI unit: kilograms per cubic metre)
::* formula_6 is the volumetric flow rate (SI unit: cubic metres per second)
::* formula_7 is the acceleration due to gravity (SI unit: metres per second per second)
::* formula_8 (&quot;Delta h&quot;) is the difference in height between the outlet and inlet (SI unit: metres)

To illustrate, the power output of a turbine that is 85% efficient, with a flow rate of 80 cubic metres per second (2800 cubic feet per second) and a head of , is 97 megawatts:
:formula_9

Operators of hydroelectric stations compare the total electrical energy produced with the theoretical potential energy of the water passing through the turbine to calculate efficiency. Procedures and definitions for calculation of efficiency are given in test codes such as ASME PTC 18 and IEC 60041. Field testing of turbines is used to validate the manufacturer&#x27;s efficiency guarantee. Detailed calculation of the efficiency of a hydropower turbine accounts for the head lost due to flow friction in the power canal or penstock, rise in tailwater level due to flow, the location of the station and effect of varying gravity, the air temperature and barometric pressure, the density of the water at ambient temperature, and the relative altitudes of the forebay and tailbay. For precise calculations, errors due to rounding and the number of significant digits of constants must be considered.

Some hydropower systems such as water wheels can draw power from the flow of a body of water without necessarily changing its height. In this case, the available power is the kinetic energy of the flowing water. Over-shot water wheels can efficiently capture both types of energy. The flow in a stream can vary widely from season to season. The development of a hydropower site requires analysis of flow records, sometimes spanning decades, to assess the reliable annual energy supply. Dams and reservoirs provide a more dependable source of power by smoothing seasonal changes in water flow. However, reservoirs have a significant environmental impact, as does alteration of naturally occurring streamflow. Dam design must account for the worst-case, &quot;probable maximum flood&quot; that can be expected at the site; a spillway is often included to route flood flows around the dam. A computer model of the hydraulic basin and rainfall and snowfall records are used to predict the maximum flood.

== Disadvantages and limitations ==

Some disadvantages of hydropower have been identified. Dam failures can have catastrophic effects, including loss of life, property and pollution of land.

Dams and reservoirs can have major negative impacts on river ecosystems such as preventing some animals traveling upstream, cooling and de-oxygenating of water released downstream, and loss of nutrients due to settling of particulates. River sediment builds river deltas and dams prevent them from restoring what is lost from erosion. Furthermore, studies found that the construction of dams and reservoirs can result in habitat loss for some aquatic species.Large and deep dam and reservoir plants cover large areas of land which causes greenhouse gas emissions from underwater rotting vegetation. Furthermore, although at lower levels than other renewable energy sources, it was found that hydropower produces methane equivalent to almost a billion tonnes of CO2 greenhouse gas a year. This occurs when organic matters accumulate at the bottom of the reservoir because of the deoxygenation of water which triggers anaerobic digestion.

People who live near a hydro plant site are displaced during construction or when reservoir banks become unstable. Another potential disadvantage is cultural or religious sites may block construction.

==Applications==
===Mechanical power===
====Watermills====
====Compressed air ====

A plentiful head of water can be made to generate compressed air directly without moving parts. In these designs, a falling column of water is deliberately mixed with air bubbles generated through turbulence or a venturi pressure reducer at the high-level intake. This allows it to fall down a shaft into a subterranean, high-roofed chamber where the now-compressed air separates from the water and becomes trapped. The height of the falling water column maintains compression of the air in the top of the chamber, while an outlet, submerged below the water level in the chamber allows water to flow back to the surface at a lower level than the intake. A separate outlet in the roof of the chamber supplies the compressed air. A facility on this principle was built on the Montreal River at Ragged Shutes near Cobalt, Ontario, in 1910 and supplied 5,000 horsepower to nearby mines.

===Electricity===
Hydroelectricity is the biggest hydropower application. Hydroelectricity generates about 15% of global electricity and provides at least 50% of the total electricity supply for more than 35 countries. In 2021, global installed hydropower electrical capacity reached almost 1400 GW, the highest among all renewable energy technologies.

Hydroelectricity generation starts with converting either the potential energy of water that is present due to the site&#x27;s elevation or the kinetic energy of moving water into electrical energy.

Hydroelectric power plants vary in terms of the way they harvest energy. One type involves a dam and a reservoir. The water in the reservoir is available on demand to be used to generate electricity by passing through channels that connect the dam to the reservoir. The water spins a turbine, which is connected to the generator that produces electricity.

The other type is called a run-of-river plant. In this case, a barrage is built to control the flow of water, absent a reservoir. The run-of river power plant needs continuous water flow and therefore has less ability to provide power on demand. The kinetic energy of flowing water is the main source of energy.

Both designs have limitations. For example, dam construction can result in discomfort to nearby residents. The dam and reservoirs occupy a relatively large amount of space that may be opposed by nearby communities. Moreover, reservoirs can potentially have major environmental consequences such as harming downstream habitats. On the other hand, the limitation of the run-of-river project is the decreased efficiency of electricity generation because the process depends on the speed of the seasonal river flow. This means that the rainy season increases electricity generation compared to the dry season.

The size of hydroelectric plants can vary from small plants called micro hydro, to large plants that supply power to a whole country. As of 2019, the five largest power stations in the world are conventional hydroelectric power stations with dams.

Hydroelectricity can also be used to store energy in the form of potential energy between two reservoirs at different heights with pumped-storage. Water is pumped uphill into reservoirs during periods of low demand to be released for generation when demand is high or system generation is low.

Other forms of electricity generation with hydropower include tidal stream generators using energy from tidal power generated from oceans, rivers, and human-made canal systems to generating electricity.

==Rain power==

Rain has been referred to as &quot;one of the last unexploited energy sources in nature. When it rains, billions of litres of water can fall, which have an enormous electric potential if used in the right way.&quot; Research is being done into the different methods of generating power from rain, such as by using the energy in the impact of raindrops. This is in its very early stages with new and emerging technologies being tested, prototyped and created. Such power has been called rain power. One method in which this has been attempted is by using hybrid solar panels called &quot;all-weather solar panels&quot; that can generate electricity from both the sun and the rain.

According to zoologist and science and technology educator, Luis Villazon, &quot;A 2008 French study estimated that you could use piezoelectric devices, which generate power when they move, to extract 12 milliwatts from a raindrop. Over a year, this would amount to less than 0.001kWh per square metre – enough to power a remote sensor.&quot; Villazon suggested a better application would be to collect the water from fallen rain and use it to drive a turbine, with an estimated energy generation of 3 kWh of energy per year for a 185 m2 roof. A microturbine-based system created by three students from the Technological University of Mexico has been used to generate electricity. The Pluvia system &quot;uses the stream of rainwater runoff from houses&#x27; rooftop rain gutters to spin a microturbine in a cylindrical housing. Electricity generated by that turbine is used to charge 12-volt batteries.&quot;

The term rain power has also been applied to hydropower systems which include the process of capturing the rain.

== History ==
===Ancient history===

Evidence suggests that the fundamentals of hydropower date to ancient Greek civilization. Other evidence indicates that the waterwheel independently emerged in China around the same period. Evidence of water wheels and watermills date to the ancient Near East in the 4th century BC. Moreover, evidence indicates the use of hydropower using irrigation machines to ancient civilizations such as Sumer and Babylonia. Studies suggest that the water wheel was the initial form of water power and it was driven by either humans or animals.

In the Roman Empire, water-powered mills were described by Vitruvius by the first century BC. The Barbegal mill, located in modern-day France, had 16 water wheels processing up to 28 tons of grain per day. Roman waterwheels were also used for sawing marble such as the Hierapolis sawmill of the late 3rd century AD. Such sawmills had a waterwheel that drove two crank-and-connecting rods to power two saws. It also appears in two 6th century Eastern Roman sawmills excavated at Ephesus and Gerasa respectively. The crank and connecting rod mechanism of these Roman watermills converted the rotary motion of the waterwheel into the linear movement of the saw blades. 

Water-powered trip hammers and bellows in China, during the Han dynasty (202 BC – 220 AD), were initially thought to be powered by water scoops. However, some historians suggested that they were powered by waterwheels. This is since it was theorized that water scoops would not have had the motive force to operate their blast furnace bellows. Many texts describe the Hun waterwheel; some of the earliest ones are the &quot;Jijiupian&quot; dictionary of 40 BC, Yang Xiong&#x27;s text known as the &quot;Fangyan&quot; of 15 BC, as well as &quot;Xin Lun,&quot; written by Huan Tan about 20 AD. It was also during this time that the engineer Du Shi (c. AD 31) applied the power of waterwheels to piston-bellows in forging cast iron.

Ancient Indian texts dating back to the 4th century BC refer to the term &quot;cakkavattaka&quot; (turning wheel), which commentaries explain as &quot;arahatta-ghati-yanta&quot; (machine with wheel-pots attached), however whether this is water or hand powered is disputed by scholars India received Roman water mills and baths in the early 4th century AD when a certain according to Greek sources. Dams, spillways, reservoirs, channels, and water balance would develop in India during the Mauryan, Gupta and Chola empires.

Another example of the early use of hydropower is seen in hushing, a historic method of mining that uses flood or torrent of water to reveal mineral veins. The method was first used at the Dolaucothi Gold Mines in Wales from 75 AD onwards. This method was further developed in Spain in mines such as Las Médulas. Hushing was also widely used in Britain in the Medieval and later periods to extract lead and tin ores. It later evolved into hydraulic mining when used during the California Gold Rush in the 19th century.

The Islamic Empire spanned a large region, mainly in Asia and Africa, along with other surrounding areas. During the Islamic Golden Age and the Arab Agricultural Revolution (8th–13th centuries), hydropower was widely used and developed. Early uses of tidal power emerged along with large hydraulic factory complexes. A wide range of water-powered industrial mills were used in the region including fulling mills, gristmills, paper mills, hullers, sawmills, ship mills, stamp mills, steel mills, sugar mills, and tide mills. By the 11th century, every province throughout the Islamic Empire had these industrial mills in operation, from Al-Andalus and North Africa to the Middle East and Central Asia. Muslim engineers also used water turbines while employing gears in watermills and water-raising machines. They also pioneered the use of dams as a source of water power, used to provide additional power to watermills and water-raising machines. Islamic irriguation techniques including Persian Wheels would be introduced to India, and would be combined with local methods, during the Delhi Sultanate and the Mughal Empire.

Furthermore, in his book, &quot;The Book of Knowledge of Ingenious Mechanical Devices&quot;, the Muslim mechanical engineer, Al-Jazari (1136–1206) described designs for 50 devices. Many of these devices were water-powered, including clocks, a device to serve wine, and five devices to lift water from rivers or pools, where three of them are animal-powered and one can be powered by animal or water. Moreover, they included an endless belt with jugs attached, a cow-powered shadoof (a crane-like irrigation tool), and a reciprocating device with hinged valves.
===19th century===
In the 19th century, French engineer Benoît Fourneyron developed the first hydropower turbine. This device was implemented in the commercial plant of Niagara Falls in 1895 and it is still operating. In the early 20th century, English engineer William Armstrong built and operated the first private electrical power station which was located in his house in Cragside in Northumberland, England. In 1753, the French engineer Bernard Forest de Bélidor published his book, &quot;Architecture Hydraulique&quot;, which described vertical-axis and horizontal-axis hydraulic machines.

The growing demand for the Industrial Revolution would drive development as well. At the beginning of the Industrial Revolution in Britain, water was the main power source for new inventions such as Richard Arkwright&#x27;s water frame. Although water power gave way to steam power in many of the larger mills and factories, it was still used during the 18th and 19th centuries for many smaller operations, such as driving the bellows in small blast furnaces (e.g. the Dyfi Furnace) and gristmills, such as those built at Saint Anthony Falls, which uses the drop in the Mississippi River.

Technological advances moved the open water wheel into an enclosed turbine or water motor. In 1848, the British-American engineer James B. Francis, head engineer of Lowell&#x27;s Locks and Canals company, improved on these designs to create a turbine with 90% efficiency. He applied scientific principles and testing methods to the problem of turbine design. His mathematical and graphical calculation methods allowed the confident design of high-efficiency turbines to exactly match a site&#x27;s specific flow conditions. The Francis reaction turbine is still in use. In the 1870s, deriving from uses in the California mining industry, Lester Allan Pelton developed the high-efficiency Pelton wheel impulse turbine, which used hydropower from the high head streams characteristic of the Sierra Nevada.

===20th century===
The modern history of hydropower begins in the 1900s, with large dams built not simply to power neighboring mills or factories but provide extensive electricity for increasingly distant groups of people. Competition drove much of the global hydroelectric craze: Europe competed amongst itself to electrify first, and the United States&#x27; hydroelectric plants in Niagara Falls and the Sierra Nevada inspired bigger and bolder creations across the globe. American and USSR financers and hydropower experts also spread the gospel of dams and hydroelectricity across the globe during the Cold War, contributing to projects such as the Three Gorges Dam and the Aswan High Dam. 
Feeding desire for large scale electrification with water inherently required large dams across powerful rivers, which impacted public and private interests downstream and in flood zones. Inevitably smaller communities and marginalized groups suffered. They were unable to successfully resist companies flooding them out of their homes or blocking traditional salmon passages. The stagnant water created by hydroelectric dams provides breeding ground for pests and pathogens, leading to local epidemics. However, in some cases, a mutual need for hydropower could lead to cooperation between otherwise adversarial nations.
Hydropower technology and attitude began to shift in the second half of the 20th century. While countries had largely abandoned their small hydropower systems by the 1930s, the smaller hydropower plants began to make a comeback in the 1970s, boosted by government subsidies and a push for more independent energy producers. Some politicians who once advocated for large hydropower projects in the first half of the 20th century began to speak out against them, and citizen groups organizing against dam projects increased.

In the 1980s and 90s the international anti-dam movement had made finding government or private investors for new large hydropower projects incredibly difficult, and given rise to NGOs devoted to fighting dams. Additionally, while the cost of other energy sources fell, the cost of building new hydroelectric dams increased 4% annually between 1965 and 1990, due both to the increasing costs of construction and to the decrease in high quality building sites. In the 1990s, only 18% of the world&#x27;s electricity came from hydropower. Tidal power production also emerged in the 1960s as a burgeoning alternative hydropower system, though still has not taken hold as a strong energy contender.

====United States====
Especially at the start of the American hydropower experiment, engineers and politicians began major hydroelectricity projects to solve a problem of &#x27;wasted potential&#x27; rather than to power a population that needed the electricity. When the Niagara Falls Power Company began looking into damming Niagara, the first major hydroelectric project in the United States, in the 1890s they struggled to transport electricity from the falls far enough away to actually reach enough people and justify installation. The project succeeded in large part due to Nikola Tesla&#x27;s invention of the alternating current motor. On the other side of the country, San Francisco engineers, the Sierra Club, and the federal government fought over acceptable use of the Hetch Hetchy Valley. Despite ostensible protection within a national park, city engineers successfully won the rights to both water and power in the Hetch Hetchy Valley in 1913. After their victory they delivered Hetch Hetchy hydropower and water to San Francisco a decade later and at twice the promised cost, selling power to PG&amp;E which resold to San Francisco residents at a profit.

The American West, with its mountain rivers and lack of coal, turned to hydropower early and often, especially along the Columbia River and its tributaries. The Bureau of Reclamation built the Hoover Dam in 1931, symbolically linking the job creation and economic growth priorities of the New Deal. The federal government quickly followed Hoover with the Shasta Dam and Grand Coulee Dam. Power demand in Oregon did not justify damming the Columbia until WWI revealed the weaknesses of a coal-based energy economy. The federal government then began prioritizing interconnected power—and lots of it. Electricity from all three dams poured into war production during WWII.

After the war, the Grand Coulee Dam and accompanying hydroelectric projects electrified almost all of the rural Columbia Basin, but failed to improve the lives of those living and farming there the way its boosters had promised and also damaged the river ecosystem and migrating salmon populations. In the 1940s as well, the federal government took advantage of the sheer amount of unused power and flowing water from the Grand Coulee to build a nuclear site placed on the banks of the Columbia. The nuclear site leaked radioactive matter into the river, contaminating the entire area.

Post-WWII Americans, especially engineers from the Tennessee Valley Authority, refocused from simply building domestic dams to promoting hydropower abroad. While domestic dam building continued well into the 1970s, with the Reclamation Bureau and Army Corps of Engineers building more than 150 new dams across the American West, organized opposition to hydroelectric dams sparked up in the 1950s and 60s based on environmental concerns. Environmental movements successfully shut down proposed hydropower dams in Dinosaur National Monument and the Grand Canyon, and gained more hydropower-fighting tools with 1970s environmental legislation. As nuclear and fossil fuels grew in the 70s and 80s and environmental activists push for river restoration, hydropower gradually faded in American importance.

====Africa====
 Foreign powers and IGOs have frequently used hydropower projects in Africa as a tool to interfere in the economic development of African countries, such as the World Bank with the Kariba and Akosombo Dams, and the Soviet Union with the Aswan Dam. The Nile River especially has borne the consequences of countries both along the Nile and distant foreign actors using the river to expand their economic power or national force. After the British occupation of Egypt in 1882, the British worked with Egypt to construct the first Aswan Dam, which they heightened in 1912 and 1934 to try to hold back the Nile floods. Egyptian engineer Adriano Daninos developed a plan for the Aswan High Dam, inspired by the Tennessee Valley Authority&#x27;s multipurpose dam.

When Gamal Abdel Nasser took power in the 1950s, his government decided to undertake the High Dam project, publicizing it as an economic development project. After American refusal to help fund the dam, and anti-British sentiment in Egypt and British interests in neighboring Sudan combined to make the United Kingdom pull out as well, the Soviet Union funded the Aswan High Dam. Between 1977 and 1990 the dam&#x27;s turbines generated one third of Egypt&#x27;s electricity. The building of the Aswan Dam triggered a dispute between Sudan and Egypt over the sharing of the Nile, especially since the dam flooded part of Sudan and decreased the volume of water available to them. Ethiopia, also located on the Nile, took advantage of the Cold War tensions to request assistance from the United States for their own irrigation and hydropower investments in the 1960s. While progress stalled due to the coup d&#x27;état of 1974 and following 17-year-long Ethiopian Civil War Ethiopia began construction on the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam in 2011.

Beyond the Nile, hydroelectric projects cover the rivers and lakes of Africa. The Inga powerplant on the Congo River had been discussed since Belgian colonization in the late 19th century, and was successfully built after independence. Mobutu&#x27;s government failed to regularly maintain the plants and their capacity declined until the 1995 formation of the Southern African Power Pool created a multi-national power grid and plant maintenance program. States with an abundance of hydropower, such as the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Ghana, frequently sell excess power to neighboring countries. Foreign actors such as Chinese hydropower companies have proposed a significant amount of new hydropower projects in Africa, and already funded and consulted on many others in countries like Mozambique and Ghana.

Small hydropower also played an important role in early 20th century electrification across Africa. In South Africa, small turbines powered gold mines and the first electric railway in the 1890s, and Zimbabwean farmers installed small hydropower stations in the 1930s. While interest faded as national grids improved in the second half of the century, 21st century national governments in countries including South Africa and Mozambique, as well as NGOs serving countries like Zimbabwe, have begun re-exploring small-scale hydropower to diversify power sources and improve rural electrification.

====Europe====
In the early 20th century, two major factors motivated the expansion of hydropower in Europe: in the northern countries of Norway and Sweden, high rainfall and mountains proved exceptional resources for abundant hydropower, and in the south, coal shortages pushed governments and utility companies to seek alternative power sources.

Early on, Switzerland dammed the Alpine rivers and the Swiss Rhine, creating, along with Italy and Scandinavia, a Southern Europe hydropower race. In Italy&#x27;s Po Valley, the main 20th-century transition was not the creation of hydropower but the transition from mechanical to electrical hydropower. 12,000 watermills churned in the Po watershed in the 1890s, but the first commercial hydroelectric plant, completed in 1898, signaled the end of the mechanical reign. These new large plants moved power away from rural mountainous areas to urban centers in the lower plain. Italy prioritized early near-nationwide electrification, almost entirely from hydropower, which powered its rise as a dominant European and imperial force. However, they failed to reach any conclusive standard for determining water rights before WWI.

Modern German hydropower dam construction was built on a history of small dams powering mines and mills in the 15th century. Some parts of the German industry relied more on waterwheels than steam until the 1870s. The German government did not set out building large dams such as the prewar Urft, Mohne, and Eder dams to expand hydropower: they mostly wanted to reduce flooding and improve navigation. However, hydropower quickly emerged as a bonus for all these dams, especially in the coal-poor south. Bavaria even achieved a statewide power grid by damming the Walchensee in 1924, inspired in part by loss of coal reserves after WWI.

Hydropower became a symbol of regional pride and distaste for northern &#x27;coal barons&#x27;, although the north also held strong enthusiasm for hydropower. Dam building rapidly increased after WWII, aiming to increase hydropower. However, conflict accompanied the dam building and spread of hydropower: agrarian interests suffered from decreased irrigation, small mills lost water flow, and different interest groups fought over where dams should be located, controlling who benefited and whose homes they drowned.

<text>A horse breed is a selectively bred population of domesticated horses, often with pedigrees recorded in a breed registry. However, the term is sometimes used in a broader sense to define landrace animals of a common phenotype located within a limited geographic region, or even feral &quot;breeds&quot; that are naturally selected. Depending on definition, hundreds of &quot;breeds&quot; exist today, developed for many different uses. Horse breeds are loosely divided into three categories based on general temperament: spirited &quot;hot bloods&quot; with speed and endurance; &quot;cold bloods,&quot; such as draft horses and some ponies, suitable for slow, heavy work; and &quot;warmbloods,&quot; developed from crosses between hot bloods and cold bloods, often focusing on creating breeds for specific riding purposes, particularly in Europe.

Horse breeds are groups of horses with distinctive characteristics that are transmitted consistently to their offspring, such as conformation, color, performance ability, or disposition. These inherited traits are usually the result of a combination of natural crosses and artificial selection methods aimed at producing horses for specific tasks. Certain breeds are known for certain talents. For example, Standardbreds are known for their speed in harness racing. Some breeds have been developed through centuries of crossings with other breeds, while others, such as the Morgan horse, originated from a single sire from which all current breed members descend. More than 300 horse breeds exist in the world today.

==Origin of breeds==
Modern horse breeds developed in response to a need for &quot;form to function&quot;, the necessity to develop certain physical characteristics to perform a certain type of work. Thus, powerful but refined breeds such as the Andalusian or the Lusitano developed in the Iberian Peninsula as riding horses that also had a great aptitude for dressage, while heavy draft horses such as the Clydesdale and the Shire developed out of a need to perform demanding farm work and pull heavy wagons. Ponies of all breeds originally developed mainly from the need for a working animal that could fulfill specific local draft and transportation needs while surviving in harsh environments. However, by the 20th century, many pony breeds had Arabian and other blood added to make a more refined pony suitable for riding. Other horse breeds developed specifically for light agricultural work, heavy and light carriage and road work, various equestrian disciplines, or simply as pets.

==Purebreds and registries==


Horses have been selectively bred since their domestication. However, the concept of purebred bloodstock and a controlled, written breed registry only became of significant importance in modern times. Today, the standards for defining and registration of different breeds vary. Sometimes, purebred horses are called &quot;Thoroughbreds&quot;, which is incorrect; &quot;Thoroughbred&quot; is a specific breed of horse, while a &quot;purebred&quot; is a horse (or any other animal) with a defined pedigree recognized by a breed registry.

An early example of people who practiced selective horse breeding were the Bedouin, who had a reputation for careful breeding practices, keeping extensive pedigrees of their Arabian horses and placing great value upon pure bloodlines. Though these pedigrees were originally transmitted by an oral tradition, written pedigrees of Arabian horses can be found that date to the 14th century. In the same period of the early Renaissance, the Carthusian monks of southern Spain bred horses and kept meticulous pedigrees of the best bloodstock; the lineage survives to this day in the Andalusian horse. One of the earliest formal registries was General Stud Book for Thoroughbreds, which began in 1791 and traced back to the Arabian stallions imported to England from the Middle East that became the foundation stallions for the breed.

Some breed registries have a closed stud book, where registration is based on pedigree, and no outside animals can gain admittance. For example, a registered Thoroughbred or Arabian must have two registered parents of the same breed.

Other breeds have a partially closed stud book, but still allow certain infusions from other breeds. For example, the modern Appaloosa must have at least one Appaloosa parent, but may also have a Quarter Horse, Thoroughbred, or Arabian parent, so long as the offspring exhibits appropriate color characteristics. The Quarter Horse normally requires both parents to be registered Quarter Horses, but allows &quot;Appendix&quot; registration of horses with one Thoroughbred parent, and the horse may earn its way to full registration by completing certain performance requirements.

Open stud books exist for horse breeds that either have not yet developed a rigorously defined standard phenotype, or for breeds that register animals that conform to an ideal via the process of passing a studbook selection process. Most of the warmblood breeds used in sport horse disciplines have open stud books to varying degrees. While pedigree is considered, outside bloodlines are admitted to the registry if the horses meet the set standard for the registry. These registries usually require a selection process involving judging of an individual animal&#x27;s quality, performance, and conformation before registration is finalized. A few &quot;registries,&quot; particularly some color breed registries, are very open and will allow membership of all horses that meet limited criteria, such as coat color and species, regardless of pedigree or conformation.

Breed registries also differ as to their acceptance or rejection of breeding technology. For example, all Jockey Club Thoroughbred registries require that a registered Thoroughbred be a product of a natural mating, so-called &quot;live cover&quot;. A foal born of two Thoroughbred parents, but by means of artificial insemination or embryo transfer, cannot be registered in the Thoroughbred studbook. However, since the advent of DNA testing to verify parentage, most breed registries now allow artificial insemination, embryo transfer, or both. The high value of stallions has helped with the acceptance of these techniques because they allow a stallion to breed more mares with each &quot;collection&quot; and greatly reduce the risk of injury during mating. Cloning of horses is highly controversial, and at the present time most mainstream breed registries will not accept cloned horses, though several cloned horses and mules have been produced. Such restrictions have led to legal challenges in the United States, sometime based on state law and sometimes based on antitrust laws.

==Hybrids==
Horses can crossbreed with other equine species to produce hybrids. These hybrid types are not breeds, but they resemble breeds in that crosses between certain horse breeds and other equine species produce characteristic offspring. The most common hybrid is the mule, a cross between a &quot;jack&quot; (male donkey) and a mare. A related hybrid, the hinny, is a cross between a stallion and a jenny (female donkey). Most other hybrids involve the zebra (see Zebroid). With rare exceptions, most equine hybrids are sterile and cannot reproduce. A notable exception is hybrid crosses between horses and &quot;Equus ferus przewalskii&quot;, commonly known as Przewalski&#x27;s horse.

<text>Horse breeding is reproduction in horses, and particularly the human-directed process of selective breeding of animals, particularly purebred horses of a given breed. Planned matings can be used to produce specifically desired characteristics in domesticated horses. Furthermore, modern breeding management and technologies can increase the rate of conception, a healthy pregnancy, and successful foaling.

== Terminology ==
The male parent of a horse, a stallion, is commonly known as the &quot;sire&quot; and the female parent, the mare, is called the &quot;dam&quot;. Both are genetically important, as each parent genes can be existent with a 50% probability in the foal. Contrary to popular misuse, &quot;colt&quot; refers to a young male horse only; &quot;filly&quot; is a young female. Though many horse owners may simply breed a family mare to a local stallion in order to produce a companion animal, most professional breeders use selective breeding to produce individuals of a given phenotype, or breed. Alternatively, a breeder could, using individuals of differing phenotypes, create a new breed with specific characteristics.

A horse is &quot;bred&quot; where it is foaled (born). Thus a colt conceived in England but foaled in the United States is regarded as being bred in the US. In some cases, most notably in the Thoroughbred breeding industry, American- and Canadian-bred horses may also be described by the state or province in which they are foaled. Some breeds denote the country, or state, where conception took place as the origin of the foal.

Similarly, the &quot;breeder&quot;, is the person who owned or leased the mare at the time of foaling. That individual may not have had anything to do with the mating of the mare. It is important to review each breed registry&#x27;s rules to determine which applies to any specific foal.

In the horse breeding industry, the term &quot;half-brother&quot; or &quot;half-sister&quot; only describes horses which have the same dam, but different sires. Horses with the same sire but different dams are simply said to be &quot;by the same sire&quot;, and no sibling relationship is implied. &quot;Full&quot; (or &quot;own&quot;) siblings have both the same dam and the same sire. The terms paternal half-sibling, and maternal half-sibling are also often used. Three-quarter siblings are horses out of the same dam, and are by sires that are either half-brothers (i.e. same dam) or who are by the same sire.

Thoroughbreds and Arabians are also classified through the &quot;distaff&quot; or direct female line, known as their &quot;family&quot; or &quot;&quot; line, tracing back to their taproot foundation bloodstock or the beginning of their respective stud books. The female line of descent always appears at the bottom of a tabulated pedigree and is therefore often known as the &quot;bottom line&quot;. In addition, the maternal grandfather of a horse has a special term: .

&quot;Linebreeding&quot; technically is the duplication of fourth-generation or more distant ancestors. However, the term is often used more loosely, describing horses with duplication of ancestors closer than the fourth generation. It also is sometimes used as a euphemism for the practice of inbreeding, a practice that is generally frowned upon by horse breeders, though used by some in an attempt to fix certain traits.

== Estrous cycle of the mare ==

The estrous cycle (also spelled oestrous) controls when a mare is sexually receptive toward a stallion, and helps to physically prepare the mare for conception. It generally occurs during the spring and summer months, although some mares may be sexually receptive into the late fall, and is controlled by the photoperiod (length of the day), the cycle first triggered when the days begin to lengthen. The estrous cycle lasts about 19–22 days, with the average being 21 days. As the days shorten, the mare returns to a period when she is not sexually receptive, known as anestrus. Anestrus – occurring in the majority of, but not all, mares – prevents the mare from conceiving in the winter months, as that would result in her foaling during the harshest part of the year, a time when it would be most difficult for the foal to survive.

This cycle contains 2 phases:
* Estrus, or Follicular, phase: 5–7 days in length, when the mare is sexually receptive to a stallion. Estrogen is secreted by the follicle. Ovulation occurs in the final 24–48 hours of estrus.
* Diestrus, or Luteal, phase: 14–15 days in length, the mare is not sexually receptive to the stallion. The corpus luteum secretes progesterone.

Depending on breed, on average, 16% of mares have double ovulations, allowing them to twin, though this does not affect the length of time of estrus or diestrus.

=== Effects on the reproductive system during the estrous cycle ===
Changes in hormone levels can have great effects on the physical characteristics of the reproductive organs of the mare, thereby preparing, or preventing, her from conceiving.
* Uterus: increased levels of estrogen during estrus cause edema within the uterus, making it feel heavier, and the uterus loses its tone. This edema decreases following ovulation, and the muscular tone increases. High levels of progesterone do not cause edema within the uterus. The uterus becomes flaccid during anestrus.
* Cervix: the cervix starts to relax right before estrus occurs, with maximal relaxation around the time of ovulation. The secretions of the cervix increase. High progesterone levels (during diestrus) cause the cervix to close and become toned.
* Vagina: the portion of the vagina near the cervix becomes engorged with blood right before estrus. The vagina becomes relaxed and secretions increase.
* Vulva: relaxes right before estrus begins. Becomes dry, and closes more tightly, during diestrus.

=== Hormones involved in the estrous cycle, during foaling, and after birth ===
The cycle is controlled by several hormones which regulate the estrous cycle, the mare&#x27;s behavior, and the reproductive system of the mare. The cycle begins when the increased day length causes the pineal gland to reduce the levels of melatonin, thereby allowing the hypothalamus to secrete GnRH.
* GnRH (Gonadotropin releasing hormone): secreted by the hypothalamus, causes the pituitary to release two gonadotrophins: LH and FSH.
* LH (Luteinizing hormone): levels are highest 2 days following ovulation, then slowly decrease over 4–5 days, dipping to their lowest levels 5–16 days after ovulation. Stimulates maturation of the follicle, which then in turn secretes estrogen. Unlike most mammals, the mare does not have an increase of LH right before ovulation.
* FSH (Follicle-stimulating hormone): secreted by the pituitary, causes the ovarian follicle to develop. Levels of FSH rise slightly at the end of estrus, but have their highest peak about 10 days before the next ovulation. FSH is inhibited by inhibin (see below), at the same time LH and estrogen levels rise, which prevents immature follicles from continuing their growth. Mares may however have multiple FSH waves during a single estrous cycle, and diestrus follicles resulting from a diestrus FSH wave are not uncommon, particularly in the height of the natural breeding season.
* Estrogen: secreted by the developing follicle, it causes the pituitary gland to secrete more LH (therefore, these 2 hormones are in a positive feedback loop). Additionally, it causes behavioral changes in the mare, making her more receptive toward the stallion, and causes physical changes in the cervix, uterus, and vagina to prepare the mare for conception (see above). Estrogen peaks 1–2 days before ovulation, and decreases within 2 days following ovulation.
* Inhibin: secreted by the developed follicle right before ovulation, &quot;turns off&quot; FSH, which is no longer needed now that the follicle is larger.
* Progesterone: prevents conception and decreases sexual receptibility of the mare to the stallion. Progesterone is therefore lowest during the estrus phase, and increases during diestrus. It decreases 12–15 days after ovulation, when the corpus luteum begins to decrease in size.
* Prostaglandin: secreted by the endrometrium 13–15 days following ovulation, causes luteolysis and prevents the corpus luteum from secreting progesterone
* eCG – equine chorionic gonadotropin – also called PMSG (pregnant mare serum gonadotropin): chorionic gonadotropins secreted if the mare conceives. First secreted by the endometrial cups around the 36th day of gestation, peaking around day 60, and decreasing after about 120 days of gestation. Also help to stimulate the growth of the fetal gonads.
* Prolactin: stimulates lactation
* Oxytocin: stimulates the uterus to contract

== Breeding and gestation ==

While horses in the wild mate and foal in mid to late spring, in the case of horses domestically bred for competitive purposes, especially horse racing, it is desirable that they be born as close to January 1 in the northern hemisphere or August 1 in the southern hemisphere as possible, so as to be at an advantage in size and maturity when competing against other horses in the same age group. When an early foal is desired, barn managers will put the mare &quot;under lights&quot; by keeping the barn lights on in the winter to simulate a longer day, thus bringing the mare into estrus sooner than she would in nature. Mares signal estrus and ovulation by urination in the presence of a stallion, raising the tail and revealing the vulva. A stallion, approaching with a high head, will usually nicker, nip and nudge the mare, as well as sniff her urine to determine her readiness for mating. During copulation, the stallion usually ejaculates after 6 to 8 pelvic thrusts.

Once fertilized, the oocyte (egg) remains in the oviduct for approximately 5.5 more days, and then descends into the uterus. The initial single cell combination is already dividing and by the time of entry into the uterus, the egg might have already reached the blastocyst stage.

The gestation period lasts for about eleven months, or about 340 days (normal average range 320–370 days). During the early days of pregnancy, the conceptus is mobile, moving about in the uterus until about day 16 when &quot;fixation&quot; occurs. Shortly after fixation, the embryo proper (so called up to about 35 days) will become visible on trans-rectal ultrasound (about day 21) and a heartbeat should be visible by about day 23. After the formation of the endometrial cups and early placentation is initiated (35–40 days of gestation) the terminology changes, and the embryo is referred to as a fetus. True implantation – invasion into the endometrium of any sort – does not occur until about day 35 of pregnancy with the formation of the endometrial cups, and true placentation (formation of the placenta) is not initiated until about day 40-45 and not completed until about 140 days of pregnancy. The fetus&#x27;s sex can be determined by day 70 of the gestation using ultrasound. Halfway through gestation the fetus is the size of between a rabbit and a beagle. The most dramatic fetal development occurs in the last 3 months of pregnancy when 60% of fetal growth occurs.

Colts are carried on average about 4 days longer than fillies.

=== Care of the pregnant mare ===
Domestic mares receive specific care and nutrition to ensure that they and their foals are healthy. Mares are given vaccinations against diseases such as the Rhinopneumonitis (EHV-1) virus (which can cause miscarriage) as well as vaccines for other conditions that may occur in a given region of the world. Pre-foaling vaccines are recommended 4–6 weeks prior to foaling to maximize the immunoglobulin content of the colostrum in the first milk. Mares are dewormed a few weeks prior to foaling, as the mare is the primary source of parasites for the foal.

Mares can be used for riding or driving during most of their pregnancy. Exercise is healthy, though should be moderated when a mare is heavily in foal. Exercise in excessively high temperatures has been suggested as being detrimental to pregnancy maintenance during the embryonic period; however ambient temperatures encountered during the research were in the region of 100 degrees F and the same results may not be encountered in regions with lower ambient temperatures.

During the first several months of pregnancy, the nutritional requirements do not increase significantly since the rate of growth of the fetus is very slow. However, during this time, the mare may be provided supplemental vitamins and minerals, particularly if forage quality is questionable. During the last 3–4 months of gestation, rapid growth of the fetus increases the mare&#x27;s nutritional requirements. Energy requirements during these last few months, and during the first few months of lactation are similar to those of a horse in full training. Trace minerals such as copper are extremely important, particularly during the tenth month of pregnancy, for proper skeletal formation. Many feeds designed for pregnant and lactating mares provide the careful balance required of increased protein, increased calories through extra fat as well as vitamins and minerals. Overfeeding the pregnant mare, particularly during early gestation, should be avoided, as excess weight may contribute to difficulties foaling or fetal/foal related problems.

== Foaling ==

Mares due to foal are usually separated from other horses, both for the benefit of the mare and the safety of the soon-to-be-delivered foal. In addition, separation allows the mare to be monitored more closely by humans for any problems that may occur while giving birth. In the northern hemisphere, a special foaling stall that is large and clutter free is frequently used, particularly by major breeding farms. Originally, this was due in part to a need for protection from the harsh winter climate present when mares foal early in the year, but even in moderate climates, such as Florida, foaling stalls are still common because they allow closer monitoring of mares. Smaller breeders often use a small pen with a large shed for foaling, or they may remove a wall between two box stalls in a small barn to make a large stall. In the milder climates seen in much of the southern hemisphere, most mares foal outside, often in a paddock built specifically for foaling, especially on the larger stud farms. Many stud farms worldwide employ technology to alert human managers when the mare is about to foal, including webcams, closed-circuit television, or assorted types of devices that alert a handler via a remote alarm when a mare lies down in a position to foal.

On the other hand, some breeders, particularly those in remote areas or with extremely large numbers of horses, may allow mares to foal out in a field amongst a herd, but may also see higher rates of foal and mare mortality in doing so.

Most mares foal at night or early in the morning, and prefer to give birth alone when possible. Labor is rapid, often no more than 30 minutes, and from the time the feet of the foal appear to full delivery is often only about 15 to 20 minutes. Once the foal is born, the mare will lick the newborn foal to clean it and help blood circulation. In a very short time, the foal will attempt to stand and get milk from its mother. A foal should stand and nurse within the first hour of life.

To create a bond with her foal, the mare licks and nuzzles the foal, enabling her to distinguish the foal from others. Some mares are aggressive when protecting their foals, and may attack other horses or unfamiliar humans that come near their newborns.

After birth, a foal&#x27;s navel is dipped in antiseptic to prevent infection. The foal is sometimes given an enema to help clear the meconium from its digestive tract. The newborn is monitored to ensure that it stands and nurses without difficulty. While most horse births happen without complications, many owners have first aid supplies prepared and a veterinarian on call in case of a birthing emergency. People who supervise foaling should also watch the mare to be sure that she passes the placenta in a timely fashion, and that it is complete with no fragments remaining in the uterus. Retained fetal membranes can cause a serious inflammatory condition (endometritis) and/or infection. If the placenta is not removed from the stall after it is passed, a mare will often eat it, an instinct from the wild, where blood would attract predators.

=== Foal care ===

Foals develop rapidly, and within a few hours a wild foal can travel with the herd. In domestic breeding, the foal and dam are usually separated from the herd for a while, but within a few weeks are typically pastured with the other horses. A foal will begin to eat hay, grass and grain alongside the mare at about 4 weeks old; by 10–12 weeks the foal requires more nutrition than the mare&#x27;s milk can supply. Foals are typically weaned at 4–8 months of age, although in the wild a foal may nurse for a year.

== How breeds develop ==

Beyond the appearance and conformation of a specific type of horse, breeders aspire to improve physical performance abilities. This concept, known as matching &quot;form to function,&quot; has led to the development of not only different breeds, but also families or bloodlines within breeds that are specialists for excelling at specific tasks.

For example, the Arabian horse of the desert naturally developed speed and endurance to travel long distances and survive in a harsh environment, and domestication by humans added a trainable disposition to the animal&#x27;s natural abilities. In the meantime, in northern Europe, the locally adapted heavy horse with a thick, warm coat was domesticated and put to work as a farm animal that could pull a plow or wagon. This animal was later adapted through selective breeding to create a strong but rideable animal suitable for the heavily armored knight in warfare.

Then, centuries later, when people in Europe wanted faster horses than could be produced from local horses through simple selective breeding, they imported Arabians and other oriental horses to breed as an outcross to the heavier, local animals. This led to the development of breeds such as the Thoroughbred, a horse taller than the Arabian and faster over the distances of a few miles required of a European race horse or light cavalry horse. Another cross between oriental and European horses produced the Andalusian, a horse developed in Spain that was powerfully built, but extremely nimble and capable of the quick bursts of speed over short distances necessary for certain types of combat as well as for tasks such as bullfighting.

Later, the people who settled America needed a hardy horse that was capable of working with cattle. Thus, Arabians and Thoroughbreds were crossed on Spanish horses, both domesticated animals descended from those brought over by the Conquistadors, and feral horses such as the Mustangs, descended from the Spanish horse, but adapted by natural selection to the ecology and climate of the west. These crosses ultimately produced new breeds such as the American Quarter Horse and the Criollo of Argentina. In Canada, the Canadian Horse descended from the French stock Louis XIV sent to Canada in the late 17th century.[6] The initial shipment, in 1665, consisted of two stallions and twenty mares from the Royal Stables in Normandy and Brittany, the centre of French horse breeding.[7] Only 12 of the 20 mares survived the trip. Two more shipments followed, one in 1667 of 14 horses (mostly mares, but with at least one stallion), and one in 1670 of 11 mares and a stallion. The shipments included a mix of draft horses and light horses, the latter of which included both pacing and trotting horses.[1] The exact origins of all the horses are unknown, although the shipments probably included Bretons, Normans, Arabians, Andalusians and Barbs.

In modern times, these breeds themselves have since been selectively bred to further specialize at certain tasks. One example of this is the American Quarter Horse. Once a general-purpose working ranch horse, different bloodlines now specialize in different events. For example, larger, heavier animals with a very steady attitude are bred to give competitors an advantage in events such as team roping, where a horse has to start and stop quickly, but also must calmly hold a full-grown steer at the end of a rope. On the other hand, for an event known as cutting, where the horse must separate a cow from a herd and prevent it from rejoining the group, the best horses are smaller, quick, alert, athletic and highly trainable. They must learn quickly, have conformation that allows quick stops and fast, low turns, and the best competitors have a certain amount of independent mental ability to anticipate and counter the movement of a cow, popularly known as &quot;cow sense.&quot;

Another example is the Thoroughbred. While most representatives of this breed are bred for horse racing, there are also specialized bloodlines suitable as show hunters or show jumpers. The hunter must have a tall, smooth build that allows it to trot and canter smoothly and efficiently. Instead of speed, value is placed on appearance and upon giving the equestrian a comfortable ride, with natural jumping ability that shows bascule and good form.

A show jumper, however, is bred less for overall form and more for power over tall fences, along with speed, scope, and agility. This favors a horse with a good galloping stride, powerful hindquarters that can change speed or direction easily, plus a good shoulder angle and length of neck. A jumper has a more powerful build than either the hunter or the racehorse.

== History of horse breeding ==
The history of horse breeding goes back millennia. Though the precise date is in dispute, humans could have domesticated the horse as far back as approximately 4500 BCE. However, evidence of planned breeding has a more blurry history. It is well known, for example, that the Romans did breed horses and valued them in their armies, but little is known regarding their breeding and husbandry practices: all that remains are statues and artwork. Mankind has plenty of equestrian statues of Roman emperors, horses are mentioned in the Odyssey by Homer, and hieroglyphics and paintings left behind by Egyptians tell stories of pharaohs hunting elephants from chariots. Nearly nothing is known of what became of the horses they bred for hippodromes, for warfare, or even for farming.

One of the earliest people known to document the breedings of their horses were the Bedouin of the Middle East, the breeders of the Arabian horse. While it is difficult to determine how far back the Bedouin passed on pedigree information via an oral tradition, there were written pedigrees of Arabian horses by CE 1330. The Akhal-Teke of West-Central Asia is another breed with roots in ancient times that was also bred specifically for war and racing. The nomads of the Mongolian steppes bred horses for several thousand years as well, and the Caspian horse is believed to be a very close relative of Ottoman horses from the earliest origins of the Turks in Central Asia.

The types of horse bred varied with culture and with the times. The uses to which a horse was put also determined its qualities, including smooth amblers for riding, fast horses for carrying messengers, heavy horses for plowing and pulling heavy wagons, ponies for hauling cars of ore from mines, packhorses, carriage horses and many others.

Medieval Europe bred large horses specifically for war, called destriers. These horses were the ancestors of the great heavy horses of today, and their size was preferred not simply because of the weight of the armor, but also because a large horse provided more power for the knight&#x27;s lance. Weighing almost twice as much as a normal riding horse, the destrier was a powerful weapon in battle meant to act like a giant battering ram that could quite literally run down men on an enemy line.

On the other hand, during this same time, lighter horses were bred in northern Africa and the Middle East, where a faster, more agile horse was preferred. The lighter horse suited the raids and battles of desert people, allowing them to outmaneuver rather than overpower the enemy. When Middle Eastern warriors and European knights collided in warfare, the heavy knights were frequently outmaneuvered. The Europeans, however, responded by crossing their native breeds with &quot;oriental&quot; type horses such as the Arabian, Barb, and Turkoman horse This cross-breeding led both to a nimbler war horse, such as today&#x27;s Andalusian horse, but also created a type of horse known as a Courser, a predecessor to the Thoroughbred, which was used as a message horse.

During the Renaissance, horses were bred not only for war, but for haute ecole riding, derived from the most athletic movements required of a war horse, and popular among the elite nobility of the time. Breeds such as the Lipizzan and the now extinct Neapolitan horse were developed from Spanish-bred horses for this purpose, and also became the preferred mounts of cavalry officers, who were derived mostly from the ranks of the nobility. It was during this time that firearms were developed, and so the light cavalry horse, a faster and quicker war horse, was bred for &quot;shoot and run&quot; tactics rather than the shock action as in the Middle Ages. Fine horses usually had a well muscled, curved neck, slender body, and sweeping mane, as the nobility liked to show off their wealth and breeding in paintings of the era.

After Charles II retook the British throne in 1660, horse racing, which had been banned by Cromwell, was revived. The Thoroughbred was developed 40 years later, bred to be the ultimate racehorse, through the lines of three foundation Arabian stallions and one Turkish horse.

In the 18th century, James Burnett, Lord Monboddo noted the importance of selecting appropriate parentage to achieve desired outcomes of successive generations. Monboddo worked more broadly in the abstract thought of species relationships and evolution of species. The Thoroughbred breeding hub in Lexington, Kentucky was developed in the late 18th century, and became a mainstay in American racehorse breeding.

The 17th and 18th centuries saw more of a need for fine carriage horses in Europe, bringing in the dawn of the warmblood. The warmblood breeds have been exceptionally good at adapting to changing times, and from their coach horse beginnings they easily transitioned during the 20th century into a sport horse type. Today&#x27;s warmblood breeds are frequently used in competitive driving, but are more often seen competing in show jumping or dressage.

The Thoroughbred continues to dominate the horse racing world, although its lines have been more recently used to improve warmblood breeds and to develop sport horses. The French saddle horse is an excellent example as is the Irish Sport Horse, the latter being an unusual combination between a Thoroughbred and a draft breed.

The American Quarter Horse was developed early in the 18th century, mainly for quarter racing (racing ¼ of a mile). Colonists did not have racetracks or any of the trappings of Europe that the earliest Thoroughbreds had at their disposal, so instead the owners of Quarter Horses would run their horses on roads that lead through town as a form of local entertainment. As the USA expanded West, the breed went with settlers as a farm and ranch animal, and &quot;cow sense&quot; was particularly valued: their use for herding cattle increased on rough, dry terrain that often involved sitting in the saddle for long hours.

However, this did not mean that the original ¼-mile races that colonists held ever went out of fashion, so today there are three types: the stock horse type, the racer, and the more recently evolving sport type. The racing type most resembles the finer-boned ancestors of the first racing Quarter Horses, and the type is still used for ¼-mile races. The stock horse type, used in western events and as a farm and patrol animal is bred for a shorter stride, an ability to stop and turn quickly, and an unflappable attitude that remains calm and focused even in the face of an angry charging steer. The first two are still to this day bred to have a combination of explosive speed that exceeds the Thoroughbred on short distances clocked as high as 55 mph, but they still retain the gentle, calm, and kindly temperament of their ancestors that makes them easily handled.

The Canadian horse&#x27;s origin corresponds to shipments of French horses, some of which came from Louis XIV&#x27;s own stable and most likely were Baroque horses meant to be gentlemen&#x27;s mounts. These were ill-suited to farm work and to the hardscrabble life of the New World, so like the Americans, early Canadians crossed their horses with natives escapees. In time they evolved along similar lines as the Quarter Horse to the South as both the US and Canada spread westward and needed a calm and tractable horse versatile enough to carry the farmer&#x27;s son to school but still capable of running fast and running hard as a cavalry horse, a stockhorse, or a horse to pull a conestoga wagon.

Other horses from North America retained a hint of their mustang origins by being either derived from stock that Native Americans bred that came in a rainbow of color, like the Appaloosa and American Paint Horse, with those East of the Mississippi River increasingly bred to impress and mimic the trends of the upper classes of Europe: The Tennessee Walking Horse and Saddlebred were originally plantation horses bred for their gait and comfortable ride in the saddle as a plantation master would survey his vast lands like an English lord.

Horses were needed for heavy draft and carriage work until replaced by the automobile, truck, and tractor. After this time, draft and carriage horse numbers dropped significantly, though light riding horses remained popular for recreational pursuits. Draft horses today are used on a few small farms, but today are seen mainly for pulling and plowing competitions rather than farm work. Heavy harness horses are now used as an outcross with lighter breeds, such as the Thoroughbred, to produce the modern warmblood breeds popular in sport horse disciplines, particularly at the Olympic level.

== Deciding to breed a horse ==
Breeding a horse is an endeavor where the owner, particularly of the mare, will usually need to invest considerable time and money. For this reason, a horse owner needs to consider several factors, including:
* Does the proposed breeding animal have valuable genetic qualities to pass on?
* Is the proposed breeding animal in good physical health, fertile, and able to withstand the rigors of reproduction?
* For what purpose will the foal be used?
* Is there a market for the foal if the owner does not wish to keep the foal for its entire life?
* What is the anticipated economic benefit, if any, to the owner of the ensuing foal?
* What is the anticipated economic benefit, if any, to the owner(s) of the sire and dam or the foal?
* Does the owner of the mare have the expertise to properly manage the mare through gestation and parturition?
* Does the owner of the potential foal have the expertise to properly manage and train a young animal once it is born?

There are value judgements involved in considering whether an animal is suitable breeding stock, hotly debated by breeders. Additional personal beliefs may come into play when considering a suitable level of care for the mare and ensuing foal, the potential market or use for the foal, and other tangible and intangible benefits to the owner.

If the breeding endeavor is intended to make a profit, there are additional market factors to consider, which may vary considerably from year to year, from breed to breed, and by region of the world. In many cases, the low end of the market is saturated with horses, and the law of supply and demand thus allows little or no profit to be made from breeding unregistered animals or animals of poor quality, even if registered.

The minimum cost of breeding for a mare owner includes the stud fee, and the cost of proper nutrition, management and veterinary care of the mare throughout gestation, parturition, and care of both mare and foal up to the time of weaning. Veterinary expenses may be higher if specialized reproductive technologies are used or health complications occur.

Making a profit in horse breeding is often difficult. While some owners of only a few horses may keep a foal for purely personal enjoyment, many individuals breed horses in hopes of making some money in the process.

A rule of thumb is that a foal intended for sale should be worth three times the cost of the stud fee if it were sold at the moment of birth. From birth forward, the costs of care and training are added to the value of the foal, with a sale price going up accordingly. If the foal wins awards in some form of competition, that may also enhance the price.

On the other hand, without careful thought, foals bred without a potential market for them may wind up being sold at a loss, and in a worst-case scenario, sold for &quot;salvage&quot; value—a euphemism for sale to slaughter as horsemeat.

Therefore, a mare owner must consider their reasons for breeding, asking hard questions of themselves as to whether their motivations are based on either emotion or profit and how realistic those motivations may be.

== Choosing breeding stock ==

The stallion should be chosen to complement the mare, with the goal of producing a foal that has the best qualities of both animals, yet avoids having the weaker qualities of either parent. Generally, the stallion should have proven himself in the discipline or sport the mare owner wishes for the &quot;career&quot; of the ensuing foal. Mares should also have a competition record showing that they also have suitable traits, though this does not happen as often.

Some breeders consider the quality of the sire to be more important than the quality of the dam. However, other breeders maintain that the mare is the most important parent. Because stallions can produce far more offspring than mares, a single stallion can have a greater overall impact on a breed. Research from Nagoya University supports the belief that the most important factor affecting a thoroughbred&#x27;s race performance is the quality of its sire, whereas the effect of the age of its broodmare is negligible. However, the mare may have a greater influence on an individual foal because its physical characteristics influence the developing foal in the womb and the foal also learns habits from its dam when young. Foals may also learn the &quot;language of intimidation and submission&quot; from their dam, and this imprinting may affect the foal&#x27;s status and rank within the herd. Many times, a mature horse will achieve status in a herd similar to that of its dam; the offspring of dominant mares become dominant themselves. (See also Horse behavior.)

A purebred horse is usually worth more than a horse of mixed breeding, though this matters more in some disciplines than others. The breed of the horse is sometimes secondary when breeding for a sport horse, but some disciplines may prefer a certain breed or a specific phenotype of horse. Sometimes, purebred bloodlines are an absolute requirement: For example, most racehorses in the world must be recorded with a breed registry in order to race.

Bloodlines are often considered, as some bloodlines are known to cross well with others. If the parents have not yet proven themselves by competition or by producing quality offspring, the bloodlines of the horse are often a good indicator of quality and possible strengths and weaknesses. Some bloodlines are known not only for their athletic ability, but could also carry a conformational or genetic defect, poor temperament, or for a medical problem. Some bloodlines are also fashionable or otherwise marketable, which is an important consideration should the mare owner wish to sell the foal.

Horse breeders also consider conformation, size and temperament. All of these traits are heritable, and will determine if the foal will be a success in its chosen discipline. The offspring, or &quot;get&quot;, of a stallion are often excellent indicators of his ability to pass on his characteristics, and the particular traits he actually passes on. Some stallions are fantastic performers but never produce offspring of comparable quality. Others sire fillies of great abilities but not colts. At times, a horse of mediocre ability sires foals of outstanding quality.

Mare owners also look into the question of if the stallion is fertile and has successfully &quot;settled&quot; (i.e. impregnated) mares. A stallion may not be able to breed naturally, or old age may decrease his performance. Mare care boarding fees and semen collection fees can be a major cost.

== Costs related to breeding ==
Breeding a horse can be an expensive endeavor, whether breeding a backyard competition horse or the next Olympic medalist. Costs may include:
* The stud and booking fee
* Fees for collecting, handling, and transporting semen (if AI is used and semen is shipped)
* Mare exams: to determine if she is healthy enough to breed, to determine when she ovulates, and (if AI is used) to inseminate her
* Mare transport, care, and board if the mare is bred live cover at the stallion&#x27;s residence
* Veterinary bills to keep the pregnant mare healthy while in foal
* Possible veterinary bills during pregnancy or foaling should something go wrong
* Veterinary bills for the foal for its first exam a few days following foaling

Stud fees are determined by the quality of the stallion, his performance record, the performance record of his get (offspring), as well as the sport and general market that the animal is standing for.

The highest stud fees are generally for racing Thoroughbreds, which may charge from two to three thousand dollars for a breeding to a new or unproven stallion, to several hundred thousand dollars for a breeding to a proven producer of stakes winners. Stallions in other disciplines often have stud fees that begin in the range of $1,000 to $3,000, with top contenders who produce champions in certain disciplines able to command as much as $20,000 for one breeding. The lowest stud fees to breed to a grade horse or an animal of low-quality pedigree may only be $100–$200, but there are trade-offs: the horse will probably be unproven, and likely to produce lower-quality offspring than a horse with a stud fee that is in the typical range for quality breeding stock.

As a stallion&#x27;s career, either performance or breeding, improves, his stud fee tends to increase in proportion. If one or two offspring are especially successful, winning several stakes races or an Olympic medal, the stud fee will generally greatly increase. Younger, unproven stallions will generally have a lower stud fee earlier on in their careers.

To help decrease the risk of financial loss should the mare die or abort the foal while pregnant, many studs have a live foal guarantee (LFG) – also known as &quot;no foal, free return&quot; or &quot;NFFR&quot; - allowing the owner to have a free breeding to their stallion the next year. However, this is not offered for every breeding.

== Covering the mare ==

There are two general ways to &quot;cover&quot; or breed the mare:
* Live cover: the mare is brought to the stallion&#x27;s residence and is covered &quot;live&quot; in the breeding shed. She may also be turned out in a pasture with the stallion for several days to breed naturally (&#x27;pasture bred&#x27;). The former situation is often preferred, as it provides a more controlled environment, allowing the breeder to ensure that the mare was covered, and places the handlers in a position to remove the horses from one another should one attempt to kick or bite the other. However, this causes more stress for the mare as she feels like she is being forced to undergo this procedure. 
* Artificial Insemination (AI): the mare is inseminated by a veterinarian or an equine reproduction manager, using either fresh, cooled or frozen semen. 

After the mare is bred or artificially inseminated, she is checked using ultrasound 14–16 days later to see if she &quot;took&quot;, and is pregnant. A second check is usually performed at 28 days. If the mare is not pregnant, she may be bred again during her next cycle.

It is considered safe to breed a mare to a stallion of much larger size. Because of the mare&#x27;s type of placenta and its attachment and blood supply, the foal will be limited in its growth within the uterus to the size of the mare&#x27;s uterus, but will grow to its genetic potential after it is born. Test breedings have been done with draft horse stallions bred to small mares with no increase in the number of difficult births.

=== Live cover ===

When breeding live cover, the mare is usually boarded at the stud. She may be &quot;teased&quot; several times with a stallion that will not breed to her, usually with the stallion being presented to the mare over a barrier. Her reaction to the teaser, whether hostile or passive, is noted. A mare that is in heat will generally tolerate a teaser (although this is not always the case), and may present herself to him, holding her tail to the side. A veterinarian may also determine if the mare is ready to be bred, by ultrasound or palpating daily to determine if ovulation has occurred. Live cover can also be done in liberty on a paddock or on pasture, although due to safety and efficacy concerns, it is not common at professional breeding farms.

When it has been determined that the mare is ready, both the mare and intended stud will be cleaned. The mare will then be presented to the stallion, usually with one handler controlling the mare and one or more handlers in charge of the stallion. Multiple handlers are preferred, as the mare and stallion can be easily separated should there be any trouble.

The Jockey Club, the organization that oversees the Thoroughbred industry in the United States, requires all registered foals to be bred through live cover. Artificial insemination, listed below, is not permitted. Similar rules apply in other countries, such as Australia.

By contrast, the U.S. standardbred industry allows registered foals to be bred by live cover, or by artificial insemination (AI) with fresh or frozen (not dried) semen. No other artificial fertility treatment is allowed. In addition, foals bred via AI of frozen semen may only be registered if the stallion&#x27;s sperm was collected during his lifetime, and used no later than the calendar year of his death or castration.

=== Artificial insemination ===

Whereas the various national Thoroughbred associations typically require live cover, by 2009 most horse breeds allowed for the artificial insemination of mares with cooled, frozen or even fresh semen.

Artificial insemination (AI) has several advantages over live cover, and has a very similar conception rate:
* The mare and stallion never have to come in contact with each other, which therefore reduces breeding accidents, such as the mare kicking the stallion.
* AI opens up the world to international breeding, as semen may be shipped across continents to mares that would otherwise be unable to breed to a particular stallion.
* A mare also does not have to travel to the stallion, so the process is less stressful on her, and if she already has a foal, the foal does not have to travel.
* AI allows more mares to be bred from one stallion, as the ejaculate may be split between mares.
* AI reduces the chance of spreading sexually transmitted diseases between mare and stallion.
* AI allows mares or stallions with health issues, such as sore hocks which may prevent a stallion from mounting, to continue to breed.
* Frozen semen may be stored and used to breed mares even after the stallion is dead, allowing his lines to continue. However, the semen of some stallions does not freeze well. Some breed registries may not permit the registration of foals resulting from the use of frozen semen after the stallion&#x27;s death, although other large registries accept such usage and provide registrations. The overall trend is toward permitting use of frozen semen after the death of the stallion.

A stallion is usually trained to mount a phantom (or dummy) mare, although a live mare may be used, and he is most commonly collected using an artificial vagina (AV) which is heated to simulate the vagina of the mare. The AV has a filter and collection area at one end to capture the semen, which can then be processed in a lab. The semen may be chilled or frozen and shipped to the mare owner or used to breed mares &quot;on-farm&quot;. When the mare is in heat, the person inseminating introduces the semen directly into her uterus using a syringe and pipette.

=== Advanced reproductive techniques ===
Often an owner does not want to take a valuable competition mare out of training to carry a foal. This presents a problem, as the mare will usually be quite old by the time she is retired from her competitive career, at which time it is more difficult to impregnate her. Other times, a mare may have physical problems that prevent or discourage breeding. However, there are now several options for breeding these mares. These options also allow a mare to produce multiple foals each breeding season, instead of the usual one. Therefore, mares may have an even greater value for breeding.
* Embryo transfer: This relatively new method involves flushing out the mare&#x27;s fertilized embryo a few days following insemination, and transferring to a surrogate mare, which has been synchronized to be in the same phase of the estrous cycle as the donor mare.
* Gamete intrafallopian transfer (GIFT): The mare&#x27;s ovum and the stallion&#x27;s sperm are deposited in the oviduct of a surrogate dam. This technique is very useful for subfertile stallions, as fewer sperm are needed, so a stallion with a low sperm count can still successfully breed.
* Egg transfer: An oocyte is removed from the mare&#x27;s follicle and transferred into the oviduct of the recipient mare, who is then bred. This is best for mares with physical problems, such as an obstructed oviduct, that prevent breeding.
* Intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI): Used in horses due to lack of successful co-incubation of female and male gametes in simple IVF. A plug of the zona pellucida is removed and a single sperm cell is injected into the ooplasm of the mature oocyte. An advantage of ICSI over IVF is that lower quality sperm can be used since the sperm does not have to penetrate the zona pellucida. The success rate of ICSI is 23-44% blastocyst development.

The world&#x27;s first cloned horse, Prometea, was born in 2003. Other notable instances of horse cloning are:
* In 2006, Scamper, an extremely successful barrel racing horse, a gelding, was cloned. The resulting stallion, Clayton, became the first cloned horse to stand at stud in the U.S.
* In 2007, a renowned show jumper and Thoroughbred, Gem Twist, was cloned by Frank Chapot and his family. In September 2008, Gemini was born. Other clones followed, leading to the development of a breeding line from Gem Twist. 
* In 2010, the first lived equine cloned of a Criollo horse was born in Argentina, and was the first horse clone produced in Latin America. In the same year a cloned polo horse was sold for $800,000 - the highest known price ever paid for a polo horse. 
* In 2013, the world-famous polo star Adolfo Cambiaso helped his high-handicap team La Dolfina win the Argentine National Open, scoring nine goals in the 16-11 match. Two of those he scored atop a horse named Show Me, a clone, and the first to ride onto the Argentine pitch.

<doc id="14084" wikidata="Q1035954" url="?curid=14084" title="Heterosexuality">
<text>Heterosexuality is romantic attraction, sexual attraction or sexual behavior between people of the opposite sex or gender. As a sexual orientation, heterosexuality is &quot;an enduring pattern of emotional, romantic, and/or sexual attractions&quot; to people of the opposite sex. It &quot;also refers to a person&#x27;s sense of identity based on those attractions, related behaviors, and membership in a community of others who share those attractions.&quot; Someone who is heterosexual is commonly referred to as &quot;straight.&quot;

Along with bisexuality and homosexuality, heterosexuality is one of the three main categories of sexual orientation within the heterosexual–homosexual continuum. Across cultures, most people are heterosexual, and heterosexual activity is by far the most common type of sexual activity. Throughout the civilization, heterosexuality has mostly been viewed as the normative and most socially dominant form of sexual orientation.

Scientists do not know the exact cause of sexual orientation, but they theorize that it is caused by a complex interplay of genetic, hormonal, and environmental influences, and do not view it as a choice. Although no single theory on the cause of sexual orientation has yet gained widespread support, scientists favor biologically based theories. There is considerably more evidence supporting nonsocial, biological causes of sexual orientation than social ones, especially for males.

The term &quot;heterosexual&quot; or &quot;heterosexuality&quot; is usually applied to humans, but heterosexual behavior is observed in all other mammals and in other animals, as it is necessary for sexual reproduction.

== Terminology ==
&quot;Hetero-&quot; comes from the Greek word &quot;ἕτερος&quot; [héteros], meaning &quot;other party&quot; or &quot;another&quot;, used in science as a prefix meaning &quot;different&quot;; and the Latin word for sex (that is, characteristic sex or sexual differentiation).

The current use of the term &quot;heterosexual&quot; has its roots in the broader 19th century tradition of personality taxonomy. The term &quot;heterosexual&quot; was coined alongside the word &quot;homosexual&quot; by Karl Maria Kertbeny in 1869. The terms were not in current use during the late nineteenth century, but were reintroduced by Richard von Krafft-Ebing and Albert Moll around 1890. The noun came into wider use from the early 1920s, but did not enter common use until the 1960s. The colloquial shortening &quot;hetero&quot; is attested from 1933. The abstract noun &quot;heterosexuality&quot; is first recorded in 1900. The word &quot;heterosexual&quot; was listed in Merriam-Webster&#x27;s &quot;New International Dictionary&quot; in 1923 as a medical term for &quot;morbid sexual passion for one of the opposite sex&quot;; however, in 1934 in their &quot;Second Edition Unabridged&quot; it is defined as a &quot;manifestation of sexual passion for one of the opposite sex; normal sexuality&quot;.

Hyponyms of heterosexual include &quot;heteroflexible&quot;.

The word can be informally shortened to &quot;hetero&quot;. The term &quot;straight&quot; originated as a mid-20th century gay slang term for heterosexuals, ultimately coming from the phrase &quot;to go straight&quot; (as in &quot;straight and narrow&quot;), or stop engaging in homosexual sex. One of the first uses of the word in this way was in 1941 by author G. W. Henry. Henry&#x27;s book concerned conversations with homosexual males and used this term in connection with people who are identified as ex-gays. It is now simply a colloquial term for &quot;heterosexual&quot;, having changed in primary meaning over time. Some object to usage of the term &quot;straight&quot; because it implies that non-heterosexual people are crooked.

==Demographics ==

In their 2016 literature review, Bailey &quot;et al.&quot; stated that they &quot;expect that in all cultures the vast majority of individuals are sexually predisposed exclusively to the other sex (i.e., heterosexual)&quot; and that there is no persuasive evidence that the demographics of sexual orientation have varied much across time or place. Heterosexual activity between only one male and one female is by far the most common type of sociosexual activity.

According to several major studies, 89% to 98% of people have had only heterosexual contact within their lifetime; but this percentage falls to 79–84% when either or both same-sex attraction and behavior are reported.

A 1992 study reported that 93.9% of males in Britain have only had heterosexual experience, while in France the number was reported at 95.9%. According to a 2008 poll, 85% of Britons have only opposite-sex sexual contact while 94% of Britons identify themselves as heterosexual. Similarly, a survey by the UK Office for National Statistics (ONS) in 2010 found that 95% of Britons identified as heterosexual, 1.5% of Britons identified themselves as homosexual or bisexual, and the last 3.5% gave more vague answers such as &quot;don&#x27;t know&quot;, &quot;other&quot;, or did not respond to the question. In the United States, according to a Williams Institute report in April 2011, 96% or approximately 250 million of the adult population are heterosexual.

An October 2012 Gallup poll provided unprecedented demographic information about those who identify as heterosexual, arriving at the conclusion that 96.6%, with a margin of error of ±1%, of all U.S. adults identify as heterosexual. The Gallup results show:

In a 2015 YouGov survey of 1,000 adults of the United States, 89% of the sample identified as heterosexual, 4% as homosexual (2% as homosexual male and 2% as homosexual female) and 4% as bisexual (of either sex).

Bailey &quot;et al.&quot;, in their 2016 review, stated that in recent Western surveys, about 93% of men and 87% of women identify as completely heterosexual, and about 4% of men and 10% of women as mostly heterosexual.

=== Biological and environmental===

No simple and singular determinant for sexual orientation has been conclusively demonstrated, but scientists believe that a combination of genetic, hormonal, and environmental factors determine sexual orientation. They favor biological theories for explaining the causes of sexual orientation, as there is considerably more evidence supporting nonsocial, biological causes than social ones, especially for males.

Factors related to the development of a heterosexual orientation include genes, prenatal hormones, and brain structure, and their interaction with the environment.

==== Prenatal hormones ====

The neurobiology of the masculinization of the brain is fairly well understood. Estradiol and testosterone, which is catalyzed by the enzyme 5α-reductase into dihydrotestosterone, act upon androgen receptors in the brain to masculinize it. If there are few androgen receptors (people with androgen insensitivity syndrome) or too much androgen (females with congenital adrenal hyperplasia), there can be physical and psychological effects. It has been suggested that both male and female heterosexuality are the results of this process. In these studies heterosexuality in females is linked to a lower amount of masculinization than is found in lesbian females, though when dealing with male heterosexuality there are results supporting both higher and lower degrees of masculinization than homosexual males.

==== Animals and reproduction ====


Sexual reproduction in the animal world is facilitated through opposite-sex sexual activity, although there are also animals that reproduce asexually, including protozoa and lower invertebrates.

Reproductive sex does not require a heterosexual orientation, since sexual orientation typically refers to a long-term enduring pattern of sexual and emotional attraction leading often to long-term social bonding, while reproduction requires as little as a single act of copulation to fertilize the ovum by sperm.

===Sexual fluidity===

Often, sexual orientation and sexual orientation identity are not distinguished, which can impact accurately assessing sexual identity and whether or not sexual orientation is able to change; sexual orientation identity can change throughout an individual&#x27;s life, and may or may not align with biological sex, sexual behavior or actual sexual orientation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Concordance/discordance in SO&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Sexual orientation is stable and unlikely to change for the vast majority of people, but some research indicates that some people may experience change in their sexual orientation, and this is more likely for women than for men. The American Psychological Association distinguishes between sexual orientation (an innate attraction) and sexual orientation identity (which may change at any point in a person&#x27;s life).

A 2012 study found that 2% of a sample of 2,560 adult participants reported a change of sexual orientation identity after a 10-year period. For men, a change occurred in 0.78% of those who had identified as heterosexual, 9.52% of homosexuals, and 47% of bisexuals. For women, a change occurred in 1.36% of heterosexuals, 63.6% of lesbians, and 64.7% of bisexuals.

A 2-year study by Lisa M. Diamond on a sample of 80 non-heterosexual female adolescents (age 16–23) reported that half of the participants had changed sexual-minority identities more than once, one third of them during the 2-year follow-up. Diamond concluded that &quot;although sexual attractions appear fairly stable, sexual identities and behaviors are more fluid.&quot;

Heteroflexibility is a form of sexual orientation or situational sexual behavior characterized by minimal homosexual activity in an otherwise primarily heterosexual orientation that is considered to distinguish it from bisexuality. It has been characterized as &quot;mostly straight&quot;.

===Sexual orientation change efforts===

Sexual orientation change efforts are methods that aim to change sexual orientation, used to try to convert homosexual and bisexual people to heterosexuality. Scientists and mental health professionals generally do not believe that sexual orientation is a choice. There are no studies of adequate scientific rigor that conclude that sexual orientation change efforts are effective.

== Society and culture ==

A heterosexual couple, a man and woman in an intimate relationship, form the core of a nuclear family.
Many societies throughout history have insisted that a marriage take place before the couple settle down, but enforcement of this rule or compliance with it has varied considerably.

=== Symbolism ===
Heterosexual symbolism dates back to the earliest artifacts of humanity, with gender symbols, ritual fertility carvings, and primitive art. This was later expressed in the symbolism of fertility rites and polytheistic worship, which often included images of human reproductive organs, such as lingam in Hinduism. Modern symbols of heterosexuality in societies derived from European traditions still reference symbols used in these ancient beliefs. One such image is a combination of the symbol for Mars, the Roman god of war, as the definitive male symbol of masculinity, and Venus, the Roman goddess of love and beauty, as the definitive female symbol of femininity. The unicode character for this combined symbol is ⚤ (U+26A4).

===Historical views===
There was no need to coin a term such as &quot;heterosexual&quot; until terms emerged with which it could be compared and contrasted. Jonathan Ned Katz dates the definition of heterosexuality, as it is used today, to the late 19th century. According to Katz, in the Victorian era, sex was seen as a means to achieve reproduction, and relations between the sexes were not believed to be overtly sexual. The body was thought of as a tool for procreation – &quot;Human energy, thought of as a closed and severely limited system, was to be used in producing children and in work, not wasted in libidinous pleasures.&quot;

Katz argues that modern ideas of sexuality and eroticism began to develop in America and Germany in the later 19th century. The changing economy and the &quot;transformation of the family from producer to consumer&quot; resulted in shifting values. The Victorian work ethic had changed, pleasure became more highly valued and this allowed ideas of human sexuality to change. Consumer culture had created a market for the erotic, pleasure became commoditized. At the same time medical doctors began to acquire more power and influence. They developed the medical model of &quot;normal love&quot;, in which healthy men and women enjoyed sex as part of a &quot;new ideal of male-female relationships that included.. an essential, necessary, normal eroticism.&quot; This model also had a counterpart, &quot;the Victorian Sex Pervert&quot;, anyone who failed to meet the norm. The basic oppositeness of the sexes was the basis for normal, healthy sexual attraction. &quot;The attention paid the sexual abnormal created a need to name the sexual normal, the better to distinguish the average him and her from the deviant it.&quot; The creation of the term &quot;heterosexual&quot; consolidated the social existence of the pre-existing heterosexual experience and created a sense of ensured and validated normalcy within it.

=== Religious views ===

The Judeo-Christian tradition has several scriptures related to heterosexuality. The Book of Genesis states that God created women because &quot;It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him an help meet for him,&quot;, and that &quot;Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh&quot;

For the most part, religious traditions in the world reserve marriage to heterosexual unions, but there are exceptions including certain Buddhist and Hindu traditions, Unitarian Universalists, Metropolitan Community Church, some Anglican dioceses, and some Quaker, United Church of Canada, and Reform and Conservative Jewish congregations.

Almost all religions believe that sex between a man and a woman within marriage is allowed, but there are a few that believe that it is a sin, such as The Shakers, The Harmony Society, and The Ephrata Cloister. These religions tend to view all sexual relations as sinful, and promote celibacy. Some religions require celibacy for certain roles, such as Catholic priests; however, the Catholic Church also views heterosexual marriage as sacred and necessary.

=== Heteronormativity and heterosexism ===

Heteronormativity denotes or relates to a world view that promotes heterosexuality as the normal or preferred sexual orientation for people to have. It can assign strict gender roles to males and females. The term was popularized by Michael Warner in 1991. Feminist Adrienne Rich argues that compulsory heterosexuality, a continual and repeating reassertion of heterosexual norms, is a facet of heterosexism. Compulsory heterosexuality is the idea that female heterosexuality is both assumed and enforced by a patriarchal society. Heterosexuality is then viewed as the natural inclination or obligation by both sexes. Consequently, anyone who differs from the normalcy of heterosexuality is deemed deviant or abhorrent.

Heterosexism is a form of bias or discrimination in favor of opposite-sex sexuality and relationships. It may include an assumption that everyone is heterosexual and may involve various kinds of discrimination against gays, lesbians, bisexuals, asexuals, heteroflexible people, or transgender or non-binary individuals.

Straight pride is a slogan that arose in the late 1980s and early 1990s and has been used primarily by social conservative groups as a political stance and strategy. The term is described as a response to gay pride adopted by various LGBT groups in the early 1970s or to the accommodations provided to gay pride initiatives.

<doc id="14086" wikidata="Q3234973" url="?curid=14086" title="Hopewell Centre (Hong Kong)">
<text>Hopewell Centre is a , 64-storey skyscraper at 183 Queen&#x27;s Road East, in Wan Chai, Hong Kong Island in Hong Kong. The tower is the first circular skyscraper in Hong Kong. It is named after Hong Kong–listed property firm Hopewell Holdings Limited, which constructed the building. Hopewell Holdings Limited&#x27;s headquarters are in the building and its chief executive officer, Gordon Wu, has his office on the top floor.

==Description==
Construction started in 1977 and was completed in 1980. Upon completion, Hopewell Centre surpassed Jardine House as Hong Kong&#x27;s tallest building. It was also the second tallest building in Asia at the time. It kept its title in Hong Kong until 1989, when the Bank of China Tower was completed. The building is now the 20th tallest building in Hong Kong.

The building has a circular floor plan. Although the front entrance is on the &#x27;ground floor&#x27;, commuters are taken through a set of escalators to the 3rd floor lift lobby. Hopewell Centre stands on the slope of a hill so steep that the building has its back entrance on the 17th floor towards Kennedy Road. There is a circular private swimming pool on the roof of the building built for feng shui reasons because people thought the building resembled a cigarette.

A revolving restaurant located on the 62nd floor, called &quot;Revolving 66&quot;, overlooks other tall buildings below and the harbour. It was originally called Revolving 62, but soon changed its name as locals kept calling it Revolving 66. It completes a 360-degree rotation each hour. Passengers take either office lifts (faster) or the scenic lifts (with a view) to the 56/F, where they transfer to smaller lifts up to the 62/F. The restaurant is now named The Grand Buffet.

The building comprises several groups of lifts. Lobbies are on the 3rd and 17th floor, and are connected to Queen&#x27;s Road East and Kennedy Road respectively. A mini-skylobby is on the 56th floor and serves as a transfer floor for diners heading to the 60/F and 62/F restaurants. The building&#x27;s white &#x27;bumps&#x27; between the windows have built in window-washer guide rails.

This skyscraper was the filming location for R&amp;B group Dru Hill&#x27;s music video for &quot;How Deep Is Your Love,&quot; directed by Brett Ratner, who also directed the movie Rush Hour, whose soundtrack features the song. The circular private swimming pool is well visible in this music video. This swimming pool has also featured in an Australian television advertisement by one of that country&#x27;s major gaming companies, Tattersall&#x27;s Limited, promoting a weekly lottery competition.

The skyscraper was also featured on the cover of post-hardcore band Fugazi&#x27;s 1998 album &quot;End Hits&quot;.

<text>The United States Navy, United States Coast Guard, and United States National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) use a hull classification symbol (sometimes called hull code or [[hull number]]) to identify their ships by type and by individual ship within a type. The system is analogous to the pennant number system that the Royal Navy and other European and Commonwealth navies use.

== History ==

=== United States Navy ===
The U.S. Navy began to assign unique Naval Registry Identification Numbers to its ships in the 1890s. The system was a simple one in which each ship received a number which was appended to its ship type, fully spelled out, and added parenthetically after the ship&#x27;s name when deemed necessary to avoid confusion between ships. Under this system, for example, the battleship &quot;Indiana&quot; was USS &quot;Indiana&quot; (Battleship No. 1), the cruiser &quot;Olympia&quot; was USS &quot;Olympia&quot; (Cruiser No. 6), and so on. Beginning in 1907, some ships also were referred to alternatively by single-letter or three-letter codes—for example, USS &quot;Indiana&quot; (Battleship No. 1) could be referred to as USS &quot;Indiana&quot; (B-1) and USS &quot;Olympia&quot; (Cruiser No. 6) could also be referred to as USS &quot;Olympia&quot; (C-6), while USS &quot;Pennsylvania&quot; (Armored Cruiser No. 4) could be referred to as USS &quot;Pennsylvania&quot; (ACR-4). However, rather than replacing it, these codes coexisted and were used interchangeably with the older system until the modern system was instituted on 17 July 1920.

During World War I, the U.S. Navy acquired large numbers of privately owned and commercial ships and craft for use as patrol vessels, mine warfare vessels, and various types of naval auxiliary ships, some of them with identical names. To keep track of them all, the Navy assigned unique identifying numbers to them. Those deemed appropriate for patrol work received section patrol numbers (SP), while those intended for other purposes received &quot;identification numbers&quot;, generally abbreviated &quot;Id. No.&quot; or &quot;ID;&quot; some ships and craft changed from an SP to an ID number or vice versa during their careers, without their unique numbers themselves changing, and some ships and craft assigned numbers in anticipation of naval service were never acquired by the Navy. The SP/ID numbering sequence was unified and continuous, with no SP number repeated in the ID series or vice versa so that there could not be, for example, both an &quot;SP-435&quot; and an &quot;Id. No. 435&quot;. The SP and ID numbers were used parenthetically after each boat&#x27;s or ship&#x27;s name to identify it; although this system pre-dated the modern hull classification system and its numbers were not referred to at the time as &quot;hull codes&quot; or &quot;hull numbers,&quot; it was used in a similar manner to today&#x27;s system and can be considered its precursor.

=== United States Revenue Cutter Service and United States Coast Guard ===
The United States Revenue Cutter Service, which merged with the United States Lifesaving Service in January 1915 to form the modern United States Coast Guard, began following the Navy&#x27;s lead in the 1890s, with its cutters having parenthetical numbers called Naval Registry Identification Numbers following their names, such as (Cutter No. 1), etc. This persisted until the Navy&#x27;s modern hull classification system&#x27;s introduction in 1920, which included Coast Guard ships and craft.

=== United States Coast and Geodetic Survey ===

Like the U.S. Navy, the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey – a uniformed seagoing service of the United States Government and a predecessor of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) – adopted a hull number system for its fleet in the 20th century. Its largest vessels, &quot;Category I&quot; oceanographic survey ships, were classified as &quot;ocean survey ships&quot; and given the designation &quot;OSS&quot;. Intermediate-sized &quot;Category II&quot; oceanographic survey ships received the designation &quot;MSS&quot; for &quot;medium survey ship,&quot; and smaller &quot;Category III&quot; oceanographic survey ships were given the classification &quot;CSS&quot; for &quot;coastal survey ship.&quot; A fourth designation, &quot;ASV&quot; for &quot;auxiliary survey vessel,&quot; included even smaller vessels. In each case, a particular ship received a unique designation based on its classification and a unique hull number separated by a space rather than a hyphen; for example, the third Coast and Geodetic Survey ship named &quot;Pioneer&quot; was an ocean survey ship officially known as USC&amp;GS &quot;Pioneer&quot; (OSS 31). The Coast and Geodetic Survey″s system persisted after the creation of NOAA in 1970, when NOAA took control of the Survey″s fleet, but NOAA later changed to its modern hull classification system.

=== United States Fish and Wildlife Service ===

The Fish and Wildlife Service, created in 1940 and reorganized as the United States Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) in 1956, adopted a hull number system for its fisheries research ships and patrol vessels. It consisted of &quot;FWS&quot; followed by a unique identifying number. In 1970, NOAA took control of the seagoing ships of the USFWS&#x27;s Bureau of Commercial Fisheries, and as part of the NOAA fleet they were assigned new hull numbers beginning with &quot;FRV,&quot; for Fisheries Research Vessel, followed by a unique identifying number. They eventually were renumbered under the modern NOAA hull number system.

== The modern hull classification system ==

=== United States Navy ===

The U.S. Navy instituted its modern hull classification system on 17 July 1920, doing away with section patrol numbers, &quot;identification numbers&quot;, and the other numbering systems described above. In the new system, all hull classification symbols are at least two letters; for basic types the symbol is the first letter of the type name, doubled, except for aircraft carriers.

The combination of symbol and hull number identifies a modern Navy ship uniquely. A heavily modified or re-purposed ship may receive a new symbol, and either retain the hull number or receive a new one. For example, the heavy gun cruiser was converted to a gun/missile cruiser, changing the hull number to CAG-1. Also, the system of symbols has changed a number of times both since it was introduced in 1907 and since the modern system was instituted in 1920, so ships&#x27; symbols sometimes change without anything being done to the physical ship.

Hull numbers are assigned by classification. Duplication between, but not within, classifications is permitted. Hence, CV-1 was the aircraft carrier and BB-1 was the battleship .

Ship types and classifications have come and gone over the years, and many of the symbols listed below are not presently in use. The Naval Vessel Register maintains an online database of U.S. Navy ships showing which symbols are presently in use.

After World War II until 1975, the U.S. Navy defined a &quot;frigate&quot; as a type of surface warship larger than a destroyer and smaller than a cruiser. In other navies, such a ship generally was referred to as a &quot;flotilla leader&quot;, or &quot;destroyer leader&quot;. Hence the U.S. Navy&#x27;s use of &quot;DL&quot; for &quot;frigate&quot; prior to 1975, while &quot;frigates&quot; in other navies were smaller than destroyers and more like what the U.S. Navy termed a &quot;destroyer escort&quot;, &quot;ocean escort&quot;, or &quot;DE&quot;. The United States Navy 1975 ship reclassification of cruisers, frigates, and ocean escorts brought U.S. Navy classifications into line with other nations&#x27; classifications, at least cosmetically in terms of terminology, and eliminated the perceived &quot;cruiser gap&quot; with the Soviet Navy by redesignating the former &quot;frigates&quot; as &quot;cruisers&quot;.

==== Military Sealift Command ====
If a U.S. Navy ship&#x27;s hull classification symbol begins with &quot;T-&quot;, it is part of the Military Sealift Command, has a primarily civilian crew, and is a United States Naval Ship (USNS) in non-commissioned service – as opposed to a commissioned United States Ship (USS) with an all-military crew.

=== United States Coast Guard ===
If a ship&#x27;s hull classification symbol begins with &quot;W&quot;, it is a commissioned cutter of the United States Coast Guard. Until 1965, the Coast Guard used U.S. Navy hull classification codes, prepending a &quot;W&quot; to their beginning. In 1965, it retired some of the less mission-appropriate Navy-based classifications and developed new ones of its own, most notably WHEC for &quot;high endurance cutter&quot; and WMEC for &quot;medium endurance cutter&quot;.

=== National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ===
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), a component of the United States Department of Commerce, includes the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Commissioned Officer Corps (or &quot;NOAA Corps&quot;), one of the eight uniformed services of the United States, and operates a fleet of seagoing research and survey ships. The NOAA fleet also uses a hull classification symbol system, which it also calls &quot;hull numbers,&quot; for its ships.

After NOAA took over the former fleets of the U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Bureau of Commercial Fisheries in 1970, it initially retained the Coast and Geodetic Survey&#x27;s hull-number designations for its survey ships and adopted hull numbers beginning with &quot;FRV&quot;, for &quot;Fisheries Research Vessel&quot;, for its fisheries research ships. It later adopted a new system of ship classification, which it still uses today. In its modern system, the NOAA fleet is divided into two broad categories, research ships and survey ships. The research ships, which include oceanographic and fisheries research vessels, are given hull numbers beginning with &quot;R&quot;, while the survey ships, generally hydrographic survey vessels, receive hull numbers beginning with &quot;S&quot;. The letter is followed by a three-digit number; the first digit indicates the NOAA &quot;class&quot; (i.e., size) of the vessel, which NOAA assigns based on the ship&#x27;s gross tonnage and horsepower, while the next two digits combine with the first digit to create a unique three-digit identifying number for the ship.

Generally, each NOAA hull number is written with a space between the letter and the three-digit number, as in, for example, or .

Unlike in the U.S. Navy system, once an older NOAA ship leaves service, a newer one can be given the same hull number; for example, &quot;S 222&quot; was assigned to , then assigned to NOAAS &quot;Thomas Jefferson&quot; (S 222), which entered NOAA service after &quot;Mount Mitchell&quot; was stricken.

== United States Navy hull classification codes ==

The U.S. Navy&#x27;s system of alpha-numeric ship designators, and its associated hull numbers, have been for several decades a unique method of categorizing ships of all types: combatants, auxiliaries and district craft. Although considerably changed in detail and expanded over the years, this system remains essentially the same as when formally implemented in 1920. It is a very useful tool for organizing and keeping track of naval vessels, and also provides the basis for the identification numbers painted on the bows (and frequently the sterns) of most U.S. Navy ships.

The ship designator and hull number system&#x27;s roots extend back to the late 1880s when ship type serial numbers were assigned to most of the new-construction warships of the emerging &quot;Steel Navy&quot;. During the course of the next thirty years, these same numbers were combined with filing codes used by the Navy&#x27;s clerks to create an informal version of the system that was put in place in 1920. Limited usage of ship numbers goes back even earlier, most notably to the &quot;Jeffersonian Gunboats&quot; of the early 1800s and the &quot;Tinclad&quot; river gunboats of the Civil War Mississippi Squadron.

It is important to understand that hull number-letter prefixes are not acronyms, and should not be carelessly treated as abbreviations of ship type classifications. Thus, &quot;DD&quot; does not stand for anything more than &quot;Destroyer&quot;. &quot;SS&quot; simply means &quot;Submarine&quot;. And &quot;FF&quot; is the post-1975 type code for &quot;Frigate.&quot;

The hull classification codes for ships in active duty in the United States Navy are governed under Secretary of the Navy Instruction 5030.8D.

=== Warships ===
Warships are designed to participate in combat operations.

The origin of the two-letter code derives from the need to distinguish various cruiser subtypes.
==== Aircraft carrier type ====
Aircraft carriers are ships designed primarily for the purpose of conducting combat operations by aircraft which engage in attacks against airborne, surface, sub-surface and shore targets. Contrary to popular belief, the &quot;CV&quot; hull classification symbol does not stand for &quot;carrier vessel&quot;. &quot;CV&quot; derives from the cruiser designation, with one popular theory that the V comes from French &quot;voler&quot;, &quot;to fly&quot;, but this has never been definitively proven. The V has long been used by the U.S. Navy for heavier-than-air craft and possibly comes from the French volplane. Aircraft carriers are designated in two sequences: the first sequence runs from CV-1 USS &quot;Langley&quot; to the very latest ships, and the second sequence, &quot;CVE&quot; for escort carriers, ran from CVE-1 &quot;Long Island&quot; to CVE-127 &quot;Okinawa&quot; before being discontinued.

==== Surface combatant type ====
Surface combatants are ships which are designed primarily to engage enemy forces on the high seas. The primary surface combatants are battleships, cruisers and destroyers. Battleships are very heavily armed and armored; cruisers moderately so; destroyers and smaller warships, less so. Before 1920, ships were called &quot;&lt;type&gt; no. X&quot;, with the type fully pronounced. The types were commonly abbreviated in ship lists to &quot;B-X&quot;, &quot;C-X&quot;, &quot;D-X&quot; et cetera—for example, before 1920, would have been called &quot;USS &quot;Minnesota&quot;, Battleship number 22&quot; orally and &quot;USS &quot;Minnesota&quot;, B-22&quot; in writing. After 1920, the ship&#x27;s name would have been both written and pronounced &quot;USS &quot;Minnesota&quot; (BB-22)&quot;. In generally decreasing size, the types are:
* ACR: Armored cruiser (pre-1920)
* AFSB: Afloat forward staging base (also AFSB(I) for &quot;interim&quot;, changed to MLP (Mobile Landing Platform, then ESD and ESB)

* LSES: Large Surface Effect Ship
* M: Monitor (1880s–1920)
* SES: Surface Effect Ship
* TB: Torpedo boat

==== Submarine type ====
Submarines are all self-propelled submersible types (usually started with SS) regardless of whether employed as combatant, auxiliary, or research and development vehicles which have at least a residual combat capability. While some classes, including all diesel-electric submarines, are retired from USN service, non-U.S. navies continue to employ SS, SSA, SSAN, SSB, SSC, SSG, SSM, and SST types. With the advent of new Air Independent Propulsion/Power (AIP) systems, both SSI and SSP are used to distinguish the types within the USN, but SSP has been declared the preferred term. SSK, retired by the USN, continues to be used colloquially and interchangeably with SS for diesel-electric attack/patrol submarines within the USN, and, more formally, by the Royal Navy and British firms such as Jane&#x27;s Information Group.

==== Patrol combatant type ====
Patrol combatants are ships whose mission may extend beyond coastal duties and whose characteristics include adequate endurance and seakeeping, providing a capability for operations exceeding 48 hours on the high seas without support. This notably included Brown Water Navy/Riverine Forces during the Vietnam War. Few of these ships are in service today.

* PACV: Patrol Air Cushion Vehicle, hovercraft that was part of the Brown Water Navy (Vietnam)
* SP: Section Patrol, used indiscriminately for patrol vessels, mine warfare vessels, and some other types (World War I; retired 1920)

==== Amphibious warfare type ====
Amphibious warfare vessels include all ships having an organic capability for amphibious warfare and which have characteristics enabling long duration operations on the high seas. There are two classifications of craft: amphibious warfare ships, which are built to cross oceans, and landing craft, which are designed to take troops from ship to shore in an invasion.

The U.S. Navy hull classification symbol for a ship with a well deck depends on its facilities for aircraft:
* An LSD has a helicopter deck, which was removable in the older ships.
* An LPD has a hangar in addition to the helicopter deck.
* An LHD or LHA has a full-length flight deck.

* IX: Unclassified Miscellaneous Unit
* &quot;none&quot;: To honor her unique historical status, USS &quot;Constitution&quot;, formerly IX 21, was reclassified to &quot;none&quot;, effective 1 September 1975.

=== Airships ===
Although aircraft, pre-World War II rigid airships were commissioned (no different from surface warships and submarines), flew the U.S. ensign from their stern and carried a United States Ship (USS) designation.

Rigid airships:
* ZR: Rigid airship
* ZRS: Rigid airship scout 
* ZRCV: Rigid airship aircraft carrier, proposed, not built

Lighter-than-air aircraft (e.g., blimps) continued to fly the U.S. ensign from their stern but were registered as aircraft:
===Temporary designations===
United States Navy Designations (Temporary) are a form of U.S. Navy ship designation, intended for temporary identification use. Such designations usually occur during periods of sudden mobilization, such as that which occurred prior to, and during, World War II or the Korean War, when it was determined that a sudden temporary need arose for a ship for which there was no official Navy designation.

During World War II, for example, a number of commercial vessels were requisitioned, or acquired, by the U.S. Navy to meet the sudden requirements of war. A yacht acquired by the U.S. Navy during the start of World War II might seem desirable to the Navy whose use for the vessel might not be fully developed or explored at the time of acquisition.

On the other hand, a U.S. Navy vessel, such as the yacht in the example above, already in commission or service, might be desired, or found useful, for another need or purpose for which there is no official designation.
* IX: Unclassified Miscellaneous Auxiliary Ship, for example, yacht &quot;Chanco&quot; acquired by the U.S. Navy on 1 October 1940. It was classified as a minesweeper , but instead, mainly used as a patrol craft along the New England coast. When another assignment came, and it could not be determined how to classify the vessel, it was redesignated IX-175 on 10 July 1944.
* IXSS: Unclassified Miscellaneous Submarines, such as the , the and the .
* YAG: Miscellaneous Auxiliary Service Craft, such as the , and which, curiously, was earlier known as .

Numerous other U.S. Navy vessels were launched with a temporary, or nominal, designation, such as YMS or PC, since it could not be determined, at the time of construction, what they should be used for. Many of these were vessels in the 150 to 200 feet length class with powerful engines, whose function could be that of a minesweeper, patrol craft, submarine chaser, seaplane tender, tugboat, or other. Once their destiny, or capability, was found or determined, such vessels were reclassified with their actual designation.

== United States Coast Guard vessels ==

Prior to 1965, U.S. Coast Guard cutters used the same designation as naval ships but preceded by a &quot;W&quot; to indicate Coast Guard commission. The U.S. Coast Guard considers any ship over 65 feet in length with a permanently assigned crew, a cutter.

== National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration hull codes ==
* R: Research ships, including oceanographic and fisheries research ships
* S: Survey ships, including hydrographic survey ships

The letter is paired with a three-digit number. The first digit of the number is determined by the ship″s &quot;power tonnage,&quot; defined as the sum of its shaft horsepower and gross international tonnage, as follows:
* If the power tonnage is 5,501 through 9,000, the first digit is &quot;1&quot;.
* If the power tonnage 3,501 through 5,500, the first digit is &quot;2.&quot;
* If the power tonnage is 2,001 through 3,500, the first digit is &quot;3.&quot;
* If the power tonnage is 1,001 through 2,000, the first digit is &quot;4.&quot;
* If the power tonnage is 501 through 1,000, the first digit is &quot;5.&quot;
* If the power tonnage is 500 or less and the ship is at least long, the first digit is &quot;6.&quot;

The second and third digits are assigned to create a unique three-digit hull number.
