<text>The Fantastic Four, often abbreviated as FF, is a superhero team appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The team debuted in &quot;The Fantastic Four&quot; #1 (cover-dated November 1961), helping usher in a new level of realism in the medium. It was the first superhero team created by artist/co-plotter Jack Kirby and editor/co-scripter Stan Lee, and through this title the &quot;Marvel method&quot; style of production came into prominence.

The four characters traditionally associated with the Fantastic Four, who gained superpowers after exposure to cosmic rays during a scientific mission to outer space, are Mister Fantastic (Reed Richards), a scientific genius and the leader of the group, who can stretch his body into incredible lengths and shapes; the Invisible Woman (Susan &quot;Sue&quot; Storm-Richards), Reed&#x27;s girlfriend and later wife, who can render herself invisible and project powerful invisible force fields and blasts; the Human Torch (Johnny Storm), Sue&#x27;s younger brother, who can generate flames, surround himself with them and fly; and the monstrous Thing (Ben Grimm), their grumpy but benevolent friend, a former college football star, Reed&#x27;s college roommate and a skilled pilot, who possesses tremendous superhuman strength, durability and endurance due to his stone-like flesh.

Since their 1961 introduction, the Fantastic Four has been portrayed as a somewhat dysfunctional, yet loving, family. Breaking convention with other comic archetypes, the members squabbled, held grudges both deep and petty, and eschewed anonymity or secret identities in favor of celebrity status. They are also well known for their recurring encounters with characters such as the villainous monarch Doctor Doom; the planet-devouring Galactus; the Kree Empire&#x27;s ruthless and tyrannical enforcer Ronan the Accuser; the Negative Zone&#x27;s ruler Annihilus; the sea-dwelling prince Namor; the spacefaring Silver Surfer; the Skrull warrior Kl&#x27;rt; and the Molecule Man.

The Fantastic Four has been adapted into other media, including several video games, animated series, and live-action films.

==Publication history==
===Origins===
Apocryphal legend has it that in 1961, longtime magazine and comic book publisher Martin Goodman was playing golf with either Jack Liebowitz or Irwin Donenfeld of rival company DC Comics, then known as National Periodical Publications, and that the top executive bragged about DC&#x27;s success with the new superhero team the Justice League of America. While film producer and comics historian Michael Uslan has debunked the particulars of that story, Goodman, a publishing trend-follower, aware of the JLA&#x27;s strong sales, did direct his comics editor, Stan Lee, to create a comic-book series about a team of superheroes. According to Lee, writing in 1974, &quot;Martin mentioned that he had noticed one of the titles published by National Comics seemed to be selling better than most. It was a book called &quot;The&quot; &quot;Justice League of America&quot; and it was composed of a team of superheroes. ... &#x27;If the Justice League is selling&#x27;, spoke he, &#x27;why don&#x27;t we put out a comic book that features a team of superheroes?&#x27;&quot;

Lee, who had served as editor-in-chief and art director of Marvel Comics and its predecessor companies, Timely Comics and Atlas Comics, for two decades, found that the medium had become creatively restrictive. Determined &quot;to carve a real career for myself in the nowhere world of comic books&quot;, Lee concluded that, &quot;For just this once, I would do the type of story I myself would enjoy reading ... And the characters would be the kind of characters I could personally relate to: They&#x27;d be flesh and blood, they&#x27;d have their faults and foibles, they&#x27;d be fallible and feisty, and — most important of all — inside their colorful, costumed booties they&#x27;d still have feet of clay.&quot;

Lee provided one of his earliest recorded comments on the creation of the Fantastic Four for a fanzine in 1968, during which time penciller Jack Kirby was also working at Marvel. (Kirby is interviewed separately in the same publication.) When asked who conceived the team, he or Kirby, Lee responded &quot;Both &#x27; &#x27;twas mainly my idea, but Jack created characters visually&quot;. In the 1974 book Origins of Marvel Comics Lee described the creative process in more detail, stating that he developed the basic characters as well as a story synopsis for Jack Kirby to follow in the first issue. Lee noted the involvement of both Kirby and Publisher Martin Goodman prior to preparing his synopsis: &quot;After kicking it around with Martin and Jack for a while I decided to call our quaint quartet the Fantastic Four. I wrote a detailed first synopsis for Jack to follow and the rest is history.&quot; Kirby turned in his penciled art pages to Lee, who added dialogue and captions. This approach to creating comics, which became known as the &quot;Marvel Method&quot;, worked so well that Lee and Kirby used it from then on, and the Marvel Method became standard for the company within a year.

Kirby recalled events somewhat differently. In a 1970 Fanzine interview he confirmed Lee&#x27;s involvement in the creation of the Fantastic Four but took credit for the main characters and ideas, stating &quot;It was my idea. It was my idea to do it the way it was; my idea to develop it the way it was. I&#x27;m not saying Stan had nothing to do with it. Of course he did. We talked things out.&quot; Years later, when specifically challenged with Lee&#x27;s version of events in a 1990 interview, Kirby responded: &quot;I would say that&#x27;s an outright lie&quot;, although the interviewer, Gary Groth, notes that this statement needs to be viewed with caution. Kirby claims he came up with the idea for the Fantastic Four in Marvel&#x27;s offices, and that Lee merely added the dialogue after the story was pencilled. Kirby also sought to establish, more credibly and on numerous occasions, that the visual elements of the strip were his conceptions. He regularly pointed to a team he created for rival publisher DC Comics in the 1950s, the Challengers of the Unknown. &quot;[I]f you notice the uniforms, they&#x27;re the same ... I always give them a skintight uniform with a belt ... the Challengers and the FF have a minimum of decoration. And of course, the Thing&#x27;s skin is a kind of decoration, breaking up the monotony of the blue uniform.&quot; It is important to note, however, that the Fantastic Four wore civilian garb instead of uniforms, which were only introduced (along with the Baxter Building Headquarters) in the third issue of the series following readership feedback. The original submitted design was also modified to include the iconic chest insignia of a &quot;4&quot; within a circle that was designed by Lee.

Given the conflicting statements, outside commentators have found it hard to ascertain who created the Fantastic Four. A typed synopsis by Lee for the introductory segment of the first Fantastic Four issue exists and outlines the characters and their origins, with various minor differences to the published version. However Earl Wells, writing in &quot;The Comics Journal&quot;, points out that its existence does not assert its place in the creation: &quot;[W]e have no way of knowing of whether Lee wrote the synopsis after a discussion with Kirby in which Kirby supplied most of the ideas&quot;.

It is also notable that the Fantastic Four&#x27;s first adventure in 1961 depicts a team of four adventurers (three men and a woman) led by a professor travelling to the Earth&#x27;s center and encountering giant monsters while contending with a human antagonist who is also from the surface world. Although neither Lee nor Kirby ever mentioned the 1959 film &quot;Journey to the Center of the Earth&quot; as a direct inspiration, publisher Martin Goodman was well known for following popular entertainment trends to attract sales in his comics line.

Comics historian R. C. Harvey believes the Fantastic Four was a continuation of the work Kirby previously did, and so &quot;more likely Kirby&#x27;s creations than Lee&#x27;s&quot;. But Harvey notes that the Marvel Method of collaboration allowed each man to claim credit, and that Lee&#x27;s dialogue added to the direction the team took. Wells argues that Lee&#x27;s contributions set the framework within which Kirby worked, and this made Lee &quot;more responsible&quot;. Comics historian Mark Evanier, a studio assistant to Jack Kirby in the 1970s, says that the considered opinion of Lee and Kirby&#x27;s contemporaries was &quot;that &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; was created by Stan and Jack. No further division of credit seemed appropriate.&quot;

===1961–1970s===
The release of &quot;The Fantastic Four&quot; #1 (Nov. 1961) was an unexpected success. Lee had felt ready to stop working on comics at the time, but the positive response to &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; persuaded him to continue with comic books. The title began to receive fan mail and Lee started printing the letters in a letter column with issue #3. Also with the third issue, Lee created the hyperbolic slogan &quot;The Greatest Comic Magazine in the World!!&quot; With the following issue, the slogan was changed to &quot;The World&#x27;s Greatest Comic Magazine!&quot; and became a fixture on the issue covers into the 1990s, and on numerous covers in the 2000s.

Issue #4 (May 1962) reintroduced Namor the Sub-Mariner, an aquatic antihero who was a star character of Marvel&#x27;s earliest iteration, Timely Comics, during the late 1930s and 1940s period that historians and fans call the Golden Age of Comics. Issue #5 (July 1962) introduced the team&#x27;s most frequent nemesis, Doctor Doom. These earliest issues were published bimonthly. With issue #16 (July 1963), the cover title dropped its &quot;The&quot; and became simply &quot;Fantastic Four&quot;. In &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; #19 (October 1963), Stan Lee announced that Reed Richards would remain leader of the group, due to an overwhelming fan response in the affirmative (93.47%). Stan&#x27;s comment of &quot;″Nuff Said&quot; would from here become an ongoing phrase in Lee&#x27;s communications with fans.

While the early stories were complete narratives, the frequent appearances of these two antagonists, Doom and Namor, in subsequent issues indicated the creation of a long narrative by Lee and Kirby that extended over months. According to comics historian Les Daniels, &quot;only narratives that ran to several issues would be able to contain their increasingly complex ideas&quot;. During its creators&#x27; lengthy run, the series produced many acclaimed storylines and characters that have become central to Marvel, including the hidden race of alien-human genetic experiments, the Inhumans; the Black Panther, an African king who would be mainstream comics&#x27; first black superhero; the rival alien races the Kree and the shapeshifting Skrulls; Him, who would become Adam Warlock; the Negative Zone and unstable molecules. The story frequently cited as Lee and Kirby&#x27;s finest achievement is the three-part &quot;Galactus Trilogy&quot; that began in &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; #48 (March 1966), chronicling the arrival of Galactus, a cosmic giant who wanted to devour the planet, and his herald, the Silver Surfer. &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; #48 was chosen as #24 in the 100 Greatest Marvels of All Time poll of Marvel&#x27;s readers in 2001. Editor Robert Greenberger wrote in his introduction to the story that, &quot;As the fourth year of the Fantastic Four came to a close, Stan Lee and Jack Kirby seemed to be only warming up. In retrospect, it was perhaps the most fertile period of any monthly title during the Marvel Age.&quot; Daniels noted that &quot;[t]he mystical and metaphysical elements that took over the saga were perfectly suited to the tastes of young readers in the 1960s&quot;, and Lee soon discovered that the story was a favorite on college campuses. The &quot;Fantastic Four Annual&quot; was used to spotlight several key events. The Sub-Mariner was crowned king of Atlantis in the first annual (1963). The following year&#x27;s annual revealed the origin story of Doctor Doom. &quot;Fantastic Four Annual&quot; #3 (1965) presented the wedding of Reed Richards and Sue Storm. Lee and Kirby reintroduced the original Human Torch in &quot;Fantastic Four Annual&quot; #4 (1966) and had him battle Johnny Storm. Sue Richards&#x27; pregnancy was announced in &quot;Fantastic Four Annual&quot; #5 (1967), and the Richards&#x27; son, Franklin Richards was born in &quot;Fantastic Four Annual&quot; #6 (1968) in a story which introduced Annihilus as well.

Marvel filed for a trademark for &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; in 1967 and the United States Patent and Trademark Office issued the registration in 1970.

Kirby left Marvel in mid-1970, having drawn the first 102 issues plus an unfinished issue, partially published in &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; #108, with alterations, and later completed and published as &quot;Fantastic Four: The Lost Adventure&quot; (April 2008), &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; continued with Lee, Roy Thomas, Gerry Conway and Marv Wolfman as its consecutive regular writers, working with artists such as John Romita Sr., John Buscema, Rich Buckler and George Pérez, with longtime inker Joe Sinnott adding some visual continuity. Jim Steranko also contributed some covers during this time. A short-lived series starring the team, &quot;Giant-Size Super-Stars&quot;, began in May 1974 and changed its title to &quot;Giant-Size Fantastic Four&quot; with issue #2. The fourth issue introduced Jamie Madrox, a character who later became part of the X-Men. &quot;Giant-Size Fantastic Four&quot; was canceled with issue #6 (Oct. 1975). Roy Thomas and George Pérez crafted a metafictional story for &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; #176 (Nov. 1976) in which the Impossible Man visited the offices of Marvel Comics and met numerous comics creators. Marv Wolfman and Keith Pollard crafted a multi-issue storyline involving the son of Doctor Doom which culminated in issue #200 (Nov. 1978). John Byrne joined the title with issue #209 (Aug. 1979), doing pencil breakdowns for Sinnott to finish. He and Wolfman introduced a new herald for Galactus named Terrax the Tamer in #211 (Oct. 1979).

===1980s and 1990s===
Bill Mantlo briefly followed Wolfman as writer of the series and wrote a crossover with &quot;Peter Parker, The Spectacular Spider-Man&quot; #42 (May 1980). Byrne wrote and drew a giant-sized Fantastic Four promotional comic for Coca-Cola, which was rejected by Coca-Cola as being too violent and published as &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; #220–221 (July–Aug. 1980) instead. Writer Doug Moench and penciller Bill Sienkiewicz then took over for 10 issues. With issue #232 (July 1981), the aptly titled &quot;Back to the Basics&quot;, Byrne began his run as writer, penciller and inker, the last under the pseudonym Bjorn Heyn for this issue only.

Byrne revitalized the slumping title with his run. Byrne was slated to write with Sienkiewicz providing the art however, Sienkiewicz left to do &quot;Moon Knight&quot;, and Byrne subsequently became writer, artist, and inker. Various editors were assigned to the comic; eventually Bob Budiansky became the regular editor. Byrne told Jim Shooter that he could not work with Budiansky, although they ultimately continued to work together. In 2006, Byrne said &quot;that&#x27;s my paranoia. I look back and I think that was Shooter trying to force me off the book&quot;. Byrne left following issue #293 (Aug. 1986) in the middle of a story arc, explaining he could not recapture the fun he had previously had on the series. One of Byrne&#x27;s changes was making the Invisible Girl into the Invisible Woman: assertive and confident. During this period, fans came to recognize that she was quite powerful, whereas previously, she had been primarily seen as a superpowered mother and wife in the tradition of television moms like those played by Donna Reed and Florence Henderson.

Byrne staked new directions in the characters&#x27; personal lives, having the married Sue Storm and Reed Richards suffer a miscarriage and the Thing quitting the Fantastic Four, with She-Hulk being recruited as his long-term replacement. He also re-emphasized the family dynamic which he felt the series had drifted away from after the Lee/Kirby run, commenting that, &quot;&quot;Family&quot;—and not &quot;dysfunctional family&quot;—is the central, key element to the FF. It is an absolutely vital dynamic between the characters.&quot; [emphases in original]

Byrne was followed by a quick succession of writers: Roger Stern, Tom DeFalco, and Roy Thomas. Steve Englehart took over as writer for issues 304–332 (except #320). The title had been struggling, so Englehart decided to make radical changes. He felt the title had become stale with the normal makeup of Reed, Sue, Ben, and Johnny, so in issue #308 Reed and Sue retired and were replaced with the Thing&#x27;s new girlfriend, Sharon Ventura, and Johnny Storm&#x27;s former love, Crystal. The changes increased readership through issue #321. At this point, Marvel made decisions about another Englehart comic, &quot;West Coast Avengers&quot;, that he disagreed with, and in protest he changed his byline to S.F.X. Englehart (S.F.X. is the abbreviation for Simple Sound Effects). In issue #326, Englehart was told to bring Reed and Sue back and undo the other changes he had made. This caused Englehart to take his name entirely off the book. He used the pseudonym John Harkness, which he had created years before for work he didn&#x27;t want to be associated with. According to Englehart, the run from #326 through his last issue, #332, was &quot;one of the most painful stretches of [his] career.&quot; Writer-artist Walt Simonson took over as writer with #334 (December 1989), and three issues later began pencilling and inking as well. With brief inking exceptions, two fill-in issues, and a three-issue stint drawn by Arthur Adams, Simonson remained in all three positions through #354 (July 1991).

Simonson, who had been writing the team comic &quot;The Avengers&quot;, had gotten approval for Reed and Sue to join that team after Engelhart had written them out of &quot;Fantastic Four&quot;. Yet by &quot;The Avengers&quot; #300, where they were scheduled to join the team, Simonson was told the characters were returning to &quot;Fantastic Four&quot;. This led to Simonson quitting &quot;The Avengers&quot; after that issue. Shortly afterward, he was offered the job of writing &quot;Fantastic Four&quot;. Having already prepared a number of stories involving the Avengers with Reed and Sue in the lineup, he then rewrote these for &quot;Fantastic Four&quot;. Simonson later recalled that working on &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; allowed him the latitude to use original Avengers members Thor and Iron Man, which he had been precluded from using in &quot;The Avengers&quot;.

After another fill-in, the regular team of writer and Marvel editor-in-chief Tom DeFalco, penciller Paul Ryan and inker Dan Bulanadi took over, with Ryan self-inking beginning with #360 (Jan. 1992). That team, with the very occasional different inker, continued for years through #414 (July 1996). DeFalco nullified the Storm-Masters marriage by retconning that the alien Skrull Empire had kidnapped the real Masters and replaced her with a spy named Lyja. Once discovered, Lyja, who herself had fallen for Storm, helped the Fantastic Four rescue Masters. Ventura departed after being further mutated by Doctor Doom. Although some fans were not pleased with DeFalco&#x27;s run on &quot;Fantastic Four&quot;, calling him &quot;The Great Satan&quot;, the title&#x27;s sales rose steadily over the period.

Other key developments included Franklin Richards being sent into the future and returning as a teenager; the return of Reed&#x27;s time-traveling father, Nathaniel, who is revealed to be the father of time-travelling villain Kang the Conqueror and Reed&#x27;s apparent death at the hands of a seemingly mortally wounded Doctor Doom. It would be two years before DeFalco resurrected the two characters, revealing that their &quot;deaths&quot; were orchestrated by the supervillain Hyperstorm.

The ongoing series was canceled with issue #416 (Sept. 1996) and relaunched with vol. 2 #1 (Nov. 1996) as part of the multi-series &quot;Heroes Reborn&quot; crossover story arc. The yearlong volume retold the team&#x27;s first adventures in a more contemporary style, and set in a parallel universe. Following the end of that experiment, &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; was relaunched with vol. 3 #1 (Jan. 1998). Initially by the team of writer Scott Lobdell and penciller Alan Davis, it went after three issues to writer Chris Claremont (co-writing with Lobdell for #4–5) and penciller Salvador Larroca; this team enjoyed a long run through issue #32 (Aug. 2000).

===2000s===
Following the run of Claremont, Lobdell and Larroca, Carlos Pacheco took over as penciller and co-writer, first with Rafael Marín, then with Marín and Jeph Loeb. This series began using dual numbering, as if the original &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; series had continued unbroken, with issue #42 / #471 (June 2001). At the time, the Marvel Comics series begun in the 1960s, such as &quot;Thor&quot; and &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot;, were given such dual numbering on the front cover, with the present-day volume&#x27;s numbering alongside the numbering from the original series. After issue #70 / #499 (Aug. 2003), the title reverted to its original vol. 1 numbering with issue #500 (Sept. 2003).

Karl Kesel succeeded Loeb as co-writer with issue #51 / #480 (March 2002), and after a few issues with temporary teams, Mark Waid took over as writer with #60 / 489 (October 2002) with artist Mike Wieringo with Marvel releasing a promotional variant edition of their otherwise $2.25 debut issue at the price of nine cents US. Pencillers Mark Buckingham, Casey Jones, and Howard Porter variously contributed through issue #524 (May 2005), with a handful of issues by other teams also during this time. Writer J. Michael Straczynski and penciller Mike McKone did issues #527–541 (July 2005 – Nov. 2006), with Dwayne McDuffie taking over as writer the following issue, and Paul Pelletier succeeding McKone beginning with #544 (May 2007).

As a result of the events of the &quot;Civil War&quot; company-crossover storyline, the Black Panther and Storm temporarily replaced Reed and Susan Richards on the team. During that period, the Fantastic Four also appeared in &quot;Black Panther&quot;, written by Reginald Hudlin and pencilled primarily by Francis Portela. Beginning with issue #554 (April 2008), writer Mark Millar and penciller Bryan Hitch began what Marvel announced as a sixteen-issue run. Following the summer 2008 crossover storyline, &quot;Secret Invasion&quot;, and the 2009 aftermath &quot;Dark Reign&quot;, chronicling the U.S. government&#x27;s assigning of the Nation&#x27;s security functions to the seemingly reformed supervillain Norman Osborn, the Fantastic Four starred in a five-issue miniseries, &quot;Dark Reign: Fantastic Four&quot; (May–Sept. 2009), written by Jonathan Hickman, with art by Sean Chen. Hickman took over as the series regular writer as of issue #570 with Dale Eaglesham and later Steve Epting on art.

===2010s===
In the storyline &quot;Three&quot;, which concluded in &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; #587 (cover date March 2011, published January 26, 2011), the Human Torch appears to die stopping a horde of monsters from the other-dimensional Negative Zone. The series ended with the following issue, #588, and relaunched in March 2011 as simply &quot;FF&quot;. The relaunch saw the team assume a new name, the Future Foundation, adopt new black-and-white costumes, and accept longtime ally Spider-Man as a member. In October 2011, with the publication of &quot;FF&quot; #11 (cover-dated Dec. 2011), the &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; series reached its 599th issue.

In November 2011, to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the Fantastic Four and of Marvel Comics, the company published the 100-page &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; #600 (cover-dated Jan. 2012), which returned the title to its original numbering and featured the return of the Human Torch. It revealed the fate of the character of Johnny Storm after issue #587, showing that while he did in fact die, he was resurrected to fight as a gladiator for the entertainment of Annihilus. Storm later formed a resistance force called Light Brigade and defeated Annihilus.

Although it was launched as a continuation of the &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; title, &quot;FF&quot; continues publication as a separate series. Starting with issue #12, the title focuses upon the youthful members of the Future Foundation, including Franklin and Valeria Richards.

In the graphic novel &quot;Fantastic Four: Season One&quot;, the Fantastic Four is given an updated origin story set in the present day instead of the 1960s. The hardcover compilation debuted at number four on &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best Seller list for graphic novels.

As part of Marvel NOW! &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; ended with #611, ending Jonathan Hickman&#x27;s long run on &quot;FF&quot; titles, and the title was relaunched in November 2012 with the creative team of writer Matt Fraction and artist Mark Bagley. In the new title with its numbering starting at #1, the entire Fantastic Four family explore space together, with the hidden intent for Reed Richards to discover why his powers are fading.

Writer James Robinson and artist Leonard Kirk launched a new &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; series in February 2014 (cover dated April 2014).

Robinson later confirmed that &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; would be cancelled in 2015 with issue #645, saying that &quot;The book is reverting to its original numbers, and the book is going away for a while. I&#x27;m moving towards the end of &quot;Fantastic Four&quot;. I just want to reassure people that you will not leave this book with a bad taste in your mouth.&quot; In the aftermath of the &quot;Secret Wars&quot; storyline, the Thing is working with the Guardians of the Galaxy and the Human Torch is acting as an ambassador with the Inhumans. With Franklin&#x27;s powers restored and Reed having absorbed the power of the Beyonders from Doom, the Richards family is working on travelling through and reconstructing the multiverse, but Peter Parker has purchased the Baxter Building to keep it &quot;safe&quot; until the team is ready to come back together.

A new volume for the Fantastic Four was released in August 2018, written by Dan Slott, as part of Marvel&#x27;s Fresh Start event. The first issue of the new series was met with strong sales, and a positive critical reaction. When the Future Foundation is threatened by the Griever at the End of All Things, Mister Fantastic plays on her ego to convince her to provide him with equipment that will allow him to summon his teammates. When Human Torch and Thing are reunited with Mister Fantastic and Invisible Woman, the other superheroes that were part of the Fantastic Four at some point in their lives also arrived, including, unexpectedly, X-Men&#x27;s Iceman. With the gathered heroes assisted the Fantastic Four into causing so much damage to the Griever&#x27;s equipment, she is forced to retreat in her final telepod or be trapped in that universe. This left the heroes to salvage components from the broken ship to create their own teleport system to return to their universe. The Fantastic Four and their extended family returned to Earth where they find that Liberteens members Ms. America, 2-D, Hope, and Iceberg have come together as the Fantastix with Ms. America taking the codename of Ms. Fantastix. Following the staged bank robbery that the Wrecking Crew committed and their involvement of being hired to humiliate the Fantastix in public, the Fantastic Four gave the Fantastix their blessing to continue using the Baxter Building while the FF operate in a house on Yancy Street with a dimensionally-transcendental interior.

In the storyline &quot;Point of Origin&quot;, the Fantastic Four entrust Alicia, H.E.R.B.I.E., Franklin and Valeria to protect Earth while they begin their mission to learn a further origin of the cosmic radiation that granted them their powers in the first place, piloting a new space ship called Marvel-2. While in the middle of a space adventure to find the origin, the Fantastic Four are attacked by a group who believed themselves to be the superheroes of Planet Spyre, the Unparalleled. Reed and Sue are separated from the Thing, Human Torch is revealed to be the soulmate of the Unparalleled member named Sky, and they learn that the Unparalleled&#x27;s leader and the Overseer of Planet Spyre, Revos, was responsible for the cosmic rays that struck the team on their original trip, as he wanted to stop them coming to his planet. Revos subsequently mutated his people to &quot;prepare for their return&quot; before trying to eradicate the mutates who are unable to retain their original forms in the same manner as the Thing, accusing the mutates of being &quot;villains and imperfects&quot;; as a result, through his own paranoia and xenophobia, the Overseer himself is responsible for the fateful creation of the Fantastic Four and mutated his entire race to face a non-existent threat. Revos challenges Mr. Fantastic to a fight over their differences, until it is settled and they finally made peace. As the Fantastic Four are about to depart Spyre after helping its citizens clean up the Planet (as well as Reed providing the mutates with a variation of the temporary &#x27;cure&#x27; he has created for Ben), Skye join them to learn about Earth and every unseen galaxy. When the incoming Kree-Skrull Empyre occur at the same time as teen heroes are being outlawed, the original Fantastic Four went to space with Avengers to stop this Empyre, leaving Franklin and Valeria being backed by Spider-Man and Wolverine to defend Earth.

===2020s===
In August 2022, Marvel announced that writer Ryan North and artist Iban Coello would launch a new volume of Fantastic Four in November of that year after Slott had concluded his run on the title with issue #46.

==Spin-offs==
Ancillary titles and features spin off from the flagship series include the 1970s quarterly &quot;Giant-Size Fantastic Four&quot; and the 1990s &quot;Fantastic Four Unlimited&quot; and &quot;Fantastic Four Unplugged&quot;; &quot;Fantastic Force&quot;, an 18-issue spinoff (November 1994 – April 1996) featuring a young adult Franklin Richards, from a different timeline, as Psi-Lord. A 12-issue series &quot;Fantastic Four: The World&#x27;s Greatest Comics Magazine&quot; ran in 2001, paying homage to Stan Lee and Jack Kirby&#x27;s legendary run. A spinoff title &quot;Marvel Knights 4&quot; (April 2004 – August 2006) was written by Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa and initially illustrated by Steve McNiven in his first Marvel work. There have also been numerous limited series featuring the group.

In 1996, Marvel launched the series &quot;Fantastic Four 2099,&quot; part of the company&#x27;s Marvel 2099 imprint which explored an alternate future of the Marvel Universe. The four protagonists inexplicably find themselves in 2099, with the world believing them to be clones of the original members of the Fantastic Four. The series ran for 8 issues (Jan. – Aug. 1996), serving as a companion to &quot;Doom 2099&quot;—an original Marvel 2099 title featuring an individual claiming to be the original Victor von Doom. In 2021, the series was brought back for a single issue.

In 2004, Marvel launched &quot;Ultimate Fantastic Four&quot;. As part of the company&#x27;s Ultimate Marvel imprint, the series re-imagined the team as young adults. It ran for 60 issues (Feb. 2004 – Feb. 2009). The issues were repackaged into four-issue graphic novel volumes. The characters continued to appear in other Ultimate Marvel franchises, including &quot;Ultimatum&quot;. Ultimate Reed Richards became a mainstay of both the Earth-1610 and Earth-616 continuities as the villain the Maker. In 2008, they also launched &quot;Marvel Adventures: Fantastic Four&quot;, an out-of-continuity series aimed at younger readers.

Although it was launched by Marvel as a continuation of the Fantastic Four title in 2011, &quot;FF&quot; continued publication as a separate series after the regular series resumed in 2012. From issues #12, the title focused on the youthful members of the Future Foundation, including Franklin and Valeria Richards. A second volume was launched as part of Marvel NOW! by Matt Fraction and Mike Allred depicting a substitute Fantastic Four team starring Scott Lang, Medusa, She-Hulk and Ms. Thing.

===Solo series===
====The Human Torch solo====
The Human Torch was given a solo strip in &quot;Strange Tales&quot; in 1962 to bolster the title&#x27;s sales. The series began in &quot;Strange Tales&quot; #101 (October 1962), in 12- to 14-page stories plotted by Lee and initially scripted by his brother Larry Lieber, and drawn by penciller Kirby and inker Dick Ayers.

Here, Johnny was seen living with his older sister, Susan, in fictional Glenview, Long Island, New York, where he continued high school and, with youthful naiveté, attempted to maintain a &quot;secret identity&quot;. In &quot;Strange Tales&quot; #106 (March 1963), Johnny discovered that his friends and neighbors knew of his dual identity all along from Fantastic Four news reports, but were humoring him. Supporting characters included Johnny&#x27;s girlfriend, Doris Evans, usually in consternation as Johnny cheerfully flew off to battle bad guys. She was seen again in a 1973 issue of &quot;Fantastic Four&quot;, having become a heavyset but cheerful wife and mother. Ayers took over the penciling after ten issues, later followed by original Golden Age Human Torch creator Carl Burgos and others. The Fantastic Four made occasional cameo appearances, and the Thing became a co-star with issue #123 (Aug. 1964).

The Human Torch shared the split book &quot;Strange Tales&quot; with fellow feature Doctor Strange for the majority of its run, before being replaced in issue #135 (August 1965) by Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. The Silver Age stories were republished in 1974, along with some Golden Age Human Torch stories, in a short-lived ongoing &quot;Human Torch&quot; series.

A later ongoing solo series in Marvel&#x27;s manga-influenced Tsunami imprint, &quot;Human Torch&quot;, ran 12 issues (June 2003 – June 2004), by writer Karl Kesel and penciler Skottie Young. The series was followed by the five-issue limited series &quot;Spider-Man/Human Torch&quot; (March–July 2005), an untold tales team-up arc spanning the course of their friendship.

====The Thing solo====
The Thing appeared in two team-up issues of &quot;Marvel Feature&quot; (#11–12, September–November 1973). Following their success, he was given his own regular team-up title &quot;Marvel Two-in-One&quot;, co-starring with Marvel heroes not only in the present day but occasionally in other time periods (fighting alongside the World War II-era Liberty Legion in #20 and the 1930s hero Doc Savage in #21, for example) and in alternate realities. The series ran 100 issues (January 1974 – June 1983), with seven summer annuals (1976–1982) and was immediately followed by the solo title &quot;The Thing&quot; #1–36 (July 1983 – June 1986). Another ongoing solo series, also titled &quot;The Thing&quot;, ran eight issues (January–August 2006).

A six issue miniseries written by Walter Mosely, entitled &quot;The Thing&quot;, was released in November 2021.

====Invisible Woman solo====
In April 2019, Marvel Comics announced that it would publish &quot;Invisible Woman&quot;, a five-issue miniseries written by Mark Waid and drawn by artist Mattia De Lulis. This was Sue Storm&#x27;s first solo title. Adam Hughes drew the cover for all five issues.

==Characters ==
The Fantastic Four is formed after four civilian astronauts are exposed to cosmic rays during an unauthorized outer space test flight in an experimental rocket ship designed by Dr. Reed Richards. Pilot Ben Grimm and crew-members Susan Storm and her brother Johnny Storm survive an emergency crash-landing in a field on Earth. Upon exiting the rocket, the four discover they have developed incredible superpowers and decide to use these powers to help others.

In the first issue the crew talks about Reed Richards&#x27; rocketship flying to the stars. Stan Lee&#x27;s original synopsis described the crew&#x27;s plan to fly to Mars, but Lee later shortly afterward wrote that due to &quot;the rate the Communists are progressing in space, maybe we better make this a flight to the STARS, instead of just to Mars, because by the time this mag goes on sale, the Russians may have already MADE a flight to Mars!&quot;

In a significant departure from preceding superhero conventions, the Fantastic Four make no effort to maintain secret identities or, until issue #3, to wear superhero costumes, instead maintaining a public profile and enjoying celebrity status for scientific and heroic contributions to society. At the same time, they are often prone to arguing and even fighting with one another. Despite their bickering, the Fantastic Four consistently prove themselves to be &quot;a cohesive and formidable team in times of crisis.&quot;

While there have been a number of lineup changes to the group, the four characters who debuted in &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; #1 remain the core and most frequent lineup. They consist of:

* Mister Fantastic (Reed Richards) - A scientific genius, can stretch, twist and re-shape his body to inhuman proportions. Mr. Fantastic serves as the father figure of the group, and is &quot;appropriately pragmatic, authoritative, and dull&quot;. Richards blames himself for the failed space mission, particularly because of how the event transformed pilot Ben Grimm. Stan Lee said the stretch powers were inspired by DC&#x27;s Plastic Man, which had no equivalent in Marvel.
* Invisible Girl/Invisible Woman (Susan Storm) - Reed Richards&#x27; girlfriend (and eventual wife) has the ability to bend and manipulate light to render herself and others invisible. Stan Lee did not want Sue to have superstrength, &quot;to be Wonder Woman and punch people&quot;, so eventually he came to invisibility, inspired by works such as &quot;The Invisible Man&quot;. She later develops the ability to generate invisible force fields, which she uses for a variety of defensive and offensive effects.
* Human Torch (Johnny Storm) - Sue Storm&#x27;s younger brother, possesses the ability to control fire, allowing him to project fire from his body, as well as the power to fly. This character was loosely based on a Human Torch character published by Marvel&#x27;s predecessor Timely Comics in the 1940s, an android that could ignite itself. Lee said that when he conceptualized the character, &quot;I thought it was a shame that we didn&#x27;t have The Human Torch anymore, and this was a good chance to bring him back&quot;. Unlike the teen sidekicks that preceded him, the Human Torch in the early stories was &quot;a typical adolescent — brash, rebellious, and affectionately obnoxious.&quot; Johnny Storm was killed in the 2011 storyline &quot;Three&quot;, before being brought back and rejoining the reformed Fantastic Four.
* Thing (Ben Grimm) - Reed Richards&#x27; college roommate and best friend, has been transformed into a monstrous, orange, rock-like humanoid possessing high levels of superhuman strength and durability. The Thing is often filled with anger, self-loathing and self-pity over his new existence. He serves as &quot;an uncle figure, a long-term friend of the family with a gruff Brooklyn manner, short temper, and caustic sense of humor&quot;. In the original synopsis Lee gave to Kirby, The Thing was intended as &quot;the heavy&quot;, but over the years, the character has become &quot;the most lovable group member: honest, direct and free of pretension&quot;. Lee said his original pitch to Kirby stated that The Thing was &quot;someone who turned into a monster&quot; and is bitter because unlike the other three he cannot change back to a normal appearance.

The Fantastic Four has had several headquarters, most notably the Baxter Building, located at 42nd Street and Madison Avenue in New York City. The Baxter Building was replaced by Four Freedoms Plaza at the same location after its destruction at the hands of Kristoff Vernard, adopted son of the team&#x27;s seminal foe Doctor Doom (prior to the completion of Four Freedoms Plaza, the team took up temporary residence at Avengers Mansion). Pier 4, a waterfront warehouse, served as a temporary headquarters after Four Freedoms Plaza was destroyed by the ostensible superhero team the Thunderbolts shortly after the revelation that they were actually the supervillain team the Masters of Evil in disguise. Pier 4 was eventually destroyed during a battle with the longtime Fantastic Four supervillain Diablo, after which the team received a new Baxter Building, courtesy of one of team leader Reed Richards&#x27; former professors, Noah Baxter. This second Baxter Building was constructed in Earth&#x27;s orbit and teleported into the vacant lot formerly occupied by the original. After their brief hiatus creating universes after the Secret Wars event, they took residence on 4 Yancy Street before moving back into the newly rebuilt Baxter Building.

==Supporting characters==
===Allies and supporting characters===

A number of characters are closely affiliated with the team, share complex personal histories with one or more of its members but have never actually held an official membership. Some of these characters include, but are not limited to: Namor the Sub-Mariner (previously an antagonist), Alicia Masters, Lyja the Lazerfist, H.E.R.B.I.E., Kristoff Vernard (Doctor Doom&#x27;s former protégé), Wyatt Wingfoot, Sue and Johnny&#x27;s father Franklin Storm, the receptionist android Roberta, governess Agatha Harkness, and Reed and Sue&#x27;s children Franklin Richards and Valeria Richards.

Several allies of the Fantastic Four have served as temporary members of the team, including Crystal, Medusa, Power Man (Luke Cage), Nova (Frankie Raye), She-Hulk, Ms. Marvel (Sharon Ventura), Ant-Man (Scott Lang), Namorita, Storm, and the Black Panther. A temporary lineup from &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; #347–349 (December 1990 – February 1991) consisted of the Hulk (in his &quot;Joe Fixit&quot; persona), Spider-Man, Wolverine, and Ghost Rider.

Other notable characters who have been involved with the Fantastic Four include Alyssa Moy, Caledonia (Alysande Stuart of Earth-9809), Fantastic Force, the Inhumans (particularly the royal family members Black Bolt, Crystal, Medusa, Gorgon, Karnak, Triton, and Lockjaw), Reed&#x27;s father Nathaniel Richards, the Silver Surfer (previously an antagonist), Franklin&#x27;s teleporting pet Puppy, Thundra, postal worker Willie Lumpkin, Baxter Building landlord Walter Collins, the Thing&#x27;s rivals the Yancy Street Gang and Uatu the Watcher.

Author Christopher Knowles states that Kirby&#x27;s work on creations featured in the &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; comics such as the Inhumans and the Black Panther served as &quot;a showcase of some of the most radical concepts in the history of the medium&quot;.

==Antagonists==

Writers and artists over many years have created a variety of characters to challenge the Fantastic Four. Knowles states that Kirby helped to create &quot;an army of villains whose rage and destructive power had never been seen before,&quot; and &quot;whose primary impulse is to smash the world.&quot; Some of the team&#x27;s oldest and most frequent enemies have involved such foes as the Mole Man, the Skrulls, Namor the Sub-Mariner, Doctor Doom, the Puppet Master, Kang the Conqueror/Rama-Tut/Immortus, Blastaar, the Frightful Four, Annihilus, Galactus, and Klaw. Other prominent antagonists of the Fantastic Four have included the Wizard, the Impossible Man, the Red Ghost and the Super-Apes, the Mad Thinker, the Super-Skrull, the Molecule Man, Diablo, Dragon Man, Psycho-Man, Ronan the Accuser, Salem&#x27;s Seven, Terrax the Tamer, Terminus, Hyperstorm, and Lucia von Bardas.

==Fantastic Four Incorporated==
Fantastic Four Incorporated, also known as Fantastic Enterprises, is a fictional organization appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. It was founded by Reed Richards to license use of Richard&#x27;s patents and funded the Fantastic Four&#x27;s operation and their source of income.

Staff are:
*Susan Richards (Invisible Woman) - CEO of Fantastic Four Inc.
*Johnny Storm (Human Torch) - made COO by Susan to give him some work ethic.
*Christi Stoger - with Ethan Crane, tried to frame Johnny Storm for a screw-up to get themselves promoted
*Ethan Crane - with Christi Stoger, tried to frame Johnny Storm for a screw-up to get themselves promoted
*Jian Feeta - Johnny&#x27;s Personal Assistant
*Bethany Palmer - assisted out of abusive relationship with ex-husband, Jeff, by the Invisible Woman
*Jed Schultz - informed Reed about the embezzlement of their funds
*Margaret Kofpulski

== Cultural impact and legacy ==
=== Critical reception ===
Abraham Riesman of &quot;Vulture&quot; included the Fantastic Four in their &quot;12 Teams That Defined Superhero Storytelling&quot; list. Laura Bradley of &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; included the Fantastic Four in their &quot;Stan Lee’s Most Iconic Characters&quot; list. &quot;CBR.com&quot; ranked the Fantastic Four 1st in their &quot;10 Most Fashionable Teams In Marvel Comics&quot; list, 3rd in their &quot;Every Marvel Superhero Team&quot; list, and 5th in their &quot;Marvel: The 10 Strongest Superhero Teams&quot; list. Brooke Wright of &quot;MovieWeb&quot; ranked the Fantastic Four 2nd in their &quot;Most Famous Superhero Families&quot; list. Jason Serafino of &quot;Complex&quot; ranked the Fantastic Four 3rd in their &quot;10 Best Superhero Teams In Comics&quot; list. Michael Doran of &quot;Newsarama&quot; ranked the Fantastic Four 4th in their &quot;Best superhero teams of all time&quot; list. Geoff Boucher of &quot;Deadline&quot; ranked the Fantastic Four 9th in their &quot;Stan Lee’s Legacy: Ranking The Hollywood Heroes Co-Created By The Marvel Comics Icon&quot; list. Chris Isaac of &quot;Screen Rant&quot; ranked the Fantastic Four 15th in their &quot;15 Best Superhero Teams Of All Time&quot; list.

=== Impact ===
The Fantastic Four&#x27;s characterization was initially different from all other superheroes at the time. One major difference is that they do not conceal their identities, leading the public to be both suspicious and in awe of them. Also, they frequently argued and disagreed with each other, hindering their work as a team. Described as &quot;heroes with hangups&quot; by Stan Lee, the Thing has a temper, and the Human Torch resents being a child among adults. Mr. Fantastic blames himself for the Thing&#x27;s transformation. Social scientist Bradford W. Wright describes the team as a &quot;volatile mix of human emotions and personalities.&quot; In spite of their disagreements, they ultimately function well as a team.

The first issue of &quot;The Fantastic Four&quot; proved a success, igniting a new direction for superhero comics and soon influencing many other superhero comics. Readers grew fond of Ben&#x27;s grumpiness, Johnny&#x27;s tendency to annoy others and Reed and Sue&#x27;s spats. Stan Lee was surprised at the reaction to the first issue, leading him to stay in the comics field despite previous plans to leave. Comics historian Stephen Krensky said that &quot;Lee&#x27;s natural dialogue and flawed characters appealed to 1960s kids looking to &#x27;get real.&#x27;&quot;

==== Sales ====
As of 2005, more than 150 million &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; comic books have been sold. In 2022, the first issue of &quot;The Fantastic Four&quot; was sold for 1.5 million dollars at an auction.

==Other versions==

===Marvel 1602===
In the pages of the &quot;Marvel 1602&quot; story titled &quot;Marvel 1602: Fantastick Four&quot;, the Fantastic Four of this reality are known as the Four from the Fantastick who are known explores.

===Marvel 2099===
In the Marvel 2099 reality of Earth-96943, the Fantastic Four of 2099 were revealed to be clones created by Uatu the Watcher. Before Uatu can plan to dispose of the clones, he was talked out of it by the 2099 version of Moon Knight. The clones of the Fantastic Four then established themselves the Fantastic Four of 2099.

===Marvel Apes===
In the &quot;Marvel Apes&quot; reality, the Fantastic Four are primates like every other inhabitant. Mister Fantastic is a baboon, Human Torch is an ape known as the Simian Torch, Invisible Woman was known as Invisible Simian who was also turned into a human, and Thing is a rock-skinned gorilla.

===MC2===
In the &quot;Marvel Comics 2&quot; reality, the Fantastic Four has been upgraded to the Fantastic Five.

===Mutant X===
In the &quot;Mutant X&quot; reality, the Fantastic Four have no powers. Instead, they wear special suits. Mister Fantastic&#x27;s suit has extra mechanical arms, Invisible Woman&#x27;s suit uses stealth technology, Human Torch&#x27;s suit had pyrokinetic abilities and enables him to fly, and Thing wears armor that enables him to possess super-strength.

===Old Man Logan===
In the original &quot;Old Man Logan&quot; reality set in Earth-807128, Hawkeye told Old Man Logan a rumor made by Shocker that Mister Fantastic and Invisible Woman were dumped into the timestream by Kang the Conqueror. Thing&#x27;s arm was seen as a trophy in President Red Skull&#x27;s trophy room. Human Torch&#x27;s fate is unknown.

In the similar reality of Earth-21923 as seen in the pages of &quot;Old Man Quill&quot;, Human Torch and Thing were killed by different supervillains that attacked the Baxter Building causing Invisible Woman to put a forcefield around it. Thing&#x27;s rock skin was later used to decorate the throne of Doctor Doom. An older Star-Lord arrived from the villain-dominated future during the day the villains rose to power in order to get the Ultimate Nullifier needed to stop his time period&#x27;s Universal Church of Truth. This plan didn&#x27;t work as Kang the Conqueror showed up and banished Mister Fantastic and Invisible Woman into the timestream. By the time Star-Lord found them in the timestream, they were found dead where they left him a recorded message apologizing for not believing him and allowed him to have the Ultimate Nullifier.

Because Doctor Doom of Earth-21923 was dying of cancer, he later created clones of the Fantastic Four so that he can die in battle against them. Unfortunately, the clones were flawed due to lack of enough DNA samples of them where the Mister Fantastic clone had his skin melting off his bones, the Invisible Woman clone was melting, the Human Torch clone was not immune to the burns, and the Thing clone came out deformed. The flawed clones all died from their conditions.

===Ultimate Marvel===
In the Ultimate Marvel reality, the Fantastic Four were revealed to have gotten their powers from the N-Zone.

===Ultimate Universe===
During the &quot;Ultimate Invasion&quot; storyline, Maker visited Earth-6160 and remade it into his own image. One of the things he did was delay the launch of the rocket that would&#x27;ve carried Reed Richards, Susan Storm, Johnny Storm, and Ben Grimm into outer space. Maker&#x27;s memory log lists Susan Storm, Johnny Storm, and Ben Grimm as &quot;dead&quot; and Reed Richards as &quot;controlled&quot;.

More of the flashback revealed that Reed, Susan, Johnny, and Ben went against the orders of their space program&#x27;s director Franklin Storm and hijacked a space shuttle. Because of Maker&#x27;s sabotage, Johnny burned to death, Reed and Susan were detained, and Ben was later found dead at the bottom of a quarry. Franklin Storm used his connections to allow an incarcerated Reed to see Susan who is dying from the radiation as Franklin blamed Reed for killing his children. Later, Reed was brought to The City by Maker and tortured into becoming Doom. In the present, Iron Lad learned about Doom&#x27;s history as he experiments with cosmic radiation on four laboratory rats as each of the four laboratory rats keep dying. While having noted his lack of availability in missions, Doom states that he&#x27;ll help out in them if they need him. He also states that when it comes to the day when one group of four rats survive the cosmic radiation experiments, Earth-6160 will have its Fantastic Four.

==In other media==
There have been four &quot;The Fantastic Four&quot; animated series and three released feature films. The Fantastic Four also guest-starred in the &quot;Secret Wars&quot; story arc of the 1990s &quot;Spider-Man&quot; animated series, and the Thing guest-starred (with a small cameo from the other Fantastic Four members) in the &quot;Fantastic Fortitude&quot; episode of the 1996 &quot;The Incredible Hulk&quot; series. The Fantastic Four also appeared in the 2010 series &quot;The Avengers: Earth&#x27;s Mightiest Heroes&quot;.

There was a short-lived radio show in 1975 that adapted early Lee/Kirby stories and is notable for casting a pre-&quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; Bill Murray as the Human Torch. Also in the cast were Bob Maxwell as Reed Richards, Cynthia Adler as Sue Storm, Jim Pappas as Ben Grimm and Jerry Terheyden as Doctor Doom. Other Marvel characters featured in the series included Ant-Man, Prince Namor, Nick Fury and the Hulk. Stan Lee narrated the series and the scripts were taken almost verbatim from the comic books. The radio show was packaged into five-minute segments, with five segments comprising a complete adventure. The team appeared on the Power Records album &quot;Fantastic Four: &quot;The Way It Began&quot;&quot; book and record set, an audio dramatization of &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; #126.

===Television===
The Fantastic Four has been the subject of four animated television series. The first, &quot;The Fantastic Four&quot;, produced by Hanna-Barbera, ran 20 episodes on ABC from September 9, 1967 to September 21, 1968. The second &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; series, produced by DePatie-Freleng, ran 13 episodes from September 9, 1978, to December 16, 1978; this series features a H.E.R.B.I.E. Unit in place of the Human Torch.

In 1979, the Thing was featured as half of the Saturday morning cartoon &quot;Fred and Barney Meet the Thing&quot;. The character of the Thing received a radical make-over for the series. The title character for this program was Benjy Grimm, a teenage boy who possessed a pair of magic Thing-rings which could transform him into the Thing when he put them together and said &quot;Thing-rings, do your thing!&quot; The other members of the Fantastic Four do not appear in the series, nor do the animated &quot;The Flintstones&quot; stars Fred Flintstone and Barney Rubble, despite the title of the program.
The third &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; was broadcast as part of &quot;The Marvel Action Hour&quot; umbrella, with introductions by Stan Lee. This series ran 26 episodes from September 24, 1994 to February 24, 1996. The fourth series, &quot;Fantastic Four: World&#x27;s Greatest Heroes&quot;, debuted on September 2, 2006, on Cartoon Network and ran for 26 episodes.

Different Fantastic Four members appear briefly and with little or no dialogue and are mentioned various times throughout the first season of &quot;The Avengers: Earth&#x27;s Mightiest Heroes&quot;. Their most prominent appearances are in the episode &quot;The Private War of Doctor Doom&quot;, in which the Avengers team up with the Fantastic Four to battle the titular supervillain, and in the final episode of season two, in which the groups team up to battle Galactus. The Thing becomes a member of the New Avengers in the episode &quot;New Avengers&quot;.

The Fantastic Four make several appearances in &quot;Super Hero Squad Show&quot;, such as the episodes &quot;If this Be My Thanos&quot; and &quot;Last Exit Before Doomsday&quot;.

The Fantastic Four appear in the &quot;Hulk and the Agents of S.M.A.S.H.&quot; episode &quot;Monster No More&quot;, where the Agents of S.M.A.S.H. assist them in thwarting the Tribbitite invasion.

===Film===

A film adaptation of the characters, &quot;The Fantastic Four&quot;, was completed in 1994 by producer Roger Corman and starred Alex Hyde-White as Reed Richards/Mr. Fantastic, Rebecca Staab as Sue Storm-Richards/Invisible Woman, Jay Underwood as Johnny Storm/Human Torch, Michael Bailey Smith as Ben Grimm and Carl Ciarfalio as The Thing and Joseph Culp as Victor von Doom/Doctor Doom. The film was made to allow Constantin Film to keep the film rights to the characters, and therefore was not publicly released, though it has since been made available through bootleg video distributors. According to producer Bernd Eichinger, Avi Arad had Marvel purchase the film for a few million dollars.

In 2005, the second film adaptation, &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; directed by Tim Story, was released by 20th Century Fox. Despite mixed reviews from critics, it earned US$155 million in North America and $330 million worldwide. The sequel, &quot;Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer&quot;, directed by Story and written by Don Payne, was released in 2007. Despite mixed-to-negative reviews, the sequel earned $132 million in North America and a total of $330.6 million worldwide. Both films feature Ioan Gruffudd as Reed Richards / Mr. Fantastic, Jessica Alba as Susan Storm / Invisible Woman, Chris Evans as Johnny Storm / Human Torch, Michael Chiklis as Ben Grimm / The Thing, and Julian McMahon as Victor Von Doom / Dr. Doom. Stan Lee makes cameo appearances as the mailman Willie Lumpkin in the first film and as himself in the second film.

A reboot directed by Josh Trank (also titled &quot;Fantastic Four&quot;, but stylized as &quot;Fant4stic&quot;) was released on August 7, 2015. The film stars Miles Teller as Reed Richards, Kate Mara as Sue Storm, Michael B. Jordan as Johnny Storm, Jamie Bell as Ben Grimm and Toby Kebbell as Doctor Doom. It is based on &quot;Ultimate Fantastic Four&quot;. It earned poor reviews and box office results. On March 20, 2019, due to the acquisition of 21st Century Fox by Disney, the film rights of &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; reverted to Marvel Studios.

In July 2019 at San Diego Comic-Con, producer and head of Marvel Studios Kevin Feige, announced that a Fantastic Four film set within the Marvel Cinematic Universe, later titled &quot;The Fantastic Four: First Steps&quot;, is in development. In December 2020, it was announced Jon Watts will direct the film, but he left the project for personal reasons in April 2022. On September 10, 2022 at the D23 Expo, Kevin Feige revealed director Matt Shakman would be taking over the film, with a release date of November 8, 2024. On September 21, 2022, Jeff Kaplan and Ian Springer were announced to be writers for the film. By March 2023, Josh Friedman was hired to rewrite the script. In February 2024, Pedro Pascal, Vanessa Kirby, Joseph Quinn and Ebon Moss-Bachrach were officially announced as Reed Richards, Sue Storm, Johnny Storm and Ben Grimm.

===Video games===
In 1985, the Fantastic Four starred in &quot;&quot;, an adventure game from Adventure International for the Atari 8-bit series. In 1997, the group starred in the &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; video game. The team appeared in the &quot;Spider-Man: The Animated Series&quot; video game, based on the 1990s Spider-Man animated series, for the Super NES and Sega Genesis. The Thing and the Human Torch appeared in the 2005 game &quot;Marvel Nemesis: Rise of the Imperfects&quot;.

All of the Fantastic Four appear as playable characters in the game &quot;&quot; with Doctor Doom being the main enemy. The members of the Fantastic Four are also featured in &quot;&quot;, although the team is separated over the course of the game, with Mister Fantastic being &#x27;locked&#x27; into the Pro-Registration side of the game&#x27;s storyline and the Thing briefly becoming unavailable to the player - just as he left America in protest of the war - until he returns to assist in preventing civilian casualties during the conflict. The Fantastic Four also appear in &quot;Marvel Ultimate Alliance 3: The Black Order&quot; this time as playable DLC (downloadable content) alongside additional members of Marvel Knights and the X-Men.

The Human Torch has an appearance in a mini-game where the player races against him in all versions of &quot;Ultimate Spider-Man&quot;, except on the Game Boy Advance platform. The Fantastic Four star in tie-in videogames based on the 2005 film &quot;Fantastic Four&quot;, and its sequel. The Fantastic Four are also playable characters in &quot;Marvel Heroes&quot;, &quot;Lego Marvel Super Heroes,&quot; and &quot;Marvel Rivals&quot;.

The Fantastic Four starred in their own virtual pinball game Fantastic Four for &quot;Pinball FX 2&quot; released by Zen Studios.

<doc id="11665" wikidata="Q244772" url="?curid=11665" title="Filtration">
<text>Filtration is a physical separation process that separates solid matter and fluid from a mixture using a &quot;filter medium&quot; that has a complex structure through which only the fluid can pass. Solid particles that cannot pass through the filter medium are described as &quot;oversize&quot; and the fluid that passes through is called the &quot;filtrate&quot;. Oversize particles may form a filter cake on top of the filter and may also block the filter lattice, preventing the fluid phase from crossing the filter, known as &quot;blinding&quot;. The size of the largest particles that can successfully pass through a filter is called the effective &quot;pore size&quot; of that filter. The separation of solid and fluid is imperfect; solids will be contaminated with some fluid and filtrate will contain fine particles (depending on the pore size, filter thickness and biological activity). Filtration occurs both in nature and in engineered systems; there are biological, geological, and industrial forms. In everyday usage the verb &quot;strain&quot; is more often used; for example, using a colander to drain cooking water from cooked pasta.

Oil filtration refers to the method of purifying oil by removing impurities that can degrade its quality. Contaminants can enter the oil through various means, including wear and tear of machinery components, environmental factors, and improper handling during oil changes. The primary goal of oil filtration is to enhance the oil’s performance, thereby protecting the machinery and extending its service life.

Filtration is also used to describe biological and physical systems that not only separate solids from a fluid stream but also remove chemical species and biological organisms by entrainment, phagocytosis, adsorption and absorption. Examples include slow sand filters and trickling filters. It is also used as a general term for macrophage in which organisms use a variety of means to filter small food particles from their environment. Examples range from the microscopic &quot;Vorticella&quot; up to the basking shark, one of the largest fishes, and the baleen whales, all of which are described as filter feeders.

==Physical processes==
* Filtration is used to separate particles and fluid in a suspension, where the fluid can be a liquid, a gas or a supercritical fluid. Depending on the application, either one or both of the components may be isolated.
* Filtration, as a physical operation enables materials of different chemical compositions to be separated. A solvent is chosen which dissolves one component, while not dissolving the other. By dissolving the mixture in the chosen solvent, one component will go into the solution and pass through the filter, while the other will be retained.
* Filtration is widely used in chemical engineering. It may be combined with other unit operations to process the feed stream, as in the biofilter, which is a combined filter and biological digestion device.
* Filtration differs from sieving, where separation occurs at a single perforated layer (a sieve). In sieving, particles that are too big to pass through the holes of the sieve are retained (see particle size distribution). In filtration, a multilayer lattice retains those particles that are unable to follow the tortuous channels of the filter. Oversize particles may form a cake layer on top of the filter and may also block the filter lattice, preventing the fluid phase from crossing the filter (blinding). Commercially, the term filter is applied to membranes where the separation lattice is so thin that the surface becomes the main zone of particle separation, even though these products might be described as sieves.
* Filtration differs from adsorption, where separation relies on surface charge. Some adsorption devices containing activated charcoal and ion-exchange resin are commercially called filters, although filtration is not their principal mechanical function.
* Filtration differs from removal of magnetic contaminants from fluids with magnets (typically lubrication oil, coolants and fuel oils) because there is no filter medium. Commercial devices called &quot;magnetic filters&quot; are sold, but the name reflects their use, not their mode of operation.
* In biological filters, oversize particulates are trapped and ingested and the resulting metabolites may be released. For example, in animals (including humans), renal filtration removes waste from the blood, and in water treatment and sewage treatment, undesirable constituents are removed by adsorption into a biological film grown on or in the filter medium, as in slow sand filtration.

===Methods===
Filters may be used for the purpose of removing unwanted liquid from a solid residue, cleaning unwanted solids from a liquid, or simply to separate the solid from the liquid.

There are many different methods of filtration; all aim to attain the separation of substances. Separation is achieved by some form of interaction between the substance or objects to be removed and the filter. The substance that is to pass through the filter must be a fluid, i.e. a liquid or gas. Methods of filtration vary depending on the location of the targeted material, i.e. whether it is dissolved in the fluid phase or suspended as a solid.

There are several laboratory filtration techniques depending on the desired outcome namely, hot, cold and vacuum filtration. Some of the major purposes of obtaining the desired outcome are, for the removal of impurities from a mixture or, for the isolation of solids from a mixture.

Hot filtration method is mainly used to separate solids from a hot solution. This is done to prevent crystal formation in the filter funnel and other apparatus that come in contact with the solution. As a result, the apparatus and the solution used are heated to prevent the rapid decrease in temperature which in turn, would lead to the crystallisation of the solids in the funnel and hinder the filtration process.
One of the most important measures to prevent the formation of crystals in the funnel and to undergo effective hot filtration is the use stemless filter funnel. Due to the absence of a stem in the filter funnel, there is a decrease in the surface area of contact between the solution and the stem of the filter funnel, hence preventing re-crystallization of solid in the funnel, and adversely affecting the filtration process.
Cold filtration method is the use of an ice bath to rapidly cool the solution to be crystallized rather than leaving it to cool slowly in the room atmosphere. This technique results in the formation of very small crystals as opposed to getting large crystals by cooling the solution at room temperature.

Vacuum filtration technique is mostly preferred for small batches of solution to dry small crystals quickly. This method requires a Büchner funnel, filter paper of a smaller diameter than the funnel, Büchner flask, and rubber tubing to connect to a vacuum source.

Centrifugal filtration is carried out by rapidly rotating the substance to be filtered. The more dense material is separated from the less dense matter by the horizontal rotation.

Gravity filtration is the process of pouring the mixture from a higher location to a lower one. It is frequently accomplished via simple filtration, which involves placing filter paper in a glass funnel with the liquid passing through by gravity while the insoluble solid particles are caught by the filter paper. Filter cones, fluted filters, or filtering pipets can all be employed, depending on the amount of the substance at hand. Gravity filtration is in widespread everyday use, for example for straining cooking water from food, or removing contaminants from a liquid.

===Filtering force===
Only when a driving force is supplied will the fluid to be filtered be able to flow through the filter media. Gravity, centrifugation, applying pressure to the fluid above the filter, applying a vacuum below the filter, or a combination of these factors may all contribute to this force. In both straightforward laboratory filtrations and massive sand-bed filters, gravitational force alone may be utilized. Centrifuges with a bowl holding a porous filter media can be thought of as filters in which a centrifugal force several times stronger than gravity replaces gravitational force. A partial vacuum is typically provided to the container below the filter media when laboratory filtration is challenging to speed up the filtering process. Depending on the type of filter being used, the majority of industrial filtration operations employ pressure or vacuum to speed up filtering and reduce the amount of equipment needed.

===Filter media===

Filter media are the materials used to do the separation of materials.

Two main types of filter media are employed in laboratories: 
*&quot;Surface filters&quot; are solid sieves with a mesh to trap solid particles, sometimes with the aid of filter paper (e.g. Büchner funnel, belt filter, rotary vacuum-drum filter, cross-flow filters, screen filter).
* &quot;Depth filters&quot;, beds of granular material which retain the solid particles as they pass (e.g. sand filter).

Surface filters allow the solid particles, i.e. the residue, to be collected intact; depth filters do not. However, the depth filter is less prone to clogging due to the greater surface area where the particles can be trapped. Also, when the solid particles are very fine, it is often cheaper and easier to discard the contaminated granules than to clean the solid sieve.
Filter media can be cleaned by rinsing with solvents or detergents or backwashing. Alternatively, in engineering applications, such as swimming pool water treatment plants, they may be cleaned by backwashing. Self-cleaning screen filters utilize point-of-suction backwashing to clean the screen without interrupting system flow.

====Achieving flow through the filter====
Fluids flow through a filter due to a pressure difference—fluid flows from the high-pressure side to the low-pressure side of the filter. The simplest method to achieve this is by gravity which can be seen in the coffeemaker example. In the laboratory, pressure in the form of compressed air on the feed side (or vacuum on the filtrate side) may be applied to make the filtration process faster, though this may lead to clogging or the passage of fine particles. Alternatively, the liquid may flow through the filter by the force exerted by a pump, a method commonly used in industry when a reduced filtration time is important. In this case, the filter need not be mounted vertically.

===Filter aid===
Certain filter aids may be used to aid filtration. These are often incompressible diatomaceous earth, or kieselguhr, which is composed primarily of silica. Also used are wood cellulose and other inert porous solids such as the cheaper and safer perlite. Activated carbon is often used in industrial applications that require changes in the filtrate&#x27;s properties, such as altering colour or odour.

These filter aids can be used in two different ways. They can be used as a precoat before the slurry is filtered. This will prevent gelatinous-type solids from plugging the filter medium and also give a clearer filtrate. They can also be added to the slurry before filtration. This increases the porosity of the cake and reduces the resistance of the cake during filtration. In a rotary filter, the filter aid may be applied as a precoat; subsequently, thin slices of this layer are sliced off with the cake.

The use of filter aids is usually limited to cases where the cake is discarded or where the precipitate can be chemically separated from the filter.

===Alternatives===
Filtration is a more efficient method for the separation of mixtures than decantation but is much more time-consuming. If very small amounts of solution are involved, most of the solution may be soaked up by the filter medium.

An alternative to filtration is centrifugation. Instead of filtering the mixture of solid and liquid particles, the mixture is centrifuged to force the (usually) denser solid to the bottom, where it often forms a firm cake. The liquid above can then be decanted. This method is especially useful for separating solids that do not filter well, such as gelatinous or fine particles. These solids can clog or pass through the filter, respectively.

==Biological filtration==
Biological filtration may take place inside an organism, or the biological component may be grown on a medium in the material being filtered. Removal of solids, emulsified components, organic chemicals and ions may be achieved by ingestion and digestion, adsorption or absorption. Because of the complexity of biological interactions, especially in multi-organism communities, it is often not possible to determine which processes are achieving the filtration result. At the molecular level, it may often be by individual catalytic enzyme actions within an individual organism. The waste products of some organisms may subsequently broken down by other organisms to extract as much energy as possible and in so doing reduce complex organic molecules to very simple inorganic species such as water, carbon dioxide and nitrogen.

===Excretion===
In mammals, reptiles, and birds, the kidneys function by renal filtration whereby the glomerulus selectively removes undesirable constituents such as urea, followed by selective reabsorption of many substances essential for the body to maintain homeostasis. The complete process is termed excretion by urination. Similar but often less complex solutions are deployed in all animals, even the protozoa, where the contractile vacuole provides a similar function.

===Biofilms===

Biofilms are often complex communities of bacteria, phages, yeasts and often more complex organisms including protozoa, rotifers and annelids which form dynamic and complex, frequently gelatinous films on wet substrates. Such biofilms coat the rocks of most rivers and the sea and they provide the key filtration capability of the Schmutzdecke on the surface of slow sand filters and the film on the filter media of trickling filters which are used to create potable water and treat sewage respectively.

An example of a biofilm is a biological slime, which may be found in lakes, rivers, rocks, etc. The utilization of single- or dual-species biofilms is a novel technology since natural biofilms are sluggishly developing. The use of biofilms in the biofiltration process allows for the attachment of desirable biomass and critical nutrients to immobilized support. So that water may be reused for various processes, advances in biofiltration methods assist in removing significant volumes of effluents from wastewater.

Systems for biologically treating wastewater are crucial for enhancing both human health and water quality. Biofilm technology, the formation of biofilms on various filter media, and other factors have an impact on the growth structure and function of these biofilms. To conduct a thorough investigation of the composition, diversity, and dynamics of biofilms, it also takes on a variety of traditional and contemporary molecular approaches.

===Filter feeders===

Filter feeders are organisms that obtain their food by filtering their, generally aquatic, environment. Many of the protozoa are filter feeders using a range of adaptations including rigid spikes of protoplasm held in the water flow as in the suctoria to various arrangements of beating cillia to direct particles to the mouth including organisms such as &quot;Vorticella&quot; which have a complex ring of cilia which create a vortex in the flow drafting particles into the oral cavity. Similar feeding techniques are used by the Rotifera and the Ectoprocta. Many aquatic arthropods are filter feeders. Some use rhythmical beating of abdominal limbs to create a water current to the mouth whilst the hairs on the legs trap any particle. Others such as some caddis flies spin fine webs in the water flow to trap particles.

==Examples==

Many filtration processes include more than one filtration mechanism, and particulates are often removed from the fluid first to prevent clogging of downstream elements.

Particulate filtration includes:
* The coffee filter to separate the coffee infusion from the grounds.
* HEPA filters in air conditioning to remove particles from air.
* Belt filters to extract precious metals in mining.
* Vertical plate filter such as those used in Merrill–Crowe process.
* The Nutsche filter is typically used in pharmaceutical applications or batch processes that need to capture solids.
* Furnaces use filtration to prevent the furnace elements from fouling with particulates.
* A pneumatic conveying system such as an industrial exhaust duct system often employs filtration to stop or slow the flow of unwanted material that is transported, through the use of a baghouse.
* In the laboratory, a Büchner funnel is often used, with a filter paper serving as the porous barrier.
* Air filters are commonly used to remove airborne particulate matter in building ventilation systems, combustion engines, and industrial processes.
* Oil filter in automobiles, often as a canister or cartridge.
* Aquarium filter
* Straining water from food with a colander

Adsorption filtration removes contaminants by adsorption of the contaminant by the filter medium. This requires intimate contact between the filter medium and the filtrate, and takes time for diffusion to bring the contaminant into direct contact with the medium while passing through it, referred to as &quot;&quot;. Slower flow also reduces pressure drop across the filter. Applications include:
* Carbon dioxide removal from breathing gas in rebreathers and life-support systems using scrubber filters,
* Activated carbon filters to remove volatile hydrocarbons, odours, and other contaminants from recirculated breathing gas in closed habitats.

Combined applications include:

* Compressed breathing air production, where the air passes through a particulate filter before entering the compressor, which removes particles likely to damage the compressor, followed by droplet separation after post-compression cooling and final product adsorption filtration to remove gaseous hydrocarbons contaminants and excessive water vapour. In some cases prefilters using adsorption media are used to control carbon dioxide levels, pressure swing adsorption may be used to increase oxygen fraction, and where the risk of carbon monoxide contamination exists, hopcalite catalytic converters may be included in the filtration media of the product. All these processes are broadly referred to as aspects of the filtration of the product.
* Potable water treatment using biofilm filtration in slow sand filters.
* Wastewater treatment using biofilm filtration using trickling filters.

<text>Follies is a musical with music and lyrics by Stephen Sondheim and a book by James Goldman.

The plot centers on a crumbling Broadway theater, now scheduled for demolition, previously home to a musical revue (based on the &quot;Ziegfeld Follies&quot;). The evening follows a reunion of the Weismann Girls who performed during the interwar period. Several of the former showgirls perform their old numbers, often accompanied by the ghosts of their younger selves. The score offers a pastiche of 1920s and 1930s musical styles, evoking a nostalgic tone.

The original Broadway production, directed by Harold Prince and Michael Bennett, with choreography by Bennett, opened April 4, 1971. The musical was nominated for 11 Tony Awards and won seven at the 26th Tony Awards. The original production, among the most costly on Broadway, ran for over 500 performances but ultimately lost its entire investment. The musical has had a number of major revivals, and several of its songs have become standards, including &quot;Broadway Baby&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m Still Here&quot;, &quot;Too Many Mornings&quot;, &quot;Could I Leave You?&quot;, and &quot;Losing My Mind&quot;.
==Background==
After the failure of &quot;Do I Hear a Waltz?&quot; (1965), for which he had written the lyrics to Richard Rodgers&#x27;s music, Stephen Sondheim decided that he would henceforth work only on projects where he could write both the music and lyrics himself. He asked author and playwright James Goldman to join him as bookwriter for a new musical. Inspired by a &quot;New York Times&quot; article about a gathering of former Ziegfeld Girls, they decided upon a story about ex-showgirls.

Originally titled &quot;The Girls Upstairs&quot;, the musical was to be produced by David Merrick and Leland Hayward in late 1967, but the plans ultimately fell through, and Stuart Ostrow became the producer, with Joseph Hardy as director. These plans also did not work out, and finally Harold Prince, who had worked previously with Sondheim, became the producer and director. He had agreed to work on &quot;The Girls Upstairs&quot; if Sondheim agreed to work on &quot;Company&quot;; Michael Bennett, the young choreographer of &quot;Company&quot;, was also brought onto the project. It was Prince who changed the title to &quot;Follies&quot;; he was &quot;intrigued by the psychology of a reunion of old chorus dancers and loved the play on the word &#x27;follies.

==Plot==
In 1971, on the soon-to-be-demolished stage of the Weismann Theatre, a reunion is being held to honor the Weismann&#x27;s &quot;Follies&quot; shows past and the beautiful chorus girls who performed there every year between the two world wars. The once resplendent theater is now little but planks and scaffolding (&quot;Prologue&quot;/&quot;Overture&quot;). As the ghosts of the young showgirls slowly drift through the theater, a majordomo enters with his entourage of waiters and waitresses. They pass through the spectral showgirls without seeing them.

Sally Durant Plummer, &quot;blond, petite, sweet-faced&quot; and at 49 &quot;still remarkably like the girl she was thirty years ago&quot;, a former Weismann girl, is the first guest to arrive, and her ghostly youthful counterpart moves towards her. Phyllis Rogers Stone, a stylish and elegant woman, arrives with her husband Ben, a renowned philanthropist and politician. As their younger counterparts approach them, Phyllis comments to Ben about their past. He feigns a lack of interest; there is an underlying tension in their relationship. As more guests arrive, Sally&#x27;s husband, Buddy, enters. He is a salesman, in his early 50s, appealing and lively, whose smiles cover inner disappointment.

Finally, Weismann enters to greet his guests. Roscoe, the old master of ceremonies, introduces the former showgirls (&quot;Beautiful Girls&quot;). Former Weismann performers at the reunion include Max and Stella Deems, who lost their radio jobs and became store owners in Miami; Solange La Fitte, a coquette, who is vibrant and flirtatious even at 66; Hattie Walker, who has outlived five younger husbands; Vincent and Vanessa, former dancers who now own an Arthur Murray franchise; Heidi Schiller, for whom Franz Lehár once wrote a waltz (&quot;or was it Oscar Straus?&quot; Facts never interest her; what matters is the song!); and Carlotta Campion, a film star who has embraced life and benefited from every experience.

As the guests reminisce, the stories of Ben, Phyllis, Buddy, and Sally unfold. Phyllis and Sally were roommates while in the Follies, and Ben and Buddy were best friends at school in New York. When Sally sees Ben, her former lover, she greets him self-consciously (&quot;Don&#x27;t Look at Me&quot;). Buddy and Phyllis join their spouses and the foursome reminisces about the old days of their courtship and the theater, their memories vividly coming to life in the apparitions of their young counterparts (&quot;Waiting For The Girls Upstairs&quot;). Each of the four is shaken at the realization of how life has changed them. Elsewhere, Willy Wheeler (portly, in his sixties) cartwheels for a photographer. Emily and Theodore Whitman, ex-vaudevillians in their seventies, perform an old routine (&quot;The Rain on the Roof&quot;). Solange proves she is still fashionable at what she claims is 66 (&quot;Ah, Paris!&quot;), and Hattie Walker performs her old showstopping number (&quot;Broadway Baby&quot;).

Buddy warns Phyllis that Sally is still in love with Ben, and she is shaken by how the past threatens to repeat itself. Sally is awed by Ben&#x27;s apparently glamorous life, but Ben wonders if he made the right choices and considers how things might have been (&quot;The Road You Didn&#x27;t Take&quot;). Sally tells Ben how her days have been spent with Buddy, trying to convince him (and herself) that she is happily married. (&quot;In Buddy&#x27;s Eyes&quot;). However, it is clear that Sally is still in love with Ben – even though their affair ended badly when Ben decided to marry Phyllis. She shakes loose from the memory and begins to dance with Ben, who is touched by the memory of the Sally he once cast aside.

Phyllis interrupts this tender moment and has a biting encounter with Sally. Before she has a chance to really let loose, they are both called on to participate in another performance – Stella Deems gets Sally, Phyllis, Emily, Hattie, and some others to perform an old number (&quot;Who&#x27;s That Woman?&quot;), as they are mirrored by their younger selves. Afterward, Phyllis and Ben angrily discuss their lives and relationship, which has become numb and emotionless. Sally is bitter, having never been happy with Buddy, although he has always adored her. She accuses him of having affairs while he is on the road, and he admits he has a steady girlfriend, Margie, in another town, but always returns home. Carlotta amuses a throng of admirers with a tale of how her dramatic solo was cut from the Follies because the audience found it humorous, transforming it as she sings it into an anthem-like toast to her own hard-won survival (&quot;I&#x27;m Still Here&quot;).

Ben confides to Sally that his life is empty. She yearns for him to hold her, but young Sally slips between them and the three move together (&quot;Too Many Mornings&quot;). Ben, caught in the passion of memories, kisses Sally as Buddy watches from the shadows. Sally thinks this is a sign that the two will finally get married, and Ben is about to protest until Sally interrupts him with a kiss and runs off to gather her things, thinking that the two will leave together. Buddy leaves the shadows furious, and fantasizes about the girl he should have married, Margie, who loves him and makes him feel like &quot;a somebody&quot;, but bitterly concludes he does not love her back (&quot;The Right Girl&quot;). He tells Sally that he&#x27;s done, but she is lost in a fantasy world and tells him that Ben has asked her to marry him. Buddy tells her she must be either crazy or drunk, but he&#x27;s already supported Sally through rehab clinics and mental hospitals and cannot take any more. Ben drunkenly propositions Carlotta, with whom he once had a fling, but she has a young lover and coolly turns him down. Heidi Schiller, joined by her younger counterpart, performs &quot;One More Kiss&quot;, her aged voice a stark contrast to the sparkling coloratura of her younger self. Phyllis kisses a waiter and confesses to him that she had always wanted a son. She then tells Ben that their marriage can&#x27;t continue the way it has been. Ben replies by saying that he wants a divorce, and Phyllis assumes the request is due to his love for Sally. Ben denies this, but still wants Phyllis out of his life. Angry and hurt, Phyllis considers whether to grant his request (&quot;Could I Leave You?&quot;).

Phyllis begins wondering at her younger self, who worked so hard to become the socialite that Ben needed. Ben yells at his younger self for not appreciating all the work that Phyllis did. Both Buddys enter to confront the Bens about how they stole Sally. Sally and her younger self enter and Ben firmly tells Sally that he never loved her. All the voices begin speaking and yelling at each other. Suddenly, at the peak of madness and confusion, the couples are engulfed by their follies, which transform the rundown theater into a fantastical &quot;Loveland&quot;, an extravaganza even more grand and opulent than the gaudiest Weismann confection: &quot;the place where lovers are always young and beautiful, and everyone lives only for love&quot;. Sally, Phyllis, Ben, and Buddy show their &quot;real and emotional lives&quot; in &quot;a sort of group nervous breakdown&quot;.

What follows is a series of musical numbers performed by the principal characters, each exploring their biggest desires. The two younger couples sing in a counterpoint of their hopes for the future (&quot;You&#x27;re Gonna Love Tomorrow/Love Will See Us Through&quot;). Buddy then appears, dressed in &quot;plaid baggy pants, garish jacket, and a shiny derby hat&quot;, and performs a high-energy vaudeville routine depicting how he is caught between his love for Sally and Margie&#x27;s love for him (&quot;The God-Why-Don&#x27;t-You-Love-Me Blues&quot;). Sally appears next, dressed as a torch singer, singing of her passion for Ben from the past - and her obsession with him now (&quot;Losing My Mind&quot;). In a jazzy dance number, accompanied by a squadron of chorus boys, Phyllis reflects on the two sides of her personality, one naive and passionate and the other jaded and sophisticated and her desire to combine them (&quot;The Story of Lucy and Jessie&quot;). Resplendent in top hat and tails, Ben begins to offer his devil-may-care philosophy (&quot;Live, Laugh, Love&quot;), but stumbles and anxiously calls to the conductor for the lyrics, as he frantically tries to keep going. Ben becomes frenzied, while the dancing ensemble continues as if nothing was wrong. Amidst a deafening discord, Ben screams at all the figures from his past and collapses as he cries out for Phyllis.

&quot;Loveland&quot; has dissolved back into the reality of the crumbling and half-demolished theater; dawn is approaching. Ben admits to Phyllis his admiration for her, and Phyllis shushes him and helps Ben regain his dignity before they leave. After exiting, Buddy escorts the emotionally devastated Sally back to their hotel with the promise to work things out later. Their ghostly younger selves appear, watching them go. The younger Ben and Buddy softly call to their &quot;girls upstairs&quot;, and the Follies end.

The musical numbers &quot;Ah, but Underneath&quot; (replacing &quot;The Story of Lucy and Jessie&quot;), &quot;Country House&quot; (replacing &quot;The Road You Didn&#x27;t Take&quot;), &quot;Make the Most of Your Music&quot; (replacing &quot;Live, Laugh, Love&quot;), &quot;Social Dancing&quot;, and an alternate version of &quot;Loveland&quot; have been incorporated across various productions.

==Analysis==
Hal Prince said: &quot;&quot;Follies&quot; examines obsessive behavior, neurosis and self-indulgence more microscopically than anything I know of.&quot; Bernadette Peters quoted Sondheim on the character of &quot;Sally&quot;: &quot;He said early on that [Sally] is off-balance, to put it mildly. He thinks she&#x27;s very neurotic, and she is very neurotic, so he said to me &#x27;Congratulations. She&#x27;s crazy. Martin Gottfried wrote: &quot;The concept behind &quot;Follies&quot; is theatre nostalgia, representing the rose-colored glasses through which we face the fact of age ... the show is conceived in ghostliness. At its very start, ghosts of Follies showgirls stalk the stage, mythic giants in winged, feathered, black and white opulence. Similarly, ghosts of the Twenties shows slip through the evening as the characters try desperately to regain their youth through re-creations of their performances and inane theatre sentiments of their past.&quot;

Joanne Gordon, author and chair and artistic director, Theatre, at California State University, Long Beach, wrote &quot;&quot;Follies&quot; is in part an affectionate look at the American musical theatre between the two World Wars and provides Sondheim with an opportunity to use the traditional conventions of the genre to reveal the hollowness and falsity of his characters&#x27; dreams and illusions. The emotional high generated by the reunion of the Follies girls ultimately gives way to anger, disappointment, and weary resignation to reality.&quot; &quot;Follies&quot; contains two scores: the Follies pastiche numbers and the book numbers. Some of the Follies numbers imitate the style of particular composers of the early 20th century: &quot;Losing My Mind&quot; is in the style of a George Gershwin ballad &quot;The Man I Love&quot;. Sondheim noted that the song &quot;The God-Why-Don&#x27;t-You-Love-Me Blues&quot; is &quot;another generic pastiche: vaudeville music for chases and low comics, but with a patter lyric... I tried to give it the sardonic knowingness of Lorenz Hart or Frank Loesser.&quot;

&quot;Loveland&quot;, the final musical sequence, (that &quot;consumed the last half-hour of the original&quot; production) is akin to an imaginary 1941 &quot;Ziegfeld Follies&quot; sequence, with Sally, Phyllis, Ben and Buddy performing &quot;like comics and torch singers from a Broadway of yore.&quot; &quot;Loveland&quot; features a string of vaudeville-style numbers, reflecting the leading characters&#x27; emotional problems, before returning to the theater for the end of the reunion party. The four characters are &quot;whisked into a dream show in which each acts out his or her own principal &#x27;folly.

==Versions==
Goldman continued to revise the book of the musical right up to his death, which occurred shortly before the 1998 Paper Mill Playhouse production. Sondheim, too, has added and removed songs that he judged to be problematic in various productions. Ted Chapin, who worked on the original 1971 production and wrote a book about the process in 2003, explains: &quot;Today, &quot;Follies&quot; is rarely performed twice in exactly the same version. James Goldman&#x27;s widow made the observation that the show has morphed throughout its entire life ... The London production had new songs and dialogue. The Paper Mill Playhouse production used some elements from London but stayed close to the original. The 2001 Roundabout Broadway revival, the first major production following Goldman&#x27;s death in 1998, was again a combination of previous versions.&quot;

Major changes were made for the original production in London, which attempted to establish a lighter tone and favored a happier ending than the original Broadway production. According to Joanne Gordon, &quot;When &quot;Follies&quot; opened in London ... it had an entirely different, and significantly more optimistic, tone. Goldman&#x27;s revised book offered some small improvements over the original.&quot;

According to Sondheim, producer Cameron Mackintosh asked for changes for the 1987 London production. &quot;I was reluctantly happy to comply, my only serious balk being at his request that I cut &quot;The Road You Didn&#x27;t Take&quot; ... I saw no reason not to try new things, knowing we could always revert to the original (which we eventually did). The net result was four new songs ... For reasons which I&#x27;ve forgotten, I rewrote &quot;Loveland&quot; for the London production. There were only four showgirls in this version, and each one carried a shepherd&#x27;s crook with a letter of the alphabet on it.&quot;

The musical was written in one act, and the original director, Prince, did not want an intermission, while the co-director, Bennett, wanted two acts. It originally was performed in one act. The 1987 West End, 2005 Barrington Stage Company, the 2001 Broadway revival and Kennedy Center 2011 productions were performed in two acts. However, the August 23, 2011 Broadway preview performance was performed without an intermission. By the time the 2011 Broadway revival opened, it was performed with an intermission in two acts. The 2017 National Theatre production was performed without an interval, along with largely returning to the 1971 book. As with previous productions, however, the production&#x27;s book was unique to this iteration as well.

==Productions==

===1971 original Broadway===
&quot;Follies&quot; had its pre-Broadway tryout at the Colonial Theatre, Boston, from February 20 through March 20, 1971.
&quot;Follies&quot; premiered on Broadway on April 4, 1971, at the Winter Garden Theatre. It was directed by Harold Prince and Michael Bennett, with choreography by Bennett, scenic design by Boris Aronson, costumes by Florence Klotz, and lighting by Tharon Musser. It starred Alexis Smith (Phyllis), John McMartin (Ben), Dorothy Collins (Sally), Gene Nelson (Buddy), along with several veterans of the Broadway and vaudeville stage. The supporting role of Carlotta was created by Yvonne De Carlo and usually is given to a well-known veteran performer who can belt out a song. Other notable performers in the original productions were Fifi D&#x27;Orsay as Solange LaFitte, Justine Johnston as Heidi Schiller, Mary McCarty as Stella Deems, Arnold Moss as Dimitri Weismann, Ethel Shutta as Hattie Walker, and Marcie Stringer and Charles Welch as Emily and Theodore Whitman.

The show closed on July 1, 1972, after 522 performances and 12 previews. According to &quot;Variety&quot;, the production was a &quot;total financial failure, with a cumulative loss of $792,000.&quot; Prince planned to present the musical on the West Coast and then on a national tour. However, the show did not do well in its Los Angeles engagement and plans for a tour ended.

Frank Rich, for many years the chief drama critic for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, had first garnered attention, while an undergraduate at Harvard University, with a lengthy essay for the &quot;Harvard Crimson&quot; about the show, which he had seen during its pre-Broadway run in Boston. He predicted that the show eventually would achieve recognition as a Broadway classic. Rich later wrote that audiences at the original production were baffled and restless.

For commercial reasons, the cast album was cut from two LPs to one early in production. Most songs were therefore heavily abridged and several were left entirely unrecorded. According to Craig Zadan, &quot;It&#x27;s generally felt that ... Prince made a mistake by giving the recording rights of &quot;Follies&quot; to Capitol Records, which in order to squeeze the unusually long score onto one disc, mutilated the songs by condensing some and omitting others.&quot; Chapin confirms this: &quot;Alas ... final word came from Capitol that they would not go for two records ... [Dick Jones] now had to propose cuts throughout the score in consultation with Steve.&quot; &quot;One More Kiss&quot; was omitted from the final release but was restored for CD release. Chapin relates that &quot;there was one song that Dick Jones [producer of the cast album] didn&#x27;t want to include on the album but which Steve Sondheim most definitely did. The song was &quot;One More Kiss&quot;, and the compromise was that if there was time, it would be recorded, even if Jones couldn&#x27;t promise it would end up on the album. (It did get recorded but didn&#x27;t make its way onto the album until the CD reissue years later.)&quot;

===1972 Los Angeles===
The musical was produced at The Muny, St. Louis, Missouri in July 1972 and then transferred to the Shubert Theatre, Century City, California, running from July 22, 1972, through October 1, 1972. It was directed by Prince and starred Dorothy Collins (Sally; replaced by Janet Blair), Alexis Smith (Phyllis), John McMartin (Ben; replaced by Edward Winter), Gene Nelson (Buddy), and Yvonne De Carlo (Carlotta) reprising their original roles. The production was the premiere attraction at the newly constructed 1,800-seat theater, which, coincidentally, was itself razed thirty years later (in 2002, in order to build a new office building), thus mirroring the &quot;Follies&quot; plot line upon which the musical is based.

=== 1979 Australian Premiere ===
The first fully staged Australian production of &quot;Follies&quot; opened at the Camberwell Civic Theatre, Melbourne, Australia on 7 September 1979. The production was presented by the Festival Theatre Company as their 25th anniversary production with Stephen Sondheim&#x27;s permission. The cast included Marie-Therese Byrne (Sally Durant Plummer), Eric Donnison (Benjamin Stone), Bev McKern (Phyllis Rogers Stone), Barry Quin (Buddy Plummer), Val Lehman (Carlotta Campion), Donald Cant (Young Ben), Jim Murphy (Dimitri Weissman), and Bruce McBrien (Major Domo). Rex Callahan was the Director; Jean McQuarrie was the Musical Director (of a 22-piece orchestra); Ronne Arnold was the Choreographer; Terry Ryan was the Costume Designer; Rex Callahan and Terry Ryan were the Scenic Designers; and David Murray was the Lighting Designer.

&quot;Follies&quot; would enjoy a second fully staged production by CLOC Musical Theatre, which ran from 17 October–1 November 1986, at the Alexander Theatre, Monash University, Clayton, Australia. David Wilson was the Director; Kirk Skinner was the Musical Director (of a 29-piece orchestra); Mary Charleston was the Choreographer; Graham McGuffie and Laurie Lane were credited as Set Designers and Scenic Artists; and Graham McGuffie was the Lighting Designer. The cast included Fay Brown (Sally Durant Plummer), Clive Hearne (Benjamin Stone), Bev McKern (repeating her triumphant turn as Phyllis Rogers Stone), Chris Bradtke (Buddy Plummer), Glen Leo (Carlotta Campion), Geoff Upfill (Dimitri Weissman), and Horrie Leek (Major Domo).

===1985 Wythenshawe and Lincoln Center===
A full production ran at the Forum Theatre, Wythenshawe, England, from April 30, 1985, directed by Howard Lloyd-Lewis, design by Chris Kinman, costumes by Charles Cusick-Smith, lighting by Tim Wratten, musical direction by Simon Lowe, and choreographed by Paul Kerryson. The cast included Mary Millar (Sally Durant Plummer), Liz Izen (Young Sally), Meg Johnson (Stella Deems), Les Want (Max Deems), Betty Benfield (Heidi Schiller), Joseph Powell (Roscoe), Chili Bouchier (Hattie Walker), Shirley Greenwood (Emily Whitman), Bryan Burdon (Theodore Whitman), Monica Dell (Solange LaFitte), Jeannie Harris (Carlotta Campion), Josephine Blake (Phyllis Rogers Stone), Kevin Colson (Ben), Debbie Snook (Young Phyllis), Stephen Hale (Young Ben), Bill Bradley (Buddy Plummer), Paul Burton (Young Buddy), David Scase (Dimitri Weismann), Mitch Sebastian (Young Vincent), Kim Ismay (Young Vanessa), Lorraine Croft (Young Stella), and Meryl Richardson (Young Heidi).

A staged concert at Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, was performed on September 6 and 7, 1985. The concert starred Barbara Cook (Sally), George Hearn (Ben), Mandy Patinkin (Buddy), and Lee Remick (Phyllis), and featured Carol Burnett (Carlotta), Betty Comden (Emily), Adolph Green (Theodore), Liliane Montevecchi (Solange LaFitte), Elaine Stritch (Hattie Walker), Phyllis Newman (Stella Deems), Jim Walton (Young Buddy), Howard McGillin (Young Ben), Liz Callaway (Young Sally), Daisy Prince (Young Phyllis), Andre Gregory (Dmitri), Arthur Rubin (Roscoe), and Licia Albanese (Heidi Schiller). Rich, in his review, noted that &quot;As performed at Avery Fisher Hall, the score emerged as an original whole, in which the &#x27;modern&#x27; music and mock vintage tunes constantly comment on each other, much as the script&#x27;s action unfolds simultaneously in 1971 (the year of the reunion) and 1941 (the year the Follies disbanded).&quot;

Among the reasons the concert was staged was to provide an opportunity to record the entire score. The resulting album was more complete than the original cast album. However, director Herbert Ross took some liberties in adapting the book and score for the concert format—dance music was changed, songs were given false endings, the new dialogue was spoken, reprises were added, and Patinkin was allowed to sing &quot;The God-Why-Don&#x27;t-You-Love-Me Blues&quot; as a solo instead of a trio with two chorus girls. Portions of the concert were seen by audiences worldwide in the televised documentary about the making of the concert, also released on videotape and DVD, of&quot; &#x27;Follies&#x27; in Concert&quot;.

===1987 West End===

The musical played in the West End at the Shaftesbury Theatre on July 21, 1987, and closed on February 4, 1989, after 644 performances. The producer was Cameron Mackintosh, the direction was by Mike Ockrent, with choreography by Bob Avian and design by Maria Björnson. The cast featured Diana Rigg (Phyllis), Daniel Massey (Ben), Julia McKenzie (Sally), David Healy (Buddy), Lynda Baron, Leonard Sachs, Maria Charles, Pearl Carr &amp; Teddy Johnson. Dolores Gray was praised as Carlotta, continuing to perform after breaking her ankle, although in a reduced version of the part. During the run, Eartha Kitt replaced Gray, sparking somewhat of a comeback (she went on to perform her own one-woman show at The Shaftesbury Theatre to sell-out houses for three weeks from March 18, 1989, after &quot;Follies&quot; closed). Other cast replacements included Millicent Martin as Phyllis. Julia McKenzie returned to the production for the final four performances.

The book &quot;was extensively reworked by James Goldman, with Sondheim&#x27;s cooperation and also given an intermission.&quot; The producer Cameron Mackintosh did not like &quot;that there was no change in the characters from beginning to end ... In the London production ... the characters come to understand each other.&quot; Sondheim &quot;did not think the London script was as good as the original.&quot; However, he thought that it was &quot;wonderful&quot; that, at the end of the first act, &quot;the principal characters recognized their younger selves and were able to acknowledge them throughout the last thirty minutes of the piece.&quot; Sondheim wrote four new songs: &quot;Country House&quot; (replacing &quot;The Road You Didn&#x27;t Take&quot;), &quot;Loveland&quot; (replacing the song of the same title), &quot;Ah, But Underneath&quot; (replacing &quot;The Story of Lucy and Jessie&quot;, for the non-dancer Diana Rigg), and &quot;Make the Most of Your Music&quot; (replacing &quot;Live, Laugh, Love&quot;).

Critics who had seen the production in New York (such as Frank Rich) found it substantially more &quot;upbeat&quot; and lacking in the atmosphere it had originally possessed. According to the Associated Press (AP) reviewer, &quot;A revised version of the Broadway hit &quot;Follies&quot; received a standing ovation from its opening-night audience and raves from British critics, who stated the show was worth a 16-year wait.&quot; The AP quoted Michael Coveney of the &quot;Financial Times&quot;, who wrote: &quot;&quot;Follies&quot; is a great deal more than a camp love-in for old burlesque buffs and Sondheim aficionados.&quot; In &quot;The New York Times&quot;, the critic Francis X. Clines wrote: &quot;The initial critics&#x27; reviews ranged from unqualified raves to some doubts whether the reworked book of James Goldman is up to the inventiveness of Sondheim&#x27;s songs. &#x27;A truly fantastic evening,&#x27; &quot;The Financial Times&quot; concluded, while the London &quot;Daily News&quot; stated &#x27;The musical is inspired,&#x27; and &quot;The Times&quot; described the evening as &#x27;a wonderful idea for a show which has failed to grow into a story. &quot;The Times&quot; critic Irving Wardle stated &quot;It is not much of a story, and whatever possibilities it may have had in theory are scuppered by James Goldman&#x27;s book ... a blend of lifeless small-talk, bitching and dreadful gags&quot;. Clines further commented: &quot;In part, the show is a tribute to musical stage history, in which the 57-year-old Mr Sondheim is steeped, for he first learned song writing at the knee of Oscar Hammerstein II and became the acknowledged master songwriter who bridged past musical stage romance into the modern musical era of irony and neurosis. &quot;Follies&quot; is a blend of both, and the new production is rounded out with production numbers celebrating love&#x27;s simple hope for young lovers, its extravagant fantasies for Ziegfeld aficionados, and its fresh lesson for the graying principals.&quot;

This production was also recorded on two CDs and was the first full recording.

&quot;Follies&quot; was voted ninth in a BBC Radio 2 listener poll of the UK&#x27;s &quot;Nation&#x27;s Number One Essential Musicals&quot;.

===U.S. regional productions===
Michigan Opera Theatre (MOT) was the first major American opera company to present &quot;Follies&quot; as part of their main stage repertoire, running from October 21, 1988, through November 6. The MOT production starred Nancy Dussault (Sally), John-Charles Kelly (Buddy), Juliet Prowse (Phyllis) and Ron Raines (Ben), Edie Adams (Carlotta), Thelma Lee (Hattie), and Dennis Grimaldi (Vincent).

A production also ran from March to April 1995 at the Theatre Under the Stars, Houston, Texas, and in April to May 1995 at the 5th Avenue Theatre, Seattle with Constance Towers (Phyllis), Judy Kaye (Sally), Edie Adams, Denise Darcel, Virginia Mayo, Maxene Andrews (Hattie), and Karen Morrow (Carlotta). 

The 1998 Paper Mill Playhouse production (Millburn, New Jersey) was directed by Robert Johanson with choreography by Jerry Mitchell and starred Donna McKechnie (Sally), Dee Hoty (Phyllis), Laurence Guittard (Ben), Tony Roberts (Buddy), Kaye Ballard (Hattie ), Eddie Bracken (Weismann), and Ann Miller (Carlotta). Phyllis Newman and Liliane Montevecchi reprised the roles they played in the Lincoln Center production. &quot;Ah, but Underneath&quot; was substituted for &quot;The Story of Lucy and Jessie&quot; in order to accommodate non-dancer Hoty. This production received a full-length recording on two CDs, including not only the entire score as originally written but a lengthy appendix of songs cut from the original production in tryouts. Ben Brantley of The New York Times raved, stating, “In resurrecting the musical memory play that is &quot;Follies,&quot; Mr. Johanson and his first-rate production team are working from the template established by Mr. Prince, Mr. Bennett and the great designers Boris Aronson (sets) and Florence Klotz (costumes). They don&#x27;t reinvent &quot;Follies,&quot; but they do clarify it, without undercutting the show&#x27;s uniquely impressionistic qualities. The production, bolstered by Mr. Mitchell&#x27;s elegant choreography, is especially strong in shifting much of the burden of the four principals&#x27; romantic history from Mr. Goldman&#x27;s book to the imagistic use of the characters&#x27; younger selves.” Brantley also lauded Roberts and McKechnie, writing, “Mr. Roberts brings a lacerating, truly moving rage to Buddy&#x27;s exasperation, especially in the song &quot;The Right Girl,&quot; in which Buddy dances confrontationally with his young alter ego. Ms. McKechnie is beyond fault. The sweet, embattled overeagerness that has characterized her performances since her Tony-winning role in &quot;A Chorus Line&quot; has never been so appropriately or affectingly used. Nor has her voice, which marvelously plumbs the torchy despair of the ballad &quot;Losing My Mind,&quot; ever seemed richer or more controlled.” Ann Miller was singled-out, Brantley declaring, “The fact of the matter is, Ms. Miller is sincere -- heartbreakingly, splendidly so -- when she performs &quot;I&#x27;m Still Here,&quot; the great anthem to survival in show business, and so is the production that features her to such revelatory advantage... She could get away with doing just that, of course, given her own iconic status as the peppy, raven-haired tap dancer with the keyboard smile in MGM movie musicals. Instead, she addresses the audience, in a weathered trumpet of a voice, with the considered earnestness of a woman in a confessional... Ms. Miller&#x27;s solo takes up about five minutes, and she&#x27;s rarely center stage otherwise. But she is the very essence of this emotionally rich, exquisite-looking production, which has been lovingly and precisely directed by Robert Johanson, with matching choreography by Jerry Mitchell. Ms. Miller may get teary-eyed during her song (certainly, you will), but her vision isn&#x27;t blurred by false sentiment. Her Carlotta is a woman who has made a truce with where and what she has been. She can speak directly to who she was.“ This production was met with such glowing reviews that there were calls to transfer it to Broadway. Robert L. Daniels of &quot;Variety&quot; wrote, “The Paper Mill creative team has mounted a dazzling production. From the gloomy backstage climate of catwalks, call-boards and sandbags to a proscenium arch adorned with sculptural ornamentation, Michael Anania&#x27;s set addresses the seedy grandeur of a faded theatrical temple doomed to the wrecking ball. Gregg Barnes has costumed the stately showgirls in a gorgeous array of towering headdresses and butterfly wings. The ghostly statuesque beauties who haunt the old showplace float by in shadowy silver and gray gowns.” However, despite rave reviews, the revival was nixed by book writer James Goldman&#x27;s wife Barbara, who controlled her husband&#x27;s interests in the musical. Barbara Goldman reportedly wanted a different production to be mounted by Roundabout, leading to the eventual 2001 Broadway revival with a different team and cast.

Julianne Boyd directed a fully staged version of &quot;Follies&quot; in 2005 by the Barrington Stage Company (Massachusetts) in June–July 2005. The principal cast included Kim Crosby (Sally), Leslie Denniston (Phyllis), Jeff McCarthy (Ben), Lara Teeter (Buddy), Joy Franz (Solange), Marni Nixon (Heidi), and Donna McKechnie (Carlotta). Stephen Sondheim attended one of the performances.

===1996 and 1998 concerts===
====Dublin concert====
The Dublin Concert was held in May 1996 at the National Concert Hall. Directed by Michael Scott, the cast included Lorna Luft, Millicent Martin, Mary Millar, Dave Willetts, Trevor Jones, Bryan Smyth, Alex Sharpe, Christine Scarry, Aidan Conway and Enda Markey.

====London concert====
A concert was held at Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, London, on December 8, 1996, and broadcast on BBC Radio 2 on February 15, 1997. The cast starred Julia McKenzie (Sally), Donna McKechnie (Phyllis), Denis Quilley (Ben) and Ron Moody (Buddy). This show recreated the original Broadway score.

====Sydney concert====
&quot;Follies&quot; was performed in concert at the Sydney Opera House with the Sydney Symphony Orchestra in February 1998 as the highlight of the Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras and had three performances. It was directed and staged by Stephen Lloyd Helper and produced by Helper and Alistair Thomson for Mardi Gras. It starred Toni Lamond (Sally), Jill Perryman(Carlotta), Judi Connelli (Phyllis), Terence Donovan (Ben), Nancye Hayes (Hattie), Glenn Butcher (Buddy), Ron Haddrick (Dimitri), Susan Johnston (Heidi), and Leonie Page, Maree Johnson, Mitchell Butel, Maureen Howard. The Sydney Symphony was conducted by Maestro Tommy Tycho. It followed a similar presentation at the 1995 Melbourne Festival of Arts with a different cast and orchestra.

===2001 Broadway revival===
A Broadway revival opened at the Belasco Theatre on April 5, 2001, and closed on July 14, 2001, after 117 performances and 32 previews. This Roundabout Theatre limited engagement had been expected to close on September 30, 2001. Directed by Matthew Warchus with choreography by Kathleen Marshall, it starred Blythe Danner (Phyllis), Judith Ivey (Sally), Treat Williams (Buddy), Gregory Harrison (Ben), Marge Champion, Polly Bergen (Carlotta), Joan Roberts (Laurey from the original Broadway production of &quot;Oklahoma!&quot;; later replaced by Marni Nixon), Larry Raiken (Roscoe) and an assortment of famous names from the past. Former MGM and onetime Broadway star Betty Garrett, best known to younger audiences for her television work, played Hattie. It was significantly stripped down (earlier productions had featured extravagant sets and costumes) and was not a success critically.

According to an article in &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot;, &quot;almost every performance of the show played to a full house, more often than not to standing-room-only. Tickets always were tough to come by. The reason the final curtain came down Saturday was that being a production by the Roundabout Theatre Company – a subscription-based &#x27;not-for-profit&#x27; theater company – it was presented under special Equity terms, with its actors paid a minimal fee. To extend the show, it would have been necessary to negotiate new contracts with the entire company ... because of the Belasco&#x27;s limited seating, it wasn&#x27;t deemed financially feasible to do so.&quot;

Theater writer and historian John Kenrick wrote &quot;the bad news is that this &quot;Follies&quot; is a dramatic and conceptual failure. The good news is that it also features some of the most exciting musical moments Broadway has seen in several seasons. Since you don&#x27;t get those moments from the production, the book or the leads, that leaves the featured ensemble, and in &quot;Follies&quot; that amounts to a small army ... Marge Champion and Donald Saddler are endearing as the old hoofers ... I dare you not to fall in love with Betty Garrett&#x27;s understated &quot;Broadway Baby&quot; – you just want to pick her up and hug her. Polly Bergen stops everything cold with &quot;I&#x27;m Still Here&quot;, bringing a rare degree of introspection to a song that is too often a mere belt-fest ... [T]he emotional highpoint comes when Joan Roberts sings &#x27;One More Kiss&#x27;.&quot;

===2002 London revival===
A production was mounted at London&#x27;s Royal Festival Hall in a limited engagement. After previews from August 3, 2002, it opened officially on August 6, and closed on August 31, 2002. Paul Kerryson - who had choreographed the UK premiere in 1984 - directed, and the cast starred David Durham as Ben, Kathryn Evans as Sally, Louise Gold as Phyllis, Julia Goss as Heidi and Henry Goodman as Buddy. Variety singer and performer Joan Savage sang &quot;Broadway Baby&quot;. This production conducted by Julian Kelly featured the original Broadway score.

===2002 Los Angeles===
&quot;Follies&quot; was part of L.A.&#x27;s Reprise series, and it was housed at the Wadsworth Theatre, presented as a staged concert, running from June 15 to 23, 2002. The production was directed by Arthur Allan Seidelman, set design by Ray Klausen, lighting design by Tom Ruzika, costumes by Randy Gardell, sound design by Philip G. Allen, choreography by Kay Cole, musical director Gerald Sternbach.

The production starred Bob Gunton (Ben), Warren Berlinger (Dimitri Weismann), Patty Duke (Phyllis), Vikki Carr (Sally), Harry Groener (Buddy), Carole Cook (Hattie), Carol Lawrence (Vanessa), Ken Page (Roscoe), Liz Torres (Stella), Amanda McBroom (Solange), Grover Dale (Vincent), Donna McKechnie (Carlotta), Carole Swarbrick (Christine), Stella Stevens (Dee Dee), Mary Jo Catlett (Emily), Justine Johnston (Heidi), Jean Louisa Kelly (Young Sally), Austin Miller (Young Buddy), Tia Riebling (Young Phyllis), Kevin Earley (Young Ben), Abby Feldman (Young Stella), Barbara Chiofalo (Young Heidi), Trevor Brackney (Young Vincent), Melissa Driscoll (Young Vanessa), Stephen Reed (Kevin), and Billy Barnes (Theodore). Hal Linden originally was going to play Ben, but left because he was cast in the Broadway revival of &quot;Cabaret&quot; as Herr Schultz. Tom Bosley originally was cast as Dimitri Weismann.

===2003 Ann Arbor===
A concert production at the Michigan Theater in January 2003 reunited the four principal young ghosts of the original Broadway cast: Kurt Peterson, Harvey Evans, Virginia Sandifur, and Marti Rolph. Having originated the young ghosts over 30 years prior, the actors portrayed the older versions of their Broadway roles. Donna McKechnie enjoyed top billing as Carlotta.

===2007 New York City Center Encores!===
New York City Center&#x27;s Encores! &quot;Great American Musicals in Concert&quot; series featured &quot;Follies&quot; as its 40th production for six performances in February 2007 in a sold out semi-staged concert. The cast starred Donna Murphy (Phyllis), Victoria Clark (Sally), Victor Garber (Ben) and Michael McGrath (Buddy). Christine Baranski played Carlotta, and Lucine Amara sang Heidi. The cast included Anne Rogers, Jo Anne Worley and Philip Bosco. The director and choreographer was Casey Nicholaw. This production used the original text, and the &quot;Loveland&quot; lyrics performed in the 1987 London production.

===2011 Kennedy Center and Broadway===
The Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts production at the Eisenhower Theater started previews on May 7, 2011, with an official opening on May 21, and closed on June 19, 2011. The cast starred Bernadette Peters as Sally, Jan Maxwell as Phyllis, Elaine Paige as Carlotta, Linda Lavin as Hattie, Ron Raines as Ben and Danny Burstein as Buddy. The production was directed by Eric Schaeffer, with choreography by Warren Carlyle, costumes by Gregg Barnes, set by Derek McLane and lighting by Natasha Katz. Also featured were Rosalind Elias as Heidi, Régine as Solange, Susan Watson as Emily, and Terri White as Stella. The budget was reported to be $7.3 million. The production played to 95% capacity.

Reviews were mixed, with Ben Brantley of &quot;The New York Times&quot; writing &quot;It wasn&#x27;t until the second act that I fell in love all over again with &quot;Follies&quot;&quot;. Peter Marks of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote that the revival &quot;takes an audience halfway to paradise.&quot; He praised a &quot;broodingly luminous Jan Maxwell&quot; and Burstein&#x27;s &quot;hapless onetime stage-door Johnny&quot;, as well as &quot;the show&#x27;s final 20 minutes, when we ascend with the main characters into an ironic vaudeville dreamscape of assorted neuroses - the most intoxicating articulation of the musical&#x27;s &#x27;Loveland&#x27; sequence that I&#x27;ve ever seen.&quot; &quot;Variety&quot; gave a very favorable review to the &quot;lavish and entirely satisfying production&quot;, saying that Schaeffer directs &quot;in methodical fashion, building progressively to a crescendo exactly as Sondheim does with so many of his stirring melodies. Several show-stopping routines are provided by choreographer Warren Carlyle.&quot; Terry Teachout of &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; noted that &quot;One of the signal achievements of this &quot;Follies&quot; is that it succeeds in untangling each and every strand of the show&#x27;s knotty plot ... Mr. Schaeffer is clearly unafraid of the darkness of &quot;Follies&quot;, so much so that the first act is bitter enough to sting. Yet he and Warren Carlyle ... just as clearly revel in the richness of the knowing pastiche songs with which Mr. Sondheim evokes the popular music of the prerock era.&quot;

The production transferred to Broadway at the Marquis Theatre in a limited engagement starting previews on August 7, 2011, with the official opening on September 12, and closing on January 22, 2012, after 151 performances and 38 previews. The four principal performers reprised their roles, as well as Paige as Carlotta. Jayne Houdyshell as Hattie, Mary Beth Peil as Solange LaFitte, and Don Correia as Theodore joined the Broadway cast. A two-disc cast album of this production was recorded by PS Classics and was released on November 29, 2011.

Brantley reviewed the Broadway revival for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, writing: &quot;Somewhere along the road from Washington to Broadway, the Kennedy Center production of &quot;Follies&quot; picked up a pulse ... I am happy to report that since then, Ms Peters has connected with her inner frump, Mr. Raines has found the brittle skeleton within his solid flesh, and Ms. Maxwell and Mr. Burstein have only improved. Two new additions to the cast, Jayne Houdyshell and Mary Beth Peil, are terrific. This production has taken on the glint of crystalline sharpness.&quot; The production&#x27;s run was extended, and its grosses exceeded expectations, but it did not recoup its investment.

The Broadway production won the Drama League Award, Distinguished Production of a Musical Revival for 2011-2012 and the Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Revival of a Musical, Outstanding Actor in a Musical (Burstein) and Outstanding Costume Design (Barnes). Out of seven Tony Award nominations, including Best Revival of a Musical, it won only one, with Barnes awarded Best Costume Design in a Musical at the 66th Tony Awards.

===2012 Los Angeles===
The 2011 Broadway and Kennedy Center production transferred to the Ahmanson Theatre, Los Angeles, California, in a limited engagement, from May 3, 2012, through June 9. The majority of the Broadway cast reprised their roles, with the exception of Bernadette Peters, who had prior concert commitments and was replaced by Victoria Clark in the role of Sally, a role she had played previously in New York. Other new cast members included Carol Neblett as Heidi, Sammy Williams as Theodore and Obba Babatunde as Max.

===2013 Toulon Opera House (France)===
For its first production in France, &quot;Follies&quot; was presented at the Toulon Opera House in March 2013. This English-language production, using the full original orchestration, was directed by Olivier Bénézech and conducted by David Charles Abell. The cast featured Charlotte Page (Sally), Liz Robertson (Phyllis), Graham Bickley (Ben), Jérôme Pradon (Buddy), Nicole Croisille (Carlotta), Julia Sutton (Hattie) and Fra Fee (Young Buddy).

===2016 Australian concert version===
A concert version at the Melbourne Recital Centre, staged with a full 23-piece orchestra and Australian actors Philip Quast (Ben), David Hobson (Buddy), Lisa McCune (Sally), Anne Wood (Phyllis), Rowan Witt (Young Buddy), Sophie Wright (Young Sally), Nancy Hayes (Hattie), Debra Byrne (Carlotta), and Queenie van de Zandt (Stella). The production was directed by Tyran Parke and produced by StoreyBoard Entertainment.

===2017 London revival===
A London revival was performed in the Olivier Theatre at the National Theatre (August 22 until November 4, 2017 - later extended to January 3, 2018, as extensions are common practice at the National Theatre). The production was directed by Dominic Cooke, choreographed by Bill Deamer and starred Peter Forbes as Buddy, Imelda Staunton as Sally, Janie Dee as Phyllis, Philip Quast as Ben and Tracie Bennett as Carlotta. This production notably goes back to the original plan of a one-act performance. The production was broadcast live to cinemas worldwide on November 16 through the National Theatre Live program.

The production returned to the Olivier Theatre on February 14, 2019, playing until May 11. Janie Dee and Peter Forbes returned as Phyllis and Buddy, while Joanna Riding and Alexander Hanson replaced Staunton and Quast as Sally and Ben. Bennett also reprised her Olivier-nominated performance. A recording of the National Theatre production was released on January 18, 2019.

The 2017 production was nominated for 10 Laurence Olivier Awards and won 2 for Best Musical Revival and Best Costume Design (by Vicki Mortimer) at the 2018 Laurence Olivier Awards.

==Critical response==
In the foreword to &quot;Everything Was Possible&quot;, Frank Rich wrote: &quot;From the start, critics have been divided about &quot;Follies&quot;, passionately pro or con but rarely on the fence ... Is it really a great musical, or merely the greatest of all cult musicals?&quot; (Chapin, p. xi) Ted Chapin wrote, &quot;Taken as a whole, the collection of reviews &quot;Follies&quot; received was as rangy as possible.&quot; (Chapin, p. 300) In his &quot;The New York Times&quot; review of the original Broadway production, Clive Barnes wrote: &quot;it is stylish, innovative, it has some of the best lyrics I have ever encountered, and above all it is a serious attempt to deal with the musical form.&quot; Barnes also called the story shallow and Sondheim&#x27;s words a joy &quot;even when his music sends shivers of indifference up your spine.&quot;

Walter Kerr wrote in &quot;The New York Times&quot; about the original production: &quot;&quot;Follies&quot; is intermissionless and exhausting, an extravaganza that becomes so tedious ... because its extravaganzas have nothing to do with its pebble of a plot.&quot; On the other hand, Martin Gottfried wrote: &quot;&quot;Follies&quot; is truly awesome and, if it is not consistently good, it is always great.&quot;

&quot;Time&quot; magazine wrote about the original Broadway production: &quot;At its worst moments, &quot;Follies&quot; is mannered and pretentious, overreaching for Significance. At its best moments—and there are many—it is the most imaginative and original new musical that Broadway has seen in years.&quot;

Frank Rich, in reviewing the 1985 concert in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, wrote: &quot;Friday&#x27;s performance made the case that this Broadway musical ... can take its place among our musical theater&#x27;s very finest achievements.&quot; Ben Brantley, reviewing the 1998 Paper Mill Playhouse production in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, concluded that it was a &quot;fine, heartfelt production, which confirms &quot;Follies&quot; as a landmark musical and a work of art ...&quot;.

The &quot;Time&quot; reviewer wrote of the 2001 Broadway revival: &quot;Even in its more modest incarnation, &quot;Follies&quot; has, no question, the best score on Broadway.&quot; He noted, though, that &quot;I&#x27;m sorry the cast was reduced from 52 to 38, the orchestra from 26 players to 14 ... To appreciate the revival, you must buy into James Goldman&#x27;s book, which is peddling a panoramically bleak take on marriage.&quot; Finally, he wrote: &quot;But &quot;Follies&quot; never makes fun of the honorable musical tradition to which it belongs. The show and the score have a double vision: simultaneously squinting at the messes people make of their lives and wide-eyed at the lingering grace and lift of the music they want to hear. Sondheim&#x27;s songs aren&#x27;t parodies or deconstructions; they are evocations that recognize the power of a love song. In 1971 or 2001, &quot;Follies&quot; validates the legend that a Broadway show can be an event worth dressing up for.&quot;

Brantley, reviewing the 2007 Encores! concert for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, wrote: &quot;I have never felt the splendid sadness of &quot;Follies&quot; as acutely as I did watching the emotionally transparent concert production ... At almost any moment, to look at the faces of any of the principal performers ... is to be aware of people both bewitched and wounded by the contemplation of who they used to be. When they sing, in voices layered with ambivalence and anger and longing, it is clear that it is their past selves whom they are serenading.&quot;

==Recordings==
There have been six recordings of &quot;Follies&quot; released: the original 1971 Broadway cast album; &quot;Follies in Concert&quot;, Avery Fisher Hall (1985); the original London production (1987); the Paper Mill Playhouse (1998); the 2011 Broadway revival; and the 2017 London revival. The original cast album has always been controversial, because significant portions of the score were cut to fit onto one LP. However, as Kritzerland Records head Bruce Kimmel wrote in his liner notes to Kritzerland&#x27;s remixed version of the album, &quot;What it did have made it something that, despite the frustrations, meant it would never be bettered – the original cast.&quot;
The cast recording of the 2011 Broadway revival, by PS Classics, was released officially on November 29, 2011, and was in pre-sale before the store release. PS Classics co-founder Tommy Krasker stated &quot;We&#x27;ve never had the kind of reaction that we&#x27;ve had for &quot;Follies&quot;. Not only has it already outsold every other album at our website, but the steady stream of emails from customers has been amazing.&quot; This recording includes &quot;extended segments of the show&#x27;s dialogue&quot;. The theatermania.com reviewer wrote that &quot;The result is an album that, more so than any of the other existing recordings, allows listeners to re-experience the heartbreaking collision of past and present that&#x27;s at the core of the piece.&quot; The recording of the 2011 revival was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Musical Theater Album at the 55th Annual Grammy Awards. The 2017 London revival cast was recorded after the production closed in January 2018, and was released in early 2019.

==Film adaptation==
In January 2015, it was reported that Rob Marshall signed on to direct, with Meryl Streep rumored to star. Tony Award-winning playwright and Academy Award-nominated screenwriter John Logan has expressed interest in writing the adaptation.

In November 2019, it was announced that Dominic Cooke will adapt the screenplay as well as direct, following the successful 2017 National Theatre revival in London, which returned in 2019 due to popular demand.

<text>Functional linguistics is an approach to the study of language characterized by taking systematically into account the speaker&#x27;s and the hearer&#x27;s side, and the communicative needs of the speaker and of the given language community. Linguistic functionalism spawned in the 1920s to 1930s from Ferdinand de Saussure&#x27;s systematic structuralist approach to language (1916).

Functionalism sees functionality of language and its elements to be the key to understanding linguistic processes and structures. Functional theories of language propose that since language is fundamentally a tool, it is reasonable to assume that its structures are best analyzed and understood with reference to the functions they carry out. These include the tasks of conveying meaning and contextual information.

Functional theories of grammar belong to structural and, broadly, humanistic linguistics, considering language as being created by the community, and linguistics as relating to systems theory. Functional theories take into account the context where linguistic elements are used and study the way they are instrumentally useful or functional in the given environment. This means that pragmatics is given an explanatory role, along with semantics. The formal relations between linguistic elements are assumed to be functionally-motivated. Functionalism is sometimes contrasted with formalism, but this does not exclude functional theories from creating grammatical descriptions that are &quot;generative&quot; in the sense of formulating rules that distinguish grammatical or well-formed elements from ungrammatical elements.

Simon Dik characterizes the functional approach as follows:

Functional theories of grammar can be divided on the basis of geographical origin or base (though it simplifies many aspects): European functionalist theories include Functional (discourse) grammar and Systemic functional grammar (among others), while American functionalist theories include Role and reference grammar and West Coast functionalism. Since the 1970s, studies by American functional linguists in languages other than English from Asia, Africa, Australia and the Americas (like Mandarin Chinese and Japanese), led to insights about the interaction of form and function, and the discovery of functional motivations for grammatical phenomena, which apply also to the English language.

==History==
===1920s to 1970s: early developments===
The establishment of functional linguistics follows from a shift from structural to functional explanation in 1920s sociology. Prague, at the crossroads of western European structuralism and Russian formalism, became an important centre for functional linguistics.

The shift was related to the organic analogy exploited by Émile Durkheim and Ferdinand de Saussure. Saussure had argued in his &quot;Course in General Linguistics&quot; that the &#x27;organism&#x27; of language should be studied anatomically, and not in respect with its environment, to avoid the false conclusions made by August Schleicher and other social Darwinists. The post-Saussurean functionalist movement sought ways to account for the &#x27;adaptation&#x27; of language to its environment while still remaining strictly anti-Darwinian.

Russian émigrés Roman Jakobson and Nikolai Trubetzkoy disseminated insights of Russian grammarians in Prague, but also the evolutionary theory of Lev Berg, arguing for teleology of language change. As Berg&#x27;s theory failed to gain popularity outside the Soviet Union, the organic aspect of functionalism diminished, and Jakobson adopted a standard model of functional explanation from Ernst Nagel&#x27;s philosophy of science. It is, then, the same mode of explanation as in biology and social sciences; but it became emphasised that the word &#x27;adaptation&#x27; is not to be understood in linguistics in the same meaning as in biology.

Work on functionalist linguistics by the Prague school resumed in the 1950s after a hiatus caused by World War II and Stalinism. In North America, Joseph Greenberg published his 1963 seminal paper on language universals that not only revived the field of linguistic typology, but also the approach of seeking functional explanations for typological patterns. Greenberg&#x27;s approach has been highly influential for the movement of North American functionalism that formed from the early 1970s, which has since been characterized by a profound interest in typology. Greenberg&#x27;s paper was influenced by the Prague School and in particular it was written in response to Jakobson&#x27;s call for an &#x27;implicational typology&#x27;. While North American functionalism was initially influenced by the functionalism of the Prague school, such influence has been later discontinued.

===1980s onward: name controversy===
The term &#x27;functionalism&#x27; or &#x27;functional linguistics&#x27; became controversial in the 1980s with the rise of a new wave of evolutionary linguistics. Johanna Nichols argued that the meaning of &#x27;functionalism&#x27; had changed, and the terms formalism and functionalism should be taken as referring to generative grammar, and the emergent linguistics of Paul Hopper and Sandra Thompson, respectively; and that the term &quot;structuralism&quot; should be reserved for frameworks derived from the Prague linguistic circle. William Croft argued subsequently that it is a fact to be agreed by all linguists that form does not follow from function. He proposed that functionalism should be understood as autonomous linguistics, opposing the idea that language arises functionally from the need to express meaning:

&quot;The notion of autonomy emerges from an undeniable fact of all languages, &#x27;the curious lack of accord ... between form and function&#x27;&quot;

Croft explains that, until the 1970s, functionalism related to semantics and pragmatics, or the &#x27;semiotic function&#x27;. But around 1980s the notion of function changed from semiotics to &quot;external function&quot;, proposing a neo-Darwinian view of language change as based on natural selection. Croft proposes that &#x27;structuralism&#x27; and &#x27;formalism&#x27; should both be taken as referring to generative grammar; and &#x27;functionalism&#x27; to usage-based and cognitive linguistics; while neither André Martinet, Systemic functional linguistics nor Functional discourse grammar properly represents any of the three concepts.

The situation was further complicated by the arrival of evolutionary psychological thinking in linguistics, with Steven Pinker, Ray Jackendoff and others hypothesising that the human language faculty, or universal grammar, could have developed through normal evolutionary processes, thus defending an adaptational explanation of the origin and evolution of the language faculty. This brought about a functionalism versus formalism debate, with Frederick Newmeyer arguing that the evolutionary psychological approach to linguistics should also be considered functionalist.

The terms functionalism and functional linguistics nonetheless continue to be used by the Prague linguistic circle and its derivatives, including SILF, Danish functional school, Systemic functional linguistics and Functional discourse grammar; and the American framework Role and reference grammar which sees itself as the midway between formal and functional linguistics.

==Functional analysis==
Since the earliest work of the Prague School, language was conceived as a &quot;functional system&quot;, where term &quot;system&quot; references back to De Saussure structuralist approach. The term function seems to have been introduced by Vilém Mathesius, possibly influenced from works in sociology. Functional analysis is the examination of how linguistic elements function on different layers of linguistic structure, and how the levels interact with each other. Functions exist on all levels of grammar, even in phonology, where the phoneme has the function of distinguishing between lexical material.
* Syntactic functions: (e.g. Subject and Object), defining different perspectives in the presentation of a linguistic expression.
* Semantic functions: (Agent, Patient, Recipient, etc.), describing the role of participants in states of affairs or actions expressed.
* Pragmatic functions: (Theme and Rheme, Topic and Focus, Predicate), defining the informational status of constituents, determined by the pragmatic context of the verbal interaction.

==Functional explanation==

In the functional mode of explanation, a linguistic structure is explained with an appeal to its function. Functional linguistics takes as its starting point the notion that communication is the primary purpose of language. Therefore, general phonological, morphosyntactic and semantic phenomena are thought of as being motivated by the needs of people to communicate successfully with each other. Thus, the perspective is taken that the organisation of language reflects its use value.

Many prominent functionalist approaches, like Role and reference grammar and Functional discourse grammar, are also typologically oriented, that is they aim their analysis cross-linguistically, rather than only to a single language like English (as is typical of formalist/generativism approaches).

===Economy===
The concept of economy is metaphorically transferred from a social or economical context to a linguistic level. It is considered as a regulating force in language maintenance. Controlling the impact of language change or internal and external conflicts of the system, the economy principle means that systemic coherence is maintained without increasing energy cost. This is why all human languages, no matter how different they are, have high functional value as based on a compromise between the competing motivations of speaker-easiness (simplicity or &quot;inertia&quot;) versus hearer-easiness (clarity or &quot;energeia&quot;).

The principle of economy was elaborated by the French structural–functional linguist André Martinet. Martinet&#x27;s concept is similar to Zipf&#x27;s principle of least effort; although the idea had been discussed by various linguists in the late 19th and early 20th century. The functionalist concept of economy is not to be confused with economy in generative grammar.

===Information structure===
 
Some key adaptations of functional explanation are found in the study of information structure. Based on earlier linguists&#x27; work, Prague Circle linguists Vilém Mathesius, Jan Firbas and others elaborated the concept of theme–rheme relations (topic and comment) to study pragmatic concepts such as sentence focus, and givenness of information, to successfully explain word-order variation. The method has been used widely in linguistics to uncover word-order patterns in the languages of the world. Its importance, however, is limited to within-language variation, with no apparent explanation of cross-linguistic word order tendencies.

===Functional principles===
Several principles from pragmatics have been proposed as functional explanations of linguistic structures, often in a typological perspective.
*Theme first: languages prefer placing the theme before the rheme; and the subject typically carries the role of the theme; therefore, most languages have subject before object in their basic word order.
*Animate first: similarly, since subjects are more likely to be animate, they are more likely to precede the object.
*Given before new: already established information comes before new information.
*First things first: more important or more urgent information comes before other information.
*Lightness: light (short) constituents are ordered before heavy (long) constituents.
*Uniformity: word-order choices are generalised. For example, languages tend to have either prepositions or postpositions; and not both equally.
*Functional load: elements within a linguistic sub-system are made distinct to avoid confusion.
*Orientation: role-indicating particles including adpositions and subordinators are oriented to their semantic head.

==Frameworks==
There are several distinct grammatical frameworks that employ a functional approach.

*The structuralist functionalism of the Prague school was the earliest functionalist framework developed in the 1920s.
*André Martinet&#x27;s Functional Syntax, with two major books, &quot;A functional view of language&quot; (1962) and &quot;Studies in Functional Syntax&quot; (1975). Martinet is one of the most famous French linguists and can be regarded as the father of French functionalism. Founded by Martinet and his colleagues, SILF (&quot;Société internationale de linguistique fonctionnelle&quot;) is an international organisation of functional linguistics which operates mainly in French.
*Simon Dik&#x27;s Functional Grammar, originally developed in the 1970s and 80s, has been influential and inspired many other functional theories. It has been developed into Functional Discourse Grammar by the linguist Kees Hengeveld.
*Michael Halliday&#x27;s systemic functional grammar (SFG) argues that the explanation of how language works &quot;needed to be grounded in a functional analysis, since language had evolved in the process of carrying out certain critical functions as human beings interacted with their ... &#x27;eco-social&#x27; environment&quot;. Halliday draws on the work of Bühler and Malinowski, as well as his doctoral supervisor J.R. Firth. Notably, Halliday&#x27;s former student Robin Fawcett has developed a version of SFG called the &quot;Cardiff Grammar&quot; which is distinct from the &quot;Sydney Grammar&quot; as developed by the later Halliday and his colleagues in Australia. The link between Firthian and Hallidayan linguistics and the philosophy of Alfred North Whitehead also deserves a mention.
*Role and reference grammar, developed by Robert Van Valin employs functional analytical framework with a somewhat formal mode of description. In RRG, the description of a sentence in a particular language is formulated in terms of its semantic structure and communicative functions, as well as the grammatical procedures used to express these meanings. 
*Danish functional grammar combines Saussurean/Hjelmslevian structuralism with a focus on pragmatics and discourse.
*Interactional linguistics, based on Conversation Analysis, considers linguistic structures as related to the functions of e.g. action and turn-taking in interaction.
*Construction grammar is a family of different theories some of which may be considered functional, such as Croft&#x27;s Radical Construction Grammar.
*Relational Network Theory (RNT) or Neurocognitive Linguistics (NCL), originally developed by Sydney Lamb, may be considered functionalist in the sense of being a usage-based model. In RNT, the description of linguistic structure is formulated as networks of realizational relationships, such that all linguistic units are defined only by what they realize and are realized by. RNT networks have been hypothesized to be implemented by cortical minicolumns in the human neocortex.

<text>Fick&#x27;s laws of diffusion describe diffusion and were first posited by Adolf Fick in 1855 on the basis of largely experimental results. They can be used to solve for the diffusion coefficient, . Fick&#x27;s first law can be used to derive his second law which in turn is identical to the diffusion equation.

&quot;Fick&#x27;s first law&quot;: Movement of particles from high to low concentration (diffusive flux) is directly proportional to the particle&#x27;s concentration gradient.

&quot;Fick&#x27;s second law&quot;: Prediction of change in concentration gradient with time due to diffusion.

A diffusion process that obeys Fick&#x27;s laws is called normal or Fickian diffusion; otherwise, it is called anomalous diffusion or non-Fickian diffusion.

== History ==
In 1855, physiologist Adolf Fick first reported his now well-known laws governing the transport of mass through diffusive means. Fick&#x27;s work was inspired by the earlier experiments of Thomas Graham, which fell short of proposing the fundamental laws for which Fick would become famous. Fick&#x27;s law is analogous to the relationships discovered at the same epoch by other eminent scientists: Darcy&#x27;s law (hydraulic flow), Ohm&#x27;s law (charge transport), and Fourier&#x27;s law (heat transport).

Fick&#x27;s experiments (modeled on Graham&#x27;s) dealt with measuring the concentrations and fluxes of salt, diffusing between two reservoirs through tubes of water. It is notable that Fick&#x27;s work primarily concerned diffusion in fluids, because at the time, diffusion in solids was not considered generally possible. Today, Fick&#x27;s laws form the core of our understanding of diffusion in solids, liquids, and gases (in the absence of bulk fluid motion in the latter two cases). When a diffusion process does &quot;not&quot; follow Fick&#x27;s laws (which happens in cases of diffusion through porous media and diffusion of swelling penetrants, among others), it is referred to as &quot;non-Fickian&quot;.

== Fick&#x27;s first law ==
Fick&#x27;s first law relates the diffusive flux to the gradient of the concentration. It postulates that the flux goes from regions of high concentration to regions of low concentration, with a magnitude that is proportional to the concentration gradient (spatial derivative), or in simplistic terms the concept that a solute will move from a region of high concentration to a region of low concentration across a concentration gradient. In one (spatial) dimension, the law can be written in various forms, where the most common form (see) is in a molar basis:
: formula_1
where
* is the diffusion flux, of which the dimension is the amount of substance per unit area per unit time. measures the amount of substance that will flow through a unit area during a unit time interval,
* is the diffusion coefficient or diffusivity. Its dimension is area per unit time,
* formula_2 is the concentration gradient,
* (for ideal mixtures) is the concentration, with a dimension of amount of substance per unit volume,
* is position, the dimension of which is length.

 is proportional to the squared velocity of the diffusing particles, which depends on the temperature, viscosity of the fluid and the size of the particles according to the Stokes–Einstein relation. In dilute aqueous solutions the diffusion coefficients of most ions are similar and have values that at room temperature are in the range of . For biological molecules the diffusion coefficients normally range from 10−10 to 10−11 m2/s.

In two or more dimensions we must use , the del or gradient operator, which generalises the first derivative, obtaining
: formula_3
where denotes the diffusion flux.

The driving force for the one-dimensional diffusion is the quantity , which for ideal mixtures is the concentration gradient.

=== Variations of the first law ===

Another form for the first law is to write it with the primary variable as mass fraction (, given for example in kg/kg), then the equation changes to
: formula_4
where
* the index denotes the th species,
* is the diffusion flux of the th species (for example in mol/m2/s),
* is the molar mass of the th species,
* is the mixture density (for example in kg/m3).

The formula_5 is outside the gradient operator. This is because
: formula_6
where is the partial density of the th species.

Beyond this, in chemical systems other than ideal solutions or mixtures, the driving force for the diffusion of each species is the gradient of chemical potential of this species. Then Fick&#x27;s first law (one-dimensional case) can be written
: formula_7
where
* the index denotes the th species,
* is the concentration (mol/m3),
* is the universal gas constant (J/K/mol),
* is the absolute temperature (K),
* is the chemical potential (J/mol).

The driving force of Fick&#x27;s law can be expressed as a fugacity difference:
: formula_8

where formula_9 is the fugacity in Pa. formula_9 is a partial pressure of component in a vapor formula_11 or liquid formula_12 phase. At vapor liquid equilibrium the evaporation flux is zero because formula_13.

=== Derivation of Fick&#x27;s first law for gases ===

Four versions of Fick&#x27;s law for binary gas mixtures are given below. These assume: thermal diffusion is negligible; the body force per unit mass is the same on both species; and either pressure is constant or both species have the same molar mass. Under these conditions, Ref. shows in detail how the diffusion equation from the kinetic theory of gases reduces to this version of Fick&#x27;s law:
formula_14
where is the diffusion velocity of species . In terms of species flux this is
formula_15

If, additionally, formula_16, this reduces to the most common form of Fick&#x27;s law,
formula_17

If (instead of or in addition to formula_16) both species have the same molar mass, Fick&#x27;s law becomes
formula_19
where formula_20 is the mole fraction of species .

== Fick&#x27;s second law ==
Fick&#x27;s second law predicts how diffusion causes the concentration to change with respect to time. It is a partial differential equation which in one dimension reads
: formula_21
where
* is the concentration in dimensions of formula_22, example mol/m3; is a function that depends on location and time ,
* is time, example s,
* is the diffusion coefficient in dimensions of formula_23, example m2/s,
* is the position, example m.

In two or more dimensions we must use the Laplacian , which generalises the second derivative, obtaining the equation
: formula_24

Fick&#x27;s second law has the same mathematical form as the Heat equation and its fundamental solution is the same as the Heat kernel, except switching thermal conductivity formula_25 with diffusion coefficient formula_26:
formula_27

=== Derivation of Fick&#x27;s second law ===

Fick&#x27;s second law can be derived from Fick&#x27;s first law and the mass conservation in absence of any chemical reactions:
: formula_28

Assuming the diffusion coefficient to be a constant, one can exchange the orders of the differentiation and multiply by the constant:
:formula_29
and, thus, receive the form of the Fick&#x27;s equations as was stated above.

For the case of diffusion in two or more dimensions Fick&#x27;s second law becomes
: formula_30
which is analogous to the heat equation.

If the diffusion coefficient is not a constant, but depends upon the coordinate or concentration, Fick&#x27;s second law yields
: formula_31

An important example is the case where is at a steady state, i.e. the concentration does not change by time, so that the left part of the above equation is identically zero. In one dimension with constant , the solution for the concentration will be a linear change of concentrations along . In two or more dimensions we obtain
: formula_32
which is Laplace&#x27;s equation, the solutions to which are referred to by mathematicians as harmonic functions.

== Example solutions and generalization ==
Fick&#x27;s second law is a special case of the convection–diffusion equation in which there is no advective flux and no net volumetric source. It can be derived from the continuity equation:
: formula_33
where is the total flux and is a net volumetric source for . The only source of flux in this situation is assumed to be &quot;diffusive flux&quot;:
: formula_34

Plugging the definition of diffusive flux to the continuity equation and assuming there is no source (), we arrive at Fick&#x27;s second law:
: formula_35

If flux were the result of both diffusive flux and advective flux, the convection–diffusion equation is the result.

=== Example solution 1: constant concentration source and diffusion length ===
A simple case of diffusion with time in one dimension (taken as the -axis) from a boundary located at position , where the concentration is maintained at a value is
: formula_36
where is the complementary error function. This is the case when corrosive gases diffuse through the oxidative layer towards the metal surface (if we assume that concentration of gases in the environment is constant and the diffusion space – that is, the corrosion product layer – is &quot;semi-infinite&quot;, starting at 0 at the surface and spreading infinitely deep in the material). If, in its turn, the diffusion space is &quot;infinite&quot; (lasting both through the layer with , and that with , ), then the solution is amended only with coefficient in front of (as the diffusion now occurs in both directions). This case is valid when some solution with concentration is put in contact with a layer of pure solvent. (Bokstein, 2005) The length is called the &quot;diffusion length&quot; and provides a measure of how far the concentration has propagated in the -direction by diffusion in time (Bird, 1976).

As a quick approximation of the error function, the first two terms of the Taylor series can be used:
: formula_37

If is time-dependent, the diffusion length becomes
: formula_38
This idea is useful for estimating a diffusion length over a heating and cooling cycle, where varies with temperature.

=== Example solution 2: Brownian particle and mean squared displacement ===
Another simple case of diffusion is the Brownian motion of one particle. The particle&#x27;s Mean squared displacement from its original position is:
formula_39
where formula_40 is the dimension of the particle&#x27;s Brownian motion. For example, the diffusion of a molecule across a cell membrane 8 nm thick is 1-D diffusion because of the spherical symmetry; However, the diffusion of a molecule from the membrane to the center of a eukaryotic cell is a 3-D diffusion. For a cylindrical cactus, the diffusion from photosynthetic cells on its surface to its center (the axis of its cylindrical symmetry) is a 2-D diffusion.

The square root of MSD, formula_41, is often used as a characterization of how far the particle has moved after time formula_42 has elapsed. The MSD is symmetrically distributed over the 1D, 2D, and 3D space. Thus, the probability distribution of the magnitude of MSD in 1D is Gaussian and 3D is a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution.

=== Generalizations ===
* In &quot;non-homogeneous media&quot;, the diffusion coefficient varies in space, . This dependence does not affect Fick&#x27;s first law but the second law changes: formula_43
* In &quot;anisotropic media&quot;, the diffusion coefficient depends on the direction. It is a symmetric tensor . Fick&#x27;s first law changes to formula_44 it is the product of a tensor and a vector: formula_45 For the diffusion equation this formula gives formula_46 The symmetric matrix of diffusion coefficients should be positive definite. It is needed to make the right-hand side operator elliptic.
* For &quot;inhomogeneous anisotropic media&quot; these two forms of the diffusion equation should be combined in formula_47
* The approach based on Einstein&#x27;s mobility and Teorell formula gives the following generalization of Fick&#x27;s equation for the &quot;multicomponent diffusion&quot; of the perfect components: formula_48 where are concentrations of the components and is the matrix of coefficients. Here, indices and are related to the various components and not to the space coordinates.

The Chapman–Enskog formulae for diffusion in gases include exactly the same terms. These physical models of diffusion are different from the test models which are valid for very small deviations from the uniform equilibrium. Earlier, such terms were introduced in the Maxwell–Stefan diffusion equation.

For anisotropic multicomponent diffusion coefficients one needs a rank-four tensor, for example , where refer to the components and correspond to the space coordinates.

== Applications ==
Equations based on Fick&#x27;s law have been commonly used to model transport processes in foods, neurons, biopolymers, pharmaceuticals, porous soils, population dynamics, nuclear materials, plasma physics, and semiconductor doping processes. The theory of voltammetric methods is based on solutions of Fick&#x27;s equation. On the other hand, in some cases a &quot;Fickian (another common approximation of the transport equation is that of the diffusion theory)&quot; description is inadequate. For example, in polymer science and food science a more general approach is required to describe transport of components in materials undergoing a glass transition. One more general framework is the Maxwell–Stefan diffusion equations
of multi-component mass transfer, from which Fick&#x27;s law can be obtained as a limiting case, when the mixture is extremely dilute and every chemical species is interacting only with the bulk mixture and not with other species. To account for the presence of multiple species in a non-dilute mixture, several variations of the Maxwell–Stefan equations are used. See also non-diagonal coupled transport processes (Onsager relationship). 

=== Fick&#x27;s flow in liquids ===
When two miscible liquids are brought into contact, and diffusion takes place, the macroscopic (or average) concentration evolves following Fick&#x27;s law. On a mesoscopic scale, that is, between the macroscopic scale described by Fick&#x27;s law and molecular scale, where molecular random walks take place, fluctuations cannot be neglected. Such situations can be successfully modeled with Landau-Lifshitz fluctuating hydrodynamics. In this theoretical framework, diffusion is due to fluctuations whose dimensions range from the molecular scale to the macroscopic scale.

In particular, fluctuating hydrodynamic equations include a Fick&#x27;s flow term, with a given diffusion coefficient, along with hydrodynamics equations and stochastic terms describing fluctuations. When calculating the fluctuations with a perturbative approach, the zero order approximation is Fick&#x27;s law. The first order gives the fluctuations, and it comes out that fluctuations contribute to diffusion. This represents somehow a tautology, since the phenomena described by a lower order approximation is the result of a higher approximation: this problem is solved only by renormalizing the fluctuating hydrodynamics equations.

=== Sorption rate and collision frequency of diluted solute ===
Adsorption, absorption, and collision of molecules, particles, and surfaces are important problems in many fields. These fundamental processes regulate chemical, biological, and environmental reactions. Their rate can be calculated using the diffusion constant and Fick&#x27;s laws of diffusion especially when these interactions happen in diluted solutions.

Typically, the diffusion constant of molecules and particles defined by Fick&#x27;s equation can be calculated using the Stokes–Einstein equation. In the ultrashort time limit, in the order of the diffusion time &quot;a&quot;2/&quot;D&quot;, where &quot;a&quot; is the particle radius, the diffusion is described by the Langevin equation. At a longer time, the Langevin equation merges into the Stokes–Einstein equation. The latter is appropriate for the condition of the diluted solution, where long-range diffusion is considered. According to the fluctuation-dissipation theorem based on the Langevin equation in the long-time limit and when the particle is significantly denser than the surrounding fluid, the time-dependent diffusion constant is:
: formula_49
where (all in SI units)
* &quot;k&quot;B is the Boltzmann constant,
* &quot;T&quot; is the absolute temperature,
* &quot;μ&quot; is the mobility of the particle in the fluid or gas, which can be calculated using the Einstein relation (kinetic theory),
* &quot;m&quot; is the mass of the particle,
* &quot;t&quot; is time.
For a single molecule such as organic molecules or biomolecules (e.g. proteins) in water, the exponential term is negligible due to the small product of &quot;mμ&quot; in the ultrafast picosecond region, thus irrelevant to the relatively slower adsorption of diluted solute.

The adsorption or absorption rate of a dilute solute to a surface or interface in a (gas or liquid) solution can be calculated using Fick&#x27;s laws of diffusion. The accumulated number of molecules adsorbed on the surface is expressed by the Langmuir-Schaefer equation by integrating the diffusion flux equation over time as shown in the simulated molecular diffusion in the first section of this page:
: formula_50
* is the surface area (m2).
* formula_51 is the number concentration of the adsorber molecules (solute) in the bulk solution (#/m3).
* is diffusion coefficient of the adsorber (m2/s).
* is elapsed time (s).
* formula_52 is the accumulated number of molecules in unit # molecules adsorbed during the time formula_42.
The equation is named after American chemists Irving Langmuir and Vincent Schaefer.

Briefly as explained in,
the concentration gradient profile near a newly created (from formula_54) absorptive surface (placed at formula_55) in a once uniform bulk solution is solved in the above sections from Fick&#x27;s equation,
:formula_56
where is the number concentration of adsorber molecules at formula_57 (#/m3).

The concentration gradient at the subsurface at formula_58 is simplified to the pre-exponential factor of the distribution
:formula_59
And the rate of diffusion (flux) across area formula_60 of the plane is
:formula_61
Integrating over time,
: formula_62

The Langmuir–Schaefer equation can be extended to the Ward–Tordai Equation to account for the &quot;back-diffusion&quot; of rejected molecules from the surface: 
: formula_63 
where formula_51 is the bulk concentration, formula_65 is the sub-surface concentration (which is a function of time depending on the reaction model of the adsorption), and formula_66 is a dummy variable.

Monte Carlo simulations show that these two equations work to predict the adsorption rate of systems that form predictable concentration gradients near the surface but have troubles for systems without or with unpredictable concentration gradients, such as typical biosensing systems or when flow and convection are significant.

A brief history of diffusive adsorption is shown in the right figure. A noticeable challenge of understanding the diffusive adsorption at the single-molecule level is the fractal nature of diffusion. Most computer simulations pick a time step for diffusion which ignores the fact that there are self-similar finer diffusion events (fractal) within each step. Simulating the fractal diffusion shows that a factor of two corrections should be introduced for the result of a fixed time-step adsorption simulation, bringing it to be consistent with the above two equations.

A more problematic result of the above equations is they predict the lower limit of adsorption under ideal situations but is very difficult to predict the actual adsorption rates. The equations are derived at the long-time-limit condition when a stable concentration gradient has been formed near the surface. But real adsorption is often done much faster than this infinite time limit i.e. the concentration gradient, decay of concentration at the sub-surface, is only partially formed before the surface has been saturated or flow is on to maintain a certain gradient, thus the adsorption rate measured is almost always faster than the equations have predicted for low or none energy barrier adsorption (unless there is a significant adsorption energy barrier that slows down the absorption significantly), for example, thousands to millions time faster in the self-assembly of monolayers at the water-air or water-substrate interfaces. As such, it is necessary to calculate the evolution of the concentration gradient near the surface and find out a proper time to stop the imagined infinite evolution for practical applications. While it is hard to predict when to stop but it is reasonably easy to calculate the shortest time that matters, the critical time when the first nearest neighbor from the substrate surface feels the building-up of the concentration gradient. This yields the upper limit of the adsorption rate under an ideal situation when there are no other factors than diffusion that affect the absorber dynamics:
: formula_67
where:
* formula_68 is the adsorption rate assuming under adsorption energy barrier-free situation, in unit #/s,
* formula_69 is the area of the surface of interest on an &quot;infinite and flat&quot; substrate (m2),
* formula_70 is the concentration of the absorber molecule in the bulk solution (#/m3),
* formula_71 is the diffusion constant of the absorber (solute) in the solution (m2/s) defined with Fick&#x27;s law.

This equation can be used to predict the initial adsorption rate of any system; It can be used to predict the steady-state adsorption rate of a typical biosensing system when the binding site is just a very small fraction of the substrate surface and a near-surface concentration gradient is never formed; It can also be used to predict the adsorption rate of molecules on the surface when there is a significant flow to push the concentration gradient very shallowly in the sub-surface.

This critical time is significantly different from the first passenger arriving time or the mean free-path time. Using the average first-passenger time and Fick&#x27;s law of diffusion to estimate the average binding rate will significantly over-estimate the concentration gradient because the first passenger usually comes from many layers of neighbors away from the target, thus its arriving time is significantly longer than the nearest neighbor diffusion time. Using the mean free path time plus the Langmuir equation will cause an artificial concentration gradient between the initial location of the first passenger and the target surface because the other neighbor layers have no change yet, thus significantly lower estimate the actual binding time, i.e., the actual first passenger arriving time itself, the inverse of the above rate, is difficult to calculate. If the system can be simplified to 1D diffusion, then the average first passenger time can be calculated using the same nearest neighbor critical diffusion time for the first neighbor distance to be the MSD, 
:formula_72 
where:
*formula_73 (unit m) is the average nearest neighbor distance approximated as cubic packing, where formula_51 is the solute concentration in the bulk solution (unit # molecule / m3),
*formula_26 is the diffusion coefficient defined by Fick&#x27;s equation (unit m2/s),
*formula_42 is the critical time (unit s).
In this critical time, it is unlikely the first passenger has arrived and adsorbed. But it sets the speed of the layers of neighbors to arrive. At this speed with a concentration gradient that stops around the first neighbor layer, the gradient does not project virtually in the longer time when the actual first passenger arrives. Thus, the average first passenger coming rate (unit # molecule/s) for this 3D diffusion simplified in 1D problem, 
:formula_77
where formula_78 is a factor of converting the 3D diffusive adsorption problem into a 1D diffusion problem whose value depends on the system, e.g., a fraction of adsorption area formula_79 over solute nearest neighbor sphere surface area formula_80 assuming cubic packing each unit has 8 neighbors shared with other units. This example fraction converges the result to the 3D diffusive adsorption solution shown above with a slight difference in pre-factor due to different packing assumptions and ignoring other neighbors.

When the area of interest is the size of a molecule (specifically, a &quot;long cylindrical molecule&quot; such as DNA), the adsorption rate equation represents the collision frequency of two molecules in a diluted solution, with one molecule a specific side and the other no steric dependence, i.e., a molecule (random orientation) hit one side of the other. The diffusion constant need to be updated to the relative diffusion constant between two diffusing molecules. This estimation is especially useful in studying the interaction between a small molecule and a larger molecule such as a protein. The effective diffusion constant is dominated by the smaller one whose diffusion constant can be used instead.

The above hitting rate equation is also useful to predict the kinetics of molecular self-assembly on a surface. Molecules are randomly oriented in the bulk solution. Assuming 1/6 of the molecules has the right orientation to the surface binding sites, i.e. 1/2 of the z-direction in x, y, z three dimensions, thus the concentration of interest is just 1/6 of the bulk concentration. Put this value into the equation one should be able to calculate the theoretical adsorption kinetic curve using the Langmuir adsorption model. In a more rigid picture, 1/6 can be replaced by the steric factor of the binding geometry.

The bimolecular collision frequency related to many reactions including protein coagulation/aggregation is initially described by Smoluchowski coagulation equation proposed by Marian Smoluchowski in a seminal 1916 publication, derived from Brownian motion and Fick&#x27;s laws of diffusion. Under an idealized reaction condition for A + B → product in a diluted solution, Smoluchovski suggested that the molecular flux at the infinite time limit can be calculated from Fick&#x27;s laws of diffusion yielding a fixed/stable concentration gradient from the target molecule, e.g. B is the target molecule holding fixed relatively, and A is the moving molecule that creates a concentration gradient near the target molecule B due to the coagulation reaction between A and B. Smoluchowski calculated the collision frequency between A and B in the solution with unit #/s/m3:
: formula_81
where:
* formula_82 is the radius of the collision,
* formula_83 is the relative diffusion constant between A and B (m2/s),
* formula_84 and formula_85 are number concentrations of A and B respectively (#/m3).

The reaction order of this bimolecular reaction is 2 which is the analogy to the result from collision theory by replacing the moving speed of the molecule with diffusive flux. In the collision theory, the traveling time between A and B is proportional to the distance which is a similar relationship for the diffusion case if the flux is fixed.

However, under a practical condition, the concentration gradient near the target molecule is evolving over time with the molecular flux evolving as well, and on average the flux is much bigger than the infinite time limit flux Smoluchowski has proposed. Before the first passenger arrival time, Fick&#x27;s equation predicts a concentration gradient over time which does not build up yet in reality. Thus, this Smoluchowski frequency represents the lower limit of the real collision frequency.

In 2022, Chen calculates the upper limit of the collision frequency between A and B in a solution assuming the bulk concentration of the moving molecule is fixed after the first nearest neighbor of the target molecule. Thus the concentration gradient evolution stops at the first nearest neighbor layer given a stop-time to calculate the actual flux. He named this the critical time and derived the diffusive collision frequency in unit #/s/m3:
: formula_86
where:
* formula_87 is the area of the cross-section of the collision (m2),
* formula_83 is the relative diffusion constant between A and B (m2/s),
* formula_84 and formula_85 are number concentrations of A and B respectively (#/m3),
* formula_91 represents 1/&lt;d&gt;, where d is the average distance between two molecules.

This equation assumes the upper limit of a diffusive collision frequency between A and B is when the first neighbor layer starts to feel the evolution of the concentration gradient, whose reaction order is instead of 2. Both the Smoluchowski equation and the JChen equation satisfy dimensional checks with SI units. But the former is dependent on the radius and the latter is on the area of the collision sphere. From dimensional analysis, there will be an equation dependent on the volume of the collision sphere but eventually, all equations should converge to the same numerical rate of the collision that can be measured experimentally. The actual reaction order for a bimolecular unit reaction could be between 2 and , which makes sense because the diffusive collision time is squarely dependent on the distance between the two molecules.

These new equations also avoid the singularity on the adsorption rate at time zero for the Langmuir-Schaefer equation. The infinity rate is justifiable under ideal conditions because when you introduce target molecules magically in a solution of probe molecule or vice versa, there always be a probability of them overlapping at time zero, thus the rate of that two molecules association is infinity. It does not matter that other millions of molecules have to wait for their first mate to diffuse and arrive. The average rate is thus infinity. But statistically this argument is meaningless. The maximum rate of a molecule in a period of time larger than zero is 1, either meet or not, thus the infinite rate at time zero for that molecule pair really should just be one, making the average rate 1/millions or more and statistically negligible. This does not even count in reality no two molecules can magically meet at time zero.

=== Biological perspective ===
The first law gives rise to the following formula:
: formula_92
where
* is the permeability, an experimentally determined membrane &quot;conductance&quot; for a given gas at a given temperature,
* is the difference in concentration of the gas across the membrane for the direction of flow (from to ).

Fick&#x27;s first law is also important in radiation transfer equations. However, in this context, it becomes inaccurate when the diffusion constant is low and the radiation becomes limited by the speed of light rather than by the resistance of the material the radiation is flowing through. In this situation, one can use a flux limiter.

The exchange rate of a gas across a fluid membrane can be determined by using this law together with Graham&#x27;s law.

Under the condition of a diluted solution when diffusion takes control, the membrane permeability mentioned in the above section can be theoretically calculated for the solute using the equation mentioned in the last section (use with particular care because the equation is derived for dense solutes, while biological molecules are not denser than water. Also, this equation assumes ideal concentration gradient forms near the membrane and evolves):
: formula_93
where:
* formula_94 is the total area of the pores on the membrane (unit m2),
* formula_95 transmembrane efficiency (unitless), which can be calculated from the stochastic theory of chromatography,
* &quot;D&quot; is the diffusion constant of the solute unit m2⋅s−1,
* &quot;t&quot; is time unit s,
* &quot;c&quot;2, &quot;c&quot;1 concentration should use unit mol m−3, so flux unit becomes mol s−1.

The flux is decay over the square root of time because a concentration gradient builds up near the membrane over time under ideal conditions. When there is flow and convection, the flux can be significantly different than the equation predicts and show an effective time t with a fixed value, which makes the flux stable instead of decay over time. A critical time has been estimated under idealized flow conditions when there is no gradient formed. This strategy is adopted in biology such as blood circulation.

=== Semiconductor fabrication applications ===
The semiconductor is a collective term for a series of devices. It mainly includes three categories：two-terminal devices, three-terminal devices, and four-terminal devices. The combination of the semiconductors is called an integrated circuit.

The relationship between Fick&#x27;s law and semiconductors: the principle of the semiconductor is transferring chemicals or dopants from a layer to a layer. Fick&#x27;s law can be used to control and predict the diffusion by knowing how much the concentration of the dopants or chemicals move per meter and second through mathematics.

Therefore, different types and levels of semiconductors can be fabricated.

Integrated circuit fabrication technologies, model processes like CVD, thermal oxidation, wet oxidation, doping, etc. use diffusion equations obtained from Fick&#x27;s law.

==== CVD method of fabricate semiconductor ====
The wafer is a kind of semiconductor whose silicon substrate is coated with a layer of CVD-created polymer chain and films. This film contains n-type and p-type dopants and takes responsibility for dopant conductions. The principle of CVD relies on the gas phase and gas-solid chemical reaction to create thin films.

The viscous flow regime of CVD is driven by a pressure gradient. CVD also includes a diffusion component distinct from the surface diffusion of adatoms. In CVD, reactants and products must also diffuse through a boundary layer of stagnant gas that exists next to the substrate. The total number of steps required for CVD film growth are gas phase diffusion of reactants through the boundary layer, adsorption and surface diffusion of adatoms, reactions on the substrate, and gas phase diffusion of products away through the boundary layer.

The velocity profile for gas flow is:
formula_96
where:
* formula_97 is the thickness,
* formula_98 is the Reynolds number,
* is the length of the substrate,
* at any surface,
* formula_99 is viscosity,
* formula_5 is density.

Integrated the from to , it gives the average thickness:
formula_101

To keep the reaction balanced, reactants must diffuse through the stagnant boundary layer to reach the substrate. So a thin boundary layer is desirable. According to the equations, increasing vo would result in more wasted reactants. The reactants will not reach the substrate uniformly if the flow becomes turbulent. Another option is to switch to a new carrier gas with lower viscosity or density.

The Fick&#x27;s first law describes diffusion through the boundary layer. As a function of pressure (&quot;p&quot;) and temperature (&quot;T&quot;) in a gas, diffusion is determined.

formula_102
where:
* formula_103 is the standard pressure,
* formula_104 is the standard temperature,
* formula_105 is the standard diffusitivity.

The equation tells that increasing the temperature or decreasing the pressure can increase the diffusivity.

Fick&#x27;s first law predicts the flux of the reactants to the substrate and product away from the substrate:
formula_106
where:
* formula_107 is the thickness formula_97,
* formula_109 is the first reactant&#x27;s concentration.

In ideal gas law formula_110, the concentration of the gas is expressed by partial pressure.

formula_111
where
* formula_82 is the gas constant,
* formula_113 is the partial pressure gradient.

As a result, Fick&#x27;s first law tells us we can use a partial pressure gradient to control the diffusivity and control the growth of thin films of semiconductors.

In many realistic situations, the simple Fick&#x27;s law is not an adequate formulation for the semiconductor problem. It only applies to certain conditions, for example, given the semiconductor boundary conditions: constant source concentration diffusion, limited source concentration, or moving boundary diffusion (where junction depth keeps moving into the substrate).

==== Invalidity of Fickian diffusion ====
Even though Fickian diffusion has been used to model diffusion processes in semiconductor manufacturing (including CVD reactors) in early days, it often fails to validate the diffusion in advanced semiconductor nodes (&lt; 90 nm). This mostly stems from the inability of Fickian diffusion to model diffusion processes accurately at molecular level and smaller. In advanced semiconductor manufacturing, it is important to understand the movement at atomic scales, which is failed by continuum diffusion. Today, most semiconductor manufacturers use random walk to study and model diffusion processes. This allows us to study the effects of diffusion in a discrete manner to understand the movement of individual atoms, molecules, plasma etc.

In such a process, the movements of diffusing species (atoms, molecules, plasma etc.) are treated as a discrete entity, following a random walk through the CVD reactor, boundary layer, material structures etc. Sometimes, the movements might follow a biased-random walk depending on the processing conditions. Statistical analysis is done to understand variation/stochasticity arising from the random walk of the species, which in-turn affects the overall process and electrical variations.

=== Food production and cooking ===
The formulation of Fick&#x27;s first law can explain a variety of complex phenomena in the context of food and cooking: Diffusion of molecules such as ethylene promotes plant growth and ripening, salt and sugar molecules promotes meat brining and marinating, and water molecules promote dehydration. Fick&#x27;s first law can also be used to predict the changing moisture profiles across a spaghetti noodle as it hydrates during cooking. These phenomena are all about the spontaneous movement of particles of solutes driven by the concentration gradient. In different situations, there is different diffusivity which is a constant.

By controlling the concentration gradient, the cooking time, shape of the food, and salting can be controlled.

<doc id="11672" wikidata="Q42225" url="?curid=11672" title="Far East">
<text>The Far East is the geographical region that encompasses the easternmost portion of the Asian continent, including East, North, and Southeast Asia. South Asia is sometimes also included in the definition of the term. In modern times, the term &quot;Far East&quot; has widely fallen out of use and been substituted by Asia–Pacific, while the terms Middle East and Near East, although now pertaining to different territories, are still commonly used today.

The term first came into use in European geopolitical discourse in the 15th century, particularly the British, denoting the Far East as the &quot;farthest&quot; of the three &quot;Easts&quot;, beyond the Near East and the Middle East. Likewise, during the Qing dynasty of the 19th and early 20th centuries, the term &quot;Tàixī ()&quot; – i.e., anything further west than the Arab world – was used to refer to the Western countries.

Since the mid-20th century, the term has mostly gone out of use for the region in international mass media outlets due to its perceived Eurocentric connotations. North Asia is sometimes excluded due to cultural and ethnic differences.

The term is still used in Russia to refer to its sparsely populated easternmost regions (being &quot;far&quot; in this case from the political, economic and cultural centres, Moscow and Saint Petersburg).

==Popularization==
Among Western Europeans, prior to the colonial era, &quot;Far East&quot; referred to anything further east than the Middle East. In the 16th century, King John III of Portugal called India a &quot;rich and interesting country in the Far East ().&quot; The term was popularized during the period of the British Empire as a blanket term for lands to the east of British India.

In pre-World War I European geopolitics, &quot;Near East&quot; referred to the relatively nearby lands of the Ottoman Empire, &quot;Middle East&quot; denoted north-western Southern Asian region and Central Asia, and the &quot;Far East&quot; meant countries along the western Pacific Ocean and eastern Indian Ocean. Many European languages have analogous terms, such as the French (&#x27;), Spanish (&#x27;), Portuguese (&#x27;), Italian (&#x27;), German (&#x27;), Polish (&#x27;), Norwegian (&#x27;) and Dutch (&#x27;).

==Cultural and geographic meaning==
Significantly, the term evokes cultural as well as geographic separation; the &quot;Far East&quot; is not just geographically distant, but also culturally exotic. It never refers, for instance, to the culturally Western nations of Australia and New Zealand, which lie even farther to the east of Europe than East Asia itself. This combination of cultural and geographic subjectivity was well illustrated in 1939 by Robert Menzies, a Prime Minister of Australia. Reflecting on his country&#x27;s geopolitical situation with the onset of war, Menzies commented that: &quot;The problems of the Pacific are different. What Great Britain calls the Far East is to us the near north.&quot;

&quot;Far East&quot;, in its usual sense, is comparable to terms such as the &quot;Orient&quot; (Latin for &quot;East&quot;), &quot;Eastern world&quot;, or simply &quot;the East&quot;, all of which may refer, broadly, to East and South-East Asia in general. Occasionally, albeit more in the past, the Russian Far East and South Asia have been deemed to be part of the Far East.

Commenting on such terms, John K. Fairbank and Edwin O. Reischauer (both professors of East Asian Studies at Harvard University) wrote, in &quot;East Asia: The Great Tradition&quot;:
Today, the term remains in the names of some longstanding institutions, including the Far Eastern Federal University in Vladivostok, Far Eastern University in Manila, the Far East University in South Korea, and &quot;Far East&quot;, the periodical magazine of the Missionary Society of St. Columban. Furthermore, the United States and United Kingdom have historically incorporated &quot;Far East&quot; in the names of several military units and commands in the region, such as the British Royal Navy&#x27;s Far East Fleet, for instance.

<doc id="11673" wikidata="Q212731" url="?curid=11673" title="Fawlty Towers">
<text>Fawlty Towers is a British television sitcom written by John Cleese and Connie Booth, originally broadcast on BBC Two in 1975 and 1979. Two series of six episodes each were made. The series is set in Fawlty Towers, a dysfunctional fictional hotel in the English seaside town of Torquay in Devon. The plots centre on the tense, rude and put-upon owner Basil Fawlty (Cleese), his bossy wife Sybil (Prunella Scales), the sensible chambermaid Polly (Booth), and the hapless and English-challenged Spanish waiter Manuel (Andrew Sachs). They show their attempts to run the hotel amidst farcical situations and an array of demanding and eccentric guests and tradespeople.

The idea of &quot;Fawlty Towers&quot; came from Cleese after he stayed at the Gleneagles Hotel in Torquay, Devon, in 1970 (along with the rest of the Monty Python troupe), where he encountered the eccentric hotel owner Donald Sinclair. Stuffy and snobbish, Sinclair treated guests as though they were a hindrance to his running of the hotel (a waitress who worked for him stated &quot;it was as if he didn&#x27;t want the guests to be there&quot;). Sinclair was the inspiration for Cleese&#x27;s character Basil Fawlty.

While some critics derided &quot;Fawlty Towers&quot; upon release, the series soon received acclaim. In 1976 and 1980, it won the British Academy Television Award for Best Scripted Comedy. In 1980, Cleese received the British Academy Television Award for Best Entertainment Performance. The popularity of &quot;Fawlty Towers&quot; has endured, and it is often re-broadcast. The show was ranked first on a list of the 100 Greatest British Television Programmes drawn up by the British Film Institute in 2000, and in a 2001 poll conducted by Channel 4, Basil Fawlty was ranked second on their list of the 100 Greatest TV Characters. In 2019, it was named the greatest ever British TV sitcom by a panel of comedy experts compiled by the &quot;Radio Times&quot;. The BBC profile for the series states that &quot;the British sitcom by which all other British sitcoms must be judged, &quot;Fawlty Towers&quot; withstands multiple viewings, is eminently quotable (&#x27;don&#x27;t mention the war&#x27;) and stands up to this day as a jewel in the BBC&#x27;s comedy crown.&quot; In 2023, Cleese suggested that a sequel series was being developed.

==Origins==
In May 1970, the Monty Python comedy group stayed at the now-demolished Gleneagles Hotel in Torquay, Devon while filming on location in Paignton. John Cleese was fascinated with the behaviour of the owner, Donald Sinclair, later describing him as &quot;the rudest man I&#x27;ve ever come across in my life&quot;. Among such behaviour by Sinclair was his criticism of Terry Gilliam&#x27;s &quot;too American&quot; table etiquette and tossing Eric Idle&#x27;s briefcase out of a window &quot;in case it contained a bomb&quot;. Asked why anyone would want to bomb the hotel, Sinclair replied, &quot;We&#x27;ve had a lot of staff problems&quot;. Michael Palin states Sinclair &quot;seemed to view us as a colossal inconvenience&quot;. Rosemary Harrison, a waitress at the Gleneagles under Sinclair, described him as &quot;bonkers&quot; and lacking in hospitality, deeming him wholly unsuitable for a hotel proprietor. &quot;It was as if he didn&#x27;t want the guests to be there.&quot; Cleese and his then-wife Connie Booth stayed on at the hotel after filming, furthering their research of its owner. Demolished in 2015, the building was replaced by a new retirement home named Sachs Lodge in memory of Andrew Sachs who played Manuel in the sitcom and who died in 2016.

Cleese was a writer on the 1970s British TV sitcom &quot;Doctor in the House&quot; for London Weekend Television. An early prototype of the character that became known as Basil Fawlty was developed in an episode (&quot;No Ill Feeling&quot;) of the third &quot;Doctor&quot; series (titled &quot;Doctor at Large&quot;). In this edition, the main character checks into a small-town hotel, his very presence seemingly winding up the aggressive and incompetent manager (played by Timothy Bateson) with a domineering wife. The show was broadcast on 30 May 1971.

Cleese said in 2008 that the first &quot;Fawlty Towers&quot; script he and Booth wrote was rejected by the BBC. At a 30th anniversary event honouring the show, Cleese said,
Cleese was paid £6,000 for 43 weeks of work and supplemented his income by appearing in television advertisements. He states, &quot;I have to thank the advertising industry for making this possible. Connie and I used to spend six weeks writing each episode and we didn&#x27;t make a lot of money out of it. If it hadn&#x27;t been for the commercials I wouldn&#x27;t have been able to afford to spend so much time on the script.&quot;

==Production==
Although the series is set in Torquay, no part of it was shot in South West England. For the exterior filming, the Wooburn Grange Country Club in Wooburn Green, Buckinghamshire was used instead of a hotel. In several episodes of the series (notably &quot;The Kipper and the Corpse&quot;, &quot;The Anniversary&quot;, and &quot;Basil the Rat&quot;), the entrance gate at the bottom of the drive states the real name of the location. This listed building later served for a short time as a nightclub named &quot;Basil&#x27;s&quot; after the series ended, before being destroyed by a fire in March 1991. The remnants of the building were demolished and a housing estate was built on the site. Few traces of the original site exist today.

Other location filming was done mostly around Harrow: firstly the &#x27;damn good thrashing&#x27; scene in &quot;Gourmet Night&quot; in which Basil loses his temper and attacks his broken-down car with a tree branch. It was filmed at the T-junction of Lapstone Gardens and Mentmore Close (). Secondly the episode &quot;The Germans&quot;, the opening shot is of Northwick Park Hospital. Thirdly &quot;Gourmet Night&quot;&#x27;s exterior of André&#x27;s restaurant was at Preston Road (). It is now a Chinese and Indian restaurant called Wings, next to a launderette.
Both Cleese and Booth were keen on every script being perfect, and some episodes took four months and required as many as ten drafts until they were satisfied.

Cleese said one of the reasons the series worked so well was the quality of the scripts and the care taken over the editing. He told a TV interviewer that while the average BBC half-hour comedy script had 65 pages, the ones for Fawlty Towers had between 135 and 140 pages. &quot;We literally did twice as many camera average shows got 200, we used to have 400. So there was an enormous amount in there. The other thing is that they were very well constructed,&quot; he said. Once an episode was in the can, the editing process started. &quot;We did anything between 20 and 25 hours editing each show. Almost every minute you see up on the screen, we spent one hour editing and it was only by doing that you could just tighten it up, just tighten it there and take out a line of dialogue, sometimes take out a repetition, they&#x27;ll then lose two lines of dialogue there. That&#x27;s what really got the pace on it.&quot;

The theme music was composed by Dennis Wilson. It was recorded by the highly respected Aeolian Quartet, who were asked by director John Davis to perform the piece badly, although in the end they did not.

==Plot directions and examples==
The series focuses on the exploits and misadventures of short-fused hotelier Basil Fawlty and his acerbic wife Sybil, as well as their employees: waiter Manuel, Polly Sherman, and, in the second series, chef Terry. The episodes typically revolve around Basil&#x27;s efforts to &quot;raise the tone&quot; of his hotel and his increasing frustration at numerous complications and mistakes, both his own and those of others, which prevent him from doing so.

Much of the humour comes from Basil&#x27;s overly aggressive manner, engaging in angry but witty arguments with guests, staff and, in particular, Sybil, whom he addresses (in a faux-romantic way) with insults such as &quot;that golfing puff adder&quot;, &quot;my little piranha fish&quot; and &quot;my little nest of vipers&quot;. Despite this, Basil frequently feels intimidated, Sybil being able to cow him at any time, usually with a short, sharp cry of &quot;Basil!&quot; At the end of some episodes, Basil succeeds in annoying (or at least bemusing) the guests and frequently gets his comeuppance.

The plots occasionally are intricate and always farcical, involving coincidences, misunderstandings, cross-purposes and meetings both missed and accidental. The innuendo of the bedroom farce is sometimes present (often to the disgust of the socially conservative Basil) but it is his eccentricity, not his lust, that drives the plots. The events test to the breaking point what little patience Basil has, sometimes causing him to have a near breakdown by the end of the episode.

The guests at the hotel typically are comic foils to Basil&#x27;s anger and outbursts. Guest characters in each episode provide different characteristics (working class, promiscuous, foreign) that he cannot stand. Requests both reasonable and impossible test his temper. Even the afflicted annoy him, for example in the episode &quot;Communication Problems&quot;, revolving around the havoc caused by the frequent misunderstandings between the staff and the hard-of-hearing Mrs. Richards. Near the end, Basil pretends to faint just at the mention of her name. This episode is typical of the show&#x27;s careful weaving of humorous situations through comedy cross-talk. The show also uses mild black humour at times, notably when Basil is forced to hide a dead body (&quot;2 dead, 25 to go.&quot;) and in his comments about Sybil (&quot;Did you ever see that film, &quot;How to Murder Your Wife&quot;? ... Awfully good. I saw it six times.&quot;) and to Mrs. Richards (&quot;May I suggest that you consider moving to a hotel closer to the sea? Or preferably in it.&quot;).

Basil&#x27;s physical outbursts are primarily directed at Manuel, an emotional but largely innocent Spaniard whose confused English vocabulary causes him to make elementary mistakes. At times, Basil beats Manuel with a frying pan and smacks his forehead with a spoon. The violence towards Manuel caused rare negative criticism of the show. Sybil and Polly, on the other hand, are more patient and understanding towards Manuel; everyone&#x27;s usual excuse to guests for his behaviour is, &quot;He&#x27;s from Barcelona&quot;; Manuel even once used the excuse for himself.

Basil longs for a touch of class, sometimes playing recordings of classical music. In the first episode he is playing music by Brahms when Sybil remarks, after pestering him asking to do different tasks: &quot;You could have them both done by now if you hadn&#x27;t spent the whole morning skulking in there listening to that racket.&quot; Basil replies, with exasperation, &quot;Racket?? That&#x27;s Brahms! Brahms&#x27; Third Racket!&quot; Basil often displays blatant snobbishness as he attempts to climb the social ladder, frequently expressing disdain for the &quot;riff-raff&quot;, &quot;&quot; and &quot;yobbos&quot; that he believes regularly populate his hotel. His desperation is readily apparent as he makes increasingly hopeless manoeuvres and painful faux pas in trying to with those he perceives as having superior social status. Yet he finds himself forced to serve those individuals that are &quot;beneath&quot; him. As such, Basil&#x27;s efforts tend to be counter-productive, with guests leaving the hotel in disgust and his marriage (and sanity) stretching to breaking point.

==Characters==

===Basil Fawlty===

Basil Fawlty, played by John Cleese, is a cynical and snobbish misanthrope who is desperate to belong to a higher social class. He sees a successful hotel as a means of achieving this, yet his job forces him to be polite to people he despises.

He is intimidated by his wife Sybil Fawlty. He yearns to stand up to her, but his plans frequently conflict with her demands. She is often verbally abusive (describing him as &quot;an ageing, brilliantined stick insect&quot;) but although he towers over her, he often finds himself on the receiving end of her temper, verbally and physically (as in &quot;The Builders&quot;), and it is only on one occasion when Sybil mistakenly believes he is stalking an attractive Australian guest that he finally snaps and stands up to her.

Basil usually turns to Manuel or Polly to help him with his schemes, while trying his best to keep Sybil from discovering them. However, Basil occasionally laments the time when there was passion in their relationship, now seemingly lost. Also, it appears he still does care for her and remains loyal to her, and actively resists the flirtations of a French guest in one episode. The penultimate episode, &quot;The Anniversary&quot;, is about his efforts to put together a surprise anniversary party involving their closest friends. Things go wrong as Basil pretends the anniversary date does not remind him of anything though he pretends to have a stab at it by reeling off a list of random anniversaries, starting with the Battle of Agincourt, for which he receives a slap from Sybil, who becomes increasingly frustrated and angry. He continues guessing even after Sybil is out of earshot, and mentions other anniversaries (none of which happened on 17 April), including the Battle of Trafalgar and Yom Kippur, just to enhance the surprise. Sybil believes he really has forgotten, and leaves in a huff. In an interview in the DVD boxed set, Cleese claims this episode deliberately takes a slightly different tone from the others, fleshing out their otherwise inexplicable status as a couple.

In keeping with the lack of explanation about the marriage, not much is revealed of the characters&#x27; back-stories. It is known that Basil served in the British Army and saw action in the Korean War, possibly as part of his National Service. Basil exaggerates this period of his life, proclaiming to strangers, &quot;I killed four men.&quot; To this Sybil jokes that &quot;He was in the Catering Corps. He used to poison them.&quot; Basil is often seen wearing regimental and old-boy style ties, perhaps spuriously, one of which is in the colours of the Army Catering Corps. He also claims to have sustained a shrapnel injury to his leg; it tends to flare up at suspiciously convenient times. The only person towards whom Basil consistently exhibits tolerance and good manners is the old and senile Major Gowen, a veteran of one of the world wars (which one is never specified, though he once mentions to Mrs Peignoir that he was in France in 1918) who permanently resides at the hotel. When interacting with Manuel, Basil displays a rudimentary knowledge of Spanish (Basil states that he &quot;learned classical Spanish, not the strange dialect he [Manuel] seems to have picked up&quot;); this knowledge is also ridiculed, as in the first episode in which a guest, whom Basil has immediately dismissed as working-class, communicates fluently with Manuel in Spanish after Basil is unable to do so.

Cleese described Basil as thinking that &quot;he could run a first-rate hotel if he didn&#x27;t have all the guests getting in the way&quot; and as being &quot;an absolutely awful human being&quot; but says that in comedy if an awful person makes people laugh they unaccountably feel affectionate towards him. Indeed, he is not entirely unsympathetic. The &quot;Hotel Inspectors&quot; and &quot;Gourmet Night&quot; episodes feature guests who are shown to be deeply annoying, with constant and unreasonable demands. In &quot;Gourmet Night&quot; the chef gets drunk and is unable to cook dinner, leaving Basil to scramble in an attempt to salvage the evening. Much of the time, Basil is an unfortunate victim of circumstance.

===Sybil Fawlty===

Sybil Fawlty, played by Prunella Scales, is Basil&#x27;s wife. Energetic and petite, she prefers a working wardrobe of tight skirt-suits in shiny fabrics and sports a tower of permed hair augmented with hairpieces and wigs necessitating the use of overnight curlers. She often is a more effective manager of the hotel, making sure Basil gets certain jobs done or stays out of the way when she is handling difficult guests. Typically when Basil is on the verge of a meltdown due to a crisis (usually of his own making), it is Sybil who steps in to clear up the mess and bring some sense to the situation. Despite this, she rarely participates directly in the running of the hotel. During busy check-in sessions or meal times, while everyone else is busy working, Sybil is frequently talking on the phone to one of her friends with her phrase &quot;Oohhh, I knoooooooow&quot; or chatting to customers. She has a distinctive conversational tone and braying laugh, which Basil compares to &quot;someone machine-gunning a seal&quot;. Being his wife, she is the only regular character who refers to Basil by his first name. When she barks his name at him, he flinchingly freezes in his tracks.

Basil refers to her by a number of epithets, occasionally to her face, including &quot;that golfing puff-adder&quot;, &quot;the dragon&quot;, &quot;toxic midget&quot;, &quot;the sabre-toothed tart&quot;, &quot;my little kommandant&quot;, &quot;my little piranha fish&quot;, &quot;my little nest of vipers&quot; and &quot;you rancorous, coiffured old sow&quot;. Despite these nasty nicknames, Basil is terrified of her. The 1979 episode &quot;The Psychiatrist&quot; contains the only time he loses patience and snaps at her (Basil: &quot;Shut up, I&#x27;m fed up.&quot; Sybil: &quot;Oh, you&#x27;ve done it now.&quot;).

Prunella Scales speculated in an interview for &quot;The Complete Fawlty Towers&quot; DVD boxed set that Sybil married Basil because his origins were of a higher social class than hers.

===Polly Sherman===

Polly Sherman, played by Connie Booth, is a waitress and general assistant at the hotel with artistic aspirations. She is the most competent of the staff and the voice of sanity during chaotic moments, but is frequently embroiled in ridiculous masquerades as she loyally attempts to aid Basil in trying to cover up a mistake or keep something from Sybil.

In &quot;The Anniversary&quot; she snaps and refuses to help Basil out when he wants her to impersonate Sybil in the semi-darkness of her bedroom in front of the Fawltys&#x27; friends, Basil having dug himself into a hole by claiming Sybil was ill instead of admitting she had stormed out earlier in annoyance with him. Polly finally agrees, but only on condition that Basil lends her money to purchase a car, which he has previously refused to do.

Polly generally is good-natured but sometimes shows her frustration, and has odd moments of malice. In &quot;The Kipper and the Corpse&quot;, the pampered Shih Tzu dog of an elderly guest bites Polly and Manuel. As revenge, Polly laces the dog&#x27;s sausages with black pepper and Tabasco sauce (&quot;bangers bang&quot;), making it ill and eventually killing it.

Despite her part-time employment (during meal times), Polly frequently is saddled with many other duties, including as manager in &quot;The Germans&quot; when Sybil and Basil are incapacitated. In the first series, Polly is said to be an art student who, according to Basil, has spent three years at college. In &quot;Gourmet Night&quot;, she is seen drawing a sketch (presumably of Manuel), which everyone but Basil immediately recognises and she sells it to the chef for 50p. Polly is not referred to as a student in the second series, although in both series she is shown to have a flair for languages, displaying ability in both Spanish and German. In &quot;The Germans&quot;, Basil alludes to Polly&#x27;s polyglot inclination by saying that she does her work &quot;while learning two Oriental languages&quot;. Like Manuel, she has a room of her own at the hotel.

===Manuel===

Manuel, a waiter played by Andrew Sachs, is a well-meaning but disorganised and confused Spaniard from Barcelona with a poor grasp of the English language and customs. He is verbally and physically abused by his boss. When told what to do, he often responds, &quot;¿Qué?&quot; (&quot;What?&quot;). Manuel&#x27;s character is used to demonstrate Basil&#x27;s instinctive lack of sensitivity and tolerance. Every episode involves Basil becoming enraged at Manuel&#x27;s confusion at his boss&#x27;s bizarre demands and even basic requests. Manuel is afraid of Fawlty&#x27;s quick temper and violent assaults, yet often expresses his appreciation for being given employment. He is relentlessly enthusiastic and is proud of what little English he knows.

During the series, Sachs was seriously injured twice. Cleese describes using a real metal pan to knock Manuel unconscious in &quot;The Wedding Party&quot;, although he would have preferred to use a rubber one. The original producer and director, John Howard Davies, said that he made Basil use a metal one and that he was responsible for most of the violence on the show, which he felt was essential to the type of comical farce they were creating. Later, when Sachs&#x27;s clothes were treated to give off smoke after he escaped the burning kitchen in &quot;The Germans&quot;, the corrosive chemicals ate through them and gave Sachs severe burns.

Manuel&#x27;s exaggerated Spanish accent is part of the humour of the show. In fact, Sachs&#x27;s original language was German; he emigrated to Britain as a child.

The character&#x27;s nationality was switched to Italian (and the name to Paolo) for the Spanish dub of the show, while in Catalonia and France, Manuel is a Mexican.

===Other regular characters and themes===
* Terry Hughes, played by Brian Hall, is the hotel chef throughout the second series. A sly, somewhat shifty Cockney, he is nonetheless a competent chef (&quot;I &#x27;ave been to catering school!&quot;). His cooking methods are occasionally somewhat casual, which frustrates and worries the neurotic Basil; and he also has limited concern for food and kitchen hygiene, claiming that &quot;What the eye don&#x27;t see, the chef gets away with&quot; and that &quot;the better the kitchen, the filthier it is.&quot; He used to work in Dorchester (not at The Dorchester, as a guest wrongly infers). In &quot;The Anniversary&quot; Terry and Manuel come to blows since Terry doesn&#x27;t like anyone overshadowing him as a cook, so he proceeds to sabotage the paella Manuel is making for Basil and Sybil, leading to fisticuffs at the end of the episode. Cleese himself told Hall to portray Terry as if he were on the run from the police.
* Major Gowen, played by Ballard Berkeley, is a slightly senile, amiable old soldier who is a permanent resident of the hotel. He is one of the few guests whom Basil seems to like. This is because he has the establishment status that Basil craves. He usually wears the Royal Artillery jagged-striped tie, and once mentions to Mrs. Peignoir being in France in 1918. He often is introduced as their &quot;oldest resident&quot; and in the episode &quot;Waldorf Salad&quot; Basil reveals that the Major has lived there for seven years. He enjoys talking about the world outside, especially the cricket scores and workers&#x27; strikes (the frequent strikes at British Leyland during the time of the series&#x27; original transmission were often mentioned), and is always on the lookout for the newspaper. In the episode &quot;The Germans&quot; he shows he has trouble forgiving the Germans because of the wars. The best he can say is that German women make good card players. In the same episode, he also demonstrates his outdated racial attitudes when he comments about the ethnic difference between &quot;wogs&quot; and &quot;niggers&quot;. Despite his good intentions, the Major can cause Basil&#x27;s plans to go awry, notably in the episode &quot;Communication Problems&quot; in which Basil tries his best to keep secret from Sybil the money he won in a bet.
* Miss Tibbs and Miss Gatsby, played by Gilly Flower and Renee Roberts, are the other two permanent residents. Seemingly inseparable, these sweet-natured, dotty spinsters appear to have taken a fancy to Basil, feeling that they need to take care of him. In response, Basil vacillates between superficial charm and blunt rudeness during his conversations with them.
* Audrey is Sybil&#x27;s lifelong best friend, and is mostly acknowledged during gossipy telephone calls. Talking with her is a refuge for Sybil. When times get tough for Audrey, who has a dysfunctional relationship with her husband George, Sybil will offer solutions and guidance, often resulting in the catchphrase &quot;Ohhh, I knowwww...&quot; when she tries to commiserate with Audrey&#x27;s problems. In Audrey&#x27;s one on-screen appearance, in &quot;The Anniversary&quot;, she is played by actress Christine Shaw. Basil tells Major Gowen that he thinks she is a &quot;dreadful woman&quot;.
* A running gag throughout the two series is the rearranged letters of the &quot;Fawlty Towers&quot; hotel sign which is shown at the beginning of every episode except &quot;The Germans&quot;, when a hospital exterior is used as an establishing shot. In series one, the letters slowly fall from the sign due to lack of maintenance. In series two, the letters are re-arranged into a series of deliberate anagrams. The paperboy, though rarely seen, is revealed at the beginning of &quot;The Psychiatrist&quot; to be the prankster who rearranges the letters on the sign to sometimes crude phrases.
* Terence Conoley appears in two episodes as entirely different characters. In &quot;A Touch of Class&quot; he plays Mr. Wareing, and in &quot;Waldorf Salad&quot; he portrays Mr. Johnston.

==Episodes==

The first episode of &quot;Fawlty Towers&quot; was recorded as a pilot on 24 December 1974, the rest of the series being recorded later in 1975. It was then originally broadcast on 19 September. The 12th and final episode was first shown on 25 October 1979. The first series was directed by John Howard Davies, the second by Bob Spiers. Both had their premieres on BBC Two.

When originally transmitted, the individual episodes had no on-screen titles. The ones in common currency were first used for the VHS release of the series in the 1980s. There were working titles, such as &quot;USA&quot; for &quot;Waldorf Salad&quot;, &quot;Death&quot; for &quot;The Kipper and the Corpse&quot; and &quot;Rat&quot; for &quot;Basil the Rat&quot;, which have been printed in some programme guides. In addition, some of the early BBC audio releases of episodes on vinyl and cassette included other variations, such as &quot;Mrs. Richards&quot; and &quot;The Rat&quot; for &quot;Communication Problems&quot; and &quot;Basil the Rat&quot; respectively.

In 2022, a &quot;lost&quot; scene cut from the episode &quot;The Anniversary&quot; (that went unfilmed) was uncovered as part of a script copy, featuring Basil climbing out his bedroom window to avoid sex with a drunken Sybil, who had wanted to make up.

It has long been rumoured that a 13th episode of the series was written and filmed, but never progressed further than a rough cut. Lars Holger Holm, author of the book &quot;Fawlty Towers: A Worshipper&#x27;s Companion,&quot; has made detailed claims about the episode&#x27;s content, but he provides no concrete evidence of its existence.

On the subject of whether more episodes would be produced, Cleese said (in an interview for the complete DVD boxed set, which was republished in the book &quot;Fawlty Towers Fully Booked&quot;) that he once had the genesis of a feature-length special—possibly sometime during the mid-1990s. The plot, never fleshed out beyond his initial idea, would have revolved around the chaos that a now-retired Basil typically caused as he and Sybil flew to Barcelona to visit their former employee Manuel and his family. Of the idea, Cleese said:

We had an idea for a plot which I loved. Basil was finally invited to Spain to meet Manuel&#x27;s family. He gets to Heathrow and then spends about 14 frustrating hours waiting for the flight. Finally, on the plane, a terrorist pulls a gun and tries to hijack the thing. Basil is so angry he overcomes the terrorist, and when the pilot says, &quot;We have to fly back to Heathrow&quot; Basil says, &quot;No, fly us to Spain or I&#x27;ll shoot you.&quot; He arrives in Spain, is immediately arrested, and spends the entire holiday in a Spanish jail. He is released just in time to go back on the plane with Sybil.

It was very funny, but I couldn&#x27;t do it at the time. Making &quot;Fawlty Towers&quot; work at 90 minutes was a very difficult proposition. You can build up the comedy for 30 minutes, but at that length there has to be a trough and another peak. It doesn&#x27;t interest me. I don&#x27;t want to do it.

Cleese also may have been reluctant because of Connie Booth&#x27;s unwillingness to be involved. She had practically retreated from public life after the show finished (and had been initially unwilling to collaborate on a second series, which explains the four-year gap between productions).

The decision by Cleese and Booth to quit before a third series has often been lauded as it ensured the show&#x27;s successful status would not be weakened with later, lower-quality work. Subsequently, it has inspired the makers of other shows to do likewise. Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant refused to make a third series of either &quot;The Office&quot; or &quot;Extras&quot;, citing &quot;Fawlty Towers&#x27; &quot; short lifespan. Rik Mayall, Ben Elton and Lise Mayer, the writers behind &quot;The Young Ones&quot;, which also ran for only two series (each with six episodes), used this explanation as well. Victoria Wood also indicated this influenced her decision to limit &quot;dinnerladies&quot; to 16 episodes over two series.

The origins, background and eventual cancellation of the series were later humorously referenced in 1987&#x27;s &quot;The Secret Policeman&#x27;s Third Ball&quot; in a sketch in which Hugh Laurie and Stephen Fry present Cleese—whom they comically misname &quot;Jim Cleese&quot;—with a Dick Emery Lifetime Achievement Award (&quot;Silver Dick&quot;) for his contributions to comedy, then launch into a comical series of questions regarding the show, including Cleese&#x27;s marriage and divorce from Booth, innocently ridiculing Cleese and reducing him to tears, to a point at which he gets on his knees and crawls off the stage while crying.

===Series overview===
===Series 1 (1975)===
===Series 2 (1979)===
The second series was transmitted three-and-a-half years later, with the first episode being broadcast on 19 February 1979. Due to an industrial dispute at the BBC, which resulted in a strike, the final episode was not completed until well after the others, being finally shown as a one-off instalment on 25 October 1979. The cancelled episode on 19 March was replaced with a repeat of &quot;Gourmet Night&quot; from series 1. In the second series the anagrams were created by Ian McClane, the assistant floor manager. However, the only one which is actually a true anagram for the hotel&#x27;s name is &quot;Flowery Twats&quot;, created for &quot;The Anniversary&quot;

==Reception==

===Critical reaction===
====Contemporary====
At first, the series was not universally held in high esteem. &quot;The Daily Mirror&quot;&#x27;s review of the show in 1975 had the headline &quot;Long John Short On Jokes&quot;. One critic of the show was Richard Ingrams, then television reviewer for &quot;The Spectator&quot;, who wrote a caustic piece condemning the programme. Cleese got his revenge by naming one of the guests in the second series &quot;Mr. Ingrams&quot;, who is caught in his room with a blow-up doll. However, many contemporary critics were effusive in their praise for the series. &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; called it &quot;the funniest sitcom in years&quot;. Clive James writing in &quot;The Observer&quot; said the second episode had him &quot;retching with laughter.&quot; Peter Fiddick also championed &quot;Fawlty Towers&quot; in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, calling it &quot;the undoubted hit even of a season with a lot of comedy on show&quot; and &quot;one of the most amazingly funny programmes to come out of any television&quot;. When the first series ended, the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; made the final episode its pick of the day, with Tim Ewbank writing, &quot;Sadly, the hilarious series FAWLTY TOWERS...ends tonight and the hope must be that it gets a repeat showing to the wider BBC 1 audience.&quot;

====Retrospective====
On Rotten Tomatoes, Fawlty Towers has an aggregate score of 100% based on 14 critic reviews. The website&#x27;s consensus reads: &quot;&quot;Fawlty Towers&quot; looms large over British comedy with John Cleese&#x27;s impeccably hapless performance and an endless array of exuberant slapstick—making for a supremely stimulating chuckler.&quot;

In an interview for the &quot;TV Characters&quot; edition of Channel 4&#x27;s &quot;talking heads&quot; strand 100 Greatest (in which Basil placed second, between Homer Simpson and Edmund Blackadder), TV critic A. A. Gill theorised that the initially muted response may have been caused by Cleese seemingly ditching his label as a comic revolutionary—earned through his years with Monty Python—to do something more traditional.

In a list of the 100 Greatest British Television Programmes drawn up by the British Film Institute in 2000, voted for by industry professionals, &quot;Fawlty Towers&quot; was placed first. It was also voted fifth in the &quot;Britain&#x27;s Best Sitcom&quot; poll in 2004, and second only to &quot;Frasier&quot; in The Ultimate Sitcom poll of comedy writers in January 2006. Basil Fawlty came top of the &quot;Britain&#x27;s Funniest Comedy Character&quot; poll, held by Five on 14 May 2006. In 1997, &quot;The Germans&quot; was ranked No. 12 on TV Guide&#x27;s 100 Greatest Episodes of All Time. &quot;Empire&quot; magazine&#x27;s 2024 list of the 100 greatest TV shows of all time ranks it at No. 22. The entry states:

===Awards and accolades===

Three British Academy Television Awards (BAFTAs) were awarded to people for their involvement with the series. Both of the series were awarded the BAFTA in the category Best Scripted Comedy, the first being won by John Howard Davies in 1976, and the second by Douglas Argent and Bob Spiers in 1980. In 1980, Cleese received the BAFTA for Best Entertainment Performance.

In a list drawn up by the British Film Institute in 2000, voted by industry professionals, &quot;Fawlty Towers&quot; was named the best British television series of all time.

===Legacy===
John Lennon was a fan of the show. He said in 1980: &quot;I love &quot;Fawlty Towers&quot;. I&#x27;d like to be in that. [It&#x27;s] the greatest show I&#x27;ve seen in years... what a masterpiece, a beautiful thing.&quot; Kate Bush stated, &quot;I still think &quot;Fawlty Towers&quot; is the best sitcom ever.&quot; Filmmaker Martin Scorsese has remarked he is a great fan of &quot;Fawlty Towers&quot; and named &quot;The Germans&quot; as his favourite episode. He described the scene with Basil impersonating Hitler as &quot;so tasteless, it&#x27;s hilarious&quot;. Naming &quot;Fawlty Towers&quot; among the shows he loved growing up, comedy writer Graham Linehan cited the &quot;farce elements&quot; of the show as an influence for his much acclaimed sitcom &quot;Father Ted&quot;.

==Remakes, adaptations and reunions==
Three attempted remakes of &quot;Fawlty Towers&quot; were started for the American market, with two making it into production. The first, &quot;Chateau Snavely&quot;, starring Harvey Korman and Betty White, was produced by ABC for a pilot in 1978, but the transfer from coastal hotel to highway motel proved too much and the series was never produced. The second, also by ABC, was &quot;Amanda&#x27;s&quot;, starring Bea Arthur, notable for switching the sexes of its Basil and Sybil equivalents. It also failed to attract a major audience and was dropped after ten episodes had been aired, despite 13 completed episodes. A third remake, called &quot;Payne&quot; (produced by and starring John Larroquette), aired in 1999, but was cancelled shortly afterwards. Nine episodes were produced, of which eight aired on American television (though the complete run was broadcast overseas). A German pilot was made in 2001, named &quot;Zum letzten Kliff&quot; (To the last cliff), but no further episodes were made after its first series.

Popular American sitcoms &quot;3rd Rock from the Sun&quot; and &quot;Cheers&quot; (in both of which Cleese made guest appearances) have cited &quot;Fawlty Towers&quot; as an inspiration, especially regarding its depiction of a dysfunctional workplace &quot;family&quot;. Arthur Mathews and Graham Linehan have cited &quot;Fawlty&quot; as a major influence on their sitcom &quot;Father Ted&quot;. &quot;Guest House&quot; on Pakistan&#x27;s PTV also resembled the series.

Several of the characters have made other appearances, as spinoffs or in small cameo roles. In 1981, in character as Manuel, Sachs recorded his own version of the Joe Dolce cod-Italian song &quot;Shaddap You Face&quot; (with the B-side &quot;Waiter, There&#x27;s a Spanish Flea in My Soup&quot;) but the record was not released because Dolce took out an injunction: he was about to issue his version in Britain. Sachs also portrayed a Manuel-like character in a series of British TV advertisements for life insurance. Gilly Flower and Renee Roberts, who played elderly ladies Miss Tibbs and Miss Gatsby in the series, reprised their roles in a 1983 episode of &quot;Only Fools and Horses&quot;. In 2006, Cleese played Basil for the first time in 27 years, for an unofficial England 2006 World Cup song, &quot;Don&#x27;t Mention the World Cup&quot;, taking its name from the phrase, &quot;Don&#x27;t mention the war,&quot; which Basil used in the episode &quot;The Germans&quot;. In 2007, Cleese and Sachs reprised their roles for a six-episode corporate business video for the Norwegian oil company Statoil. In the video, Fawlty is running a restaurant called &quot;Basil&#x27;s Brasserie&quot; while Manuel owns a Michelin-starred restaurant in London.

In November 2007, Scales returned to play Sybil in a series of sketches for the BBC&#x27;s annual &quot;Children in Need&quot; charity telethon. The character was seen taking over the management of the eponymous hotel from the BBC drama series &quot;Hotel Babylon&quot;, interacting with characters from that programme as well as other 1970s sitcom characters. The character of Sybil was used with Cleese&#x27;s permission. In 2007, the Los Angeles Film School produced seven episodes of &quot;Fawlty Tower Oxnard&quot;, starring Robert Romanus as Basil.

At a 2009 reunion event for the Gold channel as &quot;Fawlty Towers: Re-Opened&quot;, Cleese said that the cast would never make another episode of the series because they are &quot;too old and tired&quot; and expectations would be too high.

In 2016, Cleese reprised his role as Basil in a series of TV adverts for High Street optician chain Specsavers. The same year, Cleese and Booth reunited to create and co-write the official theatrical adaptation of &quot;Fawlty Towers&quot;, which premiered in Melbourne at the Comedy Theatre. It was critically well received, subsequently embarking on a successful tour of Australia. Cleese was intimately involved in the creation of the stage version from the beginning, including casting. He visited Australia to promote, as well as oversee its success. Melbourne was chosen to premiere the adaptation due to the series&#x27; enduring popularity in Australia, and also as it had become a popular international test market for large-scale theatrical productions in recent years, having recently been the city where the revised &quot;Love Never Dies&quot; and the new &quot;King Kong&quot; also premiered. Cleese also noted he did not believe the London press would give the adaptation fair, unbiased reviews, so he deliberately chose to premiere it elsewhere. On 2 February 2024, it was announced that the 2016 stage show based on &quot;Fawlty Towers&quot; would launch at London&#x27;s Apollo Theatre later that year.

Prior to the launch of the official &quot;Fawlty Towers&quot; theatrical adaptation in 2016, Cleese contested the legal validity of the Australian touring stage production, &quot;Faulty Towers The Dining Experience&quot;, and threatened to sue its creators; this subsequently led to the cancellation of the tribute show&#x27;s US tour.

Cleese suggested he was producing a sequel series in 2023, along with his daughter Camilla. The show is presumably under development at Castle Rock Entertainment, with Matthew George, Rob Reiner, Michele Reiner and Derrick Rossi as executive producers. The premise sees Basil (Cleese) trying to operate Fawlty Towers with help from his long-lost daughter (Camilla) and adjusting to the modern world. Cleese admitted the company was too hasty in announcing the reboot, and that he only had &quot;half an idea&quot; being workshopped as of July 2023. He said that the series would &quot;probably&quot; be set in the Caribbean. Cleese confirmed to GB News that the sequel series, unlike the original series, would not be broadcast on the BBC, feeling the broadcaster would have limited his creative freedom.

==Overseas==
In 1977 and 1978 alone, the original TV show was sold to 45 stations in 17 countries and was the BBC&#x27;s best-selling overseas programme for that year. &quot;Fawlty Towers&quot; became a huge success in almost all countries in which it aired. Although it initially was a flop in Spain, largely because of the portrayal of the Spanish waiter Manuel, it was successfully resold with the Manuel character&#x27;s nationality changed to Italian except in Spain&#x27;s Catalan region where Manuel was Mexican. To show how badly it translated, Clive James picked up a clip containing Manuel&#x27;s &quot;¿Qué?&quot; phrase to show on &quot;Clive James on Television&quot; in 1982. The series also briefly was broadcast in Italy in the 1990s on the satellite channel Canal Jimmy, in the original English with Italian subtitles.

In Australia, the show originally was broadcast on ABC Television, the first series in 1976 and the second series in 1980. The show then was sold to the Seven Network where it has been repeated numerous times.

==Home media and merchandise==
===Audio releases===
Four albums were released by BBC Records on vinyl LP and cassette. These consisted of the original television soundtracks, and from the second album onwards had additional voice-over from Sachs (in character as Manuel) describing scenes which relied on visual humour.

The first album, simply titled &quot;Fawlty Towers&quot;, was released in 1979 and contained audio from &quot;Communication Problems&quot; (as &quot;Mrs Richards&quot;) and &quot;Hotel Inspectors&quot;. The second album, &quot;Second Sitting&quot;, was released in 1981 and contained audio from &quot;Basil the Rat&quot; (as &quot;The Rat&quot;) and &quot;The Builders&quot;. Both of these first two albums reached the Top 30 of the UK Albums Chart.

&quot;At Your Service&quot; was released in 1982, and contained audio from &quot;The Kipper and the Corpse&quot; (as &quot;Death&quot;) and &quot;The Germans&quot; (as &quot;Fire Drill&quot;). Finally, &quot;A La Carte&quot; was released in 1983, and contained audio from &quot;Waldorf Salad&quot; (as &quot;The Americans&quot;) and &quot;Gourmet Night&quot;.

The albums were re-released as double-cassette packs under the titles &quot;Fawlty Towers 1&quot; and &quot;Fawlty Towers 2&quot; in 1988. The remaining four episodes did not get an audio-only release until 1994 on audio cassette as &quot;Fawlty Towers 3&quot;.

The first CD release of the audio versions was in a boxed set in 2003, titled &quot;Fawlty Towers—The Collector&#x27;s Edition&quot;, which included spoken introductions to each episode by Cleese, and an interview with Scales and Sachs.

The four vinyl records were reissued in a limited edition boxed set, along with the remaining four episodes on vinyl for the first time, for Record Store Day in 2021.

===Home media===
&quot;Fawlty Towers&quot; was originally released by BBC Video in 1984, with three episodes on each of four tapes. Each was edited with the credits from all three episodes put at the end of the tape. A LaserDisc containing all episodes spliced together as a continuous episode was released in the U.S. on 23 June 1993. It was re-released in 1994, unedited but digitally remastered. It also was re-released in 1997 with a special interview with Cleese. &quot;Fawlty Towers—The Complete Series&quot; was released on DVD on 16 October 2001, available in regions 1, 2 and 4. A &quot;Collector&#x27;s Edition&quot; is available in region 2.

The original DVD contained a slightly edited version of &quot;The Kipper and the Corpse&quot;, in which Basil&#x27;s line &quot;Is it your legs?&quot; (said to Mr Lehman when asking why he wants breakfast in bed) is missing. This line was restored in subsequent remasters.

Series one was released on UMD Video for PSP. In July 2009, BBC America announced a DVD reissue, released on 20 October 2009. Titled &quot;Fawlty Towers Remastered: Special Edition&quot;, contains commentary by Cleese on every episode as well as remastered video and audio. All episodes were previously available as streamed video-on-demand via Britbox, Netflix and Amazon Prime Video. Additionally, both series were previously available for download on iTunes. In 2021, all episodes were made available on the BBC iPlayer.

===Computer game===
A &quot;Fawlty Towers&quot; game was released on PC in 2000 and featured a number of interactive games, desktop-customizing content, and clips from the show.

===Books===
The original scripts were released in a hardback book by Methuen, &quot;The Complete Fawlty Towers&quot;, in 1988.

<doc id="11675" wikidata="Q202961" url="?curid=11675" title="False friend">
<text>In linguistics, a false friend is a word in a different language that looks or sounds similar to a word in a given language, but differs significantly in meaning. Examples of false friends include English &quot;embarrassed&quot; and Spanish &quot;embarazado&quot; &#x27;pregnant&#x27;; English &quot;parents&quot; versus Portuguese &quot;parentes&quot; and Italian &quot;parenti&quot; (both meaning &#x27;relatives&#x27;); English &quot;demand&quot; and French &quot;demander&quot; &#x27;ask&#x27;; and English &quot;gift&quot;, German &quot;Gift&quot; &#x27;poison&#x27;, and Norwegian &quot;gift&quot;, both &#x27;married&#x27; and &#x27;poison&#x27;.

The term was introduced by a French book, &quot;Les faux amis: ou, Les trahisons du vocabulaire anglais&quot; (&quot;False friends, or, the betrayals of English vocabulary&quot;), published in 1928.

As well as producing completely false friends, the use of loanwords often results in the use of a word in a restricted context, which may then develop new meanings not found in the original language. For example, &quot;angst&quot; means &#x27;fear&#x27; in a general sense (as well as &#x27;anxiety&#x27;) in German, but when it was borrowed into English in the context of psychology, its meaning was restricted to a particular type of fear described as &quot;a neurotic feeling of anxiety and depression&quot;. Also, &quot;gymnasium&quot; meant both &#x27;a place of education&#x27; and &#x27;a place for exercise&#x27; in Latin, but its meaning became restricted to the former in German and to the latter in English, making the expressions into false friends in those languages as well as in Ancient Greek, where it started out as &#x27;a place for naked exercise&#x27;.

== Definition and origin ==

False friends are bilingual homophones or bilingual homographs, i.e., words in two or more languages that look similar (&quot;homographs&quot;) or sound similar (&quot;homophones&quot;), but differ significantly in meaning.

The origin of the term is as a shortened version of the expression &quot;false friend of a translator&quot;, the English translation of a French expression () introduced by Maxime Kœssler and Jules Derocquigny in their 1928 book, with a sequel, &quot;Autres Mots anglais perfides&quot;.

== Causes ==
From the etymological point of view, false friends can be created in several ways.

=== Shared etymology ===

If language A borrowed a word from language B, or both borrowed the word from a third language or inherited it from a common ancestor, and later the word shifted in meaning or acquired additional meanings in at least one of these languages, a native speaker of one language will face a false friend when learning the other. Sometimes, presumably both senses were present in the common ancestor language, but the cognate words took on different restricted senses in Language A and Language B.

====In loanwords====
&quot;Actual&quot;, which in English is usually a synonym of &quot;real&quot;, has a different meaning in other European languages, in which it means &#x27;current&#x27; or &#x27;up-to-date&#x27;, and has the logical derivative as a verb, meaning &#x27;to make current&#x27; or &#x27;to update&#x27;. &quot;Actualise&quot; (or &#x27;actualize&#x27;) in English means &#x27;to make a reality of&#x27;.

The Italian word &quot;confetti&quot; &#x27;sugared almonds&#x27; has acquired a new meaning in English, French and Dutch; in Italian, the corresponding word is &quot;coriandoli&quot;.

English and Spanish, both of which have borrowed from Ancient Greek and Latin, have multiple false friends, such as:

English and Japanese also have diverse false friends, many of them being &quot;wasei-eigo&quot; and &quot;gairaigo&quot; words.

====In native words====
The word &quot;friend&quot; itself has cognates in the other Germanic languages, but the Scandinavian ones (like Swedish &quot;frände&quot;, Danish &quot;frænde&quot;) predominantly mean &#x27;relative&#x27;. The original Proto-Germanic word meant simply &#x27;someone whom one cares for&#x27; and could therefore refer to both a friend and a relative, but it lost various degrees of the &#x27;friend&#x27; sense in the Scandinavian languages, while it mostly lost the sense of &#x27;relative&#x27; in English (the plural &quot;friends&quot; is still, rarely, used for &quot;kinsfolk&quot;, as in the Scottish proverb &quot;Friends agree best at a distance&quot;, quoted in 1721).

The Estonian and Finnish languages are related, which gives rise to false friends such as swapped forms for south and south-west:
Or Estonian &quot;vaim&quot; &#x27;spirit; ghost&#x27; and Finnish &quot;vaimo&quot; &#x27;wife&#x27;; or Estonian &quot;huvitav&quot; &#x27;interesting&#x27; and Finnish &quot;huvittava&quot; &#x27;amusing&#x27; or Estonian &quot;koristaja&quot; &#x27;a cleaner&#x27; and Finnish &quot;koristaja&quot; &#x27;a decorator&#x27;.

A high level of lexical similarity exists between German and Dutch, but shifts in meaning of words with a shared etymology have in some instances resulted in &#x27;bi-directional false friends&#x27;:

Note that &quot;die See&quot; means &#x27;sea&#x27;, and thus is not a false friend.
The meanings could diverge significantly. For example, the Proto-Malayo-Polynesian word &quot;*qayam&quot; &quot;domesticated animal&quot; became specialized in descendant languages: Malay/Indonesian &quot;ayam&quot; &#x27;chicken&#x27;, Cebuano &quot;ayam&quot; &#x27;dog&#x27;, and Gaddang &quot;ayam&quot; &#x27;pig&#x27;.

=== Homonyms ===

In Swedish, the word &quot;rolig&quot; means &#x27;fun&#x27;: &quot;ett roligt skämt&quot; &#x27;a funny joke&#x27;, while in the closely related languages Danish and Norwegian it means &#x27;calm&#x27; (as in &quot;he was calm despite all the commotion around him&quot;). However, the Swedish original meaning of &#x27;calm&#x27; is retained in some related words such as &quot;ro&quot; &#x27;calmness&#x27;, and &quot;orolig&quot; &#x27;worrisome, anxious&#x27;, literally &#x27;un-calm&#x27;. The Danish and Norwegian word &quot;semester&quot; means term (as in school term), but the Swedish word &quot;semester&quot; means holiday. The Danish word &quot;frokost&quot; means lunch, while the Norwegian word &quot;frokost&quot; and the Swedish word &quot;frukost&quot; both mean breakfast.

=== Pseudo-anglicisms ===
Pseudo-anglicisms are new words formed from English morphemes independently from an analogous English construct and with a different intended meaning.

Japanese is replete with pseudo-anglicisms, known as &quot;wasei-eigo&quot; &#x27;Japan-made English&#x27;.

== Semantic change ==
In bilingual situations, false friends often result in a semantic change—a real new meaning that is then commonly used in a language. For example, the Portuguese &quot;humoroso&quot; &#x27;capricious&#x27; changed its meaning in American Portuguese to &#x27;humorous&#x27;, owing to the English surface-cognate &quot;humorous&quot;.

The American Italian &quot;fattoria&quot; lost its original meaning, &quot;farm&quot;, in favor of &quot;factory&quot;, owing to the phonetically similar surface-cognate English &quot;factory&quot; (cf. Standard Italian &quot;fabbrica&quot;, &#x27;factory&#x27;). Instead of the original &quot;fattoria&quot;, the phonetic adaptation American Italian &quot;farma&quot; became the new signifier for &quot;farm&quot; (Weinreich 1963: 49; see &quot;one-to-one correlation between signifiers and referents&quot;).

Due to the closeness between Italian &quot;terra rossa&quot; &#x27;red soil&#x27; and Portuguese &quot;terra roxa&quot; &#x27;purple soil&#x27;, Italian farmers in Brazil used &quot;terra roxa&quot; to describe a type of soil similar to the red Mediterranean soil. The actual Portuguese word for &quot;red&quot; is &quot;vermelha&quot;. Nevertheless, &quot;terra roxa&quot; and &quot;terra vermelha&quot; are still used interchangeably in Brazilian agriculture.

Quebec French is also known for shifting the meanings of some words toward those of their English cognates, but such words are considered false friends in European French. For example, &quot;éventuellement&quot; is commonly used as &quot;eventually&quot; in Quebec but means &quot;perhaps&quot; in Europe.

This phenomenon is analyzed by Ghil&#x27;ad Zuckermann as &quot;(incestuous) phono-semantic matching&quot;.

<text>False cognates are pairs of words that seem to be cognates because of similar sounds and meaning, but have different etymologies; they can be within the same language or from different languages, even within the same family. For example, the English word &quot;&quot; and the Mbabaram word &quot;&quot; have exactly the same meaning and very similar pronunciations, but by complete coincidence. Likewise, English &quot;&quot; and Spanish &quot;&quot; came by their similar meanings via completely different Proto-Indo-European roots, and same for English &quot;&quot; and Spanish &quot;&quot;. This is different from false friends, which are similar-sounding words with different meanings, and may or may not be cognates. 

Even though false cognates lack a common root, there may still be an indirect connection between them (for example by phono-semantic matching or folk etymology).

==Phenomenon==
The term &quot;false cognate&quot; is sometimes misused to refer to false friends, but the two phenomena are distinct. False friends occur when two words in different languages or dialects look similar, but have different meanings. While some false friends are also false cognates, many are genuine cognates (see False friends § Causes). For example, English &quot;pretend&quot; and French &quot;prétendre&quot; are false friends, but not false cognates, as they have the same origin.

==&quot;Mama and papa&quot; type==

The basic kinship terms mama and papa comprise a special case of false cognates; many languages share words of similar form and meaning for these kinship terms, but due to common processes of language acquisition rather than relatedness of the languages.

==Examples==
&quot;Note: Some etymologies may be simplified to avoid overly long descriptions&quot;.

===Within English===
=== Between English and other languages ===
=== Between other languages ===
==False cognates used in the coinage of new words==
The coincidental similarity between false cognates can sometimes be used in the creation of new words (neologization). For example, the Hebrew word &quot;dal&quot; (&quot;poor&quot;) (which is a false cognate of the phono-semantically similar English word &quot;dull&quot;) is used in the new Israeli Hebrew expression אין רגע דל &quot;en rega dal&quot; (literally &quot;There is no poor moment&quot;) as a phono-semantic matching for the English expression &quot;Never a dull moment&quot;.

Similarly, the Hebrew word דיבוב &quot;dibúv&quot; (&quot;speech, inducing someone to speak&quot;), which is a false cognate of (and thus etymologically unrelated to) the phono-semantically similar English word &quot;dubbing&quot;, is then used in the Israeli phono-semantic matching for &quot;dubbing&quot;. The result is that in Modern Hebrew, דיבוב &quot;dibúv&quot; means &quot;dubbing&quot;.

<doc id="11684" wikidata="Q467042" url="?curid=11684" title="Fundamental analysis">
<text>Fundamental analysis, in accounting and finance, is the analysis of a business&#x27;s financial statements (usually to analyze the business&#x27;s assets, liabilities, and earnings); health; competitors and markets. It also considers the overall state of the economy and factors including interest rates, production, earnings, employment, GDP, housing, manufacturing and management. There are two basic approaches that can be used: bottom up analysis and top down analysis. These terms are used to distinguish such analysis from other types of investment analysis, such as quantitative and technical.

Fundamental analysis is performed on historical and present data, but with the goal of making financial forecasts. There are several possible objectives: 
* to conduct a company stock valuation and predict its probable price evolution;
* to make a projection on its business performance;
* to evaluate its management and make internal business decisions and/or to calculate its credit risk;
* to find out the intrinsic value of the share.

==The two analytical models==
There are two basic methodologies investors rely upon when the objective of the analysis is to determine what stock to buy and at what price:

#Fundamental analysis. Analysts maintain that markets may incorrectly price a security in the short run but the &quot;correct&quot; price will eventually be reached. Profits can be made by purchasing or selling the wrongly priced security and then waiting for the market to recognize its &quot;mistake&quot; and reprice the security.
#Technical analysis. Analysts look at trends and price levels and believe that trend changes confirm sentiment changes. Recognizable price chart patterns may be found due to investors&#x27; emotional responses to price movements. Technical analysts mainly evaluate historical trends and ranges to predict future price movement.

Investors can use one or both of these complementary methods for stock picking. For example, many fundamental investors use technical indicators for deciding entry and exit points. Similarly, a large proportion of technical investors use fundamental indicators to limit their pool of possible stocks to &quot;good&quot; companies.

The choice of stock analysis is determined by the investor&#x27;s belief in the different paradigms for &quot;how the stock market works&quot;. For explanations of these paradigms, see the discussions at efficient-market hypothesis, random walk hypothesis, capital asset pricing model, Fed model, market-based valuation, and behavioral finance.

Fundamental analysis includes:
#Economic analysis
#Industry analysis
#Company analysis

The intrinsic value of the shares is determined based upon these three analyses. It is this value that is considered the true value of the share. If the intrinsic value is higher than the market price, buying the share is recommended. If it is equal to market price, it is recommended to hold the share; and if it is less than the market price, then one should sell the shares.

==Use by different portfolio styles==
Investors may also use fundamental analysis within different portfolio management styles.
*Buy and hold investors believe that latching on to good businesses allows the investor&#x27;s asset to grow with the business. Fundamental analysis lets them find &quot;good&quot; companies, so they lower their risk and the probability of wipe-out.
*Value investors restrict their attention to under-valued companies, believing that &quot;it&#x27;s hard to fall out of a ditch&quot;. The values they follow come from fundamental analysis.
*Managers may use fundamental analysis to correctly value &quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad&quot; companies. 
*Managers may also consider the economic cycle in determining whether conditions are &quot;right&quot; to buy fundamentally suitable companies.
*Contrarian investors hold that &quot;in the short run, the market is a voting machine, not a weighing machine&quot;. Fundamental analysis allows an investor to make his or her own decision on value, while ignoring the opinions of the market.
*Managers may use fundamental analysis to determine future growth rates for buying high priced growth stocks.
*Managers may include fundamental factors along with technical factors in computer models (quantitative analysis).

==Top-down and bottom-up approaches==
Investors using fundamental analysis can use either a top-down or bottom-up approach.
*The top-down investor starts their analysis with global economics, including both international and national economic indicators. These may include GDP growth rates, inflation, interest rates, exchange rates, productivity, and energy prices. They subsequently narrow their search to regional/ industry analysis of total sales, price levels, the effects of competing products, foreign competition, and entry or exit from the industry. Only then do they refine their search to the best business in the area being studied.
*The bottom-up investor starts with specific businesses, regardless of their industry/region, and proceeds in reverse of the top-down approach.

==Procedures==
The analysis of a business&#x27;s health starts with a financial statement analysis that includes financial ratios. It looks at dividends paid, operating cash flow, new equity issues and capital financing. The earnings estimates and growth rate projections published widely by Thomson Reuters and others can be considered either &quot;fundamental&quot; (they are facts) or &quot;technical&quot; (they are investor sentiment) based on perception of their validity.

Determined growth rates (of income and cash) and risk levels (to determine the discount rate) are used in various valuation models. The foremost is the discounted cash flow model, which calculates the present value of the future:
*dividends received by the investor, along with the eventual sale price; (Gordon model)
*earnings of the company;
*or cash flows of the company.

The simple model commonly used is the P/E ratio (price-to-earnings ratio). Implicit in this model of a perpetual annuity (time value of money) is that the inverse, or the E/P rate, is the discount rate appropriate to the risk of the business. Usage of the P/E ratio has the disadvantage that it ignores future earnings growth.

Because the future growth of the free cash flow and earnings of a company drive the fair value of the company, the PEG ratio is more meaningful than the P/E ratio. The PEG ratio incorporates the growth estimates for future earnings, e.g. of the EBIT. Its validity depends on the length of time analysts believe the growth will continue and on the reasonableness of future estimates compared to earnings growth in the past years (oftentimes the last seven years). IGAR models can be used to impute expected changes in growth from current P/E and historical growth rates for the stocks relative to a comparison index.

The amount of debt a company possesses is also a major consideration in determining its financial leverage and its health. This is meaningful because a company can reach higher earnings (and this way a higher return on equity and higher P/E ratio) simply by increasing the amount of net debt. This can be quickly assessed using the debt-to-equity ratio, the current ratio (current assets/current liabilities) and the return on capital employed (ROCE). The ROCE is the ratio of EBIT divided by the &quot;capital employed&quot;, i.e. all the current and non-current assets less the operating liabilities, which is the real capital of the company no matter if it is financed by equity or debt.

==Criticisms==
Economists such as Burton Malkiel suggest that neither fundamental analysis nor technical analysis is useful in outperforming the markets.

<doc id="11685" wikidata="Q209282" url="?curid=11685" title="Frasier">
<text>Frasier () is an American television sitcom that was broadcast on NBC for 11 seasons from September 16, 1993, to May 13, 2004. The program was created and produced by David Angell, Peter Casey, and David Lee (as Grub Street Productions), in association with Grammnet (2004) and Paramount Television.

The series was created as a spin-off of the sitcom &quot;Cheers&quot;. It continues the story of psychiatrist Frasier Crane (Kelsey Grammer), who returns to his hometown, Seattle, as a radio show host. He reconnects with his father, Martin (John Mahoney), a retired police officer, and his younger brother, Niles (David Hyde Pierce), a fellow psychiatrist. Included in the series cast were Peri Gilpin as Frasier&#x27;s producer Roz Doyle, and Jane Leeves as Daphne Moon, Martin&#x27;s live-in caregiver. Dan Butler&#x27;s role as Bob &quot;Bulldog&quot; Briscoe, a sports talk show host on Frasier&#x27;s station, was later upgraded from a recurring to main character in some seasons. The role of Frasier&#x27;s ex-wife, Lilith Sternin, was played by Bebe Neuwirth.

Like its predecessor, &quot;Cheers&quot;, &quot;Frasier&quot; received critical acclaim, and is highly regarded in both the USA and the UK. The series and the cast won 37 Primetime Emmy Awards, a record at the time for a scripted series, It also won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Comedy Series for five consecutive years. A revival series, also titled &quot;Frasier&quot;, premiered on the Paramount+ service on October 12, 2023.

==Overview==
Psychiatrist Frasier Crane (Grammer) returns to his hometown of Seattle, Washington from Boston, following the end of his marriage. His plans for a new life as a single man are challenged when he is obliged to take in his father, Martin (Mahoney), a retired police detective who has mobility problems after being shot in the line of duty during a robbery.

After reluctantly taking his father in, Frasier and Martin conduct a series of interviews to hire a physical therapist and caregiver for his father. Martin, much to Frasier&#x27;s dismay, is particularly keen on hiring a British caregiver as a live-in, and after a short squabble, the two agree to hire Daphne Moon (Leeves) for the position. Much of the series focuses on Frasier adjusting to living with his father, with whom he has little in common, and his constant annoyances with Martin&#x27;s dog, Eddie. Frasier frequently spends time with his younger brother, Niles (Pierce), a fellow psychiatrist, who becomes attracted to Daphne and eventually marries her.

Frasier hosts &quot;The Dr. Frasier Crane Show&quot;, a call-in psychiatry show on talk radio station, KACL. Though they share few commonalities, Frasier&#x27;s producer, Roz Doyle (Gilpin) becomes his friend in the series. She is depicted as both direct and sarcastic. Her somewhat superficial relationships with men are a frequent topic of conversation until she becomes pregnant with her daughter, Alice. Roz and Frasier share a professional respect and a wry sense of humor, and over time, the two become close friends. Frasier, along with the other characters in the series, often visits the local coffee shop, Café Nervosa, making it a frequent setting.

The Crane brothers, who have expensive tastes, intellectual interests, and high opinions of themselves, frequently clash with their father, Martin. The close relationship between the brothers is often tense, and their sibling rivalry intermittently results in chaos. For two psychiatrists who make a living solving other people&#x27;s problems, however, they are often inept at dealing with each other&#x27;s hangups. Other recurring themes in the series include Niles&#x27;s relationship with his unseen first wife, Maris (whom he later divorces); Frasier&#x27;s relationship with his ex-wife, Lilith, who resides in Boston with their son, Frederick; Frasier&#x27;s search for love; Martin&#x27;s new life after retirement; and the various attempts by the two brothers to gain acceptance into Seattle high society.

==Characters==
===Main===

* Kelsey Grammer as Frasier Crane, a radio psychiatrist. He is fussy, uptight, cultured, and sometimes arrogant. Having grown up with an educated mother and an &quot;average Joe&quot; father, Frasier epitomizes an upper-class sophistication, yet is still sympathetic to working-class culture. After returning to Seattle, he begins embracing his more privileged background and develops a more selfish and aloof manner, possibly due to rekindling his relationship with his younger brother, Niles Crane. Despite his haughty demeanor, however, Frasier has a strong sense of ethics.
* Jane Leeves as Daphne Moon (later Crane), is an English immigrant from Manchester; a physiotherapist and live-in aid hired by Frasier to help his father. Daphne&#x27;s eccentric, working-class background and self-professed psychic abilities (which often end up being correct) frequently lead to Daphne&#x27;s comical non-sequiturs about her unusual family, which is a sharp contrast to the Cranes&#x27; incredulity. In spite of their different upbringings, Niles falls for her instantly. Niles&#x27;s obsession with Daphne and her obliviousness to this is developed throughout the earlier seasons of the series.
* David Hyde Pierce as Niles Crane, Frasier&#x27;s younger brother. He is a psychiatrist in private practice. Educated, coldhearted, and more arrogant than Frasier, Niles&#x27;s snobby, anxious qualities provide a foil for Frasier&#x27;s own issues. Despite his aforementioned qualities, he is brave, caring, and well-meaning, which, to his loved ones, more than makes up for his eccentricities and quirks. Niles is very close to his older brother, though their fiercely competitive natures often provide the audience with much humor throughout the series. Like Frasier, Niles has a deep appreciation and respect for the arts, music, and pursuits that are seen as intellectual and prefers these activities over most sports, though he excels in squash and croquet. Niles is severely mysophobic, often given to wiping his hands after human contact, and is even depicted wiping down chairs in public places before sitting on them.
* Peri Gilpin as Roz Doyle, the producer of Frasier&#x27;s radio show. A native of Bloomer, Wisconsin, Roz, one of two single women in the series, is depicted as a sharp contrast to Daphne. Throughout the show, Roz&#x27;s search for love and liberal approach to dating is the subject of many witty remarks, particularly from Niles. In the middle of series&#x27; run, Roz becomes pregnant with her first child, Alice, and the show addresses some of the challenges of being a single mother, including Roz having to borrow money from her boss, and the personal and professional strain that places on their relationship.
* John Mahoney as Martin Crane, Frasier and Niles&#x27;s father, is an outspoken and laid-back Seattle police detective who was forced to retire after sustaining a gunshot wound to his hip. Because this injury renders him incapable of living alone, upon Frasier&#x27;s return to Seattle, Martin is forced to accept Frasier&#x27;s invitation to live with him. Though he and his sons share few commonalities, the relationship between the three men strengthens throughout the series. Martin&#x27;s relationship with his Jack Russell terrier, Eddie, and his pea-green tartan- and twill-upholstered recliner are a perpetual source of distress for Frasier. He is also known for his fondness for beer (specifically that for Ballantine).
* Dan Butler as Bob &quot;Bulldog&quot; Briscoe (main seasons 4–6; recurring season 1; special appearance seasons 2–3; special guest seasons 7–11), the womanizing, misogynistic host of &quot;Bob &quot;Bulldog&quot; Briscoe and the Gonzo Sports Show&quot;, which follows Frasier&#x27;s time slot at KACL.

===Recurring===
* Harriet Sansom Harris as Bebe Glazer (seasons 1–5, 7 &amp; 9–11), Frasier&#x27;s flirtatious and duplicitous agent. Described by Niles as &quot;Lady Macbeth without the sincerity&quot;, she will use any method to get her or her clients the best deal.
* Patrick Kerr as Noel Shempsky (seasons 6–11; guest seasons 1 &amp; 3–5), KACL technical assistant and avid &quot;Star Trek&quot; aficionado who speaks fluent Klingon and Spanish (allowing him to keeping his job when the station owner change formats in Season 5) In season one, Roz goes on one date with Noel and he is smitten with her ever since.
* Edward Hibbert as Gil Chesterton (seasons 2–8 &amp; 10–11; guest season 1), KACL&#x27;s posh, camp restaurant critic, his arguably &quot;effeminate&quot; nature is the source of many gay innuendos on the show, despite him revealing early in the series that he is married to a woman who is a car mechanic by trade.
* Marsha Mason as Sherry Dempsey (seasons 4–5), Martin&#x27;s flamboyant girlfriend, whose tastes and opinions are often a cause of antagonism and arguments with the rest of the family.
* Tom McGowan as Kenny Daly (seasons 7–11; guest seasons 5–6), KACL&#x27;s station manager
* Millicent Martin as Gertrude Moon (seasons 9–10; guest seasons 7, 11), Daphne&#x27;s mother
* Brian Klugman as Kirby Gardner (season 9; guest season 8), a part-timer at KACL and the son of Frasier&#x27;s former classmate
* Ashley Thomas as Alice Doyle (seasons 10–11; co-star season 9), Roz&#x27;s daughter
* Felicity Huffman as Julia Wilcox (seasons 10–11), host of a financial news segment, whose personality leads to frequent clashes with others at KACL
* Wendie Malick as Ronee Lawrence (season 11), Frasier and Niles&#x27;s childhood babysitter who, after a chance meeting, becomes Martin&#x27;s girlfriend
* Luke Tarsitano (season 3) and Trevor Einhorn (seasons 4–11) as Frederick Gaylord Crane, Frasier&#x27;s son with ex-wife Lilith

===Notes===
The main cast remained unchanged for all 11 years. When the series ended in 2004, Grammer had portrayed the character of Frasier Crane for a total of 20 years, including his nine seasons on &quot;Cheers&quot; plus a one-time performance as the character on the series &quot;Wings&quot;, which earned Grammer an Emmy nomination. At the time, he tied James Arness&#x27; portrayal of Matt Dillon on &quot;Gunsmoke&quot; for the longest-running character on American primetime television. The record has since been surpassed in animation by the voice cast of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, and in live action by Richard Belzer&#x27;s portrayal of John Munch and Mariska Hargitay&#x27;s portrayal of Olivia Benson (both on &quot;Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit&quot;, among several other series). Grammer was briefly the highest-paid television actor in the United States for his portrayal of Frasier, while Jane Leeves was the highest-paid British actress.

In addition to those of the ensemble, additional story lines included characters from Frasier&#x27;s former incarnation on &quot;Cheers&quot;, such as his ex-wife Lilith Sternin, played by Bebe Neuwirth, and their son, Frederick, played by Trevor Einhorn.

=== Reunions ===
Grammer had been the voice of Sideshow Bob on &quot;The Simpsons&quot; since 1990. In a 1997 episode (while &quot;Frasier&quot; was still in production), the character&#x27;s brother, Cecil Terwilliger, was introduced, played by Pierce, as per the reference in the episode title, &quot;Brother from Another Series&quot;. The episode contained numerous &quot;Frasier&quot; references, including a &quot;Frasier&quot;-style version of &quot;The Simpsons&quot; theme for a transition and its iconic title card for the same thing. Pierce returned as Cecil for the second time (the first since &quot;Frasier&quot; had concluded) alongside Grammer in the 2007 episode &quot;Funeral for a Fiend&quot;. The episode introduced the brothers&#x27; father, Dr. Robert Terwilliger, who was portrayed by Mahoney.

Cast reunions also occurred on four episodes of &quot;Hot in Cleveland&quot;, which featured Leeves in the main cast along with Wendie Malick (who played Martin&#x27;s girlfriend towards the end of &quot;Frasier&quot;). In the season-two episode &quot;Unseparated at Birth&quot; and season-three episode &quot;Funeral Crashers&quot;, Mahoney guest-starred as a waiter smitten with Betty White&#x27;s character. Gilpin appeared in the episode &quot;I Love Lucci (Part 1)&quot;, and Tom McGowan (who played Kenny Daly) appeared in &quot;Love Thy Neighbor&quot; as a casting director. &quot;Hot in Cleveland&quot; was created and produced by Suzanne Martin, who wrote multiple episodes of &quot;Frasier&quot;.

== Production ==
=== Creation ===
During the eighth season of &quot;Cheers&quot;, Grammer made a deal with former &quot;Cheers&quot; producers David Angell, Peter Casey and David Lee (who were moving on to produce &quot;Wings&quot;) that they would do a new series together once &quot;Cheers&quot; ended. Once it became clear during the 10th season that the 11th would be the last, the group began working on their next series together.

Grammer did not originally want to continue playing Frasier Crane, and Angell, Casey and Lee did not want the new show to be compared to &quot;Cheers&quot;, which they had worked on before &quot;Wings&quot;. The three proposed that the actor play a wealthy, Malcolm Forbes-like paraplegic publisher who operated his business from his apartment. The main show featured a &quot;street-smart&quot; Hispanic live-in nurse who would clash with the main character. While Grammer liked the concept, Paramount Television disliked it, and suggested that the best route would be to spin off the Frasier Crane character. Grammer ultimately agreed to star in a &quot;Cheers&quot; spin-off, but the producers set the new show as far from Boston as possible to prevent NBC from demanding that other characters from the old show make guest appearances on the new show during its first season. 

The creators did not want Frasier in private practice, which would make the show resemble &quot;The Bob Newhart Show&quot;. From an unused idea they had for a &quot;Cheers&quot; episode, they conceived the concept of the psychiatrist working in a radio station surrounded by &quot;wacky, yet loveable&quot; characters. After realizing that such a setting was reminiscent of &quot;WKRP in Cincinnati&quot;, the creators decided to emphasize Frasier&#x27;s home life, which &quot;Cheers&quot; had rarely explored. Lee considered his own experience with &quot;the relationship between an aging father and the grown-up son he never understood&quot; and thought it would be a good theme for &quot;Frasier&quot;. Although Frasier had mentioned on &quot;Cheers&quot; (in two episodes) that his father, a research scientist, had died, Angell, Casey and Lee did not realize this was the case, as they were not working on &quot;Cheers&quot; during the season those two episodes were filmed. The creative team was already well into the development process when Grammer pointed out the discontinuity; they decided to overlook it, initially retconning the character&#x27;s backstory. In a second-season episode, the discrepancy was resolved, as Frasier revealed he had lied to the &quot;Cheers&quot; gang about his father.

One element of the original concept that was carried over was the live-in health-care provider for Frasier&#x27;s father. Grammer points out that very little of the Frasier Crane of &quot;Cheers&quot; carried over to &quot;Frasier&quot;, as his family history was changed (though this was later adjusted); the setting, his job and even the character himself changed from the &quot;Cheers&quot; predecessor, having to be more grounded as the central character of the show so the other supporting characters could be more eccentric.

=== Casting ===
Martin Crane was based on creator Casey&#x27;s father, who spent 34 years with the San Francisco Police Department. The creators suggested to NBC that they would like to cast someone like Mahoney, to which NBC told them if they could get Mahoney, they could hire him without auditions. Both Grammer and the producers contacted Mahoney, with the producers flying to Chicago to show Mahoney the pilot script over dinner. Upon reading it, Mahoney accepted. Grammer, who had lost his father as a child, and the childless Mahoney immediately built a close father-son relationship.

In discussing Martin&#x27;s nurse, Warren Littlefield of NBC suggested she be English instead of Hispanic, and suggested Leeves for the role. Grammer was initially reluctant, as he thought the casting made the show resemble &quot;Nanny and the Professor&quot;, but approved Leeves after a meeting and read-through with her. Mahoney and Leeves quickly bonded over their shared English heritage; Mahoney was originally from Manchester, the hometown of Leeves&#x27;s character.

The character of Niles was not part of the original concept for the show. Frasier had told his bar friends on &quot;Cheers&quot; that he was an only child; however, Sheila Guthrie, the assistant casting director on &quot;Wings&quot;, brought the producers a photo of Pierce (whom she knew from his work on &quot;The Powers That Be&quot;) and noted his resemblance to Grammer when he first appeared on &quot;Cheers&quot;. She recommended him should they ever want Frasier to have a brother. The creators were &quot;blown away&quot; both by his resemblance to Grammer and by his acting ability. They decided to ignore Frasier&#x27;s statement on &quot;Cheers&quot; and created the role for Pierce. Pierce accepted the role before realizing he had not read a script. Once he was given a script, he was initially concerned that his character was essentially a duplicate of Frasier, thinking that it would not work. The first table reading of the pilot script was notable because the producers had never heard either Pierce or Mahoney read lines, as they were cast without auditions.

The only main role that required an audition was Roz Doyle, who was named in memory of a producer of &quot;Wings&quot;. The producers auditioned around 300 actresses, with no particular direction in mind. Women of all ethnicities were considered. Lisa Kudrow was originally cast in the role, but during rehearsals, the producers decided they needed someone who could appear more assertive in her job and take control over Frasier at KACL, and Kudrow did not fit that role. The creators quickly hired Gilpin, their second choice.

The original focus of the series was intended to be the relationship between Frasier and Martin, and it was the focus of most of the first-season episodes. Once the show began airing, Niles became a breakout character, and more focus was added to the brothers&#x27; relationship, and other plots centering on Niles, starting in the second season. The producers initially did not want to make Niles&#x27;s wife Maris an unseen character because they did not want to draw parallels to Vera, Norm&#x27;s wife on &quot;Cheers&quot;. They originally intended that she would appear after several episodes, but were enjoying writing excuses for her absence so much that they eventually decided she would remain unseen, and after the increasingly eccentric characteristics ascribed to her, they concluded that no real actress would be able to portray her anyway.

=== Sets and settings ===

Frasier&#x27;s apartment was designed to be ultra-modern in an eclectic style (as Frasier himself points out in the pilot). One of the show&#x27;s signature elements that it became well known for was the apartment&#x27;s design which included elements such as a slightly split-level design, doors with triangular wooden inlay features, numerous pieces of well-known high-end furniture (such as a replica of Coco Chanel&#x27;s sofa, and both an Eames Lounge Chair and a Wassily Chair) and a notable view from the terrace which was frequently complimented by visitors. The main set consisted of the open-concept living area with a sitting/TV space and dining area on the lower level and a piano exit to the terrace on the rear upper level. The set also included the kitchen through an open archway. A small section of the building corridor and elevator doors was built, as was a powder room near the front entrance. Two corridors off the living area ostensibly led to the apartment&#x27;s three bedrooms. Sets for each of these rooms were built as separate sets on an as-needed basis.

No building or apartment in Seattle really has the view from Frasier&#x27;s residence. It was created so the Space Needle, the most iconic landmark of Seattle, would appear more prominently. According to the season-one DVD bonus features, the photograph used on the set was taken from atop a cliff, possibly the ledge at Kerry Park, a frequent photography location. Despite this, &quot;Frasier&quot; has been said to have contributed to the emergence of an upscale urban lifestyle in 1990s Seattle, with buyers seeking properties in locations resembling that depicted in the show, in search of &quot;that cosmopolitan feel of Frasier&quot;.

Another of the primary sets was the radio studio at KACL from which Frasier broadcasts his show. The studio itself consists of two rooms: the broadcast booth and the control room. A section of the corridor outside of the booth was also built (visible through the windows at the back of the studio) and could be shot from the side to view the corridor itself. The set was designed based on ABC&#x27;s then-brand-new radio studios in Los Angeles which the production designer visited. Technical elements such as the microphones were regularly updated to conform with the latest technology. Although the studio set lacked a &quot;front&quot; wall (the fourth wall), one was built for occasional use in episodes with certain moments shot from behind the broadcast desk, rather than in front of it as usual.

The producers wanted to have a gathering place outside of home and work where the characters could meet. After a trip to Seattle, and seeing the many burgeoning coffee shops, the production designer suggested to producers that they use a coffee shop. Unlike many of the relatively modern coffee shop designs prevalent in Seattle, the production designer opted for a more warm and inviting style that would appear more established and traditional. Stools were specifically omitted to avoid any similarity to the bar on &quot;Cheers&quot;. Several Los Angeles coffee shops were used for reference. A bookcase was added on the back wall, suggesting patrons could grab a book and read while they enjoyed their coffee. The show used three versions of the interior set depending on how much space other sets for each episode required. If space for the full set was not available, a smaller version that omitted the tables closest to the audience could be used. If space for that set was lacking, a small section of the back of the cafe at the top of the steps could be set up under the audience bleachers. A set was also used on occasion for the exterior patio.

=== Filming ===
The cast had an unusual amount of freedom to suggest changes to the script. Grammer used an acting method he called &quot;requisite disrespect&quot; and did not rehearse with the others, instead learning and rehearsing his lines once just before filming each scene in front of a live studio audience. Although effective, the system often caused panic among guest stars.

In 1996, Grammer&#x27;s recurrent alcoholism led to a car accident. The cast and crew performed an intervention that persuaded him to enter the Betty Ford Center, delaying production for a month.

Only one episode, &quot;The 1000th Show&quot;, was filmed in Seattle. As with &quot;Cheers&quot;, most episodes were filmed on Stage 25, Paramount Studios, or at various locations in and around Los Angeles.

Filming was briefly disrupted by the September 11 attacks, during which David Angell was killed on board American Airlines Flight 11 while returning to California along with his wife Lynn. The cast and crew were devastated by their deaths, but Kelsey Grammer was concerned about the public perception of their grief in the context of a national tragedy, and so they did not extensively discuss Angell in the news after the attacks. Peri Gilpin later recalled that, after they had consistently avoided discussing the subject for awhile, the cast sat down on the set of Frasier&#x27;s apartment and talked about their memories of the Angells for several hours, after which she felt significantly better.

=== Celebrity voice cameos ===

The KACL callers&#x27; lines were read by anonymous voice-over actors during filming in front of a live audience, and during post-production, the lines were replaced by celebrities, who actually phoned in their parts without having to come into the studio. The end credits of season finales show greyscale headshots of celebrities who had &quot;called in&quot; that season. Celebrities providing voices as callers include Gillian Anderson, Kevin Bacon, Halle Berry, Benjamin Bratt, Mel Brooks, Cindy Crawford, Billy Crystal, Phil Donahue, David Duchovny, Hilary Duff, Olympia Dukakis, Carrie Fisher, Jodie Foster, Art Garfunkel, Macaulay Culkin, Elijah Wood, Linda Hamilton, Daryl Hannah, Ron Howard, Eric Idle, Stephen King, Jay Leno, Laura Linney, John Lithgow, Yo-Yo Ma, William H. Macy, Henry Mancini, Reba McEntire, Helen Mirren, Mary Tyler Moore, Estelle Parsons, Rosie Perez, Freddie Prinze Jr., Christopher Reeve, Carly Simon, Gary Sinise, Mary Steenburgen, Ben Stiller, Marlo Thomas, Rob Reiner, Carl Reiner, Lily Tomlin, and Eddie Van Halen.

Some &quot;callers&quot; also guest-starred, such as Parsons, Perez and Linney (who played Frasier&#x27;s final love interest in the last season).

=== Credits ===
The show&#x27;s theme song, &quot;Tossed Salads and Scrambled Eggs&quot;, is sung by Grammer and is played over the closing credits of each episode. Composer Bruce Miller, who had also composed for &quot;Wings&quot;, was asked to avoid explicitly mentioning any subjects related to the show such as radio or psychiatry. After Miller finished the music, lyricist Darryl Phinnesse suggested the title as they were things that were, like Frasier Crane&#x27;s patients, &quot;mixed up&quot;. The lyrics indirectly refer to Crane&#x27;s radio show; &quot;I hear the blues a-callin&#x27;,&quot; for example, refers to troubled listeners who call the show. Grammer recorded several variations of the final spoken line of the theme, which were rotated for each of the episodes. Other than season finales, a short, silent scene, often revisiting a small subplot aside from the central story of the episode, appears with the credits and song, which the actors performed without written dialogue based on the scriptwriter&#x27;s suggestion.

The title card at the start of each episode shows a white line being drawn in the shape of the Seattle skyline on a black background above the show&#x27;s title. In most episodes, once the skyline and title appear, the skyline is augmented in some way, such as windows lighting up or a helicopter lifting off. The color of the title text changed for each season (respectively: blue, red, turquoise, purple, gold, brown, yellow, green, orange, metallic silver, and metallic gold). Over the title card, one of about 25 brief musical cues evoking the closing theme is played.

=== Revival ===

On February 24, 2021, a revival series was greenlit for exclusive debut on Paramount+. The series premiered on October 12, 2023. Described as a &quot;third act&quot; and another spin-off, Grammer said he &quot;gleefully&quot; anticipated &quot;sharing the next chapter in the continuing journey of Dr. Frasier Crane&quot; as he had &quot;spent over 20 years&quot; of his &quot;creative life on the Paramount lot&quot;. In October 2022, Paramount+ officially gave the series a season order of 10 episodes. In January 2023, Jack Cutmore-Scott joined the cast as Freddy Crane. It was also reported that English actor Nicholas Lyndhurst would be joining the cast. Anders Keith and Jess Salgueiro were later cast as Niles and Daphne&#x27;s son and Freddy&#x27;s roommate, respectively. In February, Toks Olagundoye was cast as Olivia.

== Relationship to &quot;Cheers&quot; ==
With the exception of Rebecca Howe (Kirstie Alley), all the surviving main regular cast members of &quot;Cheers&quot; made appearances on &quot;Frasier&quot;. Lilith Sternin (Bebe Neuwirth) was the only one to become a recurring character, appearing in a total of twelve episodes.

In the eighth-season &quot;Cheers&quot; episode &quot;Two Girls for Every Boyd,&quot; Frasier tells Sam Malone (played by Ted Danson) that his father, a research scientist, had died. In the &quot;Frasier&quot; season-two episode &quot;The Show Where Sam Shows Up,&quot; when Sam meets Martin, Frasier explains that at the time, he was angry after an argument with his father on the phone; however, in &quot;The Show Where Woody Shows Up,&quot; when meeting Martin, Woody says he remembers hearing about him.

In the ninth-season episode of &quot;Frasier&quot;, 2002&#x27;s &quot;Cheerful Goodbyes&quot;, Frasier returns to Boston to give a speech, and Niles, Daphne, and Martin come along to see the city. Frasier runs into Cliff Clavin (played by John Ratzenberger) at the airport and learns that Cliff is retiring and moving to Florida. Frasier and company attend Cliff&#x27;s retirement party, where Frasier reunites with the rest of the gang from &quot;Cheers&quot; (minus Sam, Woody, Diane and Rebecca), including bar regular Norm Peterson (played by George Wendt), waitress Carla Tortelli (played by Rhea Perlman), barflies Paul Krapence (played by Paul Willson) and Phil (played by Philip Perlman), and Cliff&#x27;s old post-office nemesis Walt Twitchell (played by Raye Birk).

In the 11th-season episode of &quot;Frasier&quot;, &quot;Caught in the Act,&quot; Frasier&#x27;s married ex-wife, children&#x27;s entertainer Nanny G, comes to town and invites him backstage for a rendezvous. Nanny G appeared on the &quot;Cheers&quot; episode &quot;One Hugs, The Other Doesn&#x27;t&quot; (1992) and was portrayed by Emma Thompson. In this episode of &quot;Frasier&quot;, she is portrayed by Laurie Metcalf. A younger version of the character (this time played by Dina Waters) appears in the second episode of season 9 of &quot;Frasier&quot;, &quot;Don Juan in Hell: Part 2,&quot; along with Neuwirth and Shelley Long reprising their roles of Lilith and Diane Chambers, respectively. In this episode, Rita Wilson also reprises her role as Frasier&#x27;s mother, Hester, which she briefly debuted in the season 7 premiere, &quot;Momma Mia;&quot; in &quot;Don Juan in Hell: Part 2,&quot; Diane also references the season 3 episode of &quot;Cheers&quot;, &quot;Diane Meets Mom,&quot; in which Hester (then portrayed by Nancy Marchand) threatens Diane&#x27;s life. Diane (again portrayed by Long) plays a central role in &quot;The Show Where Diane Comes Back&quot; (season 3, episode 14) and had a brief cameo in the season 2 episode &quot;Adventures in Paradise: Part 2&quot;.

Some cast members of &quot;Frasier&quot; had appeared previously in minor roles on &quot;Cheers&quot;. In the episode &quot;Do Not Forsake Me, O&#x27; My Postman&quot; (1992), John Mahoney played Sy Flembeck, an over-the-hill jingle writer hired by Rebecca to write a jingle for the bar. In it, Grammer and Mahoney exchanged a few lines. Peri Gilpin appeared in a &quot;Cheers&quot; episode titled &quot;Woody Gets an Election&quot; playing a reporter who interviews Woody when he runs for office.

The set of &quot;Frasier&quot; was built over the set of &quot;Cheers&quot; on the same stage after it had finished filming.

== Reception ==
=== Critical reaction ===
&quot;Frasier&quot; is one of the most critically acclaimed comedy series of all time and one of the most successful spin-off series in television history. Critics and commentators have broadly held the show in high regard.

Caroline Frost said that the series overall showed a high level of wit but noted that many critics felt that the marriage of Daphne and Niles in season ten had removed much of the show&#x27;s comic tension. Ken Tucker felt that their marriage made the series seem desperate for storylines, while Robert Bianco felt that it was symptomatic of a show that had begun to dip in quality after so much time on the air. Kelsey Grammer acknowledged the creative lull, saying that over the course of two later seasons, the show &quot;took itself too seriously&quot;. Commentators acknowledged that there was an improvement following the return of the writers Christopher Lloyd and Joe Keenan, although not necessarily to its earlier high standards.

Writing about the first season, John O&#x27;Connor described &quot;Frasier&quot; as being a relatively unoriginal concept, but said that it was generally a &quot;splendid act,&quot; while Tucker thought that the second season benefited greatly from a mix of &quot;high and low humor&quot;. Tucker&#x27;s comment is referring to what Grammer described as a rule of the series that the show should not play down to its audience. Kevin Cherry believes that &quot;Frasier&quot; was able to stay fresh by not making any contemporary commentary, therefore allowing the show to be politically and socially neutral. Other commentators, such as Haydn Bush disagree, believing the success of &quot;Frasier&quot; can be attributed to the comedic timing and the rapport between the characters. Joseph J. Darowski and Kate Darowski praise the overall message of the series, which across eleven seasons sees several lonely, broken individuals develop warm, caring relationships. While individual episodes vary in quality, the series as a whole carries with it a definitive theme and evolution from pilot to finale. &quot;The Economist&quot; devoted an article to the 25th anniversary of the show&#x27;s premiere stating, &quot;it is clear that audiences still demand the sort of intelligent and heartfelt comedy that &quot;Frasier&quot; provided.&quot;

Despite the criticisms of the later seasons, these critics were unanimous in praising at least the early seasons, with varied commentary on the series&#x27; demise ranging from believing, like Bianco, that the show had run its course to those like Dana Stevens, who bemoaned the end of &quot;Frasier&quot; as the &quot;end of situation comedy for adults&quot;. Critics compared the farcical elements of the series, especially in later seasons, to the older sitcom &quot;Three&#x27;s Company&quot;. NBC News contributor Wendell Wittler described the moments of misunderstanding as &quot;inspired by the classic comedy of manners as were the frequent deflations of Frasier’s pomposity&quot;.

In 2017, 13 years after the show ended, &quot;Frasier&quot; was said to have experienced a &quot;renaissance&quot; on Netflix and &quot;achieved a second life as one of the streaming service&#x27;s most soothing offerings&quot;.

=== Awards ===
The series won a total of 37 Primetime Emmy Awards during its 11-year run, breaking the record long held by CBS&#x27; &quot;The Mary Tyler Moore Show&quot; (29). It held the record until 2016 when &quot;Game of Thrones&quot; won 38. Grammer and Pierce each won four, including one each for the fifth and eleventh seasons. The series is tied with ABC&#x27;s &quot;Modern Family&quot; for the most consecutive wins for Outstanding Comedy Series, winning five from 1994 to 1998.

Grammer has been Emmy-nominated for playing Frasier Crane on &quot;Cheers&quot; and &quot;Frasier&quot;, as well as a 1992 crossover appearance on &quot;Wings&quot;, making him the only performer to be nominated for playing the same role on three different shows. The first year Grammer did not receive an Emmy nomination for &quot;Frasier&quot; was in 2003 for the 10th season. However, Pierce was nominated every year of the show&#x27;s run, breaking the record for nominations in his category, with his eighth nomination in 2001; he was nominated a further three times after this.

In 1994, the episode &quot;The Matchmaker&quot; was ranked number 43 on &quot;TV Guide&quot;″s 100 Greatest Episodes of All Time. In 2000, the series was named the greatest international programme of all time by a panel of 1,600 industry experts for the British Film Institute as part of BFI TV 100. In 2002, &quot;Frasier&quot; was ranked number 34 on &quot;TV Guide&quot;″s 50 Greatest TV Shows of All Time. In a 2006 poll taken by Channel 4 of professionals in the sitcom industry, &quot;Frasier&quot; was voted the best sitcom of all time. In 2013, the Writers Guild of America ranked it #23 on their list of the 101 Best Written TV Series.

=== Fanbase and cultural impact ===
&quot;Frasier&quot; began airing in off-network syndication in March 2006. It is available on Cozi TV, Hallmark Channel, Amazon Prime Video, Hulu, Paramount+, Showtime, SkyShowtime, Peacock, Pluto TV and Crave in select countries. Netflix stopped offering the show in 2020.

The show&#x27;s popularity has resulted in several fan sites, podcasts, and publications. Podcasts that look primarily at the show include &quot;Talk Salad and Scrambled Eggs&quot; with Kevin Smith and Matt Mira and &quot;Frasierphiles.&quot;

A soundtrack to the series was released in 2001.

<text>Fantasy Games Unlimited (FGU) is a publishing house for tabletop and role-playing games. The company has no in-house design teams and relies on submitted material from outside talent.

==History==
Founded in the summer of 1975 in Jericho, New York by Scott Bizar, the company&#x27;s first publications were the wargames &quot;Gladiators&quot; and &quot;Royal Armies of the Hyborean Age&quot;. Upon the appearance and popularity of &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; from TSR, the company turned its attentions to role-playing games, seeking and producing systems from amateurs and freelancers, paying them 10% of the gross receipts. FGU also copyrighted their games in the name of the designer so that the designer would receive any additional royalties for licensed figurines and other uses. Rather than focusing on one line and supporting it with supplements, FGU produced a stream of new games. Because of the disparate authors, the rules systems were incompatible. FGU Incorporated published dozens of role-playing games.

Fantasy Games Unlimited won the All Time Best Ancient Medieval Rules for 1979 H.G. Wells Award at Origins 1980 for &quot;Chivalry &amp; Sorcery&quot;.

In 1991, Fantasy Games Unlimited Inc. was dissolved as a New York corporation. Bizar continues to publish in Arizona as a sole proprietorship called Fantasy Games Unlimited.

A new FGU website appeared in July 2006 offering the company&#x27;s back catalog. It said that new products would be &quot;coming soon&quot;. New &quot;Aftermath!&quot; products appeared in 2008. By 2010, much of the company&#x27;s back catalog was available. At that time, FGU sought submissions for new adventures for their existing titles, primarily &quot;Aftermath!, Space Opera, and Villains and Vigilantes&quot;.

<doc id="11691" wikidata="Q5215396" url="?curid=11691" title="Functional decomposition">
<text>In engineering, functional decomposition is the process of resolving a functional relationship into its constituent parts in such a way that the original function can be reconstructed (i.e., recomposed) from those parts.

This process of decomposition may be undertaken to gain insight into the identity of the constituent components, which may reflect individual physical processes of interest. Also, functional decomposition may result in a compressed representation of the global function, a task which is feasible only when the constituent processes possess a certain level of &quot;modularity&quot; (i.e., independence or non-interaction).

Interaction (statistics) between the components are critical to the function of the collection. All interactions may not be , but possibly deduced through repetitive , synthesis, validation and verification of composite behavior.

==Motivation for decomposition==

Decomposition of a function into non-interacting components generally permits more economical representations of the function. Intuitively, this reduction in representation size is achieved simply because each variable depends only on a subset of the other variables. Thus, variable formula_1 only depends directly on variable formula_2, rather than depending on the &quot;entire set&quot; of variables. We would say that variable formula_2 &quot;screens off&quot; variable formula_1 from the rest of the world. Practical examples of this phenomenon surround us. 

Consider the particular case of &quot;northbound traffic on the West Side Highway.&quot; Let us assume this variable (formula_5) takes on three possible values of {&quot;moving slow&quot;, &quot;moving deadly slow&quot;, &quot;not moving at all&quot;}. Now, let&#x27;s say the variable formula_5 depends on two other variables, &quot;weather&quot; with values of {&quot;sun&quot;, &quot;rain&quot;, &quot;snow&quot;}, and &quot;GW Bridge traffic&quot; with values {&quot;10mph&quot;, &quot;5mph&quot;, &quot;1mph&quot;}. The point here is that while there are certainly many secondary variables that affect the weather variable (e.g., low pressure system over Canada, butterfly flapping in Japan, etc.) and the Bridge traffic variable (e.g., an accident on I-95, presidential motorcade, etc.) all these other secondary variables are not directly relevant to the West Side Highway traffic. All we need (hypothetically) in order to predict the West Side Highway traffic is the weather and the GW Bridge traffic, because these two variables &quot;screen off&quot; West Side Highway traffic from all other potential influences. That is, all other influences act &quot;through&quot; them.

==Applications==
Practical applications of functional decomposition are found in Bayesian networks, structural equation modeling, linear systems, and database systems.

== Knowledge representation ==
Processes related to functional decomposition are prevalent throughout the fields of knowledge representation and machine learning. Hierarchical model induction techniques such as Logic circuit minimization, decision trees, grammatical inference, hierarchical clustering, and quadtree decomposition are all examples of function decomposition.

Many statistical inference methods can be thought of as implementing a function decomposition process in the presence of noise; that is, where functional dependencies are only expected to hold &quot;approximately&quot;. Among such models are mixture models and the recently popular methods referred to as &quot;causal decompositions&quot; or Bayesian networks.

== Database theory ==
See database normalization.

== Machine learning ==
In practical scientific applications, it is almost never possible to achieve perfect functional decomposition because of the incredible complexity of the systems under study. This complexity is manifested in the presence of &quot;noise,&quot; which is just a designation for all the unwanted and untraceable influences on our observations.

However, while perfect functional decomposition is usually impossible, the spirit lives on in a large number of statistical methods that are equipped to deal with noisy systems. When a natural or artificial system is intrinsically hierarchical, the joint distribution on system variables should provide evidence of this hierarchical structure. The task of an observer who seeks to understand the system is then to infer the hierarchical structure from observations of these variables. This is the notion behind the hierarchical decomposition of a joint distribution, the attempt to recover something of the intrinsic hierarchical structure which generated that joint distribution.

As an example, Bayesian network methods attempt to decompose a joint distribution along its causal fault lines, thus &quot;cutting nature at its seams&quot;. The essential motivation behind these methods is again that within most systems (natural or artificial), relatively few components/events interact with one another directly on equal footing. Rather, one observes pockets of dense connections (direct interactions) among small subsets of components, but only loose connections between these densely connected subsets. There is thus a notion of &quot;causal proximity&quot; in physical systems under which variables naturally precipitate into small clusters. Identifying these clusters and using them to represent the joint provides the basis for great efficiency of storage (relative to the full joint distribution) as well as for potent inference algorithms.

== Software architecture ==

Functional Decomposition is a design method intending to produce a non-implementation, architectural description of a computer program. The software architect first establishes a series of functions and types that accomplishes the main processing problem of the computer program, decomposes each to reveal common functions and types, and finally derives Modules from this activity.

== Signal processing ==
Functional decomposition is used in the analysis of many signal processing systems, such as LTI systems. The input signal to an LTI system can be expressed as a function, formula_7. Then formula_7 can be decomposed into a linear combination of other functions, called component signals:
::formula_9
Here, formula_10 are the component signals. Note that formula_11 are constants. This decomposition aids in analysis, because now the output of the system can be expressed in terms of the components of the input. If we let formula_12 represent the effect of the system, then the output signal is formula_13, which can be expressed as:
::formula_14
::formula_15
In other words, the system can be seen as acting separately on each of the components of the input signal. Commonly used examples of this type of decomposition are the Fourier series and the Fourier transform.

== Systems engineering ==

Functional decomposition in systems engineering refers to the process of defining a system in functional terms, then defining lower-level functions and sequencing relationships from these higher level systems functions. The basic idea is to try to divide a system in such a way that each block of a block diagram can be described without an &quot;and&quot; or &quot;or&quot; in the description.

This exercise forces each part of the system to have a pure function. When a system is designed as pure functions, they can be reused, or replaced. A usual side effect is that the interfaces between blocks become simple and generic. Since the interfaces usually become simple, it is easier to replace a pure function with a related, similar function.

For example, say that one needs to make a stereo system. One might functionally decompose this into speakers, amplifier, a tape deck and a front panel. Later, when a different model needs an audio CD, it can probably fit the same interfaces.

<text>Franz Uri Boas (July 9, 1858 – December 21, 1942) was a German-American anthropologist and ethnomusicologist. He was a pioneer of modern anthropology who has been called the &quot;Father of American Anthropology&quot;. His work is associated with the movements known as historical particularism and cultural relativism.

Studying in Germany, Boas was awarded a doctorate in 1881 in physics while also studying geography. He then participated in a geographical expedition to northern Canada, where he became fascinated with the culture and language of the Baffin Island Inuit. He went on to do field work with the indigenous cultures and languages of the Pacific Northwest. In 1887 he emigrated to the United States, where he first worked as a museum curator at the Smithsonian, and in 1899 became a professor of anthropology at Columbia University, where he remained for the rest of his career. Through his students, many of whom went on to found anthropology departments and research programmes inspired by their mentor, Boas profoundly influenced the development of American anthropology. Among his many significant students were A. L. Kroeber, Alexander Goldenweiser, Ruth Benedict, Edward Sapir, Margaret Mead, Zora Neale Hurston, and Gilberto Freyre.

Boas was one of the most prominent opponents of the then-popular ideologies of scientific racism, the idea that race is a biological concept and that human behavior is best understood through the typology of biological characteristics. In a series of groundbreaking studies of skeletal anatomy, he showed that cranial shape and size was highly malleable depending on environmental factors such as health and nutrition, in contrast to the claims by racial anthropologists of the day that held head shape to be a stable racial trait. Boas also worked to demonstrate that differences in human behavior are not primarily determined by innate biological dispositions but are largely the result of cultural differences acquired through social learning. In this way, Boas introduced culture as the primary concept for describing differences in behavior between human groups, and as the central analytical concept of anthropology.

Among Boas&#x27;s main contributions to anthropological thought was his rejection of the then-popular evolutionary approaches to the study of culture, which saw all societies progressing through a set of hierarchic technological and cultural stages, with Western European culture at the summit. Boas argued that culture developed historically through the interactions of groups of people and the diffusion of ideas and that consequently there was no process towards continuously &quot;higher&quot; cultural forms. This insight led Boas to reject the &quot;stage&quot;-based organization of ethnological museums, instead preferring to order items on display based on the affinity and proximity of the cultural groups in question.

Boas introduced the idea of cultural relativism, which holds that cultures cannot be objectively ranked as higher or lower, or better or more correct, but that all humans see the world through the lens of their own culture, and judge it according to their own culturally acquired norms. For Boas, the object of anthropology was to understand the way in which culture conditioned people to understand and interact with the world in different ways and to do this it was necessary to gain an understanding of the language and cultural practices of the people studied. By uniting the disciplines of archaeology, the study of material culture and history, and physical anthropology, the study of variation in human anatomy, with ethnology, the study of cultural variation of customs, and descriptive linguistics, the study of unwritten indigenous languages, Boas created the four-field subdivision of anthropology which became prominent in American anthropology in the 20th century.

== Early life and education ==

Franz Boas was born on July 9, 1858, in Minden, Westphalia, the son of Sophie Meyer and Feibes Uri Boas. Although his grandparents were observant Jews, his parents embraced Enlightenment values, including their assimilation into modern German society. Boas&#x27;s parents were liberal; they did not like dogma of any kind. An important early influence was the avuncular Abraham Jacobi, his mother&#x27;s brother-in-law and a friend of Karl Marx, who was to advise him throughout Boas&#x27;s career. Early in life, he displayed a penchant for both nature and natural sciences. Boas vocally opposed and refused to convert to Christianity, but he did not identify himself as a religious Jew. This is disputed however by Ruth Bunzel, a protégée of Boas, who called him &quot;the essential protestant; he valued autonomy above all things.&quot; According to his biographer, &quot;He was a jewish German, preserving and promoting German culture and values in America.&quot; In an autobiographical sketch, Boas wrote:

The background of my early thinking was a German home in which the ideals of the revolution of 1848 were a living force. My father, liberal, but not active in public affairs; my mother, idealistic, with a lively interest in public matters; the founder about 1854 of the kindergarten in my hometown, devoted to science. My parents had broken through the shackles of dogma. My father had retained an emotional affection for the ceremonial of his parental home, without allowing it to influence his intellectual freedom.

From kindergarten on, Boas was educated in natural history, a subject he enjoyed. In gymnasium, he was most proud of his research on the geographic distribution of plants.
When he started his university studies, Boas first attended Heidelberg University for a semester followed by four terms at Bonn University, studying physics, geography, and mathematics at these schools. In 1879, he hoped to transfer to Berlin University to study physics under Hermann von Helmholtz, but ended up transferring to the University of Kiel instead due to family reasons. At Kiel, Boas had wanted to focus on the mathematical topic of C.F. Gauss&#x27;s law of the normal distribution of errors for his dissertation, but he ultimately had to settle for a topic chosen for him by his doctoral advisor, physicist Gustav Karsten, on the optical properties of water. Boas completed his dissertation entitled &quot;Contributions to the Perception of the Color of Water,&quot; which examined the absorption, reflection, and polarization of light in water, and was awarded a PhD in physics in 1881.

While at Bonn, Boas had attended geography classes taught by the geographer Theobald Fischer and the two established a friendship, with the coursework and friendship continuing after both relocated to Kiel at the same time. Fischer, a student of Carl Ritter, rekindled Boas&#x27;s interest in geography and ultimately had more influence on him than did Karsten, and thus some biographers view Boas as more of a geographer than a physicist at this stage. In addition to the major in physics, Adams, citing Kroeber, states that &quot;[i]n accordance with German tradition at the time... he also had to defend six minor theses&quot;, and Boas likely completed a minor in geography, which would explain why Fischer was one of Boas&#x27;s degree examiners. Because of this close relationship between Fischer and Boas, some biographers have gone so far as to incorrectly state that Boas &quot;followed&quot; Fischer to Kiel, and that Boas received a PhD in geography with Fischer as his doctoral advisor. For his part, Boas self-identified as a geographer by the time he completed his doctorate, prompting his sister, Toni, to write in 1883, &quot;After long years of infidelity, my brother was re-conquered by geography, the first love of his boyhood.&quot;

In his dissertation research, Boas&#x27;s methodology included investigating how different intensities of light created different colors when interacting with different types of water; however, he encountered difficulty in being able to objectively perceive slight differences in the color of water, and as a result became intrigued by this problem of perception and its influence on quantitative measurements. Boas, due to tone deafness, would later encounter difficulties also in studying tonal languages such as Laguna. Boas had already been interested in Kantian philosophy since taking a course on aesthetics with Kuno Fischer at Heidelberg. These factors led Boas to consider pursuing research in psychophysics, which explores the relationship between the psychological and the physical, after completing his doctorate, but he had no training in psychology. Boas did publish six articles on psychophysics during his year of military service (1882–1883), but ultimately he decided to focus on geography, primarily so he could receive sponsorship for his planned Baffin Island expedition.

==Post-graduate studies==
Boas took up geography as a way to explore his growing interest in the relationship between subjective experience and the objective world. At the time, German geographers were divided over the causes of cultural variation. Many argued that the physical environment was the principal determining factor, but others (notably Friedrich Ratzel) argued that the diffusion of ideas through human migration is more important. In 1883, encouraged by Theobald Fischer, Boas went to Baffin Island to conduct geographic research on the impact of the physical environment on native Inuit migrations. The first of many ethnographic field trips, Boas culled his notes to write his first monograph titled &quot;The Central Eskimo&quot;, which was published in 1888 in the 6th Annual Report from the Bureau of American Ethnology. Boas lived and worked closely with the Inuit on Baffin Island, and he developed an abiding interest in the way people lived.

In the perpetual darkness of the Arctic winter, Boas reported, he and his traveling companion became lost and were forced to keep sledding for twenty-six hours through ice, soft snow, and temperatures that dropped below −46 °C. The following day, Boas penciled in his diary,

Boas went on to explain in the same entry that &quot;all service, therefore, which a man can perform for humanity must serve to promote truth.&quot; Before his departure, his father had insisted he be accompanied by one of the family&#x27;s servants, Wilhelm Weike who cooked for him and kept a journal of the expedition. Boas was nonetheless forced to depend on various Inuit groups for everything from directions and food to shelter and companionship. It was a difficult year filled with tremendous hardships that included frequent bouts of disease, mistrust, pestilence, and danger. Boas successfully searched for areas not yet surveyed and found unique ethnographic objects, but the long winter and the lonely treks across perilous terrain forced him to search his soul to find a direction for his life as a scientist and a citizen.

Boas returned to Berlin to complete his studies. His interest in indigenous communities grew as he worked at the Royal Ethnological Museum in Berlin, where he was introduced to members of the Nuxalk Nation of British Columbia, which sparked a lifelong relationship with the First Nations of the Pacific Northwest. Simultaneously, he became studied the methodologies of ethnomusicologists Carl Stumpf, Erich von Hornbostel, and George Herzog; practices he would later utilize in his own work in ethnomusicology.

In 1886, Boas defended (with Helmholtz&#x27;s support) his habilitation thesis, &quot;Baffin Land&quot;, and was named in geography.

While on Baffin Island he began to develop his interest in studying non-Western cultures (resulting in his book, &quot;The Central Eskimo&quot;, published in 1888). In 1885, he went to work with physical anthropologist Rudolf Virchow and ethnologist Adolf Bastian at the Royal Ethnological Museum in Berlin. Boas had studied anatomy with Virchow two years earlier while preparing for the Baffin Island expedition. At the time, Virchow was involved in a vociferous debate over evolution with his former student, Ernst Haeckel. Haeckel had abandoned his medical practice to study comparative anatomy after reading Charles Darwin&#x27;s &quot;The Origin of Species&quot;, and vigorously promoted Darwin&#x27;s ideas in Germany. However, like most other natural scientists prior to the rediscovery of Mendelian genetics in 1900 and the development of the modern synthesis, Virchow felt that Darwin&#x27;s theories were weak because they lacked a theory of cellular mutability. Accordingly, Virchow favored Lamarckian models of evolution. This debate resonated with debates among geographers. Lamarckians believed that environmental forces could precipitate rapid and enduring changes in organisms that had no inherited source; thus, Lamarckians and environmental determinists often found themselves on the same side of debates.

But Boas worked more closely with Bastian, who was noted for his antipathy to environmental determinism. Instead, he argued for the &quot;psychic unity of mankind&quot;, a belief that all humans had the same intellectual capacity, and that all cultures were based on the same basic mental principles. Variations in custom and belief, he argued, were the products of historical accidents. This view resonated with Boas&#x27;s experiences on Baffin Island and drew him towards anthropology.

While at the Royal Ethnological Museum Boas became interested in the Native Americans in the Pacific Northwest, and after defending his habilitation thesis, he left for a three-month trip to British Columbia via New York. In January 1887, he was offered a job as assistant editor of the journal &quot;Science&quot;. Alienated by growing antisemitism and nationalism as well as the very limited academic opportunities for a geographer in Germany, Boas decided to stay in the United States. Possibly he received additional motivation for this decision from his romance with Marie Krackowizer, whom he married in the same year. With a family underway and under financial stress, Boas also resorted to pilfering bones and skulls from native burial sites to sell to museums.

Aside from his editorial work at &quot;Science&quot;, Boas secured an appointment as &quot;docent&quot; in anthropology at Clark University, in 1888. Boas was concerned about university president G. Stanley Hall&#x27;s interference in his research, yet in 1889 he was appointed as the head of a newly created department of anthropology at Clark University. In the early 1890s, he went on a series of expeditions which were referred to as the Morris K. Jesup Expedition. The primary goal of these expeditions was to illuminate Asiatic-American relations. In 1892 Boas, along with another member of the Clark faculty, resigned in protest of the alleged infringement by Hall on academic freedom.

==World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition==

Anthropologist Frederic Ward Putnam, director and curator of the Peabody Museum at Harvard University, who had been appointed as head of the Department of Ethnology and Archeology for the Chicago Fair in 1892, chose Boas as his first assistant at Chicago to prepare for the 1893 World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition or Chicago World&#x27;s Fair, the 400th anniversary of Christopher Columbus&#x27;s arrival in the Americas. Boas had a chance to apply his approach to exhibits. Boas directed a team of about one hundred assistants, mandated to create anthropology and ethnology exhibits on the Indians of North America and South America that were living at the time Christopher Columbus arrived in America while searching for India. Putnam intended the World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition to be a celebration of Columbus&#x27; voyage. Putnam argued that showing late nineteenth century Inuit and First Nations (then called Eskimo and Indians) &quot;in their natural conditions of life&quot; would provide a contrast and celebrate the four centuries of Western accomplishments since 1493.

Franz Boas traveled north to gather ethnographic material for the Exposition. Boas had intended public science in creating exhibitions for the Exposition where visitors to the Midway could learn about other cultures. Boas arranged for fourteen Kwakwaka&#x27;wakw aboriginals from British Columbia to come and reside in a mock Kwakwaka&#x27;wakw village, where they could perform their daily tasks in context. Inuit were there with 12-foot-long whips made of sealskin, wearing sealskin clothing and showing how adept they were in sealskin kayaks. His experience with the Exposition provided the first of a series of shocks to Franz Boas&#x27;s faith in public anthropology. The visitors were not there to be educated. By 1916, Boas had come to recognize with a certain resignation that &quot;the number of people in our country who are willing and able to enter into the modes of thought of other nations is altogether too small ... The American who is cognizant only of his own standpoint sets himself up as arbiter of the world.&quot;

Boas collaborated with Benjamin Ives Gilman to record music performed by Kwakwakaʼwakw musicians who were appearing at the Columbian Exposition. He had previously collaborated with Alice Cunningham Fletcher at the Bureau of American Ethnology in making several recordings of Indigenous music of North America. Boas and Fletcher partnered with music educator John Comfort Fillmore (1843–1898) in transcribing the music they recorded into music notation, and Fillmore also worked on the music Boas and Gilman recorded during the Columbian Exposition.

After the exposition, the ethnographic material collected formed the basis of the newly created Field Museum in Chicago with Boas as the curator of anthropology. He worked there until 1894, when he was replaced (against his will) by BAE archeologist William Henry Holmes.

In 1896, Boas was appointed Assistant Curator of Ethnology and Somatology of the American Museum of Natural History under Putnam. In 1897, he organized the Jesup North Pacific Expedition, a five-year-long field-study of the nations of the Pacific Northwest, whose ancestors had migrated across the Bering Strait from Siberia. This was the first comprehensive anthropological survey of the north circumpolar region, and Boas and his students made many sound and film recordings during this trip. These included a wide range of cultural recordings, including music with written song texts and translations. The music recordings produced during this study became a model for later studies in ethnomusicology.

Boas attempted to organize the research gathered from the Jessup Expedition into contextual, rather than evolutionary, lines. He also developed a research program in line with his curatorial goals: describing his instructions to his students in terms of widening contexts of interpretation within a society, he explained that &quot;... they get the specimens; they get explanations of the specimens; they get connected texts that partly refer to the specimens and partly to abstract things concerning the people; and they get grammatical information&quot;. These widening contexts of interpretation were abstracted into one context, the context in which the specimens, or assemblages of specimens, would be displayed: &quot;... we want a collection arranged according to tribes, in order to teach the particular style of each group&quot;. His approach, however, brought him into conflict with the President of the Museum, Morris Jesup, and its director, Hermon Bumpus. By 1900 Boas had begun to retreat from American museum anthropology as a tool of education or reform (Hinsley 1992: 361). He resigned in 1905, never to work for a museum again.

==Late 19th century debates==
===Science versus history===
Some scholars, like Boas&#x27;s student Alfred Kroeber, believed that Boas used his research in physics as a model for his work in anthropology. Many others, however—including Boas&#x27;s student Alexander Lesser, and later researchers such as Marian W. Smith, Herbert S. Lewis, and Matti Bunzl—have pointed out that Boas explicitly rejected physics in favor of history as a model for his anthropological research.

This distinction between science and history has its origins in 19th-century German academe, which distinguished between &quot;Naturwissenschaften&quot; (the sciences) and &quot;Geisteswissenschaften&quot; (the humanities), or between &quot;Gesetzwissenschaften&quot; (the law - giving sciences) and &quot;Geschichtswissenschaften&quot; (history). Generally, &quot;Naturwissenschaften&quot; and &quot;Gesetzwissenschaften&quot; refer to the study of phenomena that are governed by objective natural laws, while the latter terms in the two oppositions refer to those phenomena that have to mean only in terms of human perception or experience.

In 1884, Kantian philosopher Wilhelm Windelband coined the terms nomothetic and idiographic to describe these two divergent approaches. He observed that most scientists employ some mix of both, but in differing proportions; he considered physics a perfect example of a nomothetic science, and history, an idiographic science. Moreover, he argued that each approach has its origin in one of the two &quot;interests&quot; of reason Kant had identified in the &quot;Critique of Judgement&quot;—one &quot;generalizing&quot;, the other &quot;specifying&quot;. (Winkelband&#x27;s student Heinrich Rickert elaborated on this distinction in &quot;The Limits of Concept Formation in Natural Science : A Logical Introduction to the Historical Sciences&quot;; Boas&#x27;s students Alfred Kroeber and Edward Sapir relied extensively on this work in defining their own approach to anthropology.)

Although Kant considered these two interests of reason to be objective and universal, the distinction between the natural and human sciences was institutionalized in Germany, through the organization of scholarly research and teaching, following the Enlightenment. In Germany, the Enlightenment was dominated by Kant himself, who sought to establish principles based on universal rationality. In reaction to Kant, German scholars such as Johann Gottfried Herder (an influence to Boas) argued that human creativity, which necessarily takes unpredictable and highly diverse forms, is as important as human rationality. In 1795, the great linguist and philosopher Wilhelm von Humboldt called for an anthropology that would synthesize Kant&#x27;s and Herder&#x27;s interests. Humboldt founded the University of Berlin in 1809, and his work in geography, history, and psychology provided the milieu in which Boas&#x27;s intellectual orientation matured.

Historians working in the Humboldtian tradition developed ideas that would become central in Boasian anthropology. Leopold von Ranke defined the task of the historian as &quot;merely to show as it actually was&quot;, which is a cornerstone of Boas&#x27;s empiricism. Wilhelm Dilthey emphasized the centrality of &quot;understanding&quot; to human knowledge, and that the lived experience of a historian could provide a basis for an empathic understanding of the situation of a historical actor. For Boas, both values were well-expressed in a quote from Goethe: &quot;A single action or event is interesting, not because it is explainable, but because it is true.&quot;

The influence of these ideas on Boas is apparent in his 1887 essay, &quot;The Study of Geography&quot;, in which he distinguished between physical science, which seeks to discover the laws governing phenomena, and historical science, which seeks a thorough understanding of phenomena on their own terms. Boas argued that geography is and must be historical in this sense. In 1887, after his Baffin Island expedition, Boas wrote &quot;The Principles of Ethnological Classification&quot;, in which he developed this argument in application to anthropology:

This formulation echoes Ratzel&#x27;s focus on historical processes of human migration and culture contact and Bastian&#x27;s rejection of environmental determinism. It also emphasizes culture as a context (&quot;surroundings&quot;), and the importance of history. These are the hallmarks of Boasian anthropology (which Marvin Harris would later call &quot;historical particularism&quot;), would guide Boas&#x27;s research over the next decade, as well as his instructions to future students. (See Lewis 2001b for an alternative view to Harris&#x27;.)

Although context and history were essential elements to Boas&#x27;s understanding of anthropology as &quot;Geisteswissenschaften&quot; and &quot;Geschichtswissenschaften&quot;, there is one essential element that Boasian anthropology shares with &quot;Naturwissenschaften&quot;: empiricism. In 1949, Boas&#x27;s student Alfred Kroeber summed up the three principles of empiricism that define Boasian anthropology as a science:
# The method of science is, to begin with, questions, not with answers, least of all with value judgments.
# Science is a dispassionate inquiry and therefore cannot take over outright any ideologies &quot;already formulated in everyday life&quot; since these are themselves inevitably traditional and normally tinged with emotional prejudice.
# Sweeping all-or-none, black-and-white judgments are characteristic of categorical attitudes and have no place in science, whose very nature is inferential and judicious.

===Orthogenetic versus Darwinian evolution===

One of the greatest accomplishments of Boas and his students was their critique of theories of physical, social, and cultural evolution current at that time. This critique is central to Boas&#x27;s work in museums, as well as his work in all four fields of anthropology. As historian George Stocking noted, however, Boas&#x27;s main project was to distinguish between biological and cultural heredity, and to focus on the cultural processes that he believed had the greatest influence over social life. In fact, Boas supported Darwinian theory, although he did not assume that it automatically applied to cultural and historical phenomena (and indeed was a lifelong opponent of 19th-century theories of cultural evolution, such as those of Lewis H. Morgan and Edward Burnett Tylor). The notion of evolution that the Boasians ridiculed and rejected was the then dominant belief in orthogenesis—a determinate or teleological process of evolution in which change occurs progressively regardless of natural selection. Boas rejected the prevalent theories of social evolution developed by Edward Burnett Tylor, Lewis Henry Morgan, and Herbert Spencer not because he rejected the notion of &quot;evolution&quot; per se, but because he rejected orthogenetic notions of evolution in favor of Darwinian evolution.

The difference between these prevailing theories of cultural evolution and Darwinian theory cannot be overstated: the orthogeneticists argued that all societies progress through the same stages in the same sequence. Thus, although the Inuit with whom Boas worked at Baffin Island, and the Germans with whom he studied as a graduate student, were contemporaries of one another, evolutionists argued that the Inuit were at an earlier stage in their evolution, and Germans at a later stage.

Boasians argued that virtually every claim made by cultural evolutionists was contradicted by the data, or reflected a profound misinterpretation of the data. As Boas&#x27;s student Robert Lowie remarked, &quot;Contrary to some misleading statements on the subject, there have been no responsible opponents of evolution as &#x27;scientifically proved&#x27;, though there has been determined hostility to an evolutionary metaphysics that falsifies the established facts&quot;. In an unpublished lecture, Boas characterized his debt to Darwin thus:

Although the idea does not appear quite definitely expressed in Darwin&#x27;s discussion of the development of mental powers, it seems quite clear that his main object has been to express his conviction that the mental faculties developed essentially without a purposive end, but they originated as variations, and were continued by natural selection. This idea was also brought out very clearly by Wallace, who emphasized that apparently reasonable activities of man might very well have developed without an actual application of reasoning.

Thus, Boas suggested that what appear to be patterns or structures in a culture were not a product of conscious design, but rather the outcome of diverse mechanisms that produce cultural variation (such as diffusion and independent invention), shaped by the social environment in which people live and act. Boas concluded his lecture by acknowledging the importance of Darwin&#x27;s work: &quot;I hope I may have succeeded in presenting to you, however imperfectly, the currents of thought due to the work of the immortal Darwin which have helped to make anthropology what it is at the present time.&quot;

==Clash With Maurice Fishberg, Joseph Jacobs and Ellsworth Huntington==
During Maurice Fishberg&#x27;s time as a medical examiner he recorded skull and nose measurements of Jewish immigrants through which he originally asserted a genetic difference between Jews and non-Jews to describe them as another race along with Joseph Jacobs. However his theories were largely discredited by Franz Boas through the application of the scientific method. Opposed to the narrow or vertically arranged studies which Maurice Fishberg conducted which completely ignored the Jewish ethnicity i.e. culture, religion, and even family in the case of adoptions Franz Boas looked at all of those factors as well as across multiple generations and in multiple geographic locations to determine there to be no discernable genetic difference between Jews and non-Jews. This combined with the growth of what Max J. Kholer called Hitlerism or later Nazism in Germany resulted in a national summit where Franz Boas who had legally and scientifically been determined to be the factually correct opinion on the genetics of the Jewish people presided as guest of honor as Maurice Fishberg along with Ellsworth Huntington discredited their prior works before The Judaens and the Jewish Academy of Sciences on March 4, 1934, to emphatically state that there is no genetic difference between Jew and non-Jew nor and superior race. Later this discussion was distributed by Congregation B&#x27;nai B&#x27;rith in Cincinnati, Ohio.

==Early career: museum studies==
In the late 19th century anthropology in the United States was dominated by the Bureau of American Ethnology, directed by John Wesley Powell, a geologist who favored Lewis Henry Morgan&#x27;s theory of cultural evolution. The BAE was housed at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, and the Smithsonian&#x27;s curator for ethnology, Otis T. Mason, shared Powell&#x27;s commitment to cultural evolution. (The Peabody Museum at Harvard University was an important, though lesser, center of anthropological research).

It was while working on museum collections and exhibitions that Boas formulated his basic approach to culture, which led him to break with museums and seek to establish anthropology as an academic discipline.

During this period Boas made five more trips to the Pacific Northwest. His continuing field research led him to think of culture as a local context for human action. His emphasis on local context and history led him to oppose the dominant model at the time, cultural evolution.

Boas initially broke with evolutionary theory over the issue of kinship. Lewis Henry Morgan had argued that all human societies move from an initial form of matrilineal organization to patrilineal organization. First Nations groups on the northern coast of British Columbia, like the Tsimshian, and Tlingit, were organized into matrilineal clans. First Nations on the southern coast, like the Nootka and the Salish, however, were organized into patrilineal groups. Boas focused on the Kwakiutl, who lived between the two clusters. The Kwakiutl seemed to have a mix of features. Prior to marriage, a man would assume his wife&#x27;s father&#x27;s name and crest. His children took on these names and crests as well, although his sons would lose them when they got married. Names and crests thus stayed in the mother&#x27;s line. At first, Boas—like Morgan before him—suggested that the Kwakiutl had been matrilineal like their neighbors to the north, but that they were beginning to evolve patrilineal groups. In 1897, however, he repudiated himself, and argued that the Kwakiutl were changing from a prior patrilineal organization to a matrilineal one, as they learned about matrilineal principles from their northern neighbors.

Boas&#x27;s rejection of Morgan&#x27;s theories led him, in an 1887 article, to challenge Mason&#x27;s principles of museum display. At stake, however, were more basic issues of causality and classification. The evolutionary approach to material culture led museum curators to organize objects on display according to function or level of technological development. Curators assumed that changes in the forms of artifacts reflect some natural process of progressive evolution. Boas, however, felt that the form an artifact took reflected the circumstances under which it was produced and used. Arguing that &quot;[t]hough like causes have like effects like effects have not like causes&quot;, Boas realized that even artifacts that were similar in form might have developed in very different contexts, for different reasons. Mason&#x27;s museum displays, organized along evolutionary lines, mistakenly juxtapose like effects; those organized along contextual lines would reveal like causes.

===Minik Wallace===
In his capacity as Assistant Curator at the American Museum of Natural History, Franz Boas requested that Arctic explorer Robert E. Peary bring one Inuk from Greenland to New York. Peary obliged and brought six Inuit to New York in 1897 who lived in the basement of the American Museum of Natural History. Four of them died from tuberculosis within a year of arriving in New York, one returned to Greenland, and a young boy, Minik Wallace, remained living in the museum. Boas staged a funeral for the father of the boy and had the remains dissected and placed in the museum. Boas has been widely critiqued for his role in bringing the Inuit to New York and his disinterest in them once they had served their purpose at the museum.

==Later career: academic anthropology==

Boas was appointed a lecturer in physical anthropology at Columbia University in 1896, and promoted to professor of anthropology in 1899. However, the various anthropologists teaching at Columbia had been assigned to different departments. When Boas left the Museum of Natural History, he negotiated with Columbia University to consolidate the various professors into one department, of which Boas would take charge. Boas&#x27;s program at Columbia was the first Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) program in anthropology in America.

During this time Boas played a key role in organizing the American Anthropological Association (AAA) as an umbrella organization for the emerging field. Boas originally wanted the AAA to be limited to professional anthropologists, but William John McGee (another geologist who had joined the BAE under Powell&#x27;s leadership) argued that the organization should have an open membership. McGee&#x27;s position prevailed and he was elected the organization&#x27;s first president in 1902; Boas was elected a vice-president, along with Putnam, Powell, and Holmes.

At both Columbia and the AAA, Boas encouraged the &quot;four-field&quot; concept of anthropology; he personally contributed to physical anthropology, linguistics, archaeology, as well as cultural anthropology. His work in these fields was pioneering: in physical anthropology he led scholars away from static taxonomical classifications of race, to an emphasis on human biology and evolution; in linguistics he broke through the limitations of classic philology and established some of the central problems in modern linguistics and cognitive anthropology; in cultural anthropology he (along with the Polish-English anthropologist Bronisław Malinowski) established the contextualist approach to culture, cultural relativism, and the participant observation method of fieldwork.

The four-field approach understood not merely as bringing together different kinds of anthropologists into one department, but as reconceiving anthropology through the integration of different objects of anthropological research into one overarching object, was one of Boas&#x27;s fundamental contributions to the discipline, and came to characterize American anthropology against that of
England, France, or Germany. This approach defines as its object the human species as a totality. This focus did not lead Boas to seek to reduce all forms of humanity and human activity to some lowest common denominator; rather, he understood the essence of the human species to be the tremendous variation in human form and activity (an approach that parallels Charles Darwin&#x27;s approach to species in general).

In his 1907 essay, &quot;Anthropology&quot;, Boas identified two basic questions for anthropologists: &quot;Why are the tribes and nations of the world different, and how have the present differences developed?&quot;. Amplifying these questions, he explained the object of anthropological study thus:

We do not discuss the anatomical, physiological, and mental characteristics of a man considered as an individual; but we are interested in the diversity of these traits in groups of men found in different geographical areas and in different social classes. It is our task to inquire into the causes that have brought about the observed differentiation and to investigate the sequence of events that have led to the establishment of the multifarious forms of human life. In other words, we are interested in the anatomical and mental characteristics of men living under the same biological, geographical, and social environment, and as determined by their past.

These questions signal a marked break from then-current ideas about human diversity, which assumed that some people have a history, evident in a historical (or written) record, while other people, lacking writing, also lack history. For some, this distinction between two different kinds of societies explained the difference between history, sociology, economics and other disciplines that focus on people with writing, and anthropology, which was supposed to focus on people without writing. Boas rejected this distinction between kinds of societies, and this division of labor in the academy. He understood all societies to have a history, and all societies to be proper objects of the anthropological society. In order to approach literate and non-literate societies the same way, he emphasized the importance of studying human history through the analysis of other things besides written texts. Thus, in his 1904 article, &quot;The History of Anthropology&quot;, Boas wrote that

The historical development of the work of anthropologists seems to single out clearly a domain of knowledge that heretofore has not been treated by any other science. It is the biological history of mankind in all its varieties; linguistics applied to people without written languages; the ethnology of people without historical records; and prehistoric archeology.

Historians and social theorists in the 18th and 19th centuries had speculated as to the causes of this differentiation, but Boas dismissed these theories, especially the dominant theories of social evolution and cultural evolution as speculative. He endeavored to establish a discipline that would base its claims on a rigorous empirical study.

One of Boas&#x27;s most important books, &quot;The Mind of Primitive Man&quot; (1911), integrated his theories concerning the history and development of cultures and established a program that would dominate American anthropology for the next fifteen years. In this study, he established that in any given population, biology, language, material, and symbolic culture, are autonomous; that each is an equally important dimension of human nature, but that no one of these dimensions is reducible to another. In other words, he established that culture does not depend on any independent variables. He emphasized that the biological, linguistic, and cultural traits of any group of people are the product of historical developments involving both cultural and non-cultural forces. He established that cultural plurality is a fundamental feature of humankind and that the specific cultural environment structures much individual behavior.

Boas also presented himself as a role model for the citizen-scientist, who understand that even were the truth pursued as its own end, all knowledge has moral consequences. &quot;The Mind of Primitive Man&quot; ends with an appeal to humanism:

I hope the discussions outlined in these pages have shown that the data of anthropology teach us a greater tolerance of forms of civilization different from our own, that we should learn to look on foreign races with greater sympathy and with a conviction that, as all races have contributed in the past to cultural progress in one way or another, so they will be capable of advancing the interests of mankind if we are only willing to give them a fair opportunity.

===Physical anthropology===
Boas&#x27;s work in physical anthropology brought together his interest in Darwinian evolution with his interest in migration as a cause of change. His most important research in this field was his study of changes in the body from among children of immigrants in New York. Other researchers had already noted differences in height, cranial measurements, and other physical features between Americans and people from different parts of Europe. Many used these differences to argue that there is an innate biological difference between races. Boas&#x27;s primary interest—in symbolic and material culture and in language—was the study of processes of change; he therefore set out to determine whether bodily forms are also subject to processes of change. Boas studied 17,821 people, divided into seven ethno-national groups. Boas found that average measures of the cranial size of immigrants were significantly different from members of these groups who were born in the United States. Moreover, he discovered that average measures of the cranial size of children born within ten years of their mothers&#x27; arrival were significantly different from those of children born more than ten years after their mothers&#x27; arrival. Boas did not deny that physical features such as height or cranial size were inherited; he did, however, argue that the environment has an influence on these features, which is expressed through change over time. This work was central to his influential argument that differences between races were not immutable. Boas observed:

The head form, which has always been one of the most stable and permanent characteristics of human races, undergoes far-reaching changes due to the transfer of European races to American soil. The East European Hebrew, who has a round head, becomes more long-headed; the South Italian, who in Italy has an exceedingly long head, becomes more short-headed; so that both approach a uniform type in this country, so far as the head is concerned.

These findings were radical at the time and continue to be debated. In 2002, the anthropologists Corey S. Sparks and Richard L. Jantz claimed that differences between children born to the same parents in Europe and America were very small and insignificant and that there was no detectable effect of exposure to the American environment on the cranial index in children. They argued that their results contradicted Boas&#x27;s original findings and demonstrated that they may no longer be used to support arguments of plasticity in cranial morphology. However, Jonathan Marks—a well-known physical anthropologist and former president of the General Anthropology section of the American Anthropological Association—has remarked that this revisionist study of Boas&#x27;s work &quot;has the ring of desperation to it (if not obfuscation), and has been quickly rebutted by more mainstream biological anthropology&quot;. In 2003 anthropologists Clarence C. Gravlee, H. Russell Bernard, and William R. Leonard reanalyzed Boas&#x27;s data and concluded that most of Boas&#x27;s original findings were correct. Moreover, they applied new statistical, computer-assisted methods to Boas&#x27;s data and discovered more evidence for cranial plasticity. In a later publication, Gravlee, Bernard and Leonard reviewed Sparks and Jantz&#x27;s analysis. They argue that Sparks and Jantz misrepresented Boas&#x27;s claims and that Sparks&#x27;s and Jantz&#x27;s data actually support Boas. For example, they point out that Sparks and Jantz look at changes in cranial size in relation to how long an individual has been in the United States in order to test the influence of the environment. Boas, however, looked at changes in cranial size in relation to how long the mother had been in the United States. They argue that Boas&#x27;s method is more useful because the prenatal environment is a crucial developmental factor.

A further publication by Jantz based on Gravlee et al. claims that Boas had cherry picked two groups of immigrants (Sicilians and Hebrews) which had varied most towards the same mean, and discarded other groups which had varied in the opposite direction. He commented, &quot;Using the recent reanalysis by Gravlee et al. (2003), we can observe in Figure 2 that the maximum difference in the cranial index due to immigration (in Hebrews) is much smaller than the maximum ethnic difference, between Sicilians and Bohemians. It shows that long-headed parents produce long headed offspring and vice versa. To make the argument that children of immigrants converge onto an &quot;American type&quot; required Boas to use the two groups that changed the most.&quot;

Although some sociobiologists and evolutionary psychologists have suggested that Boas was opposed to Darwinian evolution, Boas, in fact, was a committed proponent of Darwinian evolutionary thought. In 1888, he declared that &quot;the development of ethnology is largely due to the general recognition of the principle of biological evolution&quot;. Since Boas&#x27;s times, physical anthropologists have established that the human capacity for culture is a product of human evolution. In fact, Boas&#x27;s research on changes in body form played an important role in the rise of Darwinian theory. Boas was trained at a time when biologists had no understanding of genetics; Mendelian genetics became widely known only after 1900. Prior to that time biologists relied on the measurement of physical traits as empirical data for any theory of evolution. Boas&#x27;s biometric studies led him to question the use of this method and kind of data. In a speech to anthropologists in Berlin in 1912, Boas argued that at best such statistics could only raise biological questions, and not answer them. It was in this context that anthropologists began turning to genetics as a basis for any understanding of biological variation.

===Linguistics===
Boas also contributed greatly to the foundation of linguistics as a science in the United States. He published many descriptive studies of Native American languages, wrote on theoretical difficulties in classifying languages, and laid out a research program for studying the relations between language and culture which his students such as Edward Sapir, Paul Rivet, and Alfred Kroeber followed.

His 1889 article &quot;On Alternating Sounds&quot;, however, made a singular contribution to the methodology of both linguistics and cultural anthropology. It is a response to a paper presented in 1888 by Daniel Garrison Brinton, at the time a professor of American linguistics and archaeology at the University of Pennsylvania. Brinton observed that in the spoken languages of many Native Americans, certain sounds regularly alternated. Brinton argued that this pervasive inconsistency was a sign of linguistic and evolutionary inferiority.

Boas had heard similar phonetic shifts during his research in Baffin Island and in the Pacific Northwest. Nevertheless, he argued that &quot;alternating sounds&quot; is not at all a feature of Native American languages—indeed, he argued, they do not really exist. Rather than take alternating sounds as objective proof of different stages in cultural evolution, Boas considered them in terms of his longstanding interest in the subjective perception of objective physical phenomena. He also considered his earlier critique of evolutionary museum displays. There, he pointed out that two things (artifacts of material culture) that appear to be similar may, in fact, be quite different. In this article, he raises the possibility that two things (sounds) that appear to be different may, in fact, be the same.

In short, he shifted attention to the &quot;perception&quot; of different sounds. Boas begins by raising an empirical question: when people describe one sound in different ways, is it because they cannot perceive the difference, or might there be another reason? He immediately establishes that he is not concerned with cases involving perceptual deficit—the aural equivalent of color-blindness. He points out that the question of people who describe one sound in different ways is comparable to that of people who describe different sounds in one way. This is crucial for research in descriptive linguistics: when studying a new language, how are we to note the pronunciation of different words? (In this point, Boas anticipates and lays the groundwork for the distinction between phonemics and phonetics.) People may pronounce a word in a variety of ways and still recognize that they are using the same word. The issue, then, is not &quot;that such sensations are not recognized in their individuality&quot; (in other words, people recognize differences in pronunciations); rather, it is that sounds &quot;are classified according to their similarity&quot; (in other words, that people classify a variety of perceived sounds into one category). A comparable visual example would involve words for colors. The English word &quot;green&quot; can be used to refer to a variety of shades, hues, and tints. But there are some languages that have no word for &quot;green&quot;. In such cases, people might classify what we would call &quot;green&quot; as either &quot;yellow&quot; or &quot;blue&quot;. This is not an example of color-blindness—people can perceive differences in color, but they categorize similar colors in a different way than English speakers.

Boas applied these principles to his studies of Inuit languages. Researchers have reported a variety of spellings for a given word. In the past, researchers have interpreted this data in a number of ways—it could indicate local variations in the pronunciation of a word, or it could indicate different dialects. Boas argues an alternative explanation: that the difference is not in how Inuit pronounce the word, but rather in how English-speaking scholars perceive the pronunciation of the word. It is not that English speakers are physically incapable of perceiving the sound in question; rather, the phonetic system of English cannot accommodate the perceived sound.

Although Boas was making a very specific contribution to the methods of descriptive linguistics, his ultimate point is far reaching: observer bias need not be personal, it can be cultural. In other words, the perceptual categories of Western researchers may systematically cause a Westerner to misperceive or to fail to perceive entirely a meaningful element in another culture. As in his critique of Otis Mason&#x27;s museum displays, Boas demonstrated that what appeared to be evidence of cultural evolution was really the consequence of unscientific methods and a reflection of Westerners&#x27; beliefs about their own cultural superiority. This point provides the methodological foundation for Boas&#x27;s cultural relativism: elements of a culture are meaningful in that culture&#x27;s terms, even if they may be meaningless (or take on a radically different meaning) in another culture.

===Cultural anthropology===

The essence of Boas&#x27;s approach to ethnography is found in his early essay on &quot;The Study of Geography&quot;. There he argued for an approach that

When Boas&#x27;s student Ruth Benedict gave her presidential address to the American Anthropological Association in 1947, she reminded anthropologists of the importance of this idiographic stance by quoting literary critic A. C. Bradley: &quot;We watch &#x27;what is&#x27;, seeing that so it happened and must have happened&quot;.

This orientation led Boas to promote a cultural anthropology characterized by a strong commitment to
* Empiricism (with a resulting skepticism of attempts to formulate &quot;scientific laws&quot; of culture)
* A notion of culture as fluid and dynamic
* Ethnographic fieldwork, in which the anthropologist resides for an extended period among the people being researched, conducts research in the native language, and collaborates with native researchers, as a method of collecting data, and
* Cultural relativism as a methodological tool while conducting fieldwork, and as a heuristic tool while analyzing data.

Boas argued that in order to understand &quot;what is&quot;—in cultural anthropology, the specific cultural traits (behaviors, beliefs, and symbols)—one had to examine them in their local context. He also understood that as people migrate from one place to another, and as the cultural context changes over time, the elements of a culture, and their meanings, will change, which led him to emphasize the importance of local histories for an analysis of cultures.

Although other anthropologists at the time, such as Bronisław Malinowski and Alfred Reginald Radcliffe-Brown focused on the study of societies, which they understood to be clearly bounded, Boas&#x27;s attention to history, which reveals the extent to which traits diffuse from one place to another, led him to view cultural boundaries as multiple and overlapping, and as highly permeable. Thus, Boas&#x27;s student Robert Lowie once described culture as a thing of &quot;shreds and patches&quot;. Boas and his students understood that as people try to make sense of their world they seek to integrate its disparate elements, with the result that different cultures could be characterized as having different configurations or patterns. But Boasians also understood that such integration was always in tensions with diffusion, and any appearance of a stable configuration is contingent (see Bashkow 2004: 445).

During Boas&#x27;s lifetime, as today, many Westerners saw a fundamental difference between modern societies, which are characterized by dynamism and individualism, and traditional societies, which are stable and homogeneous. Boas&#x27;s empirical field research, however, led him to argue against this comparison. For example, his 1903 essay, &quot;Decorative Designs of Alaskan Needlecases: A History of Conventional Designs, Based on Materials in a U.S. Museum&quot;, provides another example of how Boas made broad theoretical claims based on a detailed analysis of empirical data. After establishing formal similarities among the needlecases, Boas shows how certain formal features provide a vocabulary out of which individual artisans could create variations in design. Thus, his emphasis on culture as a context for meaningful action made him sensitive to individual variation within a society (William Henry Holmes suggested a similar point in an 1886 paper, &quot;Origin and development of form and ornament in ceramic art&quot;, although unlike Boas he did not develop the ethnographic and theoretical implications).
In a programmatic essay in 1920, &quot;The Methods of Ethnology&quot;, Boas argued that instead of &quot;the systematic enumeration of standardized beliefs and customs of a tribe&quot;, anthropology needs to document &quot;the way in which the individual reacts to his whole social environment, and to the difference of opinion and of mode of action that occur in primitive society and which are the causes of far-reaching changes&quot;. Boas argued that attention to individual agency reveals that &quot;the activities of the individual are determined to a great extent by his social environment, but in turn, his own activities influence the society in which he lives and may bring about modifications in a form&quot;. Consequently, Boas thought of culture as fundamentally dynamic: &quot;As soon as these methods are applied, primitive society loses the appearance of absolute stability ... All cultural forms rather appear in a constant state of flux ...&quot; (see Lewis 2001b)

Having argued against the relevance of the distinction between literate and non-literate societies as a way of defining anthropology&#x27;s object of study, Boas argued that non-literate and literate societies should be analyzed in the same way. Nineteenth-century historians had been applying the techniques of philology to reconstruct the histories of, and relationships between, literate societies. In order to apply these methods to non-literate societies, Boas argued that the task of fieldworkers is to produce and collect texts in non-literate societies. This took the form not only of compiling lexicons and grammars of the local language, but of recording myths, folktales, beliefs about social relationships and institutions, and even recipes for local cuisine. In order to do this, Boas relied heavily on the collaboration of literate native ethnographers (among the Kwakiutl, most often George Hunt), and he urged his students to consider such people valuable partners, inferior in their standing in Western society, but superior in their understanding of their own culture. (see Bunzl 2004: 438–439)

Using these methods, Boas published another article in 1920, in which he revisited his earlier research on Kwakiutl kinship. In the late 1890s, Boas had tried to reconstruct transformation in the organization of Kwakiutl clans, by comparing them to the organization of clans in other societies neighboring the Kwakiutl to the north and south. Now, however, he argued against translating the Kwakiutl principle of kin groups into an English word. Instead of trying to fit the Kwakiutl into some larger model, he tried to understand their beliefs and practices in their own terms. For example, whereas he had earlier translated the Kwakiutl word &quot;numaym&quot; as &quot;clan&quot;, he now argued that the word is best understood as referring to a bundle of privileges, for which there is no English word. Men secured claims to these privileges through their parents or wives, and there were a variety of ways these privileges could be acquired, used, and transmitted from one generation to the next. As in his work on alternating sounds, Boas had come to realize that different ethnological interpretations of Kwakiutl kinship were the result of the limitations of Western categories. As in his work on Alaskan needlecases, he now saw variation among Kwakiutl practices as the result of the play between social norms and individual creativity.

Before his death in 1942, he appointed Helen Codere to edit and publish his manuscripts about the culture of the Kwakiutl people.

==Franz Boas and folklore==
Franz Boas was an immensely influential figure throughout the development of folklore as a discipline. At first glance, it might seem that his only concern was for the discipline of anthropology—after all, he fought for most of his life to keep folklore as a part of anthropology. Yet Boas was motivated by his desire to see both anthropology and folklore become more professional and well-respected. Boas was afraid that if folklore was allowed to become its own discipline the standards for folklore scholarship would be lowered. This, combined with the scholarships of &quot;amateurs&quot;, would lead folklore to be completely discredited, Boas believed.

In order to further professionalize folklore, Boas introduced the strict scientific methods which he learned in college to the discipline. Boas championed the use of exhaustive research, fieldwork, and strict scientific guidelines in folklore scholarship. Boas believed that a true theory could only be formed from thorough research and that even once you had a theory it should be treated as a &quot;work in progress&quot; unless it could be proved beyond doubt. This rigid scientific methodology was eventually accepted as one of the major tenets of folklore scholarship, and Boas&#x27;s methods remain in use even today. Boas also nurtured many budding folklorists during his time as a professor, and some of his students are counted among the most notable minds in folklore scholarship.

Boas was passionate about the collection of folklore and believed that the similarity of folktales amongst different folk groups was due to dissemination. Boas strove to prove this theory, and his efforts produced a method for breaking a folktale into parts and then analyzing these parts. His creation of &quot;catch-words&quot; allowed for categorization of these parts, and the ability to analyze them in relation to other similar tales. Boas also fought to prove that not all cultures progressed along the same path, and that non-European cultures, in particular, were not primitive, but different.

Boas remained active in the development and scholarship of folklore throughout his life. He became the editor of the &quot;Journal of American Folklore&quot; in 1908, regularly wrote and published articles on folklore (often in the &quot;Journal of American Folklore&quot;). He helped to elect Louise Pound as president of the American Folklore Society in 1925.

==Scientist as activist==
Boas was known for passionately defending what he believed to be right. During his lifetime (and often through his work), Boas combated racism, berated anthropologists and folklorists who used their work as a cover for espionage, worked to protect German and Austrian scientists who fled the Nazi regime, and openly protested Hitlerism.

Many social scientists in other disciplines often agonize over the legitimacy of their work as &quot;science&quot; and consequently emphasize the importance of detachment, objectivity, abstraction, and quantifiability in their work. Perhaps because Boas, like other early anthropologists, was originally trained in the natural sciences, he and his students never expressed such anxiety. Moreover, he did not believe that detachment, objectivity, and quantifiability was required to make anthropology scientific. Since the object of study of anthropologists is different from the object of study of physicists, he assumed that anthropologists would have to employ different methods and different criteria for evaluating their research. Thus, Boas used statistical studies to demonstrate the extent to which variation in data is context-dependent, and argued that the context-dependent nature of human variation rendered many abstractions and generalizations that had been passing as scientific understandings of humankind (especially theories of social evolution popular at the time) in fact unscientific. His understanding of ethnographic fieldwork began with the fact that the objects of ethnographic study (e.g.,  the Inuit of Baffin Island) were not just objects, but subjects, and his research called attention to their creativity and agency. More importantly, he viewed the Inuit as his teachers, thus reversing the typical hierarchical relationship between scientist and object of study.

This emphasis on the relationship between anthropologists and those they study—the point that, while astronomers and stars; chemists and elements; botanists and plants are fundamentally different, anthropologists and those they study are equally human—implied that anthropologists themselves could be objects of anthropological study. Although Boas did not pursue this reversal systematically, his article on alternating sounds illustrates his awareness that scientists should not be confident about their objectivity, because they too see the world through the prism of their culture.

This emphasis also led Boas to conclude that anthropologists have an obligation to speak out on social issues. Boas was especially concerned with racial inequality, which his research had indicated is not biological in origin, but rather social. Boas is credited as the first scientist to publish the idea that all people—including white and African Americans—are equal. He often emphasized his abhorrence of racism, and used his work to show that there was no scientific basis for such a bias. An early example of this concern is evident in his 1906 commencement address to Atlanta University, at the invitation of W. E. B. Du Bois. Boas began by remarking that &quot;If you did accept the view that the present weakness of the American Negro, his uncontrollable emotions, his lack of energy, are racially inherent, your work would still be noble one&quot;. He then went on, however, to argue against this view. To the claim that European and Asian civilizations are, at the time, more advanced than African societies, Boas objected that against the total history of humankind, the past two thousand years is but a brief span. Moreover, although the technological advances of our early ancestors (such as taming fire and inventing stone tools) might seem insignificant when compared to the invention of the steam engine or control over electricity, we should consider that they might actually be even greater accomplishments. Boas then went on to catalogue advances in Africa, such as smelting iron, cultivating millet, and domesticating chickens and cattle, that occurred in Africa well before they spread to Europe and Asia (evidence now suggests that chickens were first domesticated in Asia; the original domestication of cattle is under debate). He then described the activities of African kings, diplomats, merchants, and artists as evidence of cultural achievement. From this, he concluded, any social inferiority of Negroes in the United States cannot be explained by their African origins:

If therefore, it is claimed that your race is doomed to economic inferiority, you may confidently look to the home of your ancestors and say, that you have set out to recover for the colored people the strength that was their own before they set foot on the shores of this continent. You may say that you go to work with bright hopes and that you will not be discouraged by the slowness of your progress; for you have to recover not only what has been lost in transplanting the Negro race from its native soil to this continent, but you must reach higher levels than your ancestors ever had attained.

Boas proceeds to discuss the arguments for the inferiority of the &quot;Negro race&quot;, and calls attention to the fact that they were brought to the Americas through force. For Boas, this is just one example of the many times conquest or colonialism has brought different peoples into an unequal relation, and he mentions &quot;the conquest of England by the Normans, the Teutonic invasion of Italy, [and] the Manchu conquest of China&quot; as resulting in similar conditions. But the best example, for Boas, of this phenomenon is that of the Jews in Europe:

Even now there lingers in the consciousness of the old, sharper divisions which the ages had not been able to efface, and which is strong enough to find—not only here and there—expression as antipathy to the Jewish type. In France, that let down the barriers more than a hundred years ago, the feeling of antipathy is still strong enough to sustain an anti-Jewish political party.

Boas&#x27;s closing advice is that African Americans should not look to whites for approval or encouragement because people in power usually take a very long time to learn to sympathize with people out of power. &quot;Remember that in every single case in history the process of adaptation has been one of exceeding slowness. Do not look for the impossible, but do not let your path deviate from the quiet and steadfast insistence on full opportunities for your powers.&quot;

Despite Boas&#x27;s caveat about the intractability of white prejudice, he also considered it the scientist&#x27;s responsibility to argue against white myths of racial purity and racial superiority and to use the evidence of his research to fight racism. At the time, Boas had no idea that speaking at Atlanta University would put him at odds with a different prominent Black figure, Booker T. Washington. Du Bois and Washington had different views on the means of uplifting Black Americans. By supporting Du Bois, Boas lost Washington&#x27;s support and any chance of funding from his college, Carnegie Mellon University.

Boas was also critical of one nation imposing its power over others. In 1916, Boas wrote a letter to &quot;The New York Times&quot; which was published under the headline, &quot;Why German-Americans Blame America&quot;. Although Boas did begin the letter by protesting bitter attacks against German-Americans at the time of the war in Europe, most of his letter was a critique of American nationalism. &quot;In my youth, I had been taught in school and at home not only to love the good of my own country, but also to seek to understand and to respect the individualities of other nations. For this reason, one-sided nationalism, that is so often found nowadays, is to be unendurable.&quot; He writes of his love for American ideals of freedom, and of his growing discomfort with American beliefs about its own superiority over others.

I have always been of the opinion that we have no right to impose our ideals upon other nations, no matter how strange it may seem to us that they enjoy the kind of life they lead, how slow they may be in utilizing the resources of their countries, or how much opposed their ideas may be to ours ... Our intolerant attitude is most pronounced in regard to what we like to call &quot;our free institutions.&quot; Modern democracy was no doubt the most wholesome and needed reaction against the abuses of absolutism and of a selfish, often corrupt, bureaucracy. That the wishes and thoughts of the people should find expression, and that the form of government should conform to these wishes is an axiom that has pervaded the whole Western world, and that is even taking root in the Far East. It is a quite different question, however, in how far the particular machinery of democratic government is identical with democratic institutions ... To claim as we often do, that our solution is the only democratic and the ideal one is a one-sided expression of Americanism. I see no reason why we should not allow the Germans, Austrians, and Russians, or whoever else it may be, to solve their problems in their own ways, instead of demanding that they bestow upon themselves the benefactions of our regime.

Although Boas felt that scientists have a responsibility to speak out on social and political problems, he was appalled that they might involve themselves in disingenuous and deceitful ways. Thus, in 1919, when he discovered that four anthropologists, in the course of their research in other countries, were serving as spies for the American government, he wrote an angry letter to &quot;The Nation&quot;. It is perhaps in this letter that he most clearly expresses his understanding of his commitment to science:

A soldier whose business is murder as a fine art, a diplomat whose calling is based on deception and secretiveness, a politician whose very life consists in compromises with his conscience, a businessman whose aim is personal profit within the limits allowed by a lenient law—such may be excused if they set patriotic deception above common everyday decency and perform services as spies. They merely accept the code of morality to which modern society still conforms. Not so the scientist. The very essence of his life is the service of truth. We all know scientists who in private life do not come up to the standard of truthfulness, but who, nevertheless, would not consciously falsify the results of their researches. It is bad enough if we have to put up with these because they reveal a lack of strength of character that is liable to distort the results of their work. A person, however, who uses science as a cover for political spying, who demeans himself to pose before a foreign government as an investigator and asks for assistance in his alleged researches in order to carry on, under this cloak, his political machinations, prostitutes science in an unpardonable way and forfeits the right to be classed as a scientist.

Although Boas did not name the spies in question, he was referring to a group led by Sylvanus G. Morley, who was affiliated with Harvard University&#x27;s Peabody Museum. While conducting research in Mexico, Morley and his colleagues looked for evidence of German submarine bases, and collected intelligence on Mexican political figures and German immigrants in Mexico.

Boas&#x27;s stance against spying took place in the context of his struggle to establish a new model for academic anthropology at Columbia University. Previously, American anthropology was based at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington and the Peabody Museum at Harvard, and these anthropologists competed with Boas&#x27;s students for control over the American Anthropological Association (and its flagship publication &quot;American Anthropologist&quot;). When the National Academy of Sciences established the National Research Council in 1916 as a means by which scientists could assist the United States government to prepare for entry into the war in Europe, competition between the two groups intensified. Boas&#x27;s rival, W. H. Holmes (who had gotten the job of Director at the Field Museum for which Boas had been passed over 26 years earlier), was appointed to head the NRC; Morley was a protégé of Holmes&#x27;s.

When Boas&#x27;s letter was published, Holmes wrote to a friend complaining about &quot;the Prussian control of anthropology in this country&quot; and the need to end Boas&#x27;s &quot;Hun regime&quot;. Reaction of Holmes and his allies was influenced by anti-German and probably also by anti-Jewish sentiment. The Anthropological Society of Washington passed a resolution condemning Boas&#x27;s letter for unjustly criticizing President Wilson; attacking the principles of American democracy; and endangering anthropologists abroad, who would now be suspected of being spies. This resolution was passed on to the American Anthropological Association (AAA) and the National Research Council. Members of the American Anthropological Association (among whom Boas was a founding member in 1902), meeting at the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology at Harvard (with which Morley, Lothrop, and Spinden were affiliated), voted by 20 to 10 to censure Boas. As a result, Boas resigned as the AAA&#x27;s representative to the NRC, although he remained an active member of the AAA. The AAA&#x27;s censure of Boas was not rescinded until 2005.

Boas continued to speak out against racism and for intellectual freedom. When the Nazi Party in Germany denounced &quot;Jewish Science&quot; (which included not only Boasian Anthropology but Freudian psychoanalysis and Einsteinian physics), Boas responded with a public statement signed by over 8,000 other scientists, declaring that there is only one science, to which race and religion are irrelevant. After World War I, Boas created the Emergency Society for German and Austrian Science. This organization was originally dedicated to fostering friendly relations between American and German and Austrian scientists and for providing research funding to German scientists who had been adversely affected by the war, and to help scientists who had been interned. With the rise of Nazi Germany, Boas assisted German scientists in fleeing the Nazi regime. Boas helped these scientists not only to escape but to secure positions once they arrived. Additionally, Boas addressed an open letter to Paul von Hindenburg in protest against Hitlerism. He also wrote an article in &quot;The American Mercury&quot; arguing that there were no differences between Aryans and non-Aryans and the German government should not base its policies on such a false premise.

Boas, and his students such as Melville J. Herskovits, opposed the racist pseudoscience developed at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute of Anthropology, Human Heredity, and Eugenics under its director Eugen Fischer: &quot;Melville J. Herskovits (one of Franz Boas&#x27;s students) pointed out that the health problems and social prejudices encountered by these children (Rhineland Bastards) and their parents explained what Germans viewed as racial inferiority was not due to racial heredity. This &quot;... provoked polemic invective against the latter [Boas] from Fischer. &quot;The views of Mr.  Boas are in part quite ingenious, but in the field of heredity Mr. Boas is by no means competent&quot; even though &quot;a great number of research projects at the KWI-A which had picked up on Boas&#x27;s studies about immigrants in New York had confirmed his findings—including the study by Walter Dornfeldt about Eastern European Jews in Berlin. Fischer resorted to polemic simply because he had no arguments to counter the Boasians&#x27; critique.&quot;

==Students and influence==
Franz Boas died suddenly at the Columbia University Faculty Club on December 21, 1942, in the arms of Claude Lévi-Strauss. By that time he had become one of the most influential and respected scientists of his generation.

Between 1901 and 1911, Columbia University produced seven PhDs in anthropology. Although by today&#x27;s standards this is a very small number, at the time it was sufficient to establish Boas&#x27;s Anthropology Department at Columbia as the preeminent anthropology program in the country. Moreover, many of Boas&#x27;s students went on to establish anthropology programs at other major universities.

Boas&#x27;s first doctoral student at Columbia was Alfred L. Kroeber (1901), who, along with fellow Boas student Robert Lowie (1908), started the anthropology program at the University of California, Berkeley. He also trained William Jones (1904), one of the first Native American Indian anthropologists (the Fox nation) who was killed while conducting research in the Philippines in 1909, and Albert B. Lewis (1907). Boas also trained a number of other students who were influential in the development of academic anthropology: Frank Speck (1908) who trained with Boas but received his PhD from the University of Pennsylvania and immediately proceeded to found the anthropology department there; Edward Sapir (1909) and Fay-Cooper Cole (1914) who developed the anthropology program at the University of Chicago; Alexander Goldenweiser (1910), who, with Elsie Clews Parsons (who received her doctorate in sociology from Columbia in 1899, but then studied ethnology with Boas), started the anthropology program at the New School for Social Research; Leslie Spier (1920) who started the anthropology program at the University of Washington together with his wife Erna Gunther, also one of Boas&#x27;s students, and Melville Herskovits (1923) who started the anthropology program at Northwestern University. He also trained John R. Swanton (who studied with Boas at Columbia for two years before receiving his doctorate from Harvard in 1900), Paul Radin (1911), Ruth Benedict (1923), Gladys Reichard (1925) who had begun teaching at Barnard College in 1921 and was later promoted to the rank of professor, Ruth Bunzel (1929), Alexander Lesser (1929), Margaret Mead (1929), and Gene Weltfish (who defended her dissertation in 1929, although she did not officially graduate until 1950 when Columbia reduced the expenses required to graduate), E. Adamson Hoebel (1934), Jules Henry (1935), George Herzog (1938),and Ashley Montagu (1938).

His students at Columbia also included Mexican anthropologist Manuel Gamio, who earned his Master of Arts degree after studying with Boas from 1909 to 1911, and became the founding director of Mexico&#x27;s Bureau of Anthropology in 1917; Clark Wissler, who received his doctorate in psychology from Columbia University in 1901, but proceeded to study anthropology with Boas before turning to research Native Americans; Esther Schiff, later Goldfrank, worked with Boas in the summers of 1920 to 1922 to conduct research among the Cochiti and Laguna Pueblo Indians in New Mexico; Gilberto Freyre, who shaped the concept of &quot;racial democracy&quot; in Brazil; Viola Garfield, who carried forth Boas&#x27;s Tsimshian work; Frederica de Laguna, who worked on the Inuit and the Tlingit; anthropologist, folklorist and novelist Zora Neale Hurston, who graduated from Barnard College, the women&#x27;s college associated with Columbia, in 1928, and who studied African American and Afro-Caribbean folklore, and Ella Cara Deloria, who worked closely with Boas on the linguistics of Native American languages.

Boas and his students were also an influence on Claude Lévi-Strauss, who interacted with Boas and the Boasians during his stay in New York in the 1940s.

Several of Boas&#x27;s students went on to serve as editors of the American Anthropological Association&#x27;s flagship journal, &quot;American Anthropologist&quot;: John R. Swanton (1911, 1921–1923), Robert Lowie (1924–1933), Leslie Spier (1934–1938), and Melville Herskovits (1950–1952). Edward Sapir&#x27;s student John Alden Mason was editor from 1945 to 1949, and Alfred Kroeber and Robert Lowie&#x27;s student, Walter Goldschmidt, was editor from 1956 to 1959. His last student Marian Smith was President of the American Anthropological Association and the honorary secretary of the Royal Anthropological Institute in London.

Most of Boas&#x27;s students shared his concern for careful, historical reconstruction, and his antipathy towards speculative, evolutionary models. Moreover, Boas encouraged his students, by example, to criticize themselves as much as others. For example, Boas originally defended the cephalic index (systematic variations in head form) as a method for describing hereditary traits, but came to reject his earlier research after further study; he similarly came to criticize his own early work in Kwakiutl (Pacific Northwest) language and mythology.

Encouraged by this drive to self-criticism, as well as the Boasian commitment to learn from one&#x27;s informants and to let the findings of one&#x27;s research shape one&#x27;s agenda, Boas&#x27;s students quickly diverged from his own research agenda. Several of his students soon attempted to develop theories of the grand sort that Boas typically rejected. Kroeber called his colleagues&#x27; attention to Sigmund Freud and the potential of a union between cultural anthropology and psychoanalysis. Ruth Benedict developed theories of &quot;culture and personality&quot; and &quot;national cultures&quot;, and Kroeber&#x27;s student, Julian Steward developed theories of &quot;cultural ecology&quot; and &quot;multilineal evolution&quot;.

==Legacy==

Nevertheless, Boas has had an enduring influence on anthropology. Virtually all anthropologists today accept Boas&#x27;s commitment to empiricism and his methodological cultural relativism. Moreover, virtually all cultural anthropologists today share Boas&#x27;s commitment to field research involving extended residence, learning the local language, and developing social relationships with informants. Finally, anthropologists continue to honor his critique of racial ideologies. In his 1963 book, &quot;Race: The History of an Idea in America&quot;, Thomas Gossett wrote that &quot;It is possible that Boas did more to combat race prejudice than any other person in history.&quot;

<text>Franz Bopp (; 14 September 1791 – 23 October 1867) was a German linguist known for extensive and pioneering comparative work on Indo-European languages.

==Early life==
Bopp was born in Mainz, but the political disarray in the Republic of Mainz caused his parents&#x27; move to Aschaffenburg, the second seat of the Archbishop of Mainz. There he received a liberal education at the Lyceum and Karl Joseph Hieronymus Windischmann drew his attention to the languages and literature of the East. (Windischmann, along with Georg Friedrich Creuzer, Joseph Görres, and the brothers Schlegel, expressed great enthusiasm for Indian wisdom and philosophy.) Moreover, Karl Wilhelm Friedrich von Schlegel&#x27;s book, &quot;Über die Sprache und Weisheit der Indier&quot; (&quot;On the Speech and Wisdom of the Indians&quot;, Heidelberg, 1808), had just begun to exert a powerful influence on the minds of German philosophers and historians, and stimulated Bopp&#x27;s interest in the sacred language of the Hindus.

==Career==
In 1812, he went to Paris at the expense of the Bavarian government, with a view to devoting himself vigorously to the study of Sanskrit. There he enjoyed the society of such eminent men as Antoine-Léonard de Chézy (his primary instructor), Silvestre de Sacy, Louis Mathieu Langlès, and, above all Alexander Hamilton (1762–1824), cousin of the American statesman of the same name, who had acquired an acquaintance with Sanskrit when in India and had brought out, along with Langlès, a descriptive catalogue of the Sanskrit manuscripts of the Imperial Library.

In the library, Bopp had access not only to the rich collection of Sanskrit manuscripts (mostly brought from India by Jean François Pons in the early 18th century), but also to the Sanskrit books that had been issued from the Calcutta and Serampore presses. He spent five years of laborious study, almost living in the libraries of Paris and unmoved by the turmoils that agitated the world around him, including Napoleon&#x27;s escape, the Waterloo campaign and the Restoration.

The first paper from his years of study in Paris appeared in Frankfurt am Main in 1816, under the title of &quot;Über das Konjugationssystem der Sanskritsprache in Vergleichung mit jenem der griechischen, lateinischen, persischen und germanischen Sprache (On the Conjugation System of Sanskrit in comparison with that of Greek, Latin, Persian and Germanic)&quot;, to which Windischmann contributed a preface. In this first book, Bopp entered at once the path on which he would focus the philological researches of his whole subsequent life. His task was not to point out the similarity of Sanskrit with Persian, Greek, Latin or German, for previous scholars had long established that, but he aimed to trace the postulated common origin of the languages&#x27; grammatical forms, of their inflections from composition. This was something no predecessor had attempted. By a historical analysis of those forms, as applied to the verb, he furnished the first trustworthy materials for a history of the languages compared.

After a brief sojourn in Germany, Bopp travelled to London where he made the acquaintance of Sir Charles Wilkins and Henry Thomas Colebrooke. He also became friends with Wilhelm von Humboldt, the Prussian ambassador at the Court of St. James&#x27;s, to whom he taught Sanskrit. He brought out, in the &quot;Annals of Oriental Literature&quot; (London, 1820), an essay entitled &quot;Analytical Comparison of the Sanskrit, Greek, Latin and Teutonic Languages&quot; in which he extended to all parts of grammar what he had done in his first book for the verb alone. He had previously published a critical edition, with a Latin translation and notes, of the story of Nala and Damayanti (London, 1819), the most beautiful episode of the &quot;Mahabharata&quot;. Other episodes of the &quot;Mahabharata&quot;, &quot;Indralokâgama&quot;, and three others (Berlin, 1824); &quot;Diluvium&quot;, and three others (Berlin, 1829); a new edition of Nala (Berlin, 1832) followed in due course, all of which, with August Wilhelm von Schlegel&#x27;s edition of the &quot;Bhagavad Gita&quot; (1823), proved excellent aids in initiating the early student into the reading of Sanskrit texts. On the publication, in Calcutta, of the whole &quot;Mahabharata&quot;, Bopp discontinued editing Sanskrit texts and confined himself thenceforth exclusively to grammatical investigations.

After a short residence at Göttingen, Bopp gained, on the recommendation of Humboldt, appointment to the chair of Sanskrit and comparative grammar at the University of Berlin in 1821, which he occupied for the rest of his life. He also became a member of the Royal Prussian Academy the following year.

In 1827, he published his &quot;Ausführliches Lehrgebäude der Sanskritsprache&quot; (&quot;Detailed System of the Sanskrit Language&quot;), on which he had worked since 1821. Bopp started work on a new edition in Latin, for the following year, completed in 1832; a shorter grammar appeared in 1834. At the same time he compiled a &quot;Sanskrit and Latin Glossary&quot; (1830), in which, more especially in the second and third editions (1847 and 1868–71), he also took account of the cognate languages. His chief activity, however, centered on the elaboration of his &quot;Comparative Grammar&quot;, which appeared in six parts at considerable intervals (Berlin, 1833, 1835, 1842, 1847, 1849, 1852), under the title &quot;Vergleichende Grammatik des Sanskrit, Zend, Griechischen, Lateinischen, Litthauischen, Altslawischen, Gotischen und Deutschen&quot; (&quot;Comparative Grammar of Sanskrit, Zend [Avestan], Greek, Latin, Lithuanian, Old Slavonic, Gothic and German&quot;).

How carefully Bopp matured this work emerges from the series of monographs printed in the &quot;Transactions of the Berlin Academy&quot; (1824–1831), which preceded it. They bear the general title &quot;Vergleichende Zergliederung des Sanskrits und der mit ihm verwandten Sprachen (Comparative Analysis of Sanskrit and its related Languages)&quot;. Two other essays (on the &quot;Numerals&quot;, 1835) followed the publication of the first part of the &quot;Comparative Grammar&quot;. Old Slavonian began to take its stand among the languages compared from the second part onwards. E. B. Eastwick translated the work into English in 1845. A second German edition, thoroughly revised (1856–1861), also covered Old Armenian.

In his &quot;Comparative Grammar&quot; Bopp set himself a threefold task:
#to give a description of the original grammatical structure of the languages as deduced from their inter-comparison.
#to trace their phonetic laws.
#to investigate the origin of their grammatical forms.

The first and second points remained dependent upon the third. As Bopp based his research on the best available sources and incorporated every new item of information that came to light, his work continued to widen and deepen in the making, as can be witnessed from his monographs on the vowel system in the Teutonic languages (1836), on the Celtic languages (1839), on the Old Prussian (1853) and Albanian languages (&quot;Über das Albanesische in seinen verwandtschaftlichen Beziehungen&quot;, Vienna, 1854), on the accent in Sanskrit and Greek (1854), on the relationship of the Malayo-Polynesian to the Indo-European languages (1840), and on the Caucasian languages (1846). In the last two, the impetus of his genius led him on a wrong track. He is the first philologist to prove Albanian as a separate branch of Indo-European. Bopp was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1855 and an international member of the American Philosophical Society in 1863.

==Criticism==
Critics have charged Bopp with neglecting the study of the native Sanskrit grammars, but in those early days of Sanskrit studies, the great libraries of Europe did not hold the requisite materials; if they had, those materials would have demanded his full attention for years, and such grammars as those of Charles Wilkins and Henry Thomas Colebrooke, from which Bopp derived his grammatical knowledge, had all used native grammars as a basis. The further charge that Bopp, in his &quot;Comparative Grammar&quot;, gave undue prominence to Sanskrit is disproved by his own words; for, as early as 1820, he gave it as his opinion that frequently, the cognate languages serve to elucidate grammatical forms lost in Sanskrit (&quot;Annals of Or. Lit.&quot; i. 3), which he further developed in all his subsequent writings.

The &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; (11th edition of 1911) assesses Bopp and his work as follows:

<doc id="11701" wikidata="Q243439" url="?curid=11701" title="Full Metal Jacket">
<text>Full Metal Jacket is a 1987 war film directed and produced by Stanley Kubrick from a screenplay he co-wrote with Michael Herr and Gustav Hasford. The film is based on Hasford&#x27;s 1979 autobiographical novel &quot;The Short-Timers&quot;. It stars Matthew Modine, R. Lee Ermey, Vincent D&#x27;Onofrio, Adam Baldwin, Dorian Harewood, and Arliss Howard.

The storyline follows a platoon of U.S. Marines through their boot camp training at Marine Corps Recruit Depot Parris Island, South Carolina. The first half of the film focuses primarily on privates J.T. Davis and Leonard Lawrence, nicknamed &quot;Joker&quot; and &quot;Pyle&quot; respectively, who struggle under their abusive drill instructor, Gunnery Sergeant Hartman. The second half portrays the experiences of Joker and other Marines in the Vietnamese cities of Da Nang and Huế during the Tet Offensive of the Vietnam War. The film&#x27;s title refers to the full metal jacket bullet used by military servicemen.

Warner Bros. released &quot;Full Metal Jacket&quot; in the United States on June 26, 1987. It was the last of Kubrick&#x27;s films to be released during his lifetime. The film received critical acclaim, grossed $120 million against a budget of $16.5–30 million and was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay. The film was also nominated for two BAFTA Awards, and Ermey was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor – Motion Picture for his performance. In 2001, the American Film Institute placed the film at number 95 in its poll titled &quot;AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Thrills.&quot;

==Plot==
During the Vietnam War, a group of USMC recruits arrive for basic training at Parris Island. Drill instructor Gunnery Sergeant Hartman uses harsh methods to train them for combat. Among the recruits are the wisecracking J. T. Davis, who receives the name &quot;Joker&quot; after interrupting Hartman&#x27;s introductory speech with an impression of John Wayne, and the overweight and dim-witted Leonard Lawrence, whom Hartman nicknames &quot;Gomer Pyle.&quot;

During boot camp, Hartman names Joker as squad leader and puts him in charge of helping Pyle improve. One evening while doing a hygiene inspection, Hartman notices that Pyle&#x27;s footlocker is unlocked. As he inspects it for signs of theft, he notices a jelly doughnut inside, blames the platoon for Pyle&#x27;s infractions and adopts a collective punishment policy by which any infraction committed by Pyle will earn a punishment for everyone else in the platoon. The next night, the recruits haze Pyle with a blanket party in which Joker reluctantly participates. Following this, Pyle appears to reinvent himself as a model recruit, showing particular expertise in marksmanship. This pleases Hartman but worries Joker, who believes Pyle may be suffering a mental breakdown after seeing Pyle talking to his rifle. The recruits graduate, but the night before they leave Parris Island, Joker, who is on fire watch duty, discovers Pyle in the barracks latrine loading his service rifle with live ammunition, executing drill commands, and loudly reciting the Rifleman&#x27;s Creed. Hartman is awakened by the commotion and attempts to intervene by ordering Pyle to give the rifle to him, but Pyle fatally shoots Hartman and then commits suicide in front of Joker.

Following Hartman&#x27;s death, Joker becomes a sergeant in January 1968 and is based in Da Nang for the newspaper &quot;Stars and Stripes&quot; alongside his colleague Private First Class &quot;Rafterman,&quot; a combat photographer. The Tet Offensive begins and the base is attacked, but holds. The following morning, Joker and Rafterman are sent to Phu Bai, where Joker searches for and reunites with Sergeant &quot;Cowboy,&quot; a friend he met at Parris Island. 

While reporting at a site where civilians were massacred, Joker is shouted to attention by a Marine Corps colonel who challenges Joker on the inconsistency of the peace symbol on his body armour, and the words &quot;Born To Kill&quot; on his helmet. Joker says he was trying to say something about the duality of man.

During the Battle of Huế, platoon leader Lieutenant Walter J. &quot;Touchdown&quot; Schinoski and a fellow Marine are killed by the NVA, who are eliminated soon after. Later, a booby trap kills the squad leader, Sergeant &quot;Crazy Earl,&quot; leaving Cowboy in command. Becoming lost in the city, the squad is ambushed by a Viet Cong sniper who kills two members, &quot;Eightball&quot; and &quot;Doc Jay.&quot; As the squad approaches the sniper&#x27;s location, Cowboy is killed.

Assuming command, squad machine gunner &quot;Animal Mother&quot; leads an attack on the sniper. Joker locates her first, but his M16 rifle jams, alerting the sniper to his presence. As the sniper opens fire, she is revealed to be a teenage girl. Rafterman shoots and mortally wounds her. As the squad converges on the sniper, she begs for death, leading to an argument over whether to kill her or leave her to die in pain. Animal Mother agrees to a mercy killing but only if Joker will handle it, and after some hesitation, Joker shoots her. Later, as night falls, the Marines march to the Perfume River singing the &quot;Mickey Mouse March&quot;. A narration of Joker&#x27;s thoughts conveys that, despite being &quot;in a world of shit&quot;, he is glad to be alive and no longer afraid.

==Cast==
* Matthew Modine as Private (later Sergeant) James T. &quot;Joker&quot; Davis, a wisecracking young Marine. On set, Modine kept a diary that in 2005 was adapted into a book and in 2013 into an interactive app.
* Adam Baldwin as Sergeant &quot;Animal Mother,&quot; a combat-hungry machine gunner who takes pride in killing enemy soldiers, and scorns any authority other than his own.
* Vincent D&#x27;Onofrio as Private Leonard &quot;Gomer Pyle&quot; Lawrence, an overweight, slow-minded recruit who is the subject of Hartman&#x27;s mockery. D&#x27;Onofrio heard from Modine of the auditions for the film. D&#x27;Onofrio recorded his audition using a rented video camera and was dressed in army fatigues. According to Kubrick, Pyle was &quot;the hardest part to cast in the whole movie&quot;; Modine suggested D&#x27;Onofrio to Kubrick, so he cast him in the part. D&#x27;Onofrio was required to gain .
* R. Lee Ermey (credited as &quot;Lee Ermey&quot;) as Gunnery Sergeant L. Hartman, a harsh, foul-mouthed and ruthless senior drill instructor. Ermey used his actual experience as a U.S. Marines drill instructor in the Vietnam War to improvise much of his dialogue.
* Dorian Harewood as Corporal &quot;Eightball,&quot; a member of the squad and Animal Mother&#x27;s friend.
* Arliss Howard as Private (later Sergeant) &quot;Cowboy&quot; Evans, a friend of Joker and a member of the Lusthog Squad.
* Kevyn Major Howard as Private First Class &quot;Rafterman,&quot; a combat photographer.
* Ed O&#x27;Ross as First Lieutenant Walter J. &quot;Touchdown&quot; Schinoski, the Lusthog Squad&#x27;s platoon leader.
* John Terry as First Lieutenant Lockhart, the editor of &quot;Stars and Stripes&quot;.
* Kieron Jecchinis as Sergeant &quot;Crazy Earl,&quot; the first Lusthog Squad leader.
* Bruce Boa as the Colonel who scolds Joker for writing “Born to Kill” and simultaneously wearing a peace symbol on his lapel.
* Kirk Taylor as Private &quot;Payback&quot;
* John Stafford as &quot;Doc Jay,&quot; a Navy hospital corpsman providing medical support for the squad.
* Tim Colceri as a ruthless and sadistic helicopter door gunner who suggests that Joker and Rafterman write a story about him. Colceri, a former Marine, was originally slated to play Hartman, a role that went to Ermey. Kubrick gave Colceri this smaller part as a consolation.
* Ian Tyler as Lieutenant Cleves, an officer present at the uncovering of a mass grave.
* Gary Landon Mills as Donlon, a squad member who works as a radio operator.
* Sal Lopez as &quot;T.H.E. Rock&quot;
* Papillon Soo Soo as a Da Nang prostitute
* Ngoc Le as the Viet Cong sniper
* Peter Edmund as Private &quot;Snowball&quot; Brown, a recruit in Hartman&#x27;s platoon.
* Antu N&#x27;Jai as a recruit.
* Steve Boucher as a recruit.

==Themes==
Michael Pursell&#x27;s essay &quot;&quot;Full Metal Jacket&quot;: The Unravelling of Patriarchy&quot; (1988) was an early, in-depth consideration of the film&#x27;s two-part structure and its criticism of masculinity. Pursell wrote that the film shows &quot;war and pornography as facets of the same system&quot;.

Many reviewers praised the military brainwashing themes in the boot-camp portion of the film while viewing the film&#x27;s second half as more confusing and disjointed. Rita Kempley of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote, &quot;it&#x27;s as if they borrowed bits of every war movie to make this eclectic finale.&quot; Roger Ebert saw the film as an attempt to tell a story of individual characters and the war&#x27;s effects on them. According to Ebert, the result is a shapeless film that feels &quot;more like a book of short stories than a novel&quot;. Julian Rice, in his book &quot;Kubrick&#x27;s Hope&quot; (2008), saw the second part of the film as a continuation of Joker&#x27;s psychic journey in his attempt to understand human evil.

Tony Lucia, in his 1987 review of &quot;Full Metal Jacket&quot; for the &quot;Reading Eagle&quot;, examined the themes of Kubrick&#x27;s career, suggesting &quot;the unifying element may be the ordinary man dwarfed by situations too vast and imposing to handle&quot;. Lucia refers to the &quot;military mentality&quot; in this film and also said the theme covers &quot;a man testing himself against his own limitations&quot;, and concluded: &quot;&quot;Full Metal Jacket&quot; is the latest chapter in an ongoing movie which is not merely a comment on our time or a time past, but on something that reaches beyond.&quot;

British critic Gilbert Adair wrote, &quot;Kubrick&#x27;s approach to language has always been reductive and uncompromisingly deterministic in nature. He appears to view it as the exclusive product of environmental conditioning, only very marginally influenced by concepts of subjectivity and interiority, by all the whims, shades and modulations of personal expression.&quot;

Michael Herr wrote of his work on the screenplay, &quot;The substance was single-minded, the old and always serious problem of how you put into a film or a book the living, behaving presence of what Jung called the shadow, the most accessible of archetypes, and the easiest to experience ... War is the ultimate field of Shadow-activity, where all of its other activities lead you. As they expressed it in Vietnam, &#x27;Yea, though I walk through the Valley of the Shadow of Death, I will fear no Evil, for I the Evil&#x27;.&quot;

==Production==

===Development===

In early 1980, Kubrick contacted Michael Herr, author of the Vietnam War memoir &quot;Dispatches&quot; (1977), to discuss work on a film about the Holocaust but Kubrick discarded that idea in favor of a film about the Vietnam War. Herr and Kubrick met in England; Kubrick told Herr he wanted to make a war film but had yet to find a story to adapt. Kubrick discovered Gustav Hasford&#x27;s novel &quot;The Short-Timers&quot; (1979) while reading the &quot;Kirkus Review&quot;. Herr received the novel in bound galleys and thought it a masterpiece. In 1982, Kubrick read the novel twice; he concluded it is &quot;a unique, absolutely wonderful book&quot; and decided to adapt it for his next film. According to Kubrick, he was drawn to the book&#x27;s dialogue, which he found &quot;almost poetic in its carved-out, stark quality&quot;. In 1983, Kubrick began researching for the film; he watched archival footage and documentaries, read Vietnamese newspapers on microfilm from the Library of Congress, and studied hundreds of photographs from the era. Initially, Herr was not interested in revisiting his Vietnam War experiences, but Kubrick spent three years persuading him, describing the discussions as &quot;a single phone call lasting three years, with interruptions&quot;.

In 1985, Kubrick contacted Hasford and invited him to join the team; they spoke by telephone three to four times a week for hours at a time. Kubrick had already written a detailed treatment of the novel, and they met at Kubrick&#x27;s home every day, breaking the treatment into scenes. Herr then wrote the first draft of the film script. Kubrick worried the audience might misread the book&#x27;s title as a reference to people who did only half a day&#x27;s work and changed it to &quot;Full Metal Jacket&quot; after coming across the phrase in a gun catalogue. After the first draft was complete, Kubrick telephoned his orders to Hasford and Herr, who mailed their submissions to him. Kubrick read and edited Hasford&#x27;s and Herr&#x27;s submissions, and the team repeated the process. Neither Hasford nor Herr knew how much each had contributed to the screenplay, which led to a dispute over the final credits. Hasford said: &quot;We were like guys on an assembly line in the car factory. I was putting on one widget and Michael was putting on another widget and Stanley was the only one who knew that this was going to end up being a car.&quot; Herr said Kubrick was not interested in making an anti-war film but &quot;he wanted to show what war is like&quot;.

At some point, Kubrick wanted to meet Hasford in person, but Herr advised against this, describing &quot;The Short-Timers&quot; author as a &quot;scary man, a big, haunted marine&quot;, and did not believe Hasford and Kubrick would &quot;get on&quot;. Kubrick, however, insisted on the meeting, which occurred at Kubrick&#x27;s house in England. The meeting went poorly; Kubrick privately told Herr: &quot;I can&#x27;t deal with this man,&quot; and Hasford did not meet with Kubrick again.

===Casting===

Through Warner Bros., Kubrick advertised a casting search in the United States and Canada. He used videotape to audition actors and received over 3,000 submissions. Kubrick&#x27;s staff screened the tapes, leaving 800 of them for him to review.

Former U.S. Marines drill instructor Lee Ermey was originally hired as a technical advisor. Ermey asked Kubrick if he could audition for the role of Hartman. Kubrick, who had seen Ermey&#x27;s portrayal of drill instructor Staff Sergeant Loyce in &quot;The Boys in Company C&quot; (1978), told Ermey that he was not vicious enough to play the character. Ermey improvised insulting dialogue against a group of Royal Marines who were being considered for the part of background Marines in order to demonstrate his ability to play the character and to show how a drill instructor attacks individuality in new recruits. Upon viewing the videotape of these sessions, Kubrick offered Ermey the role, realizing he &quot;was a genius for this part&quot;. Kubrick incorporated the 250-page transcript of Ermey&#x27;s rants into the script. Ermey&#x27;s experience as a drill instructor during the Vietnam War proved invaluable; Kubrick estimated that Ermey wrote 50% of his character&#x27;s dialogue, particularly the insults.

While Ermey practiced his lines in a rehearsal room, Kubrick&#x27;s assistant Leon Vitali would throw tennis balls and oranges at him, which Ermey had to catch and throw back as quickly as possible while saying his lines as fast as he could. Any hesitation, slowdown, slip or missed line would necessitate restarting, and 20 error-free runs were required. &quot;[He] was my drill instructor,&quot; Ermey said of Vitali.

Nine months of negotiations to cast Anthony Michael Hall as Private Joker were unsuccessful; Hall would later regret not doing the film. Val Kilmer was also considered for the role, and Bruce Willis declined a role because of commitments to his television series &quot;Moonlighting&quot;. Kubrick offered Ed Harris the role of Hartman but Harris declined it, a decision that he later called &quot;foolish&quot;. Robert De Niro was also considered for the role, although Kubrick eventually felt that the audience would &quot;feel cheated&quot; if De Niro&#x27;s character were killed in the first hour. Bill McKinney was also considered for the part, but Kubrick professed an irrational fear of the actor. McKinney was known for his role as a rural psychopath in 1972&#x27;s &quot;Deliverance&quot;, most memorably in a sequence that Kubrick described as &quot;the most terrifying scene ever put on film&quot;. McKinney was about to fly from Los Angeles to London to audition for Kubrick and the producers when he received a message at the airport informing him that his audition had been canceled. However, McKinney was paid in full. Denzel Washington showed interest in the film but Kubrick did not send him a script.

===Filming===
Principal photography began on August 27, 1985, and concluded on August 8, 1986. Scenes were filmed in Cambridgeshire, the Norfolk Broads, in eastern London at Millennium Mills and Beckton Gas Works in Newham and on the Isle of Dogs. Kubrick hired Anton Furst as the production designer, impressed by his work on &quot;The Company of Wolves&quot; (1984). Bassingbourn Barracks, a former Royal Air Force station and then a British Army base, was used as the Parris Island Marines boot camp. A British army rifle range near Barton, Cambridge was used for the scene in which Hartman congratulates Private Pyle for his shooting skills. Kubrick and Furst worked from still photographs of Huế taken in 1968. Kubrick found an area owned by British Gas that closely resembled it and was scheduled to be demolished. The disused Beckton Gas Works, a few miles from central London, was filmed to depict Huế after attacks. Kubrick had buildings demolished and the film&#x27;s art director used a wrecking ball to knock holes in some of the buildings over the course of two months. Kubrick had a plastic replica jungle delivered from California, but once he saw it, he dismissed the idea, saying; &quot;I don&#x27;t like it. Get rid of it.&quot; The open country scenes were filmed at marshland in Cliffe-at-Hoo and along the River Thames. Locations were decorated with 200 palm trees imported from Spain and 100,000 plastic tropical plants from Hong Kong.

Kubrick acquired four M41 tanks from a Belgian army colonel who was an admirer of his work. Westland Wessex helicopters, which have a much longer and less-rounded nose than that of the Vietnam era H-34, were painted Marines green to represent Sikorsky H-34 Choctaw helicopters. Kubrick obtained a selection of rifles, M79 grenade launchers and M60 machine guns from a licensed weapons dealer.

Modine described the filming as difficult. Beckton Gas Works was a toxic environment for the film crew, being contaminated with asbestos and hundreds of other chemicals. During the boot camp sequence of the film, Modine and the other recruits underwent Marine Corps training, during which Ermey yelled at them for 10 hours a day while filming the Parris Island scenes. To ensure that the actors&#x27; reactions to Ermey&#x27;s lines were as authentic and fresh as possible, Ermey and the recruits did not rehearse together. For film continuity, each recruit had his head shaved once a week.

Modine fought with Kubrick about whether he could leave the set to be with his pregnant wife in the delivery room. Modine threatened to cut himself and get sent to the hospital himself to force Kubrick to relent. He also nearly fought with D&#x27;Onofrio during filming the boot camp scenes after he taunted D&#x27;Onofrio while laughing with the film&#x27;s extras between takes.

During filming, Ermey was injured in a car crash and broke several ribs, leaving him unavailable for four and a half months.

During Cowboy&#x27;s death scene, a building that resembles the alien monolith in Kubrick&#x27;s &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot; (1968) is visible. Kubrick described this as an &quot;extraordinary accident&quot;.

During filming, Hasford contemplated legal action over the writing credits. Originally, the filmmakers intended Hasford to receive an &quot;additional dialogue&quot; credit, but he fought for and eventually received full credit. Hasford and two friends visited the set dressed as extras but was mistaken by a crew member for Herr. Hasford identified himself as the writer of the source material.

Kubrick&#x27;s daughter Vivian, who appears uncredited as a news camera operator, shadowed the filming of &quot;Full Metal Jacket&quot;. She filmed 18 hours of behind-the-scenes footage for a potential &quot;making-of&quot; documentary that went unmade. Sections of her work can be seen in the documentary &quot;Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s Boxes&quot; (2008).

==Music==
Vivian Kubrick, under the alias Abigail Mead, wrote the film&#x27;s score. According to an interview in the January 1988 issue of &quot;Keyboard&quot;, the film was scored mostly with a Series III edition Fairlight CMI synthesizer and a Synclavier. For the period music, Kubrick reviewed &quot;Billboard&quot; list of the top 100 hits for each year from 1962 to 1968, considering many songs but finding that &quot;sometimes the dynamic range of the music was too great, and we couldn&#x27;t work in dialogue.&quot;

The single reached #1 in Ireland, #2 in the UK, #4 in both the Netherlands and the Flanders region of Belgium, #8 in West Germany, #11 in Sweden and #29 in New Zealand.

==Release==

===Box office===
&quot;Full Metal Jacket&quot; received a limited release on June 26, 1987, in 215 theaters. During its opening weekend, it accrued $2.2 million, an average of $10,313 per theater, ranking it the number 10 film for the weekend June 26–28. It took a further $2 million for a total of $5.7 million before being widely released in 881 theaters on July 10, 1987. The weekend of July 10–12 saw the film gross $6.1 million, an average of $6,901 per theater, and rank as the second-highest-grossing film. Over the next four weeks the film opened in a further 194 theaters to its widest release of 1,075 theaters; it closed two weeks later with a total gross of $46.4 million, making it the twenty-third-highest-grossing film of 1987. , the film had grossed $120 million worldwide.

===Home media===

The home media release history of &quot;Full Metal Jacket&quot; is summarized in the following table. Minor cuts to the 1h 57m theatrical version were made to comply with the censor boards overseeing the various territories in which the film was released. For technical reasons the PAL mastering standard speeds up playback by around 4% compared with NTSC, leading to slightly shorter runtimes (around 1h 52m) in releases mastered for territories other than the US and Japan.
The 2020 4K UHD release uses a new HDR remastered native 2160p that was transferred from the original 35mm negative, which was supervised by Kubrick&#x27;s personal assistant Leon Vitali. It contains the remixed audio and, for the first time since the original DVD release, the theatrical mono mix. The release was a critical success; publications praised its image and audio quality, calling the former exceptionally good and faithful to the original theatrical release, and Kubrick&#x27;s vision while noting the lack of new extras and bonus content. A collector&#x27;s edition box set of this 4K UHD version was released with different cover art, a replica theatrical poster of the film, a letter from director Stanley Kubrick, and a booklet about the film&#x27;s production among other extras.

==Reception==
===Critical reception===
Review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes retrospectively collected reviews to give the film a score of 90% based on reviews from 84 critics and an average rating of 8.3/10. The summary states; &quot;Intense, tightly constructed, and darkly comic at times, Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s &quot;Full Metal Jacket&quot; may not boast the most original of themes, but it is exceedingly effective at communicating them.&quot; Another aggregator, Metacritic, gave it a score of 76 out of 100 based on 19 reviews, which indicates a &quot;generally favorable&quot; response. Reviewers generally reacted favorably to the cast—Ermey in particular— and the film&#x27;s first act about recruit training. Several reviews, however, were critical of the latter part of the film, which is set in Vietnam, and what was considered a &quot;muddled&quot; moral message in the finale.

Richard Corliss of &quot;Time&quot; called the film a &quot;technical knockout&quot;, praising &quot;the dialogue&#x27;s wild, desperate wit; the daring in choosing a desultory skirmish to make a point about war&#x27;s pointlessness,&quot; and &quot;the fine, large performances of almost every actor&quot;, saying Ermey and D&#x27;Onofrio would receive Oscar nominations. Corliss appreciated &quot;the Olympian elegance and precision of Kubrick&#x27;s filmmaking.&quot; &quot;Empire&quot;″s Ian Nathan awarded the film three stars out of five, saying it is &quot;inconsistent&quot; and describing it as &quot;both powerful and frustratingly unengaged&quot;. Nathan said after the opening act, which concerns the recruit training, the film becomes &quot;bereft of purpose&quot;; nevertheless, he summarized his review by calling it a &quot;hardy Kubrickian effort that warms on you with repeated viewings&quot; and praised Ermey&#x27;s &quot;staggering performance&quot;. Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; called the film &quot;harrowing, beautiful and characteristically eccentric&quot;. Canby echoed praise for Ermey, calling him &quot;the film&#x27;s stunning surprise ... he&#x27;s so good—so obsessed—that you might think he wrote his own lines.&quot; Canby said D&#x27;Onofrio&#x27;s performance should be admired and described Modine as &quot;one of the best, most adaptable young film actors of his generation&quot;, and concluded &quot;Full Metal Jacket&quot; is &quot;a film of immense and very rare imagination&quot;.

Jim Hall, writing for Film4 in 2010, awarded the film five stars out of five and added to the praise for Ermey, saying his &quot;performance as the foul-mouthed Hartman is justly celebrated and it&#x27;s difficult to imagine the film working anything like as effectively without him.&quot; The review preferred the opening training segment to the later Vietnam sequence, calling it &quot;far more striking than the second and longer section&quot;. Hall commented the film ends abruptly but felt &quot;it demonstrates just how clear and precise the director&#x27;s vision could be when he resisted a fatal tendency for indulgence.&quot; Hall concluded; &quot;&quot;Full Metal Jacket&quot; ranks with &quot;Dr. Strangelove&quot; as one of Kubrick&#x27;s very best.&quot; Jonathan Rosenbaum of the &quot;Chicago Reader&quot; called it &quot;Elliptical, full of subtle inner rhymes ... and profoundly moving, this is the most tightly crafted Kubrick film since &quot;Dr. Strangelove&quot;, as well as the most horrific.&quot; &quot;Variety&quot; called the film an &quot;intense, schematic, superbly made&quot; drama that is &quot;loaded with vivid, outrageously vulgar military vernacular that contributes heavily to the film&#x27;s power&quot; but said it never develops &quot;a particularly strong narrative&quot;. The cast performances were all labeled &quot;exceptional&quot;; Modine was singled out as &quot;embodying both what it takes to survive in the war and a certain omniscience&quot;. Gilbert Adair, writing about &quot;Full Metal Jacket&quot;, commented: &quot;Kubrick&#x27;s approach to language has always been of a reductive and uncompromisingly deterministic nature. He appears to view it as the exclusive product of environmental conditioning, only very marginally influenced by concepts of subjectivity and interiority, by all whims, shades and modulations of personal expression.&quot;

&quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; critic Roger Ebert called &quot;Full Metal Jacket&quot; &quot;strangely shapeless&quot; and awarded it two and a half stars out of four. Ebert called it &quot;one of the best-looking war movies ever made on sets and stage&quot; but said this was not enough to compete with the &quot;awesome reality of &quot;Platoon&quot;, &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot; and &quot;The Deer Hunter&quot;.&quot; Ebert criticized the film&#x27;s Vietnam-set second act, saying the &quot;movie disintegrates into a series of self-contained set pieces, none of them quite satisfying&quot; and concluded the film&#x27;s message is &quot;too little and too late&quot;, having been done by other Vietnam war films. Ebert praised Ermey and D&#x27;Onofrio, saying: &quot;These are the two best performances in the movie, which never recovers after they leave the scene.&quot; Ebert&#x27;s review angered Gene Siskel on their television show &quot;At The Movies&quot;; he criticized Ebert for liking &quot;Benji the Hunted&quot; more than &quot;Full Metal Jacket&quot;. &quot;Time Out London&quot; disliked the film, saying: &quot;Kubrick&#x27;s direction is as steely cold and manipulative as the régime it depicts,&quot; and that the characters are underdeveloped, adding &quot;we never really get to know, let alone care about, the hapless recruits on view&quot;.

Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B+&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

British television channel Channel 4 voted &quot;Full Metal Jacket&quot; fifth on its list of the greatest war films ever made. In 2008, &quot;Empire&quot; placed the film at number 457 on its list of &quot;The 500 Greatest Movies of All Time.&quot; In 2010, &quot;The Guardian&quot; ranked it 19th on its list of the &quot;25 best action and war films of all time.&quot; The film is ranked 95 on the American Film Institute&#x27;s 100 Years... 100 Thrills list, which was published in 2001.

===Accolades===
Between 1987 and 1989, &quot;Full Metal Jacket&quot; was nominated for eleven awards, including an Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay, two BAFTA Awards for Best Sound and Best Special Effects, and a Golden Globe for Best Supporting Actor for Ermey. It won five awards, including three from overseas; Best Foreign Language Film from the Japanese Academy, Best Producer from the Academy of Italian Cinema, Director of the Year at the London Critics Circle Film Awards and Best Director and Best Supporting Actor at the Boston Society of Film Critics Awards for Kubrick and Ermey respectively. Of the five awards it won, four were awarded to Kubrick and the other was given to Ermey.

==Differences between novel and screenplay==
Film scholar Greg Jenkins has analyzed the adaptation of the novel as a screenplay. The novel is in three parts and the film greatly expands the relatively brief first section about the boot camp on Parris Island and essentially discards Part III. This gives the film a twofold structure, telling two largely independent stories that are connected by the same characters. Jenkins said this structure is a development of concepts Kubrick originally discussed in the 1960s, when he talked about wanting to explode the usual conventions of narrative structure.

Sergeant Hartman, who is renamed from the book&#x27;s Gerheim, has an expanded role in the film. Private Pyle&#x27;s incompetence is presented as weighing negatively on the rest of the platoon; unlike the novel, he is the only under-performing recruit. The film omits Gerheim&#x27;s disclosure that he thinks Pyle might be mentally unstable—a &quot;Section 8&quot;—to the other troops; instead, Joker questions Pyle&#x27;s mental state. In contrast, Hartman praises Pyle, saying he is &quot;born again hard&quot;. Jenkins says that portraying Hartman as having a warmer social relationship with the troops would have upset the balance of the film, which depends on the spectacle of ordinary soldiers coming to grips with Hartman as a force of nature who embodies a killer culture.

Some scenes in the book were removed from the screenplay or conflated with others. For example, Cowboy&#x27;s introduction of the &quot;Lusthog Squad&quot; was markedly shortened and supplemented with material from other sections of the book. Although the book&#x27;s third section was largely omitted, elements from it were inserted into other parts of the film. For instance, the climactic episode with the sniper is a conflation of two sections of Parts II and III of the book. According to Jenkins, the film presents this passage more dramatically but in less gruesome detail than the novel.

The film often has a more tragic tone than the book, which relies on callous humor. In the film, Joker remains a model of humane thinking, as evidenced by his moral struggle in the sniper scene and elsewhere. Joker works to overcome his own meekness rather than compete with other Marines. The film omits Joker&#x27;s eventual domination over Animal Mother shown in the book.

The film also omits Rafterman&#x27;s death; according to Jenkins, this allows viewers to reflect on Rafterman&#x27;s personal growth and speculate on his future growth after the war.

==In popular culture==
The line &quot;Me so horny. Me love you long time,&quot; which is uttered by the Da Nang street prostitute to Joker, became a catchphrase in popular culture and was sampled by rap artists 2 Live Crew in their 1989 hit &quot;Me So Horny&quot; and by Sir Mix-A-Lot in &quot;Baby Got Back&quot; (1992). Stand-up comic Margaret Cho used a similar quote in her solo show Notorious C.H.O. when describing how she felt as a child that her goal of one day working as a professional actress would be limited due to the lack of representation of Asian performers in popular culture, suggesting she considered she might someday play a sex worker in a film.

<text>Flirting or coquetry is a social and sexual behavior involving body language, or spoken or written communication between humans. It is used to suggest interest in a deeper relationship with another person and for amusement. Flirting can change in intention as well as intensity, whether it is harmless fun, or employed with the design of seeking a romantic or sexual relationship. 

A person might flirt with another by speaking or behaving in such a way that suggests their desire to increase intimacy in their current relationship with that person. The approach may include communicating a sense of playfulness, irony, or by using double entendres.


== Etymology ==
The origin of the word &quot;&quot; is unknown. The first use of the word dates to 1580—with the intransitive &quot;&quot; and the noun form—ca 1590—with the transitive &quot;&quot;.

Flirt has been attributed to the French &quot;&quot;, meaning to woo. &quot;Fleurette&quot;, meaning small flower, was used in the 16th century in some sonnets and texts, and has since fallen out of use. This expression is still used in French, often mockingly, although the English loanword, &quot;to flirt&quot;&quot;,&quot; is in the common vernacular. Flirting in the English language has the same meaning as to &quot;conter fleurette&quot;.

== Historical context ==
During World War II, anthropologist Margaret Mead was working in Britain for the British Ministry of Information and later for the U.S. Office of War Information, delivering speeches and writing articles to help American soldiers better understand British civilians, and vice versa. Mead found a pattern of misunderstandings in the flirtations between American soldiers and British women regarding who was supposed to take which initiative. She wrote of the Americans, &quot;The boy learns to make advances and rely upon the girl to repulse them whenever they are inappropriate to the state of feeling between the pair&quot;, as contrasted to the British, where &quot;the girl is reared to depend upon a slight barrier of chilliness... which the boys learn to respect, and for the rest to rely upon the men to approach or advance, as warranted by the situation.&quot; When flirting with each other, British women could interpret an American soldier&#x27;s gregariousness as something more intimate or serious than he had intended.

Communications theorist Paul Watzlawick researched courtship behaviors between English women and North American servicemen in late- to post-WWII, finding common misunderstandings of intent. The simple act of kissing during the &#x27;wrong stage&#x27; of the courtship often led both parties to believe the other was being too forward, too soon.

== Purpose ==

According to social anthropologist Kate Fox, there are two main types of flirting: flirting for fun, and flirting with further intent. In a 2014 review, sociologist David Henningsen identified six main motivations for flirting: sex, relational development, exploration, fun, self-esteem, and as a means to an end. Henningsen found that many flirting interactions involve more than one of these motives.

=== Human mating strategy ===

Many studies have confirmed that sex is a motivation for flirting. A study by Messman and colleagues demonstrated that the more one was physically attracted to a person, the higher the chances one would flirt with them.

Many people flirt as a courtship initiation method. The person flirting will send out signals of sexual availability to another, and expects to see the interest returned in order to continue flirting. Flirting can involve non-verbal signs, such as an exchange of glances, hand-touching, and hair-touching; or verbal signs, such as chatting, giving flattering comments, and exchanging telephone numbers in order to initiate further contact. 

===Covert signaling===
Human flirting is typically more covert compared to the typically overt courtship display of animals. If the main purpose of flirting is to signal interest to another person, then one might expect that the signaling would be done clearly and explicitly. An explanation for the ambiguous nature of human flirting lies in the costs associated with courtship. According to Gersick and colleagues, signaling interest can be socially costly, such as risking existing friendship or affect social reputation. The costs associated with interest signaling may be magnified in humans compared to the animal world, as the existence of language means information can circulate much further. For instance, information overheard by an eavesdropper can be spread to large social networks, thereby magnifying the social costs. 

Flirting can assess whether other person might be interested in reciprocating while maintaining plausible deniability to reduce social costs. Online flirting can reduce perceived risks.

=== Gendered purpose===

Certain types of flirting seem to vary by gender. Henningsen and colleagues&#x27; study demonstrated that flirting with sexual intent was found to be more prominent amongst men while flirting for relationship development purposes was more often employed by women. Henningsen also found that women may engage in &quot;practice flirting,&quot; that is, behavior to evaluate potential partners.

The parental investment theory predicts based on evolutionary biology in case of a risk of pregnancy with gender differences in parental investment, that females would be more selective than males and courtship would be more commonly initiated by males. In case of no risk of pregnancy this gendered effect is predicted to be reduced.

Flirting can follow gender egalitarian norms.

===Other motivations ===
Henningsen and Fox showed that flirting can sometimes be used just for fun. People may engage in flirting to consolidate or maintain a romantic relationship with their partner.

== Misinterpretation and consent ==
Flirting is often performed subtly, and evidence shows that people are often mistaken in how they interpret flirting behaviors. 

Without consent or implied consent by the receiving party, some flirting behavior, such as double entendres, can be viewed as sexual harassment.

== Cultural variations ==
Flirting behavior varies between cultures due to different modes of social etiquette, such as how closely people should stand, how long to hold eye contact, how much touching is appropriate and so forth. Nonetheless, some behaviors may be universal. Ethologist Irenäus Eibl-Eibesfeldt discovered that women from different continents (Africa and North America) behave similarly in some ways when flirting, such as nonchalantly breaking their gaze and smiling after first staring for a prolonged period of time.

In &quot;contact cultures,&quot; such as those in the Mediterranean or Latin America, closer proximity is common, compared with cultures such as those in Britain or Northern Europe. The variation in social norms may lead to different interpretations of what is considered to be flirting.

Japanese courtesans had another form of flirting, emphasizing non-verbal relationships by hiding the lips and showing the eyes, as depicted in much Shunga art, the most popular print media at the time, until the late 19th century. In Japan, flirting in the street or public places is known as &quot;nanpa&quot;.

The fan was extensively used as a means of communication and therefore a way of flirting from the 16th century onwards in some European societies, especially England and Spain. A whole sign language was developed with the use of the fan, and etiquette books and magazines were published. Charles Francis Badini created the Original Fanology or Ladies&#x27; Conversation Fan, which was published by William Cock in London in 1797. The use of the fan was not limited to women, as men also carried fans and learned how to convey messages with them. For instance, placing the fan near the heart meant &quot;I love you&quot;, while opening a fan wide meant &quot;Wait for me&quot;.

In Spain, ladies used fans to communicate with suitors or prospective suitors without attracting the notice of their families or chaperons. This use was highly popular during the 19th and early 20th centuries.

<text>Franklin James Schaffner (May 30, 1920July 2, 1989) was an American film, television, and stage director. He won the Academy Award for Best Director for &quot;Patton&quot; (1970), and is known for the films &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot; (1968), &quot;Nicholas and Alexandra&quot; (1971), &quot;Papillon&quot; (1973), and &quot;The Boys from Brazil&quot; (1978). He served as president of the Directors Guild of America between 1987 and 1989.

==Early life==
Schaffner was born in Tokyo, Japan, the son of American missionaries Sarah Horting (née Swords) and Paul Franklin Schaffner, and was raised in Japan.

The Schaffners returned to the United States and settled in Lancaster, Pennsylvania when Franklin Schaffner was 5 years old. Franklin Schaffner attended J.P. McCaskey High School, where he appeared as Mr. Darcy in the school&#x27;s production of &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot;. In 1938, he graduated as valedictorian of McCaskey High School&#x27;s first graduating class.

Schaffner graduated from Franklin &amp; Marshall College (F&amp;M) in Lancaster. As a student, Schaffner was active in the drama program at F&amp;M&#x27;s Green Room Theatre, where he appeared in eleven plays and served as president of the Green Room Club. He then studied law at Columbia University in New York City, but his education was interrupted by service with the U.S. Navy in World War II during which he served with amphibious forces in Europe and North Africa. In the latter stages of the war, he was sent to the Pacific Far East to serve with the Office of Strategic Services.

==Television career==
Schaffner returned to the United States after the war. He worked for a world peace organization, then as an assistant director for the documentary film series &quot;The March of Time&quot;. He became a director in the news and public affairs department of CBS television, where his jobs including covering sports, beauty pageants and public-service programs.

In 1950 he directed &quot;The Traitor&quot;, the first episode of &quot;Ford Theatre&quot;. He also did adaptations of &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; and &quot;Treasure Island&quot;.

He directed &quot;Thunder on Sycamore Street&quot; by Reginald Rose for &quot;Studio One&quot;. He and Rose reunited on &quot;Twelve Angry Men&quot; which won Schaffner an Emmy for Best Director.

The following year Schaffner earned another Emmy for his work on the 1955 TV adaptation of the Broadway play &quot;The Caine Mutiny Court-Martial&quot;, shown on the anthology series &quot;Ford Star Jubilee&quot;.

Schaffner became one of three regular directors on &quot;The Kaiser Aluminum Hour&quot;; the others were George Roy Hill and Fielder Cook. He was also a regular director on &quot;Playhouse 90&quot;.

He was the original director on the series, &quot;The Defenders&quot;, created by Rose. Schaffner&#x27;s work earned him another Emmy.

In 1960, he directed Allen Drury&#x27;s stage play &quot;Advise and Consent&quot;. This earned him the Best Director recognition in the Variety Critics Poll.

In the realm of network television, Schaffner also received widespread critical acclaim in 1962 for his groundbreaking collaboration with the First Lady of the United States Jacqueline Kennedy and CBS television&#x27;s Musical Director Alfredo Antonini in the production of &quot;A Tour of the White House with Mrs. John F. Kennedy&quot;, a television special broadcast to over 80 million viewers worldwide.

Schaffner&#x27;s contributions in this production earned him a nomination in 1963 by the Directors Guild of America, for its award in the category of Outstanding Directorial Achievement in Television.

==Feature films==
===Early films===
In January 1960 Schaffner signed a multi picture deal with Columbia Pictures.

In May 1961 he signed to make &quot;A Summer Place&quot; at 20th Century Fox with Fabian and Dolores Hart. The film was not made. Schaffner directed &quot;The Good Years&quot; (1962) for TV with Henry Fonda and Lucille Ball. Other TV work included &quot;The Great American Robbery&quot;.

Instead Schaffner&#x27;s first motion picture was &quot;The Stripper&quot; (1963), made at Fox from a play by William Inge, starring Richard Beymer and Joanne Woodward. The film was well-received critically, but not a commercial success.

He continued to work for TV including &quot;The Legend of Lylah Clare&quot;.

Schaffner later made &quot;The Best Man&quot; (1964) based on a play by Gore Vidal and &quot;The War Lord&quot; (1965), based on a play by Leslie Stevens, with Charlton Heston. In a 1966 interview he said &quot;as you mature you learn that the story is the most important thing.&quot; He announced various films for Columbia – &quot;The Day Lincoln Was Shot&quot;, &quot;The Whistle Blows for Victory&quot; and &quot;The Green Beret&quot; – but they were not made.

He went to Britain to make &quot;The Double Man&quot; (1967) with Yul Brynner, a film Schaffner admitted he did for the money.

===Peak===
Schaffner had a huge critical and commercial hit in &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot; (1968) starring Heston at 20th Century Fox.

In December 1968 Schaffner signed a non-exclusive three-picture deal with Columbia.

His next film was for 20th Century Fox, however: &quot;Patton&quot; (1970), a biopic of General Patton starring George C. Scott. It was a major success for which Schaffner won the Academy Award for Best Director and the Directors Guild of America Award for Best Director.

He made &quot;Nicholas and Alexandra&quot; (1971) for producer Sam Spiegel. It was an expensive box-office failure. Schaffner followed it with &quot;Papillon&quot; (1973) a $14 million epic with Steve McQueen and Dustin Hoffman that was a considerable financial success. In 1971 he said his films &quot;are almost always about people who are out of their time and place.&quot;

Schaffner intended to follow &quot;Papillon&quot; with &quot;Dynasty of Western Outlaws&quot;, about outlaws over the years in Missouri from a script by John Gay, and an adaptation of &quot;The French Lieutenant&#x27;s Woman&quot;. He ended up making neither: &quot;Dynasty&quot; was never made, and &quot;French Lieutenant&quot; was made a decade later by another director.

Schaffner reunited with George C. Scott in &quot;Islands in the Stream&quot; (1977), based on the novel by Ernest Hemingway. He then did &quot;The Boys from Brazil&quot; (1978) based on a novel by Ira Levin with Gregory Peck and Laurence Olivier.

===Later work===
His later films included &quot;Sphinx&quot; (1981), a $10 million thriller about Egypt based on a novel by Robin Cook and produced by Stanley O&#x27;Toole, who had made &quot;Boys from Brazil&quot; with Schaffner. It was a commercial and critical failure, as was &quot;Yes, Giorgio&quot; (1982), a musical comedy starring Luciano Pavarotti.

Schaffner&#x27;s last films were the critically well-received &quot;Lionheart&quot; (1987) and &quot;Welcome Home&quot; (1989).

Schaffner was president of the Directors Guild of America from 1987 until his death in 1989.

==Frequent collaborators==
Jerry Goldsmith composed the music for seven of his films: &quot;The Stripper&quot;, &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot;, &quot;Patton&quot;, &quot;Papillon&quot;, &quot;Islands in the Stream&quot;, &quot;The Boys from Brazil&quot; and &quot;Lionheart&quot;. Four of them were nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Score.

Schaffner twice worked with actors Charlton Heston and Maurice Evans (&quot;The War Lord&quot;; &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot;), George C. Scott (&quot;Patton&quot;; &quot;Islands in the Stream&quot;) and Laurence Olivier (&quot;Nicholas and Alexandra&quot;; &quot;The Boys from Brazil&quot;).

==Personal life==

Schaffner married Helen Jean Gilchrist in 1948. The couple had two children, Jennie and Kate. She died in 2007.

Schaffner died on July 2, 1989, at the age of 69. He was released 10 days before his death from a hospital where he was being treated for lung cancer.

==Critical perception==
Screenwriter William Goldman identified Schaffner in 1981 as being one of the three best directors (then living) at handling &quot;scope&quot; (a gift for screen epics) in films. The other two were David Lean and Richard Attenborough.

==Legacy==
In 1991, Schaffner&#x27;s widow, Jean Schaffner, established the Franklin J. Schaffner Alumni Medal (colloquially known as the Franklin J. Schaffner Award), which is awarded by the American Film Institute at its annual ceremony to an alumnus of either the AFI Conservatory or the AFI Conservatory Directing Workshop for Women who best embodies the qualities of the late director: talent, taste, dedication and commitment to quality filmmaking. Notable recipients include David Lynch, Amy Heckerling, Terrence Malick, Darren Aronofsky, Patty Jenkins and Paul Schrader, among others.

The Directors Guild of America also began presenting a Franklin J. Schaffner Achievement Award to associate directors or stage managers in 1991.

The moving image collection of Franklin J. Schaffner is held at the Academy Film Archive.

In May 2020, the mayor of Lancaster, Pennsylvania, proclaimed Franklin Schaffner Week (May 23–30, 2020) to mark the centennial of his birth.

<text>A false etymology (fake etymology or pseudo-etymology) is a false theory about the origin or derivation of a specific word or phrase. When a false etymology becomes a popular belief in a cultural/linguistic community, it is a folk etymology (or popular etymology). Nevertheless, folk/popular etymology may also refer to the process by which a word or phrase is changed because of a popular false etymology. To disambiguate the usage of the term &quot;folk/popular etymology&quot;, Ghil&#x27;ad Zuckermann proposes a clear-cut distinction between the derivational-only popular etymology (DOPE) and the generative popular etymology (GPE): the DOPE refers to a popular false etymology involving no neologization, and the GPE refers to neologization generated by a popular false etymology.

Such etymologies often have the feel of urban legends and can be more colorful and fanciful than the typical etymologies found in dictionaries, often involving stories of unusual practices in particular subcultures (e.g. Oxford students from non-noble families being supposedly forced to write &quot;sine nobilitate&quot; by their name, soon abbreviated to &quot;s.nob.&quot;, hence the word &quot;&quot;).

==Source and influence==
Erroneous etymologies can exist for many reasons. Some are reasonable interpretations of the evidence that happen to be false. For a given word there may often have been many serious attempts by scholars to propose etymologies based on the best information available at the time, and these can be later modified or rejected as linguistic scholarship advances. The results of medieval etymology, for example, were plausible given the insights available at the time, but have often been rejected by modern linguists. The etymologies of humanist scholars in the early modern period began to produce more reliable results, but many of their hypotheses have also been superseded.

Other false etymologies are the result of specious and untrustworthy claims made by individuals, such as the unfounded claims made by Daniel Cassidy that hundreds of common English words such as &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;, and &quot;&quot; derive from the Irish language.

In the United States, some of these scandalous legends have had to do with racism and slavery; common words such as &quot;picnic&quot;, &quot;buck&quot;, and &quot;crowbar&quot; have been alleged to stem from derogatory terms or racist practices.

<text>The true finches are small to medium-sized passerine birds in the family Fringillidae. Finches generally have stout conical bills adapted for eating seeds and nuts and often have colourful plumage. They occupy a great range of habitats where they are usually resident and do not migrate. They have a worldwide native distribution except for Australia and the polar regions. The family Fringillidae contains more than two hundred species divided into fifty genera. It includes the canaries, siskins, redpolls, serins, grosbeaks and euphonias, as well as the morphologically divergent Hawaiian honeycreepers.

Many birds in other families are also commonly called &quot;finches&quot;. These groups include the estrildid finches (Estrildidae) of the Old World tropics and Australia; some members of the Old World bunting family (Emberizidae) and the New World sparrow family (Passerellidae); and the Darwin&#x27;s finches of the Galapagos islands, now considered members of the tanager family (Thraupidae).

Finches and canaries were used in the UK, US and Canada in the coal mining industry to detect carbon monoxide from the eighteenth to twentieth century. This practice ceased in the UK in 1986.

==Systematics and taxonomy==
The name Fringillidae for the finch family was introduced in 1819 by the English zoologist William Elford Leach in a guide to the contents of the British Museum. The taxonomy of the family, in particular the cardueline finches, has a long and complicated history. The study of the relationship between the taxa has been confounded by the recurrence of similar morphologies due to the convergence of species occupying similar niches. In 1968 the American ornithologist Raymond Andrew Paynter, Jr. wrote:

Limits of the genera and relationships among the species are less understood – and subject to more controversy – in the carduelines than in any other species of passerines, with the possible exception of the estrildines [waxbills].

Beginning around 1990 a series of phylogenetic studies based on mitochondrial and nuclear DNA sequences resulted in substantial revisions in the taxonomy. Several groups of birds that had previously been assigned to other families were found to be related to the finches. The Neotropical &quot;Euphonia&quot; and the &quot;Chlorophonia&quot; were formerly placed in the tanager family Thraupidae due to their similar appearance but analysis of mitochondrial DNA sequences revealed that both genera were more closely related to the finches. They are now placed in a separate subfamily Euphoniinae within the Fringillidae. The Hawaiian honeycreepers were at one time placed in their own family, Drepanididae but were found to be closely related to the &quot;Carpodacus&quot; rosefinches and are now placed within the Carduelinae subfamily. The three largest genera, &quot;Carpodacus&quot;, &quot;Carduelis&quot; and &quot;Serinus&quot; were found to be polyphyletic. Each was split into monophyletic genera. The American rosefinches were moved from &quot;Carpodacus&quot; to &quot;Haemorhous&quot;. &quot;Carduelis&quot; was split by moving the greenfinches to &quot;Chloris&quot; and a large clade into &quot;Spinus&quot; leaving just three species in the original genus. Thirty seven species were moved from &quot;Serinus&quot; to &quot;Crithagra&quot; leaving eight species in the original genus. Today the family Fringillidae is divided into three subfamilies, the Fringillinae containing a single genus with the chaffinches, the Carduelinae containing 183 species divided into 49 genera, and the Euphoniinae containing the &quot;Euphonia&quot; and the &quot;Chlorophonia&quot;.

Although Przewalski&#x27;s &quot;rosefinch&quot; (&quot;Urocynchramus pylzowi&quot;) has ten primary flight feathers rather than the nine primaries of other finches, it was sometimes classified in the Carduelinae. It is now assigned to a distinct family, Urocynchramidae, monotypic as to genus and species, and with no particularly close relatives among the Passeroidea.


===Fossil record===
Fossil remains of true finches are rare, and those that are known can mostly be assigned to extant genera at least. Like the other Passeroidea families, the true finches seem to be of roughly Middle Miocene origin, around 20 to 10 million years ago (Ma). An unidentifable finch fossil from the Messinian age, around 12 to 7.3 million years ago (Ma) during the Late Miocene subepoch, has been found at Polgárdi in Hungary.

==Description==
The smallest &quot;classical&quot; true finches are the Andean siskin (&quot;Spinus spinescens&quot;) at as little as 9.5 cm (3.8 in) and the lesser goldfinch (&quot;Spinus psaltria&quot;) at as little as . The largest species is probably the collared grosbeak (&quot;Mycerobas affinis&quot;) at up to and , although larger lengths, to in the pine grosbeak (&quot;Pinicola enucleator&quot;), and weights, to in the evening grosbeak (&quot;Hesperiphona vespertina&quot;), have been recorded in species which are slightly smaller on average. They typically have strong, stubby beaks, which in some species can be quite large; however, Hawaiian honeycreepers are famous for the wide range of bill shapes and sizes brought about by adaptive radiation. All true finches have 9 primary remiges and 12 rectrices. The basic plumage colour is brownish, sometimes greenish; many have considerable amounts of black, while white plumage is generally absent except as wing-bars or other signalling marks. Bright yellow and red carotenoid pigments are commonplace in this family, and thus blue structural colours are rather rare, as the yellow pigments turn the blue color into green. Many, but by no means all true finches have strong sexual dichromatism, the females typically lacking the bright carotenoid markings of males.

==Distribution and habitat==

The finches have a near-global distribution, being found across the Americas, Eurasia and Africa, as well as some island groups such as the Hawaiian islands. They are absent from Australasia, Antarctica, the Southern Pacific and the islands of the Indian Ocean, although some European species have been widely introduced in Australia and New Zealand.

Finches are typically inhabitants of well-wooded areas, but some can be found on mountains or even in deserts.

==Behaviour==

The finches are primarily granivorous, but euphoniines include considerable amounts of arthropods and berries in their diet, and Hawaiian honeycreepers evolved to utilize a wide range of food sources, including nectar. The diet of Fringillidae nestlings includes a varying amount of small arthropods. True finches have a bouncing flight like most small passerines, alternating bouts of flapping with gliding on closed wings. Most sing well and several are commonly seen cagebirds; foremost among these is the domesticated canary (&quot;Serinus canaria domestica&quot;). The nests are basket-shaped and usually built in trees, more rarely in bushes, between rocks or on similar substrate.

==List of genera==
The family Fringillidae contains 235 species divided into 50 genera and three subfamilies. The subfamily Carduelinae includes 18 extinct Hawaiian honeycreepers and the extinct Bonin grosbeak. See List of Fringillidae species for further details.

<text>Facilitated diffusion (also known as facilitated transport or passive-mediated transport) is the process of spontaneous passive transport (as opposed to active transport) of molecules or ions across a biological membrane via specific transmembrane integral proteins. Being passive, facilitated transport does not directly require chemical energy from ATP hydrolysis in the transport step itself; rather, molecules and ions move down their concentration gradient according to the principles of diffusion.

Facilitated diffusion differs from simple diffusion in several ways: 

# The transport relies on molecular binding between the cargo and the membrane-embedded channel or carrier protein.
# The rate of facilitated diffusion is saturable with respect to the concentration difference between the two phases; unlike free diffusion which is linear in the concentration difference.
# The temperature dependence of facilitated transport is substantially different due to the presence of an activated binding event, as compared to free diffusion where the dependence on temperature is mild.
Polar molecules and large ions dissolved in water cannot diffuse freely across the plasma membrane due to the hydrophobic nature of the fatty acid tails of the phospholipids that comprise the lipid bilayer. Only small, non-polar molecules, such as oxygen and carbon dioxide, can diffuse easily across the membrane. Hence, small polar molecules are transported by proteins in the form of transmembrane channels. These channels are gated, meaning that they open and close, and thus deregulate the flow of ions or small polar molecules across membranes, sometimes against the osmotic gradient. Larger molecules are transported by transmembrane carrier proteins, such as permeases, that change their conformation as the molecules are carried across (e.g. glucose or amino acids). 
Non-polar molecules, such as retinol or lipids, are poorly soluble in water. They are transported through aqueous compartments of cells or through extracellular space by water-soluble carriers (e.g. retinol binding protein). The metabolites are not altered because no energy is required for facilitated diffusion. Only permease changes its shape in order to transport metabolites. The form of transport through a cell membrane in which a metabolite is modified is called group translocation transportation.

Glucose, sodium ions, and chloride ions are just a few examples of molecules and ions that must efficiently cross the plasma membrane but to which the lipid bilayer of the membrane is virtually impermeable. Their transport must therefore be &quot;facilitated&quot; by proteins that span the membrane and provide an alternative route or bypass mechanism. Some examples of proteins that mediate this process are glucose transporters, organic cation transport proteins, urea transporter, monocarboxylate transporter 8 and monocarboxylate transporter 10.
== In vivo model of facilitated diffusion ==
Many physical and biochemical processes are regulated by diffusion. Facilitated diffusion is one form of diffusion and it is important in several metabolic processes. Facilitated diffusion is the main mechanism behind the binding of Transcription Factors (TFs) to designated target sites on the DNA molecule. The in vitro model, which is a very well known method of facilitated diffusion, that takes place outside of a living cell, explains the 3-dimensional pattern of diffusion in the cytosol and the 1-dimensional diffusion along the DNA contour. After carrying out extensive research on processes occurring out of the cell, this mechanism was generally accepted but there was a need to verify that this mechanism could take place in vivo or inside of living cells. Bauer &amp; Metzler (2013) therefore carried out an experiment using a bacterial genome in which they investigated the average time for TF – DNA binding to occur. After analyzing the process for the time it takes for TF&#x27;s to diffuse across the contour and cytoplasm of the bacteria&#x27;s DNA, it was concluded that in vitro and in vivo are similar in that the association and dissociation rates of TF&#x27;s to and from the DNA are similar in both. Also, on the DNA contour, the motion is slower and target sites are easy to localize while in the cytoplasm, the motion is faster but the TF&#x27;s are not sensitive to their targets and so binding is restricted.

===Intracellular facilitated diffusion===

Single-molecule imaging is an imaging technique which provides an ideal resolution necessary for the study of the Transcription factor binding mechanism in living cells. In prokaryotic bacteria cells such as &quot;E. coli&quot;, facilitated diffusion is required in order for regulatory proteins to locate and bind to target sites on DNA base pairs. There are 2 main steps involved: the protein binds to a non-specific site on the DNA and then it diffuses along the DNA chain until it locates a target site, a process referred to as sliding. According to Brackley et al. (2013), during the process of protein sliding, the protein searches the entire length of the DNA chain using 3-D and 1-D diffusion patterns. During 3-D diffusion, the high incidence of Crowder proteins creates an osmotic pressure which brings searcher proteins (e.g. Lac Repressor) closer to the DNA to increase their attraction and enable them to bind, as well as steric effect which exclude the Crowder proteins from this region (Lac operator region). Blocker proteins participate in 1-D diffusion only i.e. bind to and diffuse along the DNA contour and not in the cytosol.

The in vivo model mentioned above clearly explains 3-D and 1-D diffusion along the DNA strand and the binding of proteins to target sites on the chain. Just like prokaryotic cells, in eukaryotes, facilitated diffusion occurs in the nucleoplasm on chromatin filaments, accounted for by the switching dynamics of a protein when it is either bound to a chromatin thread or when freely diffusing in the nucleoplasm. In addition, given that the chromatin molecule is fragmented, its fractal properties need to be considered. After calculating the search time for a target protein, alternating between the 3-D and 1-D diffusion phases on the chromatin fractal structure, it was deduced that facilitated diffusion in eukaryotes precipitates the searching process and minimizes the searching time by increasing the DNA-protein affinity.

== For oxygen ==
The oxygen affinity with hemoglobin on red blood cell surfaces enhances this bonding ability. In a system of facilitated diffusion of oxygen, there is a tight relationship between the ligand which is oxygen and the carrier which is either hemoglobin or myoglobin. This mechanism of facilitated diffusion of oxygen by hemoglobin or myoglobin was discovered and initiated by Wittenberg and Scholander. They carried out experiments to test for the steady-state of diffusion of oxygen at various pressures. Oxygen-facilitated diffusion occurs in a homogeneous environment where oxygen pressure can be relatively controlled.
 For oxygen diffusion to occur, there must be a full saturation pressure (more) on one side of the membrane and full reduced pressure (less) on the other side of the membrane i.e. one side of the membrane must be of higher concentration. During facilitated diffusion, hemoglobin increases the rate of constant diffusion of oxygen and facilitated diffusion occurs when oxyhemoglobin molecule is randomly displaced.

===For carbon monoxide===
Facilitated diffusion of carbon monoxide is similar to that of oxygen. Carbon monoxide also combines with hemoglobin and myoglobin, but carbon monoxide has a dissociation velocity that 100 times less than that of oxygen. Its affinity for myoglobin is 40 times higher and 250 times higher for hemoglobin, compared to oxygen.

==For glucose==
Since glucose is a large molecule, its diffusion across a membrane is difficult. Hence, it diffuses across membranes through facilitated diffusion, down the concentration gradient. The carrier protein at the membrane binds to the glucose and alters its shape such that it can easily to be transported. Movement of glucose into the cell could be rapid or slow depending on the number of membrane-spanning protein. It is transported against the concentration gradient by a dependent glucose symporter which provides a driving force to other glucose molecules in the cells. Facilitated diffusion helps in the release of accumulated glucose into the extracellular space adjacent to the blood capillary.

<doc id="11715" wikidata="Q29251" url="?curid=11715" title="McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle">
<text>The McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle is an American twin-engine, all-weather fighter aircraft designed by McDonnell Douglas (now part of Boeing). Following reviews of proposals, the United States Air Force (USAF) selected McDonnell Douglas&#x27;s design in 1969 to meet the service&#x27;s need for a dedicated air superiority fighter. The Eagle took its maiden flight in July 1972, and entered service in 1976. It is among the most successful modern fighters, with over 100 victories and no losses in aerial combat, with the majority of the kills by the Israeli Air Force.

The Eagle has been exported to many countries, including Israel, Japan, and Saudi Arabia. Although the F-15 was originally envisioned as a pure air superiority fighter, its design included a secondary ground-attack capability that was largely unused. It proved flexible enough that an improved all-weather strike derivative, the F-15E Strike Eagle, was later developed, entered service in 1989 and has been exported to several nations. Several additional Eagle and Strike Eagle subvariants have been produced for foreign customers, with production of enhanced variants ongoing.

The F-15 was the principal air superiority fighter of the USAF and U.S. allies during the late Cold War, replacing the F-4 Phantom II. The Eagle was first used in combat by the Israeli Air Force in 1979 and saw extensive action in the 1982 Lebanon War. In USAF service, the aircraft saw combat action in the 1991 Gulf War and the conflict over Yugoslavia. The USAF began replacing its air superiority F-15A/B/C/D with the F-22 Raptor in the 2000s, but the severely reduced procurement pushed the retirement of the remaining F-15C/D, mostly in the Air National Guard, to 2026 and forced the service to supplement the F-22 with an advanced Eagle variant, the F-15EX, in order to retain an adequate number of air superiority fighters. The F-15 remains in service with numerous countries, and the Strike Eagle variant is expected to continue operating in the USAF into the 2030s.

==Development==

===Early studies===
The F-15 can trace its origins to the early Vietnam War, when the U.S. Air Force and U.S. Navy fought each other over future tactical aircraft. Defense Secretary Robert McNamara was pressing for both services to use as many common aircraft as possible, even if performance compromises were involved. As part of this policy, the USAF and Navy had embarked on the TFX (F-111) program, aiming to deliver a medium-range interdiction aircraft for the Air Force that would also serve as a long-range interceptor aircraft for the Navy.

In January 1965, Secretary McNamara asked the Air Force to consider a new low-cost tactical fighter design for short-range roles and close air support to replace several types like the F-100 Super Sabre and various light bombers then in service. Several existing designs could fill this role; the Navy favored the Douglas A-4 Skyhawk and LTV A-7 Corsair II, which were pure attack aircraft, while the Air Force was more interested in the Northrop F-5 fighter with a secondary attack capability. The A-4 and A-7 were more capable in the attack role, while the F-5 less so, but could defend itself. If the Air Force chose a pure attack design, maintaining air superiority would be a priority for a new airframe. The next month, a report on light tactical aircraft suggested the Air Force purchase the F-5 or A-7, and consider a new higher-performance aircraft to ensure its air superiority. This point was reinforced after the loss of two Republic F-105 Thunderchief aircraft to obsolete MiG-17s attacking the Thanh Hóa Bridge on 4 April 1965.

In April 1965, Harold Brown, at that time director of the Department of Defense Research and Engineering, stated the favored position was to consider the F-5 and begin studies of an &quot;F-X&quot;. These early studies envisioned a production run of 800 to 1,000 aircraft and stressed maneuverability over speed; it also stated that the aircraft would not be considered without some level of ground-attack capability. On 1 August, General Gabriel Disosway took command of Tactical Air Command and reiterated calls for the F-X, but lowered the required performance from Mach 3.0 to 2.5 to lower costs.
An official requirements document for an air superiority fighter was finalized in October 1965, and sent out as a request for proposals to 13 companies on 8 December. Meanwhile, the Air Force chose the A-7 over the F-5 for the support role on 5 November 1965, giving further impetus for an air superiority design as the A-7 lacked any credible air-to-air capability.

Eight companies responded with proposals. Following a downselect, four companies were asked to provide further developments. In total, they developed some 500 design concepts. Typical designs featured variable-sweep wings, weight over , included a top speed of Mach 2.7 and a thrust-to-weight ratio of 0.75. When the proposals were studied in July 1966, the aircraft were roughly the size and weight of the TFX F-111, and like that aircraft, were designs that could not be considered an air-superiority fighter.

===Smaller, lighter===
Through this period, studies of combat over Vietnam were producing worrying results. Theory had stressed long-range combat using missiles and optimized aircraft for this role. The result was highly loaded aircraft with large radar and excellent speed, but limited maneuverability and often lacking a gun. The canonical example was the McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II, used by the USAF, USN, and U.S. Marine Corps to provide air superiority over Vietnam, the only fighter with enough power, range, and maneuverability to be given the primary task of dealing with the threat of Soviet fighters while flying with visual engagement rules.

In practice, due to policy and practical reasons, aircraft were closing to visual range and maneuvering, placing the larger US aircraft at a disadvantage to the much less expensive day fighters such as the MiG-21. Missiles proved to be much less reliable than predicted, especially at close range. Although improved training and the introduction of the M61 Vulcan cannon on the F-4 did much to address the disparity, these early outcomes led to considerable re-evaluation of the 1963 Project Forecast doctrine. This led to John Boyd&#x27;s energy–maneuverability theory, which stressed that extra power and maneuverability were key aspects of a successful fighter design and these were more important than outright speed. Through tireless championing of the concepts and good timing with the &quot;failure&quot; of the initial F-X project, the &quot;fighter mafia&quot; pressed for a lightweight day fighter that could be built and operated in large numbers to ensure air superiority. In early 1967, they proposed that the ideal design had a thrust-to-weight ratio near 1:1, a maximum speed further reduced to Mach 2.3, a weight of , and a wing loading of .

By this time, the Navy had decided the F-111 would not meet their requirements and began the development of a new dedicated fighter design, the VFAX program. In May 1966, McNamara again asked the forces to study the designs and see whether the VFAX would meet the Air Force&#x27;s F-X needs. The resulting studies took 18 months and concluded that the desired features were too different; the Navy stressed loiter time and mission flexibility, while the Air Force was now looking primarily for maneuverability.

===Focus on air superiority===
In 1967, the Soviet Union revealed the Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-25 at the Domodedovo airfield near Moscow. The MiG-25 was designed as a high-speed, high-altitude interceptor aircraft, and made many performance tradeoffs to excel in this role. Among these was the requirement for very high speed, over Mach 2.8, which demanded the use of stainless steel instead of aluminum for many parts of the aircraft. The added weight demanded a much larger wing to allow the aircraft to operate at the required high altitudes. However, to observers, it appeared outwardly similar to the very large F-X studies, an aircraft with high speed and a large wing offering high maneuverability, leading to serious concerns throughout the Department of Defense and the various arms that the US was being outclassed. The MiG-23 was likewise a subject of concern, and it was generally believed to be a better aircraft than the F-4. The F-X would outclass the MiG-23, but now the MiG-25 appeared to be superior in speed, ceiling, and endurance to all existing US fighters, even the F-X. Thus, an effort to improve the F-X followed.

Both Headquarters USAF and TAC continued to call for a multipurpose aircraft, while both Disosway and Air Chief of Staff Bruce K. Holloway pressed for a pure air-superiority design that would be able to meet the expected performance of the MiG-25. During the same period, the Navy had ended its VFAX program and instead accepted a proposal from Grumman for a smaller and more maneuverable design known as VFX, later becoming the Grumman F-14 Tomcat. VFX was considerably closer to the evolving F-X requirements. The Air Force in-fighting was eventually ended by the worry that the Navy&#x27;s VFAX would be forced on them; in May 1968, it was stated that &quot;We finally decided – and I hope there is no one who still disagrees – that this aircraft is going to be an air superiority fighter&quot;.
In September 1968, a request for proposals was released to major aerospace companies. These requirements called for single-seat fighter having a maximum take-off weight of for the air-to-air role with a maximum speed of Mach 2.5 and a thrust-to-weight ratio of nearly 1:1 at mission weight. It also called for a twin-engined arrangement, as this was believed to respond to throttle changes more rapidly and might offer commonality with the Navy&#x27;s VFX program. However, details of the avionics were left largely undefined, as whether to build a larger aircraft with a powerful radar that could detect the enemy at longer ranges was not clear, or alternatively a smaller aircraft that would make detecting it more difficult for the enemy.

Four companies submitted proposals, with the Air Force eliminating General Dynamics and awarding contracts to Fairchild Republic, North American Rockwell, and McDonnell Douglas for the definition phase in December 1968. The companies submitted technical proposals by June 1969. The Air Force announced the selection of McDonnell Douglas on 23 December 1969; like the Navy&#x27;s VFX, the F-X skipped much of the prototype phase and jumped straight into full-scale development to save time and avoid potential program cancellation. The winning design resembled the twin-tailed F-14, but with fixed wings; both designs were based on configurations studied in wind-tunnel testing by NASA.
The Eagle&#x27;s initial versions were the F-15 single-seat variant and TF-15 twin-seat variant. (After the F-15C was first flown, the designations were changed to &quot;F-15A&quot; and &quot;F-15B&quot;). These versions would be powered by new Pratt &amp; Whitney F100 engines to achieve a combat thrust-to-weight ratio in excess of 1:1. A proposed 25-mm Ford-Philco GAU-7 cannon with caseless ammunition suffered development problems. It was dropped in favor of the standard M61 Vulcan gun. The F-15 used conformal carriage of four Sparrow missiles like the Phantom. The fixed wing was put onto a flat, wide fuselage that also provided an effective lifting body surface. The airframe was designed with a 4,000 hour service life, although this was later increased through testing and life extension modifications to 8,000 hours and some would fly beyond that. The first F-15A flight was made on 27 July 1972, with the first flight of the two-seat F-15B following in July 1973.

The F-15 has a &quot;look-down/shoot-down&quot; radar that can distinguish low-flying moving targets from ground clutter. It would use computer technology with new controls and displays to lower pilot workload and require only one pilot to save weight. Unlike the F-14 or F-4, the F-15 has only a single canopy frame with clear vision forward. The USAF introduced the F-15 as &quot;the first dedicated USAF air-superiority fighter since the North American F-86 Sabre&quot;.

The F-15 was favored by customers such as the Israel and Japan air arms. Criticism from the fighter mafia that the F-15 was too large to be a dedicated dogfighter and too expensive to procure in large numbers, led to the Lightweight Fighter (LWF) program, which led to the USAF General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon and the middle-weight Navy McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet.

===Upgrades and further development===
The single-seat F-15C and two-seat F-15D models entered production in 1978 and conducted their first flights in February and June of that year. These models were fitted with the Production Eagle Package (PEP 2000), which included of additional internal fuel, provisions for exterior conformal fuel tanks (CFT), and an increased maximum takeoff weight up to . The increased takeoff weight allows internal fuel, a full weapons load, conformal fuel tanks, and three external fuel tanks to be carried. The APG-63 radar uses a programmable signal processor (PSP), enabling the radar to be reprogrammable for additional purposes such as the addition of new armaments and equipment. The PSP was the first of its kind in the world, and the upgraded APG-63 radar was the first radar to use it. Other improvements included strengthened landing gear, a new digital central computer, and an overload warning system (OWS), which allows the pilot to fly up to 9 &quot;g&quot; at all weights.

The F-15 Multistage Improvement Program (MSIP) was initiated in February 1983 with the first production MSIP F-15C produced in 1985. Improvements included an upgraded central computer; a Programmable Armament Control Set, allowing for advanced versions of the AIM-7, AIM-9, and AIM-120A missiles; and an expanded Tactical Electronic Warfare System that provides improvements to the ALR-56C radar warning receiver and ALQ-135 countermeasure set. The final 43 F-15Cs included the Hughes APG-70 radar developed for the F-15E (see below); these are sometimes referred as Enhanced Eagles. Earlier MSIP F-15Cs with the APG-63 were upgraded to the APG-63(V)1 to improve maintainability and to perform similar to the APG-70. Existing F-15s were retrofitted with these improvements. Also beginning in 1985, F-15C and D models were equipped with the improved P&amp;W F100-PW-220 engine and digital engine controls, providing quicker throttle response, reduced wear, and lower fuel consumption. Starting in 1997, original F100-PW-100 engines were upgraded to a similar configuration with the designation F100-PW-220E starting. In 2000, the APG-63(V)2 active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar was retrofitted to 18 U.S. Air Force F-15C aircraft. The ZAP (Zone Acquisition Program) missile launch envelope has been integrated into the operational flight program system of all U.S. F-15 aircraft, providing dynamic launch zone and launch acceptability region information for missiles to the pilot by display cues in real-time.
Although the Air Force&#x27;s F-X requirements were focused on air superiority, McDonnell Douglas had quietly included a basic secondary ground attack capability in the F-15&#x27;s design since the beginning and also performed early internal studies for enhancing that capability. In 1979, McDonnell Douglas and F-15 radar manufacturer, Hughes, teamed to privately develop a strike fighter version of the F-15. This version competed in the Air Force&#x27;s Dual-Role Fighter competition starting in 1982. The F-15E strike variant was selected for production over General Dynamics&#x27; competing F-16XL in 1984; it is a two-seat, dual-role, totally integrated fighter for all-weather, air-to-air, and deep interdiction missions. The rear cockpit is upgraded to include four multipurpose cathode-ray tube displays for aircraft systems and weapons management. The digital, triple-redundant Lear Siegler aircraft flight control system permits coupled automatic terrain following, enhanced by a ring-laser gyro inertial navigation system. For low-altitude, high-speed penetration and precision attack on tactical targets at night or in adverse weather, the F-15E carries a high-resolution APG-70 radar and LANTIRN pods to provide thermography. The F-15E would be developed into the F-15 Advanced Eagle family, which features fly-by-wire controls; the Advanced Eagle is currently the basis of all current F-15 production.
Beginning in 2006, with the threat of curtailed procurement of the F-22 that was to replace all air superiority F-15s, USAF planned to modernize 179 F-15Cs in the best material condition in order to maintain fighter fleet size by retrofitting the AN/APG-63(V)3 AESA radar and updated cockpit displays; the first upgraded aircraft was delivered in October 2010. A significant number of F-15s were equipped with the Joint Helmet Mounted Cueing System. Lockheed Martin developed an infrared search and track (IRST) sensor system for tactical fighters such the F-15C, eventually resulting in the AN/ASG-34(V)1 IRST21 sensor mounted in the Legion Pod; the AN/AAQ-33 Sniper XR pod was also integrated as a makeshift interim IRST solution. A follow-on upgrade called the Eagle Passive/Active Warning Survivability System (EPAWSS) was planned. Boeing was selected in October 2015 to serve as prime contractor for the EPAWSS, with BAE Systems selected as a subcontractor. The EPAWSS is an all-digital system with advanced electronic countermeasures, radar warning, and increased chaff and flare capabilities in a smaller footprint than the 1980s-era Tactical Electronic Warfare System. More than 400 F-15Cs and F-15Es were planned to have the system installed.

In September 2015, Boeing unveiled its 2040C Eagle upgrade (also called &quot;Golden Eagle&quot;), designed to keep the F-15 relevant through 2040. Seen as a necessity because of the low numbers of F-22s procured, the upgrade builds upon the company&#x27;s F-15SE Silent Eagle concept with low-observable features. Most improvements focus on lethality including quad-pack munitions racks to double its missile load to 16, conformal fuel tanks for extended range, &quot;Talon HATE&quot; communications pod to communicate with fifth-generation fighters, the APG-63(V)3 AESA radar, long-range Legion IRST pod, and EPAWSS electronic warfare suite. The 2040C upgrade for the F-15C/D was not pursued, owing to the airframes&#x27; age that made it not economically sustainable, but many of the components such as EPAWSS and AESA radar were continued for F-15E upgrades as well as new-build F-15EX Eagle II ordered by USAF in 2020; the F-15EX took advantage of existing Advanced Eagle production line for export customers to minimize lead times and start-up costs to replace the remaining F-15C/Ds, whereas F-22 production restart was considered cost-prohibitive.

===Overview===


The F-15 has an all-metal semi-monocoque fuselage with a large-cantilever, shoulder-mounted wing. The wing planform of the F-15 suggests a modified cropped delta shape with a leading-edge sweepback angle of 45°. Ailerons and a simple high-lift flap are located on the trailing edge. No leading-edge maneuvering flaps are used. This complication was avoided by the combination of low wing loading and fixed leading-edge conical camber that varies with spanwise position along the wing. Airfoil thickness ratios vary from 5.9% at the root to 3% at the tip.

The empennage is of metal and composite construction, with twin aluminum alloy/composite material honeycomb structure vertical stabilizers with boron-composite skin, resulting in an exceptionally thin tailplane and rudders. Composite horizontal all-moving tails outboard of the vertical stabilizers move independently to provide roll control in some flight maneuvers; the horizontal tails have a dogtooth notch to mitigate flutter. The F-15 has a spine-mounted air brake and retractable tricycle landing gear. It is powered by two Pratt &amp; Whitney F100 axial flow turbofan engines with afterburners, mounted side by side in the fuselage and fed by rectangular inlets with variable intake ramps. The cockpit is mounted high in the forward fuselage with a one-piece windscreen and large canopy for increased visibility and a 360° field of view for the pilot. The airframe consists of 37.3% aluminum, 29.2% honeycomb, 25.8% titanium, 5.5% steel, and 2% composites and fiberglass; the structure began to incorporate advanced superplastically formed titanium components in the 1980s.

The F-15&#x27;s maneuverability is derived from low wing loading (weight to wing area ratio) with a high thrust-to-weight ratio, enabling the aircraft to turn tightly at up to 9 &quot;g&quot; without losing airspeed. The F-15 can climb to in around 60 seconds. At certain speeds, the dynamic thrust output of the dual engines is greater than the aircraft&#x27;s combat weight and drag, so it has the ability to accelerate vertically. The weapons and flight-control systems are designed so that one person can safely and effectively perform air-to-air combat. The A and C models are single-seat variants; these were the main air-superiority versions produced. B and D models add a second seat behind the pilot for training, although they are also fully combat capable. E models use the second seat for a weapon systems officer. Visibly, the F-15 has a unique feature &quot;vis-à-vis&quot; other modern fighter aircraft; it does not have the distinctive &quot;turkey feather&quot; aerodynamic exhaust petals covering its engine nozzles. Following problems during development of its exhaust petal design, including dislodgment during flight, the decision was made to remove them, resulting in a 3% aerodynamic drag increase.

The F-15 was shown to be capable of controlled flight with only one wing after an Israeli F-15D suffered a mid-air collision with an A-4 Skyhawk that removed most of the right wing, in the 1983 Negev mid-air collision. While the A-4 was instantly disintegrated with the pilot being automatically ejected, the F-15 was sent into an uncontrollable roll. Through the application of full afterburner as well as a landing at twice the normal speed, pilot Zivi Nedivi managed to land successfully at Ramon Airbase. Subsequent wind-tunnel tests on a one-wing model confirmed that controllable flight was only possible within a very limited speed range of ±20 knots and angle of attack variation of ±20 degrees. The event resulted in research into damage-adaptive technology and a system called &quot;Intelligent Flight Control System&quot;.

===Avionics===
A multimission avionics system includes a head-up display (HUD), advanced radar, AN/ASN-109 inertial guidance system, flight instruments, ultra high frequency communications, and tactical air navigation system and instrument landing system receivers. It also has an internally mounted, tactical electronic warfare system, Identification friend or foe system, an electronic countermeasures suite, and a central digital computer.

The HUD projects all essential flight information gathered by the integrated avionics system. This display, visible in any light condition, provides the pilot information necessary to track and destroy an enemy aircraft without having to look down at cockpit instruments.

The F-15&#x27;s versatile APG-63 and 70 pulse-Doppler radar systems can look up at high-flying targets and look-down/shoot-down at low-flying targets without being confused by ground clutter. These radars can detect and track aircraft and small high-speed targets at distances beyond visual range down to close range, and at altitudes down to treetop level. The APG-63 has a basic range of . The radar feeds target information into the central computer for effective weapons delivery. For close-in dogfights, the radar automatically acquires enemy aircraft, and this information is projected on the head-up display. The F-15&#x27;s electronic warfare system provides both threat warning (radar warning receiver) and automatic countermeasures against selected threats.

The improved APG-63(V)2 and (V)3 active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar upgrade included most of the hardware from the APG-63(V)1, but added an AESA to provide increased pilot situation awareness. The AESA radar has an exceptionally agile beam, providing nearly instantaneous track updates and enhanced multitarget tracking capability. The APG-63(V)2 and (V)3 are compatible with current F-15C weapon loads and enable pilots to take full advantage of AIM-120 AMRAAM capabilities, simultaneously guiding multiple missiles to several targets widely spaced in azimuth, elevation, or range.

===Weaponry and external stores===
A variety of air-to-air weaponry can be carried by the F-15. An automated weapon system enables the pilot to release weapons effectively and safely, using the head-up display and the avionics and weapons controls located on the engine throttles or control stick. When the pilot changes from one weapon system to another, visual guidance for the selected weapon automatically appears on the head-up display.

The Eagle can be armed with combinations of four different air-to-air weapons: AIM-7F/M Sparrow missiles or AIM-120 AMRAAM advanced medium-range air-to-air missiles on its lower fuselage corners, AIM-9L/M Sidewinder or AIM-120 AMRAAM missiles on two pylons under the wings, and an internal M61 Vulcan Gatling gun in the right wing root.
Low-drag conformal fuel tanks (CFTs), initially called Fuel And Sensor Tactical (FAST) packs, were developed for the F-15C and D models. They can be attached to the sides of the engine air intakes under each wing and are designed to the same load factors and airspeed limits as the basic aircraft. These tanks slightly degrade performance by increasing aerodynamic drag and cannot be jettisoned in-flight. However, they cause less drag than conventional external tanks. Each conformal tank can hold 750 U.S. gallons (2,840 L) of fuel. These CFTs increase range and reduce the need for in-flight refueling. All external stations for munitions remain available with the tanks in use. Moreover, Sparrow or AMRAAM missiles can be attached to the corners of the CFTs. The USAF 57th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron based at NAS Keflavik, Iceland, was the only C-model squadron to use CFTs on a regular basis due to its extended operations over the North Atlantic. With the closure of the 57 FIS, the F-15E is the only variant to carry them on a routine basis. CFTs have also been sold to Israel and Saudi Arabia.

==Operational history==

===Introduction and early service===
The largest operator of the F-15 is the United States Air Force. The first Eagle, an F-15B, was delivered on 13 November 1974. In January 1976, the first Eagle destined for a combat squadron, the 555th TFS, was delivered. These initial aircraft carried the Hughes Aircraft (now Raytheon) APG-63 radar. The F-15 in early service was plagued by reliability and durability problems of its F100-PW-100 engines, whose ambitious specifications were critical for the aircraft&#x27;s high performance. Furthermore, the issues were exacerbated by pilots making many more abrupt throttle changes than in previous fighters and engines due to the thrust available. The issues were addressed by the improved F100-PW-220 engines first delivered in 1986.
The first kill by an F-15 was scored by Israeli Air Force (IAF) ace Moshe Melnik in 1979. During IAF raids against Palestinian factions in Lebanon in 1979–1981, F-15As reportedly downed 13 Syrian MiG-21s and two Syrian MiG-25s. Israeli F-15As and Bs participated as escorts in Operation Opera, an air strike on an Iraqi nuclear reactor. In the 1982 Lebanon War, Israeli F-15s were credited with 41 Syrian aircraft destroyed (23 MiG-21s and 17 MiG-23s, and one Aérospatiale SA.342L Gazelle helicopter). During Operation Mole Cricket 19, Israeli F-15s and F-16s together shot down 82 Syrian fighters (MiG-21s, MiG-23s, and MiG-23Ms) without losses.

Israel was the only operator to use and develop the air-to-ground abilities of the air-superiority F-15 variants, doing so because the fighter&#x27;s range was well beyond other combat aircraft in the Israeli inventory in the 1980s. The first known use of F-15s for a strike mission was during Operation Wooden Leg on 1 October 1985, with six F-15Ds attacking PLO Headquarters in Tunis with one GBU-15 guided bomb per aircraft and two F-15Cs restriking the ruins with six Mk-82 unguided bombs each. This was one of the few times air-superiority F-15s (A/B/C/D models) were used in tactical strike missions. Israeli air-superiority F-15 variants have since been extensively upgraded to carry a wider range of air-to-ground armaments, including JDAM GPS-guided bombs and Popeye missile.

The first American combat use of the F-15 was during Operation Urgent Fury. F-15s of the 33rd Tactical Fighter Wing provided air cover alongside U.S. Navy F-14 Tomcats for Marines and the 82nd Airborne Division for contingency operations in Grenada.

Royal Saudi Air Force F-15C pilots reportedly shot down two Iranian Air Force F-4E Phantom IIs in a skirmish on 5 June 1984.

====Anti-satellite trials====
The ASM-135 missile was designed to be a standoff antisatellite (ASAT) weapon, with the F-15 acting as a first stage. The Soviet Union could correlate a U.S. rocket launch with a spy satellite loss, but an F-15 carrying an ASAT would blend in among hundreds of F-15 flights. From January 1984 to September 1986, two F-15As were used as launch platforms for the ASAT missile. The F-15As were modified to carry one ASM-135 on the centerline station with extra equipment within a special centerline pylon. The launch aircraft executed a Mach 1.22, 3.8 g climb at 65° to release the ASAT missile at an altitude of . The flight computer was updated to control the zoom-climb and missile release.

The third test flight involved a functional P78-1 solar observatory satellite in a orbit, which was destroyed by kinetic energy. The pilot, USAF Major Wilbert D. &quot;Doug&quot; Pearson, became the only pilot to destroy a satellite. The ASAT program involved five test launches. The program was officially terminated in 1988.

===Gulf War and aftermath===
The USAF began deploying F-15C, D, and E model aircraft to the Persian Gulf region in August 1990 for Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm. During the Gulf War, the F-15 accounted for 36 of the 39 air-to-air victories by the U.S. Air Force against Iraqi forces. Iraq has confirmed the loss of 23 of its aircraft in air-to-air combat. The F-15C and D fighters were used in the air-superiority role, while F-15E Strike Eagles were used in air-to-ground attacks mainly at night, hunting modified Scud missile launchers and artillery sites using the LANTIRN system. According to the USAF, its F-15Cs had 34 confirmed kills of Iraqi aircraft during the 1991 Gulf War, most of them by missile fire: five Mikoyan MiG-29s, two MiG-25s, eight MiG-23s, two MiG-21s, two Sukhoi Su-25s, four Sukhoi Su-22s, one Sukhoi Su-7, six Dassault Mirage F1s, one Ilyushin Il-76 cargo aircraft, one Pilatus PC-9 trainer, and two Mil Mi-8 helicopters. According to NHHC, F-15s may have also shot down a friendly F-14 Tomcat. In addition, the F-15E achieved its first-ever air-to-air kill on 14 February 1991, destroying an Iraqi Mi-24 &quot;Hind&quot; helicopter with a GBU-10 laser-guided bomb. Air superiority was achieved in the first three days of the conflict; many of the later kills were reportedly of Iraqi aircraft fleeing to Iran, rather than engaging American aircraft. Two F-15Es were lost to ground fire, and another was damaged on the ground by a Scud strike on King Abdulaziz Air Base.

On 11 November 1990, a Royal Saudi Air Force (RSAF) pilot defected to Sudan with an F-15C fighter during Operation Desert Shield. Saudi Arabia paid US$40 million (~$ in ) for return of the aircraft three months later. RSAF F-15s shot down two Iraqi Mirage F1s during the Operation Desert storm. One Saudi Arabian F-15C was lost to a crash during the Persian Gulf War in 1991. The IQAF claimed this fighter was part of two USAF F-15Cs that engaged two Iraqi MiG-25PDs, and was hit by an R-40 missile before crashing.
They have since been deployed to support Operation Southern Watch, the patrolling of the Iraqi no-fly zones in Southern Iraq; Operation Provide Comfort in Turkey; in support of NATO operations in Bosnia, and recent air expeditionary force deployments. In 1994, two U.S. Army Sikorsky UH-60 Black Hawks were mistakenly downed by USAF F-15Cs in northern Iraq in a friendly-fire incident. USAF F-15Cs shot down four Yugoslav MiG-29s using AIM-120 and AIM-7 Radar guided missiles during NATO&#x27;s 1999 intervention in Kosovo, Operation Allied Force.

===Structural defects===
All F-15s were grounded by the USAF after a Missouri Air National Guard F-15C came apart in flight and crashed on 2 November 2007. The newer F-15E fleet was later cleared for continued operations. The USAF reported on 28 November 2007 that a critical location in the upper longerons on the F-15C was the failure&#x27;s suspected cause, causing the fuselage forward of the air intakes, including the cockpit and radome, to separate from the airframe.

F-15A through D-model aircraft were grounded until the location received detailed inspections and repairs as needed. The grounding of F-15s received media attention as it began to place strains on the nation&#x27;s air-defense efforts. The grounding forced some states to rely on their neighboring states&#x27; fighters for air-defense protection, and Alaska to depend on Canadian Forces&#x27; fighter support.

On 8 January 2008, the USAF Air Combat Command (ACC) cleared a portion of its older F-15 fleet for return to flying status. It also recommended a limited return to flight for units worldwide using the affected models. The accident review board report, which was released on 10 January 2008, stated that analysis of the F-15C wreckage determined that the longeron did not meet drawing specifications, which led to fatigue cracks and finally a catastrophic failure of the remaining support structures and breakup of the aircraft in flight. In a report released on 10 January 2008, nine other F-15s were identified to have similar problems in the longeron. As a result, General John D. W. Corley stated, &quot;the long-term future of the F-15 is in question&quot;. On 15 February 2008, ACC cleared all its grounded F-15A/B/C/D fighters for flight pending inspections, engineering reviews, and any needed repairs. ACC also recommended release of other U.S. F-15A/B/C/Ds.

===Later service===
The F-15 had a combined air-to-air combat record of 104 kills to no losses . The F-15&#x27;s air superiority versions, the A/B/C/D models, have not suffered any losses to enemy action. Over half of F-15 kills have been achieved by Israeli Air Force pilots.

On 16 September 2009, the last F-15A, an Oregon Air National Guard aircraft, was retired, marking the end of service for the F-15A and F-15B models in the United States. With the retirement of those early models, the F-15C and D models continued operational service to supplement the new F-22 Raptor in frontline US service. Because the DOD was primarily focused on asymmetric counterinsurgency warfare in the Middle East in the 2000s, the F-22 procurement was curtailed to just 187 operational aircraft and the USAF had to extend F-15C/D operations well beyond its planned retirement date in order to maintain adequate numbers of air superiority fighters; in 2007, the USAF planned to keep 179 F-15C/Ds along with 224 F-15Es in service beyond 2025. During the 2010s, USAF F-15C/Ds were regularly based overseas with the Pacific Air Forces at Kadena AB in Japan and with the U.S. Air Forces in Europe at RAF Lakenheath in the United Kingdom. Other regular USAF F-15s are operated by ACC as adversary/aggressor platforms at Nellis AFB, Nevada, and by Air Force Materiel Command in test and evaluation roles at Edwards AFB, California, and Eglin AFB, Florida. All remaining combat-coded F-15C/Ds are operated by the Air National Guard.
To keep the F-15C/D viable, the fleet saw a series of upgrades, with 179 aircraft receiving the AN/APG-63(V)3 AESA radar starting in 2010 along with eventual addition of IRST pods and cockpit enhancements. However, problems with the aging fleet meant the F-15C faced cuts or retirement in the USAF&#x27;s FY 2015 budget in response to sequestration. By the mid-2010s, the aging F-15C/D fleet was no longer economically sustainable to the 2030s as hoped, and the USAF chose to forgo the more comprehensive F-15 2040C upgrade proposed by Boeing; in April 2017, USAF officials announced plans to retire the F-15C/D in the mid-2020s and press other aircraft such as F-16s into roles occupied by the F-15 while exploring options to recapitalize its fighter fleet.

In late 2018 and early 2019, following a series of DoD Cost Analysis and Program Evaluation (CAPE) Office studies on affordably recapitalizing the fighter fleet, the Pentagon in its FY 2020 budget requested new-build F-15EXs — an advanced variant based on the export F-15QA then in production — to replace the F-15Cs and supplement the F-22s to maintain fighter fleet size, with planned total procurement of 144 aircraft. This allowed USAF to use the existing export production line to quickly and affordably bring fighters into operational service, as restarting the F-22 line was considered cost-prohibitive. In 2022, it was announced the USAF plan to retire their fleet of F-15C/Ds by 2026, while the F-15Es would retire in the 2030s.

===Yemen Civil War===
During the Yemeni Civil War (2015–present), Houthis have used R-27T missiles modified to serve as surface-to-air missiles. A video released on 7 January 2018 also shows a modified R-27T hitting a Saudi F-15 on a forward-looking infrared camera. Houthi sources claim to have downed the F-15, although this has been disputed, as the missile apparently proximity detonated, though the F-15 continued to fly in its trajectory seemingly unaffected. Rebels later released footage showing an aircraft wreck, but serial numbers on the wreckage suggested the aircraft was a Panavia Tornado, also operated by Saudi forces. On 8 January, the Saudi admitted the loss of an aircraft but due to technical reasons.

On 21 March 2018, Houthi rebels released a video where they hit and possibly shot down a Saudi F-15 in Saada province. In the video a R-27T air-to-air missile adapted for surface-to-air use was launched and appeared to hit a jet. As in the video of the previous similar hit recorded on 8 January, the target, while clearly hit, did not appear to be downed. Saudi forces confirmed the hit, while saying the jet landed at a Saudi base. Saudi official sources confirmed the incident, reporting that it happened at 3:48 pm local time after a surface-to-air defense missile was launched at the fighter jet from inside Saada airport.

After the Houthi attack on Saudi oil infrastructure on 14 September 2019, Saudi Arabia tasked F-15 fighters armed with missiles to intercept low flying drones, difficult to intercept with ground-based high altitude missile systems like the MIM-104 Patriot with several drones being downed since then. On 2 July 2020, a Saudi F-15 shot down two Houthi Shahed 129 drones above Yemen. On 7 March 2021, during a Houthi attack at several Saudi oil installations, Saudi F-15s shot down several attacking drones using heatseeking AIM-9 Sidewinder missiles, with video evidence showing at least two Samad-3 UAVs and one Qasef-2K downed. On 30 March 2021, a video made by Saudi border guards showed a Saudi F-15 shooting down a Houthi Quasef-2K drone with an AIM-120 AMRAAM fired at short range.

:Two-seat training version for the Japan Air Self-Defense Force. 12 built in St. Louis, and 25 built under license in Japan by Mitsubishi in the period 1981–1997.
;F-15N Sea Eagle
:The F-15N was a carrier-capable variant proposed in the early 1970s to the U.S. Navy as an alternative to the heavier and, at the time, considered to be &quot;riskier&quot; technology program, the Grumman F-14 Tomcat. It did not have a long-range radar or the long-range missiles used by the F-14. The F-15N-PHX was another proposed naval version capable of carrying the AIM-54 Phoenix missile, but with an enhanced version of the AN/APG-63 radar on the F-15A. These featured folding wingtips, reinforced landing gear and a stronger tailhook for shipboard operation.
;F-15 2040C
:Proposed upgrade to the F-15C, allowing it to supplement the F-22 in the air superiority role. The 2040C concept is an evolution of the Silent Eagle proposed to South Korea and Israel, with some low-observable improvements but mostly a focus on the latest air capabilities and lethality. Proposal includes infra-red search and track, doubling the number of weapon stations, with quad racks for a maximum of 16 air-to-air missiles, Eagle Passive/Active Warning Survivability System (EPAWSS), conformal fuel tanks, upgraded APG-63(V)3 AESA radar and a &quot;Talon HATE&quot; communications pod allowing data transfer with the F-22. This upgrade program was not pursued due to the age of the existing airframes, but some of the upgrades were applied to the new-build F-15EX.

===Strike Eagle derivatives===

;F-15E Strike Eagle
:Two-seat all-weather multirole strike version, fitted with conformal fuel tanks. It was developed into the F-15I, F-15S, F-15K, F-15SG, and is the basis of the F-15 Advanced Eagle family. Over 400 F-15E and derivative variants produced since 1985.
;F-15F Strike Eagle
:Originally proposed as single-seat F-15E for Saudi Arabia; later reserved for Singaporean F-15Es, delivered as F-15SG.
;F-15SE Silent Eagle
:A proposed F-15E variant from March 2009 with a reduced radar cross-section via changes such as replacing conformal fuel tanks with conformal weapons bays and canting the twin vertical tails 15 degrees outward, which would reduce their radar signature while providing a slight boost to lift to help offset the loss of conformal fuel tanks.
;F-15 Advanced Eagle
:Further development of the F-15E with revised wing structure and digital fly-by-wire and is the basis for the F-15SA, F-15QA, F-15EX, and other variants. Current production baseline.

==Notable accidents==

A total of 175 F-15s have been lost to non-combat causes as of June 2016. However, the F-15 aircraft is very reliable with only 1 loss per 50,000 flight hours.
* On 1 May 1983, an Israeli Air Force F-15D collided mid-air with an A-4 Skyhawk during a training flight, causing the F-15&#x27;s right wing to shear off almost completely. Despite the damage, the pilot was able to reach a nearby airbase and land safely – albeit at twice the normal landing speed. The aircraft was subsequently repaired and saw further combat action.
* On 26 March 2001, two US Air Force F-15Cs crashed near the summit of Ben Macdui in the Cairngorms during a low flying training exercise over the Scottish Highlands. Both Lieutenant Colonel Kenneth John Hyvonen and Captain Kirk Jones died in the accident, which resulted in a court martial for an RAF air traffic controller, who was later found not guilty.
* On 2 November 2007, a 27-year-old F-15C (AF Ser. No. 80-0034) of the 131st Fighter Wing, Missouri Air National Guard, crashed following an in-flight breakup due to structural failure during combat training near St. Louis, Missouri. The pilot, Major Stephen W. Stilwell, ejected but suffered serious injuries. On 3 November 2007, all non-mission critical F-15s were grounded pending the crash investigation&#x27;s outcome. By 13 November 2007, over 1,100 F-15s were grounded worldwide after Israel, Japan and Saudi Arabia grounded their aircraft as well. F-15Es were cleared on 15 November 2007 pending individual inspections. On 8 January 2008, the USAF cleared 60 percent of the F-15A/B/C/D fleet to fly. On 10 January 2008, the accident review board released its report, which attributed the crash to the longeron not meeting specifications. On 15 February 2008, the Air Force cleared all F-15s for flight, pending inspections and any needed repairs. In March 2008, Stilwell filed a lawsuit against Boeing which was later dismissed in April 2009.

==Notable appearances in media==

The F-15 was the subject of the IMAX movie &quot;Fighter Pilot: Operation Red Flag&quot;, about the RED FLAG exercises. In Tom Clancy&#x27;s nonfiction book, &quot;Fighter Wing: A Guided Tour of an Air Force Combat Wing&quot; (1995), a detailed analysis of the Air Force&#x27;s premier fighter aircraft, the F-15 Eagle and its capabilities are showcased.

The F-15 has also been a popular subject as a toy, and a fictional likeness of an aircraft similar to the F-15 has been used in cartoons, books, video games, animated television series, and animated films.
