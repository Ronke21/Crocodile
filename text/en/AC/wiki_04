<doc id="10459" wikidata="Q349258" url="?curid=10459" title="Emperor Ingyō">
<text>was the 19th Emperor of Japan, according to the traditional order of succession. Both the &quot;Kojiki&quot;, and the &quot;Nihon Shoki&quot; (collectively known as the &quot;Kiki&quot;) recorded events that took place during Ingyō&#x27;s alleged lifetime. No firm dates can be assigned to this Emperor&#x27;s life or reign, but he is conventionally considered to have reigned from 410 to 453.

While the location of Ingyō&#x27;s grave (if any) is unknown, he is traditionally venerated at a memorial Shinto tomb.

==Protohistoric narrative==
The Japanese have traditionally accepted this sovereign&#x27;s historical existence, and a mausoleum (misasagi) for Ingyō is currently maintained. The following information available is taken from the pseudo-historical &quot;Kojiki&quot; and &quot;Nihon Shoki&quot;, which are collectively known as or &quot;Japanese chronicles&quot;. These chronicles include legends and myths, as well as potential historical facts that have since been exaggerated and/or distorted over time. It&#x27;s recorded in the &quot;Kiki&quot; that Ingyō was born to somewhere between 373 and 375 AD and was given the name . He was the fourth son of Emperor Nintoku, making him the youngest brother of Richū and Hanzei. After the death of his brother Hanzei in 410 AD Oasazuma was approached by ministers who had unanimously chosen him as the next Emperor. Oasazuma declined the offer stating that his brothers had &quot;despised him as a fool&quot;. He also called himself &quot;unlucky&quot; as he claimed to be suffering from an unmentioned paralyzing illness.

After more than two years had passed, Oasazuma was finally persuaded by his favorite concubine Oshisaka no Ōnakatsuhime to accept the throne. Oasazuma was formally enthroned as Emperor Ingyō and his concubine became the next Kōgō. Sometime in early 414 an envoy was sent to Silla and procured a physician for the ailing Emperor. The physician attributed the problem to Ingyō&#x27;s legs and was able to cure him in August of that year. In 415 AD, Ingyō reformed the system of family and clan names. This had been an ongoing issue as many families either gave false names or used a clan title with a ranking they hadn&#x27;t earned. In the middle of 416 AD, an earthquake hit Japan which disrupted the &quot;temporary&quot; burial process of Emperor Hanzei.

Sometime in the winter of 418 AD, empress Oshisaka no Ōnakatsuhime unintentionally introduced her husband to her younger sister at a banquet. Emperor Ingyō fell deeply in love and sent a messenger afterwards to summon her. He learned that the woman&#x27;s name was &quot;Otohime&quot; (&quot;youngest princess&quot;), but was given the designation of &quot;Sotohori Iratsume&quot; (&quot;clothing pass maiden&quot;) by local men for her beauty. Otohime initially refused to comply as she didn&#x27;t want to hurt her sister&#x27;s feelings. Not wanting to face punishment for disobeying, the messenger stayed with Otohime until she agreed to come. Oshisaka was not pleased by this and refused to let Otohime into the Imperial palace. Ingyō thus built Otohime a separate residence nearby where he often sneaked off to.

Empress Oshisaka no Ōnakatsuhime bore Ingyō a total of nine children (5 sons and 4 daughters). In 434 AD Ingyō chose to name his first son Kinashi no Karu as Crown Prince. This was unknowingly a controversial choice as Kinashi was later accused of an incestuous relationship with his sister, Princess Karu no Ōiratsume. Ingyō couldn&#x27;t punish his son due to the title he had bestowed upon him, so instead chose an indirect approach by banishing his daughter Karu no Ōiratsume to Iyo. When Emperor Ingyō died sometime in 453 AD, the king of Silla grieved so much that he presented Japan with 80 musicians to comfort Ingyo&#x27;s soul. Kinashi no Karu meanwhile faced a challenge as his younger brother Anaho was favored to be heir apparent.

==Historical assessment==

Ingyō is regarded by historians as a ruler during the early 5th century whose existence is generally accepted as fact. Scholar Francis Brinkley lists Emperor Ingyō under &quot;Protohistoric sovereigns&quot; whose reign was occupied by an affair and scandal by his son. Other scholars identify Ingyō with King Sai in the &quot;Book of Song&quot;. This would have been a king of Japan (referred to as &quot;Wa&quot; by contemporary Chinese scholars) who is said to have sent messengers to the Liu Song dynasty at least twice, in 443 and 451. However, there is no record in the &quot;Kiki&quot; of messengers being sent.

===Titles and dating===
There is no evidence to suggest that the title &quot;tennō&quot; was used during the time to which Ingyō&#x27;s reign has been assigned. Rather, it was presumably , meaning &quot;the great king who rules all under heaven&quot;. An alternate title could have also been &quot;Great King of Yamato&quot;. The name Ingyō&quot;-tennō&quot; was more than likely assigned to him posthumously by later generations. His name might have been regularized centuries after the lifetime ascribed to Ingyō, possibly during the time in which legends about the origins of the imperial dynasty were compiled as the chronicles known today as the &quot;Kojiki&quot;.

Outside of the &quot;Kiki&quot;, the reign of Emperor Kinmei ( – 571 AD) is the first for which contemporary historiography has been able to assign verifiable dates. The conventionally accepted names and dates of the early Emperors were not confirmed as &quot;traditional&quot; though, until the reign of Emperor Kanmu between 737 and 806 AD.

===Events during reign===
Early on in his reign, Emperor Ingyō chose to send envoys to Korea for medical assistance. Brinkley took note of this and stated that Korea was evidently regarded as the &quot;home of healing science&quot;. He also attributed the &quot;many other&quot; arts which were borrowed from China. In regard to reforms, Sholar William George Aston notes in his translation of the Nihon Shoki that when Ingyō reformed the system of family and clan names, it would have only applied to dominant caste. At the time the general populace of Japan kept their personal names and &quot;cared little for geopolitics&quot;. Emperor Ingyō&#x27;s later affair with &quot;Otohime&quot; is regarded as important by Brinkley as it illustrates the manners and customs at the time. He also suggests that the &quot;atmosphere of loose morality&quot; was in part responsible for Kinashi no Karu&#x27;s incestuous relationship.

It is agreed upon by Basil Hall Chamberlain&#x27;s translation of the Kojiki, and Aston&#x27;s translation of the Nihon Shoki that Prince Kinashi no Karu was probably appointed crown prince during his father&#x27;s lifetime. At the time, marriage between children of the same father had always been allowed as long as the mothers involved were different. Marriage of children of the same mother of whom Kinashi no Karu was guilty of was considered incest. Aston notes in his translation of the Nihon Shoki that it&#x27;s doubtful Karu no Ōiratsume was banished by her father. Historically women have always been more lightly punished than men for the same offense, and &quot;the particular character of the fault in this case makes such a discrimination all the more reasonable&quot;.

Francis Brinkley comments that four facts present themselves during Emperor Ingyō&#x27;s reign: &quot;Men wore wristbands and garters to which grelots were attached, that a high value was set for pearls, that metal was used for the construction of great man&#x27;s gates, and the first earthquake is said to have been experienced in 416 AD&quot;. The latter of these things allegedly leveled the Imperial Palace at Kyoto from the severity of the Earth&#x27;s tremors. Modern sources have since questioned the reliability of this &quot;first earthquake&quot;, opting instead to recognize another that took place in Nara prefecture on May 28, 599 during the reign of Empress Suiko.

===Gravesite===
While the actual site of Ingyō&#x27;s grave is not known, this regent is traditionally venerated at a memorial Shinto shrine in Fujiidera Osaka. The Imperial Household Agency designates this location as Ingyō&#x27;s mausoleum/&quot;kofun&quot;-type Imperial tomb. Formally, this tomb is called , but is also given the name . Another burial candidate for Emperor Ingyō&#x27;s is the , which is also located in Fujiidera. Ingyō is also enshrined at the Imperial Palace along with other emperors and members of the Imperial Family at the Three Palace Sanctuaries.

<doc id="10460" wikidata="Q361010" url="?curid=10460" title="Emperor Ankō">
<text>(401 – 456) was the 20th emperor of Japan, according to the traditional order of succession.

No firm dates can be assigned to this emperor&#x27;s life or reign, but he is conventionally considered to have reigned from 453 to 456.

==Traditional narrative==
The Japanese have traditionally accepted this sovereign&#x27;s historical existence, and a mausoleum (misasagi) for Ankō is currently maintained. The following information available is taken from the pseudo-historical &quot;Kojiki&quot; and &quot;Nihon Shoki&quot;, which are collectively known as or &quot;Japanese chronicles&quot;. These chronicles include legends and myths, as well as potential historical facts that have since been exaggerated and/or distorted over time. It&#x27;s recorded in the &quot;Kiki&quot; that Ingyō was born to somewhere in 400 AD, and was given the name . While he was the third son of Emperor Ingyō, the title of &quot;Crown Prince&quot; was not bestowed upon him in his father&#x27;s lifetime. For this particular sovereign, the Kojiki and Nihon Shoki tell different versions of what allegedly happened in regard to Emperor Ankō&#x27;s older brother &quot;Prince Kinashi no Karu&quot;.

===War between Anaho and Kinashi===
After Emperor Ingyō&#x27;s death in 453 AD, Crown Prince &quot;Kinashi no Karu&quot; faced a mounting problem. The incestuous relationship with his sister, Princess Karu no Ōiratsume had caused the public to shun him and his retainers refused to follow. Karu chose to take up arms against his younger brother as his retainers had instead given their allegiance to him. Prince responded with a force of his own which prompted Karu to flee and take refuge at a noble family&#x27;s residence. From this point on, the &quot;Kiki&quot; splits narratives that converge again with the same fatal outcome. In the &quot;Nihon Shoki&#x27;s&quot; version of events, &quot;Kinashi no Karu&quot; takes his final stand at the residence where he commits an honorary suicide. The Nihon Shoki does not say what happened to Princess Karu no Ōiratsume other than her being banished to Iyo by Emperor Ingyō during his lifetime for incest. In the &quot;Kojikis&quot; version of events, &quot;Kinashi no Karu&quot; surrenders to his younger brother and is banished to Iyo. Karu no Ōiratsume follows him to Iyo afterwards and the two commit suicide together.

===Reign===
Prince was enthroned as &quot;Emperor Ankō&quot; towards the end of 453 AD. During this time the capital was moved to &quot;Isonokami&quot; (located in Yamoto) where the new emperor had his palace. One of Ankō&#x27;s first decisions in the following year was to arrange a marriage between his younger brother, , and Hatahihime, who was a sister of his uncle . Ankō dispatched his servant to negotiate with Ookusaka, and he happily consented to the marriage. As a token of approval, he entrusted Ne-no-omi with a richly jeweled coronet to be presented to the Emperor. Unbeknownst to Ankō, his servant chose to keep the coronet for himself and lied to him by saying Ookusaka refused to comply. Ankō believed Ne-no-omi&#x27;s words and infuriated with rage sent his soldiers to kill Ookusaka and take his wife Nakashi (Emperor Richū’s daughter) as his Kogo. Hatahihime was then married to Ōhatuse in accordance with the Emperor&#x27;s wishes. Aside from his eventual demise, there aren&#x27;t any other noteworthy events during Ankō&#x27;s reign.

===Death===

Ankō married Nakashi whom he &quot;loved deeply&quot; in 455 AD, but before this time she already had a son named (Prince Mayowa). The young prince (6 years old at the time) was able to escape punishment on &quot;his mother&#x27;s account&quot; and was brought up in the royal palace. Sometime in the Autumn of 456 AD, Emperor Ankō confided to Nakashi that he was worried one day Mayowa may seek to avenge his father&#x27;s death. Mayowa overheard this remark and crept to the side of his step-father who was asleep in Nakashi&#x27;s lap. He then proceeded to cut off Ankō&#x27;s head with his own sword. At the time of his death Ankō was 56 years old, had no children of his own, and according to the Nihon Shoki was buried sometime in 459 AD. Prince Ōhatuse no Wakatakeru (Emperor Ingyō&#x27;s youngest son) became the next Emperor towards the end of 456 AD after killing Prince Mayowa and the rest of his competition.

==Historical assessment==

Ankō is regarded by historians as a ruler during the mid 5th century whose existence is generally accepted as fact. Scholar Francis Brinkley lists Emperor Ankō under &quot;Protohistoric sovereigns&quot; whose reign was &quot;a discreditable page of Japanese History&quot;. Other scholars identify Ankō with King Kō in the &quot;Book of Song&quot;. This would have been a king of Japan (referred to as &quot;Wa&quot; by contemporary Chinese scholars) who is said to have sent tribute to the Southern Dynasty of China in 462, during the reign of Emperor Taiwu of the Northern Wei. It also mentions that King Kō was appointed as the &quot;General of the East&quot;. However, there is no record in the &quot;Kiki&quot; of any tribute being sent during this time.

===Titles and dating===
There is no evidence to suggest that the title &quot;tennō&quot; was used during the time to which Ankō&#x27;s reign has been assigned. Rather, it was presumably , meaning &quot;the great king who rules all under heaven&quot;. An alternate title could have also been &quot;Great King of Yamato&quot;. The name Ankō&quot;-tennō&quot; was more than likely assigned to him posthumously by later generations. His name might have been regularized centuries after the lifetime ascribed to Ankō, possibly during the time in which legends about the origins of the imperial dynasty were compiled as the chronicles known today as the &quot;Kojiki&quot;.

Outside of the &quot;Kiki&quot;, the reign of Emperor Kinmei ( – 571 AD) is the first for which contemporary historiography has been able to assign verifiable dates. The conventionally accepted names and dates of the early Emperors were not confirmed as &quot;traditional&quot; though, until the reign of Emperor Kanmu between 737 and 806 AD.

===Events during reign===
Emperor Ankō had a short 3-year reign which is largely confined to an event that had deadly consequences. Scholar William George Aston notes in his translation of the Nihon Shoki that Hatahihime and are implied in the Shukai as grandchildren rather than children of Emperor Nintoku. He states that the &quot;obvious explanation&quot; is that the &quot;chronicle is entirely untrustworthy&quot;. At the point where Emperor Ankō&#x27;s servant relays false information regarding Prince Ookusaka&#x27;s alleged rejection, the emperor had no reason to doubt him. Frank Brinkley notes that it was &quot;not customary in those days&quot; to conduct investigations (in this case a servant).

The exact account of Emperor Ankō&#x27;s death is also questionable given that a child could conceive or commit such a thing. Scholar Francis Brinkley suggests that Empress Nakashi played a role in her husband&#x27;s death. He also suggests that answer might lie with who later became Emperor Yūryaku. Brinkley argues that if Ōhatuse had no issue with killing several of his family members to obtain the throne, then there is no reason why he wouldn&#x27;t have started with the reigning emperor.

===Gravesite===
While the actual site of Ankō&#x27;s grave is not known, this regent is traditionally venerated at a memorial Shinto shrine at the ruins of Horai Castle in Nara City. The Imperial Household Agency designates this location as Ankō&#x27;s mausoleum/&quot;kofun&quot;-type Imperial tomb. Formally, this tomb is called , but is also given the name . Another possible burial theory involves the , whose owner remains unknown. Ankō is also enshrined at the Imperial Palace along with other emperors and members of the Imperial Family at the Three Palace Sanctuaries.

<doc id="10461" wikidata="Q357235" url="?curid=10461" title="Emperor Yūryaku">
<text>(417/18 – 479) was the 21st Emperor of Japan, according to the traditional order of succession. According to the &quot;Kojiki&quot;, this Emperor is said to have ruled from the Thirteenth Day of the Eleventh Month of 456 (Heishin) until his death on the Seventh Day of the Eight Month of 479 (Kibi). He is the first archaeologically verifiable Japanese emperor.

==Protohistoric narrative==
The Japanese have traditionally accepted this sovereign&#x27;s historical existence, and a mausoleum (misasagi) for Yūryaku is currently maintained. The following information available is taken from the pseudo-historical &quot;Kojiki&quot; and &quot;Nihon Shoki&quot;, which are collectively known as or &quot;Japanese chronicles&quot;. These chronicles include legends and myths, as well as potential historical facts that have since been exaggerated and/or distorted over time. It is recorded in the &quot;Kiki&quot; that Yūryaku was born to sometime in 417 or 418 AD, and was given the name . As the fifth and youngest son of Emperor Ingyō he was never given the title of &quot;Crown Prince&quot; due to his two older living brothers.

===Ascension===
Ōhatsuse was thrown into a fit of rage when he learned that his brother Emperor Ankō was assassinated in 456 AD. He then immediately became suspicious of his two elder brothers as conspirers. Ōhatsuse&#x27;s first action was to question Prince Shirahiko regarding what could have happened. Shirahiko allegedly knew Ōhatsuse was up to no good, so he sat silently which prompted Ōhatsuse to kill him both individually with a sword. He then turned his rage towards the boy assassin (Prince Mayowa), and his other brother Kurohiko by burning him to death. This just left Emperor Richū&#x27;s eldest son Prince Ichinobe no Oshiwa in contention for the throne. 

Ōhatsuse was resentful that Ankō had formally wished to transfer the kingdom to Ichinobe. Both the Nihon Shoki and Kojiki describe how Ōhatsuse took Prince Ichinobe and his younger brother Prince Mima out hunting and &quot;treacherously&quot; killed them. The sons of Prince Ichinobe fled to Harima and went into hiding, later becoming Emperor Kenzō and Emperor Ninken. Ōhatsuse (later known as Emperor Yūryaku) was then enthroned sometime afterwards in November 456. The new emperor subsequently made &quot;Asakura no Miya&quot; at Sakurai, Nara the location of his imperial palace. Emperor Richū&#x27;s widow Kusaka no Hatabi no hime was appointed Empress with three concubines in March 457.

===Reign===
According to the &quot;Kiki&quot;, Emperor Yūryaku&#x27;s reign was full of tyranny and cruelty. He allegedly ordered a girl to &quot;have her four limbs stretched on a tree and be roasted to death&quot; due to misplaced affection. Another account states that he killed one of his servants during a hunt because his servant did not understand how to cut up animal meat. Yūryaku also allegedly removed a high official to a distant post so he could help himself to the man&#x27;s wife. The Emperor arbitrary and capriciously killed so many men and women that he was referred to as Emperor of Great Wickedness by the public. However, it is noted that Yūryaku improved his behavior after being admonished by the empress. On a more positive side, Yūryaku greatly encouraged arts and crafts during his reign. Silkworms were cultivated by the Empress, and expert handicraftsmen were commissioned from Baekje (Korea). While the Empress herself never bore Yūryaku any children, he had three sons and two daughters with his concubines.

In the 22nd year of his reign (477 AD) Yūryaku moved the temple of Toyoukeohokami (present: Gaiku temple) from Tamba to Yamada in Ise.

In 463, Yūryaku Tennō invited the thunder god of the Mimuro hill to come to the Imperial Palace, and ordered Chiisakobe no muraji Sugaru to fetch the deity. He obliged, thinking the supernatural being would have no reason to refuse the invitation, and rode carrying a halberd with a red banner, symbolising his office of royal messenger. Soon enough, the thunder struck, and Sugaru enlisted the help of priests to enshrine the kami into a portable carriage, to be brought in the Emperor&#x27;s presence, as a great serpent. But, said Emperor neglected to practice proper ritual purification and religious abstinence. The thunder kami then showed his displeasure through thundering and threatening fiery eyeballs, and Emperor Yūryaku fled into the interior of the Palace while covering his eyes. The great serpent was returned to Mimuro, and the Emperor made many offerings to appease the angry deity. This story is recorded in Nihongi and mentioned by William George Aston, in &quot;Shinto, the Ancient Religion of Japan&quot; as well as several other books.

==Historical assessment==
Yūryaku is regarded by historians as a ruler during the 5th century whose existence is generally accepted as fact. Scholar Francis Brinkley lists Emperor Yūryaku under &quot;Protohistoric sovereigns&quot; where he remarks that while some historians have described him as an &quot;austere&quot; man, &quot;few readers of his annals will be disposed to endure such a lenient verdict.&quot; Scottish Orientalist scholar and journalist James Murdoch regards Yūryaku as a &quot;much maligned person who was a strong if somewhat ferocious ruler.&quot; British academic and author Richard Ponsonby-Fane noted that the Emperor is described as a &quot;mighty hunter&quot; as its recorded that the God &quot;Hitokotonushi&quot; accompanied him in the chase.

A cognitive analysis &quot;as deciphered in the Nihon shoki&quot; was conducted in 2024 by the National Institute of Japanese Literature. In this analysis Emperor Yūryaku was included as an example of &quot;impulsive murder and the tendency to become enraged.&quot; Factors such as &quot;the disproportion between the triggering events&quot;, &quot;the violence expressed by the emperor on such occasions (quite extreme in degree)&quot;, and the &quot;frequent occurrence of such descriptions&quot; were then considered for a conclusion. It is suggested that Emperor Yūryaku may have had an &quot;intermittent explosive disorder, a type of Impulse-control disorder.&quot;

The Emperor&#x27;s interest in poetry is amongst the more well-documented aspects of his character and reign. Poems attributed to him are included in the &quot;Man&#x27;yōshū&quot;, and a number of his verses are preserved in the &quot;Kojiki&quot; and the &quot;Nihonshoki&quot;. Archaeological research has also confirmed that large keyhole-shaped tombs belonging to the chiefs of local ruling families disappeared from around the end of the 5th century when Yūryaku reigned.

Outside of the &quot;Kiki&quot;, the reign of Emperor Kinmei ( – 571 AD) is the first for which contemporary historiography has been able to assign verifiable dates. The conventionally accepted names and dates of the early Emperors were not confirmed as &quot;traditional&quot; though, until the reign of Emperor Kanmu between 737 and 806 AD.

===Great King of Yamoto===

During this moment in history, the calendar system of the Nihon Shoki changes from before and after Yūryaku&#x27;s reign. As his name is mentioned at the beginning of the Man&#x27;yōshū and Nihon Ryōiki, this is seen as a historical turning point. Previously the Japanese archipelago had been a confederation of powerful ruling families from various regions. This appeared to have changed with the appearance of Emperor Yuryaku as the autocratic rule of the Great King was established and a centralized system centered on the Great King began. This is further supported by a major discovery that occurred in 1968 when the iron Inariyama burial-mound sword was extracted from a tomb. In 1978, X-ray analysis revealed a gold-inlaid inscription that comprises at least 115 Chinese characters. The given year on the sword is denoted as &quot;xin-hai&quot; (&quot;Year of the Metal Pig&quot;) according to the Chinese sexagenary cycle, in which the name of the year is recycled every 60 years. While this year is generally regarded in Japan to correspond to 471 AD, at least one historian suggests that 531 is a more likely date. 

The person buried in the tomb is given the name &quot;Wowake&quot;, who was thought to be an influential warrior in the region. King Waka Takiru in the transcription is thought to be the same person as Ōhatsuse-wakatakeru-no-mikoto as mentioned in the &quot;Nihon Shoki&quot;, an alias of Emperor Yūryaku. As each inscription contains the name of an official position, this suggests that a system similar to the Bemin was already in place. While the Eta Funayama Sword also apparently mentions the name &quot;Waka Takiru&quot;, many characters on that sword are illegible possibly due to polishing by a Japanese sword sharpener at the end of the Taisho period. If Yūryaku&#x27;s name can be corroborated to this sword then it can be interpreted that the power of the Great King had already extended from Kyushu to Togoku by the latter half of the 5th century.

There is no evidence to suggest that the title &quot;tennō&quot; (meaning &quot;emperor&quot;) was used during the time to which Yūryaku&#x27;s reign has been assigned. Instead, his title could have possibly been , meaning &quot;the great king who rules all under heaven&quot;, or &quot;Great King of Yamato&quot;. The name Yūryaku&quot;-tennō&quot; was more than likely assigned to him posthumously by later generations. His name might have been regularized centuries after the lifetime ascribed to Yūryaku, possibly during the time in which legends about the origins of the imperial dynasty were compiled as the chronicles known today as the &quot;Kojiki&quot;.

===King Bu===

There is also a theory that Emperor Yūryaku is synonymous with King Bu (武) as written in the Chinese records. According to the Book of Song, Bu dispatched envoys to Emperor Shun of Song (a Southern Chinese dynasty) in both 477 and 478 AD. The first envoy was to inform the Chinese emperor that King Kō (Emperor Ankō) had died, and his older brother had become king. It is written that he called himself &quot;King of Wa&quot;, and the military commander of several different Kingdoms. Its written that in the following year Emperor Shun appointed Bu the title of &quot;Grand&quot; &quot;Peacekeeper-General of the East&quot;. The full context of this latter passage describes how Bu&#x27;s ancestors conquered countries, and expanded their power to the east and west. It describes how they crossed the sea to the north and reached the southern part of the Korean Peninsula. Although the kings of Wa repeatedly requested that the Emperors of the Song dynasty recognize their military control over Baekje, their efforts were denied. The reason for this is thought to be that the Song dynasty placed importance on Baekje, which was located in a strategically important area. By not offering recognition the Song Emperors could put the Northern Wei in check, and avoid opposition from Goguryeo which was in conflict with Wa. Scholar Francis Brinkley notes that the power of the Koma clan (supported by the Liu Song dynasty) in Goguryeo increased steadily during this time. Brinkley suggests that Emperor Yūryaku&#x27;s attempts to establish close relations with the Chinese Emperor seem to be from a desire to isolate Korea, which ended in failure.

The other two recorded instances regarding King Bu are mentioned in the books of Qi, and Liang. As compared to the former mention in 478 AD, these are not considered to be reliable. Japanese historian Mori Kimiaki points out that both of these appointments coincide with the founding year of their respective dynasties. This is thought to be an administrative matter, and it is not clear whether King Bu (Yūryaku) himself requested it or not. There is at least 1 theory that supports the envoy being sent to Southern Qi in 479 as being factual. This is solely based though, on the description in the title of included in . The fourth and final appointment allegedly made by King Bu (Yūryaku) falls outside of his recorded timeline. As the &quot;Kiki&quot; states that Emperor Yūryaku died in 479, the last given year of 502 AD would be implausible.

===Gravesite===
While the actual site of Yūryaku&#x27;s grave is not known, this regent is traditionally venerated at a memorial Shinto shrine (&quot;misasagi&quot;) in Habikino, Osaka. As designated by the Imperial Household Agency as Yūryaku&#x27;s mausoleum, its formal name is &quot;Tajihi no Takawashi-no-hara no misasagi&quot;. Aside from this shrine in Osaka, there is another burial site named where Yūryaku is a possible burial candidate. Those in doubt of this theory though, point to the construction style of the Kofun which may have begun several decades after Emperor Yūryaku&#x27;s death. This has led some researchers to add Emperor Ankan as a burial candidate for the Kofun. Yūryaku is also enshrined at the Imperial Palace along with other emperors and members of the Imperial Family at the Three Palace Sanctuaries. He is additionally deified at the in Gose, Nara.

<doc id="10462" wikidata="Q357273" url="?curid=10462" title="Emperor Seinei">
<text>(444 – 484) was the 22nd emperor of Japan, according to the traditional order of succession.

No firm dates can be assigned to this emperor&#x27;s life or reign, but he is conventionally considered to have reigned from 480 to 484.

==Protohistoric narrative==
The Japanese have traditionally accepted this sovereign&#x27;s historical existence, and a mausoleum (misasagi) for Seinei is currently maintained. The following information available is taken from the pseudo-historical &quot;Kojiki&quot; and &quot;Nihon Shoki&quot;, which are collectively known as or &quot;Japanese chronicles&quot;. These chronicles include legends and myths, as well as potential historical facts that have since been exaggerated and/or distorted over time. It is recorded in the &quot;Kiki&quot; that Seinei was born to sometime in 444 AD, and was given the name .

According to &quot;Kojiki&quot; and &quot;Nihonshoki&quot;, he was a son of Emperor Yūryaku and his consort Katsuragi no Karahime. Seinei&#x27;s full sister was Princess Takuhatahime. His name in birth was . It is said that the color of his hair was white since birth. After the death of his father, Seinei won the fight against Prince Hoshikawa, his brother, for the throne and so succeeded his father.

Seinei fathered no children; however, two grandsons of the 17th Emperor, Emperor Richū, were found—later to ascend as Prince Woke and Prince Oke. Seinei adopted them as his heirs.

==Historical assessment==
Seinei was a 5th-century monarch. The reign of Emperor Kinmei ( – 571 AD), the 29th emperor, is the first for which contemporary historiography is able to assign verifiable dates; however, the conventionally accepted names and dates of the early emperors were not to be confirmed as &quot;traditional&quot; until the reign of Emperor Kanmu (737–806), the 50th sovereign of the imperial dynasty.

Seinei&#x27;s contemporary title would not have been &quot;tennō&quot;, as most historians believe this title was not introduced until the reigns of Emperor Tenmu and Empress Jitō. Rather, it was presumably , meaning &quot;the great king who rules all under heaven&quot;. Alternatively, Seinei might have been referred to as or the &quot;Great King of Yamato&quot;.

The actual site of Seinei&#x27;s grave is not known. The emperor is traditionally venerated at a memorial Shinto shrine (&quot;misasagi&quot;) at Osaka.

The Imperial Household Agency designates this location as Seinei&#x27;s mausoleum. It is formally named &quot;Kawachi no Sakado no hara no misasagi&quot;.

<doc id="10463" wikidata="Q360966" url="?curid=10463" title="Emperor Kenzō">
<text>(450 – 2 June 487) was the 23rd legendary emperor of Japan, according to the traditional order of succession.

No firm dates can be assigned to this emperor&#x27;s life or reign, but he is conventionally considered to have reigned from 1 February 485 to 2 June 487.

==Legendary narrative==
, later to become Emperor Kenzō, is said to have been the grandson of Emperor Richū, and the son of Ichinobe-no Oshiwa. He would have been quite young when Emperor Yūryaku shot the arrow which killed his father during a hunting expedition; and this caused both Prince Woke and his older brother, Prince Oke, to flee for their lives. According to Harima no Kuni Fudoki, they found refuge at Akashi in Harima Province where they hid by living in obscurity. Histories from that period explained that the two brothers sought to blend into this rural community by posing as common herdsmen.

It is said that the Oke came by chance to Akashi; and at that time, Prince Oke revealed his true identity. This intermediary re-introduced the lost cousins to Emperor Seinei, who had by this time ascended to the throne after the death of his father, the former Emperor Yūryaku. Seinei invited both brothers to return the court; and he adopted both of them as sons and heirs.

At Seinei&#x27;s death, he had no other heirs than Prince Oke and Prince Woke, whose father had been killed by Yūraku. At this point, Woke wanted his elder brother to become Emperor; but Oke refused. The two could not reach an agreement. The great men of the court insisted that one or the other of the brothers must accept the throne; but in the end, Woke proved to be more adamant. Prince Woke agreed to accept the throne; and Kenzō was ultimately proclaimed as the new Emperor—which created a sense of relief for all the people who had endured this period of uncertainty.

Kenzō is considered to have ruled the country during the late-5th century, but there is a paucity of information about him. There is insufficient material available for further verification and study.

Kenzō&#x27;s contemporary title would not have been &quot;tennō&quot;, as most historians believe this title was not introduced until the reigns of Emperor Tenmu and Empress Jitō. Rather, it was presumably , meaning &quot;the great king who rules all under heaven&quot;. Alternatively, Kenzō might have been referred to as or the &quot;Great King of Yamato&quot;.

==Kenzō&#x27;s reign==
It is recorded that his capital was at in Yamato Province. The location of the palace is thought to have been in present-day Osaka Prefecture or Nara Prefecture.

Murray reports that the only event of major consequence during Kenzō&#x27;s reign had to do with the filial respect he showed for his murdered father. Kenzō arranged to have his father&#x27;s remains retrieved and re-interred in a mausoleum appropriate for the son of an Emperor and the father of another.

Kenzō died at age 37, reigning only three years. He too had no other heirs; so his brother would follow him on the throne. His Empress was , Prince Oka-no-Wakugo&#x27;s daughter (also Prince Iwaki&#x27;s granddaughter and Emperor Yuryaku&#x27;s great-granddaughter).

The actual site of Kenzō&#x27;s grave is not known. The Emperor is traditionally venerated at a memorial Shinto shrine (&quot;misasagi&quot;) at Osaka.

The Imperial Household Agency designates this location as Kenzō&#x27;s mausoleum. It is formally named &quot;Kataoka no Iwatsuki no oka no kita no misasagi&quot;.

<doc id="10464" wikidata="Q357266" url="?curid=10464" title="Emperor Ninken">
<text>(449 – 9 September 498) was the 24th legendary emperor of Japan, according to the traditional order of succession. No firm dates can be assigned to this emperor&#x27;s life or reign, but he is conventionally considered to have reigned from 4 February 488 to 9 September 498.

==Legendary narrative==
Ninken is considered to have ruled the country during the late-5th century, but there is a paucity of information about him. There is insufficient material available for further verification and study.

In his youth, he was known as . Along with his younger brother, Prince Woke, Oke was raised to greater prominence when Emperor Seinei died without an heir. The two young princes were said to be grandsons of Emperor Richū. Each of these brothers would ascend the throne as adopted heirs of Seinei, although it is unclear whether they had been &quot;found&quot; in Seinei&#x27;s lifetime or only after that.

Oke&#x27;s younger brother, who would become posthumously known as Emperor Kenzō, ascended before his elder brother. This unconventional sequence was in accordance with an agreement made by the two brothers.

==Ninken&#x27;s reign==
When Emperor Kenzo died without heirs, Prince Oke succeeded him as Emperor Ninken.

Ninken&#x27;s contemporary title would not have been &quot;tennō&quot;, as most historians believe this title was not introduced until the reigns of Emperor Tenmu and Empress Jitō. Rather, it was presumably , meaning &quot;the great king who rules all under heaven&quot;. Alternatively, Ninken might have been referred to as or the &quot;Great King of Yamato&quot;.

Ninken married to Emperor Yūryaku&#x27;s daughter Kasuga no Ōiratsume no Himemiko, a second cousin of him. Their daughter Tashiraka was later married to Emperor Keitai, successor or possibly usurper after her brother, and became mother of Emperor Kinmei, a future monarch and lineal ancestor of all future monarchs of Japan. There apparently was also another daughter, Princess Tachibana, who in turn is recorded to have become a wife of Senka and mother of Princess Iwahime, who herself became a consort of Kimmei and bore Emperor Bidatsu, a future monarch and lineal ancestor of current monarchs of Japan.

Ninken was succeeded by his son, who would accede as Emperor Buretsu.

The actual site of Ninken&#x27;s grave is not known. The Emperor is traditionally venerated at a memorial Shinto shrine (&quot;misasagi&quot;) at Osaka.

The Imperial Household Agency designates this location as Ninken&#x27;s mausoleum. It is formally named &quot;Hanyū no Sakamoto no misasagi&quot;.

<doc id="10465" wikidata="Q334644" url="?curid=10465" title="Emperor Buretsu">
<text>(489 – 7 January 507) was the 25th legendary Emperor of Japan, according to the traditional order of succession.

No firm dates can be assigned to this Emperor&#x27;s life or reign, but he is conventionally considered to have reigned from 12 January 499 to 7 January 507.

==Legendary narrative==
Buretsu is considered to have ruled the country during the late-fifth century and early-sixth century, but there is a paucity of information about him. There is insufficient material available for further verification and study.

Buretsu was a son of Emperor Ninken and his mother is . His name was . He had no children.

==Buretsu&#x27;s reign==
Buretsu&#x27;s contemporary title would not have been &quot;tennō&quot;, as most historians believe this title was not introduced until the reigns of Emperor Tenmu and Empress Jitō. Rather, it was presumably , meaning &quot;the great king who rules all under heaven&quot;. Alternatively, Buretsu might have been referred to as or the &quot;Great King of Yamato&quot;.

Buretsu is described as an extremely wicked historical figure. The &quot;Nihonshoki&quot; describes the 11-year-old Buretsu, in 500, cutting open the stomach of a pregnant woman and observing the embryo. In addition to his acts of personal cruelty, during his reign the general welfare of the nation declined severely. According to the &quot;Tenshō&quot;, supposedly compiled by Fujiwara no Hamanari, Buretsu was admonished by Ōtomo no Kanamura. &quot;Nihonshoki&quot; likened his debauchery to Di Xin of the Shang dynasty, but the record in &quot;Kojiki&quot; has no such indication. There are several theories on this difference. Some believe that this was to justify and praise his successor Emperor Keitai, who took over under questionable circumstances, not having been in a position of immediate succession. In history textbooks available before and during World War II, the negative parts of Buretsu&#x27;s record were intentionally omitted.

If Emperor Keitai began a new dynasty as some historians believe, then Buretsu is the last Emperor of the first recorded dynasty of Japan.

The actual site of Buretsu&#x27;s grave is not known. The Emperor is traditionally venerated at a memorial Shinto shrine (&quot;misasagi&quot;) at Nara.

The Imperial Household Agency designates this location as Buretsu&#x27;s mausoleum. It is formally named &quot;Kataoka no Iwatsuki no oka no kita no misasagi&quot;.

<doc id="10466" wikidata="Q349277" url="?curid=10466" title="Emperor Keitai">
<text>(died 10 March 531) was the 26th emperor of Japan, according to the traditional order of succession.

No firm dates can be assigned to this emperor&#x27;s life or reign, but he is conventionally considered to have reigned from 3 March 507 to 10 March 531.

==Legendary narrative==
Keitai is considered to have ruled the country during the early 6th century, but there is a paucity of information about him. There is insufficient material available for further verification and study. Significant differences exist in the records of the &quot;Kojiki&quot; and the &quot;Nihon Shoki&quot;.

The &quot;Kojiki&quot; puts this emperor&#x27;s birth year at 485; and his date of death is said to have been April 9, 527. In the extant account, he is called .

The &quot;Nihon Shoki&quot; gives his birth year at 450; and he is said to have died on February 7, 531 or 534. In this historical record, he is said to have been called and .

In other historical records, he is said to have originally been King of Koshi, a smaller tribal entity, apparently in northern parts of central Japan, perhaps as far as the coast of Sea of Japan. Some modern reference works of history call Keitai simply &quot;King Ohodo of Koshi&quot;.

Keitai&#x27;s contemporary title would not have been &quot;tennō&quot;, as most historians believe this title was not introduced until the reigns of Emperor Tenmu and Empress Jitō. Rather, it was presumably , meaning &quot;the great king who rules all under heaven&quot;. Alternatively, Keitai might have been referred to as or the &quot;Great King of Yamato&quot;.

===Genealogy===
Keitai was not the son of the immediate previous monarch. According to the &quot;Kojiki&quot; and &quot;Nihon Shoki&quot;, Buretsu died without a successor, at which time a fifth generation grandson of Emperor Ōjin, Keitai, came and ascended the throne.

If Emperor Keitai began a new dynasty as some historians believe, then Emperor Buretsu would have been the last monarch of the first recorded dynasty of Japan.

According to the &quot;Kojiki&quot; and &quot;Nihon Shoki&quot;, his father was and his mother was . When Buretsu died, Kanamura recommended Keitai (at the age of 58) as a possible heir to the Chrysanthemum throne. His mother, Furihime, was a seventh generation descendant of Emperor Suinin by his son, Prince Iwatsukuwake. His father was a fourth generation descendant of Emperor Ōjin by his son, Prince Wakanuke no Futamata.

Genealogy information is supplemented in &quot;Shaku Nihongi&quot; which quotes from the now lost text &quot;Jōgūki&quot; (7th century). It says he was a son of Ushi no Ōkimi (believed to be equivalent to Hikoushi no Ōkimi), a grandson of Ohi no Ōkimi, a great-grandson of Ohohoto no Ōkimi (brother to Emperor Ingyō&#x27;s consort), a great-great-grandson of Prince Wakanuke no Futamata, and a great-great-great-grandson of Emperor Ōjin.

The genealogical trees of the &quot;Nihon Shoki&quot; have been lost, and the accuracy of its account of events remains unknown. This uncertainty raises arguable doubts about this emperor&#x27;s genealogy.

Although genealogical information in the &quot;Shaku Nihongi&quot; leaves room for discussion, many scholars acknowledge the blood relationship with the Okinaga clan, a powerful local ruling family or the collateral line of the Imperial family-governed Ōmi region (a part of present-day Shiga Prefecture). This family produced many empresses and consorts throughout history. According to the &quot;Nihon Shoki&quot;, Ohohoto no Ōkimi, the great-grandfather of Emperor Keitai, married into the Okinaga clan. Keitai&#x27;s mother, Furihime, was from a local ruling family in Koshi (Echizen Province), so his mother brought him to her home after his father&#x27;s death. Abundant traditions relating to the family have been passed down by shrines and old-established families in both regions.

Regardless of speculation about Keitai&#x27;s genealogy, it is well settled that there was an extended period of disputes over the succession which developed after Keitai&#x27;s death. A confrontation arose between adherents of two branches of the Yamato, pitting the supporters of sons who would become known as Emperor Ankan and Emperor Senka against those who were backers of the son who would become known as Emperor Kinmei.

==Keitai&#x27;s reign==
Keitai declared his ascension in Kuzuha, in the northern part of Kawachi Province (present day Hirakata, Osaka), and married a younger sister of Emperor Buretsu, Princess Tashiraka. It is supposed that his succession was not welcomed by everyone, and it took about 20 years for Keitai to enter Yamato Province, near Kawachi and the political center of Japan at the time.

In Keitai&#x27;s later years, 527 or 528, the Iwai Rebellion broke out in Tsukushi province, Kyūshū. Keitai assigned Mononobe no Arakabi as Shōgun and sent him to Kyūshū to put down the rebellion.

Among his sons, Emperor Ankan, Emperor Senka and Emperor Kinmei ascended to the throne.

The actual site of Keitai&#x27;s grave is not known. He is traditionally venerated at a memorial Shinto shrine (&quot;misasagi&quot;) at the Ooda Chausuyama kofun in Ibaraki, Osaka.

The Imperial Household Agency designates this location as Keitai&#x27;s mausoleum. It is formally named &quot;Mishima no Aikinu no misasagi&quot;.

The most noteworthy event recorded during his reign was the construction of state granaries in large numbers throughout Japan, indicating the broad reach of imperial power at the time.

Ankan&#x27;s grave is traditionally associated with the Takayatsukiyama kofun in Habikino, Osaka.

<doc id="10468" wikidata="Q329728" url="?curid=10468" title="Emperor Senka">
<text>(466 — 15 March 539) was the 28th legendary emperor of Japan, according to the traditional order of succession.

No firm dates can be assigned to this emperor&#x27;s life or reign, but he is conventionally considered to have reigned from 25 January 536 to 15 March 539, the end of the Kofun period, which was followed by the Asuka period.

==Legendary narrative==
Senka is considered to have ruled the country during the early-6th century, but there is a paucity of information about him. There is insufficient material available for further verification and study.

When Emperor Ankan died, he had no offspring; and succession passed to his youngest brother , who will come to be known as Emperor Senka. Emperor Senka was elderly at the time of his enthronement; and his reign is said to have endured for only three years.

Senka&#x27;s contemporary title would not have been &quot;tennō&quot;, as most historians believe this title was not introduced until the reigns of Emperor Tenmu and Empress Jitō. Rather, it was presumably , meaning &quot;the great king who rules all under heaven&quot;. Alternatively, Senka might have been referred to as or the &quot;Great King of Yamato&quot;.

During this reign, Soga no Iname is believed to have been the first verifiable &quot;Omi&quot; (also &quot;Ōomi&quot;, &quot;Great Minister&quot;).

The Emperor is traditionally venerated at a memorial Shinto shrine (&quot;misasagi&quot;) at Nara. The Imperial Household Agency designates this location as Senka&#x27;s mausoleum. It is formally named &quot;Musa no Tsukisaka no e no misasagi&quot;; however, the actual sites of the graves of the early Emperors remain problematic, according to some historians and archaeologists.

<doc id="10470" wikidata="Q5330810" url="?curid=10470" title="Eastmoreland, Portland, Oregon">
<text>Eastmoreland is a residential neighborhood consisting almost entirely of single family homes in inner southeast Portland, Oregon, United States. Eastmoreland was named for a local real estate developer, Judge J.C. Moreland.

== Description ==
The neighborhood is bounded on the north by SE Woodstock Boulevard. The western boundary is a combination of SE McLoughlin Boulevard, SE Reedway Street, and SE 26th Avenue. Johnson Creek serves as most of the neighborhood&#x27;s southern boundary, which meets its eastern boundary between SE Tenino Street and SE Crystal Springs Boulevard., SE César E. Chávez Boulevard. Its northern border winds around the Reed College campus and continues on SE Steele Street until meeting its western boundary.

Eastmoreland is filled with trees and lush landscaping. Public parks in Eastmoreland include Crystal Springs Rhododendron Garden (1923), Eastmoreland Golf Course (1916), Eastmoreland Garden (2004), Eastmoreland Playground Park (1916), and Berkeley Park (1941). There is also a median on Reed College Place which is owned by Portland Department of Transportation and maintained by Portland Parks &amp; Recreation. The Shakespeare Garden at Eastmoreland was designed by Florence Holmes Gerke.

Eastmoreland is home to two schools, Duniway Elementary School (constructed in 1926 and named for Abigail Scott Duniway) and Holy Family Catholic School.

== Proposed historic district ==

A proposed Eastermoreland Historic District encompasses approximately 475 acres within southeast Portland&#x27;s Eastmoreland neighborhood, and is generally bounded by Woodstock Boulevard on the north, Cesar Chavez Boulevard and 36th Avenue on the east, Berkeley Park and Crystal Springs Boulevard on the south, and 27th and 28th Avenues on the west.

The proposed historic district was nominated by the Eastmoreland Neighborhood Association in an attempt to reduce the number of home demolitions and renovations. The bid has been contentious, as historic designation would prevent owners from being able to expand or update houses.

In February 2017, the Portland Historic Landmarks Commission endorsed the association&#x27;s nomination for historic status. One week later, the nine-person State Advisory Committee on Historic Preservation unanimously endorsed the proposal, putting the district on &quot;clear path toward the register&quot;. Historic status may be blocked if dissenting residents submit enough notarized objections by July 1. As of February 17, 675 of the more than 1,000 required objections have been received.

In April 2018, four separate home owners split their property ownership among hundreds of trusts; these owners filed more than 5,000 formal objections to the historic district proposal, possibly blocking the nomination using a technical tactic. 952 additional objections were submitted by owners not associated with the hundreds of trusts. According to &quot;The Oregonian&quot;, &quot;Without the trusts, the number of objections appears to have fallen short of a majority&quot;. The neighborhood association&#x27;s president described the maneuver as &quot;undemocratic&quot; and said, &quot;If this was an election, it would be called voter fraud.&quot; The Oregon State Historic Preservation Office said, &quot;According to federal rules, if more than 50% of the owners in a district submit objections, the property cannot be listed.&quot;

Trust owners&#x27; being counted as eligible owners was challenged in court and a new rule for counting objections was established in 2022. A new application will be submitted to the National Park Service.

<doc id="10473" wikidata="Q115478" url="?curid=10473" title="Emil Theodor Kocher">
<text>Emil Theodor Kocher (25 August 1841 – 27 July 1917) was a Swiss physician and medical researcher who received the 1909 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his work in the physiology, pathology and surgery of the thyroid. Among his many accomplishments are the introduction and promotion of aseptic surgery and scientific methods in surgery, specifically reducing the mortality of thyroidectomies below 1% in his operations.

Kocher was the first Swiss citizen and first surgeon to ever receive a Nobel Prize in Medicine. He was considered a pioneer and leader in the field of surgery in his time.

== Early life and personal life ==
=== Childhood ===
Kocher&#x27;s father was Jakob Alexander Kocher (1814–1893), the sixth of seven children to Samuel Kocher (1771–1842), a carpenter, and Barbara Sutter (1772–1849). Jakob Alexander Kocher was a railway engineer and he moved in 1845 to Burgdorf, Switzerland (near Bern), because of his job as regional engineer of Emmental (&quot;Bezirksingenieur&quot;). He was named chief engineer for street and water in the canton of Bern at the age of 34 years and he moved with his family to the capital, the city of Bern. In 1858 he left the states service and managed several engineering projects around Bern.

Theodor Kocher&#x27;s mother was Maria Kocher (née Wermuth) living from 1820 to 1900. She was a very religious woman and part of the Moravian Church; together with Jakob Alexander, she raised a family of five sons and one daughter (Theodor Kocher was the second son).

Theodor Kocher was born on 25 August 1841 in Bern and baptized in the local Bern Minster on 16 September 1841. Together with the family, he moved to Burgdorf in 1845 where he started school. Later his family moved back to Bern where he went to middle and high school (&quot;Realschule&quot; and &quot;Literaturgymnasium&quot;) where he was the first of his class. During high school, Theodor was interested in many subjects and was specifically drawn to art and classical philology but finally decided to become a doctor.

=== Studies ===
He started his studies after obtaining the Swiss Matura in 1858 at the University of Bern where Anton Biermer and Hermann Askan Demme were teaching, two professors that impressed him most. He was a studious and dedicated student but still became a member of the Schweizerischer Zofingerverein, a Swiss fraternity.
He obtained his doctorate in Bern in 1865 (March 1865) or 1866 with his dissertation about &quot;Behandlung der croupösen Pneumonie mit Veratrum-Präparaten&quot; (literal English translation: &quot;The treatment of croupous pneumonia with Veratrum preparations.&quot;) under professor Biermer with the predicate &quot;summa cum laude unamimiter&quot;.

In spring 1865, Kocher followed his teacher Biermer to Zürich, where Theodor Billroth was director of the hospital and influenced Kocher significantly. Kocher then proceeded to start a journey through Europe to meet several of the most famous surgeons of the time. It is not clear how Kocher financed his trip but according to Bonjour (1981) he received money from an unknown female Suisse romande philanthropist who also supported his friend Marc Dufour and was probably a member of the Moravian Church. In October 1865, he traveled to Berlin, passing through Leipzig and visiting an old friend from high school, Hans Blum. In Berlin, he studied under Bernhard von Langenbeck and applied for an assistant position with Langenbeck and Rudolf Virchow. Since there was no position available, in April 1867 Kocher moved on to London where he first met Jonathan Hutchinson and then worked for Henry Thompson and John Erichsen. Furthermore, he was interested in the work of Isaac Baker Brown and Thomas Spencer Wells, who also invited Kocher to go to the opera with his family. In July 1867, he traveled on to Paris to meet Auguste Nélaton, Auguste Verneuil and Louis Pasteur. During his travels, he did not only learn novel techniques but also got to know leading surgeons in person and learned to speak English fluently which allowed him later on to follow the scientific progress in the English speaking world with ease.

Once returned to Bern, Kocher prepared for his habilitation and on 12 October 1867, he wrote a petition to the ministry of education to award him the &quot;venia docendi&quot; (Latin: &quot;to instruct&quot;) which was granted to him. He became assistant to Georg Lücke who left Bern in 1872 to become professor in Strasbourg. Kocher was hoping to get his position, but at the time it was customary to appoint German professors to positions at Swiss universities. Accordingly, the faculty suggested Franz König before Kocher to follow Lücke. However, the students and assistants as well as many doctors preferred Kocher and started a petition to the Bernese government to choose Kocher. Also the press was in favor of Kocher and several famous foreign surgeons, such as Langenbeck from Berlin and Billroth from Vienna, wrote letters in support of Kocher. Under this public pressure, the Bernese government (&quot;Regierungsrat&quot;) chose Kocher as the successor of Lücke as Ordinary Professor of Surgery and Director of the University Surgical Clinic at the &quot;Inselspital&quot; on 16 March 1872, despite a different proposal by the faculty.

=== Personal life ===
In 1869, Kocher married Marie Witschi-Courant (1841–1921) or (1850–1925). She was the daughter of Johannes Witschi, who was a merchant, and she had three sons together with Kocher. The Kochers first lived at the Marktgasse in Bern and moved in 1875 to a bigger house in the Villette. The house became a place for friends, colleagues and guests to gather and many patients from Kocher&#x27;s clinic were invited to dine at the Villette.

Like his mother, Kocher was a deeply religious man and also part of the Moravian Church. This was an uncommon trait that not many colleagues and co-workers shared and until his death, Kocher attributed all his successes and failures to God. He thought that the rise of materialism (especially in science) was a great evil, and he attributed the outbreak of the First World War.

Kocher was involved in the education of his three sons and played tennis with them and went horseback riding with them. The eldest son Albert (1872–1941) would follow him to the surgical clinic in Bern and become Assistant Professor of Surgery.

On the evening of 23 July 1917, he was called into the Inselspital for an emergency. Kocher executed the surgery but afterwards felt unwell and went to bed, working on scientific notes. He then fell unconscious and died on 27 July 1917.

== Career ==
The call for an ordinary professorship at the University of Bern at the age of 30 was the first big career step for Theodor Kocher. In the 45 years he served as professor at the university, he oversaw the re-building of the famous Bernese Inselspital, published 249 scholarly articles and books, trained numerous medical doctors and treated thousands of patients. He made major contributions to the fields of applied surgery, neurosurgery and, especially, thyroid surgery and endocrinology. For his work he received, among other honors, the 1909 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. According to Asher, the field of surgery has transformed radically during the time of Theodore Kocher and later generations will build on the foundations created by Kocher – if a future historian wanted to describe the state of surgery at the beginning of the 20th century, he only need mention Kocher&#x27;s &quot;Text-Book of Operative Surgery&quot;. 

Three main factors contributed to Kocher&#x27;s success as a surgeon, according to Bonjour (1981). The first factor was his consequent implementation of antiseptic wound treatment which prevented infection and later death of the patients. The second factor, according to Erich Hintzsche, was his monitoring of the anesthesia where he used special masks and later used local anesthesia for goitre surgery which decreased or removed the dangers of anesthesia. As a third factor, Hintzsche mentions the minimal blood loss which Kocher achieved. Even the smallest source of blood during surgery was precisely controlled and inhibited by Kocher, initially because he thought that decomposing blood would constitute an infection risk for the patient. 

=== Early career ===
Kocher first attained international recognition with his method to reset a dislocated shoulder published in 1870. The new procedure was much less painful and safer than the traditionally used procedure and could be performed by a single physician. Kocher developed the procedure through his knowledge of anatomy. In the same period, Kocher also studied the phenomena of bullet wounds and how they can cause bone fractures. From these studies resulted one public lecture in 1874 &quot;Die Verbesserung der Geschosse vom Standpunkt der Humanitaet&quot; (English: &quot;The improvement of the bullets from the standpoint of humanity.&quot;) and an 1875 manuscript &quot;Ueber die Sprengwirkung der modernen Kriegsgewehrgeschosse&quot; (English: &quot;Over the explosive effect of modern war rifle bullets.&quot;) He showed that small caliber bullets were less harmful and recommended to use bullets with slower speed.

=== Relocation of Inselspital and call to Prague ===
As soon as Kocher became professor, he wanted to modernize the practices at the Bernese Inselspital. He noticed that the old building did not suffice the modern standards and was too small – half of the patients seeking medical attention had to be turned away. In spring 1878, he visited several institutions around Europe to evaluate novel innovations for hospitals and implement them if possible in Bern. He wrote down his observations in a lengthy report for the Bernese government, giving instructions even for architectonic details. In a speech on 15 November 1878, he informed the general public about the pressing needs of a new hospital building. Finally, he used his call to Prague to pressure the government: He would only stay in Bern if he was either granted 75 beds in the new building or would get money to increase his facilities in the old building. Finally, in the winter of 1884/1885 the new building was finished and the Inselspital could be moved.

At the time, Prague had the third largest university clinic in the German speaking world and it was a great honor for Kocher when he received a call as a professor to Prague in spring 1880. Many colleagues, especially international ones, urged Kocher to accept while Bernese doctors and colleagues begged him to stay. Kocher used this call, to demand certain improvements for the university clinic from the Bernese government. They accepted all his demands, the government promised him to begin building the new Inselspital building the next year, increased his credit for surgical equipment and books to 1000 franks and increased the number of beds for Kocher in the new Inselspital. Thus, Kocher decided to stay and many Bernese and Swiss students and professionals thanked him for it. He cited the affection of his students as one of his main reasons for staying. The university students organized a torchlight procession on 8 June 1880 in his honor.

=== Aseptic surgery ===
It is unclear whether Kocher directly knew Joseph Lister, who pioneered the antiseptic (using chemical means to kill bacteria) method, but Kocher was in correspondence with him. Kocher had recognized the importance of aseptic techniques early on, introducing them to his peers at a time when this was considered revolutionary. In a hospital report from 1868, he attributed the lower mortality directly to the &quot;antiseptic Lister&#x27;s wound bandaging method&quot; and he could later as director of the clinic order strict adherence to the antiseptic method. Bonjour (1981) describes how his assistants were worried about wound infection for fear of having to explain their failure to Kocher himself. Kocher made it a matter of principle to investigate the cause of every wound infection and remove every potential source of infection, he also banned visitors from his surgeries for this reason.

He published multiple works on aseptic treatment and surgery.

=== Contributions to Neurosurgery ===
Kocher also contributed significantly to the field of neurology and neurosurgery. In this area, his research was pioneering and covered the areas of concussion, neurosurgery and intracranial pressure (ICP). Furthermore, he investigated the surgical treatment of epilepsy and spinal and cranial trauma. He found that in some cases, the epilepsy patients had a brain tumor which could be surgically removed. He hypothesized that epilepsy was caused by an increase in ICP and believed that drainage of cerebrospinal fluid could cure epilepsy.

The Japanese surgeon Hayazo Ito came to Bern in 1896 in order to perform experimental research on epilepsy. Kocher was especially interested in the ICP during experimentally induced epilepsy and after Ito returned to Japan, he performed over 100 surgeries in epilepsy patients.

The American surgeon Harvey Cushing spent several months in the lab of Kocher in 1900, performing cerebral surgery and first encountering the Cushing reflex which describes the relationship between blood pressure and intracranial pressure. Kocher later also found that decompressive craniectomy was an effective method to lower ICP.

In his surgery textbook &quot;Chirurgische Operationslehre&quot;, Kocher dedicated 141 pages of 1060 pages to surgery of the nervous system. It included methods of exploration and decompression of the brain.

=== Contributions to Thyroid surgery ===
Thyroid surgery, which was mostly performed as treatment of goitre with a complete thyroidectomy when possible, was considered a risky procedure when Kocher started his work. Some estimates put the mortality of thyroidectomy as high as 75% in 1872. Indeed, the operation was believed to be one of the most dangerous operations and in France it was prohibited by the Academy of Medicine at the time. Through application of modern surgical methods, such as antiseptic wound treatment and minimizing blood loss, and the famous slow and precise style of Kocher, he managed to reduce the mortality of this operation from an already low 18% (compared to contemporary standards) to less than 0.5% by 1912. By then, Kocher had performed over 5000 thyroid excisions. The success of Kocher&#x27;s methods, especially when compared to operations performed by Theodor Billroth who was also performing thyroidectomies at that time, was described by William Stewart Halsted as follows:
Kocher and others later discovered that the complete removal of the thyroid could lead to cretinism (termed &quot;cachexia strumipriva&quot; by Kocher) caused by a deficiency of thyroid hormones. The phenomena was reported to Kocher first in 1874 by the general practitioner August Fetscherin and later in 1882 by Jacques-Louis Reverdin together with his assistant Auguste Reverdin (1848–1908). Reverdin met Kocher on 7 September in Geneva at the international hygienic congress (&quot;internationaler Hygienekongress&quot;) and expressed his concerns about complete removal of the thyroid to Kocher. Kocher then tried to contact 77 of his 102 former patients and found signs of a physical and mental decay in those cases where he had removed the thyroid gland completely. Ironically, it was his precise surgery that allowed Kocher to remove the thyroid gland almost completely and led to the severe side effects of cretinism.

Kocher came to the conclusion that a complete removal of the thyroid (as it was common to perform at the time because the function of the thyroid was not yet clear) was not advisable, a finding that he made public on 4 April 1883 in a lecture to the German Society of Surgery and also published in 1883 under the title &quot;Ueber Kropfexstirpation und ihre Folgen&quot; (English: &quot;About Thyroidectomies and their consequences&quot;). Reverdin had already made his findings public on 13 September 1882 and published further articles on this topic in 1883; yet still Kocher never acknowledged Reverdin&#x27;s priority in this discovery. At the time, the reactions to Kocher&#x27;s lecture were mixed, some people asserted that goitre and cretinism were different stages of same disease and that cretinism would have occurred independently of the removal of the thyroid in the cases which Kocher described. In the long run however, these observations contributed to a more complete understanding of thyroid function and were one of the early hints of a connection between the thyroid and congenital cretinism. These findings finally enabled thyroid hormone replacement therapies for a variety of thyroid related diseases.

=== Further contributions to science ===
Kocher published works on a number of subjects other than the thyroid gland, including hemostasis, antiseptic treatments, surgical infectious diseases, on gunshot wounds, acute osteomyelitis, the theory of strangulated hernia, and abdominal surgery. The Nobel Prize money he received helped him establish the Kocher Institute in Bern. 

A number of instruments (for example the craniometer) and surgical techniques (for example, the Kocher manoeuvre, and kocher incision) are named after him, as well as the Kocher-Debre-Semelaigne syndrome. The Kocher manoeuvre is still a standard practice in orthopaedics. Kocher is also credited for the invention in 1882 of the Kocher&#x27;s Surgical Clamp, which he used to prevent blood loss during surgery.

One of his main works, &quot;Chirurgische Operationslehre&quot; (Text-Book of Operative Surgery ), was published through six editions and translated into many languages.

During his life, Kocher published 249 articles and books and supervised more than 130 doctoral candidates. He was rector of the university in 1878 and 1903. He was president of the Bernese and the Swiss physicians association and co-founded the Swiss society for surgery in 1913 and became its first president.

In 1904 or 1905 he built a private clinic called &quot;Ulmenhof&quot; which had space for 25 patients. Here Kocher catered to the wealthier patients, which in many cases were international. He also treated the wife of Lenin, Nadezhda Krupskaya and operated on her in Bern (in 1913).

== Legacy ==
Kocher was also a famous and loved teacher. During nearly 100 semesters he taught his knowledge to about 10 000 students of the University of Bern. He was able to inspire students and taught them to think clearly and logically. Specifically, Kocher also taught a generation of Jewish-Russian students who could not study in Russia. This association with Russia has also led the Russian Geographical Society to name a volcano after him (in the area of Ujun-Choldongi in Manchuria ).

Among his many local and international students were
Carl Arend (Bern),
Oscar Bernhard (St. Moritz), 
Andrea Crotti (Ohio),
Gustave Dardel (Bern),
Carl Garré (Bonn),
Gottlieb and Max Feurer (St. Gallen),
Anton Fonio (Langnau),

Hans Wildbolz (Bern) as well as 
the American neurosurgeon Harvey Cushing. Other notable students of his include Hayazo Ito (1865–1929) and S. Berezowsky which also spread his techniques in their respective home-countries (Japan and Russia).

Kocher&#x27;s name is living on with the Theodor Kocher Institute, the Kochergasse and the Kocher Park in Bern. In the Inselspital, there is a bust of Kocher, created by Karl Hänny in 1927. In the Kocher Park there is another bust, created by Max Fueter.
In 1950, the Swiss historian Edgar Bonjour (1898–1991) who was married to Dora Kocher wrote a 136-page monograph on Kocher&#x27;s life that was extended again in 1981.

<text>The eight queens puzzle is the problem of placing eight chess queens on an 8×8 chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other; thus, a solution requires that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal. There are 92 solutions. The problem was first posed in the mid-19th century. In the modern era, it is often used as an example problem for various computer programming techniques.

The eight queens puzzle is a special case of the more general &quot;n&quot; queens problem of placing &quot;n&quot; non-attacking queens on an &quot;n&quot;×&quot;n&quot; chessboard. Solutions exist for all natural numbers &quot;n&quot; with the exception of &quot;n&quot; = 2 and &quot;n&quot; = 3. Although the exact number of solutions is only known for &quot;n&quot; ≤ 27, the asymptotic growth rate of the number of solutions is approximately (0.143 &quot;n&quot;)&quot;n&quot;.

==History==
Chess composer Max Bezzel published the eight queens puzzle in 1848. Franz Nauck published the first solutions in 1850. Nauck also extended the puzzle to the &quot;n&quot; queens problem, with &quot;n&quot; queens on a chessboard of &quot;n&quot;×&quot;n&quot; squares.

Since then, many mathematicians, including Carl Friedrich Gauss, have worked on both the eight queens puzzle and its generalized &quot;n&quot;-queens version. In 1874, S. Günther proposed a method using determinants to find solutions. J.W.L. Glaisher refined Gunther&#x27;s approach.

In 1972, Edsger Dijkstra used this problem to illustrate the power of what he called structured programming. He published a highly detailed description of a depth-first backtracking algorithm.

== Constructing and counting solutions when &quot;n&quot; = 8 ==
The problem of finding all solutions to the 8-queens problem can be quite computationally expensive, as there are 4,426,165,368 possible arrangements of eight queens on an 8×8 board, but only 92 solutions. It is possible to use shortcuts that reduce computational requirements or rules of thumb that avoids brute-force computational techniques. For example, by applying a simple rule that chooses one queen from each column, it is possible to reduce the number of possibilities to 16,777,216 (that is, 88) possible combinations. Generating permutations further reduces the possibilities to just 40,320 (that is, 8!), which can then be checked for diagonal attacks.

The eight queens puzzle has 92 distinct solutions. If solutions that differ only by the symmetry operations of rotation and reflection of the board are counted as one, the puzzle has 12 solutions. These are called &quot;fundamental&quot; solutions; representatives of each are shown below.

A fundamental solution usually has eight variants (including its original form) obtained by rotating 90, 180, or 270° and then reflecting each of the four rotational variants in a mirror in a fixed position. However, one of the 12 fundamental solutions (solution 12 below) is identical to its own 180° rotation, so has only four variants (itself and its reflection, its 90° rotation and the reflection of that). Thus, the total number of distinct solutions is 11×8 + 1×4 = 92.

All fundamental solutions are presented below:











Solution 10 has the additional property that no three queens are in a straight line.

==Existence of solutions==

Brute-force algorithms to count the number of solutions are computationally manageable for , but would be intractable for problems of , as 20! = 2.433 × 1018. If the goal is to find a single solution, one can show solutions exist for all &quot;n&quot; ≥ 4 with no search whatsoever.
These solutions exhibit stair-stepped patterns, as in the following examples for &quot;n&quot; = 8, 9 and 10:



The examples above can be obtained with the following formulas. Let (&quot;i&quot;, &quot;j&quot;) be the square in column &quot;i&quot; and row &quot;j&quot; on the &quot;n&quot; × &quot;n&quot; chessboard, &quot;k&quot; an integer.

One approach is

# If the remainder from dividing &quot;n&quot; by 6 is not 2 or 3 then the list is simply all even numbers followed by all odd numbers not greater than &quot;n&quot;.
# Otherwise, write separate lists of even and odd numbers (2, 4, 6, 8 – 1, 3, 5, 7).
# If the remainder is 2, swap 1 and 3 in odd list and move 5 to the end (3, 1, 7, 5).
# If the remainder is 3, move 2 to the end of even list and 1,3 to the end of odd list (4, 6, 8, 2 – 5, 7, 9, 1, 3).
# Append odd list to the even list and place queens in the rows given by these numbers, from left to right (a2, b4, c6, d8, e3, f1, g7, h5).

For this results in fundamental solution 1 above. A few more examples follow.
* 14 queens (remainder 2): 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 3, 1, 7, 9, 11, 13, 5.
* 15 queens (remainder 3): 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 2, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 1, 3.
* 20 queens (remainder 2): 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 3, 1, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 5.

==Counting solutions for other sizes &quot;n&quot;==
===Exact enumeration===
There is no known formula for the exact number of solutions for placing &quot;n&quot; queens on an board i.e. the number of independent sets of size &quot;n&quot; in an queen&#x27;s graph. The 27×27 board is the highest-order board that has been completely enumerated. The following tables give the number of solutions to the &quot;n&quot; queens problem, both fundamental and all , for all known cases.
The number of placements in which furthermore no three queens lie on any straight line is known for formula_1 .

=== Asymptotic enumeration ===
In 2021, Michael Simkin proved that for large numbers &quot;n&quot;, the number of solutions of the &quot;n&quot; queens problem is approximately formula_2. More precisely, the number formula_3 of solutions has asymptotic growth
formula_4
where formula_5 is a constant that lies between 1.939 and 1.945. (Here &quot;o&quot;(1) represents little o notation.)

If one instead considers a toroidal chessboard (where diagonals &quot;wrap around&quot; from the top edge to the bottom and from the left edge to the right), it is only possible to place &quot;n&quot; queens on an formula_6 board if formula_7 In this case, the asymptotic number of solutions is
formula_8

==Related problems==
;Higher dimensions
:Find the number of non-attacking queens that can be placed in a &quot;d&quot;-dimensional chess of size &quot;n&quot;. More than &quot;n&quot; queens can be placed in some higher dimensions (the smallest example is four non-attacking queens in a 3×3×3 chess space), and it is in fact known that for any &quot;k&quot;, there are higher dimensions where &quot;n&quot;&quot;k&quot; queens do not suffice to attack all spaces.
;Using pieces other than queens
:On an 8×8 board one can place 32 knights, or 14 bishops, 16 kings or 8 rooks, so that no two pieces attack each other. In the case of knights, an easy solution is to place one on each square of a given color, since they move only to the opposite color. The solution is also easy for rooks and kings. Sixteen kings can be placed on the board by dividing it into 2-by-2 squares and placing the kings at equivalent points on each square. Placements of &quot;n&quot; rooks on an &quot;n&quot;×&quot;n&quot; board are in direct correspondence with order-&quot;n&quot; permutation matrices.
;Chess variations
:Related problems can be asked for chess variations such as shogi. For instance, the &quot;n&quot;+&quot;k&quot; dragon kings problem asks to place &quot;k&quot; shogi pawns and &quot;n&quot;+&quot;k&quot; mutually nonattacking dragon kings on an &quot;n&quot;×&quot;n&quot; shogi board.
;Nonstandard boards
:Pólya studied the &quot;n&quot; queens problem on a toroidal (&quot;donut-shaped&quot;) board and showed that there is a solution on an &quot;n&quot;×&quot;n&quot; board if and only if &quot;n&quot; is not divisible by 2 or 3.
;Domination
:Given an &quot;n&quot;×&quot;n&quot; board, the domination number is the minimum number of queens (or other pieces) needed to attack or occupy every square. For &quot;n&quot; = 8 the queen&#x27;s domination number is 5.
;Queens and other pieces
:Variants include mixing queens with other pieces; for example, placing &quot;m&quot; queens and &quot;m&quot; knights on an &quot;n&quot;×&quot;n&quot; board so that no piece attacks another or placing queens and pawns so that no two queens attack each other.
;Magic squares
:In 1992, Demirörs, Rafraf, and Tanik published a method for converting some magic squares into &quot;n&quot;-queens solutions, and vice versa.
;Latin squares
:In an &quot;n&quot;×&quot;n&quot; matrix, place each digit 1 through &quot;n&quot; in &quot;n&quot; locations in the matrix so that no two instances of the same digit are in the same row or column.
;Exact cover
:Consider a matrix with one primary column for each of the &quot;n&quot; ranks of the board, one primary column for each of the &quot;n&quot; files, and one secondary column for each of the 4&quot;n&quot; − 6 nontrivial diagonals of the board. The matrix has &quot;n&quot;2 rows: one for each possible queen placement, and each row has a 1 in the columns corresponding to that square&#x27;s rank, file, and diagonals and a 0 in all the other columns. Then the &quot;n&quot; queens problem is equivalent to choosing a subset of the rows of this matrix such that every primary column has a 1 in precisely one of the chosen rows and every secondary column has a 1 in at most one of the chosen rows; this is an example of a generalized exact cover problem, of which sudoku is another example.
; &quot;n&quot;-queens completion
:The completion problem asks whether, given an &quot;n&quot;×&quot;n&quot; chessboard on which some queens are already placed, it is possible to place a queen in every remaining row so that no two queens attack each other. This and related questions are NP-complete and #P-complete. Any placement of at most &quot;n&quot;/60 queens can be completed, while there are partial configurations of roughly &quot;n&quot;/4 queens that cannot be completed.

==Exercise in algorithm design==

Finding all solutions to the eight queens puzzle is a good example of a simple but nontrivial problem. For this reason, it is often used as an example problem for various programming techniques, including nontraditional approaches such as constraint programming, logic programming or genetic algorithms. Most often, it is used as an example of a problem that can be solved with a recursive algorithm, by phrasing the &quot;n&quot; queens problem inductively in terms of adding a single queen to any solution to the problem of placing &quot;n&quot;−1 queens on an &quot;n&quot;×&quot;n&quot; chessboard. The induction bottoms out with the solution to the &#x27;problem&#x27; of placing 0 queens on the chessboard, which is the empty chessboard.

This technique can be used in a way that is much more efficient than the naïve brute-force search algorithm, which considers all 648 = 248 = 281,474,976,710,656 possible blind placements of eight queens, and then filters these to remove all placements that place two queens either on the same square (leaving only 64!/56! = 178,462,987,637,760 possible placements) or in mutually attacking positions. This very poor algorithm will, among other things, produce the same results over and over again in all the different permutations of the assignments of the eight queens, as well as repeating the same computations over and over again for the different sub-sets of each solution. A better brute-force algorithm places a single queen on each row, leading to only 88 = 224 = 16,777,216 blind placements.

It is possible to do much better than this.
One algorithm solves the eight rooks puzzle by generating the permutations of the numbers 1 through 8 (of which there are 8! = 40,320), and uses the elements of each permutation as indices to place a queen on each row.
Then it rejects those boards with diagonal attacking positions.
The backtracking depth-first search program, a slight improvement on the permutation method, constructs the search tree by considering one row of the board at a time, eliminating most nonsolution board positions at a very early stage in their construction.
Because it rejects rook and diagonal attacks even on incomplete boards, it examines only 15,720 possible queen placements.
A further improvement, which examines only 5,508 possible queen
placements, is to combine the permutation based method with the early
pruning method: the permutations are generated depth-first, and
the search space is pruned if the partial permutation produces a
diagonal attack.
Constraint programming can also be very effective on this problem.
An alternative to exhaustive search is an &#x27;iterative repair&#x27; algorithm, which typically starts with all queens on the board, for example with one queen per column. It then counts the number of conflicts (attacks), and uses a heuristic to determine how to improve the placement of the queens. The &#x27;minimum-conflicts&#x27; heuristic – moving the piece with the largest number of conflicts to the square in the same column where the number of conflicts is smallest – is particularly effective: it easily finds a solution to even the 1,000,000 queens problem.

Unlike the backtracking search outlined above, iterative repair does not guarantee a solution: like all greedy procedures, it may get stuck on a local optimum. (In such a case, the algorithm may be restarted with a different initial configuration.) On the other hand, it can solve problem sizes that are several orders of magnitude beyond the scope of a depth-first search.

As an alternative to backtracking, solutions can be counted by recursively enumerating valid partial solutions, one row at a time. Rather than constructing entire board positions, blocked diagonals and columns are tracked with bitwise operations. This does not allow the recovery of individual solutions.

==Sample program==
The following program is a translation of Niklaus Wirth&#x27;s solution into the Python programming language, but does without the index arithmetic found in the original and instead uses lists to keep the program code as simple as possible. By using a coroutine in the form of a generator function, both versions of the original can be unified to compute either one or all of the solutions. Only 15,720 possible queen placements are examined.

def queens(n: int, i: int, a: list, b: list, c: list):
 if i &lt; n:
 for j in range(n):
 if j not in a and i + j not in b and i - j not in c:
 yield from queens(n, i + 1, a + [j], b + [i + j], c + [i - j])
 else:
 yield a

for solution in queens(8, 0, [], [], []):
 print(solution)
The following program is an implementation of Donald Knuth&#x27;s informal description of the solution on Page 31, Section 7.2.2 &quot;Backtrack Programming&quot; from The Art of Computer Programming, Volume 4B into the Python programming language.

def property(perm: list):
 for k in range(0, len(perm)):
 for j in range(0, len(perm)):
 if j &lt; k:
 if perm[k] == perm[j]:
 return False
 elif abs(perm[k] - perm[j]) == k - j:
 return False
 return True

def extend(perm: list, n: int):
 new_perm = []
 for p in perm:
 for i in range(0, n):
 new_perm.append(p + [i])
 return new_perm

def n_queens(n: int):
 domain = list(range(0, n))
 perm = 
 for i in range(n):
 new_perm = list(filter(property, extend(perm, n)))
 perm = new_perm
 return len(perm)

<text>Enrico Bombieri (born 26 November 1940) is an Italian mathematician, known for his work in analytic number theory, Diophantine geometry, complex analysis, and group theory. Bombieri is currently professor emeritus in the School of Mathematics at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey. Bombieri won the Fields Medal in 1974 for his work on the large sieve and its application to the distribution of prime numbers.

==Career==
Bombieri published his first mathematical paper in 1957, when he was 16 years old. In 1963, at age 22, he earned his first degree (Laurea) in mathematics from the Università degli Studi di Milano under the supervision of Giovanni Ricci and then studied at Trinity College, Cambridge, with Harold Davenport.

Bombieri was an assistant professor (1963–1965) and then a full professor (1965–1966) at the Università di Cagliari, at the Università di Pisa in 1966–1974, and then at the Scuola Normale Superiore di Pisa in 1974–1977. From Pisa, he emigrated in 1977 to the United States, where he became a professor at the School of Mathematics at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey. In 2011, he became professor emeritus.

Bombieri is also known for his &quot;pro bono&quot; service on behalf of the mathematics profession, e.g. for serving on external review boards and for peer-reviewing extraordinarily complicated manuscripts (like the paper of Per Enflo on the invariant subspace problem).

==Research==
The Bombieri–Vinogradov theorem is one of the major applications of the large sieve method. It improves Dirichlet&#x27;s theorem on prime numbers in arithmetic progressions, by showing that by averaging over the modulus over a range, the mean error is much less than can be proved in a given case. This result can sometimes substitute for the still-unproved generalized Riemann hypothesis.

In 1969, Bombieri, De Giorgi, and Giusti solved Bernstein&#x27;s problem on minimal surfaces in dimensions above eight.

In 1976, Bombieri developed the technique known as the &quot;asymptotic sieve&quot;. In 1980, he supplied the completion of the proof of the uniqueness of finite groups of Ree type in characteristic 3; at the time of its publication, it was one of the missing steps in the classification of finite simple groups.

==Awards==
Bombieri&#x27;s research in number theory, algebraic geometry, and mathematical analysis has earned him many international prizes — a Fields Medal in 1974 and the Balzan Prize in 1980. He was a plenary speaker at the International Congress of Mathematicians, which took place in 1974 in Vancouver. He is a member, or foreign member, of several learned academies, including the Accademia Nazionale dei Lincei (elected 1976), the French Academy of Sciences (elected 1984), the Academia Europaea (elected 1995), and the United States National Academy of Sciences (elected 1996). In 2002 he was made &quot;Cavaliere di Gran Croce al Merito della Repubblica Italiana&quot;. In 2010, he received the King Faisal International Prize (jointly with Terence Tao). and in 2020 he was awarded the Crafoord Prize in Mathematics.

==Other interests==
Bombieri, accomplished also in the arts, explored for wild orchids and other plants as a hobby in the Alps when a young man.

<doc id="10477" wikidata="Q178417" url="?curid=10477" title="Eos">
<text>In ancient Greek mythology and religion, Eos (; Ionic and Homeric Greek &quot;Ēṓs&quot;, Attic &quot;Héōs&quot;, &quot;dawn&quot;, or ; Aeolic &quot;Aúōs&quot;, Doric &quot;Āṓs&quot;) is the goddess and personification of the dawn, who rose each morning from her home at the edge of the river Oceanus to deliver light and disperse the night. In Greek tradition and poetry, she is characterized as a goddess with a great sexual appetite, who took numerous human lovers for her own satisfaction and bore them several children. Like her Roman counterpart Aurora and Rigvedic Ushas, Eos continues the name of an earlier Indo-European dawn goddess, Hausos. Eos, or her earlier Proto-Indo-European (PIE) ancestor, also shares several elements with the love goddess Aphrodite, perhaps signifying Eos&#x27;s influence on her or otherwise a common origin for the two goddesses. In surviving tradition, Aphrodite is the culprit behind Eos&#x27; numerous love affairs, having cursed the goddess with insatiable lust for mortal men.

In Greek literature, Eos is presented as a daughter of the Titans Hyperion and Theia, the sister of the sun god Helios and the moon goddess Selene. In rarer traditions, she is the daughter of the Titan Pallas. Each day she drives her two-horse chariot, heralding the breaking of the new day and her brother&#x27;s arrival. Thus, her most common epithet of the goddess in the Homeric epics is Rhododactylos, or &quot;rosy-fingered&quot;, a reference to the sky&#x27;s colours at dawn, and Erigeneia, &quot;early-born&quot;. Although primarily associated with the dawn and early morning, sometimes Eos would accompany Helios for the entire duration of his journey, and thus she is even seen during dusk.

Eos fell in love with mortal men several times, and would abduct them in similar manner to how male gods did mortal women. Her most notable mortal lover is the Trojan prince Tithonus, for whom she ensured the gift of immortality, but not eternal youth, leading to him aging without dying for an eternity. In another story, she carried off the Athenian Cephalus against his will, but eventually let him go for he ardently wished to be returned to his wife, though not before she denigrated her to him, leading to the couple parting ways. Several other lovers and romances with both mortal men and gods were attributed to the goddess by various poets throughout the centuries.

Eos figures in many works of ancient literature and poetry, but despite her Proto-Indo-European origins, there is little evidence of Eos having received any cult or being the centre of worship during classical times.

== Etymology ==
The Proto-Greek form of &quot;Ἠώς&quot; / &quot;Ēṓs&quot; has been reconstructed as &quot;*ἀυhώς / auhṓs&quot;. It is cognate to the Vedic goddess &quot;Ushas&quot;, Lithuanian goddess &quot;Aušrinė&quot;, and Roman goddess &quot;Aurora&quot; (Old Latin &quot;Ausosa&quot;), all three of whom are also goddesses of the dawn. Meissner (2006) suggested an &quot;áwwɔ̄s&quot; &gt; /aṷwɔ̄s/ &gt; lengthening for Aeolic and */aṷwɔ̄s/ &gt; &quot;*āwɔ̄s&quot; &gt; &quot;*ǣwɔ̄s&quot; &gt; /ǣɔ̄s/ for Attic-Ionic Greek.

=== In Greek dialects ===
In Mycenaean Greek her name is also attested in the form in Linear B, &quot;a-wo-i-jo&quot; (&quot;Āw(ʰ)oʰios&quot;; Ἀϝohιος), found in a tablet from Pylos; it has been interpreted as a shepherd&#x27;s personal name related to &quot;dawn&quot;, or dative form &quot;Āwōiōi&quot;.

=== Former proposals ===
Heinrich Wilhelm Stoll offered a different (now rejected) etymology for &quot;&quot;, linking it to the verb , meaning &quot;to blow&quot;, &quot;to breathe.&quot;

Lycophron calls her by an archaic name, &quot;Tito&quot;, meaning &quot;day&quot; and perhaps etymologically linked to &quot;Titan&quot;. Karl Kerenyi observes that Tito shares a linguistic origin with Eos&#x27;s lover Tithonus, which belonged to an older, pre-Greek language.

== Origins ==
=== Proto-Indo-European dawn goddess ===

All four of the aforementioned goddesses sharing a linguistic connection with Eos are considered derivatives of the Proto-Indo-European stem &quot;*h₂ewsṓs&quot; (later &quot;*Ausṓs&quot;), &quot;dawn&quot;. The root also gave rise to Proto-Germanic &quot;*Austrō&quot;, Old High German &quot;*Ōstara&quot; and Old English &quot;Ēostre / Ēastre&quot;. These and other cognates led to the reconstruction of a Proto-Indo-European dawn goddess, &quot;*h₂éwsōs&quot;.

In the Greek pantheon, Eos, Helios and Zeus are the three gods that are of impeccable Indo-European lineage in both etymology and status, although the former two were sidelined in the pantheon by non-PIE newcomers. A common epithet associated with this dawn goddess is *&quot;Diwós Dhuǵh2tḗr&quot;, the &#x27;Daughter of Dyēus&#x27;, the sky god. In Homeric tradition however, Eos is never stated to be the daughter of Zeus (, ), as she is instead the daughter of the Titan Hyperion, who plays little role in mythology or religion. Rather, a commonly occurring epithet of hers is , &quot;dîa&quot;, meaning &quot;divine&quot;, from earlier &quot;*díw-ya&quot;, which would have translated into &quot;belonging to Zeus&quot; or &quot;heavenly&quot;.

Eos&#x27;s characterization as a lovestruck, sexual being who took many lovers is directly inherited from her PIE precursor. A common and widespread theme among Hausos&#x27;s descendants is their reluctance to bring the light of the new day. Eos (and Aurora) is sometimes seen as unwilling to leave her bed in the morning, while Uṣas is punished by Indra for attempting to forestall the day, and the Latvian Auseklis was said to be locked up in a golden chamber so she could not always rise in the morning.

This Indo-European goddess of the dawn was often conflated and equated with Hemera, the goddess of the day and daylight. Eos might have also played a role in Proto-Indo-European poetry.

=== Connection to Aphrodite ===
Eos also shares some characteristics with the love goddess Aphrodite connoting perhaps a semi-shared origin or influence of Eos/&quot;*Haéusōs&quot; on Aphrodite, who otherwise has a Near Eastern origin; both goddesses were known for their erotic beauty and aggressive sexuality, both had relationships with mortal lovers, and both were associated with the colors red, white, and gold. Michael Janda etymologizes Aphrodite&#x27;s name as an epithet of Eos meaning &quot;she who rises from the foam [of the ocean]&quot; and points to Hesiod&#x27;s &quot;Theogony&quot; account of Aphrodite&#x27;s birth as an archaic reflex of Indo-European myth. On the other hand, however, it is generally accepted that Aphrodite&#x27;s name etymology is Semitic in origin, and its exact meaning and derivation cannot be determined. Evidence is also provided by an Italic red-figure krater in which Aphrodite is shown holding a mirror beneath a solar disc while the Theban hero Cadmus slays the dragon, with a female figure nearly identical to Aphrodite being depicted on another krater labelled &quot;&quot;, or &quot;Aṓs&quot;, the dawn; this shows that although Aphrodite is assimilated to Astarte/Inanna, in Greek artistic tradition she is sometimes presented in a similar matter to Eos.

Aphrodite, like Eos, is predator and not prey, as no tales of men assaulting Aphrodite exist, but there are many where she abducts mortal men reversing the traditional theme of gods and men pursuing maidens, in the same fashion as Eos. Not only does Aphrodite abduct or seduce mortal men as Eos does, but even cites Eos&#x27; own adventures with Tithonus when she seduces Anchises. The two goddesses are presented as both maleficent and beneficent abductors, as they confer both death (maleficent) and preservation (beneficent) to their mortal lovers. The two goddesses exist almost side by side in the myth of Phaethon of Syria, with Eos as his mother and Aphrodite as his lover and abductor. Moreover, another telling point is how the name “Aoos” is recorded as both a name for Adonis, Aphrodite&#x27;s East-originating lover, and a son of Eos by Cephalus (like Phaethon) who became king of Cyprus, an island that was regarded as Aphrodite&#x27;s birthplace. This suggest a mixture of Mycenaean and Phoenician religions on the island; it is possible that Aoos was originally a generic name used for Eos’ son or lover, which was then attached to Aphrodite in the form of a consort of the same name as she developed from Eos.

== Description ==
Eos is usually described with rosy fingers or rosy forearms as she opened the gates of heaven for the Sun to rise: the singer in the &quot;Homeric Hymn to Helios&quot; calls her (), &quot;rosy-armed&quot;, as does Sappho, who also describes her as having golden arms and golden sandals; vases depict her rosy-fingered, with golden arms.

She is pictured on Attic vases as a beautiful woman, crowned with a tiara or diadem and with the large white-feathered wings of a bird. In Homer, her saffron-colored robe is embroidered or woven with flowers. Mesomedes of Crete used for her, &quot;she who has snow-white eyelids&quot;, while Ovid described her as &quot;golden&quot;. The delicate and fragile beauty of her appearance seems to be in total contrast with the carnal nature that was often attributed to her in myth and literature.

== Family ==
=== Parents ===
According to Greek cosmogony, Eos is the daughter of the Titans Hyperion and Theia: Hyperion, a bringer of light, the &quot;One Above, Who Travels High Above the Earth&quot; and Theia, &quot;The Divine,&quot; also called Euryphaessa, &quot;wide-shining&quot; and Aethra, &quot;bright sky&quot;. Eos is the sister of Helios, the god of the sun, and Selene, the goddess of the moon, &quot;who shine upon all that are on earth and upon the deathless gods who live in the wide heaven&quot;. Out of the four authors that give her and her siblings a birth order, two make her the oldest child, the other two the youngest. In some accounts, Eos&#x27;s father was called Pallas, who is also confirmed to be the father of Eos&#x27;s sister Selene in some rare traditions. Even though the two goddesses are still connected as sisters in the traditions going with lineage from Pallas, their brother Helios is never included with them in those versions, being consistently the son of Hyperion. Mesomedes made her the daughter of Helios, who is usually her brother, by an unnamed mother. Some authors made her the child of Nyx, the personification of the night, who is the mother of Hemera in the &quot;Theogony&quot;.

=== Offspring ===
Eos married the Titan Astraeus (&quot;of the stars&quot;) and became the mother of the Anemoi (&quot;winds&quot;) namely Zephyrus, Boreas, Notus and Eurus; of the Morning Star, Eosphoros (Venus); of the stars; and of the virgin goddess of justice, Astraea (&quot;starry one&quot;). Her other notable offspring were Memnon and Emathion by the Trojan prince, Tithonus. Sometimes, Hesperus, Phaethon and Tithonus (different from her lover), were said to be the children of Eos by Prince Cephalus of Athens.

== Mythology ==
=== Goddess of the dawn ===
Each morning, the dawn goddess Eos gets up and opens the gates for her brother, Helios, to pass through and rise, ushering in the new day. Although often her job seems to be done once she announces Helios&#x27; coming, in the Homeric epics she accompanies him throughout the whole day, and does not leave him until the sunset; hence &quot;Eos&quot; might be used in texts where one would have expected to see &quot;Helios&quot; instead. In Musaeus&#x27;s rendition of the story of Hero and Leander in the sixth century AD, Eos is mentioned during both sunrise and sunset.

==== Homer and Hesiod ====
From the &quot;Iliad&quot;:

Now when Dawn in robe of saffron was hastening from the streams of Oceanus, to bring light to mortals and immortals, Thetis reached the ships with the armor that the god had given her.

But soon as early Dawn appeared, the rosy-fingered, then gathered the folk about the pyre of glorious Hector.

She is most often associated with her Homeric epithet &quot;rosy-fingered&quot; Eos Rhododactylos (), but Homer also calls her Eos Erigeneia:

That brightest of stars appeared, Eosphoros, that most often heralds the light of early-rising Dawn (Eos Erigeneia).

Near the end of the &quot;Odyssey&quot;, Athena, wanting to buy Odysseus some time with his wife Penelope after they have reunited with each other, orders Eos not to yoke her two horses, thus delaying the coming of the new day:

And rose-fingered Dawn would have shone for the weepers had not bright-eyed goddess Athena thought of other things. She checked the long night in its passage, and further, held golden-throned Dawn over Ocean and didn&#x27;t let her yoke her swift-footed horses, that bring daylight to men, Lampus and Phaethon, the colts that carry Dawn.

In the &quot;Theogony&quot;, Hesiod wrote &quot;[a]nd after these Erigeneia [&quot;Early-born&quot;] bore the star Eosphoros (&quot;Dawn-bringer&quot;), and the gleaming stars with which heaven is crowned&quot;. Thus Eos is preceded by the Morning Star, and is thus seen as the genetrix of all the stars and planets; her tears are considered to have created the morning dew, personified as Ersa or Herse, who is otherwise the daughter of her sister Selene by Zeus.

==== Orphic literature ====
Eos is addressed by the singer in one of the &quot;Orphic Hymns&quot;, as the bringer of the new day:

The position of the hymn in the collection at number 78 is odd, far from the Hymns to the Night (3), the Sun (8) and the Moon (9), where it would be expected to be grouped. While many of the &quot;Orphic Hymns&quot; describe the divinities in terms on light, the hymn to Eos is the only one that calls upon the divinity to provide light to the initiates.

==== Divine horses ====
Eos&#x27;s team of horses pull her chariot across the sky and are named in the &quot;Odyssey&quot; as &quot;Firebright&quot; and &quot;Daybright&quot;. Quintus described her exulting in her heart over the radiant horses (Lampus and Phaëton) that drew her chariot, amidst the bright-haired Horae, the feminine Hours, the daughters of Zeus and Themis who are responsible for the changing of the seasons, climbing the arc of heaven and scattering sparks of fire.

=== Lovers ===
In spite of the goddess already having a husband in the face of her first cousin Astraeus, Eos is presented as a goddess who fell in love several times. According to Pseudo-Apollodorus, it was the jealous Aphrodite who cursed her to be perpetually in love and have an insatiable sexual desire because Eos had once lain with Aphrodite&#x27;s sweetheart Ares, the god of war. The curse caused her to abduct a number of handsome young men. This explanatory myth was the reason offered for Eos&#x27; ravenous sexual desires, as this pattern of behavior of hers was noticed by the ancient Greeks.

In the Odyssey, Calypso complains to Hermes about the male gods taking many mortal women as lovers, but not allowing goddesses to do the same. She brings up as example Eos&#x27;s love for the hunter Orion, who was killed by Artemis on the island of Ortygia. Apollodorus also mentions Eos&#x27;s love for Orion, and adds that she brought him to Delos, where he met Artemis and was subsequently slain by her. The good-looking Cleitus was snatched and made immortal by her.

Eos fell in love and abducted Cephalus, a son of Hermes, who is sometimes the same as or distinct from the Cephalus that was the husband of Procris, whom she also abducted.

==== Tithonus ====
The myth about the love of Eos and Tithonus is very old, known as early as Homer, who in the &quot;Odyssey&quot; described the coming of the new morning as Eos rising from the bed she shares with Tithonus to bring her light to the world. The earliest (and fullest) account survives in the &quot;Homeric Hymn to Aphrodite&quot;, where Aphrodite herself narrates the story to her own lover Anchises. Additionally, the myth is also the subject of one of the very few substantially complete works of Sappho, pieced together from different fragments discovered over a period of more than a hundred years, known as the Tithonus poem or the Old Age poem:

The myth goes that Eos fell in love with and abducted Tithonus, a handsome prince from Troy, either the brother or the son of King Laomedon (the father of Priam). She went with a request to Zeus, asking him to make Tithonus immortal for her sake. Zeus agreed and granted her wish, but Eos foolishly forgot to ask for eternal youth as well for her beloved. So for a while the two lived happily in her palace, but their happiness eventually came to an end when Tithonus’ hair started turning grey as he aged, and Eos ceased to visit him in their bed. Despite that, the goddess kept him around and nourished him with food and ambrosia; Tithonus never died as he had gained immortality as Zeus promised, but he kept aging and shrivelling, and was soon unable to even move. In the end, Eos locked him up in a chamber, where he withered away alone, forever a helpless old man. Out of pity, she turned him into a small bug, a cicada (Greek , &quot;tettix&quot;).

In the account of Hieronymus of Rhodes from the third century BC, the blame is shifted from Eos and onto Tithonus, who asked for immortality but not agelessness from his lover, who was then unable to help him otherwise and turned him into a cicada. Propertius wrote that Eos did not forsake Tithonus, old and aged as he was, and would still embrace him and hold him in her arms rather than leaving him deserted in his cold chamber, while cursing the gods for his cruel fate.

This myth might have been used to explain why cicadas were particularly noisy during the early hours of the morning, when the dawn appears in the sky. Sir James George Frazer notes that there was a widespread notion among the ancient Greeks and other ancient peoples that the creatures that shed their skin renew their youth and get to live forever. It could also be a reference to the fact that the high-pitched talk of old men was compared to a cicada&#x27;s singing, as evidenced in a passage from the &quot;Iliad&quot;. The ancient Greeks would use a cicada, the most musical of insects, sitting on a harp as an emblem of music. Cicadas were also believed to be able to survive off of dew alone, a substance closely associated with Eos.

==== Cephalus ====
The abduction of Cephalus had special appeal for an Athenian audience because Cephalus was a local boy, and so this myth element appeared frequently in Attic vase-paintings and was exported with them. In the literary myths, Eos snatched Cephalus against his will when he was hunting and took him to Syria. Although Cephalus was already married to Procris, Eos bore him three sons, including Phaethon and Hesperus, and in some versions the little-attested Aoos who went on to become king of Cyprus, but he then began pining for Procris, causing a disgruntled Eos to return him to Procris, but not before sowing the seeds of doubt in his mind, telling him that it was highly unlikely that Procris had stayed faithful to him this entire time.

Cephalus, troubled by her words, asked Eos to change his form into that of a stranger&#x27;s, in order to secretly put Procris&#x27;s love for him to the test. Cephalus, now disguised, propositioned Procris, who at first declined but eventually gave in when he offered her money. He was hurt by her betrayal, and she left him in shame, but eventually they got back together. This time however it was Procris&#x27;s turn to doubt her husband&#x27;s fidelity; while hunting, he would often call upon the breeze (&#x27;Aura&#x27; in Latin, sounding similar to Eos&#x27;s Roman equivalent Aurora) to refresh his body. Upon hearing that, Procris followed and spied on him. Cephalus, mistaking her for some wild animal, threw his spear at her, killing his wife. The second-century CE traveller Pausanias knew of the story of Cephalus&#x27;s abduction too, though he calls Eos by the name of Hemera, goddess of day.

Hyginus omits the kidnapping from the story, and has Cephalus reject Eos out of fidelity to Procris when she begs him to have sex with her. Eos then says to Cephalus that she would not want him to break his vows if Procris herself has not either, and alters his appearance and gives him gifts to trick Procris. Cephalus then goes to Procris as a stranger, and she agrees to lay with him, thereupon Eos removes the enchantment from Cephalus, revealing his identity. Procris, knowing she has been deceived by Eos, flees; she is eventually reunited with Cephalus, but still fearful of Eos, follows him when he goes out hunting, and ends up being accidentally killed by him.

Antoninus Liberalis also largely follows the same tradition in his rendition of the myth, though his text contains a lacuna, jumping from Eos&#x27; abduction of Cephalus to him having doubts over Procris. The oldest extant account of the myth is attributed to Pherecydes, and the elements it contains were all kept by later poets; in his account however Eos plays no role in the myth. That being said, artistic evidence of Eos abducting a man that can be identified as Cephalus go as back as the early fifth century BC.

=== Role in wars ===
==== Gigantomachy ====
Eos played a small role in the battle of the earthborn Giants against the gods, known as the Gigantomachy, who rose in rebellion. When their mother, the earth goddess Gaia learned of a prophecy that the giants would perish at the hand of a mortal, Gaia sought to find a herb that would protect them from all harm; thus Zeus ordered Eos, as well as her siblings Selene (Moon) and Helios (Sun) not to shine so that she would not be able to seek for it, and harvested all of the plant for himself, denying Gaia the chance to make the Giants indestructible. Moreover, Eos is seen fighting against the Giants in the south frieze of the Pergamon Altar, which depicts the Gigantomachy, where she rides hither on either a horse or a mule right ahead of Helios, swinging herself on the back of her mount while a Giant already lies on the ground underneath her; a robe wound around her hips serves as her saddle-cloth. She is joined in fight against the Giants by her siblings, her mother Theia, and possibly, conjectured due to the disembodied wing to the right of Eos&#x27;s shoulder, the goddess Hemera.

==== Trojan War ====
According to Hesiod, by her lover Tithonus, Eos had two sons, Memnon and Emathion. Memnon, king of Aethiopia, joined the Trojans in the Trojan War and fought against Achilles in battle. Much like Thetis, the mother of Achilles, did before her, Eos asked the smithing god Hephaestus with tears in her eyes to forge an armor for Memnon, and he, moved, did as told. Pausanias mentions images of Thetis and Eos both begging Zeus on behalf of their sons. In the end, it was Achilles who triumphed and slew Memnon in battle. Mourning greatly over the death of her son, Eos made the light of her brother, Helios the god of the sun, to fade, and begged Nyx, the goddess of the night, to come out earlier, so she could be able to freely steal her son&#x27;s body undetected by the armies. After his death, Eos, perhaps with the help of Hypnos (Sleep) and Thanatos (Death), transported Memnon&#x27;s dead body back to Aethiopia; she also asked Zeus to make her son immortal, and he granted her wish. Eos&#x27; role in the Trojan War saga mirrors that of Thetis herself; both are goddesses married to aging old men, both see their mortal sons die on the battlefield, and both arrange an afterlife/immortality of sorts for said sons.

== Iconography ==
Eos was imagined as a woman wearing a saffron mantle as she spread dew from an upturned urn, or with a torch in hand, riding a chariot. Greek and Italian vases show Eos/Aurora on a chariot preceding Helios, as the morning star Eosphorus flies with her; she is winged, wearing a fine pleated tunic and mantle. Eos is not an uncommon figure, especially on red-figure vases; as a single figure she appears rising from the sea in, or driving, a four-horse chariot like her brother Helios, sometimes carrying two hydriae from which she pours morning dew. Because Hermes&#x27; rod had the power to both induce sleep to mortals and wake them up, some times he is seen preceding the chariot of Eos (and that of Helios) as the new day breaks.

Although the romantic adventures of Eos is a common subject in pottery, so far as it is known, no vase depicts her with Orion or Cleitus, known lovers of hers, instead those vases fall into groups; those that depict Eos with a young hunter identified as Cephalus, and those that depict Eos with a youth holding a lyre, identified as Tithonus. Sometimes those vases bear inscriptions, and on a few the hunter is identified as Tithonus, while the lyre-player is Cephalus. Perhaps the earliest representation of this theme is found on a red-figure &quot;rhyton&quot;, a statuette-vase, from circa 480-470 BC in which Eos is depicted carrying of a naked boy, perhaps Cephalus, her wings spread and her feet barely touching the ground. The image of Eos pursuing Tithonus was eerily repetitive in ancient art, as was that of erotic pursuit in general; Tithonus was drawn running off to the right in terror, or trying to clobber with a lyre or a spear the pursuing Eos, indicating the terrifying aspect of a mortal man being taken by a goddess. The image of Zeus, the active &quot;erastes&quot;, pursuing Ganymede, the passive &quot;eromenos&quot;, was also common, but in the case of Eos, the female figure was put in the dominant position.

Other depictions of mythological scenes that include Eos are Memnon&#x27;s battle with Achilles and Eos&#x27; pleading of Zeus for his safety, her seizing of Memnon&#x27;s dead body, and the &quot;apotheosis&quot; of Alcmene (the mother of Heracles). Among Theia and Hyperion&#x27;s children, she is the only one depicted with wings, as neither her brother nor her sister ever sport some in art.

== Cult and temples ==
Eos, along with her brother and sister, is an Indo-European deity, side-lined by the non-IE newcomers to the pantheon; James Davidson argues that apparently persisting on the sidelines was a primary function for them, to be the minor gods that the major gods were juxtaposed to, thus helping to keep the Greek religion Greek. However, whereas her brother and sister did receive minor cults, and in Helios&#x27; case even major ones, Eos does not seem to have been the focus of any worship at all. Thus there are no known temples, shrines, or altars to Eos. That being said, Ovid seems to allude to the existence of at least two shrines of Eos, as he describes them in plural, albeit few, in the lines:

Although this could simply be an understated way for Eos to say that she has no temples or shrines whatsoever, nevertheless Ovid may therefore have known of at least two such shrines. However, if Eos did indeed have a handful of shrines and altars in ancient Greece or Rome, no knowledge of them remains.

The only traces of the goddess&#x27;s worship can be found at Athens, where wineless offerings (or &quot;nephalia&quot;) were made to Eos, along with other celestial gods and goddesses, including Eos&#x27;s siblings Helios and Selene, as well as Aphrodite Urania, Mnemosyne, the Muses, and the nymphs. It is possible that the goddess addressed as Orthria and Aotis in a fragment by Alcman is Eos; this is highly debated, but if true, it could mean that Eos was worshipped in some capacity in Sparta during the Archaic period.

== Identifications ==
=== Etruscan ===
Among the Etruscans, the generative dawn-goddess was Thesan. Depictions of the dawn-goddess with a young lover became popular in Etruria in the fifth century, probably inspired by imported Greek vase-painting. Though Etruscans preferred to show the goddess as a nurturer (&quot;Kourotrophos&quot;) rather than an abductor of young men, the late Archaic sculptural acroterion from Etruscan Cære, now in Berlin, showing the goddess in archaic running pose adapted from the Greeks, and bearing a boy in her arms, has commonly been identified as Eos and Cephalus. On an Etruscan mirror Thesan is shown carrying off a young man, whose name is inscribed as Tinthu.

=== Roman ===
The Roman equivalent of Eos is Aurora, also a cognate showing the characteristic Latin rhotacism. Dawn became associated in Roman cult with Matuta, later known as Mater Matuta. She was also associated with the sea harbors and ports, and had a temple on the Forum Boarium. On June 11, the Matralia was celebrated at that temple in honor of Mater Matuta; this festival was only for women during their first marriage.

=== Hemera ===
Although distinct deities in early works such as Hesiod&#x27;s &quot;Theogony&quot;, later the tragic poets completely identified Eos with Hemera, the primordial goddess of the day; each of the three great Athenian tragedians, Euripides, Aeschylus and Sophocles, used &quot;Hemera&quot; for the goddess who abducts Tithonus or drives a chariot drawn by white horses at daybreak in some work.

Both goddesses were said to be daughters of Nyx (Night), albeit Eos was much more commonly the daughter of Hyperion by his wife. Pausanias, when describing depictions of Eos&#x27;s myths at Athens and Amyclae, he calls Eos by the name of Hemera. A scholion on the &quot;Odyssey&quot; mentions the abduction of the hunter Orion by &quot;Hemera&quot; (Eos in Homer). Eos, in contrast to Helios and Selene and more similarly to Hemera and Hemera&#x27;s mother Nyx, embodies a part of the day and night cycle, instead of a celestial body. The Greek word &quot;eos&quot;, meaning dawn, was some times used by writers to refer to the entire duration of the day, not just the morning.

Likewise, Eos was often referred to as &quot;Tito&quot;, another archaic word meaning day, and feminine equivalent to &quot;Titan&quot;, which is a common epithet of her brother Helios denoting his role as the creator of the day. Unlike Eos however, Hemera is little more than a name in Greek literature, with few and far between refences about her and with no unique mythology outside of her parentage and the few stories appropriated from Eos.

<doc id="10479" wikidata="Q45328" url="?curid=10479" title="Elba">
<text>Elba (, ; ) is a Mediterranean island in Tuscany, Italy, from the coastal town of Piombino on the Italian mainland, and the largest island of the Tuscan Archipelago. It is also part of the Arcipelago Toscano National Park, and the third largest island in Italy, after Sicily and Sardinia. It is located in the Tyrrhenian Sea about east of the French island of Corsica.

The island is part of the province of Livorno and is divided into seven municipalities, with a total population of about 30,000 inhabitants which increases considerably during the summer. The municipalities are Portoferraio (which is also the island&#x27;s principal town), Campo nell&#x27;Elba, Capoliveri, Marciana, Marciana Marina, Porto Azzurro, and Rio.

It is famous for being the site of Napoleon&#x27;s first exile, from 1814 to 1815.

==Geography==
Elba is the largest remaining stretch of land from the ancient tract that once connected the Italian peninsula to Corsica. The northern coast faces the Ligurian Sea, the eastern coast the Piombino Channel, the southern coast the Tyrrhenian Sea, and the Corsica Channel divides the western tip of the island from neighbouring Corsica.

===Geology===
The island itself is made up of slices of rocks which once formed part of the ancient Tethyan seafloor. These rocks have been through at least two orogenies, the Alpine orogeny and the Apennine orogeny. The second of these two events was associated with subduction of the Tethyan oceanic crust underneath Italy and the obduction of parts of the ancient seafloor onto the continents. Later extension within the stretched inner part of the Apennine Mountains caused adiabatic melting and the intrusion of the Mount Capanne and the La Serra-Porto Azzuro granitoids. These igneous bodies brought with them skarn fluids which dissolved and replaced some of the carbonate units, precipitating iron-rich minerals in their place. One of the iron-rich minerals, ilvaite, was first identified on the island and takes its name from the Latin word for Elba. More recently, high-angle faults formed within the tectonic pile, allowing for the migration of iron-rich fluids through the crust. The deposits left behind by these fluids formed the island&#x27;s rich seams of iron ore.
The terrain is quite varied and is thus divided into several areas based on geomorphology. The mountainous and most recent part of the island can be found to the west, the centre of which is dominated by Mount Capanne (at a height of 1,018 metres, or 3,340 feet), also called the &quot;roof of the Tuscan Archipelago&quot;. The mountain is home to many animal species including the mouflon and wild boar, two species that flourish despite the continuous influx of tourists. The central part of the island is a mostly flat section with the width being reduced to just four kilometres (). It is where the major centres can be found: Portoferraio, Campo nell&#x27;Elba. To the east is the oldest part of the island, formed over 3 million years ago. In the hilly area, dominated by Monte Calamita, are the deposits of iron that made Elba famous.

===Hydrography===
Rivers rarely exceed in length, and it is common for the shorter ones to dry up during the summer. The largest rivers, sorted by length, are:
*Fosso San Francesco ;
*Fosso Barion, ;
*Fosso Redinoce, 

Between Poggio and Marciana, at the foot of Mount Capanne, is a spring called Fonte Napoleone, known for its quality.

===Climate===
The climate of the island is predominantly Mediterranean, except for Mount Capanne, where winters tend to be moderately cold. Precipitation is concentrated in autumn and comprises a normal rainfall. The island lies in the rain shadow of the large and mountainous island of Corsica, so precipitation totals are somewhat reduced from the mainland (most of the island receives less than 750 mm (30 inches) annually). Snowfall in winter is rare in the lowlands and melts quickly. The table below shows the average temperatures for the islands by month.


==History==
===Early history===
The island was originally inhabited by Ligures Ilvates and was called Ilva (Ἰλούα). It was well known from very ancient times for its iron resources and valued mines. The Greeks also called it Aethalia (Αἰθαλία or Αἰθάλεια) and Aethale (Αἰθάλη) from &quot;smoky&quot; (αἰθάλη), after the fumes of the metal producing furnaces.

Apollonius of Rhodes mentions it in his epic poem &quot;Argonautica&quot;, describing that the Argonauts rested here during their travels. He writes that signs of their visit were still visible in his day, including skin-coloured pebbles that they dried their hands on and large stones which they used at discus. Strabo (5.2.6) presents a slightly different account: &quot;because the scrapings, which the Argonauts formed when they used their strigils, became congealed, the pebbles on the shore remain variegated still to this day.&quot; The port which is now called Porto Ferraio, was known in ancient times as the portus Argous (Ἀργῶος λιμήν), because it was believed that the Argonauts landed there on their return voyage.

The island was then settled by the Etruscans, who started mining iron at Elba, and later (after 480 BC) by the Romans, who called the island Ilva.

===Middle Ages and early modern===
In the early medieval period, Elba was invaded by the Ostrogoths and the Lombards, and later it became a possession of the Republic of Pisa. After the battle of Meloria, the Republic of Genoa took possession of Elba, but it was regained by Pisa in 1292. The island was retained for two centuries by the Appiani family, Lords of Piombino, when they sold Pisa to the house of Visconti of Milan in 1399.

In 1544, the Barbary pirates from North Africa devastated Elba and the coasts of Tuscany. In 1546, part of the island was handed over to Cosimo I de&#x27; Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany, who fortified Portoferraio and renamed it &quot;Cosmopoli&quot;, while the rest of the island was returned to the Appiani in 1577. In 1596, Philip II of Spain captured Porto Longone and had two fortresses built there. This part of Elba came into the direct power of Spain through the State of the Presidi, including Porto Longone. In 1736, the sovereignty of this part of Elba was claimed by the Kingdom of Naples but remained abandoned.

===Late modern and contemporary===
The British landed on the island of Elba in 1796, after the occupation of Livorno by the French Republican troops, to protect the 4,000 French royalists who had found asylum in Portoferraio two years earlier. In 1801, the Peace of Luneville gave Elba to the Kingdom of Etruria, and it was transferred to France in 1802 by the Peace of Amiens.

The French Emperor Napoleon was exiled to Elba, after his forced abdication following the Treaty of Fontainebleau, and conveyed to the island on HMS &quot;Undaunted&quot; by Captain Thomas Ussher; he arrived at Portoferraio on 4 May 1814. He was allowed to keep a personal guard of 400 men and was nominally sovereign of Elba, a step down from Emperor of the French. However, the nearby sea was patrolled by the French and British navies to ensure he could not escape. During the months that he stayed on the island, Napoleon carried out a series of economic and social reforms to improve the quality of life. After staying for almost ten months, he managed to escape back to France on 26 February 1815 with about 1,000 men.

At the Congress of Vienna, Elba was given to the Grand Duchy of Tuscany. In 1860, it became part of the new unified Kingdom of Italy.

During the Second World War, the island was liberated from German occupation by the French &quot;1er Corps d&#x27;Armée&quot; supported by British forces including Royal Naval Commandos on 17 June 1944, in &quot;Opération Brassard&quot;. Faulty intelligence and strong defences made the battle more difficult than expected.

In 1954, BOAC Flight 781 crashed in the waters off the coast of Elba.

In recent decades, thanks to its rich cultural heritage, cuisine and nature, the island has become an important international tourist destination.

==Transportation==
The island is connected to the mainland via the four ferry companies, Toremar, Moby Lines, Blunavy and Sardinia Ferries, all offering routes between Piombino and Portoferraio, the capital located in the north, Cavo, Rio Marina and Porto Azzurro, on the east coast of the island.

There is an airport on the island, Marina di Campo Airport. It is served by Silver Air with flights to the Italian mainland.

===Cycling===
The island has a network of trails for road racers looking for more technical routes for their training, trails and dirt roads for bikers to have fun on, and accessible routes for families with children who need safe and relaxing routes. On the road from Rio nell&#x27;Elba going to Porto Azzurro is the &quot;Fonte di Coppi&quot;. Towards the end of his career, Fausto Coppi, the &quot;campionissimo&quot;, came here to train on the roads of Elba. He still retained a celebrity status but was no longer at the peak of his career that ended with his death a few years later. The plaque on the fountain reads: &quot;1960–2010, here the champion quenched his thirst, after fifty years on the run&quot;.

==Sport==
The Elba football team represents the island. They were approved as a ConIFA member at the Annual General Meeting 2020. It is not affiliated with FIFA or UEFA, and therefore cannot compete for the FIFA World Cup or in the UEFA European Championship. It is, however, affiliated to ConIFA, and play in the ConIFA European Football Cup.

Elba Island played their first game as a ConIFA member on 11 September 2021 against the Sicily Football Team scoring a 4–4 tie against them.

<doc id="10481" wikidata="Q189726" url="?curid=10481" title="Enki">
<text>Enki ( ) is the Sumerian god of water, knowledge (&quot;gestú&quot;), crafts (&quot;gašam&quot;), and creation (&quot;nudimmud&quot;), and one of the Anunnaki. He was later known as Ea () or Ae in Akkadian (Assyrian-Babylonian) religion, and is identified by some scholars with Ia in Canaanite religion. The name was rendered Aos within Greek sources (e.g. Damascius).

He was originally the patron god of the city of Eridu, but later the influence of his cult spread throughout Mesopotamia and to the Canaanites, Hittites and Hurrians. He was associated with the southern band of constellations called &quot;stars of Ea&quot;, but also with the constellation AŠ-IKU, &quot;the Field&quot; (Square of Pegasus). Beginning around the second millennium BCE, he was sometimes referred to in writing by the numeric ideogram for &quot;40&quot;, occasionally referred to as his &quot;sacred number&quot;. The planet Mercury, associated with Babylonian &quot;Nabu&quot; (the son of Marduk) was, in Sumerian times, identified with Enki, as was the star Canopus.

Many myths about Enki have been collected from various sites, stretching from Southern Iraq to the Levantine coast. He is mentioned in the earliest extant cuneiform inscriptions throughout the region and was prominent from the third millennium down to the Hellenistic period.

== Etymology ==
The exact meaning of Enki&#x27;s name is uncertain: the common translation is &quot;Lord of the Earth&quot;. The Sumerian &quot;En&quot; is translated as a title equivalent to &quot;lord&quot; and was originally a title given to the High Priest. &quot;Ki&quot; means &quot;earth&quot;, but there are theories that &quot;ki&quot; in this name has another origin, possibly &quot;kig&quot; of unknown meaning, or &quot;kur&quot; meaning &quot;mound&quot;.
The name Ea is allegedly Hurrian in origin while others claim that his name &#x27;Ea&#x27; is possibly of Semitic origin and may be a derivation from the West-Semitic root *hyy meaning &quot;life&quot; in this case used for &quot;spring&quot;, &quot;running water&quot;. In Sumerian E-A means &quot;the house of water&quot;, and it has been suggested that this was originally the name for the shrine to the god at Eridu. 

It has also been suggested that the original non-anthropomorphic divinity at Eridu was not Enki but Abzu. The emergence of Enki as the divine lover of Ninhursag, and the divine battle between the younger Igigi divinities and Abzu, saw the Abzu, the underground waters of the Aquifer, becoming the place in which the foundations of the temple were built. With some Sumerian deity names as Enlil, there are variations like Elil. En means &quot;Lord&quot; and E means &quot;temple&quot;. It is likely that E-A is the Sumerian short form for &quot;Lord of Water&quot;, as Enki is a god of water. Ab in Abzu also means &quot;water&quot;.

==Worship==
The main temple to Enki was called &quot;E-abzu&quot;, meaning &quot;abzu temple&quot; (also &quot;E-en-gur-a&quot;, meaning &quot;house of the subterranean waters&quot;), a ziggurat temple surrounded by Euphratean marshlands near the ancient Persian Gulf coastline at Eridu. It was the first temple known to have been built in Southern Iraq. Four separate excavations at the site of Eridu have demonstrated the existence of a shrine dating back to the earliest Ubaid period, more than 6,500 years ago. Over the following 4,500 years, the temple was expanded 18 times, until it was abandoned during the Persian period. On this basis Thorkild Jacobsen has hypothesized that the original deity of the temple was Abzu, with his attributes later being taken by Enki over time. P. Steinkeller believes that, during the earliest period, Enki had a subordinate position to a goddess (possibly Ninhursag), taking the role of divine consort or high priest, later taking priority. The Enki temple had at its entrance a pool of fresh water, and excavation has found numerous carp bones, suggesting collective feasts. Carp are shown in the twin water flows running into the later God Enki, suggesting continuity of these features over a very long period. These features were found at all subsequent Sumerian temples, suggesting that this temple established the pattern for all subsequent Sumerian temples. &quot;All rules laid down at Eridu were faithfully observed&quot;.

==Iconography==
Enki was the keeper of the divine powers called &quot;Me&quot;, the gifts of civilization. He is often shown with the horned crown of divinity.

On the Adda Seal, Enki is depicted with two streams of water flowing into each of his shoulders: one the Tigris, the other the Euphrates. Alongside him are two trees, symbolizing the male and female aspects of nature. He is shown wearing a flounced skirt and a cone-shaped hat. An eagle descends from above to land upon his outstretched right arm. This portrayal reflects Enki&#x27;s role as the god of water, life, and replenishment.

Considered the master shaper of the world, god of wisdom and of all magic, Enki was characterized as the lord of the Abzu (Apsu in Akkadian), the freshwater sea or groundwater located within the earth. In the later Babylonian epic &quot;Enûma Eliš&quot;, Abzu, the &quot;begetter of the gods&quot;, is inert and sleepy but finds his peace disturbed by the younger gods, so sets out to destroy them. His grandson Enki, chosen to represent the younger gods, puts a spell on Abzu &quot;casting him into a deep sleep&quot;, thereby confining him deep underground. Enki subsequently sets up his home &quot;&quot;in the depths of the Abzu&quot;.&quot; Enki thus takes on all of the functions of the Abzu, including his fertilising powers as lord of the waters and lord of semen.

Early royal inscriptions from the third millennium BCE mention &quot;the reeds of Enki&quot;. Reeds were an important local building material, used for baskets and containers, and collected outside the city walls, where the dead or sick were often carried. This links Enki to the &quot;Kur&quot; or underworld of Sumerian mythology. In another even older tradition, Nammu, the goddess of the primeval creative matter and the mother-goddess portrayed as having &quot;given birth to the great gods,&quot; was the mother of Enki, and as the watery creative force, was said to preexist Ea-Enki. Benito states &quot;With Enki it is an interesting change of gender symbolism, the fertilising agent is also water, Sumerian &quot;a&quot; or &quot;Ab&quot; which also means &quot;semen&quot;. In one evocative passage in a Sumerian hymn, Enki stands at the empty riverbeds and fills them with his &#x27;water&#x27;&quot;.

==Mythology==
===Creation of life and sickness===
The cosmogenic myth common in Sumer was that of the hieros gamos, a sacred marriage where divine principles in the form of dualistic opposites came together as male and female to give birth to the cosmos. In the epic &quot;Enki and Ninhursag&quot;, Enki, as lord of &quot;Ab&quot; or fresh water, is living with his wife in the paradise of Dilmun where

Despite being a place where &quot;the raven uttered no cries&quot; and &quot;the lion killed not, the wolf snatched not the lamb, unknown was the kid-killing dog, unknown was the grain devouring boar&quot;, Dilmun had no water and Enki heard the cries of its goddess, Ninsikil, and orders the sun-god Utu to bring fresh water from the Earth for Dilmun. As a result,

Dilmun was identified with Bahrain, whose name in Arabic means &quot;two seas&quot;, where the fresh waters of the Arabian aquifer mingle with the salt waters of the Persian Gulf. This mingling of waters was known in Sumerian as Nammu, and was identified as the mother of Enki.

The subsequent tale, with similarities to the Biblical story of the forbidden fruit, repeats the story of how fresh water brings life to a barren land. Enki, the Water-Lord then &quot;caused to flow the &#x27;water of the heart&quot; and having fertilised his consort Ninhursag, also known as Ki or Earth, after &quot;Nine days being her nine months, the months of &#x27;womanhood&#x27;... like good butter, Nintu, the mother of the land, ...like good butter, gave birth to Ninsar, (Lady Greenery)&quot;. When Ninhursag left him, as Water-Lord he came upon Ninsar (Lady Greenery). Not knowing her to be his daughter, and because she reminds him of his absent consort, Enki then seduces and has intercourse with her. Ninsar then gave birth to Ninkurra (Lady Fruitfulness or Lady Pasture), and leaves Enki alone again. A second time, Enki, in his loneliness finds and seduces Ninkurra, and from the union Ninkurra gave birth to Uttu (weaver or spider, the weaver of the web of life).

A third time Enki succumbs to temptation, and attempts seduction of Uttu. Upset about Enki&#x27;s reputation, Uttu consults Ninhursag, who, upset at the promiscuous wayward nature of her spouse, advises Uttu to avoid the riverbanks, the places likely to be affected by flooding, the home of Enki. In another version of this myth, Ninhursag takes Enki&#x27;s semen from Uttu&#x27;s womb and plants it in the earth where eight plants rapidly germinate. With his two-faced servant and steward Isimud, &quot;Enki, in the swampland, in the swampland lies stretched out, &#x27;What is this (plant), what is this (plant).&#x27; His messenger Isimud, answers him; &#x27;My king, this is the tree-plant&#x27;, he says to him. He cuts it off for him and he (Enki) eats it&quot;. And so, despite warnings, Enki consumes the other seven fruit. Consuming his own semen, he falls pregnant (ill with swellings) in his jaw, his teeth, his mouth, his hip, his throat, his limbs, his side and his rib. The gods are at a loss to know what to do; chagrined they &quot;sit in the dust&quot;. As Enki lacks a birth canal through which to give birth, he seems to be dying with swellings. The fox then asks Enlil, King of the Gods, &quot;If I bring Ninhursag before thee, what shall be my reward?&quot; Ninhursag&#x27;s sacred fox then fetches the goddess.

Ninhursag relents and takes Enki&#x27;s Ab (water, or semen) into her body, and gives birth to gods of healing of each part of the body: Abu for the jaw, Nanshe for the throat, Nintul for the hip, Ninsutu for the tooth, Ninkasi for the mouth, Dazimua for the side, Enshagag for the limbs. The last one, Ninti (Lady Rib), is also a pun on Lady Life, a title of Ninhursag herself. The story thus symbolically reflects the way in which life is brought forth through the addition of water to the land, and once it grows, water is required to bring plants to fruit. It also counsels balance and responsibility, nothing to excess.

Ninti, the title of Ninhursag, also means &quot;the mother of all living&quot;, and was a title later given to the Hurrian goddess Kheba. This is also the title given in the Bible to Eve, the Hebrew and Aramaic &quot;Ḥawwah&quot; (חוה), who was made from the rib of Adam, in a strange reflection of the Sumerian myth, in which Adam – not Enki – walks in the Garden of Paradise.

===Making of man===
After six generations of gods, in the Babylonian &quot;Enûma Eliš&quot;, in the seventh generation, (Akkadian &quot;shapattu&quot; or sabath), the younger Igigi gods, the sons and daughters of Enlil and Ninlil, go on strike and refuse their duties of keeping creation working. Abzu, god of fresh water, co-creator of the cosmos, threatens to destroy the world with his waters, and the gods gather in terror. Enki promises to help and puts Abzu to sleep, confining him in irrigation canals and places him in the Kur, beneath his city of Eridu. But the universe is still threatened, as Tiamat, angry at the imprisonment of Abzu and at the prompting of her son and vizier Kingu, decides to take back creation herself. The gods gather again in terror and turn to Enki for help, but Enki – who harnessed Abzu, Tiamat&#x27;s consort, for irrigation – refuses to get involved. The gods then seek help elsewhere, and the patriarchal Enlil, their father, god of Nippur, promises to solve the problem if they make him King of the Gods. In the Babylonian tale, Enlil&#x27;s role is taken by Marduk, Enki&#x27;s son, and in the Assyrian version it is Ashur. After dispatching Tiamat with the &quot;arrows of his winds&quot; down her throat and constructing the heavens with the arch of her ribs, Enlil places her tail in the sky as the Milky Way, and her crying eyes become the source of the Tigris and Euphrates. But there is still the problem of &quot;who will keep the cosmos working&quot;. Enki, who might have otherwise come to their aid, is lying in a deep sleep and fails to hear their cries. His mother Nammu (creatrix also of Abzu and Tiamat) &quot;brings the tears of the gods&quot; before Enki and says

Enki then advises that they create a servant of the gods, humankind, out of clay and blood. Against Enki&#x27;s wish, the gods decide to slay Kingu, and Enki finally consents to use Kingu&#x27;s blood to make the first human, with whom Enki always later has a close relationship, the first of the seven sages, seven wise men or &quot;Abgallu&quot; (&quot;ab&quot; = water, &quot;gal&quot; = great, &quot;lu&quot; = man), also known as Adapa. Enki assembles a team of divinities to help him, creating a host of &quot;good and princely fashioners&quot;. He tells his mother:

Adapa, the first man fashioned, later goes and acts as the advisor to the King of Eridu, when in the Sumerian King-List, the &quot;me&quot; of &quot;kingship descends on Eridu&quot;.

Samuel Noah Kramer believes that behind this myth of Enki&#x27;s confinement of Abzu lies an older one of the struggle between Enki and the Dragon Kur (the underworld).

The Atrahasis-Epos has it that Enlil requested from Nammu the creation of humans. And Nammu told him that with the help of Enki (her son) she can create humans in the image of gods.

===Uniter of languages===
In the Sumerian epic entitled &quot;Enmerkar and the Lord of Aratta&quot;, in a speech of Enmerkar, an introductory spell appears, recounting Enki having had mankind communicate in one language (following Jay Crisostomo 2019); in other accounts, it is a hymn imploring Enki to do so. 
In either case, Enki &quot;facilitated the debates between [the two kings] by allowing the world to speak one language,&quot; the presumed superior language of the tablet, i.e. Sumerian.

Jay Crisostomo&#x27;s 2019 translation, based on the recent work of C. Mittermayer is:
S.N. Kramer&#x27;s 1940 translation is as follows:

===The deluge===

In the Sumerian version of the flood myth, the causes of the flood and the reasons for the hero&#x27;s survival are unknown due to the fact that the beginning of the tablet describing the story has been destroyed. Nonetheless, Kramer has stated that it can probably be reasonably inferred that the hero Ziusudra survives due to Enki&#x27;s aid because that is what happens in the later Akkadian and Babylonian versions of the story.

In the later Legend of Atrahasis, Enlil, the King of the Gods, sets out to eliminate humanity, whose noise is disturbing his rest. He successively sends drought, famine and plague to eliminate humanity, but Enki thwarts his half-brother&#x27;s plans by teaching Atrahasis how to counter these threats. Each time, Atrahasis asks the population to abandon worship of all gods except the one responsible for the calamity, and this seems to shame them into relenting. Humans, however, proliferate a fourth time. Enraged, Enlil convenes a Council of Deities and gets them to promise not to tell humankind that he plans their total annihilation. Enki does not tell Atrahasis directly, but speaks to him in secret via a reed wall. He instructs Atrahasis to build a boat in order to rescue his family and other living creatures from the coming deluge. After the seven-day deluge, the flood hero frees a swallow, a raven and a dove in an effort to find if the flood waters have receded. Upon landing, a sacrifice is made to the gods. Enlil is angry his will has been thwarted yet again, and Enki is named as the culprit. Enki explains that Enlil is unfair to punish the guiltless, and the gods institute measures to ensure that humanity does not become too populous in the future. This is one of the oldest of the surviving Middle Eastern deluge myths.

===Enki and Inanna===

The myth &quot;Enki and Inanna&quot; tells the story of how the young goddess of the É-anna temple of Uruk feasts with her father Enki. The two deities participate in a drinking competition; then, Enki, thoroughly inebriated, gives Inanna all of the &quot;mes&quot;. The next morning, when Enki awakes with a hangover, he asks his servant Isimud for the &quot;mes&quot;, only to be informed that he has given them to Inanna. Upset, he sends &quot;Galla&quot; to recover them. Inanna sails away in the boat of heaven and arrives safely back at the quay of Uruk. Eventually, Enki admits his defeat and accepts a peace treaty with Uruk.

Politically, this myth would seem to indicate events of an early period when political authority passed from Enki&#x27;s city of Eridu to Inanna&#x27;s city of Uruk.

In the myth of &quot;Inanna&#x27;s Descent&quot;, Inanna, in order to console her grieving sister Ereshkigal, who is mourning the death of her husband Gugalana (&quot;gu&quot; &#x27;bull&#x27;, &quot;gal&quot; &#x27;big&#x27;, &quot;ana&quot; &#x27;sky/heaven&#x27;), slain by Gilgamesh and Enkidu, sets out to visit her sister. Inanna tells her servant Ninshubur (&#x27;Lady Evening&#x27;, a reference to Inanna&#x27;s role as the evening star) to get help from Anu, Enlil or Enki if she does not return in three days. After Inanna has not come back, Ninshubur approaches Anu, only to be told that he knows the goddess&#x27;s strength and her ability to take care of herself. While Enlil tells Ninshubur he is busy running the cosmos, Enki immediately expresses concern and dispatches his Galla (Galaturra or Kurgarra, sexless beings created from the dirt from beneath the god&#x27;s finger-nails) to recover the young goddess.
These beings may be the origin of the Greco-Roman &quot;Galli&quot;, androgynous beings of the third sex who played an important part in early religious ritual.

In the story &quot;Inanna and Shukaletuda&quot;, Shukaletuda, the gardener, set by Enki to care for the date palm he had created, finds Inanna sleeping under the palm tree and rapes the goddess in her sleep. Awaking, she discovers that she has been violated and seeks to punish the miscreant. Shukaletuda seeks protection from Enki, whom Bottéro believes to be his father. In classic Enkian fashion, the father advises Shukaletuda to hide in the city where Inanna will not be able to find him. Enki, as the protector of whoever comes to seek his help, and as the empowerer of Inanna, here challenges the young impetuous goddess to control her anger so as to be better able to function as a great judge.

Eventually, after cooling her anger, she too seeks the help of Enki, as spokesperson of the &quot;assembly of the gods&quot;, the Igigi and the Anunnaki. After she presents her case, Enki sees that justice needs to be done and promises help, delivering knowledge of where the miscreant is hiding.

==Influence==
Enki and later Ea were apparently depicted, sometimes, as a man covered with the skin of a fish, and this representation, as likewise the name of his temple E-apsu, &quot;house of the watery deep&quot;, points decidedly to his original character as a god of the waters (see Oannes). Around the excavation of the 18 shrines found on the spot, thousands of carp bones were found, consumed possibly in feasts to the god. Of his cult at Eridu, which goes back to the oldest period of Mesopotamian history, nothing definite is known except that his temple was also associated with Ninhursag&#x27;s temple which was called &quot;Esaggila&quot;, &quot;the lofty head house&quot; (&quot;E&quot;, house, &quot;sag&quot;, head, &quot;ila&quot;, high; or Akkadian goddess = Ila), a name shared with Marduk&#x27;s temple in Babylon, pointing to a staged tower or ziggurat (as with the temple of Enlil at Nippur, which was known as &quot;E-kur&quot; (&quot;kur&quot;, hill)), and that incantations, involving ceremonial rites in which water as a sacred element played a prominent part, formed a feature of his worship. This seems also implicated in the epic of the hieros gamos or sacred marriage of Enki and Ninhursag (above), which seems an etiological myth of the fertilisation of the dry ground by the coming of irrigation water (from Sumerian &quot;a&quot;, &quot;ab&quot;, water or semen). The early inscriptions of Urukagina in fact go so far as to suggest that the divine pair, Enki and Ninki, were the progenitors of seven pairs of gods, including Enki as god of Eridu, Enlil of Nippur, and Su&#x27;en (or Sin) of Ur, and were themselves the children of An (sky, heaven) and Ki (earth). The pool of the Abzu at the front of his temple was adopted also at the temple to Nanna (Akkadian Sin) the Moon, at Ur, and spread from there throughout the Middle East. It is believed to remain today as the sacred pool at Mosques, or as the holy water font in Catholic or Eastern Orthodox churches.

Whether Eridu at one time also played an important political role in Sumerian affairs is not certain, though not improbable. At all events the prominence of &quot;Ea&quot; led, as in the case of Nippur, to the survival of Eridu as a sacred city, long after it had ceased to have any significance as a political center. Myths in which Ea figures prominently have been found in Assurbanipal&#x27;s library, and in the Hattusas archive in Hittite Anatolia. As Ea, Enki had a wide influence outside of Sumer, being equated with El (at Ugarit) and possibly Yah (at Ebla) in the Canaanite &#x27;ilhm pantheon. He is also found in Hurrian and Hittite mythology as a god of contracts, and is particularly favourable to humankind. It has been suggested that etymologically the name Ea comes from the term &quot;*hyy&quot; (life), referring to Enki&#x27;s waters as life-giving. Enki/Ea is essentially a god of civilization, wisdom, and culture. He was also the creator and protector of man, and of the world in general. Traces of this version of Ea appear in the Marduk epic celebrating the achievements of this god and the close connection between the Ea cult at Eridu and that of Marduk. The correlation between the two rises from two other important connections: (1) that the name of Marduk&#x27;s sanctuary at Babylon bears the same name, &quot;Esaggila&quot;, as that of a temple in Eridu, and (2) that Marduk is generally termed the son of Ea, who derives his powers from the voluntary abdication of the father in favour of his son. Accordingly, the incantations originally composed for the Ea cult were re-edited by the priests of Babylon and adapted to the worship of Marduk, and, similarly, the hymns to Marduk betray traces of the transfer to Marduk of attributes which originally belonged to Ea.

It is, however, as the third figure in the triad (the two other members of which were Anu and Enlil) that Ea acquires his permanent place in the pantheon. To him was assigned the control of the watery element, and in this capacity he becomes the &quot;shar apsi&quot;; i.e. king of the Apsu or &quot;the abyss&quot;. The Apsu was figured as the abyss of water beneath the earth, and since the gathering place of the dead, known as Aralu, was situated near the confines of the Apsu, he was also designated as En -Ki; i.e. &quot;lord of that which is below&quot;, in contrast to Anu, who was the lord of the &quot;above&quot; or the heavens. The cult of Ea extended throughout Babylonia and Assyria. We find temples and shrines erected in his honour, e.g. at Nippur, Girsu, Ur, Babylon, Sippar, and Nineveh, and the numerous epithets given to him, as well as the various forms under which the god appears, alike bear witness to the popularity which he enjoyed from the earliest to the latest period of Babylonian-Assyrian history. The consort of Ea, known as Ninhursag, Ki, Uriash Damkina, &quot;lady of that which is below&quot;, or Damgalnunna, &quot;big lady of the waters&quot;, originally was fully equal with Ea, but in more patriarchal Assyrian and Neo-Babylonian times plays a part merely in association with her lord. Generally, however, Enki seems to be a reflection of pre-patriarchal times, in which relations between the sexes were characterised by a situation of greater gender equality. In his character, he prefers persuasion to conflict, which he seeks to avoid if possible.

==Ea and West Semitic deities==
In 1964, a team of Italian archaeologists under the direction of Paolo Matthiae of the University of Rome La Sapienza performed a series of excavations of material from the third-millennium BCE city of Ebla. Much of the written material found in these digs was later translated by Giovanni Pettinato. Among other conclusions, he found a tendency among the inhabitants of Ebla, after the reign of Sargon of Akkad, to replace the name of El, king of the gods of the Canaanite pantheon (found in names such as Mikael and Ishmael), with &quot;Ia&quot; (Mikaia, Ishmaia).

Jean Bottéro (1952) and others suggested that &quot;Ia&quot; in this case is a West Semitic (Canaanite) way of pronouncing the Akkadian name &quot;Ea&quot;. Scholars largely reject the theory identifying this &quot;Ia&quot; with the Israelite theonym &quot;YHWH&quot;, while explaining how it might have been misinterpreted. &quot;Ia&quot; has also been compared by William Hallo with the Ugaritic god &quot;Yamm&quot; (&quot;Sea&quot;), (also called Judge Nahar, or Judge River) whose earlier name in at least one ancient source was &quot;Yaw&quot; or &quot;Ya&#x27;a&quot;.

Ea was also known as &quot;Dagon&quot; and &quot;Uanna&quot; (Grecised &quot;Oannes&quot;), the first of the Seven Sages.

<text>Eli Herschel Wallach ( ; December 7, 1915 – June 24, 2014) was an American film, television, and stage actor from New York City. Known for his character actor roles, his entertainment career spanned over six decades. He received a BAFTA Award, a Tony Award, and an Primetime Emmy Award. He also was inducted into the American Theater Hall of Fame in 1988 and received the Academy Honorary Award in 2010.

Originally trained in stage acting, he garnered over 90 film credits. He and his wife Anne Jackson often appeared together on stage, eventually becoming a notable acting couple in American theater. Wallach initially studied method acting under Sanford Meisner and later became a founding member of the Actors Studio, where he studied under Lee Strasberg. He played a wide variety of roles throughout his career, primarily as a supporting actor. He won the Tony Award for Best Supporting or Featured Actor in a Play for &quot;The Rose Tattoo&quot; (1951).

For his debut screen performance in &quot;Baby Doll&quot; (1956), he won a BAFTA Award for Best Newcomer and a Golden Globe Award nomination. Among his other most famous roles are Calvera in &quot;The Magnificent Seven&quot; (1960), Guido in &quot;The Misfits&quot; (1961), and Tuco (&quot;The Ugly&quot;) in &quot;The Good, the Bad and the Ugly&quot; (1966) and Don Altobello in &quot;The Godfather Part III&quot; (1990). Other notable films include &quot;How the West Was Won&quot; (1962), &quot;Tough Guys&quot; (1986), &quot;The Two Jakes&quot; (1990), &quot;The Associate&quot; (1996), &quot;The Holiday&quot; (2006), &quot;Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps&quot;, and &quot;The Ghost Writer&quot; (both 2010). He received Primetime Emmy Award nominations for &quot;Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip&quot; (2007) and &quot;Nurse Jackie&quot; (2011).

==Early life and education==
Eli Herschel Wallach was born on December 7, 1915, at 156 Union Street in Red Hook, Brooklyn, a son of Polish Jewish immigrants Abraham and Bertha (Schorr) Wallach from Przemyśl. He had a brother and two sisters. He and his family were among only a few Jews in an otherwise Italian American neighborhood. His parents owned Bertha&#x27;s Candy Store. Wallach graduated in 1936 from the University of Texas with a degree in history. In a later interview, Wallach said that he learned to ride horses while in Texas, explaining that he liked Texas because &quot;It opened my eyes to the word &quot;friendship...&quot; You could rely on people. If they gave you their word, that was it ... It was an education.&quot;

Two years later he earned a master of arts degree in education from the City College of New York. He gained his first method acting experience at the Neighborhood Playhouse School of the Theatre in New York City, where he studied under Sanford Meisner. There, according to Wallach, actors were forced to &quot;unlearn&quot; all their physical and vocal mannerisms, while traditional stage etiquette and &quot;singsong&quot; deliveries were &quot;utterly excised&quot; from his classroom.

==Military service==
Wallach&#x27;s education was cut short when he was drafted into the United States Army in 1940. He served as a staff sergeant and medic in a military hospital in Hawaii and later was sent to Officer Candidate School (OCS) in Abilene, Texas, to train as a medical administrative officer. Commissioned as a second lieutenant, he was ordered to Casablanca. Later, when he was serving in France, a senior officer noticed his acting career and asked him to create a show for the patients. He and his unit wrote a play called &quot;Is This the Army?&quot;, which was inspired by Irving Berlin&#x27;s &quot;This Is the Army&quot;. In the comedy, Wallach and the other actors mocked Axis dictators, with Wallach portraying Adolf Hitler. Wallach was discharged as a captain following the war&#x27;s end in 1945. He was awarded the Army Good Conduct Medal, the American Defense Service Medal, the American Campaign Medal, the Asiatic–Pacific Campaign Medal, the European–African–Middle Eastern Campaign Medal and the World War II Victory Medal.

==Career==
===Stage actor===
Wallach took classes in acting at the Dramatic Workshop of the New School in New York City with the influential German director Erwin Piscator. He later became a founding member of the Actors Studio, taught by Lee Strasberg. There, he studied more method acting technique with founding member Robert Lewis, and with other students including Marlon Brando, Montgomery Clift, Herbert Berghof, Sidney Lumet, and his soon-to-be wife, Anne Jackson. Wallach became Marilyn Monroe&#x27;s first new friend when she became a student at the Actors Studio, once insisting on watching him perform in &quot;The Teahouse of the August Moon&quot; from the backstage wings, simply to see up close how experienced actors perform a two-hour play. She also became friends with his wife, Anne Jackson, also studying at the Studio, and would visit the couple at their home and sometimes babysit their new child.

In 1945 Wallach made his Broadway debut and he won a Tony Award in 1951 for his performance alongside Maureen Stapleton in the Tennessee Williams play &quot;The Rose Tattoo&quot;. His other theater credits include &quot;Mister Roberts&quot;, &quot;The Teahouse of the August Moon&quot;, &quot;Camino Real&quot;, &quot;Major Barbara&quot; (in which director Charles Laughton discouraged Wallach&#x27;s established method acting style), &quot;Luv&quot;, and &quot;Staircase&quot;, co-starring Milo O&#x27;Shea, which was a serious depiction of an aging homosexual couple. He also played a role in a tour of &quot;Antony and Cleopatra,&quot; produced by the actress Katharine Cornell in 1946. He exposed Americans to the work of playwright Eugène Ionesco in plays including &quot;The Chairs&quot; and &quot;The Lesson&quot; in 1958, and in 1961 &quot;Rhinoceros&quot; opposite Zero Mostel. He last starred on stage as the title character in &quot;Visiting Mr. Green&quot;.
The stage was where Wallach focused his early career. From 1945 to 1950 he and his wife, Anne Jackson, worked together acting in various plays by Tennessee Williams. The five years following, he continued only working on stage, not becoming involved in film work until 1956. During those years, however, they were generally having a hard time making ends meet. He recalls they were getting along on unemployment insurance and living in a one-room, $35 a month apartment on lower Fifth Avenue in the Village. When he did get offered early movie parts, he turned them down with no regrets, and very early in his career he explained his reasoning:

He said that the stage was what attracted him most and what he &quot;needed&quot; to do. &quot;Acting is the most alive thing I can do, and the most joyous&quot;, he stated.

Wallach and Jackson became one of the best-known acting couples in the American theater, as iconic as Alfred Lunt and Lynn Fontanne, and Jessica Tandy and Hume Cronyn, and they looked for opportunities to work together. During an interview, he said of Jackson, &quot;I have tremendous respect and admiration for her as an actress . . . we have a terrific working compatibility when we&#x27;re in the same play, especially when the play means something important to us.&quot; When he did gravitate toward accepting parts in films, he did so to &quot;help pay the bills&quot;, he said, adding, &quot;for actors, movies are a means to an end.&quot;

Despite the fact that he eventually acted in over 90 films and almost as many television dramas, he continued to accept stage parts throughout his career, often with Jackson. They played in comedies like &quot;The Typists&quot; and &quot;The Tiger&quot; in 1963, and acted together in &quot;Waltz of the Toreadors&quot; in 1973. In 1978 they played in a revival of &quot;The Diary of Anne Frank&quot;, along with their daughters, and in 1984 they acted in &quot;Nest of the Wood Grouse,&quot; directed by Joseph Papp. Four years later, in 1988, they acted in a revival of &quot;Cafe Crown&quot;, a portrait of the Yiddish theater scene during its prime. They continued acting together as late as 2000, while he also took on roles alone throughout all those years.

===Film and television roles===
Wallach&#x27;s film debut was in Elia Kazan&#x27;s controversial 1956 &quot;Baby Doll&quot;, for which he won the British Academy Film Awards (BAFTA) as &quot;Most Promising Newcomer.&quot; &quot;Baby Doll&quot; was controversial because of its underlying sexual theme. Director Elia Kazan however, set explicit limits on Wallach&#x27;s scenes, telling him not to actually seduce Carroll Baker, but instead to create an unfulfilled erotic tension. Kazan later explained his reasoning:
Wallach went on to a prolific career as &quot;one of the greatest &#x27;character actors&#x27; ever to appear on stage and screen&quot;, notes Turner Classic Movies, acting in over 90 films. Having grown up on the &quot;mean streets&quot; of an Italian American neighborhood, and his versatility as a method actor, Wallach developed the ability to play a wide variety of different roles, although he tried to not get pinned down to any single type of character. &quot;Right now I&#x27;m playing an old man&quot;, he said at age 84. But &quot;I&#x27;ve been through all the ethnic groups, from Mexican bandits to Italian Mafia heads to Okinawans to half-breeds, and now I&#x27;m playing old Jews. Who knows?&quot;

Noting this versatility as a character actor, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences called him &quot;the quintessential chameleon&quot;, with the ability to play different characters &quot;effortlessly&quot;, and &quot;L.A. Times&quot; theater critic Charles McNulty saw Wallach&#x27;s &quot;power to illuminate&quot; his various screen or stage personas as being &quot;radioactive.&quot; &quot;The Guardian&quot; has written that &quot;Wallach was made for character acting&quot;, and includes movie clips from some of his most memorable roles in a tribute to him.

In 1961, Wallach co-starred with Marilyn Monroe, Montgomery Clift and Clark Gable in &quot;The Misfits&quot;, Monroe&#x27;s and Gable&#x27;s last film before their deaths. Wallach never learned why he was cast in the film, although he suspected that Monroe had something to do with it. Its screenwriter, Arthur Miller, who was married to Monroe at the time, said that &quot;Eli Wallach is the happiest good actor I&#x27;ve ever known. He really enjoys the work.&quot;

Some of his other films included &quot;The Lineup&quot; (1958); &quot;Lord Jim&quot; (1965) with Peter O&#x27;Toole; a comic role in &quot;How to Steal a Million&quot; (1966), again with O&#x27;Toole, and Audrey Hepburn; and as Tuco (&quot;the Ugly&quot;) in Sergio Leone&#x27;s &quot;The Good, the Bad and the Ugly&quot; (1966) with Clint Eastwood and Lee Van Cleef, followed by other Spaghetti Westerns, such as &quot;Ace High&quot;. At one point, Henry Fonda had asked Wallach whether he himself should accept a part offered to him to act in a similar Western, &quot;Once Upon a Time in the West&quot; (1968), which would also be directed by Leone. Wallach said &quot;Yes, you&#x27;ll enjoy the challenge&quot;, and Fonda later thanked Wallach for that advice.

Wallach and Eastwood became friends during the filming of &quot;The Good, the Bad and the Ugly&quot; and he recalled their off-work time together: &quot;Clint was the tall, silent type. He&#x27;s the kind where you open up and do all the talking. He smiles and nods and stores it all away in that wonderful calculator of a brain.&quot; In 2003 Wallach acted in &quot;Mystic River&quot;, produced and directed by Eastwood, who once said &quot;working with Eli Wallach has been one of the great pleasures of my life.&quot;

A pivotal moment in Wallach&#x27;s career came in 1953, when he, along with Frank Sinatra and Harvey Lembeck, tried out for the role of Maggio in the film &quot;From Here to Eternity&quot;. Sinatra biographer Kitty Kelly notes that while Sinatra&#x27;s test was good, it had none of the &quot;consummate acting ability&quot; of Wallach. Producer Harry Cohn and director Fred Zinnemann were &quot;dazzled&quot; by Wallach&#x27;s screen test and wanted him to play the part. However, Wallach had previously been offered an important role in another Tennessee Williams play, &quot;Camino Real&quot;, to be directed by Elia Kazan, and turned down the movie role. Wallach said that when he learned that the play had finally received financing, he &quot;grabbed&quot; the opportunity: &quot;It was a remarkable piece of writing by the leading playwright in America and it was going to be directed by the country&#x27;s best. There really wasn&#x27;t much of a choice for me.&quot; The film, however, went on to win eight Academy Awards, including one for Sinatra, which revived his career. Wallach recalled afterwards, &quot;Whenever Sinatra saw me, he&#x27;d say, &#x27;Hello, you crazy actor!&#x27;&quot; Wallach, however, said he had no regrets.

Film historian James Welsh states that during Wallach&#x27;s career, he appeared in most of the &quot;prestige&quot; television dramas during the &quot;Golden Age&quot; of the 1950s, including &quot;Studio One&quot;, &quot;The Philco Television Playhouse&quot;, &quot;The Armstrong Circle Theatre&quot;, &quot;Playhouse 90&quot;, and &quot;The Hallmark Hall of Fame&quot;, among others. He won the 1966–1967 Emmy Award for his role in the telefilm &quot;The Poppy is Also a Flower&quot;. In 2006 Wallach appeared on NBC&#x27;s &quot;Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip&quot;, playing a former writer who was blacklisted in the 1950s. His character was a writer on &quot;The Philco Comedy Hour&quot;, a show that aired on a fictional NBS network. This is a reference to &quot;The Philco Television Playhouse&quot;, in several episodes of which Wallach actually appeared in 1955. Wallach earned a 2007 Emmy nomination for his work on the show.
During the filming of &quot;The Good, the Bad and the Ugly&quot;, Wallach nearly died three times. Once, he accidentally drank a bottle of acid which was placed next to his pop bottle; another time was in a scene where he was about to be hanged, someone fired a pistol which caused the horse underneath him to bolt and run while Wallach&#x27;s hands were still tied behind his back; in a different scene with him lying on a railroad track, he was close to being decapitated by steps jutting out from the train.

Wallach appeared as DC Comics&#x27; supervillain Mr. Freeze in the 1960s &quot;Batman&quot; television series. He said that he received more fan mail about his role as Mr. Freeze than for all his other roles combined. He played Gus Farber in the television miniseries &quot;Seventh Avenue&quot; in 1977, and 10 years later, at the age of 71, he starred alongside Michael Landon in &quot;Highway to Heaven&quot; episode &quot;A Father&#x27;s Faith&quot;. Three years later, he played aging mob boss Don Altobello in Francis Ford Coppola&#x27;s &quot;The Godfather Part III&quot;.

On November 13, 2010, at the age of 94, Wallach received an Academy Honorary Award for his contribution to the film industry from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. A few years prior to that event, Kate Winslet told another audience that Wallach, with whom she acted in &quot;The Holiday&quot; in 2006, was one of the &quot;most charismatic men&quot; she&#x27;d met, and her &quot;very own sexiest man alive.&quot;

Wallach&#x27;s final performance was in the short film &quot;The Train&quot; (2015). Wallach plays a Holocaust survivor who, in a meeting, teaches a self-consumed and preoccupied young man that life can change in a moment. The short was shot in early 2014 and premiered on August 6, 2015, at the Rhode Island International Film Festival.

Between 1984 and 1997, he also performed voiceovers in a series of television commercials for the Toyota Pickup.

==Personal life==
Wallach was married to actress Anne Jackson, with whom he frequently shared the screen, from March 5, 1948, until his death on June 24, 2014. They had three children: Peter, Katherine and Roberta.

A few years before 2005, Wallach lost sight in his left eye due to a stroke.

His niece is historian Joan Wallach Scott (daughter of his brother Sam). A.O. Scott, a film critic for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, is his great-nephew.

Wallach&#x27;s grandson is Tracy Wallach, bass player for the Arizona metal band Icon.

==Death==
Wallach died on June 24, 2014, of natural causes at the age of 98. His body was cremated.

Katherine Wallach told &quot;The New York Times&quot; that Anne Jackson died on April 12, 2016, aged 90, at her home in Manhattan.

<doc id="10484" wikidata="Q218255" url="?curid=10484" title="Electric Light Orchestra">
<text>The Electric Light Orchestra (ELO) are an English rock band formed in Birmingham in 1970 by multi-instrumentalists Jeff Lynne and Roy Wood and drummer Bev Bevan. Their music is characterised by a fusion of pop and classical arrangements with futuristic iconography. After Wood&#x27;s departure in 1972, Lynne became the band&#x27;s sole leader, arranging and producing every album while writing nearly all of their original material. During their first run from 1970 to 1986, Lynne and Bevan were the group&#x27;s only consistent members.

The group&#x27;s name is a pun that references both electric light and &quot;light orchestral music&quot;, a popular style featured in places such as the BBC Light Programme between the 1940s and 1960s. ELO was formed out of Lynne&#x27;s and Wood&#x27;s desire to create modern rock and pop songs with classical influences. It derived as an offshoot of Wood&#x27;s previous band, the Move, of which Lynne and Bevan were also members. During the 1970s and 1980s, ELO released a string of top 10 albums and singles, including the band&#x27;s most commercially successful album, the double album &quot;Out of the Blue&quot; (1977). Two ELO albums reached the top of the British charts: the disco-inspired &quot;Discovery&quot; (1979) and the science-fiction-themed concept album &quot;Time&quot; (1981). 

In 1986, Lynne lost interest in the band and disbanded the group. Bevan responded by forming his own band, ELO Part II, which later became The Orchestra. Following a brief reunion from 2000 to 2001, ELO once again went inactive until 2014, when Lynne re-formed the band with Richard Tandy as Jeff Lynne&#x27;s ELO. Tandy died in May 2024, leaving Lynne as the sole member. In 2024 ELO embarked on their final tour, which had been announced 4 years prior to Tandy&#x27;s death, but was delayed by the COVID-19 pandemic.

During ELO&#x27;s original 13-year period of active recording and touring, they sold over 50 million records worldwide. They collected 19 CRIA, 21 RIAA, and 38 BPI awards. From 1972 to 1986 ELO accumulated 27 Top 40 songs on the UK Singles Chart, and fifteen Top 20 songs on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. The band also holds the record for having the most &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 Top 40 hits (20) without a number one. In 2017, four key members of ELO (Wood, Lynne, Bevan, and Tandy) were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

==History==

=== 1970–1973: Formation and early albums ===

In 1968, Roy Wood—guitarist, vocalist and songwriter of the Move—had an idea to form a new band that would use violins, cellos, string basses, horns and woodwinds to give their music a classical sound, allowing rock music to &quot;pick up where the Beatles left off&quot; in a new direction. The orchestral instruments would be the main focus, rather than the guitars. Jeff Lynne, frontman of fellow Birmingham group The Idle Race, was excited by the concept. When Trevor Burton left the Move in February 1969, Lynne was asked by Wood to join, only to say no, as he was still focused on finding success with his band. But in January 1970, when Carl Wayne quit the band, Lynne accepted Wood&#x27;s second invitation to join, on the condition that they focus their energy on the new project.

On 12 July 1970, when Wood added multiple cellos to a Lynne-penned song intended to be a Move B-side, the new concept became a reality and &quot;10538 Overture&quot; became the first Electric Light Orchestra song. The original plan was to end The Move following the release of the &quot;Looking On&quot; album at the end of 1970, crossing over to the new unit in the new year. But to help finance the fledgling band, one further Move album, &quot;Message from the Country&quot;, was recorded during the lengthy ELO recordings and released in mid-1971. The resulting debut album &quot;The Electric Light Orchestra&quot; was released in December 1971. Only the trio of Wood, Lynne and Bevan played on all songs, with Bill Hunt supplying the French Horn parts and Steve Woolam playing violin. It was released in the United States in March 1972 as &quot;No Answer&quot;. The name was chosen after a U.S. record company secretary had tried to ring the UK company to get the name of the album. They were unavailable so she left a note reading &quot;No answer&quot;. &quot;10538 Overture&quot; became a UK top-ten hit. With both bands&#x27; albums in the stores simultaneously, the Move and ELO both appeared on television during this period.

ELO&#x27;s debut concert took place on 16 April 1972 at the Greyhound Pub in Croydon, Surrey, with a line-up of Wood, Lynne, Bevan, Bill Hunt (keyboards/French horn), Andy Craig (cello), Mike Edwards (cello), Wilfred Gibson (violin), Hugh McDowell (cello), and Richard Tandy (bass). However, this line-up did not last for long. First Craig departed, and then Wood, during the recordings for the band&#x27;s second LP. Taking Hunt and McDowell with him, Wood left the band to form Wizzard. Both cited problems with their manager, Don Arden, who Wood felt failed in his role, and an unsatisfactory tour of Italy. However, Arden would manage Wizzard, despite Wood&#x27;s negative comments towards Arden. Despite predictions from the music press that the band would fold without Wood, who had been the driving force behind the creation of ELO, Lynne stepped up to lead the band, with Bevan, Edwards, Gibson and Tandy (who had switched from bass to keyboards to replace Hunt) remaining from the previous line-up, and new recruits Mike de Albuquerque and Colin Walker joining the band on bass and cello, respectively.

The new line-up performed at the 1972 Reading Festival on 12 August 1972. Barcus Berry instrument pick-ups, now sported by the band&#x27;s string trio, allowed them to have proper amplification on stage for their instruments, which had previously been all but drowned out by the electrified instruments. The band released their second album &quot;ELO 2&quot; in early 1973, which produced their second UK top 10 and their first US chart single, an elaborate version of the Chuck Berry classic &quot;Roll Over Beethoven&quot; (which also incorporated the first 2 or 3 lines from the first movement of Beethoven&#x27;s own Fifth Symphony). ELO also made their first appearance on &quot;American Bandstand&quot;. During the recording of the third album, Gibson was let go after a dispute over money, Mik Kaminski joined as violinist, and Walker left since touring was keeping him away from his family too much. Remaining cellist Edwards finished the cello parts for the album. The resulting album, &quot;On the Third Day&quot;, was released in late 1973, with the American version featuring the popular single &quot;Showdown&quot;. After leaving Wizzard, Hugh McDowell returned as the group&#x27;s second cellist, also in late 1973, in time to appear on the &quot;On the Third Day&quot; cover in some regions, despite not having played on the album.

===1974–1982: Global success and concept albums===
For the band&#x27;s fourth album, &quot;Eldorado&quot;, a concept album about a daydreamer, Lynne stopped multi-tracking strings and hired Louis Clark as string arranger with an orchestra and choir. ELO&#x27;s string players still continued to perform on recordings, however. The first single off the album, &quot;Can&#x27;t Get It Out of My Head&quot;, became their first US top 10 hit, and &quot;Eldorado, A Symphony&quot; became ELO&#x27;s first gold album. Mike de Albuquerque departed the band during the recording sessions as he wished to spend more time with his family, and consequently much of the bass on the album was performed by Lynne.

Following the release of &quot;Eldorado&quot;, Kelly Groucutt was recruited as bassist and in early 1975, Melvyn Gale replaced Edwards on cello. The line-up stabilised as the band took to a decidedly more accessible sound. ELO had become successful in the US at this point and the group was a star attraction on the stadium and arena circuit, and appeared on &quot;The Midnight Special&quot; more than any other band in that show&#x27;s history with four appearances (in 1973, 1975, 1976, and 1977).

&quot;Face the Music&quot; was released in 1975, producing the hit singles &quot;Evil Woman&quot;, their third UK top 10, and &quot;Strange Magic&quot;. The opening instrumental &quot;Fire on High&quot;, with its mix of strings and acoustic guitars, saw heavy exposure as the theme music for the American television programme &quot;CBS Sports Spectacular&quot; in the mid-1970s. The group toured extensively from 3 February to 13 April 1976, playing 68 shows in 76 days in the US.

Their sixth album, the platinum selling &quot;A New World Record&quot;, became their first UK top 10 album when it was released in 1976. It contained the hit singles &quot;Livin&#x27; Thing&quot;, &quot;Telephone Line&quot;, &quot;Rockaria!&quot; and &quot;Do Ya&quot;, the last a re-recording of The Move&#x27;s final single. The band toured in support in the US only from September 1976 to April 1977 with a break in December, then an &quot;American Music Awards&quot; show appearance on 31 January 1977, plus a one-off gig in San Diego in August 1977.

&quot;A New World Record&quot; was followed by a multi-platinum selling album, the double-LP &quot;Out of the Blue&quot;, in 1977. &quot;Out of the Blue&quot; featured the singles &quot;Turn to Stone&quot;, &quot;Sweet Talkin&#x27; Woman&quot;, &quot;Mr. Blue Sky&quot;, and &quot;Wild West Hero&quot;, each becoming a hit in the United Kingdom. The band then set out on a nine-month, 92-date world tour, with an enormous set and a hugely expensive spaceship stage with fog machines and a laser display. In the United States the concerts were billed as &quot;The Big Night&quot; and were their largest to date, with 62,000 people seeing them at Cleveland Stadium. &quot;The Big Night&quot; went on to become the highest-grossing live concert tour in music history up to that point (1978). The band played at London&#x27;s Wembley Arena for eight straight sold-out nights during the tour, another record at the time.

During an Australian tour in early 1978, Electric Light Orchestra were presented with 9 platinum awards for the albums &quot;Out of the Blue&quot; and &quot;New World Record&quot;.

In 1979, the multi-platinum album &quot;Discovery&quot; was released, reaching number one on the UK Albums Chart. Although the biggest hit on the album (also ELO&#x27;s biggest hit overall) was the rock song &quot;Don&#x27;t Bring Me Down&quot;, the album was noted for its heavy disco influence. &quot;Discovery&quot; also produced the hits &quot;Shine a Little Love&quot; (their only No. 1 hit on a US singles chart---Radio &amp; Records (R&amp;R)), &quot;Last Train to London&quot;, &quot;Confusion&quot;, and &quot;The Diary of Horace Wimp&quot;. Another song, &quot;Midnight Blue&quot;, was released as a single in southeast Asia. The band recorded promotional videos for all the songs on the album.
By the end of 1979, ELO had reached the peak of their stardom, selling millions of albums and singles, and even inspiring a parody/tribute song on the Randy Newman album &quot;Born Again&quot;, titled &quot;The Story of a Rock and Roll Band&quot;. During 1979, Jeff Lynne also turned down an invitation for ELO to headline the August 1979 Knebworth Festival concerts. That allowed Led Zeppelin the chance to headline instead.

In January 1980, Hugh McDowell, Melvyn Gale, and Mik Kaminski were fired, as Jeff Lynne sought to take the band in a more modern direction. Later that year, Lynne was asked to write for the soundtrack of the musical film &quot;Xanadu&quot; and provided half of the songs, with the other half written by John Farrar and performed by the film&#x27;s star Olivia Newton-John. The film performed poorly at the box office, but the soundtrack did exceptionally well, eventually going double platinum. The album spawned hit singles from both Newton-John (&quot;Magic&quot;, a No. 1 hit in the United States, and &quot;Suddenly&quot; with Cliff Richard) and ELO (&quot;I&#x27;m Alive&quot;, which went gold, &quot;All Over the World&quot; and &quot;Don&#x27;t Walk Away&quot;). The title track, performed by both Newton-John and ELO, is ELO&#x27;s only song to top the UK singles chart. More than a quarter of a century later, &quot;Xanadu&quot;, a Broadway musical based on the film, opened on 10 July 2007 at the Helen Hayes Theatre to uniformly good reviews. It received four Tony Award nominations. The musical received its UK premiere in London in October 2015.

In 1981, ELO&#x27;s sound changed again with the science fiction concept album &quot;Time&quot;, a throwback to earlier, more progressive rock albums like &quot;Eldorado&quot;. With the string section now departed, synthesisers took a dominating role, as was the trend in the larger music scene of the time; although studio strings were present on some of the tracks conducted by Rainer Pietsch, the overall soundscape had a more electronic feel in keeping with the futuristic nature of the album. &quot;Time&quot; topped the UK charts for two weeks and was the last ELO studio album to be certified platinum in the United Kingdom until &quot;Alone in the Universe&quot; in 2015. Singles from the album included &quot;Hold On Tight&quot;, &quot;Twilight&quot;, &quot;The Way Life&#x27;s Meant to Be&quot;, &quot;Here Is the News&quot; and &quot;Ticket to the Moon&quot;. However, the release of the single for &quot;Rain Is Falling&quot; in 1982 was the band&#x27;s first single in the US to fail to reach the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top 200 since 1975, and the release of &quot;The Way Life&#x27;s Meant to Be&quot; similarly was their first single in the UK to fail to chart since 1976. The band embarked on their last world tour to promote the LP. For the tour, Kaminski returned to the line-up on violin, whilst Louis Clark (synthesizers) and Dave Morgan (guitar, keyboards, synthesizers, vocals) also joined the on stage lineup. Clark had previously handled string arrangements for the band.

===1983–1986: &quot;Secret Messages&quot;, &quot;Balance of Power&quot;, disbanding===
Jeff Lynne wanted to follow &quot;Time&quot; with a double album, but CBS blocked his plan on the grounds that a double vinyl album would be too expensive and not sell as well as a single record, so as a result, the new album was edited down to a single disc and released as &quot;Secret Messages&quot; in 1983; many of the out-takes were later released on &quot;Afterglow&quot; or as B-sides of singles. The album was a hit in the UK reaching the top 5, but its release was undermined by a string of bad news that there would be no tour to promote the LP. Lynne, discouraged by the dwindling crowds on the &quot;Time&quot; tour, CBS&#x27;s order to cut &quot;Secret Messages&quot; down to one disc, and his falling out with manager Don Arden, decided to end ELO in late 1983.

Drummer Bevan moved on to play drums for Black Sabbath, and bassist Groucutt, unhappy with no touring income that year, decided to sue Lynne and Jet Records in November 1983, eventually resulting in a settlement for the sum of £300,000 (equivalent to £994,300 in 2018). While &quot;Secret Messages&quot; debuted at number four in the United Kingdom, it subsequently performed poorly in the charts, with a lack of hit singles (though &quot;Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Is King&quot; was a sizeable hit in UK, the US and Australia) and a lukewarm media response.

That same year, Lynne moved into production work: having already produced two tracks for the Dave Edmunds album &quot;Information&quot;, he would go on to produce six cuts for his next, &quot;Riff Raff&quot; in 1984, and one cut on the Everly Brothers reunion album &quot;EB 84&quot;. He also composed a track for former ABBA member Agnetha Fältskog&#x27;s 1985 album &quot;Eyes of a Woman&quot;.

Lynne and Tandy went on to record tracks for the 1984 &quot;Electric Dreams&quot; soundtrack under Lynne&#x27;s name; however, Lynne was contractually obliged to make one more ELO album. So Lynne, Bevan and Tandy returned to the studio in 1984 and 1985 as a three-piece (with Christian Schneider playing saxophone on some tracks and Lynne again doubling on bass in addition to his usual guitar in the absence of an official bass player) to record &quot;Balance of Power&quot;, released early in 1986 after some delays. Though the single &quot;Calling America&quot; placed in the Top 30 in the United Kingdom (number 28) and Top 20 in the States, subsequent singles failed to chart. The album lacked actual classical strings, which were replaced once again by synthesizers, played by Tandy and Lynne. However, despite being a 3-piece, much of the album was made by Lynne alone, with Tandy and Bevan giving their additions later.

The band was then rejoined by Kaminski, Clark and Morgan, adding Martin Smith on bass guitar, and proceeded to perform a small number of live ELO performances in 1986, including shows in England and Germany along with US appearances on &quot;American Bandstand&quot;, &quot;Solid Gold&quot;, then at Disneyland that summer. ELO performed at the Heart Beat 86 charity concert organised by Bevan in the band&#x27;s hometown of Birmingham on 15 March 1986; a hint of Lynne&#x27;s future was seen when George Harrison appeared onstage during the encore, joining in the all-star jam of &quot;Johnny B. Goode&quot;. ELO&#x27;s last performance for several years occurred on 13 July 1986 in Stuttgart, Germany playing as opening act to Rod Stewart. With Lynne no longer under contractual obligation to attend further scheduled performances, ELO effectively disbanded after that final show in Stuttgart in 1986, but there was no announcement made of it for the next two years, during which George Harrison&#x27;s Lynne-produced album &quot;Cloud Nine&quot; and the pair&#x27;s follow-up (with Roy Orbison, Bob Dylan and Tom Petty as Traveling Wilburys) &quot;Traveling Wilburys Vol. 1&quot; were released.

=== 1989–1999: ELO Part II ===
Bev Bevan (under an agreement with Lynne, who co-owned the ELO name with him) continued on in 1989 as ELO Part II, initially with no other former ELO members, but with ELO&#x27;s main orchestra conductor, Louis Clark. Bevan also recruited Eric Troyer, Pete Haycock, and Neil Lockwood. ELO Part II released their debut album &quot;Electric Light Orchestra Part Two&quot; in May 1991, featuring songs written primarily by Troyer and Haycock. Mik Kaminski, Kelly Groucutt and Hugh McDowell, at the time working in a group called OrKestra, joined the group for their first tour in 1991. While McDowell did not stay, Groucutt and Kaminski became fully-fledged members.

In 1994, after the departure of Haycock and Lockwood, the remaining five members of Part II recorded &quot;Moment of Truth&quot; with their newest member, singer-songwriter and guitarist Phil Bates. This lineup toured up to 1999, following which Bates was replaced by Parthenon Huxley. Bevan retired from the lineup later that year and sold his share of the ELO name to Jeff Lynne in 2000, after Lynne had expressed his dismay that in certain areas the band were billed as &#x27;ELO&#x27;, rather than with &#x27;...Part II&#x27; added, suggesting it was the original outfit. The remaining band members continued after they changed the group&#x27;s name to The Orchestra. In 2001 The Orchestra released their debut (and insofar only) album &quot;No Rewind&quot;. The Orchestra continues to tour, although Kaminski is the sole remaining member of the group to have been a member or affiliate of ELO, following Kelly Groucutt&#x27;s death in 2009 and Louis Clark&#x27;s in 2021.

===2000–2001: Reformation===
Lynne&#x27;s comeback with ELO began in 2000 with the release of a retrospective box set, &quot;Flashback&quot;, containing three CDs of remastered tracks and a handful of out-takes and unfinished works, most notably a new version of ELO&#x27;s only UK number one hit &quot;Xanadu&quot;. In 2001 &quot;Zoom,&quot; ELO&#x27;s first album of new material since 1986, was released. Though billed and marketed as an ELO album, the only returning member other than Lynne was Tandy, who performed on one track. Guest musicians included former Beatles Ringo Starr and George Harrison. Upon completion of the album, Lynne reformed the band with completely new members, including his then-girlfriend Rosie Vela (who had released her own album, &quot;Zazu&quot;, in 1986) and announced that ELO would tour again. Tandy rejoined the band a short time afterwards for two television live performances: &quot;VH1 Storytellers&quot; and a PBS concert shot at CBS Television City, later titled &quot;Zoom Tour Live&quot; and released on DVD. Besides Lynne, Tandy and Vela, the new live ELO lineup included Gregg Bissonette (drums, backing vocals), Matt Bissonette (bass guitar, backing vocals), Marc Mann (guitars, keyboards, backing vocals), Peggy Baldwin (cello), and Sarah O&#x27;Brien (cello). However, the planned tour was cancelled, reportedly due to poor ticket sales.

===2001–2013: Non-performing work, reissues and miniature reunions===

From 2001 to 2007, Harvest and Epic/Legacy reissued ELO&#x27;s back catalogue. Included amongst the remastered album tracks were unreleased songs and outtakes, including two new singles. The first was &quot;Surrender&quot; which registered on the lower end of the UK Singles Chart at number 81, some 30 years after it was written in 1976. The other single was &quot;Latitude 88 North&quot;.

In August 2010, Eagle Rock Entertainment released &quot;Live – The Early Years&quot; in the UK as a DVD compilation that included &quot;Fusion – Live in London&quot; (1976) along with previously unreleased live performances at Brunel University (1973) and on the German TV show &quot;Rockpalast&quot; (1974). &quot;The Essential Electric Light Orchestra&quot; artwork was re-jigged to feature two different covers. The US and Australian releases shared one design, while the rest of the world featured the other for a new double album release in October 2011.

&quot;Mr. Blue Sky: The Very Best of Electric Light Orchestra&quot; was released on 8 October 2012. It is an album of re-recordings of ELO&#x27;s greatest hits, performed by Lynne exclusively, along with a new song titled &quot;Point of No Return&quot;. Released to coincide with Lynne&#x27;s second solo album release &quot;Long Wave,&quot; these new albums contained advertisement cards, announcing the re-release of expanded and remastered versions of both the 2001 album &quot;Zoom&quot; and Lynne&#x27;s debut solo album &quot;Armchair Theatre&quot;, originally released in 1990. Both albums were re-released in April 2013 with various bonus tracks. Also released was the live album, &quot;Electric Light Orchestra Live&quot;, showcasing songs from the Zoom tour. All three releases also featured new studio recordings as bonus tracks.

Though not billed as Electric Light Orchestra (or the abbreviated ELO), in 2012, Lynne and Tandy reunited, largely under Lynne&#x27;s name, to perform stripped-down acoustic versions of their ELO hits for the BBC television special &quot;Jeff Lynne Acoustic: Live from Bungalow Palace&quot;.

Lynne and Tandy reunited again on 12 November 2013 to perform, under the name Jeff Lynne and Friends, &quot;Livin&#x27; Thing&quot; and &quot;Mr. Blue Sky&quot; at the Children in Need Rocks concert at Hammersmith Eventim Apollo, London. The backing orchestra was the BBC Concert Orchestra, with Chereene Allen on lead violin.

===2014–present: Jeff Lynne&#x27;s ELO===
The success of the Children in Need performance was followed by support from BBC Radio 2 DJ Chris Evans, who had Lynne as his on-air guest and asked his listeners if they wanted to see ELO perform. The 50,000 tickets for the resulting BBC Radio 2&#x27;s &quot;Festival in a Day&quot; in Hyde Park on 14 September 2014 sold out in 15 minutes. Billed as &quot;Jeff Lynne&#x27;s ELO&quot;, Lynne and Richard Tandy were backed by the Take That/Gary Barlow band from the Children in Need concert, led by Mike Stevens and the BBC Concert Orchestra. Lynne chose to use the name as a response to ELO offshoots ELO Part II and The Orchestra. Chereene Allen was again the lead violinist for the band. The development of modern digital processing added a smoother finish to the work, which led Lynne to reconsider his preference for studio work, hinting at a UK tour in 2015.

On 8 February 2015, Jeff Lynne&#x27;s ELO played at the Grammy Awards for the first time. They performed a medley of &quot;Evil Woman&quot; and &quot;Mr. Blue Sky&quot; with Ed Sheeran, who introduced them as &quot;A man and a band who I love&quot;.

On 10 September 2015, it was announced that a new ELO album would be released. The album was to be under the moniker of Jeff Lynne&#x27;s ELO, with the band signed to Columbia Records. &quot;Alone in the Universe&quot; was released on 13 November 2015. The album was ELO&#x27;s first album of new material since 2001&#x27;s &quot;Zoom&quot;. The first track, and single, &quot;When I Was a Boy&quot; was made available for streaming on the same day and a music video for the song was also released. A small promotional tour followed the album&#x27;s release which saw Jeff Lynne&#x27;s ELO perform a full concert for &quot;BBC Radio 2&quot; along with their first two shows in the United States in 30 years, both which sold out very quickly. Jeff Lynne&#x27;s ELO also made rare US television appearances on &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon&quot;, &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live&quot; and &quot;CBS This Morning&quot;. A 19-date European tour was announced for 2016, with the band playing the Pyramid Stage at Glastonbury Festival on 26 June 2016.

In 2017 they played their &quot;Alone in the Universe&quot; tour. That same year, on 7 April, they played at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as they were inducted during the 32nd Annual Induction Ceremony.

The band continued to tour in 2018 in North America and Europe. A video was created for the City of Birmingham which used the original recording of &quot;Mr. Blue Sky&quot; as its music; this was played at the Gold Coast 2018 Commonwealth Games Closing Ceremony during the handover presentation of Birmingham 2022.

On 3 August 2018, &quot;Secret Messages&quot; was reissued &quot;as originally conceived&quot; as a double album.

<doc id="10487" wikidata="Q750028" url="?curid=10487" title="Evil Dead II">
<text>Evil Dead II (also known in publicity materials as Evil Dead 2: Dead by Dawn) is a 1987 American comedy horror film directed by Sam Raimi, who co-wrote it with Scott Spiegel. The second installment in the &quot;Evil Dead&quot; film series, it is considered both a remake and sequel (or &quot;requel&quot;) to &quot;The Evil Dead&quot; (1981). It stars Bruce Campbell as Ash Williams, who vacations with his girlfriend to a remote cabin in the woods. He discovers an audio tape of recitations from a book of ancient texts, and when the recording is played, it unleashes a number of demons which possess and torment him.

After the critical and commercial failure of &quot;Crimewave&quot; (1985), Raimi, producer Robert Tapert, and Campbell began work on a sequel to &quot;The Evil Dead&quot; at the insistence of their publicist Irvin Shapiro. Having endorsed the original film, author Stephen King brought the project to the attention of producer Dino De Laurentiis, with whom he had been making his directorial debut &quot;Maximum Overdrive&quot; (1986). De Laurentiis agreed to provide financial backing, and assigned the filmmakers a considerably larger budget than they had worked with on the original film. Although Raimi had devised a premise set in the Middle Ages and involving time travel, De Laurentiis requested that the film be similar to its predecessor.

&quot;Evil Dead II&quot; was shot in Wadesboro, North Carolina and Detroit, Michigan in 1986, and featured extensive stop-motion animation and prosthetic makeup effects created by a team of artists that included Mark Shostrom, Greg Nicotero, Robert Kurtzman and Tom Sullivan, the latter of whom returned from the original film. The finished film was released in the United States on March 13, 1987; due to its high level of violence, it was released through a pseudonymous distributor to curb an anticipated X rating from the Motion Picture Association of America. Much like &quot;The Evil Dead&quot;, it was widely acclaimed by critics, who praised its humor, Raimi&#x27;s direction, and Campbell&#x27;s performance; many have considered it superior to its predecessor and similarly as one of the greatest horror films ever made. Despite being given a somewhat limited release, it was a minor box office success, grossing just under $6 million.

As with the first film, &quot;Evil Dead II&quot; has accumulated a large, international cult following. In 1992, it was followed by the direct sequel &quot;Army of Darkness&quot;, which utilized Raimi&#x27;s original premise; in 2013, it was followed by the soft reboot and continuation &quot;Evil Dead&quot;; and in 2015, it was followed by the television series &quot;Ash vs Evil Dead&quot;. A fifth film in the series, &quot;Evil Dead Rise&quot;, was released on April 21, 2023.

==Plot==

Michigan State University students Ash Williams and his girlfriend, Linda, take a romantic getaway to a seemingly abandoned cabin in the woods. While in it, Ash plays a tape of archaeologist Raymond Knowby, the cabin&#x27;s previous inhabitant, reciting passages from the &quot;Book of the Dead&quot;, &quot;Necronomicon Ex-Mortis&quot;, which he uncovered during an archaeological dig. The recorded incantation unleashes an unseen evil force, known as the Kandarian Demon, that kills and possesses Linda, turning her into a &quot;deadite&quot;. Ash decapitates Linda with a shovel and buries her in a shallow grave near the cabin. As dawn approaches, the evil force throws Ash through the woods. He briefly becomes possessed by the demon, but the sunlight expels it from him.

Ash attempts to flee the area but finds that the bridge to the cabin has been destroyed. The entity chases him back to the cabin, where Linda&#x27;s revived head bites his hand. He runs to the toolshed and destroys the deadite Linda with a chainsaw, but his bitten right hand becomes possessed and tries to kill him. Ash severs it with the chainsaw and tries to shoot it with a shotgun, but the hand mocks him and escapes. Meanwhile, Knowby&#x27;s daughter Annie and her research partner, Ed Getley, return from the dig with the missing pages of the &quot;Necronomicon&quot;. Blocked by the destroyed bridge, they enlist handyman Jake and his girlfriend Bobby Joe to lead them to the cabin on foot. There they find an embattled Ash, who accidentally grazes Bobby Joe while trying to shoot his possessed hand. Assuming that he murdered Annie&#x27;s parents, the newcomers lock him in the cellar.

The four new arrivals listen to the rest of the tape recording, where Knowby explains that he killed his wife Henrietta after she was possessed by the Kandarian Demon, then buried her in the cellar. The deadite Henrietta bursts from her grave and possesses Ed, whom Ash, now freed from the cellar, dismembers with an axe. Bobby Joe flees through the woods when Ash&#x27;s severed hand latches onto hers, but demonically possessed trees drag her to her death. Annie translates two of the &quot;Necronomicon&quot;″s pages, which portray a fabled hero with a blade for a hand and detail a ritual that will make the evil take physical form and then open a portal through which it may be banished. Before they can perform the ritual, Jake turns on them and throws the pages into the cellar, forcing them at gunpoint to locate Bobby Joe. In the woods, Ash becomes possessed once more and attacks Jake. Annie retreats to the cabin and accidentally stabs Jake with a Kandarian dagger, mistaking him for the possessed Ash, before Henrietta kills him. Deadite Ash tries to kill Annie, but returns to his normal self upon seeing Linda&#x27;s necklace.

With Annie&#x27;s help, Ash modifies the chainsaw, attaches it to the stump of his right arm, and cuts the shotgun&#x27;s barrel. After finding the missing pages of the &quot;Necronomicon&quot; in the cellar, Ash kills Henrietta. Annie starts reciting the incantation, which makes the demon physically manifest and attack Ash. As she attempts to finish the incantation, Ash&#x27;s severed hand stabs her in the back. Annie completes the ritual with her dying breath, opening up a whirling temporal vortex which sucks in not only the demon, but also Ash and his Oldsmobile Delta 88.

Ash and his Oldsmobile land in the Middle Ages. A group of knights confront him and initially mistake him for a deadite, but when a real harpy-like deadite appears and Ash blasts it with his shotgun, they hail him as their champion. Realizing that he is the hero prophesied in the book, Ash breaks down and screams in dismay.

===Development===
The concept of a sequel to &quot;The Evil Dead&quot; was discussed during location shooting on the first film. Irvin Shapiro, the film&#x27;s publicist, pushed writer/director Sam Raimi to devise a premise for such a film. Working with screenwriter Sheldon Lettich, Raimi settled on a story in which Ash was sucked through a time portal to the Middle Ages, where he would encounter more deadites. Shapiro was enticed by the concept, and took out advertisements in trade magazines to promote the project, then titled &quot;Evil Dead II: Evil Dead and the Army of Darkness&quot;, in May 1984. After Universal Pictures and 20th Century Fox passed on it, the sequel was shelved in favor of Raimi&#x27;s next film, &quot;Crimewave&quot; (1985), a comedy/crime film co-written with Joel and Ethan Coen.

After &quot;Crimewave&quot; was released to critical and audience disinterest, Raimi and his partners at Renaissance Pictures, producer Robert Tapert and actor/co-producer Bruce Campbell, took Shapiro up on his sequel offer, knowing that another flop would further stall their already-lagging careers. Development of &quot;Evil Dead II&quot; initially began in collaboration with Embassy Pictures, which had co-financed and distributed &quot;Crimewave&quot;, but the filmmakers eventually felt that they were being stalled after five months&#x27; pre-production work, and began conducting interviews with prospective cast and crew members. Around this time, producer Dino De Laurentiis, the owner of production and distribution company De Laurentiis Entertainment Group (DEG), asked Raimi if he would be interested in directing an adaptation of the Stephen King novel &quot;Thinner&quot;. Raimi turned down the offer, but De Laurentiis remained in touch with the young filmmaker.

The &quot;Thinner&quot; adaptation was part of a deal between De Laurentiis and King to produce several adaptations of King&#x27;s successful horror novels and short stories. At the time, King was directing the first such adaptation, &quot;Maximum Overdrive&quot; (1986), based on his short story &quot;Trucks&quot;. He had dinner with a crew member who had been among those interviewed by Raimi and his colleagues about &quot;Evil Dead II&quot;, and told King that the film was having trouble attracting funding. Upon hearing this, King, who had written a glowing review of the first film that helped it become an audience favorite at Cannes, called De Laurentiis and asked him to fund the film. While he was initially skeptical, De Laurentiis met with Renaissance, who highlighted the first film&#x27;s extremely high revenue in the Italian market. Within twenty minutes, De Laurentiis agreed to finance &quot;Evil Dead II&quot; for $3.6 million. Raimi and Tapert had desired $4 million for the production, but De Laurentiis requested a film that was similar to its predecessor instead of their original medieval-themed proposal, which was instead used for the second sequel, &quot;Army of Darkness&quot; (1992).

===Writing===
Despite Raimi&#x27;s crew having only recently received the funding necessary to produce the film, the script had been written for some time, having been composed largely during the production of &quot;Crimewave&quot;. Raimi contacted his old friend Scott Spiegel, who had collaborated with Campbell and others on the Super 8 mm films they had produced during their childhood in Michigan. Most of these films had been comedies, and Spiegel felt that &quot;Evil Dead II&quot; should be less straight horror than the first. Initially, the opening sequence included all five of the original film&#x27;s characters; however, in an effort to save time and money, all but Ash and Linda were cut from the final draft. The film went through several other drafts, including a group of escaped convicts holding Ash captive in the cabin while searching for buried treasure.

Spiegel and Raimi wrote most of the film in their house in Silver Lake, Los Angeles, California, where they were living with the aforementioned Coen brothers, as well as actors Frances McDormand, Kathy Bates, and Holly Hunter (the primary inspiration for the Bobby Joe character). Due both to the distractions of their house guests and the films they were involved with, &quot;Crimewave&quot; and Josh Becker&#x27;s &quot;Thou Shalt Not Kill... Except&quot;, the script took a long time to finish.

Among the film&#x27;s many inspirations include the Three Stooges and slapstick comedy films. Ash&#x27;s fights with his disembodied hand come from a film made by Spiegel as a teenager titled &quot;Attack of the Helping Hand&quot;, which was itself inspired by television commercials advertising Hamburger Helper. The &quot;laughing room&quot; scene, where all the objects in the room seemingly come to life and begin to cackle maniacally along with Ash, came about after Spiegel jokingly used a gooseneck lamp to visually demonstrate a Popeye-esque laugh. Spiegel&#x27;s humorous influence can be seen throughout the film, perhaps most prominently in certain visual jokes. For instance, when Ash traps his rogue hand under a pile of books, on top is &quot;A Farewell to Arms&quot;.

While Raimi and Campbell have stated that &quot;Evil Dead II&quot; was intended as a direct sequel, there are differences between the first installment and the recap at the beginning of the second: for example, the Necronomicon is destroyed in a fire by Ash during the conclusion of &quot;The Evil Dead&quot;, but remains intact in &quot;Evil Dead II&quot;. The corpses of Ash&#x27;s friends from the first are absent, and are never mentioned. The cabin itself remains perfectly intact until the events of this film, despite much of it having been destroyed in the original film.

===Filming===
With the script completed and a production company secured, principal photography began on &quot;Evil Dead II&quot;. The production commenced in Wadesboro, North Carolina, not far from De Laurentiis&#x27; offices in Wilmington. De Laurentiis had wanted them to film in his elaborate Wilmington studio, but the production team felt uneasy being so close to the producer, so they moved to Wadesboro, approximately three hours away. Steven Spielberg had previously filmed &quot;The Color Purple&quot; in Wadesboro, and the large white farmhouse used as an exterior location in that film became the production office for &quot;Evil Dead II&quot;. Most of the film was shot in the woods near that farmhouse, or J.R. Faison Junior High School, where the interior cabin set was located.

Mark Shostrom served as the film&#x27;s makeup effects supervisor, and delegated work to Robert Kurtzman, Greg Nicotero, and Howard Berger of KNB EFX Group. The shot of undead Henrietta&#x27;s flying eyeball was accomplished using a ping pong ball provided and painted by KNB EFX. Effects artist Verne Hyde, who joined the North Carolina unit in 1986 after filming had already begun, experimented with various rigs in order to achieve the effect Raimi desired. It was ultimately achieved by mounting the eyeball on a small, spinning motor, attached to a wand bolted directly onto the camera.

Ted Raimi, director Sam&#x27;s younger brother, had been briefly involved in the first film, acting as a fake Shemp. However, in &quot;Evil Dead II&quot;, he plays a larger role as the undead Henrietta. Raimi wore a full-body, latex costume, and was also made to crouch in a small hole in the floor acting as a &quot;cellar&quot;; on one day, he did both. Raimi became extremely overheated to the point that his costume was filled with liters of sweat; Nicotero describes pouring the fluid into several Dixie cups so as to get it out of the costume. The sweat is also visible on-screen, dripping out of the costume&#x27;s ear, in the scene where Henrietta spins around over Annie&#x27;s head.

For Ash&#x27;s chainsaw hand, effects artist Verne Hyde modified a real chainsaw, replacing its gasoline engine with a small, 12-volt electric motor, leaving space for Campbell to insert his hand into the body of the saw. The teeth of the saw were filed down for safety purposes, and tobacco smoke was pumped through a plastic tube that ran up Campbell&#x27;s leg to simulate chainsaw smoke.

The crew sneaked various in-jokes into the film itself, such as the clawed glove of Freddy Krueger (the primary antagonist of Wes Craven&#x27;s &quot;A Nightmare on Elm Street&quot; series of slasher films) which hangs in the cabin&#x27;s basement and tool shed. This was, at least partially, a reference to a scene in the original &quot;A Nightmare on Elm Street&quot;, where the character Nancy Thompson (portrayed by Heather Langenkamp) dozes off watching the original &quot;Evil Dead&quot; on a television set in her room. In turn, that scene was a reference to the torn &quot;The Hills Have Eyes&quot; poster seen in the original &quot;Evil Dead&quot; film, which was itself a reference to a torn &quot;Jaws&quot; poster in &quot;The Hills Have Eyes&quot;. The real life clawed glove appearing in &quot;Evil Dead II&quot; has been attributed to Shostrom, who was also working on &quot;A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors&quot; at around the same time as &quot;Evil Dead II&quot;, suggesting he borrowed it from the &quot;Dream Warriors&quot; set for a day. The rat seen in the cellar was nicknamed &quot;Señor Cojones&quot; by the crew (&quot;cojones&quot; is Spanish slang for &quot;testicles&quot;).

At the film&#x27;s wrap party, the crew held a talent contest where Raimi and Campbell sang the Byrds&#x27; &quot;Eight Miles High&quot;, with Nicotero on guitar.

==Music==
The score was composed by Joseph LoDuca, who also composed the other two scores in the &quot;Evil Dead&quot; trilogy. In 2017, Waxwork Records released the soundtrack on vinyl for the film&#x27;s 30th anniversary.

==Release==
===Pre-release===
Like the original film, &quot;Evil Dead II&quot; had censorship difficulties due to its high level of violence. Because DEG was a member of the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA), Raimi was contractually obliged to shoot the film with the intention of it earning an R rating. Upon reviewing the completed film, DEG&#x27;s executives felt that &quot;Evil Dead II&quot; would almost certainly receive an X rating, which would limit its commercial prospects. Lawrence Gleason, the company&#x27;s president of marketing and distribution, felt that if it were to be cut for an R, the film &quot;would have been about 62 minutes long&quot; and that both Raimi&#x27;s vision and the audience&#x27;s enjoyment would have been sabotaged as a result.

Ultimately, DEG decided not to submit &quot;Evil Dead II&quot; to the MPAA for review or be credited onscreen for their involvement in it. Instead, Rosebud Releasing Corporation, a shell company run by De Laurentiis&#x27; son-in-law Alex De Benedetti, was set up to handle the film&#x27;s US release, allowing it to be shown unrated. Although Rosebud technically did not have a distribution network, DEG had already booked the film in 340 cinemas across the country, and had created and paid for the film&#x27;s advertising campaign. Rosebud&#x27;s logo, a rose blooming in time-lapse photography against a painted sky backdrop, was designed and shot by Raimi himself.

===Home media===
The film was released on VHS by Vestron Video in 1987. Another VHS release came from Anchor Bay Entertainment on February 17, 1998. In a similar fashion to the first &quot;Evil Dead&quot; film and &quot;Army of Darkness&quot;, there have been numerous DVD releases of &quot;Evil Dead II&quot;. The film was released on DVD by Anchor Bay on August 29, 2000, in the form of a limited edition tin, and was re-released by Anchor Bay on September 27, 2005, designed to resemble the &quot;Necronomicon&quot;. On October 2, 2007, the film was released on Blu-ray, and on November 15, 2011, it was re-released on Blu-ray and DVD by Lionsgate Home Entertainment for its 25th anniversary. On September 13, 2016, the film was re-released on Blu-ray by Lionsgate. A 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray version of the film was released on December 11, 2018.

The film was released on DVD in the United Kingdom in 2003 as part of a region 2 &quot;Evil Dead&quot; trilogy box set. In 2013, the trilogy saw another UK release on Blu-ray, released by StudioCanal. A 25th Anniversary Wood Edition was released in Germany by StudioCanal in 2007. The film was released on Blu-ray in Australia in 2014, alongside &quot;The Evil Dead&quot;, &quot;Army of Darkness&quot;, and the 2013 reboot, as part of an &quot;Evil Dead&quot; Anthology box set. The film has been released together with the first &quot;Evil Dead&quot; film by Green Nara Media in South Korea in region A.

==Reception==
===Box office===
&quot;Evil Dead II&quot; opened on March 13, 1987, to an unimpressive weekend gross of $807,260, due to its limited release in 310 theaters at the time. However, after spending a little over a month in theaters, it ultimately grossed $5,924,421 worldwide.

===Critical response===
 &quot;Empire&quot; magazine praised the film, saying &quot;the gaudily gory, virtuoso, hyper-kinetic horror sequel uses every trick in the cinematic book&quot; and confirms that &quot;Bruce Campbell and Raimi are gods&quot;. Caryn James of &quot;The New York Times&quot; called it &quot;genuine, if bizarre, proof of Sam Raimi&#x27;s talent and developing skill.&quot; Leonard Maltin originally rated the film with two stars, but later increased the rating to three stars.

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film three stars out of four, describing it as &quot;a fairly sophisticated satire, that makes you want to get up and shuffle.&quot; He praised the film&#x27;s sense of surrealism, comedic timing, and &quot;grubby, low-budget intensity.&quot; Ebert states that &quot;if you know it&#x27;s all special effects, and if you&#x27;ve seen a lot of other movies and have a sense of humor, you might have a great time at &quot;Evil Dead 2&quot;.&quot; Richard Harrington of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrapped up his review stating that &quot;the acting is straight out of &#x27;50s B-movies. The exposition is clumsy, the sound track corny, the denouement silly. Then again, who said bad taste was easy?&quot; Conversely, Pat Graham of &quot;Chicago Reader&quot; disliked the mix of horror and comedy, writing in his review that &quot;the pop-up humor and smirkiness suggest Raimi&#x27;s aspiring to the fashionable company of the brothers Coen, though on the basis of this strained effort I&#x27;d say he&#x27;s overshot the mark.&quot;

&quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; ranked the film #19 on their list of the &quot;Top 50 Cult Films&quot;.

&quot;Sight and Sound&quot; ranked it #34 on their 50 Funniest Films of All Time list. In 2008, &quot;Empire&quot; magazine included &quot;Evil Dead II&quot; on their list of &quot;The 500 Greatest Movies of All Time&quot;, ranked #49.

J.C. Maçek III of &quot;PopMatters&quot; wrote, &quot;Equal parts remake and sequel, the second film brought back Bruce Campbell as Ash and was every bit as gory and horrific as the first film with more tree rape and dismemberment and blood splatters than ever. On the other hand, &quot;Evil Dead II&quot; is also an absolutely hilarious and uproarious intentional comedy.&quot;

In 2016, James Charisma of &quot;Playboy&quot; ranked the film #12 on a list of &quot;15 Sequels That Are Way Better Than The Originals&quot;.

===Accolades===
==In popular culture==
&quot;The Elvis Dead&quot;, an English comic stage show, retells &quot;Evil Dead II&quot; in the style of Elvis Presley.

The 1993 hit first-person shooter video game &quot;Doom&quot; was inspired by &quot;Evil Dead II&quot;. The game&#x27;s programmer John Carmack came up with the game&#x27;s concept about using technology to fight demons, inspired by the &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; campaigns the team played, combining the styles of &quot;Evil Dead II&quot; and &quot;Aliens&quot;.

The 1991 hit song &quot;People Are Still Having Sex&quot; by LaTour contains a dialogue sample of the, &quot;... hello lover!&quot; line from the film.

The 2023 music video for &quot;Bogus Operandi&quot; by The Hives is heavily inspired by &quot;Evil Dead II&quot;. The music video features a demonic tape, forest point-of-view shots, and white eyed zombies.

<text>Edwin Powell Hubble (November 20, 1889 – September 28, 1953) was an American astronomer. He played a crucial role in establishing the fields of extragalactic astronomy and observational cosmology.

Hubble proved that many objects previously thought to be clouds of dust and gas and classified as &quot;nebulae&quot; were actually galaxies beyond the Milky Way. He used the strong direct relationship between a classical Cepheid variable&#x27;s luminosity and pulsation period (discovered in 1908 by Henrietta Swan Leavitt) for scaling galactic and extragalactic distances.

Hubble confirmed in 1929 that the recessional velocity of a galaxy increases with its distance from Earth, a behavior that became known as Hubble&#x27;s law, although it had been proposed two years earlier by Georges Lemaître. The Hubble law implies that the universe is expanding. A decade before, the American astronomer Vesto Slipher had provided the first evidence that the light from many of these nebulae was strongly red-shifted, indicative of high recession velocities.

Hubble&#x27;s name is most widely recognized for the Hubble Space Telescope, which was named in his honor, with a model prominently displayed in his hometown of Marshfield, Missouri.

== Early life and education ==
Edwin Hubble was born in 1889 to Virginia Lee Hubble (née James) (1864–1934) and John Powell Hubble, an insurance executive, in Marshfield, Missouri, and moved to Wheaton, Illinois, in 1900. In his younger days, he was noted more for his athletic prowess than his intellectual abilities, although he did earn good grades in every subject except spelling. Edwin was a gifted athlete, playing baseball, football, and running track in both high school and college. He won seven first places and a third place in a single high school track and field meet in 1906, and he played a variety of positions on the basketball court, from center to shooting guard. Hubble led the University of Chicago&#x27;s basketball team to their first Big Ten Conference title in 1907.

===Undergraduate studies===
Hubble&#x27;s studies at the University of Chicago were concentrated on mathematics, astronomy and philosophy, which resulted in a Bachelor of Science degree by 1910. For a year he was also a student laboratory assistant for the physicist Robert Millikan, a future Nobel Prize winner. Hubble also became a member of Kappa Sigma fraternity. A Rhodes Scholar, he spent three years at The Queen&#x27;s College, Oxford studying jurisprudence instead of science (as a promise to his dying father), and later added studies in literature and Spanish, eventually earning his master&#x27;s degree.

In 1909, Hubble&#x27;s father moved his family from Chicago to Shelbyville, Kentucky, so that the family could live in a small town, ultimately settling in nearby Louisville. His father died in the winter of 1913, while Edwin was still in England. In the following summer, Edwin returned home to care for his mother, two sisters, and younger brother, along with his brother William. The family moved once more to Everett Avenue, in Louisville&#x27;s Highlands neighborhood, to accommodate Edwin and William.

Hubble was a dutiful son, who despite his intense interest in astronomy since boyhood, acquiesced to his father&#x27;s request to study law, first at the University of Chicago and later at Oxford. In this time, he also took some math and science courses. After the death of his father in 1913, Edwin returned to the Midwest from Oxford but did not have the motivation to practice law. Instead, he proceeded to teach Spanish, physics and mathematics at New Albany High School in New Albany, Indiana, where he also coached the boys&#x27; basketball team. After a year of high-school teaching, he entered graduate school with the help of his former professor from the University of Chicago to study astronomy at the university&#x27;s Yerkes Observatory, where he received his Ph.D. in 1921. His dissertation was titled &quot;Photographic Investigations of Faint Nebulae&quot;. At Yerkes, he had access to its 40-inch refractor built in 1897, as well as an innovative 26-inch (61 cm) reflector.

===Doctoral studies===

After the United States declared war on Germany in 1917 during World War I, Hubble rushed to complete his Ph.D. dissertation so he could join the military. Hubble volunteered for the United States Army and was assigned to the newly created 86th Division, where he served in the 2nd Battalion, 343rd Infantry Regiment. He rose to the rank of major, and was found fit for overseas duty on July 9, 1918; the 86th Division moved overseas, but never saw combat as it was broken up and its personnel used as replacements in other units. After the end of World War I, Hubble spent a year at University of Cambridge, where he renewed his studies of astronomy.

==Career==
In 1919, Hubble was offered a staff position at the Carnegie Institution for Science&#x27;s Mount Wilson Observatory, near Pasadena, California, by George Ellery Hale, the founder and director of the observatory. Hubble remained on staff at Mount Wilson until his death in 1953. Shortly before his death, Hubble became the first astronomer to use the newly completed giant reflector Hale Telescope at the Palomar Observatory near San Diego, California.

Hubble also worked as a civilian for United States Army at Aberdeen Proving Ground in Maryland during World War II as the Chief of the External Ballistics Branch of the Ballistic Research Laboratory during which he directed a large volume of research in exterior ballistics which increased the effective firepower of bombs and projectiles. His work was facilitated by his personal development of several items of equipment for the instrumentation used in exterior ballistics, the most outstanding development being the high-speed clock camera, which made possible the study of the characteristics of bombs and low-velocity projectiles in flight. The results of his studies were credited with greatly improving design, performance, and military effectiveness of bombs and rockets. For his work there, he received the Legion of Merit award.

==Discoveries==
===Universe goes beyond the Milky Way galaxy===

Edwin Hubble&#x27;s arrival at Mount Wilson Observatory, California, in 1919 coincided roughly with the completion of the Hooker Telescope, then the world&#x27;s largest. At that time, the prevailing view of the cosmos was that the universe consisted entirely of the Milky Way galaxy.

Using the Hooker Telescope at Mount Wilson, Hubble identified Cepheid variables, a standard candle discovered by Henrietta Swan Leavitt. Comparing their apparent luminosity to their intrinsic luminosity gives their distance from Earth. Hubble found Cepheids in several nebulae, including the Andromeda Nebula and Triangulum Nebula. His observations, made in 1924, proved conclusively that these nebulae were much too distant to be part of the Milky Way and were, in fact, entire galaxies outside our own; thus today they are no longer considered nebulae.

This was first hypothesized as early as 1755 when Immanuel Kant&#x27;s &quot;General History of Nature and Theory of the Heavens&quot; appeared. Hubble&#x27;s hypothesis was opposed by many in the astronomy establishment of the time, in particular by Harvard Universitybased Harlow Shapley. Despite the opposition, Hubble, then a thirty-five-year-old scientist, had his findings first published in &quot;The New York Times&quot; on , 1924, then presented them to other astronomers at the January 1, 1925, meeting of the American Astronomical Society. Hubble&#x27;s results for Andromeda were not formally published in a peer-reviewed scientific journal until 1929.
Hubble&#x27;s findings fundamentally changed the scientific view of the universe. Supporters state that Hubble&#x27;s discovery of nebulae outside of our galaxy helped pave the way for future astronomers. Although some of his more renowned colleagues simply scoffed at his results, Hubble ended up publishing his findings on nebulae. This published work earned him an award titled the American Association Prize and five hundred dollars from Burton E. Livingston of the Committee on Awards.

Hubble also devised the most commonly used system for classifying galaxies, grouping them according to their appearance in photographic images. He arranged the different groups of galaxies in what became known as the Hubble sequence.

===Redshift increases with distance===
Hubble went on to estimate the distances to 24 extra-galactic nebulae, using a variety of methods. In 1929 Hubble examined the relationship between these distances and their radial velocities as determined from their redshifts. All of his estimated distances are now known to be too small, by up to a factor of about 7. This was due to factors such as the fact that there are two kinds of Cepheid variables or confusing bright gas clouds with bright stars. However, his distances were more or less proportional to the true distances, and combining his distances with measurements of the redshifts of the galaxies by Vesto Slipher, and by his assistant Milton L. Humason, he found a roughly linear relationship between the distances of the galaxies and their radial velocities (corrected for solar motion), a discovery that later became known as Hubble&#x27;s law.

This meant that the greater the distance between any two galaxies, the greater their relative speed of separation. If interpreted that way, Hubble&#x27;s measurements on 46 galaxies lead to a value for the Hubble constant of 500 km/s/Mpc, which is much higher than the currently accepted values of 74 km/s/Mpc (cosmic distance ladder method) or 68 km/s/Mpc (CMB method) due to errors in their distance calibrations.

Yet the reason for the redshift remained unclear. Georges Lemaître predicted on theoretical grounds based on Einstein&#x27;s equations for general relativity the redshift-distance relation, and published observational support for it, two years before the discovery of Hubble&#x27;s law. Although he used the term &quot;velocities&quot; in his paper (and &quot;apparent radial velocities&quot; in the introduction), he later expressed doubt about interpreting these as real velocities. In 1931 he wrote a letter to the Dutch cosmologist Willem de Sitter expressing his opinion on the theoretical interpretation of the redshift-distance relation:

Today, the &quot;apparent velocities&quot; in question are usually thought of as an increase in proper distance that occurs due to the expansion of the universe. Light traveling through an expanding metric will experience a Hubble-type redshift, a mechanism somewhat different from the Doppler effect, although the two mechanisms become equivalent descriptions related by a coordinate transformation for nearby galaxies.

In the 1930s, Hubble was involved in determining the distribution of galaxies and spatial curvature. These data seemed to indicate that the universe was flat and homogeneous, but there was a deviation from flatness at large redshifts. According to Allan Sandage,
There were methodological problems with Hubble&#x27;s survey technique that showed a deviation from flatness at large redshifts. In particular, the technique did not account for changes in luminosity of galaxies due to galaxy evolution. Earlier, in 1917, Albert Einstein had found that his newly developed theory of general relativity indicated that the universe must be either expanding or contracting. Unable to believe what his own equations were telling him, Einstein introduced a cosmological constant (a &quot;&quot;) to the equations to avoid this &quot;problem&quot;. When Einstein learned of Hubble&#x27;s redshifts, he immediately realized that the expansion predicted by general relativity must be real, and in later life, he said that changing his equations was &quot;the biggest blunder of [his] life&quot;. In fact, Einstein apparently once visited Hubble and tried to convince him that the universe was expanding.

Hubble also discovered the asteroid 1373 Cincinnati on August 30, 1935. In 1936 he wrote &quot;The Observational Approach to Cosmology&quot; and &quot;The Realm of the Nebulae&quot; which explained his approaches to extra-galactic astronomy and his view of the subject&#x27;s history.

In December 1941, Hubble reported to the American Association for the Advancement of Science that results from a six-year survey with the Mt. Wilson telescope did not support the expanding universe theory. According to a &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; article reporting on Hubble&#x27;s remarks, &quot;The nebulae could not be uniformly distributed, as the telescope shows they are, and still fit the explosion idea. Explanations which try to get around what the great telescope sees, he said, fail to stand up. The explosion, for example, would have had to start long after the earth was created, and possibly even after the first life appeared here.&quot; (Hubble&#x27;s estimate of what we now call the Hubble constant would put the Big Bang only 2 billion years ago.)

==Personal life==
Hubble married Grace Lillian (Burke) Leib (1889–1980), daughter of John Patrick and Luella (Kepford) Burke, on February 26, 1924.

Hubble was raised as a Protestant Christian, but some of his later statements suggest uncertainty.

===Health issues and death===
Hubble had a heart attack in July 1949 while on vacation in Colorado. He was cared for by his wife and continued on a modified diet and work schedule. He died of cerebral thrombosis (a blood clot in his brain) on September 28, 1953, in San Marino, California. No funeral was held for him, and his wife never revealed his burial site.

Hubble&#x27;s papers comprising the bulk of his correspondence, photographs, notebooks, observing logbooks, and other materials, are held by the Huntington Library in San Marino, California. They were donated by his wife Grace Burke Hubble upon her death in 1980.

==Controversies==
===Accusations concerning Lemaître&#x27;s priority===
In 2011, the journal &quot;Nature&quot; reported claims that Hubble might have played a role in the redaction of key parts of the 1931 English translation of Lemaître&#x27;s 1927 paper, which formulated what was later called Hubble&#x27;s law and also gave observational evidence. Historians quoted in the article were skeptical that the redactions were part of a campaign to ensure Hubble retained priority. However, the observational astronomer Sidney van den Bergh published a paper suggesting that while the omissions may have been made by a translator, they may still have been deliberate.

In November 2011, the astronomer Mario Livio reported in &quot;Nature&quot; that a letter he found in the Lemaître archive demonstrated that the redaction had been made by Lemaître himself, who apparently saw no point in publishing scientific content which had already been reported in 1929 by Hubble. However, the fact remains that Lemaître published the law in French, two years prior to Hubble.

===Campaign to obtain a Nobel Prize===

During Hubble&#x27;s life the Nobel Prize in Physics did not cover work done in astronomy. Hubble spent much of the later part of his career attempting to have astronomy considered part of physics, instead of being a separate science. He did this largely so that astronomers—including himself—could be recognized by the Nobel Committee for their valuable contributions to astrophysics. This campaign was unsuccessful in Hubble&#x27;s lifetime, but shortly after his death, the Nobel Prize Committee decided that astronomical work would be eligible for the physics prize. However, the Nobel prize is not awarded posthumously.

<doc id="10490" wikidata="Q349271" url="?curid=10490" title="Emperor Ninmyō">
<text>was the 54th emperor of Japan, according to the traditional order of succession. Ninmyō&#x27;s reign lasted from 833 to 850, during the Heian period.

==Traditional narrative==
Ninmyō was the second son of Emperor Saga and the Empress Tachibana no Kachiko. His personal name (&quot;imina&quot;) was . After his death, he was given the title .

Ninmyō had nine Empresses, Imperial consorts, and concubines (&quot;kōi&quot;); and the emperor had 24 Imperial sons and daughters.

Emperor Ninmyō is traditionally venerated at his tomb; the Imperial Household Agency designates , in Fushimi-ku, Kyoto, as the location of Ninmyō&#x27;s mausoleum.

===Events of Ninmyō&#x27;s life===
Ninmyō ascended to the throne following the abdication of his uncle, Emperor Junna.

* 6 January 823 (): Received the title of Crown Prince at the age of 14.
* 22 March 833 (): In the 10th year of Emperor Junna&#x27;s reign, the emperor abdicated; and the succession (&quot;senso&quot;) was received by his adopted son. Masara&quot;-shinnō&quot; was the natural son of Emperor Saga, and therefore would have been Junna&#x27;s nephew. Shortly thereafter, Emperor Ninmyo is said to have acceded to the throne (&quot;sokui&quot;).

Shortly after Ninmyo was enthroned, he designated an heir. He named Prince Tsunesada, a son of former Emperor Junna, as the crown prince.

* 835 (): Kūkai (known posthumously as Kōbō-Daishi) died. This monk, scholar, poet, and artist had been the founder of the Shingon or &quot;True Word&quot; school of Buddhism.
* 838-839 (&quot;Jōwa 5-6&quot;): Diplomatic mission to Tang China headed by Fujiwara no Tsunetsugu.
*842: Following a coup d&#x27;état called the Jōwa Incident, Tsunesada the crown prince was replaced with Ninmyō&#x27;s first son, Prince Michiyasu (later Emperor Montoku) whose mother was the Empress Fujiwara no Junshi, a daughter of &quot;sadaijin&quot; Fujiwara no Fuyutsugu. It is supposed that this was the result of political intrigue planned by Ninmyō and Fujiwara no Yoshifusa. The first of what would become a powerful line of Fujiwara regents, Yoshifusa had numerous family ties to the imperial court; he was Ninmyō&#x27;s brother in law (by virtue of his sister who became Ninmyō&#x27;s consort), the second son of &quot;sadaijin&quot; Fuyutsugu, and uncle to the new crown prince.

In his lifetime, Ninmyō could not have anticipated that his third son, Prince Tokiyasu, would eventually ascend the throne in 884 as Emperor Kōkō.

* 6 May 850 (&quot;): Emperor Ninmyō died at the age of 41. He was sometimes posthumously referred to as &quot;the Emperor of Fukakusa&quot;, because that was the name given to his tomb.

===Eras of Ninmyō&#x27;s reign===
The years of Ninmyō&#x27;s reign are more specifically identified by more than one era name (&quot;nengō&quot;).
* &quot;Tenchō&quot; (824–834)
* &quot;Jōwa&quot; (834–848)
* &quot;Kashō&quot; (848–851)

==Kugyō==
 is a collective term for the very few most powerful men attached to the court of the Emperor of Japan in pre-Meiji eras.

In general, this elite group included only three to four men at a time. These were hereditary courtiers whose experience and background would have brought them to the pinnacle of a life&#x27;s career. During Ninmyō&#x27;s reign, this apex of the &quot;Daijō-kan&quot; included:

<text>(August 827 – 7 October 858) was the 55th emperor of Japan, according to the traditional order of succession.

Montoku&#x27;s reign lasted from 850 to 858.

==Traditional narrative==
Before Montoku&#x27;s ascension to the Chrysanthemum Throne, his personal name (&quot;imina&quot;) was . He was also known as &quot;Tamura-no-mikado&quot; or &quot;Tamura-tei&quot;.

He was the eldest son of Emperor Ninmyō. His mother was Empress Dowager Fujiwara no Junshi (also called the Gojō empress 五条后), daughter of the minister of the left, Fujiwara no Fuyutsugu.

Montoku had six Imperial consorts and 29 Imperial children.

==Events of Montoku&#x27;s life==
* 6 May 850 (&quot;Kashō 3, 21st day of the 3rd month&quot;): In the 17th year of Ninmyō&quot;-tennō&quot;″s reign (仁明天皇十七年), the emperor died; and his eldest son received the succession (&quot;senso&quot;).
* 850 (&quot;Kashō 3, 4th month&quot;): Emperor Montoku formally acceded to the throne (&quot;sokui&quot;).
* 850 (&quot;Kashō 3, 5th month&quot;): The widow of Emperor Saga, who was also the mother of Emperor Ninmyō and the grandmother of Emperor Montoku, died. This very devout Buddhist had founded a temple called on the site of present-day – more formally known as , located in what is now Susukinobaba-chō, Ukyō Ward in Kyoto, Before her death, the former empress had been known by the honorific title, ; and she had been honored as if she were a saint.
* 850 (&quot;Kashō 3, 11th month&quot;): The emperor named Korehito&quot;-shinnō&quot;, the 4th son of Emperor Montoku as his heir. This 9-month-old baby was also the grandson of &quot;udaijin&quot; Fujiwara no Yoshifusa.
* 853 (&quot;Ninju 3, 2nd month&quot;): The emperor visited the home of &quot;udaijin&quot; Yoshifusa, the grandfather of his designated heir.
* 11 July 854 (&quot;Saikō 1, 13th day of the 6th month&quot;): The &quot;sadaijin&quot; Minamoto no Tokiwa, also known as Minamoto no Tsune, died at age 43.
* 855 (&quot;Saikō 2, in the 1st month&quot;): The Emishi organized a rebellion; and in response, a force of 1,000 men and provisions were sent to the north.
* 855 (&quot;Saikō 2, 5th month&quot;): The head of the great statute of Buddha in the Tōdai-ji fell off; and in consequence, the emperor ordered the then &quot;dainagon&quot; Fujiwara no Yoshisuke, the brother of &quot;sadaijin&quot; Yoshifusa, to be in charge of gathering the gifts of the pious from throughout the empire to make another head for the Daibutsu.

Events during his reign included the repression of insurrections among the Ebisu people in Mutsu Province in 855, and among the people of the island of Tsushima two years later.

* 7 October 858 (&quot;Ten&#x27;an 2, 27th day of the 8th month&quot;): Montoku died at the age of 32.

The actual site of Montoku&#x27;s grave is known. This emperor is traditionally venerated at a memorial Shinto shrine (&quot;misasagi&quot;) at Kyoto.

The Imperial Household Agency designates this location as Montoku&#x27;s mausoleum. It is formally named &quot;Tamura no misasagi&quot;.

===Kugyō===
 is a collective term for the very few most powerful men attached to the court of the Emperor of Japan in pre-Meiji eras.– &quot;kugyō&quot; of Montoku-tennō (in French)

<doc id="10492" wikidata="Q349243" url="?curid=10492" title="Emperor Seiwa">
<text>was the 56th emperor of Japan, according to the traditional order of succession.

Seiwa&#x27;s reign spanned the years from 858 through 876.

==Traditional narrative==
Seiwa was the fourth son of Emperor Montoku. His mother was Empress Dowager Fujiwara no Akirakeiko (明子), also called the Somedono empress (染殿后). Seiwa&#x27;s mother was the daughter of Fujiwara no Yoshifusa (藤原良房), who was regent and great minister of the council of state.
He was the younger half-brother of Imperial Prince Koretaka (惟喬親王; 844–897)

===Imina===
Before his ascension to the Chrysanthemum Throne, his personal name (his &quot;imina&quot;) was , the first member of the Imperial house to be personally named &quot;-hito&quot; . One meaning of the character 仁 is the Confucian concept of &quot;ren&quot;. Later it has been a tradition to name the personal name of all male members of the Imperial family this way.

He was also known as emperor as &quot;Mizunoo-no-mikado&quot; or &quot;Minoo-tei&quot;.

===Events of Seiwa&#x27;s life===
Originally under the guardianship of his maternal grandfather Fujiwara no Yoshifusa, he displaced Imperial Prince Koretaka (惟喬親王) as Crown Prince. Upon the death of his father in 858, Emperor Montoku, he became Emperor at the age of 9, but the real power was held by his grandfather, Yoshifusa.

* 7 October 858 (&quot;Ten&#x27;an 2, 27th day of the 8th month&quot;): In the 8th year of Montoku&quot;-tennō&quot;″s reign (文徳天皇8年), the emperor died; and the succession (&quot;senso&quot;) was received by his son. Shortly thereafter, Emperor Seiwa is said to have acceded to the throne (&quot;sokui&quot;).
* 15 December 858 (&quot;Ten&#x27;an 2, 7th day of the 11th month&quot;): The emperor&#x27;s official announcement of his enthronement at age 9 was accompanied by the appointment of his grandfather as regent (&quot;sesshō&quot;). This is the first time that this high honor has been accorded to a member of the Fujiwara family, and it is also the first example in Japan of the accession of an heir who is too young to be emperor. The proclamation of the beginning of Seiwa&#x27;s reign was made at the Kotaijingu at Ise Province and at all the tombs of the imperial family.
* 859 (&quot;Jōgan 1, 1st month&quot;): All New Year&#x27;s festivities were suspended because of the period of national mourning for the death of Emperor Montoku.
* 859 (&quot;Jōgan 1&quot;): Construction began on the Iwashimizu Shrine near Heian-kyō. This shrine honors Hachiman, the Shinto war god.
* 869 (&quot;Jōgan 10&quot;): Yōzei was born, and he was named Seiwa&#x27;s heir in the following year.
* 876 (&quot;Jōgan 17, 11th month&quot;): In the 18th year of Seiwa&quot;-tennō&quot;″s reign (清和天皇18年), the emperor ceded his throne to his five-year-old son, which meant that the young child received the succession (&quot;senso&quot;). Shortly thereafter, Emperor Yōzei formally acceded to the throne (&quot;sokui&quot;).
* 878 (&quot;Gangyō 2&quot;): Seiwa became a Buddhist priest. His new priestly name was Soshin (素真).
* 7 January 881 (&quot;Gangyō 4, 4th day of the 12th month&quot;): Former-Emperor Seiwa died at age 30.

==Mausoleum==

The actual site of Seiwa&#x27;s grave is known. The emperor is traditionally venerated at the &quot;misasagi&quot; memorial shrine in the Ukyō-ku ward of Kyoto. The Imperial Household Agency designates this location as Seiwa&#x27;s mausoleum. It is formally named the or Seiwa Tennō Ryō. From the site of his tomb the Emperor Seiwa is sometimes referred to as the . The &quot;kami&quot; of Emperor Seiwa is venerated at the Seiwatennō-sha near the mausoleum.

==Kugyō==
 is a collective term for the very few most powerful men attached to the court of the Emperor of Japan in pre-Meiji eras.

In general, this elite group included only three to four men at a time. These were hereditary courtiers whose experience and background would have brought them to the pinnacle of a life&#x27;s career. During Seiwa&#x27;s reign, this apex of the &quot;Daijō-kan&quot; included:

<doc id="10493" wikidata="Q349280" url="?curid=10493" title="Emperor Yōzei">
<text>was the 57th emperor of Japan, according to the traditional order of succession.

Yōzei&#x27;s reign spanned the years from 876 through 884.

==Traditional narrative==
Before his ascension to the Chrysanthemum Throne, his personal name (his &quot;imina&quot;) was Sadaakira &quot;Shinnō&quot; (貞明親王).

Yōzei was the oldest son of Emperor Seiwa. His mother was the Empress Fujiwara no Takaiko, who was also known after Seiwa&#x27;s abdication as the Nijō empress. Yōzei&#x27;s mother was the sister of Fujiwara no Mototsune, who would figure prominently in the young emperor&#x27;s life.

In ancient Japan, there were four noble clans, the &quot;Gempeitōkitsu&quot; (源平藤橘). One of these clans, the Minamoto clan (源氏) are also known as Genji, and of these, the &quot;Yōzei Genji&quot; (陽成源氏) are descended from the 57th emperor Yōzei.

Yōzei had nine Imperial children, born after he had abdicated.

He is said to have mental instability after acceding to his position at a tender young age. He concentrated on waka during his later years. His famous waka expressed his growing love by superimposing the image of the flow of the river.

==Events of Yōzei&#x27;s life==
Yōzei was made emperor when he was an immature, unformed young boy.

* 869 (&quot;Jōgan 10&quot;): Yōzei was born, and he is named Seiwa&#x27;s heir in the following year.
* 18 December 876 (&quot;Jōgan 18, 29th day of the 11th month&quot;): In the 18th year of Emperor Seiwa&#x27;s reign (清和天皇十八年), he ceded his throne to his son, which meant that the young child received the succession (&quot;senso&quot;). Shortly thereafter, Emperor Yōzei formally acceded to the throne (&quot;sokui&quot;).
* 20 January 877 (&quot;Gangyō 1, 3rd day of the 1st month&quot;): Yōzei was formally enthroned at age 8; and the beginning of a new &quot;nengō&quot; was proclaimed. However, the new residence being constructed for the emperor had not been completed; and initially, he must live elsewhere in the palace compound.
* 877 (&quot;Gangyō 1, 2nd month&quot;): Ambassadors from &quot;Baekje&quot; arrived in the province of Izumo; but they were turned back.
* 877 (&quot;Gangyō 1, 6th month&quot;): There was a great drought; and sacrifices were made at the temples of Hachiman, Kamo and other temples in Ise Province. Eventually, it rained.
* 883 (&quot;Gangyō 7, 1st month&quot;): In his early teens, Yōzei often spent time alone; and sometimes he would feed live frogs to snakes so that he could watch the reptile swallowing; or sometimes, he would find pleasure in setting dogs and monkeys to fight. In time, these amusements became more dangerous. He himself executed criminals. When he became angry, he sometimes chased after those who dared speak up; and he sometimes tried to use his sword. Fujiwara no Mototsune, the &quot;Kanpaku&quot;, used every possible opportunity to turn Yōzei towards more seemly conduct, but the emperor closed his ears to all remonstrances.
* 884 (&quot;Gangyō 8, 1st month&quot;): The extravagant and dangerous habits of the emperor continued unabated. At one point, Mototsune came to the court and discovered that Yōzei had arranged a bizarre scenario for his diversion: He ordered some men to climb high into trees, and then he ordered others to use sharp lances to poke at these men in trees until they fell to their deaths. This extraordinary event convinced Mototsune that the emperor was too &quot;undignified&quot; to reign. Mototsune reluctantly realized that someone needed to devise a strategy for deposing the emperor. Shortly thereafter, Mototsune approached Yōzei and remarked that it must be boring to be so often alone, and then Mototsune suggested that the emperor might be amused by a horse race. Yōzei was attracted to this proposition, and he eagerly encouraged Mototsune to set a time and place for the event. It was decided that this special amusement for the emperor would take place on the 4th day of the 2nd month of Gangyō 8.
* 4 March 884 (&quot;Gangyō 8, 4th day of the 2nd month&quot;): The pretext of a special horse race enticed the emperor to leave his palace. Yōzei traveled in a carriage which was quickly surrounded by a heavy guard. The carriage was redirected to &quot;Yo seí in&quot; palace (&quot;Yang tchhing yuan&quot;) at &quot;Ni zio&quot;, a town situated a short distance to the south-west of Miyako. Mototsune confronted the emperor, explaining that his demented behavior made him incapable of reigning, and that he was being dethroned. At this news, Yōzei cried sincerely, which did attract feelings of compassion from those who witnessed his contrition.

According to very scanty information from the Imperial archives, including sources such as &quot;Rikkokushi,&quot; and &quot;Nihon Sandai Jitsuroku,&quot; Emperor Yōzei murdered one of his retainers, an action that caused massive scandal in the Heian court. Japanese society during the Heian era was very sensitive to issues of &quot;pollution,&quot; both spiritual and personal. Deaths (especially killing animals or people) were the worst acts of pollution possible, and warranted days of seclusion in order to purify oneself. Since the Emperor was seen as a divine figure and linked to the deities, pollution of such extreme degree committed by the highest source was seen as extremely ruinous. Many of the high court officials construed Emperor Yōzei&#x27;s actions as exceeding the bounds of acceptable behavior, and as justifiable cause for the emperor to be forcibly deposed.

In Kitabatake Chikafusa&#x27;s 14th-century account of Emperor Yōzei&#x27;s reign, the emperor is described as possessing a &quot;violent disposition&quot; and unfit to be a ruler. In the end, when Fujiwara no Mototsune, who was &quot;Sesshō&quot; (regent for the child-emperor, 876–880), &quot;Kampaku&quot; (chief advisor or first secretary for the emperor, 880–890), and &quot;Daijō Daijin&quot; (Great Minister of the Council of State), decided that Yōzei should be removed from the throne, he discovered that there was general agreement amongst the &quot;kuge&quot; that this was a correct and necessary decision.

Yōzei was succeeded by his father&#x27;s uncle, Emperor Kōkō; and in the reign of Kōkō&#x27;s son, Emperor Uda, the madness re-visited the tormented former emperor:

* 889 (&quot;Kanpyō 1, 10th month&quot;): The former emperor Yōzei was newly attacked by the mental illness. Yōzei would enter the palace and address courtiers he would meet with the greatest rudeness. He became increasingly furious. He garroted women with the strings of musical instruments and then threw the bodies into a lake. While riding on horseback, he directed his mount to run over people. Sometimes he simply disappeared into the mountains where he chased wild boars and Sika deer, which in Shinto cosmology, were considered to be messengers of the &quot;kami.&quot;

Yōzei lived in retirement until the age of 80.
The actual site of Yōzei&#x27;s grave is known. This emperor is traditionally venerated at a memorial Shinto shrine (&quot;misasagi&quot;) at Kyoto.

The Imperial Household Agency designates this location as Yōzei&#x27;s mausoleum. It is formally named &quot;Kaguragaoka no Higashi no misasagi&quot;.

===Kugyō===
 is a collective term for the very few most powerful men attached to the court of the Emperor of Japan in pre-Meiji eras.

In general, this elite group included only three to four men at a time. These were hereditary courtiers whose experience and background would have brought them to the pinnacle of a life&#x27;s career. During Yozei&#x27;s reign, this apex of the &quot;Daijō-kan&quot; included:
* &quot;Sesshō&quot;, Fujiwara no Mototsune (藤原基経), 836–891.
* &quot;Kampaku&quot;, Fujiwara no Mototsune (藤原基経).
* &quot;Daijō-daijin&quot;, Fujiwara no Mototsune.
* &quot;Sadaijin&quot;, Minamoto no Tōru (源融).
* &quot;Udaijin&quot;, Fujiwara no Mototsune.
* &quot;Udaijin&quot;, Minamoto no Masaru (源多).
* &quot;Naidaijin&quot; (not appointed)
* &quot;Dainagon&quot;, Minamoto no Masaru (源多).
* &quot;Dainagon&quot;, Minafuchi no Toshina (南淵年名), 807–877

==Eras of Yōzei&#x27;s reign==
The years of Yōzei&#x27;s reign are more specifically identified by more than one era name or &quot;nengō&quot;. During this time, the tradition of naming eras because of good omens changed. Instead, the name of an era might be chosen to limit the effects of something bad.
* &quot;Jōgan&quot; (859–877)
* &quot;Gangyō&quot; (877–885)

<doc id="10494" wikidata="Q440518" url="?curid=10494" title="Emperor Kōkō">
<text>was the 58th emperor of Japan, according to the traditional order of succession.

Kōkō reigned from 884 to 887.

== Traditional narrative ==
Before the emperor&#x27;s ascension to the Chrysanthemum Throne, his name (&quot;imina&quot;) was or &quot;Komatsu-tei&quot;. He would later be identified sometimes as &quot;the Emperor of Komatsu&quot;. This resulted in the later Emperor Go-Komatsu adopting this name (&quot;go-&quot; meaning &quot;later&quot;, so &quot;Later Emperor Komatsu&quot; or &quot;Emperor Komatsu II&quot;).

Tokiyasu &quot;Shinnō&quot; was the third son of Emperor Ninmyō. His mother was Fujiwara no Sawako.

Kōkō had four Imperial consorts and 41 Imperial sons and daughters.

== Events of Kōkō&#x27;s life ==
The first &quot;kampaku&quot; Fujiwara no Mototsune was influential in the process by which Kōkō became an emperor. At the time Emperor Yōzei was deposed, Prince Tokiyasu was already Governor of Hitachi and Chief Minister of Ceremonies (&quot;Jibu-kyō&quot;, 治部卿)

According to Kitabatake Chikafusa&#x27;s 14th-century account, Mototsune resolved the problem of succession by simply going to visit Tokiyasu&quot;-shinnō&quot;, where the kampaku addressed the prince as a sovereign and assigned imperial guards. The prince signaled his acceptance by going into the imperial palanquin, which then conducted him to the emperor&#x27;s residence within the palace. Curiously, he was still wearing the robes of a prince when he decided to take this ride into an entirely unanticipated future.

* February 4, 884 (&quot;Gangyō 8, 4th day of the 1st month&quot;): In the 8th year of Emperor Yōzei&#x27;s reign (陽成天皇八年), the emperor was deposed; and scholars then construed that the succession (&quot;senso&quot;) was received by the third son of former Emperor Ninmyō, who was then age 55.
* March 23, 884 (&quot;Gangyō 8, 23rd day of the 2nd month&quot;): Emperor Kōkō is said to have acceded to the throne (&quot;sokui&quot;).
* 885 (&quot;Gangyō 9&quot;): The era name was changed accordingly in 885.

During his reign, Kōkō revived many ancient court rituals and ceremonies, and one example is the imperial hawking excursion to Serikawa, which had been initiated in 796 by Emperor Kanmu. This ritual event was revived by Kōkō after a lapse of 50 years.

* January 11, 886 (&quot;Ninna 2, 14th day of the 12th month&quot;): Kōkō traveled to Seri-gawa to hunt with falcons. He very much enjoyed this kind of hunting, and he often took time for this kind of activity.
* September 17, 887 (&quot;Ninna 3, 26th day of the 8th month &quot;) 仁和三年八月二十六日 --&gt;: Kōkō died at the age of 57.

The actual site of Kōkō&#x27;s grave is known. This emperor is traditionally venerated at a memorial Shinto shrine (&quot;misasagi&quot;) at Kyoto.

The Imperial Household Agency designates this location as Kōkō&#x27;s mausoleum. It is formally named &quot;Kaguragaoka no Higashi no misasagi&quot;.

<doc id="10495" wikidata="Q349267" url="?curid=10495" title="Emperor Uda">
<text>was the 59th emperor of Japan, according to the traditional order of succession.

Uda&#x27;s reign spanned the years from 887 through 897.

==Traditional narrative==

===Name and legacy===
Before his ascension to the Chrysanthemum Throne, his personal name (&quot;imina&quot;) was or &quot;Chōjiin-tei&quot;.

Emperor Uda was the third son of Emperor Kōkō. His mother was Empress Dowager Hanshi, a daughter of Prince Nakano (who was himself a son of Emperor Kanmu). Uda had five Imperial consorts and 20 Imperial children. Particularly important sons include:

* Prince Atsuhito (884–930)
* Prince Atsuzane (893–967)

===Historical background===

In ancient Japan, there were four noble clans, the &quot;Gempeitōkitsu&quot; . One of these clans, the Minamoto clan , is also known as Genji. Some of Uda&#x27;s grandchildren were granted the surname &quot;Minamoto&quot;, the most used surname for former Japanese royalty. In order to distinguish Uda&#x27;s descendants from other Genji, they became known as the Uda Genji , some of which moved to Ōmi Province and became known as Sasaki clan or Ōmi Genji .

Among the Uda Genji, Minamoto no Masazane , a son of Prince Atsumi succeeded in the court. Masazane became &quot;sadaijin&quot; (Minister of the Left). One of Masazane&#x27;s daughters, Minamoto no Rinshi married Fujiwara no Michinaga and from this marriage three empresses dowagers and two regents (&quot;sesshō&quot;) were born.

From Masanobu, several kuge families originated including the Niwata, Ayanokōji, Itsutsuji, Ōhara and Jikōji. From his fourth son Sukeyosi, the Sasaki clan originated, and thus Kyōgoku clan originated. These descendants are known as Ōmi Genji today. From this line, Sasaki Takauji made a success at the Muromachi shogunate and the Amago clan originated from his brother.

===Events of Uda&#x27;s life===
Uda&#x27;s father, Emperor Kōkō, demoted his sons from the rank of imperial royals to that of subjects in order to reduce the state expenses, as well as their political influence. Sadami was given the clan name of Minamoto and named Minamoto no Sadami. Later, in 887, when Kōkō needed to appoint his successor, Sadami was once again promoted to the Imperial Prince rank with support of &quot;kampaku&quot; Fujiwara no Mototsune, since Sadami was adopted by a half-sister of Mototsune. After the death of his father in November of that year, Sadami&quot;-shinnō&quot; ascended to the throne.

* September 17, 887 (&quot;Ninna 3, 26th day of the 8th month&quot;): Emperor Kōkō died; and his third son received the succession (&quot;senso&quot;). Shortly thereafter, Emperor Uda formally acceded to the throne (&quot;sokui&quot;).
* December 5, 887 (&quot;Ninna 3, 17th day of the 11th month&quot;): Mototsune asked Uda for permission to retire from his duties; but the emperor is said to have responded, &quot;My youth limits my ability to govern; and if you stop offering me your good counsel, I will be obliged to abdicate and to retire to a monastery.&quot; Therefore, Mototsune continued to serve as the new emperor&#x27;s &quot;kampaku&quot;.

* 888 (&quot;Ninna 4, 8th month&quot;): Construction of the newly created Buddhist temple of was completed; and a former disciple of Kōbō-daishi was installed as the new abbot.
* 889 (&quot;Kanpyō 1, 10th month&quot;): The former emperor Yōzei became deranged, and afflicted by mental illness. Yōzei would enter the palace and address courtiers he would meet with the greatest rudeness. He became increasingly furious. He garroted women with the strings of musical instruments and then threw the bodies into a lake. While riding on horseback, he directed his mount to run over people. Sometimes he simply disappeared into the mountains where he chased wild boars and red deer.

In the beginning of Uda&#x27;s reign, Mototsune held the office of &quot;kampaku&quot; (or chancellor). Emperor Uda&#x27;s reign is marked by a prolonged struggle to reassert power by the Imperial Family away from the increasing influence of the Fujiwara, beginning with the death of Mototsune in 891. Records show that shortly thereafter, Emperor Uda assigned scholars Sukeyo and Kiyoyuki, supporters of Mototsune, to provincial posts in the remote provinces of Mutsu and Higo respectively. Meanwhile, non-Fujiwara officials mainly from the Minamoto family were promoted to prominent ranks, while his trusted counselor, Sugawara no Michizane rapidly rose in rank within five years to reach the third rank in the court, and supervision of the Crown Prince&#x27;s household. Meanwhile, Mototsune&#x27;s son and heir, Fujiwara no Tokihira, rose in rank, but only just enough to prevent an open power struggle.

Meanwhile, Emperor Uda attempted to return Court politics to the original spirit envisioned in the Ritsuryō Codes, while reviving intellectual interest in Confucian doctrine and culture. In the seventh month of 896, Emperor Uda dispatched Sugawara no Michizane to review prisoners in the capitol and provide a general amnesty for the wrongfully accused, in keeping with Chinese practices. Emperor Uda also issued edicts reinforcing peasant land rights from encroachment by powerful families in the capital or monastic institutions, while auditing tax collections made in the provinces.

Emperor Uda stopped the practice of sending ambassadors to China . The emperor&#x27;s decision was informed by what he understood as persuasive counsel from Sugawara Michizane.

The Special Festival of the Kamo Shrine was first held during Uda&#x27;s reign.

In 897, Uda abdicated in favor of his eldest son, Prince Atsuhito, who would later come to be known as Emperor Daigo. Uda left behind an hortatory will or testament which offered general admonitions or precepts for his son&#x27;s guidance (&quot;see excerpt at right&quot;). The document praises Fujiwara no Tokihira as an advisor but cautions against his womanizing; and Sugawara no Michizane is praised as Uda&#x27;s mentor. Both were assigned by Emperor Uda to look after his son until the latter reach maturity.

Three years later, he entered the Buddhist priesthood at age 34 in 900. Having founded the temple at Ninna-ji, Uda made it his new home after his abdication.

 His Buddhist name was Kongō Kaku. He was sometimes called &quot;the Cloistered Emperor of Teiji &quot;, because the name of the Buddhist hall where he resided after becoming a priest was called Teijiin.

Uda died in 931 (&quot;Shōhei 1, 19th day of the 7th month&quot;) at the age of 65.

The actual site of Uda&#x27;s grave is known. This emperor is traditionally venerated at a memorial Shinto shrine (&quot;misasagi&quot;) at Kyoto.

The Imperial Household Agency designates this location as Uda&#x27;s mausoleum. It is formally named &quot;Kaguragaoka no Higashi no misasagi&quot;.

The former emperor is buried amongst the &quot;Seven Imperial Tombs&quot; at Ryōan-ji Temple in Kyoto. The mound which commemorates the Hosokawa Emperor Uda is today named &quot;O-uchiyama&quot;. The emperor&#x27;s burial place would have been quite humble in the period after Uda died. These tombs reached their present state as a result of the 19th century restoration of imperial sepulchers which were ordered by Emperor Meiji.

===Kugyō===
 is a collective term for the very few most powerful men attached to the court of the Emperor of Japan in pre-Meiji eras.

In general, this elite group included only three to four men at a time. These were hereditary courtiers whose experience and background would have brought them to the pinnacle of a life&#x27;s career.

During Uda&#x27;s reign, this apex of the &quot;Daijō-kan&quot; included:

* &quot;Kampaku&quot;, Fujiwara no Mototsune 
* &quot;Daijō-daijin&quot;, Fujiwara no Mototsune
* &quot;Sadaijin&quot;, Minamoto no Tōru 
* &quot;Sadaijin&quot;, Fujiwara no Yoshiyo 
* &quot;Udaijin&quot;, Minamoto no Masaru 
* &quot;Udaijin&quot;, Fujiwara no Yoshiyo 
* &quot;Udaijin&quot;, Minamoto no Yoshiari 
* &quot;Naidaijin&quot; (not appointed)
* &quot;Dainagon&quot;

<doc id="10500" wikidata="Q25587" url="?curid=10500" title="Earless seal">
<text>The earless seals, phocids, or true seals are one of the three main groups of mammals within the seal lineage, Pinnipedia. All true seals are members of the family Phocidae (). They are sometimes called crawling seals to distinguish them from the fur seals and sea lions of the family Otariidae. Seals live in the oceans of both hemispheres and, with the exception of the more tropical monk seals, are mostly confined to polar, subpolar, and temperate climates. The Baikal seal is the only species of exclusively freshwater seal.

==Taxonomy and evolution==

===Evolution===

The earliest known fossil earless seal is &quot;Noriphoca gaudini&quot; from the late Oligocene or earliest Miocene (Aquitanian) of Italy. Other early fossil phocids date from the mid-Miocene, 15 million years ago in the north Atlantic. Until recently, many researchers believed that phocids evolved separately from otariids and odobenids; and that they evolved from otter-like animals, such as &quot;Potamotherium&quot;, which inhabited European freshwater lakes. Recent evidence strongly suggests a monophyletic origin for all pinnipeds from a single ancestor, possibly &quot;Enaliarctos&quot;, most closely related to the mustelids and bears.

Monk seals and elephant seals were previously believed to have first entered the Pacific through the open straits between North and South America, with the Antarctic true seals either using the same route or travelled down the west coast of Africa. It is now thought that the monk seals, elephant seals, and Antarctic seals all evolved in the southern hemisphere, and likely dispersed to their current distributions from more southern latitudes.

===Taxonomy===

In the 1980s and 1990s, morphological phylogenetic analysis of the phocids led to new conclusions about the interrelatedness of the various genera. More recent molecular phylogenetic analyses have confirmed the monophyly of the two phocid subfamilies (Phocinae and Monachinae). The Monachinae (known as the &quot;southern&quot; seals), is composed of three tribes; the Lobodontini, Miroungini, and Monachini. The four Antarctic genera &quot;Hydrurga&quot;, &quot;Leptonychotes&quot;, &quot;Lobodon&quot;, and &quot;Ommatophoca&quot; are part of the tribe Lobodontini. Tribe Miroungini is composed of the elephant seals. The Monk seals (&quot;Monachus&quot; and &quot;Neomonachus&quot;) are all part of the tribe Monachini. Likewise, subfamily Phocinae (the &quot;northern&quot; seals) also includes three tribes; Erignathini (&quot;Erignathus)&quot;, Cystophorini (&quot;Cystophora)&quot;, and Phocini (all other phocines). More recently, five species have been split off from &quot;Phoca&quot;, forming three additional genera.

Alternatively the three monachine tribes have been evaluated to familiar status, which elephant seals and the Antarctic seals are more closely related to the phocines.

===Extant genera===
==Biology==

===External anatomy===


Adult phocids vary from in length and in weight in the ringed seal to and in the southern elephant seal, which is the largest member of the order Carnivora. Phocids have fewer teeth than land-based members of the Carnivora, although they retain powerful canines. Some species lack molars altogether. The dental formula is:
While otariids are known for speed and maneuverability, phocids are known for efficient, economical movement. This allows most phocids to forage far from land to exploit prey resources, while otariids are tied to rich upwelling zones close to breeding sites. Phocids swim by sideways movements of their bodies, using their hind flippers to fullest effect. Their fore flippers are used primarily for steering, while their hind flippers are bound to the pelvis in such a way that they cannot bring them under their bodies to walk on them. They are more streamlined than fur seals and sea lions, so they can swim more effectively over long distances. However, because they cannot turn their hind flippers downward, they are very clumsy on land, having to wriggle with their front flippers and abdominal muscles.

Phocid respiratory and circulatory systems are adapted to allow diving to considerable depths, and they can spend a long time underwater between breaths. Air is forced from the lungs during a dive and into the upper respiratory passages, where gases cannot easily be absorbed into the bloodstream. This helps protect the seal from the bends. The middle ear is also lined with blood sinuses that inflate during diving, helping to maintain a constant pressure.

Phocids are more specialized for aquatic life than otariids. They lack external ears and have sleek, streamlined bodies. Retractable nipples, internal testicles, and an internal penile sheath provide further streamlining. A smooth layer of blubber lies underneath the skin. Phocids are able to divert blood flow to this layer to help control their temperatures.

===Communication===

Unlike otariids, true seals do not communicate by &#x27;barking&#x27;. Instead, they communicate by slapping the water and grunting.

===Reproduction===


Phocids spend most of their time at sea, although they return to land or pack ice to breed and give birth. Pregnant females spend long periods foraging at sea, building up fat reserves, and then return to the breeding site to use their stored energy to nurse pups. However, the common seal displays a reproductive strategy similar to that used by otariids, in which the mother makes short foraging trips between nursing bouts.

Because a phocid mother&#x27;s feeding grounds are often hundreds of kilometers from the breeding site, she must fast while lactating. This combination of fasting with lactation requires the mother to provide large amounts of energy to her pup at a time when she is not eating (and often, not drinking). Mothers must supply their own metabolic needs while nursing. This is a miniature version of the humpback whales&#x27; strategy, which involves fasting during their months-long migration from arctic feeding areas to tropical breeding/nursing areas and back.

Phocids produce thick, fat-rich milk that allows them to provide their pups with large amounts of energy in a short period. This allows the mother to return to the sea in time to replenish her reserves. Lactation ranges from five to seven weeks in the monk seal to just three to five days in the hooded seal. The mother ends nursing by leaving her pup at the breeding site to search for food (pups continue to nurse if given the opportunity). &quot;Milk stealers&quot; that suckle from unrelated, sleeping females are not uncommon; this often results in the death of the mother&#x27;s pup, since a female can only feed one pup.

===Growth and maturation===

The pup&#x27;s diet is so high in calories that it builds up a fat store. Before the pup is ready to forage, the mother abandons it, and the pup consumes its own fat for weeks or even months while it matures. Seals, like all marine mammals, need time to develop the oxygen stores, swimming muscles, and neural pathways necessary for effective diving and foraging. Seal pups typically eat no food and drink no water during the period, although some polar species eat snow. The postweaning fast ranges from two weeks in the hooded seal to 9–12 weeks in the northern elephant seal. The physiological and behavioral adaptations that allow phocid pups to endure these remarkable fasts, which are among the longest for any mammal, remain an area of active study and research.

=== Feeding strategy ===

Phocids make use of at least four different feeding strategies: suction feeding, grip and tear feeding, filter feeding, and pierce feeding. Each of these feeding strategies is aided by a specialized skull, mandible, and tooth morphology. However, despite morphological specialization, most phocids are opportunistic and employ multiple strategies to capture and eat prey. For example, the leopard seal, &quot;Hydrurga leptonyx&quot;, uses grip and tear feeding to prey on penguins, suction feeding to consume small fish, and filter feeding to catch krill.

<text>Espionage, spying, or intelligence gathering is the act of obtaining secret or confidential information (intelligence). A person who commits espionage is called an espionage agent or spy. Any individual or spy ring (a cooperating group of spies), in the service of a government, company, criminal organization, or independent operation, can commit espionage. The practice is clandestine, as it is by definition unwelcome. In some circumstances, it may be a legal tool of law enforcement and in others, it may be illegal and punishable by law.

Espionage is often part of an institutional effort by a government or commercial concern. However, the term tends to be associated with state spying on potential or actual enemies for military purposes. Spying involving corporations is known as industrial espionage.

One way to gather data and information about a targeted organization is by infiltrating its ranks. Spies can then return information such as the size and strength of enemy forces. They can also find dissidents within the organization and influence them to provide further information or to defect. In times of crisis, spies steal technology and sabotage the enemy in various ways. Counterintelligence is the practice of thwarting enemy espionage and intelligence-gathering. Almost all sovereign states have strict laws concerning espionage, including those who practice espionage in other countries, and the penalties for being caught are often severe.

== History ==
Espionage has been recognized as of importance in military affairs since ancient times.

The oldest known classified document was a report made by a spy disguised as a diplomatic envoy in the court of King Hammurabi, who died in around 1750 BC. The ancient Egyptians had a developed secret service, and espionage is mentioned in the &quot;Iliad&quot;, the Bible, and the Amarna letters. Espionage was also prevalent in the Greco-Roman world, when spies employed illiterate subjects in civil services.

The thesis that espionage and intelligence has a central role in war as well as peace was first advanced in &quot;The Art of War&quot; and in the &quot;Arthashastra&quot;. In the Middle Ages European states excelled at what has later been termed counter-subversion when Catholic inquisitions were staged to annihilate heresy. Inquisitions were marked by centrally organised mass interrogations and detailed record keeping. Western espionage changed fundamentally during the Renaissance when Italian city-states installed resident ambassadors in capital cities to collect intelligence. Renaissance Venice became so obsessed with espionage that the Council of Ten, which was nominally responsible for security, did not even allow the doge to consult government archives freely. In 1481 the Council of Ten barred all Venetian government officials from making contact with ambassadors or foreigners. Those revealing official secrets could face the death penalty. Venice became obsessed with espionage because successful international trade demanded that the city-state could protect its trade secrets. Under Queen Elizabeth I of England (), Francis Walsingham ( 1532–1590) was appointed foreign secretary and intelligence chief. The novelist and journalist Daniel Defoe (died 1731) not only spied for the British government, but also developed a theory of espionage foreshadowing modern police-state methods.

During the American Revolution, Nathan Hale and Benedict Arnold achieved their fame as spies, and there was considerable use of spies on both sides during the American Civil War. Though not a spy himself, George Washington was America&#x27;s first spymaster, utilizing espionage tactics against the British.

In the 20th century, at the height of World War I, all great powers except the United States had elaborate civilian espionage systems, and all national military establishments had intelligence units. In order to protect the country against foreign agents, the U.S. Congress passed the Espionage Act of 1917. Mata Hari, who obtained information for Germany by seducing French officials, was the most noted espionage agent of World War I. Prior to World War II, Germany and Imperial Japan established elaborate espionage nets. In 1942 the Office of Strategic Services was founded by Gen. William J. Donovan. However, the British system was the keystone of Allied intelligence. Numerous resistance groups such as the Austrian Maier-Messner Group, the French Resistance, the Witte Brigade, Milorg and the Polish Home Army worked against Nazi Germany and provided the Allied secret services with information that was very important for the war effort.

Since the end of World War II, the activity of espionage has enlarged, much of it growing out of the Cold War between the United States and the former USSR. The Russian Empire and its successor, the Soviet Union, have had a long tradition of espionage ranging from the Okhrana to the KGB (Committee for State Security), which also acted as a secret police force. In the United States, the 1947 National Security Act created the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) to coordinate intelligence and the National Security Agency for research into codes and electronic communication. In addition to these, the United States has 13 other intelligence gathering agencies; most of the U.S. expenditures for intelligence gathering are budgeted to various Defense Dept. agencies and their programs. Under the intelligence reorganization of 2004, the director of national intelligence is responsible for overseeing and coordinating the activities and budgets of the U.S. intelligence agencies.

In the Cold War, espionage cases included Alger Hiss, Whittaker Chambers and the Rosenberg Case. In 1952 the Communist Chinese captured two CIA agents and in 1960 Francis Gary Powers, flying a U-2 reconnaissance mission over the Soviet Union for the CIA, was shot down and captured. During the Cold War, many Soviet intelligence officials defected to the West, including Gen. Walter Krivitsky, Victor Kravchenko, Vladimir Petrov, Peter Deriabin, Pawel Monat and Oleg Penkovsky of the GRU. Among Western officials who defected to the Soviet Union are Guy Burgess and Donald D. Maclean of Great Britain in 1951, Otto John of West Germany in 1954, William H. Martin and Bernon F. Mitchell, U.S. cryptographers, in 1960, and Harold (Kim) Philby of Great Britain in 1962. U.S. acknowledgment of its U-2 flights and the exchange of Francis Gary Powers for Rudolf Abel in 1962 implied the legitimacy of some espionage as an arm of foreign policy.

China has a very cost-effective intelligence program that is especially effective in monitoring neighboring countries such as Mongolia, Russia and India. Smaller countries can also mount effective and focused espionage efforts. For instance, the Vietnamese communists had consistently superior intelligence during the Vietnam War. Some Islamic countries, including Libya, Iran and Syria, have highly developed operations as well. SAVAK, the secret police of the Pahlavi dynasty, was particularly feared by Iranian dissidents before the 1979 Iranian Revolution.

== Modern day ==
Today, spy agencies target the illegal drug trade and terrorists as well as state actors.

Intelligence services value certain intelligence collection techniques over others. The former Soviet Union, for example, preferred human sources over research in open sources, while the United States has tended to emphasize technological methods such as SIGINT and IMINT. In the Soviet Union, both political (KGB) and military intelligence (GRU) officers were judged by the number of agents they recruited.

== Targets of espionage ==
Espionage agents are usually trained experts in a targeted field so they can differentiate mundane information from targets of value to their own organizational development. Correct identification of the target at its execution is the sole purpose of the espionage operation.

Broad areas of espionage targeting expertise include:
* Natural resources: strategic production identification and assessment (food, energy, materials). Agents are usually found among bureaucrats who administer these resources in their own countries
* Popular sentiment towards domestic and foreign policies (popular, middle class, elites). Agents often recruited from field journalistic crews, exchange postgraduate students and sociology researchers
* Strategic economic strengths (production, research, manufacture, infrastructure). Agents recruited from science and technology academia, commercial enterprises, and more rarely from among military technologists
* Military capability intelligence (offensive, defensive, manoeuvre, naval, air, space). Agents are trained by military espionage education facilities and posted to an area of operation with covert identities to minimize prosecution
* Counterintelligence operations targeting opponent&#x27;s intelligence services themselves, such as breaching the confidentiality of communications and recruiting defectors or moles

== Methods and terminology ==
Although the news media may speak of &quot;spy satellites&quot; and the like, espionage is not a synonym for all intelligence-gathering disciplines. It is a specific form of human source intelligence (HUMINT). Codebreaking (cryptanalysis or COMINT), aircraft or satellite photography (IMINT), and analysis of publicly available data sources (OSINT) are all intelligence gathering disciplines, but none of them is considered espionage. Many HUMINT activities, such as prisoner interrogation, reports from military reconnaissance patrols and from diplomats, etc., are not considered espionage. Espionage is the disclosure of sensitive information (classified) to people who are not cleared for that information or access to that sensitive information.

Unlike other forms of intelligence collection disciplines, espionage usually involves accessing the place where the desired information is stored or accessing the people who know the information and will divulge it through some kind of subterfuge. There are exceptions to physical meetings, such as the Oslo Report, or the insistence of Robert Hanssen in never meeting the people who bought his information.

The US defines espionage towards itself as &quot;the act of obtaining, delivering, transmitting, communicating, or receiving information about the national defence with an intent, or reason to believe, that the information may be used to the injury of the United States or to the advantage of any foreign nation&quot;. &quot;Black&#x27;s Law Dictionary&quot; (1990) defines espionage as: &quot;... gathering, transmitting, or losing ... information related to the national defense&quot;. Espionage is a violation of United States law, and Article 106a of the Uniform Code of Military Justice. The United States, like most nations, conducts espionage against other nations, under the control of the National Clandestine Service. Britain&#x27;s espionage activities are controlled by the Secret Intelligence Service.

== Organization ==
A spy is a person employed to seek out secret information from a source. Within the United States Intelligence Community, &quot;asset&quot; is more common usage. A case officer or Special Agent, who may have diplomatic status (i.e., official cover or non-official cover), supports and directs the human collector. Cut-outs are couriers who do not know the agent or case officer but transfer messages. A safe house is a refuge for spies. Spies often seek to obtain secret information from another source.

In larger networks, the organization can be complex with many methods to avoid detection, including clandestine cell systems. Often the players have never met. Case officers are stationed in foreign countries to recruit and supervise intelligence agents, who in turn spy on targets in the countries where they are assigned. A spy need not be a citizen of the target country and hence does not automatically commit treason when operating within it. While the more common practice is to recruit a person already trusted with access to sensitive information, sometimes a person with a well-prepared synthetic identity (cover background), called a &quot;legend&quot; in tradecraft, may attempt to infiltrate a target organization.

These agents can be moles (who are recruited before they get access to secrets), defectors (who are recruited after they get access to secrets and leave their country) or defectors in place (who get access but do not leave).

A &quot;legend&quot; is also employed for an individual who is not an illegal agent, but is an ordinary citizen who is &quot;relocated&quot;, for example, a &quot;protected witness&quot;. Nevertheless, such a non-agent very likely will also have a case officer who will act as a controller. As in most, if not all synthetic identity schemes, for whatever purpose (illegal or legal), the assistance of a controller is required.

Spies may also be used to spread disinformation in the organization in which they are planted, such as giving false reports about their country&#x27;s military movements, or about a competing company&#x27;s ability to bring a product to market. Spies may be given other roles that also require infiltration, such as sabotage.

Many governments spy on their allies as well as their enemies, although they typically maintain a policy of not commenting on this. Governments also employ private companies to collect information on their behalf such as SCG International Risk, International Intelligence Limited and others.

Many organizations, both national and non-national, conduct espionage operations. It should not be assumed that espionage is always directed at the most secret operations of a target country. National and terrorist organizations and other groups are also targeted. This is because governments want to retrieve information that they can use to be proactive in protecting their nation from potential terrorist attacks.

Communications both are necessary to espionage and clandestine operations, and also a great vulnerability when the adversary has sophisticated SIGINT detection and interception capability. Spies rely on COVCOM or covert communication through technically advanced spy devices. Agents must also transfer money securely.

== Industrial espionage ==
Reportedly Canada is losing $12 billion and German companies are estimated to be losing about €50 billion ($87 billion) and 30,000 jobs to industrial espionage every year.

== Agents in espionage ==
In espionage jargon, an &quot;agent&quot; is the person who does the spying. They may be a citizen of a country recruited by that country to spy on another; a citizen of a country recruited by that country to carry out false flag assignments disrupting his own country; a citizen of one country who is recruited by a second country to spy on or work against his own country or a third country, and more.

In popular usage, this term is sometimes confused with an &quot;intelligence officer&quot;, &quot;intelligence operative&quot;, or &quot;case officer&quot; who recruits and handles agents.

Among the most common forms of agent are:
* Agent provocateur: instigates trouble or provides information to gather as many people as possible into one location for an arrest.
* Intelligence agent: provides access to sensitive information through the use of special privileges. If used in &quot;corporate intelligence&quot; gathering, this may include gathering information of a corporate business venture or stock portfolio. In &quot;economic intelligence&quot;, &quot;Economic Analysts may use their specialized skills to analyze and interpret economic trends and developments, assess and track foreign financial activities, and develop new econometric and modelling methodologies.&quot; This may also include information of trade or tariff.
* Agent-of-influence: provides political influence in an area of interest, possibly including publications needed to further an intelligence service agenda. The use of the media to print a story to mislead a foreign service into action, exposing their operations while under surveillance.
* Double agent: engages in clandestine activity for two intelligence or security services (or more in joint operations), who provides information about one or about each to the other, and who wittingly withholds significant information from one on the instructions of the other or is unwittingly manipulated by one so that significant facts are withheld from the adversary. Peddlers, fabricators, and others who work for themselves rather than a service are not double agents because they are not agents. The fact that double agents have an agent relationship with both sides distinguishes them from penetrations, who normally are placed with the target service in a staff or officer capacity.&quot;
** Redoubled agent: forced to mislead the foreign intelligence service after being caught as a double agent.
** Unwitting double agent: offers or is forced to recruit as a double or redoubled agent and in the process is recruited by either a third-party intelligence service or his own government without the knowledge of the intended target intelligence service or the agent. This can be useful in capturing important information from an agent that is attempting to seek allegiance with another country. The double agent usually has knowledge of both intelligence services and can identify operational techniques of both, thus making third-party recruitment difficult or impossible. The knowledge of operational techniques can also affect the relationship between the operations officer (or case officer) and the agent if the case is transferred by an operational targeting officer] to a new operations officer, leaving the new officer vulnerable to attack. This type of transfer &quot;may&quot; occur when an officer has completed his term of service or when his &quot;cover&quot; is blown.
* Sleeper agent: recruited to &quot;wake up&quot; and perform a specific set of tasks or functions while living undercover in an area of interest. This type of agent is not the same as a &quot;deep cover operative&quot;, who continually contacts a case officer to file intelligence reports. A sleeper agent is not in contact with anyone until &quot;activated&quot;.
* Triple agent: works for three intelligence services.

Less common or lesser known forms of agent include:
* Access agent: provides access to other potential agents by providing offender profiling information that can help lead to recruitment into an intelligence service.
* Confusion agent: provides misleading information to an enemy intelligence service or attempts to discredit the operations of the &quot;target&quot; in an operation.
* Facilities agent: provides access to buildings, such as garages or offices used for staging operations, resupply, etc.
* Illegal agent: lives in another country under false credentials and does not report to a local station. A nonofficial cover operative can be dubbed an &quot;illegal&quot; when working in another country without diplomatic protection.
* Principal agent: functions as a handler for an established network of agents, usually considered &quot;blue chip&quot;.

== Law ==

Espionage against a nation is a crime under the legal code of many nations. In the United States, it is covered by the Espionage Act of 1917. The risks of espionage vary. A spy violating the host country&#x27;s laws may be deported, imprisoned, or even executed. A spy violating its own country&#x27;s laws can be imprisoned for espionage or/and treason (which in the United States and some other jurisdictions can only occur if they take up arms or aids the enemy against their own country during wartime), or even executed, as the Rosenbergs were. For example, when Aldrich Ames handed a stack of dossiers of U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) agents in the Eastern Bloc to his KGB-officer &quot;handler&quot;, the KGB &quot;rolled up&quot; several networks, and at least ten people were secretly shot. When Ames was arrested by the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), he faced life in prison; his contact, who had diplomatic immunity, was declared &quot;persona non grata&quot; and taken to the airport. Ames&#x27; wife was threatened with life imprisonment if her husband did not cooperate; he did, and she was given a five-year sentence. Hugh Francis Redmond, a CIA officer in China, spent nineteen years in a Chinese prison for espionage—and died there—as he was operating without diplomatic cover and immunity.

In United States law, treason, espionage, and spying are separate crimes. Treason and espionage have graduated punishment levels.

The United States in World War I passed the Espionage Act of 1917. Over the years, many spies, such as the Soble spy ring, Robert Lee Johnson, the Rosenberg ring, Aldrich Hazen Ames, Robert Philip Hanssen, Jonathan Pollard, John Anthony Walker, James Hall III, and others have been prosecuted under this law.

From ancient times, the penalty for espionage in many countries was execution. This was true right up until the era of World War II; for example, Josef Jakobs was a Nazi spy who parachuted into Great Britain in 1941 and was executed for espionage.

In modern times, many people convicted of espionage have been given penal sentences rather than execution. For example, Aldrich Hazen Ames is an American CIA analyst, turned KGB mole, who was convicted of espionage in 1994; he is serving a life sentence without the possibility of parole in the high-security Allenwood U.S. Penitentiary. Ames was formerly a 31-year CIA counterintelligence officer and analyst who committed espionage against his country by spying for the Soviet Union and Russia. So far as it is known, Ames compromised the second-largest number of CIA agents, second only to Robert Hanssen, who also served a prison sentence until his death in 2023.

=== Use against non-spies ===
Espionage laws are also used to prosecute non-spies. In the United States, the Espionage Act of 1917 was used against socialist politician Eugene V. Debs (at that time the Act had much stricter guidelines and amongst other things banned speech against military recruiting). The law was later used to suppress publication of periodicals, for example of Father Coughlin in World War II. In the early 21st century, the act was used to prosecute whistleblowers such as Thomas Andrews Drake, John Kiriakou, and Edward Snowden, as well as officials who communicated with journalists for innocuous reasons, such as Stephen Jin-Woo Kim.

, India and Pakistan were holding several hundred prisoners of each other&#x27;s country for minor violations like trespass or visa overstay, often with accusations of espionage attached. Some of these include cases where Pakistan and India both deny citizenship to these people, leaving them stateless. The BBC reported in 2012 on one such case, that of Mohammed Idrees, who was held under Indian police control for approximately 13 years for overstaying his 15-day visa by 2–3 days after seeing his ill parents in 1999. Much of the 13 years were spent in prison waiting for a hearing, and more time was spent homeless or living with generous families. The Indian People&#x27;s Union for Civil Liberties and Human Rights Law Network both decried his treatment. The BBC attributed some of the problems to tensions caused by the Kashmir conflict.

=== Espionage laws in the UK ===
Espionage is illegal in the UK under the National Security Act 2023, which repealed prior Official Secrets Acts and creates three separate offences for espionage. A person is liable to be imprisoned for life for committing an offence under Section 1 of the Act, or 14 years for an offence under Sections 2 and 3

==== Government intelligence laws and its distinction from espionage ====
Government intelligence is very much distinct from espionage, and is not illegal in the UK, providing that the organisations of individuals are registered, often with the ICO, and are acting within the restrictions of the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act (RIPA). &#x27;Intelligence&#x27; is considered legally as &quot;information of all sorts gathered by a government or organisation to guide its decisions. It includes information that may be both public and private, obtained from much different public or secret sources. It could consist entirely of information from either publicly available or secret sources, or be a combination of the two.&quot;

However, espionage and intelligence can be linked. According to the MI5 website, &quot;foreign intelligence officers acting in the UK under diplomatic cover may enjoy immunity from prosecution. Such persons can only be tried for spying (or, indeed, any criminal offence) if diplomatic immunity is waived beforehand. Those officers operating without diplomatic cover have no such immunity from prosecution&quot;.

There are also laws surrounding government and organisational intelligence and surveillance. Generally, the body involved should be issued with some form of warrant or permission from the government and should be enacting their procedures in the interest of protecting national security or the safety of public citizens. Those carrying out intelligence missions should act within not only RIPA but also the Data Protection Act and Human Rights Act. However, there are spy equipment laws and legal requirements around intelligence methods that vary for each form of intelligence enacted.

=== War ===
In war, espionage is considered permissible as many nations recognize the inevitability of opposing sides seeking intelligence each about the dispositions of the other. To make the mission easier and successful, combatants wear disguises to conceal their true identity from the enemy while penetrating enemy lines for intelligence gathering. However, if they are caught behind enemy lines in disguises, they are not entitled to prisoner-of-war status and subject to prosecution and punishment—including execution.

The Hague Convention of 1907 addresses the status of wartime spies, specifically within &quot;Laws and Customs of War on Land&quot; (Hague IV); October 18, 1907: Chapter II Spies&quot;. Article 29 states that a person is considered a spy who, acts clandestinely or on false pretences, infiltrates enemy lines with the intention of acquiring intelligence about the enemy and communicate it to the belligerent during times of war. Soldiers who penetrate enemy lines in proper uniforms for the purpose of acquiring intelligence are not considered spies but are lawful combatants entitled to be treated as prisoners of war upon capture by the enemy. Article 30 states that a spy captured behind enemy lines may only be punished following a trial. However, Article 31 provides that if a spy successfully rejoined his own military and is then captured by the enemy as a lawful combatant, he cannot be punished for his previous acts of espionage and must be treated as a prisoner of war. This provision does not apply to citizens who committed treason against their own country or co-belligerents of that country and may be captured and prosecuted at any place or any time regardless whether he rejoined the military to which he belongs or not or during or after the war.

The ones that are excluded from being treated as spies while behind enemy lines are escaping prisoners of war and downed airmen as international law distinguishes between a disguised spy and a disguised escaper. It is permissible for these groups to wear enemy uniforms or civilian clothes in order to facilitate their escape back to friendly lines so long as they do not attack enemy forces, collect military intelligence, or engage in similar military operations while so disguised. Soldiers who are wearing enemy uniforms or civilian clothes simply for the sake of warmth along with other purposes rather than engaging in espionage or similar military operations while so attired are also excluded from being treated as unlawful combatants.

Saboteurs are treated as spies as they too wear disguises behind enemy lines for the purpose of waging destruction on an enemy&#x27;s vital targets in addition to intelligence gathering. For example, during World War II, eight German agents entered the U.S. in June 1942 as part of Operation Pastorius, a sabotage mission against U.S. economic targets. Two weeks later, all were arrested in civilian clothes by the FBI thanks to two German agents betraying the mission to the U.S. Under the Hague Convention of 1907, these Germans were classified as spies and tried by a military tribunal in Washington D.C. On August 3, 1942, all eight were found guilty and sentenced to death. Five days later, six were executed by electric chair at the District of Columbia jail. Two who had given evidence against the others had their sentences reduced by President Franklin D. Roosevelt to prison terms. In 1948, they were released by President Harry S. Truman and deported to the American Zone of occupied Germany.

The U.S. codification of enemy spies is Article 106 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice. This provides a mandatory death sentence if a person captured in the act is proven to be &quot;lurking as a spy or acting as a spy in or about any place, vessel, or aircraft, within the control or jurisdiction of any of the armed forces, or in or about any shipyard, any manufacturing or industrial plant, or any other place or institution engaged in work in aid of the prosecution of the war by the United States, or elsewhere&quot;.

== Spy fiction ==
Spies have long been favorite topics for novelists and filmmakers. An early example of espionage literature is &quot;Kim&quot; by the English novelist Rudyard Kipling, with a description of the training of an intelligence agent in the Great Game between the UK and Russia in 19th century Central Asia. An even earlier work was James Fenimore Cooper&#x27;s classic novel, &quot;The Spy,&quot; written in 1821, about an American spy in New York during the Revolutionary War.

During the many 20th-century spy scandals, much information became publicly known about national spy agencies and dozens of real-life secret agents. These sensational stories piqued public interest in a profession largely off-limits to human interest news reporting, a natural consequence of the secrecy inherent in their work. To fill in the blanks, the popular conception of the secret agent has been formed largely by 20th and 21st-century fiction and film. Attractive and sociable real-life agents such as Valerie Plame find little employment in serious fiction, however. The fictional secret agent is more often a loner, sometimes amoral—an existential hero operating outside the everyday constraints of society. Loner spy personalities may have been a stereotype of convenience for authors who already knew how to write loner private investigator characters that sold well from the 1920s to the present.

Johnny Fedora achieved popularity as a fictional agent of early Cold War espionage, but James Bond is the most commercially successful of the many spy characters created by intelligence insiders during that struggle. Other fictional agents include Le Carré&#x27;s George Smiley, and Harry Palmer as played by Michael Caine.

Jumping on the spy bandwagon, other writers also started writing about spy fiction featuring female spies as protagonists, such as &quot;The Baroness&quot;, which has more graphic action and sex, as compared to other novels featuring male protagonists.

Spy fiction has permeated the video game world as well, in games such as &quot;Perfect Dark&quot;, &quot;GoldenEye 007&quot;, &quot;No One Lives Forever&quot;, &quot;Tom Clancy&#x27;s Splinter Cell&quot; and the &quot;Metal Gear&quot; series.

Espionage has also made its way into comedy depictions. The 1960s TV series &quot;Get Smart&quot;, the 1983 Finnish film &quot;Agent 000 and the Deadly Curves&quot;, and &quot;Johnny English&quot; film trilogy portrays an inept spy, while the 1985 movie &quot;Spies Like Us&quot; depicts a pair of none-too-bright men sent to the Soviet Union to investigate a missile.

The historical novel &quot;The Emperor and the Spy&quot; highlights the adventurous life of U.S. Colonel Sidney Forrester Mashbir, who during the 1920s and 1930s attempted to prevent war with Japan, and when war did erupt, he became General MacArthur&#x27;s top advisor in the Pacific Theater of World War Two.

Black Widow is also a fictional agent who was introduced as a Russian spy, an antagonist of the superhero Iron Man. She later became an agent of the fictional spy agency S.H.I.E.L.D. and a member of the superhero team the Avengers.

Real espionage is actually quite boring work.

As a result, the dollar is the currency that many companies must use... to do international business.&quot; (p. 150.) &quot;[L]ocal banks facilitating that trade... normally... buy U.S. dollars and then use dollars to buy [another local currency]. To do so, however, the banks must have access to the U.S. financial system and... follow rules laid out by Washington.&quot; (pp. 151–152.) &quot;But there is another, lesser-known reason why the [U.S.] commands overwhelming economic power. Most of the world&#x27;s fiber-optic cables, which carry data and messages around the planet, travel through the United States.&quot; (p. 152.) &quot;[T]he U.S. government has installed &#x27;splitters&#x27;: prisms that divide the beams of light carrying information into two streams. One... goes on to the intended recipients, ... the other goes to the National Security Agency, which then uses high-powered computation to analyze the data. As a result, the [U.S.] can monitor almost all international communication.&quot; (p. 154) This has allowed the U.S. &quot;to effectively cut Iran out of the world financial system... Iran&#x27;s economy stagnated... Eventually, Tehran agreed to cut back its nuclear programs in exchange for relief.&quot; (pp. 153–154.) &quot;[A] few years ago, American officials... were in a panic about [the Chinese company] Huawei... which... seemed poised to supply 5G equipment to much of the planet [thereby possibly] giv[ing] China the power to eavesdrop on the rest of the world – just as the [U.S.] has done... The [U.S.] learned that Huawei had been dealing surreptitiously with Iran – and therefore violating U.S. sanctions. Then, it... used its special access to information on international bank data to [show] that [Huawei]&#x27;s chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou (... the founder&#x27;s daughter), had committed bank fraud by falsely telling the British financial services company HSBC that her company was not doing business with Iran. Canadian authorities, acting on a U.S. request, arrested her... in December 2018. After... almost three years under house arrest... Meng... was allowed to return to China... But by [then] the prospects for Chinese dominance of 5G had vanished...&quot; (pp. 154–155.) Farrell and Newman, writes Krugman, &quot;are worried about the possibility of [U.S. &quot;Underground Empire&quot;] overreach. [I]f the [U.S.] weaponizes the dollar against too many countries, they might... band together and adopt alternative methods of international payment. If countries become deeply worried about U.S. spying, they could lay fiber-optic cables that bypass the [U.S.]. And if Washington puts too many restrictions on American exports, foreign firms might turn away from U.S. technology.&quot; (p. 155.)

<text>Exile is a series of role-playing video games created by Jeff Vogel of Spiderweb Software. They were released as shareware titles for Macintosh and Windows systems. &quot;Exile III&quot; was also ported to Linux by a third party. There were four games released in the series. All of the games were later revived in the &quot;Avernum&quot; series. Common to all games in the &quot;Exile&quot; series are 2D graphics and basic sound. The graphics in the first versions of &quot;Exile I&quot; and &quot;II&quot; had simple textures, colours and outlines, which were then replaced in later versions with &quot;Exile III&quot;″s graphics. The games are designed to be non-linear and long in gameplay length.

==Gameplay==
In each game, the player is required to create six characters to form a party of adventurers or may instead use a default party. The characters&#x27; general, combat, magic and miscellaneous skills can be customized along with the character names and graphics. From &quot;Exile II&quot; onward, characters can have their traits and race configured.

The games have three modes including Outdoor Mode, Town Mode and Combat Mode. In Outdoor Mode, the party can enter a town, engage a group of enemies in Combat Mode and rest (if the party has food). In Town Mode, the party can talk to people, purchase from shops (provided they have enough gold), train the characters (provided they have sufficient gold and skill points), find sub-quests, pick up items (from &quot;Exile 2&quot; onward, items can be stolen) and enter Combat Mode. In Combat Mode, the party can attack enemies, defend themselves and pick up adjacent items. Combat Mode can be ended at any time in towns, but can only end outdoors when all enemies are killed.

Magic is divided into Mage and Priest spell types. Spells for attacking can only be cast in Combat Mode. Some spells, such as Light spells, can be cast at any time. Other spells can only be cast outdoors or in town when not in Combat Mode. Players can create a character equipped with spells up to level 3, but higher level or certain spells must be purchased or found in special encounters.

==Games==

===&quot;Exile I: Escape from the Pit&quot;===
The first game of the &quot;Exile&quot; trilogy released in January 1995 sees a party of newly created characters thrown from the world above into the subterranean world known as Exile. Once here, the party discovers a civilization formed from the outcasts of the Empire above, a culture beset by constant warfare and monsters galore. The party meets with many of those who wish to get revenge on the Empire for the wrongs it has done to the peoples of Exile.

The characters become a rallying point around which the people of Exile who desire vengeance gather to focus their energies into finding a way to strike back against the cruel Emperor of the surface. Together, the party manages to assassinate Emperor Hawthorne in his throne room, banish the demon king Grah-hoth who was becoming a significant threat to the citizens of Exile, and secure an escape route to the surface.

===&quot;Exile II: Crystal Souls&quot;===
The second &quot;Exile&quot; game follows directly from the first, released in November 1996. The Empire has begun to recognise the threat the Exiles pose and begin sending their army down into Exile in huge numbers. To make matters worse, unknown barriers of energy are sprouting up around the world – sometimes aiding the Exiles, sometimes helping the Empire who can afford the losses much more easily than the Exiles.

A new party of characters meets one of the creatures causing the barriers sprouting up in Exile and go to meet with the unknown race to negotiate. In the end, the party is more successful - and the Vahnatai joins with the Exiles to drive out the Empire. With the support of the Vahnatai the Exiles turn the tables on the Empire and successfully repulse their invasion.

===&quot;Exile III: Ruined World&quot;===
The final release in the &quot;Exile&quot; trilogy takes place some time after &quot;Exile II&quot;, released in January 1997. The Linux version was ported by Boutell.com in Summer, 2000. A lot of preparation has taken place and now the Exiles are ready to send a selected few back into the light of the surface. However, while the members of the expedition are at first stunned by the sheer beauty of the land around them, they begin to notice that things are not as perfect as they seem. The slimes the party encounters are only the first part of what becomes a series of monsters and terrible occurrences that are blighting the Empire and laying it to waste.

While scouting the land, as were the expedition members&#x27; orders from the nation of Exile, the members are asked by the Empire to help save the surface from its blight. They bring the Exiles and the Empire together as allies trying to find the cause of the destruction.

===&quot;Blades of Exile&quot;===
&quot;Blades of Exile&quot; was released in December 1997, consisting of three short scenarios set after the main trilogy as well as an editor that allows players to create their own scenarios, which need not be set in the &quot;Exile&quot; game world at all. Several hundred custom-made scenarios have been designed since the release of the game in 1997. The most prominent meeting places on the web of the &quot;Blades of Exile&quot; community are the official company-hosted internet forum. These forums offer support for beginning designers and players, reviews of new scenarios and general discussions about the use of the scenario editor. In June 2007, Jeff Vogel released the source code and game content for &quot;Blades of Exile&quot;, which is currently under version 2 of the GNU General Public License.

==Release==
On December 1, 1998, the first three &quot;Exile&quot; games also came packaged on a CD called the &quot;Exile Trilogy CD&quot;. As of July 8, 2013, these games are freeware on Spiderweb Software&#x27;s website.

==Reception==
Reviews described the &quot;Exile&quot; trilogy as a &quot;throwback&quot; to old fashioned role-playing games, with deep, complex gameplay and simplistic graphics. &quot;Computer Games Strategy Plus&quot; rated &quot;Exile: Escape from the Pit&quot; three and a half out of five stars, calling it &quot;one of the year&#x27;s best shareware games.&quot; The reviewer dropped a half star for its &quot;primitive graphics&quot; but found the game addictive and recommended it to veteran players &quot;hungry for good, old fashioned fantasy role-playing games&quot;. &quot;Inside Mac Games&quot; rated &quot;Exile&quot; four out of five, calling it an Ultima-style role-playing game that required &quot;patience and thoroughness&quot; and had slightly &quot;cheesy&quot; graphics and sound. &quot;Inside Mac Games&quot; named &quot;Exile&quot; as runner up to &quot;Heroes of Might and Magic: A Strategic Quest&quot; for the best role-playing game of 1996.

&quot;Inside Mac Games&quot; awarded &quot;Exile II&quot; 4 out 5 and said that it carried on &quot;Exile&quot; tradition as &quot;truly a high quality Shareware game&quot;. A subsequent &quot;Inside Mac Games&quot; review said &quot;Exile II: Crystal Souls&quot; had &quot;a size, scope and depth of plot unmatched in Macintosh role-playing games.&quot; &quot;Exile II: Crystal Souls&quot; was an honorable mention for &quot;MacUser&quot;″s award for the best shareware game of 1996, behind winner &quot;Escape Velocity&quot;. 

&quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; said that &quot;Exile III: Ruined World&quot; appears at first to be &quot;a shareware game with primitive graphics&quot; but reveals itself to be a &quot;remarkably deep&quot; traditional role-playing game with deceptive complexity. The reviewer praised the &quot;well written and witty&quot; NPC dialogue and elegant interface. Emil Pagliarulo reviewed &quot;Exile III&quot; positively for the &quot;Adrenaline Vault&quot;, rating the game four out of five stars and calling it an &quot;engrossing, thoroughly entertaining [...] epic computer role-playing game&quot; with simplistic presentation and &quot;enormous depth&quot;. &quot;Inside Mac Games&quot; rated &quot;Exile III&quot; 4 out of 5, saying that despite superficial similarities to previous games in the series, &quot;enough new features, situations and challenges&quot; would keep newcomers and veterans interested. The review concluded that &quot;Exile III&quot; was &quot;more of the same old thing: inexpensive, challenging, interesting, exciting and entertaining.&quot; &quot;Inside Mac Games&quot; called &quot;Exile III&quot; &quot;huge&quot; and &quot;highly detailed&quot;, with quality graphics, &quot;an elegant interface&quot;, and &quot;one of the largest and most detailed worlds and plots a fantasy role-playing game has offered&quot;. &quot;Exile III&quot; received the 1998 ZDNet Shareware Game of the Year award, selected by the editors of Ziff-Davis magazines &quot;FamilyPC&quot;, &quot;PC Magazine&quot;, and &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot;.

&quot;Inside Mac Games&quot; awarded &quot;Blades of Exile&quot; 3 out of 5, calling it &quot;a nice, solid CRPG&quot; that offered value for money and ran bug-free. The reviewer found the introductory scenario lacking in story, with too much repetitive combat and &quot;plot-checks that have the potential to really aggravate&quot;.

==&quot;Avernum&quot;==

Spiderweb Software has remade the &quot;Exile&quot; trilogy twice. The games were remade in 2000–2002 as the &quot;First Trilogy&quot; of the &quot;Avernum&quot; series, which replaced the two-dimensional tile-based graphics system of &quot;Exile&quot; with an isometric one and made numerous changes to the RPG system and some changes to the content. The remakes were followed by a remake of &quot;Blades of Exile&quot;, &quot;Blades of Avernum&quot;, in 2004. The &quot;Exile&quot; trilogy was rebooted for a second time with the release of &quot;&quot; (2011), &quot;Avernum 2: Crystal Souls&quot; (2015), and &quot;Avernum 3: Ruined World&quot; (2018); the remakes featured an enhanced game engine and expanded storylines.

==Engine and interface==
While the game engine itself remained relatively similar between all games in the series, the interface went through many changes. Each iteration sported a new layout and color scheme, as well the individual elements, like the inventory and character roster boxes, were also changed to display information differently. Between &quot;Exile I&quot; and &quot;Exile II&quot; the most notable difference is a background color change as well as a change to the border of the play window. Between &quot;Exile II&quot; and &quot;Exile III&quot; the interface was changed significantly in that the colors and window styles were changed again but the player roster was overhauled and an inventory window was added. The changes between &quot;Exile III&quot; and &quot;Blades of Exile&quot; were more subtle and were again of the color and style nature.

<text>was the 65th emperor of Japan, according to the traditional order of succession.

Kazan&#x27;s reign spanned the years from 984 through 986.

==Biography==
Before his ascension to the Chrysanthemum Throne, his personal name (&quot;imina&quot;) was Morosada&quot;-shinnō&quot; (師貞親王).

Morasada was the eldest son of Emperor Reizei. The prince&#x27;s mother was Fujiwara no Kaneko/&quot;Kaishi&quot; (藤原懐子), who was a daughter of &quot;sesshō&quot; Fujiwara no Koretada. Morasada was also the brother of Emperor Sanjō.

==Events of Kazan&#x27;s life==

Prince Morasada was seventeen years of age at the time of the succession.

* October 6, 984 (&quot;Eikan 1, 27th day of the 8th month&quot;): In the 15th year of Emperor En&#x27;yu&#x27;s reign (円融天皇十五年), he abdicated; and the succession (&quot;senso&quot;) was received by a nephew. Shortly thereafter, Emperor Kazan is said to have acceded to the throne (&quot;sokui&quot;).

He commissioned the Shūi Wakashū.

* 985 (&quot;Kanna 1, 4th month&quot;): Fujiwara no Tokiakira and his brother, Yasusuke, contended with Fujiwara no Sukitaka and Ōe-no Masahira in a sword fight in Kyoto. Masahira lost the fingers of his left hand. The two brothers fled; and after careful searching, Tokiakira was eventually located in Ōmi Province.

He faced a tough political struggle from the Fujiwara family; and at the age of nineteen, he was manipulated into abandoning the throne by Fujiwara no Kaneie. Kaneie told him that Ichijo (Kaneie&#x27;s maternal grandson) already held the Regalia, and that there was no purpose in Kazan continuing to rule. Under some pressure, Kazan acquiesced, and went to the Gangyō-ji temple. He was accompanied by Kaneie&#x27;s second son, Michikane, who was also to enter religion. When they arrived, however, Michikane said he would like to see his parents one final time while he was still a layman. Michikane never came back.

* 986 (&quot;Kanna 2, 6th month&quot;): Kazan abdicated, and took up residence at Gangyō-ji where he became a Buddhist monk; and his new priestly name was Nyūkaku.
* August 23, 986 (&quot;Kanna 2, 16th day of the 7th month&quot;): Iyasada&quot;-shinnō&quot; was appointed as heir and crown prince at age 11. This followed the convention that two imperial lineages took the throne in turn, although Emperor Ichijō was in fact Iyasada&#x27;s junior. He thus gained the nickname &quot;Sakasa-no moke-no kimi&quot; (the imperial heir in reverse). When Emperor Kanzan abandoned the world for holy orders, one grandson of Kaneie ascended to the throne as Emperor Ichijō (the 66th sovereign); and in due course, another grandson would follow on the throne as Emperor Sanjō (the 67th sovereign).

Nyūkaku went on various pilgrimages and &#x27;re-founded&#x27; the Saigoku Kannon Pilgrimage, which was established in the early 8th century by a monk to the name of Tokudo Shonin. This pilgrimage involves travelling to 33 locations across the eight provinces of the Western Japan.

Some scholars doubt that Kazan, in his unstable mental condition at the time was involved with the founding of the pilgrimage, thereby leaving all of the credit to Shonin.

It is suggested by many scholars that the mental health of Kazan, particularly in later life, was not stable; and therefore, living as a monk may have caused deteriorating behavior.

&quot;Daijō-tennō&quot; Kazan died at the age of 41 on the 8th day of the 2nd month of the fifth year of &quot;Kankō&quot; (1008).

The actual site of Kazan&#x27;s grave is known. This emperor is traditionally venerated at a memorial Shinto shrine (&quot;misasagi&quot;) at Kyoto.

The Imperial Household Agency designates this location as Kazan&#x27;s mausoleum. It is formally named &quot;Kamiya no hotori no misasagi&quot;.

He is buried amongst the &quot;Seven Imperial Tombs&quot; at Ryōan-ji Temple in Kyoto. The mound which commemorates the Hosokawa Emperor Kazan is today named &quot;Kinugasa-yama.&quot; The emperor&#x27;s burial place would have been quite humble in the period after Kazan died. These tombs reached their present state as a result of the 19th century restoration of imperial sepulchers (&quot;misasagi&quot;) which were ordered by Emperor Meiji.

===Kugyō===
 is a collective term for the very few most powerful men attached to the court of the Emperor of Japan in pre-Meiji eras.

In general, this elite group included only three to four men at a time. These were hereditary courtiers whose experience and background have brought them to the pinnacle of a life&#x27;s career. During Kazan&#x27;s reign, this apex of the &quot;Daijō-kan&quot; included: 
* &quot;Kampaku&quot;, Fujiwara no Yoritada, 924–989.
* &quot;Daijō-daijin&quot;, Fujiwara no Yoritada.
* &quot;Sadaijin&quot;, Fujiwara no Kaneie, 929–990.
* &quot;Naidaijin&quot; (not appointed)
* &quot;Dainagon&quot;

==Eras of Kazan&#x27;s reign==
The years of Kazan&#x27;s reign are more specifically identified by more than one era name or &quot;nengō&quot;.
* &quot;Eikan&quot; (983–985)
* &quot;Kanna&quot; (985–986)

<text>Declan Patrick MacManus (born 25 August 1954), better known by his stage name Elvis Costello, is an English singer, songwriter, record producer, author and television host. According to &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Costello &quot;reinvigorated the literate, lyrical traditions of Bob Dylan and Van Morrison with the raw energy and sass that were principal ethics of punk&quot;, noting the &quot;construction of his songs, which set densely layered wordplay in an ever-expanding repertoire of styles.&quot; His first album, &quot;My Aim Is True&quot; (1977), spawned no hit singles, but contains some of Costello&#x27;s best-known songs, including the ballad &quot;Alison&quot;. Costello&#x27;s next two albums, &quot;This Year&#x27;s Model&quot; (1978) and &quot;Armed Forces&quot; (1979), recorded with his backing band the Attractions, helped define the new wave genre. From late 1977 until early 1980, each of the eight singles he released reached the UK Top 30. His biggest hit single, &quot;Oliver&#x27;s Army&quot; (1979), sold more than 500,000 copies in Britain. He has had more modest commercial success in the US, but has earned much critical praise. From 1977 until the early 2000s, Costello&#x27;s albums regularly ranked high on the &quot;Village Voice&quot; Pazz &amp; Jop critics&#x27; poll, with &quot;This Year&#x27;s Model&quot; and &quot;Imperial Bedroom&quot; (1982) voted the best album of their respective years. His biggest US hit single, &quot;Veronica&quot; (1989), reached number 19 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100.

Born into a musical family, Costello was raised with knowledge and appreciation of a wide range of musical styles and an insider&#x27;s view of the music business. His opportunity to begin a professional career as a musician coincided with the rise of punk rock in England. The primitivism brought into fashion by punk led Costello to disguise his musical savvy at the beginning of his career, but his stylistic range has come to encompass R&amp;B, country, jazz, baroque pop, Tin Pan Alley and classical music. He has released album-length collaborations with the classical ensemble the Brodsky Quartet, the New Orleans R&amp;B songwriter and producer Allen Toussaint and the hip-hop group the Roots. Costello has written more than a dozen songs with Paul McCartney and had a long-running songwriting partnership with Burt Bacharach.

Costello has had hits with covers of songs, including Sam &amp; Dave&#x27;s &quot;I Can&#x27;t Stand Up for Falling Down&quot;, Jerry Chesnut&#x27;s &quot;Good Year for the Roses&quot; and Charles Aznavour&#x27;s &quot;She&quot;. One of the songs he is best known for, &quot;(What&#x27;s So Funny &#x27;Bout) Peace, Love, and Understanding&quot;, was written by Nick Lowe and recorded by Lowe&#x27;s group Brinsley Schwarz in 1974, but remained obscure until Costello released his version in 1979. Costello&#x27;s own songs have been recorded by artists including Linda Ronstadt, George Jones, Roy Orbison, Johnny Cash, Dave Edmunds, Chet Baker and Alison Krauss.

Costello has won two Grammy awards, two Ivor Novello awards, four Edison awards, an MTV Video Music Award, a BAFTA award, an ASCAP Founders award and a Gemini award. In 2003, he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. In 2016, he was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame. From 2008 to 2010, he hosted a television show, &quot;&quot;, on which he interviewed other musicians. In 2015, he published a well-received memoir, &quot;Unfaithful Music &amp; Disappearing Ink&quot;.

==Early life==
Elvis Costello was born Declan Patrick MacManus, on 25 August 1954, at St Mary&#x27;s Hospital in Paddington, West London, the only child of a record shop worker and a jazz musician. Both parents were from the Liverpool area and had moved to London together a few years earlier. Costello&#x27;s father was of Irish descent and a Catholic, while his mother is English and was raised a Congregationalist.

=== Family background ===

Costello&#x27;s mother, Lillian MacManus (née Ablett, 1927–2021), was born and raised in Toxteth, Liverpool, the daughter of a gas-main layer and a mother who became increasingly disabled by rheumatoid arthritis as Lillian grew up. Responsible for caring for her younger brother and sick mother, Lillian left school at 13 and took the first of a series of jobs at music stores. After moving to London with her future husband Ross in 1951, she took a job in the record department in Selfridges department store and continued selling records through the 1960s. Even after she no longer worked selling records, Lillian maintained a keen interest in a wide variety of music, including the popular music of the day.

Costello&#x27;s father, Ross MacManus (1927–2011), was a professional trumpet player and singer, born and raised in Birkenhead, across the River Mersey from Liverpool. He began his career in music in the late 1940s, playing trumpet in bebop bands in Birkenhead and Liverpool. He segued to playing trumpet and singing in modern jazz bands after moving to London in 1951. By 1954, he was sufficiently well known for his son&#x27;s birth to be announced in the &quot;New Musical Express&quot;. From 1955 to 1968, he was a featured singer in Joe Loss Orchestra, one of Britain&#x27;s most popular big bands. Ross had a solo cabaret act from 1969 through the 1990s, playing workingmen&#x27;s social clubs in the North of England, Scotland, and Wales. Ross recorded for small record labels under a variety of aliases, including Day Costello – Costello being Ross&#x27;s paternal grandmother&#x27;s maiden name. He also recorded advertising jingles. In 1973, he sang the &quot;Secret Lemonade Drinker&quot; jingle featured in a series of advertisements for R. Whites, with Costello on backing vocals.

Ross&#x27;s father, Patrick Matthew McManus, known as Pat, was also a professional musician. Pat was raised in an orphanage from age eight, where he learned to play trumpet. He later played trumpet as an army bandsman, a ship&#x27;s musician for the White Star Line, and an orchestra musician in music halls and in theaters showing silent films. Costello has said that Pat, being the first in the family to make a career in music, is the reason he himself is a musician.

=== Childhood and early musical influences ===

Costello spent most of his childhood in Twickenham, in west London, before moving to Liverpool with his mother in 1970. Costello was raised Roman Catholic and served as an altar boy until he was 14.

Costello&#x27;s parents had separated by the time Costello was ten years old, after which he was raised by his mother. Ross continued to be a significant presence in Costello&#x27;s life and the two remained close until Ross&#x27;s death in 2011. Costello has said that a childhood spent watching his father work gave him an innate sense of how to be a musician but also an understanding that a career in music was a job like any other, requiring discipline and hard work.

Costello&#x27;s parents never insisted he take music lessons or otherwise pushed him to follow in the family business. Instead, they raised him in a home filled with music, encouraged his musical curiosity, and supported his efforts to find his own way toward a career in music. Lillian told journalists that she knew before he was born he would have a career in music and that she listened to a broad range of music while she was pregnant with him with the intention of giving him an early start in music appreciation.

As a young child, Costello&#x27;s musical influences came from his parents&#x27; record collection, which encompassed a wide range of styles but centred on traditional pop and jazz. Ross&#x27;s job with the Joe Loss Orchestra required him to sing many of the pop hits of the day for the band&#x27;s weekly radio show. To learn these songs, Ross received demonstration copies of the original artists&#x27; records, which he brought home to rehearse. When Costello grew old enough to have an interest in the current pop hits, Ross began giving him five or six of these demonstration records per week. Costello has said, &quot;That&#x27;s why I know so many songs.&quot;

Chief among Costello&#x27;s early favourites among the hit-makers of the day were the Beatles. Costello has said that, having turned nine years old in 1963, he was exactly the right age to experience the full force of Beatles fandom as he grew up. He has described the Beatles as his biggest musical influence. Costello was also deeply impressed by the songs of his future collaborator Burt Bacharach, which he knew through the hits British artists Cilla Black and Dusty Springfield had with them.

As Costello grew into his teens, his favourites included British beat groups the Kinks, Small Faces and the Who, Jamaican rocksteady and reggae acts who were popular in Britain, and especially Motown artists, who he knew mainly through their British hit singles and through the Motown Chartbusters compilation series. By the time Costello reached his mid-teens, Joni Mitchell had become an important and enduring influence on him. When Costello moved to Liverpool, he found he did not enjoy much of the progressive rock that was popular with his peers, so, casting around for music he might like, he developed an interest in the Grateful Dead and other folk rock groups like the Byrds and the Band, and through them, country music.

=== Education and decision to pursue a career in music ===

Costello was a well-behaved if sometimes argumentative student, but not generally an academically outstanding one. Not having scored well enough on his eleven-plus exams to go on to grammar school, he attended Archbishop Myers secondary modern school in Hounslow and then a comprehensive school in Everton, Liverpool, for sixth form. Costello did, however, show an early talent for writing. His mother told a journalist that, when Costello was 11 years old, his school entered him into a writing contest held by &quot;The Times&quot; intended for people aged 16 to 25, for which he won a prize. As he finished secondary school, he earned one A-level, in English, despite having made a firm decision to pursue a career in music a few months earlier and putting little effort into his final months of school.

Although he never had any alternative career plan, Costello had previously been reluctant to commit to a career in music, partly because his upbringing had made him aware of the potential pitfalls involved. The shock of witnessing a teenage friend&#x27;s death in a traffic accident changed his mind. He would later write, &quot;Suddenly, everything but music seemed like a waste of precious time.&quot;

Costello completed his formal education in 1972 and, still living at home with his mother, set out to find a job that would earn him a steady wage while he pursued a career in music. He soon took a job as a computer operator at the Midland Bank data centre, in the Merseyside town of Bootle, because, at £20 a week, it paid slightly better than other unskilled work he felt he was qualified for. According to Costello, the job consisted of essentially manual labour such as mounting tape reels and loading punched cards. Because the job involved frequent periods of waiting for the mainframe computers to complete their tasks before beginning them on the next one, it gave Costello time to write songs while at work. Except for a few months in 1973 when he worked as a clerk at the Midland Bank Putney branch, he continued to work full-time as a computer operator until a few weeks before his first album was released in July 1977.

== Music career ==
=== 1969–1976: Pre-professional career ===
Costello began writing songs and teaching himself to play guitar by age 14. To test his songs in front of an audience, he performed them in folk clubs that permitted amateur musicians to perform unpaid. He played these clubs regularly in London and continued in similar clubs when he moved to Liverpool at age 16, although folk music venues that welcomed original songs were scarcer in Liverpool than in London. By 17, he was occasionally being paid a little money. On the eve of the release of his debut album in 1977, Costello told a journalist that by that time he had written hundreds of songs.

==== Rusty ====
At the beginning of 1972, Costello was invited to join a folk-rock band called Rusty by the band&#x27;s founder, an 18-year-old veteran of the Liverpool music scene named Allan Mayes. As other members left, Rusty soon became a duo, with Mayes and Costello singing and playing acoustic guitars. For a little over a year, Rusty played regularly in small venues like pubs, clubs, schools, and community centres, mostly in and around Liverpool, unpaid or for small amounts of money. In Mayes&#x27;s estimation, Costello was already a talented songwriter, able to quickly write songs in a variety of styles, and could sing like Neil Young or Robbie Robertson. Mayes has said he introduced Costello to Brinsley Schwarz, a band that would be an important influence on him. While in Rusty, Costello wrote an early version of a song he would record in 1980 as &quot;Ghost Train&quot;, although by then little remained of the Rusty version except the central narrative idea of a married double act making their way through the low end of show business. In 2022, Costello reunited with Mayes to record and release an EP called &quot;The Resurrection of Rust&quot;. The EP contained songs that were typical of Rusty&#x27;s shows in 1972, including the early version of &quot;Ghost Train&quot;, then called &quot;Maureen and Sam&quot;.

==== Declan Costello ====
By early 1973, Costello had determined that the music scene in Liverpool was too small to support his ambition to have a career in music, so he arranged to transfer from his job as a computer operator in the Midland Bank data centre in Bootle to a position as a clerk at the bank&#x27;s Putney branch. Returning to London, Costello moved into the same Twickenham flat where he had lived with his mother a few years earlier, by then occupied by his father (Ross), Ross&#x27;s second wife, and their infant son. When booking himself into London clubs, he began using the name Declan Costello, adopting a family name that Ross had once made a record under, because it was easier to spell and understand than MacManus when he spoke on the phone. Around this time, Costello accompanied Ross to Costello&#x27;s first professional recording session, for the R. White&#x27;s &quot;Secret Lemonade Drinker&quot; commercial jingle. Ross sang the lead vocal while Costello played guitar and sang backing vocals.

==== Flip City ====
In the second half of 1973, Costello formed a band called Flip City with several slightly older men who, like him, were fans of Brinsley Schwarz and other pub rock bands. The members of Flip City also shared Costello&#x27;s enthusiasm for The Band, the Grateful Dead, and Clover. For most of 1974, Costello shared a rented house in southwest London with some of his bandmates. Flip City played the London pub rock circuit until the end of 1975, occasionally opening for more prominent bands such as Dr. Feelgood, but generally making little money and attracting little notice. Flip City&#x27;s performances consisted of a mix of Costello&#x27;s original songs and covers of rock, R&amp;B, and country songs. Their repertoire of Costello originals included early versions of songs that would appear on his first two albums as &quot;Pay It Back&quot;, &quot;Miracle Man&quot;, &quot;Living in Paradise&quot;, and &quot;Radio Radio&quot;. Costello wrote all but one of Flip City&#x27;s original songs, did most of the singing, and chose the cover songs they played. A friend from those days later told a journalist, &quot;It wasn&#x27;t so much that he imposed the ideas; he was the one who &quot;had&quot; the ideas.&quot; None of the other members of Flip City shared Costello&#x27;s commitment to pursuing a career in music and some disapproved of his desire to make money from his music.

Costello became engaged to marry a former schoolmate in late 1973. By then he had found a job as a computer operator at the Elizabeth Arden cosmetics factory in North Acton, in northwest London, similar to the one he had in Bootle and with similarly low wages. By early 1975, Costello was a husband and father and was struggling to support his family. Flip City&#x27;s live engagements added little to his income, rarely paying more than the band&#x27;s expenses.

Costello recorded demos with Flip City at several sessions from mid-1974 until mid-1975, hoping to use them to get live bookings, secure a recording contract, or sell Costello&#x27;s songs for other artists to record. All but the first of these sessions were at a small studio owned by Dave Robinson, future Stiff Records founder. Robinson later said that he thought Flip City &quot;could not play at all&quot; but Costello was talented and ought to &quot;find a real band.&quot;

After Costello became successful, Flip City&#x27;s demos were widely bootlegged, often misleadingly labelled to imply they were outtakes from the &quot;My Aim Is True&quot; sessions or otherwise affiliated with Stiff Records. The only Flip City recording to have been officially released is Costello&#x27;s song &quot;Imagination (Is a Powerful Deceiver)&quot;, recorded in early 1975, which appeared as a bonus track on the 1993 and 2001 reissues of &quot;My Aim Is True&quot;. In the liner notes to the 2001 reissue, Costello wrote that, in retrospect, the song sounded to him like &quot;a very early attempt to write a song like &#x27;Alison&#x27;.&quot;

==== D.P. Costello ====
Even before disbanding Flip City in late 1975, Costello was writing songs he did not include in the band&#x27;s repertoire. He recorded some of these as solo demos for Dave Robinson in mid-1975. For the next year, he shopped these and other solo demos to music publishers and record companies, hoping to be hired either as a songwriter or a recording artist. He sent out as many as 20 songs on a single tape to publishers, not yet realising that no publisher would have the patience to listen to so many songs. Sometimes he went to publishers&#x27; offices to perform his songs in person. None of this generated anything but rejections until he began creating &quot;show reels&quot; of no more than six of what he believed were his most attention-getting songs, selected to appeal to the recipient of each demo tape.

By February 1976, Costello was booking himself into clubs as a solo act under the name D.P. Costello, D.P. being his initials and a nickname he was sometimes called by his family. While working as D.P. Costello, he learned to sing and play guitar very loudly and developed a forceful stage presence, although he was still playing to small audiences for very little money. Few of the songs he had played with Flip City were included in these performances. Instead, he was debuting some of the songs that would start to get the attention of the music industry, such as &quot;Mystery Dance&quot; and &quot;Wave a White Flag&quot;. Costello included both songs on a six-track demo tape he sent to London radio presenter Charlie Gillett, who thought &quot;Wave a White Flag&quot; was the best of the six. Gillett played several songs from the tape on his radio show later that year, the first time any Costello song received airplay.

Sometime in 1976, lack of money forced Costello, his wife and their toddler son to move in with relatives near Heathrow Airport, on the far west side of London. This meant Costello&#x27;s commute to work in North Acton took him past the Hoover Building in Perivale. Around the same time, he was starting to become aware of the nascent punk movement, although he would not hear any of the British punk bands until they began releasing records. He was, however, inspired by the Modern Lovers&#x27; song &quot;Roadrunner&quot;, with its reference to such quotidian landmarks as the Stop &amp; Shop, to write a song about the historical Art Deco building he rode past every day. Although he did not record it until 1980, Costello regarded this song, &quot;Hoover Factory&quot;, as an artistic breakthrough. In the period just prior, he had been trying to imitate songwriters Randy Newman and John Prine. &quot;Hoover Factory&quot;, he later recalled, got him &quot;through the door to a different, less ingratiating way of speaking&quot; in his songwriting. The next song he wrote was &quot;Radio Sweetheart&quot;, which would become the B-side of his first single.

=== 1976–1977: &quot;My Aim Is True&quot; ===

In mid-August 1976, Costello included &quot;Mystery Dance&quot; and &quot;Radio Sweetheart&quot; on a demo tape he gave to Stiff Records, a new independent label that had just released its first single. Partly due to the airplay received from Gillett around the same time, Costello was soon evaluating offers from several record companies, including Gillett&#x27;s own Oval Records. Costello chose to work with Stiff Records because they seemed prepared to move the fastest. Stiff had been founded by Jake Riviera, who managed several acts Costello admired, and Dave Robinson. Nick Lowe, whom Costello was on friendly terms with because he had attended so many performances by Lowe&#x27;s band Brinsley Schwarz, was the label&#x27;s first artist and soon became its in-house producer.

Following a successful test-session in mid-September at Pathway Studios, an inexpensive studio in North London, Stiff agreed to finance more sessions for Costello with Clover, an American country-rock band from Marin County, California, as the backing band. Starting in late November or early December, Costello travelled to Headley Grange in East Hampshire, where Clover were living, to spend the day rehearsing and working out arrangements for a batch of his songs and then recording the songs with the band the next day at Pathway. Costello still held a full-time office job, so the sessions were spaced over several weeks to accommodate his work schedule and Stiff&#x27;s tight finances. &quot;My Aim Is True&quot; was recorded and mixed in six four-hour sessions for a total cost of about £1,000. The final mix was completed in late January 1977. Producer Nick Lowe, recording engineer Barry Farmer and Clover bassist John Ciambotti have all said they found Costello confident, well-prepared, and mature beyond his years during the making of the album.

By February 1977, Riviera and Robinson, who were now Costello&#x27;s managers, had given him his new stage name, Elvis. The reference to Elvis Presley, who was still alive at the time, was simply intended to get attention. Costello neither particularly liked nor disliked Presley. Because Costello had seen his father, Ross, work under a variety of stage names, he gave little thought to the name change. Riviera and Robinson also helped give Costello a distinctive appearance that contrasted with the contemporaneous ideas how pop stars looked; they swapped the unobtrusive rimless glasses Costello had worn to correct astigmatism since he was a teenager for a pair with large black frames.

Costello&#x27;s first single, &quot;Less than Zero&quot;, was released at the end of March 1977. It received a few brief, mixed reviews in the British music press and sold very few copies. Two further singles, &quot;Alison&quot; and &quot;(The Angels Wanna Wear My) Red Shoes&quot;, also sold poorly; the former would become one of his best-regarded and best-known songs. However, Costello was receiving increasingly prominent, positive coverage in the British music press.

&quot;My Aim Is True&quot; had been completed since the end of January but its release was delayed, first because Stiff had wanted to release records by other artists who seemed more tied to transient music trends and then because of legal difficulties with Stiff&#x27;s distributor, Island Records. It was released on 22 July 1977. Two weeks earlier, Costello had left his job as a computer operator at Elizabeth Arden on the condition that Stiff pay him, as an advance on future royalties, a regular stipend equal to the wages he had been earning at his job.

=== 1977–1979: Peak pop stardom ===

In mid-June 1977, Costello held auditions for a bassist and keyboardist for a backing band for a tour to promote &quot;My Aim Is True&quot;, wanting a sparser sound than on the album. Pete Thomas, formerly of pub-rock band Chilli Willi and the Red Hot Peppers, who were managed by Riviera, agreed to be drummer, although Thomas was then living in California and needed to be brought back to England. Steve Goulding and Andrew Bodnar, rhythm section of the Rumour, also participated in these audition sessions, so that Costello could test how the musicians auditioning played as part of a band. Chosen were bassist Bruce Thomas (no relation to Pete), who was 28 years old and had ten years&#x27; experience in professional bands, the most successful being the Sutherland Brothers and Quiver; and keyboardist Steve Nieve (then Steve Nason), a 19-year-old student at the Royal College of Music who had formal musical training but no experience in any kind of pop group. The band, soon named the Attractions, would be Costello&#x27;s touring and recording band for the next seven years.

==== &quot;Watching the Detectives&quot; and commercial breakthrough ====
Costello used the time with Goulding and Bodnar to arrange and rehearse &quot;Watching the Detectives&quot;. He recorded the song with them at Pathway a few days later. Costello had written the song a few weeks earlier, partly inspired by the Clash&#x27;s newly released debut album. Some of the musical ideas, which Nieve fleshed out when he overdubbed his piano and organ parts a few weeks later, were inspired by film scores Bernard Herrmann had done for Alfred Hitchcock. Costello later called the recording of &quot;Watching the Detectives&quot; his first experience of &quot;making records as opposed to recording some songs in a room&quot;. The song would be released as a non-album single in the UK and as a track on the US version of &quot;My Aim Is True&quot;.

&quot;My Aim Is True&quot; received extensive, favourable coverage in the UK music press through a combination of effective publicity stunts, such as Costello busking in front of the London hotel hosting the CBS Records business convention, and genuine enthusiasm for his music among music journalists. The album reached number 14 on the UK Albums Chart within a few weeks of its release. &quot;Watching the Detectives&quot;, released in mid-October, reaching number 15 in the UK Singles Chart, becoming Costello&#x27;s first single to chart in any country. This was the first of an unbroken streak of eight Costello singles to reach the UK top 30. When Costello began touring the US in mid-November, he received prominent coverage in the US press, even though he played venues holding fewer than a thousand people. By this time, Costello had signed to Columbia Records, who released &quot;My Aim Is True&quot; in the US in early November. The album gradually climbed to number 32 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Top LPs &amp; Tape chart and was named among the best albums of the year by US music critics. In mid-December, Costello and the Attractions appeared on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, where they angered the show&#x27;s producer by unexpectedly playing the then-unrecorded song &quot;Radio Radio&quot; during the live broadcast.

By late 1977, Costello had moved from Stiff Records to Radar Records, a new label founded by an associate of Jake Riviera. Riviera had split from Dave Robinson and was now Costello&#x27;s sole manager. For the next year and a half, Costello&#x27;s records were released on Radar in Britain.

==== &quot;This Year&#x27;s Model&quot; ====

Costello recorded his second album and his first with the Attractions, &quot;This Year&#x27;s Model&quot;, during short breaks from touring, from November 1977 through January 1978. Produced by Nick Lowe, it was recorded at Eden Studios, in west London, in eleven days. Inspirations for the album&#x27;s sound included 1960s beat groups like the Who, the Kinks and Small Faces, as well as contemporary acts like Talking Heads, but the biggest influence was the Rolling Stones&#x27; album &quot;Aftermath&quot; (1966). Costello himself called &quot;This Year&#x27;s Model&quot; &quot;a ghost version of &quot;Aftermath&quot;&quot; and &quot;This Year&#x27;s Girl&quot; an answer song to the Rolling Stones&#x27; &quot;Stupid Girl&quot;.

Most of the songs on &quot;This Year&#x27;s Model&quot; were written while Costello was still working a full-time office job, before his first album was released. Among them was &quot;(I Don&#x27;t Want to Go to) Chelsea&quot;, which was released as the album&#x27;s first single in early March 1978, reaching number 16 on the UK Singles Chart. The second single, &quot;Pump It Up&quot;, which reached number 24, was written later, while Costello was on tour with other Stiff acts, in reaction to what he later called his &quot;first exposure to idiotic rock and roll decadence.&quot; Upon release in March, &quot;This Year&#x27;s Model&quot; entered the UK Albums Chart at number 4. The US version of the album dropped &quot;(I Don&#x27;t Want to Go to) Chelsea&quot; and &quot;Night Rally&quot;, a song written in response to the rise of the British National Front, and replaced them with &quot;Radio Radio&quot;. The US release reached number 30 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; chart but spent fewer weeks on the chart than &quot;My Aim Is True&quot;. &quot;Radio Radio&quot; was released as a non-album single in the UK in October 1978, where it reached number 29.

&quot;This Year&#x27;s Model&quot; was highly praised by critics in Britain and the US. &quot;Melody Maker&quot; called it an &quot;achievement so comprehensive, so inspired, that it exhausts superlatives.&quot; The &quot;NME&quot; review read similarly, saying the album was &quot;so ridiculously good that one&#x27;s immediate inclinations are to clamber effusively over the top, superlative peaking superlative.&quot; The &quot;Village Voice&quot; Pazz &amp; Jop critics&#x27; poll voted it the best album of 1978. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; named it among the best five albums of 1978.

For the seven months following the completion of &quot;This Year&#x27;s Model&quot;, Costello and the Attractions continued touring Britain, Europe and North America, playing larger venues and debuting new songs that Costello was writing for his next album. In July 1978, Costello performed at the Danish Roskilde Festival, topping the bill with three other artists, premiering the song &quot;Oliver&#x27;s Army&quot; that would become his biggest hit in the UK.

==== &quot;Armed Forces&quot; ====
Costello and the Attractions recorded his third album, &quot;Armed Forces&quot;, at Eden Studios in six weeks from August and September 1978. It was again produced by Nick Lowe, but Costello himself provided greater creative control. Like &quot;This Year&#x27;s Model&quot;, the album&#x27;s influences came from the music Costello and the Attractions listened to while touring, from the Berlin-era records of David Bowie and Iggy Pop to ABBA and Kraftwerk. Costello later said that &quot;Armed Forces&quot; was his first album of songs he wrote with an awareness of having an audience. The album&#x27;s lyrics reflected his experiences on the road in the US, as well his continued concern over the rise of far-right political groups in the UK; the album was originally to be called &quot;Emotional Fascism&quot;. Just before the album&#x27;s completion in late September, Costello and the Attractions played to an audience of 150,000 in Brockwell Park, south London, as part of the second Rock Against Racism music festival. A few weeks later, they began six months of touring that included, for the first time, Japan and Australia, as well as the UK, Europe, Canada and the US.

Released in early January 1979, &quot;Armed Forces&quot; debuted at number 2 on the UK Albums Chart, and spent 28 weeks on the chart. In the US, it spent 25 weeks on the &quot;Billboard&quot; chart, peaking at number 10 in mid-March. The US release replaced &quot;Sunday&#x27;s Best&quot; with Costello&#x27;s cover of Lowe&#x27;s &quot;(What&#x27;s So Funny &#x27;Bout) Peace, Love, and Understanding&quot;. Costello&#x27;s best-selling single, &quot;Oliver&#x27;s Army&quot;, was released in Britain in February. Costello has said he wrote the song after his first visit to Northern Ireland and was inspired by seeing young British soldiers on the streets of Belfast as a part of the Troubles. The song reached number 2 on the UK Singles Chart. It was also his biggest hit single in Ireland, reaching number 4 on the Irish singles chart. The second single, &quot;Accidents Will Happen&quot;, was released in early May. According to Costello, the song was written in response to his own marital infidelities. The song reached number 28 in the UK. In the US, it reached number 101, missing the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 but charting higher than any previous Costello single.

The concert tour promoting &quot;Armed Forces&quot; was marked by bad publicity. Costello and the Attractions played some shows that audiences considered too brief and refused to return for encores. Audiences in Sydney, Australia, and Berkeley, California, responded by vandalising the concert venues. After a concert in Columbus, Ohio, on 15 March, Costello got into a drunken argument at a hotel bar with members of the Stephen Stills band and entourage. The argument culminated in Costello disparaging James Brown and Ray Charles with racially charged insults, in comments he would later call &quot;the exact opposite of my true feelings&quot;. When Costello&#x27;s comments were reported in the press a few weeks later, the bad publicity was sufficiently severe and widespread to be regarded, including by Costello himself, as the reason he never achieved the top-level commercial success in the US that had been predicted for him.

In June, Costello had a hit as a songwriter when Dave Edmunds released his recording of &quot;Girls Talk&quot;, a song Costello had written but not yet recorded. Edmunds&#x27; version reached number 4 on the UK Singles Chart and number 65 on &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100.

===1980s===

Costello&#x27;s 1980 &quot;Get Happy!!&quot; album featured a sound based on vintage American soul music. Some songs marked a distinct change in mood from the angry, frustrated tone of his first three albums to a more upbeat, happy manner. The single, &quot;I Can&#x27;t Stand Up for Falling Down&quot;, was a rendition of a Sam and Dave song. Lyrically, the songs are full of Costello&#x27;s signature wordplay. His only 1980 appearance in North America was at the Heatwave festival in August near Toronto.

In January 1981, Costello released &quot;Trust&quot; amidst growing tensions within the Attractions. The single &quot;Watch Your Step&quot; was released in the US only and played live on Tom Snyder&#x27;s &quot;Tomorrow&quot; show, and received airplay on FM rock radio. In the UK, the single &quot;Clubland&quot; scraped the lower reaches of the UK Singles Chart; follow-up single &quot;From a Whisper to a Scream&quot; (a duet with Glenn Tilbrook of Squeeze) became the first Costello single in over four years to completely miss the chart. Costello also co-produced Squeeze&#x27;s 1981 album &quot;East Side Story&quot; (with Roger Béchirian) and performed backing vocals on the group&#x27;s hit &quot;Tempted&quot;.

October saw the release of &quot;Almost Blue&quot;, a cover album of country music including songs written by Hank Williams (&quot;Why Don&#x27;t You Love Me (Like You Used to Do?)&quot;), Merle Haggard (&quot;Tonight the Bottle Let Me Down&quot;), Gram Parsons (&quot;How Much I Lied&quot;) and George Jones (&quot;Brown to Blue&quot;). The album received mixed reviews. The first pressings of the record in the UK bore a sticker with the message: &quot;WARNING: This album contains country &amp; western music and may cause a radical reaction in narrow minded listeners&quot;. &quot;Almost Blue&quot; did spawn a surprise UK hit single with a version of Jerry Chesnut&#x27;s &quot;Good Year for the Roses&quot;, which reached number 6. Costello had long been an avid country music fan and has cited George Jones as his favourite country singer. He had appeared on Jones&#x27; duet album &quot;My Very Special Guests&quot;, contributing &quot;Stranger in the House&quot;, which they later performed together on a 1981 HBO special dedicated to Jones.

&quot;Imperial Bedroom&quot; (1982) featured lavish production by Geoff Emerick, engineer of several Beatles records. It remains one of his most critically acclaimed records, but again it failed to produce any hit singles—&quot;You Little Fool&quot; and the critically acclaimed &quot;Man Out of Time&quot; both failed to reach the Top 40 in the UK. Costello collaborated with Chris Difford, also of Squeeze, to write the song &quot;Boy With a Problem&quot;. Costello has said he disliked the marketing pitch for the album. &quot;Imperial Bedroom&quot; also featured Costello&#x27;s song &quot;Almost Blue&quot;, inspired by the music of jazz singer and trumpeter Chet Baker. Baker later recorded his own version of the song. &quot;Imperial Bedroom&quot; placed first on the &quot;Village Voice&quot;&#x27;s annual Pazz &amp; Jop poll.

In 1983, he released &quot;Punch the Clock&quot;, featuring female backing vocal duo (Afrodiziak) and a four-piece horn section (the TKO Horns), alongside the Attractions. Clive Langer (who co-produced with Alan Winstanley), provided Costello with a melody which eventually became &quot;Shipbuilding&quot;, which featured a trumpet solo by Baker. Prior to the release of Costello&#x27;s own version, a version of the song was a minor UK hit for Soft Machine founder Robert Wyatt.

Under the pseudonym The Imposter, Costello released &quot;Pills and Soap&quot;, an attack on the changes in British society brought on by Thatcherism, released to coincide with the run-up to the 1983 UK general election. &quot;Punch the Clock&quot; also generated an international hit in the single &quot;Everyday I Write the Book&quot;, aided by a music video featuring lookalikes of Prince Charles and Princess Diana undergoing domestic strife in a suburban home. The song became Costello&#x27;s first Top 40 hit single in the U.S. Also in the same year, Costello provided vocals on a version of the Madness song &quot;Tomorrow&#x27;s Just Another Day&quot; released as a B-side.

Tensions within the band – notably between Costello and bassist Bruce Thomas – were beginning to tell, and Costello announced his retirement and the break-up of the group shortly before they were to record &quot;Goodbye Cruel World&quot; (1984). Costello later expressed disappointment with the final album&#x27;s production, describing it as &quot;probably the worst record that I could have made of a decent bunch of songs.&quot;. The record was poorly received upon its initial release; the liner notes to the 1995 Rykodisc re-release, penned by Costello, begin with the words &quot;Congratulations! You&#x27;ve just purchased our worst album&quot;. Costello&#x27;s retirement, although short-lived, was accompanied by two compilations, &quot;Elvis Costello: The Man&quot; in the UK, Europe and Australia, and &quot;The Best of Elvis Costello &amp; The Attractions&quot; in the U.S. Daryl Hall provided backing vocals on the song &quot;The Only Flame in Town&quot; on &quot;Goodbye Cruel World&quot;.

In 1985, he appeared in the Live Aid benefit concert in England, singing the Beatles&#x27; &quot;All You Need Is Love&quot; as a solo artist. Costello introduced the song as an &quot;old northern English folk song&quot;, and the audience was invited to sing the chorus. In the same year Costello teamed up with friend T Bone Burnett for the single &quot;The People&#x27;s Limousine&quot; under the moniker of The Coward Brothers. That year, Costello also produced &quot;Rum Sodomy &amp; the Lash&quot; for the Irish punk/folk band the Pogues and he sang with Annie Lennox on the song &quot;Adrian&quot; from the Eurythmics record &quot;Be Yourself Tonight&quot;.

Growing antipathy between Costello and Bruce Thomas contributed to the Attractions&#x27; first split in 1986 when Costello was preparing to make a comeback. Working in the U.S. with Burnett, a band containing a number of Elvis Presley&#x27;s sidemen (including James Burton and Jerry Scheff), and minor input from the Attractions, he produced &quot;King of America&quot;, an acoustic guitar-driven album with a country sound. It was billed as performed by &quot;The Costello Show featuring the Attractions and Confederates&quot; in the UK and Europe and &quot;The Costello Show featuring Elvis Costello&quot; in North America. Around this time he legally changed his name back to Declan MacManus, adding Aloysius as an extra middle name. Costello retooled his upcoming tour to allow for multiple nights in each city, playing one night with the Confederates, one night with the Attractions, and one night solo acoustic. In May 1986, he performed at Self Aid, a benefit concert held in Dublin that focused on the chronic unemployment which was widespread in Ireland at that time.

Later that year, Costello returned to the studio with the Attractions and recorded &quot;Blood &amp; Chocolate&quot;, which was lauded for a post-punk fervour not heard since 1978&#x27;s &quot;This Year&#x27;s Model&quot;. It also marked the return of producer Nick Lowe, who had produced Costello&#x27;s first five albums. While &quot;Blood &amp; Chocolate&quot; failed to chart a hit single of any significance, it did produce what has since become one of Costello&#x27;s signature concert songs, &quot;I Want You&quot;. On this album, Costello adopted the alias Napoleon Dynamite, the name he later attributed to the character of the emcee that he played during the vaudeville-style tour to support &quot;Blood &amp; Chocolate&quot;. (The pseudonym had previously been used in 1982, when the B-side single &quot;Imperial Bedroom&quot; was credited to Napoleon Dynamite &amp; the Royal Guard; whether the title of the 2004 film &quot;Napoleon Dynamite&quot; was inspired by Costello is disputed). After the tour for &quot;Blood &amp; Chocolate&quot;, Costello split from the Attractions, due mostly to lingering tensions between him and Bruce Thomas. Costello continued to work with another Attraction, Pete Thomas, as a session musician for future releases.

Costello&#x27;s recording contract with Columbia Records ended after &quot;Blood &amp; Chocolate&quot;. In 1987, he released a compilation album, &quot;Out of Our Idiot&quot;, on his UK label, Demon Records consisting of B-sides, side projects, and unreleased songs from recording sessions from 1980 to 1987. He signed a new contract with Warner Bros. and in early 1989 released &quot;Spike&quot;, which spawned his biggest single in the U.S., the Top 20 hit (it reached number 19) &quot;Veronica&quot;, one of several songs Costello co-wrote with Paul McCartney. At the 1989 MTV Video Music Awards on 6 September in Los Angeles, &quot;Veronica&quot; won the MTV Award for Best Male Video.

Costello and McCartney wrote several songs together over a short period, which were released over a number of years:
* &quot;Back On My Feet&quot;, the B-side of McCartney&#x27;s 1987 single &quot;Once Upon a Long Ago&quot;, later added as a bonus track on the 1993 re-issue of McCartney&#x27;s &quot;Flowers in the Dirt&quot;
* Costello&#x27;s &quot;Veronica&quot; and &quot;Pads, Paws and Claws&quot; from his album &quot;Spike&quot; (1989)
* McCartney&#x27;s &quot;My Brave Face&quot;, &quot;Don&#x27;t Be Careless Love&quot;, &quot;That Day Is Done&quot; and the McCartney/Costello duet &quot;You Want Her Too&quot;, all from McCartney&#x27;s &quot;Flowers in the Dirt&quot; (1989)
* &quot;So Like Candy&quot; and &quot;Playboy to a Man&quot; from Costello&#x27;s &quot;Mighty Like a Rose&quot; (1991)
* &quot;The Lovers That Never Were&quot; and &quot;Mistress and Maid&quot; from McCartney&#x27;s &quot;Off the Ground&quot; (1993).
* &quot;Shallow Grave&quot; from Costello&#x27;s &quot;All This Useless Beauty&quot; (1996).
* Costello has also issued solo demo recordings of &quot;Veronica&quot;, &quot;Pads, Paws and Claws&quot; and &quot;Mistress and Maid&quot; (a song he did not otherwise record). Two other McCartney/Costello compositions remained officially unissued, while existing as widely bootlegged demos (&quot;Tommy&#x27;s Coming Home&quot; and &quot;Twenty Fine Fingers&quot;). These two tracks, along with demos of other songs from their collaboration, did eventually see release on the Paul McCartney Archive edition of &quot;Flowers in the Dirt&quot;.

In 1987, Costello appeared on the HBO special &quot;Roy Orbison and Friends, A Black and White Night&quot;, a tribute to his long-time idol Roy Orbison. Costello co-wrote &quot;The Other End (Of the Telescope)&quot; with the American singer-songwriter Aimee Mann. It appears on the 1988 album &quot;Everything&#x27;s Different Now&quot; by Mann&#x27;s band Til Tuesday.

=== 1990s ===
In 1991, Costello released &quot;Mighty Like a Rose&quot;, which featured the single &quot;The Other Side of Summer&quot;. He also co-composed and co-produced, with Richard Harvey, the title and incidental music for the mini-series &quot;G.B.H.&quot; by Alan Bleasdale. This entirely instrumental, and largely orchestral, soundtrack garnered a BAFTA, for Best Music for a TV Series for the pair.

In 1993, Costello experimented with classical music with a critically acclaimed collaboration with the Brodsky Quartet on &quot;The Juliet Letters&quot;. During this period, he wrote a full album&#x27;s worth of material for Wendy James, and these songs became the tracks on her 1993 solo album &quot;Now Ain&#x27;t the Time for Your Tears&quot;. Costello returned to rock and roll the following year with a project that reunited him with the Attractions, &quot;Brutal Youth&quot;. In 1995, he released &quot;Kojak Variety&quot;, an album of cover songs recorded five years earlier, and followed in 1996 with an album of songs originally written for other artists, &quot;All This Useless Beauty&quot;. This was the final album of original material that he issued under his Warner Bros. contract, and also his final album with the Attractions.

In 1994, he sang &quot;They Can&#x27;t Take That Away from Me&quot; with Tony Bennett for &quot;MTV Unplugged&quot;, appearing on the album released from the broadcast.

In the spring of 1996, Costello played a series of intimate club dates, backed only by Steve Nieve on the piano, in support of &quot;All This Useless Beauty&quot;. An ensuing mid-year tour with the Attractions proved to be the death knell, with relations between Costello and bassist Bruce Thomas at a breaking point, Costello announced that the current tour would be the Attractions&#x27; last. The quartet performed their final U.S. show in Seattle, Washington on 1 September 1996, before wrapping up their tour in Japan. Costello continued to work frequently with Attractions Steve Nieve and Pete Thomas; eventually, both became members of Costello&#x27;s new back-up band, The Imposters.

To fulfill his contractual obligations to Warner Bros., Costello released a greatest hits album titled &quot;Extreme Honey&quot; (1997). It contained an original track titled &quot;The Bridge I Burned&quot;, featuring Costello&#x27;s son, Matt, on bass. In the intervening period, Costello had served as artistic chair for the 1995 Meltdown Festival, which gave him the opportunity to explore his increasingly eclectic musical interests. His involvement in the festival yielded a one-off live EP with jazz guitarist Bill Frisell, which featured both cover material and a few of his own songs.

In 1998, Costello signed a multi-label contract with Polygram Records, sold by its parent company the same year to become part of the Universal Music Group. Costello released his new work on what he deemed the suitable imprimatur within the family of labels. His first new release as part of this contract involved a collaboration with Burt Bacharach. Their work had commenced earlier, in 1996, on &quot;God Give Me Strength&quot; for the movie &quot;Grace of My Heart&quot;. This led the pair to write and record the critically acclaimed album &quot;Painted From Memory&quot;, released under his new contract in 1998, on the Mercury Records label, featuring songs that were largely inspired by the dissolution of his relationship with Cait O&#x27;Riordan. Costello and Bacharach performed several concerts with full orchestral backing, and also recorded an updated version of Bacharach&#x27;s &quot;I&#x27;ll Never Fall in Love Again&quot; for the soundtrack to &quot;Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me&quot;, with both appearing in the film to perform the song. He also wrote &quot;I Throw My Toys Around&quot; for &quot;The Rugrats Movie&quot; and performed it with No Doubt. The same year, he collaborated with Paddy Moloney of The Chieftains on &quot;The Long Journey Home&quot; on the soundtrack of the PBS/Disney &quot;The Irish in America: Long Journey Home&quot; miniseries. The soundtrack won a Grammy Award in 1999.

In 1999, Costello contributed a version of &quot;She&quot;, released in 1974 by Charles Aznavour and Herbert Kretzmer, for the soundtrack of the film &quot;Notting Hill&quot;, with Trevor Jones producing. Costello&#x27;s version of the song reached number 19 on the UK singles chart. For the 25th anniversary of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, Costello was invited to the programme, where he re-enacted his abrupt song-switch: This time, however, he interrupted the Beastie Boys&#x27; &quot;Sabotage&quot;, and they acted as his backing group for &quot;Radio Radio&quot;. He also co-wrote another song with Aimee Mann, &quot;The Fall of the World&#x27;s Own Optimist&quot;, for her 2000 album &quot;Bachelor No. 2&quot;.

=== 2000s ===

From 2001 to 2005, Costello re-issued his back catalogue in the U.S., from &quot;My Aim Is True&quot; (1977) to &quot;All This Useless Beauty&quot; (1996), on double-disc collections on the Rhino Records label. These releases, which each contained second discs of bonus material, ultimately fell out of print by 2007 after Universal Music acquired the rights to Costello&#x27;s catalogue. Universal subsequently released new deluxe editions of &quot;My Aim Is True&quot; and &quot;This Year&#x27;s Model&quot; with new bonus material of full-length concerts from the time of each album&#x27;s release. These deluxe editions also fell out of print and Universal has reverted to re-releasing Costello&#x27;s pre-1987 albums in their original context without bonus material.

In 2000, Costello wrote lyrics to &quot;Green Song&quot;, a solo cello piece by Svante Henryson; this song appears on the Anne Sofie von Otter album &quot;For the Stars&quot;.

In 2000, Costello appeared at the Town Hall, New York, in Steve Nieve&#x27;s opera &quot;Welcome to the Voice&quot;, alongside Ron Sexsmith and John Flansburgh of They Might Be Giants. In 2001, Costello was artist-in-residence at UCLA and wrote the music for a new ballet. He produced and appeared on an album of pop songs for the classical singer Anne Sofie von Otter. He released the album &quot;When I Was Cruel&quot; in 2002 on Island Records, and toured with a new band, the Imposters (essentially the Attractions but with a different bass player, Davey Faragher, formerly of Cracker).

On 23 February 2003, Costello, along with Bruce Springsteen, Steven Van Zandt and Dave Grohl, performed a version of The Clash&#x27;s &quot;London Calling&quot; at the 45th Grammy Awards ceremony, in honour of Clash frontman Joe Strummer, who had died the previous December. In March, Elvis Costello &amp; the Attractions were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. In May, he announced his engagement to Canadian jazz singer and pianist Diana Krall, whom he had seen in concert and then met backstage at the Sydney Opera House in Australia. That September, he released &quot;North&quot;, an album of piano-based ballads concerning the breakdown of his former marriage, and his falling in love with Krall.

The song &quot;Scarlet Tide&quot; (co-written by Costello and T Bone Burnett and used in the film &quot;Cold Mountain&quot;) was nominated for a 2004 Academy Award; he performed it at the awards ceremony with Alison Krauss, who sang the song on the official soundtrack. Costello co-wrote many songs on Krall&#x27;s 2004 CD, &quot;The Girl in the Other Room&quot;, the first of hers to feature several original compositions. In July 2004, Costello&#x27;s first full-scale orchestral work, &quot;Il Sogno&quot;, was performed in New York. The work, a ballet based on Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;, was commissioned by Italian dance troupe Aterballeto, and received critical acclaim from classical music critics. Performed by the London Symphony Orchestra, conducted by Michael Tilson Thomas, the recording was released on CD in September by Deutsche Grammophon. In September 2004, Costello released the album &quot;The Delivery Man&quot;, recorded in Oxford, Mississippi, on Lost Highway Records, and it was hailed as one of his best.
A CD recording of a collaboration with Marian McPartland on her show &quot;Piano Jazz&quot; was released in 2005. It featured Costello singing six jazz standards and two of his own songs, accompanied by McPartland on piano.

A 2005 tour included a gig at Glastonbury that Costello considered so dreadful that he said &quot;I don&#x27;t care if I ever play England again. That gig made up my mind I wouldn&#x27;t come back. I don&#x27;t get along with it. We lost touch. It&#x27;s 25 years since I lived there. I don&#x27;t dig it, they don&#x27;t dig me...British music fans don&#x27;t have the same attitude to age as they do in America, where young people come to check out, say Willie Nelson. They feel some connection with him and find a role for that music in their lives&quot;.

In 2005, Costello performed with Green Day frontman Billie Joe Armstrong. They played both Costello and Green Day songs together, including &quot;Alison&quot;, &quot;No Action&quot;, &quot;Basket Case&quot; and &quot;Good Riddance (Time of Your Life)&quot;.

In November, Costello started recording a new album with Allen Toussaint and producer Joe Henry. Costello had a collaborative history with Toussaint, beginning with a couple of scattered album tracks in the 1980s. In September 2006, Costello and Allen Toussaint performed in New York at a series of benefit concerts for victims of Hurricane Katrina. By week&#x27;s end, Costello had written &quot;The River in Reverse&quot;, performed it with Toussaint and discussed plans for an album with Verve Records executives. Costello turned to older songs to reflect the national malaise at the time.

In a studio recording of Nieve&#x27;s opera &quot;Welcome to the Voice&quot; (2006, Deutsche Grammophon), Costello interpreted the character of Chief of Police, with Barbara Bonney, Robert Wyatt, Sting and Amanda Roocroft, and the album reached No. 2 in the &quot;Billboard&quot; classical charts. Costello later reprised the piece on the stage of the Théâtre du Châtelet in Paris in 2008, with Sting, Joe Sumner (Sting&#x27;s son) and Sylvia Schwartz. Also released in 2006 was a live recording of a concert with the Metropole Orkest at the North Sea Jazz Festival, entitled &quot;My Flame Burns Blue&quot;. The soundtrack for &quot;House, M.D.&quot; featured Costello&#x27;s interpretation of &quot;Beautiful&quot; by Christina Aguilera, with the song appearing in the second episode of Season 2.

Costello was commissioned to write a chamber opera by the Danish Royal Opera, Copenhagen, on the subject of Hans Christian Andersen&#x27;s infatuation with Swedish soprano Jenny Lind. Called &quot;The Secret Songs&quot;, it remained unfinished. In a performance in 2007 directed by Kasper Bech Holten at the Opera&#x27;s studio theatre (Takelloftet), finished songs were interspersed with pieces from Costello&#x27;s 1993 collaborative classical album &quot;The Juliet Letters&quot;, featuring Danish soprano Sine Bundgaard as Lind. The 2009 album &quot;Secret, Profane &amp; Sugarcane&quot; includes material from &quot;Secret Songs&quot;.

On 22 April 2008, &quot;Momofuku&quot; was released on Lost Highway Records, the same imprint that released &quot;The Delivery Man&quot;, his previous studio album. The album was, at least initially, released exclusively on vinyl (with a code to download a digital copy). That summer, in support of the album, Costello toured with the Police on the final leg of their 2007/2008 Reunion Tour. Costello played a homecoming gig at the Liverpool Philharmonic Hall on 25 June 2006. and, that month, gave his first performance in Poland, appearing with The Imposters for the closing gig of the Malta theatre festival in Poznań.
In 2006, Costello performed with Fiona Apple in the Decades Rock TV special. Apple performed two Costello songs and Costello performed two Apple songs.

In 2007, Costello collaborated with the Argentinean/Uruguayan electro-tango band Bajofondo on the song &quot;Fairly Right&quot; from the album &quot;Mar Dulce&quot;. In 2008, Costello collaborated with Fall Out Boy on the track &quot;What a Catch, Donnie&quot; from their album &quot;Folie a Deux&quot;. In Jenny Lewis&#x27; 2008 release, &quot;Acid Tongue&quot;, Costello provided vocals for the song &quot;Carpetbaggers&quot;. In November 2009, Costello appeared live with Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band at Madison Square Garden and performed the Jackie Wilson song &quot;(Your Love Keeps Lifting Me) Higher and Higher&quot;.

In July 2008, Costello (as Declan McManus) appeared in his home city Liverpool where he was awarded an honorary degree of Doctor of Music from the University of Liverpool. Costello was featured on Fall Out Boy&#x27;s 2008 album &quot;Folie à Deux&quot;, providing vocals on the track &quot;What a Catch, Donnie&quot;, along with other artists who are friends with the band.

Costello appeared in Stephen Colbert&#x27;s television special &quot;A Colbert Christmas: The Greatest Gift of All&quot;. In the program, he was eaten by a bear, but later saved by Santa Claus; he also sang a duet with Colbert. The special was first aired on 23 November 2008. Costello released &quot;Secret, Profane &amp; Sugarcane&quot;, a collaboration with T Bone Burnett, on 9 June 2009. It was his first on the Starbucks Hear Music label and a return to country music in the manner of &quot;Good Year for the Roses&quot;.

In May 2009, Costello made a surprise cameo appearance on-stage at the Beacon Theatre in New York as part of Spinal Tap&#x27;s &quot;Unwigged and Unplugged&quot; show, singing their fictional 1965 hit &quot;Gimme Some Money&quot; with the band backing him up.

In December 2009, Costello portrayed The Shape on the album &quot;Ghost Brothers of Darkland County&quot;, a collaboration between rock singer John Mellencamp and novelist Stephen King. In February 2010, Costello appeared in the live cinecast of Garrison Keillor&#x27;s &quot;Prairie Home Companion&quot;, singing some of his own songs, and participating in many of the show&#x27;s other musical and acting performances. On 30 April 2011, he played the song &quot;Pump it Up&quot; with the Odds before the start of a Vancouver Canucks playoff game at Rogers Arena in Vancouver, British Columbia.

===2010–present===

Costello released the album &quot;National Ransom&quot; in autumn of 2010.

On 26 February 2012, Costello paid tribute to music legends Chuck Berry and Leonard Cohen, who were the recipients of the first annual PEN Awards for songwriting excellence, at the JFK Presidential Library, in Boston, Massachusetts. In September 2013 Costello released &quot;Wise Up Ghost&quot;, a collaboration with the Roots. On 25 October 2013, Costello was awarded an Honorary Doctorate of Music from the New England Conservatory.

In 2012, he played ukulele, mandolin, guitar and added backing vocals on Diana Krall&#x27;s 11th studio album, &quot;Glad Rag Doll&quot; (as &quot;Howard Coward&quot;). On 10 September 2013, he played during the Apple September 2013 Event after the introduction of iTunes Radio, iPhone 5C and 5S at Town Hall, at the Apple campus.

On Gov&#x27;t Mule&#x27;s album &quot;Shout!&quot;, released in September 2013, he sang on the track &quot;Funny Little Tragedy&quot;. In March 2014, Costello recorded &quot;Lost on the River: The New Basement Tapes&quot; with Rhiannon Giddens, Taylor Goldsmith, Jim James and Marcus Mumford. During the 2016 Detour, he performs with Larkin Poe.

On 12 October 2018, Costello released his first studio album in five years, &quot;Look Now&quot;, recorded with The Imposters. The album features three songs co-written with Burt Bacharach, and one song co-written with Carole King. Costello wrote and produced a large majority of the album himself, with help from producer Sebastian Krys. On 26 January 2020, &quot;Look Now&quot; won the Grammy Award for Best Traditional Pop Vocal Album at the 62nd Grammy Awards.

Costello was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2019 Birthday Honours for services to music.

In 2021, Costello released &quot;Spanish Model&quot;, a remix of 1978&#x27;s &quot;This Year&#x27;s Model&quot; with Spanish lyrics. Singers from Spanish-speaking parts of the world, with help from Spanish-speaking songwriters, translated all 16 songs of the album into Spanish, with the new vocals set to the original recording and instrumentation by the Attractions. The singers included Juanes, Jorge Drexler, Luis Fonsi, Francisca Valenzuela, Fuego, Draco Rosa, and Fito Páez.

In 2021, Costello appeared at the Royal Variety Performance playing two songs with the Imposters. He was introduced by the MC Alan Carr as a man who has achieved everything except appearing at the Royal Variety Performance. Between songs Costello informed the audience that he was the second McManus to appear. His father Ross appeared in the 1960s singing &quot;If I Had a Hammer&quot;.

In January 2022, he performed on &quot;The Graham Norton Show&quot;. That same month he released the LP &quot;The Boy Named If&quot;, recorded with the Imposters. &quot;The Resurrection of Rust&quot; by a reformed Rusty followed later that year.

In April 2023, Costello collaborated with Slovenian band Joker Out on their single, &quot;New Wave&quot;. The compilation &quot;The Songs of Bacharach &amp; Costello&quot; was also released at this time. In August 2023, he made a three-dates mini-tour together with Italian singer-songwriter Carmen Consoli, a project the two had originally planned in 2012 but that at the time had been shelved due to Consoli&#x27;s pregnancy.

In November 2024, Costello and T Bone Burnett released a scripted comedy audio series on Audible, directed by Christopher Guest, as the Coward Brothers, characters the two created in the 1980s. The series features guest appearances by Harry Shearer as the radio host interviewing the two, along with Rhea Seehorn, Edward Hibbert, Stephen Root and Kathreen Khavari. An accompanying soundtrack album was released via New West Records.

== Writing ==

Since the early 1980s, Costello has written about music for publications including &quot;Hot Press,&quot; &quot;Details&quot;, &quot;Mojo&quot;, &quot;Musician&quot;, &quot;NME&quot;, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, and &quot;Vanity Fair.&quot; He has also written several articles about football (soccer), as an avid and knowledgeable fan, for the &quot;Times&quot; of London. A &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; editor who worked with Costello said, &quot;His copy was clean, elegant, and ready to run.&quot;

Costello has written liner notes for releases by artists including Gram Parsons, the Fairfield Four, Dusty Springfield, Booker T. &amp; the M.G.&#x27;s, Burt Bacharach, and Bill Frisell. He has written forewords to books by Geoff Emerick, Loretta Lynn, and Wanda Jackson.

In 1993, Costello began reissuing his catalog of albums from 1977 through 1986, on Rykodisc, and wrote detailed liner notes for each reissued album. Reviewers praised these liner notes as frank and charming. In 2001, he began a second round of reissues, this time of his catalog from 1977 through 1996, on Rhino Entertainment, and wrote even more detailed liner notes. &quot;Goldmine&quot; said the Rhino liner notes brought &quot;a wealth of insight into the songs and the creative process itself&quot; and that &quot;liner notes simply don&#x27;t get any better than this.&quot; &quot;Pitchfork&quot; called them &quot;truly fascinating.&quot; Several journalists noted that, at a total of 60,000 words, the Rhino liner notes amounted to a serialised memoir. In 2012, &quot;Slate&quot; magazine published a book review of the Rhino liner notes in which it called them &quot;one of the best rock-star memoirs of the last decade.&quot;

In 2015, Costello published &quot;Unfaithful Music &amp; Disappearing Ink&quot;, a memoir that had little overlap with his reissue liner notes. In this book, Costello recounted his life in music and traced parallels between his own experiences and those of his father and grandfather, both of whom were musicians. The book received enthusiastic positive reviews from prominent publications. The &quot;New York Times&quot; said it contained &quot;some of the best writing – funny, strange, spiteful, anguished – we&#x27;ve ever had from an important musician.&quot; The &quot;Washington Post&quot; praised it as having more in common with Frank McCourt&#x27;s memoir &quot;Angela&#x27;s Ashes&quot; than Mötley Crüe&#x27;s &quot;The Dirt&quot; and said it was more enjoyable than Keith Richards&#x27; &quot;Life&quot; and Bob Dylan&#x27;s &quot;&quot;. However, some positive reviews noted that the quality of the writing in the book was uneven and that the book might have been improved by being shorter, more focused thematically, or both. The few negative reviews the book received criticised its nonlinear structure, its relative lack of emphasis on Costello&#x27;s pop-star period, and its lack of details about his romantic relationships. The book reached number 7 on the &quot;New York Times&quot; Best Seller list. It was shortlisted for the Penderyn Music Book Prize, a British award for excellence in writing about music. The audiobook, narrated by Costello, was nominated for a Grammy Award.

==Acting and television presenting==

Costello has played himself or fictional characters very similar to himself in movies and television shows including &quot;Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me&quot; (1999), &quot;The Simpsons&quot; (2002), &quot;Frasier&quot; (2003), &quot;Two and a Half Men&quot; (2004), &quot;30 Rock&quot; (2009), &quot;Treme&quot; (2010), and &quot;Sesame Street&quot; (2011). He has also played more character-based roles, such as the title character&#x27;s eccentric brother in screenwriter Alan Bleasdale&#x27;s television series &quot;Scully&quot; (1984), an inept magician in Bleasdale&#x27;s movie &quot;No Surrender&quot; (1985)&quot;,&quot; a teacher at an impoverished school in the movie &quot;Prison Song&quot; (2001), and the title character&#x27;s father in the children&#x27;s animated series &quot;The Adventures of Pete the Cat&quot; (2017). In 1995, he appeared as a guest pundit on the British football commentary television show &quot;Football Italia&quot;.

In 2003, Costello substituted for an ailing David Letterman as the host of &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot;&quot;, making him the only musical guest of the show to have served as guest host. Costello&#x27;s performance on that show led to interest in developing a music-oriented talk show with him as the host, which came to fruition a few years later.

In 2008, Costello began production on &quot;&quot;, a show on which he interviewed and performed songs with other musicians. Guests included Tony Bennett, Bruce Springsteen, Smokey Robinson, Bono and the Edge of U2, opera singer Renée Fleming, and former president (and accomplished saxophonist) Bill Clinton. The series ran for 20 episodes over two seasons from 2008 through 2010. It aired on Sundance Channel in the US, CTV in Canada, and Channel 4 in the UK. The show received favourable reviews in the US, with reviewers praising Costello&#x27;s ability to get his guests to reveal insights into their creative processes and calling him a &quot;deeply knowledgeable, erudite and witty host.&quot; In Canada, the show won a Gemini Award for Best Talk Series. In Britain, however, it was aired in an overnight time slot and largely ignored.

== Public image and controversies ==

Costello revealed little about his background and gave few interviews in the first five years of his career, so the few widely published interviews he gave played a large role in forming his early public image. In a widely quoted August 1977 interview with Nick Kent, Costello said the only things that mattered to him were &quot;revenge and guilt&quot;. This phrase would be associated with him throughout his career.

=== 1977 &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; appearance ===

On 17 December 1977, Costello and the Attractions appeared on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; as last-minute replacements for the Sex Pistols. One of the songs Costello was scheduled to perform, at the request of his record company, was &quot;Less Than Zero&quot;, a song Costello wrote in reaction to seeing British fascist Oswald Mosley being treated with what Costello felt was undeserved deference during an interview on British television. Costello did not want to play the song because he thought the subject was too obscure for American audiences and the song was too low-key to make a strong impression. Instead, he wanted to play the then-unrecorded song, &quot;Radio Radio&quot;. During the live broadcast, Costello played a few bars of &quot;Less Than Zero&quot; and then told the Attractions to play &quot;Radio Radio&quot;, which they played in its entirety. This angered the show&#x27;s producer, Lorne Michaels, because Michaels was not prepared for the change and because &quot;Radio Radio&quot; had not been cleared by NBC&#x27;s censors. When asked about the incident on NBC&#x27;s &quot;Tomorrow Show&quot; three years later, Costello said he was told he would never appear on American television again. He appeared as musical guest on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; again in 1989 and 1991. Although the incident provoked little comment at the time, by 1999 it had become so well known that &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; invited Costello to perform a parody of it with the Beastie Boys on the show&#x27;s 25th anniversary special.

=== 1979 Columbus incident ===

In March 1979, during a drunken argument with Bonnie Bramlett and other members of the Stephen Stills band, at a Holiday Inn bar in Columbus, Ohio, Costello referred to James Brown as a &quot;jive-ass nigger&quot;, then pronounced Ray Charles a &quot;blind, ignorant nigger&quot;. At a New York City press conference a few days later, Costello said he had been drunk and had been attempting to be obnoxious to bring the conversation to a swift conclusion, not anticipating that Bramlett would bring his comments to the press. According to Costello, &quot;It became necessary for me to outrage these people with about the most obnoxious and offensive remarks that I could muster.&quot;

In his liner notes for the expanded version of &quot;Get Happy!!&quot; Costello writes that some time after the incident he had declined an offer to meet Charles out of guilt and embarrassment, although Charles himself had forgiven Costello, saying &quot;Drunken talk isn&#x27;t meant to be printed in the paper.&quot; Costello worked extensively in Britain&#x27;s Rock Against Racism campaign both before and after the incident. In an interview with Questlove (drummer for the Roots, with whom Costello collaborated in 2013), he stated: &quot;It&#x27;s upsetting because I can&#x27;t explain how I even got to think you could be funny about something like that,&quot; and further elaborating with, &quot;I&#x27;m sorry. You know? It&#x27;s about time I said it out loud.&quot;

=== 2010 cancelled Tel Aviv concerts ===
In early 2010, Costello was invited to play his first concert in Israel, on 30 June of that year, at the Caesarea Amphitheater north of Tel Aviv. Due to high demand for tickets, a second concert was added for 1 July. At first, Costello seemed resolved to resist political pressure on artists to refrain from performing in Israel due to the country&#x27;s controversial treatment of Palestinians. In early May, Costello told Israel&#x27;s largest daily newspaper, &quot;Yedioth Ahronoth&quot;, &quot;As soon as you play you are going to get criticised.&quot; Costello told the newspaper he did not agree with organisations that &quot;think that they need to boycott Israel to pressure it,&quot; saying he thought &quot;culture is the only way in which humanity shares experiences, and that is why I need to come and perform here.&quot; Two weeks later, he announced on his website that he had cancelled the concerts because of what he called the &quot;grave and complex&quot; sensitivities of the Israeli–Palestinian conflict. He told &quot;The Jerusalem Post&quot; his decision was part of a &quot;30-year conundrum&quot; that he had been dealing with regarding playing in Israel. He also told the &quot;Post&quot; that he had not been threatened or coerced, but that he &quot;woke up one day and realised [he] couldn&#x27;t go on with the shows.&quot; The promoters of the concerts expressed shock. Israeli Culture Minister Limor Livnat, a member of right-wing Likud Party, denounced the decision. The organisation Palestinian Campaign for the Academic and Cultural Boycott of Israel praised it.

==Personal life==

Costello has no full siblings. He has four half-brothers from his father&#x27;s second marriage, all of whom are musicians.

In November 1974, Costello married Mary Burgoyne. Costello has said he had hoped to marry Burgoyne since he was 14 years old and they were at school together in London, although they did not begin dating until four years later, when Costello moved back to London after living with his mother in Liverpool for two and a half years. They have one child, Matthew MacManus, born in early 1975. Costello&#x27;s rapid rise to fame put a strain on their marriage almost immediately. The couple separated in early 1978 but reconciled the following year. They separated permanently in mid-1984 and finalised their divorce in 1988. Costello has said that his inability to remain faithful in his first marriage, and the emotional turmoil it caused him, has been a major inspiration for his songs.

In early 1985, Costello began a romantic relationship with Cait O&#x27;Riordan, then bass player for the Pogues, whom he met in October 1984 while their respective bands were on tour together. In May 1986, they exchanged wedding rings and thereafter presented themselves, and were regarded, as husband and wife. They were never legally married. In September 2002, Costello ended the relationship. O&#x27;Riordan said that she was never married, that there was &quot;no piece of paper with marriage on it&quot;. They have no children. Since their split, both Costello and O&#x27;Riordan have described the union as unhappy.

In early 2003, Costello became engaged to and went on to marry singer and pianist Diana Krall, whom he met at the Grammy Awards ceremony the year before. They married in December 2003. The couple has twin sons, born in December 2006.

=== Health ===
In July 2018, Costello announced that he had been successfully treated for a cancerous growth six weeks earlier, but needed to cancel the remaining six dates of his European tour to continue recovering from the surgery. Costello said he had underestimated how much time he would need to recover. He resumed performing in September 2018.

=== Humanitarian causes ===
In 2017, Costello helped establish the Musician Treatment Foundation as a member of its board of directors. The foundation, which is based in Austin, Texas, helps under- and uninsured professional musicians receive free orthopedic care for upper limb injuries. He performed concerts for the foundation&#x27;s benefit in October 2017 and December 2022.

Costello sits on the advisory board of the board of directors of the Jazz Foundation of America, which provides emergency financial support and other services to working and retired musicians.

===Vegetarianism===
A pescatarian since the early 1980s, Costello says he was moved to reject meat after seeing the documentary &quot;The Animals Film&quot; (1982), which also helped inspire his song &quot;Pills and Soap&quot; from 1983&#x27;s &quot;Punch the Clock&quot;. In January 2013, Costello teamed up with Paul McCartney to create an advertisement campaign backing vegetarian foods produced by the Linda McCartney Foods brand.

==Legacy== 

Costello is considered by experts in pop and rock music to be one of the best songwriters of his generation. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic summarised Costello as, &quot;The most evocative, innovative, and gifted songwriter since Bob Dylan, with songs that offer highly personal takes on love and politics.&quot; In 2015, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked him 24th their list of the greatest songwriters of all time, calling him a songwriter of &quot;almost unparalleled versatility.&quot; When he was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2016, the induction announcement said the impact of Costello&#x27;s songs &quot;far out-distanced their commercial performance.&quot;

Costello&#x27;s debut album, &quot;My Aim Is True&quot;, is widely considered one of the best debut albums in the history of rock music. On the occasion of the 40th anniversary of the album&#x27;s release, &quot;Billboard&quot; called it &quot;one of the most influential albums in the history of rock and punk&quot; and &quot;one of the strongest debut albums in history&quot;. Although Costello never applied the term &quot;new wave&quot; to his music, Costello&#x27;s early records helped defined the new wave music genre. AllMusic said, &quot;Costello&#x27;s early albums changed the face of pop music by harnessing punk&#x27;s energy to a leaner, more incisive aesthetic that included pop hooks, virtually inventing new wave in the process.&quot; In their 2013 list of greatest albums of all time, the &quot;NME&quot; described &quot;This Year&#x27;s Model&quot; as &quot;defining the British new wave.&quot; In their 2009 list of greatest albums of all time, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; said &quot;the keyboard-driven sound of [Costello&#x27;s 1979 song] &#x27;Accidents Will Happen&#x27; helped define New Wave.&quot;

Musical artists with little connection to new wave have also claimed influence by Costello. Bruce Springsteen has said that comments Costello made in the press criticising Springsteen&#x27;s early songs as overly romantic led Springsteen to write darker songs for his 1978 album &quot;Darkness on the Edge of Town&quot;. Thom Yorke of Radiohead called &quot;Blood &amp; Chocolate&quot; &quot;the album that made me change the way I thought about recording and writing music [and] lyrics&quot;. Liz Phair, in her appreciation of Costello for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; 100 Greatest Artists of All Time, wrote: &quot;I&#x27;d pay a great amount of money to audit a course taught by him.&quot; Suzanne Vega has called Costello one of the &quot;melodic geniuses&quot; whose music she listens to in order to &quot;stretch my sense of melody.&quot;

Prominent artists in other fields have claimed influence or inspiration from Costello. Filmmaker and comedian Judd Apatow has called Costello &quot;a gigantic inspiration to me&quot; and has suggested that he and other comedians are &quot;fanatical&quot; about Costello&#x27;s music because of the &quot;spirit of standing up for what you believe in and the humor&quot; in it. Satirist and television host Stephen Colbert has described Costello as &quot;probably my favourite rock artist&quot; and said he sees parallels between his own humor and Costello&#x27;s &quot;wry, sardonic&quot; songs. Novelist Bret Easton Ellis titled his 1985 novel &quot;Less Than Zero&quot; after a Costello song and its 2010 sequel &quot;Imperial Bedrooms&quot; after a Costello album. Ellis has said Costello was once his &quot;idol&quot;. Visual artist Peter Blake featured Costello prominently in his 2012 reworking of the artwork he created for the cover of the Beatles&#x27; 1967 album &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot;. Blake said he included people he admired and who had contributed to British culture since he created the original work.

<text>Epilepsy is a group of non-communicable neurological disorders characterized by recurrent epileptic seizures. An epileptic seizure is the clinical manifestation of an abnormal, excessive, and synchronized electrical discharge in the neurons. The occurrence of two or more unprovoked seizures defines epilepsy. The occurrence of just one seizure may warrant the definition (set out by the International League Against Epilepsy) in a more clinical usage where recurrence may be able to be prejudged. Epileptic seizures can vary from brief and nearly undetectable periods to long periods of vigorous shaking due to abnormal electrical activity in the brain. These episodes can result in physical injuries, either directly, such as broken bones, or through causing accidents. In epilepsy, seizures tend to recur and may have no detectable underlying cause. Isolated seizures that are provoked by a specific cause such as poisoning are not deemed to represent epilepsy. People with epilepsy may be treated differently in various areas of the world and experience varying degrees of social stigma due to the alarming nature of their symptoms.

The underlying mechanism of an epileptic seizure is excessive and abnormal neuronal activity in the cortex of the brain, which can be observed in the electroencephalogram (EEG) of an individual. The reason this occurs in most cases of epilepsy is unknown (cryptogenic); some cases occur as the result of brain injury, stroke, brain tumors, infections of the brain, or birth defects through a process known as epileptogenesis. Known genetic mutations are directly linked to a small proportion of cases. The diagnosis involves ruling out other conditions that might cause similar symptoms, such as fainting, and determining if another cause of seizures is present, such as alcohol withdrawal or electrolyte problems. This may be partly done by imaging the brain and performing blood tests. Epilepsy can often be confirmed with an EEG, but a normal reading does not rule out the condition.

Epilepsy that occurs as a result of other issues may be preventable. Seizures are controllable with medication in about 69% of cases; inexpensive anti-seizure medications are often available. In those whose seizures do not respond to medication; surgery, neurostimulation or dietary changes may be considered. Not all cases of epilepsy are lifelong, and many people improve to the point that treatment is no longer needed.

, about 51 million people have epilepsy. Nearly 80% of cases occur in the developing world. In 2021, it resulted in 140,000 deaths, an increase from 125,000 in 1990. Epilepsy is more common in children and older people. In the developed world, onset of new cases occurs most frequently in babies and the elderly. In the developing world, onset is more common at the extremes of age – in younger children and in older children and young adults due to differences in the frequency of the underlying causes. About 5–10% of people will have an unprovoked seizure by the age of 80. The chance of experiencing a second seizure within two years after the first is around 40%. In many areas of the world, those with epilepsy either have restrictions placed on their ability to drive or are not permitted to drive until they are free of seizures for a specific length of time. The word &quot;epilepsy&quot; is from Ancient Greek , &#x27;to seize, possess, or afflict&#x27;.
==Signs and symptoms==

Epilepsy is characterized by a long-term risk of recurrent epileptic seizures. These seizures may present in several ways depending on the parts of the brain involved and the person&#x27;s age.

===Seizures===

The most common type (60%) of seizures are convulsive which involve involuntary muscle contractions. Of these, one-third begin as generalized seizures from the start, affecting both hemispheres of the brain and impairing consciousness. Two-thirds begin as focal seizures (which affect one hemisphere of the brain) which may progress to generalized seizures. The remaining 40% of seizures are non-convulsive. An example of this type is the absence seizure, which presents as a decreased level of consciousness and usually lasts about 10 seconds.
Certain experiences, known as auras often precede focal seizures. The seizures can include sensory (visual, hearing, or smell), psychic, autonomic, and motor phenomena depending on which part of the brain is involved. Muscle jerks may start in a specific muscle group and spread to surrounding muscle groups in which case it is known as a Jacksonian march. Automatisms may occur, which are non-consciously generated activities and mostly simple repetitive movements like smacking the lips or more complex activities such as attempts to pick up something.
There are six main types of generalized seizures:
* tonic-clonic,
* tonic,
* clonic,
* myoclonic,
* absence, and
* atonic seizures.

They all involve loss of consciousness and typically happen without warning.

Tonic-clonic seizures occur with a contraction of the limbs followed by their extension and arching of the back which lasts 10–30 seconds (the tonic phase). A cry may be heard due to contraction of the chest muscles, followed by a shaking of the limbs in unison (clonic phase). Tonic seizures produce constant contractions of the muscles. A person often turns blue as breathing is stopped. In clonic seizures there is shaking of the limbs in unison. After the shaking has stopped it may take 10–30 minutes for the person to return to normal; this period is called the &quot;postictal state&quot; or &quot;postictal phase.&quot; Loss of bowel or bladder control may occur during a seizure. People experiencing a seizure may bite their tongue, either the tip or on the sides; in tonic-clonic seizure, bites to the sides are more common. Tongue bites are also relatively common in psychogenic non-epileptic seizures. Psychogenic non-epileptic seizures are seizure like behavior without an associated synchronised electrical discharge on EEG and are considered a dissociative disorder.

Myoclonic seizures involve very brief muscle spasms in either a few areas or all over. These sometimes cause the person to fall, which can cause injury. Absence seizures can be subtle with only a slight turn of the head or eye blinking with impaired consciousness; typically, the person does not fall over and returns to normal right after it ends. Atonic seizures involve losing muscle activity for greater than one second, typically occurring on both sides of the body. Rarer seizure types can cause involuntary unnatural laughter (gelastic), crying (dyscrastic), or more complex experiences such as &quot;déjà vu&quot;.
About 6% of those with epilepsy have seizures that are often triggered by specific events and are known as reflex seizures. Those with reflex epilepsy have seizures that are only triggered by specific stimuli. Common triggers include flashing lights and sudden noises. In certain types of epilepsy, seizures happen more often during sleep, and in other types they occur almost only when sleeping. In 2017, the International League Against Epilepsy published new uniform guidelines for the classification of seizures as well as epilepsies along with their cause and comorbidities.

==== Seizure clusters ====
People with epilepsy may experience seizure clusters which may be broadly defined as an acute deterioration in seizure control. The prevalence of seizure clusters is uncertain given that studies have used different definitions to define them. However, estimates suggest that the prevalence may range from 5% to 50% of people with epilepsy. People with refractory epilepsy who have a high seizure frequency are at the greatest risk for having seizure clusters. Seizure clusters are associated with increased healthcare use, worse quality of life, impaired psychosocial functioning, and possibly increased mortality. Benzodiazepines are used as an acute treatment for seizure clusters.

===Post-ictal===
After the active portion of a seizure (the ictal state) there is typically a period of recovery during which there is confusion, referred to as the postictal period, before a normal level of consciousness returns. It usually lasts 3 to 15 minutes but may last for hours. Other common symptoms include feeling tired, headache, difficulty speaking, and abnormal behavior. Psychosis after a seizure is relatively common, occurring in 6–10% of people. Often people do not remember what happened during this time. Localized weakness, known as Todd&#x27;s paralysis, may also occur after a focal seizure. It would typically last for seconds to minutes but may rarely last for a day or two.

===Psychosocial===
Epilepsy can have adverse effects on social and psychological well-being. These effects may include social isolation, stigmatization, or disability. They may result in lower educational achievement and worse employment outcomes. Learning disabilities are common in those with the condition, and especially among children with epilepsy. The stigma of epilepsy can also affect the families of those with the disorder.
Certain disorders occur more often in people with epilepsy, depending partly on the epilepsy syndrome present. These include depression, anxiety, obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD), and migraine. Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) affects three to five times more children with epilepsy than children without the condition. ADHD and epilepsy have significant consequences on a child&#x27;s behavioral, learning, and social development. Epilepsy is also more common in children with autism.

Approximately, one-in-three people with epilepsy have a lifetime history of a psychiatric disorder. There are believed to be multiple causes for this including pathophysiological changes related to the epilepsy itself as well as adverse experiences related to living with epilepsy (e.g., stigma, discrimination). In addition, it is thought that the relationship between epilepsy and psychiatric disorders is not unilateral but rather bidirectional. For example, people with depression have an increased risk for developing new-onset epilepsy.

The presence of comorbid depression or anxiety in people with epilepsy is associated with a poorer quality of life, increased mortality, increased healthcare use and a worse response to treatment (including surgical). Anxiety disorders and depression may explain more variability in quality of life than seizure type or frequency. There is evidence that both depression and anxiety disorders are underdiagnosed and undertreated in people with epilepsy.

== Causes ==

Epilepsy can have both genetic and acquired causes, with the interaction of these factors in many cases. Established acquired causes include serious brain trauma, stroke, tumours, and brain problems resulting from a previous infection. In about 60% of cases, the cause is unknown. Epilepsies caused by genetic, congenital, or developmental conditions are more common among younger people, while brain tumors and strokes are more likely in older people.

Seizures may also occur as a consequence of other health problems; if they occur right around a specific cause, such as a stroke, head injury, toxic ingestion, or metabolic problem, they are known as acute symptomatic seizures and are in the broader classification of seizure-related disorders rather than epilepsy itself.

===Genetics===
Genetics is believed to be involved in the majority of cases, either directly or indirectly. Some epilepsies are due to a single gene defect (1–2%); most are due to the interaction of multiple genes and environmental factors. Each of the single gene defects is rare, with more than 200 in all described. Most genes involved affect ion channels, either directly or indirectly. These include genes for ion channels, enzymes, GABA, and G protein-coupled receptors.

In identical twins, if one is affected, there is a 50–60% chance that the other will also be affected. In non-identical twins, the risk is 15%. These risks are greater in those with generalized rather than focal seizures. If both twins are affected, most of the time they have the same epileptic syndrome (70–90%). Other close relatives of a person with epilepsy have a risk five times that of the general population. Between 1 and 10% of those with Down syndrome and 90% of those with Angelman syndrome have epilepsy.

==== Phakomatoses ====
Phakomatoses, also known as neurocutaneous disorders, are a group of multisystemic diseases that most prominently affect the skin and central nervous system. They are caused by defective development of the embryonic ectodermal tissue that is most often due to a single genetic mutation. The brain, as well as other neural tissue and the skin, are all derived from the ectoderm and thus defective development may result in epilepsy as well as other manifestations such as autism and intellectual disability. Some types of phakomatoses such as tuberous sclerosis complex and Sturge-Weber syndrome have a higher prevalence of epilepsy relative to others such as neurofibromatosis type 1.

Tuberous sclerosis complex is an autosomal dominant disorder that is caused by mutations in either the TSC1 or TSC2 gene and it affects approximately 1 in 6,000–10,000 live births. These mutations result in the upregulation of the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway which leads to the growth of tumors in many organs including the brain, skin, heart, eyes and kidneys. In addition, abnormal mTOR activity is believed to alter neural excitability. The prevalence of epilepsy is estimated to be 80-90%. The majority of cases of epilepsy present within the first 3 years of life and are medically refractory. Relatively recent developments for the treatment of epilepsy in people with TSC include mTOR inhibitors, cannabidiol and vigabatrin. Epilepsy surgery is often pursued.

Sturge-Weber syndrome is caused by an activating somatic mutation in the GNAQ gene and it affects approximately 1 in 20,000–50,000 live births. The mutation results in vascular malformations affecting the brain, skin and eyes. The typical presentation includes a facial port-wine birthmark, ocular angiomas and cerebral vascular malformations which are most often unilateral but are bilateral in 15% of cases. The prevalence of epilepsy is 75-100% and is higher in those with bilateral involvement. Seizures typically occur within the first two years of life and are refractory in nearly half of cases. However, high rates of seizure freedom with surgery have been reported in as many as 83%.

Neurofibromatosis type 1 is the most common phakomatoses and occurs in approximately 1 in 3,000 live births. It is caused by autosomal dominant mutations in the Neurofibromin 1 gene. Clinical manifestations are variable but may include hyperpigmented skin marks, hamartomas of the iris called Lisch nodules, neurofibromas, optic pathway gliomas and cognitive impairment. The prevalence of epilepsy is estimated to be 4–7%. Seizures are typically easier to control with anti-seizure medications relative to other phakomatoses but in some refractory cases surgery may need to be pursued.

===Acquired===
Epilepsy may occur as a result of several other conditions, including tumors, strokes, head trauma, previous infections of the central nervous system, genetic abnormalities, and as a result of brain damage around the time of birth. Of those with brain tumors, almost 30% have epilepsy, making them the cause of about 4% of cases. The risk is greatest for tumors in the temporal lobe and those that grow slowly. Other mass lesions such as cerebral cavernous malformations and arteriovenous malformations have risks as high as 4060%. Of those who have had a stroke, 6–10% develop epilepsy. Risk factors for post-stroke epilepsy include stroke severity, cortical involvement, hemorrhage and early seizures. Between 6 and 20% of epilepsy is believed to be due to head trauma. Mild brain injury increases the risk about two-fold while severe brain injury increases the risk seven-fold. In those who have experienced a high-powered gunshot wound to the head, the risk is about 50%.

Some evidence links epilepsy and celiac disease and non-celiac gluten sensitivity, while other evidence does not. There appears to be a specific syndrome that includes coeliac disease, epilepsy, and calcifications in the brain. A 2012 review estimates that between 1% and 6% of people with epilepsy have coeliac disease while 1% of the general population has the condition.

The risk of epilepsy following meningitis is less than 10%; it more commonly causes seizures during the infection itself. In herpes simplex encephalitis the risk of a seizure is around 50% with a high risk of epilepsy following (up to 25%). A form of an infection with the pork tapeworm (cysticercosis), in the brain, is known as neurocysticercosis, and is the cause of up to half of epilepsy cases in areas of the world where the parasite is common. Epilepsy may also occur after other brain infections such as cerebral malaria, toxoplasmosis, and toxocariasis. Chronic alcohol use increases the risk of epilepsy: those who drink six units of alcohol per day have a 2.5-fold increase in risk. Other risks include Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, multiple sclerosis, and autoimmune encephalitis. Getting vaccinated does not increase the risk of epilepsy. Malnutrition is a risk factor seen mostly in the developing world, although it is unclear however if it is a direct cause or an association. People with cerebral palsy have an increased risk of epilepsy, with half of people with spastic quadriplegia and spastic hemiplegia having the condition.

== Mechanism ==
Normally brain electrical activity is non-synchronous, as large numbers of neurons do not normally fire at the same time, but rather fire in order as signals travel throughout the brain. Neuron activity is regulated by various factors both within the cell and the cellular environment. Factors within the neuron include the type, number and distribution of ion channels, changes to receptors and changes of gene expression. Factors around the neuron include ion concentrations, synaptic plasticity and regulation of transmitter breakdown by glial cells.

===Epilepsy===
The exact mechanism of epilepsy is unknown, but a little is known about its cellular and network mechanisms. However, it is unknown under which circumstances the brain shifts into the activity of a seizure with its excessive synchronization.

In epilepsy, the resistance of excitatory neurons to fire during this period is decreased. This may occur due to changes in ion channels or inhibitory neurons not functioning properly. This then results in a specific area from which seizures may develop, known as a &quot;seizure focus&quot;. Another mechanism of epilepsy may be the up-regulation of excitatory circuits or down-regulation of inhibitory circuits following an injury to the brain. These secondary epilepsies occur through processes known as epileptogenesis. Failure of the blood–brain barrier may also be a causal mechanism as it would allow substances in the blood to enter the brain.

===Seizures===
There is evidence that epileptic seizures are usually not a random event. Seizures are often brought on by factors (also known as triggers) such as stress, excessive alcohol use, flickering light, or a lack of sleep, among others. The term seizure threshold is used to indicate the amount of stimulus necessary to bring about a seizure; this threshold is lowered in epilepsy.

In epileptic seizures a group of neurons begin firing in an abnormal, excessive, and synchronized manner. This results in a wave of depolarization known as a paroxysmal depolarizing shift. Normally, after an excitatory neuron fires it becomes more resistant to firing for a period of time. This is due in part to the effect of inhibitory neurons, electrical changes within the excitatory neuron, and the negative effects of adenosine.

Focal seizures begin in one area of the brain while generalized seizures begin in both hemispheres. Some types of seizures may change brain structure, while others appear to have little effect. Gliosis, neuronal loss, and atrophy of specific areas of the brain are linked to epilepsy but it is unclear if epilepsy causes these changes or if these changes result in epilepsy.

The seizures can be described on different scales, from the cellular level to the whole brain. These are several concomitant factor, which on different scale can &quot;drive&quot; the brain to pathological states and trigger a seizure.

==Diagnosis==
The diagnosis of epilepsy is typically made based on observation of the seizure onset and the underlying cause. An electroencephalogram (EEG) to look for abnormal patterns of brain waves and neuroimaging (CT scan or MRI) to look at the structure of the brain are also usually part of the initial investigations. While figuring out a specific epileptic syndrome is often attempted, it is not always possible. Video and EEG monitoring may be useful in difficult cases.

===Definition===
Epilepsy is a disorder of the brain defined by any of the following conditions:

Furthermore, epilepsy is considered to be resolved for individuals who had an age-dependent epilepsy syndrome but are now past that age or those who have remained seizure-free for the last 10 years, with no seizure medicines for the last 5 years.

This 2014 definition of the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) is a clarification of the ILAE 2005 conceptual definition, according to which epilepsy is &quot;a disorder of the brain characterized by an enduring predisposition to generate epileptic seizures and by the neurobiologic, cognitive, psychological, and social consequences of this condition. The definition of epilepsy requires the occurrence of at least one epileptic seizure.&quot;

It is, therefore, possible to outgrow epilepsy or to undergo treatment that causes epilepsy to be resolved, but with no guarantee that it will not return. In the definition, epilepsy is now called a disease, rather than a disorder. This was a decision of the executive committee of the ILAE, taken because the word &quot;disorder&quot;, while perhaps having less stigma than does &quot;disease&quot;, also does not express the degree of seriousness that epilepsy deserves.

The definition is practical in nature and is designed for clinical use. In particular, it aims to clarify when an &quot;enduring predisposition&quot; according to the 2005 conceptual definition is present. Researchers, statistically minded epidemiologists, and other specialized groups may choose to use the older definition or a definition of their own devising. The ILAE considers doing so is perfectly allowable, so long as it is clear what definition is being used.

The ILAE definition for one seizure needs an understanding of projecting an &quot;enduring predisposition&quot; to the generation of epileptic seizures. WHO, for instance, chooses to just use the traditional definition of two unprovoked seizures.

===Classification===

In contrast to the classification of seizures which focuses on what happens during a seizure, the classification of epilepsies focuses on the underlying causes. When a person is admitted to hospital after an epileptic seizure the diagnostic workup results preferably in the seizure itself being classified (e.g. tonic-clonic) and in the underlying disease being identified (e.g. hippocampal sclerosis). The name of the diagnosis finally made depends on the available diagnostic results and the applied definitions and classifications (of seizures and epilepsies) and its respective terminology.

The International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) provided a classification of the epilepsies and epileptic syndromes in 1989 as follows:

This classification was widely accepted but has also been criticized mainly because the underlying causes of epilepsy (which are a major determinant of clinical course and prognosis) were not covered in detail. In 2010 the ILAE Commission for Classification of the Epilepsies addressed this issue and divided epilepsies into three categories (genetic, structural/metabolic, unknown cause) which were refined in their 2011 recommendation into four categories and a number of subcategories reflecting recent technological and scientific advances.

: A revised, operational classification of seizure types has been introduced by the ILAE. It allows more clearly understood terms and clearly defines focal and generalized onset dichotomy, when possible, even without observing the seizures based on description by patient or observers. The essential changes in terminology are that &quot;partial&quot; is called &quot;focal&quot; with awareness used as a classifier for focal seizures -based on description focal seizures are now defined as behavioral arrest, automatisms, cognitive, autonomic, emotional or hyperkinetic variants while atonic, myoclonic, clonic, infantile spasms, and tonic seizures may be either focal or generalized based on their onset. Several terms that were not clear or consistent in the description were removed such as dyscognitive, psychic, simple, and complex partial, while &quot;secondarily generalized&quot; is replaced by a clearer term &quot;focal to bilateral tonic-clonic seizure&quot;. New seizure types now believed to be generalized are eyelid myoclonia, myoclonic atonic, myoclonic absence, and myoclonic tonic-clonic. Sometimes it is possible to classify seizures as focal or generalized based on presenting features even though onset is not known. This system is based on the 1981 seizure classification modified in 2010 and principally is the same with an effort to improve the flexibility and clarity of use to understand seizure types better in keeping with current knowledge.

===Syndromes===

Cases of epilepsy may be organized into epilepsy syndromes by the specific features that are present. These features include the age that seizures begin, the seizure types, EEG findings, among others. Identifying an epilepsy syndrome is useful as it helps determine the underlying causes as well as what anti-seizure medication should be tried.

The ability to categorize a case of epilepsy into a specific syndrome occurs more often with children since the onset of seizures is commonly early. Less serious examples are benign rolandic epilepsy (2.8 per 100,000), childhood absence epilepsy (0.8 per 100,000) and juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (0.7 per 100,000). Severe syndromes with diffuse brain dysfunction caused, at least partly, by some aspect of epilepsy, are also referred to as developmental and epileptic encephalopathies. These are associated with frequent seizures that are resistant to treatment and cognitive dysfunction, for instance Lennox–Gastaut syndrome (1–2% of all persons with epilepsy), Dravet syndrome (1: 15,000-40,000 worldwide), and West syndrome (1–9: 100,000). Genetics is believed to play an important role in epilepsies by a number of mechanisms. Simple and complex modes of inheritance have been identified for some of them. However, extensive screening have failed to identify many single gene variants of large effect. More recent exome and genome sequencing studies have begun to reveal a number of de novo gene mutations that are responsible for some epileptic encephalopathies, including CHD2 and SYNGAP1 and DNM1, GABBR2, FASN and RYR3.

Syndromes in which causes are not clearly identified are difficult to match with categories of the current classification of epilepsy. Categorization for these cases was made somewhat arbitrarily. The &quot;idiopathic&quot; (unknown cause) category of the 2011 classification includes syndromes in which the general clinical features and/or age specificity strongly point to a presumed genetic cause. Some childhood epilepsy syndromes are included in the unknown cause category in which the cause is presumed genetic, for instance benign rolandic epilepsy. Clinical syndromes in which epilepsy is not the main feature (e.g. Angelman syndrome) were categorized &quot;symptomatic&quot; but it was argued to include these within the category &quot;idiopathic&quot;. Classification of epilepsies and particularly of epilepsy syndromes will change with advances in research.

===Tests===

An electroencephalogram (EEG) can assist in showing brain activity suggestive of an increased risk of seizures. It is only recommended for those who are likely to have had an epileptic seizure on the basis of symptoms. In the diagnosis of epilepsy, electroencephalography may help distinguish the type of seizure or syndrome present. In children it is typically only needed after a second seizure unless specified by a specialist. It cannot be used to rule out the diagnosis and may be falsely positive in those without the condition. In certain situations it may be useful to perform the EEG while the affected individual is sleeping or sleep deprived.
Diagnostic imaging by CT scan and MRI is recommended after a first non-febrile seizure to detect structural problems in and around the brain. MRI is generally a better imaging test except when bleeding is suspected, for which CT is more sensitive and more easily available. If someone attends the emergency room with a seizure but returns to normal quickly, imaging tests may be done at a later point. If a person has a previous diagnosis of epilepsy with previous imaging, repeating the imaging is usually not needed even if there are subsequent seizures.
For adults, the testing of electrolyte, blood glucose and calcium levels is important to rule out problems with these as causes. An electrocardiogram can rule out problems with the rhythm of the heart. A lumbar puncture may be useful to diagnose a central nervous system infection but is not routinely needed. In children additional tests may be required such as urine biochemistry and blood testing looking for metabolic disorders. Together with EEG and neuroimaging, genetic testing is becoming one of the most important diagnostic techniques for epilepsy, as a diagnosis might be achieved in a relevant proportion of cases with severe epilepsies, both in children and adults. For those with negative genetic testing, in some it might be important to repeat or re-analyze previous genetic studies after 2–3 years.

A high blood prolactin level within the first 20 minutes following a seizure may be useful to help confirm an epileptic seizure as opposed to psychogenic non-epileptic seizure. Serum prolactin level is less useful for detecting focal seizures. If it is normal an epileptic seizure is still possible and a serum prolactin does not separate epileptic seizures from syncope. It is not recommended as a routine part of the diagnosis of epilepsy.

===Differential diagnosis===
Diagnosis of epilepsy can be difficult. A number of other conditions may present very similar signs and symptoms to seizures, including syncope, hyperventilation, migraines, narcolepsy, panic attacks and psychogenic non-epileptic seizures (PNES). In particular, syncope can be accompanied by a short episode of convulsions. Nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy, often misdiagnosed as nightmares, was considered to be a parasomnia but later identified to be an epilepsy syndrome. Attacks of the movement disorder paroxysmal dyskinesia may be taken for epileptic seizures. The cause of a drop attack can be, among many others, an atonic seizure.

Children may have behaviors that are easily mistaken for epileptic seizures but are not. These include breath-holding spells, bedwetting, night terrors, tics and shudder attacks. Gastroesophageal reflux may cause arching of the back and twisting of the head to the side in infants, which may be mistaken for tonic-clonic seizures.

Misdiagnosis is frequent (occurring in about 5 to 30% of cases). Different studies showed that in many cases seizure-like attacks in apparent treatment-resistant epilepsy have a cardiovascular cause. Approximately 20% of the people seen at epilepsy clinics have PNES and of those who have PNES about 10% also have epilepsy; separating the two based on the seizure episode alone without further testing is often difficult.

==Prevention==
While many cases are not preventable, efforts to reduce head injuries, provide good care around the time of birth, and reduce environmental parasites such as the pork tapeworm may be effective. After brain injuries, there is a limited window of time to intervene with treatments to prevent epilepsy, similar to the therapeutic approach used in stroke therapy. Epileptogenesis may occur rapidly, further narrowing this window, but a delayed process known as &quot;secondary epileptogenesis&quot; can influence the progression and severity of epilepsy, offering opportunities for intervention even after its onset. Current research focuses on identifying methods and targets to prevent or slow epilepsy development. Promising treatments include drugs such as TrkB inhibitors, losartan, statins, isoflurane, anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative drugs, the SV2A modulator levetiracetam, and epigenetic interventions. Efforts in one part of Central America to decrease rates of pork tapeworm resulted in a 50% decrease in new cases of epilepsy. Yoga-based Nadi Shodhana Pranayama, also known as Alternate Nostril Breathing, may positively impact the nervous system and help manage seizure disorders. Regular exercise helps balance brain function by providing the body with oxygen and removing carbon dioxide and toxins from the blood.

== Complications ==
Epilepsy can be dangerous when seizure occurs at certain times. The risk of drowning or being involved in a motor vehicle collision is higher. It is also found that people with epilepsy are more likely to have psychological problems. Other complications include aspiration pneumonia and difficulty learning.

==Management==
Epilepsy is usually treated with daily medication once a second seizure has occurred, while medication may be started after the first seizure in those at high risk for subsequent seizures. Supporting people&#x27;s self-management of their condition may be useful. In drug-resistant cases different management options may be considered, including special diets, the implantation of a neurostimulator, or neurosurgery.

===First aid===
Rolling people with an active tonic-clonic seizure onto their side and into the recovery position helps prevent fluids from getting into the lungs. Putting fingers, a bite block or tongue depressor in the mouth is not recommended as it might make the person vomit or result in the rescuer being bitten. Efforts should be taken to prevent further self-injury. Spinal precautions are generally not needed.

If a seizure lasts longer than 5 minutes or if there are more than two seizures in 5 minutes without a return to a normal level of consciousness between them, it is considered a medical emergency known as status epilepticus. This may require medical help to keep the airway open and protected; a nasopharyngeal airway may be useful for this. At home the recommended initial medication for seizure of a long duration is midazolam placed in the nose or mouth. Diazepam may also be used rectally. In hospital, intravenous lorazepam is preferred.

If two doses of benzodiazepines are not effective, other medications such as phenytoin are recommended. Convulsive status epilepticus that does not respond to initial treatment typically requires admission to the intensive care unit and treatment with stronger agents such as midazolam infusion, ketamine, thiopentone or propofol. Most institutions have a preferred pathway or protocol to be used in a seizure emergency like status epilepticus. These protocols have been found to be effective in reducing time to delivery of treatment.

===Medications===

The mainstay treatment of epilepsy is anticonvulsant medications, possibly for the person&#x27;s entire life. The choice of anticonvulsant is based on seizure type, epilepsy syndrome, other medications used, other health problems, and the person&#x27;s age and lifestyle. A single medication is recommended initially; if this is not effective, switching to a single other medication is recommended. Two medications at once is recommended only if a single medication does not work. In about half, the first agent is effective; a second single agent helps in about 13% and a third or two agents at the same time may help an additional 4%. About 30% of people continue to have seizures despite anticonvulsant treatment.
There are a number of medications available including phenytoin, carbamazepine and valproate. Evidence suggests that phenytoin, carbamazepine, and valproate may be equally effective in both focal and generalized seizures. Controlled release carbamazepine appears to work as well as immediate release carbamazepine, and may have fewer side effects. In the United Kingdom, carbamazepine or lamotrigine are recommended as first-line treatment for focal seizures, with levetiracetam and valproate as second-line due to issues of cost and side effects. Valproate is recommended first-line for generalized seizures with lamotrigine being second-line. In those with absence seizures, ethosuximide or valproate are recommended; valproate is particularly effective in myoclonic seizures and tonic or atonic seizures. If seizures are well-controlled on a particular treatment, it is not usually necessary to routinely check the medication levels in the blood.
The least expensive anticonvulsant is phenobarbital at around US$5 a year. The World Health Organization gives it a first-line recommendation in the developing world and it is commonly used there. Access, however, may be difficult as some countries label it as a controlled drug.
Adverse effects from medications are reported in 10% to 90% of people, depending on how and from whom the data is collected. Most adverse effects are dose-related and mild. Some examples include mood changes, sleepiness, or an unsteadiness in gait. Certain medications have side effects that are not related to dose such as rashes, liver toxicity, or suppression of the bone marrow. Up to a quarter of people stop treatment due to adverse effects. Some medications are associated with birth defects when used in pregnancy. Many of the common used medications, such as valproate, phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, and gabapentin have been reported to cause increased risk of birth defects, especially when used during the first trimester. Despite this, treatment is often continued once effective, because the risk of untreated epilepsy is believed to be greater than the risk of the medications. Among the antiepileptic medications, levetiracetam and lamotrigine seem to carry the lowest risk of causing birth defects.
Slowly stopping medications may be reasonable in some people who do not have a seizure for two to four years; however, around a third of people have a recurrence, most often during the first six months. Stopping is possible in about 70% of children and 60% of adults. Measuring medication levels is not generally needed in those whose seizures are well controlled.

===Surgery===
Epilepsy surgery should be considered for any person with epilepsy who is medically refractory. People with epilepsy are evaluated on a case-by-case basis in centres that are familiar with and have expertise in epilepsy surgery. Results from a 2023 systematic review found that surgical interventions for children aged 1–36 months with drug-resistant epilepsy can lead to significant seizure reduction or freedom, especially when other treatments have failed. Epilepsy surgery may be an option for people with focal seizures that remain a problem despite other treatments. These other treatments include at least a trial of two or three medications. The goal of surgery has been total control of seizures. However, most physicians believe that even palliative surgery where the burden of seizures is reduced significantly can help in achieving developmental progress or reversal of developmental stagnation in children with drug-resistant epilepsy and this may be achieved in 60–70% of cases. Common procedures include cutting out the hippocampus via an anterior temporal lobe resection, removal of tumors, and removing parts of the neocortex. Some procedures such as a corpus callosotomy are attempted in an effort to decrease the number of seizures rather than cure the condition. Following surgery, medications may be slowly withdrawn in many cases.

=== Neurostimulation ===
Neurostimulation via neuro-cybernetic prosthesis implantation may be another option in those who are not candidates for surgery, providing chronic, pulsatile electrical stimulation of specific nerve or brain regions, alongside standard care. Three types of neurotherapy have been used in those who do not respond to medications: vagus nerve stimulation (VNS), anterior thalamic stimulation, and closed-loop responsive stimulation (RNS).

==== Vagus nerve stimulation ====
Non-pharmacological modulation of neurotransmitters via high-level VNS (h-VNS) may reduce seizure frequency in children and adults who do not respond to medical and/or surgical therapy, when compared with low-level VNS (l-VNS). In a 2022 Cochrane review of four randomized controlled trials, with moderate certainty of evidence, people receiving h-VNS treatment were 73% more likely (13% more likely to 164% more likely) to experience a reduction in seizure frequency by at least 50% (the minimum threshold defined for individual clinical response). Potentially 249 (163 to 380) per 1000 people with drug-resistant epilepsy may achieve a 50% reduction in seizures following h-VNS, benefiting an additional 105 per 1000 people compared with l-VNS.

This outcome was limited by the number of studies available, and the quality of one trial in particular, wherein three people received l-VNS in error. A sensitivity analysis suggested that the best case scenario was that the likelihood of clinical response to h-VNS may be 91% (27% to 189%) higher than those receiving l-VNS. In the worst-case scenario, the likelihood of clinical response to h-VNS was still 61% higher (7% higher to 143% higher) than l-VNS.

Despite the potential benefit for h-VNS treatment, the Cochrane review also found that the risk of several adverse-effects was greater than those receiving l-VNS. There was moderate certainty of evidence that voice alteration or hoarseness risk may be 2.17(1.49 to 3.17) fold higher than people receiving l-VNS. Dyspnoea risk was also 2.45 (1.07 to 5.60) times that of l-VNS recipients, although the low number of events and studies meant that the certainty of evidence was low. The risk of rebound-withdrawal symptoms, coughing, pain and paraesthesia was unclear.

===Diet===
There is promising evidence that a ketogenic diet (high-fat, low-carbohydrate, adequate-protein) decreases the number of seizures and eliminates seizures in some; however, further research is necessary. A 2022 systematic review of the literature has found some evidence to support that a ketogenic diet or modified Atkins diet can be helpful in the treatment of epilepsy in some infants. These types of diets may be beneficial for children with drug-resistant epilepsy; the use for adults remains uncertain. The most commonly reported adverse effects were vomiting, constipation and diarrhoea. It is unclear why this diet works. In people with coeliac disease or non-celiac gluten sensitivity and occipital calcifications, a gluten-free diet may decrease the frequency of seizures.

===Other===
Avoidance therapy consists of minimizing or eliminating triggers. For example, those who are sensitive to light may have success with using a small television, avoiding video games, or wearing dark glasses. Operant-based biofeedback based on the EEG waves has some support in those who do not respond to medications. Psychological methods should not, however, be used to replace medications.

Exercise has been proposed as possibly useful for preventing seizures, with some data to support this claim. Some dogs, commonly referred to as seizure dogs, may help during or after a seizure. It is not clear if dogs have the ability to predict seizures before they occur.

There is moderate-quality evidence supporting the use of psychological interventions along with other treatments in epilepsy. This can improve quality of life, enhance emotional wellbeing, and reduce fatigue in adults and adolescents. Psychological interventions may also improve seizure control for some individuals by promoting self-management and adherence.

As an add-on therapy in those who are not well controlled with other medications, cannabidiol appears to be useful in some children. In 2018 the FDA approved this product for Lennox–Gastaut syndrome and Dravet syndrome.

There are a few studies on the use of dexamethasone for the successful treatment of drug-resistant seizures in both adults and children.

===Alternative medicine===
Alternative medicine, including acupuncture, routine vitamins, and yoga, have no reliable evidence to support their use in epilepsy. Melatonin, , is insufficiently supported by evidence. The trials were of poor methodological quality and it was not possible to draw any definitive conclusions.

Several supplements (with varied reliabilities of evidence) have been reported to be helpful for drug-resistant epilepsy. These include high-dose Omega-3, berberine, Manuka honey, reishi and lion&#x27;s mane mushrooms, curcumin, vitamin E, coenzyme Q-10, and resveratrol. The reason these can work (in theory) is that they reduce inflammation or oxidative stress, two of the major mechanism contributing to epilepsy.

== Contraception and pregnancy ==

Women of child-bearing age, including those with epilepsy, are at risk of unintended pregnancies if they are not using an effective form of contraception. Women with epilepsy may experience a temporary increase in seizure frequency when they begin hormonal contraception.

Some anti-seizure medications interact with enzymes in the liver and cause the drugs in hormonal contraception to be broken down more quickly. These enzyme inducing drugs make hormonal contraception less effective, and this is particularly hazardous if the anti-seizure medication is associated with birth defects. Potent enzyme-inducing anti-seizure medications include carbamazepine, eslicarbazepine acetate, oxcarbazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, primidone, and rufinamide. The drugs perampanel and topiramate can be enzyme-inducing at higher doses. Conversely, hormonal contraception can lower the amount of the anti-seizure medication lamotrigine circulating in the body, making it less effective. The failure rate of oral contraceptives, when used correctly, is 1%, but this increases to between 3–6% in women with epilepsy. Overall, intrauterine devices (IUDs) are preferred for women with epilepsy who are not intending to become pregnant.

Women with epilepsy, especially if they have other medical conditions, may have a slightly lower, but still high, chance of becoming pregnant. Women with infertility have about the same chance of success with in vitro fertilisation or other forms of assisted reproductive technology as women without epilepsy. There may be a higher risk of pregnancy loss.

Once pregnant, there are two main concerns related to pregnancy. The first concern is about the risk of seizures during pregnancy, and the second concern is that the anti-seizure medications may result in birth defects. Most women with epilepsy must continue treatment with anti-seizure drugs, and the treatment goal is to balance the need to prevent seizures with the need to prevent drug-induced birth defects.

Pregnancy does not seem to change seizure frequency very much. When seizures happen, however, they can cause some pregnancy complications, such as pre-term births or the babies being smaller than usual when they are born.

All pregnancies have a risk of birth defects, e.g., due to smoking during pregnancy. In addition to this typical level of risk, some anti-seizure drugs significantly increase the risk of birth defects and intrauterine growth restriction, as well as developmental, neurocognitive, and behavioral disorders. Most women with epilepsy receive safe and effective treatment and have typical, healthy children. The highest risks are associated with specific anti-seizure drugs, such as valproic acid and carbamazepine, and with higher doses. Folic acid supplementation, such as through prenatal vitamins, reduced the risk. Planning pregnancies in advance gives women with epilepsy an opportunity to switch to a lower-risk treatment program and reduced drug doses.

Although anti-seizure drugs can be found in breast milk, women with epilepsy can breastfeed their babies, and the benefits usually outweigh the risks.

==Prognosis==
Epilepsy cannot usually be cured, but medication can control seizures effectively in about 70% of cases. Of those with generalized seizures, more than 80% can be well controlled with medications while this is true in only 50% of people with focal seizures. One predictor of long-term outcome is the number of seizures that occur in the first six months. Other factors increasing the risk of a poor outcome include little response to the initial treatment, generalized seizures, a family history of epilepsy, psychiatric problems, and waves on the EEG representing generalized epileptiform activity. According to the ILAE epilepsy is considered to be resolved if an individual with epilepsy is seizure free for 10 years and off anticonvulsant for 5 years.

In the developing world, 75% of people are either untreated or not appropriately treated. In Africa, 90% do not get treatment. This is partly related to appropriate medications not being available or being too expensive.

===Mortality===
People with epilepsy may have a higher risk of premature death compared to those without the condition. This risk is estimated to be between 1.6 and 4.1 times greater than that of the general population. The greatest increase in mortality from epilepsy is among the elderly. Those with epilepsy due to an unknown cause have a relatively low increase in risk.

Mortality is often related to the underlying cause of the seizures, status epilepticus, suicide, trauma, and sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP). Death from status epilepticus is primarily due to an underlying problem rather than missing doses of medications. The risk of suicide is between two and six times higher in those with epilepsy; the cause of this is unclear. SUDEP appears to be partly related to the frequency of generalized tonic-clonic seizures and accounts for about 15% of epilepsy-related deaths; it is unclear how to decrease its risk.
Risk factors for SUDEP include nocturnal generalized tonic-clonic seizures, seizures, sleeping alone and medically intractable epilepsy.

In the United Kingdom, it is estimated that 40–60% of deaths are possibly preventable. In the developing world, many deaths are due to untreated epilepsy leading to falls or status epilepticus.

==Epidemiology==
Epilepsy is one of the most common serious neurological disorders affecting about 50 million people . It affects 1% of the population by age 20 and 3% of the population by age 75. It is more common in males than females with the overall difference being small. Most of those with the disorder (80%) are in low income populations or the developing world.

The estimated prevalence of active epilepsy () is in the range 3–10 per 1,000, with active epilepsy defined as someone with epilepsy who has had at least one unprovoked seizure in the last five years. Epilepsy begins each year in 40–70 per 100,000 in developed countries and 80–140 per 100,000 in developing countries. Poverty is a risk and includes both being from a poor country and being poor relative to others within one&#x27;s country. In the developed world epilepsy most commonly starts either in the young or in the old. In the developing world its onset is more common in older children and young adults due to the higher rates of trauma and infectious diseases. In developed countries the number of cases a year has decreased in children and increased among the elderly between the 1970s and 2003. This has been attributed partly to better survival following strokes in the elderly.

==History==
The oldest medical records show that epilepsy has been affecting people at least since the beginning of recorded history. Throughout ancient history, the condition was thought to be of a spiritual cause. The world&#x27;s oldest description of an epileptic seizure comes from a text in Akkadian (a language used in ancient Mesopotamia) and was written around 2000 BC. The person described in the text was diagnosed as being under the influence of a moon god, and underwent an exorcism. Epileptic seizures are listed in the Code of Hammurabi () as reason for which a purchased slave may be returned for a refund, and the Edwin Smith Papyrus () describes cases of individuals with epileptic convulsions.

The oldest known detailed record of the condition itself is in the &quot;Sakikku&quot;, a Babylonian cuneiform medical text from 10671046 BC. This text gives signs and symptoms, details treatment and likely outcomes, and describes many features of the different seizure types. As the Babylonians had no biomedical understanding of the nature of epilepsy, they attributed the seizures to possession by evil spirits and called for treating the condition through spiritual means. Around 900 BC, Punarvasu Atreya described epilepsy as loss of consciousness; this definition was carried forward into the Ayurvedic text of Charaka Samhita ().

The ancient Greeks had contradictory views of the condition. They thought of epilepsy as a form of spiritual possession, but also associated the condition with genius and the divine. One of the names they gave to it was the &quot;sacred disease&quot; (). Epilepsy appears within Greek mythology: it is associated with the Moon goddesses Selene and Artemis, who afflicted those who upset them. The Greeks thought that important figures such as Julius Caesar and Hercules had the condition. The notable exception to this divine and spiritual view was that of the school of Hippocrates. In the fifth century BC, Hippocrates rejected the idea that the condition was caused by spirits. In his landmark work &quot;On the Sacred Disease&quot;, he proposed that epilepsy was not divine in origin and instead was a medically treatable problem originating in the brain. He accused those of attributing a sacred cause to the condition of spreading ignorance through a belief in superstitious magic. Hippocrates proposed that heredity was important as a cause, described worse outcomes if the condition presents at an early age, and made note of the physical characteristics as well as the social shame associated with it. Instead of referring to it as the &quot;sacred disease&quot;, he used the term &quot;great disease&quot;, giving rise to the modern term &quot;grand mal&quot;, used for tonic–clonic seizures. Despite his work detailing the physical origins of the condition, his view was not accepted at the time. Evil spirits continued to be blamed until at least the 17th century.

In Ancient Rome people did not eat or drink with the same pottery as that used by someone who was affected. People of the time would spit on their chest believing that this would keep the problem from affecting them. According to Apuleius and other ancient physicians, to detect epilepsy, it was common to light a piece of &quot;gagates&quot;, whose smoke would trigger the seizure. Occasionally a spinning potter&#x27;s wheel was used, perhaps a reference to photosensitive epilepsy.

In most cultures, persons with epilepsy have been stigmatized, shunned, or even imprisoned. As late as in the second half of the 20th century, in Tanzania and other parts of Africa epilepsy was associated with possession by evil spirits, witchcraft, or poisoning and was believed by many to be contagious. In the Salpêtrière, the birthplace of modern neurology, Jean-Martin Charcot found people with epilepsy side by side with the mentally ill, those with chronic syphilis, and the criminally insane. In Ancient Rome, epilepsy was known as the or &#x27;disease of the assembly hall&#x27; and was seen as a curse from the gods. In northern Italy, epilepsy was traditionally known as Saint Valentine&#x27;s malady. In at least the 1840s in the United States of America, epilepsy was known as the &quot;falling sickness&quot; or &quot;the falling fits&quot;, and was considered a form of medical insanity. Around the same time period, epilepsy was known in France as the , , , , and . People of epilepsy in France were also known as , due to the seizures and loss of consciousness in an epileptic episode.

In the mid-19th century, the first effective anti-seizure medication, bromide, was introduced. The first modern treatment, phenobarbital, was developed in 1912, with phenytoin coming into use in 1938.

==Society and culture==
===Stigma===
Social stigma is commonly experienced, around the world, by those with epilepsy. It can affect people economically, socially and culturally. In India and China, epilepsy may be used as justification to deny marriage. People in some areas still believe those with epilepsy to be cursed. In parts of Africa, such as Tanzania and Uganda, epilepsy is claimed to be associated with possession by evil spirits, witchcraft, or poisoning and is incorrectly believed by many to be contagious. Before 1971 in the United Kingdom, epilepsy was considered grounds for the annulment of marriage. The stigma may result in some people with epilepsy denying that they have ever had seizures. A 2024 cross-sectional study revealed that 64.8% of relatives of epilepsy patients experienced moderate stigma and held moderately positive attitudes toward epilepsy. The study found that higher levels of stigma among participants were associated with more negative attitudes toward the condition. Additionally, relatives of patients who experienced frequent seizures (one or more per month) faced greater stigma, while those of patients who did not adhere to their medication regimen exhibited more negative attitudes toward epilepsy.

===Economics===

Seizures result in direct economic costs of about one billion dollars in the United States. Epilepsy resulted in economic costs in Europe of around 15.5 billion euros in 2004. In India epilepsy is estimated to result in costs of US$1.7 billion or 0.5% of the GDP. It is the cause of about 1% of emergency department visits (2% for emergency departments for children) in the United States.

===Vehicles===

Those with epilepsy are at about twice the risk of being involved in a motor vehicular collision and thus in many areas of the world are not allowed to drive or only able to drive if certain conditions are met. Diagnostic delay has been suggested to be a cause of some potentially avoidable motor vehicle collisions since at least one study showed that most motor vehicle accidents occurred in those with undiagnosed non-motor seizures as opposed to those with motor seizures at epilepsy onset. In some places physicians are required by law to report if a person has had a seizure to the licensing body while in others the requirement is only that they encourage the person in question to report it themselves. Countries that require physician reporting include Sweden, Austria, Denmark and Spain. Countries that require the individual to report include the UK and New Zealand, and physicians may report if they believe the individual has not already. In Canada, the United States and Australia the requirements around reporting vary by province or state. If seizures are well controlled most feel allowing driving is reasonable. The amount of time a person must be free from seizures before they can drive varies by country. Many countries require one to three years without seizures. In the United States the time needed without a seizure is determined by each state and is between three months and one year.

Those with epilepsy or seizures are typically denied a pilot license.
* In Canada if an individual has had no more than one seizure, they may be considered after five years for a limited license if all other testing is normal. Those with febrile seizures and drug related seizures may also be considered.
* In the United States, the Federal Aviation Administration does not allow those with epilepsy to get a commercial pilot license. Rarely, exceptions can be made for persons who have had an isolated seizure or febrile seizures and have remained free of seizures into adulthood without medication.
* In the United Kingdom, a full national private pilot license requires the same standards as a professional driver&#x27;s license. This requires a period of ten years without seizures while off medications. Those who do not meet this requirement may acquire a restricted license if free from seizures for five years.

===Support organizations===
There are organizations that provide support for people and families affected by epilepsy. The &quot;Out of the Shadows&quot; campaign, a joint effort by the World Health Organization, the ILAE and the International Bureau for Epilepsy, provides help internationally. In the United States, the Epilepsy Foundation is a national organization that works to increase the acceptance of those with the disorder, their ability to function in society and to promote research for a cure. The Epilepsy Foundation, some hospitals, and some individuals also run support groups in the United States. In Australia, the Epilepsy Foundation provides support, delivers education and training and funds research for people living with epilepsy.

International Epilepsy Day (World Epilepsy Day) began in 2015 and occurs on the second Monday in February.

Purple Day, a different world-wide epilepsy awareness day for epilepsy, was initiated by a nine-year-old Canadian named Cassidy Megan in 2008, and is every year on 26 March.

==Research==
===Seizure prediction and modeling===
Seizure prediction refers to attempts to forecast epileptic seizures based on the EEG before they occur. , no effective mechanism to predict seizures has been developed. Although no effective device that can predict seizures is available, the science behind seizure prediction and ability to deliver such a tool has made progress.

Kindling, where repeated exposures to events that could cause seizures eventually causes seizures more easily, has been used to create animal models of epilepsy.
Different animal models of epilepsy have been characterized in rodents that recapitulate the EEG and behavioral concomitants of different forms of epilepsy, in particular the occurrence of recurrent spontaneous seizures. Because epileptic seizures of different kinds are observed naturally in some of these animals, strains of mice and rats have been selected to be used as genetic models of epilepsy. In particular, several lines of mice and rats display spike-and-wave discharges when EEG recorded and have been studied to understand absence epilepsy. Among these models, the strain of GAERS (Genetic Absence Epilepsy Rats from Strasbourg) was characterized in the 1980s and has helped to understand the mechanisms underlying childhood absence epilepsy.

Rat brain slices serve as a valuable model for assessing the potential of compounds in reducing epileptiform activity. By evaluating the frequency of epileptiform bursting in hippocampal networks, researchers can identify promising candidates for novel anti-seizure drugs.

Reductionist views on the mechanisms of epileptiform discharges are often expressed through mathematical models. The simplest of these models are based on a few ordinary differential equations, such as the Epileptor model. The more physiologically explicit Epileptor-2 model replicates brief interictal discharges—observed as clusters of action potential spikes in the activity of individual neurons—and longer ictal discharges, represented as clusters of these shorter discharges. According to this model, brief interictal discharges are characterized as stochastic oscillations of the membrane potential and synaptic resources, while ictal discharges emerge as oscillations in the extracellular concentration of potassium ions and the intracellular concentration of sodium ions. These models demonstrate that ionic dynamics play a decisive role in the generation of pathological activity.

One of the hypotheses present in the literature is based on inflammatory pathways. Studies supporting this mechanism revealed that inflammatory, glycolipid, and oxidative factors are higher in people with epilepsy, especially those with generalized epilepsy.

===Potential future therapies===
Gene therapy is being studied in some types of epilepsy. Medications that alter immune function, such as intravenous immunoglobulins, may reduce the frequency of seizures when including in normal care as an add-on therapy; however, further research is required to determine whether these medications are very well tolerated in children and in adults with epilepsy. Noninvasive stereotactic radiosurgery is, , being compared to standard surgery for certain types of epilepsy.

==Other animals==

Epilepsy occurs in a number of other animals including dogs and cats; it is in fact the most common brain disorder in dogs. It is typically treated with anticonvulsants such as levetiracetam, phenobarbital, or bromide in dogs and phenobarbital in cats. Imepitoin is also used in dogs. While generalized seizures in horses are fairly easy to diagnose, it may be more difficult in non-generalized seizures and EEGs may be useful. Juvenile idiopathic epilepsy (JIE) in foals is a condition with varying outcomes, depending on the severity and management of the condition. Some foals eventually outgrow the condition without significant long-term effects, while others may face severe consequences, including death or lifelong complications, if left untreated. This variability highlights the importance of timely intervention and care. Earlier research has pointed to a significant genetic influence in the development of JIE, suggesting that the condition may follow the inheritance pattern of a single-gene trait. These findings underscore the need for further genetic studies to confirm this hypothesis and explore potential breeding strategies to reduce the prevalence of JIE.

<text>Extrasensory perception (ESP), also known as a sixth sense, or cryptaesthesia, is a claimed paranormal ability pertaining to reception of information not gained through the recognized physical senses, but sensed with the mind. The term was adopted by Duke University botanist J. B. Rhine to denote psychic abilities such as intuition, telepathy, psychometry, clairvoyance, clairaudience, clairsentience, empathy and their trans-temporal operation as precognition or retrocognition.

Second sight is an alleged form of extrasensory perception, whereby a person perceives information, in the form of a vision, about future events before they happen (precognition), or about things or events at remote locations (remote viewing). There is no evidence that second sight exists. Reports of second sight are known only from anecdotes. Second sight and ESP are classified as pseudosciences.

==History==
In the 1930s, at Duke University in North Carolina, J. B. Rhine and his wife Louisa E. Rhine conducted an investigation into extrasensory perception. While Louisa Rhine concentrated on collecting accounts of spontaneous cases, J. B. Rhine worked largely in the laboratory, carefully defining terms such as ESP and &quot;psi&quot; and designing experiments to test them. A simple set of black and white cards was developed, originally called Zener cards – now called ESP cards. They bear the symbols circle, square, wavy lines, cross, and star. There are five of each type of card in a pack of 25.

In a telepathy experiment, the &quot;sender&quot; looks at a series of cards while the &quot;receiver&quot; guesses the symbols. To try to observe clairvoyance, the pack of cards is hidden from everyone while the receiver guesses. To try to observe precognition, the order of the cards is determined after the guesses are made. Later he used dice to test for psychokinesis.

The parapsychology experiments at Duke evoked criticism from academics and others who challenged the concepts and evidence of ESP. A number of psychological departments attempted, unsuccessfully, to repeat Rhine&#x27;s experiments. W. S. Cox (1936) from Princeton University with 132 subjects produced 25,064 trials in a playing card ESP experiment. Cox concluded &quot;There is no evidence of extrasensory perception either in the &#x27;average man&#x27; or of the group investigated or in any particular individual of that group. The discrepancy between these results and those obtained by Rhine is due either to uncontrollable factors in experimental procedure or to the difference in the subjects.&quot; Four other psychological departments failed to replicate Rhine&#x27;s results.

In 1938, the psychologist Joseph Jastrow wrote that much of the evidence for extrasensory perception collected by Rhine and other parapsychologists was anecdotal, biased, dubious and the result of &quot;faulty observation and familiar human frailties&quot;. Rhine&#x27;s experiments were discredited due to the discovery that sensory leakage or cheating could account for all his results such as the subject being able to read the symbols from the back of the cards and being able to see and hear the experimenter to note subtle clues.

In the 1960s, parapsychologists became increasingly interested in the cognitive components of ESP, the subjective experience involved in making ESP responses, and the role of ESP in psychological life. This called for experimental procedures that were not limited to Rhine&#x27;s favored forced-choice methodology. Such procedures have included dream telepathy experiments, and the ganzfeld experiments (a mild sensory deprivation procedure).

Second sight may have originally been so called because normal vision was regarded as coming first, while supernormal vision is a secondary thing, confined to certain individuals. &quot;An dà shealladh&quot; or &quot;the two sights&quot;, meaning &quot;the sight of the seer&quot;, is the way Gaels refer to &quot;second sight&quot;, the involuntary ability of seeing the future or distant events. There are many Gaelic words for the various aspects of second sight, but &quot;an dà shealladh&quot; is the one mostly recognized by non-Gaelic speakers, even though, strictly speaking, it does not really mean second sight, but rather &quot;two sights&quot;.

==Skepticism==
Parapsychology is the study of paranormal psychic phenomena, including ESP. Parapsychology has been criticized for continuing investigation despite being unable to provide convincing evidence for the existence of any psychic phenomena after more than a century of research. The scientific community rejects ESP due to the absence of an evidence base, the lack of a theory which would explain ESP and the lack of positive experimental results; it considers ESP to be pseudoscience.

The scientific consensus does not view extrasensory perception as a scientific phenomenon. Skeptics have pointed out that there is no viable theory to explain the mechanism behind ESP, and that there are historical cases in which flaws have been discovered in the experimental design of parapsychological studies.

There are many criticisms pertaining to experiments involving extrasensory perception, particularly surrounding methodological flaws. These flaws are not unique to a single experimental design, and are effective in discrediting much of the positive research surrounding ESP. Many of the flaws seen in the Zener cards experiment are present in the Ganzfeld experiment as well. First is the stacking effect, an error that occurs in ESP research. Trial-by-trial feedback given in studies using a &quot;closed&quot; ESP target sequence (e.g., a deck of cards) violates the condition of independence used for most standard statistical tests. Multiple responses for a single target cannot be evaluated using statistical tests that assume independence of responses. This increases the likelihood of card counting and, in turn, increases the chances for the subject to guess correctly without using ESP. Another methodological flaw involves cues through sensory leakage, for example, when the subject receives a visual cue. This could be the reflection of a Zener card in the holder&#x27;s glasses. In this case, the subject is able to guess the card correctly because they can see it in the reflection, not because of ESP. Finally, poor randomization of target stimuli could be happening. Poor shuffling methods can make the orders of the cards easier to predict, or the cards could have been marked and manipulated, again, making it easier to predict which cards come next. The results of a meta-analysis found that when these errors were corrected and accounted for, there was still no significant effect of ESP. Many of the studies only appeared to have significant occurrence of ESP, when in fact, this result was due to the many methodological errors in the research.

===Dermo-optical perception===

In the early 20th century, Joaquin María Argamasilla, known as the &quot;Spaniard with X-ray Eyes&quot;, claimed to be able to read handwriting or numbers on dice through closed metal boxes. Argamasilla managed to fool Gustav Geley and Charles Richet into believing he had genuine psychic powers. In 1924, he was exposed by Harry Houdini as a fraud. Argamasilla peeked through his simple blindfold and lifted the edge of the box, so he could look inside it without others noticing.

Science writer Martin Gardner has written that the ignorance of blindfold deception methods has been widespread in investigations into objects at remote locations from persons who claim to possess second sight. Gardner documented various conjuring techniques psychics such as Rosa Kuleshova, Lina Anderson and Nina Kulagina have used to peek from their blindfolds to deceive investigators into believing they used second sight.
