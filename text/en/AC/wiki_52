<text>George Dewey Cukor ( ; July 7, 1899 – January 24, 1983) was an American film director and producer. He mainly concentrated on comedies and literary adaptations. His career flourished at RKO when David O. Selznick, the studio&#x27;s head of production, assigned Cukor to direct several of RKO&#x27;s major films, including &quot;What Price Hollywood?&quot; (1932), &quot;A Bill of Divorcement&quot; (1932), &quot;Our Betters&quot; (1933), and &quot;Little Women&quot; (1933). When Selznick moved to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer in 1933, Cukor followed and directed &quot;Dinner at Eight&quot; (1933) and &quot;David Copperfield&quot; (1935) for Selznick, and &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; (1936) and &quot;Camille&quot; (1936) for Irving Thalberg.

He was replaced as one of the directors of &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; (1939), but he went on to direct &quot;The Philadelphia Story&quot; (1940), &quot;Gaslight&quot; (1944), &quot;Adam&#x27;s Rib&quot; (1949), &quot;Born Yesterday&quot; (1950), &quot;A Star Is Born&quot; (1954), &quot;Bhowani Junction&quot; (1956), and won the Academy Award for Best Director for &quot;My Fair Lady&quot; (1964), which was his fifth time nominated. He continued to work into the early 1980s.

==Early life==
Cukor was born on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, the younger child and only son of Hungarian-Jewish immigrants Viktor, an assistant district attorney, and Helén Ilona Gross. His parents selected his (first and) middle name in honor of Spanish–American War hero George Dewey. The family was not particularly religious (pork was a staple on the dinner table), and when he started attending temple as a boy, Cukor learned Hebrew phonetically, with no real understanding of the meaning of the words or what they represented. As a result, he was ambivalent about his faith and dismissive of old world traditions from childhood, and as an adult he embraced Anglophilia to remove himself even further from his roots.

As a child, Cukor appeared in several amateur plays and took dance lessons, and at the age of seven he performed in a recital with David O. Selznick, who in later years became a mentor and friend. As a teenager, Cukor frequently was taken to the New York Hippodrome by his uncle. Infatuated with theatre, he often cut classes at DeWitt Clinton High School to attend afternoon matinees. During his senior year, he worked as a supernumerary with the Metropolitan Opera, earning 50¢ per appearance, and $1 if he was required to perform in blackface.

Following his graduation in 1917, Cukor was expected to follow in his father&#x27;s footsteps and pursue a career in law. He halfheartedly enrolled in the City College of New York, where he entered the Students Army Training Corps in October 1918. His military experience was limited; Germany surrendered in early November, and Cukor&#x27;s duty ended after only two months. He left school shortly afterwards.

==Career==
===Early stage career===

Cukor obtained a job as an assistant stage manager and bit player with a touring production of &quot;The Better &#x27;Ole&quot;, a popular British musical based on Old Bill, a cartoon character created by Bruce Bairnsfather. In 1920, he became the stage manager for the Knickerbocker Players, a troupe that shuttled between Syracuse, New York and Rochester, New York, and the following year he was hired as general manager of the newly formed Lyceum Players, an upstate summer stock company. In 1925, he formed the C.F. and Z. Production Company with Walter Folmer and John Zwicki, which gave him his first opportunity to direct. Following their first season, he made his Broadway directorial debut with &quot;Antonia&quot; by Hungarian playwright Melchior Lengyel, then returned to Rochester, where C.F. and Z. evolved into the Cukor-Kondolf Stock Company, a troupe that included Louis Calhern, Ilka Chase, Phyllis Povah, Frank Morgan, Reginald Owen, Elizabeth Patterson and Douglass Montgomery, all of whom worked with Cukor in later years in Hollywood. Lasting only one season with the company was Bette Davis. Cukor later recalled: &quot;Her talent was apparent, but she did buck at direction. She had her own ideas, and though she only did bits and ingenue roles, she didn&#x27;t hesitate to express them.&quot; For the next several decades, Davis claimed she was fired, and although Cukor never understood why she placed so much importance on an incident he considered so minor, he never worked with her again.

For the next few years, Cukor alternated between Rochester in the summer months and Broadway in the winter. His direction of a 1926 stage adaptation of &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; by Owen Davis brought him to the attention of the New York critics. Writing in the &quot;Brooklyn Eagle&quot;, drama critic Arthur Pollock called it &quot;an unusual piece of work by a director not nearly so well known as he should be.&quot; Cukor directed six more Broadway productions, then departed for Hollywood in 1929.

===Early Hollywood career===
When Hollywood began to recruit New York theater talent for sound films, Cukor immediately answered the call. In December 1928, Paramount Pictures signed him to a contract that reimbursed him for his train fare and initially paid him $600 per week with no screen credit during a six-month apprenticeship. He arrived in Hollywood in February 1929, and his first assignment was to coach the cast of &quot;River of Romance&quot; to speak with an acceptable Southern accent. In October, the studio lent him to Universal Pictures to conduct the screen tests and work as a dialogue director for &quot;All Quiet on the Western Front&quot;, released in 1930. That year, he co-directed three films at Paramount, and his weekly salary was increased to $1,500. He made his solo directorial debut with &quot;Tarnished Lady&quot; (1931) starring Tallulah Bankhead.

Cukor was then assigned to &quot;One Hour with You&quot; (1932), an operetta with Maurice Chevalier and Jeanette MacDonald, when original director Ernst Lubitsch opted to concentrate on producing the film instead. At first the two men worked well together, but two weeks into filming Lubitsch began arriving on the set on a regular basis, and he soon began directing scenes with Cukor&#x27;s consent. Upon the film&#x27;s completion, Lubitsch approached Paramount general manager B.P. Schulberg and threatened to leave the studio if Cukor&#x27;s name wasn&#x27;t removed from the credits. When Schulberg asked him to cooperate, Cukor filed suit. He eventually settled for being billed as assistant director and then left Paramount to work with David O. Selznick at RKO Studios.

Cukor quickly earned a reputation as a director who could coax great performances from actresses and he became known as a &quot;woman&#x27;s director&quot;, a title he resented. Despite this reputation, during his career, he oversaw more performances honored with the Academy Award for Best Actor than any other director: James Stewart in &quot;The Philadelphia Story&quot; (1940), Ronald Colman in &quot;A Double Life&quot; (1947), and Rex Harrison in &quot;My Fair Lady&quot; (1964). One of Cukor&#x27;s earlier ingenues was actress Katharine Hepburn, who debuted in &quot;A Bill of Divorcement&quot; (1932) and whose looks and personality left RKO officials at a loss as to how to use her. Cukor directed her in several films, both successful, such as &quot;Little Women&quot; (1933) and &quot;The Philadelphia Story&quot; (1940), and disastrous, such as &quot;Sylvia Scarlett&quot; (1935). Cukor and Hepburn became close friends off the set.

Cukor was hired to direct &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; by Selznick in 1936, even before the book was published. He spent the next two years involved with pre-production, including supervision of the numerous screen tests of actresses anxious to portray Scarlett O&#x27;Hara. Cukor favored Hepburn for the role, but Selznick, concerned about her reputation as &quot;box office poison&quot;, would not consider her without a screen test, and the actress refused to film one. Of those who did, Cukor preferred Paulette Goddard, but her supposedly illicit relationship with Charlie Chaplin (they were, in fact, secretly married) concerned Selznick.

Between his &quot;Wind&quot; chores, the director assisted with other projects. He filmed the cave scene for &quot;The Adventures of Tom Sawyer&quot; (1938), and, following the firing of its original director Richard Thorpe, Cukor spent a week on the set of &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; (1939). Although he filmed no footage, he made crucial changes to the look of Dorothy by eliminating Judy Garland&#x27;s blonde wig and adjusting her makeup and costume, encouraging her to act in a more natural manner. Additionally, Cukor softened the Scarecrow&#x27;s makeup and gave Margaret Hamilton a different hairstyle for the Wicked Witch of the West, as well as altering her makeup and other facial features. Cukor also suggested that the studio cast Jack Haley, on loan from 20th Century Fox, as the Tin Man.
Cukor spent many hours coaching Vivien Leigh and Olivia de Havilland before the start of filming &quot;Wind&quot;, but Clark Gable resisted his efforts to get him to master a Southern accent. However, despite rumors about Gable being uncomfortable with Cukor on the set, nothing in the internal memos of David O. Selznick indicates or suggests that Clark Gable had anything to do with Cukor&#x27;s dismissal from the film. Rather, they show Selznick&#x27;s mounting dissatisfaction with Cukor&#x27;s slow pace and quality of work. From a private letter from journalist Susan Myrick to Margaret Mitchell in February 1939: &quot;George [Cukor] finally told me all about it. He hated [leaving the production] very much he said but he could not do otherwise. In effect he said he is an honest craftsman and he cannot do a job unless he knows it is a good job and he feels the present job is not right. For days, he told me he has looked at the rushes and felt he was failing...the things did not click as it should. Gradually he became convinced that the script was the trouble...So George just told David he would not work any longer if the script was not better and he wanted the [Sidney] Howard script back...he would not let his name go out over a lousy picture...and bull-headed David said &#x27;OK get out!&#x27;&quot;

Selznick had already been unhappy with Cukor (&quot;a very expensive luxury&quot;) for not being more receptive to directing other Selznick assignments, even though Cukor had remained on salary since early 1937; and in a confidential memo written in September 1938, four months before principal photography began, Selznick flirted with the idea of replacing him with Victor Fleming. &quot;I think the biggest black mark against our management to date is the Cukor situation and we can no longer be sentimental about it...We are a business concern and not patrons of the arts.&quot; Cukor was relieved of his duties, but he continued to work with Leigh and Olivia de Havilland off the set. Various rumors about the reasons behind his dismissal circulated throughout Hollywood. Selznick&#x27;s friendship with Cukor had crumbled slightly when the director refused other assignments, including &quot;A Star Is Born&quot; (1937) and &quot;Intermezzo&quot; (1939). Given that Gable and Cukor had worked together before (on &quot;Manhattan Melodrama&quot;, 1934) and Gable had no objection to working with him then, and given Selznick&#x27;s desperation to get Gable for Rhett Butler, if Gable had any objections to Cukor, certainly they would have been expressed before he signed his contract for the film. Yet, writer Gore Vidal, in his autobiography &quot;Point to Point Navigation&quot;, recounted that Gable demanded that Cukor be fired off &quot;Wind&quot; because, according to Vidal, the young Gable had been a male hustler and Cukor had been one of his johns. This has been confirmed by Hollywood biographer E.J. Fleming, who has recounted that, during a particularly difficult scene, Gable erupted publicly, screaming: &quot;I can&#x27;t go on with this picture. I won&#x27;t be directed by a fairy. I have to work with a real man.&quot;

Cukor&#x27;s dismissal from &quot;Wind&quot; freed him to direct &quot;The Women&quot; (1939), which has an all-female cast, followed by &quot;The Philadelphia Story&quot; (1940). He also directed Greta Garbo, another of his favorite actresses, in &quot;Two-Faced Woman&quot; (1941), her last film before she retired from the screen.
In 1942, at the age of 43, Cukor enlisted in the Signal Corps. Following basic training at Fort Monmouth, he was assigned to the old Paramount studios in Astoria, Queens (where he had directed three films in the early 1930s), although he was permitted to lodge at the St. Regis Hotel in Manhattan. Working with Irwin Shaw, John Cheever and William Saroyan, among others, Cukor produced training and instructional films for army personnel. Because he lacked an officer&#x27;s commission, he found it difficult to give orders and directions to his superiors. Despite his efforts to rise above the rank of private—he even called upon Frank Capra to intercede on his behalf—he never achieved officer&#x27;s status or any commendations during his six months of service. In later years, Cukor suspected his homosexuality impeded him from receiving any advances or honors, although rumors to that effect could not be confirmed.

The remainder of the decade was a series of hits and misses for Cukor. Both &quot;Two-Faced Woman&quot; and &quot;Her Cardboard Lover&quot; (1942) were commercial failures. More successful were &quot;A Woman&#x27;s Face&quot; (1941) with Joan Crawford and &quot;Gaslight&quot; (1944) about a woman suffering from suspicion with Ingrid Bergman and Charles Boyer. During this era, Cukor forged an alliance with screenwriters Garson Kanin and Ruth Gordon, who had met in Cukor&#x27;s home in 1939 and married three years later. Over the course of seven years, the trio collaborated on seven films, including &quot;A Double Life&quot; (1947) starring Ronald Colman, &quot;Adam&#x27;s Rib&quot; (1949), &quot;Born Yesterday&quot; (1950), &quot;The Marrying Kind&quot; (1952), and &quot;It Should Happen to You&quot; (1954), all featuring Judy Holliday, another Cukor favorite, who won the Academy Award for Best Actress for &quot;Born Yesterday&quot;.

===Later Hollywood career===

In December 1952, Cukor was approached by Sid Luft, who proposed the director helm a musical remake of &quot;A Star Is Born&quot; (1937) with his then-wife Judy Garland in the lead role. Cukor had declined to direct the earlier film because it was too similar to his own &quot;What Price Hollywood?&quot; (1932), but the opportunity to direct his first Technicolor film and work with screenwriter Moss Hart and especially Garland appealed to him, and he accepted. Getting the updated &quot;A Star Is Born&quot; (1954) to the screen proved to be a challenge. Cukor wanted Cary Grant for the male lead and went so far as to read the entire script with him, but Grant, while agreeing it was the role of a lifetime, steadfastly refused to do it, and Cukor never forgave him. The director then suggested either Humphrey Bogart or Frank Sinatra tackle the part, but Jack L. Warner rejected both. Stewart Granger was the front runner for a period of time, but he backed out when he was unable to adjust to Cukor&#x27;s habit of acting out scenes as a form of direction. James Mason eventually was contracted, and filming began on October 12, 1953. As the months passed, Cukor was forced to deal not only with constant script changes but a very unstable Garland, who was plagued by chemical and alcohol dependencies, extreme weight fluctuations, and real and imagined illnesses. In March 1954, a rough cut still missing several musical numbers was assembled, and Cukor had mixed feelings about it. When the last scene finally was filmed in the early morning hours of July 28, 1954, Cukor already had departed the production and was unwinding in Europe. The first preview the following month ran 210 minutes and, despite ecstatic feedback from the audience, Cukor and editor Folmar Blangsted trimmed it to 182 minutes for its New York premiere in October. The reviews were the best of Cukor&#x27;s career, but Warner executives, concerned the running time would limit the number of daily showings, made drastic cuts without Cukor, who had departed for Pakistan to scout locations for the epic &quot;Bhowani Junction&quot; in 1954–1955. At its final running time of 154 minutes, the film had lost musical numbers and crucial dramatic scenes, and Cukor called it &quot;very painful&quot;. He was not included in the film&#x27;s six Oscar nominations.
Over the next 10 years, Cukor directed a handful of films with varying success. &quot;Les Girls&quot; (1957) won the Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy, and &quot;Wild Is the Wind&quot; (also 1957) earned Oscar nominations for Anna Magnani and Anthony Quinn, but neither &quot;Heller in Pink Tights&quot; nor &quot;Let&#x27;s Make Love&quot; (both 1960) were box-office hits. Another project during this period was the ill-fated &quot;Something&#x27;s Got to Give&quot;, an updated remake of the comedy &quot;My Favorite Wife&quot; (1940). Cukor liked leading lady Marilyn Monroe but found it difficult to deal with her erratic work habits, frequent absences from the set, and the constant presence of Monroe&#x27;s acting coach Paula Strasberg. It was reported at the time that after 32 days of shooting, the director had only 7½ minutes of usable film. Footage would be discovered in the 1990s that showed at least 37 minutes of total footage had survived. Then Monroe travelled to New York to appear at a birthday celebration for President John F. Kennedy at Madison Square Garden, where she serenaded Kennedy. Studio documents released after Monroe&#x27;s death confirmed that her appearance at the political fundraising event was approved by Fox executives. The production came to a halt when Cukor had filmed every scene not involving Monroe and the actress remained unavailable. 20th Century Fox executive Peter Levathes fired her and hired Lee Remick to replace her, prompting co-star Dean Martin to quit because his contract guaranteed he would be playing opposite Monroe. It was also reported at the time that with the production already $2 million over budget and everyone back at the starting gate, the studio pulled the plug on the project. However, Monroe successfully renegotiated her contract from $100,000 to $500,000 with a bonus should the film be completed on time. Cukor was to be replaced by Jean Negulesco. There was limited press at the time about the project restarting and even less on Cukor being replaced. When Monroe was found dead in her home in the beginning of August, Cukor would give a high profile interview discussing Monroe&#x27;s many reported problems.

Two years later, Cukor achieved one of his greatest successes with &quot;My Fair Lady&quot; (1964). Throughout filming, there were mounting tensions between the director and designer Cecil Beaton; Cukor was thrilled with leading lady Audrey Hepburn, but the crew was less enchanted with her diva-like demands. Although several reviews were critical of the film – Pauline Kael said it &quot;staggers along&quot; and Stanley Kauffmann thought Cukor&#x27;s direction was like &quot;a rich gravy poured over everything, not remotely as delicately rich as in the Asquith–Howard 1937 [&quot;sic&quot;] &quot;Pygmalion&quot;&quot;—the film was a box-office hit which won him the Academy Award for Best Director, the Golden Globe Award for Best Director, and the Directors Guild of America Award after having been nominated for each several times.

Following &quot;My Fair Lady&quot;, Cukor became less active. He directed Maggie Smith in &quot;Travels with My Aunt&quot; (1972) and helmed the critical and commercial flop &quot;The Blue Bird&quot; (1976), the first joint Soviet-American production. He reunited twice with Katharine Hepburn for the television movies &quot;Love Among the Ruins&quot; (1975) and &quot;The Corn Is Green&quot; (1979). At the age of 82, Cukor directed his final film, &quot;Rich and Famous&quot; for MGM in 1981, starring Jacqueline Bisset and Candice Bergen.

In 1970, he received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement.

Cukor wanted the Academy to host a film festival in Los Angeles however the olan did not materialise and Cukor ended up being co-founder of the Los Angeles International Film Exposition (Filmex) in 1970.

In 1976, Cukor was awarded the George Eastman Award, given by George Eastman House for distinguished contribution to the art of film.

==Personal life==

It was an open secret in Hollywood that Cukor was gay, at a time when society was against it, although he was discreet about his sexual orientation and &quot;never carried it as a pin on his lapel&quot;, as producer Joseph L. Mankiewicz put it. He was a celebrated &quot;bon vivant&quot; whose luxurious home was the site of weekly Sunday afternoon parties attended by closeted celebrities and the attractive young men they met in bars and gyms and brought with them. At least once, in the midst of his reign at MGM, he was arrested on vice charges, but studio executives managed to get the charges dropped and all records of it expunged, and the incident was never publicized by the press. In the late 1950s, Cukor became involved with a considerably younger man named George Towers. He financed his education at the Los Angeles State College of Applied Arts and Sciences and the University of Southern California, from which Towers graduated with a law degree in 1967. That fall Towers married a woman, and his relationship with Cukor evolved into one of father and son, and for the remainder of Cukor&#x27;s life the two remained very close.

By the mid-1930s, Cukor was not only established as a prominent director, but also socially as an unofficial head of Hollywood&#x27;s gay subculture. His home, redecorated in 1935 by gay actor-turned-interior designer William Haines with gardens designed by Florence Yoch and Lucile Council, was the scene of many gatherings for the industry&#x27;s homosexuals. The close-knit group reputedly included Haines and his partner Jimmie Shields, writer W. Somerset Maugham, director James Vincent, screenwriter Rowland Leigh, costume designers Orry-Kelly and Robert Le Maire, and actors John Darrow, Anderson Lawler, Grady Sutton, Robert Seiter, and Tom Douglas. Frank Horn, secretary to Cary Grant, was also a frequent guest.

Cukor&#x27;s friends were of paramount importance to him and he kept his home filled with their photographs. Regular attendees at his soirées included Katharine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy, Joan Crawford and Douglas Fairbanks Jr., Lauren Bacall and Humphrey Bogart, Claudette Colbert, Marlene Dietrich, Laurence Olivier and Vivien Leigh, actor Richard Cromwell, Stanley Holloway, Judy Garland, Gene Tierney, Noël Coward, Cole Porter, director James Whale, costume designer Edith Head, and Norma Shearer, especially after the death of her first husband Irving Thalberg. He often entertained literary figures like Sinclair Lewis, Theodore Dreiser, Hugh Walpole, Aldous Huxley, and Ferenc Molnár.

Frances Goldwyn, second wife and widow of studio mogul Sam Goldwyn, long considered Cukor to be the love of her life, but their relationship remained platonic. According to biographer A. Scott Berg, Frances even arranged for Cukor&#x27;s burial to be adjacent to her own plot at Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery.

The PBS series &quot;American Masters&quot; produced a comprehensive documentary about his life and work titled &quot;On Cukor&quot; directed by Robert Trachtenberg in 2000.

==Death and legacy==
Cukor died of a heart attack on January 24, 1983, and was interred in Grave D, Little Garden of Constancy, Garden of Memory (private), Forest Lawn Memorial Park (Glendale), California. Records in probate court indicated his net worth at the time of his death was $2,377,720.

In 1983, the 1954 version of &quot;A Star Is Born&quot;, considered by many to be his greatest picture, was restored to its original runtime of 181 minutes. The film was initially released at 181 minutes and received enormous critical and box office success. Finding that the length restricted the number of daily showings, the studio cut the movie to 154 minutes. Cukor believed this re-release &quot;butchered&quot; the gradual development of the Garland–Mason relationship.

In 2013, The Film Society of Lincoln Center presented a comprehensive weeks-long retrospective of his work titled &quot;The Discreet Charm of George Cukor&quot;.

In 2019, Cukor&#x27;s film &quot;Gaslight&quot; was selected by the Library of Congress for preservation in the National Film Registry for being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

<text>A gas mask is a piece of personal protective equipment used to protect the wearer from inhaling airborne pollutants and toxic gases. The mask forms a sealed cover over the nose and mouth, but may also cover the eyes and other vulnerable soft tissues of the face. Most gas masks are also respirators, though the word &quot;gas mask&quot; is often used to refer to military equipment (such as a field protective mask), the scope used in this article. Gas masks only protect the user from ingesting or inhaling chemical agents, as well as preventing contact with the user&#x27;s eyes (many chemical agents affect through eye contact). Most combined gas mask filters will last around 8 hours in a biological or chemical situation. Filters against specific chemical agents can last up to 20 hours.

Airborne toxic materials may be gaseous (for example, chlorine or mustard gas), or particulates (such as biological agents). Many filters provide protection from both types.

The first gas masks mostly used circular lenses made of glass, mica or cellulose acetate to allow vision. Glass and mica were quite brittle and needed frequent replacement. The later Triplex lens style (a cellulose acetate lens sandwiched between glass ones) became more popular, and alongside plain cellulose acetate they became the standard into the 1930s. Panoramic lenses were not popular until the 1930s, but there are some examples of those being used even during the war (Austro-Hungarian 15M). Later, stronger polycarbonate came into use.

Some masks have one or two compact air filter containers screwed onto inlets, while others have a large air filtration container connected to the gas mask via a hose that is sometimes confused with an &quot;air-supplied respirator&quot; in which an alternate supply of fresh air (oxygen tanks) is delivered.

==History and development==
===Early breathing devices===
According to &quot;Popular Mechanics&quot;, &quot;The common sponge was used in ancient Greece as a gas mask...&quot; In 1785, Jean-François Pilâtre de Rozier invented a respirator.

Primitive respirator examples were used by miners and introduced by Alexander von Humboldt in 1799, when he worked as a mining engineer in Prussia. The forerunner to the modern gas mask was invented in 1847 by Lewis P. Haslett, a device that contained elements that allowed breathing through a nose and mouthpiece, inhalation of air through a bulb-shaped filter, and a vent to exhale air back into the atmosphere. &quot;First Facts&quot; states that a &quot;gas mask resembling the modern type&quot; was patented by Lewis Phectic Haslett of Louisville, Kentucky, who received a patent on June 12, 1849. U.S. patent #6,529 issued to Haslett, described the first &quot;Inhaler or Lung Protector&quot; that filtered dust from the air.

Early versions were constructed by the Scottish chemist John Stenhouse in 1854 and the physicist John Tyndall in the 1870s. Another early design was the &quot;Safety Hood and Smoke Protector&quot; invented by Garrett Morgan in 1912, and patented in 1914. It was a simple device consisting of a cotton hood with two hoses which hung down to the floor, allowing the wearer to breathe the safer air found there. In addition, moist sponges were inserted at the end of the hoses in order to better filter the air.&lt;ref name=&quot;pbs.org/wgbh/theymadeamerica2&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===World War I=== 

The First World War brought about the first need for mass-produced gas masks on both sides because of extensive use of chemical weapons. The German army successfully used poison gas for the first time against Allied troops at the Second Battle of Ypres, Belgium on April 22, 1915. An immediate response was cotton wool wrapped in muslin, issued to the troops by May 1. This was followed by the Black Veil Respirator, invented by John Scott Haldane, which was a cotton pad soaked in an absorbent solution which was secured over the mouth using black cotton veiling.

Seeking to improve on the Black Veil respirator, Cluny Macpherson created a mask made of chemical-absorbing fabric which fitted over the entire head: a canvas hood treated with chlorine-absorbing chemicals, and fitted with a transparent mica eyepiece. Macpherson presented his idea to the British War Office Anti-Gas Department on May 10, 1915; prototypes were developed soon after. The design was adopted by the British Army and introduced as the British Smoke Hood in June 1915; Macpherson was appointed to the War Office Committee for Protection against Poisonous Gases. More elaborate sorbent compounds were added later to further iterations of his helmet (PH helmet), to defeat other respiratory poison gases used such as phosgene, diphosgene and chloropicrin. In summer and autumn 1915, Edward Harrison, Bertram Lambert and John Sadd developed the Large Box Respirator. This canister gas mask had a tin can containing the absorbent materials by a hose and began to be issued in February 1916. A compact version, the Small Box Respirator, was made a universal issue from August 1916.

In the first gas masks of World War I, it was initially found that wood charcoal was a good absorbent of poison gases. Around 1918, it was found that charcoals made from the shells and seeds of various fruits and nuts such as coconuts, chestnuts, horse-chestnuts, and peach stones performed much better than wood charcoal. These waste materials were collected from the public in recycling programs to assist the war effort.

The first effective filtering activated charcoal gas mask in the world was invented in 1915 by Russian chemist Nikolay Zelinsky.

Also in World War I, since dogs were frequently used on the front lines, a special type of gas mask was developed that dogs were trained to wear. Other gas masks were developed during World War I and the time following for horses in the various mounted units that operated near the front lines. In America, thousands of gas masks were produced for American as well as Allied troops. Mine Safety Appliances was a chief producer. This mask was later used widely in industry.

===World War II===
The British Respirator, Anti-Gas (Light) was developed in 1943 by the British. It was made of plastic and rubber-like material that greatly reduced the weight and bulk compared to World War I gas masks, and fitted the user&#x27;s face more snugly and comfortably. The main improvement was replacing the separate filter canister connected with a hose by an easily replaceable filter canister screwed on the side of the gas mask. Also, it had replaceable plastic lenses.

=== Modern mask ===
Gas mask development since has mirrored the development of chemical agents in warfare, filling the need to protect against ever more deadly threats, biological weapons, and radioactive dust in the nuclear era. However, for agents that cause harm through contact or penetration of the skin, such as blister agent or nerve agent, a gas mask alone is not sufficient protection, and full protective clothing must be worn in addition to protect from contact with the atmosphere. For reasons of civil defence and personal protection, individuals often buy gas masks since they believe that they protect against the harmful effects of an attack with nuclear, biological, or chemical (NBC) agents, which is only partially true, as gas masks protect only against respiratory absorption. Most military gas masks are designed to be capable of protecting against all NBC agents, but they can have filter canisters proof against those agents (heavier) or only against riot control agents and smoke (lighter and often used for training purposes). There are lightweight masks solely for protection against riot-control agents and not for NBC situations.

Although thorough training and the availability of gas masks and other protective equipment can nullify the casualty-causing effects of an attack by chemical agents, troops who are forced to operate in full protective gear are less efficient in completing tasks, tire easily, and may be affected psychologically by the threat of attack by those weapons. During the Cold War, it was seen as inevitable that there would be a constant NBC threat on the battlefield and so troops needed protection in which they could remain fully functional; thus, protective gear and especially gas masks have evolved to incorporate innovations in terms of increasing user comfort and compatibility with other equipment (from drinking devices to artificial respiration tubes, to communications systems etc.).
During the Iran–Iraq War (1980–88), Iraq developed its chemical weapons program with the help of European countries such as Germany and France and used them in a large scale against Iranians and Iraqi Kurds. Iran was unprepared for chemical warfare. In 1984, Iran received gas masks from the Republic of Korea and East Germany, but the Korean masks were not suited for the faces of non-East Asian people, the filter lasted for only 15 minutes, and the 5,000 masks bought from East Germany proved to be not gas masks but spray-painting goggles. As late as 1986, Iranian diplomats still travelled in Europe to buy active charcoal and models of filters to produce defensive gear domestically. In April 1988, Iran started domestic production of gas masks by the Iran Yasa factories.

==Principles of construction==
Absorption is the process of being drawn into a (usually larger) body or substrate, and adsorption is the process of deposition upon a surface. This can be used to remove both particulate and gaseous hazards. Although some form of reaction may take place, it is not necessary; the method may work by attractive charges. For example, if the target particles are positively charged, a negatively charged substrate may be used. Examples of substrates include activated carbon, and zeolites. This effect can be very simple and highly effective, for example using a damp cloth to cover the mouth and nose while escaping a fire. While this method can be effective at trapping particulates produced by combustion, it does not filter out harmful gases which may be toxic or which displace the oxygen required for survival.

===Safety of old gas masks===
Gas masks have a useful lifespan limited by the absorbent capacity of the filter. Filters cease to provide protection when saturated with hazardous chemicals, and degrade over time even if sealed. Most gas masks have sealing caps over the air intake and are stored in vacuum-sealed bags to prevent the filter from degrading due to exposure to humidity and pollutants in normal air. Unused gas mask filters from World War II may not protect the wearer at all, and could be harmful if worn due to long-term changes in the chemical composition of the filter.
Some World War II and Soviet Cold War gas mask filters contained chrysotile asbestos or crocidolite asbestos. not known to be harmful at the time. It is not reliably known for how long the materials were used in filters.

Typically, masks using 40 mm connections are a more recent design. Rubber degrades with time, so boxed unused &quot;modern type&quot; masks can be cracked and leak. The US C2 canister (black) contains hexavalent chromium; studies by the U.S. Army Chemical Corps found that the level in the filter was acceptable, but suggest caution when using, as it is a carcinogen.

=== Modern filter classification ===

The filter is selected according to the toxic compound. Each filter type protects against a particular hazard and is color-coded:

Particle filters are often included, because in many cases the hazardous materials are in the form of mist, which can be captured by the particle filter before entering the chemical adsorber. In Europe and jurisdictions with similar rules such as Russia and Australia, filter types are given suffix numbers to indicate their capacity. For non-particle hazards, the level &quot;1&quot; is assumed and a number &quot;2&quot; is used to indicate a better level. For particles (P), three levels are always given with the number. In the US, only the particle part is further classified by NIOSH air filtration ratings.

A filter type that can protect against multiple hazards is notated with the European symbols concatenated with each other. Examples include ABEK, ABEK-P3, and ABEK-HgP3. A2B2E2K2-P3 is the highest rating of filter available. An entirely different &quot;multi/CBRN&quot; filter class with an olive color is used in the US.

Filtration may be aided with an air pump to improve wearer comfort. Filtration of air is only possible if there is sufficient oxygen in the first place. Thus, when handling asphyxiants, or when ventilation is poor or the hazards are unknown, filtration is not possible and air must be supplied (with a SCBA system) from a pressurized bottle as in scuba diving.

== Use ==
A modern mask typically is constructed of an elastic polymer in various sizes. It is fitted with various adjustable straps which may be tightened to secure a good fit. Crucially, it is connected to a filter cartridge near the mouth either directly, or via a flexible hose. Some models contain drinking tubes which may be connected to a water bottle. Corrective lens inserts are also available for users who require them.

Masks are typically tested for fit before use. After a mask is fitted, it is often tested by various challenge agents. Isoamyl acetate, a synthetic banana flavourant, and camphor are often used as innocuous challenge agents. In the military, teargases such as CN, CS, and stannic chloride in a chamber may be used to give the users confidence in the efficacy of the mask.

== Shortcomings ==
The protection of a gas mask comes with some disadvantages. The wearer of a typical gas mask must exert extra effort to breathe, and some of the exhaled air is re-inhaled due to the dead space between the facepiece and the user&#x27;s face. The exposure to carbon dioxide may exceed its OELs (0.5% by volume/9 grammes per cubic metre for an eight-hour shift; 1.4%/27 grammes per m3 for 15 minutes&#x27; exposure) by a factor of many times: for gas masks and elastomeric respirators, up to 2.6%); and in case of long-term use, headache, dermatitis and acne may appear. The UK HSE textbook recommends limiting the use of respirators without air supply (that is, not PAPR) to one hour.

==Reaction and exchange==

This principle relies on substances harmful to humans being usually more reactive than air. This method of separation will use some form of generally reactive substance (for example an acid) coating or supported by some solid material. An example is synthetic resins. These can be created with different groups of atoms (usually called functional groups) that have different properties. Thus a resin can be tailored to a particular toxic group. When the reactive substance comes in contact with the resin, it will bond to it, removing it from the air stream. It may also exchange with a less harmful substance at this site.

Though it was crude, the hypo helmet was a stopgap measure for British troops in the trenches that offered at least some protection during a gas attack. As the months passed and poison gas was used more often, more sophisticated gas masks were developed and introduced. There are two main difficulties with gas mask design:
* The user may be exposed to many types of toxic material. Military personnel are especially prone to being exposed to a diverse range of toxic gases. However, if the mask is for a particular use (such as the protection from a specific toxic material in a factory), then the design can be much simpler and the cost lower.
* The protection will wear off over time. Filters will clog up, substrates for absorption will fill up, and reactive filters will run out of reactive substances. Thus the user only has protection for a limited time, and then they must either replace the filter device in the mask, or use a new mask.

<text>George Frideric (or Frederick) Handel ( ; baptised , ; 23 February 1685 – 14 April 1759) was a German-British Baroque composer well-known for his operas, oratorios, anthems, concerti grossi, and organ concerti. 

Born in Halle, Germany, Handel spent his early life in Hamburg and Italy before settling in London in 1712, where he spent the bulk of his career and became a naturalised British subject in 1727. He was strongly influenced both by the middle-German polyphonic choral tradition and by composers of the Italian Baroque. In turn, Handel&#x27;s music forms one of the peaks of the &quot;high baroque&quot; style, bringing Italian opera to its highest development, creating the genres of English oratorio and organ concerto, and introducing a new style into English church music. He is consistently recognized as one of the greatest composers of his age.

Handel started three commercial opera companies to supply the English nobility with Italian opera. In 1737, he had a physical breakdown, changed direction creatively, addressed the middle class and made a transition to English choral works. After his success with &quot;Messiah&quot; (1742), he never composed an Italian opera again. His orchestral &quot;Water Music&quot; and &quot;Music for the Royal Fireworks&quot; remain steadfastly popular. One of his four coronation anthems, &quot;Zadok the Priest&quot;, has been performed at every British coronation since 1727. He died a respected and rich man in 1759, aged 74, and was given a state funeral at Westminster Abbey. 

Interest in Handel&#x27;s music has grown since the mid-20th century. The musicologist Winton Dean wrote that &quot;Handel was not only a great composer; he was a dramatic genius of the first order.&quot; His music was admired by Classical-era composers, especially Mozart, Haydn and Beethoven.

== Early years ==
=== Family ===
Handel was born in 1685 (the same year as Johann Sebastian Bach and Domenico Scarlatti) in Halle, in the Duchy of Magdeburg, then part of Brandenburg-Prussia. His parents were Georg Händel, aged 63, and Dorothea Taust, daughter of priest Georg Taust. His father was an eminent barber-surgeon who served the court of Saxe-Weissenfels and the Margraviate of Brandenburg.

Halle was a relatively prosperous city, home of a salt-mining industry, a centre of trade, and a member of the Hanseatic League. The Margrave of Brandenburg became the administrator of the archepiscopal territories of Mainz, including Magdeburg when they converted, and by the early 17th century held his court in Halle, which attracted renowned musicians. Even the smaller churches all had &quot;able organists and fair choirs&quot;, and humanities and the letters thrived (Shakespeare was performed in the theatres early in the 17th century). The Thirty Years&#x27; War brought extensive destruction to Halle, and by the 1680s it was impoverished. However, since the middle of the war the city had been under the administration of the Duke of Saxony, and soon after the end of the war he would bring musicians trained in Dresden to his court in Weissenfels.
The arts and music, however, flourished only among the higher strata (not only in Halle but throughout Germany), of which Handel&#x27;s family was not a part. Georg Händel (senior) was born at the beginning of the war and was apprenticed to a barber in Halle at the age of 14 after his father died. When he was 20, he married the widow of the official barber-surgeon of a suburb of Halle, inheriting his practice. With this, Georg determinedly began the process of becoming self-made; by dint of his &quot;conservative, steady, thrifty, unadventurous&quot; lifestyle, he guided the five children he had with Anna who reached adulthood into the medical profession (except his youngest daughter, who married a government official). Anna died in 1682. Within a year Georg married again, this time to the daughter of a Lutheran minister, Pastor Georg Taust of the Church of St. Bartholomew in Giebichenstein, who himself came from a long line of Lutheran pastors. George Frideric was the second child of this marriage; the first son was stillborn. Two younger sisters arrived afterwards: Dorthea Sophia, born on 6 October 1687, and Johanna Christiana, born on 10 January 1690.

=== Early education ===

Early in his life, Handel is reported to have attended the &quot;Gymnasium&quot; in Halle, where the headmaster, , was reputed to be an ardent musician. Whether Handel remained there, and if he did for how long, is unknown, but many biographers suggest that he was withdrawn from school by his father, based on the characterization of him by Handel&#x27;s first biographer, John Mainwaring. Mainwaring is the source for almost all information (little as it is) of Handel&#x27;s childhood, and much of that information came from J. C. Smith Jr., Handel&#x27;s confidant and copyist. Whether it came from Smith or elsewhere, Mainwaring frequently relates misinformation. It is from Mainwaring that the portrait comes of Handel&#x27;s father as implacably opposed to any musical education. Mainwaring writes that Georg Händel was &quot;alarmed&quot; at Handel&#x27;s very early propensity for music, &quot;took every measure to oppose it&quot;, including forbidding any musical instrument in the house and preventing Handel from going to any house where they might be found. This did nothing to dampen young Handel&#x27;s inclination; in fact, it did the reverse. Mainwaring tells the story of Handel&#x27;s secret attic spinet: Handel &quot;found means to get a little clavichord privately convey&#x27;d to a room at the top of the house. To this room he constantly stole when the family was asleep&quot;. Although both John Hawkins and Charles Burney credited this tale, Schoelcher found it nearly &quot;incredible&quot; and a feat of &quot;poetic imagination&quot; and Lang considers it one of the unproven &quot;romantic stories&quot; that surrounded Handel&#x27;s childhood. But Handel had to have had some experience with the keyboard to have made the impression in Weissenfels that resulted in his receiving formal musical training.

=== Musical education ===
Sometime between the ages of seven and nine, Handel accompanied his father to Weissenfels, where he came under the notice of one whom Handel thereafter always regarded throughout life as his benefactor, Duke Johann Adolf I. Somehow Handel made his way to the court organ in the palace chapel of the Holy Trinity, where he surprised everyone with his playing. Overhearing this performance and noting the youth of the performer caused the Duke, whose suggestions were not to be disregarded, to recommend to Georg Händel that Handel be given musical instruction. Handel&#x27;s father engaged the organist at the Halle parish church, the young Friedrich Wilhelm Zachow, to instruct Handel. Zachow would be the only teacher that Handel ever had. Because of his church employment, Zachow was an organist &quot;of the old school&quot;, revelling in fugues, canons, and counterpoint. But he was also familiar with developments in music across Europe and his own compositions &quot;embraced the new concerted, dramatic style&quot;. 

When Zachow discovered the talent of Handel, he introduced him &quot;to a vast collection of German and Italian music, which he possessed, sacred and profane, vocal and instrumental compositions of different schools, different styles, and of every master&quot;. Many traits considered &quot;Handelian&quot; can be traced back to Zachow&#x27;s music. At the same time Handel continued practice on the harpsichord, and learned violin and organ, but according to Burney his special affection was for the &quot;hautbois&quot; (oboe). Schoelcher speculates that his youthful devotion to the instrument explains the large number of pieces he composed for the oboe.
With respect to instruction in composition, in addition to having Handel apply himself to traditional fugue and cantus firmus work, Zachow, recognising Handel&#x27;s precocious talents, systematically introduced Handel to the variety of styles and masterworks contained in his extensive library. He did this by requiring Handel to copy selected scores. &quot;I used to write like the devil in those days&quot;, Handel recalled much later. 

Much of this copying was entered into a notebook that Handel maintained for the rest of his life. Although it has since disappeared, the notebook has been sufficiently described to understand what pieces Zachow wished Handel to study. Among the chief composers represented in this exercise book were Johann Krieger, an &quot;old master&quot; in the fugue and prominent organ composer, Johann Caspar Kerll, a representative of the &quot;southern style&quot; after his teacher Girolamo Frescobaldi and imitated later by Handel, Johann Jakob Froberger, an &quot;internationalist&quot; also closely studied by Buxtehude and Bach, and Georg Muffat, whose amalgam of French and Italian styles and his synthesis of musical forms influenced Handel.

Mainwaring writes that during this time Zachow had begun to have Handel assume some of his church duties. Zachow, Mainwaring asserts, was &quot;often&quot; absent, &quot;from his love of company, and a cheerful glass&quot;, and Handel, therefore, performed on organ frequently. What is more, according to Mainwaring, Handel began composing, at the age of nine, church services for voice and instruments &quot;and from that time actually did compose a service every week for three years successively&quot;. Mainwaring ends this chapter of Handel&#x27;s life by concluding that three or four years had been enough to allow Handel to surpass Zachow, and Handel had become &quot;impatient for another situation&quot;; &quot;Berlin was the place agreed upon.&quot; Carelessness with dates or sequences (and possibly imaginative interpretation by Mainwaring) makes this period confused.

===After the death of Handel&#x27;s father ===

Handel&#x27;s father died on 11 February 1697. It was German custom for friends and family to compose funeral odes for a substantial burgher like Georg, and young Handel discharged his duty with a poem dated 18 February and signed with his name and (in deference to his father&#x27;s wishes) &quot;dedicated to the liberal arts.&quot; At the time Handel was studying either at Halle&#x27;s Lutheran Gymnasium or the Latin School.

Mainwaring has Handel travelling to Berlin the next year, 1698. The problem with Mainwaring as an authority for this date, however, is that he tells of how Handel&#x27;s father communicated with the &quot;king&quot; during Handel&#x27;s stay, declining the Court&#x27;s offer to send Handel to Italy on a stipend and that his father died &quot;after his return from Berlin.&quot; But since Georg Händel died in 1697, either the date of the trip or Mainwaring&#x27;s statements about Handel&#x27;s father must be in error. Early biographers solved the problem by making the year of the trip 1696, then noting that at the age of 11, Handel would need a guardian, so they have Handel&#x27;s father or a friend of the family accompany him, all the while puzzling over why the elder Handel, who wanted Handel to become a lawyer, would spend the sum to lead his son further into the temptation of music as a career. Schoelcher for example has Handel travelling to Berlin at 11, meeting both Bononcini and Attilio Ariosti in Berlin and then returning at the direction of his father. But Ariosti was not in Berlin before the death of Handel&#x27;s father, and Handel could not have met Bononcini in Berlin before 1702. Modern biographers either accept the year as 1698, since most reliable older authorities agree with it, and discount what Mainwaring says about what took place during the trip or assume that Mainwaring conflated two or more visits to Berlin, as he did with Handel&#x27;s later trips to Venice.

=== University ===

Perhaps to fulfil a promise to his father or simply because he saw himself as &quot;dedicated to the liberal arts&quot;, on 10 February 1702 Handel matriculated at the University of Halle. That university had only recently been founded. In 1694, the Elector of Brandenburg Frederick III (later Prussian King Frederick I) created the school, largely to provide a lecture forum for the jurist Christian Thomasius who had been expelled from Leipzig for his liberal views. Handel did not enrol in the faculty of law, although he almost certainly attended lectures. Thomasius was an intellectual and academic crusader, who was the first German academic to lecture in German and also denounced witch trials. Lang believes that Thomasius instilled in Handel a &quot;respect for the dignity and freedom of man&#x27;s mind and the solemn majesty of the law&quot;, principles that would have drawn him to and kept him in England for half a century. Handel also there encountered the theologian and professor of Oriental languages August Hermann Francke, who was particularly solicitous of children, especially orphans. The orphanage he founded became a model for Germany and undoubtedly influenced Handel&#x27;s own charitable impulse when he assigned the rights of &quot;Messiah&quot; to London&#x27;s Foundling Hospital.
Shortly after commencing his university education, Handel (though Lutheran) on 13 March 1702 accepted the position of organist at the Calvinist Cathedral in Halle, the Domkirche, replacing J. C. Leporin, for whom he had acted as assistant. The position, which was a one-year probationary appointment, showed the foundation he had received from Zachow, for a church organist and cantor was a highly prestigious office. From it, he received 5 thalers a year and lodgings in the run-down castle of Moritzburg.

Around this same time, Handel made the acquaintance of Telemann. Four years Handel&#x27;s senior, Telemann was studying law at Leipzig and was assisting cantor Johann Kuhnau (Bach&#x27;s predecessor at the Thomaskirche there). Telemann recalled forty years later in an autobiography for Mattheson&#x27;s &quot;Grundlage&quot;: &quot;The writing of the excellent Johann Kuhnau served as a model for me in fugue and counterpoint; but in fashioning melodic movements and examining them Handel and I were constantly occupied, frequently visiting each other as well as writing letters.&quot;

=== Halle compositions ===
Although Mainwaring records that Handel wrote weekly when assistant to Zachow and as probationary organist at Domkirche part of his duty was to provide suitable music, no sacred compositions from his Halle period can now be identified. Mattheson, however, summarised his opinion of Handel&#x27;s church cantatas written in Halle: &quot;Handel in those days set very, very long arias and sheerly unending cantatas which, while not possessing the proper knack or correct taste, were perfect so far as harmony is concerned.&quot;

Early chamber works do exist, but it is difficult to date any of them to Handel&#x27;s time in Halle. Many historians until recently followed Chrysander and designated the six trio sonatas for two oboes and basso continuo as his first known composition, supposedly written in 1696 (when Handel was 11). Lang doubts the dating based on a handwritten date of a copy (1700) and stylistic considerations. Lang writes that the works &quot;show thorough acquaintance with the distilled sonata style of the Corelli school&quot; and are notable for &quot;the formal security and the cleanness of the texture.&quot; Hogwood considers all of the oboe trio sonatas spurious and even suggests that some parts cannot be performed on the oboe. That authentic manuscript sources do not exist and that Handel never recycled any material from these works makes their authenticity doubtful. Other early chamber works were printed in Amsterdam in 1724 as opus 1, but it is impossible to tell which are early works in their original form, rather than later re-workings by Handel, a frequent practice of his.

== From Hamburg to Italy ==
Handel&#x27;s probationary appointment to Domkirche expired in March 1703. By July Handel was in Hamburg. Since he left no explanation for the move biographers have offered their own speculation.

Donald Burrows believes that the answer can be found by untangling Mainwaring&#x27;s confused chronology of the trip to Berlin. Burrows dates this trip to 1702 or 1703 (after his father&#x27;s death) and concludes that since Handel (through a &quot;friend and relation&quot; at the Berlin court) turned down Frederick&#x27;s offer to subsidise his musical education in Italy (with the implicit understanding that he would become a court musician on his return), Handel was no longer able to expect preferment (whether as a musician, lawyer or otherwise) within Brandenburg-Prussia. Since he was attracted to secular, dramatic music (by meeting the Italians Bononcini and Attilio Ariosti and through the influence of Telemann), Hamburg, a free city with an established opera company, was the logical choice. 

The question remains, however, why Handel rejected the King&#x27;s offer, given that Italy was the centre of opera. Lang suggests that influenced by the teachings of Thomasius, Handel&#x27;s character was such that he was unable to make himself subservient to anyone, even a king. Lang sees Handel as someone who could not accept class distinctions that required him to regard himself as a social inferior. &quot;What Handel craved was personal freedom to raise himself out of his provincial milieu to a life of culture.&quot; Burrows notes that, like his father, Handel was able to accept royal (and aristocratic) favours without considering himself a court servant; and so, given the embarrassed financial condition of his mother, Handel set off for Hamburg to obtain experience while supporting himself.

In 1703, he accepted a position as violinist and harpsichordist in the orchestra of the Hamburg Oper am Gänsemarkt. There he met the composers Johann Mattheson, Christoph Graupner and Reinhard Keiser. Handel&#x27;s first two operas, &quot;Almira&quot; and &quot;Nero&quot;, were produced in 1705. He produced two other operas, &quot;Daphne&quot; and &quot;Florindo&quot;, performed in 1708.

According to Mainwaring, in 1706 Handel travelled to Italy at the invitation of Ferdinando de&#x27; Medici. (Other sources say Handel was invited by Gian Gastone de&#x27; Medici, whom Handel had met in 1703–04 in Hamburg.) Ferdinando, who had a keen interest in opera, was trying to make Florence Italy&#x27;s musical capital by attracting the leading talents of his day. In Italy, Handel met librettist Antonio Salvi, with whom he later collaborated. Handel left for Rome and since opera was (temporarily) banned in the Papal States, composed sacred music for the Roman clergy. His famous &quot;Dixit Dominus&quot; (1707) is from this era. He also composed cantatas in pastoral style for musical gatherings in the palaces of duchess Aurora Sanseverino (whom Mainwaring called &quot;Donna Laura&quot;) one of the most influential patrons from the Kingdom of Naples, and cardinals Pietro Ottoboni, Benedetto Pamphili and Carlo Colonna. Two oratorios, &quot;La resurrezione&quot; and &quot;Il trionfo del tempo&quot;, were produced in a private setting for Ruspoli and Ottoboni in 1709 and 1710, respectively. &quot;Rodrigo&quot;, his first all-Italian opera, was produced in the Cocomero theatre in Florence in 1707. &quot;Agrippina&quot; was first produced in 1709 at Teatro San Giovanni Grisostomo in Venice, owned by the Grimanis. The opera, with a libretto by Cardinal Vincenzo Grimani, ran for 27 nights successively. The audience, thunderstruck with the grandeur and sublimity of his style, applauded for &quot;Il caro Sassone&quot; (&quot;the dear Saxon&quot; – referring to Handel&#x27;s German origins).

==In London==

===Arrival===

In June 1710, Handel became &quot;Kapellmeister&quot; to German prince George, the Elector of Hanover, but left at the end of the year. It is likely he was also invited by Charles Montagu the former ambassador in Venice to visit England. He visited Anna Maria Luisa de&#x27; Medici and her husband in Düsseldorf on his way to London. With his opera &quot;Rinaldo&quot;, based on &quot;La Gerusalemme Liberata&quot; by the Italian poet Torquato Tasso, Handel enjoyed great success, although it was composed quickly, with many borrowings from his older Italian works. This work contains one of Handel&#x27;s favourite arias, &quot;Cara sposa, amante cara&quot;, and the famous Lascia ch&#x27;io pianga.

Handel went back to Halle twice, to attend the wedding of his sister and the baptism of her daughter, but decided to settle permanently in England in 1712. In the summer of 1713, he lived at Mr. Mathew Andrews&#x27; estate in Barn Elms, Surrey. He received a yearly income of £200 from Queen Anne after composing for her the &quot;Utrecht Te Deum and Jubilate&quot;, first performed in 1713.

One of his most important patrons was the 3rd Earl of Burlington and 4th Earl of Cork, a young and extremely wealthy member of an Anglo-Irish aristocratic family. While living in the mansion of Lord Burlington, Handel wrote &quot;Amadigi di Gaula&quot;, a &quot;magic&quot; opera, about a damsel in distress, based on the tragedy by Antoine Houdar de la Motte.

The conception of an opera as a coherent structure was slow to capture Handel&#x27;s imagination and he composed no operas for five years. In July 1717, Handel&#x27;s &quot;Water Music&quot; was performed more than three times on the River Thames for King George I and his guests. It is said the compositions spurred reconciliation between Handel and the king, supposedly annoyed by the composer&#x27;s abandonment of his Hanover post.

=== At Cannons (1717–19) ===

In 1717, Handel became house composer at Cannons in Middlesex, where he laid the cornerstone for his future choral compositions in the &quot;Chandos Anthems&quot;. Romain Rolland wrote that these anthems (or Psalms) stood in relation to Handel&#x27;s oratorios, much the same way that the Italian cantatas stood to his operas: &quot;splendid sketches of the more monumental works.&quot; Another work, which he wrote for The 1st Duke of Chandos, the owner of Cannons, was &quot;Acis and Galatea&quot;: during Handel&#x27;s lifetime, it was his most performed work. Winton Dean wrote that &quot;the music catches breath and disturbs the memory&quot;.

In 1719, the Duke of Chandos became one of the composer&#x27;s important patrons and a primary subscriber to his new opera company, the Royal Academy of Music, though his patronage declined after Chandos lost large sums of money in the South Sea Bubble, which burst in 1720 in one of history&#x27;s greatest financial cataclysms. Handel himself invested in the South Sea Company in 1716 when its share prices were low and sold them before the &quot;bubble&quot; burst in 1720. In 1720, Handel invested in the slave-trading Royal African Company (RAC), following in the steps of his patron (the Duke of Chandos was one of the leading investors in the RAC). As noted by music historian David Hunter, 32 per cent of the subscribers and investors in the Royal Academy of Music, or their close family members, held investments in the RAC as well.

=== Royal Academy of Music (1719–34) ===
In May 1719, The 1st Duke of Newcastle, the Lord Chamberlain, ordered Handel to look for new singers. Handel travelled to Dresden to attend the newly built opera. He saw &quot;Teofane&quot; by Antonio Lotti, and engaged members of the cast for the Royal Academy of Music, founded by a group of aristocrats to assure themselves a constant supply of baroque opera or opera seria. Handel may have invited John Smith, his fellow student in Halle, and his son Johann Christoph Schmidt, to become his secretary and amanuensis. By 1723 he had moved into a Georgian house at 25 Brook Street, which he rented for the rest of his life. This house, where he rehearsed, copied music, and sold tickets, is now the Handel House Museum. During twelve months between 1724 and 1725, Handel wrote three successful operas, &quot;Giulio Cesare&quot;, &quot;Tamerlano&quot; and &quot;Rodelinda&quot;. Handel&#x27;s operas are filled with da capo arias, such as &quot;Svegliatevi nel core&quot;. After composing &quot;Silete venti&quot;, he concentrated on opera and stopped writing cantatas. &quot;Scipio&quot;, from which the regimental slow march of the British Grenadier Guards is derived, was performed as a stopgap, waiting for the arrival of Faustina Bordoni.

In 1727, Handel was commissioned to write four anthems for the Coronation ceremony of King George II. One of these, &quot;Zadok the Priest&quot;, has been played at every British coronation ceremony since. The words to &quot;Zadok the Priest&quot; are taken from the King James Bible. In 1728, John Gay&#x27;s &quot;The Beggar&#x27;s Opera&quot;, which made fun of the type of Italian opera Handel had popularised in London, premiered at Lincoln&#x27;s Inn Fields Theatre and ran for 62 consecutive performances, the longest run in theatre history up to that time. After nine years the Royal Academy of Music ceased to function but Handel soon started a new company.

The Queen&#x27;s Theatre at the Haymarket (now His Majesty&#x27;s Theatre), established in 1705 by architect and playwright John Vanbrugh, quickly became an opera house. Between 1711 and 1739, more than 25 of Handel&#x27;s operas premièred there. In 1729, Handel became joint manager of the theatre with John James Heidegger.

Handel travelled to Italy to engage new singers and also composed seven more operas, among them the comic masterpiece &quot;Partenope&quot; and the &quot;magic&quot; opera &quot;Orlando&quot;. After two commercially successful English oratorios &quot;Esther&quot; and &quot;Deborah&quot;, he was able to invest again in the South Sea Company. Handel reworked his &quot;Acis and Galatea&quot; which then became his most successful work ever. Handel failed to compete with the Opera of the Nobility, who engaged musicians such as Johann Adolph Hasse, Nicolo Porpora and the famous castrato Farinelli. The strong support by Frederick, Prince of Wales caused conflicts in the royal family. In March 1734 Handel composed a wedding anthem &quot;This is the day which the Lord hath made&quot;, and a serenata &quot;Parnasso in Festa&quot; for Anne, Princess Royal.

Despite the problems the Opera of the Nobility was causing him at the time, Handel&#x27;s neighbour in Brook Street, Mary Delany, reported on a party she invited Handel to at her house on 12 April 1734 where he was in good spirits:I had Lady Rich and her daughter, Lady Cath. Hanmer and her husband, Mr. and Mrs. Percival, Sir John Stanley and my brother, Mrs. Donellan, Strada [star soprano of Handel&#x27;s operas] and Mr. Coot. Lord Shaftesbury begged of Mr. Percival to bring him, and being a profess&#x27;d friend of Mr. Handel (who was here also) was admitted; I never was so well entertained at an opera! Mr. Handel was in the best humour in the world, and played lessons and accompanied Strada and all the ladies that sang from seven o&#x27;clock till eleven. I gave them tea and coffee, and about half an hour after nine had a salver brought in of chocolate, mulled white wine, and biscuits. Everybody was easy and seemed pleased.

=== Opera at Covent Garden (1734–41) ===

In 1733, the Earl of Essex received a letter with the following sentence: &quot;Handel became so arbitrary a prince, that the Town murmurs.&quot; The board of chief investors expected Handel to retire when his contract ended, but Handel immediately looked for another theatre. In cooperation with John Rich, he started his third company at Covent Garden Theatre. Rich was renowned for his spectacular productions. He suggested Handel use his small chorus and introduce the dancing of Marie Sallé, for whom Handel composed &quot;Terpsicore&quot;. In 1735, he introduced organ concertos between the acts. For the first time, Handel allowed Gioacchino Conti, who had no time to learn his part, to substitute arias. Financially, &quot;Ariodante&quot; was a failure, although he introduced ballet suites at the end of each act. &quot;Alcina&quot;, his last opera with a magic content, and &quot;Alexander&#x27;s Feast or the Power of Music&quot; based on John Dryden&#x27;s &quot;Alexander&#x27;s Feast&quot; starred Anna Maria Strada del Pò and John Beard.

Early 1737 he produced &quot;Arminio&quot; and &quot;Giustino&quot;, completed &quot;Berenice&quot;, revived &quot;Partenope&quot;, and continued with &quot;Il Parnasso in Festa&quot;, &quot;Alexander&#x27;s Feast&quot;, and the revised &quot;The Triumph of Time and Truth&quot; which premiered on 23 March. In April Handel suffered a mild stroke, or &quot;rheumatic palsy&quot;, resulting in temporary paralysis in his right hand and arm. After brief signs of a recovery, he had a relapse in May, with an accompanying deterioration in his mental capacities. He had strong competition from John Frederick Lampe; &quot;The Dragon of Wantley&quot; was first performed at the Little Theatre in the Haymarket in London on 16 May 1737. It was a parody of the Italian opera seria.

In Autumn 1737 the fatigued Handel reluctantly followed the advice of his physicians and went to take the cure in the spa towns of Royal Tunbridge Wells, Aix-la-Chapelle (Burtscheid) in September. All the symptoms of his &quot;disorder&quot; vanished by November. On Christmas Eve Handel finished the score of Faramondo, but its composition was interrupted by that of the Funeral Anthem for Queen Caroline. On Boxing Day he began the composition of &quot;Serse&quot;, the only comic opera that Handel ever wrote and worked with Elisabeth Duparc.

A harp and organ concerto (HWV 294) and &quot;Alexander&#x27;s Feast&quot; were published in 1738 by John Walsh. He composed music for a musical clock with a pipe organ built by Charles Clay; it was bought by Gerrit Braamcamp and was in 2016 acquired by the Museum Speelklok in Utrecht. &quot;Deidamia&quot;, his last opera, a co-production with the Earl of Holderness, was performed three times in 1741. Handel gave up the opera business, while he enjoyed more success with his English oratorios.

=== Oratorio ===


&quot;Il trionfo del tempo e del disinganno&quot;, an allegory, Handel&#x27;s first oratorio was composed in Italy in 1707, followed by &quot;La resurrezione&quot; in 1708 which uses material from the Bible. The circumstances of &quot;Esther&quot; and its first performance, possibly in 1718, are obscure. Another 12 years had passed when an act of piracy caused him to take up &quot;Esther&quot; once again. Three earlier performances aroused such interest that they naturally prompted the idea of introducing it to a larger public. Next came &quot;Deborah&quot;, strongly coloured by the coronation anthems and &quot;Athaliah&quot;, his third English Oratorio. In these three oratorios Handel laid the foundation for the traditional use of the chorus which marks his later oratorios. Handel became sure of himself, broader in his presentation, and more diverse in his composition.

It is evident how much he learned from Arcangelo Corelli about writing for instruments, and from Alessandro Scarlatti about writing for the solo voice, but there is no single composer who taught him how to write for the chorus. Handel tended more and more to replace Italian soloists with English ones. The most significant reason for this change was the dwindling financial returns from his operas. Thus a tradition was created for oratorios which was to govern their future performance. The performances were given without costumes and action; the singers appeared in their own clothes.

In 1736, Handel produced &quot;Alexander&#x27;s Feast&quot;. John Beard appeared for the first time as one of Handel&#x27;s principal singers and became Handel&#x27;s permanent tenor soloist for the rest of Handel&#x27;s life. The piece was a great success and it encouraged Handel to make the transition from writing Italian operas to English choral works. In &quot;Saul&quot;, Handel was collaborating with Charles Jennens and experimenting with three trombones, a carillon and extra-large military kettledrums (from the Tower of London), to be sure &quot;...it will be most excessive noisy&quot;. &quot;Saul&quot; and &quot;Israel in Egypt&quot;, both from 1739, head the list of great, mature oratorios, in which the da capo aria became the exception and not the rule. &quot;Israel in Egypt&quot; consists of little else but choruses, borrowing from the &quot;Funeral Anthem for Queen Caroline&quot;. In his next works, Handel changed his course. In these works he laid greater stress on the effects of orchestra and soloists; the chorus retired into the background. &quot;L&#x27;Allegro, il Penseroso ed il Moderato&quot; has a rather diverting character; the work is light and fresh.
During the summer of 1741, the 3rd Duke of Devonshire invited Handel to Dublin, capital of the Kingdom of Ireland, to give concerts for the benefit of local hospitals. Composed in London between 22 August and 14 September 1741, Handel&#x27;s &quot;Messiah&quot; was first performed at the New Music Hall in Fishamble Street, Dublin on 13 April 1742, with 26 boys and five men from the combined choirs of St Patrick&#x27;s and Christ Church cathedrals participating. Handel secured a balance between soloists and chorus which he never surpassed. In 1746 and 1747, Handel wrote a series of military oratorios - &quot;Judas Maccabaeus (Handel)&quot;, &quot;Joshua&quot; and &quot;Alexander Balus&quot; - which celebrate the British monarchy&#x27;s victories over the Jacobites. In 1747, Handel wrote his oratorio &quot;Alexander Balus&quot;. This work was produced at Covent Garden Theatre in London, on 23 March 1748, and to the aria &quot;Hark! hark! He strikes the golden lyre&quot;, Handel wrote the accompaniment for mandolin, harp, violin, viola, and violoncello. Another of his English oratorios, &quot;Solomon&quot;, was first performed on 17 March 1749 at the Covent Garden Theatre. The text for &quot;Solomon&quot; is thought to have been penned by the English Jewish poet and playwright Moses Mendes, based on the biblical stories of the wise king Solomon. &quot;Solomon&quot; contains a short and lively instrumental passage for two oboes and strings in act 3, known as &quot;The Arrival of the Queen of Sheba&quot;.

The use of English soloists reached its height at the first performance of &quot;Samson&quot;. The work is highly theatrical. The role of the chorus became increasingly important in his later oratorios. &quot;Jephtha&quot; was first performed on 26 February 1752; even though it was his last oratorio, it was no less a masterpiece than his earlier works.

== Later years ==

In 1749, Handel composed &quot;Music for the Royal Fireworks&quot;; 12,000 people attended the first performance. In 1750, he arranged a performance of &quot;Messiah&quot; to benefit the Foundling Hospital, a children&#x27;s home in London. The performance was considered a great success and was followed by annual concerts that continued throughout his life. In recognition of his patronage, Handel was made a governor of the Hospital the day after his initial concert. He bequeathed a copy of &quot;Messiah&quot; to the institution upon his death. His involvement with the Foundling Hospital is today commemorated with a permanent exhibition in London&#x27;s Foundling Museum, which also holds the &quot;Gerald Coke Handel Collection&quot;. In addition to the Foundling Hospital, Handel also gave to a charity that assisted impoverished musicians and their families.

In August 1750, on a journey back from Germany to London, Handel was seriously injured in a carriage accident between The Hague and Haarlem in the Netherlands. In 1751, one eye started to fail. The cause was a cataract which was operated on by the great charlatan Chevalier Taylor. This did not improve his eyesight and possibly made it worse. He was completely blind by 1752. He died in 1759 at home in Brook Street, at the age of 74. The last performance he attended was of &quot;Messiah&quot;. Handel was buried in Westminster Abbey. More than three thousand mourners attended his funeral, which was given full state honours.

Handel never married and kept his personal life private. His initial will bequeathed the bulk of his estate to his niece Johanna, but four codicils distributed much of his estate to other relations, servants, friends and charities.

Handel owned an art collection that was auctioned posthumously in 1760. The auction catalogue listed approximately seventy paintings and ten prints, his other paintings having been bequeathed.

== Works ==

===Overview===
Handel&#x27;s compositions include 42 operas, 24 oratorios, more than 120 cantatas, trios and duets, numerous arias, odes and serenatas, solo and trio sonatas, 18 concerti grossi, and 12 organ concertos. His most famous work, the oratorio &quot;Messiah&quot; with its &quot;Hallelujah&quot; chorus, is among the most popular works in choral music. The Lobkowicz Palace in Prague holds Mozart&#x27;s copy of &quot;Messiah&quot;, complete with handwritten annotations. Among the works with opus numbers published and popularised in his lifetime are the Organ concertos Op. 4 and Op. 7, together with the Opus 3 and Opus 6 Concerti grossi; the latter incorporates an earlier organ concerto, &quot;The Cuckoo and the Nightingale&quot;, in which birdsong is imitated in the upper registers of the organ. Also notable are his 16 keyboard suites, especially &quot;The Harmonious Blacksmith&quot;.
=== Catalogues ===

The first published catalogue of Handel&#x27;s works appeared as an appendix to Mainwaring&#x27;s &quot;Memoirs&quot;. Between 1787 and 1797 Samuel Arnold compiled a 180-volume collection of Handel&#x27;s works—however, it was far from complete. Also incomplete was the collection produced between 1843 and 1858 by the English Handel Society (founded by Sir George Macfarren).

The 105-volume &quot;Händel-Gesellschaft&quot; (&quot;Handel Society&quot;) edition was published between 1858 and 1902 – mainly due to the efforts of Friedrich Chrysander. For modern performance, the realisation of the basso continuo reflects 19th-century practice. Vocal scores drawn from the edition were published by Novello in London, but some scores, such as the vocal score to &quot;Samson&quot;, are incomplete.

The continuing &quot;Hallische Händel-Ausgabe&quot; edition was first inaugurated in 1955 in the Halle region in Saxony-Anhalt, East Germany. It did not start as a critical edition, but after heavy criticism of the first volumes, which were performing editions without a critical apparatus (for example, the opera &quot;Serse&quot; was published with the title character recast as a tenor, reflecting pre-war German practice), it repositioned itself as a critical edition. Influenced in part by cold-war realities, editorial work was inconsistent: misprints were found in abundance and editors failed to consult important sources. In 1985, a committee was formed to establish better standards for the edition. The reunification of Germany in 1990 removed communication problems, and the volumes issued have since shown a significant improvement in standards.

Between 1978 and 1986 the German academic Bernd Baselt catalogued Handel&#x27;s works in his &quot;Händel-Werke-Verzeichnis&quot; publication. The catalogue has achieved wide acceptance and is used as the modern numbering system, with each of Handel&#x27;s works designated an &quot;HWV&quot; number – for example, &quot;Messiah&quot; is catalogued as &quot;HWV 56&quot;.

== Legacy ==

Handel&#x27;s works were collected and preserved by two men: Sir Samuel Hellier, a country squire whose musical acquisitions form the nucleus of the Shaw–Hellier Collection, and the abolitionist Granville Sharp. The catalogue accompanying the National Portrait Gallery exhibition marking the tercentenary of the composer&#x27;s birth calls them two men of the late eighteenth century &quot;who have left us solid evidence of the means by which they indulged their enthusiasm&quot;. With his English oratorios, such as &quot;Messiah&quot; and &quot;Solomon&quot;, the coronation anthems, and other works including &quot;Water Music&quot; and &quot;Music for the Royal Fireworks&quot;, Handel became a national icon in Britain, and featured in the BBC series &quot;The Birth of British Music: Handel – The Conquering Hero&quot;.

After his death, Handel&#x27;s Italian operas fell into obscurity, except for selections such as the aria from &quot;Serse&quot;, &quot;Ombra mai fu&quot;. The oratorios continued to be performed but not long after Handel&#x27;s death they were thought to need some modernisation, and Mozart orchestrated German versions of &quot;Messiah&quot; and other works. Throughout the 19th century and first half of the 20th century, particularly in the Anglophone countries, his reputation rested primarily on his English oratorios, which were customarily performed by choruses of amateur singers on solemn occasions. The centenary of his death, in 1859, was celebrated by a performance of &quot;Messiah&quot; at The Crystal Palace, involving 2,765 singers and 460 instrumentalists, who played for an audience of about 10,000 people.

Recent decades have revived his secular cantatas and what one might call &#x27;secular oratorios&#x27; or &#x27;concert operas&#x27;. Of the former, &quot;Ode for St. Cecilia&#x27;s Day&quot; (1739) (set to texts by John Dryden) and &quot;Ode for the Birthday of Queen Anne&quot; (1713) are noteworthy. For his secular oratorios, Handel turned to classical mythology for subjects, producing such works as &quot;Acis and Galatea&quot; (1719), &quot;Hercules&quot; (1745) and &quot;Semele&quot; (1744). These works have a close kinship with the sacred oratorios, particularly in the vocal writing for the English-language texts. They also share the lyrical and dramatic qualities of Handel&#x27;s Italian operas. As such, they are sometimes fully staged as operas. With the rediscovery of his theatrical works, Handel, in addition to his renown as an instrumentalist, orchestral writer, and melodist, is now perceived as being one of opera&#x27;s great musical dramatists.

=== Reception ===

Handel has generally been accorded high esteem by fellow composers, both in his own time and since. Johann Sebastian Bach attempted, unsuccessfully, to meet Handel while he was visiting Halle. (Handel was born in the same year as Bach and Domenico Scarlatti.) Mozart is reputed to have said of him, &quot;Handel understands affect better than any of us. When he chooses, he strikes like a thunderbolt.&quot; To Beethoven he was &quot;the master of us all... the greatest composer that ever lived. I would uncover my head and kneel before his tomb.&quot; Beethoven emphasised above all the simplicity and popular appeal of Handel&#x27;s music when he said, &quot;Go to him to learn how to achieve great effects, by such simple means&quot;.

=== Borrowings ===
Since 1831, when William Crotch raised the issue in his &quot;Substance of Several Lectures on Music&quot;, scholars have extensively studied Handel&#x27;s &quot;borrowing&quot; of music from other composers. Summarising the field in 2005, Richard Taruskin wrote that Handel &quot;seems to have been the champion of all parodists, adapting both his own works and those of other composers in unparalleled numbers and with unparalleled exactitude.&quot; Among the composers whose music Handel apparently reused are Alessandro Stradella, Gottlieb Muffat, Alessandro Scarlatti, Domenico Scarlatti Giacomo Carissimi, Georg Philipp Telemann, Carl Heinrich Graun, Leonardo Vinci, Jacobus Gallus, Francesco Antonio Urio, Reinhard Keiser, Francesco Gasparini, Giovanni Bononcini, William Boyce, Henry Lawes, Michael Wise, Agostino Steffani, Franz Johann Habermann, and numerous others.

In an essay published in 1985, John H. Roberts demonstrated that Handel&#x27;s borrowings were unusually frequent even for his own era, enough to have been criticised by contemporaries (notably Johann Mattheson); Roberts suggested several reasons for Handel&#x27;s practice, including Handel&#x27;s attempts to make certain works sound more up-to-date and, more radically, his &quot;basic lack of facility in inventing original ideas&quot; – though Roberts took care to argue that this does not &quot;diminish Handel&#x27;s stature&quot;, which should be &quot;judged not by his methods, still less by his motives in employing them, but solely by the effects he achieves.&quot;

=== Homages ===
After Handel&#x27;s death, many composers wrote works based on or inspired by his music. The first movement from Louis Spohr&#x27;s Symphony No. 6, Op. 116, &quot;The Age of Bach and Handel&quot;, resembles two melodies from Handel&#x27;s &quot;Messiah&quot;. In 1797, Ludwig van Beethoven published the &quot;12 Variations in G major on &quot;See the conqu’ring hero comes&quot; from Judas Maccabaeus by Handel&quot;, for cello and piano. In 1822, Beethoven composed the overture &quot;The Consecration of the House&quot;, which also bears the influence of Handel. Guitar virtuoso Mauro Giuliani composed his &quot;Variations on a Theme by Handel&quot;, Op. 107 for guitar, based on Handel&#x27;s Suite No. 5 in E major, HWV 430, for harpsichord.

In 1861, using a theme from the second of Handel&#x27;s harpsichord suites, Johannes Brahms wrote the &quot;Variations and Fugue on a Theme by Handel&quot;, Op. 24, one of his most successful works (praised by Richard Wagner). Several works by the French composer Félix-Alexandre Guilmant use Handel&#x27;s themes; for example, his &quot;March on a Theme by Handel&quot; uses a theme from &quot;Messiah&quot;. French composer and flautist Philippe Gaubert wrote his &quot;Petite marche&quot; for flute and piano based on the fourth movement of Handel&#x27;s Trio Sonata, Op. 5, No. 2, HWV 397. Argentine composer Luis Gianneo composed his &quot;Variations on a Theme by Handel&quot; for piano. In 1911, Australian-born composer and pianist Percy Grainger based one of his most famous works on the final movement of Handel&#x27;s Suite No. 5 in E major (just like Giuliani). He first wrote some variations on the theme, which he titled &quot;Variations on Handel&#x27;s &#x27;The Harmonious Blacksmith&#x27; &quot;. Then he used the first sixteen bars of his set of variations to create &quot;Handel in the Strand&quot;, one of his most beloved pieces, of which he made several versions (for example, the piano solo version from 1930). Arnold Schoenberg&#x27;s Concerto for String Quartet and Orchestra in B-flat major (1933) was composed after Handel&#x27;s Concerto Grosso, Op. 6/7.

=== Veneration ===
In the Lutheran Calendar of Saints Handel and Bach share the date 28 July with Heinrich Schütz, and Handel and Bach are commemorated in the calendar of saints prepared by the Order of Saint Luke for the use of the United Methodist Church. The Book of Common Worship of the Presbyterian Church (USA) (Westminster John Knox Press, 2018) commemorates him on 20 April.

=== Fictional depictions ===
In 1942, Handel was the subject of the British biographical film &quot;The Great Mr. Handel&quot; directed by Norman Walker and starring Wilfrid Lawson. It was made at Denham Studios by the Rank Organisation, and shot in Technicolor. He is also the central character in the television films &quot;God Rot Tunbridge Wells!&quot; (1985) and &quot;Handel&#x27;s Last Chance&quot; (1996) and the stage play &quot;All the Angels&quot; (2015). Handel was portrayed by Jeroen Krabbé as the antagonist in the film &quot;Farinelli&quot; (1994).

<doc id="12776" wikidata="Q179277" url="?curid=12776" title="Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina">
<text>Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina (between 3 February 1525 and 2 February 1526 – 2 February 1594) was an Italian composer of late Renaissance music. The central representative of the Roman School, with Orlande de Lassus and Tomás Luis de Victoria, Palestrina is considered the leading composer of late 16th-century Europe.

Born in the town of Palestrina in the Papal States, Palestrina moved to Rome as a child and underwent musical studies there. In 1551, Pope Julius III appointed him &quot;maestro di cappella&quot; of the Cappella Giulia at St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica. He left the post four years later, unable to continue as a layman under the papacy of Paul IV, and held similar positions at St. John Lateran and Santa Maria Maggiore in the following decade. Palestrina returned to the Cappella Giulia in 1571 and remained at St Peter&#x27;s until his death in 1594.

Primarily known for his masses and motets, which number over 105 and 250 respectively, Palestrina had a long-lasting influence on the development of church and secular music in Europe, especially on the development of counterpoint. According to &quot;Grove Music Online&quot;, Palestrina&#x27;s &quot;success in reconciling the functional and aesthetic aims of Catholic church music in the post-Tridentine period earned him an enduring reputation as the ideal Catholic composer, as well as giving his style (or, more precisely, later generations&#x27; selective view of it) an iconic stature as a model of perfect achievement.&quot;

==Biography==
Palestrina was born in the town of Palestrina, near Rome, then part of the Papal States, to Neapolitan parents, Santo and Palma Pierluigi, in 1525, possibly on 3 February. His mother died on 16 January 1536, when Palestrina was 10. Documents suggest that he first visited Rome in 1537, when he was listed as a chorister at the Basilica of Santa Maria Maggiore, one of the papal basilicas of the Diocese of Rome, which allowed him to learn literature and music. In 1540, he moved to Rome, where he studied in the school of the Huguenot Claude Goudimel. He also studied with Robin Mallapert and Firmin Lebel. He spent most of his career in the city.

Palestrina came of age as a musician under the influence of the northern European style of polyphony, which owed its dominance in Italy primarily to two influential Netherlandish composers, Guillaume Du Fay and Josquin des Prez, who had spent significant portions of their careers there. Italy itself had yet to produce anyone of comparable fame or skill in polyphony. Orlando di Lasso, who accompanied Palestrina in his early years, also played an important role in the formation of his style as an adviser.

From 1544 to 1551, Palestrina was the organist of the Cathedral of St. Agapito, the principal church of his native city. In 1551 Pope Julius III (previously the Bishop of Palestrina) appointed Palestrina &quot;maestro di cappella&quot; or musical director of the Cappella Giulia, (Julian Chapel, in the sense of choir), the choir of the chapter of canons at St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica. Palestrina dedicated to Julius III his first published compositions (1554), a book of Masses. It was the first book of Masses by a native composer, since in the Italian states of Palestrina&#x27;s day, most composers of sacred music were from the Low Countries, France, or Spain. In fact the book was modelled on one by Cristóbal de Morales: the woodcut in the front is almost an exact copy of the one from the book by the Spanish composer.

In 1555, Pope Paul IV ordered that all papal choristers should be clerical. As Palestrina married early in life and had four children, he was unable to continue in the chapel as a layman.
During the next decade, Palestrina held positions similar to his Julian Chapel appointment at other chapels and churches in Rome, notably St. John Lateran (1555–1560, a post previously held by Lassus), and Santa Maria Maggiore (1561–1566). In 1571 he returned to the Julian Chapel and remained at St Peter&#x27;s for the rest of his life. The decade of the 1570s was difficult for him personally: he lost his brother, two of his sons, and his wife, Lucrezia Gori, in three separate outbreaks of the plague (1572, 1575, and 1580, respectively). He seems to have considered becoming a priest at this time, but instead he remarried, this time to a wealthy widow, Virginia Dormoli. This finally gave him financial independence (he was not paid well as choirmaster) and was able to compose prolifically until his death.

He died in Rome of pleurisy on 2 February 1594. As was usual, Palestrina was buried on the same day he died, in a plain coffin with a lead plate on which was inscribed &quot;Ioannes Petrus Aloysius Praenestinus Musicae Princeps&quot;. A five-part &quot;Libera me Domine&quot; psalm for three choirs was sung at the funeral. Palestrina&#x27;s funeral was held at St. Peter&#x27;s, and he was buried beneath the floor of the basilica. His tomb was later covered by new construction and attempts to locate his grave have been unsuccessful.

Italian composers Giovanni Maria Nanino and Gregorio Allegri, both of them disciples of his school, continued his works.

==Music==
===Overview===

Palestrina left hundreds of compositions, including 105 masses, 68 offertories, at least 140 madrigals and more than 300 motets. In addition, there are at least 72 hymns, 35 magnificats, 11 litanies, and four or five sets of lamentations. The &quot;Gloria&quot; melody from Palestrina&#x27;s &quot;Magnificat Tertii Toni&quot; (1591) is widely used today in the resurrection hymn tune, &quot;Victory&quot; (The Strife Is O&#x27;er).

His attitude toward madrigals was somewhat enigmatic: whereas in the preface to his collection of &quot;Canticum canticorum&quot; (Song of Songs) motets (1584) he renounced the setting of profane texts, only two years later he was back in print with Book II of his secular madrigals (some of these being among the finest compositions in the medium). He published just two collections of madrigals with profane texts, one in 1555 and another in 1586. The other two collections were spiritual madrigals, a genre beloved by the proponents of the Counter-Reformation.

Palestrina&#x27;s masses show how his compositional style developed over time. His &quot;Missa sine nomine&quot; seems to have been particularly attractive to Johann Sebastian Bach, who studied and performed it while writing the Mass in B minor. Most of Palestrina&#x27;s masses appeared in thirteen volumes printed between 1554 and 1601, the last seven published after his death.

One of his most important works, the &quot;Missa Papae Marcelli&quot; (Pope Marcellus Mass) has been historically associated with erroneous information involving the Council of Trent. According to this tale (which forms the basis of Hans Pfitzner&#x27;s opera &quot;Palestrina&quot;), it was composed in order to persuade the Council of Trent that a draconian ban on the polyphonic treatment of text in sacred music (as opposed, that is, to a more directly intelligible homophonic treatment) was unnecessary. However, more recent scholarship shows that this mass was in fact composed before the cardinals convened to discuss the ban (possibly as much as 10 years before). Historical data indicates that the Council of Trent, as an official body, never actually banned any church music and failed to make any ruling or official statement on the subject. These stories originated from the unofficial points-of-view of some Council attendees who discussed their ideas with those not privy to the council&#x27;s deliberations. Those opinions and rumors have, over centuries, been transmuted into fictional accounts, put into print, and often incorrectly taught as historical fact. While Palestrina&#x27;s compositional motivations are not known, he may have been quite conscious of the need for intelligible text; however, this was not to conform with any doctrine of the Counter-Reformation, because no such doctrine exists. His characteristic style remained consistent from the 1560s until the end of his life. Roche&#x27;s hypothesis that Palestrina&#x27;s seemingly dispassionate approach to expressive or emotive texts could have resulted from his having to produce many to order, or from a deliberate decision that any intensity of expression was unbecoming in church music, reflects modern expectations about expressive freedom and underestimates the extent to which the mood of Palestrina&#x27;s settings is adapted to the liturgical occasions for which the texts were set, rather than the line-by-line meaning of the text, and depends on the distinctive characters of the church modes and variations in vocal grouping for expressive effect. Performing editions and recordings of Palestrina have tended to favour his works in the more familiar modes and standard (SATB) voicings, under-representing the expressive variety of his settings.

There are two comprehensive editions of Palestrina&#x27;s works: a 33-volume edition published by Breitkopf and Härtel, in Leipzig Germany between 1862 and 1894 edited by Franz Xaver Haberl, and a 34-volume edition published in the mid twentieth century, by Fratelli Scalera, in Rome, Italy edited by and others.

===The &quot;Palestrina Style&quot;===

One of the hallmarks of Palestrina&#x27;s music is that dissonances are typically relegated to the &quot;weak&quot; beats in a measure. This produced a smoother and more consonant type of polyphony which is now considered to be definitive of late Renaissance music, given Palestrina&#x27;s position as Europe&#x27;s leading composer in the wake of Josquin des Prez (d. 1521).

The &quot;Palestrina style&quot; taught in college courses covering Renaissance counterpoint is often based on the codification by the 18th-century composer and theorist Johann Joseph Fux, published as &quot;Gradus ad Parnassum&quot; (Steps to Parnassus, 1725). Citing Palestrina as his model, Fux divided counterpoint into five &quot;species&quot; (hence the term &quot;species counterpoint&quot;), designed as exercises for the student, which deployed progressively more elaborate rhythmic combinations of voices while adhering to strict harmonic and melodic requirements. The method was widely adopted and was the main basis of contrapuntal training in the 19th century, but Fux had introduced a number of simplifications to the Palestrina style, notably the obligatory use of a &quot;cantus firmus&quot; in semibreves, which were corrected by later authors such as Knud Jeppesen and R. O. Morris. Palestrina&#x27;s music conforms in many ways to Fux&#x27;s rules, particularly in the fifth species but does not fit his pedagogical format.

The main insight, that the &quot;pure&quot; style of polyphony achieved by Palestrina followed an invariable set of stylistic and combinational requirements, was justified. Fux&#x27;s manual was endorsed by his contemporary J.S. Bach, who himself arranged two of Palestrina&#x27;s masses for performance.

According to Fux, Palestrina had established and followed these basic guidelines:

* The flow of music is dynamic, not rigid or static.
* Melody should contain few leaps between notes. (Jeppesen: &quot;The line is the starting point of Palestrina&#x27;s style&quot;.)
* If a leap occurs, it must be small and immediately countered by stepwise motion in the opposite direction.
* Dissonances are to be confined to suspensions, passing notes and weak beats. If one falls on a strong beat (in a suspension) it must be immediately resolved.

Fux omits to mention the manner in which the musical phrasing of Palestrina followed the syntax of the sentences he was setting to music, something not always observed by earlier composers. Also to be noticed in Palestrina is a great deal of tone painting. Elementary examples of this are descending musical motion with Latin words like &quot;descendit&quot; (descends) or of a static musical or cadential moment with the words &quot;de coelis&quot; (from heaven).

==Reputation==

Palestrina was extremely famous in his day, and if anything, his reputation and influence increased after his death. J.S. Bach studied and hand-copied Palestrina&#x27;s first book of &quot;Masses&quot;, and in 1742 wrote his own adaptation of the Kyrie and Gloria of the &quot;Missa sine nomine&quot;. Felix Mendelssohn placed him in the pantheon of the greatest musicians, writing, &quot;I always get upset when some praise only Beethoven, others only Palestrina and still others only Mozart or Bach. All four of them, I say, or none at all.&quot;.

Conservative music of the Roman school continued to be written in Palestrina&#x27;s style (which in the 17th century came to be known as the &quot;prima prattica&quot;) by such students of his as Giovanni Maria Nanino, Ruggiero Giovanelli, Arcangelo Crivelli, Teofilo Gargari, Francesco Soriano, and Gregorio Allegri. As late as the 1750s, Palestrina&#x27;s style was still the reference for composers working in the motet form, as can be seen by Francesco Barsanti&#x27;s &quot;Sei Antifones&quot; &#x27;in the style of Palestrina&#x27; (c. 1750; published by [Peter] Welcker, c. 1762).

Much research on Palestrina was done in the 19th century by Giuseppe Baini, who published a monograph in 1828 which made Palestrina famous again and reinforced the already existing legend that he was the &quot;Saviour of Church Music&quot; during the reforms of the Council of Trent.

20th and 21st century scholarship by and large retains the view that Palestrina was a strong and refined composer whose music represents a summit of technical perfection. Contemporary analysis highlighted the modern qualities in the compositions of Palestrina such as research of color and sonority, use of sonic grouping in large-scale setting, interest in vertical as well as horizontal organization, studied attention to text setting. These unique characteristics, together with effortless delivery and an indefinable &quot;otherness&quot;, constitute to this day the attraction of Palestrina&#x27;s work.

The Cagliari music conservatory in Cagliari, Italy is named in his honor.

In 2009 a film about the composer was produced by German television ZDF/Arte. Title: &quot;Palestrina - Prince of Music&quot;, directed by Georg Brintrup.

<text>The group velocity of a wave is the velocity with which the overall envelope shape of the wave&#x27;s amplitudes—known as the &quot;modulation&quot; or &quot;envelope&quot; of the wave—propagates through space.

For example, if a stone is thrown into the middle of a very still pond, a circular pattern of waves with a quiescent center appears in the water, also known as a capillary wave. The expanding ring of waves is the wave group or wave packet, within which one can discern individual waves that travel faster than the group as a whole. The amplitudes of the individual waves grow as they emerge from the trailing edge of the group and diminish as they approach the leading edge of the group.

== History ==
The idea of a group velocity distinct from a wave&#x27;s phase velocity was first proposed by W.R. Hamilton in 1839, and the first full treatment was by Rayleigh in his &quot;Theory of Sound&quot; in 1877.

== Definition and interpretation ==

The group velocity is defined by the equation:
:formula_1

where is the wave&#x27;s angular frequency (usually expressed in radians per second), and is the angular wavenumber (usually expressed in radians per meter). The phase velocity is: .

The function , which gives as a function of , is known as the dispersion relation.

* If is directly proportional to , then the group velocity is exactly equal to the phase velocity. A wave of any shape will travel undistorted at this velocity.
* If &quot;ω&quot; is a linear function of &quot;k&quot;, but not directly proportional , then the group velocity and phase velocity are different. The envelope of a wave packet (see figure on right) will travel at the group velocity, while the individual peaks and troughs within the envelope will move at the phase velocity.
* If is not a linear function of , the envelope of a wave packet will become distorted as it travels. Since a wave packet contains a range of different frequencies (and hence different values of ), the group velocity will be different for different values of . Therefore, the envelope does not move at a single velocity, but its wavenumber components () move at different velocities, distorting the envelope. If the wavepacket has a narrow range of frequencies, and is approximately linear over that narrow range, the pulse distortion will be small, in relation to the small nonlinearity. See further discussion below. For example, for deep water gravity waves, formula_2, and hence . This underlies the &quot;Kelvin wake pattern&quot; for the bow wave of all ships and swimming objects. Regardless of how fast they are moving, as long as their velocity is constant, on each side the wake forms an angle of 19.47° = arcsin(1/3) with the line of travel. 
===Derivation===
One derivation of the formula for group velocity is as follows.

Consider a wave packet as a function of position and time .

Let be its Fourier transform at time ,
:formula_3

By the superposition principle, the wavepacket at any time is
:formula_4
where is implicitly a function of .

Assume that the wave packet is almost monochromatic, so that is sharply peaked around a central wavenumber .

Then, linearization gives
:formula_5
where 
:formula_6 and formula_7 
(see next section for discussion of this step). Then, after some algebra,
:formula_8

There are two factors in this expression. The first factor, formula_9, describes a perfect monochromatic wave with wavevector , with peaks and troughs moving at the phase velocity formula_10 within the envelope of the wavepacket.

The other factor, 
:formula_11, 
gives the envelope of the wavepacket. This envelope function depends on position and time &quot;only&quot; through the combination formula_12.

Therefore, the envelope of the wavepacket travels at velocity 
:formula_13 
which explains the group velocity formula.

=== Other expressions ===
For light, the refractive index , vacuum wavelength , and wavelength in the medium , are related by
:formula_14
with the phase velocity.

The group velocity, therefore, can be calculated by any of the following formulas,
:formula_15

==Dispersion==
Part of the previous derivation is the Taylor series approximation that:
:formula_16

If the wavepacket has a relatively large frequency spread, or if the dispersion has sharp variations (such as due to a resonance), or if the packet travels over very long distances, this assumption is not valid, and higher-order terms in the Taylor expansion become important.

As a result, the envelope of the wave packet not only moves, but also &quot;distorts,&quot; in a manner that can be described by the material&#x27;s group velocity dispersion. Loosely speaking, different frequency-components of the wavepacket travel at different speeds, with the faster components moving towards the front of the wavepacket and the slower moving towards the back. Eventually, the wave packet gets stretched out. This is an important effect in the propagation of signals through optical fibers and in the design of high-power, short-pulse lasers.

== Relation to phase velocity, refractive index and transmission speed ==

==In three dimensions==

For waves traveling through three dimensions, such as light waves, sound waves, and matter waves, the formulas for phase and group velocity are generalized in a straightforward way:
*One dimension: formula_17
*Three dimensions: formula_18
where formula_19 means the gradient of the angular frequency as a function of the wave vector formula_20, and formula_21 is the unit vector in direction k.

If the waves are propagating through an anisotropic (i.e., not rotationally symmetric) medium, for example a crystal, then the phase velocity vector and group velocity vector may point in different directions.

== In lossy or gainful media ==
The group velocity is often thought of as the velocity at which energy or information is conveyed along a wave. In most cases this is accurate, and the group velocity can be thought of as the signal velocity of the waveform. However, if the wave is travelling through an absorptive or gainful medium, this does not always hold. In these cases the group velocity may not be a well-defined quantity, or may not be a meaningful quantity.

In his text &quot;Wave Propagation in Periodic Structures&quot;, Brillouin argued that in a lossy medium the group velocity ceases to have a clear physical meaning. An example concerning the transmission of electromagnetic waves through an atomic gas is given by Loudon. Another example is mechanical waves in the solar photosphere: The waves are damped (by radiative heat flow from the peaks to the troughs), and related to that, the energy velocity is often substantially lower than the waves&#x27; group velocity.

Despite this ambiguity, a common way to extend the concept of group velocity to complex media is to consider spatially damped plane wave solutions inside the medium, which are characterized by a &quot;complex-valued&quot; wavevector. Then, the imaginary part of the wavevector is arbitrarily discarded and the usual formula for group velocity is applied to the real part of wavevector, i.e.,
:formula_22

Or, equivalently, in terms of the real part of complex refractive index, , one has
:formula_23

It can be shown that this generalization of group velocity continues to be related to the apparent speed of the peak of a wavepacket. The above definition is not universal, however: alternatively one may consider the time damping of standing waves (real , complex ), or, allow group velocity to be a complex-valued quantity. Different considerations yield distinct velocities, yet all definitions agree for the case of a lossless, gainless medium.

The above generalization of group velocity for complex media can behave strangely, and the example of anomalous dispersion serves as a good illustration.
At the edges of a region of anomalous dispersion, formula_24 becomes infinite (surpassing even the speed of light in vacuum), and formula_24 may easily become negative 
(its sign opposes Re) inside the band of anomalous dispersion.

=== Superluminal group velocities ===
Since the 1980s, various experiments have verified that it is possible for the group velocity (as defined above) of laser light pulses sent through lossy materials, or gainful materials, to significantly exceed the speed of light in vacuum . The peaks of wavepackets were also seen to move faster than .

In all these cases, however, there is no possibility that signals could be carried faster than the speed of light in vacuum, since the high value of does not help to speed up the true motion of the sharp wavefront that would occur at the start of any real signal. Essentially the seemingly superluminal transmission is an artifact of the narrow band approximation used above to define group velocity and happens because of resonance phenomena in the intervening medium. In a wide band analysis it is seen that the apparently paradoxical speed of propagation of the signal envelope is actually the result of local interference of a wider band of frequencies over many cycles, all of which propagate perfectly causally and at phase velocity. The result is akin to the fact that shadows can travel faster than light, even if the light causing them always propagates at light speed; since the phenomenon being measured is only loosely connected with causality, it does not necessarily respect the rules of causal propagation, even if it under normal circumstances does so and leads to a common intuition.

<text>In mathematics, a group action of a group on a set is a group homomorphism from to some group (under function composition) of functions from to itself. It is said that acts on .

Many sets of transformations form a group under function composition; for example, the rotations around a point in the plane. It is often useful to consider the group as an abstract group, and to say that one has a group action of the abstract group that consists of performing the transformations of the group of transformations. The reason for distinguishing the group from the transformations is that, generally, a group of transformations of a structure acts also on various related structures; for example, the above rotation group also acts on triangles by transforming triangles into triangles.

If a group acts on a structure, it will usually also act on objects built from that structure. For example, the group of Euclidean isometries acts on Euclidean space and also on the figures drawn in it; in particular, it acts on the set of all triangles. Similarly, the group of symmetries of a polyhedron acts on the vertices, the edges, and the faces of the polyhedron.

A group action on a vector space is called a representation of the group. In the case of a finite-dimensional vector space, it allows one to identify many groups with subgroups of the general linear group , the group of the invertible matrices of dimension over a field .

The symmetric group acts on any set with elements by permuting the elements of the set. Although the group of all permutations of a set depends formally on the set, the concept of group action allows one to consider a single group for studying the permutations of all sets with the same cardinality.

== Definition ==

=== Left group action ===
If is a group with identity element , and is a set, then a (&quot;left&quot;) &quot;group action&quot; of on is a function
: formula_1
that satisfies the following two axioms:
for all and in and all in .

The group is then said to act on (from the left). A set together with an action of is called a (&quot;left&quot;) -&quot;set&quot;.

It can be notationally convenient to curry the action , so that, instead, one has a collection of transformations , with one transformation for each group element . The identity and compatibility relations then read
: formula_2
and
: formula_3
with being function composition. The second axiom then states that the function composition is compatible with the group multiplication; they form a commutative diagram. This axiom can be shortened even further, and written as .

With the above understanding, it is very common to avoid writing entirely, and to replace it with either a dot, or with nothing at all. Thus, can be shortened to or , especially when the action is clear from context. The axioms are then
: formula_4
: formula_5

From these two axioms, it follows that for any fixed in , the function from to itself which maps to is a bijection, with inverse bijection the corresponding map for . Therefore, one may equivalently define a group action of on as a group homomorphism from into the symmetric group of all bijections from to itself.

=== Right group action ===
Likewise, a &quot;right group action&quot; of on is a function
: formula_6
that satisfies the analogous axioms:
(with often shortened to or when the action being considered is clear from context)

for all and in and all in .

The difference between left and right actions is in the order in which a product acts on . For a left action, acts first, followed by second. For a right action, acts first, followed by second. Because of the formula , a left action can be constructed from a right action by composing with the inverse operation of the group. Also, a right action of a group on can be considered as a left action of its opposite group on .

Thus, for establishing general properties of group actions, it suffices to consider only left actions. However, there are cases where this is not possible. For example, the multiplication of a group induces both a left action and a right action on the group itself—multiplication on the left and on the right, respectively.

== Notable properties of actions ==
Let be a group acting on a set . The action is called &#x27; or &#x27; if for all implies that . Equivalently, the homomorphism from to the group of bijections of corresponding to the action is injective.

The action is called &quot;&quot; (or &quot;semiregular&quot; or &quot;fixed-point free&quot;) if the statement that for some already implies that . In other words, no non-trivial element of fixes a point of . This is a much stronger property than faithfulness.

For example, the action of any group on itself by left multiplication is free. This observation implies Cayley&#x27;s theorem that any group can be embedded in a symmetric group (which is infinite when the group is). A finite group may act faithfully on a set of size much smaller than its cardinality (however such an action cannot be free). For instance the abelian 2-group (of cardinality ) acts faithfully on a set of size . This is not always the case, for example the cyclic group cannot act faithfully on a set of size less than .

In general the smallest set on which a faithful action can be defined can vary greatly for groups of the same size. For example, three groups of size 120 are the symmetric group , the icosahedral group and the cyclic group . The smallest sets on which faithful actions can be defined for these groups are of size 5, 7, and 16 respectively.

=== Transitivity properties ===
The action of on is called &quot;&quot; if for any two points there exists a so that .

The action is &#x27; (or &quot;sharply transitive&quot;, or &#x27;) if it is both transitive and free. This means that given the element in the definition of transitivity is unique. If is acted upon simply transitively by a group then it is called a principal homogeneous space for or a -torsor.

For an integer , the action is if has at least elements, and for any pair of -tuples with pairwise distinct entries (that is , when ) there exists a such that for . In other words, the action on the subset of of tuples without repeated entries is transitive. For this is often called double, respectively triple, transitivity. The class of 2-transitive groups (that is, subgroups of a finite symmetric group whose action is 2-transitive) and more generally multiply transitive groups is well-studied in finite group theory.

An action is when the action on tuples without repeated entries in is sharply transitive.

==== Examples ====
The action of the symmetric group of is transitive, in fact -transitive for any up to the cardinality of . If has cardinality , the action of the alternating group is -transitive but not -transitive.

The action of the general linear group of a vector space on the set of non-zero vectors is transitive, but not 2-transitive (similarly for the action of the special linear group if the dimension of is at least 2). The action of the orthogonal group of a Euclidean space is not transitive on nonzero vectors but it is on the unit sphere.

=== Primitive actions ===

The action of on is called &quot;primitive&quot; if there is no partition of preserved by all elements of apart from the trivial partitions (the partition in a single piece and its dual, the partition into singletons).

=== Topological properties ===
Assume that is a topological space and the action of is by homeomorphisms.

The action is &quot;wandering&quot; if every has a neighbourhood such that there are only finitely many with .

More generally, a point is called a point of discontinuity for the action of if there is an open subset such that there are only finitely many with . The &quot;domain of discontinuity&quot; of the action is the set of all points of discontinuity. Equivalently it is the largest -stable open subset such that the action of on is wandering. In a dynamical context this is also called a &quot;wandering set&quot;.

The action is &quot;properly discontinuous&quot; if for every compact subset there are only finitely many such that . This is strictly stronger than wandering; for instance the action of on given by is wandering and free but not properly discontinuous.

The action by deck transformations of the fundamental group of a locally simply connected space on a universal cover is wandering and free. Such actions can be characterized by the following property: every has a neighbourhood such that for every . Actions with this property are sometimes called &quot;freely discontinuous&quot;, and the largest subset on which the action is freely discontinuous is then called the &quot;free regular set&quot;.

An action of a group on a locally compact space is called &quot;cocompact&quot; if there exists a compact subset such that . For a properly discontinuous action, cocompactness is equivalent to compactness of the quotient space .

=== Actions of topological groups ===

Now assume is a topological group and a topological space on which it acts by homeomorphisms. The action is said to be &quot;continuous&quot; if the map is continuous for the product topology.

The action is said to be &quot;&quot; if the map defined by is proper. This means that given compact sets the set of such that is compact. In particular, this is equivalent to proper discontinuity is a discrete group.

It is said to be &quot;locally free&quot; if there exists a neighbourhood of such that for all and .

The action is said to be &quot;strongly continuous&quot; if the orbital map is continuous for every . Contrary to what the name suggests, this is a weaker property than continuity of the action.

If is a Lie group and a differentiable manifold, then the subspace of &quot;smooth points&quot; for the action is the set of points such that the map is smooth. There is a well-developed theory of Lie group actions, i.e. action which are smooth on the whole space.

=== Linear actions ===

If acts by linear transformations on a module over a commutative ring, the action is said to be irreducible if there are no proper nonzero -invariant submodules. It is said to be &quot;semisimple&quot; if it decomposes as a direct sum of irreducible actions.

== Orbits and stabilizers ==

Consider a group acting on a set . The &quot; of an element in is the set of elements in to which can be moved by the elements of . The orbit of is denoted by :
formula_7

The defining properties of a group guarantee that the set of orbits of (points in) under the action of form a partition of . The associated equivalence relation is defined by saying if and only if there exists a in with . The orbits are then the equivalence classes under this relation; two elements and are equivalent if and only if their orbits are the same, that is, .

The group action is transitive if and only if it has exactly one orbit, that is, if there exists in with . This is the case if and only if for in (given that is non-empty).

The set of all orbits of under the action of is written as (or, less frequently, as ), and is called the &#x27; of the action. In geometric situations it may be called the &#x27;, while in algebraic situations it may be called the space of &quot;, and written , by contrast with the invariants (fixed points), denoted : the coinvariants are a while the invariants are a . The coinvariant terminology and notation are used particularly in group cohomology and group homology, which use the same superscript/subscript convention.

=== Invariant subsets ===
If is a subset of , then denotes the set . The subset is said to be &quot;invariant under &quot; if (which is equivalent ). In that case, also operates on by restricting the action to . The subset is called &quot;fixed under &quot; if for all in and all in . Every subset that is fixed under is also invariant under , but not conversely.

Every orbit is an invariant subset of on which acts transitively. Conversely, any invariant subset of is a union of orbits. The action of on is &quot;transitive&quot; if and only if all elements are equivalent, meaning that there is only one orbit.

A &quot;-invariant&quot; element of is such that for all . The set of all such is denoted and called the &quot;-invariants&quot; of . When is a -module, is the zeroth cohomology group of with coefficients in , and the higher cohomology groups are the derived functors of the functor of -invariants.

=== Fixed points and stabilizer subgroups ===
Given in and in with , it is said that &quot; is a fixed point of &quot; or that &quot; fixes &quot;. For every in , the of with respect to (also called the isotropy group or little group) is the set of all elements in that fix :
formula_8
This is a subgroup of , though typically not a normal one. The action of on is free if and only if all stabilizers are trivial. The kernel of the homomorphism with the symmetric group, , is given by the intersection of the stabilizers for all in . If is trivial, the action is said to be faithful (or effective).

Let and be two elements in , and let be a group element such that . Then the two stabilizer groups and are related by . Proof: by definition, if and only if . Applying to both sides of this equality yields ; that is, . An opposite inclusion follows similarly by taking and .

The above says that the stabilizers of elements in the same orbit are conjugate to each other. Thus, to each orbit, we can associate a conjugacy class of a subgroup of (that is, the set of all conjugates of the subgroup). Let denote the conjugacy class of . Then the orbit has type if the stabilizer of some/any in belongs to . A maximal orbit type is often called a principal orbit type.
Orbits and stabilizers are closely related. For a fixed in , consider the map given by . By definition the image of this map is the orbit . The condition for two elements to have the same image is
formula_9
In other words, &quot;if and only if&quot; and lie in the same coset for the stabilizer subgroup . Thus, the fiber of over any in is contained in such a coset, and every such coset also occurs as a fiber. Therefore induces a between the set of cosets for the stabilizer subgroup and the orbit , which sends . This result is known as the &quot;orbit-stabilizer theorem&quot;.

If is finite then the orbit-stabilizer theorem, together with Lagrange&#x27;s theorem, gives
formula_10
in other words the length of the orbit of times the order of its stabilizer is the order of the group. In particular that implies that the orbit length is a divisor of the group order.

: Example: Let be a group of prime order acting on a set with elements. Since each orbit has either or elements, there are at least orbits of length which are -invariant elements. More specifically, and the number of -invariant elements are congruent modulo .

This result is especially useful since it can be employed for counting arguments (typically in situations where is finite as well).
: Example: We can use the orbit-stabilizer theorem to count the automorphisms of a graph. Consider the cubical graph as pictured, and let denote its automorphism group. Then acts on the set of vertices , and this action is transitive as can be seen by composing rotations about the center of the cube. Thus, by the orbit-stabilizer theorem, . Applying the theorem now to the stabilizer , we can obtain . Any element of that fixes 1 must send 2 to either 2, 4, or 5. As an example of such automorphisms consider the rotation around the diagonal axis through 1 and 7 by , which permutes 2, 4, 5 and 3, 6, 8, and fixes 1 and 7. Thus, . Applying the theorem a third time gives . Any element of that fixes 1 and 2 must send 3 to either 3 or 6. Reflecting the cube at the plane through 1, 2, 7 and 8 is such an automorphism sending 3 to 6, thus . One also sees that consists only of the identity automorphism, as any element of fixing 1, 2 and 3 must also fix all other vertices, since they are determined by their adjacency to 1, 2 and 3. Combining the preceding calculations, we can now obtain .

=== Burnside&#x27;s lemma ===
A result closely related to the orbit-stabilizer theorem is Burnside&#x27;s lemma:
formula_11
where is the set of points fixed by . This result is mainly of use when and are finite, when it can be interpreted as follows: the number of orbits is equal to the average number of points fixed per group element.

Fixing a group , the set of formal differences of finite -sets forms a ring called the Burnside ring of , where addition corresponds to disjoint union, and multiplication to Cartesian product.

== Examples ==
* The &quot;&quot; action of any group on any set is defined by for all in and all in ; that is, every group element induces the identity permutation on .
* In every group , left multiplication is an action of on : for all , in . This action is free and transitive (regular), and forms the basis of a rapid proof of Cayley&#x27;s theorem – that every group is isomorphic to a subgroup of the symmetric group of permutations of the set .
* In every group with subgroup , left multiplication is an action of on the set of cosets : for all , in . In particular if contains no nontrivial normal subgroups of this induces an isomorphism from to a subgroup of the permutation group of degree .
* In every group , conjugation is an action of on : . An exponential notation is commonly used for the right-action variant: ; it satisfies (.
* In every group with subgroup , conjugation is an action of on conjugates of : for all in and conjugates of .
* An action of on a set uniquely determines and is determined by an automorphism of , given by the action of 1. Similarly, an action of on is equivalent to the data of an involution of .
* The symmetric group and its subgroups act on the set by permuting its elements
* The symmetry group of a polyhedron acts on the set of vertices of that polyhedron. It also acts on the set of faces or the set of edges of the polyhedron.
* The symmetry group of any geometrical object acts on the set of points of that object.
* For a coordinate space over a field with group of units , the mapping given by is a group action called scalar multiplication.
* The automorphism group of a vector space (or graph, or group, or ring ...) acts on the vector space (or set of vertices of the graph, or group, or ring ...).
* The general linear group and its subgroups, particularly its Lie subgroups (including the special linear group , orthogonal group , special orthogonal group , and symplectic group ) are Lie groups that act on the vector space . The group operations are given by multiplying the matrices from the groups with the vectors from .
* The general linear group acts on by natural matrix action. The orbits of its action are classified by the greatest common divisor of coordinates of the vector in .
* The affine group acts transitively on the points of an affine space, and the subgroup V of the affine group (that is, a vector space) has transitive and free (that is, &quot;regular&quot;) action on these points; indeed this can be used to give a definition of an affine space.
* The projective linear group and its subgroups, particularly its Lie subgroups, which are Lie groups that act on the projective space . This is a quotient of the action of the general linear group on projective space. Particularly notable is , the symmetries of the projective line, which is sharply 3-transitive, preserving the cross ratio; the Möbius group is of particular interest.
* The isometries of the plane act on the set of 2D images and patterns, such as wallpaper patterns. The definition can be made more precise by specifying what is meant by image or pattern, for example, a function of position with values in a set of colors. Isometries are in fact one example of affine group (action).
* The sets acted on by a group comprise the category of -sets in which the objects are -sets and the morphisms are -set homomorphisms: functions such that for every in .
* The Galois group of a field extension acts on the field but has only a trivial action on elements of the subfield . Subgroups of correspond to subfields of that contain , that is, intermediate field extensions between and .
* The additive group of the real numbers acts on the phase space of &quot;well-behaved&quot; systems in classical mechanics (and in more general dynamical systems) by time translation: if is in and is in the phase space, then describes a state of the system, and is defined to be the state of the system seconds later if is positive or seconds ago if is negative.
*The additive group of the real numbers acts on the set of real functions of a real variable in various ways, with equal to, for example, , , , , , or , but not .
* Given a group action of on , we can define an induced action of on the power set of , by setting for every subset of and every in . This is useful, for instance, in studying the action of the large Mathieu group on a 24-set and in studying symmetry in certain models of finite geometries.
* The quaternions with norm 1 (the versors), as a multiplicative group, act on : for any such quaternion , the mapping is a counterclockwise rotation through an angle about an axis given by a unit vector ; is the same rotation; see quaternions and spatial rotation. This is not a faithful action because the quaternion leaves all points where they were, as does the quaternion .
* Given left -sets , , there is a left -set whose elements are -equivariant maps , and with left -action given by (where &quot;&quot; indicates right multiplication by ). This -set has the property that its fixed points correspond to equivariant maps ; more generally, it is an exponential object in the category of -sets.

== Group actions and groupoids ==

The notion of group action can be encoded by the &quot;action groupoid&quot; associated to the group action. The stabilizers of the action are the vertex groups of the groupoid and the orbits of the action are its components.

== Morphisms and isomorphisms between &quot;G&quot;-sets ==
If and are two -sets, a &quot;morphism&quot; from to is a function such that for all in and all in . Morphisms of -sets are also called &quot;equivariant maps&quot; or -&quot;maps&quot;.

The composition of two morphisms is again a morphism. If a morphism is bijective, then its inverse is also a morphism. In this case is called an &quot;isomorphism&quot;, and the two -sets and are called &quot;isomorphic&quot;; for all practical purposes, isomorphic -sets are indistinguishable.

Some example isomorphisms:
* Every regular action is isomorphic to the action of on given by left multiplication.
* Every free action is isomorphic to , where is some set and acts on by left multiplication on the first coordinate. ( can be taken to be the set of orbits .)
* Every transitive action is isomorphic to left multiplication by on the set of left cosets of some subgroup of . ( can be taken to be the stabilizer group of any element of the original -set.)

With this notion of morphism, the collection of all -sets forms a category; this category is a Grothendieck topos (in fact, assuming a classical metalogic, this topos will even be Boolean).

== Variants and generalizations ==
We can also consider actions of monoids on sets, by using the same two axioms as above. This does not define bijective maps and equivalence relations however. See semigroup action.

Instead of actions on sets, we can define actions of groups and monoids on objects of an arbitrary category: start with an object of some category, and then define an action on as a monoid homomorphism into the monoid of endomorphisms of . If has an underlying set, then all definitions and facts stated above can be carried over. For example, if we take the category of vector spaces, we obtain group representations in this fashion.

We can view a group as a category with a single object in which every morphism is invertible. A (left) group action is then nothing but a (covariant) functor from to the category of sets, and a group representation is a functor from to the category of vector spaces. A morphism between -sets is then a natural transformation between the group action functors. In analogy, an action of a groupoid is a functor from the groupoid to the category of sets or to some other category.

In addition to continuous actions of topological groups on topological spaces, one also often considers smooth actions of Lie groups on smooth manifolds, regular actions of algebraic groups on algebraic varieties, and actions of group schemes on schemes. All of these are examples of group objects acting on objects of their respective category.

<text>gzip is a file format and a software application used for file compression and decompression. The program was created by Jean-loup Gailly and Mark Adler as a free software replacement for the compress program used in early Unix systems, and intended for use by GNU (from which the &quot;g&quot; of gzip is derived). Version 0.1 was first publicly released on 31 October 1992, and version 1.0 followed in February 1993.

The decompression of the &quot;gzip&quot; format can be implemented as a streaming algorithm, an important feature for Web protocols, data interchange and ETL (in standard pipes) applications.

== File format ==
gzip is based on the DEFLATE algorithm, which is a combination of LZ77 and Huffman coding. DEFLATE was intended as a replacement for LZW and other patent-encumbered data compression algorithms which, at the time, limited the usability of the compress utility and other popular archivers.

&quot;gzip&quot; is often also used to refer to the gzip file format, which is:
* a 10-byte header, containing a magic number (codice_1), the compression method (codice_2 for DEFLATE), 1-byte of header flags, a 4-byte timestamp, compression flags and the operating system ID.
* optional extra headers as allowed by the header flags, including the original filename, a comment field, an &quot;extra&quot; field, and the lower half of a CRC-32 checksum for the header section.
* a body, containing a DEFLATE-compressed payload
* an 8-byte trailer, containing a CRC-32 checksum and the length of the original uncompressed data, modulo 232.
Although its file format also allows for multiple such streams to be concatenated (gzipped files are simply decompressed concatenated as if they were originally one file), gzip is normally used to compress just single files. Compressed archives are typically created by assembling collections of files into a single tar archive (also called tarball), and then compressing that archive with gzip. The final compressed file usually has the extension or .

gzip is not to be confused with the ZIP archive format, which also uses DEFLATE. The ZIP format can hold collections of files without an external archiver, but is less compact than compressed tarballs holding the same data, because it compresses files individually and cannot take advantage of redundancy between files (solid compression).
The gzip file format is also not to be confused with that of the compress utility, based on LZW, with extension ; however, the gunzip utility is able to decompress .Z files.

==Implementations==

Various implementations of the program have been written. The most commonly known is the GNU Project&#x27;s implementation using Lempel-Ziv coding (LZ77). OpenBSD&#x27;s version of gzip is actually the compress program, to which support for the gzip format was added in OpenBSD 3.4. The &#x27;g&#x27; in this specific version stands for &quot;&quot;. FreeBSD, DragonFly BSD and NetBSD use a BSD-licensed implementation instead of the GNU version; it is actually a command-line interface for zlib intended to be compatible with the GNU implementations&#x27; options. These implementations originally come from NetBSD, and support decompression of bzip2 and the Unix pack format.

An alternative compression program achieving 3-8% better compression is Zopfli. It achieves gzip-compatible compression using more exhaustive algorithms, at the expense of compression time required. It does not affect decompression time.

codice_3, written by Mark Adler, is compatible with gzip and speeds up compression by using all available CPU cores and threads.

=== Damage recovery ===
Data in blocks prior to the first damaged part of the archive is usually fully readable. Data from blocks not demolished by damage that are located afterward &quot;may&quot; be recoverable through difficult workarounds.

== Derivatives and other uses ==
The tar utility included in most Linux distributions can extract .tar.gz files by passing the option, e.g., , where codice_4 instructs decompression, codice_5 means extraction, and codice_6 specifies the name of the compressed archive file to extract from. Optionally, codice_7 (&quot;verbose&quot;) lists files as they are being extracted.

zlib is an abstraction of the DEFLATE algorithm in library form which includes support both for the gzip file format and a lightweight data stream format in its API. The zlib stream format, DEFLATE, and the gzip file format were standardized respectively as RFC 1950, RFC 1951, and RFC 1952.

The gzip format is used in HTTP compression, a technique used to speed up the sending of HTML and other content on the World Wide Web. It is one of the three standard formats for HTTP compression as specified in RFC 2616. This RFC also specifies a zlib format (called &quot;DEFLATE&quot;), which is equal to the gzip format except that gzip adds eleven bytes of overhead in the form of headers and trailers. Still, the gzip format is sometimes recommended over zlib because Internet Explorer does not implement the standard correctly and cannot handle the zlib format as specified in RFC 1950.

zlib DEFLATE is used internally by the Portable Network Graphics (PNG) format.

Since the late 1990s, bzip2, a file compression utility based on a block-sorting algorithm, has gained some popularity as a gzip replacement. It produces considerably smaller files (especially for source code and other structured text), but at the cost of memory and processing time (up to a factor of 4).

AdvanceCOMP, Zopfli, libdeflate and 7-Zip can produce gzip-compatible files, using an internal DEFLATE implementation with better compression ratios than gzip itself—at the cost of more processor time compared to the reference implementation.

Research published in 2023 showed that simple lossless compression techniques such as gzip could be combined with a k-nearest-neighbor classifier to create an attractive alternative to deep neural networks for text classification in natural language processing. This approach has been shown to equal and in some cases outperform conventional approaches such as BERT due to low resource requirements, e.g. no requirement for GPU hardware.

<doc id="12786" wikidata="Q2755101" url="?curid=12786" title="General anaesthetic">
<text>General anaesthetics (or anesthetics) are often defined as compounds that induce a loss of consciousness in humans or loss of righting reflex in animals. Clinical definitions are also extended to include an induced coma that causes lack of awareness to painful stimuli, sufficient to facilitate surgical applications in clinical and veterinary practice. General anaesthetics do not act as analgesics and should also not be confused with sedatives. General anaesthetics are a structurally diverse group of compounds whose mechanisms encompass multiple biological targets involved in the control of neuronal pathways. The precise workings are the subject of some debate and ongoing research.

General anesthetics elicit a state of general anesthesia. It remains somewhat controversial regarding how this state should be defined. General anesthetics, however, typically elicit several key reversible effects: immobility, analgesia, amnesia, unconsciousness, and reduced autonomic responsiveness to noxious stimuli.

==Mode of administration==
General anaesthetics can be administered either as gases or vapours (inhalational anaesthetics), or as injections (intravenous or even intramuscular). All of these agents share the property of being quite hydrophobic (i.e., as liquids, they are not freely miscible—or mixable—in water, and as gases they dissolve in oils better than in water). It is possible to deliver anaesthesia solely by inhalation or injection, but most commonly the two forms are combined, with an injection given to induce anaesthesia and a gas used to maintain it.

===Inhalation===
Inhalational anaesthetic substances are either volatile liquids or gases, and are usually delivered using an anaesthesia machine. An anaesthesia machine allows composing a mixture of oxygen, anaesthetics and ambient air, delivering it to the patient and monitoring patient and machine parameters. Liquid anaesthetics are vapourised in the machine.

Many compounds have been used for inhalation anaesthesia, but only a few are still in widespread use. Desflurane, isoflurane and sevoflurane are the most widely used volatile anaesthetics today. They are often combined with nitrous oxide. Older, less popular volatile anaesthetics include halothane, enflurane, and methoxyflurane. Researchers are also actively exploring the use of xenon as an anaesthetic.

===Injection===

Injectable anaesthetics are used for the induction and maintenance of a state of unconsciousness. Anaesthetists prefer to use intravenous injections, as they are faster, generally less painful and more reliable than intramuscular or subcutaneous injections. Among the most widely used drugs are:
* Propofol
* Etomidate
* Barbiturates such as methohexital and thiopentone/thiopental
* Benzodiazepines such as midazolam
* Ketamine is used in the UK as &quot;field anaesthesia&quot;, for instance in road traffic incidents or similar situations where an operation must be conducted at the scene or when there is not enough time to move to an operating room, while preferring other anaesthetics where conditions allow their use. It is more frequently used in the operative setting in the US.
Benzodiazepines are sedatives and are used in combinations with other general anaesthetics.

==Mechanism of action==

Induction and maintenance of general anesthesia, and the control of the various physiological side effects is typically achieved through a combinatorial drug approach. Individual general anesthetics vary with respect to their specific physiological and cognitive effects. While general anesthesia induction may be facilitated by one general anesthetic, others may be used in parallel or subsequently to achieve and maintain the desired anesthetic state. The drug approach utilized is dependent upon the procedure and the needs of the healthcare providers.

It is postulated that general anaesthetics exert their action by the activation of inhibitory central nervous system (CNS) receptors, and the inactivation of CNS excitatory receptors. The relative roles of different receptors is still under debate, but evidence exists for particular targets being involved with certain anaesthetics and drug effects.

Below are several key targets of general anesthetics that likely mediate their effects:

=== GABAA receptor agonists ===
* GABAA receptors are chloride channels that hyperpolarize neurons and function as inhibitory CNS receptors. General anesthetics that agonize them are typically used to induce a state of sedation and/or unconsciousness. Such drugs include propofol, etomidate, isoflurane, benzodiazepines (midazolam, lorazepam, diazepam), and barbiturates (sodium thiopental, methohexital).

=== NMDA receptor antagonists ===
* Ketamine, an NMDA receptor antagonist, is used primarily for its analgesic effects and in an off-label capacity for its anti-depressant effects. This drug, however, also alters arousal and is often used in parallel with other general anesthetics to help maintain a state of general anesthesia. Administration of ketamine alone leads to a dissociative state, in which a patient may experience auditory and visual hallucinations. Additionally, the perception of pain is dissociated from the perception of noxious stimuli. Ketamine appears to bind preferentially to the NMDA receptors on GABAergic interneurons, which may partially explain its effects.

=== Two-pore potassium channels (K2Ps) activation ===
* Two-pore potassium channels (K2Ps) modulate the potassium conductance that contributes to the resting membrane potential in neurons. Opening of these channels therefore facilitates a hyperpolarizing current, which reduces neuronal excitability. K2Ps have been found to be affected by general anesthetics (esp. halogenated inhalation anesthetics) and are currently under investigation as potential targets. The K2P channel family comprises six subfamilies, which includes 15 unique members. 13 of these channels (excluding TWIK-1 and TWIK-2 homomers) are affected by general anesthetics. While it has not been determined that general anesthetics bind directly to these channels, nor is it clear how these drugs affect K2P conductance, electrophysiological studies have shown that certain general anesthetics result in K2P channel activation. This drug-elicited channel activation has been shown to be dependent upon specific amino-acids within certain K2P channels (i.e. TREK-1 and TASK channels). In the case of TREK-1, activation was shown through an anesthetic perturbation to membrane lipid clusters and activation of phospholipase D2; direct binding of anesthetics to purified reconstituted TREK-1 had no effect on conductance. The effects of certain general anesthetics are less pronounced in K2P knock-out mice, as compared to their wild-type counterparts. Cumulatively, TASK-1, TASK-3, and TREK-1 are particularly well supported as playing a role in the induction of general anesthesia.

=== Others ===
* Opioid receptor agonists are primarily utilized for their analgesic effects. These drugs, however, can also elicit sedation. This effect is mediated by opioid actions on both opioid and acetylcholine receptors. While these drugs can lead to decreased arousal, they do not elicit a loss of consciousness. For this reason, they are often used in parallel with other general anesthetics to help maintain a state of general anesthesia. Such drugs include morphine, fentanyl, hydromorphone, and remifentanil.
* Administration of the alpha2 adrenergic receptor agonist dexmedetomidine leads to sedation that resembles non-REM sleep. It is used in parallel with other general anesthetics to help maintain a state of general anesthesia, in an off-label capacity. Notably, patients are easily aroused from this non-REM sleep state.
* Dopamine receptor antagonists have sedative and antiemetic properties. Previously, they were used in parallel with opioids to elicit neuroleptic anesthesia (catalepsy, analgesia, and unresponsiveness). They are no longer used in the context, because patients experiencing neuroleptic anesthesia were frequently aware of the medical procedures being performed, but could not move or express emotion. Such drugs include haloperidol and droperidol.

== Stages of anesthesia ==
During administration of an anesthetic, the receiver goes through different stages of behavior ultimately leading to unconsciousness. This process is accelerated with intravenous anesthetics, so much so that it is negligible to consider during their use. The four stages of anesthesia are described using Guedel&#x27;s signs, signifying the depth of anesthesia. These stages describe effects of anesthesia mainly on cognition, muscular activity, and respiration.

=== Stage I: Analgesia ===
The receiver of the anesthesia primarily feels analgesia followed by amnesia and a sense of confusion moving into the next stage.

=== Stage II: Excitement ===
Stage II is often characterized by the receiver being delirious and confused, with severe amnesia. Irregularities in the patterns of respiration are common at this stage of anesthesia. Nausea and vomiting are also indicators of Stage II anesthesia. Struggling and panic can sometimes occur as a result of delirium.

=== Stage III: Surgical Anesthesia ===
Normal breathing resumes at the beginnings of Stage III. Nearing the end of the stage, breathing ceases completely. Indicators for stage III anesthesia include loss of the eyelash reflex as well as regular breathing. Depth of stage III anesthesia can often be gauged by eye movement and pupil size.

=== Stage IV: Medullary Depression ===
No respiration occurs in stage IV. This is shortly followed by circulatory failure and depression of the vasomotor centers. Death is common at this stage of anesthesia if no breathing and circulatory support is available.

== Physiological side effects ==
Aside from the clinically advantageous effects of general anesthetics, there are a number of other physiological consequences mediated by this class of drug. Notably, a reduction in blood pressure can be facilitated by a variety of mechanisms, including reduced cardiac contractility and dilation of the vasculature. This drop in blood pressure may activate a reflexive increase in heart rate, due to a baroreceptor-mediated feedback mechanism. Some anesthetics, however, disrupt this reflex.

Patients under general anesthesia are at greater risk of developing hypothermia, as the aforementioned vasodilation increases the heat lost via peripheral blood flow. By and large, these drugs reduce the internal body temperature threshold at which autonomic thermoregulatory mechanisms are triggered in response to cold. (On the other hand, the threshold at which thermoregulatory mechanisms are triggered in response to heat is typically increased.)

Anesthetics typically affect respiration. Inhalational anesthetics elicit bronchodilation, an increase in respiratory rate, and reduced tidal volume. The net effect is decreased respiration, which must be managed by healthcare providers, while the patient is under general anesthesia. The reflexes that function to alleviate airway obstructions are also dampened (e.g. gag and cough). Compounded with a reduction in lower esophageal sphincter tone, which increases the frequency of regurgitation, patients are especially prone to asphyxiation while under general anesthesia. Healthcare providers closely monitor individuals under general anesthesia and utilize a number of devices, such as an endotracheal tube, to ensure patient safety.

General anesthetics also affect the chemoreceptor trigger zone and brainstem vomiting center, eliciting nausea and vomiting following treatment.

==Pharmacokinetics==

=== Intravenous general anesthetics ===

====Induction====

Intravenously delivered general anesthetics are typically small and highly lipophilic molecules. These characteristics facilitate their rapid preferential distribution into the brain and spinal cord, which are both highly vascularized and lipophilic. It is here where the actions of these drugs lead to general anesthesia induction.

====Elimination====
Following distribution into the central nervous system (CNS), the anesthetic drug then diffuses out of the CNS into the muscles and viscera, followed by adipose tissues. In patients given a single injection of drug, this redistribution results in termination of general anesthesia. Therefore, following administration of a single anesthetic bolus, duration of drug effect is dependent solely upon the redistribution kinetics.

The half-life of an anesthetic drug following a prolonged infusion, however, depends upon both drug redistribution kinetics, drug metabolism in the liver, and existing drug concentration in fat. When large quantities of an anesthetic drug have already been dissolved in the body&#x27;s fat stores, this can slow its redistribution out of the brain and spinal cord, prolonging its CNS effects. For this reason, the half-lives of these infused drugs are said to be context-dependent. Generally, prolonged anesthetic drug infusions result in longer drug half-lives, slowed elimination from the brain and spinal cord, and delayed termination of general anesthesia.

=== Inhalational general anesthetics ===
Minimal alveolar concentration (MAC) is the concentration of an inhalational anesthetic in the lungs that prevents 50% of patients from responding to surgical incision. This value is used to compare the potencies of various inhalational general anesthetics and impacts the partial-pressure of the drug utilized by healthcare providers during general anesthesia induction and/or maintenance.

==== Induction ====

Induction of anesthesia is facilitated by diffusion of an inhaled anesthetic drug into the brain and spinal cord. Diffusion throughout the body proceeds until the drug&#x27;s partial pressure within the various tissues is equivalent to the partial pressure of the drug within the lungs. Healthcare providers can control the rate of anesthesia induction and final tissue concentrations of the anesthetic by varying the partial pressure of the inspired anesthetic. A higher drug partial pressure in the lungs will drive diffusion more rapidly throughout the body and yield a higher maximum tissue concentration. Respiratory rate and inspiratory volume will also affect the promptness of anesthesia onset, as will the extent of pulmonary blood flow.

The partition coefficient of a gaseous drug is indicative of its relative solubility in various tissues. This metric is the relative drug concentration between two tissues, when their partial pressures are equal (gas:blood, fat:blood, etc.). Inhalational anesthetics vary widely with respect to their tissue solubilities and partition coefficients. Anesthetics that are highly soluble require many molecules of drug to raise the partial pressure within a given tissue, as opposed to minimally soluble anesthetics which require relatively few. Generally, inhalational anesthetics that are minimally soluble reach equilibrium more quickly. Inhalational anesthetics that have a high fat:blood partition coefficient, however, reach equilibrium more slowly, due to the minimal vascularization of fat tissue, which serves as a large, slowly-filling reservoir for the drug.

==== Elimination ====
Inhaled anesthetics are eliminated via expiration, following diffusion into the lungs. This process is dependent largely upon the anesthetic blood:gas partition coefficient, tissue solubility, blood flow to the lungs, and patient respiratory rate and inspiratory volume. For gases that have minimal tissue solubility, termination of anesthesia generally occurs as rapidly as the onset of anesthesia. For gases that have high tissue solubility, however, termination of anesthesia is generally context-dependent. As with intravenous anesthetic infusions, prolonged delivery of highly soluble anesthetic gases generally results in longer drug half-lives, slowed elimination from the brain and spinal cord, and delayed termination of anesthesia.

Metabolism of inhaled anesthetics is generally not a major route of drug elimination.

==History==

===Ethanol===
While most research focuses on the intoxicating effects of ethanol, it can also produce a general anesthesia. Since antiquity, prior to the development of modern agents, alcohol was used as a general anaesthetic.

<text>Geoffrey Chaucer ( ; – 25 October 1400) was an English poet, author, and civil servant best known for &quot;The Canterbury Tales&quot;. He has been called the &quot;father of English literature&quot;, or, alternatively, the &quot;father of English poetry&quot;. He was the first writer to be buried in what has since come to be called Poets&#x27; Corner, in Westminster Abbey. 

Chaucer also gained fame as a philosopher and astronomer, composing the scientific &quot;A Treatise on the Astrolabe&quot; for his 10-year-old son, Lewis. He maintained a career in the civil service as a bureaucrat, courtier, diplomat, and member of parliament having been elected as shire knight for Kent.

Among Chaucer&#x27;s many other works are &quot;The Book of the Duchess&quot;, &quot;The House of Fame&quot;, &quot;The Legend of Good Women&quot;, &quot;Troilus and Criseyde&quot;, and &quot;Parlement of Foules&quot;. He is seen as crucial in legitimising the literary use of Middle English when the dominant literary languages in England were still Anglo-Norman French and Latin. Chaucer&#x27;s contemporary Thomas Hoccleve hailed him as &quot;&quot; (i.e., the first one capable of finding poetic matter in English). Almost two thousand English words are first attested in Chaucerian manuscripts.

==Life==
===Origin===
Chaucer was born in London, most likely in the early 1340s (by some accounts, including his monument, he was born in 1343), though the precise date and location remain unknown. The Chaucer family offers an extraordinary example of upward mobility. His great-grandfather was a tavern keeper, his grandfather worked as a purveyor of wines, and his father, John Chaucer, rose to become an important wine merchant with a royal appointment. Several previous generations of Geoffrey Chaucer&#x27;s family had been vintners and merchants in Ipswich. His family name is derived from the French &quot;chaucier&quot;, once thought to mean &#x27;shoemaker&#x27;, but now known to mean a maker of hose or leggings.

In 1324, his father, John Chaucer, was kidnapped by an aunt in the hope of marrying the 12-year-old to her daughter in an attempt to keep the Ipswich property in the family. The aunt was imprisoned and fined £250, now equivalent to about £, suggesting that the family was financially secure.

John Chaucer married Agnes Copton, who inherited properties in 1349, including 24 shops in London, from her uncle Hamo de Copton, who is described in a will dated 3 April 1354 and listed in the City Hustings Roll as &quot;moneyer&quot;, said to be a moneyer at the Tower of London. In the City Hustings Roll 110, 5, Ric II, dated June 1380, Chaucer refers to himself as &quot;me Galfridum Chaucer, filium Johannis Chaucer, Vinetarii, Londonie&quot;, which translates as: &quot;I, Geoffrey Chaucer, son of the vintner John Chaucer, London&quot;.

===Career===

Although records of the lives of Chaucer&#x27;s contemporaries William Langland and the Gawain Poet are practically non-existent, Chaucer was a public servant whose official life was very well documented. Nearly 500 written items testify to his career. The first of the &quot;Chaucer Life Records&quot; appears in 1357, in the household accounts of Elizabeth de Burgh, the Countess of Ulster, when he became the noblewoman&#x27;s page through his father&#x27;s connections, a common medieval form of apprenticeship for boys into knighthood or prestige appointments. The countess was married to Lionel of Antwerp, 1st Duke of Clarence, the second surviving son of the king, Edward III, and the position brought the teenage Chaucer into the close court circle, where he was to remain for the rest of his life. He also worked as a courtier, a diplomat, and a civil servant, as well as working for the king from 1389 to 1391 as Clerk of the King&#x27;s Works.

In 1359, in the early stages of the Hundred Years&#x27; War, Edward III invaded France, and Chaucer travelled with Lionel of Antwerp, Elizabeth&#x27;s husband, as part of the English army. In 1360, he was captured during the siege of Rheims. Edward paid £16 for his ransom, a considerable sum , and Chaucer was released.
After this, Chaucer&#x27;s life is uncertain, but he seems to have travelled in France, Spain, and Flanders, possibly as a messenger and perhaps even going on a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela. Around 1366, Chaucer married Philippa (de) Roet. She was a lady-in-waiting to Edward III&#x27;s queen, Philippa of Hainault, and a sister of Katherine Swynford, who later () became the third wife of John of Gaunt. It is uncertain how many children Chaucer and Philippa had, but three or four are most commonly cited. His son, Thomas Chaucer, had an illustrious career as chief butler to four kings, envoy to France, and Speaker of the House of Commons. Thomas&#x27;s daughter, Alice, married the Duke of Suffolk. Thomas&#x27;s great-grandson (Geoffrey&#x27;s great-great-grandson), John de la Pole, Earl of Lincoln, was the heir to the throne designated by Richard III before he was deposed. Geoffrey&#x27;s other children probably included Elizabeth Chaucy, a nun at Barking Abbey, Agnes, an attendant at Henry IV&#x27;s coronation; and another son, Lewis Chaucer. Chaucer&#x27;s &quot;Treatise on the Astrolabe&quot; was written for Lewis.

According to tradition, Chaucer studied law in the Inner Temple (an Inn of Court) at this time. He became a member of the royal court of Edward III as a &quot;valet de chambre&quot;, yeoman, or esquire on 20 June 1367, a position which could entail a wide variety of tasks. His wife also received a pension for court employment. He travelled abroad many times, at least some of them in his role as a valet. In 1368, he may have attended the wedding of Lionel of Antwerp to Violante Visconti, daughter of Galeazzo II Visconti, in Milan. Two other literary stars of the era were in attendance: Jean Froissart and Petrarch. Around this time, Chaucer is believed to have written &quot;The Book of the Duchess&quot; in honour of Blanche of Lancaster, the late wife of John of Gaunt, who died in 1369 of the plague.

Chaucer travelled to Picardy the next year as part of a military expedition; in 1373, he visited Genoa and Florence. Numerous scholars such as Skeat, Boitani, and Rowland have suggested that, on this Italian trip, he came into contact with Petrarch or Boccaccio. They introduced him to medieval Italian poetry, the forms and stories of which he would use later. The purposes of a voyage in 1377 are mysterious, as details within the historical record conflict. Later documents suggest it was a mission, along with Jean Froissart, to arrange a marriage between the future King Richard II and a French princess, thereby ending the Hundred Years&#x27; War. If this was the purpose of their trip, they seem to have been unsuccessful, as no wedding occurred.

In 1378, Richard II sent Chaucer as an envoy (secret dispatch) to the Visconti and Sir John Hawkwood, English condottiere (mercenary leader) in Milan. It has been speculated that it was Hawkwood on whom Chaucer based his character, the Knight, in the &quot;Canterbury Tales&quot;, for a description matches that of a 14th-century condottiere.
A possible indication that his career as a writer was appreciated came when Edward III granted Chaucer &quot;a gallon of wine daily for the rest of his life&quot; for some unspecified task. This was an unusual grant, but given on a day of celebration, St George&#x27;s Day, 1374, when artistic endeavours were traditionally rewarded, it is assumed to have been for another early poetic work. It is not known which, if any, of Chaucer&#x27;s extant works prompted the reward, but the suggestion of him as a poet to a king places him as a precursor to later poets laureate. Chaucer continued to collect the liquid stipend until Richard II came to power, after which it was converted to a monetary grant on 18 April 1378.

Chaucer obtained the very substantial job of comptroller of the customs for the port of London, which he began on 8 June 1374. He must have been suited for the role as he continued in it for twelve years, a long time in such a post at that time. His life goes undocumented for much of the next ten years, but it is believed that he wrote (or began) most of his famous works during this period. Chaucer&#x27;s &quot;only surviving handwriting&quot; dates from this period. This is a request for temporary leave from work presented to King Richard II, hitherto believed to be the work of one of his subordinates due to the low level of language.

On 16 October 1379, Thomas Staundon filed a legal action against his former servant Cecily Chaumpaigne and Chaucer, accusing Chaucer of unlawfully employing Chaumpaigne before her term of service was completed, which violated the Statute of Labourers. Though eight court documents dated between October 1379 and July 1380 survive the action, the case was never prosecuted. No details survive about Chaumpaigne&#x27;s service or how she came to leave Staundon&#x27;s employ for Chaucer&#x27;s.
While still working as comptroller, Chaucer appears to have moved to Kent, being appointed as one of the commissioners of peace for Kent at a time when French invasion was a possibility. He is thought to have started work on &quot;The Canterbury Tales&quot; in the early 1380s. He also became a member of parliament (a knight of the shire) for Kent in 1386 and attended the &#x27;Wonderful Parliament&#x27; that year. He appears to have been present at most of the 71 days it sat, for which he was paid £24 9s. On 15 October that year, he gave a deposition in the case of &quot;Scrope v. Grosvenor&quot;. There is no further reference after this date to Philippa, Chaucer&#x27;s wife. She is presumed to have died in 1387. He survived the political upheavals caused by the Lords Appellants, despite the fact that Chaucer knew some of the men executed over the affair quite well.

On 12 July 1389, Chaucer was appointed the clerk of the king&#x27;s works, a sort of foreman organising most of the king&#x27;s building projects. No major works were begun during his tenure, but he did conduct repairs on Westminster Palace, St. George&#x27;s Chapel, Windsor, continued building the wharf at the Tower of London and built the stands for a tournament held in 1390. It may have been a difficult job, but it paid two shillings a day, more than three times his salary as a comptroller. Chaucer was also appointed keeper of the lodge at the King&#x27;s Park in Feckenham Forest in Worcestershire, which was a largely honorary appointment.

===Later life===

In September 1390, records say that Chaucer was robbed and possibly injured while conducting the business, and he stopped working in this capacity on 17 June 1391. He began as Deputy Forester in the royal forest of Petherton Park in North Petherton, Somerset on 22 June. It involved administering an area which included moorland, cultivated fields, villages and a forest.

Richard II granted him an annual pension of 20 pounds in 1394 (), and Chaucer&#x27;s name fades from the historical record not long after Richard&#x27;s overthrow in 1399. The last few records of his life show his pension renewed by the new king and his taking a lease on a residence within the close of Westminster Abbey on 24 December 1399. Henry IV renewed the grants assigned by Richard, but &quot;The Complaint of Chaucer to his Purse&quot; hints that the grants might not have been paid. The last mention of Chaucer is on 5 June 1400, when some debts owed to him were repaid.

Chaucer died of unknown causes on 25 October 1400, although the only evidence for this date comes from the engraving on his tomb, which was erected more than 100 years after his death. There is some speculation that he was murdered by enemies of Richard II or even on the orders of his successor Henry IV, but the case is entirely circumstantial. Chaucer was buried in Westminster Abbey in London, as was his right owing to his status as a tenant of the Abbey&#x27;s close. In 1556, his remains were transferred to a more ornate tomb, making him the first writer interred in the area now known as Poets&#x27; Corner.

==Relationship to John of Gaunt==
Chaucer was a close friend of John of Gaunt, the wealthy Duke of Lancaster and father of Henry IV, and he served under Lancaster&#x27;s patronage. Near the end of their lives, Lancaster and Chaucer became brothers-in-law when Lancaster married Katherine Swynford (de Roet) in 1396; she was the sister of Philippa (de) Roet, whom Chaucer had married in 1366.

Chaucer&#x27;s &quot;The Book of the Duchess&quot; (also known as the &quot;Deeth of Blaunche the Duchesse&quot;) was written to commemorate Blanche of Lancaster, John of Gaunt&#x27;s first wife. The poem refers to John and Blanche in allegory as the narrator relates the tale of &quot;A long castel with walles white/Be Seynt Johan, on a ryche hil&quot; (1318–1319) who is mourning grievously after the death of his love, &quot;And goode faire White she het/That was my lady name ryght&quot; (948–949). The phrase &quot;long castel&quot; is a reference to Lancaster (also called &quot;Loncastel&quot; and &quot;Longcastell&quot;), &quot;walles white&quot; is thought to be an oblique reference to Blanche, &quot;Seynt Johan&quot; was John of Gaunt&#x27;s name-saint, and &quot;ryche hil&quot; is a reference to Richmond. These references reveal the identity of the grieving black knight of the poem as John of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster and Earl of Richmond. &quot;White&quot; is the English translation of the French word &quot;blanche&quot;, implying that the white lady was Blanche of Lancaster.

===Poem &quot;Fortune&quot;===

Chaucer&#x27;s short poem &quot;Fortune&quot;, believed to have been written in the 1390s, is also thought to refer to Lancaster. &quot;Chaucer as narrator&quot; openly defies &quot;Fortune&quot;, proclaiming that he has learned who his enemies are through her tyranny and deceit, and declares &quot;my suffisaunce&quot; (15) and that &quot;over himself hath the maystrye&quot; (14).

&quot;Fortune&quot;, in turn, does not understand Chaucer&#x27;s harsh words to her for she believes that she has been kind to him, claims that he does not know what she has in store for him in the future, but most importantly, &quot;And eek thou hast thy beste frend alyve&quot; (32, 40, 48). Chaucer retorts, &quot;My frend maystow nat reven, blind goddesse&quot; (50) and orders her to take away those who merely pretend to be his friends.

&quot;Fortune&quot; turns her attention to three princes whom she implores to relieve Chaucer of his pain and &quot;Preyeth his beste frend of his noblesse/That to som beter estat he may atteyne&quot; (78–79). The three princes are believed to represent the dukes of Lancaster, York, and Gloucester, and a portion of line 76 (&quot;as three of you or tweyne&quot;) is thought to refer to the ordinance of 1390 which specified that no royal gift could be authorised without the consent of at least two of the three dukes.

Most conspicuous in this short poem is the number of references to Chaucer&#x27;s &quot;beste frend&quot;. &quot;Fortune&quot; states three times in her response to the plaintiff, &quot;And also, you still have your best friend alive&quot; (32, 40, 48); she also refers to his &quot;beste frend&quot; in the envoy when appealing to his &quot;noblesse&quot; to help Chaucer to a higher estate. The narrator makes a fifth reference when he rails at &quot;Fortune&quot; that she shall not take his friend from him.

==Religious beliefs==
Chaucer respected and admired Christians and was one himself, as he wrote in &quot;Canterbury Tales&quot;, &quot;now I beg all those that listen to this little treatise, or read it, that if there be anything in it that pleases them, they thank our Lord Jesus Christ for it, from whom proceeds all understanding and goodness.&quot;, though he was aware that as in any place some people in the church were venal and corrupt.

==Literary works==

Chaucer&#x27;s first major work was &quot;The Book of the Duchess&quot;, an elegy for Blanche of Lancaster, who died in 1368. Two other early works were &quot;Anelida and Arcite&quot; and &quot;The House of Fame&quot;. He wrote many of his major works in a prolific period when he worked as customs comptroller for London (1374 to 1386). His &quot;Parlement of Foules&quot;, &quot;The Legend of Good Women&quot;, and &quot;Troilus and Criseyde&quot; all date from this time. It is believed that he started &quot;The Canterbury Tales&quot; in the 1380s.

Chaucer also translated Boethius&#x27; &quot;Consolation of Philosophy&quot; and &quot;The Romance of the Rose&quot; by Guillaume de Lorris (extended by Jean de Meun). Eustache Deschamps called himself a &quot;nettle in Chaucer&#x27;s garden of poetry&quot;. In 1385, Thomas Usk made glowing mention of Chaucer, and John Gower also lauded him.

Chaucer&#x27;s &quot;Treatise on the Astrolabe&quot; describes the form and use of the astrolabe in detail and is sometimes cited as the first example of technical writing in the English language. It indicates that Chaucer was versed in science in addition to his literary talents. &quot;The equatorie of the planetis&quot; is a scientific work similar to the &quot;Treatise&quot; and sometimes ascribed to Chaucer because of its language and handwriting, an identification which scholars no longer deem tenable.

==Influence==
===Linguistic===

Chaucer wrote in continental accentual-syllabic metre, a style which had developed in English literature since around the 12th century as an alternative to the alliterative Anglo-Saxon metre. Chaucer is known for metrical innovation, inventing the rhyme royal, and he was one of the first English poets to use the five-stress line, a decasyllabic cousin to the iambic pentametre, in his work, with only a few anonymous short works using it before him. The arrangement of these five-stress lines into rhyming couplets, first seen in his &quot;The Legend of Good Women&quot;, was used in much of his later work and became one of the standard poetic forms in English. His early influence as a satirist is also important, with the common humorous device, the funny accent of a regional dialect, appearing in &quot;The Reeve&#x27;s Tale&quot;. Regarded by historians as the first use of dialect for comedy in English literature, J. R. R. Tolkien also claimed it as &quot;dramatic realism&quot;.

The poetry of Chaucer, along with other writers of the era, is credited with helping to standardise the London Dialect of the Middle English language from a combination of the Kentish and Midlands dialects. This is probably overstated; the influence of the court, chancery and bureaucracy – of which Chaucer was a part – remains a more probable influence on the development of Standard English.

Modern English is somewhat distanced from the language of Chaucer&#x27;s poems owing to the effect of the Great Vowel Shift sometime after his death. This change in the pronunciation of English, still not fully understood, makes the reading of Chaucer difficult for the modern audience.

The status of the final &quot;-e&quot; in Chaucer&#x27;s verse is uncertain: it seems likely that during the period of Chaucer&#x27;s writing, the final &quot;-e&quot; was dropping out of colloquial English and that its use was somewhat irregular. It may have been a vestige of the Old English dative singular suffix &quot;-e&quot; attached to most nouns. Chaucer&#x27;s versification suggests that the final &quot;-e&quot; is sometimes to be vocalised and sometimes to be silent; however, this remains a point on which there is disagreement. Most scholars pronounce it as a schwa when it is vocalised.

Besides the irregular spelling, much of the vocabulary is recognisable to the modern reader. Chaucer is also recorded in the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; as the first author to use many common English words in his writings. These words were probably frequently used in the language at the time, but Chaucer was the earliest extant manuscript source with his ear for common speech. &quot;Acceptable&quot;, &quot;alkali&quot;, &quot;altercation&quot;, &quot;amble&quot;, &quot;angrily&quot;, &quot;annex&quot;, &quot;annoyance&quot;, &quot;approaching&quot;, &quot;arbitration&quot;, &quot;armless&quot;, &quot;army&quot;, &quot;arrogant&quot;, &quot;arsenic&quot;, &quot;arc&quot;, &quot;artillery&quot; and &quot;aspect&quot; are just some of almost two thousand English words first attested in Chaucer.

===Literary===

Widespread knowledge of Chaucer&#x27;s works is attested by the many poets who imitated or responded to his writing. John Lydgate was one of the earliest poets to write continuations of Chaucer&#x27;s unfinished &quot;Tales&quot;. At the same time Robert Henryson&#x27;s &quot;The Testament of Cresseid&quot; completes the story of Cressida left unfinished in his &quot;Troilus and Criseyde&quot;. Many of the manuscripts of Chaucer&#x27;s works contain material from these poets, and later appreciations by the Romantic era poets were shaped by their failure to distinguish the later &quot;additions&quot; from the original Chaucer.

Writers of the 17th and 18th centuries, such as John Dryden, admired Chaucer for his stories but not for his rhythm and rhyme, as few critics could then read Middle English and the text had been butchered by printers, leaving a somewhat unadmirable mess. It was not until the late 19th century that the official Chaucerian canon, accepted today, was decided upon, largely as a result of Walter William Skeat&#x27;s work. Roughly seventy-five years after Chaucer&#x27;s death, &quot;The Canterbury Tales&quot; was selected by William Caxton as one of the first books to be printed in England.

===English===

Chaucer is often considered the source of the English vernacular tradition, with the writer championing the English language over the then prevalent use of Latin or French in England in poetry and the law. His achievement for the language can be seen as part of a general historical trend towards the creation of a vernacular literature, after the example of Dante, in many parts of Europe. A parallel trend in Chaucer&#x27;s lifetime was underway in Scotland through the work of his slightly earlier contemporary, John Barbour. Barbour&#x27;s work was likely to have been even more general, as is evidenced by the example of the Pearl Poet in the north of England.

Although Chaucer&#x27;s language is much closer to Modern English than the text of &quot;Beowulf&quot;, such that (unlike that of &quot;Beowulf&quot;) a Modern English speaker with an extensive vocabulary of archaic words may understand it, it differs enough that most publications modernise his idiom. The following is a sample from the prologue of &quot;The Summoner&#x27;s Tale&quot; that compares Chaucer&#x27;s text to a modern translation:

===Valentine&#x27;s Day and romance===
The first recorded association of Valentine&#x27;s Day with romantic love is believed to be in Chaucer&#x27;s &quot;Parlement of Foules&quot; (1382), a dream vision portraying a parliament for birds to choose their mates. Honouring the first anniversary of the engagement of fifteen-year-old King Richard II of England to fifteen-year-old Anne of Bohemia:

For this was on seynt Volantynys dayWhan euery bryd comyth there to chese his makeOf euery kynde that men thinke mayAnd that so heuge a noyse gan they makeThat erthe &amp; eyr &amp; tre &amp; euery lakeSo ful was that onethe was there spaceFor me to stonde, so ful was al the place.

==Critical reception==
===Early criticism===

The poet Thomas Hoccleve, who may have met Chaucer and considered him his role model, hailed Chaucer as &quot;the firste fyndere of our fair langage&quot;. John Lydgate referred to Chaucer within his own text &quot;The Fall of Princes&quot; as the &quot;lodesterre (guiding principle) … off our language&quot;. Around two centuries later, Sir Philip Sidney greatly praised &quot;Troilus and Criseyde&quot; in his own &quot;Defence of Poesie&quot;. During the nineteenth and early twentieth century, Chaucer came to be viewed as a symbol of the nation&#x27;s poetic heritage.

In Charles Dickens&#x27; 1850 novel &quot;David Copperfield&quot;, the Victorian era author echoed Chaucer&#x27;s use of Luke 23:34 from &quot;Troilus and Criseyde&quot; (Dickens held a copy in his library among other works of Chaucer), with G. K. Chesterton writing, &quot;among the great canonical English authors, Chaucer and Dickens have the most in common.&quot;

===Manuscripts and audience===
The large number of surviving manuscripts of Chaucer&#x27;s works is testimony to the enduring interest in his poetry prior to the arrival of the printing press. There are 83 surviving manuscripts of the Canterbury Tales (in whole or part) alone, along with sixteen of &quot;Troilus and Criseyde&quot;, including the personal copy of Henry IV. Given the ravages of time, it is likely that these surviving manuscripts represent hundreds since lost.

Chaucer&#x27;s original audience was a courtly one and would have included women as well as men of the upper social classes. Yet even before his death in 1400, Chaucer&#x27;s audience had begun to include members of the rising literate, middle and merchant classes. This included many Lollard sympathisers who may well have been inclined to read Chaucer as one of their own.

Lollards were particularly attracted to Chaucer&#x27;s satirical writings about friars, priests, and other church officials. In 1464, John Baron, a tenant farmer in Agmondesham (Amersham in Buckinghamshire), was brought before John Chadworth, the Bishop of Lincoln, on charges of being a Lollard heretic; he confessed to owning a &quot;boke of the Tales of Caunterburie&quot; among other suspect volumes.

===Printed editions===

The first English printer, William Caxton, was responsible for the first two folio editions of &quot;The Canterbury Tales&quot; published in 1478 and 1483. Caxton&#x27;s second printing, by his own account, came about because a customer complained that the printed text differed from a manuscript he knew; Caxton obligingly used the man&#x27;s manuscript as his source. Both Caxton editions carry the equivalent of manuscript authority. Caxton&#x27;s edition was reprinted by his successor, Wynkyn de Worde, but this edition has no independent authority.
Richard Pynson, the King&#x27;s Printer under Henry VIII for about twenty years, was the first to collect and sell something that resembled an edition of the collected works of Chaucer; however, in the process, he introduced five previously printed texts that are now known not to be Chaucer&#x27;s. (The collection is actually three separately printed texts, or collections of texts, bound together as one volume.)

There is a likely connection between Pynson&#x27;s product and William Thynne&#x27;s a mere six years later. Thynne had a successful career from the 1520s until his death in 1546 as chief clerk of the kitchen of Henry VIII, one of the masters of the royal household. He spent years comparing various versions of Chaucer&#x27;s works and selected 41 pieces for publication. While there were questions over the authorship of some of the material, there is no doubt that this was the first comprehensive view of Chaucer&#x27;s work. &quot;The Workes of Geffray Chaucer,&quot; published in 1532, was the first edition of Chaucer&#x27;s collected works. Thynne&#x27;s editions of &quot;Chaucer&#x27;s Works&quot; in 1532 and 1542 were the first significant contributions to the existence of a widely recognised Chaucerian canon. Thynne represents his edition as a book sponsored by and supportive of the king, who is praised in the preface by Sir Brian Tuke. Thynne&#x27;s canon brought the number of apocryphal works associated with Chaucer to a total of 28, even if that was not his intention. As with Pynson, once included in the &quot;Works&quot;, pseudepigraphic texts stayed with those works, regardless of their first editor&#x27;s intentions.
In the 16th and 17th centuries, Chaucer was printed more than any other English author, and he was the first author to have his works collected in comprehensive single-volume editions in which a Chaucer canon began to cohere. Some scholars contend that 16th-century editions of Chaucer&#x27;s &quot;Works&quot; set the precedent for all other English authors regarding presentation, prestige and success in print. These editions certainly established Chaucer&#x27;s reputation, but they also began the complicated process of reconstructing and frequently inventing Chaucer&#x27;s biography and the canonical list of works which were attributed to him.

Probably the most significant aspect of the growing apocrypha is that beginning with Thynne&#x27;s editions, it began to include medieval texts that made Chaucer appear as a proto-Protestant Lollard, primarily the &quot;Testament of Love&quot; and &quot;The Plowman&#x27;s Tale&quot;. As &quot;Chaucerian&quot; works that were not considered apocryphal until the late 19th century, these medieval texts enjoyed a new life, with English Protestants carrying on the earlier Lollard project of appropriating existing texts and authors who seemed sympathetic—or malleable enough to be construed as sympathetic—to their cause. The official Chaucer of the early printed volumes of his &quot;Works&quot; was construed as a proto-Protestant as the same was done concurrently with William Langland and &quot;Piers Plowman&quot;.

The famous &quot;Plowman&#x27;s Tale&quot; did not enter Thynne&#x27;s &quot;Works&quot; until the second 1542 edition. Its entry was surely facilitated by Thynne&#x27;s inclusion of Thomas Usk&#x27;s &quot;Testament of Love&quot; in the first edition. The &quot;Testament of Love&quot; imitates, borrows from, and thus resembles Usk&#x27;s contemporary, Chaucer. (&quot;Testament of Love&quot; also appears to borrow from &quot;Piers Plowman&quot;.)

Since the &quot;Testament of Love&quot; mentions its author&#x27;s part in a failed plot (book 1, chapter 6), his imprisonment, and (perhaps) a recantation of (possibly Lollardism) heresy, all this was associated with Chaucer. (Usk himself was executed as a traitor in 1388.) John Foxe took this recantation of heresy as a defence of the true faith, calling Chaucer a &quot;right Wiclevian&quot; and (erroneously) identifying him as a schoolmate and close friend of John Wycliffe at Merton College, Oxford. (Thomas Speght is careful to highlight these facts in his editions and his &quot;Life of Chaucer&quot;.) No other sources for the &quot;Testament of Love&quot; exist—there is only Thynne&#x27;s construction of whatever manuscript sources he had.

John Stow (1525–1605) was an antiquarian and also a chronicler. His edition of Chaucer&#x27;s &quot;Works&quot; in 1561 brought the apocrypha to more than 50 titles. More were added in the 17th century, and they remained as late as 1810, well after Thomas Tyrwhitt pared the canon down in his 1775 edition. The compilation and printing of Chaucer&#x27;s works was, from its beginning, a political enterprise, since it was intended to establish an English national identity and history that grounded and authorised the Tudor monarchy and church. What was added to Chaucer often helped represent him favourably to Protestant England.

In his 1598 edition of the &quot;Works&quot;, Speght (probably taking cues from Foxe) made good use of Usk&#x27;s account of his political intrigue and imprisonment in the &quot;Testament of Love&quot; to assemble a largely fictional &quot;Life of Our Learned English Poet, Geffrey Chaucer&quot;. Speght&#x27;s &quot;Life&quot; presents readers with an erstwhile radical in troubled times much like their own, a proto-Protestant who eventually came round to the king&#x27;s views on religion. Speght states, &quot;In the second year of Richard the second, the King tooke Geffrey Chaucer and his lands into his protection. The occasion wherof no doubt was some daunger and trouble whereinto he was fallen by favouring some rash attempt of the common people.&quot; Under the discussion of Chaucer&#x27;s friends, namely John of Gaunt, Speght further explains:

::Yet it seemeth that [Chaucer] was in some trouble in the daies of King Richard the second, as it may appeare in the Testament of Loue: where hee doth greatly complaine of his owne rashnesse in following the multitude, and of their hatred against him for bewraying their purpose. And in that complaint which he maketh to his empty purse, I do find a written copy, which I had of Iohn Stow (whose library hath helped many writers) wherein ten times more is adioined, then is in print. Where he maketh great lamentation for his wrongfull imprisonment, wishing death to end his daies: which in my iudgement doth greatly accord with that in the Testament of Loue. Moreouer we find it thus in Record.

Later, in &quot;The Argument&quot; to the &quot;Testament of Love&quot;, Speght adds:
::Chaucer did compile this booke as a comfort to himselfe after great griefs conceiued for some rash attempts of the commons, with whome he had ioyned, and thereby was in feare to loose the fauour of his best friends.

Speght is also the source of the famous tale of Chaucer being fined for beating a Franciscan friar in Fleet Street, as well as a fictitious coat of arms and family tree. Ironically – and perhaps consciously so – an introductory, apologetic letter in Speght&#x27;s edition from Francis Beaumont defends the unseemly, &quot;low&quot;, and bawdy bits in Chaucer from an elite, classicist position.

Francis Thynne noted some of these inconsistencies in his &quot;Animadversions&quot;, insisting that Chaucer was not a commoner, and he objected to the friar-beating story. Yet Thynne himself underscores Chaucer&#x27;s support for popular religious reform, associating Chaucer&#x27;s views with his father William Thynne&#x27;s attempts to include &quot;The Plowman&#x27;s Tale&quot; and &quot;The Pilgrim&#x27;s Tale&quot; in the 1532 and 1542 &quot;Works&quot;.

The myth of the Protestant Chaucer continues to have a lasting impact on a large body of Chaucerian scholarship. Though it is extremely rare for a modern scholar to suggest Chaucer supported a religious movement that did not exist until more than a century after his death, the predominance of this thinking for so many centuries left it for granted that Chaucer was at least hostile toward Catholicism. This assumption forms a large part of many critical approaches to Chaucer&#x27;s works, including neo-Marxism.

Alongside Chaucer&#x27;s &quot;Works&quot;, the most impressive literary monument of the period is John Foxe&#x27;s &quot;Acts and Monuments...&quot;. As with the Chaucer editions, it was critically significant to English Protestant identity and included Chaucer in its project. Foxe&#x27;s Chaucer both derived from and contributed to the printed editions of Chaucer&#x27;s &quot;Works&quot;, particularly the pseudepigrapha. &quot;Jack Upland&quot; was first printed in Foxe&#x27;s &quot;Acts and Monuments&quot;, and then it appeared in Speght&#x27;s edition of Chaucer&#x27;s &quot;Works&quot;.

Speght&#x27;s &quot;Life of Chaucer&quot; echoes Foxe&#x27;s own account, which is itself dependent upon the earlier editions that added the &quot;Testament of Love&quot; and &quot;The Plowman&#x27;s Tale&quot; to their pages. Like Speght&#x27;s Chaucer, Foxe&#x27;s Chaucer was also a shrewd (or lucky) political survivor. In his 1563 edition, Foxe &quot;thought it not out of season … to couple … some mention of Geoffrey Chaucer&quot; with a discussion of John Colet, a possible source for John Skelton&#x27;s character Colin Clout.

Probably referring to the 1542 Act for the Advancement of True Religion, Foxe said that he &quot;marvel[s] to consider … how the bishops, condemning and abolishing all manner of English books and treatises which might bring the people to any light of knowledge, did yet authorise the works of Chaucer to remain still and to be occupied; who, no doubt, saw into religion as much almost as even we do now, and uttereth in his works no less, and seemeth to be a right Wicklevian, or else there never was any. And that, all his works almost, if they be thoroughly advised, will testify (albeit done in mirth, and covertly); and especially the latter end of his third book of the Testament of Love … Wherein, except a man be altogether blind, he may espy him at the full: although in the same book (as in all others he useth to do), under shadows covertly, as under a visor, he suborneth truth in such sort, as both privily she may profit the godly-minded, and yet not be espied of the crafty adversary. And therefore the bishops, belike, taking his works but for jests and toys, in condemning other books, yet permitted his books to be read.&quot;
It is significant, too, that Foxe&#x27;s discussion of Chaucer leads into his history of &quot;The Reformation of the Church of Christ in the Time of Martin Luther&quot; when &quot;Printing, being opened, incontinently ministered unto the church the instruments and tools of learning and knowledge; which were good books and authors, which before lay hid and unknown. The science of printing being found, immediately followed the grace of God; which stirred up good wits aptly to conceive the light of knowledge and judgment: by which light darkness began to be espied, and ignorance to be detected; truth from error, religion from superstition, to be discerned.&quot;

Foxe downplays Chaucer&#x27;s bawdy and amorous writing, insisting that it all testifies to his piety. Troubling material is deemed metaphoric, while the more forthright satire (which Foxe prefers) is taken literally.

John Urry produced the first edition of the complete works of Chaucer in a Latin font, published posthumously in 1721. According to the editors, several tales were printed, and for the first time, a biography of Chaucer, a glossary of old English words, and testimonials of author writers concerning Chaucer dating back to the 16th century. According to A. S. G Edwards, &quot;This was the first collected edition of Chaucer to be printed in Roman type. The life of Chaucer prefixed to the volume was the work of the Reverend John Dart, corrected and revised by Timothy Thomas. The glossary appended was also mainly compiled by Thomas. The text of Urry&#x27;s edition has often been criticised by subsequent editors for its frequent conjectural emendations, mainly to make it conform to his sense of Chaucer&#x27;s metre. The justice of such criticisms should not obscure his achievement. His is the first edition of Chaucer in nearly a hundred and fifty years to consult any manuscripts. Additionally, it is the first since that of William Thynne in 1534 to seek systematically to assemble a substantial number of manuscripts to establish his text. It is also the first edition to offer descriptions of the manuscripts of Chaucer&#x27;s works, and the first to print texts of &#x27;Gamelyn&#x27; and &#x27;The Tale of Beryn&#x27;, works ascribed to, but not by, Chaucer.&quot;

===Modern scholarship===

Although Chaucer&#x27;s works had long been admired, serious scholarly work on his legacy did not begin until the late 18th century, when Thomas Tyrwhitt edited &quot;The Canterbury Tales&quot;, and it did not become an established academic discipline until the 19th century.

Scholars such as Frederick James Furnivall, who founded the Chaucer Society in 1868, pioneered the establishment of diplomatic editions of Chaucer&#x27;s primary texts, along with careful accounts of Chaucer&#x27;s language and prosody. Walter William Skeat, who, like Furnivall, was closely associated with the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot;, established the base text of all of Chaucer&#x27;s works with his edition, published by Oxford University Press. Later editions by John H. Fisher and Larry D. Benson offered further refinements, along with critical commentary and bibliographies.

With the textual issues largely addressed, if not resolved, attention turned to the questions of Chaucer&#x27;s themes, structure, and audience. The Chaucer Research Project at the University of Chicago began in 1924. The &quot;Chaucer Review&quot; was founded in 1966 and has maintained its position as the pre-eminent journal of Chaucer studies. In 1994, literary critic Harold Bloom placed Chaucer among the greatest Western writers of all time, and in 1997 expounded on William Shakespeare&#x27;s debt to the author.

==List of works==
The following major works are in roughly chronological order, but scholars still debate the dating of most of Chaucer&#x27;s output. Works made up of a collection of stories may have been compiled over a long period.

===Major works===

===Poems of doubtful authorship===
*&quot;Against Women Unconstant&quot;
*&quot;A Balade of Complaint&quot;
*&quot;Complaynt D&#x27;Amours&quot;
*&quot;Merciles Beaute&quot;
*&quot;The Equatorie of the Planets&quot; – A rough translation of a Latin work derived from an Arab work of the same title. It is a description of the construction and use of a planetary equatorium, which was used in calculating planetary orbits and positions (at the time, it was believed the sun orbited the Earth). The similar &quot;Treatise on the Astrolabe&quot;, not usually doubted as Chaucer&#x27;s work, in addition to Chaucer&#x27;s name as a gloss to the manuscript, are the main pieces of evidence for the ascription to Chaucer. However, the evidence Chaucer wrote such a work is questionable and, thus, is not included in &quot;The Riverside Chaucer&quot;. If Chaucer had not composed this work, it would have probably been written by a contemporary.

===Works presumed lost===
*&quot;Of the Wreched Engendrynge of Mankynde&quot;, possible translation of Innocent III&#x27;s &quot;De miseria conditionis humanae&quot;
*&quot;Origenes upon the Maudeleyne&quot;
*&quot;The Book of the Leoun&quot; – &quot;The Book of the Lion&quot; is mentioned in Chaucer&#x27;s retraction. It has been speculated that it may have been a redaction of Guillaume de Machaut&#x27;s &#x27;Dit dou lyon,&#x27; a story about courtly love (a subject about which Chaucer frequently wrote).

===Spurious works===
*&quot;The Pilgrim&#x27;s Tale&quot; – written in the 16th century with many Chaucerian allusions
*&quot;The Plowman&#x27;s Tale&quot; or &quot;The Complaint of the Ploughman&quot; – a Lollard satire later appropriated as a Protestant text
*&quot;Pierce the Ploughman&#x27;s Crede&quot; – a Lollard satire later appropriated by Protestants
*&quot;The Ploughman&#x27;s Tale&quot; – its body is largely a version of Thomas Hoccleve&#x27;s &quot;Item de Beata Virgine&quot;
*&quot;La Belle Dame Sans Merci&quot; – frequently attributed to Chaucer, but is a translation by Richard Roos of Alain Chartier&#x27;s poem
*&quot;The Testament of Love&quot; – actually by Thomas Usk
*&quot;Jack Upland&quot; – a Lollard satire
*&quot;The Floure and the Leafe&quot; – a 15th-century allegory

===Derived works===
*&quot;God Spede the Plough&quot; – Borrows twelve stanzas of Chaucer&#x27;s &quot;Monk&#x27;s Tale&quot;

==In popular culture==
Chaucer is one of the main characters in the 2001 film &quot;A Knight&#x27;s Tale&quot;, and is portrayed by Paul Bettany.

<text>Gerald Brosseau Gardner (13 June 1884 – 12 February 1964), also known by the craft name Scire, was an English Wiccan, author, and amateur anthropologist and archaeologist. He was instrumental in bringing the modern pagan religion of Wicca to public attention, writing some of its definitive religious texts and founding the tradition of Gardnerian Wicca.

Born into an upper-middle-class family in Blundellsands, Lancashire, Gardner spent much of his childhood abroad in Madeira. In 1900, he moved to colonial Ceylon. In 1911, he relocated to Malaya, where he worked as a civil servant. Independently, he developed an interest in the native peoples, writing papers, and even a book about their magical practices.

After his retirement in 1936, he travelled to Cyprus and penned the novel &quot;A Goddess Arrives&quot; before returning to England. Settling down near the New Forest, he joined an occult group, the Rosicrucian Order Crotona Fellowship. Through this group, he encountered the New Forest coven into which he was initiated in 1939. Gardner portrayed the coven as a survival of the theoretical &quot;witch-cult&quot; discussed in the works of Margaret Murraya theory that is now discredited. He supplemented the coven&#x27;s rituals with ideas borrowed from Freemasonry, ceremonial magic, and the writings of Aleister Crowley to form the Gardnerian tradition of Wicca.

Moving to London in 1945, he became intent on propagating this religion, attracting media attention and writing about it in &quot;High Magic&#x27;s Aid&quot; (1949), &quot;Witchcraft Today&quot; (1954), and &quot;The Meaning of Witchcraft&quot; (1959). Founding a Wiccan group known as the Bricket Wood coven, he introduced a string of High Priestesses into the religion, including Doreen Valiente, Lois Bourne, Patricia Crowther and Eleanor Bone, through which the Gardnerian community spread throughout Britain and subsequently into Australia and the United States in the late 1950s and early 1960s. Involved for a time with Cecil Williamson, Gardner also became director of the Museum of Magic and Witchcraft on the Isle of Man, which he ran until his death. Gardner&#x27;s role in the development of neo-pagan and occult communities was such that a plaque on his gravestone describes him &quot;The Father of Wicca&quot;.

==Early life==

===Childhood: 1884–1899===
Gardner&#x27;s family was wealthy and upper middle class, running a family firm, Joseph Gardner and Sons, which described itself as &quot;the oldest private company in the timber trade within the British Empire.&quot; Specialising in the import of hardwood, the company had been founded in the mid-18th century by Edmund Gardner (b. 1721), an entrepreneur who would subsequently become a Freeman of Liverpool.

Gerald&#x27;s father, William Robert Gardner (1844–1935) had been the youngest son of Joseph Gardner (b. 1791), after whom the firm had been renamed, and who with his wife Maria had had five sons and three daughters. In 1867, William had been sent to New York City to further the interests of the family firm. Here, he had met an American, Louise Burguelew Ennis, the daughter of a wholesale stationer; entering a relationship, they were married in Manhattan on 25 November 1868.

After a visit to England, the couple returned to the US, where they settled in Mott Haven, Morrisania in New York State. It was here that their first child, Harold Ennis Gardner, was born in 1870. At some point in the next two years they moved back to England, by 1873 settling into The Glen, a large Victorian house in Blundellsands in Lancashire, north-west England, which was developing into a wealthy suburb of Liverpool. It was here that their second child, Robert &quot;Bob&quot; Marshall Gardner, was born in 1874.
In 1876 the family moved into one of the neighbouring houses, Ingle Lodge, and it was here that the couple&#x27;s third son, Gerald Brosseau Gardner, was born on Friday 13 June 1884. A fourth child, Francis Douglas Gardner, was then born in 1886. Gerald would rarely see Harold, who went on to study law at the University of Oxford, but saw more of Bob, who drew pictures for him, and Douglas, with whom he shared his nursery.

The Gardners employed an Irish nursemaid named Josephine &quot;Com&quot; McCombie, who was entrusted with taking care of the young Gerald; she would subsequently become the dominant figure of his childhood, spending far more time with him than his parents. Gardner suffered with asthma from a young age, having particular difficulty in the cold Lancashire winters. His nursemaid offered to take him to warmer climates abroad at his father&#x27;s expense in the hope that this condition would not be so badly affected.

Subsequently, in summer 1888, Gerald and Com travelled via London to Nice in the south of France. After several more years spent in the Mediterranean, in 1891 they went to the Canary Islands, and it was here that Gardner first developed his lifelong interest in weaponry. From there, they then went on to Accra in the Gold Coast (modern Ghana). Accra was followed by a visit to Funchal on the Portuguese island of Madeira; they would spend most of the next nine years on the island, only returning to England for three or four months in the summer.

According to Gardner&#x27;s first biographer, Jack Bracelin, Com was very flirtatious and &quot;clearly looked on these trips as mainly manhunts&quot;, viewing Gardner as a nuisance. As a result, he was largely left to his own devices, which he spent going out, meeting new people and learning about foreign cultures. In Madeira, he also began collecting weapons, many of which were remnants from the Napoleonic Wars, displaying them on the wall of his hotel room.

As a result of his illness and these foreign trips, Gardner ultimately never attended school, or gained any formal education. He taught himself to read by looking at copies of &quot;The Strand Magazine&quot; but his writing betrayed his lack of formal schooling with eccentric spelling and grammar. A voracious reader, one of the books that most influenced him at the time was Florence Marryat&#x27;s &quot;There Is No Death&quot; (1891), a discussion of spiritualism, and from which he gained a firm belief in the existence of an afterlife.

===Ceylon and Borneo: 1900–1911===
In 1900, Com married David Elkington, one of her many suitors who owned a tea plantation in the British colony of Ceylon (modern Sri Lanka). It was agreed with the Gardners that Gerald would live with her on a tea plantation named Ladbroke Estate in the town of Maskeliya, where he could learn the tea trade. In 1901 Gardner and the Elkingtons lived briefly in a bungalow in Kandy, where a neighbouring bungalow had just been vacated by the occultists Aleister Crowley and Charles Henry Allan Bennett.

At his father&#x27;s expense, Gardner trained as a &quot;creeper&quot;, or trainee planter, learning all about the growing of tea; although he disliked the &quot;dreary endlessness&quot; of the work, he enjoyed being outdoors and near to the forests. He lived with the Elkingtons until 1904, when he moved into his own bungalow and began earning a living working on the Non Pareil tea estate below the Horton Plains. He spent much of his spare time hunting deer and trekking through the local forests, becoming acquainted with the Singhalese natives and taking a great interest in their Buddhist beliefs.

In December 1904, his parents and younger brother visited, with his father asking him to invest in a pioneering rubber plantation which Gardner was to manage; located near the village of Belihuloya, it was known as the Atlanta Estate, but allowed him a great deal of leisure time. Exploring his interest in weaponry, in 1907 Gardner joined the Ceylon Planters Rifle Corps, a local volunteer force composed of European tea and rubber planters intent on protecting their interests from foreign aggression or domestic insurrection.

In 1907 Gardner returned to Britain for several months&#x27; leave, spending time with his family and joining the Legion of Frontiersmen, a militia founded to repel the threat of German invasion. During his visit, Gardner spent time with family relations, the Sergenesons; Gardner became friendly with this side of his family, whom his Anglican parents avoided because they were Methodists.

According to Gardner, the Surgenesons talked about the paranormal with him; the patriarch of the family, Ted Surgeneson, believed that fairies were living in his garden and would say &quot;I can often feel they&#x27;re there, and sometimes I&#x27;ve seen them&quot;, though he readily admitted the possibility that it was all in his imagination. It was from the Sergenesons that Gardner discovered a family rumour that his grandfather, Joseph, had been a practising witch, after being converted to the practice by his mistress. Another unconfirmed family belief repeated by Gardner was that a Scottish ancestor, Grissell Gairdner, had been burned as a witch in Newburgh in 1610.
Gardner returned to Ceylon in late 1907 and settled down to the routine of managing the rubber plantation. In 1910 he was initiated as an Apprentice Freemason into the Sphinx Lodge No. 107 in Colombo, affiliated with the Irish Grand Lodge. Gardner placed great importance on this new activity; In order to attend masonic meetings, he had to arrange a weekend&#x27;s leave, walk 15 miles to the nearest railway station in Haputale, and then catch a train to the city.

He entered into the second and third degrees of Freemasonry within the next month, but this enthusiasm seems also to have waned, and he resigned the next year, probably because he intended to leave Ceylon. The experiment with rubber growing at the Atlanta Estate had proved relatively unsuccessful, and Gardner&#x27;s father decided to sell the property in 1911, leaving Gerald unemployed.

That year, Gardner moved to British North Borneo, gaining employment as a rubber planter at the Mawo Estate at Membuket. However, he did not get on well with the plantation&#x27;s manager, a racist named R. J. Graham who had wanted to deforest the entire local area. Instead, Gardner became friendly with many of the locals, including the Dayak and Dusun people.

An amateur anthropologist, Gardner was fascinated by the indigenous way of life, particularly the local forms of weaponry such as the &quot;sumpitan&quot;. He was intrigued by the tattoos of the Dayaks and pictures of him in later life show large snake or dragon tattoos on his forearms, presumably obtained at this time. Taking a great interest in indigenous religious beliefs, Gardner told his first biographer that he had attended Dusun séances or healing rituals.

He was unhappy with the working conditions and the racist attitudes of his colleagues, and when he developed malaria he felt that this was the last straw; he left Borneo and moved to Singapore, in what was then known as the Straits Settlements, part of British Malaya.

===Malaya and World War I: 1911–1926===
Arriving in Singapore, he initially planned to return to Ceylon, but was offered a job working as an assistant on a rubber plantation in Perak, northern Malaya, and decided to take it, working for the Borneo Company. Arriving in the area, he decided to supplement this income by purchasing his own estate, Bukit Katho, on which he could grow rubber; initially sized at 450 acres, Gardner purchased various pieces of adjacent land until it covered 600 acres.

Here, Gardner made friends with an American man known as Cornwall, who had converted to Islam and married a local Malay woman. Through Cornwall, Gardner was introduced to many locals, whom he soon befriended, including members of the Senoi and Malay peoples. Cornwall invited Gardner to make the &quot;Shahada&quot;, the Muslim confession of faith, which he did; it allowed him to gain the trust of locals, although he would never become a practising Muslim. Cornwall was however an unorthodox Muslim, and his interest in local peoples included their magical and spiritual beliefs, to which he also introduced Gardner, who took a particular interest in the &quot;kris&quot;, a ritual knife with magical uses.

In 1915, Gardner again joined a local volunteer militia, the Malay States Volunteer Rifles. Although between 1914 and 1918 World War I was raging in Europe, its effects were little felt in Malaya, apart from the 1915 Singapore Mutiny. Gardner was keen to do more towards the war effort and in 1916 once again returned to Britain. He attempted to join the Royal Navy but was turned down due to ill health. Unable to fight on the front lines, he began working as an orderly in the Voluntary Aid Detachment (VAD) in the First Western General Hospital, Fazakerley, located on the outskirts of Liverpool.

He was working in the VAD when casualties came back from the Battle of the Somme and he was engaged in looking after patients and assisting in changing wound dressings. He soon had to give this up when his malaria returned, and so decided to return to Malaya in October 1916 because of the warmer climate.

He continued to manage the rubber plantation but after the end of the war, commodity prices dropped and by 1921 it was difficult to make a profit. He returned again to Britain, in what later biographer Philip Heselton speculated might have been an unsuccessful attempt to ask his father for money. Returning to Malaya, Gardner found that the Borneo Company had sacked him, and he was forced to find work with the Public Works Department. In September 1923 he successfully applied to the Office of Customs to become a government-inspector of rubber plantations, a job that involved a great amount of travelling around the country, something he enjoyed.

After a brief but serious illness, the Johore government reassigned Gardner to an office in the Lands Office while he recovered, eventually being promoted to Principal Officer of Customs. In this capacity, he was made an Inspector of Rubber Shops, overseeing the regulation and sale of rubber in the country. In 1926 he was placed in charge of monitoring shops selling opium, noting regular irregularities and a thriving illegal trade in the controlled substance; believing opium to be essentially harmless, there is evidence indicating that Gardner probably took many bribes in this position, earning himself a small fortune.

===Marriage and archaeology: 1927–1936===
Gardner&#x27;s mother had died in 1920, but he had not returned to Britain on that occasion. However, in 1927 his father became very ill with dementia, and Gardner decided to visit him. On his return to Britain, Gardner began to investigate spiritualism and mediumship. He soon had several encounters which he attributed to spirits of deceased family members.

Continuing to visit Spiritualist churches and séances, he was highly critical of much of what he saw, although he encountered several mediums he considered genuine. One medium apparently made contact with a deceased cousin of Gardner&#x27;s, an event which impressed him greatly. His first biographer Jack Bracelin reports that this was a watershed in Gardner&#x27;s life, and that a previous academic interest in spiritualism and life after death thereafter became a matter of firm personal belief for him.

The very same evening (28 July 1927) after Gardner had met this medium, he met the woman he was to marry; Dorothea Frances Rosedale, known as Donna, a relation of his sister-in-law Edith. He asked her to marry him the next day and she agreed. Because his leave was coming to an end very soon, they married quickly on 16 August at St Jude&#x27;s Church, Kensington, and then honeymooned in Ryde on the Isle of Wight, before heading via France to Malaya.

Arriving in the country, the couple settled into a bungalow at Bukit Japon in Johor Bahru. Here, he once more became involved in Freemasonry, joining the Johore Royal Lodge No. 3946, but had retired from it by April 1931. Gardner also returned to his old interests in the anthropology of Malaya, witnessing the magical practices performed by the locals, and he readily accepted a belief in magic. During his time in Malaya, Gardner became increasingly interested in local customs, particularly those involved in folk magic and weapons.

Gardner was not only interested in the anthropology of Malaya, but also in its archaeology. He began excavations at the city of Johore Lama, alone and in secret, as the local Sultan considered archaeologists little better than grave-robbers. Prior to Gardner&#x27;s investigations, no serious archaeological excavation had occurred at the city, though he himself soon unearthed four miles of earthworks, and uncovered finds that included tombs, pottery, and porcelain dating from Ming China.

He went on to begin further excavations at the royal cemetery of Kota Tinggi, and the jungle city of Syong Penang. His finds were displayed as an exhibit on the &quot;Early History of Johore&quot; at the National Museum of Singapore, and several beads that he had discovered suggested that trade went on between the Roman Empire and the Malays, presumably, Gardner thought, via India. He also found gold coins originating from Johore and he published academic papers on both the beads and the coins.

By the early 1930s Gardner&#x27;s activities had moved from those exclusively of a civil servant, and he began to think of himself more as a folklorist, archaeologist and anthropologist. He was encouraged in this by the director of the Raffles Museum (now the National Museum of Singapore) and by his election to Fellowship of the Royal Anthropological Institute in 1936.

En route back to London in 1932 Gardner stopped off in Egypt and, armed with a letter of introduction, joined Sir Flinders Petrie who was excavating the site of Tall al-Ajjul in Palestine. Arriving in London in August 1932 he attended a conference on prehistory and protohistory at King&#x27;s College London, attending at least two lectures which described the cult of the Mother Goddess. He also befriended the archaeologist and practising Pagan Alexander Keiller, known for his excavations at Avebury, who would encourage Gardner to join in with the excavations at Hembury Hill in Devon, also attended by Aileen Fox and Mary Leakey.

Returning to East Asia, he took a ship from Singapore to Saigon in French Indo-China, from where he travelled to Phnom Penh, visiting the Silver Pagoda. He then took a train to Hangzhou in China, before continuing onto Shanghai; because of the ongoing Chinese Civil War, the train did not stop throughout the entire journey, something that annoyed the passengers. In 1935, Gardner attended the Second Congress for Prehistoric Research in the Far East in Manila, Philippines, acquainting himself with several experts in the field.

His main research interest lay in the Malay &quot;kris&quot; blade, which he unusually chose to spell &quot;keris&quot;; he eventually collected 400 examples and talked to natives about their magico-religious uses. Deciding to author a book on the subject, he wrote &quot;Keris and Other Malay Weapons&quot;, being encouraged to do so by anthropologist friends; it would subsequently be edited into a readable form by Betty Lumsden Milne and published by the Singapore-based Progressive Publishing Company in 1936. It was well received by literary and academic circles in Malaya.

In 1935, Gardner heard that his father had died, leaving him a bequest of £3,000. This assurance of financial independence may have led him to consider retirement, and as he was due for a long leave in 1936 the Johore Civil Service allowed him to retire slightly early, in January 1936. Gardner wanted to stay in Malaya, but he conceded to his wife Donna, who insisted that they return to England.

===Return to Europe: 1936–1938===
In 1936, Gardner and Donna left Malaya and headed for Europe. She proceeded straight to London, renting them a flat at 26 Charing Cross Road. Gardner visited Palestine, becoming involved in the archaeological excavations run by J.L. Starkey at Lachish. Here he grew particularly interested in a temple containing statues to both the male deity of Judeo-Christian theology and the pagan goddess Ashtoreth.

From Palestine, Gardner went to Turkey, Greece, Hungary, and Germany. He eventually reached England, but soon went on a visit to Denmark to attend a conference on weaponry at the Christiansborg Palace, Copenhagen, during which he gave a talk on the &quot;kris&quot;.

Returning to Britain, he found that the climate made him sick, leading him to register with a doctor, Edward A. Gregg, who recommended that he try nudism. Hesitant at first, Gardner first attended an indoor nudist club, the Lotus League in Finchley, North London, where he made several new friends and felt that the nudity cured his ailment. When summer came, he decided to visit an outdoor nudist club, that of Fouracres near the town of Bricket Wood in Hertfordshire, which he soon began to frequent.

Through nudism, Gardner made a number of notable friends, including James Laver (1899–1975), who became the Keeper of Prints and Drawings at the Victoria and Albert Museum, and Cottie Arthur Burland (1905–1983), who was the Curator of the Department of Ethnography at the British Museum. Biographer Philip Heselton suggested that through the nudist scene Gardner may have also met Dion Byngham (1896–1990), a senior member of the Order of Woodcraft Chivalry who propounded a Contemporary Pagan religion known as Dionysianism. By the end of 1936, Gardner was finding his Charing Cross Road flat to be cramped and moved into the block of flats at 32a Buckingham Palace Mansions.

Fearing the cold of the English winter, Gardner decided to sail to Cyprus in late 1936, remaining there into the following year. Visiting the Museum in Nicosia, he studied the Bronze Age swords of the island, successfully hafting one of them, on the basis of which he wrote a paper entitled &quot;The Problem of the Cypriot Bronze Dagger Hilt&quot;, which would subsequently be translated into both French and Danish, being published in the journals of the Société Préhistorique Française and the Vaabenhistorisk Selskab respectively.

Back in London, in September 1937, Gardner applied for and received a Doctorate of Philosophy from the Meta Collegiate Extension of the National Electronic Institute, an organisation based in Nevada that was widely recognised by academic institutions as offering invalid academic degrees via post for a fee. He would subsequently style himself as &quot;Dr. Gardner&quot;, despite the fact that academic institutions would not recognise his qualifications.

Planning to return to the Palestinian excavations the following winter, he was prevented from doing so when Starkey was murdered. Instead, he decided to return to Cyprus. A believer in reincarnation, Gardner came to believe that he had lived on the island once before, in a previous life, subsequently buying a plot of land in Famagusta, planning to build a house on it, although this never came about.

Influenced by his dreams, he wrote his first novel, &quot;A Goddess Arrives&quot;, over the next few years. Revolving around an Englishman living in 1930s London named Robert Denvers who has recollections of a previous life as a Bronze Age Cypriot – an allusion to Gardner himself – the primary plot of &quot;A Goddess Arrives&quot; is set in ancient Cyprus and featured a queen, Dayonis, who practices sorcery in an attempt to help her people defend themselves from invading Egyptians. Published in late 1939, biographer Philip Heselton noted that the book was &quot;a very competent first work of fiction&quot;, with strong allusions to the build-up which proceeded World War II.

Returning to London, he helped to dig shelter trenches in Hyde Park as a part of the build-up to the war, also volunteering for the Air Raid Wardens&#x27; Service. Fearing the bombing of the city, Gardner and his wife soon moved to Highcliffe, just south of the New Forest in Hampshire. Here, they purchased a house built in 1923 named Southridge, situated on the corner of Highland Avenue and Elphinstone Road.

==Involvement in Wicca==

===The Rosicrucian Order: 1938–1939===
In Highcliffe, Gardner came across a building describing itself as the &quot;First Rosicrucian Theatre in England&quot;. Having an interest in Rosicrucianism, a prominent magico-religious tradition within Western esotericism, Gardner decided to attend one of the plays performed by the group; in August 1939, Gardner took his wife to a theatrical performance based on the life of Pythagoras. An amateur thespian, she hated the performance, thinking the quality of both actors and script terrible, and she refused to go again.

Unperturbed and hoping to learn more of Rosicrucianism, Gardner joined the group in charge of running the theatre, the Rosicrucian Order Crotona Fellowship, and began attending meetings held in their local &quot;ashram&quot;. Founded in 1920 by George Alexander Sullivan, the Fellowship had been based upon a blend of Rosicrucianism, Theosophy, Freemasonry and his own personal innovation, and had moved to Christchurch in 1930.

As time went by, Gardner became critical of many of the Rosicrucian Order&#x27;s practices; Sullivan&#x27;s followers claimed that he was immortal, having formerly been the famous historical figures Pythagoras, Cornelius Agrippa and Francis Bacon. Gardner facetiously asked if he was also the Wandering Jew, much to the annoyance of Sullivan himself. Another belief held by the group that Gardner found amusing was that a lamp hanging from one of the ceilings was the disguised holy grail of Arthurian legend.

Gardner&#x27;s dissatisfaction with the group grew, particularly when in 1939, one of the group&#x27;s leaders sent a letter out to all members in which she stated that war would not come. The very next day, Britain declared war on Germany, greatly unimpressing the increasingly cynical Gardner.

Alongside Rosicrucianism, Gardner had also been pursuing other interests. In 1939, Gardner joined the Folk-Lore Society; his first contribution to its journal &quot;Folk-Lore&quot;, appeared in the June 1939 issue and described a box of witchcraft relics that he believed had belonged to the 17th century &quot;Witch-Finder General&quot;, Matthew Hopkins. Subsequently, in 1946 he would go on to become a member of the society&#x27;s governing council, although most other members of the society were wary of him and his academic credentials.

Gardner would also join the Historical Association, being elected co-president of its Bournemouth and Christchurch branch in June 1944, following which he became a vocal supporter for the construction of a local museum for the Christchurch borough. He also involved himself in preparations for the impending war, joining the Air Raid Precautions (ARP) as a warden, where he soon rose to a position of local seniority, with his own house being assigned as the ARP post. In 1940, following the outbreak of conflict, he also tried to sign up for the Local Defence Volunteers, or &quot;Home Guard&quot;, but was turned away because he was already an ARP warden.

He managed to circumvent this restriction by joining his local Home Guard in the capacity as armourer, which was officially classified as technical staff. Gardner took a strong interest in the Home Guard, helping to arm his fellows from his own personal weaponry collection and personally manufacturing molotov cocktails.

===The New Forest coven: 1939–1944===
Although sceptical of the Rosicrucian Order, Gardner got on well with a group of individuals inside the group who were &quot;rather brow-beaten by the others, kept themselves to themselves.&quot; Gardner&#x27;s biographer Philip Heselton theorised that this group consisted of Edith Woodford-Grimes (1887–1975), Susie Mason, her brother Ernie Mason, and their sister Rosetta Fudge, all of whom had originally come from Southampton before moving to the area around Highcliffe, where they joined the Order.

According to Gardner, &quot;unlike many of the others [in the Order], [they] had to earn their livings, were cheerful and optimistic and had a real interest in the occult&quot;. Gardner became &quot;really very fond of them&quot;, remarking that he &quot;would have gone through hell and high water even then for any of them.&quot; In particular he grew close to Woodford-Grimes, being invited over to her home to meet her daughter, and the two helped each other with their writing, Woodford-Grimes probably assisting Gardner edit &quot;A Goddess Arrives&quot; prior to publication. Gardner would subsequently give her the nickname &quot;Dafo&quot;, for which she would become better known.
According to Gardner&#x27;s later account, one night in September 1939, they took him to a large house owned by &quot;Old Dorothy&quot; Clutterbuck, a wealthy local woman, where he was made to strip naked and taken through an initiation ceremony. Halfway through the ceremony, he heard the word &quot;Wicca (Male)&quot; and &quot;Wicce (Female)&quot;, and he recognised it as an Old English word for &quot;witch&quot;.

He was already acquainted with Margaret Murray&#x27;s theory of the Witch-cult, and that &quot;I then knew then that which I had thought burnt out hundreds of years ago still survived.&quot; This group were the New Forest coven, and he portrayed them as one of the few surviving covens of an ancient, pre-Christian Witch-Cult religion. Murray&#x27;s theory of a pagan &#x27;witch-cult&#x27; has been discredited. Later research by the likes of Hutton and Heselton has shown that the New Forest coven was probably only formed in the mid-1930s, based upon Murray&#x27;s discredited theories and works on folk magic.

Gardner only ever described one of their rituals in depth, and this was an event that he termed &quot;Operation Cone of Power&quot;. According to his own account, it took place in 1940 in a part of the New Forest and was designed to ward off the Nazis from invading Britain by magical means. Gardner wrote that a &quot;Great Circle&quot; was erected at night, with a &quot;great cone of power&quot; – a form of magical energy – being raised and sent to Berlin with the command of &quot;you cannot cross the sea, you cannot cross the sea, you cannot come, you cannot come&quot;.

===Bricket Wood and the Origins of Gardnerianism: 1945–1950===
Throughout his time in the New Forest, Gardner had regularly travelled to London, keeping his flat at Buckingham Palace Mansions until mid-1939 and regularly visiting the Spielplatz nudist club there. At Spielplatz he befriended Ross Nichols, whom he would later introduce to the Pagan religion of Druidry; Nichols would become enamoured with this faith, eventually founding the Order of Bards, Ovates and Druids. However, following the war, Gardner decided to return to London, moving into 47 Ridgemount Gardens, Bloomsbury in late 1944 or early 1945.

Continuing his interest in nudism, in 1945 he purchased a plot of land in Fouracres, a nudist colony near to the village of Bricket Wood in Hertfordshire that would soon be renamed Five Acres. As a result, he would become one of the major shareholders at the club, exercising a significant level of power over any administrative decisions and was involved in a recruitment drive to obtain more members.


Between 1936 and 1939, Gardner befriended the Christian mystic J.S.M. Ward, proprietor of the Abbey Folk Park, Britain&#x27;s oldest open-air museum. One of the exhibits was a 16th-century cottage that Ward had found near to Ledbury, Herefordshire and had transported to his park, where he exhibited it as a &quot;witch&#x27;s cottage&quot;. Gardner made a deal with Ward exchanging the cottage for Gardner&#x27;s piece of land near to Famagusta in Cyprus.

The cottage was dismantled, and the parts transported to Bricket Wood, where they were reassembled on Gardner&#x27;s land at Five Acres. In Midsummer 1947 he held a ceremony in the cottage as a form of housewarming, which Heselton speculated was probably based upon the ceremonial magic rites featured in &quot;The Key of Solomon&quot; grimoire.

Furthering his interest in esoteric Christianity, in August 1946 Gardner was ordained as a priest in the Ancient British Church, a fellowship open to anyone who considered themselves a monotheist. Gardner also took an interest in Druidry, joining the Ancient Druid Order (ADO) and attending its annual Midsummer rituals at Stonehenge.

He also joined the Folk-Lore Society, being elected to their council in 1946, and that same year giving a talk on &quot;Art Magic and Talismans&quot;. Nevertheless, many fellows – including Katherine Briggs – were dismissive of Gardner&#x27;s ideas and his fraudulent academic credentials. In 1946 he also joined the Society for Psychical Research.

On May Day 1947, Gardner&#x27;s friend Arnold Crowther introduced him to Aleister Crowley, the ceremonial magician who had founded the religion of Thelema in 1904. Shortly before his death, Crowley elevated Gardner to the IV° of Ordo Templi Orientis (O.T.O.) and issued a charter decreeing that Gardner could admit people into its Minerval degree. The charter itself was written in Gardner&#x27;s handwriting and only signed by Crowley.

From November 1947 to March 1948, Gardner and his wife toured the United States visiting relatives in Memphis, also visiting New Orleans, where Gardner hoped to learn about Voodoo. During his voyage, Crowley had died, and as a result Gardner considered himself the head of the O.T.O. in Europe, (a position accepted by Lady Frieda Harris). He met Crowley&#x27;s successor, Karl Germer, in New York though Gardner would soon lose interest in leading the O.T.O., and in 1951 he was replaced by Frederic Mellinger as the O.T.O.&#x27;s European representative.

Gardner hoped to spread Wicca and described some of its practices in a fictional form as &quot;High Magic&#x27;s Aid&quot;. Set in the twelfth-century, Gardner included scenes of ceremonial magic based on &quot;The Key of Solomon&quot;. Published by the Atlantis Bookshop in July 1949, Gardner&#x27;s manuscript had been edited into a publishable form by astrologer Madeline Montalban.

Privately, he had also begun work on a scrapbook known as &quot;Ye Bok of Ye Art Magical&quot;, in which he wrote down a number of Wiccan rituals and spells. This would prove to be the prototype for what he later termed a Book of Shadows. He also gained some of his first initiates, Barbara and Gilbert Vickers, who were initiated at some point between autumn 1949 and autumn 1950.

===Doreen Valiente and the Museum of Magic and Witchcraft: 1950–1957===

Gardner also came into contact with Cecil Williamson, who was intent on opening his own museum devoted to witchcraft; the result would be the Folk-lore Centre of Superstition and Witchcraft, opened in Castletown on the Isle of Man in 1951. Gardner and his wife moved to the island, where he took up the position of &quot;resident witch&quot;. On 29 July, the &quot;Sunday Pictorial&quot; published an article about the museum in which Gardner declared &quot;Of course I&#x27;m a witch. And I get great fun out of it.&quot;

The museum was not a financial success, and the relationship between Gardner and Williamson deteriorated. In 1954, Gardner bought the museum from Williamson, who returned to England to form the rival Museum of Witchcraft, eventually settling it in Boscastle, Cornwall. Gardner renamed his exhibition the Museum of Magic and Witchcraft and continued running it up until his death.

He also acquired a flat at 145 Holland Road, near Shepherd&#x27;s Bush in West London, but nevertheless fled to warmer climates during the winter, where his asthma would not be so badly affected, for instance spending time in France, Italy, and the Gold Coast. From his base in London, he would frequent Atlantis bookshop, thereby encountering a number of other occultists, including Austin Osman Spare and Kenneth Grant, and he also continued his communication with Karl Germer until 1956.

In 1952, Gardner had begun to correspond with a young woman named Doreen Valiente. She eventually requested initiation into the Craft, and though Gardner was hesitant at first, he agreed that they could meet during the winter at the home of Edith Woodford-Grimes. Valiente got on well with both Gardner and Woodford-Grimes and having no objections to either ritual nudity or scourging (which she had read about in a copy of Gardner&#x27;s novel &quot;High Magic&#x27;s Aid&quot; that he had given to her), she was initiated by Gardner into Wicca on Midsummer 1953.

Valiente went on to join the Bricket Wood Coven. She soon rose to become the High Priestess of the coven and helped Gardner to revise his Book of Shadows, and attempting to cut out most of Crowley&#x27;s influence.

In 1954, Gardner published a non-fiction book, &quot;Witchcraft Today&quot;, containing a preface by Margaret Murray, who had published her discredited theory of &#x27;witchcraft&#x27; being a surviving pagan religion in her 1921 book, &quot;The Witch-Cult in Western Europe&quot;. In his book, Gardner not only espoused Murray&#x27;s theory, but also his theory that a belief in faeries in Europe was due to a secretive pygmy race that lived alongside other communities, and that the Knights Templar had been initiates of the Craft.

Alongside this book, Gardner began to increasingly court publicity, going so far as to invite the press to write articles about the religion. Many of these turned out very negatively for the cult; one declared &quot;Witches Devil-Worship in London!&quot;, and another accused him of whitewashing witchcraft in his luring of people into covens. Gardner continued courting publicity, despite the negative articles that many tabloids were producing, and believed that only through publicity could more people become interested in witchcraft, so preventing the &quot;Old Religion&quot;, as he called it, from dying out.

===Later life and death===
In 1960, Gardner&#x27;s official biography, entitled &quot;Gerald Gardner: Witch&quot;, was published. It was written by a friend of his, the Sufi mystic Idries Shah, but used the name of one of Gardner&#x27;s High Priests, Jack L. Bracelin, because Shah was wary about being associated with Witchcraft. In May of that year, Gardner travelled to Buckingham Palace, where he enjoyed a garden party in recognition of his years of service to the Empire in the Far East. Soon after his trip, Gardner&#x27;s wife Donna died, and Gardner himself once again began to suffer badly from asthma.

The following year he, along with Shah and Lois Bourne, travelled to the island of Majorca to holiday with the poet Robert Graves, whose &quot;The White Goddess&quot; would play a significant part in the burgeoning Wiccan religion. In 1963, Gardner decided to go to Lebanon over the winter. Whilst returning home on the &quot;Scottish Prince&quot; on 12 February 1964, he suffered a fatal heart attack at the breakfast table. He was buried in Tunisia, the ship&#x27;s next port of call, and his funeral was attended only by the ship&#x27;s captain. He was 79 years old.

Though having bequeathed the museum, all his artifacts, and the copyright to his books in his will to one of his High Priestesses, Monique Wilson, she and her husband sold off the artefact collection to the American Ripley&#x27;s Believe It or Not! organisation several years later. Ripley&#x27;s took the collection to America, where it was displayed in two museums before being sold off during the 1980s. Gardner had also left parts of his inheritance to Patricia Crowther, Doreen Valiente, Lois Bourne and Jack Bracelin, the latter inheriting the Fiveacres Nudist Club and taking over as full-time High Priest of the Bricket Wood coven.

Several years after Gardner&#x27;s death, the Wiccan High Priestess Eleanor Bone visited North Africa and went looking for Gardner&#x27;s grave. She discovered that the cemetery he was interred in was to be redeveloped, and so she raised enough money for his body to be moved to another cemetery in Tunis, where it currently remains. In 2007, a new plaque was attached to his grave, describing him as being &quot;Father of Modern Wicca. Beloved of the Great Goddess&quot;.

==Personal life==
Gardner only married once, to Donna, and several who knew him have said that he was devoted to her. Indeed, after her death in 1960, he began to again suffer serious asthma attacks. Despite this, as many coven members slept over at his cottage due to living too far away to travel home safely, he was known to cuddle up to his young High Priestess, Dayonis, after rituals. The author Philip Heselton, who largely researched Wicca&#x27;s origins, came to the conclusion that Gardner had held a long-term affair with Dafo, a theory expanded upon by Adrian Bott.

Those who knew him within the Wiccan movement recalled how he was a firm believer in the therapeutic benefits of sunbathing. He also had several tattoos on his body, depicting magical symbols such as a snake, dragon, anchor and dagger. In his later life he wore a &quot;heavy bronze bracelet... denoting the three degrees... of witchcraft&quot; as well as a &quot;large silver ring with... signs on it, which... represented his witch-name &#x27;Scire&#x27;, in the letters of the magical Theban alphabet.&quot;

According to Bricket Wood coven member Frederic Lamond, Gardner also used to comb his beard into a narrow barbiche and his hair into two horn like peaks, giving him &quot;a somewhat demonic appearance&quot;. Lamond thought that Gardner was &quot;surprisingly lacking in charisma&quot; for someone at the forefront of a religious movement.

Gardner was a supporter of the centre-right Conservative Party, and for several years had been a member of the Highcliffe Conservative Association, as well as being an avid reader of the pro-Conservative newspaper, &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;.

==Criticisms==

=== Virulent homophobia ===
Lois Bourne, one of the High Priestesses of the Bricket Wood Coven, accused Gardner of homophobia:

Gerald was homophobic. He had a deep hatred and detestation of homosexuality, which he regarded as a disgusting perversion and a flagrant transgression of natural law ... &quot;There are no homosexual witches, and it is not possible to be a homosexual and a witch&quot; Gerald almost shouted. No one argued with him.

=== False educational claims ===
In a 1951 interview with a journalist from the &quot;Sunday Pictorial&quot; newspaper, Gardner said he was a Doctor of Philosophy from Singapore and also had a doctorate in literature from Toulouse. Later investigation by Doreen Valiente suggested that these claims were false. The University of Singapore did not exist at that time and the University of Toulouse had no record of his receiving a doctorate. Valiente suggests that these claims may have been a form of compensation for his lack of formal education.

=== Media engagement ===
Valiente further criticises Gardner for his publicity-seeking – or at least his indiscretion. After a series of tabloid exposés, some members of his coven proposed some rules limiting what members of the Craft should say to non-members. Valiente reports that Gardner responded with a set of Wiccan laws of his own, which he claimed were original, but others suspected he had made up on the spot. This led to a split in the coven, with Valiente and others leaving.

==Legacy==
Commenting on Gardner, Pagan studies scholar Ethan Doyle White commented that &quot;There are few figures in esoteric history who can rival him for his dominating place in the pantheon of Pagan pioneers.&quot;

In 2012, Philip Heselton published a two-volume biography of Gardner, titled &quot;Witchfather&quot;. The biography was reviewed by Pagan studies scholar Ethan Doyle White in &quot;The Pomegranate&quot; journal, where he commented that it was &quot;more exhaustive with greater detail&quot; than Heselton&#x27;s prior tomes and was &quot;excellent in most respects&quot;.

<text>Gavin MacLeod ( ; born Allan George See; February 28, 1931 – May 29, 2021) was an American actor best known for his roles as news writer Murray Slaughter on &quot;The Mary Tyler Moore Show&quot; and ship&#x27;s captain Merrill Stubing on ABC&#x27;s &quot;The Love Boat&quot;. After growing up Catholic, MacLeod became an evangelical Christian in 1984. His career, which spanned six decades, included work as a Christian television host, author, and guest on several talk, variety, and religious programs.

MacLeod&#x27;s career began in films in 1957. In 1960 he was on an episode of Death Valley Days named Yankee Confederate. In 1965, he starred in &quot;The Sword of Ali Baba&quot;. He went on to appear in &quot;A Man Called Gannon&quot; (1968), in &quot;The Thousand Plane Raid (1969)&quot;, and in &quot;Kelly&#x27;s Heroes&quot; (1970).

MacLeod also achieved continuing television success co-starring alongside Ernest Borgnine on &quot;McHale&#x27;s Navy&quot; (1962–1964) as Joseph &quot;Happy&quot; Haines.

==Early life==
Gavin MacLeod was born Allen George See on February 28, 1931, in Mount Kisco, New York. His mother, Margaret (née Shea) See (1906–2004), a middle school dropout, worked for &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot;. His father, George See (1906–1945), an electrician, was part Chippewa (Ojibwe). His brother Ronald was three years his junior. He grew up in Pleasantville, New York, and studied acting at Ithaca College, from which he graduated in 1952 with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in fine arts.

After serving in the United States Air Force, he moved to New York City and worked at Radio City Music Hall while looking for acting work. At about this time he changed his name, drawing &quot;Gavin&quot; from a physically disabled victim in a television drama, and &quot;MacLeod&quot; from his Ithaca drama coach, Beatrice MacLeod. MacLeod said in a 2013 interview with &quot;Parade&quot; about his stage name, he &quot;felt as if my name was getting in the way of my success.&quot; &quot;Allan,&quot; he wrote, &quot;just wasn&#x27;t strong enough,&quot; and &quot;See&quot; was &quot;too confusing.&quot;

==Career==
MacLeod made his television debut in 1957 on &quot;The Walter Winchell File&quot; at the age of 26. His first movie appearance was a small, uncredited role in &quot;The True Story of Lynn Stuart&quot; in 1958. Soon thereafter, he landed a credited role in &quot;I Want to Live!&quot;, a 1958 prison drama starring Susan Hayward. He was soon noticed by Blake Edwards, who in 1958 cast him in the pilot episode of his NBC series &quot;Peter Gunn&quot;, two guest roles on the Edwards CBS series &quot;Mr. Lucky&quot; in 1959, and as a nervous harried navy yeoman in &quot;Operation Petticoat&quot;, with Cary Grant and Tony Curtis. &quot;Operation Petticoat&quot; proved to be a breakout role for MacLeod, and he was soon cast in two other Edwards comedies, &quot;High Time&quot; with Bing Crosby and &quot;The Party&quot; with Peter Sellers.

In December 1961, he landed a guest role on &quot;The Dick Van Dyke Show&quot;, which was his first time working with Mary Tyler Moore. MacLeod also had guest appearances on &quot;Perry Mason&quot;, &quot;The Andy Griffith Show&quot;, &quot;Ben Casey&quot;, &quot;The Big Valley&quot;, &quot;Hogan&#x27;s Heroes&quot;, &quot;Ironside&quot;, and &quot;My Favorite Martian&quot;. He played the role of a drug pusher, &quot;Big Chicken&quot;, in two episodes of the first season of &quot;Hawaii Five-O&quot;.

His first regular television role began in 1962 as Joseph &quot;Happy&quot; Haines on &quot;McHale&#x27;s Navy&quot;, but he was frustrated with the role&#x27;s limitations. He later describe Haines as &quot;not much of a character&quot; who had &quot;two lines a week&quot;, and was sometimes simply used a prop: &quot;Sometimes they&#x27;d have me stand there. They&#x27;d shoot on a back lot, and they&#x27;d use me to cover something they didn&#x27;t want anybody to see on the back lot.&quot; McLeod left the show after two seasons to appear as Signalman 2nd Class Crosley in the film &quot;The Sand Pebbles&quot; with Steve McQueen.

MacLeod&#x27;s second breakout role as Murray Slaughter on CBS&#x27;s &quot;The Mary Tyler Moore Show&quot; won him lasting fame and two Golden Globe Award nominations. His starring role as Captain Stubing on &quot;The Love Boat&quot;, his next television series, was broadcast in 90 countries worldwide, between 1977 and 1986, spanning nine seasons. His work on that show earned him three Golden Globe nominations. Co-starring with him was a familiar actor and best friend Bernie Kopell as Dr. Adam Bricker and Ted Lange as bartender Isaac Washington. Lange said in a 2017 interview with &quot;The Wiseguyz Show&quot; of MacLeod that &quot;Oh yeah, sure, Gavin was wonderful. Gavin lives down here in Palm Springs and we&#x27;re still tight, all of us, Gavin and Bernie and Jill; we still see each other. Fred (Grandy) lives in a different state, we&#x27;re still close, we&#x27;re still good friends.&quot;

MacLeod became the global ambassador for Princess Cruises in 1986. He played a role in ceremonies launching many of the line&#x27;s new ships. In 1997, MacLeod joined the &quot;Love Boat&quot; cast on &quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show&quot;.

After &quot;The Love Boat&quot;, MacLeod toured with Michael Learned (of &quot;The Waltons&quot;) in &quot;Love Letters&quot;. He made several appearances in musicals such as &quot;Gigi&quot; and &quot;Copacabana&quot; between 1997 and 2003. In December 2008, he appeared with the Colorado Symphony in Denver.

MacLeod and his wife were hosts on the Trinity Broadcasting Network for 17 years, primarily hosting a show about marriage called &quot;Back on Course&quot;. MacLeod appeared in Rich Christiano&#x27;s &quot;Time Changer,&quot; a movie about time travel and how the morals of society have moved away from the Bible. He also plays the lead role in Christiano&#x27;s 2009 film &quot;The Secrets of Jonathan Sperry&quot;.

===Later activity===
In April 2010, the entire cast of &quot;The Love Boat&quot; attended the TV Land Awards with the exception of MacLeod, due to a back operation to repair a couple of injured discs. Former co-star and long-term friend Ted Lange contacted him and received word that MacLeod was doing well. In December, MacLeod appeared as a guest narrator with the Florida Orchestra and Master Chorale of Tampa Bay.

MacLeod served as the honorary Mayor of Pacific Palisades for five years, until Sugar Ray Leonard succeeded him in 2011. On February 28, 2011, MacLeod celebrated his 80th birthday aboard the &quot;Golden Princess&quot; on Princess Cruises in Los Angeles, California. His friends and family wished him a happy birthday and presented him with a 3-D cake replica of the &quot;Pacific Princess&quot;, the original &quot;Love Boat&quot;.

MacLeod appeared on the special for Betty White&#x27;s 90th birthday on January 17, 2012. He reunited with White to film &quot;Safety Old School Style&quot;, an in-flight safety video for Air New Zealand in 2013. By January 2013, the video had been viewed two million times on YouTube. In October 2013, MacLeod appeared on &quot;Today&quot; to begin the promotional tour for his new book &quot;This Is Your Captain Speaking: My Fantastic Voyage Through Hollywood, Faith &amp; Life&quot;. This appearance included a special set change to honor MacLeod&#x27;s appearance on the show. In addition to television appearances, he continued his national book tour.
On November 5, 2013, MacLeod joined his &quot;Love Boat&quot; cast mates live on the CBS daytime show &quot;The Talk&quot;. A full one-hour episode was dedicated to the cast reunion. The &quot;Talk&quot; co-hosts dressed in costumes to commemorate their special guests&#x27; arrivals. Spanish-American actress Charo also appeared on the reunion show. Charo guest-starred in eight episodes of &quot;The Love Boat&quot;. Jack Jones performed the &quot;Love Boat&quot; theme song, which he introduced in 1977.

In December 2013, MacLeod appeared on &quot;The 700 Club&quot; to discuss his life and career. The following year, on February 1, MacLeod was honored with a star on the Palm Springs Walk of Stars in downtown Palm Springs, California. In January 2015, MacLeod appeared in the Rose Parade along with several other members of the original cast of &quot;The Love Boat&quot;. Later that same year MacLeod starred in the play &quot;Happy Hour&quot; at the Coachella Valley Repertory Theatre (CVRep) in Rancho Mirage, California, a role which earned him critical praise.

==Writing==
In 1987, following MacLeod&#x27;s conversion to evangelical Christianity and remarriage, he and his wife, Patti, wrote about his struggles with alcoholism and their divorce in &quot;Back On Course: The Remarkable Story of a Divorce That Ended in Remarriage&quot;.

In the 1980s Gavin and his wife Patti started a seminar called Born Again Marriages. The main purpose was to share their journey with others that were going through separation or divorce. They really wanted to see marriages salvaged much like theirs.

In 2013, MacLeod released a memoir, &quot;This Is Your Captain Speaking: My Fantastic Voyage Through Hollywood, Faith &amp; Life&quot;. He said, &quot;...all my living has been based on what other people have written... I hope it can help others, how I overcame and never gave up. There are so many lessons in life.&quot; In the book, MacLeod recounted his stories as a young actor trying to make a name for himself in Hollywood, the lifelong friends he made, struggles with alcoholism, divorce, and faith.

==Personal life==
While working as an usher and elevator operator at Radio City Music Hall, MacLeod met dancer Joan F. Rootvik, who was a Rockette. They married in 1955 and had two sons and two daughters before divorcing in 1972.

In 1974, he married Patti Kendig. The couple divorced in 1982 and remarried in 1985. During the mid-1980s, they became evangelical Christians and credited their faith for bringing them back together.

On September 20, 2009, MacLeod discussed his conversion to evangelicalism at The Rock Church in Anaheim, California, and was a guest speaker there in 2012.

===Death===
MacLeod died at his home in Palm Desert, California, on May 29, 2021, aged 90. He is interred at Forest Lawn Cemetery in Cathedral City.

<text>The Gopher protocol () is a communication protocol designed for distributing, searching, and retrieving documents in Internet Protocol networks. The design of the Gopher protocol and user interface is menu-driven, and presented an alternative to the World Wide Web in its early stages, but ultimately fell into disfavor, yielding to Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). The Gopher ecosystem is often regarded as the effective predecessor of the World Wide Web.

==Usage==
The Gopher protocol was invented by a team led by Mark P. McCahill at the University of Minnesota. It offers some features not natively supported by the Web and imposes a much stronger hierarchy on the documents it stores. Its text menu interface is well-suited to computing environments that rely heavily on remote text-oriented computer terminals, which were still common at the time of its creation in 1991, and the simplicity of its protocol facilitated a wide variety of client implementations. More recent Gopher revisions and graphical clients added support for multimedia.

Gopher&#x27;s hierarchical structure provided a platform for the first large-scale electronic library connections. The Gopher protocol is still in use by enthusiasts, and although it has been almost entirely supplanted by the Web, a small population of actively-maintained servers remains.

===Origins===
The Gopher system was released in mid-1991 by Mark P. McCahill, Farhad Anklesaria, Paul Lindner, Daniel Torrey, and Bob Alberti of the University of Minnesota in the United States. Its central goals were, as stated in :

* A file-like hierarchical arrangement that would be familiar to users.
* A simple syntax.
* A system that can be created quickly and inexpensively.
* Extensibility of the file system metaphor; allowing addition of searches for example.

Gopher combines document hierarchies with collections of services, including WAIS, the Archie and Veronica search engines, and gateways to other information systems such as File Transfer Protocol (FTP) and Usenet.

The general interest in campus-wide information systems (CWISs) in higher education at the time, and the ease of setup of Gopher servers to create an instant CWIS with links to other sites&#x27; online directories and resources, were the factors contributing to Gopher&#x27;s rapid adoption.

The name was coined by Anklesaria as a play on several meanings of the word &quot;gopher&quot;. The University of Minnesota mascot is the gopher, a gofer is an assistant who &quot;goes for&quot; things, and a gopher burrows through the ground to reach a desired location.

===Decline===
The World Wide Web was in its infancy in 1991, and Gopher services quickly became established. By the late 1990s, Gopher had ceased expanding. Several factors contributed to Gopher&#x27;s stagnation:

* In February 1993, the University of Minnesota announced that it would charge licensing fees for the use of its implementation of the Gopher server. Users became concerned that fees might also be charged for independent implementations. Gopher expansion stagnated, to the advantage of the World Wide Web, to which CERN disclaimed ownership. In September 2000, the University of Minnesota re-licensed its Gopher software under the GNU General Public License.
* Gopher client functionality was quickly duplicated by the early Mosaic web browser, which subsumed its protocol.
* Gopher has a more rigid structure than the free-form HyperText Markup Language (HTML) of the Web. Every Gopher document has a defined format and type, and the typical user navigates through a single server-defined menu system to get to a particular document. This can be quite different from the way a user finds documents on the Web.
* Failure to follow the open systems model and bad publicity in comparison to the World Wide Web

Gopher remains in active use by its enthusiasts, and there have been attempts to revive Gopher on modern platforms and mobile devices. One attempt is The Overbite Project, which hosts various browser extensions and modern clients.

===Server census===

*, there remained about 160 gopher servers indexed by Veronica-2, reflecting a slow growth from 2007 when there were fewer than 100. They are typically infrequently updated. On these servers, Veronica indexed approximately 2.5 million unique selectors. A handful of new servers were being set up every year by hobbyists with over 50 having been set up and added to Floodgap&#x27;s list since 1999. A snapshot of Gopherspace in 2007 circulated on BitTorrent and was still available in 2010. Due to the simplicity of the Gopher protocol, setting up new servers or adding Gopher support to browsers is often done in a tongue-in-cheek manner, principally on April Fools&#x27; Day.
*In November 2014 Veronica indexed 144 gopher servers, reflecting a small drop from 2012, but within these servers Veronica indexed approximately 3 million unique selectors.
*In March 2016 Veronica indexed 135 gopher servers, within which it indexed approximately 4 million unique selectors.
*In March 2017 Veronica indexed 133 gopher servers, within which it indexed approximately 4.9 million unique selectors.
*In May 2018 Veronica indexed 260 gopher servers, within which it indexed approximately 3.7 million unique selectors.
*In May 2019 Veronica indexed 320 gopher servers, within which it indexed approximately 4.2 million unique selectors.
*In January 2020 Veronica indexed 395 gopher servers, within which it indexed approximately 4.5 million unique selectors.
*In February 2021 Veronica indexed 361 gopher servers, within which it indexed approximately 6 million unique selectors.
*In February 2022 Veronica indexed 325 gopher servers, within which it indexed approximately 5 million unique selectors.

==Technical details==
The conceptualization of knowledge in &quot;Gopher space&quot; or a &quot;cloud&quot; as specific information in a particular file, and the prominence of the FTP, influenced the technology and the resulting functionality of Gopher.

=== Gopher characteristics ===
Gopher is designed to function and to appear much like a mountable read-only global network file system (and software, such as gopherfs, is available that can actually mount a Gopher server as a FUSE resource). At a minimum, whatever can be done with data files on a CD-ROM, can be done on Gopher.

A Gopher system consists of a series of hierarchical hyperlinkable menus. The choice of menu items and titles is controlled by the administrator of the server.

Similar to a file on a Web server, a file on a Gopher server can be linked to as a menu item from any other Gopher server. Many servers take advantage of this inter-server linking to provide a directory of other servers that the user can access.

===Protocol===
The Gopher protocol was first described in . Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) has assigned Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) port 70 to the Gopher protocol. The protocol is simple to negotiate, making it possible to browse without using a client.

====User request====
First, the client establishes a TCP connection with the server on port 70, the standard gopher port. The client then sends a string followed by a carriage return followed by a line feed (a &quot;CR + LF&quot; sequence). This is the selector, which identifies the document to be retrieved. If the item selector were an empty line, the default directory would be selected.

====Server response====
The server then replies with the requested item and closes the connection. According to the protocol, before the connection closes, the server should send a full-stop (i.e., a period character) on a line by itself. However, not all servers conform to this part of the protocol and the server may close a connection without returning a final full-stop. The main type of reply from the server is a text or binary resource. Alternatively, the resource can be a menu: a form of structured text resource providing references to other resources.

Because of the simplicity of the Gopher protocol, tools such as netcat make it possible to download Gopher content easily from a command line:

$ echo jacks/jack.exe | nc gopher.example.org 70 &gt; jack.exe

The protocol is also supported by cURL since 7.21.2-DEV, which was released in 2010.

====Search request====

The selector string in the request can optionally be followed by a tab character and a search string. This is used by item type 7.

===Source code of a menu===
Gopher menu items are defined by lines of tab-separated values in a text file. This file is sometimes called a &quot;gophermap&quot;. As the source code to a gopher menu, a gophermap is roughly analogous to an HTML file for a web page. Each tab-separated line (called a &quot;selector line&quot;) gives the client software a description of the menu item: what it is, what it is called, and where it leads to. The client displays the menu items in the order that they appear in the gophermap.

The first character in a selector line indicates the &quot;item type&quot;, which tells the client what kind of file or protocol the menu item points to. This helps the client decide what to do with it. Gopher&#x27;s item types are a more basic precursor to the media type system used by the Web and email attachments.

The item type is followed by the &quot;user display string&quot; (a description or label that represents the item in the menu); the selector (a path or other string for the resource on the server); the &quot;hostname&quot; (the domain name or IP address of the server), and the network port.

All lines in a gopher menu are terminated by &quot;CR + LF&quot;.

Example of a selector line in a menu source: The following selector line generates a link to the &quot;/home&quot; directory at the subdomain gopher.floodgap.com, on port 70. The item type of indicates that the linked resource is a Gopher menu itself. The string &quot;Floodgap Home&quot; is what the client will show to the user when visiting the example menu.

 1Floodgap Home /home gopher.floodgap.com 70

====Item types====
In a Gopher menu&#x27;s source code, a one-character code indicates what kind of content the client should expect. This code may either be a digit or a letter of the alphabet; letters are case-sensitive.

The technical specification for Gopher, , defines 14 item types. The later gopher+ specification defined an additional 3 types. A one-character code indicates what kind of content the client should expect. Item type is an error code for exception handling. Gopher client authors improvised item types (HTML), (informational message), and (sound file) after the publication of RFC 1436. Browsers like Netscape Navigator and early versions of Microsoft Internet Explorer would prepend the item type code to the selector as described in , so that the type of the gopher item could be determined by the url itself. Most gopher browsers still available, use these prefixes in their urls.

Here is an example gopher session where the user requires a gopher menu ( on the first line):

The gopher menu sent back from the server, is a sequence of lines each of which describes an item that can be retrieved. Most clients will display these as hypertext links, and so allow the user to navigate through gopherspace by following the links.
This menu includes a text resource (itemtype on the third line), multiple links to submenus (itemtype , on the second line as well as lines 4–6) and a non-standard information message (from line 7 on), broken down to multiple lines by providing dummy values for selector, host and port.

====External links====
Historically, to create a link to a Web server, &quot;GET /&quot; was used as a pseudo-selector to emulate an HTTP GET request. John Goerzen created an addition to the Gopher protocol, commonly referred to as &quot;URL links&quot;, that allows links to any protocol that supports URLs. For example, to create a link to http://gopher.quux.org/, the item type is , the display string is the title of the link, the item selector is &quot;URL:http://gopher.quux.org/&quot;, and the domain and port are that of the originating Gopher server (so that clients that do not support URL links will query the server and receive an HTML redirection page).

===Gopher+===
Gopher+ is a forward compatible enhancement to the Gopher protocol. Gopher+ works by sending metadata between the client and the server. The enhancement was never widely adopted by Gopher servers.
The client sends a tab followed by a +. A Gopher+ server will respond with a status line followed by the content the client requested. An item is marked as supporting Gopher+ in the Gopher directory listing by a tab + after the port (this is the case of some of the items in the example above).

Other features of Gopher+ include:

* Item attributes, which can include the items
** Administrator
** Last date of modification
** Different views of the file, like PostScript or plain text, or different languages
** Abstract, or description of the item
* Interactive queries

==Client software==
===Gopher clients===
These are clients, libraries, and utilities primarily designed to access gopher resources.

===Other clients===
Clients like web browsers, libraries, and utilities primarily designed to access World Wide Web resources, but which maintain(ed) gopher support.

* Browse, a browser for RISC OS
* Camino, versions 1.0 to 2.1.2, always uses port 70.
* Classilla, versions 9.0 to 9.3.4b1 as of March 2021, hardcoded to port 70 from 9.0 to 9.2; whitelisted ports from 9.2.1
* Dillo+
* Dooble
* ELinks, versions 0.10.0 to 0.12pre6 as of October 2012, unmaintained browser with gopher build option. Fork &quot;felinks&quot; offers support as a build option
* Edbrowse, a line-oriented editor and browser with an interface like that of ed (text editor)
* Falkon, with plug-in only, requires Falkon ≥ 3.1.0 with both the KDE Frameworks Integration extension (shipped with Falkon ≥ 3.1.0) enabled and the (separate) kio_gopher plug-in ≥ 0.1.99 (first release for KDE Frameworks 5) installed
* Mozilla Firefox versions 0.1 to 3.6, built-in support dropped from Firefox 4.0 onwards; can be added back by installing one of the extensions by the Overbite Project
* Galeon version 2.0.7

* Internet Explorer for Mac version 5.2.3, PowerPC-only
* Internet Explorer, dropped with version 6: Support removed by MS02-047 from IE 6 SP1 can be re-enabled in the Windows Registry. Always uses port 70. Gopher support was disabled in Internet Explorer versions 5.x and 6 for Windows in August 2002 by a patch meant to fix a security vulnerability in the browser&#x27;s Gopher protocol handler to reduce the attack surface which was included in IE6 SP1; however, it can be re-enabled by editing the Windows registry. In Internet Explorer 7, Gopher support was removed on the WinINET level.
* K-Meleon, dropped support
* Konqueror, with plug-in only, requires kio_gopher plug-in
* Line Mode Browser, since version 1.1, January 1992
* Lynx
* Mosaic, version 3.0
* NetSurf, under development, based on the cURL fetcher
* Netscape Navigator, version 9.0.0.6
* OmniWeb, since version 5.9.2 , first WebKit Browser to support Gopher
* Opera, Opera 9.0 included a proxy capability
* Pavuk, a web mirror (recursive download) software program
* SeaMonkey, version 1.0 to 2.0.14, built-in support dropped from version 2.1 onward; could be added back to some versions via Overbite project, but no longer supported.
* Epiphany, until version 2.26.3, disabled with switch to WebKit
* WebPositive, a WebKit-based browser used in the Haiku operating system
* libwww, versions 1.0c to 5.4.1 , libwww is a discontinued API for internet applications. A modern fork is maintained in Lynx

Browsers with no Gopher native support can still access servers using one of the available Gopher to HTTP gateways or proxy server that converts Gopher menus into HTML; known proxies are the Floodgap Public Gopher proxy and Gopher Proxy. Similarly, certain server packages such as GN and PyGopherd have built-in Gopher to HTTP interfaces. Squid Proxy software gateways any codice_1 URL to HTTP content, enabling any browser or web agent to access gopher content easily.

For Mozilla Firefox and SeaMonkey, Overbite extensions extend Gopher browsing and support the current versions of the browsers (Firefox Quantum v ≥57 and equivalent versions of SeaMonkey):
* OverbiteWX redirects codice_1 URLs to a proxy;
* OverbiteNX adds native-like support;
* for Firefox up to 56.*, and equivalent versions of SeaMonkey, OverbiteFF adds native-like support, but it is no longer maintained
OverbiteWX includes support for accessing Gopher servers not on port 70 using a whitelist and for CSO/ph queries. OverbiteFF always uses port 70.
For Chromium and Google Chrome, Burrow is available. It redirects codice_1 URLs to a proxy. In the past an Overbite proxy-based extension for these browsers was available but is no longer maintained and does not work with the current (&gt;23) releases.
For Konqueror, Kio gopher is available.

As the bandwidth-sparing simple interface of Gopher can be a good match for mobile phones and personal digital assistants (PDAs), the early 2010s saw a renewed interest in native Gopher clients for popular smartphones.

Gopher popularity was at its height at a time when there were still many equally competing computer architectures and operating systems. As a result, there are several Gopher clients available for Acorn RISC OS, AmigaOS, Atari MiNT, Conversational Monitor System (CMS), DOS, classic Mac OS, MVS, NeXT, OS/2 Warp, most Unix-like operating systems, VMS, Windows 3.x, and Windows 9x. GopherVR was a client designed for 3D visualization, and there is even a Gopher client in MOO. Most such clients are hard-coded to work on Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) port 70.

==Server software==
Because the protocol is trivial to implement in a basic fashion, there are many server packages still available, and some are still maintained.

<text>A general election is an electoral process to choose most or all members of an elected body, typically a legislature. They are distinct from by-elections, which fill a seat that has become vacant between general elections. In most systems, a general election is a regularly scheduled election, typically including members of a legislature, and sometimes other officers such as a directly elected president. General elections may also take place at the same time as local, state/autonomous region, European Parliament, and other elections, where applicable. For example, on 25 May 2014, Belgian voters elected their national parliament, 21 members of the European Parliament, and regional parliaments.

In the United States, &quot;general election&quot; has a slightly different, but related meaning: the ordinary electoral competition following the selection of candidates in the primary election.

==United Kingdom==
The term &quot;general election&quot; in the United Kingdom often refers to the elections held on the same day in all constituencies of their members of Parliament (MPs) to the House of Commons.

Historically, English and later British general elections took place over a period of several weeks, with individual constituencies holding polling on different days. However, from the 1918 election onwards, the elections in all constituencies have been held on the same day. There has been a convention since the 1930s that general elections in Britain should take place on a Thursday; the last general election to take place on any other weekday was that of 1931.

Under the terms of the Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011, in force until March 2022, the period between one general election and the next was fixed at five years, unless the House of Commons passed one of the following:
* A motion of no confidence in the Government sooner than that, and did not pass a motion of confidence in a new Government within fourteen days
* A motion, approved by two-thirds of its members, resolving that a general election should take place sooner
* A proposal from the prime minister to reschedule an election mandated by the Act to no later than two months after the original date

Although not provided for in the Fixed-term Parliaments Act, an early election could also be brought about by an act of parliament specifically calling for a general election, which (unlike the second option above) only required a simple majority. This was the mechanism used to precipitate the December 2019 election, when the Early Parliamentary General Election Act 2019 was enacted.

The Fixed-term Parliaments Act was repealed by the Dissolution and Calling of Parliament Act 2022.

The term &quot;general election&quot; is also used in the United Kingdom to refer to elections to any democratically elected body in which all members are up for election. Section 2 of the Scotland Act 1998, for example, specifically refers to ordinary elections to the Scottish Parliament as general elections.

== U S ==
In U.S. politics, general elections are elections held at any level (e.g. city, county, congressional district, state) that typically involve competition between at least two parties. General elections occur every two to six years (depending on the positions being filled, with most positions good for four years) and include the presidential election. &quot;General election&quot; does not refer to special elections, which fill out positions prematurely vacated by the previous office holder.

Major general elections are as follows: 

# The President and Vice President are elected once every four years (2016, 2020, 2024, 2028, etc.)
# Representatives in the House of Representatives serve two-year terms, and so there are elections for representatives every two years (midterm elections, and during the same year as the Presidency: 2020, 2022, 2024, 2026, etc.)
# Senators serve six-year terms, but their terms are staggered. Throughout the US, a third of the senate will be up for election every midterm and during the Presidential election year.

The term &quot;general election&quot; is distinguished from primaries or caucuses, which are intra-party elections meant to select a party&#x27;s official candidate for a particular race. Thus, if a primary is meant to elect a party&#x27;s candidate for the position-in-question, a general election is meant to elect who occupies the position itself. Presidential primaries happen several months before the general election, though not all states hold primaries.

In the Louisiana the expression &quot;general election&quot; means the runoff election which occurs between the two highest candidates as determined by the jungle primary.

<text>The genotype of an organism is its complete set of genetic material. Genotype can also be used to refer to the alleles or variants an individual carries in a particular gene or genetic location. The number of alleles an individual can have in a specific gene depends on the number of copies of each chromosome found in that species, also referred to as ploidy. In diploid species like humans, two full sets of chromosomes are present, meaning each individual has two alleles for any given gene. If both alleles are the same, the genotype is referred to as homozygous. If the alleles are different, the genotype is referred to as heterozygous.

Genotype contributes to phenotype, the observable traits and characteristics in an individual or organism. The degree to which genotype affects phenotype depends on the trait. For example, the petal color in a pea plant is exclusively determined by genotype. The petals can be purple or white depending on the alleles present in the pea plant. However, other traits are only partially influenced by genotype. These traits are often called complex traits because they are influenced by additional factors, such as environmental and epigenetic factors. Not all individuals with the same genotype look or act the same way because appearance and behavior are modified by environmental and growing conditions. Likewise, not all organisms that look alike necessarily have the same genotype.

The term &quot;genotype&quot; was coined by the Danish botanist Wilhelm Johannsen in 1903.

== Phenotype ==
Any given gene will usually cause an observable change in an organism, known as the phenotype. The terms genotype and phenotype are distinct for at least two reasons:
* To distinguish the source of an observer&#x27;s knowledge (one can know about genotype by observing DNA; one can know about phenotype by observing outward appearance of an organism).
* Genotype and phenotype are not always directly correlated. Some genes only express a given phenotype in certain environmental conditions. Conversely, some phenotypes could be the result of multiple genotypes. The genotype is commonly mixed up with the phenotype which describes the result of both the genetic and the environmental factors giving the observed expression (e.g. blue eyes, hair color, or various hereditary diseases).

A simple example to illustrate genotype as distinct from phenotype is the flower colour in pea plants (see Gregor Mendel). There are three available genotypes, PP (homozygous dominant), Pp (heterozygous), and pp (homozygous recessive). All three have different genotypes but the first two have the same phenotype (purple) as distinct from the third (white).

A more technical example to illustrate genotype is the single-nucleotide polymorphism or SNP. A SNP occurs when corresponding sequences of DNA from different individuals differ at one DNA base, for example where the sequence AAGCCTA changes to AAGCTTA. This contains two alleles : C and T. SNPs typically have three genotypes, denoted generically AA Aa and aa. In the example above, the three genotypes would be CC, CT and TT. Other types of genetic marker, such as microsatellites, can have more than two alleles, and thus many different genotypes.

Penetrance is the proportion of individuals showing a specified genotype in their phenotype under a given set of environmental conditions.

== Mendelian inheritance ==
Traits that are determined exclusively by genotype are typically inherited in a Mendelian pattern. These laws of inheritance were described extensively by Gregor Mendel, who performed experiments with pea plants to determine how traits were passed on from generation to generation. He studied phenotypes that were easily observed, such as plant height, petal color, or seed shape. He was able to observe that if he crossed two true-breeding plants with distinct phenotypes, all the offspring would have the same phenotype. For example, when he crossed a tall plant with a short plant, all the resulting plants would be tall. However, when he self-fertilized the plants that resulted, about 1/4 of the second generation would be short. He concluded that some traits were dominant, such as tall height, and others were recessive, like short height. Though Mendel was not aware at the time, each phenotype he studied was controlled by a single gene with two alleles. In the case of plant height, one allele caused the plants to be tall, and the other caused plants to be short. When the tall allele was present, the plant would be tall, even if the plant was heterozygous. In order for the plant to be short, it had to be homozygous for the recessive allele.

One way this can be illustrated is using a Punnett square. In a Punnett square, the genotypes of the parents are placed on the outside. An uppercase letter is typically used to represent the dominant allele, and a lowercase letter is used to represent the recessive allele. The possible genotypes of the offspring can then be determined by combining the parent genotypes. In the example on the right, both parents are heterozygous, with a genotype of Bb. The offspring can inherit a dominant allele from each parent, making them homozygous with a genotype of BB. The offspring can inherit a dominant allele from one parent and a recessive allele from the other parent, making them heterozygous with a genotype of Bb. Finally, the offspring could inherit a recessive allele from each parent, making them homozygous with a genotype of bb. Plants with the BB and Bb genotypes will look the same, since the B allele is dominant. The plant with the bb genotype will have the recessive trait.

These inheritance patterns can also be applied to hereditary diseases or conditions in humans or animals. Some conditions are inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, meaning individuals with the condition typically have an affected parent as well. A classic pedigree for an autosomal dominant condition shows affected individuals in every generation. Other conditions are inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, where affected individuals do not typically have an affected parent. Since each parent must have a copy of the recessive allele in order to have an affected offspring, the parents are referred to as carriers of the condition.

In autosomal conditions, the sex of the offspring does not play a role in their risk of being affected. In sex-linked conditions, the sex of the offspring affects their chances of having the condition. In humans, females inherit two X chromosomes, one from each parent, while males inherit an X chromosome from their mother and a Y chromosome from their father. X-linked dominant conditions can be distinguished from autosomal dominant conditions in pedigrees by the lack of transmission from fathers to sons, since affected fathers only pass their X chromosome to their daughters. In X-linked recessive conditions, males are typically affected more commonly because they are hemizygous, with only one X chromosome. In females, the presence of a second X chromosome will prevent the condition from appearing. Females are therefore carriers of the condition and can pass the trait on to their sons.

Mendelian patterns of inheritance can be complicated by additional factors. Some diseases show incomplete penetrance, meaning not all individuals with the disease-causing allele develop signs or symptoms of the disease. Penetrance can also be age-dependent, meaning signs or symptoms of disease are not visible until later in life. For example, Huntington disease is an autosomal dominant condition, but up to 25% of individuals with the affected genotype will not develop symptoms until after age 50. Another factor that can complicate Mendelian inheritance patterns is variable expressivity, in which individuals with the same genotype show different signs or symptoms of disease. For example, individuals with polydactyly can have a variable number of extra digits.

== Non-Mendelian inheritance ==
Many traits are not inherited in a Mendelian fashion, but have more complex patterns of inheritance.

=== Incomplete dominance ===
For some traits, neither allele is completely dominant. Heterozygotes often have an appearance somewhere in between those of homozygotes. For example, a cross between true-breeding red and white &quot;Mirabilis jalapa&quot; results in pink flowers.

=== Codominance ===
Codominance refers to traits in which both alleles are expressed in the offspring in approximately equal amounts. A classic example is the ABO blood group system in humans, where both the A and B alleles are expressed when they are present. Individuals with the AB genotype have both A and B proteins expressed on their red blood cells.

=== Epistasis ===
Epistasis is when the phenotype of one gene is affected by one or more other genes. This is often through some sort of masking effect of one gene on the other. For example, the &quot;A&quot; gene codes for hair color, a dominant &quot;A&quot; allele codes for brown hair, and a recessive &quot;a&quot; allele codes for blonde hair, but a separate &quot;B&quot; gene controls hair growth, and a recessive &quot;b&quot; allele causes baldness. If the individual has the BB or Bb genotype, then they produce hair and the hair color phenotype can be observed, but if the individual has a bb genotype, then the person is bald which masks the A gene entirely.

=== Polygenic traits ===
A polygenic trait is one whose phenotype is dependent on the additive effects of multiple genes. The contributions of each of these genes are typically small and add up to a final phenotype with a large amount of variation. A well studied example of this is the number of sensory bristles on a fly. These types of additive effects is also the explanation for the amount of variation in human eye color.

== Genotyping ==

Genotyping refers to the method used to determine an individual&#x27;s genotype. There are a variety of techniques that can be used to assess genotype. The genotyping method typically depends on what information is being sought. Many techniques initially require amplification of the DNA sample, which is commonly done using PCR.

Some techniques are designed to investigate specific SNPs or alleles in a particular gene or set of genes, such as whether an individual is a carrier for a particular condition. This can be done via a variety of techniques, including allele specific oligonucleotide (ASO) probes or DNA sequencing. Tools such as multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification can also be used to look for duplications or deletions of genes or gene sections. Other techniques are meant to assess a large number of SNPs across the genome, such as SNP arrays. This type of technology is commonly used for genome-wide association studies.

Large-scale techniques to assess the entire genome are also available. This includes karyotyping to determine the number of chromosomes an individual has and chromosomal microarrays to assess for large duplications or deletions in the chromosome. More detailed information can be determined using exome sequencing, which provides the specific sequence of all DNA in the coding region of the genome, or whole genome sequencing, which sequences the entire genome including non-coding regions.

== Genotype encoding ==
In linear models, the genotypes can be encoded in different manners. Let us consider a biallelic locus with two possible alleles, encoded by formula_1 and formula_2. We consider formula_2 to correspond to the dominant allele to the reference allele formula_1. The following table details the different encoding.

<doc id="12798" wikidata="Q166675" url="?curid=12798" title="George William, Elector of Brandenburg">
<text>George William (; 13 November 1595 – 1 December 1640), of the Hohenzollern dynasty, was Margrave and Elector of Brandenburg and Duke of Prussia from 1619 until his death. His reign was marked by ineffective governance during the Thirty Years&#x27; War. He was the father of Frederick William, the &quot;Great Elector&quot;.

==Biography==

Born in Cölln on the Spree (today part of Berlin), George William was the son of John Sigismund, Elector of Brandenburg and Anna of Prussia. His maternal grandfather was Albert Frederick, Duke of Prussia. In 1616, he married Elisabeth Charlotte of the Palatinate. Their only son Frederick William would later be known as the &quot;Great Elector&quot;. Of his two daughters, the eldest, Louise Charlotte, married Jacob Kettler, Duke of Courland, and the younger, Hedwig Sophie, married William VI, Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel.

In 1619, George William inherited the Margravate of Brandenburg and the Duchy of Prussia, then a vassal of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, although his ownership was not confirmed by Sigismund III Vasa until September 1621. He proved a weak and ineffective ruler in a very difficult period of history; possession of Prussia involved him in the 1621 to 1625 Polish–Swedish War, since Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden was married to his sister Maria Eleonora.

During the Thirty Years&#x27; War, the Calvinist George William tried to remain neutral in the contest between the Catholic Emperor Ferdinand II, and his mostly Lutheran opponents. When the war shifted to northern Germany in 1625, this did not protect his lands from being looted by Imperial troops, and he was forced to take sides when Gustavus intervened in the Empire in 1630. However, this simply replaced one set of plunderers with another; Gustavus could not support so large an army, and his unpaid and unfed troops became increasingly mutinous and ill-disciplined.

After Gustavus was killed at Lützen in November 1632, George William joined the Swedish-backed Heilbronn League, until defeat at Nördlingen on 6 September 1634. Following the 1635 Peace of Prague, the League was dissolved, although by now Brandenburg&#x27;s population had been decimated by the war.

Leaving his Catholic and pro-Imperial chief minister Schwarzenberg to run the government, George William withdrew in 1637 to the relatively untouched region of Prussia, where he lived in retirement until his death at Königsberg in 1640. He was succeeded by his far more accomplished son Frederick William.

<text>Graphic design is a profession, academic discipline and applied art whose activity consists in projecting visual communications intended to transmit specific messages to social groups, with specific objectives. Graphic design is an interdisciplinary branch of design and of the fine arts. Its practice involves creativity, innovation and lateral thinking using manual or digital tools, where it is usual to use text and graphics to communicate visually.

The role of the graphic designer in the communication process is that of the encoder or interpreter of the message. They work on the interpretation, ordering, and presentation of visual messages. Usually, graphic design uses the aesthetics of typography and the compositional arrangement of the text, ornamentation, and imagery to convey ideas, feelings, and attitudes beyond what language alone expresses. The design work can be based on a customer&#x27;s demand, a demand that ends up being established linguistically, either orally or in writing, that is, that graphic design transforms a linguistic message into a graphic manifestation.
Graphic design has, as a field of application, different areas of knowledge focused on any visual communication system. For example, it can be applied in advertising strategies, or it can also be applied in the aviation world or space exploration. In this sense, in some countries graphic design is related as only associated with the production of sketches and drawings, this is incorrect, since visual communication is a small part of a huge range of types and classes where it can be applied.

With origins in Antiquity and the Middle Ages, graphic design as applied art was initially linked to the boom of the rise of printing in Europe in the 15th century and the growth of consumer culture in the Industrial Revolution. From there it emerged as a distinct profession in the West, closely associated with advertising in the 19th century and its evolution allowed its consolidation in the 20th century. Given the rapid and massive growth in information exchange today, the demand for experienced designers is greater than ever, particularly because of the development of new technologies and the need to pay attention to human factors beyond the competence of the engineers who develop them.

==Terminology==
The term &quot;graphic design&quot; makes an early appearance in a 4 July 1908 issue (volume 9, number 27) of &quot;Organized Labor&quot;, a publication of the Labor Unions of San Francisco, in an article about technical education for printers:
An Enterprising Trades Union
… The admittedly high standard of intelligence which prevails among printers is an assurance that with the elemental principles of design at their finger ends many of them will grow in knowledge and develop into specialists in graphic design and decorating. …
A decade later, the 1917–1918 course catalog of the California School of Arts &amp; Crafts advertised a course titled Graphic Design and Lettering, which replaced one called Advanced Design and Lettering. Both classes were taught by Frederick Meyer.

==History==

In both its lengthy history and in the relatively recent explosion of visual communication in the 20th and 21st centuries, the distinction between advertising, art, graphic design and fine art has disappeared. They share many elements, theories, principles, practices, languages and sometimes the same benefactor or client. In advertising, the ultimate objective is the sale of goods and services. In graphic design, &quot;the essence is to give order to information, form to ideas, expression, and feeling to artifacts that document the human experience.&quot;

The definition of the graphic designer profession is relatively recent concerning its preparation, activity, and objectives. Although there is no consensus on an exact date when graphic design emerged, some date it back to the Interwar period. Others understand that it began to be identified as such by the late 19th century.

It can be argued that graphic communications with specific purposes have their origins in Paleolithic cave paintings and the birth of written language in the third millennium BCE. However, the differences in working methods, auxiliary sciences, and required training are such that it is not possible to clearly identify the current graphic designer with prehistoric man, the 15th-century xylographer, or the lithographer of 1890.

The diversity of opinions stems from some considering any graphic manifestation as a product of graphic design, while others only recognize those that arise as a result of the application of an industrial production model—visual manifestations that have been &quot;projected&quot; to address various needs: productive, symbolic, ergonomic, contextual, among others.

Nevertheless, the evolution of graphic design as a practice and profession has been closely linked to technological innovations, social needs, and the visual imagination of professionals. Graphic design has been practiced in various forms throughout history; in fact, good examples of graphic design date back to manuscripts from ancient China, Egypt, and Greece. As printing and book production developed in the 15th century, advances in graphic design continued over the subsequent centuries, with composers or typographers often designing pages according to established type.

By the late 19th century, graphic design emerged as a distinct profession in the West, partly due to the process of labor specialization that occurred there and partly due to the new technologies and business possibilities brought about by the Industrial Revolution. New production methods led to the separation of the design of a communication medium (such as a poster) from its actual production. Increasingly, throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries, advertising agencies, book publishers, and magazines hired art directors who organized all visual elements of communication and integrated them into a harmonious whole, creating an expression appropriate to the content. In 1922, typographer William A. Dwiggins coined the term graphic design to identify the emerging field.

Throughout the 20th century, the technology available to designers continued to advance rapidly, as did the artistic and commercial possibilities of design. The profession expanded greatly, and graphic designers created, among other things, magazine pages, book covers, posters, CD covers, postage stamps, packaging, brands, signs, advertisements, kinetic titles for TV programs and movies, and websites. By the early 21st century, graphic design had become a global profession as advanced technology and industry spread worldwide.

===Historical background===

In China, during the Tang dynasty (618–907) wood blocks were cut to print on textiles and later to reproduce Buddhist texts. A Buddhist scripture printed in 868 is the earliest known printed book. Beginning in the 11th century in China, longer scrolls and books were produced using movable type printing, making books widely available during the Song dynasty (960–1279).

In the mid-15th century in Mainz, Germany, Johannes Gutenberg developed a way to reproduce printed pages at a faster pace using movable type made with a new metal alloy that created a revolution in the dissemination of information.

===Nineteenth century===
In 1849, Henry Cole became one of the major forces in design education in Great Britain, informing the government of the importance of design in his &quot;Journal of Design and Manufactures&quot;. He organized the Great Exhibition as a celebration of modern industrial technology and Victorian design.

From 1891 to 1896, William Morris&#x27; Kelmscott Press was a leader in graphic design associated with the Arts and Crafts movement, creating hand-made books in medieval and Renaissance era style, in addition to wallpaper and textile designs. Morris&#x27; work, along with the rest of the Private Press movement, directly influenced Art Nouveau.

Will H. Bradley became one of the notable graphic designers in the late nineteenth-century due to creating art pieces in various Art Nouveau styles. Bradley created a number of designs as promotions for a literary magazine titled &quot;The Chap-Book&quot;.

===Twentieth century===
In 1917, Frederick H. Meyer, director and instructor at the California School of Arts and Crafts, taught a class entitled &quot;Graphic Design and Lettering&quot;. Raffe&#x27;s &quot;Graphic Design&quot;, published in 1927, was the first book to use &quot;Graphic Design&quot; in its title. In 1936, author and graphic designer Leon Friend published his book titled &quot;Graphic Design&quot; and it is known to be the first piece of literature to cover the topic extensively.

The signage in the London Underground is a classic design example of the modern era. Although he lacked artistic training, Frank Pick led the Underground Group design and publicity movement. The first Underground station signs were introduced in 1908 with a design of a solid red disk with a blue bar in the center and the name of the station. The station name was in white sans-serif letters. It was in 1916 when Pick used the expertise of Edward Johnston to design a new typeface for the Underground. Johnston redesigned the Underground sign and logo to include his typeface on the blue bar in the center of a red circle.

In the 1920s, Soviet constructivism applied &#x27;intellectual production&#x27; in different spheres of production. The movement saw individualistic art as useless in revolutionary Russia and thus moved towards creating objects for utilitarian purposes. They designed buildings, film and theater sets, posters, fabrics, clothing, furniture, logos, menus, etc.

Jan Tschichold codified the principles of modern typography in his 1928 book, &quot;New Typography&quot;. He later repudiated the philosophy he espoused in this book as fascistic, but it remained influential. Tschichold, Bauhaus typographers such as Herbert Bayer and László Moholy-Nagy and El Lissitzky greatly influenced graphic design. They pioneered production techniques and stylistic devices used throughout the twentieth century. The following years saw graphic design in the modern style gain widespread acceptance and application.

The professional graphic design industry grew in parallel with consumerism. This raised concerns and criticisms, notably from within the graphic design community with the First Things First manifesto. First launched by Ken Garland in 1964, it was re-published as the First Things First 2000 manifesto in 1999 in the magazine &quot;Emigre&quot; 51 stating &quot;We propose a reversal of priorities in favor of more useful, lasting and democratic forms of communication – a mindshift away from product marketing and toward the exploration and production of a new kind of meaning. The scope of debate is shrinking; it must expand. Consumerism is running uncontested; it must be challenged by other perspectives expressed, in part, through the visual languages and resources of design.&quot;

==Applications==

Graphic design can have many applications, from road signs to technical schematics and reference manuals. It is often used in branding products and elements of company identity such as logos, colors, packaging, labelling and text.

From scientific journals to news reporting, the presentation of opinions and facts is often improved with graphics and thoughtful compositions of visual information – known as information design. With the advent of the web, information designers with experience in interactive tools are increasingly used to illustrate the background to news stories. Information design can include Data and information visualization, which involves using programs to interpret and form data into a visually compelling presentation, and can be tied in with information graphics.

==Skills==
A graphic design project may involve the creative presentation of existing text, ornament, and images.

The &quot;process school&quot; is concerned with communication; it highlights the channels and media through which messages are transmitted and by which senders and receivers encode and decode these messages. The semiotic school treats a message as a construction of signs which through interaction with receivers, produces meaning; communication as an agent.

===Typography===
Typography includes type design, modifying type glyphs and arranging type. Type glyphs (characters) are created and modified using illustration techniques. Type arrangement is the selection of typefaces, point size, tracking (the space between all characters used), kerning (the space between two specific characters) and leading (line spacing).

Typography is performed by typesetters, compositors, typographers, graphic artists, art directors, and clerical workers. Until the digital age, typography was a specialized occupation. Certain fonts communicate or resemble stereotypical notions. For example, the 1942 Report is a font which types text akin to a typewriter or a vintage report.

===Page layout===
Page layout deals with the arrangement of elements (content) on a page, such as image placement, text layout and style. Page design has always been a consideration in printed material and more recently extended to displays such as web pages. Elements typically consist of type (text), images (pictures), and (with print media) occasionally place-holder graphics such as a dieline for elements that are not printed with ink such as die/laser cutting, foil stamping or blind embossing.

===Grids===
A grid serves as a method of arranging both space and information, allowing the reader to easily comprehend the overall project. Furthermore, a grid functions as a container for information and a means of establishing and maintaining order. Despite grids being utilized for centuries, many graphic designers associate them with Swiss design. The desire for order in the 1940s resulted in a highly systematic approach to visualizing information. However, grids were later regarded as tedious and uninteresting, earning the label of &quot;designersaur.&quot; Today, grids are once again considered crucial tools for professionals, whether they are novices or veterans.

==Tools==
In the mid-1980s desktop publishing and graphic art software applications introduced computer image manipulation and creation capabilities that had previously been manually executed. Computers enabled designers to instantly see the effects of layout or typographic changes, and to simulate the effects of traditional media. Traditional tools such as pencils can be useful even when computers are used for finalization; a designer or art director may sketch numerous concepts as part of the creative process. Styluses can be used with tablet computers to capture hand drawings digitally.

===Computers and software===
Designers disagree whether computers enhance the creative process. Some designers argue that computers allow them to explore multiple ideas quickly and in more detail than can be achieved by hand-rendering or paste-up. While other designers find the limitless choices from digital design can lead to paralysis or endless iterations with no clear outcome.

Most designers use a hybrid process that combines traditional and computer-based technologies. First, hand-rendered layouts are used to get approval to execute an idea, then the polished visual product is produced on a computer.

Graphic designers are expected to be proficient in software programs for image-making, typography and layout. Nearly all of the popular and &quot;industry standard&quot; software programs used by graphic designers since the early 1990s are products of Adobe Inc. Adobe Photoshop (a raster-based program for photo editing) and Adobe Illustrator (a vector-based program for drawing) are often used in the final stage. CorelDraw, a vector graphics editing software developed and marketed by Corel Corporation, is also used worldwide. Designers often use pre-designed raster images and vector graphics in their work from online design databases. Raster images may be edited in Adobe Photoshop, vector logos and illustrations in Adobe Illustrator and CorelDraw, and the final product assembled in one of the major page layout programs, such as Adobe InDesign, Serif PagePlus and QuarkXPress.

Many free and open-source programs are also used by both professionals and casual graphic designers. Inkscape uses Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) as its primary file format and allows importing and exporting other formats. Other open-source programs used include GIMP for photo-editing and image manipulation, Krita for digital painting, and Scribus for page layout.

===Print design===

A specialized branch of graphic design and historically its earliest form, print design involves creating visual content intended for reproduction on physical substrates such as silk, paper, and later, plastic, for mass communication and persuasion (e.g., marketing, governmental publishing, propaganda). Print design techniques have evolved over centuries, beginning with the invention of movable type by the Chinese alchemist Pi Sheng, later refined by the German inventor Johannes Gutenberg. Over time, methods such as lithography, screen printing, and offset printing have been developed, culminating in the contemporary use of digital presses that integrate traditional print techniques with modern digital technology.

===Interface design===

Since the advent of personal computers, many graphic designers have become involved in interface design, in an environment commonly referred to as a Graphical user interface (GUI). This has included web design and software design when end user-interactivity is a design consideration of the layout or interface. Combining visual communication skills with an understanding of user interaction and online branding, graphic designers often work with software developers and web developers to create the look and feel of a web site or software application. An important aspect of interface design is icon design.

===User experience design===

User experience design (UX) is the study, analysis, and development of creating products that provide meaningful and relevant experiences to users. This involves the creation of the entire process of acquiring and integrating the product, including aspects of branding, design, usability, and function. UX design involves creating the interface and interactions for a website or application, and is considered both an act and an art. This profession requires a combination of skills, including visual design, social psychology, development, project management, and most importantly, empathy towards the end-users.

===Experiential graphic design===

Experiential graphic design is the application of communication skills to the built environment. This area of graphic design requires practitioners to understand physical installations that have to be manufactured and withstand the same environmental conditions as buildings. As such, it is a cross-disciplinary collaborative process involving designers, fabricators, city planners, architects, manufacturers and construction teams.

Experiential graphic designers try to solve problems that people encounter while interacting with buildings and space (also called environmental graphic design). Examples of practice areas for environmental graphic designers are wayfinding, placemaking, branded environments, exhibitions and museum displays, public installations and digital environments.

==Occupations==


Graphic design career paths cover all parts of the creative spectrum and often overlap. Workers perform specialized tasks, such as design services, publishing, advertising and public relations. As of 2023, median pay was $58,910 per year. The main job titles within the industry are often country specific. They can include graphic designer, art director, creative director, animator and entry level production artist. Depending on the industry served, the responsibilities may have different titles such as &quot;DTP associate&quot; or &quot;Graphic Artist&quot;. The responsibilities may involve specialized skills such as illustration, photography, animation, visual effects or interactive design.

Employment in design of online projects was expected to increase by 35% by 2026, while employment in traditional media, such as newspaper and book design, expect to go down by 22%. Graphic designers will be expected to constantly learn new techniques, programs, and methods.

Graphic designers can work within companies devoted specifically to the industry, such as design consultancies or branding agencies, others may work within publishing, marketing or other communications companies. Especially since the introduction of personal computers, many graphic designers work as in-house designers in non-design oriented organizations. Graphic designers may also work freelance, working on their own terms, prices, ideas, etc.

A graphic designer typically reports to the art director, creative director or senior media creative. As a designer becomes more senior, they spend less time designing and more time leading and directing other designers on broader creative activities, such as brand development and corporate identity development. They are often expected to interact more directly with clients, for example taking and interpreting briefs.

===Crowdsourcing in graphic design===

Jeff Howe of &quot;Wired Magazine&quot; first used the term &quot;crowdsourcing&quot; in his 2006 article, &quot;The Rise of Crowdsourcing.&quot; It spans such creative domains as graphic design, architecture, apparel design, writing, illustration, and others. Tasks may be assigned to individuals or a group and may be categorized as convergent or divergent. An example of a divergent task is generating alternative designs for a poster. An example of a convergent task is selecting one poster design. Companies, startups, small businesses and entrepreneurs have all benefitted from design crowdsourcing since it helps them source great graphic designs at a fraction of the budget they used to spend before. Getting a logo design through crowdsourcing being one of the most common. Major companies that operate in the design crowdsourcing space are generally referred to as design contest sites.]

== Role of graphic design ==
Graphic design is essential for advertising, branding, and marketing, influencing how people act. Good graphic design builds strong, recognizable brands, communicates messages clearly, and shapes how consumers see and react to things.

One way that graphic design influences consumer behavior is through the use of visual elements, such as color, typography, and imagery. Studies have shown that certain colors can evoke specific emotions and behaviors in consumers, and that typography can influence how information is perceived and remembered. For example, serif fonts are often associated with tradition and elegance, while sans-serif fonts are seen as modern and minimalistic. These factors can all impact the way consumers perceive a brand and its messaging.

Another way that graphic design impacts consumer behavior is through its ability to communicate complex information in a clear and accessible way. For example, infographics and data visualizations can help to distill complex information into a format that is easy to understand and engaging for consumers. This can help to build trust and credibility with consumers, and encourage them to take action.

== Ethical consideration in graphic design ==
Ethics are an important consideration in graphic design, particularly when it comes to accurately representing information and avoiding harmful stereotypes. Graphic designers have a responsibility to ensure that their work is truthful, accurate, and free from any misleading or deceptive elements. This requires a commitment to honesty, integrity, and transparency in all aspects of the design process.

One of the key ethical considerations in graphic design is the responsibility to accurately represent information. This means ensuring that any claims or statements made in advertising or marketing materials are true and supported by evidence. For example, a company should not use misleading statistics to promote their product or service, or make false claims about its benefits. Graphic designers must take care to accurately represent information in all visual elements, such as graphs, charts, and images, and avoid distorting or misrepresenting data.

Another important ethical consideration in graphic design is the need to avoid harmful stereotypes. This means avoiding any images or messaging that perpetuate negative or harmful stereotypes based on race, gender, religion, or other characteristics. Graphic designers should strive to create designs that are inclusive and respectful of all individuals and communities, and avoid reinforcing negative attitudes or biases.

== Future of graphic design ==
The future of graphic design is likely to be heavily influenced by emerging technologies and social trends. Advancements in areas such as artificial intelligence, virtual and augmented reality, and automation are likely to transform the way that graphic designers work and create designs. Social trends, such as a greater focus on sustainability and inclusivity, are also likely to impact the future of graphic design.

One area where emerging technologies are likely to have a significant impact on graphic design is in the automation of certain tasks. Machine learning algorithms, for example, can analyze large datasets and create designs based on patterns and trends, freeing up designers to focus on more complex and creative tasks. Virtual and augmented reality technologies may also allow designers to create immersive and interactive experiences for users, blurring the lines between the digital and physical worlds. Artificial intelligence has also led to many challenges within the world of graphic design. Some of those challenges include maintaining brand authenticity, ensuring quality, issues of bias, and preserving creative control.
Social trends are also likely to shape the future of graphic design. As consumers become more conscious of environmental issues, for example, there may be a greater demand for designs that prioritize sustainability and minimize waste. Similarly, there is likely to be a growing focus on inclusivity and diversity in design, with designers seeking to create designs that are accessible and representative of a wide range of individuals and communities.

<text>The Great Rift Valley () is a series of contiguous geographic depressions, approximately 6,000 or in total length, the definition varying between sources, that runs from the southern Turkish Hatay Province in Asia, through the Red Sea, to Mozambique in Southeast Africa. While the name remains in some usages, it is rarely used in geology as it is considered an imprecise merging of rift and fault systems.

This valley extends southward from Western Asia into the eastern part of Africa, where several deep, elongated lakes, called ribbon lakes, exist on the rift valley floor, Lake Malawi and Lake Tanganyika being two such examples. The region has a unique ecosystem and contains a number of Africa&#x27;s wildlife parks.

The term Great Rift Valley is most often used to refer to the valley of the East African Rift, the divergent plate boundary which extends from the Afar triple junction southward through eastern Africa, and is in the process of splitting the African plate into two new and separate plates. Geologists generally refer to these evolving plates as the Nubian plate and the Somali plate.

==Theoretical extent==
Today these rifts and faults are seen as distinct, although connected. Originally, the Great Rift Valley was thought to be a single feature that extended from Lebanon in the north to Mozambique in the south, where it constitutes one of two distinct physiographic provinces of the East African mountains. It included what today is called the Lebanese section of the Dead Sea Transform (Turkey to Straits of Tiran), the Jordan Rift Valley (geographic term for section including entire course of the Jordan River, the Dead Sea, and the Arabah Valley), Red Sea Rift, and the East African Rift. These rifts and faults are considered to having been formed 35 million years ago.

==Asia==
The northernmost part of the Rift corresponds to the central section of what is today called the Dead Sea Transform (DST) or Rift. This midsection of the DST forms the Beqaa Valley in Lebanon, separating the Mount Lebanon range from the Anti-Lebanon Mountains. Further south it is known as the Hula Valley separating the Galilee mountains and the Golan Heights.

The Jordan River begins here and flows southward through Lake Hula into the Sea of Galilee in Israel. The Rift then continues south through the Jordan Rift Valley into the Dead Sea, on the Israeli-Jordanian border. From the Dead Sea southwards, the Rift is occupied by the Wadi Arabah, then the Gulf of Aqaba, and then the Red Sea.

Off the southern tip of Sinai in the Red Sea, the Dead Sea Transform meets the Red Sea Rift which runs the length of the Red Sea. The Red Sea Rift comes ashore to meet the East African Rift and the Aden Ridge, in the Afar Depression of East Africa. The junction of these three rifts is called the Afar triple junction.

==Africa==
 

The East African Rift follows the Red Sea to the end before turning inland into the Ethiopian highlands, dividing the country into two large and adjacent but separate mountainous regions. In Kenya, Uganda, and the fringes of South Sudan, the Great Rift runs along two separate branches that are joined to each other only at their southern end, in Southern Tanzania along its border with Zambia. The two branches are called the Western Rift Valley and the Eastern Rift Valley.

The Western Rift, also called the Albertine Rift, is bordered by some of the highest mountains in Africa, including the Virunga Mountains, Mitumba Mountains, and Ruwenzori Range. It contains the Rift Valley lakes, which include some of the deepest lakes in the world (up to deep at Lake Tanganyika).

Much of this area lies within the boundaries of national parks, such as Virunga National Park in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Rwenzori National Park and Queen Elizabeth National Park in Uganda, and Volcanoes National Park in Rwanda. Lake Victoria is considered to be part of the rift valley system although it actually lies between the two branches. All of the African Great Lakes were formed as the result of the rift, and most lie in territories within the rift.

In Kenya, the valley is deepest to the north of Nairobi. As the lakes in the Eastern Rift have no output to the sea and tend to be shallow, they have a high mineral content as the evaporation of water leaves the salts behind. For example, Lake Magadi has high concentrations of soda (sodium carbonate) and Lake Elmenteita, Lake Bogoria, and Lake Nakuru are all strongly alkaline, while the freshwater springs supplying Lake Naivasha are essential to support its current biological variety.

The southern section of the Rift Valley includes Lake Malawi, the third-deepest freshwater body in the world, which reaches in depth and separates the Nyassa plateau of Northern Mozambique from Malawi. The rift extends southwards from Lake Malawi as the valley of the Shire River, which flows from the lake into the Zambezi River. The rift continues south of the Zambezi as the Urema Valley of central Mozambique.

<doc id="12804" wikidata="Q43989" url="?curid=12804" title="Grigori Rasputin">
<text>Grigori Yefimovich Rasputin (; ; – ) was a Russian mystic and faith healer. He is best known for having befriended the imperial family of Nicholas II, the last Emperor of Russia, through whom he gained considerable influence in the final years of the Russian Empire.

Rasputin was born to a family of peasants in the Siberian village of Pokrovskoye, located within Tyumensky Uyezd in Tobolsk Governorate (present-day Yarkovsky District in Tyumen Oblast). He had a religious conversion experience after embarking on a pilgrimage to a monastery in 1897 and has been described as a monk or as a &quot;strannik&quot; (wanderer or pilgrim), though he held no official position in the Russian Orthodox Church. In 1903 or in the winter of 1904–1905, he travelled to Saint Petersburg and captivated a number of religious and social leaders, eventually becoming a prominent figure in Russian society. In November 1905, Rasputin met Nicholas II and his empress consort, Alexandra Feodorovna.

In late 1906, Rasputin began acting as a faith healer for Nicholas&#x27; and Alexandra&#x27;s only son, Alexei Nikolaevich, who suffered from haemophilia. He was a divisive figure at court, seen by some Russians as a mystic, visionary and prophet, and by others as a religious charlatan. The extent of Rasputin&#x27;s power reached an all-time high in 1915, when Nicholas left Saint Petersburg to oversee the Imperial Russian Army as it was engaged in the First World War. In his absence, Rasputin and Alexandra consolidated their influence across the Russian Empire. However, as Russian military defeats mounted on the Eastern Front, both figures became increasingly unpopular, and in the early morning of , Rasputin was assassinated by a group of conservative Russian noblemen who opposed his influence over the imperial family.

Historians often suggest that Rasputin&#x27;s scandalous and sinister reputation helped discredit the Tsarist government, thus precipitating the overthrow of the House of Romanov shortly after his assassination. Accounts of his life and influence were often based on common rumors; he remains a mysterious and captivating figure in popular culture.

==Early life==
Grigori Yefimovich Rasputin was born a peasant in the small village of Pokrovskoye, along the Tura River in the Tobolsk Governorate (now Tyumen Oblast) in the Russian Empire. According to official records, he was born on and christened the following day. He was named for St. Gregory of Nyssa, whose feast was celebrated on 10 January.

There are few records of Rasputin&#x27;s parents. His father, Yefim (1842 – 1916), was a peasant farmer and church elder who had been born in Pokrovskoye and married Rasputin&#x27;s mother, Anna Parshukova (c. 1840 – 1906), in 1863. Yefim also worked as a government courier, ferrying people and goods between Tobolsk and Tyumen. The couple had seven other children, all of whom died in infancy and early childhood; there may have been a ninth child, Feodosiya. According to historian Joseph T. Fuhrmann, Rasputin was certainly close to Feodosiya and was godfather to her children, but &quot;the records that have survived do not permit us to say more than that&quot;.

According to historian Douglas Smith, Rasputin&#x27;s youth and early adulthood are &quot;a black hole about which we know almost nothing&quot;, though the lack of reliable sources and information did not stop others from fabricating stories about Rasputin&#x27;s parents and his youth after his rise to prominence. Historians agree, however, that like most Siberian peasants, including his mother and father, Rasputin was not formally educated and remained illiterate well into his early adulthood. Local archival records suggest that he had a somewhat unruly youth—possibly involving drinking, small thefts and disrespect for local authorities—but contain no evidence of his being charged with stealing horses, blasphemy or bearing false witness, all major crimes later imputed to him as a young man.

In 1886, Rasputin traveled to Abalak, some 250 km east-northeast of Tyumen and 2,800 km east of Moscow, where he met a peasant girl named Praskovya Dubrovina. After a courtship of several months, they married in February 1887. Praskovya remained in Pokrovskoye throughout Rasputin&#x27;s later travels and rise to prominence, and remained devoted to him until his death. The couple had seven children, though only three survived to adulthood: Dmitry (b. 1895), Maria (b. 1898) and Varvara (b. 1900).

==Religious conversion==
In 1897, Rasputin developed a renewed interest in religion and left Pokrovskoye to go on a pilgrimage. His reasons are unclear; according to some sources, he left the village to escape punishment for his role in horse theft. Other sources suggest Rasputin had a vision of the Virgin Mary or of St. Simeon of Verkhoturye, while still others suggest that his pilgrimage was inspired by a young theological student, Melity Zaborovsky. Whatever his reasons, Rasputin cast off his old life: he was 28 years old, married ten years, with an infant son and another child on the way. According to Smith, his decision &quot;could only have been occasioned by some sort of emotional or spiritual crisis&quot;.

Rasputin had undertaken earlier, shorter pilgrimages to the Holy Znamensky Monastery at Abalak and to Tobolsk&#x27;s cathedral, but his visit to the St. Nicholas Monastery at Verkhoturye in 1897 transformed him. There, he met and was &quot;profoundly humbled&quot; by a &quot;starets&quot; (elder) known as Makary. Rasputin may have spent several months at Verkhoturye, and it was perhaps here that he learned to read and write. However, he later claimed that some of the monks at Verkhotuyre engaged in homosexuality and criticized monastic life as too coercive. He returned to Pokrovskoye a changed man, looking disheveled and behaving differently. He became a vegetarian, swore off alcohol, and prayed and sang much more fervently than he had in the past.

Rasputin spent the years that followed as a &quot;strannik&quot; (a holy wanderer or pilgrim), leaving Pokrovskoye for months or even years at a time to wander the country and visit a variety of holy sites. It is possible he wandered as far as Mount Athos—the center of Eastern Orthodox monastic life—in 1900.

By the early 1900s, Rasputin had developed a small circle of followers, primarily family members and other local peasants, who prayed with him on Sundays and other holy days when he was in Pokrovskoye. Building a makeshift chapel in Yefim&#x27;s root cellar—Rasputin was still living within his father&#x27;s household at the time—the group held secret prayer meetings there. These meetings were the subject of some suspicion and hostility from the village priest and other villagers. It was rumored that female followers were ceremonially washing Rasputin before each meeting, that the group sang strange songs, and even that Rasputin had joined the Khlysty, a religious sect whose ecstatic rituals were rumored to include self-flagellation and sexual orgies. According to Fuhrmann, however, &quot;repeated investigations failed to establish that Rasputin was ever a member of the sect&quot;, and rumors that he was a Khlyst appear to have been unfounded.

==Rise to prominence==

Word of Rasputin&#x27;s activity and charisma began to spread in Siberia during the early 1900s. At some point during 1904 or 1905, he traveled to the city of Kazan, where he acquired a reputation as a wise &quot;starets&quot; who could help people resolve their spiritual crises and anxieties. Despite rumors that Rasputin was having sex with female followers, he made a favorable impression on several local religious leaders. Among these were Archimandrite Andrei and Bishop Chrysthanos, who gave Rasputin a letter of recommendation to Bishop Sergei, the rector of the theological seminary at the Alexander Nevsky Monastery, and arranged for him to travel to Saint Petersburg.

Upon arriving at the Alexander Nevsky Lavra, Rasputin was introduced to church leaders, including Archimandrite Theofan, inspector of the theological seminary, who was well-connected in Saint Petersburg society and later served as confessor to the imperial family. Theofan was so impressed with Rasputin that he invited him to stay in his home; he went on to become one of Rasputin&#x27;s most important friends in Saint Petersburg, gaining him entry to many of the influential &quot;salons&quot; where the local aristocracy gathered for religious discussions. It was through these meetings that Rasputin attracted some of his early and influential followers—many of whom would later turn against him.

Alternative religious movements such as spiritualism and theosophy had become popular among Saint Petersburg&#x27;s aristocracy before Rasputin&#x27;s arrival, and many of the aristocracy were intensely curious about the occult and the supernatural. Rasputin&#x27;s ideas and &quot;strange manners&quot; made him the subject of intense curiosity among the city&#x27;s elite, who according to Fuhrmann were &quot;bored, cynical, and seeking new experiences&quot; during this period. Rasputin&#x27;s appeal may have been enhanced by the fact that he was also a native Russian, unlike other self-described &quot;holy men&quot; such as Nizier Anthelme Philippe and Gérard Encausse, who had previously been popular in Saint Petersburg.

According to Fuhrmann, Rasputin stayed in Saint Petersburg for only a few months on his first visit and returned to Pokrovskoye in the fall of 1903. Smith, however, argues that it is impossible to know whether Rasputin stayed in Saint Petersburg or returned to Pokrovskoye at some point between his first arrival and 1905. Regardless, by 1905 Rasputin had formed friendships with several members of the aristocracy, including the &quot;Black Princesses&quot;, Militsa and Anastasia of Montenegro, who had married cousins of Tsar Nicholas II (Grand Duke Peter Nikolaevich and Prince George Maximilianovich Romanowsky) and were instrumental in introducing Rasputin to the tsar and his family.

Rasputin first met Nicholas on 1 November 1905, at the Peterhof Palace. The tsar recorded the event in his diary, writing that he and his empress consort, Alexandra Feodorovna, had &quot;made the acquaintance of a man of God – Grigory, from Tobolsk province&quot;. Rasputin returned to Pokrovskoye shortly after their first meeting and did not return to Saint Petersburg until July 1906. On his return, he sent Nicholas a telegram asking to present the tsar with an icon of St. Simeon of Verkhoturye. He met with Nicholas and Alexandra on 18 July and again in October, when he first met their children.

At some point, Nicholas and Alexandra became convinced that Rasputin possessed the miraculous power to heal their only son, Tsesarevich Alexei Nikolaevich, who suffered from haemophilia. Historians disagree over when this happened: according to Orlando Figes, Rasputin was first introduced to the tsar and tsarina as a healer who could help their son in November 1905, while Joseph T. Fuhrmann has speculated that it was in October 1906 that Rasputin was first asked to pray for the health of Alexei.

== Healer to Alexei Nikolaevich ==

Much of Rasputin&#x27;s influence with the imperial family stemmed from the belief by Alexandra and others that he had on several occasions eased Alexei&#x27;s pain and stopped his bleeding. According to historian Marc Ferro, the tsarina had a &quot;passionate attachment&quot; to Rasputin, believing he could heal her son&#x27;s affliction. Harold Shukman wrote that Rasputin became &quot;an indispensable member of the royal entourage&quot;. It is unclear when Rasputin first learned of Alexei&#x27;s haemophilia, or when he first acted as a healer. He may have been aware of Alexei&#x27;s condition as early as October 1906, and was summoned by Alexandra to pray for the tsarevich when he had an internal hemorrhage in the spring of 1907. Alexei recovered the next morning. Alexandra&#x27;s friend Anna Vyrubova became convinced that Rasputin had miraculous powers shortly thereafter and became one of his most influential advocates.

During the summer of 1912, Alexei developed a hemorrhage in his thigh and groin after a jolting carriage ride near the imperial hunting grounds at Spała, which caused a large hematoma. In severe pain and delirious with fever, the tsarevich appeared close to death. In desperation, Alexandra asked Vyrubova to send Rasputin (who was in Siberia) a telegram, asking him to pray for Alexei. Rasputin wrote back quickly, telling the tsarina that &quot;God has seen your tears and heard your prayers. Do not grieve. The Little One will not die. Do not allow the doctors to bother him too much.&quot; The next morning, Alexei&#x27;s condition was unchanged, but Alexandra was encouraged by the message and regained some hope that he would survive. His bleeding stopped the following day. Dr. S. P. Fedorov, one of the physicians who attended Alexei, admitted that &quot;the recovery was wholly inexplicable from a medical point of view.&quot; Later, Dr. Fedorov admitted that Alexandra could not be blamed for seeing Rasputin as a miracle man: &quot;Rasputin would come in, walk up to the patient, look at him, and spit. The bleeding would stop in no time... How could the empress not trust Rasputin after that?&quot;

Historian Robert K. Massie has called Alexei&#x27;s recovery &quot;one of the most mysterious episodes of the whole Rasputin legend&quot;. The cause of his recovery is unclear: Massie speculated that Rasputin&#x27;s suggestion not to let doctors disturb Alexei had aided his recovery by allowing him to rest and heal, or that his message may have aided Alexei&#x27;s recovery by calming his mother and reducing the tsarevich&#x27;s emotional stress. Alexandra believed that Rasputin had performed a miracle, and concluded that he was essential to Alexei&#x27;s survival. Some writers and historians, such as Ferro, claim that Rasputin stopped Alexei&#x27;s bleeding on other occasions through hypnosis. Still other historiansincluding memoirist Pierre Gilliard, Alexei&#x27;s French-language tutorhave speculated that Rasputin controlled Alexei&#x27;s bleeding by disallowing the administration of aspirin, then widely used to relieve pain, but unknown as an anti-clotting agent until the 1950s.

==Relationship with the Imperial Children==
Alexei and his siblings were also taught to view Rasputin as &quot;our friend&quot; and to share confidences with him. In the autumn of 1907, their aunt, Grand Duchess Olga Alexandrovna, was escorted to the nursery by Nicholas to meet Rasputin. Maria, her sisters and brother Alexei were all wearing their long white nightgowns. &quot;All the children seemed to like him,&quot; Olga Alexandrovna recalled. &quot;They were completely at ease with him.&quot;

Rasputin&#x27;s friendship with the tsar&#x27;s children was evident in the messages he sent to them. &quot;My Dear Pearl M!&quot; Rasputin wrote the nine-year-old Maria in one telegram in 1908. &quot;Tell me how you talked with the sea, with nature! I miss your simple soul. We will see each other soon! A big kiss.&quot; In a second telegram, Rasputin told the child, &quot;My Dear M! My Little Friend! May the Lord help you to carry your cross with wisdom and joy in Christ. This world is like the day, look it&#x27;s already evening. So it is with the cares of the world.&quot; In February 1909, Rasputin sent all of the children a telegram, advising them to, &quot;Love the whole of God&#x27;s nature, the whole of His creation in particular this earth. The Mother of God was always occupied with flowers and needlework.&quot;

One of the girls&#x27; governesses, Sofia Ivanovna Tyutcheva, was horrified in 1910 when Rasputin was permitted access to the nursery when the four girls were in their nightgowns. Tyutcheva wanted Rasputin barred from the nurseries. In response to her complaints, Nicholas asked Rasputin to end his nursery visits. &quot;I am so afr(aid) that S.I. [Tyutcheva] can speak ... about our friend something bad,&quot; Maria&#x27;s twelve-year-old sister Tatiana wrote to her mother on 8 March 1910, after begging Alexandra to forgive her for doing something she did not like. &quot;I hope our nurse will be nice to our friend now.&quot; Alexandra eventually had Tyutcheva fired.

Tyutcheva took her story to other members of the imperial family, who were scandalized by the reports, though Rasputin&#x27;s contacts with the children were by all accounts completely innocent. Nicholas&#x27;s sister, Grand Duchess Xenia Alexandrovna, was horrified by Tyutcheva&#x27;s story. Xenia wrote on 15 March 1910 that she could not understand &quot;...the attitude of Alix and the children to that sinister Grigory (whom they consider to be almost a saint, when in fact he&#x27;s only a &quot;khlyst&quot;!) He&#x27;s always there, goes into the nursery, visits Olga and Tatiana while they are getting ready for bed, sits there talking to them and &quot;caressing&quot; them. They are careful to hide him from Sofia Ivanovna, and the children don&#x27;t dare talk to her about him. It&#x27;s all quite unbelievable and beyond understanding.&quot;

Another of the nursery governesses claimed in the spring of 1910 that she was raped by Rasputin. Maria Ivanovna Vishnyakova had at first been a devotee of Rasputin, but later was disillusioned by him. Alexandra refused to believe Vishnyakova &quot;and said that everything Rasputin does is holy&quot;. Grand Duchess Olga Alexandrovna was told that Vishnyakova&#x27;s claim had been immediately investigated, but &quot;they caught the young woman in bed with a Cossack of the Imperial Guard.&quot; Vishnyakova was dismissed from her post in 1913.

It was whispered in society that Rasputin had seduced not only Alexandra but also the four grand duchesses. Rasputin had released ardent letters written to him by the tsarina and the grand duchesses, which circulated throughout society and fueled the rumors. Pornographic cartoons also circulated that depicted Rasputin having sexual relations with the tsarina, with her four daughters and Anna Vyrubova nude in the background. Nicholas ordered Rasputin to leave Saint Petersburg for a time, much to Alexandra&#x27;s displeasure, and Rasputin went on a pilgrimage to Palestine.

Despite the scandal, the imperial family&#x27;s association with Rasputin continued until his murder on 17 December 1916. &quot;Our Friend is so contented with our girlies, says they have gone through heavy &#x27;courses&#x27; for their age and their souls have much developed,&quot; Alexandra wrote to Nicholas on 6 December 1916. In his memoirs, A. A. Mordvinov reported that the four grand duchesses appeared &quot;cold and visibly terribly upset&quot; by Rasputin&#x27;s death and sat &quot;huddled up closely together&quot; on a sofa in one of their bedrooms on the night they received the news. Mordvinov reported that the young women were in a gloomy mood and seemed to sense the political upheaval that was about to be unleashed. Rasputin was buried with an icon signed on its reverse side by the grand duchesses and their mother.

==Controversies==

The imperial family&#x27;s belief in Rasputin&#x27;s healing powers brought him considerable status and power at court. Nicholas appointed Rasputin his &quot;lampadnik&quot; (lamplighter), charged with keeping the lamps lit before religious icons in the palace, which gained him regular access to the palace and imperial family. By December 1906, Rasputin had become close enough to ask a special favor of the tsar: that he be permitted to change his surname to Rasputin-Noviy (Rasputin-New). Nicholas granted the request and the name change was speedily processed, suggesting that Rasputin already had the tsar&#x27;s favor at that early date. Rasputin used his position to full effect, accepting bribes and sexual favors from admirers and working diligently to expand his influence.

Rasputin soon became a controversial figure; he was accused by his enemies of religious heresy and rape, was suspected of exerting undue political influence over the tsar and was even rumored to be having an affair with the tsarina. Opposition to Rasputin&#x27;s influence grew within the Eastern Orthodox Church. In 1907, the local clergy in Pokrovskoye denounced Rasputin as a heretic, and the Bishop of Tobolsk launched an inquest into his activities, accusing him of &quot;spreading false, &quot;Khlyst-like&quot; doctrines&quot;. In Saint Petersburg, Rasputin faced opposition from even more prominent critics, including Prime Minister Pyotr Stolypin and the &quot;Okhrana&quot;, the tsar&#x27;s secret police. Having ordered an investigation into Rasputin&#x27;s activities, Stolypin confronted Nicholas but did not succeed in reining in Rasputin&#x27;s influence or exiling him from Saint Petersburg.

Outside of the royal court, Rasputin preached that physical contact between him and others purified them; he engaged in drunken revels and extramarital affairs with a wide range of women from prostitutes to high-society ladies. In 1909, Khioniya Berlatskaya, one of Rasputin&#x27;s early supporters, accused him of rape. Betlatskaya sought aid from Theofan, who became convinced that Rasputin was a danger to the monarchy. Rumors multiplied that Rasputin had assaulted female followers and behaved inappropriately on visits with the imperial family—and particularly with Nicholas&#x27;s teenage daughters Olga and Tatiana.

During this period the First World War, the dissolution of feudalism and a meddling government bureaucracy all contributed to Russia&#x27;s rapid economic decline. Many laid the blame on Alexandra and Rasputin. One outspoken member of the Duma, far-right politician Vladimir Purishkevich, stated in November 1916 that he held the tsar&#x27;s ministers had &quot;been turned into marionettes, marionettes whose threads have been taken firmly in hand by Rasputin and the Empress Alexandra Fyodorovna—the evil genius of Russia and the Tsarina… who has remained a German on the Russian throne and alien to the country and its people&quot;. (The tsarina had been born a German princess.)

==Failed assassination attempt==
On , a 33-year-old peasant woman named Khioniya Guseva attempted to assassinate Rasputin by stabbing him in the stomach outside his home in Pokrovskoye. Rasputin was seriously wounded, and for a time it was not clear if he would survive. After surgery and some time in a hospital in Tyumen, he recovered.

Guseva was a follower of Iliodor, a former priest who had supported Rasputin before denouncing his sexual escapades and self-aggrandizement in December 1911. A radical conservative and anti-semite, Iliodor had been part of a group of establishment figures who had attempted to drive a wedge between Rasputin and the imperial family in 1911. When this effort failed, Iliodor was banished from Saint Petersburg and was ultimately defrocked. Guseva claimed to have acted alone, having read about Rasputin in the newspapers and believing him to be a &quot;false prophet and even an Antichrist&quot;. Both the police and Rasputin, however, believed that Iliodor had instigated the assassination attempt. Iliodor fled the country before he could be questioned, and Guseva was found to be not responsible for her actions by reason of insanity.

==Death==

A group of nobles led by Purishkevich, Grand Duke Dmitri Pavlovich and Prince Felix Yusupov decided that Rasputin&#x27;s influence over Alexandra threatened the Russian Empire. They concocted a plan in December 1916 to kill Rasputin, apparently by luring him to the Yusupovs&#x27; Moika Palace.

Rasputin was murdered during the early morning on at the home of Prince Yusupov. He died of three gunshot wounds, one of which was a close-range shot to his forehead. Little is certain about his death beyond this, and the circumstances of his death have been the subject of considerable speculation. According to Smith, &quot;what really happened at the Yusupov home on 17 December will never be known&quot;. The story that Yusupov recounted in his memoirs, however, has become the most frequently told version of events.
According to Yusupov&#x27;s account, Rasputin was invited to his palace shortly after midnight and ushered into the basement. Yusupov offered tea and cakes which had been laced with cyanide. After initially refusing the cakes, Rasputin began to eat them and, to Yusupov&#x27;s surprise, appeared unaffected by the poison. Rasputin then asked for some Madeira wine (which had also been poisoned) and drank three glasses, but still showed no sign of distress. At around 2:30 am, Yusupov excused himself to go upstairs, where his fellow conspirators were waiting. He took a revolver from Pavlovich, then returned to the basement and told Rasputin that he had &quot;better look at the crucifix and say a prayer&quot;, referring to a crucifix in the room, then shot him once in the chest. The conspirators then drove to Rasputin&#x27;s apartment, with Sukhotin wearing Rasputin&#x27;s coat and hat in an attempt to make it look as though Rasputin had returned home that night. Upon returning to his palace, Yusupov went back to the basement to ensure that Rasputin was dead. Suddenly, Rasputin leaped up and attacked Yusupov, who freed himself with some effort and fled upstairs. Rasputin followed Yusupov into the palace&#x27;s courtyard, where he was shot by Purishkevich. He collapsed into a snowbank. The conspirators then wrapped his body in cloth, drove it to the Petrovsky Bridge and dropped it into the Little Nevka river.

In an unsubstantiated claim, Grand Duchess Tatiana, who was earlier alleged to have been raped by Rasputin, was present at the site of Rasputin&#x27;s murder, &quot;disguised as a lieutenant of the Chevaliers-Gardes, so that she could revenge herself on Rasputin who had tried to violate her&quot;. Maurice Paléologue, the French ambassador to Russia, wrote that Tatiana had supposedly witnessed Rasputin&#x27;s castration, but he doubted the credibility of the rumor.

In a modern analysis of Rasputin&#x27;s death, published on the 100th anniversary of the event, Dr Carolyn Harris of the University of Toronto notes that the actual circumstances were apparently less dramatic than Yusupov&#x27;s account. Rasputin&#x27;s daughter recorded that her father disliked sweet food and would not have eaten the supposedly poisoned cakes. An autopsy account by the official surgeon involved has no record of poisoning or drowning but simply records death by a single bullet fired into the head at close range.

===Aftermath===
News of Rasputin&#x27;s murder spread quickly, even before his body was found. According to Smith, Purishkevich spoke openly about the murder to two soldiers and to a policeman who was investigating reports of shots shortly after the event, but urged them not to tell anyone else. An investigation was launched the next morning. The &quot;Stock Exchange Gazette&quot; ran a report of Rasputin&#x27;s death &quot;after a party in one of the most aristocratic homes in the center of the city&quot; on the afternoon of .

After two workmen discovered blood on the railing of the Petrovsky Bridge and a boot on the ice below, police began searching the area. Rasputin&#x27;s body was found under the river ice on 1 January (O.S. 19 December) approximately 200 meters downstream from the bridge. Dmitry Kosorotov, the city&#x27;s senior autopsy surgeon, examined the body. Kosorotov&#x27;s report was lost, but he later stated that Rasputin&#x27;s body had shown signs of severe trauma, including three gunshot wounds (one at close range to the forehead), a slice wound to his left side and other injuries, many of which Kosorotov felt had been sustained post-mortem. Kosorotov found a single bullet in Rasputin&#x27;s body but stated that it was too badly deformed and of a type too widely used to trace. He found no evidence that Rasputin had been poisoned. According to both Smith and Fuhrmann, Kosorotov found no water in Rasputin&#x27;s lungs and reports that Rasputin had been thrown into the water alive were incorrect. Some later accounts claimed that Rasputin&#x27;s penis had been severed, but Kosorotov found his genitals intact.

Rasputin was buried on 2 January (O.S. 21 December) at a small church that Vyrubova had been building at Tsarskoye Selo. The funeral was attended only by the imperial family and a few of their intimates. Rasputin&#x27;s wife, mistress and children were not invited, although his daughters met with the imperial family at Vyrubova&#x27;s home later that day. The imperial family planned to build a church over Rasputin&#x27;s grave site. However, his body was exhumed and burned by a detachment of soldiers on the orders of Alexander Kerensky shortly after Nicholas abdicated the throne in March 1917, so that his grave would not become a rallying point for supporters of the old regime.

==Prominent children==
=== Maria Rasputin ===
Rasputin&#x27;s daughter, Maria Rasputin (born Matryona Rasputina; 1898–1977), emigrated to France after the October Revolution and then to the United States. There, she worked as a dancer and then a lion tamer in a circus.

<text>A gemstone (also called a fine gem, jewel, precious stone, semiprecious stone, or simply gem) is a piece of mineral crystal which, when cut or polished, is used to make jewelry or other adornments. Certain rocks (such as lapis lazuli, opal, and obsidian) and occasionally organic materials that are not minerals (such as amber, jet, and pearl) may also be used for jewelry and are therefore often considered to be gemstones as well. Most gemstones are hard, but some softer minerals such as brazilianite may be used in jewelry because of their color or luster or other physical properties that have aesthetic value. However, generally speaking, soft minerals are not typically used as gemstones by virtue of their brittleness and lack of durability.

Found all over the world, the industry of coloured gemstones (i.e. anything other than diamonds) is currently estimated at US$1.55billion and is projected to steadily increase to a value of $4.46billion by 2033.

A gem expert is a gemologist, a gem maker is called a lapidarist or gemcutter; a diamond cutter is called a diamantaire.

==Characteristics and classification==
The traditional classification in the West, which goes back to the ancient Greeks, begins with a distinction between &quot;precious&quot; and &quot;semi-precious&quot;; similar distinctions are made in other cultures. In modern use, the precious stones are emerald, ruby, sapphire and diamond, with all other gemstones being semi-precious. This distinction reflects the rarity of the respective stones in ancient times, as well as their quality: all are translucent, with fine color in their purest forms (except for the colorless diamond), and very hard with a hardness score of 8 to 10 on the Mohs scale. Other stones are classified by their color, translucency, and hardness. The traditional distinction does not necessarily reflect modern values; for example, while garnets are relatively inexpensive, a green garnet called tsavorite can be far more valuable than a mid-quality emerald. Another traditional term for semi-precious gemstones used in art history and archaeology is hardstone. Use of the terms &#x27;precious&#x27; and &#x27;semi-precious&#x27; in a commercial context is, arguably, misleading in that it suggests certain stones are more valuable than others when this is not reflected in the actual market value, although it would generally be correct if referring to desirability.

In modern times gemstones are identified by gemologists, who describe gems and their characteristics using technical terminology specific to the field of gemology. The first characteristic a gemologist uses to identify a gemstone is its chemical composition. For example, diamonds are made of carbon () and rubies of aluminium oxide (). Many gems are crystals which are classified by their crystal system such as cubic or trigonal or monoclinic. Another term used is habit, the form the gem is usually found in. For example, diamonds, which have a cubic crystal system, are often found as octahedrons.
Gemstones are classified into different &quot;groups&quot;, &quot;species&quot;, and &quot;varieties&quot;. For example, ruby is the red variety of the species corundum, while any other color of corundum is considered sapphire. Other examples are the emerald (green), aquamarine (blue), red beryl (red), goshenite (colorless), heliodor (yellow), and morganite (pink), which are all varieties of the mineral species beryl.

Gems are characterized in terms of their color (hue, tone and saturation), optical phenomena, luster, refractive index, birefringence, dispersion, specific gravity, hardness, cleavage, and fracture. They may exhibit pleochroism or double refraction. They may have luminescence and a distinctive absorption spectrum. Gemstones may also be classified in terms of their &quot;water&quot;. This is a recognized grading of the gem&#x27;s luster, transparency, or &quot;brilliance&quot;. Very transparent gems are considered &quot;first water&quot;, while &quot;second&quot; or &quot;third water&quot; gems are those of a lesser transparency. Additionally, material or flaws within a stone may be present as inclusions.

==Value==
Gemstones have no universally accepted grading system. Diamonds are graded using a system developed by the Gemological Institute of America (GIA) in the early 1950s. Historically, all gemstones were graded using the naked eye. The GIA system included a major innovation: the introduction of 10x magnification as the standard for grading clarity. Other gemstones are still graded using the naked eye (assuming 20/20 vision).

A mnemonic device, the &quot;four Cs&quot; (color, cut, clarity, and carats), has been introduced to help describe the factors used to grade a diamond. With modification, these categories can be useful in understanding the grading of all gemstones. The four criteria carry different weights depending upon whether they are applied to colored gemstones or to colorless diamonds. In diamonds, the cut is the primary determinant of value, followed by clarity and color. An ideally cut diamond will sparkle, to break down light into its constituent rainbow colors (dispersion), chop it up into bright little pieces (scintillation), and deliver it to the eye (brilliance). In its rough crystalline form, a diamond will do none of these things; it requires proper fashioning and this is called &quot;cut&quot;. In gemstones that have color, including colored diamonds, the purity, and beauty of that color is the primary determinant of quality.

Physical characteristics that make a colored stone valuable are color, clarity to a lesser extent (emeralds will always have a number of inclusions), cut, unusual optical phenomena within the stone such as color zoning (the uneven distribution of coloring within a gem) and asteria (star effects).

Apart from the more generic and commonly used gemstones such as from diamonds, rubies, sapphires, and emeralds, pearls and opal have also been defined as precious in the jewellery trade. Up to the discoveries of bulk amethyst in Brazil in the 19th century, amethyst was considered a &quot;precious stone&quot; as well, going back to ancient Greece. Even in the last century certain stones such as aquamarine, peridot and cat&#x27;s eye (cymophane) have been popular and hence been regarded as precious, thus reinforcing the notion that a mineral&#x27;s rarity may have been implicated in its classification as a precious stone and thus contribute to its value.

Today the gemstone trade no longer makes such a distinction. Many gemstones are used in even the most expensive jewelry, depending on the brand-name of the designer, fashion trends, market supply, treatments, etc. Nevertheless, diamonds, rubies, sapphires, and emeralds still have a reputation that exceeds those of other gemstones.

Rare or unusual gemstones, generally understood to include those gemstones which occur so infrequently in gem quality that they are scarcely known except to connoisseurs, include andalusite, axinite, cassiterite, clinohumite, painite and red beryl.

Gemstone pricing and value are governed by factors and characteristics in the quality of the stone. These characteristics include clarity, rarity, freedom from defects, the beauty of the stone, as well as the demand for such stones. There are different pricing influencers for both colored gemstones, and for diamonds. The pricing on colored stones is determined by market supply-and-demand, but diamonds are more intricate.

In the addition to the aesthetic and adorning/ornamental purpose of gemstones, there are many proponents of energy medicine who also value gemstones on the basis of their alleged healing powers.

A gemstone that has been rising in popularity is Cuprian Elbaite Tourmaline which is also called &quot;Paraiba Tourmaline&quot;. It was first discovered in the late 1980s in Paraíba, Brazil and later in Mozambique and Nigeria. It is famous for its glowing neon blue color. Paraiba Tourmaline has become one of the most popular gemstones in recent times thanks to its color and is considered to be one of the important gemstones after rubies, emeralds, and sapphires according to Gübelin Gemlab. Even though it is a tourmaline, Paraiba Tourmaline is one of the most expensive gemstones.

==Grading==
There are a number of laboratories which grade and provide reports on gemstones.
* Gemological Institute of America (GIA), the main provider of education services and diamond grading reports
* International Gemological Institute (IGI), independent laboratory for grading and evaluation of diamonds, jewelry, and colored stones
* Hoge Raad Voor Diamant (HRD Antwerp), The Diamond High Council, Belgium is one of Europe&#x27;s oldest laboratories; its main stakeholder is the Antwerp World Diamond Centre
* American Gemological Society (AGS) is not as widely recognized nor as old as the GIA
* American Gem Trade Laboratory which is part of the American Gem Trade Association (AGTA), a trade organization of jewelers and dealers of colored stones
* American Gemological Laboratories (AGL), owned by Christopher P. Smith
* European Gemological Laboratory (EGL), founded in 1974 by Guy Margel in Belgium
* Gemmological Association of All Japan (GAAJ-ZENHOKYO), Zenhokyo, Japan, active in gemological research
* The Gem and Jewelry Institute of Thailand (Public Organization) or GIT, Thailand&#x27;s national institute for gemological research and gem testing, Bangkok
* Gemmology Institute of Southern Africa, Africa&#x27;s premium gem laboratory
* Asian Institute of Gemological Sciences (AIGS), the oldest gemological institute in South East Asia, involved in gemological education and gem testing
* Swiss Gemmological Institute (SSEF), founded by Henry Hänni, focusing on colored gemstones and the identification of natural pearls
* Gübelin Gem Lab, the traditional Swiss lab founded by Eduard Gübelin

Each laboratory has its own methodology to evaluate gemstones. A stone can be called &quot;pink&quot; by one lab while another lab calls it &quot;padparadscha&quot;. One lab can conclude a stone is untreated, while another lab might conclude that it is heat-treated. To minimize such differences, seven of the most respected labs, AGTA-GTL (New York), CISGEM (Milano), GAAJ-ZENHOKYO (Tokyo), GIA (Carlsbad), GIT (Bangkok), Gübelin (Lucerne) and SSEF (Basel), have established the Laboratory Manual Harmonisation Committee (LMHC), for the standardization of wording reports, promotion of certain analytical methods and interpretation of results. Country of origin has sometimes been difficult to determine, due to the constant discovery of new source locations. Determining a &quot;country of origin&quot; is thus much more difficult than determining other aspects of a gem (such as cut, clarity, etc.).

Gem dealers are aware of the differences between gem laboratories and will make use of the discrepancies to obtain the best possible certificate.

==Cutting and polishing==
A few gemstones are used as gems in the crystal or other forms in which they are found. Most, however, are cut and polished for usage as jewelry. The two main classifications are as follows:

* Stones cut as smooth, dome-shaped stones called cabochons or simply cab. These have been a popular shape since ancient time and are more durable than faceted gems.
* Stones which are cut with a faceting machine by polishing small flat windows called facets at regular intervals at exact angles.

Stones which are opaque or semi-opaque such as opal, turquoise, variscite, etc. are commonly cut as cabochons. These gems are designed to show the stone&#x27;s color, luster and other surface properties as opposed to internal reflection properties like brilliance. Grinding wheels and polishing agents are used to grind, shape, and polish the smooth dome shape of the stones.

Gems that are transparent are normally faceted, a method that shows the optical properties of the stone&#x27;s interior to its best advantage by maximizing reflected light which is perceived by the viewer as sparkle. There are many commonly used shapes for faceted stones. The facets must be cut at the proper angles, which varies depending on the optical properties of the gem. If the angles are too steep or too shallow, the light will pass through and not be reflected back toward the viewer. The faceting machine is used to hold the stone onto a flat lap for cutting and polishing the flat facets. Rarely, some cutters use special curved laps to cut and polish curved facets.

==Colors==
The color of any material is due to the nature of light itself. Daylight, often called white light, is all of the colors of the spectrum combined. When light strikes a material, most of the light is absorbed while a smaller amount of a particular frequency or wavelength is reflected. The part that is reflected reaches the eye as the perceived color. A ruby appears red because it absorbs all other colors of white light while reflecting red.

A material which is mostly the same can exhibit different colors. For example, ruby and sapphire have the same primary chemical composition (both are corundum) but exhibit different colors because of impurities which absorb and reflect different wavelengths of light depending on their individual compositions. Even the same named gemstone can occur in many different colors: sapphires show different shades of blue and pink and &quot;fancy sapphires&quot; exhibit a whole range of other colors from yellow to orange-pink, the latter called &quot;padparadscha sapphire&quot;.

This difference in color is based on the atomic structure of the stone. Although the different stones formally have the same chemical composition and structure, they are not exactly the same. Every now and then an atom is replaced by a completely different atom, sometimes as few as one in a million atoms. These so-called impurities are sufficient to absorb certain colors and leave the other colors unaffected. For example, beryl, which is colorless in its pure mineral form, becomes emerald with chromium impurities. If manganese is added instead of chromium, beryl becomes pink morganite. With iron, it becomes aquamarine.Some gemstone treatments make use of the fact that these impurities can be &quot;manipulated&quot;, thus changing the color of the gem.

==Treatment==
Gemstones are often treated to enhance the color or clarity of the stone. In some cases, the treatment applied to the gemstone can also increase its durability. Even though natural gemstones can be transformed using the traditional method of cutting and polishing, other treatment options allow the stone&#x27;s appearance to be enhanced. Depending on the type and extent of treatment, they can affect the value of the stone. Some treatments are used widely because the resulting gem is stable, while others are not accepted most commonly because the gem color is unstable and may revert to the original tone.

=== Early history ===
Before the innovation of modern-day tools, thousands of years ago, people were recorded to use a variety of techniques to treat and enhance gemstones. Some of the earliest methods of gemstone treatment date back to the Minoan Age, for example foiling, which is where metal foil is used to enhance a gemstone&#x27;s colour. Other methods recorded 2000 years ago in the book &quot;Natural History&quot; by Pliny the Elder include oiling and dyeing/staining.

=== Heat ===
Heat can either improve or spoil gemstone color or clarity. The heating process has been well known to gem miners and cutters for centuries, and in many stone types heating is a common practice. Most citrine is made by heating amethyst, and partial heating with a strong gradient results in &quot;ametrine&quot; – a stone partly amethyst and partly citrine. Aquamarine is often heated to remove yellow tones, or to change green colors into the more desirable blue, or enhance its existing blue color to a deeper blue.

Nearly all tanzanite is heated at low temperatures to remove brown undertones and give a more desirable blue / purple color. A considerable portion of all sapphire and ruby is treated with a variety of heat treatments to improve both color and clarity.

When jewelry containing diamonds is heated for repairs, the diamond should be protected with boric acid; otherwise, the diamond, which is pure carbon, could be burned on the surface or even burned completely up. When jewelry containing sapphires or rubies is heated, those stones should not be coated with boric acid (which can etch the surface) or any other substance. They do not have to be protected from burning, like a diamond (although the stones do need to be protected from heat stress fracture by immersing the part of the jewelry with stones in the water when metal parts are heated).

===Radiation===

The irradiation process is widely practiced in jewelry industry and enabled the creation of gemstone colors that do not exist or are extremely rare in nature. However, particularly when done in a nuclear reactor, the processes can make gemstones radioactive. Health risks related to the residual radioactivity of the treated gemstones have led to government regulations in many countries.

Virtually all blue topaz, both the lighter and the darker blue shades such as &quot;London&quot; blue, has been irradiated to change the color from white to blue. Most green quartz (Oro Verde) are also irradiated to achieve the yellow-green color. Diamonds are mainly irradiated to become blue-green or green, although other colors are possible. When light-to-medium-yellow diamonds are treated with gamma rays they may become green; with a high-energy electron beam, blue.

===Waxing/oiling===
Emeralds containing natural fissures are sometimes filled with wax or oil to disguise them. This wax or oil is also colored to make the emerald appear of better color as well as clarity. Turquoise is also commonly treated in a similar manner.

===Fracture filling===

Fracture filling has been in use with different gemstones such as diamonds, emeralds, and sapphires. In 2006 &quot;glass-filled rubies&quot; received publicity. Rubies over 10 carats (2 g) with large fractures were filled with lead glass, thus dramatically improving the appearance (of larger rubies in particular). Such treatments are fairly easy to detect.

=== Bleaching ===

Another treatment method that is commonly used to treat gemstones is bleaching. This method uses a chemical in order to reduce the colour of the gem. After bleaching, a combination treatment can be done by dying the gemstone once the unwanted colours are removed. Hydrogen peroxide is the most commonly used product used to alter gemstones and have notably been used to treat jade and pearls. The treatment of bleaching can also be followed by impregnation, which allows the gemstone&#x27;s durability to be increased.

== Socioeconomic issues in the gemstone industry ==
The socio-economic dynamics of the gemstone industry are shaped by market forces and consumer preferences and typically go undiscussed. Changes in demand and prices can significantly affect the livelihoods of those involved in gemstone mining and trade, particularly in developing countries where the industry serves as a crucial source of income.

A situation that arises as a result of this is the exploitation of natural resources and labor within gemstone mining operations. Many mines, particularly in developing countries, face challenges such as inadequate safety measures, low wages, and poor working conditions. Miners, often from disadvantaged backgrounds, endure hazardous working conditions and receive meager wages, contributing to cycles of poverty and exploitation. Gemstone mining operations are frequently conducted in remote or underdeveloped areas, lacking proper infrastructure and access to essential services such as healthcare and education. This further contributes to the pre-existing socio-economic disparities and obstructs community development such that the benefits of gemstone extraction may not adequately reach those directly involved in the process.

Another such issue revolves around environmental degradation resulting from mining activities. Environmental degradation can pose long-term threats to ecosystems and biodiversity, further worsening the socio-economic state in affected regions. Unregulated mining practices often result in deforestation, soil erosion, and water contamination thus threatening ecosystems and biodiversity. Unregulated mining activity can also cause depletion of natural resources, thus diminishing the prospects for sustainable development. The environmental impact of gemstone mining not only poses a threat to ecosystems but also undermines the long-term viability of the industry by diminishing the quality and quantity of available resources.

Furthermore, the gemstone industry is also susceptible to issues related to transparency and ethics, which impact both producers and consumers. The lack of standardized certification processes and the prevalence of illicit practices undermine market integrity and trust. The lack of transparency and accountability in the supply chain aggravates pre-existing inequalities, as middlemen and corporations often capture a disproportionate share of the profits. As a result, the unequal distribution of profits along the supply chain does little to improve socio-economic inequalities, particularly in regions where gemstones are mined.

Addressing these socio-economic challenges requires intensive effort from various stakeholders, including governments, industry executives, and society, to promote sustainable practices and ensure equitable outcomes for all involved parties. Implementing and enforcing regulations to ensure fair labor practices, environmental sustainability, and ethical sourcing is essential. Additionally, investing in community development projects, such as education and healthcare initiatives, can help alleviate poverty and empower marginalized communities dependent on the gemstone industry. Collaboration across sectors is crucial for fostering a more equitable and sustainable gemstone trade that benefits both producers and consumers while respecting human rights and environmental integrity.

==Synthetic and artificial gemstones==
Synthetic gemstones are distinct from imitation or simulated gems.

Synthetic gems are physically, optically, and chemically identical to the natural stone, but are created in a laboratory. Imitation or simulated stones are chemically different from the natural stone, but may appear quite similar to it; they can be more easily manufactured synthetic gemstones of a different mineral (spinel), glass, plastic, resins, or other compounds.

Examples of simulated or imitation stones include cubic zirconia, composed of zirconium oxide, synthetic moissanite, and uncolored, synthetic corundum or spinels; all of which are diamond simulants. The simulants imitate the look and color of the real stone but possess neither their chemical nor physical characteristics. In general, all are less hard than diamond. Moissanite actually has a &quot;higher&quot; refractive index than diamond, and when presented beside an equivalently sized and cut diamond will show more &quot;fire&quot;.

Cultured, synthetic, or &quot;lab-created&quot; gemstones are not imitations: The bulk mineral and trace coloring elements are the same in both. For example, diamonds, rubies, sapphires, and emeralds have been manufactured in labs that possess chemical and physical characteristics identical to the naturally occurring variety. Synthetic (lab created) corundum, including ruby and sapphire, is very common and costs much less than the natural stones. Small synthetic diamonds have been manufactured in large quantities as industrial abrasives, although larger gem-quality synthetic diamonds are becoming available in multiple carats.

Whether a gemstone is a natural stone or synthetic, the chemical, physical, and optical characteristics are the same: They are composed of the same mineral and are colored by the same trace materials, have the same hardness and density and strength, and show the same color spectrum, refractive index, and birefringence (if any). Lab-created stones tend to have a more vivid color since impurities common in natural stones are not present in the synthetic stone. Synthetics are made free of common naturally occurring impurities that reduce gem clarity or color unless intentionally added in order to provide a more drab, natural appearance, or to deceive an assayer. On the other hand, synthetics often show flaws not seen in natural stones, such as minute particles of corroded metal from lab trays used during synthesis.

=== Types ===
Some gemstones are more difficult to synthesize than others and not all stones are commercially viable to attempt to synthesize. These are the most common on the market currently.

==== Synthetic corundum ====
Synthetic corundum includes ruby (red variation) and sapphire (other color variations), both of which are considered highly desired and valued. Ruby was the first gemstone to be synthesized by Auguste Verneuil with his development of the flame-fusion process in 1902. Synthetic corundum continues to be made typically by flame-fusion as it is most cost-effective, but can also be produced through flux growth and hydrothermal growth.

==== Synthetic beryls ====
The most common synthesized beryl is emerald (green). Yellow, red and blue beryls are possible but much more rare. Synthetic emerald became possible with the development of the flux growth process and is produced in this way and well as hydrothermal growth.

==== Synthetic quartz ====
Types of synthetic quartz include citrine, rose quartz, and amethyst. Natural occurring quartz is not rare, but is nevertheless synthetically produced as it has practical application outside of aesthetic purposes. Quartz generates an electric current when under pressure and is used in watches, clocks, and oscillators.

==== Synthetic spinel ====
Synthetic spinel was first produced by accident. It can be created in any color making it popular to simulate various natural gemstones. It is created through flux growth and hydrothermal growth.

=== Creation process ===
There are two main categories for creation of these minerals: melt or solution processes.

==== Verneuil flame fusion process (melt process) ====

The flame fusion process was the first process used which successfully created large quantities of synthetic gemstones to be sold on the market. This remains the most cost effective and common method of creating corundums today.

The flame fusion process is completed in a Verneuil furnace. The furnace consists of an inverted blowpipe burner which produces an extremely hot oxyhydrogen flame, a powder dispenser, and a ceramic pedestal. A chemical powder which corresponds to the desired gemstone is passed through this flames. This melts the ingredients which drop on to a plate and solidify into a crystal called a &quot;boule&quot;. For corundum the flame must be 2000 °C. This process takes hours and yields a crystal with the same properties as its natural counterpart.

To produce corundum, a pure aluminium powder is used with different additives to achieve different colors.

* Chromic oxide for ruby
* Iron and titanium oxide for blue sapphire
* Nickel oxide for yellow sapphire
* Nickel, chromium and iron for orange sapphire
* Manganese for pink sapphire
* Copper for blue-green sapphire
* Cobalt for dark blue sapphire

==== Czochralski process (melt process) ====
In 1918 this process was developed by J. Czocharalski and is also referred to as the &quot;crystal pulling&quot; method. In this process, the required gemstone materials are added to a crucible. A seed stone is placed into the melt in the crucible. As the gem begins to crystallize on the seed, the seed is pulled away and the gem continues to grow. This is used for corundum but is currently the least popular method.

==== Flux growth (solution process) ====
The flux growth process was the first process able to synthesize emerald. Flux growth begins with a crucible which can withstand high heat; either graphite or platinum which is filled with a molten liquid referred to as flux. The specific gem ingredients are added and dissolved in this fluid and recrystallize to form the desired gemstone.This is a longer process compared to the flame fusion process and can take two months up to a year depending on the desired final size.

==== Hydrothermal growth (solution process) ====
The hydrothermal growth process attempts to imitate the natural growth process of minerals. The required gem materials are sealed in a container of water and placed under extreme pressure. The water is heated beyond its boiling point which allows normally insoluble materials to dissolve. As more material cannot be added once the container is sealed, in order to create a larger gem the process would begin with a &quot;seed&quot; stone from a previous batch which the new material will crystallize on. This process takes a few weeks to complete.

=== Characteristics ===
Synthetic gemstones share chemical and physical properties with natural gemstones, but there are some slight differences that can be used to discern synthetic from natural. These differences are slight and often require microscopy as a tool to distinguish differences. Undetectable synthetics pose a threat to the market if they are able to be sold as rare natural gemstones. Because of this there are certain characteristic gemologists look for. Each crystal is characteristic to the environment and growth process under which it was created.

Gemstones created from the flame-fusion process may have

* small air bubbles which were trapped inside the boule during formation process
* visible banding from formation of the boule
* chatter marks which on the surface which appear crack like which are caused from damage during polishing of the gemstone

Gemstones created from flux melt process may have

* small cavities which are filled with flux solution
* inclusions in the gemstone from crucible used

Gemstones created from hydrothermal growth may have

* inclusions from container used

=== History ===

Prior to development of synthesising processes the alternatives on the market to natural gemstones were imitations or fake. In 1837, the first successful synthesis of ruby occurred. French chemist Marc Gaudin managed to produce small crystals of ruby from melting together potassium aluminium sulphate and potassium chromate through what would later be known as the flux melt process. Following this, another French chemist Fremy was able to grow large quantities of small ruby crystals using a lead flux.

A few years later an alternative to flux melt was developed which led to the introduction of what was labeled &quot;reconstructed ruby&quot; to the market. Reconstructed ruby was sold as a process which produced larger rubies from melting together bits of natural ruby. In later attempts to recreate this process it was found to not be possible and is believed reconstructed rubies were most likely created using a multi-step method of melting of ruby powder.

Auguste Verneuil, a student of Fremy, went on to develop flame-fusion as an alternative to the flux-melt method. He developed large furnaces which were able to produce large quantities of corundums more efficiently and shifted the gemstone market dramatically. This process is still used today and the furnaces have not changed much from the original design. World production of corundum using this method reaches 1000 million carats a year.

<text>Gerard David ( – 13 August 1523) was an Early Netherlandish painter and manuscript illuminator known for his brilliant use of color. Only a bare outline of his life survives, although some facts are known. He may have been the Meester gheraet van brugghe who became a master of the Antwerp guild in 1515. He was very successful in his lifetime and probably ran two workshops, in Antwerp and Bruges. Like many painters of his period, his reputation diminished in the 17th century until he was rediscovered in the 19th century.

==Life==
He was born in Oudewater, now located in the province of Utrecht. His year of birth is approximated as c. 1450–1460 on the basis that he looks to be around 50 years in the 1509 self-portrait found in his &quot;Virgin among the Virgins&quot;. He is believed to have spent time in Italy from 1470 to 1480, where he was influenced by the Italian Renaissance. He formed his early style under Albert van Oudewater in Haarlem, and moved to Bruges in 1483, where he joined the Guild of Saint Luke in 1484.
Upon the death of Hans Memling in 1494, David became Bruges&#x27; leading painter. He became dean of the guild in 1501, and in 1496 married Cornelia Cnoop, daughter of the dean of the goldsmiths&#x27; guild. David was one of the town&#x27;s leading citizens.

Ambrosius Benson served his apprenticeship with David. Around 1519 they had a dispute over a number of paintings and drawings which Benson had collected from other artists. David refused to return the materials because Benson owed him a large debt. Benson sought legal recourse in court and after he won, David was condemned to a prison term.

He died on 13 August 1523 and was buried in the Church of Our Lady in Bruges.

==Style==

David&#x27;s surviving work mainly consists of religious scenes. They are characterised by an atmospheric, timeless, and almost dream like serenity, achieved through soft, warm and subtle colourisation, and masterful handling of light and shadow. He is innovative in his recasting of traditional themes and in his approach to landscape, which was then only an emerging genre in northern European painting. His ability with landscape can be seen in the detailed foliage of his &quot;Triptych of the Baptism&quot; and the forest scene in the New York &quot;Nativity&quot;.

Many of the art historians of the early 20th century, including Erwin Panofsky and Max Jakob Friedländer saw him as a painter who did little but distill the style of others and painted in an archaic and unimaginative style. However today most view him as a master colourist, and a painter who according to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, worked in a &quot;progressive, even enterprising, mode, casting off his late medieval heritage and proceeding with a certain purity of vision in an age of transition.&quot;

In his early work David followed Haarlem artists such as Dirk Bouts, Albert van Oudewater, and Geertgen tot Sint Jans, though he had already given evidence of superior power as a colourist. To this early period belong the &quot;St John&quot; of the Richard von Kaufmann collection in Berlin and the Salting&#x27;s &quot;St Jerome&quot;. In Bruges he came directly under the influence of Memling, the master whom he followed most closely. It was from him that David acquired a solemnity of treatment, greater realism in the rendering of human form, and an orderly arrangement of figures.

He visited Antwerp in 1515 and was impressed with the work of Quentin Matsys, who had introduced a greater vitality and intimacy in the conception of sacred themes. Together they worked to preserve the traditions of the Bruges school against influences of the Italian Renaissance.

==Works==

The works for which David is best known are the altarpieces painted before his visit to Antwerp: the &quot;Marriage of St Catherine&quot; at the National Gallery, London; the triptych of the &quot;Madonna Enthroned and Saints&quot; of the Brignole-Sale collection in Genoa; the &quot;Annunciation&quot; of the Sigmaringen collection; and above all, the &quot;Madonna with Angels and Saints&quot; (usually titled &quot;The Virgin among the Virgins&quot;), which he donated to the Carmelite Nuns of Sion at Bruges, and which is now in the Rouen museum.

Only a few of his works have remained in Bruges: &quot;The Judgment of Cambyses&quot;, &quot;The Flaying of Sisamnes&quot; and the &quot;Baptism of Christ&quot; in the Groeningemuseum, and the &quot;Transfiguration&quot; in the Church of Our Lady.

The rest were scattered around the world, and to this may be due the oblivion into which his very name had fallen; this, and the fact that, some believed that for all the beauty and the soulfulness of his work, he had nothing innovative to add to the history of art.
Even in his best work he had only given newer variations of the art of his predecessors and contemporaries. His rank among the masters was renewed, however, when a number of his paintings were assembled at the seminal 1902 Gruuthusemuseum, Bruges exhibition of early Flemish painters.

He also worked closely with the leading manuscript illuminators of the day, and seems to have been brought in to paint specific important miniatures himself, among them a &quot;Virgin among the Virgins&quot; in the Morgan Library, a &quot;Virgin and Child on a Crescent Moon&quot; in the &quot;Rothschild Prayerbook&quot;, and a portrait of the Emperor Maximilian in Vienna. Several of his drawings also survive, and elements from these appear in the works of other painters and illuminators for several decades after his death.

Less known but also of high quality are the works of David found in Spanish public collections. The Prado Museum in Madrid owns a table &quot;Rest on the flight into Egypt&quot; resembling the one in the Royal Museum of Fine Arts in Antwerp. The Prado also holds another two Works by the painter, one of them only attributed. Another one of the Spanish capital&#x27;s Museums, The Thyssen-Bornemisza holds a &quot;Crucifixión&quot; from 1475.

==Legacy==
At the time of David&#x27;s death, the glory of Bruges and its painters was on the wane: Antwerp had become the leader in art as well as in political and commercial importance. Of David&#x27;s pupils in Bruges, only Adriaen Isenbrandt, Albert Cornelis, and Ambrosius Benson achieved importance. Among other Flemish painters, Joachim Patinir, Jan Mabuse and the Master of the Plump-Cheeked Madonnas were to some degree influenced by him.

David&#x27;s name had been completely forgotten when in 1866 William Henry James Weale discovered documents about him in the archives of Bruges; these brought to light the main facts of the painter&#x27;s life and led to the reconstruction of David&#x27;s artistic personality, beginning with the recognition of David&#x27;s only documented work, the &quot;Virgin Among Virgins&quot; at Rouen.

<text>The Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) is a family of standards to describe the protocols for second-generation (2G) digital cellular networks, as used by mobile devices such as mobile phones and mobile broadband modems. GSM is also a trade mark owned by the GSM Association. &quot;GSM&quot; may also refer to the voice codec initially used in GSM.

2G networks developed as a replacement for first generation (1G) analog cellular networks. The original GSM standard, which was developed by the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI), originally described a digital, circuit-switched network optimized for full duplex voice telephony, employing time division multiple access (TDMA) between stations. This expanded over time to include data communications, first by circuit-switched transport, then by packet data transport via its upgraded standards, GPRS and then EDGE. GSM exists in various versions based on the frequency bands used.

GSM was first implemented in Finland in December 1991. It became the global standard for mobile cellular communications, with over 2 billion GSM subscribers globally in 2006, far above its competing standard, CDMA. Its share reached over 90% market share by the mid-2010s, and operating in over 219 countries and territories. The specifications and maintenance of GSM passed over to the 3GPP body in 2000, which at the time developed third-generation (3G) UMTS standards, followed by the fourth-generation (4G) LTE Advanced and the fifth-generation 5G standards, which do not form part of the GSM standard. Beginning in the late 2010s, various carriers worldwide started to shut down their GSM networks; nevertheless, as a result of the network&#x27;s widespread use, the acronym &quot;GSM&quot; is still used as a generic term for the plethora of &quot;G&quot; mobile phone technologies evolved from it.

== History ==
===Initial European development===

In 1983, work began to develop a European standard for digital cellular voice telecommunications when the European Conference of Postal and Telecommunications Administrations (CEPT) set up the &quot;Groupe Spécial Mobile&quot; (GSM) committee and later provided a permanent technical-support group based in Paris. Five years later, in 1987, 15 representatives from 13 European countries signed a memorandum of understanding in Copenhagen to develop and deploy a common cellular telephone system across Europe, and EU rules were passed to make GSM a mandatory standard. The decision to develop a continental standard eventually resulted in a unified, open, standard-based network which was larger than that in the United States.

In February 1987 Europe produced the first agreed GSM Technical Specification. Ministers from the four big EU countries cemented their political support for GSM with the Bonn Declaration on Global Information Networks in May and the GSM MoU was tabled for signature in September. The MoU drew in mobile operators from across Europe to pledge to invest in new GSM networks to an ambitious common date.

In this short 38-week period the whole of Europe (countries and industries) had been brought behind GSM in a rare unity and speed guided by four public officials: Armin Silberhorn (Germany), Stephen Temple (UK), Philippe Dupuis (France), and Renzo Failli (Italy). In 1989 the Groupe Spécial Mobile committee was transferred from CEPT to the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI).
The IEEE/RSE awarded to Thomas Haug and Philippe Dupuis the 2018 James Clerk Maxwell medal for their &quot;leadership in the development of the first international mobile communications standard with subsequent evolution into worldwide smartphone data communication&quot;. The GSM (2G) has evolved into 3G, 4G and 5G.

=== First networks ===

In parallel France and Germany signed a joint development agreement in 1984 and were joined by Italy and the UK in 1986. In 1986, the European Commission proposed reserving the 900 MHz spectrum band for GSM. It was long believed that the former Finnish prime minister Harri Holkeri made the world&#x27;s first GSM call on 1 July 1991, calling Kaarina Suonio (deputy mayor of the city of Tampere) using a network built by Nokia and Siemens and operated by Radiolinja. In 2021 a former Nokia engineer Pekka Lonka revealed to making a test call just a couple of hours earlier. &quot;World&#x27;s first GSM call was actually made by me. I called Marjo Jousinen, in Salo.&quot;, Lonka informed. The following year saw the sending of the first short messaging service (SMS or &quot;text message&quot;) message, and Vodafone UK and Telecom Finland signed the first international roaming agreement.

=== Enhancements ===

Work began in 1991 to expand the GSM standard to the 1800 MHz frequency band and the first 1800 MHz network became operational in the UK by 1993, called the DCS 1800. Also that year, Telstra became the first network operator to deploy a GSM network outside Europe and the first practical hand-held GSM mobile phone became available.

In 1995 fax, data and SMS messaging services were launched commercially, the first 1900 MHz GSM network became operational in the United States and GSM subscribers worldwide exceeded 10 million. In the same year, the GSM Association formed. Pre-paid GSM SIM cards were launched in 1996 and worldwide GSM subscribers passed 100 million in 1998.

In 2000 the first commercial General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) services were launched and the first GPRS-compatible handsets became available for sale. In 2001, the first UMTS (W-CDMA) network was launched, a 3G technology that is not part of GSM. Worldwide GSM subscribers exceeded 500 million. In 2002, the first Multimedia Messaging Service (MMS) was introduced and the first GSM network in the 800 MHz frequency band became operational. Enhanced Data rates for GSM Evolution (EDGE) services first became operational in a network in 2003, and the number of worldwide GSM subscribers exceeded 1 billion in 2004.

By 2005 GSM networks accounted for more than 75% of the worldwide cellular network market, serving 1.5 billion subscribers. In 2005, the first HSDPA-capable network also became operational. The first HSUPA network launched in 2007. (High Speed Packet Access (HSPA) and its uplink and downlink versions are 3G technologies, not part of GSM.) Worldwide GSM subscribers exceeded three billion in 2008.

=== Adoption ===

The GSM Association estimated in 2011 that technologies defined in the GSM standard served 80% of the mobile market, encompassing more than 5 billion people across more than 212 countries and territories, making GSM the most ubiquitous of the many standards for cellular networks.

GSM is a second-generation (2G) standard employing time-division multiple-access (TDMA) spectrum-sharing, issued by the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI). The GSM standard does not include the 3G Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS), code-division multiple access (CDMA) technology, nor the 4G LTE orthogonal frequency-division multiple access (OFDMA) technology standards issued by the 3GPP.

GSM, for the first time, set a common standard for Europe for wireless networks. It was also adopted by many countries outside Europe. This allowed subscribers to use other GSM networks that have roaming agreements with each other. The common standard reduced research and development costs, since hardware and software could be sold with only minor adaptations for the local market.

=== Discontinuation ===

Telstra in Australia shut down its 2G GSM network on 1 December 2016, the first mobile network operator to decommission a GSM network. The second mobile provider to shut down its GSM network (on 1 January 2017) was AT&amp;T Mobility from the United States. 
Optus in Australia completed the shut down of its 2G GSM network on 1 August 2017, part of the Optus GSM network covering Western Australia and the Northern Territory had earlier in the year been shut down in April 2017.
Singapore shut down 2G services entirely in April 2017.

== Technical details ==

=== Network structure ===
The network is structured into several discrete sections:
* Base station subsystem – the base stations and their controllers
* Network and Switching Subsystem – the part of the network most similar to a fixed network, sometimes just called the &quot;core network&quot;
* GPRS Core Network – the optional part which allows packet-based Internet connections
* Operations support system (OSS) – network maintenance

=== Base-station subsystem ===

GSM utilizes a cellular network, meaning that cell phones connect to it by searching for cells in the immediate vicinity. There are five different cell sizes in a GSM network:

* macro
* micro
* pico
* femto, and 
* umbrella cells

The coverage area of each cell varies according to the implementation environment. Macro cells can be regarded as cells where the base-station antenna is installed on a mast or a building above average rooftop level. Micro cells are cells whose antenna height is under average rooftop level; they are typically deployed in urban areas. Picocells are small cells whose coverage diameter is a few dozen meters; they are mainly used indoors. Femtocells are cells designed for use in residential or small-business environments and connect to a telecommunications service provider&#x27;s network via a broadband-internet connection. Umbrella cells are used to cover shadowed regions of smaller cells and to fill in gaps in coverage between those cells.

Cell horizontal radius varies – depending on antenna height, antenna gain, and propagation conditions – from a couple of hundred meters to several tens of kilometers. The longest distance the GSM specification supports in practical use is . There are also several implementations of the concept of an extended cell, where the cell radius could be double or even more, depending on the antenna system, the type of terrain, and the timing advance.

GSM supports indoor coverage – achievable by using an indoor picocell base station, or an indoor repeater with distributed indoor antennas fed through power splitters – to deliver the radio signals from an antenna outdoors to the separate indoor distributed antenna system. Picocells are typically deployed when significant call capacity is needed indoors, as in shopping centers or airports. However, this is not a prerequisite, since indoor coverage is also provided by in-building penetration of radio signals from any nearby cell.

==== GSM carrier frequencies ====

GSM networks operate in a number of different carrier frequency ranges (separated into GSM frequency ranges for 2G and UMTS frequency bands for 3G), with most 2G GSM networks operating in the 900 MHz or 1800 MHz bands. Where these bands were already allocated, the 850 MHz and 1900 MHz bands were used instead (for example in Canada and the United States). In rare cases the 400 and 450 MHz frequency bands are assigned in some countries because they were previously used for first-generation systems.

For comparison, most 3G networks in Europe operate in the 2100 MHz frequency band. For more information on worldwide GSM frequency usage, see GSM frequency bands.

Regardless of the frequency selected by an operator, it is divided into timeslots for individual phones. This allows eight full-rate or sixteen half-rate speech channels per radio frequency. These eight radio timeslots (or burst periods) are grouped into a TDMA frame. Half-rate channels use alternate frames in the same timeslot. The channel data rate for all is and the frame duration is TDMA noise is interference that can be heard on speakers near a GSM phone using TDMA, audible as a buzzing sound.
The transmission power in the handset is limited to a maximum of 2 watts in and in .

==== Voice codecs ====
GSM has used a variety of voice codecs to squeeze 3.1 kHz audio into between 7 and 13 kbit/s. Originally, two codecs, named after the types of data channel they were allocated, were used, called Half Rate (6.5 kbit/s) and Full Rate (13 kbit/s). These used a system based on linear predictive coding (LPC). In addition to being efficient with bitrates, these codecs also made it easier to identify more important parts of the audio, allowing the air interface layer to prioritize and better protect these parts of the signal. GSM was further enhanced in 1997
with the enhanced full rate (EFR) codec, a 12.2 kbit/s codec that uses a full-rate channel. Finally, with the development of UMTS, EFR was refactored into a variable-rate codec called AMR-Narrowband, which is high quality and robust against interference when used on full-rate channels, or less robust but still relatively high quality when used in good radio conditions on half-rate channel.

=== Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) ===

One of the key features of GSM is the Subscriber Identity Module, commonly known as a SIM card. The SIM is a detachable smart card containing a user&#x27;s subscription information and phone book. This allows users to retain their information after switching handsets. Alternatively, users can change networks or network identities without switching handsets - simply by changing the SIM.

=== Phone locking ===
Sometimes mobile network operators restrict handsets that they sell for exclusive use in their own network. This is called SIM locking and is implemented by a software feature of the phone. A subscriber may usually contact the provider to remove the lock for a fee, utilize private services to remove the lock, or use software and websites to unlock the handset themselves. It is possible to hack past a phone locked by a network operator.

In some countries and regions (e.g. Brazil and Germany) all phones are sold unlocked due to the abundance of dual-SIM handsets and operators.

==GSM security==
GSM was intended to be a secure wireless system. It has considered the user authentication using a pre-shared key and challenge–response, and over-the-air encryption. However, GSM is vulnerable to different types of attack, each of them aimed at a different part of the network.

Research findings indicate that GSM faces susceptibility to hacking by script kiddies, a term referring to inexperienced individuals utilizing readily available hardware and software. The vulnerability arises from the accessibility of tools such as a DVB-T TV tuner, posing a threat to both mobile and network users. Despite the term &quot;script kiddies&quot; implying a lack of sophisticated skills, the consequences of their attacks on GSM can be severe, impacting the functionality of cellular networks. Given that GSM continues to be the main source of cellular technology in numerous countries, its susceptibility to potential threats from malicious attacks is one that needs to be addressed.

The development of UMTS introduced an optional Universal Subscriber Identity Module (USIM), that uses a longer authentication key to give greater security, as well as mutually authenticating the network and the user, whereas GSM only authenticates the user to the network (and not vice versa). The security model therefore offers confidentiality and authentication, but limited authorization capabilities, and no non-repudiation.

GSM uses several cryptographic algorithms for security. The A5/1, A5/2, and A5/3 stream ciphers are used for ensuring over-the-air voice privacy. A5/1 was developed first and is a stronger algorithm used within Europe and the United States; A5/2 is weaker and used in other countries. Serious weaknesses have been found in both algorithms: it is possible to break A5/2 in real-time with a ciphertext-only attack, and in January 2007, The Hacker&#x27;s Choice started the A5/1 cracking project with plans to use FPGAs that allow A5/1 to be broken with a rainbow table attack. The system supports multiple algorithms so operators may replace that cipher with a stronger one.

Since 2000, different efforts have been made in order to crack the A5 encryption algorithms. Both A5/1 and A5/2 algorithms have been broken, and their cryptanalysis has been revealed in the literature. As an example, Karsten Nohl developed a number of rainbow tables (static values which reduce the time needed to carry out an attack) and have found new sources for known plaintext attacks. He said that it is possible to build &quot;a full GSM interceptor... from open-source components&quot; but that they had not done so because of legal concerns. Nohl claimed that he was able to intercept voice and text conversations by impersonating another user to listen to voicemail, make calls, or send text messages using a seven-year-old Motorola cellphone and decryption software available for free online.

GSM uses General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) for data transmissions like browsing the web. The most commonly deployed GPRS ciphers were publicly broken in 2011.

The researchers revealed flaws in the commonly used GEA/1 and GEA/2 (standing for GPRS Encryption Algorithms 1 and 2) ciphers and published the open-source &quot;gprsdecode&quot; software for sniffing GPRS networks. They also noted that some carriers do not encrypt the data (i.e., using GEA/0) in order to detect the use of traffic or protocols they do not like (e.g., Skype), leaving customers unprotected. GEA/3 seems to remain relatively hard to break and is said to be in use on some more modern networks. If used with USIM to prevent connections to fake base stations and downgrade attacks, users will be protected in the medium term, though migration to 128-bit GEA/4 is still recommended.

The first public cryptanalysis of GEA/1 and GEA/2 (also written GEA-1 and GEA-2) was done in 2021. It concluded that although using a 64-bit key, the GEA-1 algorithm actually provides only 40 bits of security, due to a relationship between two parts of the algorithm. The researchers found that this relationship was very unlikely to have happened if it was not intentional. This may have been done in order to satisfy European controls on export of cryptographic programs.

== Standards information ==
The GSM systems and services are described in a set of standards governed by ETSI, where a full list is maintained.

== GSM open-source software ==
Several open-source software projects exist that provide certain GSM features:
* gsmd daemon by Openmoko
* OpenBTS develops a Base transceiver station
* &quot;The GSM Software Project&quot; aims to build a GSM analyzer for less than $1,000
* &quot;OsmocomBB&quot; developers intend to replace the proprietary baseband GSM stack with a free software implementation
* YateBTS develops a Base transceiver station

=== Issues with patents and open source ===
Patents remain a problem for any open-source GSM implementation, because it is not possible for GNU or any other free software distributor to guarantee immunity from all lawsuits by the patent holders against the users. Furthermore, new features are being added to the standard all the time which means they have patent protection for a number of years.

The original GSM implementations from 1991 may now be entirely free of patent encumbrances, however patent freedom is not certain due to the United States&#x27; &quot;first to invent&quot; system that was in place until 2012. The &quot;first to invent&quot; system, coupled with &quot;patent term adjustment&quot; can extend the life of a U.S. patent far beyond 20 years from its priority date. It is unclear at this time whether OpenBTS will be able to implement features of that initial specification without limit. As patents subsequently expire, however, those features can be added into the open-source version. , there have been no lawsuits against users of OpenBTS over GSM use.

<text>Garry Kimovich Kasparov (born Garik Kimovich Weinstein on 13 April 1963) is a Russian chess grandmaster, former World Chess Champion (1985–2000), political activist and writer. His peak FIDE chess rating of 2851, achieved in 1999, was the highest recorded until being surpassed by Magnus Carlsen in 2013. From 1984 until his retirement from regular competitive chess in 2005, Kasparov was ranked the world&#x27;s #1 player for a record 255 months overall. Kasparov also holds records for the most consecutive professional tournament victories (15) and Chess Oscars (11).

Kasparov became the youngest-ever undisputed world champion in 1985 at age 22 by defeating then-champion Anatoly Karpov, a record he held until 2024, when Gukesh Dommaraju won the title at age 18. He defended the title against Karpov three times, in 1986, 1987 and 1990. Kasparov held the official FIDE world title until 1993, when a dispute with FIDE led him to set up a rival organisation, the Professional Chess Association. In 1997, he became the first world champion to lose a match to a computer under standard time controls when he was defeated by the IBM supercomputer Deep Blue in a highly publicised match. He continued to hold the &quot;Classical&quot; world title until his defeat by Vladimir Kramnik in 2000. Despite losing the PCA title, he continued winning tournaments and was the world&#x27;s highest-rated player at the time of his official retirement. Kasparov coached Carlsen in 2009–10, during which time Carlsen rose to world no. 1. Kasparov stood unsuccessfully for FIDE president in 2013–2014.

Since retiring from chess, Kasparov has devoted his time to writing and politics. His book series &quot;My Great Predecessors&quot;, first published in 2003, details the history and games of the world champion chess players who preceded him. He formed the United Civil Front movement and was a member of The Other Russia, a coalition opposing the administration and policies of Vladimir Putin. In 2008, he announced an intention to run as a candidate in that year&#x27;s Russian presidential race, but after encountering logistical problems in his campaign, for which he blamed &quot;official obstruction&quot;, he withdrew. Following the Russian mass protests that began in 2011, he announced in June 2013 that he had left Russia for the immediate future out of fear of persecution. Following his flight from Russia, he lived in New York City with his family. In 2014, he obtained Croatian citizenship and has maintained a residence in Podstrana near Split.

Kasparov was chairman of the Human Rights Foundation from 2011 to 2024. In 2017, he founded the Renew Democracy Initiative (RDI), an American political organisation promoting and defending liberal democracy in the U.S. and abroad. He serves as chairman of the group.

== Early life ==

Kasparov was born Garik Kimovich Weinstein () in Baku, Azerbaijan SSR (now Azerbaijan), Soviet Union. His father, Kim Moiseyevich Weinstein, was Jewish and his mother, Klara Shagenovna Kasparova, was Armenian. Both of his mother&#x27;s parents were Armenians from Karabakh. When he was seven years old, his father died of leukaemia. Kasparov has described himself as a &quot;self-appointed Christian&quot;, although &quot;very indifferent&quot; and identifying as Russian: &quot;[A]lthough I&#x27;m half-Armenian, half-Jewish, I consider myself Russian because Russian is my native tongue, and I grew up with Russian culture.&quot; Kasparov and his family had to flee anti-Armenian pogroms in Baku in January 1990 that were coordinated by local leaders with Soviet acquiescence. At the age of twelve, Kasparov, upon the request of his mother Klara and with the consent of the family, adopted Klara&#x27;s surname Kasparov.

According to Kasparov himself, he was named after United States President Harry Truman, &quot;whom my father admired for taking a strong stand against communism. It was a rare name in Russia, until Harry Potter came along.&quot;

=== Introduction to chess ===
Kasparov began the serious study of chess after he came across a problem set up by his parents and proposed a solution. 
From age seven, Kasparov attended the Young Pioneer Palace in Baku and, at ten, began training at Mikhail Botvinnik&#x27;s chess school under coach Vladimir Makogonov. Makogonov helped develop Kasparov&#x27;s positional skills and taught him to play the Caro–Kann Defence and the Tartakower System of the Queen&#x27;s Gambit Declined. Kasparov won the Soviet Junior Championship in Tbilisi in 1976, scoring 7/9 points, at age thirteen. He repeated the feat the following year, winning with a score of 8.5/9. He was being coached by Alexander Shakarov during this time.

In 1978, Kasparov participated in the Sokolsky Memorial tournament in Minsk. He had received a special invitation to enter the tournament but took first place and became a chess master. Kasparov has stressed that this event was a turning point in his life and that it convinced him to choose chess as his career: &quot;I will remember the Sokolsky Memorial as long as I live&quot;, he wrote. He has also said that after the victory, he thought he had a very good shot at the world championship.

== Chess career ==

=== Rising up the ranks ===
He first qualified for the USSR Chess Championship at age 15 in 1978, the youngest-ever player at that level. He won the 64-player Swiss system tournament at Daugavpils on a tie-break over Igor V. Ivanov to capture the sole qualifying place.

Kasparov rose quickly through the FIDE world rankings. Due to an oversight by the USSR Chess Federation, which believed that a grandmaster tournament in Banja Luka, Yugoslavia, was for juniors, he participated in that event in 1979 while still unrated. He was a replacement for the Soviet defector Viktor Korchnoi, who was originally invited but withdrew due to the threat of a boycott from the Soviets. Kasparov won this high-class tournament, emerging with a provisional rating of 2595, enough to catapult him to the top group of chess players (at the time, number 15 in the world). The next year, 1980, he won the World Junior Chess Championship in Dortmund, West Germany. Later that year, he made his debut as the second reserve for the Soviet Union at the Chess Olympiad at Valletta, Malta, and became a Grandmaster.

As a teenager, Kasparov shared the USSR Chess Championship in 1981 with Lev Psakhis (12.5/17), although Psakhis won their game. His first win in a superclass-level international tournament was scored at Bugojno, Yugoslavia, in 1982. He earned a place in the 1982 Moscow Interzonal tournament, which he won, to qualify for the Candidates Tournament. At age 19, he was the youngest Candidate since Bobby Fischer, who was 15 when he qualified in 1958. At this stage, he was already the No. 2-rated player in the world, trailing only world champion Karpov on the January 1983 list.
Kasparov&#x27;s first (quarter-final) Candidates match was against Alexander Beliavsky, whom he defeated 6–3 (four wins, one loss). Politics threatened Kasparov&#x27;s semi-final against Korchnoi, which was scheduled to be played in Pasadena, California. Korchnoi had defected from the Soviet Union in 1976 and was at that time the strongest active non-Soviet player. The Soviet authorities would not allow Kasparov to travel to the United States, meaning that Korchnoi could have had a walkover. This decision was met with disapproval by the chess world, and Korchnoi agreed to the match to being played in London instead, along with the previously scheduled match between Vasily Smyslov and Zoltán Ribli. The Kasparov-Korchnoi match was put together on short notice by Raymond Keene. Kasparov lost the first game but won the match 7–4 (four wins, one loss).

In January 1984, Kasparov became the No. 1 ranked player in the world, with a FIDE rating of 2710. He became the youngest-ever world No. 1, a record that lasted 12 years until being broken by Kramnik in January 1996. That same year, he won the Candidates&#x27; final 8½–4½ (four wins, no losses) against former world champion Smyslov at Vilnius, thus qualifying to play Karpov for the world championship.

=== 1984 world championship ===

The World Chess Championship 1984 match between Kasparov and Karpov had many ups and downs and a controversial finish. Karpov started in very good form, and after nine games Kasparov was down 4–0 in a &quot;first to six wins&quot; match. Fellow players predicted he would be whitewashed 6–0 within 18 games.

In an unexpected turn of events, there followed a series of 17 successive draws, some relatively short, others drawn in unsettled positions. Kasparov lost game 27 (5–0), then fought back with another series of draws until game 32, earning his first-ever win against the world champion and bringing the score to 5–1. Another 14 successive draws followed, through game 46; the previous record length for a world title match had been 34 games (José Raúl Capablanca vs. Alexander Alekhine in 1927).

Kasparov won games 47 and 48 to bring the score to 5–3 in Karpov&#x27;s favour. Then the match was ended without result by FIDE President Florencio Campomanes, and a new match was announced to start a few months later. The termination was controversial, as both players stated that they preferred the match to continue. Announcing his decision, Campomanes cited the health of the players, which had been strained by the length of the match. According to grandmasters Boris Gulko and Korchnoi, and historians Vladimir Popow and Yuri Felshtinsky in their &quot;The KGB Plays Chess&quot; book, Campomanes had been a KGB agent and was tasked with preventing Karpov&#x27;s defeat at all costs. The match was terminated while Karpov was still ahead to avoid the impression that the decision had been made for his benefit.

The match became the first, and so far only, world championship match to be abandoned without a result. Kasparov&#x27;s relations with Campomanes and FIDE became strained, and matters came to a head in 1993 with Kasparov&#x27;s complete break-away from FIDE.

=== World champion ===

The second Karpov–Kasparov match in 1985 was organised in Moscow as the best of 24 games, where the first player to win 12½ points would claim the title. The scores from the terminated match would not carry over; however, in the event of a 12–12 draw, the title would remain with Karpov. On 9 November 1985, Kasparov secured the world crown by a score of 13–11. Karpov, with White, needed to win the 24th game to retain the title but Kasparov won it with the Sicilian Defence. He was 22 years old at the time, making him the youngest-ever world champion, a record held by Mikhail Tal for over 20 years. Kasparov&#x27;s win with Black in the 16th game has been recognised as one of the all-time chess masterpieces, including being voted the best game played during the first 64 issues of the magazine &quot;Chess Informant.&quot;

As part of the arrangements following the aborted 1984 match, Karpov had been granted (in the event of his defeat) a right to rematch. Another match took place in 1986, hosted jointly in London and Leningrad, with each city hosting 12 games. At one point in the match, Kasparov opened a three-point lead and looked well on his way to a decisive victory. But Karpov fought back by winning three consecutive games to level the score late in the match. At this point, Kasparov dismissed one of his seconds, grandmaster Evgeny Vladimirov, accusing him of selling his opening preparation to the Karpov team (as described in Kasparov&#x27;s autobiography &quot;Unlimited Challenge&quot;, chapter Stab in the Back). Kasparov scored one more win and kept his title by a score of 12½–11½.

A fourth match for the world title took place in 1987 in Seville, as Karpov had qualified through the Candidates&#x27; Matches to become the official challenger once again. This match was also very close, with neither player holding more than a one-point lead at any time. With one game left, Kasparov was down a point and needed a win to draw the match and retain his title. A long, tense game ensued, in which Karpov blundered away a pawn just before the first time control. Kasparov then won a long ending to retain the title on a 12–12 scoreline.

Kasparov and Karpov met for a fifth time, on this occasion in New York City and Lyon in 1990, with each city hosting 12 games. Again, the result was a close one, with Kasparov winning by a margin of 12½–11½. In their five world championship matches, Kasparov had 21 wins, 19 losses and 104 draws in 144 games.

=== Break with and ejection from FIDE ===

In November 1986, Kasparov had created the Grandmasters Association (GMA) to represent professional players and give them more say in FIDE&#x27;s activities. Kasparov assumed a leadership role. GMA&#x27;s major achievement was in organising a series of six World Cup tournaments for the world&#x27;s top players. This caused an uneasy relationship to develop between Kasparov and FIDE. The previous month, Kasparov had made his feelings clear to fellow grandmaster Keene: &quot;Campomanes must go. It is war to the death with him as far as I am concerned. I will do everything I can to remove him”.

This stand-off lasted until 1993, by which time a new challenger had qualified through the Candidates cycle: Nigel Short, a British grandmaster who had defeated Karpov in a qualifying match and then Jan Timman in the finals held in early 1993. After a confusing and compressed bidding process produced lower financial estimates than expected, the world champion and his challenger both rejected FIDE&#x27;s bid for an August match in Manchester and decided to play outside FIDE&#x27;s jurisdiction. Their match took place under the auspices of the Professional Chess Association (PCA), an organisation established by Kasparov and Short. At this point, a fracture occurred in the lineage of the FIDE World Championship. In an interview in 2007, Kasparov called the break with FIDE in 1993 the worst mistake of his career, as it hurt the game in the long run.

Kasparov and Short were ejected from FIDE and played their well-sponsored match in London in September 1993. Kasparov won convincingly by a score of 12½–7½. The match considerably raised the profile of chess in the UK, with a substantial level of coverage on Channel 4. Meanwhile, FIDE organised its world championship match between Timman (the defeated Candidates finalist) and former world champion Karpov (a defeated Candidates semi-finalist), which Karpov won.

FIDE removed Kasparov and Short from its rating list. Subsequently, the PCA created a rating list of its own, which featured all the world&#x27;s top players regardless of their relation to FIDE. There were now two world champions: PCA champion Kasparov and FIDE champion Karpov. The title remained split for 13 years.

Kasparov defended his PCA title in a 1995 match against Viswanathan Anand at the World Trade Center in New York City. Kasparov won the match by four wins to one, with thirteen draws.

Kasparov tried to organise another world championship match under a different organisation, the World Chess Association (WCA), with Linares organiser Luis Rentero. Alexei Shirov and Kramnik played a candidates match to decide the challenger, which Shirov won in an upset. But when Rentero admitted that the funds required and promised had never materialised, the WCA collapsed. Yet another body stepped in, BrainGames.com, headed by Raymond Keene. After a match with Shirov could not be agreed by BrainGames.com and talks with Anand collapsed, a match was instead arranged against Kramnik.

During this period, Kasparov was approached by Oakham School in the United Kingdom, at the time the only school in the country with a full-time chess coach, and developed an interest in the use of chess in education. In 1997, Kasparov supported a scholarship programme at the school. Kasparov also won the Marca Leyenda trophy that year.

In 1999, he played a well-known game against Topalov wherein he won after a rook sacrifice and king hunt.

=== Losing the title and aftermath ===

The Kasparov-Kramnik match took place in London during the latter half of 2000. Kramnik had been a student of Kasparov&#x27;s at the famous Botvinnik/Kasparov chess school in Russia and had served on Kasparov&#x27;s team for the 1995 match with Anand.

The better-prepared Kramnik won game 2 against Kasparov&#x27;s Grünfeld Defence and achieved winning positions in games 4 and 6, although Kasparov managed a draw in both games. Kasparov made a critical error in game 10 with the Nimzo-Indian Defence, which Kramnik exploited to win in 25 moves. As White, Kasparov could not crack the passive but solid Berlin Defence in the Ruy Lopez, and Kramnik managed to draw all his games as Black. Kramnik won the match 8½–6½.

Kasparov won a series of major tournaments and remained the PCA top-rated player in the world, ahead of both Kramnik and the FIDE World Champion. In 2001, he refused an invitation to the 2002 Dortmund Candidates Tournament for the Classical title, claiming his results had earned him a rematch with Kramnik.

Kasparov and Karpov played a four-game match with rapid time controls over two days in December 2002 in New York City. Kasparov suffered a surprise loss (1.5 – 2.5).

Because of Kasparov&#x27;s continuing strong results and status as FIDE world No. 1, he was included in the so-called &quot;Prague Agreement&quot;, masterminded by Yasser Seirawan and intended to reunite the two world championships. Kasparov was to play a match against the FIDE World Champion Ponomariov in September 2003. But this match was called off after Ponomariov refused to sign his contract for it without reservation. In its place, there were plans for a match against Rustam Kasimdzhanov, winner of the FIDE World Chess Championship 2004, to be held in January 2005 in the United Arab Emirates. These also fell through owing to a lack of funding. Plans to hold the match in Turkey instead came too late. Kasparov announced in January 2005 that he was tired of waiting for FIDE to arrange a match and had decided to stop all efforts to become undisputed world champion once more.

=== Retirement from regular competitive chess ===

After winning the prestigious Linares tournament for the ninth time, Kasparov announced on 10 March 2005 that he would retire from regular competitive chess. He cited as the reason a lack of personal goals in the chess world. When winning the Russian championship in 2004, he commented that it had been the last major title he had never won outright. He also expressed frustration at the failure to reunify the world championship.

Kasparov said he might play in some rapid chess events for fun, but he intended to spend more time on his books, including the &quot;My Great Predecessors&quot; series, and work on the links between decision-making in chess and other areas of life. He also stated that he would continue to involve himself in Russian politics, which he viewed as &quot;headed down the wrong path.&quot;

=== Post-retirement chess ===
On 22 August 2006, in his first public chess games since his retirement, Kasparov played in the Lichthof Chess Champions Tournament, a blitz event played at the time control of five minutes per side and three-second increments per move. Kasparov tied for first with Karpov, scoring 4½/6.

Kasparov and Karpov played a 12-game match from 21 to 24 September 2009, in Valencia, Spain. It consisted of four rapid (or semi rapid) games, in which Kasparov won 3–1, and eight blitz games, in which Kasparov won 6–2, winning the match with a final result of 9–3. The event took place exactly 25 years after the two players&#x27; unfinished encounter at World Chess Championship 1984.

Kasparov coached Carlsen for approximately one year, beginning in February 2009. The collaboration remained secret until September 2009. Under Kasparov&#x27;s tutelage, in October 2009 Carlsen became the youngest ever to achieve a FIDE rating higher than 2800, and he rose from world number four to world number one. While the pair initially planned to work together throughout 2010, in March of that year it was announced that Carlsen had split from Kasparov and would no longer be using him as a trainer. According to an interview with the German magazine &quot;Der Spiegel&quot;, Carlsen indicated that he would remain in contact and that he would continue to attend training sessions with Kasparov; however, no further training sessions were held, and the cooperation fizzled out over the course of the spring. In 2011, Carlsen said: &quot;Thanks to [Kasparov] I began to understand a whole class of positions better. ... Kasparov gave me a great deal of practical help.&quot; In 2012, when asked what he learnt from working with Kasparov, Carlsen answered: &quot;Complex positions. That was the most important thing.&quot;

In May 2010, Kasparov played and won 30 games simultaneously against players at Tel Aviv University in Israel. In the same month, it was revealed that he had aided Anand in his preparation for the World Chess Championship 2010 against challenger Veselin Topalov. Anand won the match 6½–5½ to retain the title.
Kasparov began training the U.S. grandmaster Hikaru Nakamura in January 2011. The first of several training sessions was held in New York just before Nakamura participated in the Tata Steel Chess tournament in Wijk aan Zee, the Netherlands. In December 2011, it was announced that their cooperation had come to an end.

Kasparov played two blitz exhibition matches in the autumn of 2011. The first was in September against French grandmaster Maxime Vachier-Lagrave, in Clichy (France), which Kasparov won 1½–½. The second was a longer match consisting of eight blitz games played on 9 October, against English grandmaster Short. Kasparov won again by a score of 4½–3½. A little after that, in October 2011, Kasparov played and defeated fourteen opponents in a simultaneous exhibition that took place in Bratislava.

On 25 and 26 April 2015, Kasparov played a mini-match against Short. The match consisted of two rapid games and eight blitz games and was contested over the course of two days. Commentators GM Maurice Ashley and Alejandro Ramírez remarked how Kasparov was an &#x27;initiative hog&#x27; throughout the match, consistently not allowing Short to gain any foothold in the games. Kasparov won the match decisively (8½–1½), winning all five games on the second day. These victories were characterised by aggressive pawn moves breaking up Short&#x27;s position, thereby allowing Kasparov&#x27;s pieces to achieve positional superiority.

Kasparov played and won all nineteen games of a simultaneous exhibition in Pula, Croatia on 19 August 2015. At the Chess Club and Scholastic Center of Saint Louis on 28 and 29 April 2016, Kasparov played a 6-round exhibition blitz round-robin tournament with Fabiano Caruana, Wesley So and Nakamura in an event called the Ultimate Blitz Challenge. He finished the tournament third with 9.5/18, behind Nakamura (11/18) and So (10/18). At the post-tournament interview, Kasparov announced that he would donate his winnings from playing the next top-level blitz exhibition match to assist funding of the American Olympic Team.

On 2 June 2016, Kasparov played against fifteen chess players in a simultaneous exhibition in the Kaiser-Friedrich-Halle of Mönchengladbach. He won all games.

==== Candidate for FIDE presidency ====
On 7 October 2013, Kasparov announced his candidacy for World Chess Federation president during a reception in Tallinn, Estonia, where the 84th FIDE Congress took place. He was supported by reigning world champion and FIDE #1 ranked player Carlsen. At the FIDE General Assembly in August 2014, Kasparov lost the presidential election to the incumbent Kirsan Ilyumzhinov, with a vote of 110–61.

A few days before the election took place, the &quot;New York Times Magazine&quot; had published a report on the viciously fought campaign. Included was information about a leaked contract between Kasparov and former FIDE Secretary General Ignatius Leong from Singapore, in which the Kasparov campaign reportedly &quot;offered to pay Leong US$500,000 and to pay $250,000 a year for four years to the ASEAN Chess Academy, an organisation Leong helped create to teach the game, specifying that Leong would be responsible for delivering 11 votes from his region [...]&quot;. In September 2015, the FIDE Ethics Commission found Kasparov and Leong guilty of violating its Code of Ethics and later suspended them for two years from all FIDE functions and meetings.

=== Return from chess retirement ===
Kasparov came out of retirement to participate in the inaugural St. Louis Rapid and Blitz tournament from 14 to 19 August 2017, scoring 3.5/9 in the rapid and 9/18 in the blitz, representing Croatia. He finished eighth in a strong field of ten, including Nakamura, Caruana, former world champion Anand and the eventual winner, Levon Aronian. Kasparov promised that any tournament money he earned would go towards charities to promote chess in Africa.

In 2020, he participated in 9LX, a Chess 960 tournament, and finished eighth of a field of ten players. His game against Carlsen, who tied for first place, was drawn.

He launched Kasparovchess, a subscription-based online chess community featuring documentaries, lessons, puzzles, podcasts, articles, interviews and playing zones, in 2021.

Kasparov played in the blitz section of the Grand Chess Tour 2021 event in Zagreb, Croatia. He performed poorly, however, scoring 0.5/9 on the first day and 2/9 on the second day, getting his only win against Jorden Van Foreest. He also participated in 9LX 2, finishing fifth in a field of ten players, with a score of 5/9.

== Olympiads and major team events ==

Kasparov played in a total of eight Chess Olympiads. He represented the Soviet Union four times and Russia four times, following the break-up of the Soviet Union in 1991. In his 1980 Olympiad debut, he became, at age 17, the youngest player to represent the Soviet Union or Russia at that level, a record which was broken by Kramnik in 1992. In 82 games, he scored (+50−3=29), for 78.7%, and won a total of nineteen medals, including team gold medals all eight times he competed.

For the 1994 Moscow Olympiad, he had a significant organisational role in helping to put together the event on short notice, after Thessaloniki cancelled its offer to host only a few weeks before the scheduled dates. Kasparov&#x27;s detailed Olympiad record follows:
* Valletta 1980, USSR 2nd reserve, 9½/12 (+8−1=3), team gold, board bronze;
* Lucerne 1982, USSR 2nd board, 8½/11 (+6−0=5), team gold, board bronze;
* Dubai 1986, USSR 1st board, 8½/11 (+7−1=3), team gold, board gold, performance gold;
* Thessaloniki 1988, USSR 1st board, 8½/10 (+7−0=3), team gold, board gold, performance gold;
* Manila 1992, Russia board 1, 8½/10 (+7−0=3), team gold, board gold, performance silver;
* Moscow 1994, Russia board 1, 6½/10 (+4−1=5), team gold;
* Yerevan 1996, Russia board 1, 7/9 (+5−0=4), team gold, board silver, performance gold;
* Bled 2002, Russia board 1, 7½/9 (+6−0=3), team gold, performance gold.

Kasparov made his international debut for the USSR at age 16 in the 1980 European Team Championship and played for Russia in the 1992 edition of that championship. He won a total of five medals. His detailed record in this event follows:
* Skara 1980, USSR 2nd reserve, 5½/6 (+5−0=1), team gold, board gold;
* Debrecen 1992, Russia board 1, 6/8 (+4−0=4), team gold, board gold, performance silver.

Kasparov also represented the USSR once at the Youth Olympiad in Austria (1981). He scored 9/10 (+8–0=2) on the top board and his team lifted the title.

==Assessment and legacy==
Kasparov received a Chess Oscar eleven times as the best chess player of the year, in 1982–1983, 1985–1988, 1995–1996, 1999, and 2001–2002. Between 1981 and 1991, he won or tied for first place in every tournament he entered. In 1999, Kasparov reached an Elo rating of 2851 points, a record that stood for over thirteen years: on 10 December 2012, Carlsen achieved an unofficial rating of 2861 points, with which he topped the next release of the rating in January 2013. With the exception of the PCA period and sharing first place with Kramnik in 1997, Kasparov led the rating list from 1985 to 2006 – a total of 255 months. On 1 January 2006, Kasparov ranked first with a coefficient of 2812. However, he was excluded from the FIDE rating list of 1 April 2006 because he had not participated in tournaments for the previous twelve months.

The rivalry between Kasparov and Karpov (often referred to as the &quot;two Ks&quot;) is one of the greatest in the history of chess. In six years they played five matches comprising 144 games. For a long time there was personal enmity between Karpov and Kasparov. The conflict between the two men also had a political connotation. Karpov was considered a representative of the Soviet nomenklatura, while Kasparov was young and popular, positioned himself as a &quot;child of change&quot;, willingly gave candid interviews and (especially in the West) had an aura of a rebel, although he was never a dissident. Kasparov&#x27;s 1985 victory coincided with the start of perestroika in the Soviet Union.

Carlsen said of Kasparov: &quot;I&#x27;ve never seen someone with such a feel for dynamics in complex positions.&quot; Kramnik has opined that Kasparov&#x27;s &quot;capacity for study is second to none&quot;, adding &quot;There is nothing in chess he has been unable to deal with.&quot;

In 2007, the international consulting company Synectics published a rating of 100 living geniuses in science, politics, art and entrepreneurship, in which Kasparov ranked 25th.

Less known about Kasparov is his emphasis on physical fitness, including taking a month off each year to work out strenuously.

===Playing style===
Kramnik called Kasparov a chess player with virtually no weaknesses. His games are characterised by a dynamic style of play with a focus on tactics, depth of strategy, subtle calculation and original opening ideas. Kasparov was known for his extensive opening preparation and aggressive play in it. Sergey Shipov considered Kasparov&#x27;s moral and volitional qualities (impulsiveness and psychological instability) and excessive reliance on options, which can lead to overwork and mistakes, as amongst his few shortcomings.

Kasparov&#x27;s attacking style of play has been compared by many to Alekhine, his chess idol since childhood. Kasparov has described his style as being influenced chiefly by Alekhine, Tal and Fischer. Other influences on Kasparov were his early coaches. At a young age, he met with experienced teachers Alexander Nikitin and Alexander Shakarov. Shakarov collected and systematised materials, and then became the keeper of Kasparov&#x27;s &quot;information bank&quot;. A revolutionary step at that time was the involvement of computer programs in analysing games, and it was Kasparov and his team who took the first steps in this direction. In 1973, Kasparov entered the Botvinnik school and immediately attracted attention. Botvinnik commented on the young schoolboy: &quot;Garry&#x27;s speed and memory capacity are amazing. He counts deep variations and finds unexpected moves. The power of combinational vision makes him similar to Alekhine himself&quot;.

===Contributions to opening theory===
Kasparov has made many contributions to opening theory. In the 1990s, he systematically developed new variants with computer programs. He also &quot;reanimated&quot; the Scotch Game in top-level competitions. Kasparov successfully used this opening, which was considered outdated, in the 1990 match against Karpov and in matches with Short and Anand. One of the offshoots of the Sicilian in the Szén Variation is called the Kasparov Gambit. Kasparov used this variation in the 12th and 16th games of the match with Karpov in 1985; in the second of these games, he scored a victory.

Another well-known case of winning an important game thanks to a novelty in the opening is Kasparov&#x27;s 10th game of the 1995 match against Anand. On the 14th move, in a well-known position of the open variation of the Spanish Game (Ruy Lopez), Kasparov discovered a new idea with a rook sacrifice, which brought a decisive attack.

Kasparov has also co-authored several books on opening theory.

===Chess rating===
Kasparov holds the record for the longest time as the No. 1 rated player in the world—from 1984 to 2005 (Kramnik shared the No. 1 ranking with him once, in the January 1996 FIDE rating list). He headed the PCA rating list during the split from FIDE. At the time of his retirement, he was still ranked No. 1 in the world, with a rating of 2812. His rating has fallen inactive since the January 2006 rating list.

In January 1990, Kasparov achieved the (then) highest FIDE rating ever, passing 2800 and breaking Fischer&#x27;s old record of 2785. By the July 1999 and January 2000 FIDE rating lists, Kasparov had reached a 2851 Elo rating, at that time the highest rating ever achieved. He held that record until Carlsen attained a new record high rating of 2861 in January 2013.

===Other achievements===
Kasparov holds the record for most consecutive professional tournament victories, placing first or equal first in fifteen individual tournaments from 1981 to 1990. The streak was broken by Vasyl Ivanchuk at Linares 1991, where Kasparov placed second, half a point behind him after losing their individual game. The details of this record winning streak follow:
* Frunze 1981, USSR Championship, 12½/17, tie for 1st;
* Bugojno 1982, 9½/13, 1st;
* Moscow 1982, Interzonal, 10/13, 1st;
* Nikšić 1983, 11/14, 1st;
* Brussels OHRA 1986, 7½/10, 1st;
* Brussels SWIFT 1987, 8½/11, tie for 1st;
* Amsterdam Optiebeurs 1988, 9/12, 1st;
* Belfort (World Cup) 1988, 11½/15, 1st;
* Moscow 1988, USSR Championship, 11½/17, tie for 1st;
* Reykjavík (World Cup) 1988, 11/17, 1st;
* Barcelona (World Cup) 1989, 11/16, tie for 1st;
* Skellefteå (World Cup) 1989, 9½/15, tie for 1st;
* Tilburg 1989, 12/14, 1st;
* Belgrade (Investbank) 1989, 9½/11, 1st;
* Linares 1990, 8/11, 1st.

Kasparov went nine years winning every super-tournament he played, in addition to contesting his series of five consecutive matches with Karpov. His only failure in this time period in either tournament or match play was the 1984 world title match against Karpov.

In the late 1990s, Kasparov went on another long streak of ten consecutive super-tournament wins.
* Wijk aan Zee Hoogovens 1999, 10/13, 1st;
* Linares 1999, 10½/14, 1st;
* Sarajevo 1999, 7/9, 1st;
* Wijk aan Zee Corus 2000, 9½/13, 1st;
* Linares 2000, 6/10, tie for 1st;
* Sarajevo 2000, 8½/11, 1st;
* Wijk aan Zee Corus 2001, 9/13, 1st;
* Linares 2001, 7.5/10, 1st;
* Astana 2001, 7/10, 1st;
* Linares 2002, 8/12, 1st.

In these tournament victories, Kasparov had a score of 53 wins, 61 draws and 1 loss in 115 games, his only defeat coming against Ivan Sokolov in Wijk aan Zee 1999.

===Notable games===
*Anatoly Karpov vs Garry Kasparov, World Chess Championship 1985, Game 16, Sicilian Defence, Taimanov variation (B44), 0-1 An example of him at his very best, Kasparov takes advantage of Karpov&#x27;s setup in the opening, offering a pawn sacrifice before dominating all three of White&#x27;s major pieces with an &quot;octopus knight&quot; on d3.
*Garry Kasparov vs Veselin Topalov, Hoogovens Tournament Group A, Wijk aan Zee 1999, Round 4, Pirc Defence (B07), 1-0 In what is widely regarded as his masterpiece, Kasparov unleashes multiple brilliancies as he hunts down Black&#x27;s king from one side of the board to another, ending in a precise combination.

== Chess and computers ==
Acorn Computers acted as one of the sponsors for Kasparov&#x27;s Candidates semi-final match against Korchnoi in 1983. This was Kasparov&#x27;s first introduction to computers. Kasparov was awarded a BBC Micro, which he took back with him to Baku, making it perhaps one of the first Western-made microcomputers to reach the Soviet Union at that time.

Computer chess magazine editor Frederic Friedel consulted with Kasparov in 1985 on how a chess database program would be useful preparation for competition. Friedel founded Chessbase two years later, and he gave a copy of the program to Kasparov, who started using it in his preparation. That same year, Kasparov played against thirty-two chess computers in Hamburg, winning all games. Several commercially available Kasparov computers were made in the 1980s, the Saitek Kasparov Turbo King models. On 22 October 1989, Kasparov defeated the chess computer Deep Thought in both games of a two-game match. In December 1992, Kasparov played thirty-seven blitz games against Fritz 2 in Cologne, winning 24, drawing 4 and losing 9.

Kasparov cooperated in producing video material for the computer game &quot;Kasparov&#x27;s Gambit&quot; released by Electronic Arts in November 1993. In April 1994, Intel acted as a sponsor for the first Professional Chess Association Grand Prix event in Moscow, played at a time control of twenty-five minutes per game. In May, Chessbase&#x27;s Fritz 3 running on an Intel Pentium PC defeated Kasparov in their first game in the Intel Express blitz tournament in Munich, but Kasparov managed to tie it for first and won the play-off (+3=2). The next day, Kasparov lost to Fritz 3 again in a game on ZDF TV. In August, Kasparov was knocked out of the London Intel Grand Prix by Richard Lang&#x27;s ChessGenius 2 program in the first round. In 1995, during Kasparov&#x27;s world title match with Anand, he unveiled an opening novelty that had been checked with a chess engine, an approach that would become increasingly common in subsequent years.

Kasparov played in a pair of six-game chess matches with IBM supercomputer Deep Blue. The first match took place in Philadelphia in February 1996 and was won by Kasparov (4–2). The second was played in New York City in May 1997 and won by Deep Blue (3½–2½). The 1997 match was the first defeat of a reigning world champion by a computer under tournament conditions.
The match was even after five games but Kasparov lost quickly in Game 6. Kasparov said that he was &quot;not well prepared&quot; to face Deep Blue in 1997. He said that based on his &quot;objective strengths&quot; his play was stronger than that of Deep Blue. Kasparov claimed that several factors weighed against him in this match. In particular, he was denied access to Deep Blue&#x27;s recent games, in contrast to the computer&#x27;s team, which could study hundreds of Kasparov&#x27;s.

After the loss, Kasparov said that he sometimes saw deep intelligence and creativity in the machine&#x27;s moves, suggesting that during the second game chess players had intervened in contravention of the rules. IBM denied that it had cheated, stating the only human intervention occurred between games. The rules provided for the developers to modify the program between games, an opportunity they said they used to shore up weaknesses in the computer&#x27;s play revealed during the course of the match. Kasparov requested printouts of the machine&#x27;s log files but IBM refused, although the company later published them on the Internet. Much later, it was suggested that the behaviour Kasparov noted had resulted from a glitch in the computer program. Plans for further engagement between Kasparov and IBM, including a rematch, did not come to fruition, due to the accusations of cheating.

Kasparov versus the World was a game that took place in 1999. Kasparov conducted the white moves while more than 50,000 people from all over the globe played against him. The game was a huge mixture of tactical and strategical ideas, with Kasparov saying: &quot;It is the greatest game in the history of chess. The sheer number of ideas, the complexity, and the contribution it has made to chess make it the most important game ever played.&quot; After 62 moves, Kasparov won the game.

In January 2003, he engaged in a six-game classical time control match, with a $1 million prize fund, against Deep Junior. It was billed as the FIDE &quot;Man vs. Machine&quot; world championship. The engine evaluated three million positions per second. After one win each and three draws, it was all up to the final game. After reaching a decent position, Kasparov offered a draw, which was accepted by the Deep Junior team. Asked why he had offered the draw, Kasparov said he feared making a blunder. Deep Junior was the first machine to beat Kasparov with Black and at a standard time control.

In June 2003, Mindscape released the computer game &quot;Kasparov Chessmate&quot;, with Kasparov himself listed as a co-designer. In November 2003, he engaged in a four-game match against the computer program X3D Fritz, using a virtual board, 3D glasses and a speech recognition system. After two draws and one win apiece, the X3D Man–Machine match ended in a draw. Kasparov received $175,000 and took home a golden trophy. He continued to regret the blunder in the second game that cost him a crucial point. He felt that he had outplayed the machine overall and performed well: &quot;I only made one mistake but unfortunately that one mistake lost the game.&quot;

In 2021, Kasparov promoted a series of 32 NFTs that detailed important moments in his career. The top four sold for more than $11,000.

==Politics and political views==

===Russia===

====Early political activities====
Kasparov&#x27;s grandfather was a staunch communist, but the young Kasparov gradually began to have doubts about the Soviet Union&#x27;s political system at age 13 when he travelled abroad for the first time in 1976 to Paris for a chess tournament. In 1981, at age 18, he read Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn&#x27;s &quot;The Gulag Archipelago&quot;, a copy of which he bought while abroad. Nevertheless, Kasparov joined the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU) in 1984, and was elected to the Central Committee of Komsomol in 1987. In 1990, he left the party.

In May 1990, Kasparov took part in the creation of the Democratic Party of Russia. He left the party on 28 April 1991, after its conference. Kasparov was also involved with the creation of the &quot;Choice of Russia&quot; bloc of parties in June 1993. He took part in the election campaign of Boris Yeltsin in 1996. In 2001, he voiced his support for the Russian television channel NTV.

After his retirement from chess in 2005, Kasparov turned to politics and created the United Civil Front, a social movement whose main goal is to &quot;work to preserve electoral democracy in Russia&quot;. He has vowed to &quot;restore democracy&quot; to Russia by restoring the rule of law. A year later the United Civil Front became part of The Other Russia. Kasparov was instrumental in setting up this coalition, which opposes Putin&#x27;s government and the United Russia party. The Other Russia was boycotted by the leaders of Russia&#x27;s mainstream opposition parties, Yabloko and Union of Right Forces, due to its inclusion of both nationalist and radical groups. Kasparov has criticised these two parties as being secretly under the auspices of the Kremlin.

In April 2005, Kasparov was in Moscow at a promotional event when he was struck over the head with a chessboard he had just signed. The assailant was reported to have said: &quot;I admired you as a chess player, but you gave that up for politics&quot; immediately before the attack. Kasparov has been the subject of a number of other episodes since, including police brutality and alleged harassment from the Russian secret service.
Kasparov helped organise the Saint Petersburg Dissenters&#x27; March on 3 March 2007 and The March of the Dissenters on 24 March 2007, both involving several thousand people rallying against Putin and Saint Petersburg Governor Valentina Matviyenko.

Kasparov led a pro-democracy demonstration in Moscow in April 2007. Soon after it started, however, over 9,000 police descended on the group and seized almost everyone. Kasparov, who was briefly arrested, was warned by the prosecution office on the eve of the march that anyone participating risked being detained. He was held for some ten hours and then fined and released. He was later summoned by the FSB for violations of Russian anti-extremism laws.

Speaking about Kasparov in 2007, former KGB defector Oleg Kalugin remarked: &quot;I do not talk in details – people who knew them are all dead now because they were vocal, they were open. I am quiet. There is only one man who is vocal, and he may be in trouble: world chess champion Kasparov. He has been very outspoken in his attacks on Putin, and I believe that he is probably next on the list.&quot;

====Presidential candidate (2008)====
On 30 September 2007, Kasparov entered the Russian presidential race, receiving 379 of 498 votes at a congress held in Moscow by The Other Russia. In October 2007, Kasparov announced his intention of standing for the Russian presidency as the candidate of the &quot;Other Russia&quot; coalition and vowed to fight for a &quot;democratic and just Russia&quot;. Later that month he travelled to the United States, where he appeared on several popular television programmes.

In November 2007, Kasparov and other protesters were detained by police at an Other Russia rally in Moscow, which drew 3,000 demonstrators to protest against election rigging. Following an attempt by about 100 protesters to march through police lines to the electoral commission, which had barred Other Russia candidates from parliamentary elections, arrests were made. The Russian authorities stated a rally had been approved but not any marches, resulting in several demonstrators being detained. Kasparov was subsequently charged with resisting arrest and organising an unauthorised protest, and was given a jail sentence of five days. Kasparov appealed the charges, citing that he had been following orders given by the police. He was released from jail on 29 November. Putin castigated Kasparov at the rally for his use of English when speaking rather than Russian.

In December 2007, Kasparov announced that he had to withdraw his presidential candidacy due to inability to rent a meeting hall where at least 500 of his supporters could assemble. With the deadline expiring on that date, he explained it was impossible for him to run. Russian election laws required sufficient meeting hall space for assembling supporters. Kasparov&#x27;s spokeswoman accused the government of using pressure to deter anyone from renting a hall for the gathering and said that the electoral commission had rejected a proposal that would have allowed for smaller gathering sizes rather than one large gathering at a meeting hall.

====Opposition to Putin administration (2010–2013)====
Kasparov was among the 34 first signatories and a key organiser of the online anti-Putin campaign &quot;Putin must go&quot;, started on 10 March 2010. Within the text is a call to Russian law enforcement to ignore Putin&#x27;s orders. By June 2011, there were 90,000 signatures. While the identity of the petition author remained anonymous, there was wide speculation that it was indeed Kasparov. On 31 January 2012, Kasparov hosted a meeting of opposition leaders planning a mass march on 4 February 2012, the third major opposition rally held since the disputed State Duma elections of December 2011. Among other opposition leaders attending were Alexey Navalny and Yevgeniya Chirikova.

Kasparov was arrested and beaten outside a Moscow court on 17 August 2012 while attending sentencing in the case involving the all-female punk band Pussy Riot. On 24 August, he was cleared of charges that he had taken part in an unauthorised protest against the conviction of three members of the band. Judge Yekaterina Veklich said there were &quot;no grounds to believe the testimony of the police&quot;. Kasparov later thanked all the bloggers and reporters who provided video evidence that contradicted the testimony of the police. Kasparov wrote in February 2013 that &quot;fascism has come to Russia. ...Project Putin, just like the old Project Hitler, is but the fruit of a conspiracy by the ruling elite. Fascist rule was never the result of the free will of the people. It was always the fruit of a conspiracy by the ruling elites!&quot;

Kasparov denied rumours in April 2013 that he was planning to leave Russia for good. &quot;I found these rumors to be deeply saddening and, moreover, surprising,&quot; he wrote. &quot;I was unable to respond immediately because I was in such a state of shock that such an incredibly inaccurate statement, the likes of which is constantly distributed by the Kremlin&#x27;s propagandists, came this time from Ilya Yashin, a fellow member of the Opposition Coordination Council (KSO) and my former colleague from the Solidarity movement.&quot; He also accused prominent Russian journalist Vladimir Posner of failing to stand up to Putin and to earlier Russian and Soviet leaders.

However, Kasparov subsequently fled Russia less than three months later. On 6 June 2013, he announced that he had left his homeland on account of fear of persecution for his political views. Further, at the 2013 Women in the World conference, Kasparov told &quot;The Daily Beast&quot;″s Michael Moynihan that democracy no longer existed in what he called Russia&#x27;s &quot;dictatorship&quot;.

====Opposition to Putin from exile (2013–)====

Kasparov said at a press conference in June 2013 that if he returned to Russia, he doubted he would be allowed to leave again, given Putin&#x27;s ongoing crackdown on dissenters. &quot;So for the time being,&quot; he said, &quot;I refrain from returning to Russia.&quot; He explained shortly thereafter in an article for &quot;The Daily Beast&quot; that this had not been intended as &quot;a declaration of leaving my home country, permanently or otherwise&quot;, but merely an expression of &quot;the dark reality of the situation in Russia today, where nearly half the members of the opposition&#x27;s Coordinating Council are under criminal investigation on concocted charges&quot;. He noted that the Moscow prosecutor&#x27;s office was &quot;opening an investigation that would limit my ability to travel&quot;, making it impossible for him to fulfil &quot;professional speaking engagements&quot; and hindering his &quot;work for the non-profit Kasparov Chess Foundation, which has centres in New York City, Brussels and Johannesburg, to promote chess in education&quot;. Kasparov further wrote in his June 2013 &quot;Daily Beast&quot; article that the mass protests in Moscow 18 months earlier against fraudulent Russian elections had been &quot;a proud moment for me&quot;. He recalled that after joining the opposition movement in March 2005, he had been criticised for seeking to unite &quot;every anti-Putin element in the country to march together regardless of ideology&quot;. Therefore, the sight of &quot;hundreds of flags representing every group from liberals to nationalists all marching together for &#x27;Russia Without Putin&#x27; was the fulfillment of a dream.&quot; Yet most Russians, he lamented, had continued to &quot;slumber&quot; even as Putin had &quot;taken off the flimsy mask of democracy to reveal himself in full as the would-be KGB dictator he has always been&quot;.

Kasparov responded with several Twitter postings to a September 2013 &quot;The New York Times&quot; op-ed by Putin. &quot;I hope Putin has taken adequate protections,&quot; he tweeted. &quot;Now that he is a Russian journalist his life may be in grave danger!&quot; Also: &quot;Now we can expect NY Times op-eds by Mugabe on fair elections, Castro on free speech, &amp; Kim Jong-un on prison reform. The Axis of Hypocrisy.&quot;

Kasparov wrote in July 2013 about the trial in Kirov of fellow opposition leader Navalny, who had been convicted &quot;on concocted embezzlement charges&quot;, only to see the prosecutor, surprisingly, ask for his release the next day pending appeal. &quot;The judicial process and the democratic process in Russia,&quot; wrote Kasparov, &quot;are both elaborate mockeries created to distract the citizenry at home and to help Western leaders avoid confronting the awkward fact that Russia has returned to a police state&quot;. Still, Kasparov felt that whatever had caused the Kirov prosecutor&#x27;s about-face, &quot;my optimism tells me it was a positive sign. After more than 13 years of predictable repression under Putin, anything different is good.&quot;

Kasparov has been outspoken regarding Putin&#x27;s antigay laws, describing them as &quot;only the most recent encroachment on the freedom of speech and association of Russia&#x27;s citizens&quot;, which the international community had largely ignored. Regarding Russia&#x27;s hosting of the 2014 Winter Olympics, Kasparov explained in August 2013 that he had opposed Russia&#x27;s bid from the outset, since it would &quot;allow Vladimir Putin&#x27;s cronies to embezzle hundreds of millions of dollars&quot; and &quot;lend prestige to Putin&#x27;s authoritarian regime&quot;. Kasparov did not support the proposed Sochi Olympics boycott—writing that it would &quot;unfairly punish athletes&quot;—but called for athletes and others to &quot;transform Putin&#x27;s self-congratulatory pet project into a spotlight that exposes his authoritarian rule&quot; to the world. In September, Kasparov called upon politicians to refuse to attend the games and the public to pressure sponsors and the media, such that Coca-Cola, for example, could put &quot;a rainbow flag on each Coca-Cola can&quot; and NBC could &quot;do interviews with Russian gay activists or with Russian political activists&quot;. Kasparov also emphasised that although he was &quot;still a Russian citizen&quot;, he had &quot;good reason to be concerned about my ability to leave Russia if I returned to Moscow&quot;.

Kasparov spoke out against the 2014 Russian annexation of Crimea and has stated that control of Crimea should be returned to Ukraine after the overthrow of Putin without additional conditions. Kasparov&#x27;s website was blocked by the Russian government censorship agency, Roskomnadzor, at the behest of the public prosecutor, allegedly due to Kasparov&#x27;s opinions on the annexation of Crimea. Kasparov&#x27;s block was made in unison with several other notable Russian sites that were accused of inciting public outrage. Reportedly, several of the blocked sites received an affidavit noting their violations. However, Kasparov stated that his site had received no such notice of violations after its block. In 2015, a whole note on Kasparov was removed from a Russian language encyclopaedia of greatest Soviet players after an intervention from &quot;senior leadership&quot;.

In October 2015, Kasparov published a book titled &quot;Winter Is Coming: Why Vladimir Putin and the Enemies of the Free World Must Be Stopped&quot;. In the book, Kasparov likens Putin to Adolf Hitler and explains the need for the West to oppose Putin sooner, rather than appeasing him and postponing the eventual confrontation. According to his publisher, &quot;Kasparov wants this book out fast, in a way that has potential to influence the discussion during the primary season.&quot; In 2018, he said that &quot;anything is better than Putin because that eliminates the probability of a nuclear war. Putin is insane.&quot;

Following reports of Russian ransomware attacks against American agencies and companies in 2021, Kasparov stated that &quot;the only language that Putin understands is power, and his power is his money,&quot; arguing that the United States should target the bank accounts of Russian oligarchs to force Russia to rein in its criminals&#x27; cyberattacks.

Kasparov spoke out against the invasion of Ukraine by Russia on Twitter: &quot;The only way this really ends is the fall of Putin&#x27;s regime by collapse of Russian economy and defeat in Ukraine.&quot; He also believed that &quot;pressure must be kept up&quot; in terms of sanctions and condemnations against Russia&#x27;s actions and joined with other prominent Russian figures-in-exile to form the Anti-War Committee of Russia. He said that Russia should be &quot;thrown back into the Stone Age to make sure that the oil and gas industry and any other sensitive industries that are vital for survival of the regime cannot function without Western technological support.&quot;

On 20 May 2022, Kasparov was designated as &quot;foreign agent&quot; by the Ministry of Justice of the Russian Federation.

In May 2023, along with a large group of fellow exiles, Kasparov participated in the drafting of Mikhail Khodorkovsky&#x27;s &quot;Declaration of Russia&#x27;s Democratic Forces&quot;.

On 4 August 2023, Kasparov participated on the radio show &quot;Open to Debate&quot;. In a debate with Charles Kupchan, he argued for Ukrainian admission into NATO and against any form of appeasement towards Putin.

In March 2024, Russia placed Kasparov on its list of &quot;terrorists and extremists.&quot;

On 24 April 2024 an arrest warrant was issued by a court in Russia&#x27;s Komi region charging Kasparov of creating and leading a &quot;terrorist&quot; group.

===United States===

Kasparov received the Keeper of the Flame award in 1991 from the Center for Security Policy, a Washington, D.C.-based far-right, anti-Muslim think tank. In his acceptance speech, Kasparov lauded the defeat of communism while also urging the United States to give no financial assistance to central Soviet leaders. Kasparov gave speeches at other think tanks such as the Hoover Institution.

In a 12 May 2013 op-ed for &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, Kasparov questioned reports that the Russian security agency, the FSB, had fully cooperated with the FBI in the matter of the Boston bombers. He noted that the elder bomber, Tamerlan Tsarnaev, had reportedly met in Russia with two known jihadists who &quot;were killed in Dagestan by the Russian military just days before Tamerlan left Russia for the U.S.&quot; Kasparov argued, &quot;If no intelligence was sent from Moscow to Washington&quot; about this meeting, &quot;all this talk of FSB cooperation cannot be taken seriously.&quot; He further observed, &quot;This would not be the first time Russian security forces seemed strangely impotent in the face of an impending terror attack,&quot; pointing out that in both the 2002 Moscow theater siege and the 2004 Beslan school attack, &quot;there were FSB informants in both terror groups – yet the attacks went ahead unimpeded.&quot; Given this history, he wrote, &quot;it is impossible to overlook that the Boston bombing took place just days after the U.S. Magnitsky List was published, creating the first serious external threat to the Putin power structure by penalising Russian officials complicit in human-rights crimes.&quot; In sum, Putin&#x27;s &quot;dubious record on counterterrorism and its continued support of terror sponsors Iran and Syria mean only one thing: common ground zero&quot;.

In the 2016 United States presidential election, Kasparov described Republican Donald Trump as &quot;a celebrity showman with racist leanings and authoritarian tendencies&quot; and criticised him for calling for closer ties with Putin. After Trump&#x27;s running mate, Mike Pence, called Putin a strong leader, Kasparov said that Putin is a strong leader &quot;in the same way arsenic is a strong drink&quot;. He also disparaged the economic policies of Democratic primary candidate Bernie Sanders, but showed respect for Sanders as &quot;a charismatic speaker and a passionate believer in his cause&quot;. Kasparov opined that Henry Kissinger &quot;was selling the Trump Administration on the idea of a mirror of 1972 [Richard Nixon&#x27;s visit to China], except, instead of a Sino-U.S. alliance against the U.S.S.R., this would be a Russian-American alliance against China&quot;.

In a 2024 interview with &quot;HuffPost&quot;, Kasparov expressed concern over Elon Musk potentially running the Department of Government Efficiency: &quot;Musk could be the first oligarch&quot;, he stated.

===Armenia===
In a 2020 interview discussing the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, Kasparov stated that the Republic of Artsakh has a right to independence and that Azerbaijan has no sovereign right over it. He considers this stance to be objective and without bias, as Soviet law allowed for autonomous republics (such as the Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast) to vote for independence separately and were given an equal right for self-determination, a factor he felt often went ignored. Kasparov recalled that he was criticised by Armenians for not taking a strong stance when the Karabakh movement began in 1988, explaining that he was living in Baku with 200,000 other Armenians at the time and did not want to increase tensions. Kasparov and his family later fled Baku in January 1990 to escape pogroms against Armenians. Kasparov has declined invitations back to visit Baku, stating he would only return &quot;if every other Armenian born there can do it without a problem and without special favors from the government.&quot;

He welcomed the Velvet Revolution in Armenia in 2018. Kasparov supports Armenian genocide recognition.

===Other international affairs===
During the Yugoslav Wars, Kasparov advocated for the Western world to destroy the Yugoslav People&#x27;s Army and accused Slobodan Milošević of creating a &quot;siege mentality&quot; to maintain control over Serbia. In 1997, he was awarded honorary citizenship of Bosnia and Herzegovina for his support of Bosnian people during the Bosnian War. Kasparov was named Chairman of the Human Rights Foundation in 2011; he served in this position until 2024, being succeeded by Yulia Navalnaya. In addition, Kasparov was presented with the Morris B. Abram Human Rights Award, UN Watch&#x27;s annual human-rights prize, in 2013. The organisation praised him as &quot;not only one of the world&#x27;s smartest men&quot; but &quot;also among its bravest&quot;.

Before the first Gulf War, Kasparov expressed an unconventional viewpoint, recommending the United States to consider the use of an atomic bomb against Saddam Hussein in Iraq. In 2002, supporting military action against Iraq, he also recommended planning for military action against Iran, Syria and Saudi Arabia.

In April 2013, Kasparov joined in an HRF condemnation of Kanye West for having performed for the leader of Kazakhstan in exchange for a payment of $3 million, saying that West &quot;has entertained a brutal killer and his entourage&quot; and that his fee &quot;came from the loot stolen from the Kazakhstan treasury&quot;. Further, in September 2013, Kasparov wrote in &quot;Time&quot; magazine that in Syria, Putin and Bashar al-Assad &quot;won by forfeit when President Obama, Prime Minister Cameron and the rest of the so-called leaders of the free world walked away from the table.&quot; Kasparov lamented the &quot;new game at the negotiating table where Putin and Assad set the rules and will run the show under the protection of the U.N.&quot; Kasparov said in September 2013 that Russia was now a dictatorship. In the same month he told an interviewer that &quot;Obama going to Russia now is dead wrong, morally and politically,&quot; because Putin&#x27;s regime &quot;is behind Assad&quot;.

Kasparov was critical of the violence unleashed by the Spanish police against the 2017 independence referendum in Catalonia and accused the Spanish PM Mariano Rajoy of &quot;betraying&quot; the European promise of peace. After the Catalan regional election held later the same year, Kasparov wrote: &quot;Despite unprecedented pressure from Madrid, Catalonian separatists won a majority. Europe must speak and help find a peaceful path toward resolution and avoid more violence&quot;. Kasparov recommended that Spain look to how Britain handled the 2014 Scottish independence referendum, adding: &quot;look only at how Turkey and Iraq have treated the separatist Kurds. That cannot be the road for Spain and Catalonia.&quot;

On the occasion of the 2015 centennial of the Armenian genocide, Kasparov reflected that in 2002 he had called for Turkey to be admitted to the European Union if Turkey recognised the genocide. He condemned the assassination of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi. In October 2018, Kasparov wrote that President Erdoğan&#x27;s regime in Turkey &quot;has jailed more journalists than any country in the world and scores of them remain in prison in Turkey. Since 2016, Turkey&#x27;s intelligence agency has abducted at least 80 people in operations in 18 countries.&quot;

The BBC Series &quot;Rise of the Nazis&quot; of February 2022 featured Kasparov&#x27;s views on Soviet leader Josef Stalin, &quot;a ruthless dictator&quot;; Kasparov noted Stalin&#x27;s admiration for Hitler in 1940.

In the wake of the 2023 Israel-Hamas war, Kasparov vigorously called on the Biden administration for the destruction of Hamas and Hezbollah. He further demanded the US to set up regime change in Russia and Iran.

====Artificial intelligence====
Speaking to &quot;Forbes&quot; in spring 2023, Kasparov said that he was not overly concerned about the potential for ChatGPT to gain unauthorised access into everyday appliances. Rather, he felt that it is individuals who &quot;still have the monopoly on evil.&quot;

===Croatian citizenship===
Kasparov had maintained a summer home in the Croatian city of Makarska. In February 2014, he applied for citizenship by naturalisation in Croatia, according to media reports, claiming he was finding it increasingly difficult to live in Russia. According to an article in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Kasparov was &quot;widely perceived&quot; as having been a vocal supporter of Croatian independence during the early 1990s. Later in February 2014, his application for naturalisation was approved and he had a meeting with Croatian prime minister Zoran Milanović on 27 February. Croatian press cited his &quot;lobbying for Croatia in 1991&quot; as grounds for the expedited naturalisation. In an interview for a Croatian daily published in February 2022, Kasparov said he was &quot;very grateful&quot; to Milanović for the help rendered by him (then as prime minister) in obtaining Croatian citizenship.

== Books and other writings ==
=== Early writings ===
Kasparov has written books on chess. He published a controversial autobiography when still in his early 20s. Originally titled &quot;Child of Change&quot;, it was later published as &quot;Unlimited Challenge&quot;. This book was updated several times after he became world champion. Its content is mainly literary, with a small chess component of key unannotated games. He published an annotated games collection in 1983, &quot;Fighting Chess: My Games and Career&quot;, which has been updated in further editions. He also wrote a book annotating the games from his World Chess Championship 1985 victory, &quot;World Chess Championship Match: Moscow, 1985&quot;.

He has annotated his own games extensively for the Yugoslav &quot;Chess Informant&quot; series. In 1982, he co-authored &quot;Batsford Chess Openings&quot; with British grandmaster Keene. That book sold well and was updated in a second edition in 1989. He also co-authored two opening books with his trainer Alexander Nikitin in the 1980s for British publisher Batsfordon the Classical Variation of the Caro–Kann Defence and on the Scheveningen Variation of the Sicilian Defence. Kasparov also contributed extensively to the five-volume openings series &quot;Encyclopedia of Chess Openings&quot; from Chess Informant, for which Kasparov also wrote personal columns called &quot;Garry&#x27;s Choice&quot;.

In 2000, Kasparov co-authored &quot;Kasparov Against the World: The Story of the Greatest Online Challenge&quot; with grandmaster Daniel King. The 202-page book analyses the 1999 Kasparov versus the World game, and holds the record for the longest analysis devoted to a single chess game.

=== &quot;My Great Predecessors&quot; series ===

In 2003, the first volume of his five-volume work &quot;Garry Kasparov on My Great Predecessors&quot; was published. This volume deals with world champions Wilhelm Steinitz, Emanuel Lasker, Capablanca and Alekhine, and some of their strong contemporaries. It won the British Chess Federation&#x27;s Book of the Year award in 2003. Volume two, covering Max Euwe, Botvinnik, Smyslov and Tal, appeared later in 2003. Volume three, featuring Tigran Petrosian and Boris Spassky, was published in early 2004. In December 2004, Kasparov released volume four, which covers Samuel Reshevsky, Miguel Najdorf and Bent Larsen (none of whom was world champion), but focuses on Fischer. The fifth volume, devoted to the chess careers of world champion Karpov and challenger Korchnoi, was published in March 2006.

=== &quot;Modern Chess&quot; series ===

His &quot;Revolution in the 70s&quot; (published in March 2007) covers &quot;the openings revolution of the 1970s–1980s&quot; and was the first work in a new venture, &quot;Modern Chess Series&quot;, which recounted his matches with Karpov and selected games. &quot;Revolution in the 70s&quot; is about the development of opening theory witnessed in that decade. Systems like the novel &quot;Hedgehog&quot; opening plan of passively developing the pieces no further than the first three ranks were examined in great detail. Kasparov also analysed some of the most notable games played in that period. In a section at the end of the book, top opening theoreticians provided their opinion on progress made in opening theory in the 1980s.

=== &quot;Garry Kasparov on Garry Kasparov&quot; series ===
 From 2011 to 2014, Kasparov published a three-volume series of his games, spanning his career in three eras until he stopped playing full-time in 2005.

=== &quot;Winter Is Coming&quot; ===
In October 2015, Kasparov published a book titled &quot;Winter Is Coming: Why Vladimir Putin and the Enemies of the Free World Must Be Stopped&quot;. The title is a reference to the HBO television series &quot;Game of Thrones&quot;. In the book, Kasparov writes about the need for an organisation composed solely of democratic countries to replace the United Nations. In an interview, he called the United Nations a &quot;catwalk for dictators&quot;.

=== Historical revision ===
Kasparov believes that the conventional history of civilisation is incorrect. Specifically, he contends that the history of ancient civilisations is based on misdating of events and achievements that occurred in the medieval period. He has cited several aspects of ancient history that, he argues, are likely to be anachronisms.

Kasparov has written in support of the pseudohistorical New Chronology (Fomenko), although with some reservations. In 2001, he expressed a desire to devote his time to promoting the New Chronology after his chess career. &quot;New Chronology is a great area for investing my intellect ... My analytical abilities are well placed to figure out what was right and what was wrong.&quot; &quot;When I stop playing chess, it may well be that I concentrate on promoting these ideas... I believe they can improve our lives.&quot; Later, Kasparov renounced his support of Fomenko theories but reaffirmed his belief that mainstream historical knowledge is inconsistent.

=== Other post-retirement writing ===
Kasparov wrote &quot;How Life Imitates Chess&quot;, an examination of the parallels between decision-making in chess and in the business world, in 2007. In 2008, Kasparov published a sympathetic obituary for Fischer: &quot;I am often asked if I ever met or played Bobby Fischer. The answer is no, I never had that opportunity. But even though he saw me as a member of the evil chess establishment that he felt had robbed and cheated him, I am sorry I never had a chance to thank him personally for what he did for our sport.&quot;

Kasparov is the chief advisor for the book publisher Everyman Chess. He works closely with Mig Greengard and his comments can often be found on Greengard&#x27;s blog. Kasparov collaborated with Max Levchin and Peter Thiel on &quot;The Blueprint&quot;, a book calling for a revival of world innovation, planned for release in March 2013 but cancelled after the authors disagreed on its contents. In an editorial comment on Google&#x27;s AlphaZero chess-playing system, Kasparov argued that chess has become the model for reasoning in the same way that the fruit fly &quot;Drosophila melanogaster&quot; became a model organism for geneticists: &quot;I was pleased to see that AlphaZero had a dynamic, open style like my own,&quot; he wrote in late 2018.

Kasparov served as a consultant for the 2020 Netflix miniseries &quot;The Queen&#x27;s Gambit&quot; and gave an interview to &quot;Slate&quot; on his contributions. That same year, Kasparov collaborated with Matt Calkins, founder and CEO of Appian, on &quot;Hyperautomation&quot;, a book about low-code development and the future of business automation. Kasparov wrote the foreword where he discusses his experiences with human–machine relationships. &quot;The New York Times&quot; published an essay by Kasparov titled &quot;Garry Kasparov: What We Believe About Reality&quot; in 2021. The essay is part of a series called &quot;The Big Ideas: What Do We Believe&quot;. This work was later published in a compendium titled &quot;Question Everything: A Stone Reader.&quot;

<doc id="12815" wikidata="Q184268" url="?curid=12815" title="Flag of Greenland">
<text>The flag of Greenland (, ) was designed by Greenland native Thue Christiansen. It features two equal horizontal bands of white (top) and red (bottom) with a counter-changed red-and-white disk slightly to the hoist side of centre. The entire flag measures 18 by 12 parts; each stripe measures 6 parts; the disk is 8 parts in diameter, horizontally offset by 7 parts from the hoist to the centre of the circle, and vertically centered.

Its local name in the Greenlandic language is &#x27;, which means &quot;our flag&quot;. The term&#x27; (meaning &quot;the red&quot;) is also used for both the Greenlandic flag and the flag of Denmark (&#x27;). Today, Greenlanders display both the&#x27; and the &quot;&quot;—often side by side. The flag of Greenland is the only national flag of a Nordic country or territory without a Nordic cross, but is similar to the cultural Sámi flag, which also features a circular design and counterchanging of field and charge.

== History ==
Greenland first entertained the idea of a flag of its own in 1973 when five Greenlanders proposed a green, white and blue flag. The following year, a newspaper solicited eleven design proposals (all but one of which was a Nordic cross) and polled the people to determine the most popular.
The deciding committee came to no consensus, so more proposals were solicited. Finally, the present red-and-white design by Thue Christiansen narrowly won over a green-and-white Nordic cross by a vote of fourteen to eleven. Christiansen&#x27;s red-and-white flag was officially adopted on 21 June 1985.

To honour the tenth anniversary of the flag, the Greenland Post Office issued commemorative postage stamps and a leaflet by the flag&#x27;s creator. He described the white stripe as representing the glaciers and ice cap, which cover more than 80% of the island; the red stripe, the ocean; the red semicircle, the sun, with its bottom part sunk in the ocean; and the white semicircle, the icebergs and pack ice. The design is also reminiscent of the setting Sun half-submerged below the horizon and reflected on the sea. In 1985, it was reported that Greenland&#x27;s flag had exactly the same motif as the flag of the Danish rowing club HEI Rosport, which was founded before Greenland&#x27;s flag was chosen. It is not clear whether this is a case of plagiarism or just a coincidence, but the rowing club gave Greenland permission to use their flag.

The colours of the flag are the same as those of the flag of Denmark, symbolizing Greenland&#x27;s place in the Danish realm.

<doc id="12816" wikidata="Q61922" url="?curid=12816" title="Gustav Radbruch">
<text>Gustav Radbruch (21 November 1878 – 23 November 1949) was a German legal scholar and politician. He served as Minister of Justice of Germany during the early Weimar period. Radbruch is also regarded as one of the most influential legal philosophers of the 20th century.

==Life==
Born in Lübeck, Radbruch studied law in Munich, Leipzig and Berlin. He passed his first bar exam (&quot;Staatsexamen&quot;) in Berlin in 1901, and the following year he received his doctorate with a dissertation on &quot;The Theory of Adequate Causation&quot;. This was followed in 1903 by his qualification to teach criminal law in Heidelberg. In 1904, he was appointed Professor of criminal and trial law and legal philosophy in Heidelberg. In 1914 he accepted a call to a professorship in Königsberg, and later that year assumed a professorship at Kiel.
Radbruch was a member of the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD), and held a seat in the Reichstag from 1920 to 1924. In 1921–22 and throughout 1923, he was minister of justice in the cabinets of Joseph Wirth and Gustav Stresemann. During his time in office, a number of important laws were implemented, such as those giving women access to the justice system, and, after the assassination of Foreign Minister Walther Rathenau, the Law for the Protection of the Republic, which increased the punishments for politically motivated acts of violence and banned organizations that opposed the &quot;constitutional republican form of government&quot; along with their printed matter and meetings.

In 1926, Radbruch accepted a renewed call to lecture at Heidelberg where he delivered his inaugural lecture entitled &quot;&quot;Der Mensch im Recht&quot; (Law&#x27;s Image of the Human)&quot; as the newly appointed Professor of Criminal Law on 13 November 1926. After the Nazi seizure of power in January 1933, Radbruch, as a former Social Democratic politician, was dismissed from his university post under the terms of the so-called &quot;Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service&quot; (&quot;Gesetz zur Wiederherstellung des Berufsbeamtentums&quot;), as universities, similar to public bodies, were subject to civil service laws and regulations. Despite the employment ban in Nazi Germany, during 1935/36 he was able to spend a year in England, at University College, Oxford. An important practical outcome of this was his book, &quot;Der Geist des englischen Rechts&quot; (The Spirit of English Law), although this could be published only in 1945. During the Nazi period, he devoted himself primarily to cultural-historical work.

Immediately after the end of the Second World War in 1945, he resumed his teaching activities, but died at Heidelberg in 1949 without being able to complete his planned updated edition of his textbook on legal philosophy.

In September 1945, Radbruch published a short paper &quot;&quot;Fünf Minuten Rechtsphilosophie&quot; (Five Minutes of Legal Philosophy)&quot;, which was influential in shaping the jurisprudence of values (&quot;Wertungsjurisprudenz&quot;), prevalent in the aftermath of World War II as a reaction against legal positivism.

==Work==

Radbruch&#x27;s legal philosophy derived from neo-Kantianism, which assumes that a categorical cleavage exists between &quot;is&quot; (&quot;sein&quot;) and &quot;ought&quot; (&quot;sollen&quot;). According to this view, &quot;should&quot; can never be derived from &quot;Being.&quot; Indicative of the Heidelberg school of neokantianism to which Radbruch subscribed was that it interpolated the value-related cultural studies between the explanatory sciences (being) and philosophical teachings of values (should).
In relation to the law, this triadism shows itself in the subfields of legal sociology, legal philosophy and legal dogma. Legal dogma assumes a place in between. It posits itself in opposition to positive law, as the latter depicts itself in social reality and methodologically in the objective &quot;should-have&quot; sense of law, which reveals itself through value-related interpretation.

The core of Radbruch&#x27;s legal philosophy consists of his tenets the concept of law and the idea of law. The idea of law is defined through a triad of justice, utility and certainty. Radbruch thereby had the idea of utility or usefulness spring forth from an analysis of the idea of justice. Upon this notion was based the Radbruch formula, which is still vigorously debated today. The concept of law, for Radbruch, is &quot;nothing other than the given fact, which has the sense to serve the idea of law.&quot;

Hotly disputed is the question whether Radbruch was a legal positivist before 1933 and executed an about-face in his thinking due to the advent of Nazism, or whether he continued to develop, under the impression of Nazi crimes, the relativistic values-teaching he had already been advocating before 1933.

The problem of the controversy between the spirit and the letter of the law, in Germany, has been brought back to public attention due to the trials of former East German soldiers who guarded the Berlin Wall—the so-called necessity of following orders. Radbruch&#x27;s theories are posited against the positivist &quot;pure legal tenets&quot; represented by Hans Kelsen and, to some extent, also from Georg Jellinek.

In sum, Radbruch&#x27;s formula argues that where statutory law is incompatible with the requirements of justice &quot;to an intolerable degree&quot;, or where statutory law was obviously designed in a way that deliberately negates &quot;the equality that is the core of all justice&quot;, statutory law must be disregarded by a judge in favour of the justice principle. Since its first publication in 1946 the principle has been accepted by Germany&#x27;s Federal Constitutional Court in a variety of cases. Many people partially blame the older German legal tradition of legal positivism for the ease with which Hitler obtained power in an outwardly &quot;legal&quot; manner, rather than by means of a coup. Arguably, the shift to a concept of natural law ought to act as a safeguard against dictatorship, an untrammeled State power and the abrogation of civil rights.

<text>A gate or gateway is a point of entry to or from a space enclosed by walls. The word derived from old Norse &quot;gat&quot; meaning road or ; But other terms include yett and port. The concept originally referred to the gap or hole in the wall or fence, rather than a barrier which closed it. Gates may prevent or control the entry or exit of individuals, or they may be merely decorative. The moving part or parts of a gateway may be considered &quot;doors&quot;, as they are fixed at one side whilst opening and closing like one.

A gate may have a latch that can be raised and lowered to both open a gate or prevent it from swinging. Gate operation can be either automated or manual. Locks are also used on gates to increase security. 

Larger gates can be used for a whole building, such as a castle or fortified town. Doors can also be considered gates when they are used to block entry as prevalent within a gatehouse.

<doc id="12822" wikidata="Q179537" url="?curid=12822" title="Greek fire">
<text>Greek fire was an incendiary weapon system used by the Byzantine Empire from the seventh to the fourteenth centuries. The recipe for Greek fire was a closely-guarded state secret; historians have variously speculated that it was based on saltpeter, sulfur, or quicklime, but most modern scholars agree that it was based on petroleum mixed with resins, comparable in composition to modern napalm. Byzantine sailors would toss grenades loaded with Greek fire onto enemy ships or spray it from tubes. Its ability to burn on water made it an effective and destructive naval incendiary weapon, and rival powers tried unsuccessfully to copy the material.

==Name==
Usage of the term &quot;Greek fire&quot; has been general in English and most other languages since the Crusades. Original Byzantine sources called the substance a variety of names, such as &quot;sea fire&quot; (Medieval Greek: ), &quot;Roman fire&quot; ( ), &quot;war fire&quot; ( ), &quot;liquid fire&quot; ( ), &quot;sticky fire&quot; ( ), or &quot;manufactured fire&quot; ( ).

==History==

Incendiary and flaming weapons were used in warfare for centuries before Greek fire was invented. They included sulfur-, petroleum-, and bitumen-based mixtures. Incendiary arrows and pots or small pouches containing combustible substances surrounded by caltrops or spikes, or launched by catapults, were used in the Greco-Roman world. Thucydides mentions that in the siege of Delium in 424 BC a long tube on wheels was used which blew flames forward using a large bellows. The Graeco-Roman treatise , compiled in the late 2nd or early 3rd century AD and traditionally ascribed to Julius Africanus, records a mixture that ignited from adequate heat and intense sunlight, used in grenades or night attacks:

In naval warfare, the Byzantine emperor Anastasius I () is recorded by chronicler John Malalas to have been advised by a philosopher from Athens called Proclus to use sulfur to burn the ships of the rebel general Vitalian.

Greek fire proper was developed in and is ascribed by the chronicler Theophanes the Confessor to Kallinikos (Latinized Callinicus), a Jewish architect from Heliopolis, in Syria, by then overrun by the Muslim conquests:

The accuracy and exact chronology of this account is open to question: elsewhere, Theophanes reports the use of fire-carrying ships equipped with nozzles () by the Byzantines a couple of years before the supposed arrival of Kallinikos at Constantinople. If this is not due to chronological confusion of the events of the siege, it may suggest that Kallinikos introduced an improved version of an established weapon. The historian James Partington thinks it likely that Greek fire was not the creation of any single person but &quot;invented by chemists in Constantinople who had inherited the discoveries of the Alexandrian chemical school&quot;. The 11th-century chronicler George Kedrenos records that Kallinikos came from Heliopolis in Egypt, but most scholars reject this as an error. Kedrenos also records the story, considered implausible by modern scholars, that Kallinikos&#x27; descendants, a family called , &quot;brilliant&quot;, kept the secret of the fire&#x27;s manufacture and continued doing so to Kedrenos&#x27; time.

Kallinikos&#x27; development of Greek fire came at a critical moment in the Byzantine Empire&#x27;s history: weakened by its long wars with Sassanid Persia, the Byzantines had been unable to effectively resist the onslaught of the Muslim conquests. Within a generation, Syria, Palestine, and Egypt had fallen to the Arabs, who in set out to conquer the imperial capital of Constantinople. Greek fire was used to great effect against the Muslim fleets, helping to repel the Muslims at the first and second Arab sieges of the city. Records of its use in later naval battles against the Saracens are more sporadic, but it secured victories during the Byzantine expansion in the late 9th and early 10th centuries. Use of the substance was prominent in Byzantine civil wars, chiefly the revolt of the thematic fleets in 727 and the large-scale rebellion led by Thomas the Slav in 821–823. In both cases, the rebel fleets were defeated by the Constantinople-based central Imperial fleet through the use of Greek fire. The Byzantines also used the weapon to devastating effect against the various Rus&#x27; raids on the Bosporus, especially those of 941 and 1043, as well as during the Bulgarian war of 970–971, when the fire-carrying Byzantine ships blockaded the Danube.

The importance placed on Greek fire during the Empire&#x27;s struggle against the Arabs led to its discovery being ascribed to divine intervention. The Emperor Constantine Porphyrogennetos (), in his book , admonishes his son and heir, Romanos II (), never to reveal the secrets of its composition, as it was &quot;shown and revealed by an angel to the great and holy first Christian emperor Constantine&quot; and that the angel bound him &quot;not to prepare this fire but for Christians, and only in the imperial city&quot;. As a warning, he adds that one official, who was bribed into handing some of it over to the Empire&#x27;s enemies, was struck down by a &quot;flame from heaven&quot; as he was about to enter a church. As the latter incident demonstrates, the Byzantines could not avoid capture of their secret weapon: the Arabs captured at least one fireship intact in 827, and the Bulgars captured several s and much of the substance itself in 812/814. This was apparently not enough to allow their enemies to copy it (see below). The Arabs used various incendiary substances similar to the Byzantine weapon, but were never able to copy the Byzantine method of deployment by , and used catapults and grenades instead.

Greek fire continued to be mentioned during the 12th century, and Anna Komnene gives a vivid description of its use in a naval battle against the Pisans in 1099. The use of hastily improvised fireships is mentioned during the 1203 siege of Constantinople by the Fourth Crusade, but no report confirms the use of Greek fire. This might be because of the general disarmament of the Empire in the 20 years leading up to the sacking, or because the Byzantines had lost access to the areas where the primary ingredients were to be found, or even perhaps because the secret had been lost over time.

Records of a 13th-century use of &quot;Greek fire&quot; by the Saracens against the Crusaders can be read through the Memoirs of the Lord of Joinville during the Seventh Crusade. One description of the memoir says &quot;the tail of fire that trailed behind it was as big as a great spear; and it made such a noise as it came, that it sounded like the thunder of heaven. It looked like a dragon flying through the air. Such a bright light did it cast, that one could see all over the camp as though it were day, by reason of the great mass of fire, and the brilliance of the light that it shed.&quot;

In the 19th century, it is reported that an Armenian called Kavafian approached the government of the Ottoman Empire with a new type of Greek fire he claimed to have developed. Kavafian refused to reveal its composition when asked by the government, insisting that he be placed in command of its use during naval engagements. Not long after this, he was poisoned by imperial authorities, without their ever having found out his secret.

==Manufacture==

===General characteristics===

As Constantine Porphyrogennetos&#x27; warnings show, the ingredients and the processes of manufacture and deployment of Greek fire were carefully guarded military secrets. So strict was the secrecy that the composition of Greek fire was lost forever and remains a source of speculation. The mystery of the formula has long dominated the research into Greek fire. Despite this almost exclusive focus, Greek fire is best understood as a complete weapon system of many components, all of which were needed to operate together to render it effective. This comprised not only the formula of its composition, but also the specialized dromon ships that carried it into battle, the device used to prepare the substance by heating and pressurizing it, the 
 projecting it, and the special training of the who used it. Knowledge of the whole system was highly compartmentalised, with operators and technicians aware of the secrets of only one component, ensuring that no enemy could gain knowledge of it in its entirety. This accounts for the fact that when the Bulgarians took Mesembria and Debeltos in 814, they captured 36 s and even quantities of the substance itself, but were unable to make any use of them.

The information available on Greek fire is indirect, based on references in the Byzantine military manuals and secondary historical sources such as Anna Komnene and Western European chroniclers, which are often inaccurate. In her &quot;Alexiad&quot;, Anna Komnene provides a description of an incendiary weapon, which was used by the Byzantine garrison of Dyrrhachium in 1108 against the Normans. It is often regarded as an at least partial &quot;recipe&quot; for Greek fire:

At the same time, the reports by Western chroniclers of the famed are largely unreliable, since they apply the name to all incendiary substances.

In attempting to reconstruct the Greek fire system, the evidence from the contemporary literary references provides the following characteristics:
* It burned on water; according to some interpretations it was ignited by water. Numerous writers testify that it could be extinguished only by a few substances, such as sand, strong vinegar, or old urine, some presumably by a sort of chemical reaction.
* It was a liquid substance – not some sort of projectile – as verified both by descriptions and the name &quot;liquid fire&quot;.
* At sea it was usually ejected from a , but earthenware pots or grenades filled with it – or similar substances – were also used.
* The discharge of Greek fire was accompanied by &quot;thunder&quot; and &quot;much smoke&quot;.

===Theories on composition===
The first and, for a long time, most popular theory regarding the composition of Greek fire held that its chief ingredient was saltpeter, making it an early form of gunpowder. This argument was based on the &quot;thunder and smoke&quot; description, as well as on the distance the flame could be projected from the , which suggested an explosive discharge. From the times of Isaac Vossius, several scholars adhered to this position, most notably the so-called &quot;French school&quot; during the 19th century, which included chemist Marcellin Berthelot.

This view has subsequently been rejected, since saltpeter does not appear to have been used in warfare in Europe or the Middle East before the 13th century, and is absent from the accounts of the Muslim writers – the foremost chemists of the early medieval world – before the same period. In addition, the behavior of the suggested mixture would have been very different from the -projected substance described by Byzantine sources.

A second view, based on the fact that Greek fire was inextinguishable by water (some sources suggest that water intensified the flames), suggested that its destructive power was the result of the explosive reaction between water and quicklime. Although quicklime was known and used by the Byzantines and the Arabs in warfare, the theory is refuted by literary and empirical evidence. A quicklime-based substance would have to come in contact with water to ignite, while Emperor Leo&#x27;s indicates that Greek fire was often poured directly onto the decks of enemy ships, although admittedly, decks were kept wet due to lack of sealants. Likewise, Leo describes the use of grenades, which further reinforces the view that contact with water was not necessary for the substance&#x27;s ignition. Zenghelis (1932) pointed out that, based on experiments, the result of the water–quicklime reaction would be negligible in the open sea.

Another similar proposition suggested that Kallinikos had discovered calcium phosphide, which can be made by boiling bones in urine in a sealed vessel. On contact with water it releases phosphine, which ignites spontaneously. Extensive experiments with calcium phosphide also failed to reproduce the described intensity of Greek fire.

Consequently, although the presence of either quicklime or saltpeter in the mixture cannot be entirely excluded, they were not the primary ingredient. Most modern scholars agree that Greek fire was based on either crude or refined petroleum, comparable to modern napalm. The Byzantines had easy access to crude oil from the naturally occurring wells around the Black Sea (e.g., the wells around Tmutorakan noted by Constantine Porphyrogennetos) or in various locations throughout the Middle East. An alternate name for Greek fire was &quot;Median fire&quot; (), and the 6th-century historian Procopius records that crude oil, called &quot;naphtha&quot; (in Greek: , from Old Persian ) by the Persians, was known to the Greeks as &quot;Median oil&quot; (). This seems to corroborate the availability of naphtha as a basic ingredient of Greek fire.

Naphtha was also used by the Abbasids in the 9th century, with special troops, the , who wore thick protective suits and used small copper vessels containing burning oil, which they threw onto the enemy troops. There is also a surviving 9th-century Latin text, preserved at Wolfenbüttel in Germany, which mentions the ingredients of what appears to be Greek fire and the operation of the s used to project it. Although the text contains some inaccuracies, it identifies the main component as naphtha. Resins were probably added as a thickener (the refer to the substance as , &quot;sticky fire&quot;), and to increase the duration and intensity of the flame. A modern theoretical concoction included the use of pine tar and animal fat.

A 12th-century treatise prepared by Mardi bin Ali al-Tarsusi for Saladin records an Arab version of Greek fire, called , which also had a petroleum base, with sulfur and various resins added. Any direct relation with the Byzantine formula is unlikely. An Italian recipe from the 16th century has been recorded for recreational use; it includes charcoal from a willow tree, saltpeter (), alcohol, sulfur, incense, tar (), wool, and camphor; the concoction was guaranteed to &quot;burn under water&quot; and to be &quot;beautiful&quot;.

==Methods of deployment==

The chief method of deployment of Greek fire, which sets it apart from similar substances, was its projection through a tube (&quot;siphōn&quot;), for use aboard ships or in sieges. Portable projectors (&quot;cheirosiphōnes&quot;, χειροσίφωνες) were also invented, reputedly by Emperor Leo VI. The Byzantine military manuals also mention that jars (&quot;chytrai&quot; or &quot;tzykalia&quot;) filled with Greek fire and caltrops wrapped with tow and soaked in the substance were thrown by catapults, while pivoting cranes (&quot;gerania&quot;) were employed to pour it upon enemy ships. The &quot;cheirosiphōnes&quot; especially were prescribed for use at land and in sieges, both against siege machines and against defenders on the walls, by several 10th-century military authors, and their use is depicted in the &quot;Poliorcetica&quot; of Hero of Byzantium. The Byzantine dromons usually had a &quot;siphōn&quot; installed on their prow under the forecastle, but additional devices could also be placed elsewhere on the ship. Thus in 941, when the Byzantines were facing the vastly more numerous Rus&#x27; fleet, &quot;siphōn&quot;s were placed also amidships and even astern.
===Projectors===
The use of tubular projectors (σίφων, &quot;siphōn&quot;) is amply attested in the contemporary sources. Anna Komnene gives this account of beast-shaped Greek fire projectors being mounted to the bow of warships:
As he [the Emperor Alexios I] knew that the Pisans were skilled in sea warfare and dreaded a battle with them, on the prow of each ship he had a head fixed of a lion or other land-animal, made in brass or iron with the mouth open and then gilded over, so that their mere aspect was terrifying. And the fire which was to be directed against the enemy through tubes he made to pass through the mouths of the beasts, so that it seemed as if the lions and the other similar monsters were vomiting the fire.

Some sources provide more information on the composition and function of the whole mechanism. The Wolfenbüttel manuscript provides the following description:
...having built a furnace right at the front of the ship, they set on it a copper vessel full of these things, having put fire underneath. And one of them, having made a bronze tube similar to that which the rustics call a &quot;squitiatoria&quot;, &quot;squirt,&quot; with which boys play, they spray [it] at the enemy.

Another, possibly first-hand, account of the use of Greek fire comes from the 11th-century &quot;Yngvars saga víðförla&quot;, in which the Viking Ingvar the Far-Travelled faces ships equipped with Greek fire weapons:
[They] began blowing with smiths’ bellows at a furnace in which there was fire and there came from it a great din. There stood there also a brass [or bronze] tube and from it flew much fire against one ship, and it burned up in a short time so that all of it became white ashes...
The account, albeit embellished, corresponds with many of the characteristics of Greek fire known from other sources, such as a loud roar that accompanied its discharge. These two texts are also the only two sources that explicitly mention that the substance was heated over a furnace before being discharged; although the validity of this information is open to question, modern reconstructions have relied upon them.
Based on these descriptions and the Byzantine sources, John Haldon and Maurice Byrne designed a hypothetical apparatus as consisting of three main components: a bronze pump, which was used to pressurize the oil; a brazier, used to heat the oil (πρόπυρον, &quot;propyron&quot;, &quot;pre-heater&quot;); and the nozzle, which was covered in bronze and mounted on a swivel (στρεπτόν, &quot;strepton&quot;). The brazier, burning a match of linen or flax that produced intense heat and the characteristic thick smoke, was used to heat oil and the other ingredients in an airtight tank above it, a process that also helped to dissolve the resins into a fluid mixture. The substance was pressurized by the heat and the use of a force pump. After it had reached the proper pressure, a valve connecting the tank with the swivel was opened and the mixture was discharged from its end, being ignited at its mouth by a flame. The intense heat of the flame made necessary the presence of heat shields made of iron (βουκόλια, &quot;boukolia&quot;), which are attested in the fleet inventories.

The process of operating Haldon and Byrne&#x27;s design was fraught with danger, as the mounting pressure could easily make the heated oil tank explode, a flaw which was not recorded as a problem with the historical fire weapon. In the experiments conducted by Haldon in 2002 for the episode &quot;Fireship&quot; of the television series &quot;Machines Times Forgot&quot;, even modern welding techniques failed to secure adequate insulation of the bronze tank under pressure. This led to the relocation of the pressure pump between the tank and the nozzle. The full-scale device built on this basis established the effectiveness of the mechanism&#x27;s design, even with the simple materials and techniques available to the Byzantines. The experiment used crude oil mixed with wood resins, and achieved a flame temperature of over and an effective range of up to .

===Hand-held projectors===

The portable &quot;cheirosiphōn&quot; (&quot;hand-&quot;siphōn&quot;&quot;), the earliest analogue to a modern flamethrower, is extensively attested in the military documents of the 10th century, and recommended for use in both sea and land. They first appear in the &quot;Tactica&quot; of emperor Leo VI the Wise, who claims to have invented them. Subsequent authors continued to refer to the &quot;cheirosiphōnes&quot;, especially for use against siege towers; Nikephoros II Phokas also advises their use in field armies, with the aim of disrupting the enemy formation. Although both Leo VI and Nikephoros Phokas claim that the substance used in the &quot;cheirosiphōnes&quot; was the same as in the static devices used on ships, Haldon and Byrne consider that the former were manifestly different from their larger cousins, and theorize that the device was fundamentally different, &quot;a simple syringe [that] squirted both liquid fire (presumably unignited) and noxious juices to repel enemy troops.&quot; The illustrations of Hero&#x27;s &quot;Poliorcetica&quot; show the &quot;cheirosiphōn&quot; also throwing the ignited substance.

===Grenades===

In its earliest form, Greek fire was hurled onto enemy forces by firing a burning cloth-wrapped ball, perhaps containing a flask, using a form of light catapult, most probably a seaborne variant of the Roman light catapult or onager. These were capable of hurling loads of around a distance of .

==Effectiveness and countermeasures==
Although the destructiveness of Greek fire is indisputable, it did not make the Byzantine navy invincible. It was not, in the words of naval historian John Pryor, a &quot;ship-killer&quot; comparable to the naval ram, which, by then, had fallen out of use. While Greek fire remained a potent weapon, its limitations were significant when compared to more traditional forms of artillery: in its &quot;siphōn&quot;-deployed version, it had a limited range, and it could be used safely only in a calm sea and with favorable wind conditions.

The Muslim navies eventually adapted themselves to it by staying out of its effective range and devising methods of protection such as felt or hides soaked in vinegar.

Nevertheless, it was still a decisive weapon in many battles. John Julius Norwich wrote: &quot;It is impossible to exaggerate the importance of Greek fire in Byzantine history.&quot;

==In literature==
*In William Golding&#x27;s 1958 play &quot;The Brass Butterfly&quot;, adapted from his novella &quot;Envoy Extraordinary&quot;, the Greek inventor Phanocles demonstrates explosives to the Roman Emperor. The Emperor decides that his empire is not ready for this or for Phanocles&#x27;s other inventions and sends him on &quot;a slow boat to China&quot;.
*In Victor Canning&#x27;s stage play &quot;Honour Bright&quot;  (1960), the crusader Godfrey of Ware returns with a casket of Greek Fire given to him by an old man in Athens.
*In Rick Riordan&#x27;s Greek storyline, Greek Fire is described as being a volatile green liquid. When it explodes, all of the substance is spread out over an area and burns continuously. It is very strong and dangerous.
*In C. J. Sansom&#x27;s historical mystery novel &quot;Dark Fire&quot;, Thomas Cromwell sends the lawyer Matthew Shardlake to recover the secret of Greek fire, following its discovery in the library of a dissolved London monastery.
*In Michael Crichton&#x27;s sci-fi novel &quot;Timeline&quot;, Professor Edward Johnston is stuck in the past in 14th-century Europe, and claims to have knowledge of Greek fire.
*In Mika Waltari&#x27;s novel &quot;The Dark Angel&quot;, some old men who are the last ones who know the secret of Greek fire are mentioned as present in the last Christian services held in Hagia Sophia before the Fall of Constantinople. The narrator is told that in the event of the city&#x27;s fall, they will be killed so as to keep the secret from the Turks.
*In George R. R. Martin&#x27;s fantasy series of novels &quot;A Song of Ice and Fire&quot;, and its television adaptation &quot;Game of Thrones&quot;, wildfire is similar to Greek fire. It was used in naval battles as it could remain lit on water, and its recipe was closely guarded.

==In popular culture==
*Greek fire was used by Blackbeard&#x27;s ship, the &quot;Queen Anne&#x27;s Revenge&quot;, in the 2011 film &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides&quot;.
*An application of Greek fire is shown in the 2011 Ubisoft video game Assassin&#x27;s Creed: Revelations when the main character, Ezio Auditore, escapes from the port of Istanbul using a hand projector located on an Ottoman ship.

<doc id="12823" wikidata="Q1569381" url="?curid=12823" title="Garbage in, garbage out">
<text>In computer science, garbage in, garbage out (GIGO) is the concept that flawed, biased or poor quality (&quot;garbage&quot;) information or input produces a result or output of similar (&quot;garbage&quot;) quality. The adage points to the need to improve data quality in, for example, programming. Rubbish in, rubbish out (RIRO) is an alternate wording.

The principle applies to all logical argumentation: soundness implies validity, but validity does not imply soundness.

==History==
The expression was popular in the early days of computing. The first known use is in a 1957 syndicated newspaper article about US Army mathematicians and their work with early computers, in which an Army Specialist named William D. Mellin explained that computers cannot think for themselves, and that &quot;sloppily programmed&quot; inputs inevitably lead to incorrect outputs. The underlying principle was noted by the inventor of the first programmable computing device design:

More recently, the Marine Accident Investigation Branch comes to a similar conclusion:

The term may have been derived from last-in, first-out (LIFO) or first-in, first-out (FIFO).

==Uses==
This phrase can be used as an explanation for the poor quality of a digitized audio or video file. Although digitizing can be the first step in cleaning up a signal, it does not, by itself, improve the quality. Defects in the original analog signal will be faithfully recorded, but might be identified and removed by a subsequent step by digital signal processing.

GIGO is also used to describe failures in human decision-making due to faulty, incomplete, or imprecise data.

In audiology, GIGO describes the process that occurs at the dorsal cochlear nucleus (DCN) when auditory neuropathy spectrum disorder is present. This occurs when the neural firing from the cochlea has become unsynchronized, resulting in a static-filled sound being input into the DCN and then passed up the chain to the auditory cortex. The term was applied by Dan Schwartz at the 2012 Worldwide ANSD Conference, St. Petersburg, Florida, on 16 March 2012; and adopted as industry jargon to describe the electrical signal received by the dorsal cochlear nucleus and passed up the auditory chain to the superior olivary complex on the way to the auditory cortex destination.

GIGO was the name of a Usenet gateway program to FidoNet, MAUSnet, e.a.

<text>The General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) is a legal agreement between many countries, whose overall purpose was to promote international trade by reducing or eliminating trade barriers such as tariffs or quotas. According to its preamble, its purpose was the &quot;substantial reduction of tariffs and other trade barriers and the elimination of preferences, on a reciprocal and mutually advantageous basis.&quot;

The GATT was first discussed during the United Nations Conference on Trade and Employment and was the outcome of the failure of negotiating governments to create the International Trade Organization (ITO). It was signed by 23 nations in Geneva on 30 October 1947, and was applied on a provisional basis 1 January 1948. It remained in effect until 1 January 1995, when the World Trade Organization (WTO) was established after agreement by 123 nations in Marrakesh on 15 April 1994, as part of the Uruguay Round Agreements. The WTO is the successor to the GATT, and the original GATT text (GATT 1947) is still in effect under the WTO framework, subject to the modifications of GATT 1994. Nations that were not party in 1995 to the GATT need to meet the minimum conditions spelled out in specific documents before they can accede; in September 2019, the list contained 36 nations.

The GATT, and its successor the WTO, have succeeded in reducing tariffs. The average tariff levels for the major GATT participants were about 22% in 1947, but were 5% after the Uruguay Round in 1999. Experts attribute part of these tariff changes to GATT and the WTO.

==History==
The General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade is a multi-national trade treaty. It has been updated in a series of global trade negotiations consisting of nine &quot;rounds&quot; between 1947 and 1995. Its role in international trade was largely succeeded in 1995 by the World Trade Organization.

During the 1940s, the United States sought to establish a set of post-war multilateral institutions, one of which would be devoted to the reconstruction of world trade. In 1945 and 1946, the U.S. took concrete steps to bring about such an organisation, proposing a conference to negotiate a charter for a trade organisation. The GATT was first conceived at the 1947 United Nations Conference on Trade and Employment (UNCTE), at which the International Trade Organization (ITO) was one of the ideas proposed. It was hoped that the ITO would be run alongside the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF). More than 50 nations negotiated ITO and organising its founding charter, but after the withdrawal of the United States these negotiations collapsed.

===Initial round===
Preparatory sessions were held simultaneously at the UNCTE regarding the GATT. After several of these sessions, 23 nations signed the GATT on 30 October 1947 in Geneva, Switzerland. It came into force on 1 January 1948.

===Annecy Round: 1949===

The second round took place in 1949 in Annecy, France. 13 countries took part in the round. The main focus of the talks was more tariff reductions, around 5,000 in total.

===Torquay Round: 1951===

The third round occurred in Torquay, England in 1951. Thirty-eight countries took part in the round. 8,700 tariff concessions were made totalling the remaining amount of tariffs to ¾ of the tariffs which were in effect in 1948. The contemporaneous rejection by the U.S. of the Havana Charter signified the establishment of the GATT as a governing world body.

===Geneva Round: 1955–56===

The fourth round returned to Geneva in 1955 and lasted until May 1956. Twenty-six countries took part in the round. $2.5 billion in tariffs were eliminated or reduced.

===Dillon Round: 1960–62===

The fifth round occurred once more in Geneva and lasted from 1960 to 1962. The talks were named after U.S. Treasury Secretary and former Under Secretary of State, Douglas Dillon, who first proposed the talks. Twenty-six countries took part in the round. Along with reducing over $4.9 billion in tariffs, it also yielded discussion relating to the creation of the European Economic Community (EEC).

===Kennedy Round: 1964–67===
The sixth round of GATT multilateral trade negotiations, held from 1964 to 1967. It was named after U.S. President John F. Kennedy in recognition of his support for the reformulation of the United States trade agenda, which resulted in the Trade Expansion Act of 1962. This Act gave the President the widest-ever negotiating authority.

As the Dillon Round went through the laborious process of item-by-item tariff negotiations, it became clear, long before the Round ended, that a more comprehensive approach was needed to deal with the emerging challenges resulting from the formation of the European Economic Community (EEC) and EFTA, as well as Europe&#x27;s re-emergence as a significant international trader more generally.

Japan&#x27;s high economic growth rate portended the major role it would play later as an exporter, but the focal point of the Kennedy Round always was the United States–EEC relationship. Indeed, there was an influential American view that saw what became the Kennedy Round as the start of a transatlantic partnership that might ultimately lead to a transatlantic economic community.

To an extent, this view was shared in Europe, but the process of European unification created its own stresses under which the Kennedy Round at times became a secondary focus for the EEC. An example of this was the French veto in January 1963, before the round had even started, on membership by the United Kingdom.

Another was the internal crisis of 1965, which ended in the Luxembourg Compromise. Preparations for the new round were immediately overshadowed by the Chicken War, an early sign of the impact variable levies under the Common Agricultural Policy would eventually have. Some participants in the Round had been concerned that the convening of UNCTAD, scheduled for 1964, would result in further complications, but its impact on the actual negotiations was minimal.

In May 1963 Ministers reached agreement on three negotiating objectives for the round:

# Measures for the expansion of trade of developing countries as a means of furthering their economic development,
# Reduction or elimination of tariffs and other barriers to trade, and
# Measures for access to markets for agricultural and other primary products.

The working hypothesis for the tariff negotiations was a linear tariff cut of 50% with the smallest number of exceptions. A drawn-out argument developed about the trade effects a uniform linear cut would have on the dispersed rates (low and high tariffs quite far apart) of the United States as compared to the much more concentrated rates of the EEC which also tended to be in the lower held of United States tariff rates.

The EEC accordingly argued for an evening-out or harmonisation of peaks and troughs through its cerement, double cart and thirty: ten proposals. Once negotiations had been joined, the lofty working hypothesis was soon undermined. The special-structure countries (Australia, Canada, New Zealand and South Africa), so called because their exports were dominated by raw materials and other primary commodities, negotiated their tariff reductions entirely through the item-by-item method.

In the end, the result was an average 35% reduction in tariffs, except for textiles, chemicals, steel and other sensitive products; plus a 15% to 18% reduction in tariffs for agricultural and food products. In addition, the negotiations on chemicals led to a provisional agreement on the abolition of the American Selling Price (ASP). This was a method of valuing some chemicals used by the noted States for the imposition of import duties which gave domestic manufacturers a much higher level of protection than the tariff schedule indicated.

However, this part of the outcome was disallowed by Congress, and the American Selling Price was not abolished until Congress adopted the results of the Tokyo Round. The results on agriculture overall were poor. The most notable achievement was agreement on a Memorandum of Agreement on Basic Elements for the Negotiation of a World Grants Arrangement, which eventually was rolled into a new International Grains Arrangement.

The EEC claimed that for it the main result of the negotiations on agriculture was that they &quot;greatly helped to define its own common policy&quot;. The developing countries, who played a minor role throughout the negotiations in this round, benefited nonetheless from substantial tariff cuts particularly in non-agricultural items of interest to them.

Their main achievement at the time, however, was seen to be the adoption of Part IV of the GATT, which absolved them from according reciprocity to developed countries in trade negotiations. In the view of many developing countries, this was a direct result of the call at UNCTAD I for a better trade deal for them.

There has been argument ever since whether this symbolic gesture was a victory for them, or whether it ensured their exclusion in the future from meaningful participation in the multilateral trading system. On the other hand, there was no doubt that the extension of the Long-Term Arrangement Regarding International Trade in Cotton Textiles, which later became the Multi-Fiber Arrangement, for three years until 1970 led to the longer-term impairment of export opportunities for developing countries.

Another outcome of the Kennedy Round was the adoption of an Anti-dumping Code, which gave more precise guidance on the implementation of Article VI of the GATT. In particular, it sought to ensure speedy and fair investigations, and it imposed limits on the retrospective application of anti-dumping measures.

Kennedy Round took place from 1962 to 1967. $40 billion in tariffs were eliminated or reduced.

===Tokyo Round: 1973–79===

Reduced tariffs and established new regulations aimed at controlling the proliferation of non-tariff barriers and voluntary export restrictions. 102 countries took part in the round. Concessions were made on $19 billion worth of trade.

===Formation of Quadrilateral Group: 1981===
The Quadrilateral Group was formed in 1982 by the European Union, the United States, Japan and Canada, to influence the GATT.

===Uruguay Round: 1986–94===

The Uruguay Round began in 1986. It was the most ambitious round to date, as of 1986, hoping to expand the competence of the GATT to important new areas such as services, capital, intellectual property, textiles, and agriculture. 123 countries took part in the round. The Uruguay Round was also the first set of multilateral trade negotiations in which developing countries had played an active role.

Agriculture was essentially exempted from previous agreements as it was given special status in the areas of import quotas and export subsidies, with only mild caveats. However, by the time of the Uruguay round, many countries considered the exception of agriculture to be sufficiently glaring that they refused to sign a new deal without some movement on agricultural products. These fourteen countries came to be known as the &quot;Cairns Group&quot;, and included mostly small and medium-sized agricultural exporters such as Australia, Brazil, Canada, Indonesia, and New Zealand.

The Agreement on Agriculture of the Uruguay Round continues to be the most substantial trade liberalisation agreement in agricultural products in the history of trade negotiations. The goals of the agreement were to improve market access for agricultural products, reduce domestic support of agriculture in the form of price-distorting subsidies and quotas, eliminate over time export subsidies on agricultural products and to harmonise to the extent possible sanitary and phytosanitary measures between member countries.

==World Trade Organization==

In 1993, the GATT was updated (&#x27;GATT 1994&#x27;) to include new obligations upon its signatories. One of the most significant changes was the creation of the World Trade Organization (WTO). The 76 existing GATT members and the European Communities became the founding members of the WTO on 1 January 1995. The other 51 GATT members rejoined the WTO in the following two years (the last being Congo in 1997). Since the founding of the WTO, 33 new non-GATT members have joined and 22 are currently negotiating membership. There are a total of 164 member countries in the WTO, with Liberia and Afghanistan being the newest members as of 2018.

Of the original GATT members, Syria, Lebanon and the SFR Yugoslavia have not rejoined the WTO. Since FR Yugoslavia (renamed as Serbia and Montenegro and with membership negotiations later split in two), is not recognised as a direct SFRY successor state; therefore, its application is considered a new (non-GATT) one. The General Council of WTO, on 4 May 2010, agreed to establish a working party to examine the request of Syria for WTO membership. The contracting parties who founded the WTO ended official agreement of the &quot;GATT 1947&quot; terms on 31 December 1995. Montenegro became a member in 2012, while Serbia is in the decision stage of the negotiations and is expected to become a member of the WTO in the future.

Whilst GATT was a set of rules agreed upon by nations, the WTO is an intergovernmental organisation with its own headquarters and staff, and its scope includes both traded goods and trade within the service sector and intellectual property rights. Although it was designed to serve multilateral agreements, during several rounds of GATT negotiations (particularly the Tokyo Round) plurilateral agreements created selective trading and caused fragmentation among members. WTO arrangements are generally a multilateral agreement settlement mechanism of GATT.

== Effects on trade liberalisation ==
The average tariff levels for the major GATT participants were about 22 per cent in 1947. As a result of the first negotiating rounds, tariffs were reduced in the GATT core of the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia, relative to other contracting parties and non-GATT participants. By the Kennedy round (1962–67), the average tariff levels of GATT participants were about 15%. After the Uruguay Round, tariffs were under 5%.

In addition to facilitating applied tariff reductions, the early GATT&#x27;s contribution to trade liberalisation &quot;include binding the negotiated tariff reductions for an extended period (made more permanent in 1955), establishing the generality of non-discrimination through most favoured nation (MFN) treatment and national treatment status, ensuring increased transparency of trade policy measures, and providing a forum for future negotiations and for the peaceful resolution of bilateral disputes. All of these elements contributed to the rationalization of trade policy and the reduction of trade barriers and policy uncertainty.&quot;

According to Dartmouth economic historian Douglas Irwin,

The prosperity of the world economy over the past half century owes a great deal to the growth of world trade which, in turn, is partly the result of farsighted officials who created the GATT. They established a set of procedures giving stability to the trade-policy environment and thereby facilitating the rapid growth of world trade. With the long run in view, the original GATT conferees helped put the world economy on a sound foundation and thereby improved the livelihood of hundreds of millions of people around the world.

== Article 24 ==

Following the United Kingdom&#x27;s vote to withdraw from the European Union, supporters of leaving the EU suggested that Article 24, paragraph 5B of the treaty could be used to maintain a &quot;standstill&quot; in trading conditions between the UK and the EU in the event of the UK leaving the EU without a trade deal, hence preventing the introduction of tariffs. According to proponents of this approach, it could be used to implement an interim agreement pending negotiation of a final agreement lasting up to ten years.

This claim formed the basis of the so-called &quot;Malthouse compromise&quot; between Conservative party factions as to how to replace the withdrawal agreement. However, this plan was rejected by parliament. The claim that Article 24 might be used was also adopted by Boris Johnson during his 2019 campaign to lead the Conservative Party.

The claim that Article 24 might be used in this way has been criticised by Mark Carney, Liam Fox and others as being unrealistic given the requirement in paragraph 5c of the treaty that there be an agreement between the parties for paragraph 5b to be of use as, in the event of a &quot;no-deal&quot; scenario, there would be no agreement. Moreover, critics of the GATT 24 approach point out that services would not be covered by such an arrangement.

==Special and differential treatment==
Special and differential treatment (S&amp;D) is a set of GATT provisions (GATT 1947, Article XVIII) that exempts developing countries from the same strict trade rules and disciplines of more industrialized countries. That is, developed countries will treat developing countries differently. In the Uruguay Round Agreement on Agriculture, for example, developing countries are given longer time periods to phase in export subsidy and tariff reductions than the more industrialized countries. The least developed countries are exempt from any reduction commitments.

<text>G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), also known as seven-(pass)-transmembrane domain receptors, 7TM receptors, heptahelical receptors, serpentine receptors, and G protein-linked receptors (GPLR), form a large group of evolutionarily related proteins that are cell surface receptors that detect molecules outside the cell and activate cellular responses. They are coupled with G proteins. They pass through the cell membrane seven times in the form of six loops (three extracellular loops interacting with ligand molecules, three intracellular loops interacting with G proteins, an N-terminal extracellular region and a C-terminal intracellular region) of amino acid residues, which is why they are sometimes referred to as seven-transmembrane receptors. Ligands can bind either to the extracellular N-terminus and loops (e.g. glutamate receptors) or to the binding site within transmembrane helices (rhodopsin-like family). They are all activated by agonists, although a spontaneous auto-activation of an empty receptor has also been observed. 

G protein-coupled receptors are found only in eukaryotes, including yeast, and choanoflagellates. The ligands that bind and activate these receptors include light-sensitive compounds, odors, pheromones, hormones, and neurotransmitters. They vary in size from small molecules to peptides, to large proteins. G protein-coupled receptors are involved in many diseases.

There are two principal signal transduction pathways involving the G protein-coupled receptors:
*the cAMP signal pathway and
*the phosphatidylinositol signal pathway.
When a ligand binds to the GPCR it causes a conformational change in the GPCR, which allows it to act as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF). The GPCR can then activate an associated G protein by exchanging the GDP bound to the G protein for a GTP. The G protein&#x27;s α subunit, together with the bound GTP, can then dissociate from the β and γ subunits to further affect intracellular signaling proteins or target functional proteins directly depending on the α subunit type (Gαs, Gαi/o, Gαq/11, Gα12/13).

GPCRs are an important drug target and approximately 34% of all Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved drugs target 108 members of this family. The global sales volume for these drugs is estimated to be 180 billion US dollars . It is estimated that GPCRs are targets for about 50% of drugs currently on the market, mainly due to their involvement in signaling pathways related to many diseases i.e. mental, metabolic including endocrinological disorders, immunological including viral infections, cardiovascular, inflammatory, senses disorders, and cancer. The long ago discovered association between GPCRs and many endogenous and exogenous substances, resulting in e.g. analgesia, is another dynamically developing field of the pharmaceutical research.

==History and significance==
With the determination of the first structure of the complex between a G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) and a G-protein trimer (Gαβγ) in 2011 a new chapter of GPCR research was opened for structural investigations of global switches with more than one protein being investigated. The previous breakthroughs involved determination of the crystal structure of the first GPCR, rhodopsin, in 2000 and the crystal structure of the first GPCR with a diffusible ligand (β2AR) in 2007. The way in which the seven transmembrane helices of a GPCR are arranged into a bundle was suspected based on the low-resolution model of frog rhodopsin from cryogenic electron microscopy studies of the two-dimensional crystals. The crystal structure of rhodopsin, that came up three years later, was not a surprise apart from the presence of an additional cytoplasmic helix H8 and a precise location of a loop covering retinal binding site. However, it provided a scaffold which was hoped to be a universal template for homology modeling and drug design for other GPCRs – a notion that proved to be too optimistic. 

Results 7 years later were surprising because the crystallization of β2-adrenergic receptor (β2AR) with a diffusible ligand revealed quite a different shape of the receptor extracellular side than that of rhodopsin. This area is important because it is responsible for the ligand binding and is targeted by many drugs. Moreover, the ligand binding site was much more spacious than in the rhodopsin structure and was open to the exterior. In the other receptors crystallized shortly afterwards the binding side was even more easily accessible to the ligand. New structures complemented with biochemical investigations uncovered mechanisms of action of molecular switches which modulate the structure of the receptor leading to activation states for agonists or to complete or partial inactivation states for inverse agonists.

The 2012 Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded to Brian Kobilka and Robert Lefkowitz for their work that was &quot;crucial for understanding how G protein-coupled receptors function&quot;. There have been at least seven other Nobel Prizes awarded for some aspect of G protein–mediated signaling. As of 2012, two of the top ten global best-selling drugs (Advair Diskus and Abilify) act by targeting G protein-coupled receptors.

==Classification==
The exact size of the GPCR superfamily is unknown, but at least 831 different human genes (or about 4% of the entire protein-coding genome) have been predicted to code for them from genome sequence analysis. Although numerous classification schemes have been proposed, the superfamily was classically divided into three main classes (A, B, and C) with no detectable shared sequence homology between classes.

The largest class by far is class A, which accounts for nearly 85% of the GPCR genes. Of class A GPCRs, over half of these are predicted to encode olfactory receptors, while the remaining receptors are liganded by known endogenous compounds or are classified as orphan receptors. Despite the lack of sequence homology between classes, all GPCRs have a common structure and mechanism of signal transduction. The very large rhodopsin A group has been further subdivided into 19 subgroups (A1-A19).

According to the classical A-F system, GPCRs can be grouped into six classes based on sequence homology and functional similarity:
*Class A (or 1) (Rhodopsin-like)
*Class B (or 2) (Secretin receptor family)
*Class C (or 3) (Metabotropic glutamate/pheromone)
*Class D (or 4) (Fungal mating pheromone receptors)
*Class E (or 5) (Cyclic AMP receptors)
*Class F (or 6) (Frizzled/Smoothened)

More recently, an alternative classification system called GRAFS (Glutamate, Rhodopsin, &quot;Adhesion&quot;, Frizzled/Taste2, Secretin) has been proposed for vertebrate GPCRs. They correspond to classical classes C, A, B2, F, and B.

An early study based on available DNA sequence suggested that the human genome encodes roughly 750 G protein-coupled receptors, about 350 of which detect hormones, growth factors, and other endogenous ligands. Approximately 150 of the GPCRs found in the human genome have unknown functions.

Some web-servers and bioinformatics prediction methods have been used for predicting the classification of GPCRs according to their amino acid sequence alone, by means of the pseudo amino acid composition approach.

==Physiological roles==
GPCRs are involved in a wide variety of physiological processes. Some examples of their physiological roles include:
# The visual sense: The opsins use a photoisomerization reaction to translate electromagnetic radiation into cellular signals. Rhodopsin, for example, uses the conversion of &quot;11-cis&quot;-retinal to &quot;all-trans&quot;-retinal for this purpose.
# The gustatory sense (taste): GPCRs in taste cells mediate release of gustducin in response to bitter-, umami- and sweet-tasting substances.
# The sense of smell: Receptors of the olfactory epithelium bind odorants (olfactory receptors) and pheromones (vomeronasal receptors)
# Behavioral and mood regulation: Receptors in the mammalian brain bind several different neurotransmitters, including serotonin, dopamine, histamine, GABA, and glutamate
# Regulation of immune system activity and inflammation: chemokine receptors bind ligands that mediate intercellular communication between cells of the immune system; receptors such as histamine receptors bind inflammatory mediators and engage target cell types in the inflammatory response. GPCRs are also involved in immune-modulation, e. g. regulating interleukin induction or suppressing TLR-induced immune responses from T cells.
# Autonomic nervous system transmission: Both the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems are regulated by GPCR pathways, responsible for control of many automatic functions of the body such as blood pressure, heart rate, and digestive processes
# Cell density sensing: A novel GPCR role in regulating cell density sensing.
# Homeostasis modulation (e.g., water balance).
# Involved in growth and metastasis of some types of tumors.
# Used in the endocrine system for peptide and amino-acid derivative hormones that bind to GCPRs on the cell membrane of a target cell. This activates cAMP, which in turn activates several kinases, allowing for a cellular response, such as transcription.

==Receptor structure==

GPCRs are integral membrane proteins that possess seven membrane-spanning domains or transmembrane helices. The extracellular parts of the receptor can be glycosylated. These extracellular loops also contain two highly conserved cysteine residues that form disulfide bonds to stabilize the receptor structure. Some seven-transmembrane helix proteins (channelrhodopsin) that resemble GPCRs may contain ion channels, within their protein.

In 2000, the first crystal structure of a mammalian GPCR, that of bovine rhodopsin (), was solved. In 2007, the first structure of a human GPCR was solved This human β2-adrenergic receptor GPCR structure proved highly similar to the bovine rhodopsin. The structures of activated or agonist-bound GPCRs have also been determined. These structures indicate how ligand binding at the extracellular side of a receptor leads to conformational changes in the cytoplasmic side of the receptor. The biggest change is an outward movement of the cytoplasmic part of the 5th and 6th transmembrane helix (TM5 and TM6). The structure of activated beta-2 adrenergic receptor in complex with Gs confirmed that the Gα binds to a cavity created by this movement.

GPCRs exhibit a similar structure to some other proteins with seven transmembrane domains, such as microbial rhodopsins and adiponectin receptors 1 and 2 (ADIPOR1 and ADIPOR2). However, these 7TMH (7-transmembrane helices) receptors and channels do not associate with G proteins. In addition, ADIPOR1 and ADIPOR2 are oriented oppositely to GPCRs in the membrane (i.e. GPCRs usually have an extracellular N-terminus, cytoplasmic C-terminus, whereas ADIPORs are inverted).

==Structure–function relationships==
In terms of structure, GPCRs are characterized by an extracellular N-terminus, followed by seven transmembrane (7-TM) α-helices (TM-1 to TM-7) connected by three intracellular (IL-1 to IL-3) and three extracellular loops (EL-1 to EL-3), and finally an intracellular C-terminus. The GPCR arranges itself into a tertiary structure resembling a barrel, with the seven transmembrane helices forming a cavity within the plasma membrane that serves a ligand-binding domain that is often covered by EL-2. Ligands may also bind elsewhere, however, as is the case for bulkier ligands (e.g., proteins or large peptides), which instead interact with the extracellular loops, or, as illustrated by the class C metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs), the N-terminal tail. The class C GPCRs are distinguished by their large N-terminal tail, which also contains a ligand-binding domain. Upon glutamate-binding to an mGluR, the N-terminal tail undergoes a conformational change that leads to its interaction with the residues of the extracellular loops and TM domains. The eventual effect of all three types of agonist-induced activation is a change in the relative orientations of the TM helices (likened to a twisting motion) leading to a wider intracellular surface and &quot;revelation&quot; of residues of the intracellular helices and TM domains crucial to signal transduction function (i.e., G-protein coupling). Inverse agonists and antagonists may also bind to a number of different sites, but the eventual effect must be prevention of this TM helix reorientation.

The structure of the N- and C-terminal tails of GPCRs may also serve important functions beyond ligand-binding. For example, The C-terminus of M3 muscarinic receptors is sufficient, and the six-amino-acid polybasic (KKKRRK) domain in the C-terminus is necessary for its preassembly with Gq proteins. In particular, the C-terminus often contains serine (Ser) or threonine (Thr) residues that, when phosphorylated, increase the affinity of the intracellular surface for the binding of scaffolding proteins called β-arrestins (β-arr). Once bound, β-arrestins both sterically prevent G-protein coupling and may recruit other proteins, leading to the creation of signaling complexes involved in extracellular-signal regulated kinase (ERK) pathway activation or receptor endocytosis (internalization). As the phosphorylation of these Ser and Thr residues often occurs as a result of GPCR activation, the β-arr-mediated G-protein-decoupling and internalization of GPCRs are important mechanisms of desensitization. In addition, internalized &quot;mega-complexes&quot; consisting of a single GPCR, β-arr(in the tail conformation), and heterotrimeric G protein exist and may account for protein signaling from endosomes.

A final common structural theme among GPCRs is palmitoylation of one or more sites of the C-terminal tail or the intracellular loops. Palmitoylation is the covalent modification of cysteine (Cys) residues via addition of hydrophobic acyl groups, and has the effect of targeting the receptor to cholesterol- and sphingolipid-rich microdomains of the plasma membrane called lipid rafts. As many of the downstream transducer and effector molecules of GPCRs (including those involved in negative feedback pathways) are also targeted to lipid rafts, this has the effect of facilitating rapid receptor signaling.

GPCRs respond to extracellular signals mediated by a huge diversity of agonists, ranging from proteins to biogenic amines to protons, but all transduce this signal via a mechanism of G-protein coupling. This is made possible by a guanine-nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) domain primarily formed by a combination of IL-2 and IL-3 along with adjacent residues of the associated TM helices.

==Mechanism==
The G protein-coupled receptor is activated by an external signal in the form of a ligand or other signal mediator. This creates a conformational change in the receptor, causing activation of a G protein. Further effect depends on the type of G protein. G proteins are subsequently inactivated by GTPase activating proteins, known as RGS proteins.

===Ligand binding===
GPCRs include one or more receptors for the following ligands:
sensory signal mediators (e.g., light and olfactory stimulatory molecules);
adenosine, bombesin, bradykinin, endothelin, γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), melanocortins, neuropeptide Y, opioid peptides, opsins, somatostatin, GH, tachykinins, members of the vasoactive intestinal peptide family, and vasopressin;
biogenic amines (e.g., dopamine, epinephrine, norepinephrine, histamine, serotonin, and melatonin);
glutamate (metabotropic effect);
glucagon;
acetylcholine (muscarinic effect);
chemokines;
lipid mediators of inflammation (e.g., prostaglandins, prostanoids, platelet-activating factor, and leukotrienes);
peptide hormones (e.g., calcitonin, C5a anaphylatoxin, follicle-stimulating hormone [FSH], gonadotropin-releasing hormone [GnRH], neurokinin, thyrotropin-releasing hormone [TRH], and oxytocin);
and endocannabinoids.

GPCRs that act as receptors for stimuli that have not yet been identified are known as orphan receptors.

However, in contrast to other types of receptors that have been studied, wherein ligands bind externally to the membrane, the ligands of GPCRs typically bind within the transmembrane domain. However, protease-activated receptors are activated by cleavage of part of their extracellular domain.

=== Conformational change ===

The transduction of the signal through the membrane by the receptor is not completely understood. It is known that in the inactive state, the GPCR is bound to a heterotrimeric G protein complex. Binding of an agonist to the GPCR results in a conformational change in the receptor that is transmitted to the bound Gα subunit of the heterotrimeric G protein via protein domain dynamics. The activated Gα subunit exchanges GTP in place of GDP which in turn triggers the dissociation of Gα subunit from the Gβγ dimer and from the receptor. The dissociated Gα and Gβγ subunits interact with other intracellular proteins to continue the signal transduction cascade while the freed GPCR is able to rebind to another heterotrimeric G protein to form a new complex that is ready to initiate another round of signal transduction.

It is believed that a receptor molecule exists in a conformational equilibrium between active and inactive biophysical states. The binding of ligands to the receptor may shift the equilibrium toward the active receptor states. Three types of ligands exist: Agonists are ligands that shift the equilibrium in favour of active states; inverse agonists are ligands that shift the equilibrium in favour of inactive states; and neutral antagonists are ligands that do not affect the equilibrium. It is not yet known how exactly the active and inactive states differ from each other.

===G-protein activation/deactivation cycle===
When the receptor is inactive, the GEF domain may be bound to an also inactive α-subunit of a heterotrimeric G-protein. These &quot;G-proteins&quot; are a trimer of α, β, and γ subunits (known as Gα, Gβ, and Gγ, respectively) that is rendered inactive when reversibly bound to Guanosine diphosphate (GDP) (or, alternatively, no guanine nucleotide) but active when bound to guanosine triphosphate (GTP). Upon receptor activation, the GEF domain, in turn, allosterically activates the G-protein by facilitating the exchange of a molecule of GDP for GTP at the G-protein&#x27;s α-subunit. The cell maintains a 10:1 ratio of cytosolic GTP:GDP so exchange for GTP is ensured. At this point, the subunits of the G-protein dissociate from the receptor, as well as each other, to yield a Gα-GTP monomer and a tightly interacting Gβγ dimer, which are now free to modulate the activity of other intracellular proteins. The extent to which they may diffuse, however, is limited due to the palmitoylation of Gα and the presence of an isoprenoid moiety that has been covalently added to the C-termini of Gγ.

Because Gα also has slow GTP→GDP hydrolysis capability, the inactive form of the α-subunit (Gα-GDP) is eventually regenerated, thus allowing reassociation with a Gβγ dimer to form the &quot;resting&quot; G-protein, which can again bind to a GPCR and await activation. The rate of GTP hydrolysis is often accelerated due to the actions of another family of allosteric modulating proteins called regulators of G-protein signaling, or RGS proteins, which are a type of GTPase-activating protein, or GAP. In fact, many of the primary effector proteins (e.g., adenylate cyclases) that become activated/inactivated upon interaction with Gα-GTP also have GAP activity. Thus, even at this early stage in the process, GPCR-initiated signaling has the capacity for self-termination.

===Crosstalk===

GPCRs downstream signals have been shown to possibly interact with integrin signals, such as FAK. Integrin signaling will phosphorylate FAK, which can then decrease GPCR Gαs activity.

==Signaling==
If a receptor in an active state encounters a G protein, it may activate it. Some evidence suggests that receptors and G proteins are actually pre-coupled. For example, binding of G proteins to receptors affects the receptor&#x27;s affinity for ligands. Activated G proteins are bound to GTP.

Further signal transduction depends on the type of G protein. The enzyme adenylate cyclase is an example of a cellular protein that can be regulated by a G protein, in this case the G protein Gs. Adenylate cyclase activity is activated when it binds to a subunit of the activated G protein. Activation of adenylate cyclase ends when the G protein returns to the GDP-bound state.

Adenylate cyclases (of which 9 membrane-bound and one cytosolic forms are known in humans) may also be activated or inhibited in other ways (e.g., Ca2+/calmodulin binding), which can modify the activity of these enzymes in an additive or synergistic fashion along with the G proteins.

The signaling pathways activated through a GPCR are limited by the primary sequence and tertiary structure of the GPCR itself but ultimately determined by the particular conformation stabilized by a particular ligand, as well as the availability of transducer molecules. Currently, GPCRs are considered to utilize two primary types of transducers: G-proteins and β-arrestins. Because β-arr&#x27;s have high affinity only to the phosphorylated form of most GPCRs (see above or below), the majority of signaling is ultimately dependent upon G-protein activation. However, the possibility for interaction does allow for G-protein-independent signaling to occur.

===G-protein-dependent signaling===

There are three main G-protein-mediated signaling pathways, mediated by four sub-classes of G-proteins distinguished from each other by sequence homology (Gαs, Gαi/o, Gαq/11, and Gα12/13). Each sub-class of G-protein consists of multiple proteins, each the product of multiple genes or splice variations that may imbue them with differences ranging from subtle to distinct with regard to signaling properties, but in general they appear reasonably grouped into four classes. Because the signal transducing properties of the various possible βγ combinations do not appear to radically differ from one another, these classes are defined according to the isoform of their α-subunit.

While most GPCRs are capable of activating more than one Gα-subtype, they also show a preference for one subtype over another. When the subtype activated depends on the ligand that is bound to the GPCR, this is called functional selectivity (also known as agonist-directed trafficking, or conformation-specific agonism). However, the binding of any single particular agonist may also initiate activation of multiple different G-proteins, as it may be capable of stabilizing more than one conformation of the GPCR&#x27;s GEF domain, even over the course of a single interaction. In addition, a conformation that preferably activates one isoform of Gα may activate another if the preferred is less available. Furthermore, feedback pathways may result in receptor modifications (e.g., phosphorylation) that alter the G-protein preference. Regardless of these various nuances, the GPCR&#x27;s preferred coupling partner is usually defined according to the G-protein most obviously activated by the endogenous ligand under most physiological or experimental conditions.

====Gα signaling====

# The effector of both the Gαs and Gαi/o pathways is the cyclic-adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-generating enzyme adenylate cyclase, or AC. While there are ten different AC gene products in mammals, each with subtle differences in tissue distribution or function, all catalyze the conversion of cytosolic adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to cAMP, and all are directly stimulated by G-proteins of the Gαs class. In contrast, however, interaction with Gα subunits of the Gαi/o type inhibits AC from generating cAMP. Thus, a GPCR coupled to Gαs counteracts the actions of a GPCR coupled to Gαi/o, and vice versa. The level of cytosolic cAMP may then determine the activity of various ion channels as well as members of the ser/thr-specific protein kinase A (PKA) family. Thus cAMP is considered a second messenger and PKA a secondary effector.
# The effector of the Gαq/11 pathway is phospholipase C-β (PLCβ), which catalyzes the cleavage of membrane-bound phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) into the second messengers inositol (1,4,5) trisphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG). IP3 acts on IP3 receptors found in the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to elicit Ca2+ release from the ER, while DAG diffuses along the plasma membrane where it may activate any membrane localized forms of a second ser/thr kinase called protein kinase C (PKC). Since many isoforms of PKC are also activated by increases in intracellular Ca2+, both these pathways can also converge on each other to signal through the same secondary effector. Elevated intracellular Ca2+ also binds and allosterically activates proteins called calmodulins, which in turn tosolic small GTPase, Rho. Once bound to GTP, Rho can then go on to activate various proteins responsible for cytoskeleton regulation such as Rho-kinase (ROCK). Most GPCRs that couple to Gα12/13 also couple to other sub-classes, often Gαq/11.

====Gβγ signaling====

The above descriptions ignore the effects of Gβγ–signalling, which can also be important, in particular in the case of activated Gαi/o-coupled GPCRs. The primary effectors of Gβγ are various ion channels, such as G-protein-regulated inwardly rectifying K+ channels (GIRKs), P/Q- and N-type voltage-gated Ca2+ channels, as well as some isoforms of AC and PLC, along with some phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K) isoforms.

===G-protein-independent signaling===

Although they are classically thought of working only together, GPCRs may signal through G-protein-independent mechanisms, and heterotrimeric G-proteins may play functional roles independent of GPCRs. GPCRs may signal independently through many proteins already mentioned for their roles in G-protein-dependent signaling such as β-arrs, GRKs, and Srcs. Such signaling has been shown to be physiologically relevant, for example, β-arrestin signaling mediated by the chemokine receptor CXCR3 was necessary for full efficacy chemotaxis of activated T cells. In addition, further scaffolding proteins involved in subcellular localization of GPCRs (e.g., PDZ-domain-containing proteins) may also act as signal transducers. Most often the effector is a member of the MAPK family.

====Examples====

In the late 1990s, evidence began accumulating to suggest that some GPCRs are able to signal without G proteins. The ERK2 mitogen-activated protein kinase, a key signal transduction mediator downstream of receptor activation in many pathways, has been shown to be activated in response to cAMP-mediated receptor activation in the slime mold &quot;D. discoideum&quot; despite the absence of the associated G protein α- and β-subunits.

In mammalian cells, the much-studied β2-adrenoceptor has been demonstrated to activate the ERK2 pathway after arrestin-mediated uncoupling of G-protein-mediated signaling. Therefore, it seems likely that some mechanisms previously believed related purely to receptor desensitisation are actually examples of receptors switching their signaling pathway, rather than simply being switched off.

In kidney cells, the bradykinin receptor B2 has been shown to interact directly with a protein tyrosine phosphatase. The presence of a tyrosine-phosphorylated ITIM (immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif) sequence in the B2 receptor is necessary to mediate this interaction and subsequently the antiproliferative effect of bradykinin.

====GPCR-independent signaling by heterotrimeric G-proteins====

Although it is a relatively immature area of research, it appears that heterotrimeric G-proteins may also take part in non-GPCR signaling. There is evidence for roles as signal transducers in nearly all other types of receptor-mediated signaling, including integrins, receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), cytokine receptors (JAK/STATs), as well as modulation of various other &quot;accessory&quot; proteins such as GEFs, guanine-nucleotide dissociation inhibitors (GDIs) and protein phosphatases. There may even be specific proteins of these classes whose primary function is as part of GPCR-independent pathways, termed activators of G-protein signalling (AGS). Both the ubiquity of these interactions and the importance of Gα vs. Gβγ subunits to these processes are still unclear.

==Details of cAMP and PIP2 pathways==

There are two principal signal transduction pathways involving the G protein-linked receptors: the cAMP signal pathway and the phosphatidylinositol signal pathway.

===cAMP signal pathway===
The cAMP signal transduction contains five main characters: stimulative hormone receptor (Rs) or inhibitory hormone receptor (Ri); stimulative regulative G-protein (Gs) or inhibitory regulative G-protein (Gi); adenylyl cyclase; protein kinase A (PKA); and cAMP phosphodiesterase.

Stimulative hormone receptor (Rs) is a receptor that can bind with stimulative signal molecules, while inhibitory hormone receptor (Ri) is a receptor that can bind with inhibitory signal molecules.

Stimulative regulative G-protein is a G-protein linked to stimulative hormone receptor (Rs), and its α subunit upon activation could stimulate the activity of an enzyme or other intracellular metabolism. On the contrary, inhibitory regulative G-protein is linked to an inhibitory hormone receptor, and its α subunit upon activation could inhibit the activity of an enzyme or other intracellular metabolism.

Adenylyl cyclase is a 12-transmembrane glycoprotein that catalyzes the conversion of ATP to cAMP with the help of cofactor Mg2+ or Mn2+. The cAMP produced is a second messenger in cellular metabolism and is an allosteric activator of protein kinase A.

Protein kinase A is an important enzyme in cell metabolism due to its ability to regulate cell metabolism by phosphorylating specific committed enzymes in the metabolic pathway. It can also regulate specific gene expression, cellular secretion, and membrane permeability. The protein enzyme contains two catalytic subunits and two regulatory subunits. When there is no cAMP，the complex is inactive. When cAMP binds to the regulatory subunits, their conformation is altered, causing the dissociation of the regulatory subunits, which activates protein kinase A and allows further biological effects.

These signals then can be terminated by cAMP phosphodiesterase, which is an enzyme that degrades cAMP to 5&#x27;-AMP and inactivates protein kinase A.

===Phosphatidylinositol signal pathway===
In the phosphatidylinositol signal pathway, the extracellular signal molecule binds with the G-protein receptor (Gq) on the cell surface and activates phospholipase C, which is located on the plasma membrane. The lipase hydrolyzes phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) into two second messengers: inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG). IP3 binds with the IP3 receptor in the membrane of the smooth endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria to open Ca2+ channels. DAG helps activate protein kinase C (PKC), which phosphorylates many other proteins, changing their catalytic activities, leading to cellular responses.

The effects of Ca2+ are also remarkable: it cooperates with DAG in activating PKC and can activate the CaM kinase pathway, in which calcium-modulated protein calmodulin (CaM) binds Ca2+, undergoes a change in conformation, and activates CaM kinase II, which has unique ability to increase its binding affinity to CaM by autophosphorylation, making CaM unavailable for the activation of other enzymes. The kinase then phosphorylates target enzymes, regulating their activities. The two signal pathways are connected together by Ca2+-CaM, which is also a regulatory subunit of adenylyl cyclase and phosphodiesterase in the cAMP signal pathway.

==Receptor regulation==

GPCRs become desensitized when exposed to their ligand for a long period of time. There are two recognized forms of desensitization: 1) homologous desensitization, in which the activated GPCR is downregulated; and 2) heterologous desensitization, wherein the activated GPCR causes downregulation of a different GPCR. The key reaction of this downregulation is the phosphorylation of the intracellular (or cytoplasmic) receptor domain by protein kinases.

===Phosphorylation by cAMP-dependent protein kinases===

Cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinases (protein kinase A) are activated by the signal chain coming from the G protein (that was activated by the receptor) via adenylate cyclase and cyclic AMP (cAMP). In a &quot;feedback mechanism&quot;, these activated kinases phosphorylate the receptor. The longer the receptor remains active the more kinases are activated and the more receptors are phosphorylated. In β2-adrenoceptors, this phosphorylation results in the switching of the coupling from the Gs class of G-protein to the Gi class. cAMP-dependent PKA mediated phosphorylation can cause heterologous desensitisation in receptors other than those activated.

===Phosphorylation by GRKs===

The G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs) are protein kinases that phosphorylate only active GPCRs. G-protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs) are key modulators of G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling. They constitute a family of seven mammalian serine-threonine protein kinases that phosphorylate agonist-bound receptor. GRKs-mediated receptor phosphorylation rapidly initiates profound impairment of receptor signaling and desensitization. Activity of GRKs and subcellular targeting is tightly regulated by interaction with receptor domains, G protein subunits, lipids, anchoring proteins and calcium-sensitive proteins.

Phosphorylation of the receptor can have two consequences:

# &quot;Translocation&quot;: The receptor is, along with the part of the membrane it is embedded in, brought to the inside of the cell, where it is dephosphorylated within the acidic vesicular environment and then brought back. This mechanism is used to regulate long-term exposure, for example, to a hormone, by allowing resensitisation to follow desensitisation. Alternatively, the receptor may undergo lysozomal degradation, or remain internalised, where it is thought to participate in the initiation of signalling events, the nature of which depending on the internalised vesicle&#x27;s subcellular localisation.
# &quot;Arrestin linking&quot;: The phosphorylated receptor can be linked to &quot;arrestin&quot; molecules that prevent it from binding (and activating) G proteins, in effect switching it off for a short period of time. This mechanism is used, for example, with rhodopsin in retina cells to compensate for exposure to bright light. In many cases, arrestin&#x27;s binding to the receptor is a prerequisite for translocation. For example, beta-arrestin bound to β2-adrenoreceptors acts as an adaptor for binding with clathrin, and with the beta-subunit of AP2 (clathrin adaptor molecules); thus, the arrestin here acts as a scaffold assembling the components needed for clathrin-mediated endocytosis of β2-adrenoreceptors.

===Mechanisms of GPCR signal termination===

As mentioned above, G-proteins may terminate their own activation due to their intrinsic GTP→GDP hydrolysis capability. However, this reaction proceeds at a slow rate (≈0.02 times/sec) and, thus, it would take around 50 seconds for any single G-protein to deactivate if other factors did not come into play. Indeed, there are around 30 isoforms of RGS proteins that, when bound to Gα through their GAP domain, accelerate the hydrolysis rate to ≈30 times/sec. This 1500-fold increase in rate allows for the cell to respond to external signals with high speed, as well as spatial resolution due to limited amount of second messenger that can be generated and limited distance a G-protein can diffuse in 0.03 seconds. For the most part, the RGS proteins are promiscuous in their ability to deactivate G-proteins, while which RGS is involved in a given signaling pathway seems more determined by the tissue and GPCR involved than anything else. In addition, RGS proteins have the additional function of increasing the rate of GTP-GDP exchange at GPCRs, (i.e., as a sort of co-GEF) further contributing to the time resolution of GPCR signaling.

In addition, the GPCR may be desensitized itself. This can occur as:

# a direct result of ligand occupation, wherein the change in conformation allows recruitment of GPCR-Regulating Kinases (GRKs), which go on to phosphorylate various serine/threonine residues of IL-3 and the C-terminal tail. Upon GRK phosphorylation, the GPCR&#x27;s affinity for β-arrestin (β-arrestin-1/2 in most tissues) is increased, at which point β-arrestin may bind and act to both sterically hinder G-protein coupling as well as initiate the process of receptor internalization through clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Because only the liganded receptor is desensitized by this mechanism, it is called homologous desensitization
# the affinity for β-arrestin may be increased in a ligand occupation and GRK-independent manner through phosphorylation of different ser/thr sites (but also of IL-3 and the C-terminal tail) by PKC and PKA. These phosphorylations are often sufficient to impair G-protein coupling on their own as well.
# PKC/PKA may, instead, phosphorylate GRKs, which can also lead to GPCR phosphorylation and β-arrestin binding in an occupation-independent manner. These latter two mechanisms allow for desensitization of one GPCR due to the activities of others, or heterologous desensitization. GRKs may also have GAP domains and so may contribute to inactivation through non-kinase mechanisms as well. A combination of these mechanisms may also occur.

Once β-arrestin is bound to a GPCR, it undergoes a conformational change allowing it to serve as a scaffolding protein for an adaptor complex termed AP-2, which in turn recruits another protein called clathrin. If enough receptors in the local area recruit clathrin in this manner, they aggregate and the membrane buds inwardly as a result of interactions between the molecules of clathrin, in a process called opsonization. Once the pit has been pinched off the plasma membrane due to the actions of two other proteins called amphiphysin and dynamin, it is now an endocytic vesicle. At this point, the adapter molecules and clathrin have dissociated, and the receptor is either trafficked back to the plasma membrane or targeted to lysosomes for degradation.

At any point in this process, the β-arrestins may also recruit other proteins—such as the non-receptor tyrosine kinase (nRTK), c-SRC—which may activate ERK1/2, or other mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling through, for example, phosphorylation of the small GTPase, Ras, or recruit the proteins of the ERK cascade directly (i.e., Raf-1, MEK, ERK-1/2) at which point signaling is initiated due to their close proximity to one another. Another target of c-SRC are the dynamin molecules involved in endocytosis. Dynamins polymerize around the neck of an incoming vesicle, and their phosphorylation by c-SRC provides the energy necessary for the conformational change allowing the final &quot;pinching off&quot; from the membrane.

===GPCR cellular regulation===
Receptor desensitization is mediated through a combination phosphorylation, β-arr binding, and endocytosis as described above. Downregulation occurs when endocytosed receptor is embedded in an endosome that is trafficked to merge with an organelle called a lysosome. Because lysosomal membranes are rich in proton pumps, their interiors have low pH (≈4.8 vs. the pH≈7.2 cytosol), which acts to denature the GPCRs. In addition, lysosomes contain many degradative enzymes, including proteases, which can function only at such low pH, and so the peptide bonds joining the residues of the GPCR together may be cleaved. Whether or not a given receptor is trafficked to a lysosome, detained in endosomes, or trafficked back to the plasma membrane depends on a variety of factors, including receptor type and magnitude of the signal.
GPCR regulation is additionally mediated by gene transcription factors. These factors can increase or decrease gene transcription and thus increase or decrease the generation of new receptors (up- or down-regulation) that travel to the cell membrane.

==Receptor oligomerization==
G-protein-coupled receptor oligomerisation is a widespread phenomenon. One of the best-studied examples is the metabotropic GABAB receptor. This so-called constitutive receptor is formed by heterodimerization of GABABR1 and GABABR2 subunits. Expression of the GABABR1 without the GABABR2 in heterologous systems leads to retention of the subunit in the endoplasmic reticulum. Expression of the GABABR2 subunit alone, meanwhile, leads to surface expression of the subunit, although with no functional activity (i.e., the receptor does not bind agonist and cannot initiate a response following exposure to agonist). Expression of the two subunits together leads to plasma membrane expression of functional receptor. It has been shown that GABABR2 binding to GABABR1 causes masking of a retention signal of functional receptors.

==Origin and diversification of the superfamily==
Signal transduction mediated by the superfamily of GPCRs dates back to the origin of multicellularity. Mammalian-like GPCRs are found in fungi, and have been classified according to the GRAFS classification system based on GPCR fingerprints. Identification of the superfamily members across the eukaryotic domain, and comparison of the family-specific motifs, have shown that the superfamily of GPCRs have a common origin. Characteristic motifs indicate that three of the five GRAFS families, &quot;Rhodopsin&quot;, &quot;Adhesion&quot;, and &quot;Frizzled&quot;, evolved from the &quot;Dictyostelium discoideum&quot; cAMP receptors before the split of opisthokonts. Later, the &quot;Secretin&quot; family evolved from the &quot;Adhesion&quot; GPCR receptor family before the split of nematodes. Insect GPCRs appear to be in their own group and Taste2 is identified as descending from &quot;Rhodopsin&quot;. Note that the &quot;Secretin&quot;/&quot;Adhesion&quot; split is based on presumed function rather than signature, as the classical Class B (7tm_2, ) is used to identify both in the studies.
