<text>GTPases are a large family of hydrolase enzymes that bind to the nucleotide guanosine triphosphate (GTP) and hydrolyze it to guanosine diphosphate (GDP). The GTP binding and hydrolysis takes place in the highly conserved P-loop &quot;G domain&quot;, a protein domain common to many GTPases.

==Functions==
GTPases function as molecular switches or timers in many fundamental cellular processes.

Examples of these roles include: 
* Signal transduction in response to activation of cell surface receptors, including transmembrane receptors such as those mediating taste, smell and vision.
* Protein biosynthesis (a.k.a. translation) at the ribosome. 
* Regulation of cell differentiation, proliferation, division and movement. 
* Translocation of proteins through membranes. 
* Transport of vesicles within the cell, and vesicle-mediated secretion and uptake, through GTPase control of vesicle coat assembly.

GTPases are active when bound to GTP and inactive when bound to GDP. In the generalized receptor-transducer-effector signaling model of Martin Rodbell, signaling GTPases act as transducers to regulate the activity of effector proteins. This inactive-active switch is due to conformational changes in the protein distinguishing these two forms, particularly of the &quot;switch&quot; regions that in the active state are able to make protein-protein contacts with partner proteins that alter the function of these effectors.

== Mechanism ==
Hydrolysis of GTP bound to an (active) G domain-GTPase leads to deactivation of the signaling/timer function of the enzyme. The hydrolysis of the third (γ) phosphate of GTP to create guanosine diphosphate (GDP) and Pi, inorganic phosphate, occurs by the SN2 mechanism (see nucleophilic substitution) via a pentacoordinate transition state and is dependent on the presence of a magnesium ion Mg2+.

GTPase activity serves as the shutoff mechanism for the signaling roles of GTPases by returning the active, GTP-bound protein to the inactive, GDP-bound state. Most &quot;GTPases&quot; have functional GTPase activity, allowing them to remain active (that is, bound to GTP) only for a short time before deactivating themselves by converting bound GTP to bound GDP. However, many GTPases also use accessory proteins named GTPase-activating proteins or GAPs to accelerate their GTPase activity. This further limits the active lifetime of signaling GTPases. Some GTPases have little to no intrinsic GTPase activity, and are entirely dependent on GAP proteins for deactivation (such as the ADP-ribosylation factor or ARF family of small GTP-binding proteins that are involved in vesicle-mediated transport within cells).

To become activated, GTPases must bind to GTP. Since mechanisms to convert bound GDP directly into GTP are unknown, the inactive GTPases are induced to release bound GDP by the action of distinct regulatory proteins called guanine nucleotide exchange factors or GEFs. The nucleotide-free GTPase protein quickly rebinds GTP, which is in far excess in healthy cells over GDP, allowing the GTPase to enter the active conformation state and promote its effects on the cell. For many GTPases, activation of GEFs is the primary control mechanism in the stimulation of the GTPase signaling functions, although GAPs also play an important role. For heterotrimeric G proteins and many small GTP-binding proteins, GEF activity is stimulated by cell surface receptors in response to signals outside the cell (for heterotrimeric G proteins, the G protein-coupled receptors are themselves GEFs, while for receptor-activated small GTPases their GEFs are distinct from cell surface receptors).

Some GTPases also bind to accessory proteins called guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitors or GDIs that stabilize the inactive, GDP-bound state.

The amount of active GTPase can be changed in several ways: 
# Acceleration of GDP dissociation by GEFs speeds up the accumulation of active GTPase. 
# Inhibition of GDP dissociation by guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitors (GDIs) slows down accumulation of active GTPase. 
# Acceleration of GTP hydrolysis by GAPs reduces the amount of active GTPase. 
# Artificial &quot;GTP analogues&quot; like &quot;GTP-γ-S&quot;, &quot;β,γ-methylene-GTP&quot;, and &quot;β,γ-imino-GTP&quot; that cannot be hydrolyzed can lock the GTPase in its active state.
# Mutations (such as those that reduce the intrinsic GTP hydrolysis rate) can lock the GTPase in the active state, and such mutations in the small GTPase Ras are particularly common in some forms of cancer.

== G domain GTPases ==
In most GTPases, the specificity for the base guanine versus other nucleotides is imparted by the base-recognition motif, which has the consensus sequence [N/T]KXD. The following classification is based on shared features; some examples have mutations in the base-recognition motif that shift their substrate specificity, most commonly to ATP.

=== TRAFAC class ===
The TRAFAC class of G domain proteins is named after the prototypical member, the translation factor G proteins. They play roles in translation, signal transduction, and cell motility.

====Translation factor superfamily====

Multiple classical translation factor family GTPases play important roles in initiation, elongation and termination of protein biosynthesis. Sharing a similar mode of ribosome binding due to the β-EI domain following the GTPase, the most well-known members of the family are EF-1A/EF-Tu, EF-2/EF-G, and class 2 release factors. Other members include EF-4 (LepA), BipA (TypA), &quot;SelB&quot; (bacterial selenocysteinyl-tRNA EF-Tu paralog), &quot;Tet&quot; (tetracycline resistance by ribosomal protection), and HBS1L (eukaryotic ribosome rescue protein similar to release factors).

The superfamily also includes the Bms1 family from yeast.

====Ras-like superfamily ====

=====Heterotrimeric G proteins=====

Heterotrimeric G protein complexes are composed of three distinct protein subunits named &quot;alpha&quot; (α), &quot;beta&quot; (β) and &quot;gamma&quot; (γ) subunits. The alpha subunits contain the GTP binding/GTPase domain flanked by long regulatory regions, while the beta and gamma subunits form a stable dimeric complex referred to as the beta-gamma complex. When activated, a heterotrimeric G protein dissociates into activated, GTP-bound alpha subunit and separate beta-gamma subunit, each of which can perform distinct signaling roles. The α and γ subunit are modified by lipid anchors to increase their association with the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane.

Heterotrimeric G proteins act as the transducers of G protein-coupled receptors, coupling receptor activation to downstream signaling effectors and second messengers. In unstimulated cells, heterotrimeric G proteins are assembled as the GDP bound, inactive trimer (Gα-GDP-Gβγ complex). Upon receptor activation, the activated receptor intracellular domain acts as GEF to release GDP from the G protein complex and to promote binding of GTP in its place. The GTP-bound complex undergoes an activating conformation shift that dissociates it from the receptor and also breaks the complex into its component G protein alpha and beta-gamma subunit components. While these activated G protein subunits are now free to activate their effectors, the active receptor is likewise free to activate additional G proteins – this allows catalytic activation and amplification where one receptor may activate many G proteins.

G protein signaling is terminated by hydrolysis of bound GTP to bound GDP. This can occur through the intrinsic GTPase activity of the α subunit, or be accelerated by separate regulatory proteins that act as GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs), such as members of the Regulator of G protein signaling (RGS) family). The speed of the hydrolysis reaction works as an internal clock limiting the length of the signal. Once Gα is returned to being GDP bound, the two parts of the heterotrimer re-associate to the original, inactive state.

The heterotrimeric G proteins can be classified by sequence homology of the α unit and by their functional targets into four families: Gs family, Gi family, Gq family and G12 family. Each of these Gα protein families contains multiple members, such that the mammals have 16 distinct α-subunit genes. The Gβ and Gγ are likewise composed of many members, increasing heterotrimer structural and functional diversity. Among the target molecules of the specific G proteins are the second messenger-generating enzymes adenylyl cyclase and phospholipase C, as well as various ion channels.

=====Small GTPases=====

Small GTPases function as monomers and have a molecular weight of about 21 kilodaltons that consists primarily of the GTPase domain. They are also called small or monomeric guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory proteins, small or monomeric GTP-binding proteins, or small or monomeric G-proteins, and because they have significant homology with the first-identified such protein, named Ras, they are also referred to as Ras superfamily GTPases. Small GTPases generally serve as molecular switches and signal transducers for a wide variety of cellular signaling events, often involving membranes, vesicles or cytoskeleton. According to their primary amino acid sequences and biochemical properties, the many Ras superfamily small GTPases are further divided into five subfamilies with distinct functions: Ras, Rho (&quot;Ras-homology&quot;), Rab, Arf and Ran. While many small GTPases are activated by their GEFs in response to intracellular signals emanating from cell surface receptors (particularly growth factor receptors), regulatory GEFs for many other small GTPases are activated in response to intrinsic cell signals, not cell surface (external) signals.

==== Myosin-kinesin superfamily ====
This class is defined by loss of two beta-strands and additional N-terminal strands. Both namesakes of this superfamily, myosin and kinesin, have shifted to use ATP.

=====Large GTPases=====
See dynamin as a prototype for large monomeric GTPases.

=== SIMIBI class ===
Much of the SIMIBI class of GTPases is activated by dimerization. Named after the signal recognition particle (SRP), MinD, and BioD, the class is involved in protein localization, chromosome partitioning, and membrane transport. Several members of this class, including MinD and Get3, has shifted in substrate specificity to become ATPases.

====Translocation factors====

For a discussion of Translocation factors and the role of GTP, see signal recognition particle (SRP).

== Other GTPases ==
While tubulin and related structural proteins also bind and hydrolyze GTP as part of their function to form intracellular tubules, these proteins utilize a distinct tubulin domain that is unrelated to the G domain used by signaling GTPases.

There are also GTP-hydrolyzing proteins that use a P-loop from a superclass other than the G-domain-containing one. Examples include the NACHT proteins of its own superclass and McrB protein of the AAA+ superclass.

<doc id="12835" wikidata="Q237907" url="?curid=12835" title="Galla Placidia">
<text>Galla Placidia (392/93 – 27 November 450), daughter of the Roman emperor Theodosius I, was a mother, tutor, and advisor to emperor Valentinian III. She was queen consort to Ataulf, King of the Visigoths from 414 until his death in 415, briefly empress consort to Constantius III in 421, and managed the government administration as a regent during the early reign of Valentinian III until her death.

==Family==
Placidia was the daughter of Theodosius I and his second wife, Galla, who was herself daughter of Valentinian I and his second wife, Justina. Galla Placidia&#x27;s date of birth is not recorded, but she must have been born either in the period 388–89 or 392–93. Between these dates, her father was in Italy following his campaign against the usurper Magnus Maximus, while her mother remained in Constantinople.

A surviving letter from Bishop Ambrose of Milan, dated 390, refers to a younger son of Theodosius named Gratianus, who died in infancy; as Gratian must have been born in the period 388–89, it is most probable that Galla Placidia was born during the second period, 392–93. Placidia&#x27;s mother Galla died some time in 394, perhaps giving birth to a stillborn son.

Placidia was a younger, paternal half-sister of emperors Arcadius and Honorius. Her older half-sister Pulcheria predeceased her parents according to Gregory of Nyssa, placing the death of Pulcheria prior to the death of Aelia Flaccilla, the first wife of Theodosius I, in 385. Coins issued in Placidia&#x27;s honour in Constantinople after 425 give her name as AELIA PLACIDIA; this may have been intended to integrate Placidia with the eastern dynasty of Theodosius II. There is no evidence that the name Aelia was ever used in the west, or that it formed part of Placidia&#x27;s official nomenclature.

==Early life==
Placidia was granted her own household by her father in the early 390s and was thus financially independent while underage. She was summoned to the court of her father in Mediolanum (Milan) during 394, and was present at Theodosius&#x27; death on 17 January 395. She was granted the title of &quot;nobilissima puella&quot; (&quot;most noble girl&quot;) during her childhood.

Placidia spent most of her early years in the household of Stilicho and his wife, Serena. She is presumed to have learned weaving and embroidery. She might have also been given a classical education. Serena was a first cousin of Arcadius, Honorius and Placidia. The poem &quot;In Praise of Serena&quot; by Claudian and the &quot;Historia Nova&quot; by Zosimus clarify that Serena&#x27;s father was an elder Honorius, a brother to Theodosius I. According to &quot;De Consulatu Stilichonis&quot; by Claudian, Placidia was betrothed to Eucherius, only known son of Stilicho and Serena. Her scheduled marriage is mentioned in the text as the third union between Stilicho&#x27;s family and the Theodosian dynasty, following those of Stilicho to Serena and Maria, their daughter, to Honorius.

Stilicho was the &quot;magister militum&quot; of the Western Roman Empire. He was the only known person to hold the rank of &quot;magister militum in praesenti&quot; from 394 to 408 in both the Western and the Eastern Roman Empire. He was also titled &quot;magister equitum et peditum&quot; (&quot;Master of the Horse and the Foot&quot;), placing him in charge of both the cavalry and infantry forces of the Western Roman Empire. In 408, Arcadius died and was succeeded by his son Theodosius II, only seven years old. Stilicho planned to proceed to Constantinople and &quot;undertake the management of the affairs of Theodosius&quot;, convincing Honorius not to travel to the East himself. Shortly after, Olympius, &quot;magister scrinii&quot;, attempted to convince Honorius that Stilicho was in fact conspiring to depose Theodosius II, to replace him with Eucherius. Stilicho was arrested and executed by Honorius&#x27;s order on 22 August 408. Eucherius sought refuge in Rome but he was arrested there and executed by the eunuchs Arsacius and Tarentius, on imperial orders. Honorius appointed Tarentius imperial chamberlain, and gave the next post under him to Arsacius.

==First marriage==

In the disturbances that followed the fall of Stilicho, wives and children of &quot;foederati&quot; living in the cities of Italy were killed. Most of the &quot;foederati&quot;, regarded as loyal to Stilicho, joined the forces of Alaric I, King of the Visigoths. Alaric led them to Rome and put it under siege, with minor interruptions, from autumn 408 to 24 August 410. Zosimus records that Placidia was within the city during the siege. When Serena was accused of conspiring with Alaric, the whole senate and Placidia sentenced her to death.

Placidia was captured by Alaric before the fall of Rome, and accompanied the Visigoths from Italy to Gaul in 412. Their ruler Ataulf, having succeeded Alaric, entered an alliance with Honorius against Jovinus and Sebastianus, rival Western Roman emperors located in Gaul, and managed to defeat and execute both in 413.

After the heads of Sebastianus and Jovinus arrived at Honorius&#x27; court in Ravenna in late August, to be forwarded for display among other usurpers on the walls of Carthage, relations between Ataulf and Honorius improved sufficiently for Ataulf to cement them by marrying Galla Placidia at Narbonne on 1 January 414. The nuptials were celebrated with high Roman festivities and magnificent gifts. Priscus Attalus gave the wedding speech, a classical epithalamium. The marriage was recorded by Hydatius and Jordanes, although the latter states that it was earlier, in 411 at Forum Livii (Forlì) (possibly a more informal event).

Placidia and Ataulf had one son, Theodosius, born in Barcelona by the end of 414, but the child died early in the following year, eliminating an opportunity for a Romano-Visigothic line; years later the corpse was exhumed and reburied in the imperial mausoleum in Old St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica, Rome. In Hispania, Ataulf imprudently accepted into his service a man identified as &quot;Dubius&quot; or &quot;Eberwolf&quot;, a former follower of Sarus. Sarus had been a Germanic chieftain killed while fighting under Jovinus and Sebastianus, and his follower harbored a secret desire to avenge the death of his patron. In August/September, 415, in the palace at Barcelona, the man brought Ataulf&#x27;s reign to a sudden end by killing him while he bathed.

The Amali faction proceeded to proclaim Sigeric, a brother of Sarus, as the next king of the Visigoths. Sigeric killed Ataulf&#x27;s six children from a former wife by taking them away from Sigesar, bishop of the Goths. Galla Placidia, Ataulf&#x27;s widow, was forced to walk more than twelve miles on foot among the crowd of captives driven ahead of the mounted Sigeric. After 7 days of ruling, Sigeric was assassinated and replaced with Wallia, Ataulf&#x27;s relative.

==Second marriage==

According to the &quot;Chronicon Albeldense&quot;, included in the &quot;Códice de Roda&quot;, Wallia was desperate for food supplies. He surrendered to Constantius III, at the time &quot;magister militum&quot; of Honorius, negotiating terms giving foederati status for the Visigoths. Placidia was returned to Honorius as part of the peace treaty. Her brother Honorius forced her into marriage to Constantius III on 1 January 417. Their daughter Justa Grata Honoria was probably born in 417 or 418. The history of Paul the Deacon mentions her first among the children of the marriage, suggesting that she was the eldest. Their son Valentinian III was born 2 July 419.

Placidia intervened in the succession crisis following the death of Pope Zosimus on 26 December 418. Two factions of the Roman clergy had proceeded to elect their own popes, the first electing Eulalius (27 December) and the other electing Boniface I (28 December). They acted as rival popes, both in Rome, and their factions plunged the city into tumult. Symmachus, Prefect of Rome, sent his report to the imperial court at Ravenna, requesting an imperial decision on the matter. Placidia and, presumably, Constantius petitioned the emperor in favor of Eulalius. This was arguably the first intervention by an Emperor in the Papal election.

Honorius initially confirmed Eulalius as the legitimate pope. As this failed to put an end to the controversy, Honorius called a synod of Italian bishops at Ravenna to decide the matter. The synod met from February to March 419 but failed to reach a conclusion. Honorius called a second synod in May, this time including Gaulish and African bishops. In the meantime, the two rival popes were ordered to leave Rome. As Easter approached, however, Eulalius returned to the city and attempted to seize the Basilica of Saint John Lateran in order to &quot;preside at the paschal ceremonies&quot;. Imperial troops managed to repel him, and on Easter (30 March 419) the ceremonies were led by Achilleus, Bishop of Spoleto. The conflict cost Eulalius the imperial favor, and Boniface was proclaimed the legitimate pope as of 3 April 419, returning to Rome a week later. Placidia had personally written to the African bishops, summoning them to the second synod. Three of her letters are known to have survived.

On 8 February 421, Constantius was proclaimed an Augustus, becoming co-ruler with the childless Honorius. Placidia was proclaimed an Augusta. She was the only Empress in the West, since Honorius had divorced his second wife Thermantia in 408 and had never remarried. Neither title was recognised by Theodosius II, the Eastern Roman Emperor. Constantius reportedly complained about the loss of personal freedom and privacy that came with the imperial office. He died of an illness on 2 September 421.

==Widow==
According to Olympiodorus of Thebes, a historian used as a source by Zosimus, Sozomen and probably Philostorgius, the public grew suspicious of the increasingly scandalous public caresses she was said to have received from her own brother Honorius after her husband&#x27;s death. However, the siblings&#x27; relationship suddenly turned hostile, and around this time, she may have plotted against him. After her soldiers clashed with those of Honorius, Galla Placidia herself was now forced to flee to Constantinople with her children. Despite this setback, Bonifacius, governor of the Diocese of Africa continued to be loyal to her.

Placidia, Valentinian, and Honoria arrived in Constantinople around 422/423. On 15 August 423, Honorius died of edema, perhaps pulmonary edema. With no member of the Theodosian dynasty present at Ravenna to claim the throne, Theodosius II was expected to nominate a Western co-emperor. However, Theodosius hesitated and the decision was delayed. Taking advantage of the power vacuum, Castinus the Patrician proceeded to become a kingmaker. He declared Joannes, the &quot;primicerius notariorum&quot; &quot;chief notary&quot; (the head of the civil service), to be the new Western Roman Emperor. Among their supporters was Flavius Aetius. Joannes&#x27; rule was accepted in the provinces of Italia, Gaul and Hispania, but not in the province of Africa.

Theodosius II reacted by preparing Valentinian III for eventual promotion to the imperial office. In 423/424, Valentinian was named &quot;nobilissimus&quot;. In 424, Valentinian was betrothed to Licinia Eudoxia, his first cousin once removed. She was a daughter of Theodosius II and Aelia Eudocia. The year of their betrothal was recorded by Marcellinus Comes. At the time of their betrothal, Valentinian was approximately four years old, Licinia only two.

The campaign against Joannes also started in the same year. Forces of the Eastern Roman army gathered at Thessaloniki, and were placed under the general command of Ardaburius, who had served in the Roman-Persian War. The invasion force was to cross the Adriatic Sea by two routes. Aspar, son of Ardaburius, led the cavalry by land, following the coast of the Adriatic from the Western Balkans to Northern Italy. Placidia and Valentinian joined this force. Along the way, Valentinian was proclaimed &quot;Caesar&quot; by Helion, a &quot;magister officiorum&quot; under Theodosius in 23 October 424.

Ardaburius and the infantry boarded ships of the Eastern Roman navy in an attempt to reach Ravenna by sea. Aspar marched his forces to Aquileia, taking the city by surprise and with virtually no resistance. The fleet, on the other hand, was dispersed by a storm. Ardaburius and two of his galleys were captured by forces loyal to Joannes and were held prisoners in Ravenna. Ardaburius was treated well by Joannes, who probably intended to negotiate with Theodosius for an end to the hostilities. The prisoner was allowed the &quot;courteous freedom&quot; of walking the court and streets of Ravenna during his captivity. He took advantage of this privilege to come into contact with the forces of Joannes and convinced some of them to defect to Theodosius&#x27; side. The conspirators contacted Aspar and beckoned him to Ravenna. A shepherd led Aspar&#x27;s cavalry force through the marshes of the Po to the gates of Ravenna; with the besiegers outside the walls and the defectors within, the city was quickly captured. Joannes was taken and his right hand cut off; he was then mounted on a donkey and paraded through the streets, and finally beheaded in the hippodrome of Aquileia.

With Joannes dead, Valentinian was officially proclaimed the new Augustus of the Western Roman Empire on 23 October 425, by Helion, in the presence of the Roman Senate, with Theodosius II&#x27;s support. Three days following Joannes&#x27; death, Aetius brought reinforcements for his army, a reported number of sixty thousand Huns from across the Danube. After some skirmishing, Placidia, Valentinian and Aetius came to an agreement and established peace. The Huns were paid off and sent home, while Aetius received the position of &quot;comes&quot; and &quot;magister militum per Gallias&quot; (commander-in-chief of the Roman army in Gaul).

==Regent==

Galla Placidia became a regent of Western Roman Empire for her son, Valentinian, in 425 until Aetius&#x27; rise. Among her early supporters were Bonifacius and Felix. Aetius, their rival for influence, managed to secure Arles against Theodoric I of the Visigoths. The Visigoths concluded a treaty and were given Gallic noblemen as hostages. The later Emperor Avitus visited Theodoric, lived at his court and taught his sons. Felix, her ally, was assassinated in 430, possibly by Aetius.

===Conflict between Bonifacius and Aetius===
Conflict between Placidia and Bonifacius started in 429. Placidia appointed Bonifacius general of Libya. Procopius records that Aetius played the two against each other, warning Placidia against Bonifacius and advising her to recall him to Rome; simultaneously writing to Bonifacius, warning him that Placidia was about to summon him for no good reason in order to put him away.

Bonifacius, trusting the warning from Aetius, refused the summons; and, thinking his position untenable, sought an alliance with the Vandals in Spain. The Vandals subsequently crossed from Spain into Libya to join him. To friends of Bonifacius in Rome, this apparent act of hostility toward the Empire seemed entirely out of character for Bonifacius. They traveled to Carthage at Placidia&#x27;s behest to intercede with him, and he showed them the letter from Aetius. The plot now revealed, his friends returned to Rome to apprise Placidia of the true situation. She did not move against Aetius, as he wielded great influence, and as the Empire was already in danger; but she urged Bonifacius to return to Rome &quot;and not to permit the empire of the Romans to lie under the hand of barbarians.&quot;

Bonifacius now regretted his alliance with the Vandals and tried to persuade them to return to Spain. Gaiseric offered battle instead, and Bonifacius was besieged at Hippo Regius in Numidia by the sea (Augustine of Hippo was its bishop and died in this siege). Unable to take the city, the Vandals eventually raised the siege. The Romans, with reinforcements under Aspar, renewed the struggle but were routed and lost Africa to the Vandals.

Bonifacius had meanwhile returned to Rome, where Placidia raised him to the rank of patrician and made him &quot;master-general of the Roman armies&quot;. Aetius returned from Gaul with an army of &quot;barbarians&quot;, and was met by Bonifacius in the bloody Battle of Ravenna (432). Bonifacius won the battle, but was mortally wounded and died a few days later. Aetius was compelled to retire to Pannonia.

===Rise of Aetius===
With the generals loyal to her having either died or defected to Aetius, Placidia acknowledged Aetius&#x27; political role as legitimate. In 433, Aetius was given the titles &quot;magister militum&quot; and &quot;patrician&quot;. The appointments effectively left Aetius in control of the entire Western Roman army and gave him considerable influence over imperial policy. Aetius later played a pivotal role in the defense of the Western Empire against Attila. Placidia continued to act as regent until 437, though her direct influence over decisions was diminished. She would continue to exercise political influence until her death in 450—no longer, however, the only power at court.

During these years, Galla Placidia befriended bishop Peter Chrysologus, both having a shared interest in building churches. She also befriended a certain Barbatianus, whom she met in Rome. He came to Ravenna to be her confessor. According to his later biography, through his intercession she miraculously obtained a sandal of John the Evangelist for the church she had built to honour the saint. When Barbatianus died, Placidia and Chrysologus arranged his burial.

Attila was diverted from Constantinople towards Italy by a letter from Placidia&#x27;s own daughter Justa Grata Honoria in the spring of 450, asking him to rescue her from an unwanted marriage to a Roman senator that the Imperial family, including Placidia, was trying to force upon her. Honoria included her engagement ring with the letter. Though Honoria may not have intended a proposal of marriage, Attila chose to interpret her message as such. He accepted, asking for half of the western Empire as dowry. When Valentinian discovered the plan, only the influence of Placidia persuaded him not to kill Honoria. Valentinian wrote to Attila denying the legitimacy of the supposed marriage proposal. Attila, unconvinced, sent an emissary to Ravenna to proclaim that Honoria was innocent, that the proposal had been legitimate, and that he would come to claim what was rightfully his. Honoria was quickly married to Flavius Bassus Herculanus, though this did not prevent Attila from pressing his claim.

Placidia died shortly afterwards at Rome, in November 450, and was buried in the Theodosian family mausoleum adjacent to Old St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica, later the chapel of Saint Petronilla. She did not live to see Attila ravage Gaul and Italy in 451 and 452, using Honoria&#x27;s letter as his &quot;legitimate&quot; excuse.

==Public works==
Being a devout Christian, she was involved in the building and restoration of various churches throughout her period of influence. She restored and expanded the Basilica of Saint Paul Outside the Walls in Rome and the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem. She built San Giovanni Evangelista, Ravenna in thanks for the sparing of her life and those of her children in a storm while crossing the Adriatic Sea. The dedicatory inscription reads &quot;Galla Placidia, along with her son Placidus Valentinian Augustus and her daughter Justa Grata Honoria Augusta, paid off their vow for their liberation from the danger of the sea.&quot;

Her Mausoleum in Ravenna was one of the UNESCO World Heritage Sites inscribed in 1996. However, the building never served as her tomb, but was initially erected as a chapel dedicated to Lawrence of Rome. It is unknown whether the sarcophagi therein contained the bodies of other members of the Theodosian dynasty, or when they were placed in the building.

==In literature==
* Two stanzas in Alexander Blok&#x27;s poem &quot;Ravenna&quot; (May–June 1909) focus on her tomb; Olga Matich writes: &quot;For Blok, Galla Placidia represented a synthetic historical figure that linked different cultural histories.&quot;
* Ezra Pound uses her tomb as an exemplar of the &quot;gold&quot; remaining from the past, for example in Canto XXI: &quot;Gold fades in the gloom,/ Under the blue-black roof, Placidia&#x27;s...&quot;
* Louis Zukofsky refers to it in his poem &quot;4 Other Countries&quot;, reproduced in &quot;A&quot; 17: &quot;The gold that shines/ in the dark/ of Galla Placidia,/ the gold in the// Round vault rug of stone/ that shows its pattern as well as the stars/ my love might want on her floor...&quot;
* Carl Jung refers to Galla Placidia in his autobiography &quot;Memories, Dreams, Reflections&quot;, (Chapter IX, Section &#x27;Ravenna and Rome&#x27;). He reports a vision of &quot;four great mosaic frescoes of incredible beauty&quot; he experienced in the Neonian Baptistery right after visiting Galla&#x27;s tomb at Ravenna. He had been, he says, &quot;personally affected by the figure of Galla Placidia&quot; and goes on to say: &quot;Her tomb seemed to me a final legacy through which I might reach her personality. Her fate and her whole being were vivid presences to me&quot;. Jung was later surprised to discover that the mosaics he and an acquaintance remembered had actually never existed.
* Galla Placidia is a major supporting character in R. A. Lafferty&#x27;s semi-historical work &quot;The Fall of Rome&quot;, which introduces her as &quot;the goblin child and sister of the two young emperors who, at the age of seventeen, and when all the rest of them were cowed, seized control of the Roman Senate and the City and represented the defiance in the last one hundred days of the world.&quot;

==In popular culture==
* Galla Placidia is represented in the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Ancient Rome: The Rise and Fall of an Empire&quot; by Natasha Barrero.
* Spanish musician Jaume Pahissa wrote the opera &quot;Galla Placídia&quot; in 1913.
* Galla Placidia is played by Colette Régis in the 1954 film &quot;Attila&quot;.
* Galla Placidia is played by Alice Krige in the 2001 American TV miniseries &quot;Attila&quot;.

<doc id="12837" wikidata="Q3908" url="?curid=12837" title="Galicia (Spain)">
<text>Galicia ( ; or ; ) is an autonomous community of Spain and historic nationality under Spanish law. Located in the northwest Iberian Peninsula, it includes the provinces of A Coruña, Lugo, Ourense, and Pontevedra.

Galicia is located in Atlantic Europe. It is bordered by Portugal to the south, the Spanish autonomous communities of Castile and León and Asturias to the east, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Cantabrian Sea to the north. It had a population of 2,701,743 in 2018 and a total area of . Galicia has over of coastline, including its offshore islands and islets, among them Cíes Islands, Ons, Sálvora, Cortegada Island, which together form the Atlantic Islands of Galicia National Park, and the largest and most populated, A Illa de Arousa.

The area now called Galicia was first inhabited by humans during the Middle Paleolithic period, and takes its name from the Gallaeci, the Celtic people living north of the Douro River during the last millennium BC. Galicia was incorporated into the Roman Empire at the end of the Cantabrian Wars in 19 BC, and was made a Roman province in the 3rd century AD. In 410, the Germanic Suebi established a kingdom with its capital in Braga; this kingdom was incorporated into that of the Visigoths in 585. In 711, the Islamic Umayyad Caliphate invaded the Iberian Peninsula conquering the Visigoth kingdom of Hispania by 718, but soon Galicia was incorporated into the Christian kingdom of Asturias by 740. During the Middle Ages, the kingdom of Galicia was occasionally ruled by its own kings, but most of the time it was leagued to the kingdom of Leon and later to that of Castile, while maintaining its own legal and customary practices and culture. From the 13th century on, the kings of Castile, as kings of Galicia, appointed an &quot;Adiantado-mór&quot;, whose attributions passed to the &quot;Governor and Captain General of the Kingdom of Galiza&quot; from the last years of the 15th century. The Governor also presided the &quot;Real Audiencia do Reino de Galicia&quot;, a royal tribunal and government body. From the 16th century, the representation and voice of the kingdom was held by an assembly of deputies and representatives of the cities of the kingdom, the &quot;Cortes&quot; or &quot;Junta of the Kingdom of Galicia.&quot; This institution was forcibly discontinued in 1833 when the kingdom was divided into four administrative provinces with no legal mutual links. During the 19th and 20th centuries, demand grew for self-government and for the recognition of the culture of Galicia. This resulted in the Statute of Autonomy of 1936, soon frustrated by Franco&#x27;s &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; and subsequent long dictatorship. After democracy was restored the legislature passed the Statute of Autonomy of 1981, approved in referendum and currently in force, providing Galicia with self-government.

The interior of Galicia is characterized by a hilly landscape; mountain ranges rise to in the east and south. The coastal areas are mostly an alternate series of rias and beaches. The climate of Galicia is usually temperate and rainy, with markedly drier summers; it is usually classified as Oceanic. Its topographic and climatic conditions have made animal husbandry and farming the primary source of Galicia&#x27;s wealth for most of its history, allowing for a relatively high density of population. Except shipbuilding and food processing, Galicia was based on a farming and fishing economy until after the mid-20th century, when it began to industrialize. In 2018, the nominal gross domestic product was €62.900 billion, with a nominal GDP per capita of €23,300. Galicia is characterised, unlike other Spanish regions, by the absence of a metropolis dominating the territory. Indeed, the urban network is made up of 7 main cities: the four provincial capitals A Coruña, Pontevedra, Ourense and Lugo, the political capital Santiago de Compostela and the industrial cities Vigo and Ferrol. The population is largely concentrated in two main areas: from Ferrol to A Coruña on the northern coast, and in the Rías Baixas region in the southwest, including the cities of Vigo, Pontevedra, and the interior city of Santiago de Compostela. There are smaller populations around the interior cities of Lugo and Ourense. The political capital is Santiago de Compostela, in the province of A Coruña. Vigo, in the province of Pontevedra, is the largest municipality and A Coruña the most populated city in Galicia. Two languages are official and widely used today in Galicia: the native Galician; and Spanish, usually called &quot;Castilian&quot;. While most Galicians are bilingual, a 2013 survey reported that 51% of the Galician population spoke Galician most often on a day-to-day basis, while 48% most often used Spanish.
==Toponymy==
The name &quot;Galicia&quot; derives from the Latin toponym Callaecia, later &quot;Gallaecia&quot;, related to the name of an ancient Celtic tribe that resided north of the Douro river, the Gallaeci or Callaeci in Latin, or (&quot;Kallaïkoí&quot;) in Greek. These &quot;Callaeci&quot; were the first tribe in the area to help the Lusitanians against the invading Romans. The Romans applied their name to all the other tribes in the northwest who spoke the same language and lived the same life.

The toponymy of the name has been studied since the 7th century by authors such as Isidore of Seville, who wrote that &quot;Galicians are called so, because of their fair skin, as the Gauls&quot;, relating the name to the Greek word for milk. (See the etymology of the word &quot;galaxy&quot;.) In the 21st century, some scholars (J.J. Moralejo, Carlos Búa) have derived the name of the ancient Callaeci either from Proto-Indo-European *kl(H)-no- &#x27;hill&#x27;, through a local relational suffix -aik-, also attested in Celtiberian, so meaning &#x27;the hill (people)&#x27;; or from Proto-Celtic *kallī- &#x27;forest&#x27;, so meaning &#x27;the forest (people)&#x27;. In any case, &quot;Galicia&quot;, being &quot;per se&quot; a derivation of the ethnic name &quot;Kallaikói&quot;, means &#x27;the land of the Galicians&#x27;.

Another recent proposal comes from linguist Francesco Benozzo after identifying the root &quot;gall-&quot; / &quot;kall-&quot; in a number of Celtic words with the meaning &quot;stone&quot; or &quot;rock&quot;, as follows: &quot;gall&quot; (old Irish), &quot;gal&quot; (Middle Welsh), &quot;gailleichan&quot; (Scottish Gaelic), &quot;kailhoù&quot; (Breton), &quot;galagh&quot; (Manx) and &quot;gall&quot; (Gaulish). Hence, Benozzo explains the ethnonym &quot;Callaeci&quot; as being &quot;the stone people&quot; or &quot;the people of the stone&quot; (&quot;those who work with stones&quot;), about the builders of the ancient megaliths and stone formations so common in Galicia.

The name evolved during the Middle Ages from &quot;Gallaecia&quot;, sometimes written &quot;Galletia&quot;, to &quot;Gallicia&quot;. In the 13th century, with the written emergence of the Galician language, &quot;Galiza&quot; became the most usual written form of the name of the country, being replaced during the 15th and 16th centuries by the current form, &quot;Galicia&quot;, which is also the spelling of the name in Spanish. The historical denomination &quot;Galiza&quot; became popular again during the end of the 19th and the first three-quarters of the 20th century and is still used with some frequency today. The Xunta de Galicia, the local devolved government, uses &quot;Galicia&quot;. The Royal Galician Academy, the institution responsible for regulating the Galician language, whilst recognizing &quot;Galiza&quot; as a legitimate current denomination, has stated that the only official name of the country is &quot;Galicia&quot;.

Due to Galicia&#x27;s history and culture with mythology, the land has been called &quot;Terra Meiga&quot; (land of the witches/witch(ing) land).

==History==
===Prehistory and antiquity===
The oldest attestation of human presence in Galicia has been found in the Eirós Cave, in the municipality of Triacastela, which has preserved animal remains and Neanderthal stone objects from the Middle Paleolithic. The earliest culture to have left significant architectural traces is the Megalithic culture, which expanded along the western European coasts during the Neolithic and Calcolithic eras. Thousands of Megalithic tumuli are distributed throughout the country, mostly along the coastal areas. Within each tumulus is a stone burial chamber known locally as &quot;anta&quot; (dolmen), frequently preceded by a corridor. Galicia was later influenced by the Bell Beaker culture. Its rich mineral deposits of tin and gold led to the development of Bronze Age metallurgy, and the commerce of bronze and gold items all along the Atlantic coast of Western Europe. A shared elite culture evolved in this region during the Atlantic Bronze Age.
Dating from the end of the Megalithic era, and up to the Bronze Age, numerous stone carvings (petroglyphs) are found in open air. They usually represent cup and ring marks, labyrinths, deer, Bronze Age weapons, and riding and hunting scenes. Large numbers of these stone carvings can be found in the Rías Baixas regions, at places such as Tourón and Campo Lameiro.
The Castro culture (&#x27;Culture of the Castles&#x27;) developed during the Iron Age, and flourished during the second half of the first millennium BC. It is usually considered a local evolution of the Atlantic Bronze Age, with later developments and influences overlapping into the Roman era. Geographically, it corresponds to the people the Romans called Gallaeci, which were composed of a large series of nations or tribes, among them the &quot;Artabri&quot;, &quot;Bracari&quot;, &quot;Limici&quot;, &quot;Celtici&quot;, &quot;Albiones&quot; and &quot;Lemavi&quot;. They were capable fighters: Strabo described them as the most difficult foes the Romans encountered in conquering Lusitania, while Appian mentions their warlike spirit, noting that the women bore their weapons side by side with their men, frequently preferring death to captivity. According to Pomponius Mela all the inhabitants of the coastal areas were Celtic people.
Gallaeci lived in &quot;castros&quot;. These were usually annular forts, with one or more concentric earthen or stony walls, with a trench in front of each one. They were frequently located on hills, or in seashore cliffs and peninsulas. Some well known &quot;castros&quot; can be found on the seashore at: Fazouro, Santa Tegra, Baroña, and O Neixón; and inland at: San Cibrao de Lás, Borneiro, Castromao, and Viladonga. Some other distinctive features, such as temples, baths, reservoirs, warrior statues, and decorative carvings have been found associated with this culture, together with rich gold and metalworking traditions.

The Roman legions first entered the area under Decimus Junius Brutus in 137–136 BC, but the country was only incorporated into the Roman Empire by the time of Augustus (29 BC – 19 BC). The Romans were interested in Galicia mainly for its mineral resources, most notably gold. Under Roman rule, most Galician hillforts began to be – sometimes forcibly – abandoned, and Gallaeci served frequently in the Roman army as auxiliary troops. Romans brought new technologies, new travel routes, new forms of organizing property, and a new language: Latin. The Roman Empire established its control over Galicia through camps (&quot;castra&quot;) as &quot;Aquis Querquennis&quot;, Ciadella camp or Lucus Augusti (Lugo), roads (&quot;viae&quot;) and monuments as the lighthouse known as &quot;Tower of Hercules&quot;, in Corunna, but the remoteness and lesser interest of the country since the 2nd century AD, when the gold mines stopped being productive, led to a lesser degree of &quot;Romanization&quot;. In the 3rd century, it was made a province, under the name Gallaecia, which included also northern Portugal, Asturias, and a large section of what today is known as Castile and León.

===Early Middle Ages===
In the early 5th century, the deep crisis suffered by the Roman Empire allowed different tribes of Central Europe (Suebi, Vandals and Alani) to cross the Rhine and penetrate the rule on 31 December 406. Its progress towards the Iberian Peninsula forced the Roman authorities to establish a treaty (&quot;foedus&quot;) by which the Suebi would settle peacefully and govern Galicia as imperial allies. So, from 409 Galicia was taken by the Suebi, forming the first medieval kingdom to be created in Europe, in 411, even before the fall of the Roman Empire, being also the first Germanic kingdom to mint coinage in Roman lands. During this period a Briton colony and bishopric (see Mailoc) was established in Northern Galicia (Britonia), probably as foederati and allies of the Suebi. In 585, the Visigothic King Leovigild invaded the Suebic kingdom of Galicia and defeated it, bringing it under Visigoth control.

Later the Muslims invaded Spain (711), but the Arabs and Moors never managed to have any real control over Galicia, which was later incorporated into the expanding Christian Kingdom of Asturias, usually known as Gallaecia or Galicia (&quot;Yillīqiya&quot; and &quot;Galīsiya&quot;) by Muslim chroniclers, as well as by many European contemporaries. This era consolidated Galicia as a Christian society which spoke a Romance language. During the next century Galician noblemen took northern Portugal, conquering Coimbra in 871, thus freeing what was considered the southernmost city of ancient Galicia.

===High and Low Middle Ages===
In the 9th century, the rise of the cult of the Apostle James in Santiago de Compostela gave Galicia particular symbolic importance among Christians, an importance it would hold throughout the &quot;Reconquista&quot;. As the Middle Ages went on, Santiago became a major pilgrim destination and the Way of Saint James (Camiño de Santiago) a major pilgrim road, a route for the propagation of Romanesque art and the words and music of the troubadors. During the 10th and 11th centuries, a period during which Galician nobility become related to the royal family, Galicia was at times headed by its own native kings, while Vikings (locally known as &quot;Leodemanes&quot; or &quot;Lordomanes&quot;) occasionally raided the coasts. The Towers of Catoira (Pontevedra) were built as a system of fortifications to prevent and stop the Viking raids on Santiago de Compostela.

In 1063, Ferdinand I of Castile divided his realm among his sons, and the Kingdom of Galicia was granted to Garcia II of Galicia. In 1072, it was forcibly annexed by Garcia&#x27;s brother Alfonso VI of León; from that time Galicia was united with the Kingdom of León under the same monarchs. In the 13th century Alfonso X of Castile standardized the Castilian language (i.e. Spanish) and made it the language of court and government. Nevertheless, in his Kingdom of Galicia the Galician language was the only language spoken, and the most used in government and legal uses, as well as in literature.
During the 14th and 15th centuries, the progressive distancing of the kings from Galician affairs left the kingdom in the hands of the local knights, counts, and bishops, who frequently fought each other to increase their fiefs, or simply to plunder the lands of others. At the same time, the deputies of the Kingdom in the &quot;Cortes&quot; stopped being called. The Kingdom of Galicia, slipping away from the control of the King, responded with a century of fiscal insubordination.
On the other hand, the lack of an effective royal justice system in the Kingdom led to the social conflict known as the &quot;Guerras Irmandiñas&quot; (&#x27;Wars of the brotherhoods&#x27;), when leagues of peasants and burghers, with the support of several knights, noblemen, and under legal protection offered by the remote king, toppled many of the castles of the Kingdom and briefly drove the noblemen into Portugal and Castile. Soon after, in the late 15th century, in the dynastic conflict between Isabella I of Castile and Joanna La Beltraneja, part of the Galician aristocracy supported Joanna. After Isabella&#x27;s victory, she initiated an administrative and political reform which the chronicler Jeronimo Zurita defined as &quot;doma del Reino de Galicia&quot;: &#x27;It was then when the taming of Galicia began, because not just the local lords and knights, but all the people of that nation were the ones against the others very bold and warlike&#x27;. These reforms, while establishing a local government and tribunal (the &quot;Real Audiencia del Reino de Galicia&quot;), and bringing the nobleman under submission, also brought most Galician monasteries and institutions under Castilian control, in what has been criticized as a process of centralisation. At the same time the kings began to call the &quot;Xunta&quot; or &quot;Cortes&quot; of the Kingdom of Galicia, an assembly of deputies or representatives of the cities of the Kingdom, to ask for monetary and military contributions. This assembly soon developed into the voice and legal representation of the Kingdom, and the depositary of its will and laws.

===Early Modern===
The modern period of the Kingdom of Galicia began with the defeat of some of the most powerful Galician lords, such as Pedro Álvarez de Sotomayor, called Pedro Madruga, and Rodrigo Henriquez Osorio, at the hands of the Castilian armies sent to Galicia between the years 1480 and 1486. Isabella I of Castile, considered a usurper by many Galician nobles, defeated all armed resistance and definitively established the royal power of the Castilian monarchy. Fearing a general revolt, the monarchs ordered the banishing of the rest of the great lords like Pedro de Bolaño, Diego de Andrade, or Lope Sánchez de Moscoso, among others.
The establishment of the Santa Hermandad in 1480, and the Real Audiencia del Reino de Galicia in 1500—a tribunal and executive body directed by the Governor-Captain General as a direct representative of the King—implied initially the submission of the Kingdom to the Crown, after a century of unrest and fiscal insubordination. As a result, from 1480 to 1520 the Kingdom of Galicia contributed more than 10% of the total earnings of the Crown of Castille, including the Americas, well over its economic relevance. Like the rest of Spain, the 16th century was marked by population growth up to 1580, when the simultaneous wars with the Netherlands, France, and England hampered Galicia&#x27;s Atlantic commerce, which consisted mostly in the exportation of sardines, wood, and some cattle and wine.

In the late years of the 15th century the written form of the Galician language began a slow decline as it was increasingly replaced by Spanish, which would culminate in the &quot;Séculos Escuros&quot; &quot;the Dark Centuries&quot; of the language, roughly from the 16th century through to the mid-18th century, when written Galician almost completely disappeared except for private or occasional uses but the spoken language remained the common language of the people in the villages and even the cities.
From that moment Galicia, which participated to a minor extent in the American expansion of the Spanish Empire, found itself at the center of the Atlantic wars fought by Spain against the French and the Protestant powers of England and the Netherlands, whose privateers attacked the coastal areas, but major assaults were not common as the coastline was difficult and the harbors easily defended. The most famous assaults were upon the city of Vigo by Sir Francis Drake in 1585 and 1589, and the siege of A Coruña in 1589 by the &quot;English Armada&quot;. Galicia also suffered occasional slave raids by Barbary pirates, but not as frequently as the Mediterranean coastal areas. The most famous Barbary attack was the bloody sack of the town of Cangas in 1617. At the time, the king&#x27;s petitions for money and troops became more frequent, due to the human and economic exhaustion of Castile; the Junta of the Kingdom of Galicia (the local &quot;Cortes&quot; or representative assembly) was initially receptive to these petitions, raising large sums, accepting the conscription of the men of the kingdom, and even commissioning a new naval squadron which was sustained with the incomes of the Kingdom.
After the rupture of the wars with Portugal and Catalonia, the &quot;Junta&quot; changed its attitude, this time due to the exhaustion of Galicia, now involved not just in naval or oversea operations, but also in an exhausting war with the Portuguese, war which produced thousands of casualties and refugees and was heavily disturbing to the local economy and commerce. So, in the second half of the 17th century the &quot;Junta&quot; frequently denied or considerably reduced the initial petitions of the monarch, and though the tension did not rise to the levels experienced in Portugal or Catalonia, there were frequent urban mutinies and some voices even asked for the secession of the Kingdom of Galicia.

===Late Modern and Contemporary===

During the Peninsular War the successful uprising of the local people against the new French authorities, together with the support of the British Army, limited the occupation to six months in 1808–1809. During the pre-war period the Supreme Council of the Kingdom of Galicia (&quot;Junta Suprema del Reino de Galicia&quot;), auto-proclaimed interim sovereign in 1808, was the sole government of the country and mobilized near 40,000 men against the invaders.

The 1833 territorial division of Spain put a formal end to the Kingdom of Galicia, unifying Spain into a single centralized monarchy. Instead of seven provinces and a regional administration, Galicia was reorganized into the current four provinces. Although it was recognized as a &quot;historical region&quot;, that status was strictly honorific. In reaction, nationalist and federalist movements arose.
The liberal General Miguel Solís Cuetos led a separatist coup attempt in 1846 against the authoritarian regime of Ramón María Narváez. Solís and his forces were defeated at the Battle of Cacheiras, 23 April 1846, and the survivors, including Solís himself, were shot. They have taken their place in Galician memory as the Martyrs of Carral or simply the Martyrs of Liberty.

Defeated on the military front, Galicians turned to culture. The &quot;Rexurdimento&quot; focused on the recovery of the Galician language as a vehicle of social and cultural expression. Among the writers associated with this movement are Rosalía de Castro, Manuel Murguía, Manuel Leiras Pulpeiro, and Eduardo Pondal.

In the early 20th century came another turn toward nationalist politics with &quot;Solidaridad Gallega&quot; (1907–1912) modeled on &quot;Solidaritat Catalana&quot; in Catalonia. Solidaridad Gallega failed, but in 1916 &quot;Irmandades da Fala&quot; (Brotherhood of the Language) developed first as a cultural association but soon as a full-blown nationalist movement. Vicente Risco and Ramón Otero Pedrayo were outstanding cultural figures of this movement, and the magazine &quot;Nós&quot; (&#x27;Us&#x27;), founded in 1920, its most notable cultural institution, Lois Peña Novo the outstanding political figure.

The Second Spanish Republic was declared in 1931. During the republic, the Partido Galeguista (PG) was the most important of a shifting collection of Galician nationalist parties. Following a referendum on a Galician Statute of Autonomy, Galicia was granted the status of an autonomous region.

Galicia was spared the worst of the fighting in that war: it was one of the areas where the initial coup attempt at the outset of the war was successful, and it remained in Nationalist hands (Franco&#x27;s army) throughout the war. While there were no pitched battles, there was repression and death: all political parties were abolished, as were all labor unions and Galician nationalist organizations as the &quot;Seminario de Estudos Galegos&quot;. Galicia&#x27;s statute of autonomy was annulled (as were those of Catalonia and the Basque provinces once those were conquered). According to Carlos Fernández Santander, at least 4,200 people were killed either extrajudicially or after summary trials, among them republicans, communists, Galician nationalists, socialists, and anarchists. Victims included the civil governors of all four Galician provinces; Juana Capdevielle, the wife of the governor of A Coruña; mayors such as Ánxel Casal of Santiago de Compostela, of the Partido Galeguista; prominent socialists such as Jaime Quintanilla in Ferrol and Emilio Martínez Garrido in Vigo; Popular Front deputies Antonio Bilbatúa, José Miñones, Díaz Villamil, Ignacio Seoane, and former deputy Heraclio Botana); soldiers who had not joined the rebellion, such as Generals Rogelio Caridad Pita and Enrique Salcedo Molinuevo and Admiral Antonio Azarola; and the founders of the PG, Alexandre Bóveda and Víctor Casas, as well as other professionals akin to republicans and nationalists, as the journalist Manuel Lustres Rivas or physician Luis Poza Pastrana. Many others were forced to escape into exile, or were victims of other reprisals and removed from their jobs and positions.
General Francisco Franco – himself a Galician from Ferrol – ruled as dictator from the civil war until he died in 1975. Franco&#x27;s centralizing regime suppressed any official use of the Galician language, including the use of Galician names for newborns, although its everyday oral use was not forbidden. Among the attempts at resistance were small leftist guerrilla groups such as those led by José Castro Veiga (&quot;O Piloto&quot;) and Benigno Andrade (&quot;Foucellas&quot;), both of whom were ultimately captured and executed. In the 1960s, ministers such as Manuel Fraga Iribarne introduced some reforms allowing technocrats affiliated with Opus Dei to modernize administration in a way that facilitated capitalist economic development. However, for decades Galicia was largely confined to the role of a supplier of raw materials and energy to the rest of Spain, causing environmental havoc and leading to a wave of migration to Venezuela and to various parts of Europe. Fenosa, the monopolistic supplier of electricity, built hydroelectric dams, flooding many Galician river valleys.

The Galician economy finally began to modernize with a French Citroën factory in Vigo, the modernization of the canning industry and the fishing fleet, and eventually a modernization of small peasant farming practices, especially in the production of cows&#x27; milk. In the province of Ourense, businessman and politician Eulogio Gómez Franqueira gave impetus to the raising of livestock and poultry by establishing the Cooperativa Orensana S.A. (Coren).

During the last decade of Franco&#x27;s rule, there was a renewal of nationalist feeling in Galicia. The early 1970s were a time of unrest among university students, workers, and farmers. In 1972, general strikes in Vigo and Ferrol cost the lives of Amador Rey and Daniel Niebla. Later, the bishop of Mondoñedo-Ferrol, Miguel Anxo Araúxo Iglesias, wrote a pastoral letter that was not well received by the Franco regime, about a demonstration in Bazán (Ferrol) where two workers died.

As part of the transition to democracy upon the death of Franco in 1975, Galicia regained its status as an autonomous region within Spain with the Statute of Autonomy of 1981, which begins, &quot;Galicia, historical nationality, is constituted as an Autonomous Community to access to its self-government, in agreement with the Spanish Constitution and with the present Statute (…)&quot;. Varying degrees of nationalist or independentist sentiment are evident at the political level. The &quot;Bloque Nacionalista Galego&quot; or BNG, is a conglomerate of left-wing parties and individuals that claims Galician political status as a nation.
From 1990 to 2005, Manuel Fraga, former minister and ambassador in the Franco dictatorship, presided over the Galician autonomous government, the Xunta de Galicia. Fraga was associated with the &quot;Partido Popular&quot; (&#x27;People&#x27;s Party&#x27;, Spain&#x27;s main national conservative party) since its founding. In 2002, when the oil tanker Prestige sank and covered the Galician coast in oil, Fraga was accused by the grassroots movement &quot;Nunca Mais&quot; (&quot;Never again&quot;) of having been unwilling to react. In the 2005 Galician elections, the &#x27;People&#x27;s Party&#x27; lost its absolute majority, though remaining (barely) the largest party in the parliament, with 43% of the total votes. As a result, power passed to a coalition of the &quot;Partido dos Socialistas de Galicia&quot; (PSdeG) (&#x27;Galician Socialists&#x27; Party&#x27;), a federal sister-party of Spain&#x27;s main social-democratic party, the &quot;Partido Socialista Obrero Español&quot; (PSOE, &#x27;Spanish Socialist Workers Party&#x27;) and the nationalist &quot;Bloque Nacionalista Galego&quot; (BNG). As the senior partner in the new coalition, the PSdeG nominated its leader, Emilio Pérez Touriño, to serve as Galicia&#x27;s new president, with Anxo Quintana, the leader of BNG, as its vice president.

In 2009, the PSdG-BNG coalition lost the elections, and the government went back to the People&#x27;s Party (conservative), even though the PSdG-BNG coalition obtained the most votes.

==Geography==
Galicia has a surface area of . Its northernmost point, at 43°47′N, is Estaca de Bares (also the northernmost point of Spain); its southernmost, at 41°49′N, is on the Portuguese border in the Baixa Limia-Serra do Xurés Natural Park. The easternmost longitude is at 6°42′W on the border between the province of Ourense and the Castilian-Leonese province of Zamora) its westernmost at 9°18′W reached in two places: the A Nave Cape in Fisterra (also known as Finisterre), and Cape Touriñán, both in the province of A Coruña.

===Topography===

The interior of Galicia is a hilly landscape, composed of relatively low mountain ranges, usually below high, without sharp peaks, rising to in the eastern mountains. There are many rivers, most (though not all) running down relatively gentle slopes in narrow river valleys, though at times their courses become far more rugged, as in the canyons of the Sil river, Galicia&#x27;s second most important river after the Miño.
Topographically, a remarkable feature of Galicia is the presence of many firth-like inlets along the coast, estuaries that were drowned with rising sea levels after the ice age. These are called &quot;rías&quot; and are divided into the smaller &quot;Rías Altas&quot; (&quot;High Rías&quot;), and the larger &quot;Rías Baixas&quot; (&quot;Low Rías&quot;). The &quot;Rías Altas&quot; include Ribadeo, Foz, Viveiro, O Barqueiro, Ortigueira, Cedeira, Ferrol, Betanzos, A Coruña, Corme e Laxe and Camariñas. The Rías Baixas, found south of Fisterra, include Corcubión, Muros e Noia, Arousa, Pontevedra and Vigo. The Rías Altas can sometimes refer only to those east of Estaca de Bares, with the others being called &quot;Rías Medias&quot; (&quot;Intermediate Rías&quot;).

Erosion by the Atlantic Ocean has contributed to the great number of capes. Besides the aforementioned Estaca de Bares in the far north, separating the Atlantic Ocean from the Cantabrian Sea, other notable capes are Cape Ortegal, Cape Prior, Punta Santo Adrao, Cape Vilán, Cape Touriñán (westernmost point in Galicia), Cape Finisterre or Fisterra, considered by the Romans, along with Finistère in Brittany and Land&#x27;s End in Cornwall, to be the end of the known world.
All along the Galician coast are various archipelagos near the mouths of the &quot;rías&quot;. These archipelagos provide protected deepwater harbors and also provide habitat for seagoing birds. A 2007 inventory estimates that the Galician coast has 316 archipelagos, islets, and freestanding rocks. Among the most important of these are the archipelagos of Cíes, Ons, and Sálvora. Together with Cortegada Island, these make up the Atlantic Islands of Galicia National Park. Other significant islands are Islas Malveiras, Islas Sisargas, and, the largest and holding the largest population, Arousa Island.

The coast of this &#x27;green corner&#x27; of the Iberian Peninsula, some in length, attracts great numbers of tourists, although real estate development in the 2000–2010 decade has degraded it partially.
Galicia is quite mountainous, a fact which has contributed to isolate the rural areas, hampering communications, most notably in the inland. The main mountain range is the Macizo Galaico (Serra do Eixe, Serra da Lastra, Serra do Courel), also known as &quot;Macizo Galaico-Leonés&quot;, located in the eastern parts, bordering with Castile and León. Noteworthy mountain ranges are O Xistral (northern Lugo), the Serra dos Ancares (on the border with León and Asturias), O Courel (on the border with León), O Eixe (the border between Ourense and Zamora), Serra de Queixa (in the center of Ourense province), O Faro (the border between Lugo and Pontevedra), Cova da Serpe (border of Lugo and A Coruña), Montemaior (A Coruña), Montes do Testeiro, Serra do Suído, and Faro de Avión (between Pontevedra and Ourense); and, to the south, A Peneda, O Xurés and O Larouco, all on the border of Ourense and Portugal.

The highest point in Galicia is Trevinca or Pena Trevinca (), located in the Serra do Eixe, at the border between Ourense and León and Zamora provinces. Other tall peaks are Pena Survia () in the Serra do Eixe, O Mustallar () in Os Ancares, and Cabeza de Manzaneda () in Serra de Queixa, where there is a ski resort.

===Hydrography===

Galicia is poetically known as the &quot;country of the thousand rivers&quot; (&quot;o país dos mil ríos&quot;). The largest and most important of these rivers is the Miño, poetically known as &quot;O Pai Miño&quot; (Father Miño), which is long and discharges per second, with its affluent the Sil, which has created a spectacular canyon. Most of the rivers in the inland are tributaries of this river system, which drains some . Other rivers run directly into the Atlantic Ocean or the Cantabrian Sea, most of them having short courses. Only the Navia, Ulla, Tambre, and Limia have courses longer than .

Galicia&#x27;s many hydroelectric dams take advantage of the steep, deep, narrow rivers and their canyons. Due to their steep course, few of Galicia&#x27;s rivers are navigable, other than the lower portion of the Miño and the portions of various rivers that have been dammed into reservoirs. Some rivers are navigable by small boats in their lower reaches: this is taken great advantage of in several semi-aquatic festivals and pilgrimages.

===Environment===

Galicia has preserved some of its dense forests. It is relatively unpolluted, and its landscapes composed of green hills, cliffs, and &quot;rias&quot; are generally different from what is commonly understood as Spanish landscape. Nevertheless, Galicia has some important environmental problems.

Deforestation and forest fires are a problem in many areas, as is the continual spread of the eucalyptus tree, a species imported from Australia, actively promoted by the paper industry since the mid-20th century. Galicia is one of the more forested areas of Spain, but the majority of Galicia&#x27;s plantations, usually growing eucalyptus or pine, lack any formal management. Massive eucalyptus plantation, especially of &quot;Eucalyptus globulus&quot;, began in the Francisco Franco era, largely on behalf of the paper company Empresa Nacional de Celulosas de España (ENCE) in Pontevedra, which wanted it for its pulp. Galician photographer Delmi Álvarez began documenting the fires in Galicia in 2006 in a project called &quot;Queiman Galiza (Burn Galicia)&quot;. Wood products figure significantly in Galicia&#x27;s economy. Apart from tree plantations, Galicia is also notable for the extensive surface occupied by meadows used for animal husbandry, especially cattle, an important activity. Hydroelectric development in most rivers has been a serious concern for local conservationists during the last decades.

Fauna, most notably the European wolf, has suffered because of the actions of livestock owners and farmers, and because of the loss of habitats, whilst the native deer species have declined because of hunting and development.

Oil spills are a major issue. The Prestige oil spill in 2002 spilled more oil than the Exxon Valdez in Alaska.

===Biodiversity===
Galicia has more than 2,800 plant species and 31 endemic plant taxa. Plantations and mixed forests of eucalyptus predominate in the west and north; a few oak forests (variously known locally as &quot;fragas&quot; or &quot;devesas&quot;) remain, particularly in the north-central part of the province of Lugo and the north of the province of A Coruña (Fragas do Eume). In the interior regions of the country, oak and bushland predominate.
Galicia has 262 inventoried species of vertebrates, including 12 species of freshwater fish, 15 amphibians, 24 reptiles, 152 birds, and 59 mammals.
The animals most often thought of as being &quot;typical&quot; of Galicia are the livestock raised there. The Galician horse is native to the region, as is the Galician Blond cow and the domestic fowl known as the &quot;galiña de Mos&quot;. The last is an endangered species, although it is showing signs of a comeback since 2001.

Galicia is home to one of the largest populations of wolves in western Europe. Galicia&#x27;s woodlands and mountains are also home to rabbits, hares, wild boars, and roe deer, all of which are popular with hunters. Several important bird migration routes pass through Galicia, and some of the community&#x27;s relatively few environmentally protected areas are Special Protection Areas (such as on the Ría de Ribadeo) for these birds. From a domestic point of view, Galicia has been credited by the author Manuel Rivas as the &quot;land of one million cows&quot;. Galician Blond and Holstein cattle coexist on meadows and farms.

==Climate==
Being located on the Atlantic coastline, Galicia has a very mild climate for the latitude and the marine influence affects most of the province to various degrees. In comparison to similar latitudes on the other side of the Atlantic, winters are exceptionally mild, with consistent rainfall. At sea level snow is exceptional, with temperatures just occasionally dropping below freezing; on the other hand, snow regularly falls in the eastern mountains from November to May. Overall, the climate of Galicia is comparable to the Pacific Northwest; the warmest coastal station of Pontevedra has a yearly mean temperature of . Ourense located somewhat inland is only slightly warmer with . Lugo, to the north, is colder, with , similar to the of Portland, Oregon.

In coastal areas summers are tempered, with daily maximums averaging around in Vigo. Temperatures are further cooler in A Coruña, with a subdued normal. Temperatures are much higher in inland areas such as Ourense, where days above are regular.
The lands of Galicia are ascribed to two different areas in the Köppen climate classification: a south area (roughly, the province of Ourense and Pontevedra) with appreciable summer drought, classified as a warm-summer Mediterranean climate (&quot;Csb&quot;), with mild temperatures and rainfall usual throughout the year; and the western and northern coastal regions, the provinces of Lugo and A Coruña, which are characterized by their Oceanic climate (&quot;Cfb&quot;), with a more uniform precipitation distribution along the year, and milder summers. However, precipitation in southern coastal areas are often classified as oceanic since the averages remain significantly higher than a typical Mediterranean climate.

As an example, Santiago de Compostela, the capital city, has an average of 129 rainy days (&gt; 1 mm) and per year (with just 17 rainy days in the three summer months) and 2,101 sunlight hours per year, with just 6 days with frosts per year. But the colder city of Lugo, to the east, has an average of 1,759 sunlight hours per year, 117 days with precipitations (&gt; 1 mm) totalling , and 40 days with frosts per year. The more mountainous parts of the provinces of Ourense and Lugo receive significant snowfall during the winter months. The sunniest city is Pontevedra with 2,223 sunny hours per year.

==Government and politics==

===Local government===
Galicia has partial self-governance, in the form of a devolved government, established on 16 March 1978 and reinforced by the Galician Statute of Autonomy, ratified on 28 April 1981. There are three branches of government: the executive branch, the Xunta de Galicia, consisting of the President and the other independently elected councillors; the legislative branch consisting of the Galician Parliament; and the judicial branch consisting of the High Court of Galicia and lower courts.

====Executive====
The Xunta de Galicia is a collective entity with executive and administrative power. It consists of the President, a vice president, and twelve councillors. Administrative power is largely delegated to dependent bodies. The Xunta also coordinates the activities of the provincial councils () located in A Coruña, Pontevedra, Ourense and Lugo.

The President of the Xunta directs and coordinates the actions of the Xunta. The president is simultaneously the representative of the autonomous community and of the Spanish state in Galicia. The president is a member of the parliament and is elected by its deputies and then formally named by the monarch of Spain.

====Legislative====
The Galician Parliament consists of 75 deputies elected by universal adult suffrage under a system of proportional representation. The franchise includes also Galicians who reside abroad. Elections occur every four years.

The last elections, held 12 July 2020, resulted in the following distribution of seats:
* Partido Popular de Galicia (PPdeG): 42 deputies (47.96% of popular vote)
* Bloque Nacionalista Galego (BNG): 19 deputies (23.79% of popular vote)
* Partido Socialista de Galicia (PSdeG-PSOE): 14 deputies (19.39% of popular vote)

====Judicial====
===Municipal governments===
There are 314 municipalities () in Galicia, each of which is run by a mayor–council government known as a .

There is a further subdivision of local government known as an ; each has its own council () and mayor (). There are nine of these in Galicia: Arcos da Condesa, Bembrive, Camposancos, Chenlo, Morgadáns, Pazos de Reis, Queimadelos, Vilasobroso and Berán.

Galicia is also traditionally subdivided in some 3,700 civil parishes, each one comprising one or more &quot;vilas&quot; (towns), &quot;aldeas&quot; (villages), &quot;lugares&quot; (hamlets) or &quot;barrios&quot; (neighbourhoods).

===National government===
Galicia&#x27;s interests are represented at the national level by 25 elected deputies in the Congress of Deputies and 19 senators in the Senate – of these, 16 are elected and 3 are appointed by the Galician parliament.

===Administrative divisions===
Before the 1833 territorial division of Spain, Galicia was divided into seven administrative provinces:

* A Coruña
* Santiago
* Betanzos
* Mondoñedo
* Lugo
* Ourense
* Tui

From 1833, the seven original provinces of the 15th century were consolidated into four:

* A Coruña, capital: A Coruña
* Pontevedra, capital: Pontevedra
* Ourense; capital: Ourense
* Lugo; capital: Lugo

Galicia is further divided into 53 &quot;comarcas&quot;, 315 municipalities (93 in A Coruña, 67 in Lugo, 92 in Ourense, 62 in Pontevedra) and 3,778 parishes. Municipalities are divided into parishes, which may be further divided into &quot;aldeas&quot; (&quot;hamlets&quot;) or &quot;lugares&quot; (&quot;places&quot;). This traditional breakdown into such small areas is unusual when compared to the rest of Spain. Roughly half of the named population entities of Spain are in Galicia, which occupies only 5.8 percent of the country&#x27;s area. It is estimated that Galicia has over a million named places, over 40,000 of them being communities.

==Economy==
Textiles, fishing, livestock, forestry, and car manufacturing are the most dynamic sectors of the Galician economy.

The companies based in the province of Coruña generate 70% of the entrepreneurial output of Galicia. Arteixo, an industrial municipality in the A Coruña metropolitan area, is the headquarters of Inditex, the world&#x27;s largest fashion retailer. Of their eight brands, Zara is the best-known; indeed, it is the best-known Spanish brand of any sort on an international basis. In 2022, Inditex reported €32.6 billion in sales and net income of €4.1 billion. The company president, Amancio Ortega, is the richest person in Spain and indeed Europe with a net worth of 45 billion euros.

A major economic sector of Galicia is its fishing Industry; the main ports are A Coruña, Marín-Pontevedra, Vigo and Ferrol. Related to this fact, the European Fisheries Control Agency, which coordinates fishing controls in European Union waters, is based in Vigo.

Galicia is a land of economic contrast. While the western coast, with its major population centers and its fishing and manufacturing industries, is prosperous and increasing in population, the rural hinterland—the provinces of Ourense and Lugo—is economically dependent on traditional agriculture, based on small landholdings called &quot;minifundios&quot;. However, the rise of tourism, sustainable forestry, and organic and traditional agriculture are bringing other possibilities to the Galician economy without compromising the preservation of the natural resources and the local culture.
Traditionally, Galicia depended mainly on agriculture and fishing. Nonetheless, today the tertiary sector of the economy (the service sector) is the largest, with 582,000 workers out of a regional total of 1,072,000 (as of 2002).

The secondary sector (manufacturing) includes shipbuilding in Vigo, Marín-Pontevedra and Ferrol, textiles and granite work in A Coruña. A Coruña also manufactures automobiles. The French &quot;Centro de Vigo de PSA Peugeot Citroën&quot;, founded in 1958, makes about 450,000 vehicles annually (455,430 in 2006); a Citroën C4 Picasso made in 2007 was their nine-millionth vehicle.

Other companies with a large number of workers and a significant turnover are San José, based in Pontevedra, belonging to the construction sector, and Gadisa and Vego, based in A Coruña and Froiz, based in Pontevedra, linked to the retail sector.

Galicia is home to the savings bank, and to Spain&#x27;s two oldest commercial banks Banco Etcheverría (the oldest) and Banco Pastor, owned since 2011 by Banco Popular Español.

Galicia was late to catch the tourism boom that has swept Spain in recent decades, but the coastal regions (especially the Rías Baixas and Santiago de Compostela) are now significant tourist destinations and are especially popular with visitors from other regions in Spain, where the majority of tourists come from. In 2007, 5.7 million tourists visited Galicia, an 8% growth over the previous year, and part of a continual pattern of growth in this sector. 85% of tourists who visit Galicia visit Santiago de Compostela. Tourism constitutes 12% of Galician GDP and employs about 12% of the regional workforce.

The Gross domestic product (GDP) of the autonomous community was 62.6 billion euros in 2018, accounting for 5.2% of Spanish economic output. GDP per capita adjusted for purchasing power was 24,900 euros or 82% of the EU27 average in the same year. The GDP per employee was 95% of the EU average.

The unemployment rate stood at 15.7% in 2017 and was lower than the national average.
===Transportation===

Galicia&#x27;s main airport is Santiago de Compostela Airport. Having been used by 2,083,873 passengers in 2014, it connects the Galician capital with cities in Spain as well as several major European cities. There are two other domestic airports in Galicia: A Coruña Airport – Alvedro and Vigo-Peinador Airport.

The most important Galician fishing port is the Port of Vigo; It is one of the European&#x27;s leading fishing ports, with an annual catch worth 1,500 million euros. In 2007 the port took in of fish and seafood, and about of other cargoes. Other important ports are A Coruña, Marín-Pontevedra, Ferrol and the smaller port of Vilagarcía de Arousa, as well as important recreational ports in Pontevedra capital city and Burela. Beyond these, Galicia has 120 other organized ports.
 includes &quot;autopistas&quot; and &quot;autovías&quot; connecting the major cities, as well as national and secondary roads to the rest of the municipalities. The Autovía A-6 connects A Coruña and Lugo to Madrid, entering Galicia at Pedrafita do Cebreiro. The Autovía A-52 connects O Porriño, Ourense and Benavente, and enters Galicia at A Gudiña. Two more autovías are under construction. Autovía A-8 enters Galicia on the Cantabrian coast, and ends in Baamonde (Lugo province). Autovía A-76 enters Galicia in Valdeorras; it is an upgrade of the existing N-120 to Ourense.

Within Galicia are the Autopista AP-9 from Ferrol to Portugal and the Autopista AP-53 (also known as AG-53, because it was initially built by the Xunta de Galicia) from Santiago to Ourense. Additional roads under construction include Autovía A-54 from Santiago de Compostela to Lugo, the Autovía A-57 that will pass through Pontevedra and Autovía A-56 from Lugo to Ourense. The Xunta de Galicia has built roads connecting comarcal capitals, such as the before mentioned AG-53, Autovía AG-55 connecting A Coruña to Carballo or AG-41 connecting Pontevedra to Sanxenxo.
The first railway line in Galicia was inaugurated on 15 September 1873. It ran from O Carril, Vilagarcía da Arousa to Cornes, Conxo, Santiago de Compostela. A second line was inaugurated in 1875, connecting A Coruña and Lugo. In 1883, Galicia was first connected by rail to the rest of Spain, by way of O Barco de Valdeorras. Galicia today has roughly of rail lines. Several lines operated by Adif and Renfe Operadora connect all the important Galician cities. A line operated by FEVE connects Ferrol to Ribadeo and Oviedo. An old electrified line is the Ponferrada-Monforte de Lemos-Ourense-Vigo line. Several high-speed rail lines are under construction. Among these are the Olmedo-Zamora-Galicia high-speed rail line that opened partly in 2011, and the AVE Atlantic Axis route, which will connect all of the major Galician Atlantic coast cities A Coruña, Santiago de Compostela, Pontevedra and Vigo to Portugal.

==Demographics==

===Population===
Galicia&#x27;s inhabitants are known as Galicians (, ). For well over a century Galicia has grown more slowly than the rest of Spain, largely due to a poorer economy compared with other regions of Spain and emigration to Latin America and other parts of Spain. Sometimes, Galicia has lost population in absolute terms. In 1857, Galicia had Spain&#x27;s densest population and constituted 11.5% of the national population. , only 6.1% of the Spanish population resided in the autonomous community. This is due to an exodus of Galician people since the 19th century, first to South America and later to Central Europe and the development of population centers and industry in other parts of Spain.

According to the 2006 census, Galicia has a fertility rate of 1.03 children per woman, compared to 1.38 nationally, and far below the figure of 2.1 that represents a stable populace. Lugo and Ourense provinces have the lowest fertility rates in Spain, 0.88 and 0.93, respectively.

In northern Galicia, the A Coruña-Ferrol metropolitan area has become increasingly dominant in terms of population. The population of the city of A Coruña in 1900 was 43,971. The population of the rest of the province, including the City and Naval Station of nearby Ferrol and Santiago de Compostela, was 653,556. A Coruña&#x27;s growth occurred after the Spanish Civil War at the same speed as other major Galician cities, but since the revival of democracy after the death of Francisco Franco, A Coruña has grown at a faster rate than all the other Galician cities.

During the mid-20th century, the population rapidly increased in A Coruña, Vigo, and to a lesser degree, other major Galician cities, such as Ourense, Pontevedra or Santiago de Compostela as the rural population declined after the Spanish Civil War: many villages and hamlets of the four provinces of Galicia disappeared or nearly disappeared during the same period. Economic development and mechanization of agriculture resulted in the fields being abandoned, and most of the population moved to find jobs in the main cities. The number of people working in the tertiary and quaternary sectors of the economy increased significantly.

Since 1999, the absolute number of births in Galicia has been increasing. In 2006, 21,392 births were registered in Galicia, 300 more than in 2005, according to the Instituto Galego de Estatística. Since 1981, the Galician life expectancy has increased by five years, thanks to a higher quality of life.

* Birth rate (2006): 7.9 per 1,000 (all of Spain: 11.0 per 1,000)
* Death rate (2006): 10.8 per 1,000 (all of Spain: 8.4 per 1,000)
* Life expectancy at birth (2005): 80.4 years (all of Spain: 80.2 years)
** Male: 76.8 years (all of Spain: 77.0 years)
** Female: 84.0 years (all of Spain: 83.5 years)

Roman Catholicism is, by far, the largest religion in Galicia. In 2012, the proportion of Galicians that identify themselves as Roman Catholic was 82.2%.

As a Celtic region of Spain, Galicia has a tartan called Galicia National.

===Urbanization===

The principal cities are the four capitals A Coruña, Pontevedra, Ourense and Lugo, Santiago de Compostela – the political capital and archiepiscopal seat – and the industrial cities Vigo and Ferrol.

The largest conurbations are:
* Pontevedra-Vigo 660,000
* A Coruña-Ferrol 640,000


===Migration===
Like many rural areas of Western Europe, Galicia&#x27;s history has been defined by mass emigration. Significant internal migration took place from Galicia in the late 19th and early 20th centuries to the industrialized Spanish cities of Barcelona, Bilbao, Zaragoza and Madrid. Other Galicians emigrated to Latin America – Argentina, Uruguay, Venezuela, Mexico, Brazil and Cuba in particular.

The two cities with the greatest number of people of Galician descent outside Galicia are Buenos Aires, Argentina, and nearby Montevideo, Uruguay. Immigration from Galicia was so significant in these areas that Argentines and Uruguayans now commonly refer to all Spaniards as &quot;gallegos&quot; (Galicians).

During the Franco years, there was a new wave of emigration out of Galicia to other European countries, most notably to France, Germany, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. Many of these immigrant or expatriate communities have their groups or clubs, which they formed in the first decades of settling in a new place. The Galician diaspora is so widespread that websites such as Fillos de Galicia have been created in the 21st century to organize and form a network of ethnic Galicians throughout the world.

After this, a third wave was a Spanish internal emigration to heavier industrialised areas of Spain, like the Basque Country or Catalonia.

The proportion of foreign-born people in Galicia is only 2.9 percent compared to the national figure of 10 percent; among the autonomous communities, only Extremadura has a lower percentage of immigrants. Of the foreign nationals resident in Galicia, 17.93 percent are the ethnically related Portuguese, 10.93 percent are Colombian and 8.74 percent Brazilian.

===Language===

Galicia has two official languages: Galician (Galician: &quot;galego&quot;) and Spanish (also known in Spain as &quot;Castellano&quot;, i.e. &quot;Castilian&quot;), both of them Romance languages. The former (Galician) originated regionally; the latter (Castilian) was associated with Castile. Galician is recognized in the Statute of Autonomy of Galicia as the &quot;lingua propia&quot; (&quot;own language&quot;) of Galicia.

Galician and Portuguese share a common medieval phase known as Galician-Portuguese. The independence of Portugal since the late Middle Ages has favored the divergence of the Galician and Portuguese languages as they developed. Though considered to be independent languages in Galicia, the shared history between Galician and Portuguese has been widely acknowledged; in 2014, the Galician parliament approved Law 1/2014 on the promotion of Portuguese and links with the Lusophony.

The official Galician language has been standardized by the based on literary tradition. Although there are local dialects, Galician media conform to this standard form, which is also used in primary, secondary, and university education. There are more than three million Galician speakers in the world. Galician ranks in the lower orders of the 150 most widely spoken languages on earth.

For more than four centuries of Castilian domination, Spanish was the only official language in Galicia. Galician faded from day-to-day use in urban areas. Since the re-establishment of democracy in Spain—in particular since the passage and implementation of the &quot;Lei de Normalización Lingüística&quot; (&quot;Law of Linguistic Normalization&quot;, Ley 3/1983, 15 June 1983)—the first generation of students in mass education has attended schools conducted in Galician. (Spanish is also taught.)

Since the late 20th century and the establishment of Galicia&#x27;s autonomy, the Galician language is resurgent. In the cities, it is generally used as a second language for most. According to a 2001 census, 99.16 percent of the population of Galicia understood the language, 91.04 percent spoke it, 68.65 percent could read it and 57.64 percent could write it. The first two numbers (understanding and speaking) were roughly the same as responses a decade earlier. But there were great gains in the percentage of the population who could read and write Galician: a decade earlier, only 49.3 percent of the population could read Galician, and 34.85 percent could write it. During the Franco era, the teaching of Galician was prohibited. Today older people may speak the language but have no written competence because of those years. Among the regional languages of Spain, Galician has the highest percentage of speakers in its population. However, the acts of Popular Party in the Autonomous Community in the last decade, forbide the possibility of teaching in Galician at schools such a vehicular language and use it in the learning of some subjects, increasingly the monolinguism and the language substitution of Galician.

The earliest known document in Galician-Portuguese dates from 1228. The &quot;Foro do bo burgo do Castro Caldelas&quot; was granted by Alfonso IX of León to the town of Burgo, in Castro Caldelas, after the model of the constitutions of the town of Allariz. A distinct Galician literature emerged during the Middle Ages: In the 13th century important contributions were made to the Romance canon in Galician-Portuguese, the most notable those by the troubadour Martín Codax, the priest Airas Nunes, King Denis of Portugal, and King Alfonso X of Castile, &quot;Alfonso O Sabio&quot; (&quot;Alfonso the Wise&quot;), the same monarch who began the process of standardization of the Spanish language. During this period, Galician-Portuguese was considered the language of love poetry in the Iberian Romance linguistic culture. The names and memories of Codax and other popular cultural figures are well preserved in modern Galicia.

===Religion===
Christianity is the most widely practised religion in Galicia. It was introduced in Late Antiquity and was practiced alongside the native Celtic religion for a few centuries which, incidentally, was re-established as an officially recognised religion in 2015. Still, today about 77.7% of Galicians identify as Catholic. Most Christians adhere to Catholicism, though only 32.1% of the population described themselves as active members.

The Catholic Church in Galicia has had its primatial see in Santiago de Compostela since the 12th century. In fact, since the Middle Ages, the Galician Catholic Church has been organized into five dioceses: the Metropolitan see Santiago de Compostela, and four suffragan dioceses: Lugo, Ourense, Mondoñedo-Ferrol and Tui-Vigo. While in the 15th-century diocesan boundaries may have coincided with those of the civil province, this is no longer the case. The five dioceses of Galicia are subdivided into a total of 163 districts and 3,792 parishes. In a minority of cases, the parish priest is represented by an administrator.

The patron saint of Galicia is Saint James the Greater. According to Catholic tradition, his body was discovered in 814 near Compostela. After that date, the relics of Saint James attracted an extraordinary number of pilgrims. Since the 9th century these relics have been kept in the heart of the church – the modern-day cathedral – dedicated to him. There are many other Galician and associated saints; some of the best-known are: Saint Ansurius, Saint Rudesind, Saint Mariña of Augas Santas, Saint Senorina, Trahamunda and Froilan.

===Education===
Galicia&#x27;s education system is administered by the regional government&#x27;s Ministry of Education and University Administration. 76% of Galician teenagers achieve a high school degree – ranked fifth out of the 17 autonomous communities.

There are three public universities in Galicia: University of A Coruña with campuses in A Coruña and Ferrol, University of Santiago de Compostela with campuses in Santiago de Compostela and Lugo and the University of Vigo with campuses in Pontevedra, Ourense and Vigo.

===Health care===

Galicia&#x27;s public healthcare system is the (SERGAS). It is administered by the regional government&#x27;s Ministry of Health.

==Culture==
===Architecture and Art===

Hundreds of ancient standing stone monuments like dolmens, menhirs, and megalithic tumuli were erected during the prehistoric period in Galicia. Amongst the best-known are the dolmens of Dombate, Corveira, Axeitos of Pedra da Arca, and menhirs like the Lapa de Gargantáns. From the Iron Age, Galicia has a rich heritage based mainly on a great number of hill forts, few of them excavated like Baroña, Sta. Tegra, San Cibrao de Lás and Formigueiros among others. With the introduction of Ancient Roman architecture, there was a development of basilicas, castra, city walls, cities, villas, Roman temples, Roman roads, and the Roman bridge of Ponte Vella. It was the Romans who founded some of the first cities in Galicia like Lugo and Ourense. Perhaps the best-known examples are the Roman Walls of Lugo and the Tower of Hercules in A Coruña.

During the Middle Ages, many fortified castles were built by Galician feudal nobles to mark their powers against their rivals. Although most of them were demolished during the Irmandiño Wars (1466–1469), some Galician castles that survived are Pambre, Castro Caldelas, Sobroso, Soutomaior and Monterrei. The ecclesiastical architecture was raised early in Galicia, and the first churches and monasteries as San Pedro de Rocas began to be built in the 5th and 6th centuries. However, the most famous medieval architecture in Galicia had been using Romanesque architecture like most of Western Europe. Some of the greatest examples of Romanesque churches in Galicia are the Cathedral of Santiago de Compostela, the Ourense Cathedral, Saint John of Caaveiro, Our Lady Mary of Cambre, and the Church of San Xoán of Portomarín among others.
In the art of Galicia, the stone has a strong imprint, especially the granite, which served as a support from the prehistoric petroglyphs figures to the development of medieval art in the Galician Romanesque sculptures from Portico of Glory by Master Mateo, in Santiago de Compostela Cathedral. Medieval splendor was followed, as in literature, by a few centuries of darkness (the &quot;Séculos escuros&quot;) until the arrival of the Compostela Baroque. In painting, the romanticism and impressionist-influenced landscapes of the 20th century were materialized by a generation of artists who died young, so they were called the &quot;Xeración Doente&quot; (Sick Generation). In the 20th century, the renovation came in the 20s by &quot;Os renovadores&quot;, and by the &quot;Atlántica&quot; group after the dictatorship.

===Cuisine===
Galician cuisine often uses fish and shellfish. The &quot;empanada&quot; is a meat or fish pie, with a bread-like base, top, and crust with the meat or fish filling usually being in a tomato sauce including onions and garlic. &quot;Caldo galego&quot; is a hearty soup whose main ingredients are potatoes and a local vegetable named grelo (broccoli rabe). The latter is also employed in &quot;lacón con grelos&quot;, a typical carnival dish, consisting of pork shoulder boiled with &quot;grelos&quot;, potatoes, and chorizo. &quot;Centolla&quot; is the equivalent of king crab. It is prepared by being boiled alive, having its main body opened like a shell, and then having its innards mixed vigorously. Another popular dish is octopus, boiled (traditionally in a copper pot) and served on a wooden plate, cut into small pieces, and laced with olive oil, sea salt, and &quot;pimentón&quot; (Spanish paprika). This dish is called &quot;pulpo a la gallega&quot; or in Galician &quot;polbo á feira&quot;, which roughly translates as &#x27;fair-style octopus&#x27;, most commonly translated as &#x27;Galician-style octopus&#x27;. There are several regional varieties of cheese. The best-known one is the so-called &quot;tetilla&quot;, named after its breast-like shape. Other highly regarded varieties include the San Simón cheese from Vilalba and the creamy cheese produced in the Arzúa-Ulloa area. A classical is &quot;filloas&quot;, crêpe-like pancakes made with flour, broth or milk, and eggs. When cooked at a pig slaughter festival, they may also contain the animal&#x27;s blood. A famous almond cake called &quot;Tarta de Santiago&quot; (St. James&#x27; cake) is a Galician sweet specialty mainly produced in Santiago de Compostela and all around Galicia.
Galicia has 30 products with &quot;Denominación de orixe&quot; (D.O.), some of them with &quot;Denominación de Orixe Protexida&quot; (D.O.P.). D.O. and D.O.P. are part of a system of regulation of quality and geographical origin among Spain&#x27;s finest producers. Galicia produces a number of high-quality Galician wines, including Albariño, Ribeiro, Ribeira Sacra, Monterrei and Valdeorras. The grape varieties used are local and rarely found outside Galicia and Northern Portugal. Just as notably from Galicia comes the spirit &quot;Augardente&quot;—the name means burning water—often referred to as Orujo in Spain and internationally or as caña in Galicia. This spirit is made from the distillation of the pomace of grapes.

===Literature, poetry and philosophy===
As with many other Romance languages, Galician-Portuguese emerged as a literary language in the Middle Ages, during the 12th and 13th centuries, when a rich lyric tradition developed, followed by a minor prose tradition, whilst being the predominant language used for legal and private texts till the 15th century. However, in the face of the hegemony of Spanish, during the so-called &quot;Séculos Escuros&quot; (&quot;Dark Centuries&quot;) from 1530 to the late 18th century, it fell from major literary or legal written use.
As a literary language it was revived again during the 18th and, most notably, the 19th-century (&quot;Rexurdimento&quot; &quot;Resurgence&quot;) with such writers as Rosalía de Castro, Manuel Murguía, Manuel Leiras Pulpeiro, and Eduardo Pondal. In the 20th century, before the Spanish Civil War the &quot;Irmandades da Fala&quot; (&quot;Brotherhood of the Language&quot;) and &quot;Grupo Nós&quot; included such writers as Vicente Risco, Ramón Cabanillas and Castelao. Public use of Galician was largely suppressed during the Franco dictatorship but has been resurgent since the restoration of democracy. Though written primarily in Castilian, several works by the Nobel laureate Camilo José Cela, notably &quot;Mazurka for Two Dead Men&quot;, are set in the author&#x27;s native Galicia and make frequent allusions to Galician folklore, customs, and language. Other notable Galician authors who wrote mostly in Spanish, but always around Galician subjects, are Valle-Inclán, Wenceslao Fernández Flórez, Emilia Pardo Bazán and Gonzalo Torrente Ballester. Contemporary writers in Galician include Xosé Luís Méndez Ferrín, Manuel Rivas, Chus Pato, and Suso de Toro.

====Festivals====

* &quot;Entroido&quot;, or Carnival, is a traditional celebration in Galicia, historically disliked and even forbidden by the Catholic Church. Famous celebrations are held in Laza, Verín, and Xinzo de Limia.
* Festa do Corpus Christi in Ponteareas, has been observed since 1857 on the weekend following Corpus Christi (a movable feast) and is known for its floral carpets. It was declared a Festival of Tourist Interest in 1968 and a Festival of National Tourist Interest in 1980.
* Feira Franca, the first weekend of September, in Pontevedra recreates an open market that first occurred in 1467. The fair commemorates the height of Pontevedra&#x27;s prosperity in the 15th and 16th centuries, through historical recreation, theater, animation, and demonstration of artistic activities. Held annually since 2000.
* Arde Lucus, in June, celebrates the Celtic and Roman history of the city of Lugo, with recreations of Celtic weddings, Roman circus, etc.
* Bonfires of Saint John, &quot;Noite de San Xoán&quot; or &quot;Noite da Queima&quot; is widely spread in all Galician territory, celebrated as a welcome to the summer solstice since the Celtic period, and Christianized in Saint John&#x27;s day eve. Bonfires are believed to make &quot;meigas&quot; (malicious or fallen witches), flee. They are particularly relevant in the city of Corunna, where it became Fiesta of National Tourist Interest of Spain. The whole city participates in making great bonfires in each district, whereas the centre of the party is located on the beaches of Riazor and Orzan, in the very city heart, where hundreds of bonfires of different sizes are lighted. Also, grilled sardines are very typical.
* Rapa das Bestas (&quot;shearing of the beasts&quot;) in Sabucedo, the first weekend in July, is the most famous of several &quot;rapas&quot; in Galicia and was declared a Festival of National Tourist Interest in 1963. Wild colts are driven down from the mountains and brought to a closed area known as a &quot;curro&quot;, where their manes are cut and the animals are marked and assisted after a long winter in the hills. In Sabucedo, unlike in other &quot;rapas&quot;, the &quot;aloitadores&quot; (&quot;fighters&quot;) each take on their task with no assistance.
* Festival de Ortigueira (Ortigueira&#x27;s Festival of Celtic World) lasts four days in July, in Ortigueira. First celebrated in 1978–1987 and revived in 1995, the festival is based on Celtic culture, folk music, and the encounter of different peoples throughout Spain and the world. Attended by over 100,000 people, it is considered a Festival of National Tourist Interest.
* Festa da Dorna, 24 July, in Ribeira. Founded in 1948, declared a Galician Festival of Tourist Interest in 2005.

* Romería Vikinga de Catoira (&quot;Viking Festival of Catoira&quot;), the first Sunday in August, is a secular festival that has occurred since 1960 and was declared a Festival of International Tourist Interest in 2002. It commemorates the historic defense of Galicia and the treasures of Santiago de Compostela from Norman and Saracen pirate attacks.
* Festas da Peregrina in Pontevedra, 2nd week of August, celebrating the Pilgrim Virgin of Pontevedra. There is a bullfighting festival at the same time. Pontevedra is the only city where there is a permanent bullring.

* Festa de San Froilán, 4–12 October, celebrating the patron saint of the city of Lugo. A Festival of National Tourist Interest, the festival was attended by 1,035,000 people in 2008. It is most famous for the booths serving &quot;polbo á feira&quot;, an octopus dish.
* Festa do marisco (Seafood Festival), October, in O Grove. Established in 1963; declared a Festival of National Tourist Interest in the 1980s.

In 2015 only five &quot;corridas&quot; took place within Galicia.
In addition, recent studies have stated that 92% of Galicians are firmly against bullfighting, the highest rate in Spain. Despite this, popular associations, such as &quot;Galicia Mellor Sen Touradas&quot; (&quot;Galicia Better without Bullfights&quot;), have blamed politicians for having no compromise to abolish it and have been very critical of local councils&#x27;, especially those governed by the PP and PSOE, payment of subsidies for corridas. The province government of Pontevedra stopped the end of these subsidies and declared the province &quot;free of bullfights&quot;. The province government of A Coruña approved a document supporting the abolition of these events.

Radio Galega began broadcasting on 24 February 1985, with regular programming starting on 29 March 1985. There are two regular broadcast channels: Radio Galega and Radio Galega Música. In addition, there is a DTT and internet channel, Son Galicia Radio, dedicated specifically to Galician music.

Galicia has several free and community radio stations. Cuac FM is the headquarters of the Community Media Network (which brings together media non-profit oriented and serves their community). CUAC FM (A Coruña), Radio Filispim (Ferrol), Radio Roncudo (corme), Kalimera Radio (Santiago de Compostela), Radio Piratona (Vigo) and Radio Clavi (Lugo) are part of the Galician Network of Free and Association of Community Radio Broadcasters(ReGaRLiC)

==Sport==
Galicia has a long sporting tradition dating back to the early 20th century when the majority of sports clubs in Spain were founded. The most popular and well-supported teams in the region are Deportivo de La Coruña and Celta Vigo. When the two sides play, it is referred to as the Galician derby. Deportivo was champion of La Liga in the 1999–2000 season.

Pontevedra CF from Pontevedra and Racing Ferrol from Ferrol are two other notable clubs from Galicia as well as CD Lugo and SD Compostela. The Galician Football Federation periodically fields a national team against international opposition.

Football aside, the most popular team sports in Galicia are futsal, handball and basketball. In basketball, Obradoiro CAB is the most successful team of note, and currently, the only Galician team that plays in the Liga ACB; other teams are CB Breogan, Club Ourense Baloncesto and OAR Ferrol. In the sport of handball, Club Balonmán Cangas plays in the top-flight (Liga ASOBAL). The sport is particularly popular in the province of Pontevedra with the three other Galician teams in the top two divisions: SD Teucro (Pontevedra), Octavio Pilotes Posada (Vigo) and SD Chapela (Redondela).

In roller hockey HC Liceo is the most successful Galician team, in any sport, with numerous European and World titles. In futsal teams, Lobelle Santiago and Azkar Lugo.

Galicia is also known for its tradition of participation in water sports both at sea and in rivers; these include rowing, yachting, canoeing and surfing. Its athletes have regularly won medals in the Olympics; currently, the most notable examples are David Cal, Carlos Pérez Rial, and Fernando Echavarri.

Galician triathlon contenders Francisco Javier Gómez Noya and Iván Raña have been world champions. In 2006 the cyclist Oscar Pereiro won the Tour de France after the disqualification of American Floyd Landis, gaining the top position on the penultimate day of the race. Galicians are also prominent athletes in the sport of mountaineering—Chus Lago is the third woman to reach the summit of Everest without supplemental oxygen.

In 2022, the cycling race O Gran Camiño was held for the first time and was won by the Spanish legend Alejandro Valverde. In subsequent years, it rose to fame as the scene of the season debut of two times Tour de France winner Jonas Vingegaard who won the race in both 2023 and 2024.

===Emerging sports===
Since 2011, several Gaelic football teams have been set up in Galicia. The first was Fillos de Breogán (A Coruña), followed Artabros (Oleiros), Irmandinhos (A Estrada), SDG Corvos (Pontevedra), and Suebia (Santiago de Compostela) with talk of creating a Galician league. Galicia also fielded a Gaelic football side (recognised as national by the GAA) that beat Brittany in July 2012 and was reported in the Spanish nationwide press.

Rugby is growing in popularity, although the success of local teams is hampered by the absence of experienced ex-pat players from English-speaking countries typically seen at teams based on the Mediterranean coast or in the big cities. Galicia has a long-established Rugby Federation that organises its own women&#x27;s, children&#x27;s, and men&#x27;s leagues. Galicia has also fielded a national side for friendly matches against other regions of Spain and Portugal. A team of ex-pat Galicians in Salvador, Brazil have also formed Galicia Rugby, a sister team of the local football club.

==Symbols==

A golden chalice enclosed in a field of azure has been the symbol of Galicia since the 13th century. Originated as a Canting arms due to the phonetic similarity between the words &quot;chalice&quot; and &quot;Galyce&quot; (&quot;Galicia&quot; in old Norman language), the first documented mention of this emblem is on the &quot;Segar&#x27;s Roll&quot;, an English medieval roll of arms where are represented all the Christian kingdoms of 13th-century Europe. In the following centuries, the Galician emblem varied; diverse shapes and several numbers of chalices (initially three and later one or five) were used. It would not be until the 16th century that its number was fixed as one single chalice. Centuries after, a field of crosses was slowly added to the azure background, and latterly also a silver host. Since then, the emblem of the kingdom would be kept until now.

The ancient flag of the Kingdom of Galicia was based mainly on its coat of arms until the 19th century. However, when in 1833 the government of Spain abolished the kingdom and divided it into four provinces, the Galician emblem, as well as the flag, lost its legal status and international validity. It would not be until the late 19th century that some Galician intellectuals (nationalist politicians and writers) began to use a new flag as a symbol of renewed national unity for Galicia. That flag, which was composed of a diagonal stripe over a white background, was designated the &quot;official flag of Galicia&quot; in 1984, after the fall of Franco&#x27;s dictatorship. In addition, the Royal Academy of Galicia asked the Galician government to incorporate the ancient coat of arms of the kingdom onto the modern flag, being present in it since then.

In addition to its coat of arms and flag, Galicia also has its own anthem. While it is true that the Kingdom of Galicia had an unofficial anthem known as the &quot;Solemn March of the kingdom&quot; for centuries, the current Galician anthem was not created until 1907, although its composition had begun already in 1880. Titled &quot;Os Pinos&quot; (&quot;The Pines&quot;), the Galician anthem&#x27;s lyrics were written by Eduardo Pondal, one of the greatest modern Galician poets, and its music was composed by Pascual Veiga. Performed for the first time in 1907 in Havana (Cuba) by Galician emigrants, the anthem was banned from 1927 by various Spanish governments until 1977 when it was officially established by the Galician authorities.

<text>G proteins, also known as guanine nucleotide-binding proteins, are a family of proteins that act as molecular switches inside cells, and are involved in transmitting signals from a variety of stimuli outside a cell to its interior. Their activity is regulated by factors that control their ability to bind to and hydrolyze guanosine triphosphate (GTP) to guanosine diphosphate (GDP). When they are bound to GTP, they are &#x27;on&#x27;, and, when they are bound to GDP, they are &#x27;off&#x27;. G proteins belong to the larger group of enzymes called GTPases.

There are two classes of G proteins. The first function as monomeric small GTPases (small G-proteins), while the second function as heterotrimeric G protein complexes. The latter class of complexes is made up of &quot;alpha&quot; (Gα), &quot;beta&quot; (Gβ) and &quot;gamma&quot; (Gγ) subunits. In addition, the beta and gamma subunits can form a stable dimeric complex referred to as the beta-gamma complex

Heterotrimeric G proteins located within the cell are activated by G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) that span the cell membrane. Signaling molecules bind to a domain of the GPCR located outside the cell, and an intracellular GPCR domain then in turn activates a particular G protein. Some active-state GPCRs have also been shown to be &quot;pre-coupled&quot; with G proteins, whereas in other cases a collision coupling mechanism is thought to occur. The G protein triggers a cascade of further signaling events that finally results in a change in cell function. G protein-coupled receptors and G proteins working together transmit signals from many hormones, neurotransmitters, and other signaling factors. G proteins regulate metabolic enzymes, ion channels, transporter proteins, and other parts of the cell machinery, controlling transcription, motility, contractility, and secretion, which in turn regulate diverse systemic functions such as embryonic development, learning and memory, and homeostasis.

== History ==
G proteins were discovered in 1980 when Alfred G. Gilman and Martin Rodbell investigated stimulation of cells by adrenaline. They found that when adrenaline binds to a receptor, the receptor does not stimulate enzymes (inside the cell) directly. Instead, the receptor stimulates a G protein, which then stimulates an enzyme. An example is adenylate cyclase, which produces the second messenger cyclic AMP. For this discovery, they won the 1994 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine.

Nobel prizes have been awarded for many aspects of signaling by G proteins and GPCRs. These include receptor antagonists, neurotransmitters, neurotransmitter reuptake, G protein-coupled receptors, G proteins, second messengers, the enzymes that trigger protein phosphorylation in response to cAMP, and consequent metabolic processes such as glycogenolysis.

Prominent examples include (in chronological order of awarding):

* The 1947 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine to Carl Cori, Gerty Cori and Bernardo Houssay, for their discovery of how glycogen is broken down to glucose and resynthesized in the body, for use as a store and source of energy. Glycogenolysis is stimulated by numerous hormones and neurotransmitters including adrenaline.
* The 1970 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine to Julius Axelrod, Bernard Katz and Ulf von Euler for their work on the release and reuptake of neurotransmitters.
* The 1971 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine to Earl Sutherland for discovering the key role of adenylate cyclase, which produces the second messenger cyclic AMP.
* The 1988 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine to George H. Hitchings, Sir James Black and Gertrude Elion &quot;for their discoveries of important principles for drug treatment&quot; targeting GPCRs.
* The 1992 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine to Edwin G. Krebs and Edmond H. Fischer for describing how reversible phosphorylation works as a switch to activate proteins, and to regulate various cellular processes including glycogenolysis.
* The 1994 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine to Alfred G. Gilman and Martin Rodbell for their discovery of &quot;G-proteins and the role of these proteins in signal transduction in cells&quot;.
* The 2000 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine to Eric Kandel, Arvid Carlsson and Paul Greengard, for research on neurotransmitters such as dopamine, which act via GPCRs.
* The 2004 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine to Richard Axel and Linda B. Buck for their work on G protein-coupled olfactory receptors.
* The 2012 Nobel Prize in Chemistry to Brian Kobilka and Robert Lefkowitz for their work on GPCR function.

== Function ==
G proteins are important signal transducing molecules in cells. &quot;Malfunction of GPCR [G Protein-Coupled Receptor] signaling pathways are involved in many diseases, such as diabetes, blindness, allergies, depression, cardiovascular defects, and certain forms of cancer. It is estimated that about 30% of the modern drugs&#x27; cellular targets are GPCRs.&quot; The human genome encodes roughly 800 G protein-coupled receptors, which detect photons of light, hormones, growth factors, drugs, and other endogenous ligands. Approximately 150 of the GPCRs found in the human genome still have unknown functions.

Whereas G proteins are activated by G protein-coupled receptors, they are inactivated by RGS proteins (for &quot;Regulator of G protein signalling&quot;). Receptors stimulate GTP binding (turning the G protein on). RGS proteins stimulate GTP hydrolysis (creating GDP, thus turning the G protein off).

== Diversity ==

All eukaryotes use G proteins for signaling and have evolved a large diversity of G proteins. For instance, humans encode 18 different Gα proteins, 5 Gβ proteins, and 12 Gγ proteins.

== Signaling ==
G protein can refer to two distinct families of proteins. Heterotrimeric G proteins, sometimes referred to as the &quot;large&quot; G proteins, are activated by G protein-coupled receptors and are made up of alpha (α), beta (β), and gamma (γ) subunits. &quot;&quot;Small&quot; G proteins&quot; (20-25kDa) belong to the Ras superfamily of small GTPases. These proteins are homologous to the alpha (α) subunit found in heterotrimers, but are in fact monomeric, consisting of only a single unit. However, like their larger relatives, they also bind GTP and GDP and are involved in signal transduction.

=== Heterotrimeric ===

Different types of heterotrimeric G proteins share a common mechanism. They are activated in response to a conformational change in the GPCR, exchanging GDP for GTP, and dissociating in order to activate other proteins in a particular signal transduction pathway. The specific mechanisms, however, differ between protein types.

===Mechanism===

Receptor-activated G proteins are bound to the inner surface of the cell membrane. They consist of the Gα and the tightly associated Gβγ subunits. 
There are four main families of Gα subunits: Gαs (G stimulatory), Gαi (G inhibitory), Gαq/11, and Gα12/13. They behave differently in the recognition of the effector molecule, but share a similar mechanism of activation.

==== Activation ====
When a ligand activates the G protein-coupled receptor, it induces a conformational change in the receptor that allows the receptor to function as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) that exchanges GDP for GTP. The GTP (or GDP) is bound to the Gα subunit in the traditional view of heterotrimeric GPCR activation. This exchange triggers the dissociation of the Gα subunit (which is bound to GTP) from the Gβγ dimer and the receptor as a whole. However, models which suggest molecular rearrangement, reorganization, and pre-complexing of effector molecules are beginning to be accepted. Both Gα-GTP and Gβγ can then activate different &quot;signaling cascades&quot; (or &quot;second messenger pathways&quot;) and effector proteins, while the receptor is able to activate the next G protein.

==== Termination ====
The Gα subunit will eventually hydrolyze the attached GTP to GDP by its inherent enzymatic activity, allowing it to re-associate with Gβγ and starting a new cycle. A group of proteins called Regulator of G protein signalling (RGSs), act as GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs), are specific for Gα subunits. These proteins accelerate the hydrolysis of GTP to GDP, thus terminating the transduced signal. In some cases, the effector &quot;itself&quot; may possess intrinsic GAP activity, which then can help deactivate the pathway. This is true in the case of phospholipase C-beta, which possesses GAP activity within its C-terminal region. This is an alternate form of regulation for the Gα subunit. Such Gα GAPs do not have catalytic residues (specific amino acid sequences) to activate the Gα protein. They work instead by lowering the required activation energy for the reaction to take place.

====Specific mechanisms====

=====Gαs=====
Gαs activates the cAMP-dependent pathway by stimulating the production of cyclic AMP (cAMP) from ATP. This is accomplished by direct stimulation of the membrane-associated enzyme adenylate cyclase. cAMP can then act as a second messenger that goes on to interact with and activate protein kinase A (PKA). PKA can phosphorylate a myriad downstream targets.

The cAMP-dependent pathway is used as a signal transduction pathway for many hormones including:

* ADH – Promotes water retention by the kidneys (created by the magnocellular neurosecretory cells of the posterior pituitary)
* GHRH – Stimulates the synthesis and release of GH (somatotropic cells of the anterior pituitary)
* GHIH – Inhibits the synthesis and release of GH (somatotropic cells of anterior pituitary)
* CRH – Stimulates the synthesis and release of ACTH (anterior pituitary)
* ACTH – Stimulates the synthesis and release of cortisol (zona fasciculata of the adrenal cortex in the adrenal glands)
* TSH – Stimulates the synthesis and release of a majority of T4 (thyroid gland)
* LH – Stimulates follicular maturation and ovulation in women; or testosterone production and spermatogenesis in men
* FSH – Stimulates follicular development in women; or spermatogenesis in men
* PTH – Increases blood calcium levels. This is accomplished via the parathyroid hormone 1 receptor (PTH1) in the kidneys and bones, or via the parathyroid hormone 2 receptor (PTH2) in the central nervous system and brain, as well as the bones and kidneys.
* Calcitonin – Decreases blood calcium levels (via the calcitonin receptor in the intestines, bones, kidneys, and brain)
* Glucagon – Stimulates glycogen breakdown in the liver
* hCG – Promotes cellular differentiation, and is potentially involved in apoptosis.
* Epinephrine – released by the &quot;adrenal medulla&quot; during the fasting state, when body is under metabolic duress. It stimulates glycogenolysis, in addition to the actions of glucagon.

=====Gαi=====
Gαi inhibits the production of cAMP from ATP.
e.g. somatostatin, prostaglandins

=====Gαq/11=====
Gαq/11 stimulates the membrane-bound phospholipase C beta, which then cleaves phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) into two second messengers, inositol trisphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG). IP3 induces calcium release from the endoplasmic reticulum. DAG activates protein kinase C.
The Inositol Phospholipid Dependent Pathway is used as a signal transduction pathway for many hormones including:
* Epinephrine
* ADH (Vasopressin/AVP) – Induces the synthesis and release of glucocorticoids (Zona fasciculata of adrenal cortex); Induces vasoconstriction (V1 Cells of Posterior pituitary)
* TRH – Induces the synthesis and release of TSH (Anterior pituitary gland)
* TSH – Induces the synthesis and release of a small amount of T4 (Thyroid Gland)
* Angiotensin II – Induces Aldosterone synthesis and release (zona glomerulosa of adrenal cortex in kidney)
* GnRH – Induces the synthesis and release of FSH and LH (Anterior Pituitary)

=====Gα12/13=====
*Gα12/13 are involved in Rho family GTPase signaling (see Rho family of GTPases). This is through the RhoGEF superfamily involving the RhoGEF domain of the proteins&#x27; structures). These are involved in control of cell cytoskeleton remodeling, and thus in regulating cell migration.

=====Gβ, Gγ=====
*The Gβγ complexes sometimes also have active functions. Examples include coupling to and activating G protein-coupled inwardly-rectifying potassium channels.

===Small GTPases===
Small GTPases, also known as small G-proteins, bind GTP and GDP likewise, and are involved in signal transduction. These proteins are homologous to the alpha (α) subunit found in heterotrimers, but exist as monomers. They are small (20-kDa to 25-kDa) proteins that bind to guanosine triphosphate (GTP). This family of proteins is homologous to the Ras GTPases and is also called the Ras superfamily GTPases.

== Lipidation ==
In order to associate with the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane, many G proteins and small GTPases are lipidated, that is, covalently modified with lipid extensions. They may be myristoylated, palmitoylated or prenylated.

<text>Ernest Gary Gygax ( ; July 27, 1938 – March 4, 2008) was an American game designer and author best known for co-creating the pioneering tabletop role-playing game &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; (&quot;D&amp;D&quot;) with Dave Arneson.

In the 1960s, Gygax created an organization of wargaming clubs and founded the Gen Con tabletop game convention. In 1971, he co-developed &quot;Chainmail&quot;, a miniatures wargame based on medieval warfare with Jeff Perren. He co-founded the company (TSR) (originally Tactical Studies Rules) with childhood friend Don Kaye in 1973. The next year, TSR published &quot;D&amp;D&quot;, created by Gygax and Arneson the year before. In 1976, he founded &quot;The Dragon&quot;, a magazine based around the new game. In 1977, he began developing a more comprehensive version of the game called &quot;Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;. He designed numerous manuals for the game system, as well as several pre-packaged adventures called &quot;modules&quot; that gave a person running a &quot;D&amp;D&quot; game (the &quot;Dungeon Master&quot;) a rough script and ideas. In 1983, he worked to license the &quot;D&amp;D&quot; product line into the successful &quot;D&amp;D&quot; cartoon series.

Gygax left TSR in 1986 over conflicts with its new majority owner, but he continued to create role-playing game titles independently, beginning with the multi-genre &quot;Dangerous Journeys&quot; in 1992. He designed the &quot;Lejendary Adventure&quot; gaming system, released in 1999. In 2005, he was involved in the &quot;Castles &amp; Crusades&quot; role-playing game, which was conceived as a hybrid between the third edition of &quot;D&amp;D&quot; and the original version of the game.

In 2004, he had two strokes and narrowly avoided a subsequent heart attack; he was then diagnosed with an abdominal aortic aneurysm and died in March 2008 at age 69. Following Gygax&#x27;s funeral, many mourners formed an impromptu game event which became known as Gary Con 0, and gamers celebrate in Lake Geneva each March with a large role-playing game convention in Gygax&#x27;s honor.

== Early life and inspiration ==
Gygax was born in Chicago, the son of Almina Emelie &quot;Posey&quot; Burdick and Swiss immigrant and former Chicago Symphony Orchestra violinist Ernst Gygax. He was named Ernest after his father, but was commonly known as Gary, the middle name given to him by his mother after the actor Gary Cooper. The family lived on Kenmore Avenue, close enough to Wrigley Field that he could hear the roar of the crowds watching the Chicago Cubs play. At age 7, he became a member of a small group of friends who called themselves the &quot;Kenmore Pirates&quot;. In 1946, after the Kenmore Pirates were involved in a fracas with another gang of boys, his father decided to move the family to Posey&#x27;s family home in Lake Geneva, Wisconsin, where Posey&#x27;s family had settled in the early 19th century, and where Gary&#x27;s grandparents still lived.

In this new setting, Gygax soon made friends with several of his peers, including Don Kaye and Mary Jo Powell. During his childhood and teen years, he developed a love of games and an appreciation for fantasy and science fiction literature. When he was five, he played card games such as pinochle and then board games such as chess. At age ten, he and his friends played the sort of make-believe games that eventually came to be called &quot;live action role-playing games&quot;, with one of them acting as referee. His father introduced him to science fiction and fantasy through pulp novels. His interest in games, combined with an appreciation of history, eventually led Gygax to begin playing miniature war games in 1953 with his best friend, Don Kaye. As teenagers, Gygax and Kaye designed their own miniatures rules for toy soldiers with a large collection of and figures, where they used &quot;ladyfingers&quot; (small firecrackers) to simulate explosions.

By his teens, Gygax had a voracious appetite for pulp fiction authors such as Robert E. Howard, Jack Vance, Fritz Leiber, H. P. Lovecraft, and Edgar Rice Burroughs. He was a mediocre student, and in 1956, a few months after his father died, he dropped out of high school in his junior year. He joined the Marines, but after being diagnosed with walking pneumonia, he received a medical discharge and moved back home with his mother. From there, he commuted to a job as a shipping clerk with Kemper Insurance Co. in Chicago. Shortly after his return, a friend introduced him to Avalon Hill&#x27;s new wargame &quot;Gettysburg.&quot; Gygax was soon obsessed with the game, often playing marathon sessions once or more a week. It was also from Avalon Hill that he ordered the first blank hex mapping sheets available, which he then employed to design his own games.

About the same time that he discovered &quot;Gettysburg&quot;, his mother reintroduced him to Mary Jo Powell, who had left Lake Geneva as a child and just returned. Gygax was smitten with her and, after a short courtship, persuaded her to marry him, despite being only 19. This caused some friction with Kaye, who had also been wooing Mary Jo. Kaye refused to attend Gygax&#x27;s wedding. Kaye and Gygax reconciled after the wedding.

The couple moved to Chicago where Gygax continued as a shipping clerk at Kemper Insurance. He found a job for Mary Jo there, but the company laid her off when she became pregnant with their first child. He also took anthropology classes at the University of Chicago.

Despite his commitments to his job, raising a family, and attending college, Gygax continued to play wargames. It reached the point that Mary Jo, pregnant with their second child, believed he was having an affair and confronted him in a friend&#x27;s basement only to discover him and his friends sitting around a map-covered table.

In 1962, Gygax got a job as an insurance underwriter at Fireman&#x27;s Fund Insurance Co. His family continued to grow, and after his third child was born, he decided to move his family back to Lake Geneva. Except for a few months he spent in Clinton, Wisconsin, after his divorce, and his time in Hollywood while he was the head of TSR&#x27;s entertainment division, Lake Geneva was his home for the rest of his life.
By 1966, Gygax was active in the wargame hobby world and was writing many magazine articles on the subject. He learned about H. G. Wells&#x27;s &quot;Little Wars&quot; book for play of military miniatures wargames and Fletcher Pratt&#x27;s &quot;Naval Wargame&quot; book. Gygax later looked for innovative ways to generate random numbers, and used not only common six-sided dice, but dice of all five Platonic solid shapes, which he discovered in a school supply catalog.

Gygax cited as influences the fantasy and science fiction authors Robert E. Howard, L. Sprague de Camp, Jack Vance, Fletcher Pratt, Fritz Leiber, Poul Anderson, A. Merritt, and H. P. Lovecraft.

== Wargames ==
In 1967, Gygax co-founded the International Federation of Wargamers (IFW) with Bill Speer and Scott Duncan. The IFW grew rapidly, particularly by assimilating several preexisting wargaming clubs, and aimed to promote interest in wargames of all periods. It provided a forum for wargamers via its newsletters and societies, which enabled them to form local groups and share rules. In 1967, Gygax organized a 20-person gaming meet in the basement of his home; this event was later called &quot;Gen Con 0&quot;. In 1968, he rented Lake Geneva&#x27;s vine-covered Horticultural Hall for $50 () to hold the first Lake Geneva Convention, also known as the Gen Con gaming convention. Gen Con is now one of North America&#x27;s largest annual hobby-game gatherings. Gygax met Dave Arneson, the future co-creator of &quot;D&amp;D&quot;, at the second Gen Con in August 1969.

Together with Don Kaye, Mike Reese, and Leon Tucker, Gygax created a military miniatures society called Lake Geneva Tactical Studies Association (LGTSA) in 1970, with its first headquarters in Gygax&#x27;s basement. Shortly thereafter in 1970, Gygax and Robert Kuntz founded the Castle &amp; Crusade Society of the IFW.

In October 1970, Gygax lost his job at the insurance company after almost nine years. Unemployed and now with five children he tried to use his enthusiasm for games to make a living by designing board games for commercial sale. This proved unsustainable when he grossed only $882 in 1971 (). He began cobbling shoes in his basement, which provided him with a steady income and gave him more time for game development. In 1971, he began doing some editing work at Guidon Games, a publisher of wargames, for which he produced the board games &quot;Alexander the Great&quot; and &quot;&quot;. Early that same year, Gygax published &quot;Chainmail&quot;, a miniatures wargame that simulated medieval-era tactical combat, which he had originally written with hobby-shop owner Jeff Perren. The &quot;Chainmail&quot; medieval miniatures rules were originally published in the Castle &amp; Crusade Society&#x27;s fanzine &quot;The Domesday Book&quot;. Guidon Games hired Gygax to produce a game series called &quot;Wargaming with Miniatures&quot;, with the initial release for the series being a new edition of &quot;Chainmail&quot; (1971). The first edition of &quot;Chainmail&quot; included a fantasy supplement to the rules. These comprised a system for warriors, wizards, and various monsters of nonhuman races drawn from the works of J. R. R. Tolkien and other sources. For a small publisher like Guidon Games, &quot;Chainmail&quot; was relatively successful, selling 100 copies per month.

Gygax also collaborated on &quot;Tractics&quot; with Mike Reese and Leon Tucker, his contribution being the change to a 20-sided spinner or a coffee can with 20 numbered poker chips (eventually, 20-sided dice) to decide combat resolutions instead of the standard six-sided dice. He also collaborated with Arneson on the Napoleonic naval wargame &quot;Don&#x27;t Give Up the Ship!&quot;

Dave Arneson briefly adapted the &quot;Chainmail&quot; rules for his fantasy &quot;Blackmoor&quot; campaign. In the winter of 1972–1973, Arneson and friend David Megarry, inventor of the &quot;Dungeon!&quot; board game, traveled to Lake Geneva to showcase their respective games to Gygax, in his role as a representative of Guidon Games. Gygax saw potential in both games, and was especially excited by Arneson&#x27;s role-playing game. Gygax and Arneson immediately started to collaborate on creating &quot;The Fantasy Game&quot;, the role-playing game that evolved into &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;.

Following Arneson&#x27;s &quot;Blackmoor&quot; demonstration, Gygax requested more information from Arneson and began testing ideas for the game on his two oldest children, Ernie and Elise, in a setting he called &quot;Greyhawk&quot;. This group rapidly expanded to include Kaye, Kuntz, and eventually a large circle of players. Gygax and Arneson continued to trade notes about their respective campaigns as Gygax began work on a draft. Several aspects of the system governing magic in the game were inspired by fantasy author Jack Vance&#x27;s &quot;The Dying Earth&quot; stories (notably that &quot;magic-users&quot; in the game forget the spells that they have learned immediately upon casting them and must re-study them in order to cast them again), and the system as a whole drew upon the work of authors such as Robert E. Howard, L. Sprague de Camp, Michael Moorcock, Roger Zelazny, Poul Anderson, Tolkien, Bram Stoker, and others. The final draft contained changes not vetted by Arneson, and Gygax&#x27;s vision differed on some rule details Arneson had preferred.

Gygax asked Guidon Games to publish it, but the three-volume rule set in a labeled box was beyond the small publisher&#x27;s scope. Gygax pitched the game to Avalon Hill, but it did not understand the concept of role-playing and turned down his offer.

By 1974, Gygax&#x27;s Greyhawk group, which had started off with himself, Ernie Gygax, Don Kaye, Rob Kuntz, and Terry Kuntz, had grown to over 20 people, with Rob Kuntz operating as co-dungeon-master so that each of them could referee smaller groups of about a dozen players.

== TSR ==
Gygax left Guidon Games in 1973 and in October, with Don Kaye as a partner, founded Tactical Studies Rules. The two men each invested $1,000 in the venture—Kaye borrowed his share on his life insurance policy—to print a thousand copies of the &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; boxed set. They also tried to raise money by immediately publishing a set of wargame rules called &quot;Cavaliers and Roundheads&quot;, but sales were poor; when the printing costs for the thousand copies of &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; rose from $2,000 to $2,500, they still did not have enough capital to publish it. Worried that the other playtesters and wargamers now familiar with Gygax&#x27;s rules would bring a similar product to the market first, the two accepted an offer in December 1973 from gaming acquaintance Brian Blume to invest $2,000 in TSR to become an equal one-third partner. (Gygax accepted Blume&#x27;s offer right away. Kaye was less enthusiastic, and after a week to consider the offer, he questioned Blume closely before acquiescing.) Blume&#x27;s investment finally brought the financing that enabled them to publish &quot;D&amp;D&quot;. Gygax worked on rules for more miniatures and tabletop battle games including &quot;Classic Warfare&quot; (Ancient Period: 1500 BC to 500 AD) and &quot;Warriors of Mars&quot;.

TSR released the first commercial version of &quot;D&amp;D&quot; in January 1974 as a boxed set. Sales of the hand-assembled print run of 1,000 copies, put together in Gygax&#x27;s home, sold out in less than a year. (In 2018, a first printing of the boxed set sold at auction for more than $20,000.)

At the end of 1974, with sales of D&amp;D skyrocketing, the future looked bright for Gygax and Kaye, who were only 36. But in January 1975, Kaye unexpectedly died of a heart attack. He had not made any specific provision in his will regarding his share of the company, simply leaving his entire estate to his wife Donna. Although she had worked briefly for TSR as an accountant, she did not share her husband&#x27;s enthusiasm for gaming, and made clear that she would not have anything to do with managing the company. Gygax called her &quot;less than personable... After Don died she dumped all the Tactical Studies Rules materials off on my front porch. It would have been impossible to manage a business with her involved as a partner.&quot; Gygax relocated TSR from the Kaye dining room to the basement at his own house. In July 1975, Gygax and Blume reorganized their company from a partnership to a corporation called TSR Hobbies. Gygax owned 150 shares, Blume the other 100 shares, and both had the option to buy up to 700 shares at any time in the future. But TSR Hobbies had nothing to publish—D&amp;D was still owned by the three-way partnership of TSR, and neither Gygax nor Blume had the money to buy out Donna Kaye&#x27;s shares. Blume persuaded a reluctant Gygax to allow his father, Melvin Blume, to buy Donna&#x27;s shares, and those were converted to 200 shares in TSR Hobbies. In addition, Brian bought another 140 shares. These purchases reduced Gygax from majority shareholder in control of the company to minority shareholder; he effectively became the Blumes&#x27; employee.

Gygax wrote the supplements &quot;Greyhawk&quot;, &quot;Eldritch Wizardry&quot;, and &quot;Swords &amp; Spells&quot; for the original &quot;D&amp;D game&quot;. With Brian Blume, he also designed the wild west-oriented role-playing game &quot;Boot Hill&quot;. The same year, Gygax created the magazine &quot;The Strategic Review&quot; with himself as editor. But wanting a more industry-wide periodical, he hired Tim Kask as TSR&#x27;s first employee to change this magazine to the fantasy periodical &quot;The Dragon&quot;, with Gygax as writer, columnist, and publisher (from 1978 to 1981). &quot;The Dragon&quot; debuted in June 1976, and Gygax said of its success years later: &quot;When I decided that &quot;The Strategic Review&quot; was not the right vehicle, hired Tim Kask as a magazine editor for Tactical Studies Rules, and named the new publication he was to produce &quot;The Dragon&quot;, I thought we would eventually have a great periodical to serve gaming enthusiasts worldwide ... At no time did I ever contemplate so great a success or so long a lifespan.&quot;

TSR moved out from the Gygax house in 1976 into the first professional location it could call home, known as &quot;The Dungeon Hobby Shop&quot;. Arneson was hired as part of the creative staff, but was let go after only ten months, another sign that Gygax and Arneson had creative differences over D&amp;D.

=== &quot;Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; and Hollywood===
The &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons Basic Set&quot; released in 1977 was an introductory version of the original &quot;D&amp;D&quot; geared toward new players and edited by John Eric Holmes. The same year, TSR Hobbies released &quot;Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; (&quot;AD&amp;D&quot;), a completely new and complex version of &quot;D&amp;D&quot;. The &quot;Monster Manual&quot; was also released that year and became the first supplemental rule book of the new system, and many more followed. &quot;AD&amp;D&quot; rules were not fully compatible with those of the &quot;D&amp;D Basic Set&quot;, and &quot;D&amp;D&quot; and &quot;AD&amp;D&quot; became distinct product lines. Splitting the game lines created a further rift between Gygax and Arneson. Arneson received a ten-percent royalty on sales of all &quot;D&amp;D&quot; products, but Gygax refused to pay him royalties on &quot;AD&amp;D&quot; books, claiming that it was a new and different property. In 1979, Arneson sued TSR; they settled in March 1981 with the agreement that Arneson would receive a 2.5-percent royalty on all AD&amp;D products, giving him a six-figure annual income for the next decade.

Gygax wrote the &quot;AD&amp;D&quot; hardcovers &quot;Players Handbook&quot;, &quot;Dungeon Masters Guide&quot;, &quot;Monster Manual,&quot; and &quot;Monster Manual II&quot;. He also wrote or co-wrote many &quot;AD&amp;D&quot; and basic &quot;D&amp;D&quot; adventure modules, including &quot;The Keep on the Borderlands&quot;, &quot;Tomb of Horrors&quot;, &quot;Expedition to the Barrier Peaks&quot;, &quot;The Temple of Elemental Evil&quot;, &quot;The Forgotten Temple of Tharizdun&quot;, &quot;Mordenkainen&#x27;s Fantastic Adventure&quot;, &quot;Isle of the Ape&quot;, and all seven of the modules later combined into &quot;Queen of the Spiders&quot;. In 1980, Gygax&#x27;s long-time campaign setting Greyhawk was published in the form of the &quot;World of Greyhawk Fantasy World Setting&quot; folio, which was expanded in 1983 into the &quot;World of Greyhawk Fantasy Game Setting&quot; boxed set. Sales of the &quot;D&amp;D&quot; game reached $8.5 million in 1980. Gygax also provided assistance on the &quot;Gamma World&quot; science fantasy role-playing game in 1981 and co-authored the &quot;Gamma World&quot; adventure &quot;Legion of Gold&quot;.

In 1979, Michigan State University student James Dallas Egbert III allegedly disappeared into the school&#x27;s steam tunnels while playing a live-action version of &quot;D&amp;D&quot;. In fact, Egbert was discovered in Louisiana several weeks later, but negative mainstream media attention focused on &quot;D&amp;D&quot; as the cause. In 1982, Patricia Pulling&#x27;s son killed himself. Pulling blamed &quot;D&amp;D&quot; for her son&#x27;s suicide and formed the organization B.A.D.D. (Bothered About Dungeons &amp; Dragons) to attack the game and TSR. Gygax defended the game on a segment of &quot;60 Minutes&quot; that aired in 1985. Death threats started arriving at the TSR office, so he hired a bodyguard. Nevertheless, TSR&#x27;s annual &quot;D&amp;D&quot; sales increased in 1982 to $16 million. In January 1983, &quot;The New York Times&quot; speculated that &quot;D&amp;D&quot; might become &quot;the great game of the 1980s&quot; in the same manner that &quot;Monopoly&quot; was emblematic of the Great Depression.

Brian Blume persuaded Gygax to allow Brian&#x27;s brother Kevin to purchase Melvin Blume&#x27;s shares. This gave the Blume brothers a controlling interest, and Gygax and the Blumes were increasingly at loggerheads over the company&#x27;s management by 1981. Gygax&#x27;s frustrations at work and increased prosperity from his generous royalties brought a number of changes to his personal life. He and Mary Jo had been active members of the local Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses, but others in the congregation already felt uneasy about his smoking and drinking; his connection to the &quot;satanic&quot; game D&amp;D caused enough friction that the family finally disassociated themselves from Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses. Mary Jo resented the amount of time that her husband spent &quot;playing games&quot;; she had begun to drink excessively, and the couple argued frequently. Gygax had started smoking marijuana when he lost his insurance job in 1970, and he started to use cocaine and had a number of extramarital affairs. In 1983, the two got an acrimonious divorce.

At the same time, the Blumes wanted to get Gygax out of Lake Geneva so that they could manage the company without his &quot;interference&quot;, so they split TSR Hobbies into TSR, Inc. and TSR Entertainment, Inc. Gygax became president of TSR Entertainment, Inc., and the Blumes sent him to Hollywood to develop TV and film opportunities. He became co-producer of the licensed &quot;D&amp;D&quot; cartoon series for CBS, which led its time slot for two years.

Gygax&#x27; life continued to unravel on the West Coast, as he rented an immense mansion, increased his cocaine use, and spent time with several young starlets.

=== Leaving TSR ===
Gygax was occupied with getting a movie off the ground in Hollywood, so he had to leave TSR in the hands of Kevin and Brian Blume to oversee its day-to-day operations. He reached an agreement with Orson Welles in 1984 to star in a D&amp;D movie, with John Boorman to act as producer and director. But almost at the same time, he received word that TSR had run into severe financial difficulties, and Kevin Blume was attempting to sell the company for six million dollars.

Gygax immediately discarded his movie ambitions—his &quot;D&amp;D&quot; movie was never made—and flew back to Lake Geneva. He discovered that industry leader TSR was grossing $30 million, yet it was barely breaking even; it was in fact $1.5 million in debt and teetering on the edge of insolvency. Gygax brought his findings to the five other company directors. He charged that the financial crisis was due to Kevin Blume&#x27;s mismanagement: excess inventory, overstaffing, too many company cars, and some questionable projects such as dredging up a 19th-century shipwreck. Gygax gained control and produced the new AD&amp;D book &quot;Unearthed Arcana&quot; and the Greyhawk novel &quot;Saga of Old City&quot;, featuring a protagonist called Gord the Rogue; both sold well. He also hired company manager Lorraine Williams. She bought the Blumes&#x27; shares and replaced Gygax as president and CEO in October 1985, stating that Gygax would make no further creative contributions to TSR. Several of his projects were immediately shelved. Gygax took TSR to court in a bid to block the Blumes&#x27; sale of their shares to Williams, but he lost.

Sales of &quot;D&amp;D&quot; reached $29 million in 1985, but Gygax resigned from all of his positions with TSR in October 1986, and all of his disputes with TSR were settled in December. By the terms of the settlement, he gave up his rights except to Gord the Rogue and to those &quot;D&amp;D&quot; characters whose names were anagrams or plays on his own name (for example, Yrag and Zagyg).

== After TSR ==

=== 1985–1989: New Infinities Productions, Inc. ===
Immediately after leaving TSR, Gygax was approached by a wargaming acquaintance, Forrest Baker, who had done some consulting work for TSR in 1983 and 1984. Tired of company management, Gygax was simply looking for a way to market more of his Gord the Rogue novels, but Baker had a vision for a new gaming company. He promised that he would handle the business end while Gygax would handle the creative projects. Baker also guaranteed that, using Gygax&#x27;s name, he would be able to bring in one to two million dollars of investment. Gygax decided this was a good opportunity, and in October 1986, New Infinities Productions, Inc. (NIPI) was announced publicly. To help him with the creative work, Gygax poached Frank Mentzer and &quot;Dragon&quot; magazine editor Kim Mohan from TSR. But before a single product was released, Forrest Baker left NIPI when the outside investment he promised of one to two million dollars failed to materialize.

Against his will, Gygax was back in charge again; he immediately looked for a quick product to get NIPI off the ground. He had been able to keep the rights to Gord the Rogue as part of the severance agreement he made with TSR, so he made a new licensing agreement with TSR for the Greyhawk setting and began writing new novels starting with &quot;Sea of Death&quot; (1987); novel sales were brisk, and Gygax&#x27;s Gord the Rogue novels kept New Infinities operating.

Gygax brought in Don Turnbull from Games Workshop to manage the company, then worked with Mohan and Mentzer on a science fiction-themed RPG, &quot;Cyborg Commando&quot;, which was published in 1987. But sales of the new game were not brisk. As game historian Shannon Appelcline noted in 2014, the game was &quot;seen as one of the biggest flops in the industry.&quot; Mentzer and Mohan wrote a series of generic RPG adventures, &quot;Gary Gygax Presents Fantasy Master&quot;, and began working on a third line of products, which began with an adventure written by Mentzer, &quot;The Convert&quot; (1987). He had written it as an RPGA tournament for &quot;D&amp;D&quot;, but TSR was not interested in publishing it. Mentzer got verbal permission to publish it with New Infinities, but since the permission was not in writing TSR filed an injunction for a period to prevent the adventure&#x27;s sale.

During all this drama, Gygax had a romantic relationship with Gail Carpenter, his former assistant at TSR. In November 1986, she gave birth to Gygax&#x27;s sixth child, Alex. Biographer Michael Witwer believes Alex&#x27;s birth forced Gygax to reconsider the equation of work, gaming and family that, until this time, had been dominated by work and gaming. &quot;Gary, keenly aware that he had made mistakes as a father and husband in the past, was determined not to make them again ... Gary was also a realist, and knew what good fatherhood would demand, especially at his age.&quot; On August 15, 1987, on what would have been his parents&#x27; 50th wedding anniversary, Gygax married Carpenter.

During 1987 and 1988, Gygax worked with Flint Dille on the &quot;Sagard the Barbarian&quot; books, as well as &quot;Role-Playing Mastery&quot; and its sequel, &quot;Master of the Game&quot;. He also wrote two more Gord the Rogue novels, &quot;City of Hawks&quot; (1987), and &quot;Come Endless Darkness&quot; (1988). But by 1988, TSR had rewritten the setting for the world of Greyhawk, and Gygax was not happy with the new direction in which TSR was taking &quot;his&quot; creation. In a literary declaration that his old world was dead, and wanting to make a clean break with all things Greyhawk, Gygax destroyed his version of Oerth in the final Gord the Rogue novel, &quot;Dance of Demons&quot;.

With the Gord the Rogue novels finished, NIPI&#x27;s main source of steady income dried up. The company needed a new product. Gygax announced in 1988 in a company newsletter that he and Rob Kuntz, his co-Dungeon Master during the early days of the Greyhawk campaign, were working as a team again. This time they would create a new multi-genre fantasy role-playing game called &quot;Infinite Adventures&quot;, which would receive support through different gamebooks for each genre. This line would explore the original visions of the Castle and City of Greyhawk by Gygax and Kuntz, now called &quot;Castle Dunfalcon&quot;. Before work on this project could commence, NIPI ran out of money, was forced into bankruptcy, and dissolved in 1989.

=== 1990–1994: &quot;Dangerous Journeys&quot; ===
After NIPI folded, Gygax decided to create an entirely new RPG called &quot;The Carpenter Project&quot;, one considerably more complex and &quot;rules heavy&quot; than his original &quot;D&amp;D&quot; system, which had encompassed a mere 150 pages. He also wanted to create a horror setting for the new RPG called &quot;Unhallowed&quot;. He began working on the RPG and the setting with the help of games designer Mike McCulley. Game Designers&#x27; Workshop became interested in publishing the new system, and it also drew the attention of JVC and NEC, who were looking for a new RPG system and setting to turn into a series of computer games. NEC and JVC were not interested in horror, however, so they shelved the &quot;Unhallowed&quot; setting in favor of a fantasy setting called &quot;Mythus&quot;. JVC also wanted a name change for the RPG, favoring &quot;Dangerous Dimensions&quot; over &quot;The Carpenter Project&quot;. Work progressed favorably until March 1992, when TSR filed an injunction against &quot;Dangerous Dimensions&quot;, claiming that the name and initials were too similar to &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;. Gygax changed the name to &quot;Dangerous Journeys&quot;.

The marketing strategy for &quot;Dangerous Journeys: Mythus&quot; was multi-pronged. The RPG and setting were to be published by Game Designers&#x27; Workshop, and the &quot;Mythus&quot; computer game was being prepared by NEC and JVC. There would also be a series of books based on the Mythus setting written by Gygax. He wrote three novels published by Penguin/Roc and later reprinted by Paizo Publishing: &quot;The Anubis Murders&quot;, &quot;The Samarkand Solution&quot;, and &quot;Death in Delhi&quot;.

In late 1992, the &quot;Dangerous Journeys&quot; RPG was released by Game Designers&#x27; Workshop, but TSR immediately applied for an injunction against the entire &quot;Dangerous Journeys&quot; RPG and the &quot;Mythus&quot; setting, arguing that &quot;Dangerous Journeys&quot; was based on &quot;D&amp;D&quot; and &quot;AD&amp;D&quot;. The injunction failed, but TSR moved forward with litigation. Gygax believed that the legal action was without merit and fueled by Lorraine Williams&#x27; personal enmity, but NEC and JVC both withdrew from the project, killing the &quot;Mythus&quot; computer game. By 1994, the legal costs had drained all of Gygax&#x27;s resources, so he offered to settle. In the end, TSR paid Gygax for the complete rights to &quot;Dangerous Journeys&quot; and &quot;Mythus&quot;.

=== 1995–2000: &quot;Lejendary Adventures&quot; ===

In 1995, Gygax began work on a new computer role-playing game called &quot;Lejendary Adventures&quot;. In contrast to the rules-heavy &quot;Dangerous Journeys&quot;, this new system was a return to simple and basic rules. Although he was not able to successfully release a &quot;Lejendary Adventures&quot; computer game, Gygax decided to instead publish it as a tabletop game.

Meanwhile, in 1996 the games industry was rocked by the news that TSR had run into insoluble financial problems and had been bought by Wizards of the Coast. While WotC was busy refocussing TSR&#x27;s products, Christopher Clark of Inner City Games Designs suggested to Gygax in 1997 that they could publish role-playing game adventures that game stores could sell while TSR was otherwise occupied, so Inner City published the fantasy adventures &quot;A Challenge of Arms&quot; (1998) and &quot;The Ritual of the Golden Eyes&quot; (1999). Gygax introduced some investors to the publication setup that Clark was using, and although the investors were not willing to fund publication of &quot;Legendary Adventures&quot;, Clark and Gygax were able to start the partnership Hekaforge Productions. Gygax was thus able to return to publish &quot;Lejendary Adventures&quot; in 1999. Hekaforge published the game in a three-volume set: &quot;The Lejendary Rules for All Players&quot; (1999), &quot;Lejend Master&#x27;s Lore&quot; (2000) and &quot;Beasts of Lejend&quot; (2000).

The new owner of TSR, WotC&#x27;s Peter Adkison, clearly did not harbor any of Lorraine Williams&#x27; ill-will toward Gygax: Adkison purchased all of Gygax&#x27;s residual rights to D&amp;D and AD&amp;D for a six-figure sum. Gygax did not author any new game supplements or novels for TSR or WotC, but he did agree to write the preface to the 1998 adventure &quot;Return to the Tomb of Horrors&quot;, a paean to Gygax&#x27;s original AD&amp;D adventure &quot;Tomb of Horrors&quot;. He also returned to the pages of Dragon Magazine, writing the &quot;Up on a Soapbox&quot; column which was published from Issue #268 (January 2000) to Issue #320 (June 2004).

=== 2000–2008: Later works and death===
Gygax continued to work on &quot;Lejendary Adventures&quot; which he believed was his best work. However, sales were below expectation.

Stephen Chenault and Davis Chenault of Troll Lord Games announced on June 11, 2001 that Gygax would be writing supplements for their company. Gygax wrote a hardcover book series for Troll Lord known as &quot;Gygaxian Fantasy Worlds&quot;, beginning with &quot;The Canting Crew&quot; (2002) about the underworld of rogues, and including the game design books &quot;World Builder&quot; (2003) and &quot;Living Fantasy&quot; (2003) for various different settings. Gygax wrote the first four books before taking an advisory role on the series, but the series logo continued to carry his name. Troll Lord also published some adventures as a result of their partnership with Gygax, including &quot;The Hermit&quot; (2002) which was meant to be an adventure for d20 as well as &quot;Lejendary Adventures&quot;.

Gygax had given an encyclopedic 72,000-word manuscript to Christopher Clark of Hekaforge by 2002 which detailed the setting for the Lejendary Earth, which Clark expanded and split into five books. Hekaforge was only able to publish the first two Lejendary Earth sourcebooks &quot;Gazetteer&quot; (2002) and &quot;Noble Kings and Great Lands&quot; (2003), and the small company was having financial difficulties by 2003. Clark got Troll Lord Games to be their &quot;angel&quot; investor and publish the three remaining &quot;Lejendary Adventures&quot; books.

Necromancer Games announced their plans to publish a d20 version of the adventure &quot;Necropolis&quot; on October 9, 2001. Gygax had originally intended to release this through New Infinities Productions, but GDW published it in 1992 as an adventure for &quot;Mythus&quot;; &quot;Gary Gygax&#x27;s Necropolis&quot; was published a year later.

Gygax also performed voiceover narration for cartoons and video games. In 2000, he voiced his own cartoon self for an episode of Futurama entitled &quot;Anthology of Interest I&quot; which also included the voices of Al Gore, Stephen Hawking, and Nichelle Nichols. Gygax also performed as a guest Dungeon Master in the Delera&#x27;s Tomb quest series of the massively multiplayer online role-playing game &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons Online: Stormreach&quot;.

During his time with TSR, Gygax had often mentioned the mysterious Castle Greyhawk which formed the center of his own home campaign, but he had never published details of the castle. In 2003, he announced that he was again partnering with Rob Kuntz to publish the original details of Castle Greyhawk and the City of Greyhawk in six volumes, although the project would use the rules for &quot;Castles and Crusades&quot; rather than &quot;D&amp;D&quot;. As Gygax wrote in an on-line forum:

Wizards of the Coast had bought TSR in 1997 and still owned the rights to the name &quot;Greyhawk&quot;, so Gygax changed the name of Castle Greyhawk to &quot;Castle Zagyg&quot; and also changed the name of the nearby city to &quot;Yggsburgh&quot;, a play on his initials &quot;E.G.G.&quot;

The scale of the project was enormous. By the time that Gygax and Kuntz had stopped working on their original home campaign, the castle dungeons had encompassed 50 levels of complex passages with thousands of rooms and traps, plus plans for the city of Yggsburgh and encounter areas outside the castle and city. All of this would be too much to fit into the proposed six volumes, so Gygax decided that he would compress the castle dungeons into 13 levels, the size of his original Castle Greyhawk in 1973, by amalgamating the best of what could be gleaned from binders and boxes of old notes. However, neither Gygax nor Kuntz had kept comprehensive plans because they had often made up details of play sessions on the spot. They usually just scribbled a quick map as they played, with cursory notes about monsters, treasures, and traps. These sketchy maps had contained just enough detail that the two could ensure that their independent work would dovetail. All of these old notes now had to be deciphered, 25-year old memories dredged up as to what had happened in each room, and a decision made whether to keep or discard each new piece. Recreating the city too would be a challenge. Gygax still had his old maps of the original city, but all of his previously published work on it was owned by WotC, so he would have to create most of it from scratch while still maintaining the &quot;look and feel&quot; of his original.

Due to creative differences, Kuntz backed out of the project but created an adventure module that would be published at the same time as Gygax&#x27;s first book. Gygax continued to put Castle Zagyg together on his own, but this came to a complete halt when he had a serious stroke in April 2004 and then another one a few weeks later. He returned to his keyboard after a seven-month convalescence, his output reduced from 14-hour work days to only one or two hours per day. &quot;Castle Zagyg Part I: Yggsburgh&quot; finally appeared in 2005, the first book in the six-book series. Later that year, Troll Lord Games also published &quot;Castle Zagyg: Dark Chateau&quot; (2005), the adventure module written for the Yggsburgh setting by Rob Kuntz. Jeff Talanian assisted in creating the dungeon, which was ultimately published in the limited edition release &quot;CZ9: The East Marks Gazetteer&quot; (2007).

That same year, Gygax was diagnosed with a potentially deadly abdominal aortic aneurysm. Doctors concurred that surgery was needed, but their estimates of success varied from 50-percent to 90-percent. Gygax came to believe that he would likely die on the operating table, and he refused to consider surgery, although he realized that a rupture of the aneurysm would be fatal. In one concession to his condition, he switched from cigarettes, which he had smoked since high school, to cigars.

It was not until 2008 that Gygax was able to finish the second of six volumes entitled &quot;Castle Zagyg: The Upper Works&quot;, which described details of the castle above ground. The next two volumes were supposed to detail the dungeons beneath Castle Zagyg, but Gygax died in March 2008 before they could be written. His widow Gail had formed the new company Gygax Games, and the company withdrew all of the Gygax licenses from Troll Lord and from Hekaforge three months after he died.

== Personal life ==
Gygax married Mary Jo Powell on September 14, 1958. They had five children together: Ernie, Elise, Heidi, Cindy, and Luke. They became Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses, but he eventually left the religion; he remained a Christian, citing his favorite Bible verses of Matthew 5:15–16 a few months before he died. He divorced Mary Jo in 1983 and married Gail Carpenter, one of his former accountants, on August 15, 1987. Their son, Alex, was born in 1986.

Gygax was an avid hunter and target shooter from an early age with both bow and gun. He collected guns and owned a variety of rifles, shotguns, and handguns at various times. He was a keen supporter of the Chicago Bears. He described himself as a &quot;biological determinist&quot; and believed gaming in general to be a male pursuit, stating in 2004 that &quot;it isn&#x27;t that females can&#x27;t play games well, it is just that it isn&#x27;t a compelling activity to them as is the case for males&quot;.

== Awards and honors ==
Immediately after Gygax&#x27;s 2008 funeral, mourners adjourned to Lake Geneva&#x27;s American Legion Hall to play games in the deceased&#x27;s honor. Members of his family served refreshments and played games with friends. This event inspired Luke Gygax to create a locally hosted game event around the date of his father&#x27;s death. Years later, Gary Con is so well-attended a dozen Lake Geneva hotels must be utilized in order to serve the demand. The funeral day event is now regarded as Gary Con 0.

As the &quot;father of role-playing games&quot;, Gygax received many awards, honors, and tributes related to gaming:

* He was inducted into the Academy of Adventure Gaming Arts and Design Origins Award Hall of Fame, also known as the Charles Roberts Awards Hall of Fame, in 1980.
* &quot;Sync&quot; magazine named Gygax number one on the list of &quot;The 50 Biggest Nerds of All Time&quot;.
* &quot;SFX&quot; magazine listed him as number 37 on the list of the &quot;50 Greatest SF Pioneers&quot;.
* In 1999, &quot;Pyramid&quot; magazine named Gygax as one of &quot;The Millennium&#x27;s Most Influential Persons&quot; &quot;in the realm of adventure gaming&quot;.
* Gygax was tied with J. R. R. Tolkien for number 18 on GameSpy&#x27;s &quot;30 Most Influential People in Gaming&quot;.
* A strain of bacteria was named in honor of Gygax, &quot;Arthronema gygaxiana sp nov UTCC393&quot;.
* He was inducted into the Pop Culture Hall of Fame Class of 2019

In 2008 Gail Gygax, the widow of Gary Gygax, began the process to establish a memorial to her late husband in Lake Geneva. On March 28, 2011, the City Council of Lake Geneva, Wisconsin, approved Gail Gygax&#x27;s application for a site of memorial in Donian Park; however, the Gygax family was unable to raise the money at the time to complete the memorial during a 2012 funding campaign. The design of the monument is a stone castle look with medieval pole arms, a family crest and a dragon.

In 2014, with the approval of Gary&#x27;s eldest son, Ernie, Epic Quest Publishing started a Kickstarter campaign to raise the initial funding for a museum dedicated to Gary featuring a gaming and event center and hall of fame for authors, artists, designers and game masters.

Lake Geneva mayor Charlene Klein proclaimed July 27, 2023, as &quot;Gary Gygax Day&quot;, and on that day dedicated a lakeside park bench in his honor. In her proclamation she reminds residents that in 1983 TSR employed over 400 people, &quot;over 6% of Lake Geneva&#x27;s population at the time.&quot;

== In popular culture ==
In 2000, Gygax voiced his cartoon self for the &quot;Futurama&quot; episode &quot;Anthology of Interest I&quot;, that also included the voices of Al Gore, Stephen Hawking, and Nichelle Nichols. Gygax appeared as his 8-bit self on &quot;Code Monkeys&quot; in 2007-8. Stephen Colbert, an avid &quot;D&amp;D&quot; gamer in his youth, dedicated the last part of the March 5, 2008, episode of &quot;The Colbert Report&quot; to Gygax.

Numerous names in &quot;D&amp;D&quot;, such as Zagyg, Ring of Gaxx, and Gryrax, are anagrams or alterations of Gygax&#x27;s name.

<doc id="12850" wikidata="Q1528895" url="?curid=12850" title="Governor of New South Wales">
<text>The governor of New South Wales is the representative of the monarch, King Charles III, in the state of New South Wales. In an analogous way to the Governor-General of Australia at the national level, the Governors of the Australian States perform constitutional and ceremonial functions at the state level. The governor is appointed by the monarch on the advice of the Premier of New South Wales, and serves in office for an unfixed period of time—known as serving &quot;At His Majesty&#x27;s pleasure&quot;—though five years is the general standard of office term. The current governor is retired judge Margaret Beazley, who succeeded David Hurley on 2 May 2019.

The office has its origin in the 18th-century colonial governors of New South Wales upon its settlement in 1788, and is the oldest continuous institution in Australia. The present incarnation of the position emerged with the Federation of Australia and the &quot;New South Wales Constitution Act 1902&quot;, which defined the viceregal office as the governor acting by and with the advice of the Executive Council of New South Wales. However, the post still ultimately represented the Government of the United Kingdom until, after continually decreasing involvement by the British government, the passage in 1942 of the Statute of Westminster Adoption Act 1942 (see Statute of Westminster) and the Australia Act 1986, after which the governor became the direct, personal representative of the sovereign.

== Appointment ==
The office of governor is prescribed by the New South Wales Constitution. The Monarch, on the advice and recommendation of the Premier of New South Wales, appoints the governor with a commission issued under the Royal sign-manual and Public Seal of the State, who is from then until being sworn in by the premier and chief justice referred to as the &quot;governor-designate&quot;.

Besides the administration of the oaths of office, there is no set formula for the swearing-in of a governor-designate. The constitution act stipulates: &quot;Before assuming office, a person appointed to be Governor shall take the Oath or Affirmation of Allegiance and the Oath or Affirmation of Office in the presence of the Chief Justice or another Judge of the Supreme Court.&quot; The sovereign will also hold an audience with the appointee and will at that time induct the governor-designate as a Companion of the Order of Australia (AC).

The incumbent will generally serve for at least five years, though this is only a developed convention, and the governor still technically acts at His Majesty&#x27;s pleasure (or the &quot;Royal Pleasure&quot;). The premier may therefore recommend to the King that the viceroy remain in his service for a longer period of time, sometimes upwards of more than seven years. A governor may also resign and three have died in office. In such a circumstance, or if the governor leaves the country for longer than one month, the Lieutenant-Governor of New South Wales, concurrently held by the Chief Justice of New South Wales since 1872, serves as Administrator of the Government and exercises all powers of the governor. Furthermore, if the lieutenant governor becomes incapacitated while serving in the office of governor or is also absent from the state, the next most senior judge of the Supreme Court is sworn in as the administrator.

=== Selection ===
Between 1788 and 1957, all governors were born outside New South Wales and were often members of the peerage. Historian A. J. P. Taylor once noted that &quot;going out and governing New South Wales became the British aristocracy&#x27;s &#x27;abiding consolation&#x27;&quot;. However, the position eventually became filled by Australians, with the first Australian-born governor, Sir John Northcott on 1 August 1946, being the first Australian-born governor of any state. However, as Northcott was born in Victoria, it was not until Sir Eric Woodward&#x27;s appointment by Queen Elizabeth II in 1957 that the position was filled by a New South Welshman. This practice continued until 1996, when Queen Elizabeth II commissioned as her representative Gordon Samuels, a London-born immigrant to Australia.

Early governors were frequently former politicians, many being members of the House of Lords by virtue of their peerage; however they were required by the tenets of constitutional monarchy to be non-partisan while in office. The first governors were all military officers and the majority of governors since have come from a military background, numbering 19. Samuels was the first governor in New South Wales history without a political or common public service background—a former justice of the Supreme Court of New South Wales. The first woman to hold this position is also the first Lebanese-Australian governor, Dame Marie Bashir.

==Role ==
As the sovereign lives outside New South Wales, the Governor&#x27;s primary task is to perform the Sovereign&#x27;s constitutional duties on their behalf. 
The Governor is enpowered by the &quot;Constitution Act 1902&quot; to appoint the ministers of the Government of New South Wales. Convention dictates that the governor must select as premier an individual from Legislative Assembly that has the confidence of that body. The premier then advises the governor on who to appoint as ministers. The executive branch of government exercises power formally through the governor-in-council, the governor acting with the advice of the Executive Council of New South Wales. This council is made up of cabinet ministers and gives legal effect to decisions already reached in cabinet. While the governor must almost always act only on the advice of ministers, in exceptional circumstances they may act in the absence or contrary to advice—this is known as the reserve powers. The circumstances when these powers may be exercised is disputed, however in 1932 the governor justified the use of these powers to revoke the commission of premier Jack Lang during the 1932 New South Wales constitutional crisis on the grounds of alleged illegal activity by the premier.

The Governor alone is constitutionally mandated to summon Parliament and may also prorogue and dissolve it on the advice of the premier. The Governor grants Royal Assent in the King&#x27;s name to bills as the final step required to give them the force of law. While in the past Governors had the discretion to refuse or reserve assent to bills, usually where they were seen as unfavourable to imperial interests, now the only likely grounds on which a bill could be refused if it was passed contrary to manner and form requirements (for example the requirement to hold a referendum to approve of any law that abolished or changed the powers of either of the houses of Parliament). A Governor&#x27;s view that a bill is likely unconstitutional is not a ground for the reservation of royal assent as the legality of a bill is determined by the courts. With most constitutional functions delegated to Cabinet, the Governor acts in a primarily ceremonial fashion. The Governor hosts members of Australia&#x27;s Royal Family, as well as foreign royalty and heads of state. Also as part of international relations, the Governor receives letters of credence and of recall from foreign Consuls-general appointed to Sydney. When they are the longest-serving State Governor, the governor of New South Wales holds a dormant commission to act as the Administrator of the Commonwealth when the Governor-General of Australia is absent from Australia, a role currently held by Margaret Beazley, and previously by Marie Bashir.

The Governor is also tasked with fostering unity and pride. The governor inducts individuals into the various national orders and present national medals and decorations, however the most senior awards such as ACs or the Victoria Cross are the sole prerogative of the governor general. The Governor also &quot;ex-officio&quot; serves as Honorary Colonel of the Royal New South Wales Regiment (since 1960), Honorary Air Commodore of No. 22 (City of Sydney) Squadron, Royal Australian Air Force (since 1937) and Honorary Commodore of the Royal Australian Navy, as well as the Chief Scout for New South Wales.

==Symbols and protocol==
The Governor is listed second in New South Wales&#x27; table of precedence, behind the Governor-General. The incumbent Governor is entitled to use the style of &quot;His&quot; or &quot;Her Excellency&quot;, while in office. On 28 November 2013 the Premier of NSW announced that the Queen had given approval for the title of &quot;The Honourable&quot; to be accorded to the governors and former Governors of New South Wales. Upon installation, the governor serves as a Deputy Prior of the Most Venerable Order of the Hospital of Saint John of Jerusalem in Australia and is also traditionally invested as either a Knight or Dame of Justice or Grace of the Order. It is also customary that the Governor is made a Companion of the Order of Australia, though this is not necessarily automatic. The use by the Governor of an elaborate uniform, comprising a plain blue tailcoat, scarlet collar and cuffs (embroidered in silver), silver epaulettes, and a plumed bicorne hat, fell out of use with the appointment of the first Australian-born Governor, Sir John Northcott, in 1946.

The musical vice regal salute—composed of the first and last four bars of the national anthem (&quot;Advance Australia Fair&quot;)—is played on the arrival and departure of the Governor from a formal event in which a military or service guard is present. It is optional to play if no guard is at the event.

To mark the Governor&#x27;s presence at any building, ship, aeroplane, or car in Australia, the Governor&#x27;s standard or flag is employed. Following the example of other states adopting unique Governor&#x27;s standards, in 1980 the Government of New South Wales sought to introduce a new standard for the Governor to replace the Union Flag that had been in use since 1788. Premier Neville Wran wrote to the Governor, Sir Roden Cutler, on 25 November 1980 advising: &quot;His Excellency’s Ministers of State now consider that there should be a change in the Personal Standard of the Governor of New South Wales, such change to take effect at the conclusion of His Excellency’s term of office. The Premier therefore recommends for approval a change in the Governor’s distinctive flag from the Union Flag to the New South Wales State Flag with a Crown surmounting the State badge in the fly.&quot; However, Cutler did not agree with this change, and it was recommended that the change be undertaken after he had left office. The new Governor&#x27;s Standard was designed and presented by the Garter King of Arms to the Agent-General for New South Wales in London on 8 January 1981, who then sought Royal assent of the new design, which was given on 15 January 1981. The flag was first flown on 20 January 1981 over Parliament House for the official swearing-in of Governor Sir James Rowland, and was flown for the first time over Government House on 29 January 1981. 

;Past and present standards of the governor
==History==
Aside from the Crown itself, the office of Governor of New South Wales is the oldest constitutional office in Australia. Captain Arthur Phillip assumed office as Governor of New South Wales on 7 February 1788, when the Colony of New South Wales, the first British settlement in Australia, was formally proclaimed. The early colonial governors held an almost autocratic power due to the distance from and poor communications with Great Britain, until 1824 when the New South Wales Legislative Council, Australia&#x27;s first legislative body, was appointed to advise the governor.

Between 1850 and 1861, the Governor of New South Wales was titled Governor-General, in an early attempt at federalism imposed by Earl Grey. All communication between the Australian colonies and the British Government was meant to go through the Governor-General, and the other colonies had lieutenant-Governors. As South Australia (1836), Tasmania (January 1855) and Victoria (May 1855) obtained responsible government, their lieutenant-Governors were replaced by Governors. Although he had ceased acting as a Governor-General, Sir William Denison retained the title until his retirement in 1861.

The six British colonies in Australia joined to form the Commonwealth of Australia in 1901. New South Wales and the other colonies became states in the federal system under the Constitution of Australia. In 1902, the &quot;New South Wales Constitution Act&quot; 1902 confirmed the modern system of government of New South Wales as a state. Like the new federal Governor-General and the other state governors, in the first years after federation, the governor of New South Wales continued to act both in their constitutional role, and as a liaison between the local government and the imperial government in London. 
In 1942, the Commonwealth of Australia passed the &quot;Statute of Westminster Adoption Act 1942&quot;, which rendered Australia dominion status under the Statute of Westminster, and while Australia and Britain share the same person as monarch, that person acts in a distinct capacity when acting as the monarch of each dominion. The convention that the monarch acts in respect of Australian affairs on the advice of his or her Australian ministers, rather than his or her British ministers, became enshrined in law. For New South Wales however, because the Statute of Westminster did not disturb the constitutional arrangements of the Australian states, the governor remained (at least formally) in New South Wales the representative of the British monarch. This arrangement seemed incongruous with the Commonwealth of Australia&#x27;s independent dominion status conferred by the Statute of Westminster, and with the federal structure.

After much negotiation between the federal and state governments of Australia, the British government and Buckingham Palace, the &quot;Australia Act 1986&quot; removed any remaining constitutional roles of the British monarch and British government in the Australian states, and established that the governor of New South Wales (along with the other state governors) was the direct, personal representative of the Australian monarch, and not the British monarch or the British government, nor the governor-general of Australia or the Australian federal government. 

==Residences and household==
===Government House ===
On his arrival in Sydney in 1788, Governor Phillip resided in a temporary wood and canvas house before the construction of a more substantial house on a site now bounded by Bridge Street and Phillip Street, Sydney. This first Government House was extended and repaired by the following eight governors, but was generally in poor condition and was vacated when the governor relocated to the new building in 1845, designed by Edward Blore and Mortimer Lewis.

With the federation of the Australian colonies in 1901, it was announced that Government House was to serve as the secondary residence of the new governor-general of Australia. As a consequence the NSW Government leased the residence of Cranbrook, Bellevue Hill as the residence of the governor. This arrangement lasted until 1913 when the NSW Government terminated the Commonwealth lease of Government House (the governor-general moved to the new Sydney residence of Admiralty House), the governor from 1913 to 1917, Sir Gerald Strickland, continued to live in Cranbrook and on his departure his successor returned to Government House.

On 16 January 1996, Premier Bob Carr announced that the next governor would be Gordon Samuels, that he would not live or work at Government House and that he would retain his appointment as chairman of the New South Wales Law Reform Commission. On these changes, Carr said: &quot;The Office of the Governor should be less associated with pomp and ceremony, less encumbered by anachronistic protocol, more in tune with the character of the people.&quot; The state&#x27;s longest-serving governor, Sir Roden Cutler, was also reported as saying: &quot;It&#x27;s a political push to make way in New South Wales to lead the push for a republic. If they decide not to have a Governor and the public agrees with that, and Parliament agrees, and the Queen agrees to it, that is a different matter, but while there is a Governor you have got to give him some respectability and credibility, because he is the host for the whole of New South Wales. For the life of me I cannot understand the logic of having a Governor who is part-time and doesn&#x27;t live at Government House. It is such a degrading of the office and of the Governor.&quot;

In October 2011, the new premier, Barry O&#x27;Farrell, announced that the Governor, now Dame Marie Bashir, had agreed with O&#x27;Farrell&#x27;s offer to move back into Government House: &quot;A lot of people believe the Governor should live at Government House. That&#x27;s what it was built for ... [A]t some stage a rural or regional Governor will be appointed and we will need to provide accommodation at Government House so it makes sense to provide appropriate living areas&quot;. With the Governor&#x27;s return, management of the residence reverted to the Office of the Governor in December 2013.

===Summer residence===
In addition to the primary Sydney Vice-Regal residence, many Governors had also felt the need for a &#x27;summer retreat&#x27; to escape the hard temperatures of the Sydney summers. In 1790, Governor Phillip had a secondary residence built in the township of Parramatta. In 1799 the second governor, John Hunter, had the remains of Arthur Phillip&#x27;s cottage cleared away, and a more permanent building erected on the same site. This residence remained occupied until the completion of the primary Government House in 1845, however the hard summers and growing size of Sydney convinced successive governors of the need for a rural residence.

The governor from 1868 to 1872, the Earl Belmore, used Throsby Park in Moss Vale as his summer residence. His successor, Sir Hercules Robinson, often retired privately to the same area, in the Southern Highlands, for the same reason. In 1879 it was then decided that the colony should purchase a house at Sutton Forest for use as a permanent summer residence, and in 1881 the NSW Government purchased for £6000 a property known as &quot;Prospect&quot; that had been built by Robert Pemberton Richardson (of the firm Richardson &amp; Wrench). This was renamed &quot;Hillview&quot;, and became the primary summer governor&#x27;s residence from 1885 to 1957. In 1957, seen as unnecessary and expensive, Hillview was put up for sale and purchased from the state government by Edwin Klein. Hillview was returned to the people of NSW in 1985 and is currently leased under the ownership of the Environment and Heritage Group of the Department of Planning &amp; Environment.

===Household===
The viceregal household aids the governor in the execution of the royal constitutional and ceremonial duties and is managed by the Office of the Governor, whose current official secretary and chief of staff is Michael Miller RFD. These organised offices and support systems include aides-de-camp, press officers, financial managers, speech writers, trip organisers, event planners and protocol officers, chefs and other kitchen employees, waiters, and various cleaning staff, as well as tour guides. In this official and bureaucratic capacity, the entire household is often referred to as &quot;Government House&quot;. These departments are funded through the annual budget, as is the governor&#x27;s salary of $529,000.

<text>The governor of Victoria is the representative of the monarch, currently King Charles III, in the Australian state of Victoria.

The governor is appointed by the monarch on the advice of the premier of Victoria. The governor&#x27;s role is to represent the monarch. This role mainly includes performing ceremonial functions, such as opening and dissolving parliament, appointing the cabinet and granting royal assent.

The governor&#x27;s office and official residence is Government House next to the Royal Botanic Gardens and surrounded by Kings Domain in Melbourne.

The current governor of Victoria is Margaret Gardner, who succeeded Linda Dessau in August 2023.

==Powers==
In accordance with the conventions of the Westminster system of parliamentary government, the governor nearly always acts solely on the advice of the head of the elected government, the premier of Victoria. Nevertheless, the governor retains the reserve powers of the Crown, and has the right to dismiss the premier.

==Role of governor==
The governor is appointed by the monarch, on the advice of the premier of Victoria, to act as the monarch&#x27;s representative as head of state in Victoria. The governor acts &quot;At His Majesty&#x27;s pleasure&quot;, meaning that the term of the governor can be terminated at any time by the monarch acting upon the advice of the premier.

Since the passage of the &quot;Australia Acts 1986&quot;, it is the governor and not the monarch who exercises all the powers of the head of state and the governor is not subject to the direction or supervision of the monarch but acts upon the advice of the premier. Upon appointment, the governor becomes a viceroy. The governor&#x27;s main responsibilities fall into three categories – constitutional, ceremonial and community engagement.

==Governor&#x27;s personal standard==
The personal standard of the governor of Victoria is the same design as the state flag of Victoria, but with the blue background replaced by gold, and red stars depicting the Southern Cross. Above the Southern Cross is the Royal Crown.

The current standard has been in place since 1984. Previously, the standard used by Victorian governors after 1870 had been the Union Jack with the Badge of the State of Victoria emblazoned in the centre. 

The governor&#x27;s standard is flown at Government House and on vehicles conveying the governor. The standard is lowered over Government House when the governor is absent from Victoria.

;Past and present standards of the governor
==Related offices==
There is also a lieutenant-governor and an administrator. The chief justice of Victoria is &quot;ex officio&quot; the administrator, unless the chief justice is the lieutenant-governor, in which case, the next most senior judge is the administrator. The lieutenant-governor takes on the responsibilities of the governor when that post is vacant or when the governor is out of the state or unable to act. The administrator takes on those duties if both the governor and lieutenant-governor are not able to act for the above reasons.

See Governors of the Australian states for a description and history of the office of governor.

The Official Secretary to the Governor of Victoria is the head of the Office of the Governor which supports the Governor of Victoria in carrying out his or her official constitutional and ceremonial duties and community and international engagements. The official secretary manages the office and its administrative and service staff. All staff report to their respective managers, and through them to the Deputy Official Secretary and Official Secretary. The office also is in charge of maintaining Government House and its collections as a heritage and community asset of national importance. The official secretary is the Victorian nominee on the Council for the Order of Australia.

The Office of the Governor was established under the &quot;Public Administration Act 2004&quot; (Vic) as an administrative office within the portfolio of the Department of Premier and Cabinet. The current official secretary is Jonathan Burke, the current deputy official secretary (operations) is Taara Olorenshaw and the current deputy official secretary (program) is Patrick Rundle. 

==Australianisation of the office==
As with the other states, until the 1986 Australia Acts, the office of Governor of Victoria was an appointment of the British Foreign Office although local advice was considered and sometimes accepted.

Until the appointment of Victorian-born Sir Henry Winneke in 1974, the governors of Victoria were British. Since then, governors have been Australian although several were born overseas, namely Davis McCaughey (born in Ireland) came to Australia for work and David de Kretser (born in Ceylon, now Sri Lanka) and Alex Chernov (born in Lithuania), both of whom came to Australia while at school.

==List of governors of Victoria==
===Lieutenant-governors===
Prior to the separation of the colony of Victoria from New South Wales in 1851, the area was called the Port Phillip District of New South Wales. The Governor of New South Wales appointed superintendents of the district. In 1839, Charles La Trobe was appointed superintendent. La Trobe became lieutenant-governor of the new colony of Victoria on separation on 1 July 1851.

From 1850 to 1861, the Governor of New South Wales was titled Governor-general of New South Wales in an attempt to form a federal structure. Until Victoria obtained responsible government in 1855, the Governor-general of New South Wales appointed lieutenant-governors to Victoria. On Victoria obtaining responsible government in May 1855, the title of the then incumbent lieutenant-governor, Captain Sir Charles Hotham, became governor.

===Governors===
== Line of succession ==
There is also a lieutenant-governor and an administrator. The lieutenant-governor takes on the responsibilities of the governor when that post is vacant or when the governor is out of the state or unable to act. The lieutenant-governor is appointed by the governor on the advice of the premier of Victoria. Appointment as lieutenant-governor does not of itself confer any powers or functions. If there is no governor or if the governor is unavailable to act for a substantial period, the lieutenant-governor assumes office as administrator and exercises all the powers and functions of the governor.

If expecting to be unavailable for a short period only, the governor, with the consent of the premier, usually commissions the lieutenant-governor to act as deputy for the governor, performing some or all of the powers and functions of the governor.

The chief justice of Victoria is &quot;ex officio&quot; the administrator, unless the chief justice is the lieutenant-governor, in which case the next most senior judge is the administrator. The administrator takes on the governor&#x27;s duties if both the governor and lieutenant-governor are not able to act for the above reasons.

The current lieutenant-governor is James Angus, who was appointed to the role on 12 November 2021 to succeed Ken Lay.

<doc id="12855" wikidata="Q19185" url="?curid=12855" title="George Bernard Shaw">
<text>George Bernard Shaw (26 July 1856 – 2 November 1950), known at his insistence as Bernard Shaw, was an Irish playwright, critic, polemicist and political activist. His influence on Western theatre, culture and politics extended from the 1880s to his death and beyond. He wrote more than sixty plays, including major works such as &quot;Man and Superman&quot; (1902), &quot;Pygmalion&quot; (1913) and &quot;Saint Joan&quot; (1923). With a range incorporating both contemporary satire and historical allegory, Shaw became the leading dramatist of his generation, and in 1925 was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature.

Born in Dublin, in 1876 Shaw moved to London, where he struggled to establish himself as a writer and novelist, and embarked on a rigorous process of self-education. By the mid-1880s he had become a respected theatre and music critic. Following a political awakening, he joined the gradualist Fabian Society and became its most prominent pamphleteer. Shaw had been writing plays for years before his first public success, &quot;Arms and the Man&quot; in 1894. Influenced by Henrik Ibsen, he sought to introduce a new realism into English-language drama, using his plays as vehicles to disseminate his political, social and religious ideas. By the early twentieth century his reputation as a dramatist was secured with a series of critical and popular successes that included &quot;Major Barbara&quot;, &quot;The Doctor&#x27;s Dilemma&quot;, and &quot;Caesar and Cleopatra&quot;.

Shaw&#x27;s expressed views were often contentious; he promoted eugenics and alphabet reform, and opposed vaccination and organised religion. He courted unpopularity by denouncing both sides in the First World War as equally culpable, and although not a republican, castigated British policy on Ireland in the postwar period. These stances had no lasting effect on his standing or productivity as a dramatist; the inter-war years saw a series of often ambitious plays, which achieved varying degrees of popular success. In 1938 he provided the screenplay for a filmed version of &quot;Pygmalion&quot; for which he received an Academy Award. His appetite for politics and controversy remained undiminished; by the late 1920s, he had largely renounced Fabian Society gradualism, and often wrote and spoke favourably of dictatorships of the right and left—he expressed admiration for both Mussolini and Stalin. In the final decade of his life, he made fewer public statements but continued to write prolifically until shortly before his death, aged ninety-four, having refused all state honours, including the Order of Merit in 1946.

Since Shaw&#x27;s death scholarly and critical opinion about his works has varied, but he has regularly been rated among British dramatists as second only to Shakespeare; analysts recognise his extensive influence on generations of English-language playwrights. The word &quot;Shavian&quot; has entered the language as encapsulating Shaw&#x27;s ideas and his means of expressing them.

==Life==
===Early years===

Shaw was born at 3 Upper Synge Street in Portobello, a lower-middle-class part of Dublin. He was the youngest child and only son of George Carr Shaw and Lucinda Elizabeth (Bessie) Shaw (&quot;née&quot; Gurly). His elder siblings were Lucinda (Lucy) Frances and Elinor Agnes. The Shaw family was of English descent and belonged to the dominant Protestant Ascendancy in Ireland; George Carr Shaw, an ineffectual alcoholic, was among the family&#x27;s less successful members. His relatives secured him a sinecure in the civil service, from which he was pensioned off in the early 1850s; thereafter he worked irregularly as a corn merchant. In 1852 he married Bessie Gurly; in the view of Shaw&#x27;s biographer Michael Holroyd she married to escape a tyrannical great-aunt. If, as Holroyd and others surmise, George&#x27;s motives were mercenary, then he was disappointed, as Bessie brought him little of her family&#x27;s money. She came to despise her ineffectual and often drunken husband, with whom she shared what their son later described as a life of &quot;shabby-genteel poverty&quot;.

By the time of Shaw&#x27;s birth his mother had become close to George John Lee, a flamboyant figure well known in Dublin&#x27;s musical circles. Shaw retained a lifelong obsession that Lee might have been his biological father; there is no consensus among scholars on the likelihood of this. The young Shaw suffered no harshness from his mother, but he later recalled that her indifference and lack of affection hurt him deeply. He found solace in the music that abounded in the house. Lee was a conductor and teacher of singing; Bessie had a fine mezzo-soprano voice and was much influenced by Lee&#x27;s unorthodox method of vocal production. The Shaws&#x27; house was often filled with music, with frequent gatherings of singers and players.

In 1862 Lee and the Shaws agreed to share a house, No. 1 Hatch Street, in an affluent part of Dublin, and a country cottage on Dalkey Hill, overlooking Killiney Bay. Shaw, a sensitive boy, found the less salubrious parts of Dublin shocking and distressing, and was happier at the cottage. Lee&#x27;s students often gave him books, which the young Shaw read avidly; thus, as well as gaining a thorough musical knowledge of choral and operatic works, he became familiar with a wide spectrum of literature.

Between 1865 and 1871 Shaw attended four schools, all of which he hated. His experiences as a schoolboy left him disillusioned with formal education: &quot;Schools and schoolmasters&quot;, he later wrote, were &quot;prisons and turnkeys in which children are kept to prevent them disturbing and chaperoning their parents.&quot; In October 1871 he left school to become a junior clerk in a Dublin firm of land agents, where he worked hard, and quickly rose to become head cashier. During this period, Shaw was known as &quot;George Shaw&quot;; after 1876, he dropped the &quot;George&quot; and styled himself &quot;Bernard Shaw&quot;.

In June 1873 Lee left Dublin for London and never returned. A fortnight later, Bessie followed him; the two girls joined her. Shaw&#x27;s explanation of why his mother followed Lee was that without the latter&#x27;s financial contribution the joint household had to be broken up. Left in Dublin with his father, Shaw compensated for the absence of music in the house by teaching himself to play the piano.

===London===
Early in 1876 Shaw learned from his mother that Agnes was dying of tuberculosis. He resigned from the land agents, and in March travelled to England to join his mother and Lucy at Agnes&#x27;s funeral. He never again lived in Ireland, and did not visit it for twenty-nine years.

Initially, Shaw refused to seek clerical employment in London. His mother allowed him to live free of charge in her house in South Kensington, but he nevertheless needed an income. He had abandoned a teenage ambition to become a painter, and had not yet thought of writing for a living, but Lee found a little work for him, ghost-writing a musical column printed under Lee&#x27;s name in a satirical weekly, &quot;The Hornet&quot;. Lee&#x27;s relations with Bessie deteriorated after their move to London. Shaw maintained contact with Lee, who found him work as a rehearsal pianist and occasional singer.

Eventually Shaw was driven to applying for office jobs. In the interim he secured a reader&#x27;s pass for the British Museum Reading Room (the forerunner of the British Library) and spent most weekdays there, reading and writing. His first attempt at drama, begun in 1878, was a blank-verse satirical piece on a religious theme. It was abandoned unfinished, as was his first try at a novel. His first completed novel, &quot;Immaturity&quot; (1879), was too grim to appeal to publishers and did not appear until the 1930s. He was employed briefly by the newly formed Edison Telephone Company in 1879–80 and, as in Dublin, achieved rapid promotion. Nonetheless, when the Edison firm merged with the rival Bell Telephone Company, Shaw chose not to seek a place in the new organisation. Thereafter he pursued a full-time career as an author.

For the next four years Shaw made a negligible income from writing, and was subsidised by his mother. In 1881, for the sake of economy, and increasingly as a matter of principle, he became a vegetarian. In the same year he suffered an attack of smallpox; eventually he grew a beard to hide the resultant facial scar. In rapid succession he wrote two more novels: &quot;The Irrational Knot&quot; (1880) and &quot;Love Among the Artists&quot; (1881), but neither found a publisher; each was serialised a few years later in the socialist magazine &quot;Our Corner&quot;.

In 1880 Shaw began attending meetings of the Zetetical Society, whose objective was to &quot;search for truth in all matters affecting the interests of the human race&quot;. Here he met Sidney Webb, a junior civil servant who, like Shaw, was busy educating himself. Despite difference of style and temperament, the two quickly recognised qualities in each other and developed a lifelong friendship. Shaw later reflected: &quot;You knew everything that I didn&#x27;t know and I knew everything you didn&#x27;t know ... We had everything to learn from one another and brains enough to do it&quot;.

Shaw&#x27;s next attempt at drama was a one-act playlet in French, &quot;Un Petit Drame&quot;, written in 1884 but not published in his lifetime. In the same year the critic William Archer suggested a collaboration, with a plot by Archer and dialogue by Shaw. The project foundered, but Shaw returned to the draft as the basis of &quot;Widowers&#x27; Houses&quot; in 1892, and the connection with Archer proved of immense value to Shaw&#x27;s career.

===Political awakening: Marxism, socialism, Fabian Society===
On 5 September 1882 Shaw attended a meeting at the Memorial Hall, Farringdon, addressed by the political economist Henry George. Shaw then read George&#x27;s book &quot;Progress and Poverty&quot;, which awakened his interest in economics. He began attending meetings of the Social Democratic Federation (SDF), where he discovered the writings of Karl Marx, and thereafter spent much of 1883 reading &quot;Das Kapital&quot;. He was not impressed by the SDF&#x27;s founder, H. M. Hyndman, whom he found autocratic, ill-tempered and lacking leadership qualities. Shaw doubted the ability of the SDF to harness the working classes into an effective radical movement and did not join it—he preferred, he said, to work with his intellectual equals.

After reading a tract, &quot;Why Are The Many Poor?&quot;, issued by the recently formed Fabian Society, Shaw went to the society&#x27;s next advertised meeting, on 16 May 1884. He became a member in September, and before the year&#x27;s end had provided the society with its first manifesto, published as Fabian Tract No. 2. He joined the society&#x27;s executive committee in January 1885, and later that year recruited Webb and also Annie Besant, a fine orator.

From 1885 to 1889 Shaw attended the fortnightly meetings of the British Economic Association; it was, Holroyd observes, &quot;the closest Shaw had ever come to university education&quot;. This experience changed his political ideas; he moved away from Marxism and became an apostle of gradualism. When in 1886–87 the Fabians debated whether to embrace anarchism, as advocated by Charlotte Wilson, Besant and others, Shaw joined the majority in rejecting this approach. After a rally in Trafalgar Square addressed by Besant was violently broken up by the authorities on 13 November 1887 (&quot;Bloody Sunday&quot;), Shaw became convinced of the folly of attempting to challenge police power. Thereafter he largely accepted the principle of &quot;permeation&quot; as advocated by Webb: the notion whereby socialism could best be achieved by infiltration of people and ideas into existing political parties.

Throughout the 1880s the Fabian Society remained small, its message of moderation frequently unheard among more strident voices. Its profile was raised in 1889 with the publication of &quot;Fabian Essays in Socialism&quot;, edited by Shaw who also provided two of the essays. The second of these, &quot;Transition&quot;, details the case for gradualism and permeation, asserting that &quot;the necessity for cautious and gradual change must be obvious to everyone&quot;. In 1890 Shaw produced Tract No. 13, &quot;What Socialism Is&quot;, a revision of an earlier tract in which Charlotte Wilson had defined socialism in anarchistic terms. In Shaw&#x27;s new version, readers were assured that &quot;socialism can be brought about in a perfectly constitutional manner by democratic institutions&quot;.

===Novelist and critic===
The mid-1880s marked a turning point in Shaw&#x27;s life, both personally and professionally: he lost his virginity, had two novels published, and began a career as a critic. He had been celibate until his twenty-ninth birthday, when his shyness was overcome by Jane (Jenny) Patterson, a widow some years his senior. Their affair continued, not always smoothly, for eight years. Shaw&#x27;s sex life has caused much speculation and debate among his biographers, but there is a consensus that the relationship with Patterson was one of his few non-platonic romantic liaisons.

The published novels, neither commercially successful, were his two final efforts in this genre: &quot;Cashel Byron&#x27;s Profession&quot; written in 1882–83, and &quot;An Unsocial Socialist&quot;, begun and finished in 1883. The latter was published as a serial in &quot;To-Day&quot; magazine in 1884, although it did not appear in book form until 1887. &quot;Cashel Byron&quot; appeared in magazine and book form in 1886.

In 1884 and 1885, through the influence of Archer, Shaw was engaged to write book and music criticism for London papers. When Archer resigned as art critic of &quot;The World&quot; in 1886, he secured the succession for Shaw. The two figures in the contemporary art world whose views Shaw most admired were William Morris and John Ruskin, and he sought to follow their precepts in his criticisms. Their emphasis on morality appealed to Shaw, who rejected the idea of art for art&#x27;s sake, and insisted that all great art must be didactic.

Of Shaw&#x27;s various reviewing activities in the 1880s and 1890s it was as a music critic that he was best known. After serving as deputy in 1888, he became musical critic of &quot;The Star&quot; in February 1889, writing under the pen-name Corno di Bassetto. In May 1890 he moved back to &quot;The World&quot;, where he wrote a weekly column as &quot;G.B.S.&quot; for more than four years. In the 2016 version of the &quot;Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians&quot;, Robert Anderson writes, &quot;Shaw&#x27;s collected writings on music stand alone in their mastery of English and compulsive readability.&quot; Shaw ceased to be a salaried music critic in August 1894, but published occasional articles on the subject throughout his career, his last in 1950.

From 1895 to 1898, Shaw was the theatre critic for &quot;The Saturday Review&quot;, edited by his friend Frank Harris. As at &quot;The World&quot;, he used the by-line &quot;G.B.S.&quot; He campaigned against the artificial conventions and hypocrisies of the Victorian theatre and called for plays of real ideas and true characters. By this time he had embarked in earnest on a career as a playwright: &quot;I had rashly taken up the case; and rather than let it collapse I manufactured the evidence&quot;.

===Playwright and politician: 1890s===
After using the plot of the aborted 1884 collaboration with Archer to complete &quot;Widowers&#x27; Houses&quot; (it was staged twice in London, in December 1892), Shaw continued writing plays. At first he made slow progress; &quot;The Philanderer&quot;, written in 1893 but not published until 1898, had to wait until 1905 for a stage production. Similarly, &quot;Mrs Warren&#x27;s Profession&quot; (1893) was written five years before publication and nine years before reaching the stage.
Shaw&#x27;s first play to bring him financial success was &quot;Arms and the Man&quot; (1894), a mock-Ruritanian comedy satirising conventions of love, military honour and class. The press found the play overlong, and accused Shaw of mediocrity, sneering at heroism and patriotism, heartless cleverness, and copying W.S.Gilbert&#x27;s style. The public took a different view, and the management of the theatre staged extra matinée performances to meet the demand. The play ran from April to July, toured the provinces and was staged in New York. It earned him £341 in royalties in its first year, a sufficient sum to enable him to give up his salaried post as a music critic. Among the cast of the London production was Florence Farr, with whom Shaw had a romantic relationship between 1890 and 1894, much resented by Jenny Patterson.

The success of &quot;Arms and the Man&quot; was not immediately replicated. &quot;Candida&quot;, which presented a young woman making a conventional romantic choice for unconventional reasons, received a single performance in South Shields in 1895; in 1897 a playlet about Napoleon called &quot;The Man of Destiny&quot; had a single staging at Croydon. In the 1890s Shaw&#x27;s plays were better known in print than on the West End stage; his biggest success of the decade was in New York in 1897, when Richard Mansfield&#x27;s production of the historical melodrama &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Disciple&quot; earned the author more than £2,000 in royalties.

In January 1893, as a Fabian delegate, Shaw attended the Bradford conference which led to the foundation of the Independent Labour Party. He was sceptical about the new party, and scorned the likelihood that it could switch the allegiance of the working class from sport to politics. He persuaded the conference to adopt resolutions abolishing indirect taxation, and taxing unearned income &quot;to extinction&quot;. Back in London, Shaw produced what Margaret Cole, in her Fabian history, terms a &quot;grand philippic&quot; against the minority Liberal administration that had taken power in 1892. &quot;To Your Tents, O Israel!&quot; excoriated the government for ignoring social issues and concentrating solely on Irish Home Rule, a matter Shaw declared of no relevance to socialism. In 1894 the Fabian Society received a substantial bequest from a sympathiser, Henry Hunt Hutchinson—Holroyd mentions £10,000. Webb, who chaired the board of trustees appointed to supervise the legacy, proposed to use most of it to found a school of economics and politics. Shaw demurred; he thought such a venture was contrary to the specified purpose of the legacy. He was eventually persuaded to support the proposal, and the London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE) opened in the summer of 1895.

By the later 1890s Shaw&#x27;s political activities lessened as he concentrated on making his name as a dramatist. In 1897 he was persuaded to fill an uncontested vacancy for a &quot;vestryman&quot; (parish councillor) in London&#x27;s St Pancras district. At least initially, Shaw took to his municipal responsibilities seriously; when London government was reformed in 1899 and the St Pancras vestry became the Metropolitan Borough of St Pancras, he was elected to the newly formed borough council.

In 1898, as a result of overwork, Shaw&#x27;s health broke down. He was nursed by Charlotte Payne-Townshend, a rich Anglo-Irish woman whom he had met through the Webbs. The previous year she had proposed that she and Shaw should marry. He had declined, but when she insisted on nursing him in a house in the country, Shaw, concerned that this might cause scandal, agreed to their marriage. The ceremony took place on 1 June 1898, in the register office in Covent Garden. The bride and bridegroom were both aged forty-one. In the view of the biographer and critic St John Ervine, &quot;their life together was entirely felicitous&quot;. There were no children of the marriage, which it is generally believed was never consummated; whether this was wholly at Charlotte&#x27;s wish, as Shaw liked to suggest, is less widely credited. In the early weeks of the marriage Shaw was much occupied writing his Marxist analysis of Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Ring&quot; cycle, published as &quot;The Perfect Wagnerite&quot; late in 1898. In 1906 the Shaws found a country home in Ayot St Lawrence, Hertfordshire; they renamed the house &quot;Shaw&#x27;s Corner&quot;, and lived there for the rest of their lives. They retained a London flat in the Adelphi and later at Whitehall Court.

===Stage success: 1900–1914===

During the first decade of the twentieth century, Shaw secured a firm reputation as a playwright. In 1904 J. E. Vedrenne and Harley Granville-Barker established a company at the Royal Court Theatre in Sloane Square, Chelsea to present modern drama. Over the next five years they staged fourteen of Shaw&#x27;s plays. The first, &quot;John Bull&#x27;s Other Island&quot;, a comedy about an Englishman in Ireland, attracted leading politicians and was seen by Edward VII, who laughed so much that he broke his chair. The play was withheld from Dublin&#x27;s Abbey Theatre, for fear of the affront it might provoke, although it was shown at the city&#x27;s Royal Theatre in November 1907. Shaw later wrote that William Butler Yeats, who had requested the play, &quot;got rather more than he bargained for... It was uncongenial to the whole spirit of the neo-Gaelic movement, which is bent on creating a new Ireland after its own ideal, whereas my play is a very uncompromising presentment of the real old Ireland.&quot; Nonetheless, Shaw and Yeats were close friends; Yeats and Lady Gregory tried unsuccessfully to persuade Shaw to take up the vacant co-directorship of the Abbey Theatre after J. M. Synge&#x27;s death in 1909. Shaw admired other figures in the Irish Literary Revival, including George Russell and James Joyce, and was a close friend of Seán O&#x27;Casey, who was inspired to become a playwright after reading &quot;John Bull&#x27;s Other Island&quot;.

&quot;Man and Superman&quot;, completed in 1902, was a success both at the Royal Court in 1905 and in Robert Loraine&#x27;s New York production in the same year. Among the other Shaw works presented by Vedrenne and Granville-Barker were &quot;Major Barbara&quot; (1905), depicting the contrasting morality of arms manufacturers and the Salvation Army; &quot;The Doctor&#x27;s Dilemma&quot; (1906), a mostly serious piece about professional ethics; and &quot;Caesar and Cleopatra&quot;, Shaw&#x27;s counterblast to Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Antony and Cleopatra&quot;, seen in New York in 1906 and in London the following year.

Now prosperous and established, Shaw experimented with unorthodox theatrical forms described by his biographer Stanley Weintraub as &quot;discussion drama&quot; and &quot;serious farce&quot;. These plays included &quot;Getting Married&quot; (premiered 1908), &quot;The Shewing-Up of Blanco Posnet&quot; (1909), &quot;Misalliance&quot; (1910), and &quot;Fanny&#x27;s First Play&quot; (1911). &quot;Blanco Posnet&quot; was banned on religious grounds by the Lord Chamberlain (the official theatre censor in England), and was produced instead in Dublin; it filled the Abbey Theatre to capacity. &quot;Fanny&#x27;s First Play&quot;, a comedy about suffragettes, had the longest initial run of any Shaw play—622 performances.

&quot;Androcles and the Lion&quot; (1912), a less heretical study of true and false religious attitudes than &quot;Blanco Posnet&quot;, ran for eight weeks in September and October 1913. It was followed by one of Shaw&#x27;s most successful plays, &quot;Pygmalion&quot;, written in 1912 and staged in Vienna the following year, and in Berlin shortly afterwards. Shaw commented, &quot;It is the custom of the English press when a play of mine is produced, to inform the world that it is not a play—that it is dull, blasphemous, unpopular, and financially unsuccessful. ... Hence arose an urgent demand on the part of the managers of Vienna and Berlin that I should have my plays performed by them first.&quot; The British production opened in April 1914, starring Sir Herbert Tree and Mrs Patrick Campbell as, respectively, a professor of phonetics and a cockney flower-girl. There had earlier been a romantic liaison between Shaw and Campbell that caused Charlotte Shaw considerable concern, but by the time of the London premiere it had ended. The play attracted capacity audiences until July, when Tree insisted on going on holiday, and the production closed. His co-star then toured with the piece in the US.

===Fabian years: 1900–1913===

In 1899, when the Boer War began, Shaw wished the Fabians to take a neutral stance on what he deemed, like Home Rule, to be a &quot;non-Socialist&quot; issue. Others, including the future Labour prime minister Ramsay MacDonald, wanted unequivocal opposition, and resigned from the society when it followed Shaw. In the Fabians&#x27; war manifesto, &quot;Fabianism and the Empire&quot; (1900), Shaw declared that &quot;until the Federation of the World becomes an accomplished fact we must accept the most responsible Imperial federations available as a substitute for it&quot;.

As the new century began, Shaw became increasingly disillusioned by the limited impact of the Fabians on national politics. Thus, although a nominated Fabian delegate, he did not attend the London conference at the Memorial Hall, Farringdon Street in February 1900, that created the Labour Representation Committee—precursor of the modern Labour Party. By 1903, when his term as borough councillor expired, he had lost his earlier enthusiasm, writing: &quot;After six years of Borough Councilling I am convinced that the borough councils should be abolished&quot;. Nevertheless, in 1904 he stood in the London County Council elections. After an eccentric campaign, which Holroyd characterises as &quot;[making] absolutely certain of not getting in&quot;, he was duly defeated. It was Shaw&#x27;s final foray into electoral politics. Nationally, the 1906 general election produced a huge Liberal majority and an intake of 29 Labour members. Shaw viewed this outcome with scepticism; he had a low opinion of the new prime minister, Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman, and saw the Labour members as inconsequential: &quot;I apologise to the Universe for my connection with such a body&quot;.

In the years after the 1906 election, Shaw felt that the Fabians needed fresh leadership, and saw this in the form of his fellow-writer H. G. Wells, who had joined the society in February 1903. Wells&#x27;s ideas for reform—particularly his proposals for closer cooperation with the Independent Labour Party—placed him at odds with the society&#x27;s &quot;Old Gang&quot;, led by Shaw. According to Cole, Wells &quot;had minimal capacity for putting [his ideas] across in public meetings against Shaw&#x27;s trained and practised virtuosity&quot;. In Shaw&#x27;s view, &quot;the Old Gang did not extinguish Mr Wells, he annihilated himself&quot;. Wells resigned from the society in September 1908; Shaw remained a member, but left the executive in April 1911. He later wondered whether the Old Gang should have given way to Wells some years earlier: &quot;God only knows whether the Society had not better have done it&quot;. Although less active—he blamed his advancing years—Shaw remained a Fabian.

In 1912 Shaw invested £1,000 for a one-fifth share in the Webbs&#x27; new publishing venture, a socialist weekly magazine called &quot;The New Statesman&quot;, which appeared in April 1913. He became a founding director, publicist, and in due course a contributor, mostly anonymously. He was soon at odds with the magazine&#x27;s editor, Clifford Sharp, who by 1916 was rejecting his contributions—&quot;the only paper in the world that refuses to print anything by me&quot;, according to Shaw.

===First World War===

After the First World War began in August 1914, Shaw produced his tract &quot;Common Sense About the War&quot;, which argued that the warring nations were equally culpable. Such a view was anathema in an atmosphere of fervent patriotism, and offended many of Shaw&#x27;s friends; Ervine records that &quot;[h]is appearance at any public function caused the instant departure of many of those present.&quot;

Despite his errant reputation, Shaw&#x27;s propagandist skills were recognised by the British authorities, and early in 1917 he was invited by Field Marshal Haig to visit the Western Front battlefields. Shaw&#x27;s 10,000-word report, which emphasised the human aspects of the soldier&#x27;s life, was well received, and he became less of a lone voice. In April 1917 he joined the national consensus in welcoming America&#x27;s entry into the war: &quot;a first class moral asset to the common cause against junkerism&quot;.

Three short plays by Shaw were premiered during the war. &quot;The Inca of Perusalem&quot;, written in 1915, encountered problems with the censor for burlesquing not only the enemy but the British military command; it was performed in 1916 at the Birmingham Repertory Theatre. &quot;O&#x27;Flaherty V.C.&quot;, satirising the government&#x27;s attitude to Irish recruits, was banned in the UK and was presented at a Royal Flying Corps base in Belgium in 1917. &quot;Augustus Does His Bit&quot;, a genial farce, was granted a licence; it opened at the Royal Court in January 1917.

===Ireland===

Shaw had long supported the principle of Irish Home Rule within the British Empire (which he thought should become the British Commonwealth). In April 1916 he wrote scathingly in &quot;The New York Times&quot; about militant Irish nationalism: &quot;In point of learning nothing and forgetting nothing these fellow-patriots of mine leave the Bourbons nowhere.&quot; Total independence, he asserted, was impractical; alliance with a bigger power (preferably England) was essential. The Dublin Easter Rising later that month took him by surprise. After its suppression by British forces, he expressed horror at the summary execution of the rebel leaders, but continued to believe in some form of Anglo-Irish union. In &quot;How to Settle the Irish Question&quot; (1917), he envisaged a federal arrangement, with national and imperial parliaments. Holroyd records that by this time the separatist party Sinn Féin was in the ascendency, and Shaw&#x27;s and other moderate schemes were forgotten.

In the postwar period, Shaw despaired of the British government&#x27;s coercive policies towards Ireland, and joined his fellow-writers Hilaire Belloc and G. K. Chesterton in publicly condemning these actions. The Anglo-Irish Treaty of December 1921 led to the partition of Ireland between north and south, a provision that dismayed Shaw. In 1922 civil war broke out in the south between its pro-treaty and anti-treaty factions, the former of whom had established the Irish Free State. Shaw visited Dublin in August, and met Michael Collins, then head of the Free State&#x27;s Provisional Government. Shaw was much impressed by Collins, and was saddened when, three days later, the Irish leader was ambushed and killed by anti-treaty forces. In a letter to Collins&#x27;s sister, Shaw wrote: &quot;I met Michael for the first and last time on Saturday last, and am very glad I did. I rejoice in his memory, and will not be so disloyal to it as to snivel over his valiant death&quot;. Shaw remained a British subject all his life, but took dual British-Irish nationality in 1934.

===1920s===

Shaw&#x27;s first major work to appear after the war was &quot;Heartbreak House&quot;, written in 1916–17 and performed in 1920. It was produced on Broadway in November, and was coolly received; according to &quot;The Times&quot;: &quot;Mr Shaw on this occasion has more than usual to say and takes twice as long as usual to say it&quot;. After the London premiere in October 1921 &quot;The Times&quot; concurred with the American critics: &quot;As usual with Mr Shaw, the play is about an hour too long&quot;, although containing &quot;much entertainment and some profitable reflection&quot;. Ervine in &quot;The Observer&quot; thought the play brilliant but ponderously acted, except for Edith Evans as Lady Utterword.

Shaw&#x27;s largest-scale theatrical work was &quot;Back to Methuselah&quot;, written in 1918–20 and staged in 1922. Weintraub describes it as &quot;Shaw&#x27;s attempt to fend off &#x27;the bottomless pit of an utterly discouraging pessimism&#x27;&quot;. This cycle of five interrelated plays depicts evolution, and the effects of longevity, from the Garden of Eden to the year 31,920 AD. Critics found the five plays strikingly uneven in quality and invention. The original run was brief, and the work has been revived infrequently. Shaw felt he had exhausted his remaining creative powers in the huge span of this &quot;Metabiological Pentateuch&quot;. He was now sixty-seven, and expected to write no more plays.

This mood was short-lived. In 1920 Joan of Arc was proclaimed a saint by Pope Benedict XV; Shaw had long found Joan an interesting historical character, and his view of her veered between &quot;half-witted genius&quot; and someone of &quot;exceptional sanity&quot;. He had considered writing a play about her in 1913, and the canonisation prompted him to return to the subject. He wrote &quot;Saint Joan&quot; in the middle months of 1923, and the play was premiered on Broadway in December. It was enthusiastically received there, and at its London premiere the following March. In Weintraub&#x27;s phrase, &quot;even the Nobel prize committee could no longer ignore Shaw after Saint Joan&quot;. The citation for the literature prize for 1925 praised his work as &quot;... marked by both idealism and humanity, its stimulating satire often being infused with a singular poetic beauty&quot;. He accepted the award, but rejected the monetary prize that went with it, on the grounds that &quot;My readers and my audiences provide me with more than sufficient money for my needs&quot;.

After &quot;Saint Joan&quot;, it was five years before Shaw wrote a play. From 1924, he spent four years writing what he described as his &quot;magnum opus&quot;, a political treatise entitled &quot;The Intelligent Woman&#x27;s Guide to Socialism and Capitalism&quot;. The book was published in 1928 and sold well. At the end of the decade Shaw produced his final Fabian tract, a commentary on the League of Nations. He described the League as &quot;a school for the new international statesmanship as against the old Foreign Office diplomacy&quot;, but thought that it had not yet become the &quot;Federation of the World&quot;.

Shaw returned to the theatre with what he called &quot;a political extravaganza&quot;, &quot;The Apple Cart&quot;, written in late 1928. It was, in Ervine&#x27;s view, unexpectedly popular, taking a conservative, monarchist, anti-democratic line that appealed to contemporary audiences. The premiere was in Warsaw in June 1928, and the first British production was two months later, at Sir Barry Jackson&#x27;s inaugural Malvern Festival. The other eminent creative artist most closely associated with the festival was Sir Edward Elgar, with whom Shaw enjoyed a deep friendship and mutual regard. He described &quot;The Apple Cart&quot; to Elgar as &quot;a scandalous Aristophanic burlesque of democratic politics, with a brief but shocking sex interlude&quot;.

During the 1920s Shaw began to lose faith in the idea that society could be changed through Fabian gradualism, and became increasingly fascinated with dictatorial methods. In 1922 he had welcomed Mussolini&#x27;s accession to power in Italy, observing that amid the &quot;indiscipline and muddle and Parliamentary deadlock&quot;, Mussolini was &quot;the right kind of tyrant&quot;. Shaw was prepared to tolerate certain dictatorial excesses; Weintraub in his ODNB biographical sketch comments that Shaw&#x27;s &quot;flirtation with authoritarian inter-war regimes&quot; took a long time to fade, and Beatrice Webb thought he was &quot;obsessed&quot; about Mussolini.

===1930s===

Shaw&#x27;s enthusiasm for the Soviet Union dated to the early 1920s when he had hailed Lenin as &quot;the one really interesting statesman in Europe&quot;. Having turned down several chances to visit, in 1931 he joined a party led by Nancy Astor. The carefully managed trip culminated in a lengthy meeting with Stalin, whom Shaw later described as &quot;a Georgian gentleman&quot; with no malice in him. At a dinner given in his honour, Shaw told the gathering: &quot;I have seen all the &#x27;terrors&#x27; and I was terribly pleased by them&quot;. In March 1933, he was a co-signatory to a letter in &quot;The Manchester Guardian&quot; protesting at the continuing misrepresentation of Soviet achievements: &quot;No lie is too fantastic, no slander is too stale ... for employment by the more reckless elements of the British press.&quot;

Shaw&#x27;s admiration for Mussolini and Stalin demonstrated his growing belief that dictatorship was the only viable political arrangement. When the Nazi Party came to power in Germany in January 1933, Shaw described Hitler as &quot;a very remarkable man, a very able man&quot;, and professed himself proud to be the only writer in England who was &quot;scrupulously polite and just to Hitler&quot;; though his principal admiration was for Stalin, whose regime he championed uncritically throughout the decade. Shaw saw the 1939 Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact as a triumph for Stalin who, he said, now had Hitler under his thumb.

Shaw&#x27;s first play of the decade was &quot;Too True to Be Good&quot;, written in 1931 and premiered in Boston in February 1932. The reception was unenthusiastic. Brooks Atkinson of &quot;The New York Times&quot; commenting that Shaw had &quot;yielded to the impulse to write without having a subject&quot;, judged the play a &quot;rambling and indifferently tedious conversation&quot;. The correspondent of the &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot; said that most of the play was &quot;discourse, unbelievably long lectures&quot; and that although the audience enjoyed the play it was bewildered by it.

During the decade Shaw travelled widely and frequently. Most of his journeys were with Charlotte; she enjoyed voyages on ocean liners, and he found peace to write during the long spells at sea. Shaw met an enthusiastic welcome in South Africa in 1932, despite his strong remarks about the racial divisions of the country. In December 1932 the couple embarked on a round-the-world cruise. In March 1933 they arrived at San Francisco, to begin Shaw&#x27;s first visit to the US. He had earlier refused to go to &quot;that awful country, that uncivilized place&quot;, &quot;unfit to govern itself... illiberal, superstitious, crude, violent, anarchic and arbitrary&quot;. He visited Hollywood, with which he was unimpressed, and New York, where he lectured to a capacity audience in the Metropolitan Opera House. Harried by the intrusive attentions of the press, Shaw was glad when his ship sailed from New York harbour. New Zealand, which he and Charlotte visited the following year, struck him as &quot;the best country I&#x27;ve been in&quot;; he urged its people to be more confident and loosen their dependence on trade with Britain. He used the weeks at sea to complete two plays—&quot;The Simpleton of the Unexpected Isles&quot; and &quot;The Six of Calais&quot;—and begin work on a third, &quot;The Millionairess&quot;.

Despite his contempt for Hollywood and its aesthetic values, Shaw was enthusiastic about cinema, and in the middle of the decade wrote screenplays for prospective film versions of &quot;Pygmalion&quot; and &quot;Saint Joan&quot;. The latter was never made, but Shaw entrusted the rights to the former to the unknown Gabriel Pascal, who produced it at Pinewood Studios in 1938. Shaw was determined that Hollywood should have nothing to do with the film, but was powerless to keep it from winning one Academy Award (&quot;Oscar&quot;); he described his award for &quot;best-written screenplay&quot; as an insult, coming from such a source. He became the first person to have been awarded both a Nobel Prize and an Oscar. In a 1993 study of the Oscars, Anthony Holden observes that &quot;Pygmalion&quot; was soon spoken of as having &quot;lifted movie-making from illiteracy to literacy&quot;.

Shaw&#x27;s final plays of the 1930s were &quot;Cymbeline Refinished&quot; (1936), &quot;Geneva&quot; (1936) and &quot;In Good King Charles&#x27;s Golden Days&quot; (1939). The first, a fantasy reworking of Shakespeare, made little impression, but the second, a satire on European dictators, attracted more notice, much of it unfavourable. In particular, Shaw&#x27;s parody of Hitler as &quot;Herr Battler&quot; was considered mild, almost sympathetic. The third play, an historical conversation piece first seen at Malvern, ran briefly in London in May 1940. James Agate commented that the play contained nothing to which even the most conservative audiences could take exception, and though it was long and lacking in dramatic action only &quot;witless and idle&quot; theatregoers would object. After their first runs none of the three plays were seen again in the West End during Shaw&#x27;s lifetime.

Towards the end of the decade, both Shaws began to suffer ill health. Charlotte was increasingly incapacitated by Paget&#x27;s disease of bone, and he developed pernicious anaemia. His treatment, involving injections of concentrated animal liver, was successful, but this breach of his vegetarian creed distressed him and brought down condemnation from militant vegetarians.

===Second World War and final years===
Although Shaw&#x27;s works since &quot;The Apple Cart&quot; had been received without great enthusiasm, his earlier plays were revived in the West End throughout the Second World War, starring such actors as Edith Evans, John Gielgud, Deborah Kerr and Robert Donat. In 1944 nine Shaw plays were staged in London, including &quot;Arms and the Man&quot; with Ralph Richardson, Laurence Olivier, Sybil Thorndike and Margaret Leighton in the leading roles. Two touring companies took his plays all round Britain. The revival in his popularity did not tempt Shaw to write a new play, and he concentrated on prolific journalism. A second Shaw film produced by Pascal, &quot;Major Barbara&quot; (1941), was less successful both artistically and commercially than &quot;Pygmalion&quot;, partly because of Pascal&#x27;s insistence on directing, to which he was unsuited.

Following the outbreak of war on 3 September 1939 and the rapid conquest of Poland, Shaw was accused of defeatism when, in a &quot;New Statesman&quot; article, he declared the war over and demanded a peace conference. Nevertheless, when he became convinced that a negotiated peace was impossible, he publicly urged the neutral United States to join the fight. The London blitz of 1940–41 led the Shaws, both in their mid-eighties, to live full-time at Ayot St Lawrence. Even there they were not immune from enemy air raids, and stayed on occasion with Nancy Astor at her country house, Cliveden. In 1943, the worst of the London bombing over, the Shaws moved back to Whitehall Court, where medical help for Charlotte was more easily arranged. Her condition deteriorated, and she died in September.

Shaw&#x27;s final political treatise, &quot;Everybody&#x27;s Political What&#x27;s What&quot;, was published in 1944. Holroyd describes this as &quot;a rambling narrative ... that repeats ideas he had given better elsewhere and then repeats itself&quot;. The book sold well—85,000 copies by the end of the year. After Hitler&#x27;s suicide in May 1945, Shaw approved of the formal condolences offered by the Irish Taoiseach, Éamon de Valera, at the German embassy in Dublin. Shaw disapproved of the postwar trials of the defeated German leaders, as an act of self-righteousness: &quot;We are all potential criminals&quot;.

Pascal was given a third opportunity to film Shaw&#x27;s work with &quot;Caesar and Cleopatra&quot; (1945). It cost three times its original budget and was rated &quot;the biggest financial failure in the history of British cinema&quot;. The film was poorly received by British critics, although American reviews were friendlier. Shaw thought its lavishness nullified the drama, and he considered the film &quot;a poor imitation of Cecil B. de Mille&quot;.

In 1946, the year of Shaw&#x27;s ninetieth birthday, he accepted the freedom of Dublin and became the first honorary freeman of the borough of St Pancras, London. In the same year the British government asked Shaw informally whether he would accept the Order of Merit. He declined, believing that an author&#x27;s merit could only be determined by the posthumous verdict of history. 1946 saw the publication, as &quot;The Crime of Imprisonment&quot;, of the preface Shaw had written 20 years previously to a study of prison conditions. It was widely praised; a reviewer in the &quot;American Journal of Public Health&quot; considered it essential reading for any student of the American criminal justice system.

Shaw continued to write into his nineties. His last plays were &quot;Buoyant Billions&quot; (1947), his final full-length work; &quot;Farfetched Fables&quot; (1948) a set of six short plays revisiting several of his earlier themes such as evolution; a comic play for puppets, &quot;Shakes versus Shav&quot; (1949), a ten-minute piece in which Shakespeare and Shaw trade insults; and &quot;Why She Would Not&quot; (1950), which Shaw described as &quot;a little comedy&quot;, written in one week shortly before his ninety-fourth birthday.

During his later years, Shaw enjoyed tending the gardens at Shaw&#x27;s Corner. He died at the age of 94 of renal failure precipitated by injuries incurred when falling while pruning a tree. He was cremated at Golders Green Crematorium on 6 November 1950. His ashes, mixed with those of Charlotte, were scattered along footpaths and around the statue of Saint Joan in their garden.

==Works==
===Plays===
Shaw published a collected edition of his plays in 1934, comprising forty-two works. He wrote a further twelve in the remaining sixteen years of his life, mostly one-act pieces. Including eight earlier plays that he chose to omit from his published works, the total is sixty-two.

====Early works====
Shaw&#x27;s first three full-length plays dealt with social issues. He later grouped them as &quot;Plays Unpleasant&quot;. &quot;Widowers&#x27; Houses&quot; (1892) concerns the landlords of slum properties, and introduces the first of Shaw&#x27;s New Women—a recurring feature of later plays. &quot;The Philanderer&quot; (1893) develops the theme of the New Woman, draws on Ibsen, and has elements of Shaw&#x27;s personal relationships, the character of Julia being based on Jenny Patterson. In a 2003 study Judith Evans describes &quot;Mrs Warren&#x27;s Profession&quot; (1893) as &quot;undoubtedly the most challenging&quot; of the three Plays Unpleasant, taking Mrs Warren&#x27;s profession—prostitute and, later, brothel-owner—as a metaphor for a prostituted society.

Shaw followed the first trilogy with a second, published as &quot;Plays Pleasant&quot;. &quot;Arms and the Man&quot; (1894) conceals beneath a mock-Ruritanian comic romance a Fabian parable contrasting impractical idealism with pragmatic socialism. The central theme of &quot;Candida&quot; (1894) is a woman&#x27;s choice between two men; the play contrasts the outlook and aspirations of a Christian Socialist and a poetic idealist. The third of the Pleasant group, &quot;You Never Can Tell&quot; (1896), portrays social mobility, and the gap between generations, particularly in how they approach social relations in general and mating in particular.

The &quot;Three Plays for Puritans&quot;—comprising &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Disciple&quot; (1896), &quot;Caesar and Cleopatra&quot; (1898) and &quot;Captain Brassbound&#x27;s Conversion&quot; (1899)—all centre on questions of empire and imperialism, a major topic of political discourse in the 1890s. The three are set, respectively, in 1770s America, Ancient Egypt, and 1890s Morocco. &quot;The Gadfly&quot;, an adaptation of the popular novel by Ethel Voynich, was unfinished and unperformed. &quot;The Man of Destiny&quot; (1895) is a short curtain raiser about Napoleon.

====1900–1909====
Shaw&#x27;s major plays of the first decade of the twentieth century address individual social, political or ethical issues. &quot;Man and Superman&quot; (1902) stands apart from the others in both its subject and its treatment, giving Shaw&#x27;s interpretation of creative evolution in a combination of drama and associated printed text. &quot;The Admirable Bashville&quot; (1901), a blank verse dramatisation of Shaw&#x27;s novel &quot;Cashel Byron&#x27;s Profession&quot;, focuses on the imperial relationship between Britain and Africa. &quot;John Bull&#x27;s Other Island&quot; (1904), comically depicting the prevailing relationship between Britain and Ireland, was popular at the time but fell out of the general repertoire in later years. &quot;Major Barbara&quot; (1905) presents ethical questions in an unconventional way, confounding expectations that in the depiction of an armaments manufacturer on the one hand and the Salvation Army on the other the moral high ground must invariably be held by the latter. &quot;The Doctor&#x27;s Dilemma&quot; (1906), a play about medical ethics and moral choices in allocating scarce treatment, was described by Shaw as a tragedy. With a reputation for presenting characters who did not resemble real flesh and blood, he was challenged by Archer to present an on-stage death, and here did so, with a deathbed scene for the anti-hero.

&quot;Getting Married&quot; (1908) and &quot;Misalliance&quot; (1909)—the latter seen by Judith Evans as a companion piece to the former—are both in what Shaw called his &quot;disquisitionary&quot; vein, with the emphasis on discussion of ideas rather than on dramatic events or vivid characterisation. Shaw wrote seven short plays during the decade; they are all comedies, ranging from the deliberately absurd &quot;Passion, Poison, and Petrifaction&quot; (1905) to the satirical &quot;Press Cuttings&quot; (1909).

====1910–1919====
In the decade from 1910 to the aftermath of the First World War Shaw wrote four full-length plays, the third and fourth of which are among his most frequently staged works. &quot;Fanny&#x27;s First Play&quot; (1911) continues his earlier examinations of middle-class British society from a Fabian viewpoint, with additional touches of melodrama and an epilogue in which theatre critics discuss the play. &quot;Androcles and the Lion&quot; (1912), which Shaw began writing as a play for children, became a study of the nature of religion and how to put Christian precepts into practice. &quot;Pygmalion&quot; (1912) is a Shavian study of language and speech and their importance in society and in personal relationships. To correct the impression left by the original performers that the play portrayed a romantic relationship between the two main characters Shaw rewrote the ending to make it clear that the heroine will marry another, minor character. Shaw&#x27;s only full-length play from the war years is &quot;Heartbreak House&quot; (1917), which in his words depicts &quot;cultured, leisured Europe before the war&quot; drifting towards disaster. Shaw named Shakespeare (&quot;King Lear&quot;) and Chekhov (&quot;The Cherry Orchard&quot;) as important influences on the piece, and critics have found elements drawing on Congreve (&quot;The Way of the World&quot;) and Ibsen (&quot;The Master Builder&quot;).

The short plays range from genial historical drama in &quot;The Dark Lady of the Sonnets&quot; and &quot;Great Catherine&quot; (1910 and 1913) to a study of polygamy in &quot;Overruled&quot;; three satirical works about the war (&quot;The Inca of Perusalem&quot;, &quot;O&#x27;Flaherty V.C.&quot; and &quot;Augustus Does His Bit&quot;, 1915–16); a piece that Shaw called &quot;utter nonsense&quot; (&quot;The Music Cure&quot;, 1914) and a brief sketch about a &quot;Bolshevik empress&quot; (&quot;Annajanska&quot;, 1917).

====1920–1950====

&quot;Saint Joan&quot; (1923) drew widespread praise both for Shaw and for Sybil Thorndike, for whom he wrote the title role and who created the part in Britain. In the view of the commentator Nicholas Grene, Shaw&#x27;s Joan, a &quot;no-nonsense mystic, Protestant and nationalist before her time&quot; is among the 20th century&#x27;s classic leading female roles. &quot;The Apple Cart&quot; (1929) was Shaw&#x27;s last popular success. He gave both that play and its successor, &quot;Too True to Be Good&quot; (1931), the subtitle &quot;A political extravaganza&quot;, although the two works differ greatly in their themes; the first presents the politics of a nation (with a brief royal love-scene as an interlude) and the second, in Judith Evans&#x27;s words, &quot;is concerned with the social mores of the individual, and is nebulous.&quot; Shaw&#x27;s plays of the 1930s were written in the shadow of worsening national and international political events. Once again, with &quot;On the Rocks&quot; (1933) and &quot;The Simpleton of the Unexpected Isles&quot; (1934), a political comedy with a clear plot was followed by an introspective drama. The first play portrays a British prime minister considering, but finally rejecting, the establishment of a dictatorship; the second is concerned with polygamy and eugenics and ends with the Day of Judgement.

&quot;The Millionairess&quot; (1934) is a farcical depiction of the commercial and social affairs of a successful businesswoman. &quot;Geneva&quot; (1936) lampoons the feebleness of the League of Nations compared with the dictators of Europe. &quot;In Good King Charles&#x27;s Golden Days&quot; (1939), described by Weintraub as a warm, discursive high comedy, also depicts authoritarianism, but less satirically than &quot;Geneva&quot;. As in earlier decades, the shorter plays were generally comedies, some historical and others addressing various political and social preoccupations of the author. Ervine writes of Shaw&#x27;s later work that although it was still &quot;astonishingly vigorous and vivacious&quot; it showed unmistakable signs of his age. &quot;The best of his work in this period, however, was full of wisdom and the beauty of mind often displayed by old men who keep their wits about them.&quot;

===Music and drama reviews===

====Music====
Shaw&#x27;s collected musical criticism, published in three volumes, runs to more than 2,700 pages. It covers the British musical scene from 1876 to 1950, but the core of the collection dates from his six years as music critic of &quot;The Star&quot; and &quot;The World&quot; in the late 1880s and early 1890s. In his view music criticism should be interesting to everyone rather than just the musical élite, and he wrote for the non-specialist, avoiding technical jargon—&quot;Mesopotamian words like &#x27;the dominant of D major&#x27;&quot;. He was fiercely partisan in his columns, promoting the music of Wagner and decrying that of Brahms and those British composers such as Stanford and Parry whom he saw as Brahmsian. He campaigned against the prevailing fashion for performances of Handel oratorios with huge amateur choirs and inflated orchestration, calling for &quot;a chorus of twenty capable artists&quot;. He railed against opera productions unrealistically staged or sung in languages the audience did not speak.

====Drama====
In Shaw&#x27;s view, the London theatres of the 1890s presented too many revivals of old plays and not enough new work. He campaigned against &quot;melodrama, sentimentality, stereotypes and worn-out conventions&quot;. As a music critic he had frequently been able to concentrate on analysing new works, but in the theatre he was often obliged to fall back on discussing how various performers tackled well-known plays. In a study of Shaw&#x27;s work as a theatre critic, E. J. West writes that Shaw &quot;ceaselessly compared and contrasted artists in interpretation and in technique&quot;. Shaw contributed more than 150 articles as theatre critic for &quot;The Saturday Review&quot;, in which he assessed more than 212 productions. He championed Ibsen&#x27;s plays when many theatregoers regarded them as outrageous, and his 1891 book &quot;Quintessence of Ibsenism&quot; remained a classic throughout the twentieth century. Of contemporary dramatists writing for the West End stage he rated Oscar Wilde above the rest: &quot;... our only thorough playwright. He plays with everything: with wit, with philosophy, with drama, with actors and audience, with the whole theatre&quot;. Shaw&#x27;s collected criticisms were published as &quot;Our Theatres in the Nineties&quot; in 1932.

Shaw maintained a provocative and frequently self-contradictory attitude to Shakespeare (whose name he insisted on spelling &quot;Shakespear&quot;). Many found him difficult to take seriously on the subject; Duff Cooper observed that by attacking Shakespeare, &quot;it is Shaw who appears a ridiculous pigmy shaking his fist at a mountain.&quot; Shaw was, nevertheless, a knowledgeable Shakespearian, and in an article in which he wrote, &quot;With the single exception of Homer, there is no eminent writer, not even Sir Walter Scott, whom I can despise so entirely as I despise Shakespear when I measure my mind against his,&quot; he also said, &quot;But I am bound to add that I pity the man who cannot enjoy Shakespear. He has outlasted thousands of abler thinkers, and will outlast a thousand more&quot;. Shaw had two regular targets for his more extreme comments about Shakespeare: undiscriminating &quot;Bardolaters&quot;, and actors and directors who presented insensitively cut texts in over-elaborate productions. He was continually drawn back to Shakespeare, and wrote three plays with Shakespearean themes: &quot;The Dark Lady of the Sonnets&quot;, &quot;Cymbeline Refinished&quot; and &quot;Shakes versus Shav&quot;. In a 2001 analysis of Shaw&#x27;s Shakespearian criticisms, Robert Pierce concludes that Shaw, who was no academic, saw Shakespeare&#x27;s plays—like all theatre—from an author&#x27;s practical point of view: &quot;Shaw helps us to get away from the Romantics&#x27; picture of Shakespeare as a titanic genius, one whose art cannot be analyzed or connected with the mundane considerations of theatrical conditions and profit and loss, or with a specific staging and cast of actors.&quot;

===Political and social writings===
Shaw&#x27;s political and social commentaries were published variously in Fabian tracts, in essays, in two full-length books, in innumerable newspaper and journal articles and in prefaces to his plays. The majority of Shaw&#x27;s Fabian tracts were published anonymously, representing the voice of the society rather than of Shaw, although the society&#x27;s secretary Edward Pease later confirmed Shaw&#x27;s authorship. According to Holroyd, the business of the early Fabians, mainly under the influence of Shaw, was to &quot;alter history by rewriting it&quot;. Shaw&#x27;s talent as a pamphleteer was put to immediate use in the production of the society&#x27;s manifesto—after which, says Holroyd, he was never again so succinct.

After the turn of the twentieth century, Shaw increasingly propagated his ideas through the medium of his plays. An early critic, writing in 1904, observed that Shaw&#x27;s dramas provided &quot;a pleasant means&quot; of proselytising his socialism, adding that &quot;Mr Shaw&#x27;s views are to be sought especially in the prefaces to his plays&quot;. After loosening his ties with the Fabian movement in 1911, Shaw&#x27;s writings were more personal and often provocative; his response to the furore following the issue of &quot;Common Sense About the War&quot; in 1914, was to prepare a sequel, &quot;More Common Sense About the War&quot;. In this, he denounced the pacifist line espoused by Ramsay MacDonald and other socialist leaders, and proclaimed his readiness to shoot all pacifists rather than cede them power and influence. On the advice of Beatrice Webb, this pamphlet remained unpublished.

&quot;The Intelligent Woman&#x27;s Guide&quot;, Shaw&#x27;s main political treatise of the 1920s, attracted both admiration and criticism. MacDonald considered it the world&#x27;s most important book since the Bible; Harold Laski thought its arguments outdated and lacking in concern for individual freedoms. Shaw&#x27;s increasing flirtation with dictatorial methods is evident in many of his subsequent pronouncements. A &quot;New York Times&quot; report dated 10 December 1933 quoted a recent Fabian Society lecture in which Shaw had praised Hitler, Mussolini and Stalin: &quot;[T]hey are trying to get something done, [and] are adopting methods by which it is possible to get something done&quot;. As late as the Second World War, in &quot;Everybody&#x27;s Political What&#x27;s What&quot;, Shaw blamed the Allies&#x27; &quot;abuse&quot; of their 1918 victory for the rise of Hitler, and hoped that, after defeat, the Führer would escape retribution &quot;to enjoy a comfortable retirement in Ireland or some other neutral country&quot;. These sentiments, according to the Irish philosopher-poet Thomas Duddy, &quot;rendered much of the Shavian outlook passé and contemptible&quot;.

&quot;Creative evolution&quot;, Shaw&#x27;s version of the new science of eugenics, became an increasing theme in his political writing after 1900. He introduced his theories in &quot;The Revolutionist&#x27;s Handbook&quot; (1903), an appendix to &quot;Man and Superman&quot;, and developed them further during the 1920s in &quot;Back to Methuselah&quot;. A 1946 &quot;Life&quot; magazine article observed that Shaw had &quot;always tended to look at people more as a biologist than as an artist&quot;. By 1933, in the preface to &quot;On the Rocks&quot;, he was writing that &quot;if we desire a certain type of civilization and culture we must exterminate the sort of people who do not fit into it&quot;; critical opinion is divided on whether this was intended as irony. In an article in the American magazine &quot;Liberty&quot; in September 1938, Shaw included the statement: &quot;There are many people in the world who ought to be liquidated&quot;. Many commentators assumed that such comments were intended as a joke, although in the worst possible taste. Otherwise, &quot;Life&quot; magazine concluded, &quot;this silliness can be classed with his more innocent bad guesses&quot;.

===Fiction===
Shaw&#x27;s fiction-writing was largely confined to the five unsuccessful novels written in the period 1879–1885. &quot;Immaturity&quot; (1879) is a semi-autobiographical portrayal of mid-Victorian England, Shaw&#x27;s &quot;own &quot;David Copperfield&quot;&quot; according to Weintraub. &quot;The Irrational Knot&quot; (1880) is a critique of conventional marriage, in which Weintraub finds the characterisations lifeless, &quot;hardly more than animated theories&quot;. Shaw was pleased with his third novel, &quot;Love Among the Artists&quot; (1881), feeling that it marked a turning point in his development as a thinker, although he had no more success with it than with its predecessors. &quot;Cashel Byron&#x27;s Profession&quot; (1882) is, says Weintraub, an indictment of society which anticipates Shaw&#x27;s first full-length play, &quot;Mrs Warren&#x27;s Profession&quot;. Shaw later explained that he had intended &quot;An Unsocial Socialist&quot; as the first section of a monumental depiction of the downfall of capitalism. Gareth Griffith, in a study of Shaw&#x27;s political thought, sees the novel as an interesting record of conditions, both in society at large and in the nascent socialist movement of the 1880s.

Shaw&#x27;s only subsequent fiction of any substance was his 1932 novella &quot;The Adventures of the Black Girl in Her Search for God&quot;, written during a visit to South Africa in 1932. The eponymous girl, intelligent, inquisitive, and converted to Christianity by insubstantial missionary teaching, sets out to find God, on a journey that after many adventures and encounters, leads her to a secular conclusion. The story, on publication, offended some Christians and was banned in Ireland by the Board of Censors.

===Letters and diaries===

Shaw was a prolific correspondent throughout his life. His letters, edited by Dan H. Laurence, were published between 1965 and 1988. Shaw once estimated his letters would occupy twenty volumes; Laurence commented that, unedited, they would fill many more. Shaw wrote more than a quarter of a million letters, of which about ten per cent have survived; 2,653 letters are printed in Laurence&#x27;s four volumes. Among Shaw&#x27;s many regular correspondents were his childhood friend Edward McNulty; his theatrical colleagues (and &quot;amitiés amoureuses&quot;) Mrs Patrick Campbell and Ellen Terry; writers including Lord Alfred Douglas, H. G. Wells and G. K. Chesterton; the boxer Gene Tunney; the nun Laurentia McLachlan; and the art expert Sydney Cockerell. In 2007 a 316-page volume consisting entirely of Shaw&#x27;s letters to &quot;The Times&quot; was published.

Shaw&#x27;s diaries for 1885–1897, edited by Weintraub, were published in two volumes, with a total of 1,241 pages, in 1986. Reviewing them, the Shaw scholar Fred Crawford wrote: &quot;Although the primary interest for Shavians is the material that supplements what we already know about Shaw&#x27;s life and work, the diaries are also valuable as a historical and sociological document of English life at the end of the Victorian age.&quot; After 1897, pressure of other writing led Shaw to give up keeping a diary.

===Miscellaneous and autobiographical===
Through his journalism, pamphlets and occasional longer works, Shaw wrote on many subjects. His range of interest and enquiry included vivisection, vegetarianism, religion, language, cinema and photography, on all of which he wrote and spoke copiously. Collections of his writings on these and other subjects were published, mainly after his death, together with volumes of &quot;wit and wisdom&quot; and general journalism.

Despite the many books written about him (Holroyd counts 80 by 1939) Shaw&#x27;s autobiographical output, apart from his diaries, was relatively slight. He gave interviews to newspapers—&quot;GBS Confesses&quot;, to &quot;The Daily Mail&quot; in 1904 is an example—and provided sketches to would-be biographers whose work was rejected by Shaw and never published. In 1939 Shaw drew on these materials to produce &quot;Shaw Gives Himself Away&quot;, a miscellany which, a year before his death, he revised and republished as &quot;Sixteen Self Sketches&quot; (there were seventeen). He made it clear to his publishers that this slim book was in no sense a full autobiography.

==Beliefs and opinions==
Throughout his lifetime Shaw professed many beliefs, often contradictory. This inconsistency was partly an intentional provocation—the Spanish scholar-statesman Salvador de Madariaga describes Shaw as &quot;a pole of negative electricity set in a people of positive electricity&quot;. In one area at least Shaw was constant: in his lifelong refusal to follow normal English forms of spelling and punctuation. He favoured archaic spellings such as &quot;shew&quot; for &quot;show&quot;; he dropped the &quot;u&quot; in words like &quot;honour&quot; and &quot;favour&quot;; and wherever possible he rejected the apostrophe in contractions such as &quot;won&#x27;t&quot; or &quot;that&#x27;s&quot;. In his will, Shaw ordered that, after some specified legacies, his remaining assets were to form a trust to pay for fundamental reform of the English alphabet into a phonetic version of forty letters. Though Shaw&#x27;s intentions were clear, his drafting was flawed, and the courts initially ruled the intended trust void. A later out-of-court agreement provided a sum of £8,300 for spelling reform; the bulk of his fortune went to the residuary legatees—the British Museum, the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art and the National Gallery of Ireland. Most of the £8,300 went on a special phonetic edition of &quot;Androcles and the Lion&quot; in the Shavian alphabet, published in 1962 to a largely indifferent reception.

Shaw&#x27;s views on religion and Christianity were less consistent. Having in his youth proclaimed himself an atheist, in middle age he explained this as a reaction against the Old Testament image of a vengeful Jehovah. By the early twentieth century, he termed himself a &quot;mystic&quot;, although Gary Sloan, in an essay on Shaw&#x27;s beliefs, disputes his credentials as such. In 1913 Shaw declared that he was not religious &quot;in the sectarian sense&quot;, aligning himself with Jesus as &quot;a person of no religion&quot;. In the preface (1915) to &quot;Androcles and the Lion&quot;, Shaw asks &quot;Why not give Christianity a chance?&quot; contending that Britain&#x27;s social order resulted from the continuing choice of Barabbas over Christ. In a broadcast just before the Second World War, Shaw invoked the Sermon on the Mount, &quot;a very moving exhortation, and it gives you one first-rate tip, which is to do good to those who despitefully use you and persecute you&quot;. In his will, Shaw stated that his &quot;religious convictions and scientific views cannot at present be more specifically defined than as those of a believer in creative revolution&quot;. He requested that no one should imply that he accepted the beliefs of any specific religious organisation, and that no memorial to him should &quot;take the form of a cross or any other instrument of torture or symbol of blood sacrifice&quot;.

Shaw espoused racial equality, and inter-marriage between people of different races. Despite his expressed wish to be fair to Hitler, he called anti-Semitism &quot;the hatred of the lazy, ignorant fat-headed Gentile for the pertinacious Jew who, schooled by adversity to use his brains to the utmost, outdoes him in business&quot;. In &quot;The Jewish Chronicle&quot; he wrote in 1932, &quot;In every country you can find rabid people who have a phobia against Jews, Jesuits, Armenians, Negroes, Freemasons, Irishmen, or simply foreigners as such. Political parties are not above exploiting these fears and jealousies.&quot;

In 1903 Shaw joined in a controversy about vaccination against smallpox. He called vaccination &quot;a peculiarly filthy piece of witchcraft&quot;; in his view immunisation campaigns were a cheap and inadequate substitute for a decent programme of housing for the poor, which would, he declared, be the means of eradicating smallpox and other infectious diseases. Less contentiously, Shaw was keenly interested in transport; Laurence observed in 1992 a need for a published study of Shaw&#x27;s interest in &quot;bicycling, motorbikes, automobiles, and planes, climaxing in his joining the Interplanetary Society in his nineties&quot;. Shaw published articles on travel, took photographs of his journeys, and submitted notes to the Royal Automobile Club.

Shaw strove throughout his adult life to be referred to as &quot;Bernard Shaw&quot; rather than &quot;George Bernard Shaw&quot;, but confused matters by continuing to use his full initials—G.B.S.—as a by-line, and often signed himself &quot;G.Bernard Shaw&quot;. He left instructions in his will that his executor (the Public Trustee) was to license publication of his works only under the name Bernard Shaw. Shaw scholars including Ervine, Judith Evans, Holroyd, Laurence and Weintraub, and many publishers have respected Shaw&#x27;s preference, although the Cambridge University Press was among the exceptions with its 1988 &quot;Cambridge Companion to George Bernard Shaw&quot;.

==Legacy and influence==

===Theatrical===

Shaw did not found a school of dramatists as such, but Crawford asserts that today &quot;we recognise [him] as second only to Shakespeare in the British theatrical tradition ... the proponent of the theater of ideas&quot; who struck a death-blow to 19th-century melodrama. According to Laurence, Shaw pioneered &quot;intelligent&quot; theatre, in which the audience was required to think, thereby paving the way for the new breeds of twentieth-century playwrights from Galsworthy to Pinter.

Crawford lists numerous playwrights whose work owes something to that of Shaw. Among those active in Shaw&#x27;s lifetime he includes Noël Coward, who based his early comedy &quot;The Young Idea&quot; on &quot;You Never Can Tell&quot; and continued to draw on the older man&#x27;s works in later plays. T. S. Eliot, by no means an admirer of Shaw, admitted that the epilogue of &quot;Murder in the Cathedral&quot;, in which Becket&#x27;s slayers explain their actions to the audience, might have been influenced by &quot;Saint Joan&quot;. The critic Eric Bentley comments that Eliot&#x27;s later play &quot;The Confidential Clerk&quot; &quot;had all the earmarks of Shavianism ... without the merits of the real Bernard Shaw&quot;. Among more recent British dramatists, Crawford marks Tom Stoppard as &quot;the most Shavian of contemporary playwrights&quot;; Shaw&#x27;s &quot;serious farce&quot; is continued in the works of Stoppard&#x27;s contemporaries Alan Ayckbourn, Henry Livings and Peter Nichols.
Shaw&#x27;s influence crossed the Atlantic at an early stage. Bernard Dukore notes that he was successful as a dramatist in America ten years before achieving comparable success in Britain. Among many American writers professing a direct debt to Shaw, Eugene O&#x27;Neill became an admirer at the age of seventeen, after reading &quot;The Quintessence of Ibsenism&quot;. Other Shaw-influenced American playwrights mentioned by Dukore are Elmer Rice, for whom Shaw &quot;opened doors, turned on lights, and expanded horizons&quot;; William Saroyan, who empathised with Shaw as &quot;the embattled individualist against the philistines&quot;; and S. N. Behrman, who was inspired to write for the theatre after attending a performance of &quot;Caesar and Cleopatra&quot;: &quot;I thought it would be agreeable to write plays like that&quot;.

Assessing Shaw&#x27;s reputation in a 1976 critical study, T. F. Evans described Shaw as unchallenged in his lifetime and since as the leading English-language dramatist of the (twentieth) century, and as a master of prose style. The following year, in a contrary assessment, the playwright John Osborne castigated &quot;The Guardian&quot;″s theatre critic Michael Billington for referring to Shaw as &quot;the greatest British dramatist since Shakespeare&quot;. Osborne responded that Shaw &quot;is the most fraudulent, inept writer of Victorian melodramas ever to gull a timid critic or fool a dull public&quot;. Despite this hostility, Crawford sees the influence of Shaw in some of Osborne&#x27;s plays, and concludes that though the latter&#x27;s work is neither imitative nor derivative, these affinities are sufficient to classify Osborne as an inheritor of Shaw.

In a 1983 study, R. J. Kaufmann suggests that Shaw was a key forerunner—&quot;godfather, if not actually finicky paterfamilias&quot;—of the Theatre of the Absurd. Two further aspects of Shaw&#x27;s theatrical legacy are noted by Crawford: his opposition to stage censorship, which was finally ended in 1968, and his efforts which extended over many years to establish a National Theatre. Shaw&#x27;s short 1910 play &quot;The Dark Lady of the Sonnets&quot;, in which Shakespeare pleads with Queen Elizabeth I for the endowment of a state theatre, was part of this campaign.

Writing in &quot;The New Statesman&quot; in 2012 Daniel Janes commented that Shaw&#x27;s reputation had declined by the time of his 150th anniversary in 2006 but had recovered considerably. In Janes&#x27;s view, the many current revivals of Shaw&#x27;s major works showed the playwright&#x27;s &quot;almost unlimited relevance to our times&quot;. In the same year, Mark Lawson wrote in &quot;The Guardian&quot; that Shaw&#x27;s moral concerns engaged present-day audiences, and made him—like his model, Ibsen—one of the most popular playwrights in contemporary British theatre.

The Shaw Festival in Niagara-on-the-Lake, Ontario, Canada is the second largest repertory theatre company in North America. It produces plays by or written during the lifetime of Shaw as well as some contemporary works. The Gingold Theatrical Group, founded in 2006, presents works by Shaw and others in New York City that feature the humanitarian ideals that his work promoted. It became the first theatre group to present all of Shaw&#x27;s stage work through its monthly concert series &quot;Project Shaw&quot;.

===General===

In the 1940s the author Harold Nicolson advised the National Trust not to accept the bequest of Shaw&#x27;s Corner, predicting that Shaw would be totally forgotten within fifty years. In the event, Shaw&#x27;s broad cultural legacy, embodied in the widely used term &quot;Shavian&quot;, has endured and is nurtured by Shaw Societies in various parts of the world. The original society was founded in London in 1941 and survives; it organises meetings and events, and publishes a regular bulletin &quot;The Shavian&quot;. The Shaw Society of America began in June 1950; it foundered in the 1970s but its journal, adopted by Penn State University Press, continued to be published as &quot;Shaw: The Annual of Bernard Shaw Studies&quot; until 2004. A second American organisation, founded in 1951 as &quot;The Bernard Shaw Society&quot;, remains active . More recent societies have been established in Japan and India.

Besides his collected music criticism, Shaw has left a varied musical legacy, not all of it of his choosing. Despite his dislike of having his work adapted for the musical theatre (&quot;my plays set themselves to a verbal music of their own&quot;) two of his plays were turned into musical comedies: &quot;Arms and the Man&quot; was the basis of &quot;The Chocolate Soldier&quot; in 1908, with music by Oscar Straus, and &quot;Pygmalion&quot; was adapted in 1956 as &quot;My Fair Lady&quot; with book and lyrics by Alan Jay Lerner and music by Frederick Loewe. Although he had a high regard for Elgar, Shaw turned down the composer&#x27;s request for an opera libretto, but played a major part in persuading the BBC to commission Elgar&#x27;s Third Symphony, and was the dedicatee of &quot;The Severn Suite&quot; (1930).

The substance of Shaw&#x27;s political legacy is uncertain. In 1921 Shaw&#x27;s erstwhile collaborator William Archer, in a letter to the playwright, wrote: &quot;I doubt if there is any case of a man so widely read, heard, seen, and known as yourself, who has produced so little effect on his generation.&quot; Margaret Cole, who considered Shaw the greatest writer of his age, professed never to have understood him. She thought he worked &quot;immensely hard&quot; at politics, but essentially, she surmises, it was for fun—&quot;the fun of a brilliant artist&quot;. After Shaw&#x27;s death, Pearson wrote: &quot;No one since the time of Tom Paine has had so definite an influence on the social and political life of his time and country as Bernard Shaw.&quot;

In its obituary tribute to Shaw, &quot;The Times Literary Supplement&quot; concluded:

<text>Galvanization (also spelled galvanisation) is the process of applying a protective zinc coating to steel or iron, to prevent rusting. The most common method is hot-dip galvanizing, in which the parts are coated by submerging them in a bath of hot, molten zinc.

==Protective action==
The zinc coating, when intact, prevents corrosive substances from reaching the underlying iron. Additional electroplating such as a chromate conversion coating may be applied to provide further surface passivation to the substrate material.

==History and etymology==

The process is named after the Italian physician, physicist, biologist and philosopher Luigi Galvani (9 September 1737 – 4 December 1798). The earliest known example of galvanized iron was discovered on 17th-century Indian armour in the Royal Armouries Museum collection in the United Kingdom.

The term &quot;galvanized&quot; can also be used metaphorically of any stimulus which results in activity by a person or group of people. 
In modern usage, the term &quot;galvanizing&quot; has largely come to be associated with zinc coatings, to the exclusion of other metals. Galvanic paint, a precursor to hot-dip galvanizing, was patented by Stanislas Sorel, of Paris, on June 10, 1837, as an adoption of a term from a highly fashionable field of contemporary science, despite having no evident relation to it.

==Methods==
Hot-dip galvanizing deposits a thick, robust layer of zinc iron alloys on the surface of a steel item. In the case of automobile bodies, where additional decorative coatings of paint will be applied, a thinner form of galvanizing is applied by electrogalvanizing. The hot-dip process generally does not reduce strength to a measurable degree, with the exception of high-strength steels where hydrogen embrittlement can become a problem.

Thermal diffusion galvanizing, or Sherardizing, provides a zinc diffusion coating on iron- or copper-based materials.

==Eventual corrosion==

Galvanized steel can last for many decades if other supplementary measures are maintained, such as paint coatings and additional sacrificial anodes. Corrosion in non-salty environments is caused mainly by levels of sulfur dioxide in the air.

==Galvanized construction steel==
This is the most common use for galvanized metal; hundreds of thousands of tons of steel products are galvanized annually worldwide. In developed countries, most larger cities have several galvanizing factories, and many items of steel manufacture are galvanized for protection. Typically these include street furniture, building frameworks, balconies, verandahs, staircases, ladders, walkways, and more. Hot dip galvanized steel is also used for making steel frames as a basic construction material for steel frame buildings.

==Galvanized piping==
In the early 20th century, galvanized piping swiftly took the place of previously used cast iron and lead in cold-water plumbing. Galvanized piping rusts from the inside out, building up layers of plaque on the inside of the piping, causing both water pressure problems and eventual pipe failure. These plaques can flake off, leading to visible impurities in water and a slight metallic taste. The life expectancy of galvanized piping is about 40–50 years, but it may vary on how well the pipes were built and installed. Pipe longevity also depends on the thickness of zinc in the original galvanizing, which ranges on a scale from G01 to G360.

<text>The Golden Rule is the principle of treating others as one would want to be treated by them. It is sometimes called an ethics of reciprocity, meaning that you should reciprocate to others how you would like them to treat you (not necessarily how they actually treat you). Various expressions of this rule can be found in the tenets of most religions and creeds through the ages.

The maxim may appear as a positive or negative injunction governing conduct:
* Treat others as you would like others to treat you (positive or directive form)
* Do &quot;not&quot; treat others in ways that you would &quot;not&quot; like to be treated (negative or prohibitive form)
* What you wish upon others, you wish upon yourself (empathetic or responsive form)

==Etymology==
The term &quot;Golden Rule&quot;, or &quot;Golden law&quot;, began to be used widely in the early 17th century in Britain by Anglican theologians and preachers; the earliest known usage is that of Anglicans Charles Gibbon and Thomas Jackson in 1604.

==Ancient history==
===Ancient Egypt===
Possibly the earliest affirmation of the maxim of reciprocity, reflecting the ancient Egyptian goddess Ma&#x27;at, appears in the story of &quot;The Eloquent Peasant&quot;, which dates to the Middle Kingdom (): &quot;Now this is the command: Do to the doer to make him do.&quot; This proverb embodies the &quot;do ut des&quot; principle. A Late Period () papyrus contains an early negative affirmation of the Golden Rule: &quot;That which you hate to be done to you, do not do to another.&quot;

===Ancient India===
====Sanskrit tradition====
In &quot;Mahābhārata&quot;, the ancient epic of India, there is a discourse in which sage Brihaspati tells the king Yudhishthira the following about dharma, a philosophical understanding of values and actions that lend good order to life:
The Mahābhārata is usually dated to the period between 400 BCE and 400 CE.

====Tamil tradition====
In Chapter 32 in the Book of Virtue of the Tirukkuṛaḷ (), Valluvar says:


Furthermore, in verse 312, Valluvar says that it is the determination or code of the spotless (virtuous) not to do evil, even in return, to those who have cherished enmity and done them evil. According to him, the proper punishment to those who have done evil is to put them to shame by showing them kindness, in return and to forget both the evil and the good done on both sides (verse 314).

===Ancient Greece===
The Golden Rule in its prohibitive (negative) form was a common principle in ancient Greek philosophy. Examples of the general concept include:
* &quot;Avoid doing what you would blame others for doing.&quot; – Thales ( – )
* &quot;What you do not want to happen to you, do not do it yourself either.&quot; – Sextus the Pythagorean. The oldest extant reference to Sextus is by Origen in the third century of the common era.
* &quot;Ideally, no one should touch my property or tamper with it, unless I have given him some sort of permission, and, if I am sensible I shall treat the property of others with the same respect.&quot; – Plato ( – )
* &quot;Do not do to others that which angers you when they do it to you.&quot; – Isocrates (436–338 BCE)
* &quot;It is impossible to live a pleasant life without living wisely and well and justly, and it is impossible to live wisely and well and justly without living pleasantly.&quot; – Epicurus (341–270 BC) where &quot;justly&quot; refers to &quot;an agreement made in reciprocal association ... against the infliction or suffering of harm.&quot;

===Ancient Persia===
The Pahlavi Texts of Zoroastrianism ( – 1000 CE) were an early source for the Golden Rule: &quot;That nature alone is good which refrains from doing to another whatsoever is not good for itself.&quot; Dadisten-I-dinik, 94,5, and &quot;Whatever is disagreeable to yourself do not do unto others.&quot; Shayast-na-Shayast 13:29

===Ancient Rome===
Seneca the Younger ( – 65 CE), a practitioner of Stoicism ( – 200 CE), expressed a hierarchical variation of the Golden Rule in his Letter 47, an essay regarding the treatment of slaves: &quot;Treat your inferior as you would wish your superior to treat you.&quot;

==Religious context==

According to Simon Blackburn, the Golden Rule &quot;can be found in some form in almost every ethical tradition&quot;. A multi-faith poster showing the Golden Rule in sacred writings from 13 faith traditions (designed by Paul McKenna of Scarboro Missions, 2000) has been on permanent display at the Headquarters of the United Nations since 4 January 2002. Creating the poster &quot;took five years of research that included consultations with experts in each of the 13 faith groups.&quot; (See also the section on Global Ethic.)

===Abrahamic religions===
====Judaism====

A rule of reciprocal altruism was stated positively in a well-known Torah verse (Hebrew: ):

According to John J. Collins of Yale Divinity School, most modern scholars, with Richard Elliott Friedman as a prominent exception, view the command as applicable to fellow Israelites.

Rashi commented what constitutes revenge and grudge, using the example of two men. One man would not lend the other his ax, then the next day, the same man asks the other for his ax. If the second man should say, I will not lend it to you, just as you did not lend to me,&#x27; it constitutes revenge; if &#x27;Here it is for you; I am not like you, who did not lend me,&#x27; it constitutes a grudge. Rashi concludes his commentary by quoting Rabbi Akiva on love of neighbor: &#x27;This is a fundamental [all-inclusive] principle of the Torah.

Hillel the Elder ( – 10 CE) used this verse as a most important message of the Torah for his teachings. Once, he was challenged by a gentile who asked to be converted under the condition that the Torah be explained to him while he stood on one foot. Hillel accepted him as a candidate for conversion to Judaism but, drawing on Leviticus 19:18, briefed the man:
Hillel recognized brotherly love as the fundamental principle of Jewish ethics. Rabbi Akiva agreed, while Simeon ben Azzai suggested that the principle of love must have its foundation in Genesis chapter 1, which teaches that all men are the offspring of Adam, who was made in the image of God. According to Jewish rabbinic literature, the first man Adam represents the &quot;unity of mankind&quot;. This is echoed in the modern preamble of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. It is also taught that Adam is last in order according to the evolutionary character of God&#x27;s creation:

The Jewish Publication Society&#x27;s edition of Leviticus states:

This Torah verse represents one of several versions of the &quot;Golden Rule&quot;, which itself appears in various forms, positive and negative. It is the earliest written version of that concept in a positive form.

At the turn of the era, the Jewish rabbis were discussing the scope of the meaning of Leviticus 19:18 and 19:34 extensively:

Commentators interpret that this applies to foreigners (e.g. Samaritans), proselytes (&#x27;strangers who reside with you&#x27;) and Jews.

On the verse, &quot;Love your fellow as yourself&quot;, the classic commentator Rashi quotes from Torat Kohanim, an early Midrashic text regarding the famous dictum of Rabbi Akiva: &quot;Love your fellow as yourself – Rabbi Akiva says this is a great principle of the Torah.&quot;

In 1935, Rabbi Eliezer Berkovits explained in his work &quot;What is the Talmud?&quot; that Leviticus 19:34 disallowed xenophobia by Jews.

Israel&#x27;s postal service quoted from the previous Leviticus verse when it commemorated the Universal Declaration of Human Rights on a 1958 postage stamp.

====Christianity====

===== New Testament =====
The Golden Rule was proclaimed by Jesus of Nazareth during his Sermon on the Mount and described by him as the second great commandment. The common English phrasing is &quot;Do unto others as you would have them do unto you&quot;. Various applications of the Golden Rule are stated positively numerous times in the Old Testament: &quot;You shall not take vengeance or bear a grudge against any of your people, but you shall love your neighbor as yourself: I am the LORD.&quot; Or, in Leviticus 19:34: &quot;The alien who resides with you shall be to you as the native-born among you; you shall love the alien as yourself, for you were aliens in the land of Egypt: I am the LORD your God.&quot; These two examples are given in the Septuagint as follows: &quot;And thy hand shall not avenge thee; and thou shalt not be angry with the children of thy people; and thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself; I am the Lord.&quot; and &quot;The stranger that comes to you shall be among you as the native, and thou shalt love him as thyself; for ye were strangers in the land of Egypt: I am the Lord your God.&quot;

Two passages in the New Testament quote Jesus of Nazareth espousing the positive form of the Golden rule:


A similar passage, a parallel to the Great Commandment, is to be found later in the Gospel of Luke.

The passage in the book of Luke then continues with Jesus answering the question, &quot;Who is my neighbor?&quot;, by telling the parable of the Good Samaritan, which John Wesley interprets as meaning that &quot;your neighbor&quot; is anyone in need.

Jesus&#x27; teaching goes beyond the negative formulation of not doing what one would not like done to themselves, to the positive formulation of actively doing good to another that, if the situations were reversed, one would desire that the other would do for them. This formulation, as indicated in the parable of the Good Samaritan, emphasizes the needs for positive action that brings benefit to another, not simply restraining oneself from negative activities that hurt another.

In one passage of the New Testament, Paul the Apostle refers to the golden rule, restating Jesus&#x27; second commandment:

St. Paul also comments on the golden rule in the Epistle to the Romans:

===== Deuterocanon =====
The Old Testament Deuterocanonical books of Tobit and Sirach, accepted as part of the Scriptural canon by Catholic Church, Eastern Orthodoxy, and the non-Chalcedonian churches, express a negative form of the golden rule:


===== Church Fathers =====
As prolific commentators on the Bible, multiple Church Fathers, including the Apostolic Fathers, wrote on the Golden Rule found in both Old and New Testaments. The early Christian treatise the Didache included the Golden Rule in saying &quot;in everything, do not do to another what you would not want done to you.&quot;

Clement of Alexandria, commenting on the Golden Rule in Luke 6:31, calls the concept &quot;all embracing&quot; for how one acts in life. Clement further pointed to the phrasing in the book of Tobit as part of the ethics between husbands and wives. Tertullian stated that the rule taught &quot;love, respect, consolation, protection, and benefits&quot;.

While many Church Fathers framed the Golden Rule as part of Jewish and Christian Ethics, Theophilus of Antioch stated that it had universal application for all of humanity. Origen connected the Golden Rule with the law written on the hearts of Gentiles mentioned by Paul in his letter to the Romans, and had universal application to Christian and non-Christian alike.

Basil of Caesarea commented that the negative form of the Golden Rule was for avoiding evil while the positive form was for doing good.

====Islam====

The Arabian peninsula was said to not practice the golden rule prior to the advent of Islam. According to Th. Emil Homerin: &quot;Pre-Islamic Arabs regarded the survival of the tribe, as most essential and to be ensured by the ancient rite of blood vengeance.&quot; Homerin goes on to say:

From the hadith:




Ali ibn Abi Talib (4th Caliph in Sunni Islam, and first Imam in Shia Islam) says:
 Muslim scholar Al-Qurtubi looked at the Golden Rule of loving your neighbor and treating them as you wish to be treated as having universal application to believers and unbelievers alike. Relying upon a Hadith, exegist Ibn Kathir listed those &quot;who judge people the way they judge themselves&quot; as people who will be among the first to be Resurrected.

Hussein bin Ali bin Awn al-Hashemi (102nd Caliph in Sunni Islam), repeated the Golden rule in the context of the Armenian genocide, thus, in 1917, he states:
====Mandaeism====

In Mandaean scriptures, the Ginza Rabba and Mandaean Book of John contain a prohibitive form of the Golden Rule that is virtually identical to the one used by Hillel.



====Baháʼí Faith====

The writings of the Baháʼí Faith encourage everyone to treat others as they would treat themselves and even prefer others over oneself:



===Indian religions===
====Hinduism====

Also,
====Buddhism====

Buddha (Siddhartha Gautama, –543 BCE) made the negative formulation of the golden rule one of the cornerstones of his ethics in the 6th century BCE. It occurs in many places and in many forms throughout the Tripitaka.



====Jainism====

The Golden Rule is paramount in the Jainist philosophy and can be seen in the doctrines of ahimsa and karma. As part of the prohibition of causing any living beings to suffer, Jainism forbids inflicting upon others what is harmful to oneself.

The following line from the Acaranga Sutra sums up the philosophy of Jainism:


====Sikhism====

===Chinese religions===
====Confucianism====


The same idea is also presented in V.12 and VI.30 of the &quot;Analects&quot; (), which can be found in the online Chinese Text Project. The phraseology differs from the Christian version of the Golden Rule. It does not presume to do anything unto others, but merely to avoid doing what would be harmful. It does not preclude doing good deeds and taking moral positions.

In relation to the Golden Rule, Confucian philosopher Mencius said &quot;If one acts with a vigorous effort at the law of reciprocity, when he seeks for the realization of perfect virtue, nothing can be closer than his approximation to it.&quot;

====Taoism====


====Mohism====

Mozi regarded the golden rule as a corollary to the cardinal virtue of impartiality, and encouraged egalitarianism and selflessness in relationships.

===Iranian religions===
====Zoroastrianism====
===New religious movements===
====Wicca====

==== Scientology ====

===Traditional African religions===
==== Yoruba ====

====Odinani====


==Secular context==
===Global ethic===

The &quot;Declaration Toward a Global Ethic&quot; from the Parliament of the World&#x27;s Religions (1993) proclaimed the Golden Rule (&quot;We must treat others as we wish others to treat us&quot;) as the common principle for many religions. The Initial Declaration was signed by 143 leaders from all of the world&#x27;s major faiths, including Baháʼí Faith, Brahmanism, Brahma Kumaris, Buddhism, Christianity, Hinduism, Indigenous, Interfaith, Islam, Jainism, Judaism, Native American, Neo-Pagan, Sikhism, Taoism, Theosophist, Unitarian Universalist and Zoroastrian. In the folklore of several cultures the Golden Rule is depicted by the allegory of the long spoons.

====Humanism====

In the view of Greg M. Epstein, a Humanist chaplain at Harvard University, do unto others&#x27; ... is a concept that essentially no religion misses entirely. &quot;But not a single one of these versions of the golden rule requires a God&quot;.&quot; Various sources identify the Golden Rule as a humanist principle:

====Existentialism====

====Classical Utilitarianism====

John Stuart Mill in his book, &quot;Utilitarianism&quot; (originally published in 1861), wrote, &quot;In the golden rule of Jesus of Nazareth, we read the complete spirit of the ethics of utility. &#x27;To do as you would be done by,&#x27; and &#x27;to love your neighbour as yourself,&#x27; constitute the ideal perfection of utilitarian morality.&quot;

==Other contexts==
===Human rights===
According to Marc H. Bornstein, and William E. Paden, the Golden Rule is arguably the most essential basis for the modern concept of human rights, in which each individual has a right to just treatment, and a reciprocal responsibility to ensure justice for others.

However, Leo Damrosch argued that the notion that the Golden Rule pertains to &quot;rights&quot; per se is a contemporary interpretation and has nothing to do with its origin. The development of human &quot;rights&quot; is a modern political ideal that began as a philosophical concept promulgated through the philosophy of Jean Jacques Rousseau in 18th century France, among others. His writings influenced Thomas Jefferson, who then incorporated Rousseau&#x27;s reference to &quot;inalienable rights&quot; into the United States Declaration of Independence in 1776. Damrosch argued that to confuse the Golden Rule with human rights is to apply contemporary thinking to ancient concepts.

=== Variations ===
The Platinum Rule has been said to be stated as, &quot;Do to others as they would have you do to them.&quot; Taken in the spirit of the Golden Rule, this suggests one should be familiar or at least consider the desires of the person they&#x27;re interacting with. However, this is the flaw of the rule in that it requires one to stereotype or make broad assumptions about a strangers interests and personality before interacting with them. These kind of assumptions are often erroneous and therefore a prudent person would avoid the interaction knowing their assumptions are likely incorrect. This rule is prohibitive to communication and prefers no interaction over any interaction with strangers. On occasion, stereotypes may be applied and in rare cases are largely correct. In those situations this rule can be applied successfully.

On the other hand, the Platinum Rule is broadly successful when interacting with familiar people and directs that all interaction be conducted in a manner the person would like to be treated. This demonstrates respect and the desire to favorably regard the person one is interacting with. Unfortunately, this can lead to a dependent relationship, developing a psychological tendency to expect similar treatment in all relationships and avoid forming new relationships where this treatment would not exist simply from not knowing the individuals preferences.

Despite the unusual cases stifling interaction or individuals developing a demand for this behavior from others, the Platinum Rule requires due consideration, self-control, and receiver analysis. Taken altogether, the Platinum Rule represents a gesture of kindness, and is an established norm in various industries, such as marketing, medical care, motivational speaking, and many others. As a consequence, some argue the Golden Rule is outdated, self-absorbed, and grossly fails to consider the needs of others.

==Science and economics==

Some published research argues that some &#x27;sense&#x27; of fair play and the Golden Rule may be stated and rooted in terms of neuroscientific and neuroethical principles.

The Golden Rule can also be explained from the perspectives of psychology, philosophy, sociology, human evolution, and economics. Psychologically, it involves a person empathizing with others. Philosophically, it involves a person perceiving their neighbor also as &quot;I&quot; or &quot;self&quot;. Sociologically, &quot;love your neighbor as yourself&quot; is applicable between individuals, between groups, and also between individuals and groups. In evolution, &quot;reciprocal altruism&quot; is seen as a distinctive advance in the capacity of human groups to survive and reproduce, as their exceptional brains demanded exceptionally long childhoods and ongoing provision and protection even beyond that of the immediate family. In economics, Richard Swift, referring to ideas from David Graeber, suggests that &quot;without some kind of reciprocity society would no longer be able to exist.&quot;

Study of other primates provides evidence that the Golden Rule exists in other non-human species.

==Criticism==
Philosophers such as Immanuel Kant and Friedrich Nietzsche have objected to the rule on a variety of grounds. One is the epistemic question of determining how others want to be treated. The obvious way is to ask them, but they might give duplicitous answers if they find this strategically useful, and they might also fail to understand the details of the choice situation as you understand it. We might also be biased to perceiving harms and benefits to ourselves more than to others, which could lead to escalating conflict if we are suspicious of others. Hence Linus Pauling suggested that we introduce a bias towards others into the golden rule: &quot;Do unto others 20 percent better than you would have them do unto you&quot; - to correct for subjective bias.

===Differences in values or interests===
George Bernard Shaw wrote, &quot;Do not do unto others as you would that they should do unto you. Their tastes may not be the same.&quot; This suggests that if your values are not shared with others, the way you want to be treated will not be the way they want to be treated. Hence, the Golden Rule of &quot;do unto others&quot; is &quot;dangerous in the wrong hands&quot;, according to philosopher Iain King, because &quot;some fanatics have no aversion to death: the Golden Rule might inspire them to kill others in suicide missions.&quot;

Walter Terence Stace, in &quot;The Concept of Morals&quot; (1937) argued that Shaw&#x27;s remark

===Differences in situations===
Immanuel Kant famously criticized the golden rule for not being sensitive to differences of situation, noting that a prisoner duly convicted of a crime could appeal to the golden rule while asking the judge to release him, pointing out that the judge would not want anyone else to send him to prison, so he should not do so to others. On the other hand, in a critique of the consistency of Kant&#x27;s writings, several authors have noted the &quot;similarity&quot; between the Golden Rule and Kant&#x27;s &quot;Categorical Imperative&quot;, introduced in &quot;Groundwork of the Metaphysic of Morals&quot; (See discussion at this link).

This was perhaps a well-known objection, as Leibniz actually responded to it long before Kant made it, suggesting that the judge should put himself in the place, not merely of the criminal, but of all affected persons and then judging each option (to inflict punishment, or release the criminal, etc.) by whether there was a “greater good in which this lesser evil was included.”

===Other responses to criticisms===
Marcus George Singer observed that there are two importantly different ways of looking at the golden rule: as requiring (1) that you perform specific actions that you want others to do to you or (2) that you guide your behavior in the same general ways that you want others to. Counter-examples to the golden rule typically are more forceful against the first than the second.

In his book on the golden rule, Jeffrey Wattles makes the similar observation that such objections typically arise while applying the golden rule in certain general ways (namely, ignoring differences in taste or situation, failing to compensate for subjective bias, etc.) But if we apply the golden rule to our own method of using it, asking in effect if we would want other people to apply the golden rule in such ways, the answer would typically be no, since others&#x27; ignoring of such factors will lead to behavior which we object to. It follows that we should not do so ourselves—according to the golden rule. In this way, the golden rule may be self-correcting. An article by Jouni Reinikainen develops this suggestion in greater detail.

It is possible, then, that the golden rule can itself guide us in identifying which differences of situation are morally relevant. We would often want other people to ignore any prejudice against our race or nationality when deciding how to act towards us, but would also want them to not ignore our differing preferences in food, desire for aggressiveness, and so on. This principle of &quot;doing unto others, wherever possible, as &quot;they&quot; would be done by...&quot; has sometimes been termed the platinum rule.

<doc id="12861" wikidata="Q2347975" url="?curid=12861" title="Governor of New York">
<text>The governor of New York is the head of government of the U.S. state of New York. The governor is the head of the executive branch of New York&#x27;s state government and the commander-in-chief of the state&#x27;s military forces. The governor has a duty to enforce state laws and the power to either approve or veto bills passed by the New York Legislature, to convene the legislature and grant pardons, except in cases of impeachment and treason. The governor of New York is the highest paid governor in the country.

The current governor is Kathy Hochul, a member of the Democratic Party who took office on August 24, 2021, following the resignation of Andrew Cuomo. She was elected to a full term in 2022.

==History== 
The position of governor in New York dates back to the British take over of New Amsterdam where the position replaced the former Dutch offices of director or director-general.

==Election== 

The governor is directly elected every four years, in even-numbered years when there is no presidential election. The governor is required to be a United States citizen and a resident of New York for five years preceding their election. No person can be elected as governor under the age of thirty.

==Powers and duties==
The governor has a duty to enforce state laws, and the power to either approve or veto bills passed by the New York State Legislature, to convene the legislature, and to grant pardons, except in cases of treason and impeachment. Unlike the other government departments that compose the executive branch of government, the governor is the head of the state Executive Department. The officeholder is afforded the courtesy style of &quot;His/Her Excellency&quot; while in office.

Often considered a potential candidate for U.S. president, ten New York governors have been selected as presidential candidates by a major party, four of whom (Martin Van Buren, Grover Cleveland, Theodore Roosevelt, and Franklin D. Roosevelt) were elected as President of the United States. Meanwhile, six New York governors have gone on to serve as vice president. Additionally, two New York governors, John Jay and Charles Evans Hughes, have served as chief justice.

==Appointments==
The governor is responsible for appointing their Executive Chamber. These appointments do not require the confirmation of the New York State Senate. Most political advisors report to the secretary to the governor, while most policy advisors report to the director of state operations, who also answers to the secretary to the governor, making that position, in practice, the true chief of staff and most powerful position in the Cabinet. The actual &quot;chief of staff&quot; is in charge of the Office of Scheduling and holds no authority over other cabinet officials.

The governor is also charged with naming the heads of the various departments, divisions, boards, and offices within the state government. These nominees require confirmation by the state Senate. While some appointees may share the title of &quot;commissioner&quot;, &quot;director&quot;, etc., only department level-heads are considered members of the actual state cabinet, although the heads of the various divisions, boards, and offices may attend cabinet-level meetings from time to time.

==Line of succession==

The Constitution of New York has provided since 1777 for the election of a lieutenant governor of New York, who also acts as president of the State Senate, to the same term (keeping the same term lengths as the governor throughout all the constitutional revisions). Originally, in the event of the death, resignation or impeachment of the governor, or absence from the state, the lieutenant governor would take on the governor&#x27;s duties and powers. Since the 1938 constitution, the lieutenant governor explicitly becomes governor upon such vacancy in the office.

Should the office of lieutenant governor become vacant, the temporary president of the state senate performs the duties of a lieutenant governor until the governor can take back the duties of the office, or the next election; likewise, should both offices become vacant, the temporary president acts as governor, with the office of lieutenant governor remaining vacant. Although no provision exists in the constitution for it, precedent set in 2009 allows the governor to appoint a lieutenant governor should a vacancy occur. Should the temporary president be unable to fulfill the duties, the speaker of the assembly is next in the line of succession. The lieutenant governor is elected on the same ticket as the governor, but nominated separately.

Line of succession:
# Lieutenant Governor
# Temporary President of the Senate
#Speaker of the Assembly
# Attorney General
# Comptroller
# Commissioner of Transportation
# Commissioner of Health
# Commissioner of Commerce
# Industrial Commissioner
# Chairman of the Public Service Commission
#Secretary of State

<text>Glasnevin (, also known as &quot;Glas Naedhe&quot;, meaning &quot;stream of O&#x27;Naeidhe&quot; after a local stream and an ancient chieftain) is a neighbourhood of Dublin, Ireland, situated on the River Tolka. While primarily residential, Glasnevin is also home to the National Botanic Gardens, Glasnevin Cemetery, the National Meteorological Office, and a range of other state bodies, and Dublin City University has its main campus and other facilities in and near the area. Glasnevin is also a civil parish in the ancient barony of Coolock.

==Geography==
A mainly residential neighbourhood, Glasnevin is located on the Northside of the city of Dublin (about 3 km north of Dublin city centre). It was established on the northern bank of the River Tolka where the stream for which it may be named joins, and now extends north and south of the river. Three watercourses flow into the Tolka in the area. Two streams can be seen near the Catholic &quot;pyramid church&quot;, the Claremont Stream or Nevin Stream, flowing south from Poppintree and Jamestown Industrial Estate branches, and what is sometimes called the &quot;Cemetery Drain&quot; coming north from the southern edge of Glasnevin Cemetery. In addition, a major diversion from the Wad River comes from the Ballymun area, joining near the Claremont Stream.

The boundaries of Glasnevin stretch from the Royal Canal to Griffith Avenue and from the Finglas Road to the edges of Drumcondra. It spans the postal districts of Dublin 9 and 11, and is bordered to the northwest by Finglas, northeast by Ballymun and Santry, Whitehall to the east, Phibsborough and Drumcondra to the south and Cabra to the southwest.

==History==

===Foundation===
Glasnevin was reputedly founded by Saint Mobhi (sometimes known as St Berchan) in the sixth (or perhaps fifth) century as a monastery. His monastery continued to be used for many years afterwards – St. Colman is recorded as having paid homage to its founder when he returned from abroad to visit Ireland a century after St Mobhi&#x27;s death in 544. St. Columba of Iona is thought to have studied under St. Mobhi, but left Glasnevin following an outbreak of plague and journeyed north to open the House at Derry; there is a long street (Iona Road) in Glasnevin named in his honour and the church on Iona Road is called Saint Columba&#x27;s.

===Middle Ages===
A settlement grew up around the monastery, which survived until the Viking invasions in the eighth century. After raids on monasteries at Glendalough and Clondalkin, the monasteries at Glasnevin and Finglas were attacked and destroyed.

By 822 Glasnevin, along with Grangegorman and Clonken or Clonkene (now known as Deansgrange), had become parts of the grange (farm) of Christ Church Cathedral and it seems to have maintained this connection up to the time of the Reformation.

The Battle of Clontarf was fought on the banks of the River Tolka in 1014 (a field called the &quot;bloody acre&quot; is supposed to be part of the site). The Irish defeated the Danes in a battle, in which 7,000 Danes and 4,000 Irish died.

The 12th century saw the Normans (who had conquered England and Wales in the eleventh century) invade Ireland. As local rulers continued fighting amongst themselves the Norman King of England Henry II was invited to intervene. He arrived in 1171, took control of much land, and then parcelled it out amongst his supporters. Glasnevin ended up under the jurisdiction of Finglas Abbey. Later, Laurence O&#x27;Toole, Archbishop of Dublin, took responsibility for Glasnevin and it became the property of the Priory of the Most Holy Trinity (Christ Church Cathedral).

In 1240 a church and tower were reconstructed on the site of the Church of St. Mobhi in the monastery. The returns of the church for 1326 stated that 28 tenants resided in Glasnevin. The church was enlarged in 1346, along with a small hall known as the Manor Hall.

===Late Middle Ages===
When King Henry VIII broke from Rome an era of religious repression began. During the Dissolution of the Monasteries, Catholic Church property and land were appropriated to the new Church of Ireland, and monasteries (including the one at Glasnevin) were forcibly closed, later falling into ruin. Glasnevin had at this stage developed as a village, with its principal landmark and focal point being its &quot;bull-ring&quot; noted in 1542.

By 1667 Glasnevin had expanded – but not by very much; it is recorded as containing 24 houses. The development of the village was given a fresh impetus when Sir John Rogerson built his country residence – &quot;The Glen&quot; or &quot;Glasnevin House&quot; – outside the village.

The plantations of Ireland saw the settlement of Protestant English families on land previously held by Catholics. Lands at Glasnevin were leased to such families and a Protestant church was erected there in 1707. It was built on the site of the old Catholic Church and was named after St. Mobhi. The church was largely rebuilt in the mid-18th century. The attached churchyard became a graveyard for both Protestants and Catholics. It is said that Robert Emmet is buried there, this claim being made because once somebody working in the graveyard there dug up a headless body.

===Early modern times===
By now Glasnevin was an area for &quot;families of distinction&quot; – in spite of a comment attributed to the Protestant Archbishop of Dublin, William King that &quot;&quot;when any couple had a mind to be wicked, they would retire to Glasnevin&quot;. In a letter, dated 1725 he described Glasnevin as &quot;the receptacle for thieves and rogues [..] The first search when anything was stolen, was there, and when any couple had a mind to retire to be wicked there was their harbour. But since the church was built, and service regularly settled, all these evils are banished. Good houses are built in it, and the place civilised.&quot;&quot; Glasnevin National School was also built during this period.

===19th and 20th centuries===
In the 1830s, the civil parish population was recorded as 1,001, of whom 559 resided in the village. Glasnevin was described as a parish in the barony of Coolock, pleasantly situated and the residence of many families of distinction.

On 1 June 1832, Charles Lindsay, Bishop of Kildare and Leighlin, and William John released their holdings of Sir John Rogerson&#x27;s lands at Glasnevin, (including Glasnevin House) to George Hayward Lindsay. This transfer included the sum of 1,500 Pounds Sterling. Although this does not specifically cite the marriage of George Hayward Lindsay to Lady Mary Catherine Gore, George Lindsay almost certainly came into possession of the lands at Glasnevin as a result of his marriage.

When Drumcondra began to rapidly expand in the 1870s, the residents of Glasnevin sought to protect their district and opposed being merged with the neighbouring suburb. One of the objectors was the property owner, Dr Henry Gogarty, the father of the Irish poet, Oliver St. John Gogarty. The combined areas of Drumcondra, Clonliffe and Glasnevin became a separate administrative unit, a township, in 1878. The township was merged into the City of Dublin in 1900, under the Dublin Corporation Act 1900 (63 &amp; 64 Vict. c. cclxiv).

George Hayward Lindsay&#x27;s eldest son, Lieutenant Colonel Henry Gore Lindsay, was in possession of his father&#x27;s lands at Glasnevin when the area began to be developed at the beginning of the twentieth century. Gradual development of his lands began in 1903/04 but Glasnevin remained relatively undeveloped until the opening up of the Carroll Estate in 1914, which saw the creation of the redbrick residential roads running down towards Drumcondra. The process was accelerated by Dublin Corporation in the 1920s and the present shape of the suburb was in place by 1930. Among the developers who built estates in the area were Alexander Strain and his son-in-law George Linzell. Linzell built the first individual house built in the international style in Ireland, Balnagowan House, on St. Mobhi Boithrin in the late 1920s.

The start of the 20th century also saw the opening of a short-lived railway station on the Drumcondra and North Dublin Link Railway line from Glasnevin Junction to Connolly Station (then Amiens Street). Glasnevin railway station opened on 1 April 1901 and closed on 1 December 1910.

==Features==

The village has changed a lot over the years, and is now fully part of Dublin city.

As well as the amenities of the National Botanic Gardens (Ireland) and local parks, the national meteorological office Met Éireann, the Central Fisheries Board, the National Standards Authority of Ireland, Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, the Department of Defence and the national enterprise and trade board Enterprise Ireland are all located in the area.

===National Botanic Gardens===
The house and lands of the poet Thomas Tickell were sold in 1790 to the Irish Parliament and given to the Royal Dublin Society for them to establish Ireland&#x27;s first Botanic Gardens. The gardens were the first location in Ireland where the infection responsible for the 1845–1847 Great Famine was identified. Throughout the famine, research to stop the infection was undertaken at the gardens.

The which border the River Tolka also adjoin the Prospect Cemetery. In 2002 the Botanic Gardens gained a new two-storey complex which included a new cafe and a large lecture theatre. The Irish National Herbarium is also located at the botanic gardens.

===Glasnevin (Prospect) Cemetery===

Prospect Cemetery is located in Glasnevin, although better known as Glasnevin Cemetery, the most historically notable burial place in the country and the last resting place, among a host of historical figures, of Michael Collins, Éamon de Valera, Charles Stewart Parnell and also Arthur Griffith. This graveyard led to Glasnevin being known as &quot;the dead centre of Dublin&quot;. It opened in 1832 and is the final resting place for thousands of ordinary citizens, as well as many Irish patriots.

===Hart&#x27;s Corner===
Approaching Glasnevin via Phibsboro is what is known as &quot;Hart&#x27;s Corner&quot; but which about 200 years ago was called Glasmanogue, and was then a well-known stage on the way to Finglas. At an earlier date, the name possessed a wider signification and was applied to a considerable portion of the adjoining district.

===Delville===
At the start of the 18th century a large house, known variously as The Glen and later as Delville, was built on the site of the present Bon Secours Hospital, Dublin. Its name, Delville, was an amalgamation of the surnames of two tenants, Dr. Helsam and Dr. Patrick Delany (as Heldeville), both fellows of Trinity College.

When Delany married his first wife he acquired sole ownership, but it became more well known as the home of Delany and his second wife, Mary Pendarves. She was a widow whom Delany married in 1743, and was an accomplished letter writer.

The couple were friends of Dean Jonathan Swift and, through him, of Alexander Pope. Pope encouraged the Delaneys to develop a garden in a style then becoming popular in England – moving away from the very formal, geometric layout that was common. He redesigned the house in the style of a villa and had the gardens laid out in the latest Dutch fashion creating what was almost certainly Ireland&#x27;s first naturalistic garden.

The house was, under Mrs Delany, a centre of Dublin&#x27;s intellectual life. Swift is said to have composed a number of his campaigning pamphlets while staying there. He and his lifelong companion Stella were both in the habit of visiting, and Swift satirised the grounds which he considered too small for the size of the house. Through her correspondence with her sister, Mrs Dewes, Mary wrote of Swift in 1733: &quot;he calls himself my master and corrects me when I speak bad English or do not pronounce my words distinctly&quot;.

Patrick Delany died in 1768 at the age of 82, prompting his widow to sell Delville and return to her native England until her death twenty years later.

===The Pyramid Church===
Glasnevin is also a parish in the Fingal South West deanery of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Dublin. It is served by the Church of Lady of Dolours on the banks of the River Tolka.

A timber church, which originally stood on Berkeley Road, was moved to a riverside site on Botanic Avenue early in the twentieth century; the altar in this church was from Newgate prison in Dublin. It served as the parish church until it was replaced, in 1972, by a structure resembling a pyramid when viewed from Botanic Avenue. The previous church was known locally as &quot;The Woodener&quot; or &quot;The Wooden&quot; and the new building is still known to older residents as &quot;The new Woodener&quot; or &quot;The Wigwam&quot;. The church underwent some refurbishment work inside and in its grounds and car park during the first half of 2011.

===Met Éireann===

In 1975 the new headquarters of Met Éireann, the Irish Meteorological Office, designed by Liam McCormick, opened on Glasnevin Hill, on the site of a former juvenile detention centre, Marlborough House. The Met Éireann building is a pyramidal shape and was originally to be covered in Welsh Slate, however, an indigenous material was deemed more appropriate, and the selected Irish stone curled and had to be replaced by metal sheeting. It is recognised as one of the most significant buildings to be erected in Dublin in the 1970s.

===Griffith Avenue===

The tree-lined Griffith Avenue runs through Glasnevin, Drumcondra and Marino, and spans three electoral constituencies. Like nearby Griffith Park, it was named after Arthur Griffith, who was the founder and third leader of Sinn Féin, served as President of Dáil Éireann and is buried in Glasnevin Cemetery.

A double-row of mature lime trees runs along both sides of Griffith Avenue from its junction with St Mobhi Road (in the west) to its junction with Malahide Road (in the east), a distance of 2.81 km. It is reputed to be the longest tree-lined purely residential avenue in the northern hemisphere.

==Amenities==
Scouting is represented in Glasnevin by the 1st Dublin (L.H.O) Scout Troop located on the corner of Griffith Avenue and Ballygall Road East.

===Sport===
The Gaelic games of Gaelic football, hurling, camogie and Gaelic handball are all organised locally by Na Fianna CLG, while soccer is played by local clubs Tolka Rovers, Glasnevin FC, and Glasnaion FC. Basketball is organised by Tolka Rovers. Tennis is played in Charleville Lawn Tennis Club which was founded in 1894 and took its name from the original location at the corner of the Charleville and Cabra Roads. The move to its present location on Whitworth Road took place in 1904. Hockey is also played in Botanic Hockey club on the Old Finglas Road. Glasnevin Boxing Club and football (soccer) club have a clubhouse on Mobhi road.

Billy Whelan, one of the eight Manchester United players who lost their lives in the Munich air disaster of 6 February 1958, was born locally and is buried in Glasnevin Cemetery.

===Education===
There are several primary schools in Glasnevin. These include Lindsay Road National School (Presbyterian patronage) and Glasnevin National School (Church of Ireland patronage), founded by Dean Swift and constructed in a round shape; known as &#x27;The Ink Bottle&#x27; this building was replaced in 1911. Also present are Glasnevin Educate Together National school, North Dublin National School Project, Scoil Mobhi, St. Brigid&#x27;s GNS, St. Columba&#x27;s NS and St.Vincent&#x27;s CBS.

There are several Roman Catholic secondary schools in the area St Vincent&#x27;s (Christian Brothers) School, Scoil Chaitríona and St Mary&#x27;s (Holy Faith) Secondary School.

The main campus of Dublin City University lies on the border between Glasnevin, Whitehall and Santry, and the DCU Alpha centre is in central Glasnevin. Teagasc also run horticultural education courses from the College of Amenity Horticulture in the Botanic Gardens.

<text>George Abbot or Abbott (1604 – 2 February 1649) was an English lay writer, known as &quot;The Puritan&quot;, and a politician who sat in the House of Commons in two periods between 1640 and 1649. He is known also for his part in defending Caldecote House against royalist forces in the early days of the English Civil War.

==Life==
Abbott was the son of George Abbott of York (died 1607) and his wife Joan Penkeston. While &quot;Alumni Cantabrigienses&quot; states that he matriculated at King&#x27;s College, Cambridge in 1622, the &quot;Oxford Dictionary of National Biography&quot; discounts the identification, for lack of evidence. He owned property in Baddesley Clinton, Warwickshire, and was a good friend of Richard Vines, minister at Caldecote some way to the east. In April 1640, he was elected as a member of parliament (MP) for Tamworth in the Short Parliament. 
In the English Civil War, Abbot worked closely in Warwickshire with his stepfather William Purefoy, and made a notable defence, with his mother Joan, of the Purefoy house at Caldecote, Warwickshire, gaining the family coverage in the London press. On 15 August 1642, with eight men, his mother and maids, he held out for a time against Prince Rupert of the Rhine, with about 18 troops of horses and dragoons. In the aftermath of the Battle of Edgehill, in October of the same year, Richard Baxter moved to Coventry, and Abbot was one of those hearing him preach there. Baxter in writing on the Sabbath referred to &quot;my dear friend Mr. George Abbot&quot;. In his memoirs &quot;Reliquiæ Baxterianæ&quot;, Baxter placed Abbot&#x27;s defence of Caldecote House, where barns were burnt, in local context: royalists under Spencer Compton, 2nd Earl of Northampton were attacking Warwick Castle, defended by John Bridges, and Coventry, defended by John Barker.

Abbot was re-elected MP for Tamworth in 1645 for the Long Parliament and held the seat until his death in 1649. He died unmarried in his 44th year, and was buried in Caldecote church where his monument describes his defence of Caldecote.

==Legacy==
By his will, Abbot endowed a free school at Caldecote. It was supported by land left to it at Baddesley Ensor.

==Works==
Abbot was a lay theologian and scholar. His &quot;Whole Booke of Job Paraphrased, or made easy for any to understand&quot; (1640), was written in a terse style, and his &quot;Vindiciae Sabbathi&quot; (1641) influenced the Sabbatarian controversy. His &quot;The Whole Book of Psalms Paraphrased&quot; (1650) was published posthumously by Richard Vines, and dedicated to Joan Purefoy, his mother.

==Mistaken identifications==
Abbot has been confused with others of the same name and has been described as a clergyman, which he never was. His writings have been incorrectly attributed in some bibliographical authorities to a relation of George Abbot the archbishop of Canterbury. One of the sons of Sir Morris Abbot called George was also an MP in the Long Parliament but for the constituency of Guildford.

<text>A globular cluster is a spheroidal conglomeration of stars that is bound together by gravity, with a higher concentration of stars towards its center. It can contain anywhere from tens of thousands to many millions of member stars, all orbiting in a stable, compact formation. Globular clusters are similar in form to dwarf spheroidal galaxies, and though globular clusters were long held to be the more luminous of the two, discoveries of outliers had made the distinction between the two less clear by the early 21st century. Their name is derived from Latin (small sphere). Globular clusters are occasionally known simply as &quot;globulars&quot;.

Although one globular cluster, Omega Centauri, was observed in antiquity and long thought to be a star, recognition of the clusters&#x27; true nature came with the advent of telescopes in the 17th century. In early telescopic observations, globular clusters appeared as fuzzy blobs, leading French astronomer Charles Messier to include many of them in his catalog of astronomical objects that he thought could be mistaken for comets. Using larger telescopes, 18th-century astronomers recognized that globular clusters are groups of many individual stars. Early in the 20th century the distribution of globular clusters in the sky was some of the first evidence that the Sun is far from the center of the Milky Way.

Globular clusters are found in nearly all galaxies. In spiral galaxies like the Milky Way, they are mostly found in the outer spheroidal part of the galaxythe galactic halo. They are the largest and most massive type of star cluster, tending to be older, denser, and composed of lower abundances of heavy elements than open clusters, which are generally found in the disks of spiral galaxies. The Milky Way has more than 150 known globulars, and there may be many more.

Both the origin of globular clusters and their role in galactic evolution are unclear. Some are among the oldest objects in their galaxies and even the universe, constraining estimates of the universe&#x27;s age. Star clusters were formerly thought to consist of stars that all formed at the same time from one star-forming nebula, but nearly all globular clusters contain stars that formed at different times, or that have differing compositions. Some clusters may have had multiple episodes of star formation, and some may be remnants of smaller galaxies captured by larger galaxies.

==History of observations==

The first known globular cluster, now called M 22, was discovered in 1665 by Abraham Ihle, a German amateur astronomer. The cluster Omega Centauri, easily visible in the southern sky with the naked eye, was known to ancient astronomers like Ptolemy as a star, but was reclassified as a nebula by Edmond Halley in 1677, then finally as a globular cluster in the early 19th century by John Herschel. The French astronomer Abbé Lacaille listed NGC 104, , M 55, M 69, and in his 1751–1752 catalogue. The low resolution of early telescopes prevented individual stars in a cluster from being visually separated until Charles Messier observed M 4 in 1764.
When William Herschel began his comprehensive survey of the sky using large telescopes in 1782, there were 34 known globular clusters. Herschel discovered another 36 and was the first to resolve virtually all of them into stars. He coined the term &quot;globular cluster&quot; in his &quot;Catalogue of a Second Thousand New Nebulae and Clusters of Stars&quot; (1789). In 1914, Harlow Shapley began a series of studies of globular clusters, published across about forty scientific papers. He examined the clusters&#x27; RR Lyrae variables (stars which he assumed were Cepheid variables) and used their luminosity and period of variability to estimate the distances to the clusters. RR Lyrae variables were later found to be fainter than Cepheid variables, causing Shapley to overestimate the distances.
A large majority of the Milky Way&#x27;s globular clusters are found in the halo around the galactic core. In 1918, Shapley used this strongly asymmetrical distribution to determine the overall dimensions of the galaxy. Assuming a roughly spherical distribution of globular clusters around the galaxy&#x27;s center, he used the positions of the clusters to estimate the position of the Sun relative to the Galactic Center. He correctly concluded that the Milky Way&#x27;s center is in the Sagittarius constellation and not near the Earth. He overestimated the distance, finding typical globular cluster distances of ; the modern distance to the Galactic Center is roughly . Shapley&#x27;s measurements indicated the Sun is relatively far from the center of the galaxy, contrary to what had been inferred from the observed uniform distribution of ordinary stars. In reality most ordinary stars lie within the galaxy&#x27;s disk and are thus obscured by gas and dust in the disk, whereas globular clusters lie outside the disk and can be seen at much greater distances.

The count of known globular clusters in the Milky Way has continued to increase, reaching 83 in 1915, 93 in 1930, 97 by 1947, and 157 in 2010. The number of known globular clusters in the Milky Way reached 158 by the end of 2010, according to the European Southern Observatory, before two new globular clusters were discovered as part of the ESO’s VISTA (Visible and Infrared Survey Telescope for Astronomy) infrared survey, known as Variables in the Vía Láctea (VVV) survey, bringing the total to 160 known globular clusters. The two discovered by VISTA in 2011 are named VVV CL001 and VVV CL002.

Additional, undiscovered globular clusters are believed to be in the galactic bulge or hidden by the gas and dust of the Milky Way. For example, most of the Palomar Globular Clusters have only been discovered in the 1950s, with some located relatively close-by yet obscured by dust, while others reside in the very far reaches of the Milky Way halo. The Andromeda Galaxy, which is comparable in size to the Milky Way, may have as many as five hundred globulars. Every galaxy of sufficient mass in the Local Group has an associated system of globular clusters, as does almost every large galaxy surveyed. Some giant elliptical galaxies (particularly those at the centers of galaxy clusters), such as M 87, have as many as 13,000 globular clusters.

===Classification===
Shapley was later assisted in his studies of clusters by Henrietta Swope and Helen Sawyer Hogg. In 1927–1929, Shapley and Sawyer categorized clusters by the degree of concentration of stars toward each core. Their system, known as the Shapley–Sawyer Concentration Class, identifies the most concentrated clusters as Class I and ranges to the most diffuse Class XII. Astronomers from the Pontifical Catholic University of Chile proposed a new type of globular cluster on the basis of observational data in 2015: Dark globular clusters.
==Formation==
The formation of globular clusters is poorly understood. Globular clusters have traditionally been described as a simple star population formed from a single giant molecular cloud, and thus with roughly uniform age and metallicity (proportion of heavy elements in their composition). Modern observations show that nearly all globular clusters contain multiple populations; the globular clusters in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) exhibit a bimodal population, for example. During their youth, these LMC clusters may have encountered giant molecular clouds that triggered a second round of star formation. This star-forming period is relatively brief, compared with the age of many globular clusters. It has been proposed that this multiplicity in stellar populations could have a dynamical origin. In the Antennae Galaxy, for example, the Hubble Space Telescope has observed clusters of clustersregions in the galaxy that span hundreds of parsecs, in which many of the clusters will eventually collide and merge. Their overall range of ages and (possibly) metallicities could lead to clusters with a bimodal, or even multiple, distribution of populations.
Observations of globular clusters show that their stars primarily come from regions of more efficient star formation, and from where the interstellar medium is at a higher density, as compared to normal star-forming regions. Globular cluster formation is prevalent in starburst regions and in interacting galaxies. Some globular clusters likely formed in dwarf galaxies and were removed by tidal forces to join the Milky Way. In elliptical and lenticular galaxies there is a correlation between the mass of the supermassive black holes (SMBHs) at their centers and the extent of their globular cluster systems. The mass of the SMBH in such a galaxy is often close to the combined mass of the galaxy&#x27;s globular clusters.

No known globular clusters display active star formation, consistent with the hypothesis that globular clusters are typically the oldest objects in their galaxy and were among the first collections of stars to form. Very large regions of star formation known as super star clusters, such as Westerlund 1 in the Milky Way, may be the precursors of globular clusters.

Many of the Milky Way&#x27;s globular clusters have a retrograde orbit (meaning that they revolve around the galaxy in the reverse of the direction the galaxy is rotating), including the most massive, Omega Centauri. Its retrograde orbit suggests it may be a remnant of a dwarf galaxy captured by the Milky Way.

==Composition==
Globular clusters are generally composed of hundreds of thousands of low-metal, old stars. The stars found in a globular cluster are similar to those in the bulge of a spiral galaxy but confined to a spheroid in which half the light is emitted within a radius of only a few to a few tens of parsecs. They are free of gas and dust, and it is presumed that all the gas and dust was long ago either turned into stars or blown out of the cluster by the massive first-generation stars.

Globular clusters can contain a high density of stars; on average about 0.4stars per cubic parsec, increasing to 100 or 1000stars/pc in the core of the cluster. In comparison, the stellar density around the Sun is roughly 0.1 stars/pc. The typical distance between stars in a globular cluster is about one light year, but at its core the separation between stars averages about a third of a light yearthirteen times closer than the Sun is to its nearest neighbor, Proxima Centauri.

Globular clusters are thought to be unfavorable locations for planetary systems. Planetary orbits are dynamically unstable within the cores of dense clusters because of the gravitational perturbations of passing stars. A planet orbiting at one astronomical unit around a star that is within the core of a dense cluster, such as 47 Tucanae, would survive only on the order of a hundred million years. There is a planetary system orbiting a pulsar (PSRB1620−26) that belongs to the globular cluster M4, but these planets likely formed after the event that created the pulsar.

Some globular clusters, like Omega Centauri in the Milky Way and Mayall II in the Andromeda Galaxy, are extraordinarily massive, measuring several million solar masses () and having multiple stellar populations. Both are evidence that supermassive globular clusters formed from the cores of dwarf galaxies that have been consumed by larger galaxies. About a quarter of the globular cluster population in the Milky Way may have been accreted this way, as with more than 60% of the globular clusters in the outer halo of Andromeda.

===Heavy element content===
Globular clusters normally consist of Population II stars which, compared with Population I stars such as the Sun, have a higher proportion of hydrogen and helium and a lower proportion of heavier elements. Astronomers refer to these heavier elements as &quot;metals&quot; (distinct from the material concept) and to the proportions of these elements as the metallicity. Produced by stellar nucleosynthesis, the metals are recycled into the interstellar medium and enter a new generation of stars. The proportion of metals can thus be an indication of the age of a star in simple models, with older stars typically having a lower metallicity.

The Dutch astronomer Pieter Oosterhoff observed two special populations of globular clusters, which became known as &quot;Oosterhoff groups&quot;. The second group has a slightly longer period of RR Lyrae variable stars. While both groups have a low proportion of metallic elements as measured by spectroscopy, the metal spectral lines in the stars of Oosterhoff typeI (OoI) cluster are not quite as weak as those in typeII (OoII), and so typeI stars are referred to as &quot;metal-rich&quot; (e.g. Terzan 7), while typeII stars are &quot;metal-poor&quot; (e.g. ESO 280-SC06). These two distinct populations have been observed in many galaxies, especially massive elliptical galaxies. Both groups are nearly as old as the universe itself and are of similar ages. Suggested scenarios to explain these subpopulations include violent gas-rich galaxy mergers, the accretion of dwarf galaxies, and multiple phases of star formation in a single galaxy. In the Milky Way, the metal-poor clusters are associated with the halo and the metal-rich clusters with the bulge.

A large majority of the metal-poor clusters in the Milky Way are aligned on a plane in the outer part of the galaxy&#x27;s halo. This observation supports the view that typeII clusters were captured from a satellite galaxy, rather than being the oldest members of the Milky Way&#x27;s globular cluster system as was previously thought. The difference between the two cluster types would then be explained by a time delay between when the two galaxies formed their cluster systems.

===Exotic components===
Close interactions and near-collisions of stars occur relatively often in globular clusters because of their high star density. These chance encounters give rise to some exotic classes of starssuch as blue stragglers, millisecond pulsars, and low-mass X-ray binarieswhich are much more common in globular clusters. How blue stragglers form remains unclear, but most models attribute them to interactions between stars, such as stellar mergers, the transfer of material from one star to another, or even an encounter between two binary systems. The resulting star has a higher temperature than other stars in the cluster with comparable luminosity and thus differs from the main-sequence stars formed early in the cluster&#x27;s existence. Some clusters have two distinct sequences of blue stragglers, one bluer than the other.

Astronomers have searched for black holes within globular clusters since the 1970s. The required resolution for this task is exacting; it is only with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) that the first claimed discoveries were made, in 2002 and 2003. Based on HST observations, other researchers suggested the existence of a (solar masses) intermediate-mass black hole in the globular cluster M15 and a black hole in the Mayall II cluster of the Andromeda Galaxy. Both X-ray and radio emissions from MayallII appear consistent with an intermediate-mass black hole; however, these claimed detections are controversial.

The heaviest objects in globular clusters are expected to migrate to the cluster center due to mass segregation. One research group pointed out that the mass-to-light ratio should rise sharply towards the center of the cluster, even without a black hole, in both M15 and Mayall II. Observations from 2018 find no evidence for an intermediate-mass black hole in any globular cluster, including M15, but cannot definitively rule out one with a mass of . Finally, in 2023, an analysis of HST and the Gaia spacecraft data from the closest globular cluster, Messier 4, revealed an excess mass of roughly in the center of this cluster, which appears to not be extended. This could thus be considered as kinematic evidence for an intermediate-mass black hole (even if an unusually compact cluster of compact objects like white dwarfs, neutron stars or stellar-mass black holes cannot be completely discounted).

The confirmation of intermediate-mass black holes in globular clusters would have important ramifications for theories of galaxy development as being possible sources for the supermassive black holes at their centers. The mass of these supposed intermediate-mass black holes is proportional to the mass of their surrounding clusters, following a pattern previously discovered between supermassive black holes and their surrounding galaxies.

==Hertzsprung–Russell diagrams==
Hertzsprung–Russell diagrams (H–R diagrams) of globular clusters allow astronomers to determine many of the properties of their populations of stars. An H–R diagram is a graph of a large sample of stars plotting their absolute magnitude (their luminosity, or brightness measured from a standard distance), as a function of their color index. The color index, roughly speaking, measures the color of the star; positive color indices indicate a reddish star with a cool surface temperature, while negative values indicate a bluer star with a hotter surface. Stars on an H–R diagram mostly lie along a roughly diagonal line sloping from hot, luminous stars in the upper left to cool, faint stars in the lower right. This line is known as the main sequence and represents the primary stage of stellar evolution. The diagram also includes stars in later evolutionary stages such as the cool but luminous red giants.

Constructing an H–R diagram requires knowing the distance to the observed stars to convert apparent into absolute magnitude. Because all the stars in a globular cluster have about the same distance from Earth, a color–magnitude diagram using their observed magnitudes looks like a shifted H–R diagram (because of the roughly constant difference between their apparent and absolute magnitudes). This shift is called the distance modulus and can be used to calculate the distance to the cluster. The modulus is determined by comparing features (like the main sequence) of the cluster&#x27;s color–magnitude diagram to corresponding features in an H–R diagram of another set of stars, a method known as spectroscopic parallax or main-sequence fitting.

===Properties===
Since globular clusters form at once from a single giant molecular cloud, a cluster&#x27;s stars have roughly the same age and composition. A star&#x27;s evolution is primarily determined by its initial mass, so the positions of stars in a cluster&#x27;s H–R or color–magnitude diagram mostly reflect their initial masses. A cluster&#x27;s H–R diagram, therefore, appears quite different from H–R diagrams containing stars of a wide variety of ages. Almost all stars fall on a well-defined curve in globular cluster H–R diagrams, and that curve&#x27;s shape indicates the age of the cluster. A more detailed H–R diagram often reveals multiple stellar populations as indicated by the presence of closely separated curves, each corresponding to a distinct population of stars with a slightly different age or composition. Observations with the Wide Field Camera 3, installed in 2009 on the Hubble Space Telescope, made it possible to distinguish these slightly different curves.

The most massive main-sequence stars have the highest luminosity and will be the first to evolve into the giant star stage. As the cluster ages, stars of successively lower masses will do the same. Therefore, the age of a single-population cluster can be measured by looking for those stars just beginning to enter the giant star stage, which form a &quot;knee&quot; in the H–R diagram called the main-sequence turnoff, bending to the upper right from the main-sequence line. The absolute magnitude at this bend is directly a function of the cluster&#x27;s age; an age scale can be plotted on an axis parallel to the magnitude.

The morphology and luminosity of globular cluster stars in H–R diagrams are influenced by numerous parameters, many of which are still actively researched. Recent observations have overturned the historical paradigm that all globular clusters consist of stars born at exactly the same time, or sharing exactly the same chemical abundance. Some clusters feature multiple populations, slightly differing in composition and age; for example, high-precision imagery of cluster NGC 2808 discerned three close, but distinct, main sequences. Further, the placements of the cluster stars in an H–R diagram (including the brightnesses of distance indicators) can be influenced by observational biases. One such effect, called blending, arises when the cores of globular clusters are so dense that observations see multiple stars as a single target. The brightness measured for that seemingly single star is thus incorrecttoo bright, given that multiple stars contributed. In turn, the computed distance is incorrect, so the blending effect can introduce a systematic uncertainty into the cosmic distance ladder and may bias the estimated age of the universe and the Hubble constant.

===Consequences===
The blue stragglers appear on the H–R diagram as a series diverging from the main sequence in the direction of brighter, bluer stars. White dwarfs (the final remnants of some Sun-like stars), which are much fainter and somewhat hotter than the main-sequence stars, lie on the bottom-left of an H–R diagram. Globular clusters can be dated by looking at the temperatures of the coolest white dwarfs, often giving results as old as 12.7 billion years. In comparison, open clusters are rarely older than about half a billion years. The ages of globular clusters place a lower bound on the age of the entire universe, presenting a significant constraint in cosmology. Astronomers were historically faced with age estimates of clusters older than their cosmological models would allow, but better measurements of cosmological parameters, through deep sky surveys and satellites, appear to have resolved this issue.

Studying globular clusters sheds light on how the composition of the formational gas and dust affects stellar evolution; the stars&#x27; evolutionary tracks vary depending on the abundance of heavy elements. Data obtained from these studies are then used to study the evolution of the Milky Way as a whole.

==Morphology==

In contrast to open clusters, most globular clusters remain gravitationally bound together for time periods comparable to the lifespans of most of their stars. Strong tidal interactions with other large masses result in the dispersal of some stars, leaving behind &quot;tidal tails&quot; of stars removed from the cluster.

After formation, the stars in the globular cluster begin to interact gravitationally with each other. The velocities of the stars steadily change, and the stars lose any history of their original velocity. The characteristic interval for this to occur is the relaxation time, related to the characteristic length of time a star needs to cross the cluster and the number of stellar masses. The relaxation time varies by cluster, but a typical value is on the order of one billion years.

Although globular clusters are generally spherical in form, ellipticity can form via tidal interactions. Clusters within the Milky Way and the Andromeda Galaxy are typically oblate spheroids in shape, while those in the Large Magellanic Cloud are more elliptical.

===Radii===

Astronomers characterize the morphology (shape) of a globular cluster by means of standard radii: the core radius (&quot;r&quot;&quot;c&quot;), the half-light radius (&quot;r&quot;&quot;h&quot;), and the tidal or Jacobi radius (&quot;r&quot;&quot;t&quot;). The radius can be expressed as a physical distance or as a subtended angle in the sky. Considering a radius around the core, the surface luminosity of the cluster steadily decreases with distance, and the core radius is the distance at which the apparent surface luminosity has dropped by half. A comparable quantity is the half-light radius, or the distance from the core containing half the total luminosity of the cluster; the half-light radius is typically larger than the core radius.

Most globular clusters have a half-light radius of less than ten parsecs (pc), although some globular clusters have very large radii, like NGC 2419 (rh = 18 pc) and Palomar 14 (rh = 25 pc). The half-light radius includes stars in the outer part of the cluster that happen to lie along the line of sight, so theorists also use the half-mass radius (&quot;r&quot;&quot;m&quot;)the radius from the core that contains half the total mass of the cluster. A small half-mass radius, relative to the overall size, indicates a dense core. Messier 3 (M3), for example, has an overall visible dimension of about 18 arc minutes, but a half-mass radius of only 1.12 arc minutes.

The tidal radius, or Hill sphere, is the distance from the center of the globular cluster at which the external gravitation of the galaxy has more influence over the stars in the cluster than does the cluster itself. This is the distance at which the individual stars belonging to a cluster can be separated away by the galaxy. The tidal radius of M3, for example, is about forty arc minutes, or about 113 pc.

===Mass segregation, luminosity and core collapse===
In most Milky Way clusters, the surface brightness of a globular cluster as a function of decreasing distance to the core first increases, then levels off at a distance typically 1–2 parsecs from the core. About 20% of the globular clusters have undergone a process termed &quot;core collapse&quot;. The luminosity in such a cluster increases steadily all the way to the core region.
Models of globular clusters predict that core collapse occurs when the more massive stars in a globular cluster encounter their less massive counterparts. Over time, dynamic processes cause individual stars to migrate from the center of the cluster to the outside, resulting in a net loss of kinetic energy from the core region and leading the region&#x27;s remaining stars to occupy a more compact volume. When this gravothermal instability occurs, the central region of the cluster becomes densely crowded with stars, and the surface brightness of the cluster forms a power-law cusp. A massive black hole at the core could also result in a luminosity cusp. Over a long time, this leads to a concentration of massive stars near the core, a phenomenon called mass segregation.

The dynamical heating effect of binary star systems works to prevent an initial core collapse of the cluster. When a star passes near a binary system, the orbit of the latter pair tends to contract, releasing energy. Only after this primordial supply of energy is exhausted can a deeper core collapse proceed. In contrast, the effect of tidal shocks as a globular cluster repeatedly passes through the plane of a spiral galaxy tends to significantly accelerate core collapse.

Core collapse may be divided into three phases. During a cluster&#x27;s adolescence, core collapse begins with stars nearest the core. Interactions between binary star systems prevents further collapse as the cluster approaches middle age. The central binaries are either disrupted or ejected, resulting in a tighter concentration at the core. The interaction of stars in the collapsed core region causes tight binary systems to form. As other stars interact with these tight binaries they increase the energy at the core, causing the cluster to re-expand. As the average time for a core collapse is typically less than the age of the galaxy, many of a galaxy&#x27;s globular clusters may have passed through a core collapse stage, then re-expanded.
The HST has provided convincing observational evidence of this stellar mass-sorting process in globular clusters. Heavier stars slow down and crowd at the cluster&#x27;s core, while lighter stars pick up speed and tend to spend more time at the cluster&#x27;s periphery. The cluster 47 Tucanae, made up of about one million stars, is one of the densest globular clusters in the Southern Hemisphere. This cluster was subjected to an intensive photographic survey that obtained precise velocities for nearly fifteen thousand stars in this cluster.

The overall luminosities of the globular clusters within the Milky Way and the Andromeda Galaxy each have a roughly Gaussian distribution, with an average magnitude Mv and a variance σ2. This distribution of globular cluster luminosities is called the Globular Cluster Luminosity Function (GCLF). For the Milky Way, Mv = , σ = . The GCLF has been used as a &quot;standard candle&quot; for measuring the distance to other galaxies, under the assumption that globular clusters in remote galaxies behave similarly to those in the Milky Way.

===N-body simulations===
Computing the gravitational interactions between stars within a globular cluster requires solving the N-body problem. The naive computational cost for a dynamic simulation increases in proportion to &quot;N&quot; 2 (where N is the number of objects), so the computing requirements to accurately simulate a cluster of thousands of stars can be enormous. A more efficient method of simulating the N-body dynamics of a globular cluster is done by subdivision into small volumes and velocity ranges, and using &quot;probabilities&quot; to describe the locations of the stars. Their motions are described by means of the Fokker–Planck equation, often using a model describing the mass density as a function of radius, such as a Plummer model. The simulation becomes more difficult when the effects of binaries and the interaction with external gravitation forces (such as from the Milky Way galaxy) must also be included. In 2010 a low-density globular cluster&#x27;s lifetime evolution was able to be directly computed, star-by-star.

Completed N-body simulations have shown that stars can follow unusual paths through the cluster, often forming loops and falling more directly toward the core than would a single star orbiting a central mass. Additionally, some stars gain sufficient energy to escape the cluster due to gravitational interactions that result in a sufficient increase in velocity. Over long periods of time this process leads to the dissipation of the cluster, a process termed evaporation. The typical time scale for the evaporation of a globular cluster is 1010 years. The ultimate fate of a globular cluster must be either to accrete stars at its core, causing its steady contraction, or gradual shedding of stars from its outer layers.

Binary stars form a significant portion of stellar systems, with up to half of all field stars and open cluster stars occurring in binary systems. The present-day binary fraction in globular clusters is difficult to measure, and any information about their initial binary fraction is lost by subsequent dynamical evolution. Numerical simulations of globular clusters have demonstrated that binaries can hinder and even reverse the process of core collapse in globular clusters. When a star in a cluster has a gravitational encounter with a binary system, a possible result is that the binary becomes more tightly bound and kinetic energy is added to the solitary star. When the massive stars in the cluster are sped up by this process, it reduces the contraction at the core and limits core collapse.

===Intermediate forms===
Cluster classification is not always definitive; objects have been found that can be classified in more than one category. For example, BH 176 in the southern part of the Milky Way has properties of both an open and a globular cluster.

In 2005 astronomers discovered a new, &quot;extended&quot; type of star cluster in the Andromeda Galaxy&#x27;s halo, similar to the globular cluster. The three new-found clusters have a similar star count to globular clusters and share other characteristics, such as stellar populations and metallicity, but are distinguished by their larger sizeseveral hundred light years acrossand some hundred times lower density. Their stars are separated by larger distances; parametrically, these clusters lie somewhere between a globular cluster and a dwarf spheroidal galaxy.
The formation of these extended clusters is likely related to accretion. It is unclear why the Milky Way lacks such clusters; Andromeda is unlikely to be the sole galaxy with them, but their presence in other galaxies remains unknown.

==Tidal encounters==
When a globular cluster comes close to a large mass, such as the core region of a galaxy, it undergoes a tidal interaction. The difference in gravitational strength between the nearer and further parts of the cluster results in an asymmetric, tidal force. A &quot;tidal shock&quot; occurs whenever the orbit of a cluster takes it through the plane of a galaxy.

Tidal shocks can pull stars away from the cluster halo, leaving only the core part of the cluster; these trails of stars can extend several degrees away from the cluster. These tails typically both precede and follow the cluster along its orbit and can accumulate significant portions of the original mass of the cluster, forming clump-like features. The globular cluster Palomar 5, for example, is near the apogalactic point of its orbit after passing through the Milky Way. Streams of stars extend outward toward the front and rear of the orbital path of this cluster, stretching to distances of 13,000 light years. Tidal interactions have stripped away much of Palomar5&#x27;s mass; further interactions with the galactic core are expected to transform it into a long stream of stars orbiting the Milky Way in its halo.

The Milky Way is in the process of tidally stripping the Sagittarius Dwarf Spheroidal Galaxy of stars and globular clusters through the Sagittarius Stream. As many as 20% of the globular clusters in the Milky Way&#x27;s outer halo may have originated in that galaxy. Palomar 12, for example, most likely originated in the Sagittarius Dwarf Spheroidal but is now associated with the Milky Way. Tidal interactions like these add kinetic energy into a globular cluster, dramatically increasing the evaporation rate and shrinking the size of the cluster. The increased evaporation accelerates the process of core collapse.

==Planets==
Astronomers are searching for exoplanets of stars in globular star clusters. A search in 2000 for giant planets in the globular cluster came up negative, suggesting that the abundance of heavier elements – low in globular clusters – necessary to build these planets may need to be at least 40% of the Sun&#x27;s abundance. Because terrestrial planets are built from heavier elements such as silicon, iron and magnesium, member stars have a far lower likelihood of hosting Earth-mass planets than stars in the solar neighborhood. Globular clusters are thus unlikely to host habitable terrestrial planets.

A giant planet was found in the globular cluster , orbiting a pulsar in the binary star system . The planet&#x27;s eccentric and highly inclined orbit suggests it may have been formed around another star in the cluster, then &quot;exchanged&quot; into its current arrangement. The likelihood of close encounters between stars in a globular cluster can disrupt planetary systems; some planets break free to become rogue planets, orbiting the galaxy. Planets orbiting close to their star can become disrupted, potentially leading to orbital decay and an increase in orbital eccentricity and tidal effects. In 2024, a gas giant or brown dwarf was found to closely orbit the pulsar &quot;M62H&quot;, where the name indicates that the planetary system belongs to the globular cluster Messier 62.

<text>Captain George Vancouver (; 22 June 1757 – 10 May 1798) was a British Royal Navy officer best known for his 1791–1795 expedition, which explored and charted North America&#x27;s northwestern Pacific Coast regions, including the coasts of what became the Canadian province of British Columbia and the U.S. states of Alaska, Washington, Oregon, and California. The expedition also explored the Hawaiian Islands and the southwest coast of Australia.

Various places named for Vancouver include Vancouver Island; the city of Vancouver in British Columbia; Vancouver River on the Sunshine Coast of British Columbia; Vancouver, Washington, in the United States; Mount Vancouver on the Canadian–US border between Yukon and Alaska; and New Zealand&#x27;s fourth-highest mountain, also Mount Vancouver.

==Early life==
Vancouver was born on 22 June 1757 in the seaport town of King&#x27;s Lynn in Norfolk, England. He was the sixth and youngest child of John Jasper Vancouver, a Dutch-born deputy collector of customs, and Bridget Berners. The surname Vancouver comes from Coevorden, Drenthe province, Netherlands (Koevern in Dutch Low Saxon).

==Career==
===Royal Navy===
In 1771, at age 13, Vancouver entered the Royal Navy as a &quot;young gentleman&quot;, a future candidate for midshipman. He was nominally classified as an able seaman (AB), but sailed as one of the midshipmen aboard , on James Cook&#x27;s second voyage (1772–1775) searching for &quot;Terra Australis&quot;. He also sailed with Cook&#x27;s third voyage (1776–1780), this time aboard &quot;Resolution&quot;″s companion ship, , and was present during the first European sighting and exploration of the Hawaiian Islands.

Upon his return to Britain in October 1780, Vancouver was commissioned as a lieutenant and posted aboard the sloop , initially on escort and patrol duty in the English Channel and North Sea. He accompanied the ship when it left Plymouth on 11 February 1782 for the West Indies. On 7 May 1782 he was appointed fourth lieutenant of the 74-gun ship of the line , which was at the time part of the British West Indies Fleet and assigned to patrolling the French-held Leeward Islands. Vancouver subsequently saw action at the Battle of the Saintes (April 1782), wherein he distinguished himself. Vancouver returned to England in June 1783.

===Spanish Empire-sponsored voyages===
In the late 1780s, the Spanish Empire commissioned an expedition to the Pacific Northwest. In 1789, the Nootka Crisis developed, and Spain and Britain came close to war over ownership of Nootka Sound on contemporary Vancouver Island, and – of greater importance – over the right to colonise and settle the Pacific Northwest coast. Henry Roberts had recently taken command of the survey ship (a new vessel named in honour of the ship on Cook&#x27;s voyage) with the prospect of another round-the-world voyage, and Roberts selected Vancouver as his first lieutenant, but they both were then posted to other warships due to the crisis. Vancouver went with Joseph Whidbey to the 74-gun ship of the line . When the first Nootka Convention ended the crisis in 1790, Vancouver was given command of &quot;Discovery&quot; to take possession of Nootka Sound and to survey the coasts.

===Explorations===
====Vancouver Expedition====

Departing England with two ships, HMS &quot;Discovery&quot; and , on 1 April 1791, Vancouver commanded an expedition charged with exploring the Pacific region. In its first year the expedition travelled to Cape Town, Australia, New Zealand, Tahiti, and Hawaii (then known as the Sandwich Islands), collecting botanical samples and surveying coastlines along the way. He formally claimed at Possession Point, King George Sound Western Australia, which became the town of Albany, Western Australia, for the British. Proceeding to North America, Vancouver followed the coasts of modern-day Oregon and Washington northward. In April 1792 he encountered American Captain Robert Gray off the coast of Oregon just prior to Gray&#x27;s sailing up the Columbia River.

Vancouver entered the Strait of Juan de Fuca, between Vancouver Island and the modern Washington state mainland, on 29 April 1792. His orders included a survey of every inlet and outlet on the west coast of the mainland, all the way north to Alaska. Most of this work was in small craft propelled by both sail and oar; manoeuvring larger sail-powered vessels in uncharted waters was generally impractical and dangerous.

Vancouver named many features for his officers, friends, associates, and his ship &quot;Discovery&quot;, including:
* Mount Baker – after &quot;Discovery&#x27;s&quot; 3rd Lieutenant Joseph Baker, the first on the expedition to spot it
* Mount St. Helens – after his friend, Alleyne Fitzherbert, 1st Baron St Helens
* Puget Sound – after &quot;Discovery&#x27;s&quot; 2nd lieutenant Peter Puget, who explored its southern reaches.
* Mount Rainier – after his friend, Rear Admiral Peter Rainier.
* Port Gardner and Port Susan, Washington – after his former commander Vice Admiral Sir Alan Gardner and his wife Susannah, Lady Gardner.
* Whidbey Island – after naval engineer Joseph Whidbey.
* Discovery Passage, Discovery Island, Discovery Bay, Port Discovery and Discovery Park (Seattle).
* Orford Reef, after Horace Walpole
After a Spanish expedition in 1791, Vancouver was the second European to enter Burrard Inlet on 13 June 1792, naming it for his friend Sir Harry Burrard. It is the modern-day main harbour area of the City of Vancouver beyond Stanley Park. He surveyed Howe Sound and Jervis Inlet over the next nine days. Then, on his 35th birthday on 22 June 1792, he returned to Point Grey, the present-day location of the University of British Columbia. Here he unexpectedly met a Spanish expedition led by Dionisio Alcalá Galiano and Cayetano Valdés y Flores. Vancouver was &quot;mortified&quot; (&quot;his word&quot;) to learn they already had a crude chart of the Strait of Georgia based on the 1791 exploratory voyage of José María Narváez the year before, under command of Francisco de Eliza. For three weeks they cooperatively explored the Georgia Strait and the Discovery Islands area before sailing separately towards Nootka Sound.

After the summer surveying season ended, in August 1792, Vancouver went to Nootka, then the region&#x27;s most important harbour, on contemporary Vancouver Island. Here he was to receive any British buildings and lands returned by the Spanish from claims by Francisco de Eliza for the Spanish crown. The Spanish commander, Juan Francisco Bodega y Quadra, was very cordial and he and Vancouver exchanged the maps they had made, but no agreement was reached; they decided to await further instructions. At this time, they decided to name the large island on which Nootka was proven to be located as &quot;Quadra and Vancouver Island&quot;. Years later, as Spanish influence declined, the name was shortened to simply Vancouver Island.
While at Nootka Sound Vancouver acquired Robert Gray&#x27;s chart of the lower Columbia River. Gray had entered the river during the summer before sailing to Nootka Sound for repairs. Vancouver realised the importance of verifying Gray&#x27;s information and conducting a more thorough survey. In October 1792, he sent Lieutenant William Robert Broughton with several boats up the Columbia River. Broughton got as far as the Columbia River Gorge, sighting and naming Mount Hood.

Vancouver sailed south along the coast of Spanish Alta California, entered San Francisco Bay, later visiting Monterey; in both places, he was warmly received by the Spanish. Later he visited Chumash villages at Point Conception and near Mission San Buenaventura. Vancouver spent the winter in continuing exploration of the Sandwich Islands, the contemporary name of the islands of Hawaii.

====Further explorations====
The next year, 1793, he returned to British Columbia and proceeded further north, unknowingly missing the overland explorer Alexander Mackenzie by only 48 days. He got to 56°30&#x27;N, having explored north from Point Menzies in Burke Channel to the northwest coast of Prince of Wales Island. He sailed around the latter island, as well as circumnavigating Revillagigedo Island and charting parts of the coasts of Mitkof, Zarembo, Etolin, Wrangell, Kuiu and Kupreanof Islands. With worsening weather, he sailed south to Alta California, hoping to find Bodega y Quadra and fulfil his territorial mission, but the Spaniard was not there. The Spanish governor refused to let a foreign official into the interior. Vancouver noted that the region&#x27;s &quot;only defenses against foreign attack are a few poor cannons&quot;. He again spent the winter in the Sandwich Islands.

In 1794, he first went to Cook Inlet, the northernmost point of his exploration, and from there followed the coast south. Boat parties charted the east coasts of Chichagof and Baranof Islands, circumnavigated Admiralty Island, explored to the head of Lynn Canal, and charted the rest of Kuiu Island and nearly all of Kupreanof Island. He then set sail for Great Britain by way of Cape Horn, returning in September 1795, thus completing a circumnavigation of South America.

==Later life==
Impressed by the view from Richmond Hill, Vancouver retired to Petersham, then in Surrey and part of modern London.

Vancouver faced difficulties when he returned home to England. The accomplished and politically well-connected naturalist Archibald Menzies complained that his servant had been pressed into service during a shipboard emergency; sailing master Joseph Whidbey had a competing claim for pay as expedition astronomer; and Thomas Pitt, 2nd Baron Camelford, whom Vancouver had disciplined for numerous infractions and eventually sent home in disgrace, proceeded to harass him publicly and privately.

Pitt&#x27;s allies, including his cousin, Prime Minister William Pitt the Younger, attacked Vancouver in the press. Thomas Pitt took a more direct approach; on 29 August 1796 he sent Vancouver a letter heaping many insults on the head of his former captain, and challenging him to a duel. Vancouver gravely replied that he was unable &quot;in a private capacity to answer for his public conduct in his official duty,&quot; and offered instead to submit to formal examination by flag officers. Pitt chose instead to stalk Vancouver, ultimately assaulting him on a London street corner. The terms of their subsequent legal dispute required both parties to keep the peace, but nothing stopped Vancouver&#x27;s civilian brother Charles from interposing and giving Pitt blow after blow until onlookers restrained the attacker. Charges and counter-charges flew in the press, with the wealthy Camelford faction having the greater firepower until Vancouver, ailing from his long naval service, died.

==Death==

Vancouver, at one time amongst Britain&#x27;s greatest explorers and navigators, died in obscurity on 10 May 1798 at the age of 40, less than three years after completing his voyages and expeditions. No official cause of death was stated, as the medical records pertaining to Vancouver were destroyed; one doctor named John Naish claimed Vancouver died from kidney failure, while others believed it was a hyperthyroid condition.

Vancouver&#x27;s grave is in the churchyard of St Peter&#x27;s Church, Petersham, in the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames, England. The Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company placed a memorial plaque in the church in 1841. His grave in Portland stone, renovated in the 1960s, is now Grade II listed in view of its historical associations.

==Legacy==

===Navigation===

Vancouver determined that the Northwest Passage did not exist at the latitudes that had long been suggested. His charts of the North American northwest coast were so extremely accurate that they served as the key reference for coastal navigation for generations. Robin Fisher, the academic vice-president of Mount Royal University in Calgary and author of two books on Vancouver, states:
However, Vancouver failed to discover two of the largest and most important rivers on the Pacific coast, the Fraser River and the Columbia River. He also missed the Skeena River near Prince Rupert in northern British Columbia. Vancouver did eventually learn of the Columbia River before he finished his survey—from Robert Gray, captain of the American merchant ship that conducted the first Euroamerican sailing of the Columbia River on 11 May 1792, after first sighting it on an earlier voyage in 1788. However, neither the Columbia River nor the Fraser River were included on any of Vancouver&#x27;s charts.

Stephen R. Bown noted in &quot;Mercator&#x27;s World&quot; magazine&#x27;s November/December 1999 issue that:

While it is difficult to comprehend how Vancouver missed the Fraser River, much of this river&#x27;s delta was subject to flooding and summer freshet which prevented the captain from spotting any of its great channels as he sailed the entire shoreline from Point Roberts, Washington, to Point Grey in 1792. The Spanish expeditions to the Pacific Northwest, with the 1791 Francisco de Eliza expedition preceding Vancouver by a year, had also missed the Fraser River although they knew from its muddy plume that there was a major river located nearby.

Vancouver generally established a rapport with both Indigenous peoples and European trappers. Historical records show Vancouver enjoyed good relations with native leaders both in Hawaii – with King Kamehameha I as well as the Pacific Northwest and California. Vancouver&#x27;s journals exhibit a high degree of sensitivity to the indigenous populations he encountered. He wrote of meeting the Chumash people, and of his exploration of a small island on the Californian coast on which an important burial site was marked by a sepulchre of &quot;peculiar character&quot; lined with boards and fragments of military instruments lying near a square box covered with mats. Vancouver states:

Vancouver also displayed contempt in his journals towards unscrupulous western traders who provided guns to natives, writing:

Robin Fisher notes that Vancouver&#x27;s &quot;relationships with aboriginal groups were generally peaceful; indeed, his detailed survey would not have been possible if they had been hostile.&quot; While there were hostile incidents at the end of Vancouver&#x27;s last season – the most serious of which involved a clash with the Tlingit people at Behm Canal in southeast Alaska in 1794 – these were the exceptions to Vancouver&#x27;s exploration of the US and Canadian Northwest coast.

Despite a long history of warfare between Britain and Spain, Vancouver maintained excellent relations with his Spanish counterparts and even fêted a Spanish sea captain aboard his ship during his 1792 trip to the Vancouver region.

===250th birthday commemorations===
 Canada Post issued a $1.55 postage stamp to commemorate the 250th anniversary of Vancouver&#x27;s birth, on 22 June 2007. The stamp has an embossed image of Vancouver seen from behind as he gazes forward towards a mountainous coastline. This may be the first Canadian stamp not to show the subject&#x27;s face.

The City of Vancouver in Canada organised a celebration to commemorate the 250th anniversary of Vancouver&#x27;s birth, in June 2007 at the Vancouver Maritime Museum. The one-hour festivities included the presentation of a massive 63 by 114 centimetre carrot cake, the firing of a gun salute by the Royal Canadian Artillery&#x27;s 15th Field Regiment and a performance by the Vancouver Firefighter&#x27;s Band.
Vancouver&#x27;s then-mayor, Sam Sullivan, officially declared 22 June 2007 to be &quot;George Day&quot;.

The Musqueam (xʷməθkʷəy̓əm) Elder sɁəyeɬəq (Larry Grant) attended the festivities and acknowledged that some of his people might disapprove of his presence, but also noted:

==Origins of the family name==
There has been some debate about the origins of the Vancouver name. It is now commonly accepted that the name Vancouver derives from the expression &quot;van Coevorden&quot;, meaning &quot;(originating) from Coevorden&quot;, a city in the northeast of the Netherlands. This city is apparently named after the &quot;Coeverden&quot; family of the 13th–15th century.

In the 16th century, a number of businessmen from the Coevorden area (and the rest of the Netherlands) moved to England. Some of them were known as &quot;Van Coeverden&quot;. Others adopted the surname Oxford, as in oxen fording (a river), which is approximately the English translation of &quot;Coevorden&quot;. However, it is not the exact name of the noble family mentioned in the history books that claim Vancouver&#x27;s noble lineage: that name was Coeverden not Coevorden.

In the 1970s, Adrien Mansvelt, a former consul-general of the Netherlands based in Vancouver, published a collation of information in both historical and genealogical journals and in the &quot;Vancouver Sun&quot; newspaper. Mansvelt&#x27;s theory was later presented by the city during the Expo 86 World&#x27;s Fair, as historical fact. The information was then used by historian W. Kaye Lamb in his book &quot;A Voyage of Discovery to the North Pacific Ocean and Round the World, 1791–1795&quot; (1984).

W. Kaye Lamb, in summarising Mansvelt&#x27;s 1973 research, observes evidence of close family ties between the Vancouver family of Britain and the Van Coeverden family of the Netherlands as well as George Vancouver&#x27;s own words from his diaries in referring to his Dutch ancestry:

In 2006 John Robson, a librarian at the University of Waikato, conducted his own research into George Vancouver&#x27;s ancestry, which he published in an article in the &quot;British Columbia History&quot; journal. Robson theorises that Vancouver&#x27;s forebears may have been Flemish rather than Dutch; he believes that Vancouver is descended from the Vangover family of Ipswich in Suffolk and Colchester in Essex. Those towns had a significant Flemish population in the 16th and 17th centuries.

George Vancouver named the south point of what is now Couverden Island, Alaska, &quot;Point Couverden&quot; during his exploration of the North American Pacific coast, in honour of his family&#x27;s hometown of Coevorden. It is located at the western point of entry to Lynn Canal in southeastern Alaska.

==Works by George Vancouver==

The Admiralty instructed Vancouver to publish a narrative of his voyage which he started to write in early 1796 in Petersham. At the time of his death the manuscript covered the period up to mid-1795. The work, &quot;A Voyage of Discovery to the North Pacific Ocean, and Round the World&quot;, was completed by his brother John and published in three volumes in the autumn of 1798. A second edition was published in 1801 in six volumes. 
* &quot;A Voyage of Discovery to the North Pacific Ocean: And Round the World, Volume 1&quot;
* &quot;A Voyage of Discovery to the North Pacific Ocean: And Round the World, Volume 2&quot;
* &quot;A Voyage of Discovery to the North Pacific Ocean: And Round the World, Volume 3&quot;

A modern annotated edition (1984) by W. Kaye Lamb was renamed &quot;The Voyage of George Vancouver 1791–1795&quot;, and published in four volumes by the Hakluyt Society of London, England.

<doc id="12872" wikidata="Q268206" url="?curid=12872" title="Great Vowel Shift">
<text>The Great Vowel Shift was a series of pronunciation changes in the vowels of the English language that took place primarily between the 1400s and 1600s (the transition period from Middle English to Early Modern English), beginning in southern England and today having influenced effectively all dialects of English. Through this massive vowel shift, the pronunciation of all Middle English long vowels altered. Some consonant sounds also changed, specifically becoming silent; the term &quot;Great Vowel Shift&quot; is occasionally used to include these consonantal changes.

The standardization of English spelling began in the 15th and 16th centuries; the Great Vowel Shift is the major reason English spellings now often deviate considerably from how they represent pronunciations. The Great Vowel Shift was first studied by Otto Jespersen (1860–1943), a Danish linguist and Anglicist, who coined the term.

==Causes==
The causes of the Great Vowel Shift are unknown and have been a source of intense scholarly debate; as yet, there is no firm consensus. The greatest changes occurred during the 15th and 16th centuries, and their origins are at least partly phonetic.

* Population migration: This is the most accepted theory; some scholars have argued that the rapid migration of peoples to the southeast of England from the east and central Midlands of England following the Black Death produced a clash of dialects that made Londoners distinguish their speech from the immigrants who came from other English cities by changing their vowel system.
* French loanwords: Others argue that the influx of French loanwords was a major factor in the shift. 
* Middle-class hypercorrection: Yet others assert that because of the increasing prestige of French pronunciations among the middle classes (perhaps related to the English aristocracy&#x27;s switching from French to English around this time), a process of hypercorrection may have started a shift that unintentionally resulted in vowel pronunciations that are inaccurate imitations of French pronunciations. 
* War with France: An opposing theory states that the wars with France and general anti-French sentiments caused hypercorrection deliberately to make English sound less like French.

==Overall changes==
The main difference between the pronunciation of Middle English in the year 1400 and Modern English (Received Pronunciation) is in the value of the long vowels.

Long vowels in Middle English had &quot;continental&quot; values, much like those in Italian and Standard German; in standard Modern English, they have entirely different pronunciations. The differing pronunciations of English vowel letters do not stem from the Great Shift as such but rather because English spelling did not adapt to the changes.

German had undergone vowel changes quite similar to the Great Shift slightly earlier. Still, the spelling was changed accordingly (e.g., Middle High German → modern German &quot;to bite&quot;).

This timeline uses representative words to show the main vowel changes between late Middle English in the year 1400 and Received Pronunciation in the mid-20th century. The Great Vowel Shift occurred in the lower half of the table, between 1400 and 1600–1700.

The changes after 1700 are not considered part of the Great Vowel Shift. Pronunciation is given in the International Phonetic Alphabet:

==Details==

===Middle English vowel system===

Before the Great Vowel Shift, Middle English in Southern England had seven long vowels, . The vowels occurred in, for example, the words &quot;mite&quot;, &quot;meet&quot;, &quot;meat&quot;, &quot;mate&quot;, &quot;boat&quot;, &quot;boot&quot;, and &quot;bout&quot;, respectively.

The words had very different pronunciations in Middle English from those in Modern English:
* Long &quot;i&quot; in &quot;mite&quot; was pronounced as , so Middle English &quot;mite&quot; sounded similar to Modern English &quot;meet&quot;.
* Long &quot;e&quot; in &quot;meet&quot; was pronounced as , so Middle English &quot;meet&quot; sounded similar to modern Australian English &quot;met&quot; but pronounced longer.
*Long &quot;a&quot; in &quot;mate&quot; was pronounced as , with a vowel similar to the broad &quot;a&quot; of &quot;ma&quot;.
* Long &quot;o&quot; in &quot;boot&quot; was pronounced as , so Middle English &quot;boot&quot; sounded similar to modern Southern England, Australian and New Zealand English &quot;bought&quot;.

In addition, Middle English had: 
* Long in &quot;meat&quot;, like Received Pronunciation &quot;air&quot;, or modern short &quot;e&quot; in &quot;met&quot; but pronounced longer.
* Long in &quot;boat&quot;, with a vowel similar to &quot;aw&quot; in modern Northern England English &quot;law&quot;, or like modern Southern England, Australian and New Zealand English &quot;bot&quot; but pronounced longer.
* Long in &quot;bout&quot;, similar to Modern English &quot;boot&quot;.

===Changes===
After around 1300, the long vowels of Middle English began changing in pronunciation as follows:

* Diphthongisation – The two close vowels, , became diphthongs (vowel breaking). 
* Vowel raising – The other five, , underwent an increase in tongue height (raising).

These changes occurred over several centuries and can be divided into two phases. The first phase affected the close vowels and the close-mid vowels : were raised to , and became the diphthongs or . The second phase affected the open vowel and the open-mid vowels : were raised, in most cases changing to .

The Great Vowel Shift changed vowels without merger, so Middle English before the vowel shift had the same number of vowel phonemes as Early Modern English after the vowel shift.

After the Great Vowel Shift, some vowel phonemes began merging. Immediately after the Great Vowel Shift, the vowels of &quot;meet&quot; and &quot;meat&quot; were different, but they are merged in Modern English, and both words are pronounced as .

However, during the 16th and the 17th centuries, there were many different mergers, and some mergers can be seen in individual Modern English words like &quot;great&quot;, which is pronounced with the vowel as in &quot;mate&quot; rather than the vowel as in &quot;meat&quot;.

This is a simplified picture of the changes that happened between late Middle English (late ME), Early Modern English (EModE), and today&#x27;s English (ModE). Pronunciations in 1400, 1500, 1600, and 1900 are shown. To hear recordings of the sounds, click the phonetic symbols.

Before labial consonants and also after , did not shift, and remains as in &quot;soup&quot;.

===First phase===
The first phase of the Great Vowel Shift affected the Middle English close-mid vowels , as in &quot;beet&quot; and &quot;boot&quot;, and the close vowels , as in &quot;bite&quot; and &quot;out&quot;. The close-mid vowels became close , and the close vowels became diphthongs. The first phase was completed in 1500, meaning that by that time, words like &quot;beet&quot; and &quot;boot&quot; had lost their Middle English pronunciation and were pronounced with the same vowels as in Modern English. The words &quot;bite&quot; and &quot;out&quot; were pronounced with diphthongs, but not the same diphthongs as in Modern English.
Scholars agree that the Middle English close vowels became diphthongs around 1500, but disagree about what diphthongs they changed to. According to Lass, the words &quot;bite&quot; and &quot;out&quot; after diphthongisation were pronounced as and , similar to American English &quot;bait&quot; and &quot;oat&quot; . Later, the diphthongs shifted to , then , and finally to Modern English . This sequence of events is supported by the testimony of orthoepists before Hodges in 1644.

However, many scholars such as , , and argue for theoretical reasons that, contrary to what 16th-century witnesses report, the vowels were immediately centralised and lowered to .

Evidence from Northern English and Scots (see below) suggests that the close-mid vowels were the first to shift. As the Middle English vowels were raised towards , they forced the original Middle English out of place and caused them to become diphthongs . This type of sound change, in which one vowel&#x27;s pronunciation shifts so that it is pronounced like a second vowel, and the second vowel is forced to change its pronunciation, is called a push chain.

However, according to professor Jürgen Handke, for some time, there was a phonetic split between words with the vowel and the diphthong , in words where the Middle English shifted to the Modern English . For an example, &quot;high&quot; was pronounced with the vowel , and &quot;like&quot; and &quot;my&quot; were pronounced with the diphthong . Therefore, for logical reasons, the close vowels could have diphthongised before the close-mid vowels raised. Otherwise, &quot;high&quot; would probably rhyme with &quot;thee&quot; rather than &quot;my&quot;. This type of chain is called a drag chain.

===Second phase===
The second phase of the Great Vowel Shift affected the Middle English open vowel , as in &quot;mate&quot;, and the Middle English open-mid vowels , as in &quot;meat&quot; and &quot;boat&quot;. Around 1550, Middle English was raised to . Then, after 1600, the new was raised to , with the Middle English open-mid vowels raised to close-mid .
===Later mergers===
During the first and the second phases of the Great Vowel Shift, long vowels were shifted without merging with other vowels, but after the second phase, several vowels merged. The later changes also involved the Middle English diphthong , as in &quot;day&quot;, which often (but not always, see the &quot;pane-pain&quot; merger) monophthongised to , and merged with Middle English as in &quot;mate&quot; or as in &quot;meat&quot;.

During the 16th and 17th centuries, several different pronunciation variants existed among different parts of the population for words like &quot;meet&quot;, &quot;meat&quot;, &quot;mate&quot;, and &quot;day&quot;. Different pairs or trios of words were merged in pronunciation in each pronunciation variant. Four different pronunciation variants are shown in the table below. The fourth pronunciation variant gave rise to Modern English pronunciation. In Modern English, &quot;meet&quot; and &quot;meat&quot; are merged in pronunciation and both have the vowel , and &quot;mate&quot; and &quot;day&quot; are merged with the diphthong , which developed from the 16th-century long vowel .
Modern English typically has the &quot;meet&quot;–&quot;meat&quot; merger: both &quot;meet&quot; and &quot;meat&quot; are pronounced with the vowel . Words like &quot;great&quot; and &quot;steak&quot;, however, have merged with &quot;mate&quot; and are pronounced with the vowel , which developed from the shown in the table above. Before historic some of these vowels merged with , , , 

==Northern English and Scots==
The Great Vowel Shift affected other dialects and the standard English of southern England but in different ways. In Northern England, the shift did not operate on the long back vowels because they had undergone an earlier shift. Similarly, the dialect in Scotland had a different vowel system before the Great Vowel Shift, as had shifted to in Early Scots. In the Scots equivalent of the Great Vowel Shift, the long vowels , and shifted to , and by the Middle Scots period and remained unaffected.

The first step in the Great Vowel Shift in Northern and Southern English is shown in the table below. The Northern English developments of Middle English and were different from Southern English. In particular, the Northern English vowels in &quot;bite&quot;, in &quot;feet&quot;, and in &quot;boot&quot; shifted, while the vowel in &quot;house&quot; did not. These developments below fall under the label &quot;older&quot; to refer to Scots and a more conservative and increasingly rural Northern sound, while &quot;younger&quot; refers to a more mainstream Northern sound largely emerging just since the twentieth century.
The vowel systems of Northern and Southern Middle English immediately before the Great Vowel Shift were different in one way. In Northern Middle English, the back close-mid vowel in &quot;boot&quot; had already shifted to front (a sound change known as fronting), like the long &quot;&quot; in German &quot;hear&quot;. Thus, Southern English had a back close-mid vowel , but Northern English did not:

In Northern and Southern English, the first step of the Great Vowel Shift raised the close-mid vowels to become close. Northern Middle English had two close-mid vowels – in &quot;feet&quot; and in &quot;boot&quot; – which were raised to and . Later on, Northern English changed to in many dialects (though not in all, see ), so that &quot;boot&quot; has the same vowel as &quot;feet&quot;. Southern Middle English had two close-mid vowels – in &quot;feet&quot; and in &quot;boot&quot; – which were raised to and .

In Southern English, the close vowels in &quot;bite&quot; and in &quot;house&quot; shifted to become diphthongs, but in Northern English, in &quot;bite&quot; shifted but in &quot;house&quot; did not.

If the vowel systems at the time of the Great Vowel Shift caused the difference between the Northern and Southern vowel shifts, did not shift because there was no back mid vowel in Northern English. In Southern English, shifting of to could have caused diphthongisation of original , but because Northern English had no back close-mid vowel to shift, the back close vowel did not diphthongise.

<text>Gilbert Arthur à Beckett (April 7, 1837 – October 15, 1891) was an English writer.

== Biography ==
Beckett was born at Portland House Hammersmith, on 7 April 1837, the eldest son of the civil servant and humorist Gilbert Abbott à Beckett and the composer Mary Anne à Beckett, daughter of Joseph Glossop, clerk of the cheque to the hon. corps of gentlemen-at-arms.
His brother was Arthur William à Beckett. 
He graduated from Christ Church, Oxford, as a Westminster scholar in 1860.
He was entered at Lincoln&#x27;s Inn on 15 October 1857, but gave his attention chiefly to drama, producing &quot;Diamonds and Hearts&quot; at the Haymarket Theatre in 1867; this was followed by other light comedies. 
His adaptation of a French operetta by Émile Jonas called &quot;The Two Harlequins&quot; opened the new Gaiety Theatre, London in 1868, together with his distant cousin, W. S. Gilbert&#x27;s, &quot;Robert the Devil&quot; and another piece.

Beckett&#x27;s pieces include numerous burlesques and pantomimes, the libretti of &quot;Savonarola&quot; (Hamburg, 1884) and &quot;The Canterbury Pilgrims&quot; (Drury Lane, 1884) for the music of Dr. C. V. Stanford.
With the composer Alfred Cellier, Beckett wrote the operetta &quot;Two Foster Brothers&quot; (St. George&#x27;s Hall, 1877).

In 1879, he had been asked by Tom Taylor, the editor of &quot;Punch&quot;, to follow the example of his younger brother Arthur, and become a regular member of the staff of &quot;Punch.&quot; 
Three years later he was &#x27;appointed to the Table.&#x27; 
The &quot;Punch&quot; dinners &#x27;were his greatest pleasure, and he attended them with regularity, although the paralysis of the legs, the result of falling down the stairway of Gower Street station, rendered his locomotion, and especially the mounting of Mr. Punch&#x27;s staircase, a matter of painful exertion&#x27;. 
To &quot;Punch&quot; he contributed both prose and verse; he wrote, in greater part, the admirable parody of a boy&#x27;s sensational shocker (March 1882), and he developed Jerrold&#x27;s idea of humorous bogus advertisements under the heading &#x27;How we advertise now.&#x27; 
The idea of one of Sir John Tenniel&#x27;s best cartoons for &quot;Punch,&quot; entitled &#x27;Dropping the Pilot,&#x27; illustrative of Bismarck&#x27;s resignation in 1889, was due to him.

Apart from his work on &#x27;Punch,&#x27; he wrote songs and music for the German Reeds&#x27; entertainment, while in 1873 and 1874 he was collaborator in two dramatic productions which evoked a considerable amount of public attention.
On 3 March 1873, &quot;The Happy Land&quot; was given at the Court Theatre, 1873, a daring political satire and burlesque of W. S. Gilbert&#x27;s &quot;The Wicked World&quot;. 
In this amusing piece of banter three statesmen (Gladstone, Lowe, and Ayrton) were represented as visiting Fairyland in order to impart to the inhabitants the secrets of popular government. The actors representing &#x27;Mr. G.,&#x27; &#x27;Mr. L.,&#x27; and &#x27;Mr. A.&#x27; were dressed so as to resemble the ministers satirised, and the representation elicited a question in the House of Commons and an official visit of the Lord Chamberlain to the theatre, with the result that the actors had to change their &#x27;make-up.&#x27;

In the following year, he furnished the &#x27;legend&#x27; to Herman Merivale&#x27;s tragedy &#x27;The White Pilgrim,&#x27; first given at the Court in February 1874. 
At the close of his life he furnished the &#x27;lyrics&#x27; and most of the book for the operetta &quot;La Cigale&quot;, which at the time of his death was nearing its four hundredth performance at the Lyric Theatre.

In 1889, he suffered a great shock from the death by drowning of his only son, and he died in London on 15 October 1891, and was buried in Mortlake cemetery.

==Legacy==
&quot;Punch&quot; devoted some appreciative stanzas to his memory, bearing the epigraph &#x27;Wearing the white flower of a blameless life&#x27; (24 Oct. 1891). His portrait appeared in the well-known drawing of &#x27;The Mahogany Tree&#x27; (&quot;Punch&quot;, Jubilee Number, 18 July 1887), and likenesses were also given in the &#x27;Illustrated London News&#x27; and in Spielmann&#x27;s &#x27;History of Punch&#x27; (1895).

==Family==
He married Emily, eldest daughter of William Hunt, J.P., of Bath, and his only daughter Minna married in 1896 Mr. Hugh Clifford, C.M.G., governor of Labuan and British North Borneo.

<doc id="12878" wikidata="Q4527514" url="?curid=12878" title="George Gordon, 1st Earl of Aberdeen">
<text>George Gordon, 1st Earl of Aberdeen (3 October 163720 April 1720), was a Lord Chancellor of Scotland.

==Early life==
Gordon, born on 3 October 1637, the second son of Sir John Gordon, 1st Baronet, of Haddo, Aberdeenshire, (executed in 1644);
 and his wife, Mary Forbes. He graduated MA, and was chosen professor at King&#x27;s College, Aberdeen, in 1658. Subsequently, he travelled and studied civil law abroad.

==Career==
At the Restoration the sequestration of his father&#x27;s lands was annulled, and in 1665 he succeeded by the death of his elder brother as the &quot;3rd Baronet Gordon, of Haddo&quot; and to the family estates. He returned home in 1667, was admitted advocate in 1668 and gained a high legal reputation. He represented Aberdeenshire in the Parliament of Scotland of 1669 to 1674, the Convention of Estates of 1678 and the following parliamentary assembly of 1681/82. During his first session he strongly opposed the projected union of England and Scotland. In November 1678 he was made a Privy Counsellor for Scotland, and in 1680 was raised to the bench as Lord Haddo. He was a leading member of the Duke of York&#x27;s administration, was created a Lord of the Articles in June and in November 1681 Lord President of the Privy Council. The same year he is reported as moving in the council for the torture of witnesses.

In 1682 he was made Lord Chancellor of Scotland, and was created, on 13 November, Earl of Aberdeen, Viscount Formartine, and Lord Haddo, Methlick, Tarves and Kellie, in the Scottish peerage, being appointed also Sheriff of Aberdeen and Sheriff of Edinburgh later the same year.

Burnet reflected unfavourably upon him, writing of him, &quot;...a proud and covetous man ... the new chancellor exceeded all that had gone before him.

He executed the laws enforcing religious conformity with severity, and filled the parish churches, but resisted the excessive measures of tyranny prescribed by the English government; and in consequence of an intrigue of the Duke of Queensberry and Lord Perth, who gained the duchess of Portsmouth with a present of £27,000, he was dismissed in 1684.

After his fall he was subjected to various petty prosecutions by his victorious rivals with the view of discovering some act of maladministration on which to found a charge against him, but the investigations only served to strengthen his credit. He took an active part in parliament in 1685 and 1686, but remained a non-juror during the whole of William&#x27;s reign, being frequently fined for his non-attendance, and took the oaths for the first time after Anne&#x27;s accession, on 11 May 1703.

In the great affair of the Union in 1707, while protesting against the completion of the treaty till the act declaring the Scots aliens should be repealed, he refused to support the opposition to the measure itself and refrained from attending parliament when the treaty was settled.

He is described by John Mackay as, &quot;...very knowing in the laws and constitution of his country and is believed to be the solidest statesman in Scotland, a fine orator, speaks slow but sure.

His person was said to be deformed, and his &quot;want of mine or deportment&quot; was alleged as a disqualification for the office of Lord Chancellor.

==Family==
He married Anne Lockhart, daughter and (eventual) sole heiress of George Lockhart of Tarbrax and Anne Lockhart. They had several children:
*John Gordon (1673–1675)
*George Gordon, Lord Haddo (1674after 1694), d.v.p.s.p.
*Lady Anne Gordon (1675–1709), married Alexander Montgomerie, 9th Earl of Eglinton
*James Gordon (1676–?), d.v.p.s.p.
*Lady Jean Gordon (1678–?)
*William Gordon, 2nd Earl of Aberdeen (1679–30 March 1746)
*Lady Martha Gordon (1681– ?), married John Udny of Udny in March 1701
*Lady Mary Gordon (1682–1753), married Alexander Fraser, 13th Lord Saltoun, 26 October 1707
*Lady Margaret Gordon (d.1738)

His only surviving son, William, succeeded him as 2nd earl of Aberdeen. He died on 20 April 1720, having amassed a large fortune.

<doc id="12879" wikidata="Q24631" url="?curid=12879" title="George Hamilton-Gordon, 4th Earl of Aberdeen">
<text>George Hamilton-Gordon, 4th Earl of Aberdeen (28 January 178414 December 1860), styled Lord Haddo from 1791 to 1801, was a British statesman, diplomat and landowner, successively a Tory, Conservative and Peelite politician and specialist in foreign affairs. He served as Prime Minister from 1852 until 1855 in a coalition between the Whigs and Peelites, with Radical and Irish support. The Aberdeen ministry was filled with powerful and talented politicians, whom Aberdeen was largely unable to control and direct. Despite his efforts to avoid this happening, his ministry took Britain into the Crimean War, and fell when the war&#x27;s conduct became unpopular. Subsequently, Aberdeen retired from politics.

Born into a wealthy family with the largest estates in Scotland, his personal life was marked by the loss of both parents by the time he was eleven, and of his first wife after only seven years of a happy marriage. His daughters died young, and his relations with his sons were difficult. He travelled extensively in Europe, including Greece, and he had a serious interest in the classical civilisations and their archaeology. His Scottish estates having been neglected by his father, he devoted himself (when he came of age) to modernising them according to the latest standards.

After 1812 he became a diplomat, and in 1813, at age 29, was given the critically important embassy to Vienna, where he organised and financed the sixth coalition that defeated Napoleon. His rise in politics was equally rapid and lucky, and &quot;two accidents — Canning&#x27;s death and Wellington&#x27;s impulsive acceptance of the Canningite resignations&quot; led to his becoming Foreign Secretary for Prime Minister Wellington in 1828 despite &quot;an almost ludicrous lack of official experience&quot;; he had been a minister for less than six months. After holding the position for two years, followed by another cabinet role, by 1841 his experience led to his appointment as Foreign Secretary again under Robert Peel for a longer term. His diplomatic successes include organizing the coalition against Napoleon in 1812–1814, normalizing relations with post-Napoleonic France, settling the old border dispute between Canada and the United States, and ending the First Opium War with China in 1842, whereby Hong Kong was obtained. Aberdeen was a poor speaker, but this scarcely mattered in the House of Lords. He exhibited a &quot;dour, awkward, occasionally sarcastic exterior&quot;. His friend William Ewart Gladstone, said of him that he was &quot;the man in public life of all others whom I have &quot;loved&quot;. I say emphatically &quot;loved&quot;. I have &quot;loved&quot; others, but never like him&quot;.

==Early life==
Born in Edinburgh on 28 January 1784, he was the eldest son of George Gordon, Lord Haddo, son of George Gordon, 3rd Earl of Aberdeen. His mother was Charlotte, youngest daughter of William Baird of Newbyth. He lost his father on 18 October 1791 and his mother in 1795, and he was brought up by Henry Dundas, 1st Viscount Melville, and William Pitt the Younger. He was educated at Harrow, and St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge, where he graduated with a Master of Arts in 1804. Before this, however, he had become Earl of Aberdeen on his grandfather&#x27;s death in 1801, and had travelled all over Europe. On his return to Britain, he founded the Society of Athenian Travellers. In 1805, he married Lady Catherine Elizabeth, daughter of John Hamilton, 1st Marquess of Abercorn.

==Political and diplomatic career, 1805–1828==
In December 1805, Lord Aberdeen took his seat as a Tory Scottish representative peer in the House of Lords. In 1808, he was created a Knight of the Thistle. Following the death of his wife from tuberculosis in 1812 he joined the Foreign Service. He was appointed Ambassador Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary to Austria, and signed the Treaty of Töplitz between Britain and Austria in Vienna in October 1813. In the company of the Austrian Emperor, Francis II, he was an observer at the decisive Coalition victory of the Battle of Leipzig in October 1813; he had met Napoleon in his earlier travels. He became one of the central diplomatic figures in European diplomacy at this time, and he was one of the British representatives at the Congress of Châtillon in February 1814, and at the negotiations which led to the Treaty of Paris in May of that year.

Aberdeen was greatly affected by the aftermath of war which he witnessed at first hand. He wrote home:The near approach of war and its effects are horrible beyond what you can conceive. The whole road from Prague to [Teplitz] was covered with waggons full of wounded, dead, and dying. The shock and disgust and pity produced by such scenes are beyond what I could have supposed possible...the scenes of distress and misery have sunk deeper in my mind. I have been quite haunted by them.

Returning home he was created a peer of the United Kingdom as Viscount Gordon, of Aberdeen in the County of Aberdeen (1814), and made a member of the Privy Council.

In July 1815, he married his former sister-in-law Harriet, daughter of John Douglas, and widow of James Hamilton, Viscount Hamilton; the marriage was much less happy than his first. During the ensuing thirteen years Aberdeen took a less prominent part in public affairs.

==Political career, 1828–1852==
Lord Aberdeen served as Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster between January and June 1828 and subsequently as Foreign Secretary until 1830 under the Duke of Wellington. He resigned with Wellington over the Reform Bill of 1832.

He was Secretary of State for War and the Colonies in the first Peel ministry (December 1834 - April 1835), and again Foreign Secretary between 1841 and 1846 under Sir Robert Peel (second Peel ministry). It was during his second stint as Foreign Secretary that he had the harbor settlement of &#x27;Little Hong Kong&#x27;, on the south side of Hong Kong Island, named after him. It was probably the most productive period of his career; he settled two disagreements with the US: the northeast boundary dispute by the Webster-Ashburton Treaty (1842), and the Oregon dispute by the Oregon Treaty of 1846. He enjoyed the trust of Queen Victoria, which was still important for a Foreign Secretary. He worked closely with Henry Bulwer, his ambassador to Madrid, to help arrange marriages for Queen Isabella and her younger sister the Infanta Luisa Fernanda. They helped stabilize Spain&#x27;s internal and external relations. He sought better relations with France, relying on his friendship with Guizot, but Britain was annoyed with France on a series of issues, especially French colonial policies, the right to search slave ships, the French desire to control Belgium, disputes in the Pacific and the French intervention in Morocco.

===In opposition===
Aberdeen again followed his leader and resigned with Peel over the issue of the Corn Laws. After Peel&#x27;s death in July 1850 he became the recognised leader of the Peelites. In August 1847, a general election of Parliament had been held which resulted in the election of 325 Tory/Conservative party members to Parliament. This represented 42.7% of the seats in Parliament. The main opposition to the Tory/Conservative Party was the Whig Party, which had 292 seats.

While the Peelites agreed with the Whigs on issues dealing with international trade, there were other issues on which the Peelites disagreed with the Whigs. Indeed, Lord Aberdeen&#x27;s own dislike of the Ecclesiastical Titles Assumption Bill, the rejection of which he failed to secure in 1851, prevented him from joining the Whig government of Lord John Russell in that year. Additionally, 113 of the members of Parliament elected in 1847 were Free Traders. These members agreed with the Peelites on the repeal of the &quot;Corn Laws&quot;, but they felt that the tariffs on &quot;all&quot; consumer products should be removed.

Furthermore, 36 members of Parliament elected in 1847 were members of the &quot;Irish Brigade&quot;, who voted with the Peelites and the Whigs for the repeal of the Corn Laws because they sought an end the Great Irish Famine by means of cheaper wheat and bread prices for the poor and middle classes in Ireland. Currently, however, the Free Traders and the Irish Brigade had disagreements with the Whigs that prevented them from joining with the Whigs to form a government. Accordingly, the Tory/Conservative Party leader the Earl of Derby was asked to form a &quot;minority government&quot;. Derby appointed Benjamin Disraeli as the Chancellor of the Exchequer for the minority government. The general election in July 1852 had no clear winner.

When in December 1852 Disraeli submitted his budget to Parliament on behalf of the minority government, the Peelites, the Free Traders, and the Irish Brigade were all alienated by the proposed budget. Accordingly, those groups suddenly forgot their differences with the Whig Party and voted with the Whigs against the proposed budget. The vote was 286 in favour of the budget and 305 votes against the budget. Because the leadership of the minority government had made the vote on the budget vote a vote of confidence, the defeat of the Disraeli budget was a &quot;vote of no confidence&quot; in the minority government and meant its downfall. Lord Aberdeen was asked to form a new government; Gladstone became his Chancellor.

==Prime Minister, 1852–1855==
 Following the downfall of the Tory/Conservative minority government under Lord Derby in December 1852, Lord Aberdeen formed a new government from the coalition of Free Traders, Peelites, and Whigs that had voted no confidence in the minority government. Lord Aberdeen was able to put together a coalition that held 53.8% of the seats of Parliament. Thus Lord Aberdeen, a Peelite, became Prime Minister and headed a coalition ministry of Whigs and Peelites.

Although united on international trade issues and on questions of domestic reform, his cabinet also contained Lord Palmerston and Lord John Russell, who were certain to differ on questions of foreign policy. Charles Greville wrote in his &quot;Memoirs&quot;, &quot;In the present cabinet are five or six first-rate men of equal, or nearly equal, pretensions, none of them likely to acknowledge the superiority or defer to the opinions of any other, and every one of these five or six considering himself abler and more important than their premier&quot;; and Sir James Graham wrote, &quot;It is a powerful team, but it will require good driving&quot;, which Aberdeen was unable to provide. During the administration, much trouble was caused by the rivalry between Palmerston and Russell, and over the course of it Palmerston managed to out-manoeuvre Russell to emerge as the Whig heir apparent. The cabinet also included a single Radical, Sir William Molesworth, but much later, when justifying to the Queen his own new appointments, Gladstone told her: &quot;For instance, even in Ld Aberdeen&#x27;s Govt, in 52, Sir William Molesworth had been selected, at that time, a very advanced Radical, but who was perfectly harmless, &amp; took little, or no part... He said these people generally became very moderate, when they were in office&quot;, which she admitted had been the case.

One of the foreign policy issues on which Palmerston and Russell disagreed was the type of relationship that Britain should have with France and especially France&#x27;s ruler, Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte. Bonaparte was the nephew of the famous Napoleon Bonaparte, who had become dictator and then Emperor of France from 1804 until 1814. The younger Bonaparte had been elected to a three-year term as President of the Second Republic of France on 20 December 1848. The Constitution of the Second Republic limited the President to a single term in office. Thus, Louis Bonaparte would be unable to succeed himself and after 20 December 1851 would no longer be president. Consequently, on 2 December 1851, shortly before the end of his single three-year term in office was to expire, Bonaparte staged a coup against the Second Republic in France, disbanded the elected Constituent Assembly, arrested some of the Republican leaders, and declared himself Emperor Napoleon III of France. This coup upset many democrats in England as well as in France. Some British government officials felt that Louis Bonaparte was seeking foreign adventure in the spirit of his uncle, Napoleon I. Consequently, these officials felt that any close association with Bonaparte would eventually lead Britain into another series of wars, like the wars with France and Napoleon dating from 1793 until 1815. British relations with France had scarcely improved since 1815. As prime minister, the Earl of Aberdeen was one of these officials who feared France and Bonaparte.

However, other British government officials were beginning to worry more about the rising political dominance of the Russian Empire in eastern Europe and the corresponding decline of the Ottoman Empire. Lord Palmerston at the time of Louis Bonaparte&#x27;s 2 December 1851 coup was serving as the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs in the Whig government of Prime Minister Lord John Russell. Without informing the rest of the cabinet or Queen Victoria, Palmerston had sent a private note to the French ambassador endorsing Louis Bonaparte&#x27;s coup and congratulating Louis Bonaparte himself on the coup. Queen Victoria and members of the Russell government demanded that Palmerston be dismissed as Foreign Minister. Russell requested Palmerston&#x27;s resignation and Palmerston reluctantly provided it.

In February 1852, Palmerston took revenge on Russell by voting with the Conservatives in a &quot;no confidence&quot; vote against the Russell government. This brought an end to the Russell Whig government and set the stage for a general election in July 1852 which eventually brought the Conservatives to power in a minority government under the Earl of Derby. Later in the year, another problem facing the Earl of Aberdeen in the formation of his own new government in December 1852 was Lord John Russell himself. Russell was the leader of the Whig Party, the largest group in the coalition government. Consequently, Lord Aberdeen, was required to appoint Russell as the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, which he had done on 29 December 1852. However, Russell sometimes liked to use this position to speak for the whole government, as if he were the prime minister. In 1832, Russell had been nicknamed &quot;Finality John&quot; because of his statement that the 1832 Reform Act had just been approved by both the House of Commons and the House of Lords would be the &quot;final&quot; expansion of the vote in Britain. There would be no further extension of the ballot to the common people of Britain. However, as political pressure in favour of further reform had risen over the twenty years since 1832, Russell had changed his mind. Russell had said, in January 1852, that he intended to introduce a new reform bill into the House of Commons which would equalise the populations of the districts from which members of Parliament were elected. Probably as a result of their continuing feud, Palmerston declared himself against this Reform Bill of 1852. As a result, support for the bill dwindled and Russell was forced to change his mind again and not introduce any Reform Bill in 1852.

In order to form the coalition government, the Earl of Aberdeen had been required to appoint both Palmerston and Russell to his cabinet. Because of the controversy surrounding Palmerston&#x27;s removal as Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Palmerston could not now be appointed Foreign Minister again so soon after his removal from that position. Accordingly, on 28 December 1852, Aberdeen appointed Palmerston as Home Secretary and appointed Russell as Foreign Minister.

==The &quot;Eastern Question&quot;==
Given the differences of opinion within the Lord Aberdeen cabinet over the direction of foreign policy with regard to relations between Britain and France under Napoleon III, it is not surprising that debate raged within the government as Louis Bonaparte, now assuming the title of Emperor Napoleon III. As Prime Minister of the Peelite/Whig coalition government, Aberdeen eventually led Britain into war on the side of the French and Ottomans against the Russian Empire. This war would eventually be called the Crimean War, but throughout the foreign policy negotiations surrounding the dismemberment of the Ottoman Empire, which would continue throughout the middle and end of nineteenth century, the problem would be referred to as the &quot;Eastern Question&quot;.

The cabinet was bitterly divided. Palmerston stirred up anti-reform feeling in Parliament and pro-war public opinion to out-maneuver Russell. The result was that the weak Aberdeen government went to war with Russia as the result of internal British political rivalries. Aberdeen accepted Russian arguments at face value because he sympathised with Russian interests against French pressure and was not in favour of the Crimean War. However, he was unable to resist the pressure that was being exerted on him by Palmerston&#x27;s faction. In the end, the Crimean War proved to be the downfall of his government.

The Eastern Question flared up on 2 December 1852, with the Napoleon&#x27;s coup against the Second Republic. As Napoleon III was forming his new imperial government, he sent an ambassador to the Ottoman Empire with instructions to assert France&#x27;s right to protect Christian sites in Jerusalem and the Holy Land. The Ottoman Empire agreed to this condition to avoid conflict or even war with France. Aberdeen, as Foreign Secretary in 1845, had himself tacitly authorised the construction of the first Anglican church in Jerusalem, following his predecessor&#x27;s commission in 1838 of the first European Consul in Jerusalem on Britain&#x27;s behalf, which lead to series of successive appointments by other nations. Both resulted from Lord Shaftesbury&#x27;s canvassing with substantial public support.

Nevertheless, Britain became increasingly worried about the situation in Turkey, and Prime Minister Aberdeen sent Lord Stratford de Redcliffe, a diplomat with vast experience in Turkey, as a special envoy to the Ottoman Empire to guard British interests. Russia protested the Turkish agreement with the French as a violation of the Treaty of Küçük Kaynarca of 1778, which ended the Russo-Turkish War (1768–1774). Under the treaty, the Russians had been granted the exclusive right to protect the Christian sites in the Holy Land. Accordingly, on 7 May 1853, the Russians sent Prince Alexander Sergeyevich Menshikov, one their premier statesmen, to negotiate a settlement of the issue. Prince Menshikov called the attention of the Turks to the fact that during the Russo-Turkish War, the Russians had occupied the Turkish-controlled provinces of Wallachia and Moldavia on the north bank of the Danube River, and he reminded them that pursuant to the Treaty of Küçük Kaynarca, the Russians had returned these &quot;Danubian provinces&quot; to Ottoman control in exchange for the right to protect the Christian sites in the Holy Land. Accordingly, the Turks reversed themselves and agreed with the Russians.

The French sent one of their premier ships-of-the-line, the &quot;Charlemagne&quot;, to the Black Sea as a show of force. In light of the French show of force, the Turks, again, reversed themselves and recognised the French right to protect the Christian sites. Lord Stratford de Redcliffe was advising the Ottomans during this time, and later it was alleged that he had been instrumental in persuading the Turks to reject the Russian arguments.

As war became inevitable, Aberdeen wrote to Russell:
The abstract justice of the cause, although indisputable, is but a poor consolation for the inevitable calamities of all war, or for a decision which I am not without fear may prove to have been impolitic and unwise. My conscience upbraids me the more, because seeing, as I did from the first, all that was to be apprehended, it is possible that by a little more energy and vigour, not on the Danube, but in Downing Street, it might have been prevented.

==Crimean War 1853–1856==
In response this latest change of mind by the Ottomans, the Russians on 2 July 1853 occupied the Turkish satellite states of Wallachia and Moldavia, as they had during the Russo-Turkish War of 1768–1774. Almost immediately, the Russian troops deployed along the northern banks of the Danube River, implying that they might cross the river. Aberdeen ordered the British Fleet to Constantinople and later into the Black Sea. On 23 October 1853, the Ottoman Empire declared war on Russia. A Russian naval raid on Sinope, on 30 November 1853, resulted in the destruction of the Turkish fleet in the battle of Sinope. When Russia ignored an Anglo-French ultimatum to abandon the Danubian provinces, Britain and France declared war on Russia on 28 March 1854. In September 1854, British and French troops landed on the Crimean peninsula at Eupatoria, north of Sevastopol. The Allied troops then moved across the Alma River on 20 September 1854 at the battle of Alma and set siege to the fort of Sevastopol.

A Russian attack on the allied supply base at Balaclava on 25 October 1854 was rebuffed. The Battle of Balaclava is noted for its famous (or rather infamous) Charge of the Light Brigade. On 5 November 1854, Russian forces tried to relieve the siege at Sevastopol and defeat the Allied armies in the field in the Battle of Inkerman. However, this attempt failed. Dissatisfaction as to the course of the war grew in England. As reports returned detailing the mismanagement of the conflict, Parliament began to investigate. On 29 January 1855, John Arthur Roebuck introduced a motion for the appointment of a select committee to enquire into the conduct of the war. This motion was carried by the large majority of 305 in favour and 148 against.

Treating this as a vote of no confidence in his government, Aberdeen resigned, and retired from active politics, speaking for the last time in the House of Lords in 1858. In visiting Windsor Castle to resign, he told the Queen: &quot;Nothing could have been better, he said than the feeling of the members towards each other. Had it not been for the incessant attempts of Ld John Russell to keep up party differences, it must be acknowledged that the experiment of a coalition had succeeded admirably. We discussed future possibilities &amp; agreed that nothing remained to be done, but to offer the Govt to Ld Derby...&quot;. The Queen continued to criticise Lord John Russell for his behaviour for the rest of his life; on his death in 1878 her journal records that he was &quot;A man of much talent, who leaves a name behind him, kind, &amp; good, with a great knowledge of the constitution, who behaved very well, on many trying occasions; but he was impulsive, very selfish (as shown on many occasions, especially during Ld Aberdeen&#x27;s administration) vain, &amp; often reckless &amp; imprudent&quot;.

== Relations with the United States==
British-American relations had been troublesome under Palmerston, but Aberdeen proved much more conciliatory, and worked well with Daniel Webster, the American Secretary of State who was himself an Anglophile. In 1842, Aberdeen sent Lord Ashburton to Washington to settle all disputes, especially the border between Canada and Maine, the boundary along the Great Lakes, the Oregon boundary, the African slave trade, the Caroline affair about boundaries in 1837 and the Creole case of 1841 involving a slave revolt on the high seas. The Webster–Ashburton Treaty of 1842 solved most of the problems amicably. Thus Maine got most of the disputed land, but Canada obtained a vital, strategic strip of land connecting it to a warm water port. Aberdeen helped solve the Oregon dispute amicably in 1846. However, as prime minister, Aberdeen had trouble with the United States. In 1854 an American naval vessel bombarded the mosquito port of Greytown, Nicaragua in retaliation for an insult; Britain protested. Later in 1846, the United States announced its intention of annexing Hawaii, and Britain not only complained but sent a naval force to make the point. Negotiations for reciprocal trade agreement between the United States and Canada dragged on for eight years until a reciprocity treaty was reached in 1854.

==Legacy==

Aberdeen was generally successful as a hard-working diplomat, but his reputation has suffered greatly because of the lack of military success in the Crimean War and from the ridicule of enemies such as Disraeli who regarded him as weak, inefficient, and cold. Before the Crimean debacle that ended his career, Aberdeen scored numerous diplomatic triumphs, starting in 1813-14 when as ambassador to the Austrian Empire he negotiated the alliances and financing that led to the defeat of Napoleon. In Paris, he normalized relations with the newly restored Bourbon government and convinced London it could be trusted. He worked well with top European diplomats such as his friends Klemens von Metternich in Vienna and François Guizot in Paris. He brought Britain into the center of Continental diplomacy on critical issues, such as the local wars in Greece, Portugal, and Belgium. Simmering troubles on numerous issues with the United States were ended by friendly compromises. He played a central role in winning the Opium Wars against China, gaining control of Hong Kong in the process.

==Family==

Lord Aberdeen married Lady Catherine Elizabeth (10 January 1784 – 29 February 1812; daughter of Lord Abercorn) on 28 July 1805. They had three daughters and a son, none of whom lived to be 21:
* Lady Jane Hamilton-Gordon (11 February 1807 – 18 August 1824) died aged 17
* Lady Charlotte Catherine Hamilton-Gordon (28 March 1808 – 24 July 1818) died aged 10
* Lady Alice Hamilton-Gordon (12 July 1809 – 21 April 1829) died aged 19
* Lord Haddo (born and died 23 November 1810), survived only one hour

After the death of his first wife, Aberdeen remarried Harriet Douglas (granddaughter of James Douglas, 14th Earl of Morton and Edward Lascelles, 1st Earl of Harewood) on 8 July 1815. They had five children:
* George John James Hamilton-Gordon, 5th Earl of Aberdeen (28 September 1816 – 22 March 1864). He married Lady Mary Baillie (younger sister of George Baillie-Hamilton, 10th Earl of Haddington) on 5 November 1840. They had six children.
* General Sir Alexander Hamilton-Gordon (11 December 1817 – 19 May 1890). He married Caroline Herschel (daughter of Sir John Herschel, 1st Baronet) on 9 December 1852. They had nine children.
* Lady Frances Hamilton-Gordon (4 December 1818 – 20 April 1834) died aged 15
* Reverend Hon. Douglas Hamilton-Gordon (13 March 1824 – 6 December 1901). He married Lady Ellen Douglas (maternal first cousin) on 15 July 1851.
* Arthur Charles Hamilton-Gordon (26 November 1829 – 30 January 1912). He married Rachel Emily Shaw-Lefevre on 20 September 1865. They had two children.

The Countess of Aberdeen died in August 1833. Lord Aberdeen died at Argyll House, St. James&#x27;s, London, on 14 December 1860, and was buried in the family vault at Stanmore church. In 1994 the novelist, columnist, and politician Ferdinand Mount used George Gordon&#x27;s life as the basis for a historical novel, &quot;Umbrella&quot;.

Apart from his political career, Aberdeen was also a scholar of the classical civilisations, who published &quot;An Inquiry into the Principles of Beauty in Grecian Architecture&quot; (London, 1822) and was referred to by his cousin Lord Byron in his &quot;English Bards and Scotch Reviewers&quot; (1809) as &quot;the travell&#x27;d thane, Athenian Aberdeen.&quot; He was appointed Chancellor of the University of Aberdeen in 1827 and was President of the Society of Antiquaries of London.

==Religious interests==
Aberdeen&#x27;s biographer Muriel Chamberlain summarises, &quot;Religion never came easy to him&quot;. In his Scots landowning capacity &quot;North of the border, he considered himself &quot;ex officio&quot; a Presbyterian&quot;. In England &quot;he privately considered himself an Anglican&quot;; as early as 1840 he told Gladstone he preferred what Aberdeen called &quot;the sister church [of England]&quot; and when in London worshipped at St James&#x27;s Piccadilly. He was ultimately buried in the Anglican parish church at Stanmore, Middlesex.

He was a member of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland from 1818 to 1828 and exercised his existing rights to present ministers to parishes on his Scottish estates through a time when the right of churches to veto the appointment or &#x27;call&#x27; of a minister became so contentious as to lead in 1843 to the schism known as &quot;the Disruption&quot; when a third of ministers broke away to form the Free Church of Scotland. In the House of Lords, in 1840 and 1843, he raised two Compromise Bills to allow presbyteries but not congregations the right of veto. The first failed to pass (and was voted against by the General Assembly) but the latter, raised post-schism, became law for Scotland and remained in force until patronage of Scots livings was abolished in 1874.

It was under his prime ministership that the revival of the Convocations of Canterbury and York began, though they did not obtain their potential power until 1859.

He is said in the last few months of his life, after the Crimean War, to have declined to contribute to building a church on his Scotland estates because of a sense of guilt in having &quot;shed much blood&quot;, citing biblically King David&#x27;s being forbidden to build the Temple in Jerusalem.

<text>GnuCash is an accounting program that implements a double-entry bookkeeping system. It was initially aimed at developing capabilities similar to Intuit, Inc.&#x27;s Quicken application, but also has features for small business accounting. Recent development has been focused on adapting to modern desktop support-library requirements.

GnuCash is part of the GNU Project, and runs on Linux, GNU, OpenBSD, FreeBSD, Solaris, macOS, and other Unix-like platforms. A Microsoft Windows (2000 or newer) port was made available starting with the 2.2.0 series.

GnuCash includes scripting support via Scheme, mostly used for creating custom reports.

==History==
Programming on GnuCash began in 1997, and its first stable release was in 1998. Small Business Accounting was added in 2001. A Mac installer became available in 2004. A Windows port was released in 2007.

==GnuCash for Android and GnuCash Mobile==
GnuCash for Android was initially developed as part of a Google Summer of Code Project. This was an expense-tracking companion app for GnuCash, as opposed to a stand-alone accounting package, and is now discontinued. Currently, there are more than 100,000 downloads on the Play Store. 

In 2022 a companion version dubbed GnuCash Mobile is also available on the App Store and Play Store and unlike previous iterations was released under the MIT License. GnuCash Mobile is developed using Flutter. Beyond mentoring the original GnuCash for Android developer and providing some publicity there was no connection between Gnucash for Android and the GnuCash project, nor is there any for the current so-called GnuCash Mobile app.

==Backwards compatibility issues==

GnuCash maintains the ability to read older data files between major releases, as long as major releases are not skipped. If a user wishes to access historical data saved in old GnuCash files, they must install intermediate versions of GnuCash. For example, upgrading from 2.2 to 4.1 may not be possible; the user should upgrade from 2.2.9 to 2.4.15, then to 2.6.21, then 3.11, then 4.1.

The other alternative is for users to export transactions files to a CSV format prior to upgrading GnuCash. Exporting of the account tree must be done as a separate step.

==Features==
* Double-entry bookkeeping
* Scheduled Transactions
* Mortgage and Loan Repayment Assistant
* Small Business Accounting Features
* OFX, QIF Import, CSV Import
* HBCI Support
* Transaction-Import Matching Support
* SQL Support
* VAT/GST tracking and reporting
* Multi-Currency Transaction Handling
* Stock/Mutual Fund Portfolios
* Online Stock and Mutual Fund Quotes
* Built-in and custom reports and charts
* Budget
* Bank and Credit Card reconciliation
* Check printing

===Small business accounting features===
* Invoicing and Credit Notes (Credit note functionality was added with version 2.6)
* Accounts Receivable (A/R)
* Accounts Payable (A/P) including bills due reminders
* Employee expense voucher
* Limited Payroll Management through the use of A/Receivable and A/Payable accounts.
* Depreciation
* Mapping to income tax schedules and TXF export for import into tax prep software (US)
* Setting up tax tables and applying sales tax on invoices

==Technical design==
GnuCash is written primarily in C, with a small fraction in Scheme. One of the available features is pure fixed-point arithmetic to avoid rounding errors which would arise with floating-point arithmetic. This feature was introduced with version 1.6.

==Users==
Users on the GnuCash mailing list have reported using it for the United States 501(c)(3) non-profit organizations successfully. However, the reports need to be exported and edited.

In April 2011, the Minnesota State Bar Association made their GnuCash trust accounting guide freely available in PDF format.

==Download statistics==
As of July 2018, SourceForge shows a count of over 6.3 million downloads of the stable releases starting from November 1999 Also, SourceForge shows that current downloads are running at ~7,000 per week. This does not include other software download sites as well as Linux distributions that provide download from their own repositories.

==Project status==
Open Hub&#x27;s analysis based on commits up to May 2018 (noninclusive) concluded that the project has a mature, well-established code base with increasing year-over-year development activity. Moreover, &quot;Over the past twelve months, 51 developers contributed new code to GnuCash. This is one of the largest open-source teams in the world, and is in the top 2% of all project teams on Open Hub.&quot;

<text>George Robert Aberigh-Mackay (25 July 184812 January 1881) was a British educationalist and writer resident in India during his short adult life.

==Biography==
George Robert Aberigh-Mackay was the son of the Reverend James Aberigh-Mackay D.D., B.D. and his first wife Lucretia Livingston née Reed. He was educated privately in Scotland, and then at Magdalen College School, Oxford and St Catharine&#x27;s College, Cambridge. Entering the Indian education department in the North-Western Provinces in 1870, he became professor of English literature in Delhi College in 1873, tutor to the Raja of Rutlam in 1876, and principal of the Rajkumar College at Indore in 1877. He was appointed fellow of Calcutta University in 1880.

He wrote a number of educational works, and extensive manuals giving first-hand data about the princely states and their rulers. He also wrote, mainly for &quot;The Pioneer&quot; newspaper, but also for other English and Indian papers, including letters in the Bombay Gazette under the nom de plume &quot;The Political Orphan&quot;.

He is best known for his book &quot;Twenty-one Days in India&quot; (1878–1879), a satire upon Anglo-Indian society and modes of thought. This book gave promise of a successful literary career, but the author died at the age of thirty-three.

On 8 January 1881 he developed symptoms of tetanus after playing polo and tennis on the previous 2 days, and died on 12 January 1881 in Indore.

==Family==
George Robert Aberigh-Mackay married Mary Ann Louisa Cherry on 13 October 1873 at Simla, Bengal, India; their children were:
# Mary Livingston (&quot;Miss Patty&quot;) Aberigh-Mackay (1874–1952)
# Frances Lilian Aberigh-Mackay (1875–?)
# Beatrice Georgiana Aberigh-Mackay (1878–1948)
# Katharine Madeline Aberigh-Mackay (1879–1945) married 1st Montague Tharp 2nd James Herbert Everett Evans.

<doc id="12882" wikidata="Q178413" url="?curid=12882" title="Gallon">
<text>The gallon is a unit of volume in British imperial units and United States customary units.

The imperial gallon (imp gal) is defined as , and is or was used in the United Kingdom and its former colonies, including Ireland, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, India, South Africa, Malaysia and some Caribbean countries, while the US gallon (US gal) is defined as , and is used in the United States and some Latin American and Caribbean countries.

There are four gills in a pint, two pints in a quart, and four quarts (&quot;quart&quot;er gallons) in a gallon, with the imperial gill being divided into five imperial fluid ounces and the US gill being divided into four US fluid ounces: this, and a slight difference in the sizes of the imperial fluid ounce and the US fluid ounce, give different sizes for the imperial gallon and US gallon.

The IEEE standard symbol for both the imperial and US gallons is gal, not to be confused with the gal (symbol: Gal), a CGS unit of acceleration.

==Definitions==
The gallon currently has two definitions, in the imperial system and in the US customary system. 

Historically, there were many definitions and redefinitions: see for details.

===Imperial gallon===

The British imperial gallon (frequently called simply &quot;gallon&quot;) is defined as exactly 4.54609 litres. It is used in Britain and some other Commonwealth countries, and until 1976 was defined as the volume of water at whose mass is . 

There are four imperial quarts in a gallon, two imperial pints in a quart, and 20 imperial fluid ounces in an imperial pint, making an imperial fluid ounce of an imperial gallon.

===US gallon===
The US gallon (frequently called simply &quot;gallon&quot;) is legally defined as exactly 231 cubic inches, i.e. .

A US gallon contains of water at , making it 83.26742% of an imperial gallon. There are four quarts in a gallon, two pints in a quart and 16 US fluid ounces in a US pint, making the US fluid ounce of a US gallon.

In order to overcome the effects of expansion and contraction with temperature when using a gallon to specify a quantity of material for purposes of trade, it is common to define the temperature at which the material will occupy the specified volume. For example, the volume of petroleum products and alcoholic beverages are both referenced to in government regulations.

==Worldwide usage==
===Imperial gallon===
As of 2021, the imperial gallon continues to be used as the standard petrol unit on 10 Caribbean island groups, consisting of:

* four British Overseas Territories (Anguilla, the British Virgin Islands, the Cayman Islands, and Montserrat) and 
* six countries (Antigua and Barbuda, Dominica, Grenada, Saint Christopher and Nevis, Saint Lucia, and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines).

All 12 of the Caribbean islands use miles per hour for speed limits signage, and drive on the left side of the road.

The United Arab Emirates ceased selling petrol by the imperial gallon in 2010 and switched to the litre, with Guyana following suit in 2013. In 2014, Myanmar switched from the imperial gallon to the litre.

Antigua and Barbuda has proposed switching to selling petrol by litres since 2015.

In the European Union the gallon was removed from the list of legally defined primary units of measure catalogue in the EU directive 80/181/EEC for trading and official purposes, effective from 31 December 1994. Under the directive the gallon could still be used, but only as a supplementary or secondary unit. 

As a result of the EU directive Ireland and the United Kingdom passed legislation to replace the gallon with the litre as a primary unit of measure in trade and in the conduct of public business, effective from 31 December 1993, and 30 September 1995 respectively. Though the gallon has ceased to be a primary unit of trade, it can still be legally used in both the UK and Ireland as a supplementary unit. However, barrels and large containers of beer, oil and other fluids are commonly measured in multiples of an imperial gallon. 

Miles per imperial gallon is used as the primary fuel economy unit in the United Kingdom and as a supplementary unit in Canada on official documentation.

===US gallon===
Other than the United States, petrol is sold by the US gallon in seven other countries and four US territories:
* the Caribbean country of Haiti,
* the Central American countries of Belize and Guatemala,
* the Pacific Ocean countries of Marshall Islands, Federated States of Micronesia, and Palau, which are associated countries of the United States,
* the African country of Liberia, a former protectorate of the United States, and
* the US territories of American Samoa, the Northern Mariana Islands, Guam, and the US Virgin Islands. Puerto Rico ceased selling petrol by the US gallon in 1980.

The latest country to cease using the US gallon is El Salvador in June 2021.

===Both imperial and US gallon===
Both the imperial gallon and the US gallon are used in the Turks and Caicos Islands, due to an increase in tax duties which was disguised by levying the same duty on the US gallon (3.79 L) as was previously levied on the Imperial gallon (4.55 L), and the Bahamas.

===Legacy===
In some parts of the Middle East, such as the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain, 18.9-litre water cooler bottles are marketed as five-gallon bottles.

==Relationship to other units==
Both the US gallon and imperial gallon are divided into four quarts (&quot;quart&quot;er gallons), which in turn are divided into two pints, which in turn are divided into two cups (not in customary use outside the US), which in turn are further divided into two gills. Thus, both gallons are equal to four quarts, eight pints, sixteen cups, or thirty-two gills.

There is a difference in that the imperial gill is further divided into five fluid ounces, whereas the US gill is divided into four fluid ounces: this means that an imperial fluid ounce is of an imperial pint or of an imperial gallon, while a US fluid ounce is of a US pint or of a US gallon. 

As an imperial fluid ounce is % of a US fluid ounce, this means that one imperial gallon, quart, pint, cup and gill are all equal to of their US counterparts.

Historically, a common bottle size for liquor in the US was the &quot;fifth&quot;, i.e. one-fifth of a US gallon (or 0.08% more than a &quot;reputed quart&quot;, one-sixth of an imperial gallon). While spirit sales in the US were switched to metric measures in 1976, a 750 mL bottle is still sometimes known as a &quot;fifth&quot;.

===US dry gallon===
The US dry gallon was defined as one-eighth of a US &quot;Winchester&quot; bushel of exactly cubic inches, i.e. 268.8025 cubic inches or . 

The US dry gallon is not used in commerce, and is no longer listed in the relevant statute, which goes from the dry quart to the bushel.

==History==

The term derives most immediately from &quot;galun&quot;, &quot;galon&quot; in Old Norman French, but the usage was common in several languages, for example in Old French and (bowl) in Old English. This suggests a common origin in Romance Latin, but the ultimate source of the word is unknown.

The gallon originated as the base of systems for measuring wine and beer in England. The sizes of gallon used in these two systems were different from each other: the first was based on the wine gallon (equal in size to the US gallon), and the second one either the ale gallon or the larger imperial gallon.

By the end of the 18th century, there were three definitions of the gallon in common use:
* The &quot;corn gallon&quot; (or &quot;Winchester gallon&quot;) of about (≈),
* The &quot;wine gallon&quot; (or &quot;Queen Anne&#x27;s gallon&quot;) of (), and
* The &quot;ale gallon&quot; of ().

The &quot;corn&quot; or &quot;dry gallon&quot; was used in the United States for grain and other dry commodities. It was one-eighth of the (Winchester) bushel, originally defined as a cylindrical measure of inches in diameter and 8 inches in depth, which made the bushel . The bushel was later redefined to be 2150.42 cubic inches exactly, thus making its gallon exactly (); in previous centuries, there had been a corn gallon of between 271 and 272 cubic inches.

The &quot;wine gallon&quot; was adopted as the standard US gallon in 1836. Some sources relate this to the volume occupied by eight medieval merchant pounds of wine: this was at one time defined as the volume of a cylinder 6 inches deep and 7 inches in diameter, i.e. . It was redefined in 1706 during the reign of Queen Anne as being exactly , the earlier definition with being approximated as .

formula_1

Although the wine gallon had been used for centuries for import duty purposes, there was no legal standard of it in the Exchequer, and a smaller gallon () was actually in use, which required this statute to resolve these issues: remains the definition of a gallon in the U.S. today.

In 1824, Britain adopted the &quot;imperial gallon&quot;, and abolished all other gallons in favour of it. The imperial gallon was defined as the volume of 10 pounds of distilled water weighed in air with brass weights with the barometer standing at and at a temperature of , which was calculated as (or to ten significant figures), 1.68% smaller than the former ale gallon.

This value lasted until 1889, when an Order in Council of 28 November 1889 redefined the imperial gallon as (or to ten significant figures). 

In 1963, the definition was again refined as the space occupied by 10 pounds of distilled water of density weighed in air of density against weights of density (the original &quot;brass&quot; was refined as the densities of brass alloys vary depending on metallurgical composition), which was calculated as (≈ ) to ten significant figures.

The definition of exactly cubic decimetres (also or ≈ ) came after the litre was redefined in 1964. This was adopted shortly afterwards in Canada, and adopted in 1976 in the United Kingdom.

===Sizes of gallons===
Historically, gallons of various sizes were used in many parts of Western Europe. In these localities, it has been replaced as the unit of capacity by the litre.

<text>In economics, the Gini coefficient ( ), also known as the Gini index or Gini ratio, is a measure of statistical dispersion intended to represent the income inequality, the wealth inequality, or the consumption inequality within a nation or a social group. It was developed by Italian statistician and sociologist Corrado Gini.

The Gini coefficient measures the inequality among the values of a frequency distribution, such as income levels. A Gini coefficient of 0 reflects perfect equality, where all income or wealth values are the same. In contrast, a Gini coefficient of 1 (or 100%) reflects maximal inequality among values, where a single individual has all the income while all others have none.

Corrado Gini proposed the Gini coefficient as a measure of inequality of income or wealth. For OECD countries in the late 20th century, considering the effect of taxes and transfer payments, the income Gini coefficient ranged between 0.24 and 0.49, with Slovakia being the lowest and Mexico the highest. African countries had the highest pre-tax Gini coefficients in 2008–2009, with South Africa having the world&#x27;s highest, estimated to be 0.63 to 0.7. However, this figure drops to 0.52 after social assistance is taken into account and drops again to 0.47 after taxation. Slovakia has the lowest Gini coefficient, with a Gini coefficient of 0.232. Various sources have estimated the Gini coefficient of the global income in 2005 to be between 0.61 and 0.68.

There are multiple issues in interpreting a Gini coefficient, as the same value may result from many different distribution curves. The demographic structure should be taken into account to mitigate this. Countries with an aging population or those with an increased birth rate experience an increasing pre-tax Gini coefficient even if real income distribution for working adults remains constant. Many scholars have devised over a dozen variants of the Gini coefficient.

==History==
The Italian statistician Corrado Gini developed the Gini coefficient and published it in his 1912 paper &quot;Variabilità e mutabilità&quot; (). Building on the work of American economist Max Lorenz, Gini proposed using the difference between the hypothetical straight line depicting perfect equality and the actual line depicting people&#x27;s incomes as a measure of inequality. In this paper, he introduced the concept of simple mean difference as a measure of variability.

He then applied the simple mean difference of observed variables to income and wealth inequality in his work &quot;On the measurement of concentration and variability of characters&quot; in 1914. Here, he presented the concentration ratio, which further developed into today&#x27;s Gini coefficient. Secondly, Gini observed that improving methods introduced by Lorenz, Chatelain, or Séailles could also achieve his proposed ratio.

In 1915, Gaetano Pietra introduced a geometrical interpretation between Gini&#x27;s proposed ratio and between the observed area of concentration and maximum concentration. This altered version of the Gini coefficient became the most commonly used inequality index in upcoming years.

According to data from the OECD, the Gini coefficient was first officially used country-wide in Canada in the 1970s. Canadian index of income inequality ranged from 0.303 to 0.284 from 1976 to the end of the 1980s. The OECD has published more data on countries since the start of the 21st century. The Central European countries of Slovenia, Czechia, and Slovakia have had the lowest inequality index of all OECD countries ever since the 2000s. Scandinavian countries also frequently appeared at the top of the equality list in recent decades.

== Definition ==
The Gini coefficient is an index for the degree of inequality in the distribution of income/wealth, used to estimate how far a country&#x27;s wealth or income distribution deviates from an equal distribution.

The Gini coefficient is usually defined mathematically based on the Lorenz curve, which plots the proportion of the total income of the population (y-axis) that is cumulatively earned by the bottom &quot;x&quot; of the population (see diagram). The line at 45 degrees thus represents perfect equality of incomes. The Gini coefficient can then be thought of as the ratio of the area that lies between the line of equality and the Lorenz curve (marked &quot;A&quot; in the diagram) over the total area under the line of equality (marked &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; in the diagram); i.e., . If there are no negative incomes, it is also equal to 2&quot;A&quot; and due to the fact that .

Assuming non-negative income or wealth for all, the Gini coefficient&#x27;s theoretical range is from 0 (total equality) to 1 (absolute inequality). This measure is often rendered as a percentage, spanning 0 to 100. However, if negative values are factored in, as in cases of debt, the Gini index could exceed 1. Typically, we presuppose a positive mean or total, precluding a Gini coefficient below zero.

An alternative approach is to define the Gini coefficient as half of the relative mean absolute difference, which is equivalent to the definition based on the Lorenz curve. The mean absolute difference is the average absolute difference of all pairs of items of the population, and the relative mean absolute difference is the mean absolute difference divided by the average, formula_1, to normalize for scale. If &quot;x&quot;&quot;i&quot; is the wealth or income of person &quot;i&quot;, and there are &quot;n&quot; persons, then the Gini coefficient &quot;G&quot; is given by:

:formula_2

When the income (or wealth) distribution is given as a continuous probability density function &quot;p&quot;(&quot;x&quot;), the Gini coefficient is again half of the relative mean absolute difference:

:formula_3

where formula_4 is the mean of the distribution, and the lower limits of integration may be replaced by zero when all incomes are positive.

== Calculation ==
While the income distribution of any particular country will not correspond perfectly to the theoretical models, these models can provide a qualitative explanation of the income distribution in a nation given the Gini coefficient.

=== Example: Two levels of income ===
The extreme cases are represented by the most equal possible society in which every person receives the same income (), and the most unequal society (with &quot;N&quot; individuals) where a single person receives 100% of the total income and the remaining people receive none ().

A simple case assumes just two levels of income, low and high. If the high income group is a proportion &quot;u&quot; of the population and earns a proportion &quot;f&quot; of all income, then the Gini coefficient is . A more graded distribution with these same values &quot;u&quot; and &quot;f&quot; will always have a higher Gini coefficient than .

For example, if the wealthiest &quot;u =&quot; 20% of the population has &quot;f =&quot; 80% of all income (see Pareto principle), the income Gini coefficient is at least 60%. In another example, if &quot;u =&quot; 1% of the world&#x27;s population owns &quot;f =&quot; 50% of all wealth, the wealth Gini coefficient is at least 49%.

=== Alternative expressions ===

In some cases, this equation can be applied to calculate the Gini coefficient without direct reference to the Lorenz curve. For example, (taking &quot;y&quot; to indicate the income or wealth of a person or household):
* For a population of &quot;n&quot; individuals with values formula_5, 
::formula_6
:This may be simplified to:
::formula_7

The Gini coefficient can also be considered as half the relative mean absolute difference. For a random sample &quot;S&quot; with values formula_5, the sample Gini coefficient
:formula_9

is a consistent estimator of the population Gini coefficient, but is not in general unbiased. In simplified form:

:formula_10

There does not exist a sample statistic that is always an unbiased estimator of the population Gini coefficient.

=== Discrete probability distribution ===

For a discrete probability distribution with probability mass function formula_11 formula_12, where formula_13 is the fraction of the population with income or wealth formula_14, the Gini coefficient is:
:formula_15
where
:formula_16
If the points with non-zero probabilities are indexed in increasing order formula_17, then:
:formula_18
where
:formula_19 and formula_20 These formulas are also applicable in the limit, as formula_21

=== Continuous probability distribution ===

When the population is large, the income distribution may be represented by a continuous probability density function &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) where &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) &quot;dx&quot; is the fraction of the population with wealth or income in the interval &quot;dx&quot; about &quot;x&quot;. If &quot;F&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) is the cumulative distribution function for &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;):

:formula_22

and &quot;L&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) is the Lorenz function:

:formula_23

then the Lorenz curve &quot;L&quot;(&quot;F&quot;) may then be represented as a function parametric in &quot;L&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) and &quot;F&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) and the value of &quot;B&quot; can be found by integration:

:formula_24

The Gini coefficient can also be calculated directly from the cumulative distribution function of the distribution &quot;F&quot;(&quot;y&quot;). Defining μ as the mean of the distribution, and specifying that &quot;F&quot;(&quot;y&quot;) is zero for all negative values, the Gini coefficient is given by:
:formula_25
The latter result comes from integration by parts. &quot;(Note that this formula can be applied when there are negative values if the integration is taken from minus infinity to plus infinity.)&quot;

The Gini coefficient may be expressed in terms of the quantile function &quot;Q&quot;(&quot;F&quot;) &quot;(inverse of the cumulative distribution function: Q(F(x)) = x)&quot;
: formula_26

Since the Gini coefficient is independent of scale, if the distribution function can be expressed in the form &quot;f(x,φ,a,b,c...)&quot; where &quot;φ&quot; is a scale factor and &quot;a, b, c...&quot; are dimensionless parameters, then the Gini coefficient will be a function only of &quot;a, b, c...&quot;. For example, for the exponential distribution, which is a function of only &quot;x&quot; and a scale parameter, the Gini coefficient is a constant, equal to 1/2.

For some functional forms, the Gini index can be calculated explicitly. For example, if &quot;y&quot; follows a log-normal distribution with the standard deviation of logs equal to formula_27, then formula_28 where formula_29 is the error function ( since formula_30, where formula_31 is the cumulative distribution function of a standard normal distribution). In the table below, some examples for probability density functions with support on formula_32 are shown. The Dirac delta distribution represents the case where everyone has the same wealth (or income); it implies no variations between incomes.


* formula_33 is the Gamma function
* formula_34 is the Beta function
* formula_35 is the Regularized incomplete beta function

=== Other approaches ===

Sometimes the entire Lorenz curve is not known, and only values at certain intervals are given. In that case, the Gini coefficient can be approximated using various techniques for interpolating the missing values of the Lorenz curve. If (&quot;X&quot;&quot;k&quot;, &quot;Y&quot;&quot;k&quot;) are the known points on the Lorenz curve, with the &quot;X&quot;&quot;k&quot; indexed in increasing order (&quot;X&quot;&quot;k&quot; – 1 &lt; &quot;X&quot;&quot;k&quot;), so that:
* &quot;X&quot;&quot;k&quot; is the cumulated proportion of the population variable, for &quot;k&quot; = 0...,&quot;n&quot;, with &quot;X&quot;0 = 0, &quot;X&quot;&quot;n&quot; = 1.
* &quot;Y&quot;&quot;k&quot; is the cumulated proportion of the income variable, for &quot;k&quot; = 0...,&quot;n&quot;, with &quot;Y&quot;0 = 0, &quot;Y&quot;&quot;n&quot; = 1.
* &quot;Y&quot;&quot;k&quot; should be indexed in non-decreasing order (&quot;Y&quot;&quot;k&quot; &gt; &quot;Y&quot;&quot;k&quot; – 1)
If the Lorenz curve is approximated on each interval as a line between consecutive points, then the area B can be approximated with trapezoids and:
:formula_36

is the resulting approximation for G. More accurate results can be obtained using other methods to approximate the area B, such as approximating the Lorenz curve with a quadratic function across pairs of intervals or building an appropriately smooth approximation to the underlying distribution function that matches the known data. If the population mean and boundary values for each interval are also known, these can also often be used to improve the accuracy of the approximation.

The Gini coefficient calculated from a sample is a statistic, and its standard error, or confidence intervals for the population Gini coefficient, should be reported. These can be calculated using bootstrap techniques, mathematically complicated and computationally demanding even in an era of fast computers. Economist Tomson Ogwang made the process more efficient by setting up a &quot;trick regression model&quot; in which respective income variables in the sample are ranked, with the lowest income being allocated rank 1. The model then expresses the rank (dependent variable) as the sum of a constant &quot;A&quot; and a normal error term whose variance is inversely proportional to &quot;y&quot;&quot;k&quot;:

:formula_37

Thus, &quot;G&quot; can be expressed as a function of the weighted least squares estimate of the constant &quot;A&quot; and that this can be used to speed up the calculation of the jackknife estimate for the standard error. Economist David Giles argued that the standard error of the estimate of &quot;A&quot; can be used to derive the estimate of &quot;G&quot; directly without using a jackknife. This method only requires using ordinary least squares regression after ordering the sample data. The results compare favorably with the estimates from the jackknife with agreement improving with increasing sample size.

However, it has been argued that this depends on the model&#x27;s assumptions about the error distributions and the independence of error terms. These assumptions are often not valid for real data sets. There is still ongoing debate surrounding this topic.

Guillermina Jasso and Angus Deaton independently proposed the following formula for the Gini coefficient:

:formula_38

where formula_39 is mean income of the population, Pi is the income rank P of person i, with income X, such that the richest person receives a rank of 1 and the poorest a rank of &quot;N&quot;. This effectively gives higher weight to poorer people in the income distribution, which allows the Gini to meet the Transfer Principle. Note that the Jasso-Deaton formula rescales the coefficient so that its value is one if all the formula_40 are zero except one. Note however Allison&#x27;s reply on the need to divide by N² instead.

FAO explains another version of the formula.

== Generalized inequality indices ==
The Gini coefficient and other standard inequality indices reduce to a common form. Perfect equality—the absence of inequality—exists when and only when the inequality ratio, formula_41, equals 1 for all j units in some population (for example, there is perfect income equality when everyone&#x27;s income formula_42 equals the mean income formula_43, so that formula_44 for everyone). Measures of inequality, then, are measures of the average deviations of the formula_44 from 1; the greater the average deviation, the greater the inequality. Based on these observations the inequality indices have this common form:

:formula_46

where &quot;p&quot;&quot;j&quot; weights the units by their population share, and &quot;f&quot;(&quot;r&quot;&quot;j&quot;) is a function of the deviation of each unit&#x27;s &quot;r&quot;&quot;j&quot; from 1, the point of equality. The insight of this generalized inequality index is that inequality indices differ because they employ different functions of the distance of the inequality ratios (the &quot;r&quot;&quot;j&quot;) from 1.

== Of income distributions ==

Gini coefficients of income are calculated on a market income and a disposable income basis. The Gini coefficient on market income—sometimes referred to as a pre-tax Gini coefficient—is calculated on income before taxes and transfers. It measures inequality in income without considering the effect of taxes and social spending already in place in a country. The Gini coefficient on disposable income—sometimes referred to as the after-tax Gini coefficient—is calculated on income after taxes and transfers. It measures inequality in income after considering the effect of taxes and social spending already in place in a country.

For OECD countries over the 2008–2009 period, the Gini coefficient (pre-taxes and transfers) for a total population ranged between 0.34 and 0.53, with South Korea the lowest and Italy the highest. The Gini coefficient (after-taxes and transfers) for a total population ranged between 0.25 and 0.48, with Denmark the lowest and Mexico the highest. For the United States, the country with the largest population among OECD countries, the pre-tax Gini index was 0.49, and the after-tax Gini index was 0.38 in 2008–2009. The OECD average for total populations in OECD countries was 0.46 for the pre-tax income Gini index and 0.31 for the after-tax income Gini index. Taxes and social spending that were in place in 2008–2009 period in OECD countries significantly lowered effective income inequality, and in general, &quot;European countries—especially Nordic and Continental welfare states—achieve lower levels of income inequality than other countries.&quot;

Using the Gini can help quantify differences in welfare and compensation policies and philosophies. However, it should be borne in mind that the Gini coefficient can be misleading when used to make political comparisons between large and small countries or those with different immigration policies (see limitations section).

The Gini coefficient for the entire world has been estimated by various parties to be between 0.61 and 0.68. The graph shows the values expressed as a percentage in their historical development for a number of countries.
=== Regional income Gini indices ===
According to UNICEF, Latin America and the Caribbean region had the highest net income Gini index in the world at 48.3, on an unweighted average basis in 2008. The remaining regional averages were: sub-Saharan Africa (44.2), Asia (40.4), Middle East and North Africa (39.2), Eastern Europe and Central Asia (35.4), and High-income Countries (30.9). Using the same method, the United States is claimed to have a Gini index of 36, while South Africa had the highest income Gini index score of 67.8.

=== World income Gini index since 1800s ===
Taking income distribution of all human beings, worldwide income inequality has been constantly increasing since the early 19th century (and will keep on increasing over the years) . There was a steady increase in the global income inequality Gini score from 1820 to 2002, with a significant increase between 1980 and 2002. This trend appears to have peaked and begun a reversal with rapid economic growth in emerging economies, particularly in the large populations of BRIC countries.

The table below presents the estimated world income Gini coefficients over the last 200 years, as calculated by Milanovic. 
More detailed data from similar sources plots a continuous decline since 1988. This is attributed to globalization increasing incomes for billions of poor people, mostly in countries like China and India. Developing countries like Brazil have also improved basic services like health care, education, and sanitation; others like Chile and Mexico have enacted more progressive tax policies.

== Of social development ==
The Gini coefficient is widely used in fields as diverse as sociology, economics, health science, ecology, engineering, and agriculture. For example, in social sciences and economics, in addition to income Gini coefficients, scholars have published education Gini coefficients and opportunity Gini coefficients.

=== Education ===
Education Gini index estimates the inequality in education for a given population. It is used to discern trends in social development through educational attainment over time. A study across 85 countries by three World Bank economists, Vinod Thomas, Yan Wang, and Xibo Fan, estimated Mali had the highest education Gini index of 0.92 in 1990 (implying very high inequality in educational attainment across the population), while the United States had the lowest education inequality Gini index of 0.14. Between 1960 and 1990, China, India and South Korea had the fastest drop in education inequality Gini Index. They also claim education Gini index for the United States slightly increased over the 1980–1990 period.

Though India&#x27;s education Gini Index has been falling from 1960 through 1990, most of the population still has not received any education, while 10 percent of the population received more than 40% of the total educational hours in the nation. This means that a large portion of capable children in the country are not receiving the support necessary to allow them to become positive contributors to society. This will lead to a deadweight loss to the national society because there are many people who are underdeveloped and underutilized.

=== Opportunity ===
Similar in concept to the Gini income coefficient, the Gini opportunity coefficient measures inequality in opportunities. The concept builds on Amartya Sen&#x27;s suggestion that inequality coefficients of social development should be premised on the process of enlarging people&#x27;s choices and enhancing their capabilities, rather than on the process of reducing income inequality. Kovacevic, in a review of the Gini opportunity coefficient, explained that the coefficient estimates how well a society enables its citizens to achieve success in life where the success is based on a person&#x27;s choices, efforts and talents, not their background defined by a set of predetermined circumstances at birth, such as gender, race, place of birth, parent&#x27;s income and circumstances beyond the control of that individual.

In 2003, Roemer reported Italy and Spain exhibited the largest opportunity inequality Gini index amongst advanced economies.

=== Income mobility ===
In 1978, Anthony Shorrocks introduced a measure based on income Gini coefficients to estimate income mobility. This measure, generalized by Maasoumi and Zandvakili, is now generally referred to as Shorrocks index, sometimes as Shorrocks mobility index or Shorrocks rigidity index. It attempts to estimate whether the income inequality Gini coefficient is permanent or temporary and to what extent a country or region enables economic mobility to its people so that they can move from one (e.g., bottom 20%) income quantile to another (e.g., middle 20%) over time. In other words, the Shorrocks index compares inequality of short-term earnings, such as the annual income of households, to inequality of long-term earnings, such as 5-year or 10-year total income for the same households.

Shorrocks index is calculated in several different ways, a common approach being from the ratio of income Gini coefficients between short-term and long-term for the same region or country.

A 2010 study using social security income data for the United States since 1937 and Gini-based Shorrock&#x27;s indices concludes that income mobility in the United States has had a complicated history, primarily due to the mass influx of women into the American labor force after World War II. Income inequality and income mobility trends have been different for men and women workers between 1937 and the 2000s. When men and women are considered together, the Gini coefficient-based Shorrocks index trends imply long-term income inequality has been substantially reduced among all workers, in recent decades for the United States. Other scholars, using just 1990s data or other short periods have come to different conclusions. For example, Sastre and Ayala conclude from their study of income Gini coefficient data between 1993 and 1998 for six developed economies that France had the least income mobility, Italy the highest, and the United States and Germany intermediate levels of income mobility over those five years.

== Features ==

The Gini coefficient has features that make it useful as a measure of dispersion in a population, and inequalities in particular. The coefficient ranges from 0, for perfect equality, to 1, indicating perfect inequality. The Gini is based on the comparison of cumulative proportions of the population against cumulative proportions of income they receive.

== Limitations ==

===Relative, not absolute===
The Gini coefficient is a relative measure. The Gini coefficient of a developing country can rise (due to increasing inequality of income) even when the number of people in absolute poverty decreases. This is because the Gini coefficient measures relative, not absolute, wealth.

Gini coefficients are simple, and this simplicity can lead to oversights and can confuse the comparison of different populations; for example, while both Bangladesh (per capita income of $1,693) and the Netherlands (per capita income of $42,183) had an income Gini coefficient of 0.31 in 2010, the quality of life, economic opportunity and absolute income in these countries are very different, i.e. countries may have identical Gini coefficients, but differ greatly in wealth. Basic necessities may be available to all in a developed economy, while in an undeveloped economy with the same Gini coefficient, basic necessities may be unavailable to most or unequally available due to lower absolute wealth.

===Mathematical limitations===
Gini has some mathematical limitations as well. It is not additive and different sets of people cannot be averaged to obtain the Gini coefficient of all the people in the sets.

Even when the total income of a population is the same, in certain situations two countries with different income distributions can have the same Gini index (e.g. cases when income Lorenz Curves cross). Table A illustrates one such situation. Both countries have a Gini coefficient of 0.2, but the average income distributions for household groups are different. As another example, in a population where the lowest 50% of individuals have no income, and the other 50% have equal income, the Gini coefficient is 0.5; whereas for another population where the lowest 75% of people have 25% of income and the top 25% have 75% of the income, the Gini index is also 0.5. Economies with similar incomes and Gini coefficients can have very different income distributions. Bellù and Liberati claim that ranking income inequality between two populations is not always possible based on their Gini indices. Similarly, computational social scientist Fabian Stephany illustrates that income inequality within the population, e.g., in specific socioeconomic groups of same age and education, also remains undetected by conventional Gini indices.

===Income Gini can conceal wealth inequality===
A Gini index does not contain information about absolute national or personal incomes. Populations can simultaneously have very low income Gini indices and very high wealth Gini indexes. By measuring inequality in income, the Gini ignores the differential efficiency of the use of household income. By ignoring wealth (except as it contributes to income), the Gini can create the appearance of inequality when the people compared are at different stages in their life. Wealthy countries such as Sweden can show a low Gini coefficient for the disposable income of 0.31, thereby appearing equal, yet have a very high Gini coefficient for wealth of 0.79 to 0.86, suggesting an extremely unequal wealth distribution in its society. These factors are not assessed in income-based Gini.

===Country size and granularity bias===
Gini index has a downward-bias for small populations. Counties or states or countries with small populations and less diverse economies will tend to report small Gini coefficients. For economically diverse large population groups, a much higher coefficient is expected than for each of its regions. For example, taking the world economy as a whole and income distribution for all human beings, different scholars estimate the global Gini index to range between 0.61 and 0.68.
As with other inequality coefficients, the Gini coefficient is influenced by the granularity of the measurements. For example, five 20% quantiles (low granularity) will usually yield a lower Gini coefficient than twenty 5% quantiles (high granularity) for the same distribution. Philippe Monfort has shown that using inconsistent or unspecified granularity limits the usefulness of Gini coefficient measurements.

===Changes in population===
Changing income inequality, measured by Gini coefficients, can be due to structural changes in a society such as growing population (increased birth rates, aging populations, emigration, immigration) and income mobility.

Another limitation of the Gini coefficient is that it is not a proper measure of egalitarianism, as it only measures income dispersion. For example, suppose two equally egalitarian countries pursue different immigration policies. In that case, the country accepting a higher proportion of low-income or impoverished migrants will report a higher Gini coefficient and, therefore, may exhibit more income inequality.

===Household vs individual===

The Gini coefficient measure gives different results when applied to individuals instead of households, for the same economy and same income distributions. If household data is used, the measured value of income Gini depends on how the household is defined. The comparison is not meaningful when different populations are not measured with consistent definitions. Furthermore, changes to the household income Gini can be driven by changes in household formation, such as increased divorce rates or extended family households splitting into nuclear families.

Deininger and Squire (1996) show that the income Gini coefficient based on individual income rather than household income is different. For example, for the United States, they found that the individual income-based Gini index was 0.35, while for France, 0.43. According to their individual-focused method, in the 108 countries they studied, South Africa had the world&#x27;s highest Gini coefficient at 0.62, Malaysia had Asia&#x27;s highest Gini coefficient at 0.5, Brazil the highest at 0.57 in Latin America and the Caribbean region, and Turkey the highest at 0.5 in OECD countries.

Billionaire Thomas Kwok claimed the income Gini coefficient for Hong Kong has been high (0.434 in 2010), in part because of structural changes in its population. Over recent decades, Hong Kong has witnessed increasing numbers of small households, elderly households, and elderly living alone. The combined income is now split into more households. Many older people live separately from their children in Hong Kong. These social changes have caused substantial changes in household income distribution. The income Gini coefficient, claims Kwok, does not discern these structural changes in its society. Household money income distribution for the United States, summarized in Table C of this section, confirms that this issue is not limited to just Hong Kong. According to the US Census Bureau, between 1979 and 2010, the population of the United States experienced structural changes in overall households; the income for all income brackets increased in inflation-adjusted terms, household income distributions shifted into higher income brackets over time, while the income Gini coefficient increased.

===Instantaneous inequality vs lifetime inequality===
The Gini coefficient is unable to discern the effects of structural changes in populations. Expanding on the importance of life-span measures, the Gini coefficient as a point-estimate of equality at a certain time ignores life-span changes in income. Typically, increases in the proportion of young or old members of a society will drive apparent changes in equality simply because people generally have lower incomes and wealth when they are young than when they are old. Because of this, factors such as age distribution within a population and mobility within income classes can create the appearance of inequality when none exist, taking into account demographic effects. Thus a given economy may have a higher Gini coefficient at any timepoint compared to another, while the Gini coefficient calculated over individuals&#x27; lifetime income is lower than the apparently more equal (at a given point in time) economy&#x27;s. Essentially, what matters is not just inequality in any particular year but the distribution composition over time.

===Benefits and income in kind===
Inaccuracies in assign monetary value to income in kind reduce the accuracy of Gini as a measurement of true inequality.

While taxes and cash transfers are relatively straightforward to account for, other government benefits can be difficult to value. Benefits such as subsidized housing, medical care, and education are difficult to value objectively, as it depends on the quality and extent of the benefit. In absence of a free market, valuing these income transfers as household income is subjective. The theoretical model of the Gini coefficient is limited to accepting correct or incorrect subjective assumptions.

In subsistence-driven and informal economies, people may have significant income in other forms than money, for example, through subsistence farming or bartering. These forms of income tend to accrue to poor segments of populations in emerging and transitional economy countries such as those in sub-Saharan Africa, Latin America, Asia, and Eastern Europe. Informal economy accounts for over half of global employment and as much as 90 percent of employment in some of the poorer sub-Saharan countries with high official Gini inequality coefficients. Schneider et al., in their 2010 study of 162 countries, report about 31.2%, or about $20 trillion, of world&#x27;s GDP is informal. In developing countries, the informal economy predominates for all income brackets except the richer, urban upper-income bracket populations. Even in developed economies, 8% (United States) to 27% (Italy) of each nation&#x27;s GDP is informal. The resulting informal income predominates as a livelihood activity for those in the lowest income brackets. The value and distribution of the incomes from informal or underground economy is difficult to quantify, making true income Gini coefficients estimates difficult. Different assumptions and quantifications of these incomes will yield different Gini coefficients.

== Alternatives ==
Given the limitations of the Gini coefficient, other statistical methods are used in combination or as an alternative measure of population dispersity. For example, &quot;entropy measures&quot; are frequently used (e.g. the Atkinson index or the Theil Index and Mean log deviation as special cases of the generalized entropy index). These measures attempt to compare the distribution of resources by intelligent agents in the market with a maximum entropy random distribution, which would occur if these agents acted like non-interacting particles in a closed system following the laws of statistical physics.

The Ortego two-parameter model may be superior to the GINI index.

== Relation to other statistical measures ==
There is a summary measure of the diagnostic ability of a binary classifier system that is also called the &quot;Gini coefficient&quot;, which is defined as twice the area between the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and its diagonal. It is related to the AUC (Area Under the ROC Curve) measure of performance given by formula_47 and to Mann–Whitney U. Although both Gini coefficients are defined as areas between certain curves and share certain properties, there is no simple direct relationship between the Gini coefficient of statistical dispersion and the Gini coefficient of a classifier.
The Gini index is also related to the Pietra index — both of which measure statistical heterogeneity and are derived from the Lorenz curve and the diagonal line.

In certain fields such as ecology, inverse Simpson&#x27;s index formula_48 is used to quantify diversity, and this should not be confused with the Simpson index formula_49. These indicators are related to Gini. The inverse Simpson index increases with diversity, unlike the Simpson index and Gini coefficient, which decrease with diversity. The Simpson index is in the range [0, 1], where 0 means maximum and 1 means minimum diversity (or heterogeneity). Since diversity indices typically increase with increasing heterogeneity, the Simpson index is often transformed into inverse Simpson, or using the complement formula_50, known as the Gini-Simpson Index.

The Lorenz curve is another method of graphical representation of wealth distribution. It was developed 9 years before the Gini coefficient, which quantifies the extent to which the Lorenz curve deviates from the perfect equality line (with slope of 1). The Hoover index (also known as Robin Hood index) presents the percentage of total population&#x27;s income that would have to be redistributed to make the Gini coefficient equal to 0 (perfect equality).

== Gini coefficients for pre-modern societies ==
In recent decades, researchers have attempted to estimate Gini coefficients for pre-20th century societies. In the absence of household income surveys and income taxes, scholars have relied on proxy variables. These include wealth taxes in medieval European city states, patterns of landownership in Roman Egypt, variation of the size of houses in societies from ancient Greece to Aztec Mexico, and inheritance and dowries in Babylonian society. Other data does not directly document variations in wealth or income but are known to reflect inequality, such as the ratio of rents to wages or of labor to capital.

== Other uses ==
Although the Gini coefficient is most popular in economics, it can, in theory, be applied in any field of science that studies a distribution. For example, in ecology, the Gini coefficient has been used as a measure of biodiversity, where the cumulative proportion of species is plotted against the cumulative proportion of individuals. In health, it has been used as a measure of the inequality of health-related quality of life in a population. In education, it has been used as a measure of the inequality of universities. In chemistry it has been used to express the selectivity of protein kinase inhibitors against a panel of kinases. In engineering, it has been used to evaluate the fairness achieved by Internet routers in scheduling packet transmissions from different flows of traffic. In machine learning, it has been used as a unified metric for evaluating many-versus-many (all-to-all) similarity in vector spaces across various data types, including images and text, and to show their effectiveness in guiding machine learning training sample selection, especially in sparse information settings.

The Gini coefficient is sometimes used for the measurement of the discriminatory power of rating systems in credit risk management.

A 2005 study accessed US census data to measure home computer ownership and used the Gini coefficient to measure inequalities amongst whites and African Americans. Results indicated that although decreasing overall, home computer ownership inequality was substantially smaller among white households.

A 2016 peer-reviewed study titled Employing the Gini coefficient to measure participation inequality in treatment-focused Digital Health Social Networks illustrated that the Gini coefficient was helpful and accurate in measuring shifts in inequality, however as a standalone metric it failed to incorporate overall network size.

Discriminatory power refers to a credit risk model&#x27;s ability to differentiate between defaulting and non-defaulting clients. The formula formula_51, in the calculation section above, may be used for the final model and at the individual model factor level to quantify the discriminatory power of individual factors. It is related to the accuracy ratio in population assessment models.

The Gini coefficient has also been applied to analyze inequality in dating apps.

Kaminskiy and Krivtsov extended the concept of the Gini coefficient from economics to reliability theory and proposed a Gini-type coefficient that helps to assess the degree of aging of non-repairable systems or aging and rejuvenation of repairable systems. The coefficient is defined between −1 and 1 and can be used in both empirical and parametric life distributions. It takes negative values for the class of decreasing failure rate distributions and point processes with decreasing failure intensity rate and is positive for the increasing failure rate distributions and point processes with increasing failure intensity rate. The value of zero corresponds to the exponential life distribution or the Homogeneous Poisson Process.

<text>Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) is an intelligence and security organisation responsible for providing signals intelligence (SIGINT) and information assurance (IA) to the government and armed forces of the United Kingdom. Primarily based at &quot;The Doughnut&quot; in the suburbs of Cheltenham, GCHQ is the responsibility of the country&#x27;s Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs (Foreign Secretary), but it is not a part of the Foreign Office and its director ranks as a Permanent Secretary.

GCHQ was originally established after the First World War as the Government Code and Cypher School (GC&amp;CS) and was known under that name until 1946. During the Second World War it was located at Bletchley Park, where it was responsible for breaking the German Enigma codes. There are two main components of GCHQ, the Composite Signals Organisation (CSO), which is responsible for gathering information, and the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), which is responsible for securing the UK&#x27;s own communications. The Joint Technical Language Service (JTLS) is a small department and cross-government resource responsible for mainly technical language support and translation and interpreting services across government departments. It is co-located with GCHQ for administrative purposes.

In 2013, GCHQ received considerable media attention when the former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden revealed that the agency was in the process of collecting all online and telephone data in the UK via the Tempora programme. Snowden&#x27;s revelations began a spate of ongoing disclosures of global surveillance. &quot;The Guardian&quot; newspaper was forced to destroy computer hard drives with the files Snowden had given them because of the threats of a lawsuit under the Official Secrets Act. In June 2014, &quot;The Register&quot; reported that the information the government sought to suppress by destroying the hard drives related to the location of a &quot;beyond top secret&quot; GCHQ internet monitoring base in Seeb, Oman, and the close involvement of BT and Cable &amp; Wireless in intercepting internet communications.

==Structure==
GCHQ is led by the Director of GCHQ, Anne Keast-Butler, and a Corporate Board, made up of executive and non-executive directors. Reporting to the Corporate Board are:
*Sigint missions: comprising maths and cryptanalysis, IT and computer systems, linguistics and translation, and the intelligence analysis unit
*Enterprise: comprising applied research and emerging technologies, corporate knowledge and information systems, commercial supplier relationships, and biometrics
*Corporate management: enterprise resource planning, human resources, internal audit, and architecture
*National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC).

==History==

===World War I===

During the First World War, the British Army and Royal Navy had separate signals intelligence agencies, MI1b and NID25 (initially known as Room 40) respectively. In 1919, the Cabinet&#x27;s Secret Service Committee, chaired by Lord Curzon, recommended that a peacetime codebreaking agency should be created, a task which was given to the Director of Naval Intelligence, Hugh Sinclair. Sinclair merged staff from NID25 and MI1b into the new organisation, which initially consisted of around 25–30 officers and a similar number of clerical staff. It was titled the &quot;Government Code and Cypher School&quot; (GC&amp;CS), a cover-name which was chosen by Victor Forbes of the Foreign Office. Alastair Denniston, who had been a member of NID25, was appointed as its operational head. It was initially under the control of the Admiralty and located in Watergate House, Adelphi, London. Its public function was &quot;to advise as to the security of codes and cyphers used by all Government departments and to assist in their provision&quot;, but also had a secret directive to &quot;study the methods of cypher communications used by foreign powers&quot;. GC&amp;CS officially formed on 1 November 1919, and produced its first decrypt prior to that date, on 19 October.

Before the Second World War, GC&amp;CS was a relatively small department. By 1922, the main focus of GC&amp;CS was on diplomatic traffic, with &quot;no service traffic ever worth circulating&quot; and so, at the initiative of Lord Curzon, it was transferred from the Admiralty to the Foreign Office. GC&amp;CS came under the supervision of Hugh Sinclair, who by 1923 was both the Chief of SIS and Director of GC&amp;CS. In 1925, both organisations were co-located on different floors of Broadway Buildings, opposite St. James&#x27;s Park. Messages decrypted by GC&amp;CS were distributed in blue-jacketed files that became known as &quot;BJs&quot;. In the 1920s, GC&amp;CS was successfully reading Soviet Union diplomatic cyphers. However, in May 1927, during a row over clandestine Soviet support for the General Strike and the distribution of subversive propaganda, Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin made details from the decrypts public.

===World War II===
During the Second World War, GC&amp;CS was based largely at Bletchley Park, in present-day Milton Keynes, working on understanding the German Enigma machine and Lorenz ciphers. In 1940, GC&amp;CS was working on the diplomatic codes and ciphers of 26 countries, tackling over 150 diplomatic cryptosystems. Senior staff included Alastair Denniston, Oliver Strachey, Dilly Knox, John Tiltman, Edward Travis, Ernst Fetterlein, Josh Cooper, Donald Michie, Alan Turing, Gordon Welchman, Joan Clarke, Max Newman, William Tutte, I. J. (Jack) Good, Peter Calvocoressi and Hugh Foss. The 1943 British–US Communication Intelligence Agreement, BRUSA, connected the signal intercept networks of the GC&amp;CS and the US National Security Agency (NSA). Equipment used to break enemy codes included the Colossus computer. Colossus consisted of ten networked computers.

An outstation in the Far East, the Far East Combined Bureau, was set up in Hong Kong in 1935 and moved to Singapore in 1939. Subsequently, with the Japanese advance down the Malay Peninsula, the Army and RAF codebreakers went to the Wireless Experimental Centre in Delhi, India. The Navy codebreakers in FECB went to Colombo, Ceylon, then to Kilindini, near Mombasa, Kenya.

===Post Second World War===
GC&amp;CS was renamed the Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) in June 1946.

The organisation was at first based in Eastcote in northwest London, then in 1951 moved to the outskirts of Cheltenham, setting up two sites at Oakley and Benhall. One of the major reasons for selecting Cheltenham was that the town had been the location of the headquarters of the United States Army Services of Supply for the European Theater during the War, which built up a telecommunications infrastructure in the region to carry out its logistics tasks.

Following the Second World War, US and British intelligence have shared information as part of the UKUSA Agreement. The principal aspect of this is that GCHQ and its US equivalent, the National Security Agency (NSA), share technologies, infrastructure and information.

GCHQ ran many signals intelligence (SIGINT) monitoring stations abroad. During the early Cold War, the remnants of the British Empire provided a global network of ground stations which were a major contribution to the UKUSA Agreement; the US regarded RAF Little Sai Wan in Hong Kong as the most valuable of these. The monitoring stations were largely run by inexpensive National Service recruits, but when this ended in the early 1960s, the increased cost of civilian employees caused budgetary problems. In 1965 a Foreign Office review found that 11,500 staff were involved in SIGINT collection (8,000 GCHQ staff and 3,500 military personnel), exceeding the size of the Diplomatic Service. Reaction to the Suez War led to the eviction of GCHQ from several of its best foreign SIGINT collection sites, including the new Perkar, Ceylon site and RAF Habbaniya, Iraq. The staff largely moved to tented encampments on military bases in Cyprus, which later became the Sovereign Base Area.

During the Cuban Missile Crisis, GCHQ Scarborough intercepted radio communications from Soviet ships reporting their positions and used that to establish where they were heading. A copy of the report was sent directly to the White House Situation Room, providing initial indications of Soviet intentions with regards the US naval blockade of Cuba.

Duncan Campbell and Mark Hosenball revealed the existence of GCHQ in 1976 in an article for &quot;Time Out&quot;; as a result, Hosenball was deported from the UK. GCHQ had a very low profile in the media until 1983 when the trial of Geoffrey Prime, a KGB mole within it, created considerable media interest.

====Trade union disputes====
In 1984, GCHQ was the centre of a political row when, in the wake of strikes which affected Sigint collection, the Conservative government of Margaret Thatcher prohibited its employees from belonging to a trade union, asserting that membership of a union was in conflict with national security. The government offered £1,000 to each employee who agreed to give up their right to union membership. Following the breakdown of talks and the failure to negotiate a no-strike agreement, a number of mass national one-day strikes were held to protest against this decision, believed by some to be the first step to wider bans on trade unions. Appeals to British courts and the European Commission of Human Rights were unsuccessful. An appeal to the International Labour Organization resulted in a decision that the government&#x27;s actions were in violation of Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention.

A no-strike agreement was eventually negotiated and the ban lifted by the incoming Labour government in 1997, with the Government Communications Group of the Public and Commercial Services Union (PCS) being formed to represent interested employees at all grades. In 2000, a group of 14 former GCHQ employees, who had been dismissed after refusing to give up their union membership, were offered re-employment, which three of them accepted.

The legal case &quot;Council of Civil Service Unions v Minister for the Civil Service&quot; is significant beyond the dispute, and even beyond trade union law, in that it held for the first time that the royal prerogative is generally subject to judicial review, although the House of Lords ruled in favour of the Crown in this instance.

===Post Cold War===

====1990s: Post-Cold War restructuring====
The Intelligence Services Act 1994 formalised the activities of the intelligence agencies for the first time, defining their purpose, and the British Parliament&#x27;s Intelligence and Security Committee was given a remit to examine the expenditure, administration and policy of the three intelligence agencies. The objectives of GCHQ were defined as working as &quot;in the interests of national security, with particular reference to the defence and foreign policies of His Majesty&#x27;s government; in the interests of the economic wellbeing of the United Kingdom; and in support of the prevention and the detection of serious crime&quot;. During the introduction of the Intelligence Agency Act in late 1993, the former Prime Minister Jim Callaghan had described GCHQ as a &quot;full-blown bureaucracy&quot;, adding that future bodies created to provide oversight of the intelligence agencies should &quot;investigate whether all the functions that GCHQ carries out today are still necessary.&quot;

In late 1993 civil servant Michael Quinlan advised a deep review of the work of GCHQ following the conclusion of his &quot;Review of Intelligence Requirements and Resources&quot;, which had imposed a 3% cut on the agency. The Chief Secretary to the Treasury, Jonathan Aitken, subsequently held face to face discussions with the intelligence agency directors to assess further savings in the wake of Quinlan&#x27;s review. Aldrich (2010) suggests that Sir John Adye, the then Director of GCHQ performed badly in meetings with Aitken, leading Aitken to conclude that GCHQ was &quot;suffering from out-of-date methods of management and out-of-date methods for assessing priorities&quot;. GCHQ&#x27;s budget was £850 million in 1993, (£ as of ) compared to £125 million for the Security Service and SIS (MI5 and MI6). In December 1994 the businessman Roger Hurn was commissioned to begin a review of GCHQ, which was concluded in March 1995. Hurn&#x27;s report recommended a cut of £100  million in GCHQ&#x27;s budget; such a large reduction had not been suffered by any British intelligence agency since the end of World War II. The J Division of GCHQ, which had collected SIGINT on Russia, disappeared as a result of the cuts. The cuts had been mostly reversed by 2000 in the wake of threats from violent non-state actors, and risks from increased terrorism, organised crime and illegal access to nuclear, chemical and biological weapons.

David Omand became the Director of GCHQ in 1996, and greatly restructured the agency in the face of new and changing targets and rapid technological change. Omand introduced the concept of &quot;Sinews&quot; (or &quot;SIGINT New Systems&quot;) which allowed more flexible working methods, avoiding overlaps in work by creating fourteen domains, each with a well-defined working scope. The tenure of Omand also saw the construction of a modern new headquarters, intended to consolidate the two old sites at Oakley and Benhall into a single, more open-plan work environment. Located on a 176-acre site in Benhall, it would be the largest building constructed for secret intelligence operations outside the United States.

Operations at GCHQ&#x27;s Chung Hom Kok listening station in Hong Kong ended in 1994. GCHQ&#x27;s Hong Kong operations were extremely important to their relationship with the NSA, who contributed investment and equipment to the station. In anticipation of the transfer of Hong Kong to the Chinese government in 1997, the Hong Kong stations operations were moved to Australian Defence Satellite Communications Station in Geraldton in Western Australia.

Operations that used GCHQ&#x27;s intelligence-gathering capabilities in the 1990s included the monitoring of communications of Iraqi soldiers in the Gulf War, of dissident republican terrorists and the Real IRA, of the various factions involved in the Yugoslav Wars, and of the criminal Kenneth Noye. In the mid-1990s GCHQ began to assist in the investigation of cybercrime.

====2000s: Coping with the Internet====

At the end of 2003, GCHQ moved in to its new building. Built on a circular plan around a large central courtyard, it quickly became known as the Doughnut. At the time, it was one of the largest public-sector building projects in Europe, with an estimated cost of £337 million. The new building, which was designed by Gensler and constructed by Carillion, became the base for all of GCHQ&#x27;s Cheltenham operations.

The public spotlight fell on GCHQ in late 2003 and early 2004 following the sacking of Katharine Gun after she leaked to &quot;The Observer&quot; a confidential email from agents at the United States&#x27; National Security Agency addressed to GCHQ officers about the wiretapping of UN delegates in the run-up to the 2003 Iraq war.

GCHQ gains its intelligence by monitoring a wide variety of communications and other electronic signals. For this, a number of stations have been established in the UK and overseas. The listening stations are at Cheltenham itself, Bude, Scarborough, Ascension Island, and with the United States at RAF Menwith Hill. Ayios Nikolaos Station in Cyprus is run by the British Army for GCHQ.

In March 2010, GCHQ was criticised by the Intelligence and Security Committee for problems with its IT security practices and failing to meet its targets for work targeted against cyber attacks.

As revealed by Edward Snowden in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, GCHQ spied on foreign politicians visiting the 2009 G-20 London Summit by eavesdropping phonecalls and emails and monitoring their computers, and in some cases even ongoing after the summit via keystroke logging that had been undertaken during the summit.

According to Edward Snowden, at that time GCHQ had two principal umbrella programs for collecting communications:
* &quot;Mastering the Internet&quot; (MTI) for Internet traffic, which is extracted from fibre-optic cables and can be searched by using the Tempora computer system.
* &quot;Global Telecoms Exploitation&quot; (GTE) for telephone traffic.

GCHQ has also had access to the US internet monitoring programme PRISM from at least as far back as June 2010. PRISM is said to give the National Security Agency and FBI easy access to the systems of nine of the world&#x27;s top internet companies, including Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Apple, Yahoo, and Skype.

From 2013, GCHQ realised that public attitudes to Sigint had changed and its former unquestioned secrecy was no longer appropriate or acceptable. The growing use of the Internet, together with its inherent insecurities, meant that the communications traffic of private citizens were becoming inextricably mixed with those of their targets and openness in the handling of this issue was becoming essential to their credibility as an organisation. The Internet had become a &quot;cyber commons&quot;, with its dominance creating a &quot;second age of Sigint&quot;. GCHQ transformed itself accordingly, including greatly expanded Public Relations and Legal departments, and adopting public education in cyber security as an important part of its remit.

==== 2010s: Disinformation, discord and division ====
In February 2014, &quot;The Guardian&quot;, based on documents provided by Snowden, revealed that GCHQ had indiscriminately collected 1.8 million private Yahoo webcam images from users across the world. In the same month NBC and The Intercept, based on documents released by Snowden, revealed the Joint Threat Research Intelligence Group and the Computer Network Exploitation units within GCHQ. Their mission was cyber operations based on &quot;dirty tricks&quot; to shut down enemy communications, discredit, and plant misinformation on enemies. These operations were 5% of all GCHQ operations according to a conference slideshow presented by the GCHQ.

Soon after becoming Director of GCHQ in 2014, Robert Hannigan wrote an article in the &quot;Financial Times&quot; on the topic of internet surveillance, stating that &quot;however much [large US technology companies] may dislike it, they have become the command and control networks of choice for terrorists and criminals&quot; and that GCHQ and its sister agencies &quot;cannot tackle these challenges at scale without greater support from the private sector&quot;, arguing that most internet users &quot;would be comfortable with a better and more sustainable relationship between the [intelligence] agencies and the tech companies&quot;. Since the 2013 global surveillance disclosures, large US technology companies have improved security and become less co-operative with foreign intelligence agencies, including those of the UK, generally requiring a US court order before disclosing data. However the head of the UK technology industry group techUK rejected these claims, stating that they understood the issues but that disclosure obligations &quot;must be based upon a clear and transparent legal framework and effective oversight rather than, as suggested, a deal between the industry and government&quot;.

In 2015, documents obtained by &quot;The Intercept&quot; from US National Security Agency whistleblower Edward Snowden revealed that GCHQ had carried out a mass-surveillance operation, codenamed KARMA POLICE, since about 2008. The operation swept up the IP address of Internet users visiting websites, and was established with no public scrutiny or oversight. KARMA POLICE is a powerful spying tool in conjunction with other GCHQ programs because IP addresses could be cross-referenced with other data. The goal of the program, according to the documents, was &quot;either (a) a web browsing profile for every visible user on the internet, or (b) a user profile for every visible website on the internet.&quot;

In 2015, GCHQ admitted for the first time in court that it conducts computer hacking.

In 2017, US Press Secretary Sean Spicer made allegations that GCHQ had conducted surveillance on US President Donald Trump. These unfounded claims were based on statements made during an opinion piece in a FOX media segment. The US government formally apologised for the unfounded allegations and promised they would not be repeated.

British intelligence did gather information relating to Russian contacts made by Trump&#x27;s campaign team in the run-up to his election, which were passed on to US intelligence agencies.

On 31 October 2018, GCHQ joined Instagram.

==Personnel awards==
GCHQ personnel are recognised annually by King Charles III (formerly the Prince of Wales) at the Prince of Wales&#x27;s Intelligence Community Awards at St James&#x27;s Palace or Clarence House alongside members of the Security Service (MI5), and Secret Intelligence Service (MI6). Awards and citations are given to teams within the agencies as well as individuals.

==Security mission==
As well as a mission to gather intelligence, GCHQ has for a long time had a corresponding mission to assist in the protection of the British government&#x27;s own communications. When the Government Code and Cypher School (GC&amp;CS) was created in 1919, its overt task was providing security advice. GC&amp;CS&#x27;s Security section was located in Mansfield College, Oxford during the Second World War.

In April 1946, GC&amp;CS became GCHQ, and the now GCHQ Security section moved from Oxford to join the rest of the organisation at Eastcote later that year.

===LCSA===
From 1952 to 1954, the intelligence mission of GCHQ relocated to Cheltenham; the Security section remained at Eastcote, and in March 1954 became a separate, independent organisation: the London Communications Security Agency (LCSA), which in 1958 was renamed to the London Communications-Electronic Security Agency (LCESA).

In April 1965, GPO and MOD units merged with LCESA to become the Communications-Electronic Security Department (CESD).

===CESG===
In October 1969, CESD was merged into GCHQ and becoming Communications-Electronic Security Group (CESG).

In 1977 CESG relocated from Eastcote to Cheltenham.

CESG continued as the UK National Technical Authority for information assurance, including cryptography. CESG did not manufacture security equipment, but worked with industry to ensure the availability of suitable products and services, while GCHQ itself funded research into such areas, for example to the Centre for Quantum Computation at Oxford University and the Heilbronn Institute for Mathematical Research at the University of Bristol.

In the 21st century, CESG ran a number of assurance schemes such as CHECK, CLAS, Commercial Product Assurance (CPA) and CESG Assisted Products Service (CAPS).

====Public key encryption====
In 1970 the concept for public-key encryption (public key infrastructure) was developed and proven by GCHQ&#x27;s James H. Ellis. Ellis lacked the number theory skills required to build a workable system. In 1974 GCHQ mathematician Clifford Cocks had developed a workable public key cryptography algorithm and a workable PKI system. Cocks&#x27;s system was not available in the public domain until it was declassified in 1997.

By 1997 broader public key cryptography commercial technologies had been independently developed and had become well established, in areas such as email security, digital signatures, and TLS (a fundamental TCP/IP security component) etc. Most notably in 1977 the RSA algorithm had been developed (equivalent to Cocks&#x27;s system) and by 1997 was extremely well established.

===NCSC===
In 2016, the National Cyber Security Centre was established under GCHQ but located in London, as the UK&#x27;s authority on cybersecurity. It absorbed and replaced CESG as well as activities that had previously existed outside GCHQ: the Centre for Cyber Assessment (CCA), Computer Emergency Response Team UK (CERT UK) and the cyber-related responsibilities of the Centre for the Protection of National Infrastructure (CPNI).

==Joint Technical Language Service==
The Joint Technical Language Service (JTLS) was established in 1955, drawing on members of the small Ministry of Defence technical language team and others, initially to provide standard English translations for organisational expressions in any foreign language, discover the correct English equivalents of technical terms in foreign languages and discover the correct expansions of abbreviations in any language. The remit of the JTLS has expanded in the ensuing years to cover technical language support and interpreting and translation services across the UK Government and to local public sector services in Gloucestershire and surrounding counties. The JTLS also produces and publishes foreign language working aids under crown copyright and conducts research into machine translation and on-line dictionaries and glossaries. The JTLS is co-located with GCHQ for administrative purposes.

==International relationships==

GCHQ operates in partnership with equivalent agencies worldwide in a number of bi-lateral and multi-lateral relationships. The principal of these is with the United States (National Security Agency), Canada (Communications Security Establishment), Australia (Australian Signals Directorate) and New Zealand (Government Communications Security Bureau), through the mechanism of the UK-US Security Agreement, a broad intelligence-sharing agreement encompassing a range of intelligence collection methods. Relationships are alleged to include shared collection methods, such as the system described in the popular media as ECHELON, as well as analysed product.

==Legal basis==

GCHQ&#x27;s legal basis is established by the Intelligence Services Act 1994 Section 3 as follows:

Activities that involve interception of communications are permitted under the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000; this kind of interception can only be carried out after a warrant has been issued by a Secretary of State. The Human Rights Act 1998 requires the intelligence agencies, including GCHQ, to respect citizens&#x27; rights as described in the European Convention on Human Rights.

===Oversight===
The Prime Minister nominates cross-party Members of Parliament to an Intelligence and Security Committee. The remit of the Committee includes oversight of intelligence and security activities and reports are made directly to Parliament. Its functions were increased under the Justice and Security Act 2013 to provide for further access and investigatory powers.

Judicial oversight of GCHQ&#x27;s conduct is exercised by the Investigatory Powers Tribunal. The UK also has an independent Intelligence Services Commissioner and Interception of Communications Commissioner, both of whom are former senior judges.

The Investigatory Powers Tribunal ruled in December 2014 that GCHQ does not breach the European Convention of Human Rights, and that its activities are compliant with Articles 8 (right to privacy) and 10 (freedom of expression) of the European Convention of Human Rights. However, the Tribunal stated in February 2015 that one particular aspect, the data-sharing arrangement that allowed UK Intelligence services to request data from the US surveillance programmes Prism and Upstream, had been in contravention of human rights law prior to this until two paragraphs of additional information, providing details about the procedures and safeguards, were disclosed to the public in December 2014.

Furthermore, the IPT ruled that the legislative framework in the United Kingdom does not permit mass surveillance and that while GCHQ collects and analyses data in bulk, it does not practice mass surveillance. This complements independent reports by the Interception of Communications Commissioner, and a special report made by the Intelligence and Security Committee of Parliament; although several shortcomings and potential improvements to both oversight and the legislative framework were highlighted.

===Abuses===

Despite the inherent secrecy around much of GCHQ&#x27;s work, investigations carried out by the UK government after the Snowden disclosures have admitted various abuses by the security services. A report by the Intelligence and Security Committee (ISC) in 2015 revealed that a small number of staff at UK intelligence agencies had been found to misuse their surveillance powers, in one case leading to the dismissal of a member of staff at GCHQ, although there were no laws in place at the time to make these abuses a criminal offence.

Later that year, a ruling by the Investigatory Powers Tribunal found that GCHQ acted unlawfully in conducting surveillance on two human rights organisations. The closed hearing found the government in breach of its internal surveillance policies in accessing and retaining the communications of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights and the Legal Resources Centre in South Africa. This was only the second time in the IPT&#x27;s history that it had made a positive determination in favour of applicants after a closed session.

At another IPT case in 2015, GCHQ conceded that &quot;from January 2010, the regime for the interception/obtaining, analysis, use, disclosure and destruction of legally privileged material has not been in accordance with the law for the purposes of Article 8(2) of the European convention on human rights and was accordingly unlawful&quot;. This admission was made in connection with a case brought against them by Abdelhakim Belhaj, a Libyan opponent of the former Gaddafi regime, and his wife Fatima Bouchard. The couple accused British ministers and officials of participating in their unlawful abduction, kidnapping and removal to Libya in March 2004, while Gaddafi was still in power.

On 25 May 2021, the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) ruled that the GCHQ is guilty of violating data privacy rules through their bulk interception of communications, and does not provide sufficient protections for confidential journalistic material because it gathers communications in bulk.

====Surveillance of parliamentarians====
In 2015 there was a complaint by Green Party MP Caroline Lucas that British intelligence services, including GCHQ, had been spying on MPs allegedly &quot;in defiance of laws prohibiting it.&quot;

Then-Home Secretary, Theresa May, had told Parliament in 2014 that:
The Investigatory Powers Tribunal investigated the complaint, and ruled that contrary to the allegation, there was no law that gave the communications of Parliament any special protection. The Wilson Doctrine merely acts as a political convention.

==Constitutional legal case==
A controversial GCHQ case determined the scope of judicial review of prerogative powers (the Crown&#x27;s residual powers under common law). This was &quot;Council of Civil Service Unions v Minister for the Civil Service&quot; [1985] AC 374 (often known simply as the &quot;GCHQ case&quot;). In this case, a prerogative Order in Council had been used by the prime minister (who is the Minister for the Civil Service) to ban trade union activities by civil servants working at GCHQ. This order was issued without consultation. The House of Lords had to decide whether this was reviewable by judicial review. It was held that executive action is not immune from judicial review simply because it uses powers derived from common law rather than statute (thus the prerogative is reviewable).

== In popular culture ==

In the historical drama film &quot;The Imitation Game&quot; (2014) Benedict Cumberbatch portrays Alan Turing in his efforts to break the Enigma code while employed by the Government Code and Cypher School.

GCHQ have set a number of cryptic online challenges to the public, used to attract interest and for recruitment, starting in late 1999. The response to the 2004 challenge was described as &quot;excellent&quot;, and the challenge set in 2015 had over 600,000 attempts. It also published the &quot;GCHQ Puzzle Book&quot; in 2016 which sold more than 300,000 copies, with the proceeds going to charity. A second book was published in October 2018.

GCHQ appeared in the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; 2019 special &quot;Resolution&quot; where the Reconnaissance Scout Dalek storms the facility and exterminates the staff in order to use the organisation&#x27;s resources to summon a Dalek fleet.

GCHQ is the setting of the 2020 Sky One sitcom &quot;Intelligence&quot;, featuring David Schwimmer as an incompetent American NSA officer liaising with GCHQ&#x27;s Cyber Crimes unit.

In October 2020, intelligence and security expert John Ferris published &quot;Behind the Enigma: The Authorised History of GCHQ, Britain&#x27;s Secret Cyber-Intelligence Agency&quot;.

GCHQ is the setting of the 2022 Channel 4 drama &quot;The Undeclared War&quot;. Set in the near future, it depicts a work experience student at the government agency during a cyberattack on the UK and the implications.

<text>Francis Gary Powers (August 17, 1929August 1, 1977) was an American pilot who served as a United States Air Force officer and a CIA employee. Powers is best known for his involvement in the 1960 U-2 incident, when he was shot down while flying a secret CIA spying mission over the Soviet Union. Powers survived, but was captured and sentenced to 10 years in a Soviet prison for espionage. He served 21 months of his sentence before being released in a prisoner swap in 1962.

After returning to the US, he worked at Lockheed as a test pilot for the U-2, and later as a helicopter pilot for Los Angeles news station KNBC. He died in 1977, when the KNBC helicopter he was flying crashed.

==Early life and education==
Powers was born August 17, 1929, in Jenkins, Kentucky, the son of Oliver, a coal miner, and his wife Ida. Powers was the only boy among the family&#x27;s six children. Oliver, who often struggled to make ends meet, wanted his son to be a physician. When Powers was fourteen, he rode in a Piper Cub airplane at a state fair in West Virginia, sparking his fascination with aviation.

During World War II, the Powers family briefly moved to Detroit, where Oliver had taken a job at a defense plant, before returning to Grundy, Virginia, where Powers finished high school. Powers then entered Milligan College as a pre-med student, but switched majors to biology and chemistry in his third year. He graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in 1950. Powers married Barbara Gay Moore in Newnan, Georgia, on April 2, 1955.

==United States Air Force==
Powers enlisted in the United States Air Force in October 1950, initially working as a photo lab technician. He was accepted for flight training in November 1951, and was commissioned as a second lieutenant in December 1952 after completing advanced training on T-33 and F-80 aircraft at Williams Air Force Base in Arizona. While assigned to gunnery school at Luke Air Force Base, a bout of appendicitis delayed his training, and the Korean War ended by the time he graduated. 

Powers was then assigned to the 468th Strategic Fighter Squadron at Turner Air Force Base, Georgia, as a Republic F-84 Thunderjet pilot. In October 1953, Powers was trained at Sandia Base in loading and dropping nuclear weapons from fighter aircraft, and in July 1954 was promoted to first lieutenant. Powers hoped to become a commercial airline pilot when his enlistment ended in December 1955, but decided to stay in the Air Force when he discovered he was, at the age of 26-and-a-half, at the age limit for commercial training.


==U-2 incident==
In January 1956, Powers was recruited by the CIA, and on May 13, 1956, he was discharged from the Air Force at the rank of captain, becoming a civilian employee of the CIA with the grade of GS-13. 

In May 1956, Powers began U-2 training at Watertown Strip, Nevada. His training was complete by August 1956 and his unit, the Second Weather Observational Squadron (Provisional) or Detachment 10-10, was deployed to Incirlik Air Base, Turkey.

Powers then joined the CIA&#x27;s U-2 program. U-2 pilots flew espionage missions at altitudes above , above the reach of Soviet air defenses until 1960. The U-2 was equipped with a state-of-the-art camera designed to take high-resolution photos from the stratosphere over hostile countries, including the Soviet Union. U-2 missions systematically photographed military installations and other important sites. By 1960, Powers was already a veteran of many covert aerial reconnaissance missions. Family members believed that he was a NASA weather reconnaissance pilot.

===Reconnaissance mission===
The primary mission of the U-2s was to overfly the Soviet Union. Soviet intelligence had been aware of encroaching U-2 flights at least since 1958 if not earlier but lacked effective countermeasures until 1960. On May 1, 1960, Powers&#x27; U-2A, &quot;56-6693&quot;, departed from a military airbase in Peshawar, Pakistan, with support from the U.S. Air Station at Badaber (Peshawar Air Station). This was to be the first attempt &quot;to fly all the way across the Soviet Union ... but it was considered worth the gamble. The planned route would take us deeper into Russia than we had ever gone, while traversing important targets never before photographed.&quot;

===Shot down===
Powers was shot down by an S-75 Dvina (SA-2 &quot;Guideline&quot;) surface-to-air missile over Sverdlovsk. A total of 14 Dvinas were launched, one of which hit a MiG-19 jet fighter which was sent to intercept the U-2 but could not reach a high enough altitude. Its pilot, Sergei Safronov, ejected but died of his injuries. Another Soviet aircraft, a newly manufactured Su-9 on a transit flight, also attempted to intercept Powers&#x27; U-2. The unarmed Su-9 was directed to ram the U-2 but missed because of the large differences in speed.

As Powers flew near Kosulino in the Ural Region, three S-75 Dvinas were launched at his U-2, with the first one hitting the aircraft. &quot;What was left of the plane began spinning, only upside down, the nose pointing upward toward the sky, the tail down toward the ground.&quot; According to his book &quot;Operation Overflight&quot;, Powers delayed activating the camera&#x27;s self-destruct mechanism until he made sure he could exit the cockpit before the charges detonated. When &quot;g&quot;-forces unexpectedly threw him from the spinning aircraft, he could no longer reach the destruct switches. While descending under his parachute, Powers had time to scatter his escape map, and rid himself of part of his suicide device, a silver dollar coin suspended around his neck containing a poison-laced injection pin, though he kept the poison pin. &quot;Yet I was still hopeful of escape.&quot; He hit the ground hard, was immediately captured, and taken to Lubyanka Prison in Moscow. Powers did note a second chute after landing on the ground, &quot;some distance away and very high, a lone red and white parachute&quot;.

===Attempted deception by the U.S. government===
When the U.S. government learned of Powers&#x27; disappearance over the Soviet Union, they lied that a &quot;weather plane&quot; had strayed off course after its pilot had &quot;difficulties with his oxygen equipment&quot;. What CIA officials did not realize was that the plane crashed almost fully intact and that the Soviets had recovered its pilot and much of the plane&#x27;s equipment, including its new top-secret high-altitude camera. Powers was interrogated extensively by the KGB for months before he made a confession and a public apology for his part in espionage.

===Portrayal in U.S. media===
Following admission by the White House that Powers had been captured alive, American media depicted Powers as an all-American pilot hero, who never smoked or touched alcohol. In fact, Powers smoked and drank socially. The CIA urged that his wife Barbara be given sedatives before speaking to the press and gave her talking points that she repeated to the press to portray her as a devoted wife. Her broken leg, according to the CIA disinformation, was the result of a water-skiing accident, when in fact it happened after she had had too much to drink and was dancing with another man.

In the course of his trial for espionage in the Soviet Union, Powers confessed to the charges against him and apologized for violating Soviet airspace to spy on the Soviets. In the wake of his apology, American media often depicted Powers as a coward and even as a symptom of the decay of America&#x27;s &quot;moral character.&quot;

===Pilot testimony compromised by newspaper reports===
Powers tried to limit the information he shared with the KGB to that which could be determined from the remains of his plane&#x27;s wreckage. He was hampered by information appearing in the western press. A KGB major stated &quot;there&#x27;s no reason for you to withhold information. We&#x27;ll find it out anyway. Your Press will give it to us.&quot; However, he limited his divulging of CIA contacts to one individual, with a pseudonym of &quot;Collins&quot;. At the same time, he repeatedly stated the maximum altitude for the U-2 was , lower than its actual flight ceiling.

===Political consequence===
The incident set back talks between Khrushchev and Eisenhower. Powers&#x27; interrogations ended on June 30, and his solitary confinement ended on July 9. On August 17, 1960, his trial began for espionage before the military division of the Supreme Court of the Soviet Union. Lieutenant General Borisoglebsky, Major General Vorobyev, and Major General Zakharov presided. Roman Rudenko acted as prosecutor in his capacity of Procurator General of the Soviet Union. Mikhail I. Grinev served as Powers&#x27; defense counsel in the trial. In attendance were his parents and sister, and his wife Barbara and her mother. His father brought along his attorney Carl McAfee, while the CIA provided two additional attorneys.

===Conviction===
On August 19, 1960, Powers was convicted of espionage, &quot;a grave crime covered by Article 2 of the Soviet Union&#x27;s law &#x27;On Criminality Responsibility for State Crimes. His sentence consisted of 10 years&#x27; confinement, three of which were to be in a prison, with the remainder in a labor camp. The US Embassy &quot;News Bulletin&quot; stated, according to Powers, &quot;as far as the government was concerned, I had acted in accordance with the instructions given [to] me and would receive my full salary while imprisoned&quot;.

He was held in Vladimir Central Prison, about east of Moscow, in building number 2 from September 9, 1960, until February 8, 1962. His cellmate was Zigurds Krūmiņš, a Latvian political prisoner. Powers kept a diary and a journal while confined. Additionally, he learned carpet weaving from his cellmate to pass the time. He could send and receive a limited number of letters to and from his family. The prison now contains a small museum with an exhibit on Powers, who allegedly developed a good rapport with Soviet prisoners there. Some pieces of the plane and Powers&#x27; uniform are on display at the Monino Airbase museum near Moscow.

===Prisoner exchange===
====CIA opposition to exchange====
The CIA, in particular chief of CIA Counterintelligence James Jesus Angleton, opposed exchanging Powers for Soviet KGB Colonel William Fisher, known as &quot;Rudolf Abel&quot;, who had been caught by the FBI in the Hollow Nickel Case and tried and jailed for espionage. First, Angleton believed that Powers might have deliberately defected to the Soviet side. CIA documents released in 2010 indicate that U.S. officials did not believe Powers&#x27; account of the incident at the time, because it was contradicted by a classified National Security Agency (NSA) report which alleged that the U-2 had descended from before changing course and disappearing from radar. The NSA report remains classified as of 2022.

In any event, Angleton suspected that Powers had already revealed all he knew to the Soviets and therefore reasoned that Powers was worthless to the U.S. On the other hand, according to Angleton, William Fisher had revealed little to the CIA, refusing to disclose even his real name, and for this reason, William Fisher was still of potential value.

However, Barbara Powers, Gary Powers&#x27; wife, was allegedly often drinking and having affairs. On June 22, 1961, she was pulled over by the police after driving erratically and was caught driving under the influence. To avoid bad publicity for the wife of the well-known CIA operative, doctors tasked by the CIA to keep Barbara out of the limelight arranged to have her committed to a psychiatric ward in Augusta, Georgia, under strict supervision. She was eventually released to the care of her mother. However, the CIA feared that Gary Powers languishing in Soviet prison might learn of Barbara&#x27;s plight and as a result reach a state of desperation causing him to reveal to the Soviets whatever secrets he had not already revealed. Thus, Barbara unwittingly may have aided the cause of the approval of the prisoner exchange involving her husband and William Fisher. Angleton and others at the CIA still opposed the exchange but President John F. Kennedy approved it.

====The exchange====
On February 10, 1962, Powers was exchanged, along with U.S. student Frederic Pryor, for Soviet KGB Colonel Rudolf Abel. Due to political differences between the Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic at the time, Pryor was turned over to American authorities at Checkpoint Charlie, before the exchange of Powers for Abel was allowed to proceed on the Glienicke Bridge.

Powers credited his father with the swap idea. When released, Powers&#x27; total time in captivity was 1 year, 9 months, and 10 days.

==Aftermath==
Powers initially received a cold reception on his return home. He was criticized for not activating his aircraft&#x27;s self-destruct charge to destroy the camera, photographic film, and related classified parts. He was also criticized for not using an optional CIA-issued &quot;suicide pin&quot; to kill himself. Powers wore a hollowed-out silver dollar on a chain around his neck that disguised within it a grooved needle embedded with deadly shellfish toxin designed to kill by pricking the skin. Powers decided against doing so.

He was debriefed extensively by the CIA, Lockheed Corporation, and the Air Force, after which a statement was issued by CIA director John McCone that &quot;Mr. Powers lived up to the terms of his employment and instructions in connection with his mission and in his obligations as an American.&quot; On March 6, 1962, he appeared before a Senate Armed Services Select Committee hearing chaired by Senator Richard Russell Jr. which included Senators Prescott Bush, Leverett Saltonstall, Robert Byrd, Margaret Chase Smith, John Stennis, Strom Thurmond, and Barry Goldwater. During the hearing, Senator Saltonstall stated, &quot;I commend you as a courageous, fine young American citizen who lived up to your instructions and who did the best you could under very difficult circumstances.&quot; Senator Bush declared, &quot;I am satisfied he has conducted himself in exemplary fashion and in accordance with the highest traditions of service to one&#x27;s country, and I congratulate him upon his conduct in captivity.&quot; Senator Goldwater sent him a handwritten note: &quot;You did a good job for your country.&quot;

In &quot;Operation Overflight&quot;, Powers wrote that upon joining the CIA in 1956, he had cosigned a document with Secretary of the Air Force Donald A. Quarles, guaranteeing Powers could return to the Air Force at his previous rank after his CIA service ended, with his CIA service time counting toward his Air Force retirement. Powers, who did not retain a copy of this document, wrote that his six-and-a-half years of CIA service time was not honored due to bad publicity surrounding his case, and was a major factor in him deciding not to rejoin the Air Force.

===Divorce and remarriage===

Powers sued his wife for divorce on August 14, 1962, claiming she cursed and abused him for no reason. Powers stated that the reasons for the divorce included her infidelity and alcoholism, adding that she constantly threw tantrums and overdosed on pills shortly after his return. He started a relationship with Claudia Edwards &quot;Sue&quot; Downey, whom he had met while working briefly at CIA Headquarters. Downey had a child, Dee, from her previous marriage. They were married on October 26, 1963. Their son Francis Gary Powers, Jr. was born on June 5, 1965. The marriage proved to be a very happy one, and Sue worked hard to preserve her husband&#x27;s legacy after his death.

===Praise===
During a speech in March 1964, former CIA Director Allen Dulles said of Powers, &quot;He performed his duty in a very dangerous mission and he performed it well, and I think I know more about that than some of his detractors and critics know, and I am glad to say that to him tonight.&quot;

===Later career===

Powers worked for Lockheed as a test pilot from 1962 to 1970, though the CIA paid his salary. In 1970, he wrote the book &quot;Operation Overflight&quot; with co-author Curt Gentry. Lockheed fired him, because &quot;the book&#x27;s publication had ruffled some feathers at Langley.&quot; Powers then became a traffic reporting airplane pilot for Los Angeles radio station KGIL. After that he became a helicopter news reporter for KNBC television.

==Death==

Powers was piloting a helicopter for Los Angeles TV station KNBC Channel 4 over the San Fernando Valley on August 1, 1977, when the aircraft crashed, killing him and his cameraman George Spears. They had been recording video following brush fires in Santa Barbara County in the KNBC helicopter and were heading back when the crash occurred.

His Bell 206 JetRanger helicopter ran out of fuel and crashed at the Sepulveda Dam recreational area in Encino, California, several miles short of its intended landing site at Burbank Airport. The National Transportation Safety Board report attributed the probable cause of the crash to pilot error. According to Powers&#x27; son, an aviation mechanic had repaired a faulty fuel gauge without informing Powers, who subsequently misread it.

It is surmised that, at the last moment, he noticed children playing in the area and directed the helicopter elsewhere to avoid landing on them. He might have landed safely if not for the last-second deviation, which compromised his autorotative descent. Powers was survived by his wife, children (Claudia Dee and Francis Gary Powers Jr.), and five sisters. He is buried in Arlington National Cemetery as an Air Force veteran.

==Honors==


Powers received the CIA&#x27;s Intelligence Star in 1965, two years after it was awarded to all the other CIA U-2 pilots. Powers was originally scheduled to receive it in April 1963 along with other pilots involved in the CIA&#x27;s U-2 program, but the award was postponed for political reasons. In 1970, Powers published his first—and only—book review, on a work about aerial reconnaissance, &quot;Unarmed and Unafraid&quot; by Glenn Infield, in the monthly magazine &quot;Business &amp; Commercial Aviation&quot;. &quot;The subject has great interest to me,&quot; he said, in submitting his review.

In 1998, newly declassified information revealed that Powers&#x27; mission had been a joint USAF/CIA operation. In 2000, on the 40th anniversary of the U-2 Incident, his family was presented with his posthumously awarded Prisoner of War Medal, Distinguished Flying Cross, and National Defense Service Medal. In addition, CIA Director George Tenet authorized Powers to posthumously receive the CIA&#x27;s coveted Director&#x27;s Medal for extreme fidelity and extraordinary courage in the line of duty.

On June 15, 2012, Powers was posthumously awarded the Silver Star medal for &quot;demonstrating &#x27;exceptional loyalty&#x27; while enduring harsh interrogation in the Lubyanka Prison in Moscow for almost two years.&quot; Air Force Chief of Staff General Norton Schwartz presented the decoration to Powers&#x27; grandchildren, Trey Powers, 9, and Lindsey Berry, 29, in a Pentagon ceremony.

==Legacy==

Powers&#x27; son, Francis Gary Powers Jr., founded The Cold War Museum in 1996. Originally affiliated with the Smithsonian Institution, it began as a traveling exhibit on the U-2 Incident until it found a permanent home in 2011 at Vint Hill Farm Station, a former Army communications base outside Washington, D.C., in Warrenton, Virginia.

<text>The Gospel of James (or the Protoevangelium of James) is a second-century infancy gospel telling of the miraculous conception of the Virgin Mary, her upbringing and marriage to Joseph, the journey of the couple to Bethlehem, the birth of Jesus, and events immediately following. It is the earliest surviving assertion of the perpetual virginity of Mary, meaning her virginity not just prior to the birth of Jesus, but during and afterwards, and despite being condemned by Pope Innocent I in 405 and classified as apocryphal by the Gelasian Decree around AD 500, became a widely influential source for Mariology.

==Composition==

===Dating===
The Gospel of James was well known to Origen in the early third century and probably to Clement of Alexandria at the end of the second, so is assumed to have been in circulation soon after &quot;circa&quot; 150 AD. The author claims to be James the brother of Jesus by an earlier marriage of Joseph, but in fact his identity is unknown. The earliest manuscript of the text (Papyrus Bodmer 5) dates to the third or fourth century.

=== Historical context ===
Early studies assumed a Jewish milieu, largely because of its frequent use and knowledge of the Septuagint (a Greek translation of the Jewish scriptures); further investigation demonstrated that it misunderstands and/or misrepresents many Jewish practices, but Judaism at this time was highly diverse, and recent trends in scholarship do not entirely dismiss a Jewish connection. Its origin is probably Syrian, and it possibly derives from a sect called the Encratites, whose founder, Tatian, taught that sex and marriage were symptoms of original sin.

=== Sources ===
The gospel is a &quot;midrash&quot; (an elaboration) on the birth narratives found in the gospels of Matthew and Luke, and many of its elements, notably its very physical description of Mary&#x27;s pregnancy and the examination of her hymen by the midwife Salome, suggest strongly that it was attempting to deny the arguments of docetists, Christians who held that Jesus was entirely supernatural. It also draws heavily on the Septuagint for historical analogies, turns of phrase, and details of Jewish life. Ronald Hock and Mary F. Foskett have drawn attention to the influence of Greco-Roman literature on its themes of virginity and purity.

===Manuscripts===
Scholars generally accept that the Gospel of James was originally composed in Greek. Over 100 Greek manuscripts have survived, and translations were made into Syriac, Ethiopic, Sahidic Coptic, Georgian, Old Church Slavonic, Armenian, Arabic, and presumably Latin, given that it was apparently known to the compiler of the Gelasian Decree. The oldest is Papyrus Bodmer 5 from the fourth or possibly third century, discovered in 1952 and now in the Bodmer Library, Geneva, while the fullest is a 10th-century Greek codex in the Bibliothèque Nationale, Paris. 

=== Print editions ===
The first widely printed edition (as opposed to hand-copied manuscripts) was a 1552 edition printed in Basel, Switzerland, by Guillaume Postel, who printed his Latin translation of a Greek version of the work. Postel also gave the work the Latin name (Proto-Gospel of James) because he believed (incorrectly) that the work antedated the main gospels of the New Testament (proto- for first, evangelion for gospel). Emile de Stryker published the standard modern critical edition in 1961, and in 1995 Ronald Hock published an English translation based on de Stryker.

==Structure and content==
The narrative is made up of three distinct sections with only slight ties to each other:
# Chapters 1–17: A biography of Mary, dealing with her miraculous birth and holy infancy and childhood, her engagement to Joseph and virginal conception of Jesus
# Chapters 18–20: The birth of Jesus, including proof that Mary continued to be a virgin even after the birth
# Chapters 22–24: The death of Zacharias, father of John the Baptist

Mary is presented as an extraordinary child destined for great things from the moment of her conception. Her parents, the wealthy Joachim and his wife Anna (or Anne), are distressed that they have no children, and Joachim goes into the wilderness to pray, leaving Anna to lament her childless state. God hears Anna&#x27;s prayer, angels announce the coming child, and in the seventh month of Anna&#x27;s pregnancy (underlining the exceptional nature of Mary&#x27;s future life), she is born. Anna dedicates the child to God and vows that she shall be raised in the Temple. Joachim and Anna name the child Mary, and when she is three years old, they send her to the Temple, where she is fed each day by an angel.

When Mary approaches her 12th year, the priests decide that she can no longer stay in the Temple lest her menstrual blood render it unclean, and God finds a widower, Joseph, to act as her guardian: Joseph is depicted as elderly and the father of grown sons; he has no desire for sexual relations with Mary. He leaves on business, and Mary is called to the Temple to help weave the temple curtain. One day while Mary is spinning thread for the curtain, the angel Gabriel appears and tells her that she has been chosen to conceive Jesus the Saviour, but that she will not give birth as other women do. Joseph returns and finds Mary six months pregnant, and rebukes her, fearing that the priests will assume that he is the guilty party. They do, but the chastity of both is proven through the &quot;test of bitter waters&quot;.

The Roman census forces the holy couple to travel to Bethlehem, but Mary&#x27;s time comes before they can reach the village. Joseph settles Mary in a cave, where she is guarded by his sons, while he goes in search of a midwife, and for an apocalyptic moment as he searches all creation stands still. He returns with a midwife, and as they stand at the mouth of the cave, a cloud overshadows it, an intense light fills it, and suddenly a baby is at Mary&#x27;s breast. Joseph and the midwife marvel at the miracle, but a second midwife named Salome (the first is not given a name) insists on examining Mary, upon which her hand withers as a sign of her lack of faith; Salome prays to God for forgiveness and an angel appears and tells her to touch the Christ Child, upon which her hand is healed.

The gospel concludes with the visit of the Three Magi, the massacre of the innocents in Bethlehem, the martyrdom of the High Priest Zechariah (father of John the Baptist), the election of his successor Simeon, and an epilogue telling the circumstances under which the work was supposedly composed.

==Influence==

===Christianity===
The Gospel of James was a widely influential source for Christian doctrine regarding Mary. According to Bernhard Lohse, it is the earliest assertion of her perpetual virginity, meaning her virginity not just prior to the birth of Jesus, but during the birth and afterwards. Its explanation of the gospels&#x27; &quot;brothers of Jesus&quot; (the &quot;adelphoi&quot;) as the offspring of Joseph by an earlier marriage remains the position of the Eastern church, but in the West, influential theologian Jerome asserted that Joseph himself had been a perpetual virgin, and that the&quot; adelphoi &quot;were cousins of the Lord. Jerome&#x27;s opposition to the Protevangelium led to a diminished influence and circulation in the western, Latin church. It was condemned by Pope Innocent I in 405 and rejected by the Gelasian Decree around 500. It was completely unknown in the West, and it was taken over by the widely read Gospel of Pseudo-Matthew, which popularized most of its stories.

The Gospel of James was the first to give the name Anne to the mother of Mary, taking it probably from Hannah, the mother of the prophet Samuel, and Mary, like Samuel, is taken to spend her childhood in the temple. Some manuscripts say of Anne&#x27;s pregnancy that it was the result of normal intercourse with her husband, but current scholars prefer the oldest texts, which say that Mary was conceived in Joachim&#x27;s absence through divine intervention; nevertheless, the Gospel of James does not advance the idea of Mary&#x27;s Immaculate Conception.

Various manuscripts place the birth of Mary in the sixth, seventh, eighth, or ninth month, with the oldest having the seventh; this was in keeping with both the Judaism of the period, which had similar seventh-month births for significant individuals such as Samuel, Isaac, and Moses, as the sign of a miraculous or divine conception. Further signs of Mary&#x27;s supremely holy nature follow, including Anne&#x27;s vow that the infant would never walk on the earth (her bedroom is made a &quot;sanctuary&quot; where she is attended by &quot;undefiled daughters of the Hebrews&quot;), her blessing &quot;with the ultimate blessing&quot; by the priests on her first birthday with the declaration that because of her God will bring redemption to Israel, and the angels who bring her food in the Temple, where she is attended by the priests and engages herself in weaving the temple curtain.

The ordeal of the bitter water serves to defend Jesus against accusation of illegitimacy levied in the second century by pagan and Jewish opponents of Christianity. Christian sensitivity to these charges made them eager to defend both the virgin birth of Jesus and the immaculate conception of Mary (i.e., her freedom from sin at the moment of her conception).

===Islam===
The Quranic stories of the Virgin Mary and the birth of Jesus are similar to those of the Protoevangelium, which was widely known in the Near East. These include its mention of Mary fed by angels, the choice of her guardian (Joseph) through the casting of lots, and her occupation making a curtain for the Temple immediately before the Annunciation. Nevertheless, while the Quran holds Mary in high esteem and modern Muslims agree with Christians that she was a virgin when she conceived Jesus, they would see the idea of her perpetual virginity (which is the central idea of James) as contrary to the Islamic ideal of women as wives and mothers.
