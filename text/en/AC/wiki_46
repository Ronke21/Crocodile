<text>Gil Álvarez Carrillo de Albornoz more commonly Gil de Albornoz (; – 23 August 1367), was a Spanish curial cardinal, archbishop of Toledo from 13 May 1338 to 17 December 1350. Grand Penitentiary from December 1352 to August 23, 1364. Cardinal priest with the title of San Clemente from December 17, 1350, to December 1356. Cardinal bishop of Sabina from December 1356 to August 23, 1364. Cardinal legate and vicar general from 30 June 1353 to 1357, who led as condottiere Papal States mercenary armies in two campaigns to reconquer territory in Italy, and statesman.

Albornoz was born in Carrascosa del Campo, Spain. Raised in Zaragoza and educated alongside his mother&#x27;s brother, Albornoz pursued his studies in law at Toulouse. As the Archbishop of Toledo, he held two reform synods, and throughout his career, he demonstrated his military prowess. He fought against a Marinid invasion from Morocco in 1340 at the Battle of Río Salado and led the armed levy of his archbishopric at the taking of Algeciras in 1344.

In 1350, Pope Clement VI appointed Albornoz as a cardinal-priest of S. Clemente, recognizing his military and diplomatic abilities. Shortly after Pope Innocent VI&#x27;s election in 1352, Albornoz was appointed grand penitentiary and given the epithet &quot;Angel of Peace.&quot; However, this title would become an ironic misnomer as he later led campaigns in the Papal States.

In 1353, Pope Innocent VI sent Albornoz to Italy with the goal of restoring papal authority in the Church states. Leading a small mercenary army, he embarked on a series of successful campaigns against various rulers, ultimately expanding the territories of the Papal States. During his time in Italy, Albornoz issued the &quot;Constitutiones Sanctæ Matris Ecclesiæ&quot;, which effectively regulated the Papal States and their division into provinces until 1816.

Despite a decade of warfare and multiple successful campaigns, Albornoz&#x27;s efforts did not completely secure peace and stability in Italy. The Papal State itself faced ongoing conflicts, and mercenary companies roamed Italy, spreading further bloodshed and strife. Regardless, as a mark of gratitude for his service, Pope Urban V appointed Albornoz as legate at Bologna in 1367.

In addition to his military and diplomatic achievements, Albornoz left a lasting legacy in the field of education. In 1364, he founded the College of Saint Clement in Bologna to benefit Castilian, Aragonese, and Portuguese students, providing them with a unique learning opportunity.

Albornoz was a descendant of the kings of León and Aragón and founder of the Collegio di Spagna, an academic institution of Bologna.

==Life==
===Early life===

Albornoz was the son of Garcialuarez Albornoz, IV Lord of Albornoz, tutor to the future King Alfonso XI, originally from Uña, Cuenca, and Doña Teresa de Luna, sister of , archbishop of Toledo and a member of the prominent Carrillo family. He was born in late 1302 or early 1303, in Carrascosa del Campo, (Cuenca). He was raised and educated in Zaragoza, with his mother&#x27;s brother, and studied law in Toulouse.

At the battle of Río Salado he successfully fought against a Marinid invasion from Morocco in 1340, and at the taking of Algeciras in 1344 he led the armed levy of his archbishopric. As Archbishop of Toledo he held two reform synods; one at Toledo in May 1339, the other at Alcalá in April 1347. In 1343 he had been sent to Pope Clement VI at Avignon to negotiate a grant of a tax on the revenues of the Church for the Crusade. Albornoz left Spain on the death of the king Alfonso XI in March 1350, and never returned. It has been said, but not on contemporary evidence, that he fled from fear of Pedro of Castile. His military and diplomatic ability became known to the pope, who made him a cardinal-priest of S. Clemente in December of that year, at which point he resigned the archbishopric of Toledo.

He was appointed grand penitentiary shortly after election of Pope Innocent VI in December 1352 and given the epithet &quot;Angel of Peace&quot;, a title which quickly became an ironic misnomer given his future campaigns in the Papal States.

==Campaigns==
===Italy===
====First====
In 1353 Innocent VI sent him as a legate into Italy, with a view to the restoration of the papal authority in the states of the Church, at the head of a small mercenary army. After receiving the support of the archbishop of Milan, Giovanni Visconti, and of those of Pisa, Florence and Siena, he started a campaign against Giovanni di Vico, lord of Viterbo, who had usurped much of the Papal territories in the Latium and Umbria. Giovanni was defeated in the battle of Viterbo of 10 March 1354 and signed a treaty of submission. To mark his authority over Viterbo, he immediately decided to build a palace there near the San Faustino church.

Albornoz then moved to the Marche and Romagna against the Malatesta of Rimini and the Ordelaffi of Forlì. The Papal commander Rodolfo II da Varano, lord of Camerino, defeated Galeotto Malatesta, forcing his family to become a loyal ally of the Pope. This was followed by the submission of the Montefeltro of Urbino and the da Polenta of Ravenna, and of the cities of Senigallia and Ancona. Towards the end of 1356 Albornoz was appointed as bishop of Sabina.

Only Giovanni Manfredi of Faenza and Francesco II Ordelaffi of Forlì were at that point resisting the Papal reconquest. In 1356, a crusade was declared against them. Albornoz had managed to submit only the former when he was being recalled in 1357, being replaced by Androin de la Roche, abbot of Cluny. Before leaving, in a meeting with all the Papal vicars held on 29 April 1357, Albornoz issued the &quot;Constitutiones Sanctæ Matris Ecclesiæ&quot;, which regulated all the matters of the Papal States and its division into provinces. They remained effective until 1816.

====Second====
The Cardinal was honoured as &quot;Pater Ecclesiæ&quot; at his arrival in Avignon. His sojourn there was to be short, however, as Giovanni di Vico and Francesco Ordelaffi (who had hired the famous condottiero Konrad von Landau&#x27;s &quot;Grand Company&quot;) were menacing the fragile balance of his last conquests. Returned to Italy, Albornoz found an agreement with Landau, forcing Ordelaffi to surrender on 4 July 1359. He then promulgates in the name of the pope the &quot;Constitutiones Sanctae Matri Ecclesiae&quot;, general regulations of the pontifical administration of the domain of Saint-Pierre.

Albornoz missed only Bologna to complete his rebuilding of the Papal States. When that city was attacked by Bernabò Visconti of Milan, its ruler, Giovanni d&#x27;Oleggio, decided to hand it over to Albornoz. In the meantime, Innocent died: the Spanish cardinal refused the tiara, and Urban V was elected. Under him Albornoz started the military campaign against Visconti and, when all attacks failed, Urban proclaimed a crusade against him.

As Urban&#x27;s greatest desire was that of a crusade against the Turks, the two parts signed a hasty peace, which was highly favourable to Visconti. The relentless work of Albornoz ushered in a decade of warfare and atrocity culminating in the massacre of Cesena, a town faithful to the Papal cause whose entire population was executed by the Papal forces while paving the way of Urban V to Rome (1367).

As legate, Albornoz showed himself to be an astute manager of men and effective fighter. He began by making use of Cola di Rienzo (former leader of the citizenship freedom in Rome), whose release from prison at Avignon he secured. After the murder of the tribune in 1354 Albornoz pursued his task of restoring the pope&#x27;s authority by intrigue and force with remarkable success. However, the ten years of bloody warfare conducted by Albornoz accomplished very little to secure the pacification of Italy for now four mercenary companies roved through Italy spreading further bloodshed and strife. The Papal State was itself far from completely pacified; a savage and devastating war went on from 1361 to 1367 between Rome and Velletri while in 1366-7 there was a general rebellion in Campagna. Despite all and as a mark of gratitude the pope appointed him legate at Bologna in 1367, but he died at Viterbo the same year. According to his own desire his remains were carried to Toledo, where Henry of Castile had them entombed with almost royal honours.

The college of Saint Clement at Bologna was founded by Albornoz for the benefit Castilian, Aragonese and Portuguese students, in 1364.

==Archbishop==
He was elected archbishop of Toledo by the cathedral chapter to succeed his uncle Jimeno de Luna. The election was confirmed by Pope Benedict XII by decree of the Pontifical Foreign Ministry given in Avignon on 13 May 1338, in which he is mentioned as &quot;Deacon, Archdian of the Order of Calatrava, Pontifical Chaplain and Doctor of Decrees&quot;.

<text>Giovanni Aldini (10 April 1762 – 17 January 1834) was an Italian physician and physicist born in Bologna. He was a brother of the statesman Count Antonio Aldini (1756–1826). He graduated in physics at University of Bologna in 1782.

He became professor of experimental physics at University of Bologna in 1798, in succession to his uncle Luigi Galvani (1737–1798). His scientific work was chiefly concerned with galvanism, anatomy and its medical applications, with the construction and illumination of lighthouses, and with experiments for preserving human life and material objects from destruction by fire. He wrote in French and English in addition to his native Italian, and in Latin, still used in the 18th century by the scientific community. In recognition of his merits, the emperor of Austria made him a Knight of the Iron Crown and a councillor of state at Milan, where he died. He bequeathed a considerable sum to found a school of natural science for artisans at Bologna.

==Experiments==

Aldini&#x27;s most famous public demonstration of the electro-stimulation technique of deceased limbs was performed on the executed criminal George Forster at Newgate in London in 1803. The Newgate Calendar describes what happened when the galvanic process was used on the body:

==Shelley&#x27;s Frankenstein association==

Mary Shelley (born Mary Godwin 30 August 1797) would have been only 5 years old in January 1803 when Aldini experimented on the corpse of George Foster. In her introduction to the 1831 edition of &quot;Frankenstein&quot; she does not mention Aldini, but &quot;galvanism&quot; was among the evening discussion topics before she experienced her &quot;waking dream&quot; that led to her writing.

<text>Girolamo Aleandro (also Hieronymus Aleander; 13 February 1480 – 1 February 1542) was an Italian humanist, linguist, and cardinal.

==Life==
Aleandro was born on 13 February 1480 in Motta di Livenza, in the province of Treviso, part of the Republic of Venice. The son of a doctor, he studied medicine, philology, and theology in Padua. In Venice he became acquainted with Erasmus and Aldus Manutius, and at an early age was reputed one of the most learned men of the time, with a knowledge of Greek, Latin, Hebrew, and Chaldaean. In 1508 he went to Paris on the invitation of Louis XII as professor of &quot;belles lettres,&quot; and from 1513 to 1516 held the position of Rector of the University of Paris at the Sorbonne. Entering the service of Érard de La Marck, prince-bishop of Liège, he was sent by that prelate on a mission to Rome, where Pope Leo X retained him, giving him (1519) the office of librarian of the Vatican. 

In the following year he went to Germany to be present as papal nuncio at the coronation of Emperor Charles V, and was also present at the Diet of Worms, where he headed the opposition to Martin Luther, advocating the most extreme measures to repress the doctrines of the reformer. His conduct evoked the fiercest denunciations of Luther, but it also displeased more moderate men, especially Erasmus. The edict against the reformer, which was finally adopted by the emperor and the diet, was drawn up and proposed by Aleandro. After the close of the Diet, the papal nuncio went to the Netherlands, where he instigated the executions of two monks of Antwerp due to their embrace of the Reformation, resulting in their being burnt in Brussels.

In August 1524 Pope Clement VII appointed Aleandro the Archbishop of Brindisi, for which office he was ordained to the priesthood two months later. The pope then sent him as nuncio to the court of King Francis I of France. He was taken prisoner along with that monarch at the Battle of Pavia in 1525, and was released only on payment of a heavy ransom. He was subsequently employed on various papal missions, especially to Germany, but was unsuccessful in preventing the German princes from making a truce with the reformers, or in checking to any extent the progress of the reformers&#x27; doctrines.

Aleandro was eventually consecrated a bishop on 28 February 1528 to fulfill the duties of his office. He was created a cardinal &quot;in pectore&quot; on 22 December 1536 by Pope Paul III (at the same time as Reginald Pole), which was published (i.e., publicly announced) only on 13 March 1538, at which time he was able to assume that office. He was given the rank of Cardinal Priest, with his titular church in Rome as San Ciriaco alle Terme Diocleziane, which was changed a week later to the Church of San Crisogono.

Aleandro resigned as Archbishop of Brindisi on 30 January 1541. He died at Rome on 1 February 1542. His remains were initially buried in his titular church, but later were transferred to his hometown and re-buried there in the Church of San Niccolò.

==Writings==
Aleandro compiled a &quot;Lexicon Graeco-Latinum&quot; (1512) and an introductory Greek grammar, the &quot;Elementale introductorium in nominum et verborum declinationes Graecas&quot; (1509), and edited Greek texts by Isocrates, Plutarch, and Lucian (1509–1510).
Some of his Latin verses were included in the &quot;Carmina Illustrium Poetarum Italiorum&quot; of Joannes Matthaeus Toscanus. The Vatican Library contains manuscript letters and other documents written by him in connection with his various missions against Luther, which are important sources for the Reformation and Counter-Reformation; they were used by (among others) the church historian Francesco Sforza Pallavicino in his history of the council of Trent.

<text>Galeazzo Alessi (1512 – 30 December 1572) was an Italian architect from Perugia, known throughout Europe for his distinctive style based on his enthusiasm for ancient architecture. He studied drawing for civil and military architecture under the direction of Giovanni Battista Caporali.

For a number of years he lived in Genoa. He was involved in the lay-out of the streets and the restoration of the city walls, as well as being responsible for many of its impressive palazzi, now a part of the World Heritage List. Alessi displayed particular aptitude for organizing compositions on sloping sites.
* Saint-Georges Church, Périgueux, France His work can be found in many other Italian cities, including in Ferrara, Bologna, Naples and Milan, where he designed the facade of Santa Maria presso San Celso. With Vignola, he designed the Basilica of Santa Maria degli Angeli in Assisi, the seventh largest Christian church at the time. Elsewhere in Europe, he designed churches and palaces in France, Germany and Flanders. He produced designs for El Escorial in Spain, but age and health prevented him from carrying them out.

<text>Giulio Aleni (; 1582– 10 June 1649), in Chinese , was an Italian Jesuit missionary and scholar. He was born in Leno near Brescia in Italy, at the time part of the Republic of Venice, and died at Yanping in China. He became a member of the Society of Jesus in 1600 and distinguished himself in his knowledge of mathematics and theology. He is known for helping publish the Zhifang Waiji, an atlas in Chinese. Giulio Aleni also wrote a treatise criticizing the Ming dynasty, the Ming emperors and their elites, and their mistakes and errors. Near the end of his life, the Ming dynasty eventually got destroyed and replaced by the Qing dynasty founded by the House of Aisin-Gioro.

==Life==
In 1610, he was sent as a missionary to China. While waiting at Macau for a favorable opportunity to enter the country, he taught mathematics to local scholars and published his &quot;Observation sur l&#x27;éclipse de lune du 8 Novembre 1612, faite a Macao&quot; (&quot;Mémoires de l&#x27;Acad. des Sciences&quot;, VII, 706).

He adopted the dress and manners of the country, was the first Christian missionary in Jiangxi, and built several churches in Fujian. One of his converts, Li Jiubiao, recorded the responses of Aleni and Andrius Rudamina, one of his fellow Jesuits, to the questions and speculations of his parishioners and compiled them into a journal.

==Works==
He published works in Chinese on a variety of topics. His cosmography, &quot;Wanwu Zhenyuan&quot; (萬物真原; The True Origin of the Ten-thousand Things), was translated into Manchu during the reign of the Kangxi Emperor (Wanwu Zhenyuan translated in Manchu script: Wylie: Tumen chakai unengki sekiyen, Möllendorff: Tumen jakai unengki sekiyen). A copy was sent from Beijing to Paris in 1789. He completed the work of earlier Jesuit scholars to produce the &quot;Zhifang waiji&quot;, a global atlas written in Chinese and one of the first to include the Americas. 

Among his most important religious works are a controversial treatise on the Catholic Faith, in which are refuted what he saw as the principal errors of the Ming dynasty; and &quot;The Life of God, the Saviour, from the Four Gospels&quot; (Peking, 1635–1637, 8 vols.; often reprinted, e.g. in 1887 in 3 vols) and used even by Protestant missionaries.

==Legacy==
The life and works of Giulio Aleni are the subject of several conferences in 1994 and 2010. Two of his books, &quot;Life of Matteo Ricci, Xitai of the West&quot; and &quot;Holy images of the Heavenly Lord&quot; have been presented to the public by &quot;Fondazione Civiltà Bresciana&quot; in two separate occasions, on 13 and 25 October 2010.

<text>The cuisine of Germany consists of many different local or regional cuisines, reflecting the country&#x27;s federal history. Germany itself is part of the larger cultural region of Central Europe, sharing many culinary traditions with neighbouring countries such as Poland and the Czech Republic (and Slovakia as well). In Northern Europe, in Denmark more specifically, the traditional Danish cuisine had also been influenced by German cuisine in the past, hence several dishes being common between the two countries (e.g. potato salad).

At the same time, German cuisine also shares many similar characteristics with Western European cuisine, as is reflected by some common traditional dishes served in the Low Countries (i.e. Netherlands, Belgium, and, most notably, Luxembourg). Southern German regions, such as Bavaria and Swabia, share dishes with Austrian cuisine and parts of Swiss cuisine as well. The German cuisine has also influenced other European cuisines from Central-Eastern Europe such as those of Hungary or Romania, both countries sharing past and current German heritage in general, through their ethnic German minorities (see also, for example in this regard, the Transylvanian Saxon cuisine).

The Michelin Guide of 2015 awarded a three-star ranking (the highest designation) to 11 restaurants in Germany, while 38 more received two-star rankings and 233 one-star rankings. , Germany had the fourth-highest number of Michelin three-star restaurants in the world, after Japan, France, and the United States.

==Hot dishes==

=== Meat ===


The average annual meat consumption is per person. The most common varieties are pork, poultry, and beef. Other varieties of meat are widely available, but are considered to be insignificant.

Meat is usually braised; fried dishes also exist, but these recipes usually originate from France and Austria. Several cooking methods used to soften tough cuts have evolved into national specialties, including &quot;Sauerbraten&quot; (sour roast), involving marinating beef, horse meat or venison in a vinegar or wine vinegar mixture over several days.

A long tradition of sausage-making exists in Germany; more than 1,500 different types of sausage () are made. Most &quot;Wurst&quot; is made with natural casings of pork, sheep or lamb intestines. Among the most popular and most common are &quot;Bratwurst&quot;, usually made of ground pork and spices, the &quot;Wiener&quot; (Viennese), which may be pork or beef and is smoked and fully cooked in a water bath, and &quot;Blutwurst&quot; (blood sausage) or &quot;Schwarzwurst&quot; (black sausage) made from blood (often of pigs or geese). Thousands of types of cold cuts also are available which are also called &quot;Wurst&quot; in German. There are many regional specialties, such as the &quot;Münchner Weißwurst&quot; (Munich white sausage) popular in Bavaria or the &quot;Currywurst&quot; (depending on region, either a steamed pork sausage or a version of the &quot;Bratwurst&quot;, sliced and spiced with curry ketchup) popular in the metropolitan areas of Berlin, Hamburg and the Ruhr Area. Strict regulations governing what may and may not be put into them have been in force in Germany since the 13th century. In the market ordinance of Landshut in 1236, it was set down that only top-quality meat could be made into sausages. Different types of sausages include also: Bierschinken, Bockwurst, Frankfurter Würstchen, Jagdwurst, Knackwurst, Liverwurst, Mettwurst, Nürnberger Bratwürste, Nürnberger Rostbratwurst, Regensburger Wurst, Saumagen, Teewurst, Thuringian sausage, Weisswurst, Westfälische Rinderwurst and Wollwurst.

Döner kebab, a dish consisting of seasoned meat cooked on a vertical rotisserie and popularized by Turkish immigrants, is one of the most popular fast food items in Germany with sales reaching more than 3.5 billion euros each year. The döner meat is typically served as a plate with rice or chips and a salad, or for a quick snack or meal it may be enjoyed in a wrap.

===Fish===

Of saltwater fish, whitefish such as Alaska pollock, Atlantic herring, Atlantic cod and saithe are the most common. Popular freshwater fish on the German menu are trout, pike, carp, and European perch also are listed frequently. These fish are often served grilled, fried as &quot;Backfisch&quot; or &quot;Fischfrikadelle&quot;, or in a soup. Seafood traditionally was restricted to the northern coastal areas, except for pickled herring, which was often served in a Fischbrötchen, as &quot;Rollmops&quot; (a pickled herring fillet rolled into a cylindrical shape around a piece of pickled gherkin or onion), or &quot;Brathering&quot; (fried, marinated herring).

Today, many sea fish, such as fresh herring, tuna, mackerel, salmon and sardines, are well established throughout the country. Prior to the industrial revolution and the ensuing pollution of the rivers, salmon were common in the rivers Rhine, Elbe, and Oder and only slowly started to return along with a growing consciousness for environmental questions and resulting measures, such as state-of-the-art sewage plant and reduction of agricultural runoff.

Fish fingers, known as Fischstäbchen (lit.: &quot;fish sticklets&quot;), are a popular processed food made using whitefish such as cod, haddock or pollock, which has been battered or breaded.

===Vegetables===
Vegetables are often used in stews or vegetable soups, but are also served as side dishes. Carrots, cauliflower, turnips, spinach, peas, beans, broccoli and many types of cabbage are very common. Fried onions are a common addition to many meat dishes throughout the country. Circa 1900, carrots were sometimes roasted in water, with the broth used in place of coffee.

Asparagus is a popular seasonal side or main dish with a yearly per-capita consumption of . The white variety is especially popular in Germany and more common than green asparagus. Restaurants will sometimes devote an entire menu to nothing but white asparagus when it is in season. Spargel season ( or &quot;Spargelsaison&quot;) traditionally begins in mid-April and ends on St. John&#x27;s Day (24 June).

==Structure of meals==
Breakfast (&quot;Frühstück,&quot; ) commonly consists of bread, toast, or bread rolls with butter or margarine, cold cuts, cheeses, jam (&quot;Konfitüre&quot; or more commonly called &quot;Marmelade&quot;), honey and eggs (typically boiled). Common drinks at breakfast are coffee, tea, milk, cocoa (hot or cold) or fruit juices. It is very common to eat hearty toppings at breakfast, including deli meats like ham, salted meats, salami and meat-based spreads such as &quot;Leberwurst&quot; (liver sausage), &quot;Teewurst&quot; or &quot;Mettwurst&quot;, and cheeses such as Gouda, &quot;Frischkäse&quot; (cream cheese), Brie, &quot;Harzer Roller&quot;, &quot;Bergkäse&quot; and more. Most bakeries tend to sell &quot;belegte Brötchen&quot; (sandwiches from bread rolls), especially in the morning, for people on the go.

Traditionally, the main meal of the day has been lunch (&quot;Mittagessen,&quot; ), eaten around noon. Dinner (&quot;Abendessen,&quot; , or &quot;Abendbrot&quot;) was always a smaller meal, often consisting only of a variety of breads, meat or sausages, cheese and some kind of vegetables, similar to breakfast, or possibly sandwiches. Smaller meals added during the day bear names such as &quot;Vesper&quot; (in the south), &quot;Brotzeit&quot; (bread time, also in the south), &quot;Kaffee und Kuchen&quot; (, literally for &quot;coffee and cake&quot;), or &quot;Kaffeetrinken&quot;. It is a very German custom and comparable with the English five-o&#x27;clock tea. It takes time between lunch and dinner, often on Sundays with the entire family.

However, in Germany, as in other parts of Europe, dining habits have changed over the last 50 years. Today, many people eat only a small meal in the middle of the day at work, often also a second breakfast, and enjoy a hot dinner in the evening at home with the whole family.

For others, the traditional way of eating is still rather common, not only in rural areas. Breakfast is still very popular and may be elaborate and extended on weekends, with friends invited as guests; the same holds for coffee and cake. Since the 1990s, the Sunday brunch has also become common, especially in city cafés.

== Side dishes ==

Noodles, made from wheat flour and egg, are usually thicker than the Italian flat pasta. Especially in the southwestern part of the country, the predominant variety of noodles are &quot;Spätzle&quot;, made with a large number of eggs, and &quot;Maultaschen&quot;, traditional stuffed noodles reminiscent of ravioli.

Besides noodles, potatoes are common. Potatoes entered the German cuisine in the late 17th century, and were almost ubiquitous in the 19th century and since. They most often are boiled (in salt water, ), but mashed ( or &quot;Kartoffelbrei&quot;) and pan-roasted potatoes () also are traditional. French fries, called , (spoken as &quot;Pom fritz&quot; or, respectively, &quot;Pommès&quot;, deviating from the French pronunciation which would be &quot;Pom freet&quot; or &quot;Pom&quot;) or regionally as in German, are a common style of fried potatoes; they are traditionally offered with either ketchup or mayonnaise, or, as (lit. fries red/white), with both.

Also common are dumplings (including &quot;Klöße&quot; as the term in the north or &quot;Knödel&quot; as the term in the south) and in southern Germany potato noodles, including &quot;Schupfnudeln&quot;, which are similar to Italian &quot;gnocchi&quot;.

Salads, also modern variations, as well as vegetarian dishes are increasingly popular in Germany.

== Spices and condiments ==

With the exception of mustard, horseradish, and hot paprika, German dishes are rarely hot and spicy. The most popular herbs and spices are traditionally anise, bay leaves, borage, caraway, chives, curry powder, dill weed, juniper berries, lovage, marjoram, paprika, and parsley. Cardamom, anise seed and cinnamon are often used in sweet cakes or beverages associated with Christmas time, and sometimes in the preparation of sausages, but are otherwise rare in German meals. Other herbs and spices, such as basil, sage, oregano, hot chili peppers, and curry powder have become popular since the early 1980s. Fresh dill is very common in a green salad or fish fillet.
Mustard (&quot;Senf&quot;) is a very common accompaniment to sausages and can vary in strength, the most common version being &quot;Mittelscharf&quot; (medium hot), which is somewhere between traditional English and French mustards in strength. Düsseldorf, similar to French&#x27;s Deli Mustard with a taste that is very different from Dijon, and the surrounding area are known for its particularly spicy mustard, which is used both as a table condiment and in local dishes such as &quot;Senfrostbraten&quot; (pot roast with mustard). In the southern parts of the country, a sweet variety of mustard is made which is almost exclusively served with the Bavarian speciality &quot;Weißwurst&quot;. German mustard is usually considerably less acidic than American varieties.

Horseradish is commonly used as a condiment either on its own served as a paste, enriched with cream (&quot;Sahnemeerrettich&quot;), or combined with mustard. In some regions of Germany, it is used with meats and sausages where mustard would otherwise be used. Its use in Germany has been documented to the 16th century, when it was used as medicine, and as a food, whereby its leaves were consumed as a vegetable.

Garlic has never played a large role in traditional German cuisine, but has risen in popularity in recent decades due to the influence of French, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, Greek, and Turkish cuisines. Ramson, a rediscovered herb from earlier centuries, has become quite popular again since the 1990s.

== Desserts ==

A wide variety of cakes, tarts and pastries are served throughout the country, most commonly made with fresh fruit. Apples, plums, strawberries, and cherries are used regularly in cakes. Cheesecake is also very popular, often made with quark. &quot;Schwarzwälder Kirschtorte&quot; (Black Forest cake, made with cherries) is probably the most well-known example of a wide variety of typically German tortes filled with whipped or butter cream.

German doughnuts (which have no hole) are usually balls of yeast dough with jam or other fillings, and are known as &quot;Berliner&quot;, &quot;Pfannkuchen&quot; (in Berlin and Eastern Germany), &quot;Kreppel&quot; or &quot;Krapfen&quot;, depending on the region. &quot;Eierkuchen&quot; or &quot;Pfannkuchen&quot; are large (usually around 20–24 cm in diameter), and relatively thin (~5mm) pancakes, comparable to the French &quot;crêpes&quot;. They are served covered with sugar, jam or syrup. Salty variants with cheese, ground meat or bacon exist as well as variants with apple slices baked in (called &quot;Apfelpfannkuchen&quot;, literally for &quot;apple pancakes&quot;), but they are usually considered to be main dishes rather than desserts. In some regions, &quot;Eierkuchen&quot; are filled and then wrapped. The word &quot;Pfannkuchen&quot; means pancake in most parts of Germany.
A popular dessert in northern Germany is &quot;Rote Grütze&quot;, red fruit pudding, which is made with black and red currants, raspberries and sometimes strawberries or cherries cooked in juice with corn starch as a thickener. It is traditionally served with cream, but also is served with vanilla sauce, milk or whipped cream. &quot;Rhabarbergrütze&quot; (rhubarb pudding) and &quot;Grüne Grütze&quot; (gooseberry fruit pudding) are variations of the &quot;Rote Grütze&quot;. A similar dish, &quot;Obstkaltschale&quot;, may also be found all around Germany.

Ice cream and sorbets are also very popular. Italian-run ice cream parlours were the first large wave of foreign-run eateries in Germany, which began around the mid-1850s, becoming widespread in the 1920s. &quot;Spaghettieis&quot;, which resembles spaghetti, tomato sauce, and ground cheese on a plate, originated in Germany and is a popular ice cream dessert.

== Holidays ==

On the Christmas Days following Christmas Eve, roast goose is a staple of Christmas Day meals. It is sometimes replaced with European carp, particularly in Southern areas. The carp is cut into pieces, coated in breadcrumbs and fried in fat. Common side dishes are potato salad, cucumber salad or potatoes.

Apart from Christmas, nearly all other Christian holidays and seasons have special dishes associated with them, varying regionally and by denomination. The Easter season, for instance, is typically associated with painted Easter eggs, &quot;Osterbrot&quot; and a meal of freshwater fish on Good Friday. Likewise, Saint Sylvester&#x27;s Day is often celebrated with a meal of carp. The fasting season, which lasts from Ash Wednesday to Easter Sunday, is observed in many areas, especially Catholic ones. The preceding carnival season is known for &quot;Berliner Pfannkuchen (German doughnuts)&quot;. The last months of the year, especially the Advent and Christmas season, is often associated with &quot;Weihnachtsgebäck&quot; (literally Christmas bakery products), which includes sweet and spicy foods like &quot;Weihnachts-/Christstollen&quot;, &quot;Lebkuchen&quot;, &quot;Spekulatius&quot;, &quot;Marzipan&quot;, &quot;Weihnachtsplätzchen&quot;, &quot;Spritzgebäck&quot;, &quot;Vanillekipferl&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Zimtsterne&quot; and &quot;Dominosteine&quot;. German supermarkets also sell these products during this period. Another popular confectioneries are &quot;Crêpe&quot;, &quot;Reibekuchen&quot; and &quot;Eier-/Pfannkuchen&quot;, which are sold in Christmas markets.

==Bread==

Bread (&quot;Brot&quot;) is a significant part of German cuisine, with the largest bread diversity in the world. Around 3,000 types of breads and 1,200 different types of pastries and rolls are produced in about 13,000 bakeries.

Bread is served usually for breakfast (often replaced by bread rolls) and in the evening as (open) sandwiches, but rarely as a side dish for the main meal (popular, for example, with &quot;Eintopf&quot; or soup). The importance of bread in German cuisine is also illustrated by words such as &quot;Abendbrot&quot; (meaning supper, literally evening bread) and &quot;Brotzeit&quot; (snack, literally bread time). In fact, one of the major complaints of the German expatriates in many parts of the world is their inability to find acceptable local breads.

Regarding bread, German cuisine is more varied than that of any other culture. Bread types range from white wheat bread (&quot;Weißbrot&quot;) to grey (&quot;Graubrot&quot;) to black (&quot;Schwarzbrot&quot;), actually dark brown rye bread. Some breads contain both wheat and rye flour (hence &quot;Mischbrot&quot;, mixed bread), and often also wholemeal and whole seeds such as linseed, sunflower seed, or pumpkin seed (&quot;Vollkornbrot&quot;). Darker, rye-dominated breads, such as &quot;Vollkornbrot&quot; or &quot;Schwarzbrot&quot;, are typical of German cuisine. &quot;Pumpernickel&quot;, sweet-tasting bread created by long-time-steaming instead of regular baking, is internationally well known, although not representative of German black bread as a whole. Most German breads are made with sourdough. Whole grain is also preferred for high fiber. Germans use almost all available types of grain for their breads: wheat, rye, barley, spelt, oats, millet, corn and rice. Some breads are even made with potato starch flour. Many breads are multigrain breads.

Among Germany&#x27;s most popular breads are spelt (&quot;Dinkelbrot&quot;), rye (&quot;Roggenbrot&quot;), rye-wheat (&quot;Roggenmischbrot&quot;), wheat-rye (&quot;Weizenmischbrot&quot;), wheat (&quot;Weißbrot&quot;), toast (&quot;Toastbrot&quot;), whole-grain (&quot;Vollkornbrot&quot;), wheat-rye-oats with sesame or linseed (&quot;Mehrkornbrot&quot;), sunflower seeds in dark rye bread (&quot;Sonnenblumenkernbrot&quot;), pumpkin seeds in dark rye bread (&quot;Kürbiskernbrot&quot;), potato bread (&quot;Kartoffelbrot&quot;) and roasted onions in light wheat-rye bread (&quot;Zwiebelbrot&quot;).

===Bread rolls===
Bread rolls, known in Germany as &quot;Brötchen&quot;, which is a diminutive of &quot;Brot&quot;, with regional linguistic varieties being &quot;Semmel&quot; (in South Germany), &quot;Schrippe&quot; (especially in Berlin), &quot;Rundstück&quot; (in the North and Hamburg) or &quot;Wecken&quot;, &quot;Weck&quot;, &quot;Weckle&quot;, &quot;Weckli&quot; and &quot;Weckla&quot; (in Baden-Württemberg, Switzerland, parts of Southern Hesse and northern Bavaria), are common in German cuisine. A typical serving is a roll cut in half, and spread with butter or margarine. Cheese, honey, jam, Nutella, cold cuts such as ham, fish, or preserves are then placed between the two halves, or on each half separately, known as a &quot;belegtes Brötchen&quot;.

Rolls are also used for snacks, or as a hotdog-style roll for &quot;Bratwurst, Brätel, Fleischkäse&quot; or &quot;Schwenker&quot;/&quot;Schwenkbraten&quot;.

&quot;Franzbrötchen&quot;, which originated in the area of Hamburg, is a small, sweet pastry roll baked with butter and cinnamon.

==Beverages==

===Alcoholic drinks===
Beer is very common throughout all parts of Germany, with many local and regional breweries producing a wide variety of beers. The pale lager pilsner, a style developed in the mid-19th century, is predominant in most parts of the country today, whereas wheat beer (&quot;Weißbier&quot;/&quot;Weizen&quot;) and other types of lager are common, especially in Bavaria. A number of regions have local specialties, many of which, like &quot;Weißbier&quot;, are more traditionally brewed ales. Among these are &quot;Altbier&quot;, a dark beer available around Düsseldorf and the lower Rhine, &quot;Kölsch&quot;, a similar style, but light in color, in the Cologne area, and the low-alcohol &quot;Berliner Weiße&quot;, a sour beer made in Berlin that is often mixed with raspberry or woodruff syrup. Since the reunification of 1990, &quot;Schwarzbier&quot;, which was common in East Germany, but could hardly be found in West Germany, has become increasingly popular in Germany as a whole. Beer may also be mixed with other beverages such as pils or lager and carbonated lemonade: &quot;Radler&quot; (lit: cyclist), &quot;Alsterwasser&quot; (lit: water from the river Alster).

Since a beer tax law was changed in 1993, many breweries served this trend of mixing beer with other drinks by selling bottles of pre-mixed beverages. Examples are &quot;Bibob&quot; (by Köstritzer), &quot;Veltins V+&quot;, &quot;Mixery&quot; (by Karlsberg), Dimix (by Diebels) and &quot;Cab&quot; (by Krombacher).

Cider is also popular in Germany. It is called &quot;Most&quot; or &quot;Ebbelwoi&quot;. In Hessen, people drink it from a traditional type of pitcher called a Bembel.

Wine is also popular throughout the country. German wine comes predominantly from the areas along the upper and middle Rhine and its tributaries. Riesling and Silvaner are among the best-known varieties of white wine, while Spätburgunder and Dornfelder are important German red wines. The sweet German wines sold in English-speaking countries seem mostly to cater to the foreign market, as they are rare in Germany.

&quot;Korn&quot;, a German spirit made from malt (wheat, rye or barley), is consumed predominantly in the middle and northern parts of Germany. &quot;Obstler&quot;, on the other hand, distilled from apples and pears, plums, cherries (&quot;Kirschwasser&quot;), or mirabelle plums, is preferred in the southern parts. The term &quot;Schnaps&quot; refers to both kinds of hard liquors.

All cold drinks in bars and restaurants are sold in glasses with a calibration mark (&quot;Eichstrich&quot;) that is frequently checked by the &quot;Eichamt&quot; (~ Bureau of Weights and Measures) to ensure the guest is getting as much as is offered in the menu.

===Non-alcoholic drinks===

Coffee is very common, not only for breakfast, but also accompanying a piece of cake (&quot;Kaffee und Kuchen&quot;) in the afternoon, usually on Sundays or special occasions and birthdays. It is generally filter coffee, which is weaker than espresso. Coffeeshops are also very common in Germany. Tea is more common in the northwest. East Frisians traditionally have their tea with cream and rock candy (&quot;Kluntje&quot;). Germany has the tenth highest per capita coffee consumption worldwide.
Johann Jacob Schweppe was a German-Swiss watchmaker and amateur scientist, who developed the first practical process to manufacture bottled carbonated mineral water and began selling the world&#x27;s first soft drink under his company Schweppes. Popular soft drinks include &quot;Schorle&quot;, juice or wine mixed with sparkling mineral water, with &quot;Apfelschorle&quot; being popular all over Germany, and &quot;Spezi&quot;, made with cola and an orange-flavored drink such as Fanta. Germans are unique among their neighbors in preferring bottled, carbonated mineral water, either plain (&quot;Sprudel&quot;) or flavored (usually lemon) to noncarbonated ones.

Drinking water of excellent quality is available everywhere and at any time in Germany. Water provided by the public water utilities can be had without hesitation directly from the tap. Usually, no chlorine is added. Drinking water is controlled by state authority to ensure it is potable. Regulations are even stricter than those for bottled water (see Trinkwasserverordnung).

==Regional cuisine==
German regional cuisine can be divided into many varieties such as Bavarian cuisine (southern Germany) or Thuringian (central Germany) and Lower Saxon cuisine (northern Germany).

===Baden-Württemberg===
This southwest German state is divided into Baden and Swabia, whose cuisines are slightly different.
Due to Baden&#x27;s physiogeographical situation in the Upper Rhine Plain, with Germany&#x27;s warmest climate and fruitful volcanic soils, it had good prerequisites to develop a high-quality gastronomy. Nationwide, this region features the highest density of star-rated restaurants; the municipality of Baiersbronn is especially well known for its fine-dining restaurants. Swabian cuisine tends to be heavier than Badish cuisine. Famous dishes of Baden-Württemberg are Maultaschen, Spätzle and Black Forest cake.

===Bavaria===
The Bavarian dukes, especially the Wittelsbach family, developed Bavarian cuisine and refined it to be presentable to the royal court. This cuisine has belonged to wealthy households, especially in cities, since the 19th century. The (old) Bavarian cuisine is closely connected to Czech cuisine and Austrian cuisine (especially from Tyrol and Salzburg), mainly through the Wittelsbach and Habsburg families. Already in the beginning, Bavarians were closely connected to their neighbours in Austria through linguistic, cultural and political similarities, which also reflected on the cuisine.

A characteristic Bavarian cuisine was further developed by both groups, with a distinct similarity to Franconian and Swabian cuisine. A Bavarian speciality is the Brotzeit, a savoury snack, which would originally be eaten between breakfast and lunch.

Bavaria is a part of Southeastern Germany, including the city of Munich and spreading to Germany&#x27;s borders with Austria and the Czech Republic. The region is located at higher elevations, and is known for yielding beet and potato crops and also for the production of fine beers.

===Franconia===

Franconia, a major region consisting roughly of the northern half of Bavaria, has its own distinct cuisine, so distinct in fact that there is said to be a &quot;White Sausage Equator&quot; (&quot;Weißwurstäquator&quot;) that separates Franconia from the rest of Bavaria. This is a reference to the fact that those north of the Weißwurstequator do not generally eat the popular Weißwurst common in southern Bavaria. A characteristic of Franconian food would include gravies (Soßen), food derived from potatoes, various meats, and, of course, bread. Franconia is well known throughout Germany for its heavy foods covered in gravy. A good example of Franconian food would be Schäufele and Klöße, which is a pork shoulder served with traditional potato dumplings (Klöße or Knödel) covered in a gravy.

===Hamburg===
Due to its centuries-old history as a harbour town, the traditional cuisine of Hamburg is very diversified and sapid as the supply of ingredients was safe. Until the 20th century, it was predominantly characterized by the extensive choice of different kinds of fish from the river Elbe and the quick access to both the North Sea and the Baltic Sea, both being roughly 100 kilometers away from the city center. The neighboring regions supplied the city state with fresh vegetables, fruit came mainly from a region called Altes Land just southwest of Hamburg and until industrialization, the neighbourhood of Wilhelmsburg was considered the ‘milk isle’ of Hamburg.

International trade made spices and exotic food items from Asia and South America available since the 16th century, and these were soon incorporated into civic kitchens. From this basis, the cuisine of Hamburg developed its current characteristics thanks to the supraregional harmonization of the Northern German and Scandinavian cuisine. Due to its high economic importance, Hamburg features many internationally recognized gourmet restaurants: 11 of them were awarded a Michelin star in 2010.

===Lower Saxony===

Lower Saxon cuisine () covers a range of regional, North German culinary traditions from the region correspondingly broadly to the state of Lower Saxony, which in many cases are very similar to one another, for example cuisine from the areas of Oldenburg, Brunswick, or East Frisia.

It is mainly indigenous and in some cases very hearty, with many cultural dishes including poultry, venison, turkey, and vegetables. Many other recipes also include potatoes, asparagus and North Sea fish, all of which are harvested in the region.

===Pomerania===
Pomeranian cuisine generally refers to dishes typical of the area that once formed the historic Province of Pomerania in northeast Germany and which included Stettin (now Szczecin) and Further Pomerania. It is characterised by ingredients produced by Pomeranian farms, such as swede (&quot;Wruken&quot;) and sugar beet, by poultry rearing, which has produced the famous Pomeranian goose, by the wealth of fish in the Baltic Sea, rivers and inland lakes of the Pomeranian Lake District, and the abundance of quarry in Pomeranian forests. Pomeranian cuisine is hearty. Several foodstuffs have a particularly important role to play here in the region: potatoes, known as &quot;Tüften&quot;, prepared in various ways and whose significance is evinced by the existence of a West Pomeranian Potato Museum (&quot;Vorpommersches Kartoffelmuseum&quot;), &quot;Grünkohl&quot; and sweet and sour dishes produced, for example, by baking fruit.

Pomeranian farmers were self-sufficient: crops were stored until the following harvest, meat products were preserved in the smoke store of the home, or in the smokeries of larger villages such as Schlawin. Fruit, vegetables, lard and &quot;Gänseflomen&quot; were preserved by bottling in jars. Syrup was made from the sugar beet itself.

===Hessen===

Typical for Hessen are &quot;Frankfurter Rippchen&quot;, a spiked pork cutlet, which is often served with sauerkraut and mashed potatoes.

Also from Hessen comes the Frankfurt green sauce (&quot;Grüne Sauce&quot;). It is a cold sauce based on sour cream with the local herbs borage, chervil, cress, parsley, pimpinelle, sorrel and chives. The start of the season is traditionally Maundy Thursday (&quot;Gründonnerstag&quot;; which means &quot;green Thursday&quot; in German). Green sauce is mostly served with potatoes and boiled eggs.

One of the best-known specialties from Hesse is the Frankfurter Kranz, a buttercream cake whose shape is reminiscent of a crown, a reminiscence of Frankfurt as the historical coronation city of the German emperors.

Cider (&quot;Apfelwein&quot; in German, or &quot;Äppelwoi&quot; in the Hessian dialect) is also very popular in and around Frankfurt. In the historic district Sachsenhausen there is the so-called Cider Quarter (&quot;Äppelwoiviertel&quot;), where there are numerous taverns that offer cider, especially in the summer months. In the cider taverns, &quot;&quot;Handkäs mit Musik&quot;&quot; is offered as a snack, a sour milk cheese served in a marinade of onions, vinegar and spices.

===Palatinate/Pfalz===
The kitchen of the Palatinate, a region in the south of Rhineland-Palatinate, is largely determined by regional dishes. They are sometimes quite hearty, not least because the cooking recipes were sometimes developed in times of need or in the context of heavy physical work.

Probably the best-known dish is the Pfälzer Saumagen, a pork stomach stuffed with sausage meat, bacon, potatoes and spices. The dish became famous as the favorite meal of Federal Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who especially enjoyed serving this dish at state receptions.

In the Palatinate, the salty-crust Dampfnudel is a traditional main dish, either with sweet side dishes (for example wine sauce, custard or boiled fruit such as plums, pears or the like) or with salty side dishes (for example potato soup, vegetable soups, goulash or pork) is eaten.

===Thuringia===

Wheat, grapes, sugarbeets, and barley grow well, along with a variety of vegetables, which grow near Erfurt, the state&#x27;s capital. Cauliflower [], cabbage (savoy, red, white) [], kohlrabi [], and broccoli [] grow by traditional means near Erfurt. Tomatoes, lettuce, broad beans, onions, and cucumbers are grown in the eastern portion of the region near Jena under glass centers on about of land. Thuringia is the second-largest herb-growing region in Germany; the town of Kölleda was once considered the &quot;peppermint town&quot;, where herb growers used to congregate to study herb cultivation.

One-third of Thuringia is covered in forest, and is considered to be one of the best game-hunting regions in Germany. Anyone holding a valid hunting license and a local hunting permit for the area may hunt for game such as red deer, roe deer, wild boar, rabbit, duck, and mouflon (mountain sheep). Pheasant and capercaillie are protected game species that may not be hunted. The wooded areas also contain a wide variety of edible mushrooms, such as chestnut mushrooms, porcini, and chanterelles, along with wild berries, such as blueberries, lingonberries, raspberries, and blackberries, which are all traditional accompaniments to game dishes.

The most famous foods from Thuringia are Thuringian sausages and Thuringian dumplings. The state is also known for its sausages; steamed, scaled, and cured varieties are all prepared. Popular varieties include Thüringer &quot;Mettwurst&quot; (a spreadable cured sausage), &quot;Feldkieker&quot; (a cured, air-dried sausage dried up to eight months), Thüringer &quot;Leberwurst&quot; (a steamed pork and liver sausage), Thüringer &quot;Rotwurst&quot; (a steamed blood sausage packed in a bladder or other natural casing) and &quot;Mett&quot; (minced pork).

===Saxony===

In general, the cuisine is very hearty and features many peculiarities of central Germany such as a great variety of sauces which accompany the main dish and the fashion to serve &quot;Klöße&quot; or Knödel as a side dish instead of potatoes, pasta or rice. A typical meal is Sächsischer Sauerbraten. Also much freshwater fish is used in Saxon cuisine, particularly carp and trout as is the case throughout Central and Eastern Europe.

The rich history of the region did and still does influence the cuisine. In the blossoming and growing cities of Dresden and Leipzig an extravagant style of cuisine is cherished (one may only think of the crab as an ingredient in the famous Leipziger Allerlei). In other, impoverished regions where the people had to work hard to yield some harvest (e.g., the Ore Mountains), peasant dishes play a major role; famous dishes originating from there include potatoes with Quark, potato soup or potato with bread and linseed oil. In the Vogtland region, where the peasants were wealthier, the tradition of Sunday roast remains to this day. Typical sweets at Christmas are Pulsnitzer Lebkuchen, Dresdner or Erzgebirgsstollen and Liegnitzer Bombe.

Cereal grain cultivation occupies 62% of the cultivated land in Saxony-Anhalt. Wheat, barley, oats, and rye are grown, with the rye being grown near Borde, where it is used to make &quot;Burger Knäckebrot&quot;, a flatbread produced there since 1931. Another 10% of the cultivated area is planted in sugar beets for conversion to sugar, popularized after the 19th century, when the region had an economic boom.

== International influences ==
===German cuisine in other countries===
German-Brazil cuisine brought new types of food and beverage in Brazil or reinforced their utilizations by Brazilians. The wheat culture in Brazil arrived by German immigrants.

Kuchen, Sauerkraut (known in Portuguese as &quot;chucrute&quot;, is also used as derogatory term to designate Germans, and people of Central European origin or descent in general), Eisbein, new types of sausage and vegetables are some examples of food introduced in Brazil by the immigrants. In Curitiba, sausage are commonly known as vina, from the German &quot;Wiener&quot; (Wiener Würstchen). In Southern Brazil, Fruit preserves are known as chimia, from the German &quot;Schmier&quot;.

Chopp or Chope (from German &quot;Schoppen&quot;) in Brazilian Portuguese is the word for draught beer or just beer. Today, beer is the most consumed beverage in Brazil.
The tradition of brewing in Brazil dates back to German immigration in the early 19th century. The first breweries date from the 1830s, although the brand Bohemia is claimed to be the first Brazilian beer, with production starting in 1853 in the city of Petrópolis founded by the German-Brazilian Henrique Kremer. In 1913 there were 134 breweries in Rio Grande do Sul. Brahma was founded in 1888 in Rio de Janeiro by the Swiss immigrant Joseph Villiger. Antarctica (Companhia Antarctica Paulista) was founded in the same year by the Brazilian Joaquim Salles and the German immigrant Louis Bücher in São Paulo. In 1999 the two brands merged creating AmBev.

German-Argentinien cuisine is a noticeable part of Argentine cuisine; the &quot;Achtzig Schlag&quot; cake, which was translated as &quot;Torta Ochenta Golpes&quot; in the country, can be found in some bakeries. In addition, dishes like chucrut (sauerkraut) and many different kinds of sausage-like bratwurst and others have also made it into mainstream Argentine cuisine.

German-Americans introduced popular foods such as hot dogs and hamburgers to America. They also introduced America to lager, the most-produced beer style in the United States, and have been the dominant ethnic group in the beer industry since 1850.

The German founded Tsingtao Brewery is China&#x27;s second largest brewery, with about 15% of domestic market share and also accounts for half of China&#x27;s national beer exports.

===Influence of immigration to German cuisine===
Elements of international cuisine (apart from influences from neighbouring countries) are a relatively recent phenomenon in German cuisine, compared with other West European states. Colonial goods shops spread only in the 19th and early 20th centuries and brought luxury goods like cocoa, coconuts, rare exotic spices, coffee and (non-herbal) tea to a wider audience.

The first wave of foreigners coming to Germany specifically to sell their food specialties were ice cream makers from northern Italy, who started to arrive in noticeable numbers during the late 1920s. With the post-World War II contacts with Allied occupation troops, and especially with the influx of more and more foreign workers that began during the second half of the 1950s, many foreign dishes have been adopted into German cuisine — Italian dishes, such as spaghetti and pizza, have become staples of the German diet. In 2008, there were around 9,000 pizzerias and 7,000 Italian restaurants in Germany. The pizza is Germany&#x27;s favourite fast food.

Turkish immigrants have introduced Turkish foods to Germany, notably &quot;döner kebab&quot;. In November 2017, it was estimated that 1,500 döner kebab shops were present in Berlin and in circa 16,000 in whole Germany.

Arab (mostly Syrian, Lebanese or Moroccan), Chinese, Balkan, Japanese (especially Sushi) and Greek (especially Gyros) restaurants and bars are also widespread in Germany.
Indian (especially Curry dishes), Vietnamese, Thai, and other Asian cuisines are rapidly gaining in popularity since the early 2000s. Until the late 1990s many of the more expensive restaurants served mostly French inspired dishes for decades. Since the end of the 1990s, they have been shifting to a more refined form of German cuisine.

Before 1990, the cuisine from East Germany (1949–1990) was influenced by those of other nations within the former Communist bloc. East Germans traveled abroad to these countries on holiday (and vice versa as well), and soldiers coming to East Germany from these countries brought their dishes with them. A typical dish that came to the East German kitchen this way is Russian &quot;Soljanka&quot;.

== Food industry ==
Germany is the third largest agricultural producer in the European Union and the third largest agricultural exporter in the world. In 2013, German food exports were worth around EUR 66 billion. Several food products are internationally known brands. Aldi and Schwarz Gruppe are Europe&#x27;s largest retailers.

<text>Greek cuisine is the cuisine of Greece and the Greek diaspora. In common with many other cuisines of the Mediterranean, it is founded on the triad of wheat, olive oil, and wine. It uses vegetables, olive oil, grains, fish, and meat, including pork, poultry, veal and beef, lamb, rabbit, and goat. Other important ingredients include pasta (for example hilopites), cheeses, herbs, lemon juice, olives and olive oil, and yogurt. Bread made of wheat is ubiquitous; other grains, notably barley, are also used, especially for paximathia. Common dessert ingredients include nuts, honey, fruits, sesame, and filo pastries. It continues traditions from Ancient Greek and Byzantine cuisine, while incorporating Asian, Turkish, Balkan, and Italian influences. 
 


==History==

Greek cuisine is part of the culture of Greece and is recorded in images and texts from ancient times. Its influence spread to ancient Rome and then throughout Europe and beyond.

Ancient Greek cuisine was characterized by its frugality and was founded on the &quot;Mediterranean triad&quot;: wheat, olive oil, and wine, with meat being rarely eaten and fish being more common. This trend in Greek diet continued in Cyprus and changed only fairly recently when technological progress has made meat more available. Wine and olive oil have always been a central part of it and the spread of grapes and olive trees in the Mediterranean and further afield is correlated with Greek colonization.

The Spartan diet was also marked by its frugality. A notorious staple of the Spartan diet was &quot;melas zomos&quot; (black soup), made by boiling the pigs&#x27; legs, blood of pigs, olive oil, bay leaf, chopped onion, salt, water, and vinegar as an emulsifier to keep the blood from coagulation during the cooking process. The army of Sparta mainly ate this as part of their subsistence diet. This dish was noted by the Spartans&#x27; Greek contemporaries, particularly Athenians and Corinthians, as proof of the Spartans&#x27; different way of living.

Byzantine cuisine was similar to ancient cuisine, with the addition of new ingredients, such as caviar, nutmeg and basil. Lemons, prominent in Greek cuisine and introduced in the second century, were used medicinally before being incorporated into the diet. Fish continued to be an integral part of the diet for coastal dwellers. Culinary advice was influenced by the theory of humors, first put forth by the ancient Greek doctor Claudius Aelius Galenus. Byzantine cuisine benefited from Constantinople&#x27;s position as a global hub of the spice trade.

==Overview== 
The most characteristic and ancient element of Greek cuisine is olive oil, which is used in most dishes. It is produced from the olive trees prominent throughout the region, and adds to the distinctive taste of Greek food. The olives themselves are also widely eaten. The basic grain in Greece is wheat, though barley is also grown. Important vegetables include tomato, aubergine (eggplant), potato, green beans, okra, green peppers (capsicum), and onions. Honey in Greece is mainly honey from the nectar of fruit trees and citrus trees: lemon, orange, bigarade (bitter orange) trees, thyme honey, and pine honey. Mastic, an aromatic, ivory-coloured plant resin, is grown on the Aegean island of Chios.

Greek cuisine uses some flavorings more often than other Mediterranean cuisines do, namely oregano, mint, garlic, onion, dill, cumin, and bay laurel leaves. Other common herbs and spices include basil, thyme and fennel seed. Parsley is also used as a garnish on some dishes. Many Greek recipes, especially in the northern parts of the country, use &quot;sweet&quot; spices in combination with meat, for example cinnamon, allspice and cloves in stews.

The climate and terrain has tended to favour the breeding of goats and sheep over cattle, and thus beef dishes are uncommon. Fish dishes are common in coastal regions and on the islands. A great variety of cheese types are used in Greek cuisine, including &quot;Feta&quot;, &quot;Kasseri&quot;, &quot;Kefalotyri&quot;, &quot;Graviera&quot;, &quot;Anthotyros&quot;, &quot;Manouri&quot;, &quot;Metsovone&quot;, &quot;Ladotyri&quot; (cheese with olive oil), &quot;Kalathaki&quot; (a specialty from the island of Limnos), &quot;Katiki Domokou&quot; (creamy cheese, suitable for spreads), &quot;Mizithra&quot; and many more.

Dining out is common in Greece. The &quot;taverna&quot; and &quot;estiatorio&quot; are widespread, serving home cooking at affordable prices to both locals and tourists. Locals still largely eat Greek cuisine. 

Common street foods include souvlaki, gyros, various pitas and roast corn. 

Fast food became popular in the 1970s, with some chains, such as Goody&#x27;s and McDonald&#x27;s serving international food like hamburgers, and others serving Greek foods such as souvlaki, gyros, tiropita, and spanakopita. 

Since 2013, Greece for its Mediterranean diet has been added to the UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists.

==Origins== 
Many dishes can be traced back to ancient Greece: lentil soup, fasolada (though the modern version is made with white beans and tomatoes, both New World plants), tiganites, retsina (white or rosé wine flavored with pine resin) and pasteli (baked sesame-honey bar); some to the Hellenistic and Roman periods: loukaniko (dried pork sausage); and Byzantium: feta cheese, avgotaraho (cured fish roe), moustalevria and paximadi (traditional hard bread baked from wheat, barley and rye). There are also many ancient and Byzantine dishes which are no longer consumed: porridge (&quot;chilós&quot; in Greek) as the main staple, fish sauce (&quot;garos&quot;), and salt water mixed into wine.

Some dishes are borrowed from Italian and adapted to Greek tastes: pastitsio (&quot;pasticcio&quot;), pastitsada (&quot;pasticciata&quot;), stifado (&quot;stufato&quot;), salami, macaronia, mandolato, and more.

Some Greek dishes are inherited from Ottoman cuisine, which combined influences from Persian, Levantine, Arabian, Turkish and Byzantine cuisines: meze, kadaifi, halva, and loukoumi.

In the 20th century, French cuisine had a major influence on Greek cooking, largely due to the French-trained chef Nikolaos Tselementes, who created the modern Greek pastitsio; he also created the modern Greek version of moussaka by combining an existing eggplant dish with a French-style gratin topping. Greek chef Zisis Kerameas has recognized for his contribution to Greek cuisine and as culinary arts teacher (1970–2000) at public vocational tourism professions schools.

==Regions==
Distinct from the mainstream regional cuisines are: 
* &quot;Cuisine of the Aegean islands&quot; (including &quot;Kykladítiki&quot; from Kyklades, &quot;Rhodítiki&quot; from Rhodes and other Dodecanese islands, and the &quot;Cuisine of Lesbos island&quot;). 
* Cuisine of Argolis, Cuisine of Patras, Arcadian and Maniot cuisines, parts of the &quot;Cuisine of Peloponnesean&quot;.

Some ethnic minorities living in Greece also have their own cuisine. One example is the Aromanians and their Aromanian cuisine.

==Typical dishes==
Typical home-cooked meals include seasonal vegetables stewed with olive oil, herbs, and tomato sauce known as &quot;lathera&quot;. Vegetables used in these dishes include green beans, peas, okra, cauliflower, spinach, leeks and others.

They have countless variations of pitas (savory pies). 

Apart from the Greek dishes that can be found all over Greece, there are also many regional dishes.

North-Western and Central Greece (Epirus, Thessaly and Roumeli/Central Greece) have a strong tradition of filo-based dishes, such as some special regional pitas.

Greek cuisine uses seeds and nuts in everything from pastry to main dishes.

A typical Greek-style breakfast, and brunch, consists of Greek coffee, frappé coffee, mountain tea, hot milk, fruit juice, rusks, bread, butter, honey, jam, fresh fruits, koulouri (sesame bread ring, a type of simit), Greek strained yogurt, bougatsa, tiropita, spanakopita, boiled eggs, fried eggs, omelette, strapatsada, piroski, croissant, tsoureki. A popular meal for breakfast is bougatsa provided mainly by &quot;bougatsadika&quot; shops selling bougatsa, pies, pastries, beverages. Traditional Greek breakfast was also providing in special dairy shops called &quot;galaktopoleia&quot; (milk shops) have dairy products, milk, butter, yoghurt, sweets, honey, beverages, whereas today &quot;galaktopoleia&quot; shops exist very few.

<doc id="12490" wikidata="Q107388" url="?curid=12490" title="Gospel of Mark">
<text>The Gospel of Mark is the second of the four canonical Gospels and one of the three synoptic Gospels. It tells of the ministry of Jesus from his baptism by John the Baptist to his death, the burial of his body, and the discovery of his empty tomb. It portrays Jesus as a teacher, an exorcist, a healer, and a miracle worker, though it does not mention a miraculous birth or divine pre-existence. Jesus refers to himself as the Son of Man. He is called the Son of God but keeps his messianic nature secret; even his disciples fail to understand him. All this is in keeping with the Christian interpretation of prophecy, which is believed to foretell the fate of the messiah as a suffering servant.

Most scholars date Mark to closely after AD 70. They reject the traditional ascription to Mark the Evangelist, the companion of the Apostle Peter, which probably arose from the desire of early Christians to link the work to an authoritative figure, and believe it to be the work of an author working with various sources including collections of miracle stories, controversy stories, parables, and a passion narrative. It was traditionally placed second, and sometimes fourth, in the Christian canon, as an inferior abridgement of what was regarded as the most important gospel, Matthew. The Church has consequently derived its view of Jesus primarily from Matthew, secondarily from John, and only distantly from Mark. It was only in the 19th century that Mark came to be seen as the earliest of the four gospels, and as a source used by both Matthew and Luke. The hypothesis of Marcan priority (that Mark was written first) continues to be held by the majority of scholars today, and there is a new recognition of the author as an artist and theologian using a range of literary devices to convey his conception of Jesus as the authoritative yet suffering Son of God.

==Composition==

===Authorship and date===
An early Christian tradition deriving from Papias of Hierapolis (c.60–c.130 AD) regards the Gospel as being based on the preaching of Saint Peter, as recorded by John Mark, who is mentioned in the Acts of the Apostles as a companion and interpreter of Peter. Most scholars argue that it was written anonymously, and that the name of Mark was attached to it to link it to an authoritative figure, according to Adela Yarbro Collins already early on, and not in a later stage of the early Church history. Helen Bond also argues that the name goes back to the earliest period of circulation and claims that the Gospel was written by somebody named Mark. Gerd Theissen also argues for homonimity. It is usually dated through the eschatological discourse in Mark 13, which scholars interpret as pointing to the First Jewish–Roman War (66–74 AD)—a war that led to the destruction of the Second Temple in AD 70. This would place the composition of Mark either immediately after the destruction or during the years immediately prior. Most scholars place Mark during the buildup of the First Jewish-Roman War (65-70 CE), while a plurality date it shortly afterwards (71-75 CE). The dating around 70 AD is not dependent on the naturalistic argument that Jesus could not have made an accurate prophecy; scholars like Michael Barber and Amy-Jill Levine argue the Historical Jesus predicted the destruction of the Temple. Whether the Gospels were composed before or after 70 AD, according to Bas van Os, the lifetime of various eyewitnesses that includes Jesus&#x27;s own family through the end of the First Century is very likely statistically. Markus Bockmuehl finds this structure of lifetime memory in various early Christian traditions. The author used a variety of pre-existing sources, such as the conflict stories which appear in Mark 2:1-3:6, apocalyptic discourse such as Mark 13:1–37, miracle stories, parables, a passion narrative, and collections of sayings, although not the hypothesized Q source. While Werner Kelber in his media contrast model argued that the transition from oral sources to the written Gospel of Mark represented a major break in transmission, going as far to claim that the latter tried to stifle the former, James DG Dunn argues that such distinctions are greatly exaggerated and that Mark largely preserved the Jesus tradition back to his lifetime. Rafael Rodriguez too is critical of Kelber&#x27;s divide.

===Setting===
The Gospel of Mark was written in Greek, for a gentile audience, and probably in Rome, although Galilee, Antioch (third-largest city in the Roman Empire, located in northern Syria), and southern Syria have also been suggested. Theologian and former Archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams proposed that Libya was a possible setting, as it was the location of Cyrene and there is a long-held Arabic tradition of Mark&#x27;s residence there.

The consensus among modern scholars is that the gospels are a subset of the ancient genre of , or ancient biography. Ancient biographies were concerned with providing examples for readers to emulate while preserving and promoting the subject&#x27;s reputation and memory, and also included morals and rhetoric in their works. Like all the synoptic gospels, the purpose of writing was to strengthen the faith of those who already believed, as opposed to serving as a tractate for missionary conversion. Christian churches were small communities of believers, often based on households (an autocratic patriarch plus extended family, slaves, freedmen, and other clients), and the evangelists often wrote on two levels: one the &quot;historical&quot; presentation of the story of Jesus, the other dealing with the concerns of the author&#x27;s own day. Thus the proclamation of Jesus in Mark 1:14 and the following verses, for example, mixes the terms Jesus would have used as a 1st-century Jew (&quot;kingdom of God&quot;) and those of the early church (&quot;believe&quot;, &quot;gospel&quot;).

Christianity began within Judaism, with a Christian &quot;church&quot; (or , , meaning &#x27;assembly&#x27;) that arose shortly after Jesus&#x27;s death when some of his followers claimed to have witnessed him risen from the dead. From the outset, Christians depended heavily on Jewish literature, supporting their convictions through the Jewish scriptures. Those convictions involved a nucleus of key concepts: the messiah, the son of God and the son of man, the suffering servant, the Day of the Lord, and the kingdom of God. Uniting these ideas was the common thread of apocalyptic expectation: Both Jews and Christians believed that the end of history was at hand, that God would very soon come to punish their enemies and establish his own rule, and that they were at the centre of his plans. Christians read the Jewish scripture as a figure or type of Jesus Christ, so that the goal of Christian literature became an experience of the living Christ. The new movement spread around the eastern Mediterranean and to Rome and further west, and assumed a distinct identity, although the groups within it remained extremely diverse.

===Synoptic problem===

The gospels of Matthew, Mark and Luke bear a striking resemblance to each other, so much so that their contents can easily be set side by side in parallel columns. The fact that they share so much material verbatim and yet also exhibit important differences has led to several hypotheses explaining their interdependence, a phenomenon termed the synoptic problem.

Up until the 19th century, the gospel of Mark was traditionally placed second, and sometimes fourth, in the Christian canon, and was believed to be an abridgement of Matthew. The Church has consequently derived its view of Jesus primarily from Matthew, secondarily from John, and only distantly from Mark. However, in the 19th century, a theory was developed known as Marcan priority, which held that Mark was the first of the four gospels written. In this view, Mark was a source used by both Matthew and Luke, who agree with each other in their sequence of stories and events only when they also agree with Mark. The hypothesis of Marcan priority is held by the majority of scholars today, and there is a new recognition of the author as an artist and theologian using a range of literary devices to convey his conception of Jesus as the authoritative yet suffering Son of God.

===Historicity===

The idea of Marcan priority first gained widespread acceptance during the 19th century. From this position, it was generally assumed that Mark&#x27;s provenance meant that it was the most reliable of the four gospels as a source for facts about the historical Jesus. However, the conceit that Mark could be used to reconstruct the historical Jesus suffered two severe blows in the early 20th century. Firstly, in 1901 William Wrede put forward an argument that the &quot;Messianic Secret&quot; motif within Mark had actually been a creation of the early church instead of a reflection of the historical Jesus. In 1919, Karl Ludwig Schmidt argued that the links between episodes in Mark were a literary invention of the author, meaning that the text could not be used as evidence in attempts to reconstruct the chronology of Jesus&#x27; mission. The latter half of the 20th century saw a consensus emerge among scholars that the author of Mark had primarily intended to announce a message rather than to report history. Nonetheless, Mark is generally seen as the most reliable of the four gospels in its overall description of Jesus&#x27; life and ministry. Michael Patrick Barber has challenged the prevailing view, arguing that &quot;Matthew&#x27;s overall portrait presents us with a historically plausible picture...&quot; of the Historical Jesus. Dale Allison had already argued that the Gospel of Matthew is more accurate than Mark in several regards, but was finally convinced by Barber&#x27;s work to no longer regard the &quot;uniquely Matthean&quot; materials as ahistorical, declaring that the Historical Jesus &quot;is not buried beneath Matthew but stares at us from its surface&quot;. Matthew Thiessen wholeheartedly agrees as well, finding no fault in Barber&#x27;s work.

===Structure===
There is no agreement on the structure of Mark. There is, however, a widely recognised break at Mark 8:26–31: before 8:26 there are numerous miracle stories, the action is in Galilee, and Jesus preaches to the crowds, while after 8:31 there are hardly any miracles, the action shifts from Galilee to gentile areas or hostile Judea, and Jesus teaches the disciples. Peter&#x27;s confession at Mark 8:27–30 that Jesus is the messiah thus forms the watershed to the whole gospel. A further generally recognised turning point comes at the end of chapter 10, when Jesus and his followers arrive in Jerusalem and the foreseen confrontation with the Temple authorities begins, leading R.T. France to characterise Mark as a three-act drama. James Edwards in his 2002 commentary points out that the gospel can be seen as a series of questions asking first who Jesus is (the answer being that he is the messiah), then what form his mission takes (a mission of suffering culminating in the crucifixion and resurrection, events only to be understood when the questions are answered), while another scholar, C. Myers, has made what Edwards calls a &quot;compelling case&quot; for recognising the incidents of Jesus&#x27; baptism, transfiguration and crucifixion, at the beginning, middle and end of the gospel, as three key moments, each with common elements, and each portrayed in an apocalyptic light. Stephen H. Smith has made the point that the structure of Mark is similar to the structure of a Greek tragedy.

===Content===
* Jesus is first announced as the Messiah and then later as the Son of God; he is baptised by John and a heavenly voice announces him as the Son of God; he is tested in the wilderness by Satan; John is arrested, and Jesus begins to preach the good news of the kingdom of God.
* Jesus gathers his disciples; he begins teaching, driving out demons, healing the sick, cleansing lepers, raising the dead, feeding the hungry, and giving sight to the blind; he delivers a long discourse in parables to the crowd, intended for the disciples, but they fail to understand; he performs mighty works, calming the storm and walking on water, but while God and demons recognise him, neither the crowds nor the disciples grasp his identity. He also has several run-ins with Jewish lawkeepers, especially in chapters 2–3.
* Jesus asks the disciples who people say he is, and then, &quot;but you, who do you say I am?&quot; Peter answers that he is the Christ, and Jesus commands him to silence; Jesus explains that the Son of Man must go to Jerusalem and be killed, but will rise again; Moses and Elijah appear with Jesus and God tells the disciples, &quot;This is my son,&quot; but they remain uncomprehending.
* Jesus goes to Jerusalem, where he is hailed as one who &quot;comes in the name of the Lord&quot; and will inaugurate the &quot;kingdom of David&quot;; he drives those who buy and sell animals from the Temple and debates with the Jewish authorities; on the Mount of Olives he announces the coming destruction of the Temple, the persecution of his followers, and the coming of the Son of Man in power and glory.
* A woman perfumes Jesus&#x27; head with oil, and Jesus explains that this is a sign of his coming death; Jesus celebrates Passover with the disciples, declares the bread and wine to be his body and blood, and goes with them to Gethsemane to pray; there Judas betrays him to the Jewish authorities. Interrogated by the high priest, Jesus says that he is the Christ, the Son of God, and will return as Son of Man at God&#x27;s right hand. The Jewish leaders turn him over to Pilate, who has him crucified as one who claims to be &quot;king of the Jews&quot;; Jesus, abandoned by the disciples, is buried in a rock tomb by a sympathetic member of the Jewish council.
* The women who have followed Jesus come to the tomb on Sunday morning; they find it empty, and are told by a young man in a white robe to go and tell the others that Jesus has risen and has gone before them to Galilee; &quot;but they said nothing to anyone, for they were afraid&quot;.

===Ending===

The earliest extant Greek manuscripts of Mark, codices Vaticanus (which contains a large blank space in the column after 16:8) and Sinaiticus, end at Mark 16:8, with the women fleeing in fear from the empty tomb. The majority of recent scholars believe this to be the original ending, and that this is supported by statements from the early Church Fathers Eusebius and Jerome. The &quot;shorter ending&quot;, found in a small number of manuscripts, tells how the women told &quot;those around Peter&quot; all that the angel had commanded and how the message of eternal life (or &quot;proclamation of eternal salvation&quot;) was then sent out by Jesus himself; it differs from the rest of Mark both in style and in its understanding of Jesus and is almost universally considered a spurious addition; the overwhelming majority of manuscripts have the &quot;longer ending&quot;, with accounts of the resurrected Jesus, the commissioning of the disciples to proclaim the gospel, and Christ&#x27;s ascension. In deference to its importance within the manuscript tradition, the New Testament critical editors enclose the longer ending in brackets.

==Theology==

===Gospel===
The author introduces his work as &quot;gospel&quot;, meaning &quot;good news&quot;, a literal translation of the Greek &quot;evangelion&quot;he uses the word more often than any other writer in the New Testament except Paul. Paul uses it to mean &quot;the good news (of the saving significance of the death and resurrection) of Christ&quot;; Mark extends it to the career of Christ as well as his death and resurrection. Like the other gospels, Mark was written to confirm the identity of Jesus as eschatological delivererthe purpose of terms such as &quot;messiah&quot; and &quot;son of God&quot;. As in all the gospels, the messianic identity of Jesus is supported by a number of themes, including: (1) the depiction of his disciples as obtuse, fearful and uncomprehending; (2) the refutation of the charge made by Jesus&#x27; enemies that he was a magician; (3) secrecy surrounding his true identity (this last is missing from John).

===The failure of the disciples===
In Mark, the disciples, especially the Twelve, move from lack of perception of Jesus to rejection of the &quot;way of suffering&quot; to flight and denialeven the women who received the first proclamation of his resurrection can be seen as failures for not reporting the good news. There is much discussion of this theme among scholars. Some argue that the author of Mark was using the disciples to correct &quot;erroneous&quot; views in his own community concerning the reality of the suffering messiah, others that it is an attack on the Jerusalem branch of the church for resisting the extension of the gospel to the gentiles, or a mirror of the convert&#x27;s usual experience of the initial enthusiasm followed by growing awareness of the necessity for suffering. It certainly reflects the strong theme in Mark of Jesus as the &quot;suffering just one&quot; portrayed in so many of the books of the Jewish scriptures, from Jeremiah to Job and the Psalms, but especially in the &quot;Suffering Servant&quot; passages in Isaiah. It also reflects the Jewish scripture theme of God&#x27;s love being met by infidelity and failure, only to be renewed by God. The failure of the disciples and Jesus&#x27; denial by Peter himself would have been powerful symbols of faith, hope and reconciliation for Christians.

===The charge of magic===
Mark contains twenty accounts of miracles and healings, accounting for almost a third of the gospel and half of the first ten chapters, more, proportionally, than in any other gospel. In the gospels as a whole, Jesus&#x27; miracles, prophecies, etc., are presented as evidence of God&#x27;s rule, but Mark&#x27;s descriptions of Jesus&#x27; healings are a partial exception to this, as his methods, using spittle to heal blindness and magic formulae, were those of a magician. This is the charge the Jewish religious leaders bring against Jesus: they say he is performing exorcisms with the aid of an evil spirit and calling up the spirit of John the Baptist. &quot;There was [...] no period in the history of the [Roman] empire in which the magician was not considered an enemy of society,&quot; subject to penalties ranging from exile to death, says Classical scholar Ramsay MacMullen. All the gospels defend Jesus against the charge, which, if true, would contradict their ultimate claims for him. The point of the Beelzebub incident in Mark is to set forth Jesus&#x27; claims to be an instrument of God, not Satan.

===Messianic Secret===

In 1901, William Wrede identified the &quot;Messianic Secret&quot;Jesus&#x27; secrecy about his identity as the messiahas one of Mark&#x27;s central themes. Wrede argued that the elements of the secretJesus&#x27; silencing of the demons, the obtuseness of the disciples regarding his identity, and the concealment of the truth inside parableswere fictions and arose from the tension between the Church&#x27;s post-resurrection messianic belief and the historical reality of Jesus. There remains continuing debate over how far the &quot;secret&quot; originated with Mark and how far he got it from tradition, and how far, if at all, it represents the self-understanding and practices of the historical Jesus.

===Christology===

Christology means a doctrine or understanding concerning the person or nature of Christ. In the New Testament writings it is frequently conveyed through the titles applied to Jesus. Most scholars agree that &quot;Son of God&quot; is the most important of these titles in Mark. It appears on the lips of God himself at the baptism and the transfiguration, and is Jesus&#x27; own self-designation. These and other instances provide reliable evidence of how the evangelist perceived Jesus, but it is not clear just what the title meant to Mark and his 1st-century audience. Where it appears in the Hebrew scriptures it meant Israel as God&#x27;s people, or the king at his coronation, or angels, as well as the suffering righteous man. In Hellenistic culture the same phrase meant a &quot;divine man&quot;, a supernatural being. There is little evidence that &quot;son of God&quot; was a title for the messiah in 1st century Judaism, and the attributes that Mark describes in Jesus are much more those of the Hellenistic miracle-working &quot;divine man&quot; than of the Jewish Davidic messiah.

Mark does not explicitly state what he means by &quot;Son of God&quot;, nor when the sonship was conferred. The New Testament as a whole presents four different understandings:
# Jesus became God&#x27;s son at his resurrection, God &quot;begetting&quot; Jesus to a new life by raising him from the deadthis was the earliest understanding, preserved in Paul&#x27;s Epistle to the Romans, 1:3–4, and in Acts 13:33;
# Jesus became God&#x27;s son at his baptism, the coming of the Holy Spirit marking him as messiah, while &quot;Son of God&quot; refers to the relationship then established for him by Godthis is the understanding implied in Mark 1:9–11; 
# Matthew and Luke present Jesus as &quot;Son of God&quot; from the moment of conception and birth, with God taking the place of a human father;
# John, the last of the gospels, presents the idea that the Christ was pre-existent and became flesh as Jesusan idea also found in Paul.

However, other scholars dispute this interpretation and instead hold that Jesus is already presented as God&#x27;s son even before his baptism in Mark.

Mark also calls Jesus &quot;christos&quot; (Christ), translating the Hebrew &quot;messiah,&quot; (anointed person). In the Old Testament the term messiah (&quot;anointed one&quot;) described prophets, priests and kings; by the time of Jesus, with the kingdom long vanished, it had come to mean an eschatological king (a king who would come at the end of time), one who would be entirely human though far greater than all God&#x27;s previous messengers to Israel, endowed with miraculous powers, free from sin, ruling in justice and glory (as described in, for example, the Psalms of Solomon, a Jewish work from this period). The most important occurrences are in the context of Jesus&#x27; death and suffering, suggesting that, for Mark, Jesus can only be fully understood in that context.

A third important title, &quot;Son of Man&quot;, has its roots in Ezekiel, the Book of Enoch, (a popular Jewish apocalyptic work of the period), and especially in Daniel 7:13–14, where the Son of Man is assigned royal roles of dominion, kingship and glory. Mark 14:62 combines more scriptural allusions: before he comes on clouds the Son of Man will be seated on the right hand of God, pointing to the equivalence of the three titles, Christ, Son of God, Son of Man, the common element being the reference to kingly power.

===Christ&#x27;s death, resurrection and return===
Eschatology means the study of the end-times, and the Jews expected the messiah to be an eschatological figure, a deliverer who would appear at the end of the age to usher in an earthly kingdom. The earliest Jewish Christian community saw Jesus as a messiah in this Jewish sense, a human figure appointed by God as his earthly regent; but they also believed in Jesus&#x27; resurrection and exaltation to heaven, and for this reason they also viewed him as God&#x27;s agent (the &quot;son of God&quot;) who would return in glory ushering in the Kingdom of God.

The term &quot;Son of God&quot; likewise had a specific Jewish meaning, or range of meanings, including referring to an angel, the nation of Israel, or simply a man. One of the most significant Jewish meanings of this epithet is a reference to an earthly king adopted by God as his son at his enthronement, legitimizing his rule over Israel. In Hellenistic culture, in contrast, the phrase meant a &quot;divine man&quot;, covering legendary heroes like Hercules, god-kings like the Egyptian pharaohs, or famous philosophers like Plato. When the gospels call Jesus &quot;Son of God&quot; the intention is to place him in the class of Hellenistic and Greek divine men, the &quot;sons of God&quot; who were endowed with supernatural power to perform healings, exorcisms and other wonderful deeds. Mark&#x27;s &quot;Son of David&quot; is Hellenistic, his Jesus predicting that his mission involves suffering, death and resurrection, and, by implication, not military glory and conquest. This reflects a move away from the Jewish-Christian apocalyptic tradition and towards the Hellenistic message preached by Paul, for whom Christ&#x27;s death and resurrection, rather than the establishment of the apocalyptic Jewish kingdom, is the meaning of salvation, the &quot;gospel&quot;.

==Comparison with other writings==
===Mark and the New Testament===
All four gospels tell a story in which Jesus&#x27; death and resurrection are the crucial redemptive events. There are, however, important differences between the four: Unlike John, Mark never calls Jesus &quot;God&quot;, or claims that Jesus existed before his earthly life; unlike Matthew and Luke, the author does not mention a virgin birth or indicate whether Jesus had a normal human parentage and birth; unlike Matthew and Luke, he makes no attempt to trace Jesus&#x27; ancestry back to King David or Adam with a genealogy.

Christians of Mark&#x27;s time expected Jesus to return as Messiah in their own lifetimeMark, like the other gospels, attributes the promise to return to Jesus himself, and it is reflected in the Pauline Epistles, the Epistle of James, the Epistle to the Hebrews and in the Book of Revelation. When return failed, the early Christians revised their understanding. Some acknowledged that the Second Coming had been delayed, but still expected it; others redefined the focus of the promise, the Gospel of John, for example, speaking of &quot;eternal life&quot; as something available in the present; while still others concluded that Jesus would not return at all (the Second Epistle of Peter argues against those who held the view that Jesus would not return at all). Other scholars, however, contend that all four gospels show an eschatology wherein many of the eschatological topics concern the destruction of the Jewish Temple, the transfiguration and resurrection of Jesus, whereas his return is a promise for an undisclosed time in the future which people should always be ready for. Other scholars, like those of the Jesus Seminar, believe that the apocalyptic language in Mark and the rest of the gospels are inventions of the gospel writers and the early Christians for theological and cultural purposes.

Mark&#x27;s despairing death of Jesus was changed to a more victorious one in subsequent gospels. Mark&#x27;s Christ dies with the cry, &quot;My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?&quot;; Matthew, the next gospel to be written, repeats this word for word but manages to make clear that Jesus&#x27;s death is the beginning of the resurrection of Israel; Luke has a still more positive picture, replacing Mark&#x27;s (and Matthew&#x27;s) cry of despair with one of submission to God&#x27;s will (&quot;Father, into your hands I commend my spirit&quot;); while John, the last gospel, has Jesus dying without apparent suffering in fulfillment of the divine plan.

===Content unique to Mark===

* The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath. Not present in either Matthew 12:1–8 or Luke 6:1–5. This is also a so-called &quot;Western non-interpolation&quot;. The passage is not found in the Western text of Mark.
* People were saying, &quot;[Jesus] has gone out of his mind&quot;, see also Rejection of Jesus.
* Mark is the only gospel with the combination of verses in Mark 4:24–25: the other gospels split them up, Mark 4:24 being found in Luke 6:38 and Matthew 7:2, Mark 4:25 in Matthew 13:12 and Matthew 25:29, Luke 8:18 and Luke 19:26.
*The Parable of the Growing Seed.

* &quot;Thus he declared all foods clean&quot;. 7:19 NRSV, not found in the Matthean parallel Matthew 15:15–20.
* There is no mention of Samaritans.

* Jesus lays his hands on a blind man twice in curing him: 8:23–25; &quot;cf.&quot; 5:23, 16:18, Acts 6:6, Acts 9:17, Acts 28:8, laying on of hands.
* Jesus cites the Shema Yisrael: &quot;Hear O Israel ...&quot;; in the parallels of Matt 22:37–38 and Luke 10:27 the first part of the Shema is absent.
* Mark points out that the Mount of Olives is across from the Temple.
* When Jesus is arrested, a naked young man flees. A young man in a robe also appears in Mark 16:5–7.
* Mark does not name the High Priest.
* Witness testimony against Jesus does not agree.
* The cock crows &quot;twice&quot; as predicted. See also Fayyum Fragment. The other Gospels simply record, &quot;the cock crew&quot;. Early codices 01, W, and most Western texts have the simpler version.
* Pilate&#x27;s position (Governor) is not specified.
* Simon of Cyrene&#x27;s sons are named.
* A summoned centurion is questioned.
* The women ask each other who will roll away the stone.

* Mark is the only canonical gospel with significant various alternative endings. Most of the contents of the traditional &quot;Longer Ending&quot; () are found in other New Testament texts and are not unique to Mark, see , the one significant exception being 16:18b (&quot;and if they drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them&quot;), which is unique to Mark.

<text>The Gospel of Luke is the third of the New Testament&#x27;s four canonical Gospels. It tells of the origins, birth, ministry, death, resurrection, and ascension of Jesus. Together with the Acts of the Apostles, it makes up a two-volume work which scholars call Luke–Acts, accounting for 27.5% of the New Testament. The combined work divides the history of first-century Christianity into three stages, with the gospel making up the first two of these – the life of Jesus the messiah (Christ) from his birth to the beginning of his mission in the meeting with John the Baptist, followed by his ministry with events such as the Sermon on the Plain and its Beatitudes, and his Passion, death, and resurrection. 

Most modern scholars agree that the main sources used for Luke were a), the Gospel of Mark, b), a hypothetical sayings collection called the Q source, and c), material found in no other gospels, often referred to as the L (for Luke) source. The author is anonymous; the traditional view that Luke the Evangelist was the companion of Paul is still occasionally put forward, but the scholarly consensus emphasises the many contradictions between Acts and the authentic Pauline letters (the view that the author, not necessarily Luke, met Paul is more common, perhaps including most scholars). The most probable date for its composition is around AD 80–110, and there is evidence that it was still being revised well into the 2nd century.

==Composition==
===Textual history===

Autographs (original copies) of Luke and the other Gospels have not been preserved; the texts that survive are third-generation copies, with no two completely identical. The earliest witnesses (the technical term for written manuscripts) for the Gospel of Luke fall into two &quot;families&quot; with considerable differences between them, the Western and the Alexandrian text-type, and the dominant view is that the Western text represents a process of deliberate revision, as the variations seem to form specific patterns.

The fragment is often cited as the oldest witness. It has been dated from the late 2nd century, although this dating is disputed. Papyrus 75 (= Papyrus Bodmer XIV–XV) is another very early manuscript (late 2nd/early 3rd century), and it includes an attribution of the Gospel to Luke. The oldest complete texts are the 4th-century Codex Sinaiticus and Vaticanus, both from the Alexandrian family; Codex Bezae, a 5th- or 6th-century Western text-type manuscript that contains Luke in Greek and Latin versions on facing pages, appears to have descended from an offshoot of the main manuscript tradition, departing from more familiar readings at many points. Codex Bezae shows comprehensively the differences between the versions which show no core theological significance.

===Luke–Acts: unity, authorship and date===

The gospel of Luke and the Acts of the Apostles make up a two-volume work which scholars call Luke–Acts. Together they account for 27.5% of the New Testament, the largest contribution by a single author, providing the framework for both the Church&#x27;s liturgical calendar and the historical outline into which later generations have fitted their idea of the story of Jesus.

The author is not named in either volume, but he was educated, a man of means, probably urban, and someone who respected manual work, although not a worker himself; this is significant, because more high-brow writers of the time looked down on the artisans and small business-people who made up the early church of Paul and who were presumably Luke&#x27;s audience. According to a Church tradition beginning with Irenaeus ( AD) he was the Luke named as a companion of Paul in three of the Pauline letters, but &quot;a critical consensus emphasizes the countless contradictions between the account in Acts and the authentic Pauline letters&quot;: an example can be seen by comparing Acts&#x27; accounts of Paul&#x27;s conversion (Acts 9:1–31, Acts 22:6–21, and Acts 26:9–23) with Paul&#x27;s own statement that he remained unknown to Christians in Judea after that event in Galatians 1:17–24,), and while the author of the Gospel of Luke clearly admired Paul, his theology differs significantly from Paul&#x27;s on key points and he does not represent Paul&#x27;s views accurately. Many modern scholars have therefore expressed doubt that the author of Luke-Acts was the physician Luke, and critical opinion on the subject was assessed to be roughly evenly divided near the end of the 20th century.Most scholars maintain that the author of Luke-Acts, whether named Luke or not, met Paul.

The interpretation of the &quot;we&quot; passages in Acts as indicative that the writer relied on a historical eyewitness (whether Luke the evangelist or not), remains the most influential in current biblical studies. Objections to this viewpoint, among others, include the claim that Luke-Acts contains differences in theology and historical narrative which are irreconcilable with the authentic letters of Paul the Apostle.

The eclipse of the traditional attribution to Luke the companion of Paul has meant that an early date for the gospel is now rarely put forward. Most scholars date the composition of the combined work to around 80–110 AD, and there is textual evidence (the conflicts between Western and Alexandrian manuscript families) that Luke–Acts was still being substantially revised well into the 2nd century.

===Genre, models and sources===
Luke–Acts is a religio-political history of the founder of the church and his successors, in both deeds and words. The author describes his book as a &quot;narrative&quot; (), rather than as a gospel, and implicitly criticises his predecessors for not giving their readers the speeches of Jesus and the Apostles, as such speeches were the mark of a &quot;full&quot; report, the vehicle through which ancient historians conveyed the meaning of their narratives. He seems to have taken as his model the works of two respected Classical authors, Dionysius of Halicarnassus, who wrote a history of Rome (&quot;Roman Antiquities&quot;), and the Jewish historian Josephus, author of a history of the Jews (&quot;Antiquities of the Jews&quot;). All three authors anchor the histories of their respective peoples by dating the births of the founders (Romulus, Moses, and Jesus) and narrate the stories of the founders&#x27; births from God, so that they are sons of God. Each founder taught authoritatively, appeared to witnesses after death, and ascended to heaven. Crucial aspects of the teaching of all three concerned the relationship between rich and poor and the question of whether &quot;foreigners&quot; were to be received into the people.

Mark, written around 70 AD, provided the narrative outline for Luke, but Mark contains comparatively little of Jesus&#x27; teachings, and for these Luke likely turned to a hypothesized collection of sayings called Q source, which would have consisted mostly, although not exclusively, of &quot;sayings&quot;. Mark and Q account for about 64% of Luke; the remaining material, known as the L source, is of unknown origin and date. Most Q and L-source material is grouped in two clusters, Luke 6:17–8:3 and 9:51–18:14, and L-source material forms the first two sections of the gospel (the preface and infancy and childhood narratives).

===Audience and authorial intent===
Luke was written to be read aloud to a group of Jesus-followers gathered in a house to share the Lord&#x27;s Supper. The author assumes an educated Greek-speaking audience, but directs his attention to specifically Christian concerns rather than to the Greco-Roman world at large. He begins his gospel with a preface addressed to &quot;Theophilus&quot;: the name means &quot;Lover of God&quot;, and could refer to any Christian, though most interpreters consider it a reference to a Christian convert and Luke&#x27;s literary patron. Here he informs Theophilus of his intention, which is to lead his reader to certainty through an orderly account &quot;of the events that have been fulfilled among us.&quot; He did not, however, intend to provide Theophilus with a historical justification of the Christian faith – &quot;did it happen?&quot; – but to encourage faith – &quot;what happened, and what does it all mean?&quot;

==Structure and content==
===Structure===
Following the author&#x27;s preface addressed to his patron and the two birth narratives (John the Baptist and Jesus), the gospel opens in Galilee and moves gradually to its climax in Jerusalem:
# A brief preface addressed to Theophilus stating the author&#x27;s aims;
# Birth and infancy narratives for both Jesus and John the Baptist, interpreted as the dawn of the promised era of Israel&#x27;s salvation;
# Preparation for Jesus&#x27; messianic mission: John&#x27;s prophetic mission, his baptism of Jesus, and the testing of Jesus&#x27; vocation;
# The beginning of Jesus&#x27; mission in Galilee, and the hostile reception there;
# The central section: the journey to Jerusalem, where Jesus knows he must meet his destiny as God&#x27;s prophet and Messiah;
# His mission in Jerusalem, culminating in confrontation with the leaders of the Jewish Temple;
# His last supper with his most intimate followers, followed by his arrest, interrogation, and crucifixion;
# God&#x27;s validation of Jesus as Christ: events from the first Easter to the Ascension, showing Jesus&#x27; death to be divinely ordained, in keeping with both scriptural promise and the nature of messiahship, and anticipating the story of Acts.

===Parallel structure of Luke–Acts===
The structure of Acts parallels the structure of the gospel, demonstrating the universality of the divine plan and the shift of authority from Jerusalem to Rome:

*The gospel – the acts of Jesus:
** The presentation of the child Jesus at the Temple in Jerusalem
** Jesus&#x27; forty days in the desert
** Jesus in Samaria/Judea
** Jesus in the Decapolis
** Jesus receives the Holy Spirit
** Jesus preaches with power (the power of the spirit)
** Jesus heals the sick
** Death of Jesus
** The apostles are sent to preach to all nations
*The acts of the apostles:
** Jerusalem
** Forty days before the Ascension
** Samaria
** Asia Minor
** Pentecost: Christ&#x27;s followers receive the spirit
** The apostles preach with the power of the spirit
** The apostles heal the sick
** Death of Stephen, the first martyr for Christ
** Paul preaches in Rome

==Theology==
===Luke&#x27;s &quot;salvation history&quot;===
Luke&#x27;s theology is expressed primarily through his overarching plot, the way scenes, themes and characters combine to construct his specific worldview. His &quot;salvation history&quot; stretches from the Creation to the present time of his readers, in three ages: first, the time of &quot;the Law and the Prophets&quot;, the period beginning with Genesis and ending with the appearance of John the Baptist; second, the epoch of Jesus, in which the Kingdom of God was preached; and finally the period of the Church, which began when the risen Christ was taken into Heaven, and would end with his second coming.

===Christology===
Luke&#x27;s understanding of Jesus – his Christology – is central to his theology. One approach to this is through the titles Luke gives to Jesus: these include, but are not limited to, Christ (Messiah), Lord, Son of God, and Son of Man. Another is by reading Luke in the context of similar Greco-Roman divine saviour figures (Roman emperors are an example), references which would have made clear to Luke&#x27;s readers that Jesus was the greatest of all saviours. A third is to approach Luke through his use of the Old Testament, those passages from Jewish scripture which he cites to establish that Jesus is the promised Messiah. While much of this is familiar, much also is missing: for example, Luke makes no clear reference to Christ&#x27;s pre-existence or to the Christian&#x27;s union with Christ, and makes relatively little reference to the concept of atonement: perhaps he felt no need to mention these ideas, or disagreed with them, or possibly he was simply unaware of them.
Even what Luke does say about Christ is ambiguous or even contradictory. For example, according to Luke 2:11 Jesus was the Christ at his birth, but in Acts 2:36 he becomes Christ at the resurrection, while in Acts 3:20 it seems his messiahship is active only at the parousia, the &quot;second coming&quot;; similarly, in Luke 2:11 he is the Saviour from birth, but in Acts 5:31 he is made Saviour at the resurrection; and he is born the Son of God in Luke 1:32–35, but becomes the Son of God at the resurrection according to Acts 13:33. Many of these differences may be due to scribal error, but others are argued to be deliberate alterations to doctrinally unacceptable passages, or the introduction by scribes of &quot;proofs&quot; for their favourite theological tenets.

===The Holy Spirit, the Christian community, and the Kingdom of God===
The Holy Spirit plays a more important role in Luke–Acts than in the other gospels. Some scholars have argued that the Spirit&#x27;s involvement in the career of Jesus is paradigmatic of the universal Christian experience, others that Luke&#x27;s intention was to stress Jesus&#x27; uniqueness as the Prophet of the final age. It is clear, however, that Luke understands the enabling power of the Spirit, expressed through non-discriminatory fellowship (&quot;All who believed were together and had all things in common&quot;), to be the basis of the Christian community. This community can also be understood as the Kingdom of God, although the kingdom&#x27;s final consummation will not be seen till the Son of Man comes &quot;on a cloud&quot; at the end-time.

===Christians vs. Rome and the Jews===

Luke needed to define the position of Christians in relation to two political and social entities, the Roman Empire and Judaism. Regarding the Empire, Luke makes clear that, while Christians are not a threat to the established order, the rulers of this world hold their power from Satan, and the essential loyalty of Christ&#x27;s followers is to God and this world will be the kingdom of God, ruled by Christ the King. Regarding the Jews, Luke emphasises the fact that Jesus and all his earliest followers were Jews, although by his time the majority of Christ-followers were gentiles; nevertheless, the Jews had rejected and killed the Messiah, and the Christian mission now lay with the gentiles.

==Comparison with other writings==
===Synoptics===
The gospels of Matthew, Mark and Luke share so much in common that they are called the Synoptics, as they frequently cover the same events in similar and sometimes identical language. The majority opinion among scholars is that Mark was the earliest of the three (about 70 AD) and that Matthew and Luke both used this work and the &quot;sayings gospel&quot; known as Q as their basic sources. Luke has both expanded Mark and refined his grammar and syntax, as Mark&#x27;s Greek writing is less elegant. Some passages from Mark he has eliminated, notably most of chapters 6 and 7, which he apparently felt reflected poorly on the disciples and painted Jesus too much like a magician. The disciple Peter is given a notably more positive depiction than the other three gospels, with his failings either occluded or excused, and his merits and role emphasized. Despite this, he follows Mark&#x27;s narrative more faithfully than does Matthew.

===The Gospel of John===
Despite being grouped with Matthew and Mark, the Gospel of Luke has a number of parallels with the Gospel of John which are not shared by the other synoptics:
* Luke uses the terms &quot;Jews&quot; and &quot;Israelites&quot; in a way unlike Mark, but like John.
* Both gospels have characters named Mary of Bethany, Martha, and Lazarus, although John&#x27;s Lazarus is portrayed as a real person, while Luke&#x27;s is a figure in a parable.
* There are several points where Luke&#x27;s passion narrative resembles that of John. At Jesus&#x27; arrest, only Luke and John state that the servant&#x27;s ear was cut off.
There are also several other parallels that scholars have identified. Recently, some scholars have proposed that the author of John&#x27;s gospel may have specifically redacted and responded to the Gospel of Luke.

===The Gospel of Marcion===

Some time in the 2nd century, the Christian thinker Marcion of Sinope began using a gospel that was very similar to, but shorter than, canonical Luke. Marcion was well known for preaching that the god who sent Jesus into the world was a different, higher deity than the creator god of Judaism.

While no manuscript copies of Marcion&#x27;s gospel survive, reconstructions of his text have been published by Adolf von Harnack and Dieter T. Roth, based on quotations in the anti-Marcionite treatises of orthodox Christian apologists, such as Irenaeus, Tertullian, and Epiphanius. These early apologists accused Marcion of having &quot;mutilated&quot; canonical Luke by removing material that contradicted his unorthodox theological views. According to Tertullian, Marcion also accused his orthodox opponents of having &quot;falsified&quot; canonical Luke.

Like the Gospel of Mark, Marcion&#x27;s gospel lacked any nativity story, and Luke&#x27;s account of the baptism of Jesus was absent. The Gospel of Marcion also omitted Luke&#x27;s parables of the Good Samaritan and the Prodigal Son.

<text>The Gospel of Matthew is the first book of the New Testament of the Bible and one of the three synoptic Gospels. It tells the story of who the author believes is Israel&#x27;s messiah (Christ), Jesus, his resurrection, and his mission to the world. Matthew wishes to emphasize that the Jewish tradition should not be lost in a church that was increasingly becoming gentile. The gospel reflects the struggles and conflicts between the evangelist&#x27;s community and the other Jews, particularly with its sharp criticism of the scribes, chief priests and Pharisees with the position that the Kingdom of Heaven has been taken away from them and given instead to the church.

The gospel is anonymous. Traditionally attributed to the Apostle Matthew, the predominant scholarly view is that it was written in the last quarter of the first century by an anonymous Jew familiar with technical legal aspects of scripture. Most scholars think Matthew used the Gospel of Mark and the hypothetical sayings Gospel Q (which consists of the material Matthew shares in common with Luke) and is the product of the second generation of the Christian movement, though it draws on the memory of the first generation of the disciples of Jesus.

== Composition==
===Author and date===

The gospel is anonymous. According to church tradition originating with Papias of Hierapolis (), it was written by Matthew, the companion of Jesus, but this presents numerous problems, and most modern scholars hold that it was written in the last quarter of the first century by a male Jew who stood on the margin between traditional and nontraditional Jewish values and who was familiar with technical legal aspects of scripture being debated in his time.However, scholars such as N. T. Wright and John Wenham hold there are problems with dating Matthew late in the first century, and argue that it was written in the 40s–50s AD. Whether the Gospels were composed before or after 70 AD, according to Bas van Os, the lifetime of various eyewitnesses that includes Jesus&#x27;s own family through the end of the First Century is very likely statistically. Markus Bockmuehl finds this structure of lifetime memory in various early Christian traditions.

The majority of scholars believe that Mark was the first gospel to be composed and that Matthew and Luke both drew upon it as a major source for their works. The author did not simply copy Mark but used it as a base, emphasizing Jesus&#x27;s place in the Jewish tradition and including details not found in Mark. This does not necessarily show a linear approach of continual development and addition only, as some of what Paul the Apostle says is more similar to Matthew&#x27;s details. Writing in a polished Semitic &quot;synagogue Greek&quot;, he drew on the Gospel of Mark as a source, plus a hypothetical collection of sayings known as the Q source (material shared with Luke but not with Mark) and hypothetical material unique to his own community, called the M source or &quot;Special Matthew.&quot; Matthew could have depended on Mark through oral tradition or used memorization rather than simply copying. Alan Kirk praises Matthew for his &quot;scribal memory competence&quot; and &quot;his high esteem for and careful handling of both Mark and Q&quot;, which makes claims the latter two works are significantly different in terms of theology or historical reliability dubious.

Matthew has 600 verses in common with Mark, which is a book of only 661 verses. There is approximately an additional 220 verses shared by Matthew and Luke but not found in Mark, from a second source, a hypothetical collection of sayings to which scholars give the name (&#x27;source&#x27; in the German language), or the Q source. This view, known as the two-source hypothesis (Mark and Q), allows for a further body of tradition known as &quot;Special Matthew&quot;, or the M source, meaning material unique to Matthew. This may represent a separate source, or it may come from the author&#x27;s church, or he may have composed these verses himself. The author also had the Greek scriptures at his disposal, both as book-scrolls (Greek translations of Isaiah, the Psalms etc.) and in the form of &quot;testimony collections&quot; (collections of excerpts), and the oral stories of his community. Many of the quotations of the scriptures in Matthew are more closely matched with the Masoretic, leading many scholars to believe that the author could understand Hebrew.

=== Setting ===
Most scholars view the gospel of Matthew as a work of the second generation of Christians, though it draws on the memory of the first generation of Jesus&#x27;s disciples. For these early Chistians the defining event was the destruction of Jerusalem and the Temple by the Romans in 70 AD in the course of the First Jewish–Roman War (66–73 AD); from this point on, what had begun with Jesus of Nazareth as a Jewish messianic movement became an increasingly gentile phenomenon which would evolve in time into a separate religion. The author appears to have written for a community of Greek-speaking Jewish Christians located probably in Syria; Antioch, the largest city in Roman Syria and the third largest city in the empire, is often proposed. Other scholars hold that the historical Jesus had already predicted that the Jerusalem Temple would be destroyed.

The community to which Matthew belonged, like many 1st-century Christians, was still part of the larger Jewish community. The relationship of Matthew to this wider world of Judaism remains a subject of study and contention, the principal question being to what extent, if any, Matthew&#x27;s community had cut itself off from its Jewish roots. It is evident from the gospel that there was conflict between Matthew&#x27;s group and other Jewish groups, and it is generally agreed that the root of the conflict was the Matthew community&#x27;s belief in Jesus as the Messiah and authoritative interpreter of the law, as one risen from the dead and uniquely endowed with divine authority.

The divine nature of Jesus was a major issue for the Matthaean community, the crucial element separating the early Christians from their Jewish neighbors; while Mark begins with Jesus&#x27;s baptism and temptations, Matthew goes back to Jesus&#x27;s origins, showing him as the Son of God from his birth, the fulfillment of messianic prophecies of the Old Testament. The title Son of David, used exclusively in relation to miracles, identifies Jesus as the healing and miracle-working Messiah of Israel sent to Israel alone. As Son of Man he will return to judge the world, an expectation which his disciples recognize but of which his enemies are unaware. As Son of God, God is revealing himself through his son, and Jesus proving his sonship through his obedience and example.

Unlike Mark, Matthew never bothers to explain Jewish customs, since his intended audience was a Jewish one; unlike Luke, who traces Jesus&#x27;s ancestry back to Adam, father of the human race, he traces it only to Abraham, father of the Jews. Of his three presumed sources only &quot;M&quot;, the material from his own community, refers to a &quot;church&quot; (&quot;ecclesia&quot;), an organized group with rules for keeping order; and the content of &quot;M&quot; suggests that this community was strict in keeping the Jewish law, holding that they must exceed the scribes and the Pharisees in &quot;righteousness&quot; (adherence to Jewish law). Writing from within a Jewish-Christian community growing increasingly distant from other Jews and becoming increasingly gentile in its membership and outlook, Matthew put down in his gospel his vision &quot;of an assembly or church in which both Jew and Gentile would flourish together&quot;.

==Structure and content==
===Structure: narrative and discourses===
Matthew, alone among the gospels, alternates five blocks of narrative with five of discourse, marking each off with the phrase &quot;When Jesus had finished&quot; (see Five Discourses of Matthew). Some scholars see in this a deliberate plan to create a parallel to the first five books of the Old Testament; others see a three-part structure based around the idea of Jesus as Messiah, a set of weekly readings spread out over the year, or no plan at all. Davies and Allison, in their widely used commentary, draw attention to the use of &quot;triads&quot; (the gospel groups things in threes), and R. T. France, in another influential commentary, notes the geographic movement from Galilee to Jerusalem and back, with the post-resurrection appearances in Galilee as the culmination of the whole story.

=== Prologue: genealogy, Nativity and infancy (Matthew 1–2) ===
The Gospel of Matthew begins with the words &quot;The Book of Genealogy [in Greek, &#x27;Genesis&#x27;] of Jesus Christ&quot;, deliberately echoing the words of Genesis 2:4 in the Septuagint. The genealogy tells of Jesus&#x27;s descent from Abraham and King David and the miraculous events surrounding his virgin birth, and the infancy narrative tells of the massacre of the innocents, the flight into Egypt, and eventual journey to Nazareth.

===First narrative and Sermon on the Mount (Matthew 3:1–8:1)===

Following the genealogy, birth and infancy of Jesus, the first narrative section begins. John the Baptist baptizes Jesus, and the Holy Spirit descends upon him. Jesus prays and meditates in the wilderness for forty days, and is tempted by Satan. His early ministry by word and deed in Galilee meets with much success, and leads to the Sermon on the Mount, the first of the discourses. The sermon presents the ethics of the kingdom of God, introduced by the Beatitudes (&quot;Blessed are...&quot;). It concludes with a reminder that the response to the kingdom will have eternal consequences, and the crowd&#x27;s amazed response leads into the next narrative block.

===Second narrative and discourse (Matthew 8:2–11:1)===
From the authoritative words of Jesus, the gospel turns to three sets of three miracles interwoven with two sets of two discipleship stories (the second narrative), followed by a discourse on mission and suffering. Jesus commissions the Twelve Disciples and sends them to preach to the Jews, perform miracles, and prophesy the imminent coming of the Kingdom, commanding them to travel lightly, without staff or sandals.

===Third narrative and discourse (Matthew 11:2–13:53)===
Opposition to Jesus comes to a head with an accusation put forward by the Pharisees that his deeds are done through the power of Satan. Jesus in turn accuses his opponents of blaspheming the Holy Spirit. The discourse is a set of parables emphasizing the sovereignty of God, and concluding with a challenge to the disciples to understand the teachings as scribes of the Kingdom of Heaven. (Matthew avoids using the holy word God in the expression &quot;Kingdom of God&quot;; instead he prefers the term &quot;Kingdom of Heaven&quot;, reflecting the Jewish tradition of not speaking the name of God).

===Fourth narrative and discourse (Matthew 13:54–19:1)===

The fourth narrative section reveals that the increasing opposition to Jesus will result in his crucifixion in Jerusalem, and that his disciples must therefore prepare for his absence. The instructions for the post-crucifixion church emphasize responsibility and humility. This section contains the two feedings of the multitude (Matthew 14:13–21 and 15:32–39) along with the narrative in which Simon, newly renamed Peter (), calls Jesus &quot;the Christ, the son of the living God&quot;, and Jesus states that on this &quot;bedrock&quot; () he will build his church (Matthew 16:13–19).

Matthew 16:13–19 forms the foundation for the papacy&#x27;s claim of authority.

===Fifth narrative and discourse (Matthew 19:2–26:1)===

Jesus travels toward Jerusalem, and the opposition intensifies: he is tested by the Pharisees as soon as he begins to move toward the city, and when he arrives he is soon in conflict with the Temple&#x27;s traders and religious leaders. He teaches in the Temple, debating with the chief priests and religious leaders and speaking in parables about the Kingdom of God and the failings of the chief priests and the Pharisees. The Herodian caucus also become involved in a scheme to entangle Jesus, but Jesus&#x27;s careful response to their enquiry, &quot;Render therefore to Caesar the things that are Caesar&#x27;s, and to God the things that are God&#x27;s&quot;, leaves them marveling at his words.

The disciples ask about the future, and in his final discourse (the Olivet Discourse) Jesus speaks of the coming end. There will be false Messiahs, earthquakes, and persecutions, the sun, moon, and stars will fail, but &quot;this generation&quot; will not pass away before all the prophecies are fulfilled. The disciples must steel themselves for ministry to all the nations. At the end of the discourse, Matthew notes that Jesus has finished all his words, and attention turns to the crucifixion.

===Conclusion: Passion, Resurrection and Great Commission (Matthew 26:2–28:20)===
The events of Jesus&#x27;s last week occupy a third of the content of all four gospels. Jesus enters Jerusalem in triumph and drives the money changers from the Temple, holds a Last Supper, prays to be spared the coming agony (but concludes &quot;if this cup may not pass away from me, except I drink it, thy will be done&quot;), and is betrayed. He is tried by the Jewish leaders (the Sanhedrin) and before Pontius Pilate, and Pilate washes his hands to indicate that he does not assume responsibility. Jesus is crucified as king of the Jews, mocked by all. On his death there is an earthquake, the veil of the Temple is rent, and saints rise from their tombs. Mary Magdalene and another Mary discover the empty tomb, guarded by an angel, and Jesus himself tells them to tell the disciples to meet him in Galilee.

After the resurrection the remaining disciples return to Galilee, &quot;to the mountain that Jesus had appointed&quot;, where he comes to them and tells them that he has been given &quot;all authority in heaven and on Earth.&quot; He gives the Great Commission: &quot;Therefore go and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to obey everything that I have commanded you&quot;. Jesus will be with them &quot;to the very end of the age&quot;.

== Theology ==
=== Christology ===
Christology is the theological doctrine of Christ, &quot;the affirmations and definitions of Christ&#x27;s humanity and deity&quot;. There are a variety of Christologies in the New Testament, albeit with a single centre—Jesus is the figure in whom God has acted for mankind&#x27;s salvation.

Matthew has taken key Christological texts from Mark, but has sometimes changed the stories found in Mark, giving evidence of his own concerns. The title Son of David identifies Jesus as the healing and miracle-working Messiah of Israel (it is used exclusively in relation to miracles), and the Jewish messiah is sent to Israel alone. As Son of Man he will return to judge the world, a fact his disciples recognize but of which his enemies are unaware. As Son of God he is named Immanuel (&#x27;God with us&#x27;), God revealing himself through his son, and Jesus proving his sonship through his obedience and example.

=== Relationship with the Jews ===
Matthew&#x27;s prime concern was that the Jewish tradition should not be lost in a church that was increasingly becoming gentile. This concern lies behind the frequent citations of Jewish scripture, the evocation of Jesus as the new Moses along with other events from Jewish history, and the concern to present Jesus as fulfilling, not destroying, the Law. Matthew must have been aware of the tendency to distort Paul&#x27;s teaching of the law no longer having power over the New Testament Christian into antinomianism, and addressed Christ&#x27;s fulfilling of what the Israelites expected from the &quot;Law and the Prophets&quot; in an eschatological sense, in that he was all that the Old Testament had predicted in the Messiah.

The gospel has been interpreted as reflecting the struggles and conflicts between the evangelist&#x27;s community and the other Jews, particularly with its sharp criticism of the scribes and Pharisees. It tells how Israel&#x27;s Messiah, rejected and executed in Israel, pronounces judgment on Israel and its leaders and becomes the salvation of the gentiles. Prior to the crucifixion of Jesus, the Jews are referred to as Israelites—the honorific title of God&#x27;s chosen people. After it, they are called (Jews), a sign that—due to their rejection of the Christ—the &quot;Kingdom of Heaven&quot; has been taken away from them and given instead to the church.

== Comparison with other writings ==
=== Christological development ===
The divine nature of Jesus was a major issue for the community of Matthew, the crucial element marking them from their Jewish neighbors. Early understandings of this nature grew as the gospels were being written. Before the gospels, that understanding was focused on the revelation of Jesus as God in his resurrection, but the gospels reflect a broadened focus extended backwards in time.

===Mark===
Matthew is a creative reinterpretation of Mark, stressing Jesus&#x27;s teachings as much as his acts, and making subtle changes in order to stress his divine nature: for example, Mark&#x27;s &quot;young man&quot; who appears at Jesus&#x27;s tomb becomes &quot;a radiant angel&quot; in Matthew. The miracle stories in Mark do not demonstrate the divinity of Jesus, but rather confirm his status as an emissary of God (which was Mark&#x27;s understanding of the Messiah).

=== Chronology ===
There is a broad disagreement over chronology between Matthew, Mark and Luke on one hand and John on the other: all four agree that Jesus&#x27;s public ministry began with an encounter with John the Baptist, but Matthew, Mark and Luke follow this with an account of teaching and healing in Galilee, then a trip to Jerusalem where there is an incident in the Temple, climaxing with the crucifixion on the day of the Passover holiday. John, by contrast, puts the Temple incident very early in Jesus&#x27;s ministry, has several trips to Jerusalem, and puts the crucifixion immediately before the Passover holiday, on the day when the lambs for the Passover meal were being sacrificed in Temple.

===Canonical positioning===
The early patristic scholars regarded Matthew as the earliest of the gospels and placed it first in the canon, and the early Church mostly quoted from Matthew, secondarily from John, and only distantly from Mark.

<text>The Gospel of John () is the fourth of the New Testament&#x27;s four canonical Gospels. It contains a highly schematic account of the ministry of Jesus, with seven &quot;signs&quot; culminating in the raising of Lazarus (foreshadowing the resurrection of Jesus) and seven &quot;I am&quot; discourses (concerned with issues of the church–synagogue debate at the time of composition) culminating in Thomas&#x27;s proclamation of the risen Jesus as &quot;my Lord and my God&quot;. The gospel&#x27;s concluding verses set out its purpose, &quot;that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing you may have life in his name.&quot;

John reached its final form around AD 90–110, although it contains signs of origins dating back to AD 70 and possibly even earlier. Like the three other gospels, it is anonymous, although it identifies an unnamed &quot;disciple whom Jesus loved&quot; as the source of its traditions. It most likely arose within a &quot;Johannine community&quot;, and – as it is closely related in style and content to the three Johannine epistles – most scholars treat the four books, along with the Book of Revelation, as a single corpus of Johannine literature, albeit not by the same author.

==Authorship==
===Composition===
The Gospel of John, like all the gospels, is anonymous. John 21:22 references a disciple whom Jesus loved and John 21:24–25 says: &quot;This is the disciple who is testifying to these things and has written them, and we know that his testimony is true&quot;. Early Christian tradition, first found in Irenaeus ( AD), identified this disciple with John the Apostle, but most scholars have abandoned this hypothesis or hold it only tenuously; there are multiple reasons for this conclusion, including, for example, the fact that the gospel is written in good Greek and displays sophisticated theology, and is therefore unlikely to have been the work of a simple fisherman. Rather, these verses imply that the core of the gospel relies on the testimony (perhaps written) of the &quot;disciple who is testifying&quot;, as collected, preserved, and reshaped by a community of followers (the &quot;we&quot; of the passage), and that a single follower (the &quot;I&quot;) rearranged this material and perhaps added the final chapter and other passages to produce the final gospel. Most scholars estimate the final form of the text to be around AD 90–110. Given its complex history there may have been more than one place of composition, and while the author was familiar with Jewish customs and traditions, their frequent clarification of these implies that they wrote for a mixed Jewish/Gentile or Gentile audience outside Judea.

The author may have drawn on a &quot;signs source&quot; (a collection of miracles) for chapters 1–12, a &quot;passion source&quot; for the story of Jesus&#x27;s arrest and crucifixion, and a &quot;sayings source&quot; for the discourses, but these hypotheses are much debated, and recent scholarship has tended to turn against positing hypothetical sources for John. The author seems to have known some version of Mark and Luke, as John shares with them some vocabulary and clusters of incidents arranged in the same order, but key terms from those gospels are absent or nearly so, implying that if the author did know them they felt free to write independently. The Hebrew scriptures were an important source, with 14 direct quotations (versus 27 in Mark, 54 in Matthew, 24 in Luke), and their influence is vastly increased when allusions and echoes are included, but the majority of John&#x27;s direct quotations do not agree exactly with any known version of the Jewish scriptures. Recent arguments by Richard Bauckham and others that John preserves eyewitness testimony have not won general acceptance.

===Setting: the Johannine community debate===
For much of the 20th century, scholars interpreted the Gospel of John within the paradigm of a hypothetical &quot;Johannine community&quot;, meaning that it was held to have sprung from a late-1st-century Christian community excommunicated from the Jewish synagogue (probably meaning the Jewish community) on account of its belief in Jesus as the promised messiah. This interpretation, which saw the community as essentially sectarian and outside the mainstream of early Christianity, has been increasingly challenged in the first decades of the 21st century, and there is currently considerable debate over the gospel&#x27;s social, religious and historical context.

==Structure and content==


The majority of scholars see four sections in the Gospel of John: a prologue (1:1–18); an account of the ministry, often called the &quot;Book of Signs&quot; (1:19–12:50); the account of Jesus&#x27;s final night with his disciples and the passion and resurrection, sometimes called the Book of Glory or Book of Exaltation (13:1–20:31); and a conclusion (20:30–31); to these is added an epilogue that most scholars believe was not part of the original text (Chapter 21). Disagreement does exist; some scholars, including Bauckham, argue that John 21 was part of the original work.

*The prologue informs readers of the true identity of Jesus, the Word of God through whom the world was created and who took on human form; he came to the Jews and the Jews rejected him, but &quot;to all who received him (the circle of Christian believers), who believed in his name, he gave power to become children of God.&quot; 
*Book of Signs (ministry of Jesus): Jesus calls his disciples and begins his earthly ministry. He travels from place to place informing his hearers about God the Father in long discourses, offering eternal life to all who will believe, and performing miracles that prove the authenticity of his teachings, which creates tensions with the religious authorities (manifested as early as 5:17–18), who decide he must be eliminated. 
*The Book of Glory tells of Jesus&#x27;s return to his heavenly father: it tells how he prepares his disciples for their lives without his physical presence and his prayer for himself and for them, followed by his betrayal, arrest, trial, crucifixion and post-resurrection appearances. 
*The conclusion sets out the purpose of the gospel, which is &quot;that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing you may have life in his name.&quot;
*Chapter 21, the addendum, tells of Jesus&#x27;s post-resurrection appearances in Galilee, the miraculous catch of fish, the prophecy of the crucifixion of Peter, and the fate of the Beloved Disciple.

The structure is highly schematic: there are seven &quot;signs&quot; culminating in the raising of Lazarus (foreshadowing the resurrection of Jesus), and seven &quot;I am&quot; sayings and discourses, culminating in Thomas&#x27;s proclamation of the risen Jesus as &quot;my Lord and my God&quot; (the same title, , claimed by the Emperor Domitian, an indication of the date of composition).

==Theology==
===Christology===
Scholars agree that while the Gospel of John clearly regards Jesus as divine, it just as clearly subordinates him to the one God. Joseph Ratzinger highlights the link of the Gospel with the Old Testament, while according to James Dunn, this Christology does not describe a subordinationist relation but rather the authority and validity of the Son&#x27;s &quot;revelation&quot; of the Father, the continuity between the Father and the Son. Dunn sees this as intended to serve the Logos Christology, while others (e.g., Andrew Loke) see it as connected to John&#x27;s incarnation theme. But while the developed doctrine of the Trinity is not explicit in the books that constitute the New Testament, the New Testament possesses a triadic understanding of God and contains a number of Trinitarian formulas. John&#x27;s &quot;high Christology&quot; depicts Jesus as divine and preexistent, defends him against Jewish claims that he was &quot;making himself equal to God&quot;, and talks openly about his divine role and echoing Yahweh&#x27;s &quot;I Am that I Am&quot; with seven &quot;I Am&quot; declarations of his own. At the same time there is a stress like that in Luke on the physical continuity of Jesus&#x27;s resurrected body, as Jesus tells Thomas: &quot;Put your finger here; see my hands. Reach out your hand and put it into my side. Stop doubting and believe.&quot;

===Logos===
In the prologue, the gospel identifies Jesus as the Logos or Word. In Ancient Greek philosophy, the term meant the principle of cosmic reason. In this sense, it was similar to the Hebrew concept of Wisdom, God&#x27;s companion and intimate helper in creation. The Hellenistic Jewish philosopher Philo merged these two themes when he described the Logos as God&#x27;s creator of and mediator with the material world. According to Stephen Harris, the gospel adapted Philo&#x27;s description of the Logos, applying it to Jesus, the incarnation of the Logos.

Another possibility is that the title is based on the concept of the divine Word found in the Targums (Aramaic translation/interpretations recited in the synagogue after the reading of the Hebrew Scriptures). In the Targums (which all postdate the first century but which give evidence of preserving early material), the concept of the divine Word was used in a manner similar to Philo, namely, for God&#x27;s interaction with the world (starting from creation) and especially with his people. Israel, for example, was saved from Egypt by action of &quot;the Word of the &quot;, and both Philo and the Targums envision the Word as manifested between the cherubim and the Holy of Holies.

===Cross===
The portrayal of Jesus&#x27;s death in John is unique among the gospels. It does not appear to rely on the kinds of atonement theology indicative of vicarious sacrifice but rather presents Jesus&#x27;s death as his glorification and return to the Father. Likewise, the Synoptic Gospels&#x27; three &quot;passion predictions&quot; are replaced by three instances of Jesus explaining how he will be exalted or &quot;lifted up&quot;. The verb for &quot;lifted up&quot; (, ) reflects the double entendre at work in John&#x27;s theology of the cross, for Jesus is both physically elevated from the earth at the crucifixion but also, at the same time, exalted and glorified.

===Sacraments===

Scholars disagree on whether and how frequently John refers to sacraments, but current scholarly opinion is that there are very few such possible references, and that if they exist they are limited to baptism and the Eucharist. In fact, there is no institution of the Eucharist in John&#x27;s account of the Last Supper (it is replaced by Jesus washing the feet of his disciples), and no New Testament text that unambiguously links baptism with rebirth.

===Individualism===
Compared to the synoptic gospels, John is markedly individualistic, in the sense that it places emphasis more on the individual&#x27;s relation to Jesus than on the corporate nature of the Church. This is largely accomplished through the consistently singular grammatical structure of various aphoristic sayings of Jesus. Emphasis on believers coming into a new group upon their conversion is conspicuously absent from John, and there is a theme of &quot;personal coinherence&quot;, that is, the intimate personal relationship between the believer and Jesus in which the believer &quot;abides&quot; in Jesus and Jesus in the believer. John&#x27;s individualistic tendencies could give rise to a realized eschatology achieved on the level of the individual believer, but this realized eschatology is not to replace &quot;orthodox&quot;, futurist eschatological expectations, but to be &quot;only [their] correlative&quot;.

===John the Baptist===

John&#x27;s account of John the Baptist is different from that of the synoptic gospels. In this gospel, John is not called &quot;the Baptist.&quot; John the Baptist&#x27;s ministry overlaps with that of Jesus; his baptism of Jesus is not explicitly mentioned, but his witness to Jesus is unambiguous. The evangelist almost certainly knew the story of John&#x27;s baptism of Jesus, and makes a vital theological use of it. He subordinates John to Jesus, perhaps in response to members of John&#x27;s sect who regarded the Jesus movement as an offshoot of theirs.

In the Gospel of John, Jesus and his disciples go to Judea early in Jesus&#x27;s ministry before John the Baptist was imprisoned and executed by Herod Antipas. He leads a ministry of baptism larger than John&#x27;s own. The Jesus Seminar rated this account as black, containing no historically accurate information. According to the biblical historians at the Jesus Seminar, John likely had a larger presence in the public mind than Jesus.

===Gnosticism===

In the first half of the 20th century, many scholars, especially Rudolph Bultmann, argued that the Gospel of John has elements in common with Gnosticism. Christian Gnosticism did not fully develop until the mid-2nd century, and so 2nd-century Proto-Orthodox Christians concentrated much effort in examining and refuting it. To say the Gospel of John contained elements of Gnosticism is to assume that Gnosticism had developed to a level that required the author to respond to it. Bultmann, for example, argued that the opening theme of the Gospel of John, the preexisting Logos, along with John&#x27;s duality of light versus darkness, were originally Gnostic themes that John adopted. Other scholars (e.g., Raymond E. Brown) have argued that the preexisting Logos theme arises from the more ancient Jewish writings in the eighth chapter of the Book of Proverbs, and was fully developed as a theme in Hellenistic Judaism by Philo Judaeus. The discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls at Qumran verified the Jewish nature of these concepts. April DeConick, as well as some 19th-century theologians, suggested reading John 8:44 in support of a Gnostic theology and that the natural reading would be &quot;ye are of the father of the Devil&quot;, but this has been disputed.

Gnostics read John but interpreted it differently from non-Gnostics. Gnosticism taught that salvation came from &quot;gnosis&quot;, secret knowledge, and Gnostics saw Jesus as not a savior but a revealer of knowledge. The gospel teaches that salvation can be achieved only through revealed wisdom, specifically belief in (literally belief ) Jesus. John&#x27;s picture of a supernatural savior who promised to return to take those who believed in him to a heavenly dwelling could be fitted into Gnostic views. It has been suggested that similarities between the Gospel of John and Gnosticism may spring from common roots in Jewish Apocalyptic literature.

==Comparison with other writings==
===Synoptic gospels and Pauline literature===
The Gospel of John is significantly different from the synoptic gospels in the selection of its material, its theological emphasis, its chronology, and literary style, with some of its discrepancies amounting to contradictions. The following are some examples of their differences in just one area, that of the material they include in their narratives:

In the Synoptics, the ministry of Jesus takes a single year, but in John it takes three, as evidenced by references to three Passovers. Events are not all in the same order: the date of the crucifixion is different, as is the time of Jesus&#x27; anointing in Bethany and the cleansing of the Temple, which occurs in the beginning of Jesus&#x27; ministry rather than near its end.

Many incidents from John, such as the wedding in Cana, the encounter of Jesus with the Samaritan woman at the well, and the raising of Lazarus, are not paralleled in the synoptics, and most scholars believe the author drew these from an independent source called the &quot;signs gospel&quot;, the speeches of Jesus from a second &quot;discourse&quot; source, and the prologue from an early hymn. The gospel makes extensive use of the Jewish scriptures: John quotes from them directly, references important figures from them, and uses narratives from them as the basis for several of the discourses. The author was also familiar with non-Jewish sources: the Logos of the prologue (the Word that is with God from the beginning of creation), for example, was derived from both the Jewish concept of Lady Wisdom and from the Greek philosophers, John 6 alludes not only to the exodus but also to Greco-Roman mystery cults, and John 4 alludes to Samaritan messianic beliefs.

John lacks scenes from the Synoptics such as Jesus&#x27;s baptism, the calling of the Twelve, exorcisms, parables, and the Transfiguration. Conversely, it includes scenes not found in the Synoptics, including Jesus turning water into wine at the wedding at Cana, the resurrection of Lazarus, Jesus washing the feet of his disciples, and multiple visits to Jerusalem.

In the fourth gospel, Jesus&#x27;s mother Mary is mentioned in three passages but not named. John does assert that Jesus was known as the &quot;son of Joseph&quot; in 6:42. For John, Jesus&#x27;s town of origin is irrelevant, for he comes from beyond this world, from God the Father.

While John makes no direct mention of Jesus&#x27;s baptism, he does quote John the Baptist&#x27;s description of the descent of the Holy Spirit as a dove, as happens at Jesus&#x27;s baptism in the Synoptics. Major synoptic speeches of Jesus are absent, including the Sermon on the Mount and the Olivet Discourse, and the exorcisms of demons are not mentioned. John does not list the Twelve Disciples and names at least one disciple, Nathanael, whose name is not found in the Synoptics. Thomas is given a personality beyond a mere name, described as &quot;Doubting Thomas&quot;.

Jesus is identified with the Word (&quot;Logos&quot;), and the Word is identified with (&quot;god&quot; in Greek); the Synoptics make no such identification. In Mark, Jesus urges his disciples to keep his divinity secret, but in John he is very open in discussing it, even calling himself &quot;I AM&quot;, the title God gives himself in Exodus at his self-revelation to Moses. In the Synoptics, the chief theme is the Kingdom of God and the Kingdom of Heaven (the latter specifically in Matthew), while John&#x27;s theme is Jesus as the source of eternal life, and the Kingdom is only mentioned twice. In contrast to the synoptic expectation of the Kingdom (using the term , meaning &quot;coming&quot;), John presents a more individualistic, realized eschatology.

In the Synoptics, quotations of Jesus are usually in the form of short, pithy sayings; in John, longer quotations are often given. The vocabulary is also different, and filled with theological import: in John, Jesus does not work &quot;miracles&quot;, but &quot;signs&quot; that unveil his divine identity. Most scholars consider John not to contain any parables. Rather, it contains metaphorical stories or allegories, such as those of the Good Shepherd and the True Vine, in which each element corresponds to a specific person, group, or thing. Other scholars consider stories like the childbearing woman or the dying grain to be parables.

According to the Synoptics, Jesus&#x27;s arrest was a reaction to the cleansing of the temple; according to John, it was triggered by the raising of Lazarus. The Pharisees, portrayed as more uniformly legalistic and opposed to Jesus in the synoptic gospels, are portrayed as sharply divided; they frequently debate. Some, such as Nicodemus, even go so far as to be at least partially sympathetic to Jesus. This is believed to be a more accurate historical depiction of the Pharisees, who made debate one of the tenets of their belief system.

In place of the communal emphasis of the Pauline literature, John stresses the personal relationship of the individual to God.

===Johannine literature===
The Gospel of John and the three Johannine epistles exhibit strong resemblances in theology and style; the Book of Revelation has also been traditionally linked with these, but differs from the gospel and letters in style and even theology. The letters were written later than the gospel, and while the gospel reflects the break between the Johannine Christians and the Jewish synagogue, in the letters the Johannine community itself is disintegrating (&quot;They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would have continued with us; but they went out...&quot; - 1 John 2:19). This secession was over Christology, the &quot;knowledge of Christ&quot;, or more accurately the understanding of Christ&#x27;s nature, for the ones who &quot;went out&quot; hesitated to identify Jesus with Christ, minimising the significance of the earthly ministry and denying the salvific importance of Jesus&#x27;s death on the cross. The epistles argue against this view, stressing the eternal existence of the Son of God, the salvific nature of his life and death, and the other elements of the gospel&#x27;s &quot;high&quot; Christology.

===Historical reliability===

Jesus&#x27;s teachings in the Synoptics greatly differ from those in John. Since the 19th century, scholars have almost unanimously accepted that the Johannine discourses are less likely to be historical than the synoptic parables, and were likely written for theological purposes. Nevertheless, they generally agree that John is not without historical value. Some potential points of value include early provenance for some Johannine material, topographical references for Jerusalem and Judea, Jesus&#x27;s crucifixion occurring prior to the Feast of Unleavened Bread, and his arrest in the garden occurring after the accompanying deliberation of Jewish authorities.

Recent scholarship has argued for a more favourable reappraisal of the historical value of the Gospel of John and its importance for the reconstruction of the historical Jesus, based on recent archaeological and literary studies.

==Representations==
The gospel has been depicted in live narrations and dramatized in productions, skits, plays, and Passion Plays, as well as in film. The most recent such portrayal is the 2014 film &quot;The Gospel of John&quot;, directed by David Batty and narrated by David Harewood and Brian Cox, with Selva Rasalingam as Jesus. The 2003 film &quot;The Gospel of John&quot; was directed by Philip Saville and narrated by Christopher Plummer, with Henry Ian Cusick as Jesus.

Parts of the gospel have been set to music. One such setting is Steve Warner&#x27;s power anthem &quot;Come and See&quot;, written for the 20th anniversary of the Alliance for Catholic Education and including lyrical fragments taken from the Book of Signs. Additionally, some composers have made settings of the Passion as portrayed in the gospel, most notably Johann Sebastian Bach&#x27;s &quot;St John Passion&quot;, although some of its verses are from Matthew.

<text>Stephen Grover Cleveland (March 18, 1837June 24, 1908) served as the 22nd and 24th president of the United States, from 1885 to 1889 and again from 1893 to 1897. He was the first Democrat to win election to the presidency after the Civil War and the first of two U.S. presidents to serve nonconsecutive terms.

Born in Caldwell, New Jersey, Cleveland was elected mayor of Buffalo in 1881 and governor of New York in 1882. While governor, he closely cooperated with state assembly minority leader Theodore Roosevelt to pass reform measures, winning national attention. He led the Bourbon Democrats, a pro-business movement opposed to high tariffs, free silver, inflation, imperialism, and subsidies to businesses, farmers, or veterans. His crusade for political reform and fiscal conservatism made him an icon for American conservatives of the time. Cleveland also won praise for honesty, self-reliance, integrity, and commitment to the principles of classical liberalism. His fight against political corruption, patronage, and bossism convinced many like-minded Republicans, called &quot;Mugwumps&quot;, to cross party lines and support him in the 1884 presidential election, which he narrowly won against Republican James G. Blaine.

During his first presidency, Cleveland signed the Interstate Commerce Act of 1887 which made the railroad industry the first industry subject to federal regulation by a regulatory body, and the Dawes Act which subdivided Native American tribal communal landholdings into individual allotments. This policy led to Native Americans ceding control of about two-thirds of their land between 1887 and 1934. In the 1888 election, Cleveland ran against Benjamin Harrison, winning the popular vote but losing the electoral college and therefore the election. After his loss, he returned to New York City and joined a law firm. 

In the 1892 election, Cleveland defeated Harrison in both the popular vote and electoral college, restoring him to the White House. One month before his second administration began, the Panic of 1893 sparked the most severe national depression in U.S. history until the Great Depression in the 1930s. An anti-imperialist, Cleveland opposed the push to annex Hawaii, launched an investigation into the 1893 coup against Queen Liliʻuokalani, and called for her to be restored. Cleveland intervened in the 1894 Pullman Strike to keep the railroads moving, angering Illinois Democrats and labor unions nationwide; his support of the gold standard and opposition to free silver alienated the agrarian wing of the Democrats. Critics complained that Cleveland had little imagination and seemed overwhelmed by the nation&#x27;s economic disasters—depressions and strikes—in his second term. Many voters blamed the Democrats, opening the way for a Republican landslide in 1894 and for the agrarian and Silverite seizure of the Democratic Party in the 1896 election. By the end of his second term, he was severely unpopular, even among Democrats.

After leaving the White House, Cleveland served as a trustee of Princeton University and continued to voice his political views. Cleveland joined the American Anti-Imperialist League in protest of the 1898 Spanish-American War. He died in 1908. Cleveland is typically ranked as an average or below-average U.S. president, due to his handling of the Panic of 1893 and the legacy of the Dawes Act.

==Early life==

===Childhood and family history===

Stephen Grover Cleveland was born on March 18, 1837, in Caldwell, New Jersey, to Ann (née Neal) and Richard Falley Cleveland. Cleveland&#x27;s father was a Congregational and Presbyterian minister who was originally from Connecticut. His mother was from Baltimore and was the daughter of a bookseller. On his father&#x27;s side, Cleveland was descended from English ancestors, the first of the family having emigrated to Massachusetts from Cleveland, England, in 1635.

His father&#x27;s maternal grandfather, Richard Falley Jr., fought at the Battle of Bunker Hill, and was the son of an immigrant from Guernsey. On his mother&#x27;s side, Cleveland was descended from Anglo-Irish Protestants and German Quakers from Philadelphia. Cleveland was distantly related to General Moses Cleaveland, after whom the city of Cleveland, Ohio, was named.

Cleveland, the fifth of nine children, was named Stephen Grover in honor of the first pastor of the First Presbyterian Church of Caldwell, where his father was pastor at the time. He became known as Grover in his adult life. In 1841, the Cleveland family moved to Fayetteville, New York, where Grover spent much of his childhood. Neighbors later described him as &quot;full of fun and inclined to play pranks&quot;, and fond of outdoor sports.

In 1850, Cleveland&#x27;s father Richard moved his family to Clinton, New York, accepting a job there as district secretary for the American Home Missionary Society. Despite his father&#x27;s dedication to his missionary work, his income was insufficient for the large family. Financial conditions forced him to remove Grover from school and place him in a two-year mercantile apprenticeship in Fayetteville. The experience was valuable and brief, and the living conditions quite austere. Grover returned to Clinton and his schooling at the completion of the apprentice contract. In 1853, missionary work began to take a toll on Richard&#x27;s health. He took a new work assignment in Holland Patent, New York (near Utica) and moved his family once again. Shortly after, Richard Cleveland died from a gastric ulcer. Grover was said to have learned about his father&#x27;s death from a boy selling newspapers.

===Education and moving west===

Cleveland received his elementary education at the Fayetteville Academy and the Clinton Grammar School (not the Clinton Liberal Institute). After his father died in 1853, he again left school to help support his family. Later that year, Cleveland&#x27;s brother William was hired as a teacher at the New York Institute for the Blind in New York City, and William obtained a place for Cleveland as an assistant teacher. Cleveland returned home to Holland Patent at the end of 1854, where an elder in his church offered to pay for his college education if he promised to become a minister. Cleveland declined, and in 1855 he decided to move west.

He stopped first in Buffalo, New York, where his uncle-in-law Lewis F. Allen, gave him a clerical job. Allen was an important man in Buffalo, and he introduced his nephew-in-law to influential men there, including the partners in the law firm of Rogers, Bowen, and Rogers. Millard Fillmore, the 13th president of the United States, had previously worked for the partnership. Cleveland later took a clerkship with the firm, began to read the law with them, and was admitted to the New York bar in 1859.

===Early career and the Civil War===
Cleveland worked for the Rogers firm for three years before leaving in 1862 to start his own practice. In January 1863, he was appointed assistant district attorney of Erie County, New York. With the American Civil War raging, Congress passed the Conscription Act of 1863, requiring able-bodied men to serve in the army if called upon, or else to hire a substitute. Cleveland chose the latter course, paying $150, , to George Benninsky, a thirty-two-year-old Polish immigrant, to serve in his place. Benninsky survived the war.

As a lawyer, Cleveland became known for his single-minded concentration and dedication to hard work. In 1866, he successfully defended some participants in the Fenian raid, working on a &quot;pro bono&quot; basis (free of charge). In 1868, Cleveland attracted professional attention for his winning defense of a libel suit against the editor of Buffalo&#x27;s &quot;Commercial Advertiser&quot;. During this time, Cleveland assumed a lifestyle of simplicity, taking residence in a plain boarding house. He devoted his growing income to the support of his mother and younger sisters. While his personal quarters were austere, Cleveland enjoyed an active social life and &quot;the easy-going sociability of hotel-lobbies and saloons&quot;. He shunned the circles of higher society of Buffalo in which his uncle-in-law&#x27;s family traveled.

==Political career in New York==

===Sheriff of Erie County===

From his earliest involvement in politics, Cleveland aligned with the Democratic Party. He had a decided aversion to Republicans John Fremont and Abraham Lincoln, and the heads of the Rogers law firm were solid Democrats. In 1865, he ran for District Attorney, losing narrowly to his friend and roommate, Lyman K. Bass, the Republican nominee.

In 1870, with the help of friend Oscar Folsom, Cleveland secured the Democratic nomination for sheriff of Erie County, New York. He won the election by a 303-vote margin and took office on January 1, 1871, at age 33. While this new career took him away from the practice of law, it was rewarding in other ways: the fees were said to yield up to $40,000, , over the two-year term.

Cleveland&#x27;s service as sheriff was unremarkable. Biographer Rexford Tugwell described the time in office as a waste for Cleveland politically. Cleveland was aware of graft in the sheriff&#x27;s office during his tenure and chose not to confront it. A notable incident of his term took place on September 6, 1872, when Patrick Morrissey was executed. He had been convicted of murdering his mother. As sheriff, Cleveland was responsible for either personally carrying out the execution or paying a deputy $10 to perform the task. In spite of reservations about the hanging, Cleveland executed Morrissey himself. He hanged another murderer, John Gaffney, on February 14, 1873.

After his term as sheriff ended, Cleveland returned to his law practice, opening a firm with his friends Lyman K. Bass and Wilson S. Bissell. Bass was later replaced by George J. Sicard. Elected to Congress in 1872, Bass did not spend much time at the firm, but Cleveland and Bissell soon rose to the top of Buffalo&#x27;s legal community. Up to that point, Cleveland&#x27;s political career had been honorable and unexceptional. As biographer Allan Nevins wrote, &quot;Probably no man in the country, on March 4, 1881, had less thought than this limited, simple, sturdy attorney of Buffalo that four years later he would be standing in Washington and taking the oath as President of the United States.&quot;

It was during this period that Cleveland began courting a widow, Maria Halpin. She later accused him of raping her. It is unclear if Halpin was actually raped by Cleveland as some early reports stated or if their relationship was consensual. In March 1876, Cleveland accused Halpin of being an alcoholic and had her child removed from her custody. The child was taken to the Protestant Orphan Asylum, and Cleveland paid for his stay there. Cleveland had Halpin admitted to the Providence Asylum. Halpin was only kept at the asylum for five days because she was deemed not to be insane. Cleveland later provided financial support for her to begin her own business outside of Buffalo. Although lacking irrefutable evidence that Cleveland was the father, the child became a campaign issue for the Republican Party in Cleveland&#x27;s first presidential campaign, where they smeared him by claiming that he was &quot;immoral&quot; and for allegedly acting cruelly by not raising the child himself.

===Mayor of Buffalo===
In the 1870s, the municipal government in Buffalo had grown increasingly corrupt, with Democratic and Republican political machines cooperating to share the spoils of political office. When the Republicans nominated a slate of particularly disreputable machine politicians for the 1881 election, Democrats saw an opportunity to gain the votes of disaffected Republicans by nominating a more honest candidate. Party leaders approached Cleveland, who agreed to run for Mayor of Buffalo provided the party&#x27;s slate of candidates for other offices was to his liking. More notorious politicians were left off the Democratic ticket and he accepted the nomination. Cleveland was elected mayor that November with 15,120 votes, while his Republican opponent Milton Earl Beebe received 11,528 votes. He took office on January 2, 1882.

Cleveland&#x27;s term as mayor was spent fighting the entrenched interests of the party machines. Among the acts that established his reputation was a veto of the street-cleaning bill passed by the Common Council. The street-cleaning contract had been the subject of competitive bidding, and the Council selected the highest bidder at $422,000, rather than the lowest at $100,000 less, because of the political connections of the bidder. While this sort of bipartisan graft had previously been tolerated in Buffalo, Mayor Cleveland would have none of it. His veto message said, &quot;I regard it as the culmination of a most bare-faced, impudent, and shameless scheme to betray the interests of the people, and to worse than squander the public money.&quot; The Council reversed itself and awarded the contract to the lowest bidder. Cleveland also asked the state legislature to form a Commission to develop a plan to improve the sewer system in Buffalo at a much lower cost than previously proposed locally; this plan was successfully adopted. For this, and other actions safeguarding public funds, Cleveland began to gain a reputation beyond Erie County as a leader willing to purge government corruption.

===Governor of New York===

Democratic party officials started to consider Cleveland a possible nominee for Governor of New York. Daniel Manning, a party insider who admired Cleveland&#x27;s record, was instrumental in his candidacy. With a split in the state Republican Party in 1882, the Democratic party was considered to be at an advantage; several men contended for that party&#x27;s nomination. The two leading Democratic candidates were Roswell P. Flower and Henry Warner Slocum. Their factions deadlocked and the convention could not agree on a nominee. Cleveland, who came in third place on the first ballot, picked up support in subsequent votes and emerged as the compromise choice. With Republicans still divided heading into the general election, Cleveland emerged the victor, receiving 535,318 votes to Republican nominee Charles J. Folger&#x27;s 342,464. Cleveland&#x27;s margin of victory was, at the time, the largest in a contested New York election. The Democrats also picked up seats in both houses of the New York State Legislature.

Cleveland brought his opposition to needless spending to the governor&#x27;s office. He promptly sent the legislature eight vetoes in his first two months in office. The first to attract attention was his veto of a bill to reduce the fares on New York City elevated trains to five cents. The bill had broad support because the trains&#x27; owner, Jay Gould, was unpopular, and his fare increases were widely denounced. Cleveland saw the bill as unjust—Gould had taken over the railroads when they were failing and had made the system solvent again. Cleveland believed that altering Gould&#x27;s franchise would violate the Contract Clause of the federal Constitution. Despite the initial popularity of the fare-reduction bill, the newspapers praised Cleveland&#x27;s veto. Theodore Roosevelt, then a member of the Assembly, had reluctantly voted for the bill with the intention of holding railroad barons accountable. After the veto, Roosevelt and other legislators reversed their position, and Cleveland&#x27;s veto was sustained.

Cleveland&#x27;s defiance of political corruption won him popular acclaim; it also brought the enmity of New York City&#x27;s influential Tammany Hall organization and its boss, John Kelly. Tammany Hall and Kelly had disapproved of Cleveland&#x27;s nomination for governor, and their resistance intensified after Cleveland openly opposed and prevented the reelection of Thomas F. Grady, their point man in the State Senate. Cleveland also steadfastly opposed other Tammany nominees, as well as bills passed as a result of their deal-making. The loss of Tammany&#x27;s support was offset by the support of Theodore Roosevelt and other reform-minded Republicans, who helped Cleveland pass several laws to reform municipal governments. Cleveland closely worked with Roosevelt, who served as assembly minority leader in 1883; the municipal legislation they cooperated on gained Cleveland national recognition.
==Election of 1884==
===Nomination for president===
In June 1884, the Republican Party convened their national convention in Chicago, selecting former U.S. House Speaker James G. Blaine of Maine as their nominee for president. Blaine&#x27;s nomination alienated many Republicans, including the Mugwumps, who viewed Blaine as ambitious and immoral. The Republican standard-bearer was further weakened when the Conkling faction and President Chester Arthur refused to give Blaine their strong support. Democratic party leaders believed the Republicans&#x27; choice gave them an opportunity to win the White House for the first time since 1856 if the right candidate could be found.

Among the Democrats, Samuel J. Tilden was the initial front-runner, having been the party&#x27;s nominee in the contested election of 1876. After Tilden declined a nomination due to his poor health, his supporters shifted to several other contenders. Cleveland was among the leaders in early support, and Thomas F. Bayard of Delaware, Allen G. Thurman of Ohio, Samuel Freeman Miller of Iowa, and Benjamin Butler of Massachusetts also had considerable followings, along with various favorite sons. Each of the other candidates had hindrances to his nomination: Bayard had spoken in favor of secession in 1861, making him unacceptable to Northerners; Butler, conversely, was reviled throughout the Southern United States for his actions during the Civil War; Thurman was generally well-liked, but was growing old and infirm, and his views on the silver question were uncertain.

Cleveland, too, had detractors—Tammany remained opposed to him—but the nature of his enemies made him still more friends. Cleveland led on the first ballot, with 392 votes out of 820. On the second ballot, Tammany threw its support behind Butler, but the rest of the delegates shifted to Cleveland, who won. Thomas A. Hendricks of Indiana was selected as his running mate.

===Campaign against Blaine===
Corruption in politics was the central issue in 1884; Blaine had over the span of his career been involved in several questionable deals. Cleveland&#x27;s reputation as an opponent of corruption proved the Democrats&#x27; strongest asset. William C. Hudson created Cleveland&#x27;s contextual campaign slogan &quot;A public office is a public trust.&quot; Reform-minded Republicans called &quot;Mugwumps&quot; denounced Blaine as corrupt and flocked to Cleveland. The Mugwumps, including such men as Carl Schurz and Henry Ward Beecher, were more concerned with morality than with party, and felt Cleveland was a kindred soul who would promote civil service reform and fight for efficiency in government. At the same time that the Democrats gained support from the Mugwumps, they lost some blue-collar workers to the Greenback-Labor party, led by ex-Democrat Benjamin Butler. In general, Cleveland abided by the precedent of minimizing presidential campaign travel and speechmaking; Blaine became one of the first to break with that tradition.

The campaign focused on the candidates&#x27; moral standards, as each side cast aspersions on their opponents. Cleveland&#x27;s supporters rehashed the old allegations that Blaine had corruptly influenced legislation in favor of the Little Rock and Fort Smith Railroad and the Union Pacific Railway, later profiting on the sale of bonds he owned in both companies. Although the stories of Blaine&#x27;s favors to the railroads had made the rounds eight years earlier, this time Blaine&#x27;s correspondence was discovered, making his earlier denials less plausible. On some of the most damaging correspondence, Blaine had written &quot;Burn this letter&quot;, giving Democrats the last line to their rallying cry: &quot;Blaine, Blaine, James G. Blaine, the continental liar from the state of Maine, &#x27;Burn this letter!

Regarding Cleveland, commentator Jeff Jacoby notes that, &quot;Not since George Washington had a candidate for President been so renowned for his rectitude.&quot; But the Republicans found a refutation buried in Cleveland&#x27;s past. Aided by the sermons of Reverend George H. Ball, a minister from Buffalo, they made public the allegation that Cleveland had fathered a child while he was a lawyer there, and their rallies soon included the chant &quot;Ma, Ma, where&#x27;s my Pa?&quot;. When confronted with the scandal, Cleveland immediately instructed his supporters to &quot;Above all, tell the truth.&quot; He admitted to paying child support in 1874 to Maria Crofts Halpin, the woman who asserted he had fathered her son Oscar Folsom Cleveland and he assumed responsibility. Shortly before the 1884 election, the Republican media published an affidavit from Halpin in which she stated that until she met Cleveland, her &quot;life was pure and spotless&quot;, and &quot;there is not, and never was, a doubt as to the paternity of our child, and the attempt of Grover Cleveland, or his friends, to couple the name of Oscar Folsom, or any one else, with that boy, for that purpose is simply infamous and false.&quot;

The electoral votes of closely contested New York, New Jersey, Indiana, and Connecticut would determine the election. In New York, the Tammany Democrats decided that they would gain more from supporting a Democrat they disliked than a Republican who would do nothing for them. Blaine hoped that he would have more support from Irish Americans than Republicans typically did; while the Irish were mainly a Democratic constituency in the 19th century, Blaine&#x27;s mother was Irish Catholic, and he had been supportive of the Irish National Land League while he was Secretary of State. The Irish, a significant group in three of the swing states, did appear inclined to support Blaine until a Republican, Samuel D. Burchard, gave a speech pivotal for the Democrats, denouncing them as the party of &quot;Rum, Romanism, and Rebellion&quot;. The Democrats spread the word of this implied anti-Catholic insult on the eve of the election. They also blistered Blaine for attending a banquet with some of New York City&#x27;s wealthiest men.

After the votes were counted, Cleveland narrowly won all four of the swing states, including New York by 1,200 votes. While the popular vote total was close, with Cleveland winning by just one-quarter of a percent, the electoral votes gave Cleveland a majority of 219–182. Following the electoral victory, the &quot;Ma, Ma ...&quot; attack phrase gained a classic riposte: &quot;Gone to the White House. Ha! Ha! Ha!&quot;

==First presidency (1885–1889)==
===Reform===
Soon after taking office, Cleveland was faced with the task of filling all the government jobs for which the president had the power of appointment. These jobs were typically filled under the spoils system, but Cleveland announced that he would not fire any Republican who was doing his job well, and would not appoint anyone solely on the basis of party service. He also used his appointment powers to reduce the number of federal employees, as many departments had become bloated with political time-servers. Later in his term, as his fellow Democrats chafed at being excluded from the spoils, Cleveland began to replace more of the partisan Republican officeholders with Democrats; this was especially the case with policymaking positions. While some of his decisions were influenced by party concerns, more of Cleveland&#x27;s appointments were decided by merit alone than was the case in his predecessors&#x27; administrations.

Cleveland also reformed other parts of the government. In 1887, he signed an act creating the Interstate Commerce Commission. He and Secretary of the Navy William C. Whitney undertook to modernize the Navy and canceled construction contracts that had resulted in inferior ships. Cleveland angered railroad investors by ordering an investigation of Western lands they held by government grant. Secretary of the Interior Lucius Q. C. Lamar charged that the rights of way for this land must be returned to the public because the railroads failed to extend their lines according to agreements. The lands were forfeited, resulting in the return of approximately .

Cleveland was the first Democratic president subject to the Tenure of Office Act which originated in 1867; the act purported to require the Senate to approve the dismissal of any presidential appointee who was originally subject to its advice and consent. Cleveland objected to the act in principle and his steadfast refusal to abide by it prompted its fall into disfavor and led to its ultimate repeal in 1887.

===Vetoes===

As Congress and its Republican-led Senate sent Cleveland legislation he opposed, he often resorted to using his veto power. He vetoed hundreds of private pension bills for American Civil War veterans, believing that if their pensions requests had already been rejected by the Pension Bureau, Congress should not attempt to override that decision. When Congress, pressured by the Grand Army of the Republic, passed a bill granting pensions for disabilities not caused by military service, Cleveland also vetoed that. In his first term alone, Cleveland used the veto 414 times, which was more than four times more often than any previous president had used it. In 1887, Cleveland issued his most well-known veto, that of the Texas Seed Bill. After a drought had ruined crops in several Texas counties, Congress appropriated $100,000 () to purchase seed grain for farmers there. Cleveland vetoed the expenditure. In his veto message, he espoused a theory of limited government:
===Silver===
One of the most volatile issues of the 1880s was whether the currency should be backed by gold and silver, or by gold alone. The issue cut across party lines, with Western Republicans and Southern Democrats joining in the call for the free coinage of silver, and both parties&#x27; representatives in the northeast holding firm for the gold standard. Because silver was worth less than its legal equivalent in gold, taxpayers paid their government bills in silver, while international creditors demanded payment in gold, resulting in a depletion of the nation&#x27;s gold supply.

Cleveland and Treasury Secretary Daniel Manning stood firmly on the side of the gold standard, and tried to reduce the amount of silver that the government was required to coin under the Bland–Allison Act of 1878. Cleveland unsuccessfully appealed to Congress to repeal this law before he was inaugurated. Angered Westerners and Southerners advocated for cheap money to help their poorer constituents. In reply, one of the foremost silverites, Richard P. Bland, introduced a bill in 1886 that would require the government to coin unlimited amounts of silver, inflating the then-deflating currency. While Bland&#x27;s bill was defeated, so was a bill the administration favored that would repeal any silver coinage requirement. The result was a retention of the &quot;status quo&quot;, and a postponement of the resolution of the free-silver issue.

===Tariffs===

Another contentious financial issue at the time was the protective tariff. These tariffs had been implemented as a temporary measure during the civil war to protect American industrial interests but remained in place after the war. While it had not been a central point in his campaign, Cleveland&#x27;s opinion on the tariff was that of most Democrats: that the tariff ought to be reduced. Republicans generally favored a high tariff to protect American industries. American tariffs had been high since the Civil War, and by the 1880s the tariff brought in so much revenue that the government was running a surplus.

In 1886, a bill to reduce the tariff was narrowly defeated in the House. The tariff issue was emphasized in the Congressional elections that year, and the forces of protectionism increased their numbers in the Congress, but Cleveland continued to advocate tariff reform. As the surplus grew, Cleveland and the reformers called for a tariff for revenue only. His message to Congress in 1887 (quoted at right) highlighted the injustice of taking more money from the people than the government needed to pay its operating expenses. Republicans, as well as protectionist northern Democrats like Samuel J. Randall, believed that American industries would fail without high tariffs, and they continued to fight reform efforts. Roger Q. Mills, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, proposed a bill to reduce the tariff from about 47% to about 40%. After significant exertions by Cleveland and his allies, the bill passed the House. The Republican Senate failed to come to an agreement with the Democratic House, and the bill died in the conference committee. Dispute over the tariff persisted into the 1888 presidential election.

===Foreign policy, 1885–1889===
Cleveland was a committed noninterventionist who had campaigned in opposition to expansion and imperialism. He refused to promote the previous administration&#x27;s Nicaragua canal treaty, and generally was less of an expansionist in foreign relations. Cleveland&#x27;s Secretary of State, Thomas F. Bayard, negotiated with Joseph Chamberlain of the United Kingdom over fishing rights in the waters off Canada, and struck a conciliatory note, despite the opposition of New England&#x27;s Republican Senators. Cleveland also withdrew from Senate consideration of the Berlin Conference treaty which guaranteed an open door for U.S. interests in the Congo.

===Military policy, 1885–1889===

Cleveland&#x27;s military policy emphasized self-defense and modernization. In 1885 Cleveland appointed the Board of Fortifications under Secretary of War William C. Endicott to recommend a new coastal fortification system for the United States. No improvements to U.S. coastal defenses had been made since the late 1870s. The Board&#x27;s 1886 report recommended a massive $127 million construction program (equivalent to $ billion in ) at 29 harbors and river estuaries, to include new breech-loading rifled guns, mortars, and naval minefields. The Board and the program are usually called the Endicott Board and the Endicott Program. Most of the Board&#x27;s recommendations were implemented, and by 1910, 27 locations were defended by over 70 forts. Many of the weapons remained in place until scrapped in World War II as they were replaced with new defenses. Endicott also proposed to Congress a system of examinations for Army officer promotions. For the Navy, the Cleveland administration, spearheaded by Secretary of the Navy William Collins Whitney, moved towards modernization, although no ships were constructed that could match the best European warships. Although completion of the four steel-hulled warships begun under the previous administration was delayed due to a corruption investigation and subsequent bankruptcy of their building yard, these ships were completed in a timely manner in naval shipyards once the investigation was over. Sixteen additional steel-hulled warships were ordered by the end of 1888. These ships played a vital role during the Spanish–American War of 1898, and many later served in World War I. Among them were the &quot;second-class battleships&quot; and , designed to match modern armored ships recently acquired by South American countries from Europe, such as the Brazilian battleship &quot;Riachuelo&quot;. Eleven protected cruisers (including the famous ), one armored cruiser, and one monitor were also ordered, along with the experimental cruiser .

===Civil rights and immigration===
Under Cleveland, gains in civil rights for African Americans were limited. Cleveland, like a growing number of Northerners and nearly all white Southerners, saw Reconstruction as a failed experiment, and was reluctant to use federal power to enforce the 15th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, which guaranteed voting rights to African Americans. Though Cleveland appointed no black Americans to patronage jobs, he allowed Frederick Douglass to continue in his post as recorder of deeds in Washington, D.C., and appointed another black man (James Campbell Matthews, a former New York judge) to replace Douglass upon his resignation. His decision to replace Douglass with a black man was met with outrage, but Cleveland claimed to have known Matthews personally.

Although Cleveland had condemned the &quot;outrages&quot; against Chinese immigrants, he believed that Chinese immigrants were unwilling to assimilate into white society. Secretary of State Thomas F. Bayard negotiated an extension to the Chinese Exclusion Act, and Cleveland lobbied the Congress to pass the Scott Act, written by Congressman William Lawrence Scott, which prevented the return of Chinese immigrants who left the United States. The Scott Act easily passed both houses of Congress, and Cleveland signed it into law on October 1, 1888.

===Native American policy===
Cleveland viewed Native Americans as wards of the state, saying in his first inaugural address that &quot;[t]his guardianship involves, on our part, efforts for the improvement of their condition and enforcement of their rights.&quot; He encouraged the idea of cultural assimilation, pushing for the passage of the Dawes Act, which would allow lands held in trust by the federal government for the tribes to instead be distributed to individual tribe members. While a conference of Native leaders endorsed the act, in practice the majority of Native Americans disapproved of it. Cleveland believed the Dawes Act would lift Native Americans out of poverty and encourage their assimilation into white society. It ultimately weakened the tribal governments and allowed individual Indians to sell land and keep the money. The act led to Native Americans ceding control of about 100 million acres of land between 1887 and 1934, which was around &quot;two-thirds of the land base they held in 1887.&quot;

In the month before Cleveland&#x27;s 1885 inauguration, President Arthur opened four million acres of Winnebago and Crow Creek Indian lands in the Dakota Territory to white settlement by executive order. Tens of thousands of settlers gathered at the border of these lands and prepared to take possession of them. Cleveland believed Arthur&#x27;s order to be in violation of treaties with the tribes, and rescinded it on April 17 of that year, ordering the settlers out of the territory. Cleveland sent in eighteen companies of Army troops to enforce the treaties and ordered General Philip Sheridan, at the time Commanding General of the U.S. Army, to investigate the matter.
===Marriage and children===
Cleveland was 47 years old when he entered the White House as a bachelor. His sister Rose Cleveland joined him, acting as hostess for the first 15 months of his administration. Unlike the previous bachelor president James Buchanan, Cleveland did not remain a bachelor for long. In 1885, the daughter of Cleveland&#x27;s friend Oscar Folsom visited him in Washington. Frances Folsom was a student at Wells College. When she returned to school, President Cleveland received her mother&#x27;s permission to correspond with her, and they were soon engaged to be married. The wedding occurred on June 2, 1886, in the Blue Room at the White House. Cleveland was 49 years old at the time; Frances was 21. He was the second president to wed while in office and remains the only president to marry in the White House. This marriage was unusual because Cleveland was the executor of Oscar Folsom&#x27;s estate and had supervised Frances&#x27;s upbringing after her father&#x27;s death; nevertheless, the public took no exception to the match. At 21 years, Frances Folsom Cleveland was and remains the youngest First Lady in history, and soon became popular for her warm personality.

The Clevelands had five children: Ruth (1891–1904), Esther (1893–1980), Marion (1895–1977), Richard (1897–1974), and Francis (1903–1995). British philosopher Philippa Foot (1920–2010) was their granddaughter. Ruth contracted diphtheria on January 2, 1904, and died five days after her diagnosis. The Curtiss Candy Company would later assert that the &quot;Baby Ruth&quot; candy bar was named after her. Cleveland also claimed paternity of a child with Maria Crofts Halpin, Oscar Folsom Cleveland, who was born in 1874.

===Administration and Cabinet===


===Judicial appointments===
During his first term, Cleveland successfully nominated two justices to the Supreme Court of the United States. The first, Lucius Q. C. Lamar, was a former Mississippi senator who served in Cleveland&#x27;s Cabinet as Interior Secretary. When William Burnham Woods died, Cleveland nominated Lamar to his seat in late 1887. Lamar&#x27;s nomination was confirmed by the narrow margin of 32 to 28.

Chief Justice Morrison Waite died a few months later, and Cleveland nominated Melville Fuller to fill his seat on April 30, 1888. Fuller accepted. The Senate Judiciary Committee spent several months examining the little-known nominee, before the Senate confirmed the nomination 41 to 20.

Cleveland nominated 41 lower federal court judges in addition to his four Supreme Court justices. These included two judges to the United States circuit courts, nine judges to the United States Courts of Appeals, and 30 judges to the United States district courts.

==Election of 1888 and between terms (1889–1893)==

===Loss to Harrison===

The Republicans nominated Benjamin Harrison, the former U.S. Senator from Indiana for president and Levi P. Morton of New York for vice president. Cleveland was renominated at the Democratic convention in St. Louis. Following Vice President Thomas A. Hendricks&#x27; death in 1885, the Democrats chose Allen G. Thurman of Ohio to be Cleveland&#x27;s new running mate.

The Republicans gained the upper hand in the campaign, as Cleveland&#x27;s campaign was poorly managed by Calvin S. Brice and William H. Barnum, whereas Harrison had engaged more aggressive fundraisers and tacticians in Matt Quay and John Wanamaker.

The Republicans campaigned heavily on the tariff issue, turning out protectionist voters in the important industrial states of the North. Further, the Democrats in New York were divided over the gubernatorial candidacy of David B. Hill, weakening Cleveland&#x27;s support in that swing state. A letter from the British ambassador supporting Cleveland caused a scandal that cost Cleveland votes in New York.

As in 1884, the election focused on the swing states of New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, and Indiana. But unlike that year, when Cleveland had triumphed in all four, in 1888 he won only two, losing his home state of New York by 14,373 votes. Cleveland won a plurality of the popular vote – 48.6 percent vs. 47.8 percent for Harrison – but Harrison won the Electoral College vote easily, 233–168. The Republicans won Indiana, largely as the result of a fraudulent voting practice known as Blocks of Five. Cleveland continued his duties diligently until the end of the term and began to look forward to returning to private life.

===Between terms===
As Frances Cleveland left the White House, she told a staff member, &quot;Now, Jerry, I want you to take good care of all the furniture and ornaments in the house, for I want to find everything just as it is now, when we come back again.&quot; When asked when she would return, she responded, &quot;We are coming back four years from today.&quot; In the meantime, the Clevelands moved to New York City, where Cleveland took a position with the law firm of Bangs, Stetson, Tracy, and MacVeigh. This affiliation was more of an office-sharing arrangement, though quite compatible. Cleveland&#x27;s law practice brought only a moderate income, perhaps because Cleveland spent considerable time at the couple&#x27;s vacation home Gray Gables at Buzzards Bay, Massachusetts, where fishing became his obsession. While they lived in New York, the Clevelands&#x27; first child, Ruth, was born in 1891.

The Harrison administration worked with Congress to pass the McKinley Tariff, an aggressively protectionist measure, and the Sherman Silver Purchase Act, which increased money backed by silver; these were among policies Cleveland deplored as dangerous to the nation&#x27;s financial health. At first he refrained from criticizing his successor, but by 1891 Cleveland felt compelled to speak out, addressing his concerns in an open letter to a meeting of reformers in New York. The &quot;silver letter&quot; thrust Cleveland&#x27;s name back into the spotlight just as the 1892 election was approaching.

==Election of 1892==
===Nomination for president===

Cleveland&#x27;s enduring reputation as chief executive and his recent pronouncements on the monetary issues made him a leading contender for the Democratic nomination. His leading opponent was David B. Hill, a Senator for New York. Hill united the anti-Cleveland elements of the Democratic party—silverites, protectionists, and Tammany Hall—but was unable to create a coalition large enough to deny Cleveland the nomination. Despite some desperate maneuvering by Hill, Cleveland was nominated on the first ballot at the party convention in Chicago.

For vice president, the Democrats chose to balance the ticket with Adlai E. Stevenson of Illinois, a silverite. Although the Cleveland forces preferred Isaac P. Gray of Indiana for vice president, they accepted the convention favorite. As a supporter of greenbacks and free silver to inflate the currency and alleviate economic distress in the rural districts, Stevenson balanced the otherwise hard-money, gold-standard ticket headed by Cleveland.

===Campaign against Harrison===

The Republicans renominated President Harrison, making the 1892 election a rematch of the one four years earlier. Unlike the turbulent and controversial elections of 1876, 1884, and 1888, the 1892 election was, according to Cleveland biographer Allan Nevins, &quot;the cleanest, quietest, and most creditable in the memory of the post-war generation&quot;, in part because Harrison&#x27;s wife, Caroline, was dying of tuberculosis. Harrison did not personally campaign at all. Following Caroline Harrison&#x27;s death on October 25, two weeks before the national election, Cleveland and all of the other candidates stopped campaigning, thus making Election Day a somber and quiet event for the whole country as well as the candidates.

The issue of the tariff had worked to the Republicans&#x27; advantage in 1888. Now, however, the legislative revisions of the past four years had made imported goods so expensive that by 1892, many voters favored tariff reform and were skeptical of big business. Many Westerners (traditionally Republican voters), defected to James B. Weaver, the candidate of the new Populist Party. Weaver promised free silver, generous veterans&#x27; pensions, and an eight-hour work day. The Tammany Hall Democrats adhered to the national ticket, allowing a united Democratic party to carry New York. At the campaign&#x27;s end, many Populists and labor supporters endorsed Cleveland following an attempt by the Carnegie Corporation to break the union during the Homestead strike in Pittsburgh and after a similar conflict between big business and labor at the Tennessee Coal and Iron Co. The final result was a victory for Cleveland by wide margins in both the popular and electoral votes, and it was Cleveland&#x27;s third consecutive popular vote plurality.

Cleveland&#x27;s victory made him the first U.S. president to serve two nonconsecutive terms. He remained the only president to do so until 2025, when Donald J. Trump began a second term after winning the 2024 election; Trump had previously been president from 2017 to 2021.
==Second presidency (1893–1897)==
===Economic panic and the silver issue===

Shortly after Cleveland&#x27;s second term began, the Panic of 1893 struck the stock market, leaving Cleveland and the nation to face an economic depression. The panic was worsened by the acute shortage of gold that resulted from the increased coinage of silver, and Cleveland called Congress into special session to deal with the problem. The debate over the coinage was as heated as ever, and the effects of the panic had driven more moderates to support repealing the coinage provisions of the Sherman Silver Purchase Act. Even so, the silverites rallied their following at a convention in Chicago, and the House of Representatives debated for fifteen weeks before passing the repeal by a considerable margin. In the Senate, the repeal of silver coinage was equally contentious. Cleveland, forced against his better judgment to lobby the Congress for repeal, convinced enough Democrats—and along with eastern Republicans, they formed a 48–37 majority for repeal. Depletion of the Treasury&#x27;s gold reserves continued, at a lesser rate, and subsequent bond issues replenished supplies of gold. At the time the repeal seemed a minor setback to silverites, but it marked the beginning of the end of silver as a basis for American currency.

===Tariff reform===
Having succeeded in reversing the Harrison administration&#x27;s silver policy, Cleveland sought next to reverse the effects of the McKinley Tariff. The Wilson–Gorman Tariff Act was introduced by West Virginian Representative William L. Wilson in December 1893. After lengthy debate, the bill passed the House by a considerable margin. The bill proposed moderate downward revisions in the tariff, especially on raw materials. The shortfall in revenue was to be made up by an income tax of two percent on income above $4,000 ().

The bill was next considered in the Senate, where it faced stronger opposition from key Democrats, led by Arthur Pue Gorman of Maryland, who insisted that more protection for their states&#x27; industries be added. The bill passed the Senate with more than 600 amendments attached that nullified most of the reforms. The Sugar Trust in particular lobbied for changes that favored it at the expense of the consumer. Cleveland was outraged with the final bill, and denounced it as a disgraceful product of the control of the Senate by trusts and business interests. Even so, he believed it was an improvement over the McKinley tariff and allowed it to become law without his signature.

===Voting rights===
In 1892, Cleveland had campaigned against the Lodge Bill, which would have strengthened voting rights protections through the appointing of federal supervisors of congressional elections upon a petition from the citizens of any district. The Enforcement Act of 1871 had provided for a detailed federal overseeing of the electoral process, from registration to the certification of returns. Cleveland succeeded in ushering in the 1894 repeal of this law (ch. 25, 28 Stat. 36). The pendulum thus swung from stronger attempts to protect voting rights to the repealing of voting rights protections; this in turn led to unsuccessful attempts to have the federal courts protect voting rights in &quot;Giles v. Harris&quot;, 189 U.S. 475 (1903), and &quot;Giles v. Teasley&quot;, 193 U.S. 146 (1904).

===Labor unrest===
The Panic of 1893 had damaged labor conditions across the United States, and the victory of anti-silver legislation worsened the mood of western laborers. A group of workingmen led by Jacob S. Coxey began to march east toward Washington, D.C., to protest Cleveland&#x27;s policies. This group, known as Coxey&#x27;s Army, agitated in favor of a national roads program to give jobs to workingmen, and a weakened currency to help farmers pay their debts. By the time they reached Washington, only a few hundred remained, and when Coxey and other protest leaders were arrested the next day for walking on the lawn of the United States Capitol, the group scattered. Even though Coxey&#x27;s Army may not have been a threat to the government, it signaled a growing dissatisfaction in the West with Eastern monetary policies.

===Pullman Strike===

The Pullman Strike had a significantly greater impact than Coxey&#x27;s Army. A strike began against the Pullman Company over low wages and twelve-hour workdays, and sympathy strikes, led by American Railway Union leader Eugene V. Debs, soon followed. By June 1894, 125,000 railroad workers were on strike, paralyzing the nation&#x27;s commerce. Because the railroads carried the mail, and because several of the affected lines were in federal receivership, Cleveland believed a federal solution was appropriate. Cleveland obtained an injunction in federal court, and when the strikers refused to obey it, he sent federal troops into Chicago and 20 other rail centers. &quot;If it takes the entire army and navy of the United States to deliver a postcard in Chicago&quot;, he proclaimed, &quot;that card will be delivered.&quot; Most governors supported Cleveland except Democrat John P. Altgeld of Illinois, who became his bitter foe in 1896. Leading newspapers of both parties applauded Cleveland&#x27;s actions, but the use of troops hardened the attitude of organized labor toward his administration.

Just before the 1894 election, Cleveland was warned by Francis Lynde Stetson, an advisor: &quot;We are on the eve of [a] very dark night, unless a return of commercial prosperity relieves popular discontent with what they believe [is] Democratic incompetence to make laws, and consequently [discontent] with Democratic Administrations anywhere and everywhere.&quot; The warning was appropriate, for in the Congressional elections, Republicans won their biggest landslide in decades, taking full control of the House, while the Populists lost most of their support. Cleveland&#x27;s factional enemies gained control of the Democratic Party in state after state, including full control in Illinois and Michigan, and made major gains in Ohio, Indiana, Iowa and other states. Wisconsin and Massachusetts were two of the few states that remained under the control of Cleveland&#x27;s allies. The Democratic opposition were close to controlling two-thirds of the vote at the 1896 national convention, which they needed to nominate their own candidate. They failed for lack of unity and a national leader, as Illinois governor John Peter Altgeld had been born in Germany and was ineligible to be nominated for president.

===Foreign policy, 1893–1897===

When Cleveland took office, he faced the question of Hawaiian annexation. In his first term, he had supported free trade with the Hawaiian Kingdom and accepted an amendment that gave the United States a coaling and naval station in Pearl Harbor. A treaty of peace and friendship existed between the United States and Hawai&#x27;i. In the intervening four years, however, Honolulu businessmen of European and American ancestry had denounced Queen Liliuokalani as a tyrant who rejected constitutional government. In January 1893 they overthrew her, set up a provisional government under Sanford B. Dole, and sought to join the United States.

The Harrison administration had quickly agreed with representatives of the new government on a treaty of annexation and submitted it to the Senate for approval. However, the presence in Honolulu of U.S. Marines from the USS &quot;Boston&quot; while the coup unfolded, deployed at the request of U.S. Minister to Hawaii John L. Stevens, caused serious controversy. Five days after taking office on March 9, 1893, Cleveland withdrew the treaty from the Senate and sent former Congressman James Henderson Blount to Hawai&#x27;i to investigate the situation.

Cleveland agreed with Blount&#x27;s report, which found the native Hawaiians to be opposed to annexation; the report also found U.S. diplomatic and military involvement in the coup. It included over a thousand pages of documents. A firm anti-imperialist, Cleveland opposed American actions in Hawaii and called for the queen to be restored; he disapproved of the new provisional government under Dole. But matters stalled when Liliuokalani initially refused to grant amnesty as a condition for regaining her throne, saying she would either execute or banish the new leadership in Honolulu. Dole&#x27;s government was in full control and rejected her demands. By December 1893, the matter was still unresolved, and Cleveland referred the issue to Congress. Cleveland delivered a message to Congress dated December 18, 1893, rejecting annexation and encouraging Congress to continue the American tradition of nonintervention (see excerpt at right). He expressed himself in forceful terms, saying the presence of U.S. forces near the Hawaiian government building and royal palace during the coup was a &quot;substantial wrong&quot; and an &quot;act of war,&quot; and lambasted the actions of minister Stevens. Cleveland described the incident as the &quot;subversion of the constitutional Government of Hawaii,&quot; and argued &quot;it has been the settled policy of the United States to concede to people of foreign countries the same freedom and independence in the management of their domestic affairs that we have always claimed for ourselves.&quot;

The House of Representatives adopted a resolution against annexation and voted to censure the U.S. minister. However the Senate, under Democratic control but opposed to Cleveland, commissioned and produced the Morgan Report, which contradicted Blount&#x27;s findings and found the overthrow was a completely internal affair. Senator John Tyler Morgan of Alabama, chairman of the U.S. Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, oversaw the report. It declared that the &quot;action of the Queen in an effort to overturn the constitution of 1887...amounted to an act of abdication on her part.&quot; The &quot;constitution of 1887&quot; mentioned in the report was the so-called Bayonet Constitution, which King Kalakaua had signed under pressure that year. The Morgan Report said that the troops landed on Oahu from the USS &quot;Boston&quot; gave &quot;no demonstration of actual hostilities,&quot; and described their conduct as &quot;quiet&quot; and &quot;respectful.&quot; The United States already had a presence in the region, and acquired exclusive rights to enter and establish a naval base at Pearl Harbor in 1887, when the Reciprocity Treaty of 1875 was renewed during Cleveland&#x27;s first term. Cleveland dropped his push to restore the queen, and went on to recognize and maintain diplomatic relations with the new Republic of Hawaii under President Dole, who took office in July 1894.

Closer to home, Cleveland adopted a broad interpretation of the Monroe Doctrine that not only prohibited new European colonies, but also declared an American national interest in any matter of substance within the hemisphere. When Britain and Venezuela disagreed over the boundary between Venezuela and the colony of British Guiana, Cleveland and Secretary of State Richard Olney protested. British Prime Minister Lord Salisbury and the British ambassador to Washington, Julian Pauncefote, misjudged how important the dispute was to Washington, and to the anti-British Irish Catholic element in Cleveland&#x27;s Democratic Party. They prolonged the crisis before accepting the American demand for arbitration. An international tribunal in 1899 awarded the bulk of the disputed territory to British Guiana. But by standing with a Latin American nation against the encroachment of a colonial power, Cleveland improved relations with Latin America. The cordial manner in which the arbitration was conducted also strengthened relations with Britain and encouraged the major powers to consider arbitration as a way to settle their disputes.

===Military policy, 1893–1897===
The second Cleveland administration was as committed to military modernization as the first, and ordered the first ships of a navy capable of offensive action. Construction continued on the Endicott program of coastal fortifications begun under Cleveland&#x27;s first administration. The adoption of the Krag–Jørgensen rifle, the U.S. Army&#x27;s first bolt-action repeating rifle, was finalized. In 1895–1896 Secretary of the Navy Hilary A. Herbert, having recently adopted the aggressive naval strategy advocated by Captain Alfred Thayer Mahan, successfully proposed ordering five battleships (the and es) and sixteen torpedo boats. Completion of these ships nearly doubled the Navy&#x27;s battleships and created a new torpedo boat force, which previously had only two boats. The battleships and seven of the torpedo boats were not completed until 1899–1901, after the Spanish–American War.

===Cancer===

In the midst of the fight for repeal of free-silver coinage in 1893, Cleveland sought the advice of the White House doctor, Robert O&#x27;Reilly, about soreness on the roof of his mouth and a crater-like edge ulcer with a granulated surface on the left side of Cleveland&#x27;s hard palate. Clinical samples were sent anonymously to the Army Medical Museum; the diagnosis was an epithelioma, rather than a malignant cancer.

Cleveland decided to have surgery secretly, to avoid further panic that might worsen the financial depression. The surgery occurred on July 1, to give Cleveland time to make a full recovery in time for the upcoming Congressional session. Under the guise of a vacation cruise, Cleveland and his surgeon, Dr. Joseph Bryant, left for New York. The surgeons operated aboard the &quot;Oneida&quot;, a yacht owned by Cleveland&#x27;s friend Elias Cornelius Benedict, as it sailed off Long Island. The surgery was conducted through the President&#x27;s mouth, to avoid any scars or other signs of surgery. The team, sedating Cleveland with nitrous oxide and ether, successfully removed parts of his upper left jaw and hard palate. The size of the tumor and the extent of the operation left Cleveland&#x27;s mouth disfigured. During another surgery, Cleveland was fitted with a hard rubber dental prosthesis that corrected his speech and restored his appearance. A cover story about the removal of two bad teeth kept the suspicious press placated. Even when a newspaper story appeared giving details of the actual operation, the participating surgeons discounted the severity of what transpired during Cleveland&#x27;s vacation. In 1917, one of the surgeons present on the &quot;Oneida&quot;, Dr. William Williams Keen, wrote an article detailing the operation.

Cleveland enjoyed many years of life after the tumor was removed, and there was some debate as to whether it was actually malignant. Several doctors, including Dr. Keen, stated after Cleveland&#x27;s death that the tumor was a carcinoma.
Other suggestions included ameloblastoma or a benign salivary mixed tumor (also known as a pleomorphic adenoma).
In the 1980s, analysis of the specimen finally confirmed the tumor to be verrucous carcinoma, a low-grade epithelial cancer with a low potential for metastasis.
===Administration and cabinet===

===Judicial appointments===

Cleveland&#x27;s trouble with the Senate hindered the success of his nominations to the Supreme Court in his second term. In 1893, after the death of Samuel Blatchford, Cleveland nominated William B. Hornblower to the Court. Hornblower, the head of a New York City law firm, was thought to be a qualified appointee, but his campaign against a New York machine politician had made Senator David B. Hill his enemy. Further, Cleveland had not consulted the Senators before naming his appointee, leaving many who were already opposed to Cleveland on other grounds even more aggrieved. The Senate rejected Hornblower&#x27;s nomination on January 15, 1894, by a vote of 24 to 30.

Cleveland continued to defy the Senate by next appointing Wheeler Hazard Peckham another New York attorney who had opposed Hill&#x27;s machine in that state. Hill used all of his influence to block Peckham&#x27;s confirmation, and on February 16, 1894, the Senate rejected the nomination by a vote of 32 to 41. Reformers urged Cleveland to continue the fight against Hill and to nominate Frederic R. Coudert, but Cleveland acquiesced in an inoffensive choice, that of Senator Edward Douglass White of Louisiana, whose nomination was accepted unanimously. Later, in 1895, another vacancy on the Court led Cleveland to consider Hornblower again, but he declined to be nominated. Instead, Cleveland nominated Rufus Wheeler Peckham, the brother of Wheeler Hazard Peckham, and the Senate confirmed the second Peckham easily.

===States admitted to the Union===
No new states were admitted to the Union during Cleveland&#x27;s first term. On February 22, 1889, days before leaving office, the 50th Congress passed the Enabling Act of 1889, authorizing North Dakota, South Dakota, Montana, and Washington to form state governments and to gain admission to the Union. All four officially became states in November 1889, during the first year of the Benjamin Harrison administration. During Cleveland&#x27;s second term, the 53rd United States Congress passed an Enabling Act that permitted Utah to apply for statehood. Cleveland signed it on July 16, 1894. Utah joined the Union as the 45th state on January 4, 1896.

==Election of 1896 and retirement (1897–1908)==

Cleveland&#x27;s agrarian and silverite enemies took control of state Democratic parties over the course of his second term, such that Cleveland&#x27;s pro-gold ideology was marginalized outside of urban areas in solidly Democratic states such as Arkansas. They gained control of the national Democratic Party in 1896, repudiated his administration and the gold standard, and nominated William Jennings Bryan on a free-silver platform. Cleveland silently supported the Gold Democrats&#x27; third-party ticket that promised to defend the gold standard, limit government, and oppose high tariffs, but he declined their nomination for a third term. The party won only 100,000 votes in the general election, and William McKinley, the Republican nominee, triumphed easily over Bryan. Agrarians nominated Bryan again in 1900. In 1904, the conservatives, with Cleveland&#x27;s support, regained control of the Democratic Party and nominated Alton B. Parker.

After leaving the White House on March 4, 1897, Cleveland lived in retirement at his estate, Westland Mansion, in Princeton, New Jersey. He was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 1897. For a time, he was a trustee of Princeton University, and was one of the majority of trustees who preferred the dean Andrew Fleming West&#x27;s plans for the Graduate School and undergraduate living over those of Woodrow Wilson, then president of the university. Cleveland consulted occasionally with President Theodore Roosevelt (1901–1909) but was financially unable to accept the chairmanship of the commission handling the Coal Strike of 1902. Cleveland still made his views known in political matters. In a 1905 article in &quot;The Ladies Home Journal&quot;, Cleveland weighed in on the women&#x27;s suffrage movement, writing that &quot;sensible and responsible women do not want to vote. The relative positions to be assumed by men and women in the working out of our civilization were assigned long ago by a higher intelligence.&quot;

In 1906, a group of New Jersey Democrats promoted Cleveland as a possible candidate for the United States Senate. The incumbent, John F. Dryden, was not seeking reelection, and some Democrats felt that the former president could attract the votes of some disaffected Republican legislators who might be drawn to Cleveland&#x27;s statesmanship and conservatism.

== Death ==

Cleveland&#x27;s health had been declining for several years, and in the autumn of 1907, he fell seriously ill. In 1908, he suffered a heart attack and died on June 24 at age 71 in his Princeton residence. His last words were, &quot;I have tried so hard to do right.&quot; He is buried at Princeton Cemetery of the Nassau Presbyterian Church.

==Honors and memorials==
In his first term in office, Cleveland sought a summer house to escape the heat and smells of Washington, D.C. He secretly bought a farmhouse, Oak View (or Oak Hill), in a then rural upland part of the District of Columbia, in 1886, and remodeled it into a Queen Anne style summer estate. He sold Oak View upon losing his bid for reelection in 1888. Not long thereafter, suburban residential development reached the area, which came to be known as Oak View, and then Cleveland Heights, and eventually Cleveland Park. The Clevelands are depicted in local murals.

Grover Cleveland Hall at Buffalo State University in New York is named after Cleveland. Cleveland was a member of the first board of directors of the then Buffalo Normal School. Grover Cleveland Middle School in his birthplace, Caldwell, New Jersey, was named for him, as is Grover Cleveland High School (Buffalo, New York), the town of Cleveland, Mississippi, and Mount Cleveland in Alaska.

In 1895, he became the first U.S. president who was filmed. The first U.S. postage stamp to honor Cleveland appeared in 1923. His only two subsequent stamp appearances have been in issues devoted to the full roster of U.S. Presidents, released, respectively, in 1938 and 1986.

Cleveland&#x27;s portrait was on the U.S. $1000 bill of series 1928 and series 1934. He also appeared on the first few issues of the $20 Federal Reserve Notes from 1914. Since he was both the 22nd and 24th president, he was featured on two separate dollar coins released in 2012 as part of the Presidential $1 Coin Act of 2005. In 2013, Cleveland was inducted into the New Jersey Hall of Fame.

<doc id="12499" wikidata="Q216695" url="?curid=12499" title="Gregorio Allegri">
<text>Gregorio Allegri (17 February 1652) was an Italian Catholic priest and composer of the Roman School and brother of Domenico Allegri; he was also a singer. He was born and died in Rome. He is chiefly known for his &quot;Miserere&quot; for two choirs.

==Life==
He studied music as a &quot;puer&quot; (boy chorister) at San Luigi dei Francesi, under the &quot;maestro di cappella&quot; Giovanni Bernardino Nanino, brother of Giovanni Maria Nanino. Being intended for the Church, he obtained a benefice in the cathedral of Fermo. Here he composed a large number of motets and other sacred music, which, being brought to the notice of Pope Urban VIII, obtained for him an appointment in the choir of the Sistine Chapel at Rome as a contralto. He held this from 6 December 1629 until his death. Allegri is said to have been a virtuous man, as well as good-natured and generous to the poor and to prisoners.

Among Allegri&#x27;s musical compositions were two volumes of concerti for five voices published in 1618 and 1619; two volumes of motets for six voices published in 1621; an edition of a four-part sinfonia; five masses; two settings of the &quot;Lamentations of Jeremiah&quot;; and numerous motets which were not published in his lifetime. He was one of the earliest composers for stringed instruments, and Athanasius Kircher has given one specimen of this class of his works in his &quot;Musurgia Universalis&quot;. Most of Allegri&#x27;s published music, especially the instrumental music, is in the progressive early Baroque concertato style. However, his work for the Sistine Chapel is descended from the Palestrina style, and in some cases strips even this refined, simple style of almost all localised ornamentation. He is credited with the earliest string quartet.

==The &quot;Miserere&quot;==
By far the best-known and regarded piece of music composed by Allegri is the &quot;Miserere mei, Deus&quot;, a setting of Vulgate Psalm 50 (= Psalm 51). It is written for two choirs, the one of five and the other of four voices, and has obtained considerable celebrity. One of the choirs sings a simple &quot;fauxbourdon&quot; based on the original plainsong chant for the &quot;Tonus peregrinus&quot;; the other choir sings a similar &quot;fauxbourdon&quot; with pre-existing elaborations and the use of cadenzas. The &quot;Miserere&quot; has for many years been sung annually during Holy Week in the Sistine Chapel in the Vatican. Many have cited this work as an example of the &quot;stile antico&quot; (old style) or &quot;prima pratica&quot; (first practice). However, its emphasis on polychoral techniques certainly put it out of the range of &quot;prima pratica.&quot; A more accurate comparison would be to the works of Giovanni Gabrieli.

The &quot;Miserere&quot; is one of the most often-recorded examples of late Renaissance music, although it was actually written during the chronological confines of the Baroque era; in this regard it is representative of the music of the Roman School of composers, who were stylistically conservative. The work acquired a considerable reputation for mystery and inaccessibility between the time of its composition and the era of modern recording; the Vatican, wanting to preserve its aura of mystery, forbade copies, threatening any publication or attempted copy with excommunication. They were not prepared, however, for a special visit in 1770 from a 14-year-old named Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, who, on a trip to Rome with his father, heard it but twice and transcribed it faithfully from memory, thus creating the first known unauthorised copy. However, there is evidence that copies of the work that pre-date Mozart&#x27;s visit to Rome in 1770 had already been circulating in Europe, and Mozart may have heard the piece performed in London in 1764 or 1765 as well.

In 1771 Mozart&#x27;s copy was procured and published in England by the famous traveller and music historian Dr Charles Burney. However, Burney&#x27;s edition does not show the ornamentation for which the work was famous.

The music as it is performed today includes a strange error by a copyist in the 1880s. The curious &quot;trucker&#x27;s gear change&quot; from G minor to C minor is because the second half of the verse is the same as the first half, but transposed up a fourth. The original never had a Top C.

The entire music performed at Rome in Holy Week, Allegri&#x27;s &quot;Miserere&quot; included, has been issued at Leipzig by Breitkopf and Härtel. Interesting accounts of the impression produced by the performance at Rome may be found in the first volume of Felix Mendelssohn&#x27;s letters and in Miss Taylor&#x27;s &quot;Letters from Italy&quot;.

<doc id="12501" wikidata="Q212738" url="?curid=12501" title="Geoff Hurst">
<text>Sir Geoffrey Charles Hurst (born 8 December 1941) is an English former professional footballer. A striker, he became the first player to score a hat-trick in a World Cup final, as England recorded a 4–2 victory over West Germany at Wembley in 1966. With the death of Sir Bobby Charlton in October 2023, Hurst became the last living player from the team that won the 1966 final.

Hurst began his career with West Ham United, where he scored 242 goals in 500 first team appearances. There he won the FA Cup in 1964 and the European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup in 1965. He was sold to Stoke City in 1972 for £80,000. After three seasons with Stoke, where he won the Watney Cup in 1973, he finished his Football League career with West Bromwich Albion in 1976. Hurst went to play football in Ireland (Cork Celtic) and the United States (Seattle Sounders), before returning to England to manage non-league Telford United. He also coached in the England set-up before a two-year stint as Chelsea manager from 1979 to 1981. He later coached Kuwait SC, before leaving the game to concentrate on his business commitments.

In total, Hurst scored 24 goals in 49 England appearances, and as well as success in the 1966 World Cup he also appeared at UEFA Euro 1968 and the 1970 FIFA World Cup. He also had a brief cricket career, making one first-class appearance for Essex in 1962, before concentrating on football.

==Early life==
Hurst was born in Ashton-under-Lyne, Lancashire, England, on 8 December 1941. He had two younger siblings: Diane and Robert. His family moved to Chelmsford, Essex when he was six years old. His father, Charlie Hurst, was a professional footballer who played at centre-half for Bristol Rovers, Oldham Athletic and Rochdale. His mother, Evelyn Hopkins, was from a Gloucestershire family, with her mother&#x27;s side originally from Germany. As a teenager he was obsessed with football, and was once fined £1 for disturbing the peace after persistently kicking a football into his neighbour&#x27;s garden.

Hurst played one first-class cricket match for Essex, against Lancashire at Aigburth in 1962, although it was not a successful outing: he made 0 not out in the first innings, and was bowled by Colin Hilton, again for 0, in the second. However, he appeared 23 times in the Essex Second XI between 1962 and 1964, usually as a wicket-keeper, before concentrating entirely on football.

Under his father&#x27;s management of the club, Hurst played once for Halstead Town reserves at the age of &quot;about 14&quot;.

==Club career==
===West Ham United===
Hurst&#x27;s football career began when he was apprenticed to West Ham United at the age of 15. He played alongside Bobby Moore in the 1959 FA Youth Cup final team that lost to Blackburn Rovers (1–2 on aggregate), but both were also in the team that won the Southern Junior Floodlit Cup (1–0 v Chelsea) later that year. Manager Ted Fenton first selected him for a senior game in a Southern Floodlit Cup tie with Fulham in December 1958. He turned professional at the club four months later, and was paid £7 a week with a £20 signing-on fee. His first competitive appearance came in February 1960 when injuries forced Fenton&#x27;s hand; Hurst put in an indifferent performance and the team lost 3–1. He made only two further appearances in the 1959–60 season, and realised that Bobby Moore was making better progress in the same position than he was. He played six times in the 1960–61 campaign and seriously considered turning his main focus to cricket. In April 1961 Ron Greenwood took over as manager, and drastically changed team training by putting a focus on footballing skill rather than physical fitness.

Hurst missed the start of 1961–62 pre-season training due to his cricketing commitments, but went on to make 24 appearances at left-half, and scored his first goal for the club in a 4–2 victory over Wolverhampton Wanderers in December 1961. However, he again missed pre-season training the following summer and was dropped after proving to be unfit during the opening game of the 1962–63 season. In September of that season Greenwood tried playing Hurst as a striker, after deciding that the defensive side of his game was a weakness for the young midfielder. He formed a successful partnership with Johnny Byrne and went on to score 13 goals in 27 First Division games whilst Byrne scored nine in 30 games in the 1962–63 season. In the summer of 1963 he joined the club on their pre-season tour of New York, and greatly benefited from playing against top-quality players from clubs across the world in the International Soccer League, a friendly tournament.

Hurst and West Ham had a poor start to the 1963–64 season, and went on to finish in 14th place. However, it was in the FA Cup where the team impressed. A comfortable 3–0 home win over Second Division Charlton Athletic was followed by another 3–0 home win over East End rivals Leyton Orient – though only following a tough 1–1 draw at Brisbane Road. Greenwood named the same 11 players, including Hurst, in all the club&#x27;s seven FA Cup fixtures as West Ham progressed to the final. Hurst scored one against Charlton and two against Orient, and claimed another goal in the fifth round as West Ham beat Second Division Swindon Town 3–1 at the County Ground. Burnley provided a stern test in the quarter-finals, but a 3–2 home win took West Ham into the semi-finals, where they faced Manchester United at Hillsborough. West Ham won 3–1, with Hurst scoring the final goal of the game after being set up by Bobby Moore. West Ham faced Second Division Preston North End at Wembley in the 1964 FA Cup Final, and had to come from behind twice to win the match 3–2. Hurst scored his side&#x27;s second equaliser with a header that bounced under the crossbar and ended up just over the goal line.

The club&#x27;s success won them a place in the European Cup Winners Cup for the 1964–65 season. They defeated Belgian side K.A.A. Gent in the First Round after an unconvincing 2–1 aggregate victory. Czechoslovakian side AC Sparta Prague awaited in the second round, and West Ham progressed with a 3–2 aggregate victory despite the absence of Moore. Despite beating Swiss team FC Lausanne-Sport 6–4 on aggregate in the quarter-finals, Hurst had still not registered a goal in the competition as he was played in a withdrawn role behind Johnny Byrne so as to strengthen the midfield. In the semi-finals, West Ham defended a 2–1 home win over Spanish club Real Zaragoza with a 1–1 draw at La Romareda to claim a place in the 1965 European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup Final against TSV 1860 München at Wembley. West Ham won 2–0, Alan Sealey scoring both goals, to give the club their first European trophy.

Having scored 40 goals in 59 competitive games in the 1965–66 season and then gone on to make himself a household name by winning the World Cup with England, Hurst was the subject of a £200,000 transfer offer by Manchester United manager Matt Busby – the offer was rejected by Greenwood. He was in the West Ham side which lost the League Cup final, 5–3 on aggregate to West Bromwich Albion.

In the 1966–67 season, West Ham demonstrated the inconsistency that would deny them a realistic prospect of winning a league championship under Greenwood. Hurst scored a hat-trick as they defeated full-strength title challengers Leeds United 7–0 in the League Cup, but they exited the FA Cup with a 3–1 defeat to Third Division side Swindon Town.

Hurst scored six goals in a First Division match against Sunderland at Upton Park on 19 October 1968, which West Ham won 8–0. However, he regretted admitting that he handled the ball in his first goal which led to the back page headlines focusing on the illegitimate goal rather than the rare feat of one player scoring six goals in one game.

In 1972, West Ham reached the semi-finals of the League Cup when they played Stoke City over two legs. In the home leg at Upton Park, they were awarded a penalty after Harry Redknapp was fouled in the box. Hurst took the penalty and struck a powerful shot into the top corner which was saved by Gordon Banks, who succeeded in deflecting the ball over the bar. Stoke won the tie in the subsequent replay and denied Hurst one more final appearance at Wembley.

===Stoke City===
Hurst was sold to Stoke City for a £80,000 fee in August 1972. He was struck down with pneumonia early in 1973 and went to South Africa to recover, playing on loan for Roy Bailey&#x27;s Cape Town City. He missed just four games for Stoke and upon his return he helped the side to maintain their First Division status.

In January 1974, &quot;Potters&quot; manager Tony Waddington asked Hurst to take in new signing Alan Hudson as a lodger so as to provide the talented but troubled midfielder with a stable home during his Stoke career. Hudson adapted well to life in the Hurst household and Stoke recorded a fifth place in the 1973–74 season – a career high for Hurst.

Hurst scored 11 goals in 41 games in the 1974–75 season and helped Stoke to finish in fifth place, just four points behind champions Derby County.

===West Bromwich Albion===
Hurst was sold to Johnny Giles&#x27;s West Bromwich Albion in the summer of 1975 for a fee of £20,000. He played 12 times for the Baggies at the start of the 1975–76 season, scoring twice, before deciding to leave for America. Hurst later acknowledged that at the age of 34 he was too old to lead the line in the &quot;Baggies&quot; push for promotion out of the Second Division.

===Later career===
Hurst signed for Cork Celtic in January 1976, and remained in Ireland for one month.

He signed for the Seattle Sounders of the NASL in 1976. Hurst rapidly proved his worth, and became a valuable member of the Sounders team. He was the team&#x27;s second-leading scorer, helping the Sounders make it to the play-offs for the first time in their brief history, with eight goals and four assists in 23 regular season games, and one goal in the play-offs.

==International career==
===1966 World Cup===
Hurst made his senior England debut against West Germany on 23 February 1966. He played well, and further performances against Scotland and Yugoslavia secured him a place in the squad for the 1966 FIFA World Cup. However, he put in mediocre performances in warm-up games against Finland and Denmark, and so Jimmy Greaves and Roger Hunt were instead picked for the final friendly game against Poland. Greaves and Hunt were picked for the three group games against Uruguay, Mexico and France, but in the latter game, Greaves suffered a deep gash to his leg which required stitches, and Hurst was called up to take his place in the quarter-final against Argentina.

Argentina were talented but preferred a tougher approach to the game, which saw them reduced to ten men. The game was still tightly contested as it entered its final 15 minutes, before Martin Peters swung over a curling cross from the left flank and Hurst, anticipating his clubmate&#x27;s action, got in front of his marker to glance a near post header past the Argentine keeper. England won 1–0 and were in the semi-finals.

Greaves was not fit for the game against Portugal so Hurst and Hunt continued up front, and England won 2–1 thanks to two goals by Bobby Charlton, the second of which was set up by Hurst. As the final against the Germans approached, the media learnt of Greaves&#x27; return to fitness and, while appreciating Hurst&#x27;s contribution, started to call for the return of England&#x27;s most prolific centre forward. Ramsey, however, would not be swayed and selected Hurst for the final.

====World Cup Final====
West Germany took the lead through Helmut Haller early on, but six minutes later Bobby Moore was fouled just inside the German half of the field. He quickly picked himself up and delivered the free kick to Hurst, who eluded his marker 
Horst-Dieter Höttges and headed the ball past goalkeeper Hans Tilkowski to level the scores at 1–1.

With 12 minutes left to play of normal time, an Alan Ball corner left Hurst with a shooting opportunity on the edge of the penalty area; his shot deflected off Wolfgang Weber and fell kindly to Martin Peters, who put the ball into the net to give England the lead. However the Germans scored a very late goal through Weber to level the match at 2–2 at full-time.

In the first period of extra-time, Ball crossed from the right to Hurst, who struck a strong shot towards goal with his right foot, falling backwards as he did so. The ball beat the goalkeeper, hit the crossbar and bounced down before Weber headed it out for a corner. England&#x27;s players claimed a goal while the Germans were adamant that the ball had not fully crossed the line. Referee Gottfried Dienst consulted his linesman on the right flank, Tofiq Bahramov, who signalled that the ball had crossed the line, and the goal was given. The so-called Wembley Goal remained a subject for controversy and discussions.

The Germans pushed forward in search of an equaliser as the full-time whistle approached, and Bobby Moore exploited their advanced position to send Hurst a long ball in the German half of the pitch. Hurst reached the German penalty box and scored to end the game at 4–2 to England. As Hurst collected the pass, BBC commentator Kenneth Wolstenholme delivered with one of the most famous pieces of football commentary:

Hurst thus became the first player to score a hat-trick in the Men&#x27;s World Cup final, a feat that remained unmatched until 2022, when Kylian Mbappé scored a hat-trick for France against Argentina. Geoff Hurst, however, remains the only man to score a hattrick in a World Cup Final and end up on the winning team.

===Later international career===
Hurst was selected for UEFA Euro 1968, but did not play as England lost 1–0 to Yugoslavia in the semi-final. He did play, and score, in the 2–0 third-place play-off victory over the Soviet Union at the Stadio Olimpico.

Hurst scored his second international hat-trick on 12 March 1969, in a 5–0 victory over France, and was named in the Ramsey squad which played in Mexico to defend the World Cup in 1970. He scored the only goal of England&#x27;s opening game against Romania after being sent through by a pass from Francis Lee. England progressed to the quarter-finals, where once again they faced West Germany. Hurst played a part in the Martin Peters goal that put England 2–0 up. With England up 2–1, Hurst&#x27;s contested header trickled inches past the post. Later, at 2–2, Hurst had what many thought was a legitimate goal ruled out for offside. The West Germans scored in extra time and won 3–2.

Hurst scored against Greece and Switzerland in qualification for UEFA Euro 1972, but played his last international match on 29 April 1972 as England were beaten 3–1 by West Germany – he was replaced by Rodney Marsh with 20 minutes left to play and did not take to the field in an England shirt again. He was named in the squad for the second leg against West Germany after Allan Clarke and Francis Lee picked up injuries, but had to pull out of the squad after picking up an injury himself.

==Managerial career==
Upon his retirement from playing, Hurst moved into management and coaching. He spent three years as player-manager of Telford United in the Southern League before being recruited by Ron Greenwood in the England coaching set up in 1977. He travelled with England to help Greenwood at UEFA Euro 1980 and the 1982 FIFA World Cup, where England failed to make it past the group stages on both occasions.

===Chelsea===
Hurst joined Chelsea, then in the Second Division, before the 1979–80 season, initially as assistant manager to Danny Blanchflower. When Blanchflower was sacked, Hurst was appointed manager. He hired Bobby Gould as his assistant. Things initially went well, and for much of the season Chelsea were on course for promotion, but two wins from their final seven league games ensured the club finished fourth; missing out on third place and promotion on goal difference. He raised £250,000 through the sales of Eamonn Bannon, David Stride and Trevor Aylott. He then spent £300,000 on Colin Lee, Dennis Rofe and Colin Viljoen; he later acknowledged Viljoen as a mistake whilst bemoaning Lee&#x27;s bad luck with injury.

The following season again began well, with the &quot;Blues&quot; among the early promotion pace-setters before a dismal run set in, with Chelsea winning just three of their final 23 league matches, culminating in Hurst being sacked and Chelsea finished 12th in the league.

===Kuwait SC===
After being sacked from Chelsea on 23 April 1981, Hurst worked as an insurance salesman for Abbey Life. The next year he was tempted back into management after being offered a generous salary by Kuwait SC. He controversially disciplined and dropped club captain Saad Al-Houti, but was unable to challenge Dave Mackay&#x27;s Al-Arabi for dominance of the Kuwaiti Premier League. After leaving Kuwait in April 1984 he returned to the insurance trade.

==Legacy==

In 2003 Hurst was included in &quot;The Champions&quot;, a statue of 1966 World Cup winning footballers, by sculptor Philip Jackson. It sits at the junctions of Barking Road and Central Park Road, Newham, London, near to the site of West Ham United&#x27;s former home stadium, the Boleyn Ground and features Martin Peters, Hurst, Bobby Moore and Ray Wilson.

Hurst&#x27;s contribution to the English game was recognised in 2004 when he was inducted in the English Football Hall of Fame. Hurst is also one of the few footballers who have been knighted.

A statue of Hurst was unveiled outside Curzon Ashton F.C.&#x27;s ground in 2010. He is shown alongside two other World Cup winners born in the area, fellow 1966 squad member Jimmy Armfield, and Simone Perrotta, who won it with Italy in 2006.

In 2021, West Ham unveiled a statue outside their home ground, the London Stadium depicting Hurst with Bobby Moore and Martin Peters in tribute to the three and West Ham&#x27;s 1965 European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup final victory.

Following the death of Sir Bobby Charlton in October 2023, Hurst was left as the last surviving English player who played in the 1966 World Cup Final.

==Personal life==
As of 2021, Hurst lived in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, with his wife Judith. They have been married since 13 October 1964, having met three years previously at a youth centre; Eddie Presland was best man. They had three daughters but the eldest Claire died in 2010 after a ten-year long battle against a brain tumour. Hurst had one brother, Robert, who died by suicide in 1974.

In November 2020, Hurst offered to donate his brain after his death for research into dementia. This followed the deaths of several of his 1966 World Cup winning colleagues, Jack Charlton, Martin Peters, Ray Wilson, Nobby Stiles after suffering with the disease (also Bobby Charlton who died later).

While playing for Stoke City F.C. Hurst owned the Royal Oak Inn, Eccleshall.

<text>Giovanni d&#x27;Andrea or Johannes Andreæ (1270  1275 – 1348) was an Italian expert in canon law. His contemporaries referred to him as &quot;iuris canonici fons et tuba&quot; (&quot;the fount and trumpet of canon law&quot;). Most important among his works were extensive commentaries on all of the official collections of papal decretals, papal judgments in the form of letters to delegated judges that were at the core of canon law.

==Life==
Giovanni d&#x27;Andrea was born at Rifredo, near Florence, and studied Roman law and canon law at the University of Bologna, the great law school of the age, where he distinguished himself in this subject so much that he was made professor at Padua, and then at Pisa before returning to Bologna, where he remained from the season of 1301–02 until his death, save for brief seasons at Padua 1307–09 and 1319. He wrote the statutes by which the university was governed, in 1317.

The 1911 &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; related curious stories of him: that by way of self-mortification he lay every night for twenty years on the bare ground with only a bear&#x27;s skin for a covering (yet it is known that he remained a layman, was married and had children); that in an audience he had with Pope Boniface VIII his extraordinary shortness of stature led the pope to believe he was kneeling, and to ask him three times to rise, to the immense merriment of the cardinals; and that he had a daughter, Novella, so accomplished in law as to be able to read her father&#x27;s lectures in his absence, and so beautiful that she had to read behind a curtain lest her face should distract the attention of the students. He was also the father of Bettina d&#x27;Andrea.

He is reported to have died at Bologna of the Black Death in 1348, and an epitaph in the church of the Dominicans in which he was buried (calling him &quot;Rabbi Doctorum, Lux, Censor, Normaque Morum&quot;) testifies to the public estimation of his character. Johannes Calderinus (1300–1365) was his student and later his adoptive son. Paulus de Liazariis and Johannes de Sancto Georgio were among his students, and he counted the humanists Cino da Pistoia and Petrarch among his friends.

==Works==

Giovanni d&#x27;Andrea&#x27;s output was voluminous:

* a gloss called (&quot;Novella sive commentarius in decretales epistolas Gregorii IX&quot;) on the &quot;Liber Extra&quot; (1234), compiled under the direction of Pope Gregory IX (see Decretals)
* an encomium of Saint Jerome, the &quot;Hierominianum&quot;
* glosses on the &quot;Constitutiones Clementinae&quot; or Clementines of 1317 which became the standard gloss for this text
* a commentary called the &quot;Mercuriales&quot; on the &quot;Regula iuris&quot; in the &quot;Liber Sextus&quot; (1298) of Boniface VIII.

Among lesser works, his additions to the &quot;Speculum&quot; of Durandus are simply an adaptation from the &quot;Consilia&quot; of Oldradus de Ponte, as is also his &quot;De Sponsalibus et Matrimonio&quot;, from Johannes Anguisciola.

<text>The Galilean moons (), or Galilean satellites, are the four largest moons of Jupiter: Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto. They are the most readily visible Solar System objects after Saturn, the dimmest of the classical planets; though their closeness to bright Jupiter makes naked-eye observation very difficult, they are readily seen with common binoculars, even under night sky conditions of high light pollution. The invention of the telescope allowed astronomers to discover the moons in 1610. Through this, they became the first Solar System objects discovered since humans have started tracking the classical planets, and the first objects to be found to orbit any planet beyond Earth.

They are planetary-mass moons and among the largest objects in the Solar System. All four, along with Titan, Triton, and Earth&#x27;s Moon, are larger than any of the Solar System&#x27;s dwarf planets. The largest, Ganymede, is the largest moon in the Solar System and surpasses the planet Mercury in size (though not mass). Callisto is only slightly smaller than Mercury in size; the smaller ones, Io and Europa, are about the size of the Moon. The three inner moons — Io, Europa, and Ganymede — are in a 4:2:1 orbital resonance with each other. While the Galilean moons are spherical, all of Jupiter&#x27;s remaining moons have irregular forms because they are too small for their self-gravitation to pull them into spheres.

The Galilean moons are named after Galileo Galilei, who observed them in either December 1609 or January 1610, and recognized them as satellites of Jupiter in March 1610; they remained the only known moons of Jupiter until the discovery of the fifth largest moon of Jupiter Amalthea in 1892. Galileo initially named his discovery the Cosmica Sidera (&quot;Cosimo&#x27;s stars&quot;) or Medicean Stars, but the names that eventually prevailed were chosen by Simon Marius. Marius discovered the moons independently at nearly the same time as Galileo, 8 January 1610, and gave them their present individual names, after mythological characters that Zeus seduced or abducted, which were suggested by Johannes Kepler in his &quot;Mundus Jovialis&quot;, published in 1614. Their discovery showed the importance of the telescope as a tool for astronomers by proving that there were objects in space that cannot be seen by the naked eye. The discovery of celestial bodies orbiting something other than Earth dealt a serious blow to the then-accepted (among educated Europeans) Ptolemaic world system, a geocentric theory in which everything orbits around Earth.

== History ==

=== Discovery ===

As a result of improvements that Galileo Galilei made to the telescope, with a magnifying capability of 20×, he was able to see celestial bodies more distinctly than was previously possible. This allowed Galileo to observe in either December 1609 or January 1610 what came to be known as the Galilean moons.

On 7 January 1610, Galileo wrote a letter containing the first mention of Jupiter&#x27;s moons. At the time, he saw only three of them, and he believed them to be fixed stars near Jupiter. He continued to observe these celestial orbs from 8 January to 2 March 1610. In these observations, he discovered a fourth body, and also observed that the four were not fixed stars, but rather were orbiting Jupiter.

Galileo&#x27;s discovery proved the importance of the telescope as a tool for astronomers by showing that there were objects in space to be discovered that until then had remained unseen by the naked eye. More importantly, the discovery of celestial bodies orbiting something other than Earth dealt a blow to the then-accepted Ptolemaic world system, which held that Earth was at the center of the universe and all other celestial bodies revolved around it. Galileo&#x27;s 13 March 1610, &quot;Sidereus Nuncius&quot; (&quot;Starry Messenger&quot;), which announced celestial observations through his telescope, does not explicitly mention Copernican heliocentrism, a theory that placed the Sun at the center of the universe. Nevertheless, Galileo accepted the Copernican theory.

A Chinese historian of astronomy, Xi Zezong, has claimed that a &quot;small reddish star&quot; observed near Jupiter in 364 BCE by Chinese astronomer Gan De may have been Ganymede. If true, this might predate Galileo&#x27;s discovery by around two millennia.

The observations of Simon Marius are another noted example of observation, and he later reported observing the moons in 1609. However, because he did not publish these findings until after Galileo, there is a degree of uncertainty around his records.

=== Names ===

In 1605, Galileo had been employed as a mathematics tutor for Cosimo de&#x27; Medici. In 1609, Cosimo became Grand Duke Cosimo II of Tuscany. Galileo, seeking patronage from his now-wealthy former student and his powerful family, used the discovery of Jupiter&#x27;s moons to gain it. On 13 February 1610, Galileo wrote to the Grand Duke&#x27;s secretary:

&quot;God graced me with being able, through such a singular sign, to reveal to my Lord my devotion and the desire I have that his glorious name live as equal among the stars, and since it is up to me, the first discoverer, to name these new planets, I wish, in imitation of the great sages who placed the most excellent heroes of that age among the stars, to inscribe these with the name of the Most Serene Grand Duke.&quot;

Galileo initially called his discovery the Cosmica Sidera (&quot;Cosimo&#x27;s stars&quot;), in honour of Cosimo alone. Cosimo&#x27;s secretary suggested to change the name to Medicea Sidera (&quot;the Medician stars&quot;), honouring all four Medici brothers (Cosimo, Francesco, Carlo, and Lorenzo). The discovery was announced in the &quot;Sidereus Nuncius&quot; (&quot;Starry Messenger&quot;), published in Venice in March 1610, less than two months after the first observations.

On 12 March 1610, Galileo wrote his dedicatory letter to the Duke of Tuscany, and the next day sent a copy to the Grand Duke, hoping to obtain the Grand Duke&#x27;s support as quickly as possible. On 19 March, he sent the telescope he had used to first view Jupiter&#x27;s moons to the Grand Duke, along with an official copy of &quot;Sidereus Nuncius&quot; (&quot;The Starry Messenger&quot;) that, following the secretary&#x27;s advice, named the four moons the Medician Stars. In his dedicatory introduction, Galileo wrote:
Scarcely have the immortal graces of your soul begun to shine forth on earth than bright stars offer themselves in the heavens which, like tongues, will speak of and celebrate your most excellent virtues for all time. Behold, therefore, four stars reserved for your illustrious name ... which ... make their journeys and orbits with a marvelous speed around the star of Jupiter ... like children of the same family ... Indeed, it appears the Maker of the Stars himself, by clear arguments, admonished me to call these new planets by the illustrious name of Your Highness before all others.
Other names put forward include:
* I. &quot;Principharus&quot; (for the &quot;prince&quot; of Tuscany), II. &quot;Victripharus&quot; (after Vittoria della Rovere), III. &quot;Cosmipharus&quot; (after Cosimo de&#x27; Medici) and IV. &quot;Fernipharus&quot; (after Duke Ferdinando de&#x27; Medici) – by Giovanni Battista Hodierna, a disciple of Galileo and author of the first ephemerides (&quot;Medicaeorum Ephemerides&quot;, 1656);
* &quot;Circulatores Jovis&quot;, or &quot;Jovis Comites&quot; – by Johannes Hevelius;
* &quot;Gardes&quot;, or &quot;Satellites&quot; (from the Latin &quot;satelles, satellitis&quot;, meaning &quot;escorts&quot;) – by Jacques Ozanam.

The names that eventually prevailed were chosen by Simon Marius, who discovered the moons independently at the same time as Galileo: he named them at the suggestion of Johannes Kepler after lovers of the god Zeus (the Greek equivalent of Jupiter), in his &quot;Mundus Jovialis&quot;, published in 1614:

Jupiter is much blamed by the poets on account of his irregular loves. Three maidens are especially mentioned as having been clandestinely courted by Jupiter with success. Io, daughter of the River Inachus, Callisto of Lycaon, Europa of Agenor. Then there was Ganymede, the handsome son of King Tros, whom Jupiter, having taken the form of an eagle, transported to heaven on his back, as poets fabulously tell... I think, therefore, that I shall not have done amiss if the First is called by me Io, the Second Europa, the Third, on account of its majesty of light, Ganymede, the Fourth Callisto... This fancy, and the particular names given, were suggested to me by Kepler, Imperial Astronomer, when we met at Ratisbon fair in October 1613. So if, as a jest, and in memory of our friendship then begun, I hail him as joint father of these four stars, again I shall not be doing wrong.
Galileo steadfastly refused to use Marius&#x27; names and invented as a result the numbering scheme that is still used nowadays, in parallel with proper moon names. The numbers run from Jupiter outward, thus I, II, III and IV for Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto respectively. Galileo used this system in his notebooks but never actually published it. The numbered names (Jupiter &quot;x&quot;) were used until the mid-20th century when other inner moons were discovered, and Marius&#x27; names became widely used.

=== Determination of longitude ===
Galileo&#x27;s discovery had practical applications. Safe navigation required accurately determining a ship&#x27;s position at sea. While latitude could be measured well enough by local astronomical observations, determining longitude required knowledge of the time of each observation synchronized to the time at a reference longitude. The longitude problem was so important that large prizes were offered for its solution at various times by Spain, Holland, and Britain.

Galileo proposed determining longitude based on the timing of the orbits of the Galilean moons. The times of the eclipses of the moons could be precisely calculated in advance and compared with local observations on land or on ship to determine the local time and hence longitude. Galileo applied in 1616 for the Spanish prize of 6,000 gold ducats with a lifetime pension of 2,000 a year, and almost two decades later for the Dutch prize, but by then he was under house arrest for possible heresy.

The main problem with the Jovian moon technique was that it was difficult to observe the Galilean moons through a telescope on a moving ship, a problem that Galileo tried to solve with the invention of the celatone. Others suggested improvements, but without success.

Land mapping surveys had the same problem determining longitude, though with less severe observational conditions. The method proved practical and was used by Giovanni Domenico Cassini and Jean Picard to re-map France.

Some models predict that there may have been several generations of Galilean satellites in Jupiter&#x27;s early history. Each generation of moons to have formed would have spiraled into Jupiter and been destroyed, due to tidal interactions with Jupiter&#x27;s proto-satellite disk, with new moons forming from the remaining debris. By the time the present generation formed, the gas in the proto-satellite disk had thinned out to the point that it no longer greatly interfered with the moons&#x27; orbits.

Other models suggest that Galilean satellites formed in a proto-satellite disk, in which formation timescales were comparable to or shorter than orbital migration timescales. Io is anhydrous and likely has an interior of rock and metal. Europa is thought to contain 8% ice and water by mass with the remainder rock. These moons are, in increasing order of distance from Jupiter:

=== Io ===
Io (Jupiter I) is the innermost of the four Galilean moons of Jupiter; with a diameter of 3642 kilometers, it is the fourth-largest moon in the Solar System, and is only marginally larger than Earth&#x27;s moon. It was named after Io, a priestess of Hera who became one of the lovers of Zeus. It was referred to as &quot;Jupiter I&quot;, or &quot;The first satellite of Jupiter&quot; until the mid-20th century.

With over 400 active volcanos, Io is the most geologically active object in the Solar System. Its surface is dotted with more than 100 mountains, some of which are taller than Earth&#x27;s Mount Everest. Unlike most satellites in the outer Solar System (which have a thick coating of ice), Io is primarily composed of silicate rock surrounding a molten iron or iron sulfide core.

Although not proven, data from the Galileo orbiter indicates that Io might have its own magnetic field. Io has an extremely thin atmosphere made up mostly of sulfur dioxide (SO2). If a surface data or collection vessel were to land on Io in the future, it would have to be extremely tough (similar to the tank-like bodies of the Soviet Venera landers) to survive the radiation and magnetic fields that originate from Jupiter.

=== Europa ===
Europa (Jupiter II), the second of the four Galilean moons, is the second closest to Jupiter and the smallest at 3121.6 kilometers in diameter, which is slightly smaller than Earth&#x27;s Moon. The name comes from a mythical Phoenician noblewoman, Europa, who was courted by Zeus and became the queen of Crete, though the name did not become widely used until the mid-20th century.

It has a smooth and bright surface, with a layer of water surrounding the mantle of the planet, thought to be 100 kilometers thick. The smooth surface includes a layer of ice, while the bottom of the ice is theorized to be liquid water. The apparent youth and smoothness of the surface have led to the hypothesis that a water ocean exists beneath it, which could conceivably serve as an abode for extraterrestrial life. Heat energy from tidal flexing ensures that the ocean remains liquid and drives geological activity. Life may exist in Europa&#x27;s under-ice ocean. So far, there is no evidence that life exists on Europa, but the likely presence of liquid water has spurred calls to send a probe there.

The prominent markings that criss-cross the moon seem to be mainly albedo features, which emphasize low topography. There are few craters on Europa because its surface is tectonically active and young. Some theories suggest that Jupiter&#x27;s gravity is causing these markings, as one side of Europa is constantly facing Jupiter. Volcanic water eruptions splitting the surface of Europa and even geysers have also been considered as causes. The reddish-brown color of the markings is theorized to be caused by sulfur, but because no data collection devices have been sent to Europa, scientists cannot yet confirm this. Europa is primarily made of silicate rock and likely has an iron core. It has a tenuous atmosphere composed primarily of oxygen.

=== Ganymede ===
Ganymede (Jupiter III), the third Galilean moon, is named after the mythological Ganymede, cupbearer of the Greek gods and Zeus&#x27;s beloved. Ganymede is the largest natural satellite in the Solar System at 5262.4 kilometers in diameter, which makes it larger than the planet Mercury – although only at about half of its mass since Ganymede is an icy world. It is the only satellite in the Solar System known to possess a magnetosphere, likely created through convection within the liquid iron core.

Ganymede is composed primarily of silicate rock and water ice, and a salt-water ocean is believed to exist nearly 200 km below Ganymede&#x27;s surface, sandwiched between layers of ice. The metallic core of Ganymede suggests a greater heat at some time in its past than had previously been proposed. The surface is a mix of two types of terrain—highly cratered dark regions and younger, but still ancient, regions with a large array of grooves and ridges. Ganymede has a high number of craters, but many are gone or barely visible due to its icy crust forming over them. The satellite has a thin oxygen atmosphere that includes O, O2, and possibly O3 (ozone), and some atomic hydrogen.

=== Callisto ===
Callisto (Jupiter IV) is the fourth and last Galilean moon, and is the second-largest of the four, and at 4820.6 kilometers in diameter, it is the third largest moon in the Solar System, and barely smaller than Mercury, though only a third of the latter&#x27;s mass. It is named after the Greek mythological nymph Callisto, a lover of Zeus who was a daughter of the Arkadian King Lykaon and a hunting companion of the goddess Artemis. The moon does not form part of the orbital resonance that affects three inner Galilean satellites and thus does not experience appreciable tidal heating. Callisto is composed of approximately equal amounts of rock and ices, which makes it the least dense of the Galilean moons. It is one of the most heavily cratered satellites in the Solar System, and one major feature is a basin around 3000 km wide called Valhalla.

Callisto is surrounded by an extremely thin atmosphere composed of carbon dioxide and probably molecular oxygen. Investigation revealed that Callisto may possibly have a subsurface ocean of liquid water at depths less than 300 kilometres. The likely presence of an ocean within Callisto indicates that it can or could harbour life. However, this is less likely than on nearby Europa. Callisto has long been considered the most suitable place for a human base for future exploration of the Jupiter system since it is furthest from the intense radiation of Jupiter&#x27;s magnetic field.

== Comparative structure ==

Fluctuations in the orbits of the moons indicate that their mean density decreases with distance from Jupiter. Callisto, the outermost and least dense of the four, has a density intermediate between ice and rock whereas Io, the innermost and densest moon, has a density intermediate between rock and iron. Callisto has an ancient, heavily cratered and unaltered ice surface and the way it rotates indicates that its density is equally distributed, suggesting that it has no rocky or metallic core but consists of a homogeneous mix of rock and ice. This may well have been the original structure of all the moons. The rotation of the three inner moons, in contrast, indicates differentiation of their interiors with denser matter at the core and lighter matter above. They also reveal significant alteration of the surface. Ganymede reveals past tectonic movement of the ice surface which required partial melting of subsurface layers. Europa reveals more dynamic and recent movement of this nature, suggesting a thinner ice crust. Finally, Io, the innermost moon, has a sulfur surface, active volcanism and no sign of ice. All this evidence suggests that the nearer a moon is to Jupiter the hotter its interior. The current model is that the moons experience tidal heating as a result of the gravitational field of Jupiter in inverse proportion to the square of their distance from the giant planet. In all but Callisto this will have melted the interior ice, allowing rock and iron to sink to the interior and water to cover the surface. In Ganymede a thick and solid ice crust then formed. In warmer Europa a thinner more easily broken crust formed. In Io the heating is so extreme that all the rock has melted and water has long ago boiled out into space.

==Origin and evolution==
Jupiter&#x27;s regular satellites are believed to have formed from a circumplanetary disk, a ring of accreting gas and solid debris analogous to a protoplanetary disk. They may be the remnants of a score of Galilean-mass satellites that formed early in Jupiter&#x27;s history.

Simulations suggest that, while the disk had a relatively high mass at any given moment, over time a substantial fraction (several tenths of a percent) of the mass of Jupiter captured from the Solar nebula was processed through it. However, the disk mass of only 2% that of Jupiter is required to explain the existing satellites. Thus there may have been several generations of Galilean-mass satellites in Jupiter&#x27;s early history. Each generation of moons would have spiraled into Jupiter, due to drag from the disk, with new moons then forming from the new debris captured from the Solar nebula. By the time the present (possibly fifth) generation formed, the disk had thinned out to the point that it no longer greatly interfered with the moons&#x27; orbits. The current Galilean moons were still affected, falling into and being partially protected by an orbital resonance which still exists for Io, Europa, and Ganymede. Ganymede&#x27;s larger mass means that it would have migrated inward at a faster rate than Europa or Io. Tidal dissipation in the Jovian system is still ongoing and Callisto will likely be captured into the resonance in about 1.5 billion years, creating a 1:2:4:8 chain.

==Visibility==
All four Galilean moons are bright enough to be viewed from Earth without a telescope, if only they could appear farther away from Jupiter. (They are, however, easily distinguished with even low-powered binoculars.) They have apparent magnitudes between 4.6 and 5.6 when Jupiter is in opposition with the Sun, and are about one unit of magnitude dimmer when Jupiter is in conjunction. The main difficulty in observing the moons from Earth is their proximity to Jupiter, since they are obscured by its brightness. The maximum angular separations of the moons are between 2 and 10 arcminutes from Jupiter, which is close to the limit of human visual acuity. Ganymede and Callisto, at their maximum separation, are the likeliest targets for potential naked-eye observation.

<text>Gloria Fowles (born September 7, 1943), known professionally as Gloria Gaynor, is an American singer, best known for the disco era hits &quot;I Will Survive&quot; (1978), &quot;Let Me Know (I Have a Right)&quot; (1979), &quot;I Am What I Am&quot; (1983), and her version of &quot;Never Can Say Goodbye&quot; (1974).

==Early life==
Gloria Fowles was born in Newark, New Jersey, to Daniel Fowles and Queenie Mae Proctor. Her grandmother lived nearby and was involved in her upbringing. &quot;There was always music in our house&quot;, Gaynor wrote in her autobiography &quot;I Will Survive&quot;. She enjoyed listening to the radio, and to records by Nat King Cole and Sarah Vaughan. Her father played the ukulele and guitar and sang professionally in nightclubs with a group called Step &#x27;n&#x27; Fetchit. Gloria grew up as a tomboy; she had five brothers and one sister. Her brothers sang gospel and formed a quartet with a friend.

Gaynor was not allowed to sing with the all-male group, nor was her younger brother Arthur, as Gloria was a girl and Arthur was too young. Arthur later acted as a tour manager for Gaynor. The family was relatively poor, but Gaynor recalls the house being filled with laughter and happiness, and the dinner table being open to neighborhood friends. They moved to a housing project in 1960, where Gaynor attended South Side High School; she graduated in 1961.

&quot;All through my young life I wanted to sing, although nobody in my family knew it&quot;, Gaynor wrote in her autobiography. Gaynor began singing in a nightclub in Newark, where she was recommended to a local band by a neighbor. After several years of performing in local clubs and along the East Coast, Gaynor began her recording career in 1971 at Columbia Records.

== Music career ==
===Early years===
Gaynor was a singer with The Soul Satisfiers, a jazz and R&amp;B music band of the 1960s. She recorded &quot;She&#x27;ll Be Sorry&quot; as Gloria Gaynor in 1965, for Johnny Nash&#x27;s &quot;Jocida&quot; label. Her first real success came in 1973 when she was signed to Columbia Records by Clive Davis. The fruit of that was the release of the single &quot;Honey Bee&quot;.

Moving on to MGM Records she finally hit with the album &quot;Never Can Say Goodbye&quot;, released in 1975. The first side of the album consisted of three songs (&quot;Honey Bee&quot;, &quot;Never Can Say Goodbye&quot;, and &quot;Reach Out, I&#x27;ll Be There&quot;), with no break between the songs. This 19-minute dance marathon proved to be enormously popular, especially at dance clubs. All three songs were released as singles via radio edits and all of them became hits. The album was instrumental in introducing disco music to the public, &quot;Never Can Say Goodbye&quot; becoming the first song to top &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine&#x27;s dance chart. It was also a hit on the mainstream Pop Charts, peaking at No. 9, and on the R&amp;B Charts, reaching No. 34 (the original version by The Jackson 5 had been a No. 2 hit on the Hot 100 in 1971). It also marked her first significant chart success internationally, making it into the Top 5 in Australia, Canada, Germany and the UK. The song would go on to be certified silver by the British Phonographic Industry, and subsequently gold in the US.

Capitalizing on the success of her first album, Gaynor quickly released her follow-up, &quot;Experience Gloria Gaynor&quot;, later that same year. Some of her lesser-known singles, due to lack of recurrent airplay—including &quot;Honey Bee&quot; (1974), &quot;Casanova Brown&quot; (1975), and &quot;Let&#x27;s Make a Deal&quot; (1976), as well as her cover of the Four Tops&#x27; &quot;Reach Out, I&#x27;ll Be There&quot;—became hits in nightclubs and reached the Top 5 on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s disco charts. Many charted on the Hot 100 and R&amp;B charts as well, with songs like &quot;(If You Want It) Do It Yourself&quot;—a No. 1 disco hit—peaking at No. 98 on the Pop Charts and No. 24 on the R&amp;B Charts. Gaynor&#x27;s cover of &quot;How High the Moon&quot; topped the US Dance Charts, and made the lower parts of both the pop and R&amp;B charts, as well as achieving some international chart success. She has recorded some 16 albums since her 1976 album &quot;I&#x27;ve Got You&quot;, including one in England, one in Germany, and two in Italy.

===Major mainstream breakthrough===
During the next few years, Gaynor released two albums &quot;Glorious&quot; and &quot;Gloria Gaynor&#x27;s Park Avenue Sound&quot;, but would only enjoy a few more moderate hits. However, in late 1978, with the release of her album &quot;Love Tracks&quot;, she climbed the pop charts again with her smash hit single &quot;I Will Survive&quot;. The lyrics of this song were written from the point of view of a woman, recently dumped, telling her former lover that she can cope without him and does not want anything more to do with him. The song has become something of an anthem of female Emancipation. Originally, &quot;I Will Survive&quot; was a B-side when Polydor Records released it in late 1978. The A-side, a song called &quot;Substitute&quot;, then a recent worldwide hit for South African girl-group Clout, was considered more &quot;radio friendly&quot;. Gaynor won a Grammy for “I Will Survive&quot; at the 22nd Annual Grammy Awards, and also received nominations for Grammy Award for Record of the Year and Best Female Pop Vocal Performance. &quot;I Will Survive&quot; is ranked No. 492 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s list of &quot;The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time&quot;, and ranked at No. 97 on Billboard magazine&#x27;s &quot;All-Time Hot 100&quot;.

As a disco number, the song was unique for its time by virtue of Gaynor&#x27;s having no background singers or lush production. And, unlike her first disco hits, the track was not pitched up to make it faster and to render Gaynor&#x27;s recorded voice in a higher register than that in which she actually sang. In late 1979, she released the album &quot;I Have a Right&quot; which contained her next disco hit, &quot;Let Me Know (I Have a Right)&quot;, which featured Doc Severinsen of &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot; fame, playing a trumpet solo. Gaynor also recorded a disco song called &quot;Love Is Just a Heartbeat Away&quot; in 1979 for the cult vampire film &quot;&quot;, which featured a number of disco songs.

===Stateside career===
In 1980 and again in 1981, Gaynor released two disco albums which were virtually ignored in the United States due to the backlash against disco, which began late in 1979. The album&#x27;s singles barely registered on urban contemporary radio, where disco music remained popular. In 1982, having looked into a wide variety of faiths and religious movements, she became a Christian and began to distance herself from a past she considered to be sinful. That same year, she released an album of mid-tempo R&amp;B and pop-style songs entitled &quot;Gloria Gaynor&quot;.

Gaynor would achieve her final success in the 1980s with the release of her album &quot;I Am Gloria Gaynor&quot; in 1984. This was mainly due to the song &quot;I Am What I Am&quot;, which became a hit at dance clubs, and then on the Club Play chart in late 1983/early 1984. &quot;I Am What I Am&quot; became a gay anthem and made Gaynor a gay icon. Her 1986 album, &quot;The Power of Gloria Gaynor&quot;, was almost entirely composed of cover versions of other songs that were popular at the time.

===Career revival===
Gaynor&#x27;s career received a revitalizing spark in the early- and mid-1990s with the worldwide disco revival movement. During the late 1990s, she dabbled in acting for a while, guest-starring on &quot;The Wayans Bros&quot;, &quot;That &#x27;70s Show&quot; (singing &quot;I Will Survive&quot;), and &quot;Ally McBeal,&quot; before doing a limited engagement performance in Broadway&#x27;s &quot;Smokey Joe&#x27;s Cafe&quot;. In 2001, Gaynor performed &quot;I Will Survive&quot; at the 30th Anniversary concert for Michael Jackson.

Gaynor returned to the recording studio in 2002, releasing her first album in over 15 years, &quot;I Wish You Love&quot;. The two singles released from the album, &quot;Just Keep Thinking About You&quot; and &quot;I Never Knew&quot;, both topped &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Hot Dance Music/Club Play. Both singles also secured moderate to heavy dance format radio airplay. The latter song also charted No. 30 on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Adult Contemporary chart. In 2004, Gaynor re-released her 1997 album &quot;The Answer&quot; (also released under the title &quot;What a Life&quot;) as a follow-up to her successful album &quot;I Wish You Love&quot;. The album includes her club hit &quot;Oh, What a Life&quot;.

In late 2002, Gaynor appeared with R&amp;B stars on the &quot;Rhythm, Love, and Soul&quot; edition of the PBS series &quot;American Soundtrack&quot;. Her performance of the disco hit &quot;I Will Survive&quot; and new single &quot;I Never Knew&quot; was included on the accompanying live album that was released in 2004.

On September 19, 2005, Gaynor was honored twice when she and her music were inducted into the Dance Music Hall of Fame, in the &quot;Artist&quot; category, along with fellow disco artists Chic and Sylvester. Her classic anthem &quot;I Will Survive&quot; was inducted under the &quot;Records&quot; category. In January 2008, the American Diabetes Association named Gaynor the Honorary Spokesperson of the 2008 &quot;NYC Step Out to Fight Diabetes Walk&quot;.

More television appearances followed in the late 2000s with 2009 appearances on &quot;The John Kerwin Show&quot;, &quot;The Wendy Williams Show&quot;, and &quot;The View&quot; to promote the 30th anniversary of &quot;I Will Survive&quot;. In 2010, she appeared on &quot;Last Comic Standing&quot; and &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot;. Gaynor released a contemporary Christian album in late 2013.

Forty years after its release, Gaynor continues to ride the success of &quot;I Will Survive&quot;, touring the country and the world over and performing her signature song on dozens of TV shows. A few successful remixes of the song during the 1990s and 2000s along with new versions of the song by Lonnie Gordon, Diana Ross, Chantay Savage, rock group Cake and others, as well as constant recurrent airplay on nearly all soft AC and rhythmic format radio stations have helped to keep the song in the mainstream. Gaynor said of her biggest hit in a 2012 interview: &quot;It feels great to have such a song like that because I get kids five and six years old telling me they like the song, and then people seventy-five and eighty. It&#x27;s quite an honor.&quot; The song was revived yet again in 2015 for the film &quot;The Martian&quot;, where it is used at the end as the credits roll.
On May 16, 2015, Gaynor was awarded the honorary degree of Doctor of Music by Dowling College. In 2017, she made a cameo appearance as a flight attendant in a Capital One commercial, while Samuel L. Jackson, Charles Barkley, and Spike Lee sang &quot;I Will Survive&quot;.

In 2016, &quot;I Will Survive&quot; was selected for induction into the Library of Congress&#x27; National Recording Registry.

On May 6, 2017, Gaynor performed with her band at the Library of Congress&#x27; celebration of disco music at Bibliodiscotheque, a disco dance party in the Great Hall of the Thomas Jefferson Building.

Due to the devastation wreaked by Hurricane Harvey on the state of Texas in August 2017, Gaynor rewrote the lyrics to &quot;I Will Survive&quot;, changing the title to &quot;Texas Will Survive&quot;, and posted a video of herself singing the song on Twitter on August 30, 2017.

In December 2019, &quot;I Will Survive&quot; trended on TikTok and Gaynor performed the dance at the LifeMinute TV studios in Times Square, NY.

In January 2020, she won her second Grammy Award in her career, 40 years after her first, for her roots gospel album &quot;Testimony&quot;, winning Best Roots Gospel Album at the 62nd Annual Grammy Awards.

In 2021, Gaynor returned to disco music when she recorded &quot;Can&#x27;t Stop Writing Songs About You&quot; with Australian singer Kylie Minogue for the reissue of Minogue&#x27;s fifteenth studio album &quot;Disco&quot; entitled &quot;Disco: Guest List Edition&quot;. The collaboration occurred following Gaynor praising Minogue for keeping disco alive with her album of the same name.

In April 2021, Gaynor recorded &quot;Brand New&quot; with the veteran Contemporary Christian band MercyMe.

In 2022, Gaynor competed in season eight of &quot;The Masked Singer&quot; as &quot;Mermaid&quot; who rode around on a giant clam-like vehicle that the Men in Black had to push around. After being eliminated on &quot;Andrew Lloyd Webber Night&quot; alongside Mario Cantone as &quot;Maize&quot;, Gaynor did her encore performance of &quot;I Will Survive&quot;.

==Personal life==
Gaynor married her manager Linwood Simon in 1979. The couple divorced in 2005. She has no children. According to Gaynor, while she always wanted children, her ex-husband never desired any.

<doc id="12511" wikidata="Q3760876" url="?curid=12511" title="Gerald Schroeder">
<text>Gerald Lawrence Schroeder (born 20 February 1938) is an American-Israeli Orthodox Jewish physicist, author, lecturer, and teacher at College of Jewish Studies Aish HaTorah&#x27;s Discovery Seminar, Essentials and Fellowships programs and Executive Learning Center, who focuses on what he perceives to be an inherent relationship between science and spirituality.

==Education==
Schroeder received his BSc in 1959, his MSc in 1961, and his PhD in nuclear physics and earth and planetary sciences in 1965, from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). He worked seven years on the staff of the MIT physics department. He was a member of the United States Atomic Energy Commission.

==Aliyah to Israel==
After immigrating to Israel in 1971, Schroeder was employed as a researcher at the Weizmann Institute of Science, the Volcani Research Institute, and the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. He currently teaches at Aish HaTorah College of Jewish Studies.

== Religion and science ==
Schroeder&#x27;s works frequently cite Talmudic, Midrashic and medieval commentaries on the biblical creation account, such as commentaries written by the Jewish philosopher Nachmanides. Among other things, Schroeder attempts to reconcile a six-day creation as described in Genesis with the scientific evidence that the world is billions of years old, using the idea that the perceived flow of time for a given event in an expanding universe varies with the observer&#x27;s perspective of that event. He attempts to reconcile the two perspectives numerically, calculating the effect of the stretching of space-time, based on Albert Einstein&#x27;s general relativity.

Namely, he claims that from the perspective of the point of origin of the Big Bang, according to Einstein&#x27;s equations of the &#x27;stretching factor&#x27;, time dilates by a factor of roughly 1,000,000,000,000, meaning one trillion days on earth would appear to pass as one day from that point, due to the stretching of space. When applied to the estimated age of the universe at 13.8 billion years, from the perspective of the point of origin, the universe today would appear to have just begun its sixth day of existence, or if the universe is 15 billion years old from the perspective of earth, it would appear to have just completed its sixth day.
Antony Flew, an academic philosopher who promoted atheism for most of his adult life, indicated that the arguments of Gerald Schroeder had influenced his decision to become a deist.

Schroeder&#x27;s theories to reconcile faith and science have drawn some criticism from both religious and non-religious scientists, and his works remain controversial in scientific circles. Natan Slifkin argues that Schroeder&#x27;s calculations do not fit the order of creation as presented in Genesis vs. the order of organism development as dictated by our current understanding of evolutionary biology.

==Personal==
Schroeder&#x27;s wife Barbara Sofer is a columnist for the English-language Israeli newspaper &quot;The Jerusalem Post&quot;. The couple have five children.

==Prizes==
In 2012, Schroeder was awarded the Trotter Prize by Texas A&amp;M University&#x27;s College of Science.

<text>In folklore, a ghost is the soul or spirit of a dead person or non-human animal that is believed by some people to be able to appear to the living. In ghostlore, descriptions of ghosts vary widely, from an invisible presence to translucent or barely visible wispy shapes to realistic, lifelike forms. The deliberate attempt to contact the spirit of a deceased person is known as necromancy, or in spiritism as a &quot;séance&quot;. Other terms associated with it are apparition, haunt, haint, phantom, poltergeist, shade, specter, spirit, spook, wraith, demon, and ghoul.

The belief in the existence of an afterlife, as well as manifestations of the spirits of the dead, is widespread, dating back to animism or ancestor worship in pre-literate cultures. Certain religious practices—funeral rites, exorcisms, and some practices of spiritualism and ritual magic—are specifically designed to rest the spirits of the dead. Ghosts are generally described as solitary, human-like essences, though stories of ghostly armies and the ghosts of animals other than humans have also been recounted. They are believed to haunt particular locations, objects, or people they were associated with in life. According to a 2009 study by the Pew Research Center, 18% of Americans say they have seen a ghost.

The overwhelming consensus of science is that there is no proof that ghosts exist. Their existence is impossible to falsify, and ghost hunting has been classified as pseudoscience. Despite centuries of investigation, there is no scientific evidence that any location is inhabited by the spirits of the dead. Historically, certain toxic and psychoactive plants (such as &quot;datura&quot; and &quot;hyoscyamus niger&quot;), whose use has long been associated with necromancy and the underworld, have been shown to contain anticholinergic compounds that are pharmacologically linked to dementia (specifically DLB) as well as histological patterns of neurodegeneration. Recent research has indicated that ghost sightings may be related to degenerative brain diseases such as Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. Common prescription medication and over-the-counter drugs (such as sleep aids) may also, in rare instances, cause ghost-like hallucinations, particularly zolpidem and diphenhydramine. Older reports linked carbon monoxide poisoning to ghost-like hallucinations.

In folklore studies, ghosts fall within the motif index designation E200–E599 (&quot;Ghosts and other revenants&quot;).

==Terminology==
=== Etymology ===
The English word &quot;ghost&quot; comes from Old English &quot;gāst&quot; (&quot;breath, spirit, soul, ghost&quot;), which can be traced back to Proto-Germanic &quot;*gaistaz&quot; (&quot;spirit, ghost&quot;). It is cognate (linguistic sibling from a common origin) with Old Frisian &quot;gāst&quot; (&quot;spirit, ghost, demon&quot;), Old Saxon &quot;gēst&quot; (&quot;soul, vitality, spirit, demon&quot;), Old Dutch &quot;gēst&quot; (&quot;spirit&quot;), and Old High German (&quot;spirit&quot;)&quot;.&quot; Although recorded descendants do not appear in North and East Germanic sources (where Gothic uses &quot;ahma&quot; and Old Norse uses &quot;andi&quot; m. or &quot;önd&quot; f.), linguists reconstruct &quot;*gaistaz&quot; as stemming from pre-Germanic *&quot;ghois-t-oz&quot; (&quot;fury, anger&quot;). This reconstruction is supported by its connection to Sanskrit &quot;hīḍ-&quot; (&quot;to be angry&quot;) and &quot;héḍa&quot; (&quot;anger&quot;), and to Avestan &quot;zōižda-&quot; (&quot;terrible&quot;; in &quot;zōiždišta&quot; &quot;most terrible&quot;).

The common Proto-Indo-European form is posited as *&quot;ǵʰoys-d-os&quot;, a dental suffix derivative of the root &quot;ǵʰéys-&quot;. This root also appears Proto-Germanic &quot;*gaistjan&quot; (&quot;to terrify&quot;; compare Old English &quot;gǽstan&quot; and Gothic &quot;usgaisjan&quot;), in Old Norse *&quot;geiski&quot; (&quot;fear&quot;; implied in &quot;geiskafullr&quot;, &quot;full of fear&quot;), and in Avestan &quot;zōiš-&quot; (in &quot;zōišnu&quot;, &quot;shivering, trembling&quot;).

Besides denoting a &quot;person&#x27;s spirit or soul&quot; (as &quot;the life force&quot; or &quot;breath of life&quot; that gives life to the body, in contrast to its purely material being), the Old English word is also used as a synonym of Latin &quot;spīritus&quot; in the meaning of &quot;the breath of God or a god&quot; from the earliest attestations (9th century). It could also denote any good or evil spirit, such as angels and demons (the Anglo-Saxon gospel refers to the demonic possession of Matthew 12:43 as &quot;se unclæna gast&quot;). Also from the Old English period, the word could denote the spirit of God, the &quot;Holy Ghost&quot; (&quot;halgan gaste&quot;), after post-classical Latin &quot;spiritus sanctus&quot; .

=== Usage and synonyms ===
The now-prevailing sense of &quot;the soul of a deceased person, spoken of as appearing in a visible form&quot; only emerges in Middle English (14th century). The modern noun does, however, retain a wider field of application, extending on one hand to &quot;soul&quot;, &quot;spirit&quot;, &quot;vital principle&quot;, &quot;mind&quot;, or &quot;psyche&quot;, the seat of feeling, thought, and moral judgement; on the other hand used figuratively of any shadowy outline, or fuzzy or unsubstantial image; in optics, photography, and cinematography especially, a flare, secondary image, or spurious signal.

The synonym &quot;spook&quot; is a Dutch loanword, akin to Low German (of uncertain etymology); it entered the English language via American English in the 19th century. Alternative words in modern usage include &quot;spectre&quot; (altn. &quot;specter&quot;; from Latin ), the Scottish &quot;wraith&quot; (of obscure origin), &quot;phantom&quot; (via French ultimately from Greek &quot;phantasma&quot;, compare &quot;fantasy&quot;) and &quot;apparition&quot;. The term &quot;shade&quot; in classical mythology translates Greek σκιά, or Latin , in reference to the notion of spirits in the Greek underworld. The term &quot;poltergeist&quot; is a German word, literally a &quot;noisy ghost&quot;, for a spirit said to manifest itself by invisibly moving and influencing objects.

&quot;Wraith&quot; is a Scots word for &quot;ghost&quot;, &quot;spectre&quot;, or &quot;apparition&quot;. It appeared in Scottish Romanticist literature, and acquired the more general or figurative sense of &quot;portent&quot; or &quot;omen&quot;. In 18th- to 19th-century Scottish literature, it also applied to aquatic spirits. The word has no commonly accepted etymology; the &quot;OED&quot; notes &quot;of obscure origin&quot; only. An association with the verb &quot;writhe&quot; was the etymology favored by J. R. R. Tolkien. Tolkien&#x27;s use of the word in the naming of the creatures known as the Ringwraiths has influenced later usage in fantasy literature. Bogey or &quot;bogy/bogie&quot; is a term for a ghost, and appears in Scottish poet John Mayne&#x27;s &quot;Hallowe&#x27;en&quot; in 1780.

A &quot;revenant&quot; is a deceased person returning from the dead to haunt the living, either as a disembodied ghost or alternatively as an animated (&quot;undead&quot;) corpse. Also related is the concept of a fetch, the visible ghost or spirit of a person yet alive.

==Typology==
===Anthropological context===
A notion of the transcendent, supernatural, or numinous, usually involving entities like ghosts, demons, or deities, is a cultural universal. In pre-literate folk religions, these beliefs are often summarized under animism and ancestor worship. Some people believe the ghost or spirit never leaves Earth until there is no-one left to remember the one who died.

In many cultures, malignant, restless ghosts are distinguished from the more benign spirits involved in ancestor worship.

Ancestor worship typically involves rites intended to prevent revenants, vengeful spirits of the dead, imagined as starving and envious of the living. Strategies for preventing revenants may either include sacrifice; that is, giving the dead food and drink to pacify them, or magical banishment of the deceased to force them not to return. Ritual feeding of the dead is performed in traditions like the Chinese Ghost Festival or the Western All Souls&#x27; Day. Magical banishment of the dead is present in many of the world&#x27;s burial customs. The bodies found in many tumuli (kurgan) had been ritually bound before burial, and the custom of binding the dead persists, for example, in rural Anatolia.

Nineteenth-century anthropologist James Frazer stated in his classic work &quot;The Golden Bough&quot; that souls were seen as the creature within that animated the body.

===Ghosts and the afterlife===
Although the human soul was sometimes symbolically or literally depicted in ancient cultures as a bird or other animal, it appears to have been widely held that the soul was an exact reproduction of the body in every feature, even down to clothing the person wore. This is depicted in artwork from various ancient cultures, including such works as the Egyptian &quot;Book of the Dead&quot;, which shows deceased people in the afterlife appearing much as they did before death, including the style of dress.

===Fear of ghosts===
While deceased ancestors are universally regarded as venerable, and often believed to have a continued presence in some form of afterlife, the spirit of a deceased person that persists in the material world (a ghost) is regarded as an unnatural or undesirable state of affairs and the idea of ghosts or revenants is associated with a reaction of fear. This is universally the case in pre-modern folk cultures, but fear of ghosts also remains an integral aspect of the modern ghost story, Gothic horror, and other horror fiction dealing with the supernatural.

===Common attributes===
Another widespread belief concerning ghosts is that they are composed of a misty, airy, or subtle material. Anthropologists link this idea to early beliefs that ghosts were the person within the person (the person&#x27;s spirit), most noticeable in ancient cultures as a person&#x27;s breath, which upon exhaling in colder climates appears visibly as a white mist. This belief may have also fostered the metaphorical meaning of &quot;breath&quot; in certain languages, such as the Latin &quot;spiritus&quot; and the Greek &quot;pneuma&quot;, which by analogy became extended to mean the soul. In the Bible, God is depicted as synthesising Adam, as a living soul, from the dust of the Earth and the breath of God.

In many traditional accounts, ghosts were often thought to be deceased people looking for vengeance (vengeful ghosts), or imprisoned on earth for bad things they did during life. The appearance of a ghost has often been regarded as an omen or portent of death. Seeing one&#x27;s own ghostly double or &quot;fetch&quot; is a related omen of death. The impetus of haunting is commonly considered an unnatural death.
White ladies were reported to appear in many rural areas, and supposed to have died tragically or suffered trauma in life. White Lady legends are found around the world. Common to many of them is the theme of losing a child or husband and a sense of purity, as opposed to the Lady in Red ghost that is mostly attributed to a jilted lover or prostitute. The White Lady ghost is often associated with an individual family line or regarded as a harbinger of death similar to a banshee.

Legends of ghost ships have existed since the 18th century; most notable of these is the &quot;Flying Dutchman&quot;. This theme has been used in literature in &quot;The Rime of the Ancient Mariner&quot; by Samuel Taylor Coleridge.

Ghosts are often depicted as being covered in a shroud and/or dragging chains.

===Locale===

A place where ghosts are reported is described as haunted, and often seen as being inhabited by spirits of deceased who may have been former residents or were familiar with the property. Supernatural activity inside homes is said to be mainly associated with violent or tragic events in the building&#x27;s past such as murder, accidental death, or suicide—sometimes in the recent or ancient past. However, not all hauntings are at a place of a violent death, or even on violent grounds. Many cultures and religions believe the essence of a being, such as the &quot;soul&quot;, continues to exist. Some religious views argue that the &quot;spirits&quot; of those who have died have not &quot;passed over&quot; and are trapped inside the property where their memories and energy are strong.

==History==
===Ancient Near East and Egypt===
There are many references to ghosts in Mesopotamian religions – the religions of Sumer, Babylon, Assyria, and other early states in Mesopotamia. Traces of these beliefs survive in the later Abrahamic religions that came to dominate the region. The concept of ghosts may predate many belief systems. Ghosts were thought to be created at time of death, taking on the memory and personality of the dead person. They traveled to the netherworld, where they were assigned a position, and led an existence similar in some ways to that of the living.
Relatives of the dead were expected to make offerings of food and drink to the dead to ease their conditions. If they did not, the ghosts could inflict misfortune and illness on the living. Traditional healing practices ascribed a variety of illnesses to the action of ghosts, while others were caused by gods or demons.

There was widespread belief in ghosts in ancient Egyptian culture.
The Hebrew Bible contains few references to ghosts, associating spiritism with forbidden occult activities cf. Deuteronomy 18:11. The most notable reference is in the First Book of Samuel (I Samuel 28:3–19 KJV), in which a disguised King Saul has the Witch of Endor summon the spirit or ghost of Samuel.

The soul and spirit were believed to exist after death, with the ability to assist or harm the living, and the possibility of a second death. Over a period of more than 2,500 years, Egyptian beliefs about the nature of the afterlife evolved constantly. Many of these beliefs were recorded in hieroglyph inscriptions, papyrus scrolls and tomb paintings. The Egyptian &quot;Book of the Dead&quot; compiles some of the beliefs from different periods of ancient Egyptian history.
In modern times, the fanciful concept of a mummy coming back to life and wreaking vengeance when disturbed has spawned a whole genre of horror stories and films.

===Classical Antiquity===
====Archaic and Classical Greece====
Ghosts appeared in Homer&#x27;s &quot;Odyssey&quot; and &quot;Iliad&quot;, in which they were described as vanishing &quot;as a vapor, gibbering and whining into the earth&quot;. Homer&#x27;s ghosts had little interaction with the world of the living. Periodically they were called upon to provide advice or prophecy, but they do not appear to be particularly feared. Ghosts in the classical world often appeared in the form of vapor or smoke, but at other times they were described as being substantial, appearing as they had been at the time of death, complete with the wounds that killed them.

By the 5th century BC, classical Greek ghosts had become haunting, frightening creatures who could work to either good or evil purposes. The spirit of the dead was believed to hover near the resting place of the corpse, and cemeteries were places the living avoided. The dead were to be ritually mourned through public ceremony, sacrifice, and libations, or else they might return to haunt their families. The ancient Greeks held annual feasts to honor and placate the spirits of the dead, to which the family ghosts were invited, and after which they were &quot;firmly invited to leave until the same time next year.&quot;

The 5th-century BC play &quot;Oresteia&quot; includes an appearance of the ghost of Clytemnestra, one of the first ghosts to appear in a work of fiction.

====Roman Empire and Late Antiquity====

The ancient Romans believed a ghost could be used to exact revenge on an enemy by scratching a curse on a piece of lead or pottery and placing it into a grave.

Plutarch, in the 1st century AD, described the haunting of the baths at Chaeronea by the ghost of a murdered man. The ghost&#x27;s loud and frightful groans caused the people of the town to seal up the doors of the building. Another celebrated account of a haunted house from the ancient classical world is given by Pliny the Younger (). Pliny describes the haunting of a house in Athens, which was bought by the Stoic philosopher Athenodorus, who lived about 100 years before Pliny. Knowing that the house was supposedly haunted, Athenodorus intentionally set up his writing desk in the room where the apparition was said to appear and sat there writing until late at night when he was disturbed by a ghost bound in chains. He followed the ghost outside where it indicated a spot on the ground. When Athenodorus later excavated the area, a shackled skeleton was unearthed. The haunting ceased when the skeleton was given a proper reburial. The writers Plautus and Lucian also wrote stories about haunted houses.

In the New Testament, according to Luke 24:37–39, following his resurrection, Jesus was forced to persuade the Disciples that he was not a ghost (some versions of the Bible, such as the KJV and NKJV, use the term &quot;spirit&quot;). Similarly, Jesus&#x27; followers at first believed he was a ghost (spirit) when they saw him walking on water.

One of the first persons to express disbelief in ghosts was Lucian of Samosata in the 2nd century AD. In his satirical novel &quot;The Lover of Lies&quot; (c. 150 AD), he relates how Democritus &quot;the learned man from Abdera in Thrace&quot; lived in a tomb outside the city gates to prove that cemeteries were not haunted by the spirits of the departed. Lucian relates how he persisted in his disbelief despite practical jokes perpetrated by &quot;some young men of Abdera&quot; who dressed up in black robes with skull masks to frighten him. This account by Lucian notes something about the popular classical expectation of how a ghost should look.

In the 5th century AD, the Christian priest Constantius of Lyon recorded an instance of the recurring theme of the improperly buried dead who come back to haunt the living, and who can only cease their haunting when their bones have been discovered and properly reburied.

===Middle Ages===
Ghosts reported in medieval Europe tended to fall into two categories: the souls of the dead, or demons. The souls of the dead returned for a specific purpose. Demonic ghosts existed only to torment or tempt the living. The living could tell them apart by demanding their purpose in the name of Jesus Christ. The soul of a dead person would divulge its mission, while a demonic ghost would be banished at the sound of the Holy Name.

Most ghosts were souls assigned to Purgatory, condemned for a specific period to atone for their transgressions in life. Their penance was generally related to their sin. For example, the ghost of a man who had been abusive to his servants was condemned to tear off and swallow bits of his own tongue; the ghost of another man, who had neglected to leave his cloak to the poor, was condemned to wear the cloak, now &quot;heavy as a church tower&quot;. These ghosts appeared to the living to ask for prayers to end their suffering. Other dead souls returned to urge the living to confess their sins before their own deaths.

Medieval European ghosts were more substantial than ghosts described in the Victorian age, and there are accounts of ghosts being wrestled with and physically restrained until a priest could arrive to hear its confession. Some were less solid, and could move through walls. Often they were described as paler and sadder versions of the person they had been while alive, and dressed in tattered gray rags. The vast majority of reported sightings were male.

There were some reported cases of ghostly armies, fighting battles at night in the forest, or in the remains of an Iron Age hillfort, as at Wandlebury, near Cambridge, England. Living knights were sometimes challenged to single combat by phantom knights, which vanished when defeated.

From the medieval period an apparition of a ghost is recorded from 1211, at the time of the Albigensian Crusade. Gervase of Tilbury, Marshal of Arles, wrote that the image of Guilhem, a boy recently murdered in the forest, appeared in his cousin&#x27;s home in Beaucaire, near Avignon. This series of &quot;visits&quot; lasted all of the summer. Through his cousin, who spoke for him, the boy allegedly held conversations with anyone who wished, until the local priest requested to speak to the boy directly, leading to an extended disquisition on theology. The boy narrated the trauma of death and the unhappiness of his fellow souls in Purgatory, and reported that God was most pleased with the ongoing Crusade against the Cathar heretics, launched three years earlier. The time of the Albigensian Crusade in southern France was marked by intense and prolonged warfare, this constant bloodshed and dislocation of populations being the context for these reported visits by the murdered boy.

Haunted houses are featured in the 9th-century &quot;Arabian Nights&quot; (such as the tale of &quot;Ali the Cairene and the Haunted House in Baghdad&quot;).

===European Renaissance to Romanticism===

Renaissance magic took a revived interest in the occult, including necromancy. In the era of the Reformation and Counter Reformation, there was frequently a backlash against unwholesome interest in the dark arts, typified by writers such as Thomas Erastus. The Swiss Reformed pastor Ludwig Lavater supplied one of the most frequently reprinted books of the period with his &quot;Of Ghosts and Spirits Walking By Night.&quot;

The Child Ballad &quot;Sweet William&#x27;s Ghost&quot; (1868) recounts the story of a ghost returning to his fiancée begging her to free him from his promise to marry her. He cannot marry her because he is dead but her refusal would mean his damnation. This reflects a popular British belief that the dead haunted their lovers if they took up with a new love without some formal release. &quot;The Unquiet Grave&quot; expresses a belief even more widespread, found in various locations over Europe: ghosts can stem from the excessive grief of the living, whose mourning interferes with the dead&#x27;s peaceful rest. In many folktales from around the world, the hero arranges for the burial of a dead man. Soon after, he gains a companion who aids him and, in the end, the hero&#x27;s companion reveals that he is in fact the dead man. Instances of this include the Italian fairy tale &quot;Fair Brow&quot; and the Swedish &quot;The Bird &#x27;Grip&#x27;&quot;.

===Modern period of western culture===

====Spiritualist movement====

Spiritualism is a monotheistic belief system or religion, postulating a belief in God, but with a distinguishing feature of belief that spirits of the dead residing in the spirit world can be contacted by &quot;mediums&quot;, who can then provide information about the afterlife.

Spiritualism developed in the United States and reached its peak growth in membership from the 1840s to the 1920s, especially in English-language countries. By 1897, it was said to have more than eight million followers in the United States and Europe, mostly drawn from the middle and upper classes, while the corresponding movement in continental Europe and Latin America is known as Spiritism.

The religion flourished for a half century without canonical texts or formal organization, attaining cohesion by periodicals, tours by trance lecturers, camp meetings, and the missionary activities of accomplished mediums. Many prominent Spiritualists were women. Most followers supported causes such as the abolition of slavery and women&#x27;s suffrage. By the late 1880s, credibility of the informal movement weakened, due to accusations of fraud among mediums, and formal Spiritualist organizations began to appear. Spiritualism is currently practiced primarily through various denominational Spiritualist churches in the United States and United Kingdom.

====Spiritism====

Spiritism, or French spiritualism, is based on the five books of the Spiritist Codification written by French educator Hypolite Léon Denizard Rivail under the pseudonym Allan Kardec reporting séances in which he observed a series of phenomena that he attributed to incorporeal intelligence (spirits). His assumption of spirit communication was validated by many contemporaries, among them many scientists and philosophers who attended séances and studied the phenomena. His work was later extended by writers like Leon Denis, Arthur Conan Doyle, Camille Flammarion, Ernesto Bozzano, Chico Xavier, Divaldo Pereira Franco, Waldo Vieira, Johannes Greber, and others.

Spiritism has adherents in many countries throughout the world, including Spain, United States, Canada, Japan, Germany, France, England, Argentina, Portugal, and especially Brazil, which has the largest proportion and greatest number of followers.

===Scientific view===

The physician John Ferriar wrote &quot;An Essay Towards a Theory of Apparitions&quot; in 1813 in which he argued that sightings of ghosts were the result of optical illusions. Later the French physician Alexandre Jacques François Brière de Boismont published &quot;On Hallucinations: Or, the Rational History of Apparitions, Dreams, Ecstasy, Magnetism, and Somnambulism&quot; in 1845 in which he claimed sightings of ghosts were the result of hallucinations.

David Turner, a retired physical chemist, suggested that ball lightning could cause inanimate objects to move erratically.

Joe Nickell of the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry wrote that there was no credible scientific evidence that any location was inhabited by spirits of the dead. Limitations of human perception and ordinary physical explanations can account for ghost sightings; for example, air pressure changes in a home causing doors to slam, humidity changes causing boards to creak, condensation in electrical connections causing intermittent behavior, or lights from a passing car reflected through a window at night. Pareidolia, an innate tendency to recognize patterns in random perceptions, is what some skeptics believe causes people to believe that they have &#x27;seen ghosts&#x27;. Reports of ghosts &quot;seen out of the corner of the eye&quot; may be accounted for by the sensitivity of human peripheral vision. According to Nickell, peripheral vision can easily mislead, especially late at night when the brain is tired and more likely to misinterpret sights and sounds. Nickell further states, &quot;science cannot substantiate the existence of a &#x27;life energy&#x27; that could survive death without dissipating or function at all without a brain... why would... clothes survive?&#x27;&quot; He asks, if ghosts glide, then why do people claim to hear them with &quot;heavy footfalls&quot;? Nickell says that ghosts act the same way as &quot;dreams, memories, and imaginings, because they too are mental creations. They are evidence – not of another world, but of this real and natural one.&quot;

Benjamin Radford from the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry and author of the 2017 book &quot;Investigating Ghosts: The Scientific Search for Spirits&quot; writes that &quot;ghost hunting is the world&#x27;s most popular paranormal pursuit&quot; yet, to date, ghost hunters cannot agree on what a ghost is, or offer proof that they exist; &quot;it&#x27;s all speculation and guesswork&quot;. He writes that it would be &quot;useful and important to distinguish between types of spirits and apparitions. Until then it&#x27;s merely a parlor game distracting amateur ghost hunters from the task at hand.&quot;

According to research in anomalistic psychology visions of ghosts may arise from hypnagogic hallucinations (&quot;waking dreams&quot; experienced in the transitional states to and from sleep). In a study of two experiments into alleged hauntings (Wiseman &quot;et al.&quot;. 2003) came to the conclusion &quot;that people consistently report unusual experiences in &#x27;haunted&#x27; areas because of environmental factors, which may differ across locations.&quot; Some of these factors included &quot;the variance of local magnetic fields, size of location and lighting level stimuli of which witnesses may not be consciously aware&quot;.

Some researchers, such as Michael Persinger of Laurentian University, Canada, have speculated that changes in geomagnetic fields (created, e.g., by tectonic stresses in the Earth&#x27;s crust or solar activity) could stimulate the brain&#x27;s temporal lobes and produce many of the experiences associated with hauntings. Sound is thought to be another cause of supposed sightings. Richard Lord and Richard Wiseman have concluded that infrasound can cause humans to experience bizarre feelings in a room, such as anxiety, extreme sorrow, a feeling of being watched, or even the chills. Carbon monoxide poisoning, which can cause changes in perception of the visual and auditory systems, was speculated upon as a possible explanation for haunted houses as early as 1921.

People who experience sleep paralysis often report seeing ghosts during their experiences. Neuroscientists Baland Jalal and V.S. Ramachandran have recently proposed neurological theories for why people hallucinate ghosts during sleep paralysis. Their theories emphasize the role of the parietal lobe and mirror neurons in triggering such ghostly hallucinations.

==By religion==

===Judaism===
The Hebrew Bible contains several references to &quot;owb&quot; (), which are in a few places akin to shades of classical mythology but mostly describing mediums in connection with necromancy and spirit-consulting, which are grouped with witchcraft and other forms of divination under the category of forbidden occult activities. The most notable reference to a shade is in the First Book of Samuel, in which a disguised King Saul has the Witch of Endor conduct a seance to summon the dead prophet Samuel. A similar term appearing throughout the scriptures is &quot;repha&#x27;(im) &quot; (), which while describing the race of &quot;giants&quot; formerly inhabiting Canaan in many verses, also refer to (the spirits of) dead ancestors of Sheol (like shades) in many others such as in the Book of Isaiah.

Jewish mythology and folkloric traditions describe &quot;dybbuks&quot;, malicious possessing spirits believed to be the dislocated soul of a dead person. However, the term does not appear in the Kabbalah or Talmudic literature, where it is rather called an &quot;unclean spirit&quot; or (). It supposedly leaves the host body once it has accomplished its goal, sometimes after being helped.

=== Christianity ===

In the New Testament, Jesus has to persuade the Disciples that he is not a ghost following the resurrection, Luke 24:37–39 (some versions of the Bible, such as the KJV and NKJV, use the term &quot;spirit&quot;). Similarly, Jesus&#x27; followers at first believe he is a ghost (spirit) when they see him walking on water.

Some Christian denominations such as the Roman Catholic Church consider ghosts as beings who while tied to earth, no longer live on the material plane and linger in an intermediate state before continuing their journey to heaven. On occasion, God would allow the souls in this state to return to earth to warn the living of the need for repentance. Christians are taught that it is sinful to attempt to conjure or control spirits in accordance with Deuteronomy XVIII: 9–12.

Some ghosts are actually said to be demons in disguise, who the Church teaches, in accordance with I Timothy 4:1, that they &quot;come to deceive people and draw them away from God and into bondage.&quot; As a result, attempts to contact the dead may lead to unwanted contact with a demon or an unclean spirit, as was said to occur in the case of Robbie Mannheim, a fourteen-year-old Maryland youth. The Seventh-Day Adventist view is that a &quot;soul&quot; is not equivalent to &quot;spirit&quot; or &quot;ghost&quot; (depending on the Bible version), and that save for the Holy Spirit, all spirits or ghosts are demons in disguise. Furthermore, they teach that in accordance with (Genesis 2:7, Ecclesiastes 12:7), there are only two components to a &quot;soul&quot;, neither of which survives death, with each returning to its respective source.

Christadelphians and Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses reject the view of a living, conscious soul after death.

===Islam===

&quot;Rūḥ&quot; (; plural &quot;arwah&quot;) is a person&#x27;s immortal, essential self — pneuma, i.e. the &quot;spirit&quot; or &quot;soul&quot;. The term is also used for ghosts. The souls of the deceased dwell in barzakh. Only a barrier in Quran, in Islamic tradition this refers to an entire intermediary world between the living and the afterlife. The world, especially cemeteries, are perforated with several gateways to the otherworld or barzakh. In rare occasions, the dead can appear to the living. Pure souls, such as the souls of saints, are commonly addressed as rūḥ, while impure souls seeking for revenge, are often addressed as afarit. An inappropriate burial can also cause a soul to stay in this world, whereupon roaming the earth as a ghost. Since the just souls remain close to their tomb, some people try to communicate with them in order to gain hidden knowledge. Contact with the dead is not the same as contact with jinn, who alike could provide knowledge concealed from living humans. Many encounters with ghosts are related to dreams supposed to occur in the realm of symbols.

Belief in spirits have not ceased to exist in Muslim belief. Smile of new-born babies is sometimes used as a proof for sighting spirits, like ghosts. However, the connection to the other world fades during life on earth but is resumed after death. Once again, smiling of dying people is considered as evidence for recognizing the spirit of their beloved ones. Yet, Muslims who affirm the existence of ghosts, are carefully when interacting with spirits, as the ghosts of humans can be as bad as the jinn. Worst of all, however, are the devils.

Muslim authors, like Ghazali, Ibn Qayyim and Suyuti wrote in more details about the life of ghosts. Ibn Qayyim and Suyuti assert, when a soul desires to turn back to earth long enough, it is gradually released from restrictions of Barzakh and able to move freely. Each spirit experiences afterlife in accordance with their deeds and condictions in the earthly life. Evil souls will find the afterlife as painful and punishment, imprisoned until God allows them to interact with other others. Good souls are not restricted. They are free to come visit other souls and even come down to lower regions. The higher planes (&quot;ʿilliyyīn&quot;) are considered to be broader than the lower ones, the lowest being the most narrow (&quot;sijjīn&quot;). The spiritual space is not thought as spatial, but reflects the capacity of the spirit. The more pure the spirit gets, the more it is able to interact with other souls and thus reaches a broader degree of freedom.

The Ismailite Philosopher Nasir Khusraw conjectured that evil human souls turn into demons, when their bodies die, because of their intense attachment to the bodily world. They were worse than the jinn and fairies, who in turn could become devils, if they pursue evil. A similar thought is recorded by Muhammad ibn Zakariya al-Razi.

The ghosts of saints are thought to transmit blessings from God through the heavenly realm to whose who visit their graves. Therefore, visiting the graves of saints and prophets became a major ritual in Muslim spirituality.

=== Hinduism ===
A bhoota is the ghost of a deceased being in Indian religions. Interpretations of how bhootas come into existence vary by region and community, but they are usually considered to be perturbed and restless due to some factor that prevents them from moving on (to transmigration, non-being, nirvana, or swarga or naraka, depending on tradition). This could be a violent death, unsettled matters in their lives, or simply the failure of their survivors to perform proper funerals. Belief in ghosts has been deeply ingrained in the minds of the people of the subcontinent for generations. There are many allegedly haunted places in the subcontinent, such as cremation grounds, dilapidated buildings, royal mansions, havelis, forts, forest bungalows, burning ghats, etc. Ghosts also occupy a significant place in the Bengali culture. Ghosts and various supernatural entities form an integral part of the socio-cultural beliefs of both the Muslim and Hindu communities of Bangladesh and the Indian state of West Bengal.

The Bhutas (singular &#x27;Bhuta&#x27;), spirits of deified heroes, of fierce and evil beings, of Hindu deities and of animals, etc., are wrongly referred to as &quot;ghosts&quot; or &quot;demons&quot; and, in fact, are protective and benevolent beings. Though it is true that they can cause harm in their violent forms, as they are extremely powerful, they can be pacified through worship or offerings referred to as Bhuta Aradhana.

The Churel, also spelled as Charail, Churreyl, Chudail, Chudel, Chuṛail, Cuḍail or Cuḍel (, ), is a mythical spirit of a woman who died during pregnancy or childbirth, which may be a demoniacal revenant said to occur in South Asia and Southeast Asia, particularly popular in India, Bangladesh, Nepal and Pakistan. The churel is typically described as &quot;the ghost of an unpurified living thing&quot;, but because she is often said to latch on to trees, she is also called a tree-spirit. According to some legends, a woman who dies during childbirth or pregnancy or from suffering at the hands of her in-laws will come back as a revenant churel for revenge, particularly targeting the males in her family.

The churel is mostly described as extremely ugly and hideous but is able to shape-shift and disguise herself as a beautiful woman to lure men into the woods or mountains where she either kills them or sucks up their life-force or virility, turning them into old men. Their feet are believed to be turned the other way around, so the toes face the direction of their back. The churel is called as Pichal Peri in Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.

There are many folk remedies and folkloric sayings that elaborate on how to get rid of revenant, bhoot and churels, and a number measures that supposedly prevent churels from coming to life. The family of a woman who dies a traumatic, tragic, or unnatural death might perform special rituals fearing that the victimised woman might return as a churel. The corpses of suspected churels are also buried in a particular method and posture so as to prevent her from returning.

==== Buddhism ====
In Buddhism, there are a number of planes of existence into which a person can be , one of which is the realm of hungry ghosts. Buddhist celebrate the Ghost Festival as an expression of compassion, one of Buddhist virtues. If the hungry ghosts are fed by non-relatives, they would not bother the community.

==By culture==

===African folklore===
For the Igbo people, a man is simultaneously a physical and spiritual entity. However, it is his spirited dimension that is eternal. In the Akan conception, we witness five parts of the human personality. We have the Nipadua (body), the Okra (soul), Sunsum (spirit), Ntoro (character from father), Mogya (character from mother). The Humr people of southwestern Kordofan, Sudan consume the drink Umm Nyolokh, which is prepared from the liver and bone marrow of giraffes. Richard Rudgley hypothesises that Umm Nyolokh may contain DMT and certain online websites further theorise that giraffe liver might owe its putative psychoactivity to substances derived from psychoactive plants, such as Acacia spp. consumed by the animal. The drink is said to cause hallucinations of giraffes, believed by the Humr to be the ghosts of giraffes.

===European folklore===

Belief in ghosts in European folklore is characterized by the recurring fear of &quot;returning&quot; or &quot;revenant&quot; deceased who may harm the living. This includes the Scandinavian &quot;gjenganger&quot;, the Romanian &quot;strigoi&quot;, the Serbian &quot;vampir&quot;, the Greek &quot;vrykolakas&quot;, etc. In Scandinavian and Finnish tradition, ghosts appear in corporeal form, and their supernatural nature is given away by behavior rather than appearance. In fact, in many stories they are first mistaken for the living. They may be mute, appear and disappear suddenly, or leave no footprints or other traces. English folklore is particularly notable for its numerous haunted locations.

===South and Southeast Asia===
====Indian subcontinent====
A &quot;bhoot&quot; or &quot;bhut&quot; (, , , , ) is a supernatural creature, usually the ghost of a deceased person, in the popular culture, literature and some ancient texts of the Indian subcontinent.

===== North India =====
Interpretations of how &quot;bhoot&quot;s come into existence vary by region and community, but they are usually considered to be perturbed and restless due to some factor that prevents them from moving on (to transmigration, non-being, nirvana, or heaven or hell, depending on tradition). This could be a violent death, unsettled matters in their lives, or simply the failure of their survivors to perform proper funerals.

In Central and Northern India, &quot;ojha&quot; or spirit guides play a central role. It duly happens when in the night someone sleeps and decorates something on the wall, and they say that if one sees the spirit the next thing in the morning he will become a spirit too, and that to a headless spirit and the soul of the body will remain the dark with the dark lord from the spirits who reside in the body of every human in Central and Northern India. It is also believed that if someone calls one from behind, never turn back and see because the spirit may catch the human to make it a spirit.
Other types of spirits in Hindu mythology include Baital, an evil spirit who haunts cemeteries and takes demonic possession of corpses, and Pishacha, a type of flesh-eating demon.

===== Bengal and East India =====

There are many kinds of ghosts and similar supernatural entities that frequently come up in Bengali culture, its folklores and form an important part in Bengali peoples&#x27; socio-cultural beliefs and superstitions. It is believed that the spirits of those who cannot find peace in the afterlife or die unnatural deaths remain on Earth. The word &quot;Pret&quot; (from Sanskrit) is also used in Bengali to mean ghost. In Bengal, ghosts are believed to be the spirit after death of an unsatisfied human being or a soul of a person who dies in unnatural or abnormal circumstances (like murder, suicide or accident). Even it is believed that other animals and creatures can also be turned into ghost after their death.

====Thailand====
Ghosts in Thailand are part of local folklore and have now become part of the popular culture of the country. Phraya Anuman Rajadhon was the first Thai scholar who seriously studied Thai folk beliefs and took notes on the nocturnal village spirits of Thailand. He established that, since such spirits were not represented in paintings or drawings, they were purely based on descriptions of popular orally transmitted traditional stories. Therefore, most of the contemporary iconography of ghosts such as Nang Tani, Nang Takian, Krasue, Krahang, Phi Hua Kat, Phi Pop, Phi Phong, Phi Phraya, and Mae Nak has its origins in Thai films that have now become classics.
The most feared spirit in Thailand is Phi Tai Hong, the ghost of a person who has died suddenly of a violent death. The folklore of Thailand also includes the belief that sleep paralysis is caused by a ghost, Phi Am.

====Tibet====

There is widespread belief in ghosts in Tibetan culture. Ghosts are explicitly recognized in the Tibetan Buddhist religion as they were in Indian Buddhism, occupying a distinct but overlapping world to the human one, and feature in many traditional legends. When a human dies, after a period of uncertainty they may enter the ghost world. A hungry ghost (Tibetan: , ; ) has a tiny throat and huge stomach, and so can never be satisfied. Ghosts may be killed with a ritual dagger or caught in a spirit trap and burnt, thus releasing them to be reborn. Ghosts may also be exorcised, and an annual festival is held throughout Tibet for this purpose. Some say that Dorje Shugden, the ghost of a powerful 17th-century monk, is a deity, but the Dalai Lama asserts that he is an evil spirit, which has caused a split in the Tibetan exile community.

====Austronesia====
There are many Malay ghost myths, remnants of old animist beliefs that have been shaped by later Hindu, Buddhist, and Muslim influences in the modern states of Indonesia, Malaysia, and Brunei. Some ghost concepts such as the female vampires Pontianak and Penanggalan are shared throughout the region.
Ghosts are a popular theme in modern Malaysian and Indonesian films.
There are also many references to ghosts in Filipino culture, ranging from ancient legendary creatures such as the Manananggal and Tiyanak to more modern urban legends and horror films. The beliefs, legends and stories are as diverse as the people of the Philippines.

There was widespread belief in ghosts in Polynesian culture, some of which persists today.
After death, a person&#x27;s ghost normally traveled to the sky world or the underworld, but some could stay on earth. In many Polynesian legends, ghosts were often actively involved in the affairs of the living. Ghosts might also cause sickness or even invade the body of ordinary people, to be driven out through strong medicines.

===East and Central Asia===
====China====


There are many references to ghosts in Chinese culture. Even Confucius said, &quot;Respect ghosts and gods, but keep away from them.&quot;

The ghosts take many forms, depending on how the person died, and are often harmful. Many Chinese ghost beliefs have been accepted by neighboring cultures, notably Japan and southeast Asia. Ghost beliefs are closely associated with traditional Chinese religion based on ancestor worship, many of which were incorporated in Taoism. Later beliefs were influenced by Buddhism, and in turn influenced and created uniquely Chinese Buddhist beliefs.

Many Chinese today believe it possible to contact the spirits of their ancestors through a medium, and that ancestors can help descendants if properly respected and rewarded. The annual ghost festival is celebrated by Chinese around the world. On this day, ghosts and spirits, including those of the deceased ancestors, come out from the lower realm. Ghosts are described in classical Chinese texts as well as modern literature and films.

An article in the China Post stated that nearly 87 percent of Chinese office workers believe in ghosts, and some 52 percent of workers will wear hand art, necklaces, crosses, or even place a crystal ball on their desks to keep ghosts at bay, according to the poll. The prevalence of belief is such that the ruling party has actively sought to discourage citizens.

====Japan====
 are figures in Japanese folklore, analogous to Western legends of ghosts. The name consists of two kanji, (&quot;yū&quot;), meaning &quot;faint&quot; or &quot;dim&quot;, and (&quot;rei&quot;), meaning &quot;soul&quot; or &quot;spirit&quot;. Alternative names include meaning ruined or departed spirit, meaning dead spirit, or the more encompassing or .

Like their Chinese and Western counterparts, they are thought to be spirits kept from a peaceful afterlife.

===Americas===

====Mexico====

There is extensive and varied belief in ghosts in Mexican culture. The modern state of Mexico before the Spanish conquest was inhabited by diverse peoples such as the Maya and Aztec, and their beliefs have survived and evolved, combined with the beliefs of the Spanish colonists. The Day of the Dead incorporates pre-Columbian beliefs with Christian elements. Mexican literature and films include many stories of ghosts interacting with the living.

====United States====

According to the Gallup Poll News Service, belief in haunted houses, ghosts, communication with the dead, and witches had an especially steep increase over the 1990s. A 2005 Gallup poll found that about 32 percent of Americans believe in ghosts.

==Depiction in the arts==

Ghosts are prominent in story-telling of various nations. The ghost story is ubiquitous across all cultures from oral folktales to works of literature. While ghost stories are often explicitly meant to be scary, they have been written to serve all sorts of purposes, from comedy to morality tales. Ghosts often appear in the narrative as sentinels or prophets of things to come. Belief in ghosts is found in all cultures around the world, and thus ghost stories may be passed down orally or in written form.

Spirits of the dead appear in literature as early as Homer&#x27;s &quot;Odyssey&quot;, which features a journey to the underworld and the hero encountering the ghosts of the dead, and the Old Testament, in which the Witch of Endor summons the spirit of the prophet Samuel.

===Renaissance to Romanticism (1500 to 1840)===
One of the more recognizable ghosts in English literature is the shade of Hamlet&#x27;s murdered father in Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;The Tragical History of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark&quot;. In &quot;Hamlet&quot;, it is the ghost who demands that Prince Hamlet investigate his &quot;murder most foul&quot; and seek revenge upon his usurping uncle, King Claudius.

In English Renaissance theater, ghosts were often depicted in the garb of the living and even in armor, as with the ghost of Hamlet&#x27;s father. Armor, being out-of-date by the time of the Renaissance, gave the stage ghost a sense of antiquity. But the sheeted ghost began to gain ground on stage in the 19th century because an armored ghost could not satisfactorily convey the requisite spookiness: it clanked and creaked, and had to be moved about by complicated pulley systems or elevators. These clanking ghosts being hoisted about the stage became objects of ridicule as they became clichéd stage elements. Ann Jones and Peter Stallybrass, in &quot;Renaissance Clothing and the Materials of Memory&quot;, point out, &quot;In fact, it is as laughter increasingly threatens the Ghost that he starts to be staged not in armor but in some form of &#x27;spirit drapery&#x27;.&quot;

===Victorian/Edwardian (1840 to 1920)===
The &quot;classic&quot; ghost story arose during the Victorian period, and included authors such as M. R. James, Sheridan Le Fanu, Violet Hunt, and Henry James. Classic ghost stories were influenced by the gothic fiction tradition, and contain elements of folklore and psychology. M. R. James summed up the essential elements of a ghost story as, &quot;Malevolence and terror, the glare of evil faces, &#x27;the stony grin of unearthly malice&#x27;, pursuing forms in darkness, and &#x27;long-drawn, distant screams&#x27;, are all in place, and so is a modicum of blood, shed with deliberation and carefully husbanded...&quot;. One of the key early appearances by ghosts was &quot;The Castle of Otranto&quot; by Horace Walpole in 1764, considered to be the first gothic novel.

Famous literary apparitions from this period are the ghosts of &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot;, in which Ebenezer Scrooge is helped to see the error of his ways by the ghost of his former colleague Jacob Marley, and the ghosts of Christmas Past, Christmas Present, and Christmas Yet to Come.

===Modern era (1920 to 1970)===

Professional parapsychologists and &quot;ghosts hunters&quot;, such as Harry Price, active in the 1920s and 1930s, and Peter Underwood, active in the 1940s and 1950s, published accounts of their experiences with ostensibly true ghost stories such as Price&#x27;s &quot;The Most Haunted House in England&quot;, and Underwood&#x27;s &quot;Ghosts of Borley&quot; (both recounting experiences at Borley Rectory). The writer Frank Edwards delved into ghost stories in his books of his, like &quot;Stranger than Science&quot;.

Children&#x27;s benevolent ghost stories became popular, such as Casper the Friendly Ghost, created in the 1930s and appearing in comics, animated cartoons, and eventually a 1995 feature film.

With the advent of motion pictures and television, screen depictions of ghosts became common, and spanned a variety of genres; the works of Shakespeare, Dickens and Wilde have all been made into cinematic versions. Novel-length tales have been difficult to adapt to cinema, although that of &quot;The Haunting of Hill House&quot; to &quot;The Haunting&quot; in 1963 is an exception.

Sentimental depictions during this period were more popular in cinema than horror, and include the 1947 film &quot;The Ghost and Mrs. Muir&quot;, which was later adapted to television with a successful 1968–1970 TV series. Genuine psychological horror films from this period include 1944&#x27;s &quot;The Uninvited&quot;, and 1945&#x27;s &quot;Dead of Night&quot;.

===Post-modern (1970–present)===

The 1970s saw screen depictions of ghosts diverge into distinct genres of the romantic and horror. A common theme in the romantic genre from this period is the ghost as a benign guide or messenger, often with unfinished business, such as 1989&#x27;s &quot;Field of Dreams&quot;, the 1990 film &quot;Ghost&quot;, and the 1993 comedy &quot;Heart and Souls&quot;. In the horror genre, 1980&#x27;s &quot;The Fog&quot;, and the &quot;A Nightmare on Elm Street&quot; series of films from the 1980s and 1990s are notable examples of the trend for the merging of ghost stories with scenes of physical violence.

Popularised in such films as the 1984 comedy &quot;Ghostbusters&quot;, ghost hunting became a hobby for many who formed ghost hunting societies to explore reportedly haunted places. The ghost hunting theme has been featured in reality television series, such as &quot;Ghost Adventures&quot;, &quot;Ghost Hunters&quot;, &quot;Ghost Hunters International&quot;, &quot;Ghost Lab&quot;, &quot;Most Haunted&quot;, and &quot;A Haunting&quot;. It is also represented in children&#x27;s television by such programs as &quot;The Ghost Hunter&quot; and &quot;Ghost Trackers&quot;. Ghost hunting also gave rise to multiple guidebooks to haunted locations, and ghost hunting &quot;how-to&quot; manuals.

The 1990s saw a return to classic &quot;gothic&quot; ghosts, whose dangers were more psychological than physical. Examples of films from this period include 1999&#x27;s &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; and &quot;The Others&quot;.

Asian cinema has also produced horror films about ghosts, such as the 1998 Japanese film &quot;Ringu&quot; (remade in the US as &quot;The Ring&quot; in 2002), and the Pang brothers&#x27; 2002 film &quot;The Eye&quot;.
Indian ghost movies are popular not just in India, but in the Middle East, Africa, South East Asia, and other parts of the world. Some Indian ghost movies such as the comedy / horror film &quot;Chandramukhi&quot; have been commercial successes, dubbed into several languages.

In fictional television programming, ghosts have been explored in series such as &quot;Supernatural&quot;, &quot;Ghost Whisperer&quot;, and &quot;Medium&quot;.

In animated fictional television programming, ghosts have served as the central element in series such as &quot;Casper the Friendly Ghost&quot;, &quot;Danny Phantom&quot;, and &quot;Scooby-Doo&quot;. Various other television shows have depicted ghosts as well. 

==Metaphorical usages==
Nietzsche argued that people generally wear prudent masks in company, but that an alternative strategy for social interaction is to present oneself as an absence, as a social ghost – &quot;One reaches out for us but gets no hold of us&quot; – a sentiment later echoed (if in a less positive way) by Carl Jung.

Nick Harkaway has considered that all people carry a host of ghosts in their heads in the form of impressions of past acquaintances – ghosts who represent mental maps of other people in the world and serve as philosophical reference points.

Object relations theory sees human personalities as formed by splitting off aspects of the person that he or she deems incompatible, whereupon the person may be haunted in later life by such ghosts of his or her alternate selves.

The sense of ghosts as invisible, mysterious entities is invoked in several terms that use the word metaphorically, such as ghostwriter (a writer who pens texts credited to another person without revealing the ghostwriter&#x27;s role as an author); ghost singer (a vocalist who records songs whose vocals are credited to another person); and &quot;ghosting&quot; a date (when a person breaks off contact with a former romantic partner and disappears).

<text>Geneva ( ; ; ) is the second-most populous city in Switzerland (after Zürich) and the most populous in French-speaking Romandy. Situated in the southwest of the country, where the Rhône exits Lake Geneva, it is the capital of the Republic and Canton of Geneva, and a centre for international diplomacy. Geneva hosts the highest number of international organizations in the world.

The city of Geneva () had a population of 203,856 in January 2021 within its municipal territory of . The Geneva metropolitan area as officially defined by Eurostat, including suburbs and exurbs in Vaud and the French departments of Ain and Haute-Savoie, extends over and had a population of 1,053,436 in 2021.

Since 2013, the Canton of Geneva, the Nyon District (in the canton of Vaud), and the (, a federation of eight French intercommunal councils), have formed (&quot;Greater Geneva&quot;), a ( in French, a public entity under Swiss law) in charge of organizing cooperation within the cross-border metropolitan area of Geneva (in particular metropolitan transports). The extends over and had a population of 1,046,168 in Jan. 2021 (Swiss estimates and French census), 58.3% of them living on Swiss territory, and 41.7% on French territory.

Geneva is a global city, a financial centre, and a worldwide centre for diplomacy due to the presence of numerous international organizations, including the headquarters of many agencies of the United Nations and the ICRC and IFRC of the Red Cross. In the aftermath of World War I, it hosted the League of Nations. It was where the Geneva Conventions on humanitarian treatment in war were signed. It shares a unique distinction with municipalities such as New York City (global headquarters of the UN), Basel (Bank for International Settlements), and Strasbourg (Council of Europe) as a city which serves as the headquarters of at least one critical international organization without being the capital of a country.

The city has been referred to as the world&#x27;s most compact metropolis and the &quot;Peace Capital&quot;. In 2023, Geneva was ranked as the world&#x27;s tenth most important financial centre by the Global Financial Centres Index, second in Europe behind London. In 2019, Geneva was ranked among the ten most liveable cities in the world by Mercer, alongside Zürich and Basel, as well as the thirteenth most expensive city in the world. In a UBS ranking of global cities in 2018, Geneva was ranked first for gross earnings, second most expensive, and fourth in purchasing power.

== Etymology ==
The city was mentioned in Latin texts, by Caesar, with the spelling &quot;Genava&quot;, probably from the Celtic from the stem (&quot;mouth&quot;), in the sense of an estuary, an etymology shared with the Italian port city of Genoa (in Italian &quot;Genova&quot;).

The medieval county of Geneva in Middle Latin was known as &quot;pagus major Genevensis&quot; or &quot;Comitatus Genevensis&quot; (also &quot;Gebennensis&quot;). After 1400 it became the &quot;Genevois&quot; province of Savoy (albeit not extending to the city proper, until the reformation of the seat of the Bishop of Geneva).

== History ==


Geneva was an Allobrogian border town, fortified against the Helvetii tribe, when the Roman Republic took it in 121 BC. It became Christian under the Late Roman Empire, and acquired its first bishop in the 5th century, having been connected to the Bishopric of Vienne in the 4th.
In the Middle Ages, Geneva was ruled by a count under the Holy Roman Empire until the late 14th century, when it was granted a charter giving it a high degree of self-governance. Around this time, the House of Savoy came to at least nominally dominate the city. In the 15th century, an oligarchic republican government emerged with the creation of the Grand Council. In the first half of the 16th century, the Protestant Reformation reached the city, causing religious strife, during which Savoy rule was thrown off and Geneva allied itself with the Swiss Confederacy.
In 1541, with Protestantism on the rise, John Calvin, the Protestant Reformer and proponent of Calvinism, became the spiritual leader of the city and established the Republic of Geneva. By the 18th century, Geneva had come under the influence of Catholic France, which cultivated the city as its own. France tended to be at odds with the ordinary townsfolk, which inspired the failed Geneva Revolution of 1782, an attempt to win representation in the government for men of modest means. In 1798, revolutionary France under the Directory annexed Geneva. At the end of the Napoleonic Wars, on 1June 1814, Geneva was admitted to the Swiss Confederation. In 1907, the separation of Church and State was adopted. Geneva flourished in the 19th and 20th centuries, becoming the seat of many international organizations.

==Geography==

===Topography===
Geneva is located at 46°12&#x27; North, 6°09&#x27; East, at the south-western end of Lake Geneva, where the Rhône flows out. It is surrounded by three mountain chains, each belonging to the Jura: the Jura main range lies north-westward, the Vuache southward, and the Salève south-eastward.

The city covers an area of , while the area of the canton is , including the two small exclaves of Céligny in Vaud. The part of the lake that is attached to Geneva has an area of and is sometimes referred to as (&#x27;small lake&#x27;). The canton has only a border with the rest of Switzerland. Of of the border, 103 are shared with France, the department of Ain to the north and west and the department of to the south and east.

Of the land in the city, , or 1.5%, is used for agricultural purposes, while , or 3.1%, is forested. The rest of the land, , or 91.8%, is built up (buildings or roads), , or 3.1%, is either rivers or lakes and , or 0.1%, is wasteland.

Of the built-up area, industrial buildings made up 3.4%, housing and buildings made up 46.2% and transportation infrastructure 25.8%, while parks, green belts and sports fields made up 15.7%. Of the agricultural land, 0.3% is used for growing crops. Of the water in the municipality, 0.2% is composed of lakes and 2.9% is rivers and streams.

The altitude of Geneva is and corresponds to the altitude of the largest of the Pierres du Niton, two large rocks emerging from the lake which date from the last ice age. This rock was chosen by General Guillaume Henri Dufour as the reference point for surveying in Switzerland. The second main river of Geneva is the Arve, which flows into the Rhône just west of the city centre. Mont Blanc can be seen from Geneva and is an hour&#x27;s drive from the city.

===Climate===

The climate of Geneva is a temperate climate, more specifically an oceanic climate (Köppen climate classification: Cfb). Winters are cool, usually with light frosts at night and thawing conditions during the day. Summers are relatively warm. Precipitation is adequate and is relatively well-distributed throughout the year, although autumn is slightly wetter than other seasons. Ice storms near Lac Léman are normal in the winter: Geneva can be affected by the Bise, a north-easterly wind. This can lead to severe icing in winter.

In summer, many people swim in the lake and patronise public beaches such as Genève Plage and the Bains des Pâquis. The city, in certain years, receives snow during colder months. The nearby mountains are subject to substantial snowfall and are suitable for skiing. Many world-renowned ski resorts such as Verbier and Crans-Montana are less than three hours away by car. Mont Salève (), just across the border in France, dominates the southerly view from the city centre, and Mont Blanc, the highest of the Alpine range, is visible from most of the city, towering high above Chamonix, which, along with Morzine, Le Grand Bornand, La Clusaz, and resorts of the Grand Massif such as Samoens, Morillon, and Flaine, are the closest French skiing destinations to Geneva.

===Administrative divisions===

The city is divided into eight &quot;quartiers&quot;, or districts, sometimes composed of several neighbourhoods. On the left bank are: (1) Jonction, (2) Centre, Plainpalais, and Acacias; (3) Eaux-Vives; and (4) Champel. The right bank includes: (1) Saint-Jean and Charmilles; (2) Servette and Petit-Saconnex; (3) Grottes and Saint-Gervais; and (4) Paquis and Nations.

===Government===
The Administrative Council () constitutes the executive government of the city of Geneva and operates as a collegiate authority. It is composed of five councilors (), each presiding over a department. The president of the executive department acts as mayor (). In the governmental year 2021–2022, the Administrative Council is presided over by Frédérique Perler. Departmental tasks, coordination measures and implementation of laws decreed by the Municipal Council are carried out by the Administrative Council. Elections for the Administrative Council are held every five years. The current term of office is from 1June 2020 to 31May 2025. The delegates take office due to a winner-takes-all election (, or ). The mayor and vice change each year, while the heads of the other departments are assigned by the collegiate. The executive body holds its meetings in the Palais Eynard, near the .

 Geneva&#x27;s Administrative Council is made up of two representatives each of the Social Democratic Party (PS) and the Green Party (PES), and one member of the Christian Democratic Party (PDC). This gives the left-wing parties four out of the five seats and, for the first time in history, a female majority in the election held on 15March / 5April 2020. Except for the mayor, all other councillors have been elected for the first time.


===Parliament===

The Municipal Council () holds legislative power. It is made up of 80 members, with elections held every five years. The Municipal Council makes regulations and by-laws that are executed by the Administrative Council and the administration. The delegates are selected by means of a system of proportional representation with a seven percent threshold.
The sessions of the Municipal Council are public. Unlike members of the Administrative Council, members of the Municipal Council are not politicians by profession, and they are paid a fee based on their attendance. Any resident of Geneva allowed to vote can be elected as a member of the Municipal Council. The Council holds its meetings in the Town Hall (), in the old city.

The last election of the Municipal Council was held on 15March 2020 for the term 2020–2025.

In the federal election a total of 36,490 votes were cast, and the voter turnout was 44.1%.

===Metropolitan cooperation===
The city centre of Geneva is located only from the border of France. As a result, the urban area and the metropolitan area largely extend across the border on French territory. Due to the small size of the municipality of Geneva () and extension of the urban area over an international border, official bodies of transnational cooperation were developed as early as the 1970s to manage the cross-border Greater Geneva area at a metropolitan level.

In 1973, a Franco-Swiss agreement created the (&#x27;Franco-Genevan Regional Committee&#x27;, ). In 1997 an &#x27;Urban planning charter&#x27; of the CRFG defined for the first time a planning territory called (&#x27;Franco-Vaud-Genevan urban area&#x27;). 2001 saw the creation of a (&#x27;Strategic Committee for the Development of Regional Public Transports&#x27;, ), a committee which adopted in 2003 a &#x27;Charter for Public Transports&#x27;, first step in the development of a metropolitan, cross-border commuter rail network (see Léman Express).

In 2004, a public transnational body called (&#x27;Franco-Vaud-Genevan urban area project&#x27;) was created to serve as the main body of metropolitan cooperation for the planning territory defined in 1997, with more local French councils taking part in this new public body than in the CRFG created in 1973. Finally in 2012 the was renamed (&#x27;Greater Geneva&#x27;), and the following year it was transformed into a (), a public entity under Swiss law, which now serves as the executive body of the .

The GLCT is made up of the Canton of Geneva, the Nyon District (in the canton of Vaud), and the (literally &#x27;Metropolitan hub of the French Genevan territory&#x27;), this last one a federation of eight French intercommunal councils in Ain and Haute-Savoie. The GLCT extends over and had a population of 1,046,168 in Jan. 2021 (Swiss estimates and French census), 58.3% of them living on Swiss territory, and 41.7% on French territory.

Growth is higher in the French part of the metropolitan area (+1.80% per year between 2010 and 2021) than in the Swiss part (+1.10% per year between 2010 and 2021), as Geneva attracts many French commuters due to high Swiss salaries and a favourable Franco-Swiss tax regime for French residents working in Switzerland.

===Language===

The historical population is given in the following chart:

=== Religion ===

In 2023, the religious composition of Geneva’s permanent resident population aged 15 years and older reflected significant secularism and religious diversity. According to the Federal Statistical Office (OFS), the largest share of the population, 51.1%, identified as either having no religious affiliation (48.8%) or as having an unknown affiliation (2.36%). Christianity, as a whole, accounted for 38.5% of the population, with 26.3% identifying as Catholic, 5.90% as Protestant, and 6.29% belonging to other Christian communities. Among other religious groups, 7.32% of the population identified as Muslim, 1.29% as Jewish, and 1.72% adhered to other religions. 

The recorded 66,491 residents (37.4% of the population) as Catholic, while 41,289 people (23.20%) belonged to no church or were agnostic or atheist, 24,105 (13.5%) belonged to the Swiss Reformed Church, and 8,698 (4.89%) were Muslim. There were also 3,959 members of an Orthodox church (2.22%), 220 individuals (or about 0.12% of the population) who belonged to the Christian Catholic Church of Switzerland, 2,422 (1.36%) who belonged to another Christian church, and 2,601 people (1.46%) who were Jewish. There were 707 individuals who were Buddhist, 474 who were Hindu and 423 who belonged to another church. 26,575 respondents (14.93%) did not answer the question.

According to 2012 statistics by Swiss Bundesamt für Statistik 49.2% of the population were Christian, (34.2% Catholic, 8.8% Swiss Reformed (organized in the Protestant Church of Geneva) and 6.2% other Christians, mostly other Protestants), 38% of Genevans were non-religious, 6.1% were Muslim and 1.6% were Jews.

Geneva has historically been considered a Protestant city and was known as the &quot;Protestant Rome&quot; due to it being the base of John Calvin, William Farel, Theodore Beza and other Protestant reformers. Over the past century, substantial immigration from France and other predominantly Catholic countries, as well as general secularization, has changed its religious landscape. As a result, three times as many Roman Catholics as Protestants lived in the city in 2000, while a large number of residents were members of neither group. Geneva forms part of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Lausanne, Geneva and Fribourg.

The World Council of Churches and the Lutheran World Federation both have their headquarters at the Ecumenical Centre in Grand-Saconnex, Geneva. The World Communion of Reformed Churches, a worldwide organization of Presbyterian, Continental Reformed, Congregational and other Calvinist churches gathering more than 80 million people around the world was based here from 1948 until 2013. The executive committee of the World Communion of Reformed Churches voted in 2012 to move its offices to Hanover, Germany, citing the high costs of running the ecumenical organization in Geneva, Switzerland. The move was completed in 2013. Likewise, the Conference of European Churches have moved their headquarters from Geneva to Brussels.

====&quot;Protestant Rome&quot;====

Prior to the Protestant Reformation the city was &quot;de jure&quot; and &quot;de facto&quot; Catholic. Reaction to the new movement varied across Switzerland. John Calvin went to Geneva in 1536 after William Farel encouraged him to do so. In Geneva, the Catholic bishop had been obliged to seek exile in 1532. Geneva became a stronghold of Calvinism. Some of the tenets created there influenced Protestantism as a whole. St. Pierre Cathedral was where Calvin and his Protestant reformers preached. It constituted the epicentre of the newly developing Protestant thought that would later become known as the Reformed tradition. Many prominent Reformed theologians operated there, including William Farel and Theodore Beza, Calvin&#x27;s successor who progressed Reformed thought after his death.

Geneva was a haven for Calvinists, while Roman Catholics and others considered heretics were persecuted. The case of Michael Servetus, an early Nontrinitarian, is notable. Condemned by both Catholics and Protestants alike, he was arrested in Geneva and burnt at the stake as a heretic by order of the city&#x27;s Protestant governing council. John Calvin and his followers denounced him, and possibly contributed to his sentence.

In 1802, during its annexation to France under Napoleon I, the Diocese of Geneva was united with the Diocese of Chambéry, but the 1814 Congress of Vienna and the 1816 Treaty of Turin stipulated that in the territories transferred to a now considerably extended Geneva, the Catholic religion was to be protected and that no changes were to be made in existing conditions without an agreement with the Holy See. Napoleon&#x27;s common policy granted civil rights to Catholics in Protestant-majority areas, as well as the reverse, and also emancipated Jews. In 1819, the city of Geneva and 20 parishes were united to the Diocese of Lausanne by Pope Pius VII and in 1822, the non-Swiss territory was made into the Diocese of Annecy. A variety of concord with the civil authorities came as a result of the separation of church and state, enacted with strong Catholic support in 1907.

===Crime===

In 2014 the incidence of crimes listed in the Swiss Criminal Code in Geneva was 143.9 per thousand residents. During the same period the rate of drug crimes was 33.6 per thousand residents. The rate of violations of immigration, visa and work permit laws was 35.7 per thousand residents.

== Society and culture ==

=== Media ===
The city&#x27;s main newspaper is the daily &quot;Tribune de Genève&quot;, with a readership of about 187,000. &quot;Le Courrier&quot; mainly focuses on Geneva. Both &quot;Le Temps&quot; (headquartered in Geneva) and &quot;Le Matin&quot; are widely read in Geneva, but cover the whole of the Romandy.

Geneva is the main media center for French-speaking Switzerland. It is the headquarters for the numerous French language radio and television networks of the Swiss Broadcasting Corporation, known collectively as Radio Télévision Suisse. While both networks cover the whole Romandy, special programs related to Geneva are sometimes broadcast on some of the local radio frequencies. Other local radio stations broadcast from the city, including YesFM (FM 91.8 MHz), Radio Cité (non-commercial radio, FM 92.2 MHz), OneFM (FM 107.0 MHz, also broadcast in Vaud), and World Radio Switzerland (FM 88.4 MHz). Léman Bleu is a local TV channel, founded in 1996 and distributed by cable. Due to the proximity to France, many French television channels are also available.

=== Traditions and customs ===
Geneva observes &quot;Jeûne genevois&quot; on the first Thursday following the first Sunday in September. By local tradition, this commemorates the date news of the St. Bartholomew&#x27;s Day massacre of Huguenots reached Geneva.

Geneva celebrates &quot;L&#x27;Escalade&quot; on the weekend nearest 12 December, celebrating the defeat of the surprise attack of troops sent by Charles Emmanuel I, Duke of Savoy during the night of 11–12 December 1602. Festive traditions include chocolate cauldrons filled with vegetable-shaped marzipan treats and the Escalade procession on horseback in seventeenth century armour. Geneva has also been organizing a Escalade race, usually during the first week-end of December. This race takes place around Geneva&#x27;s Old Town, and with more that 50,000 participants is the largest in the country. Non-competitive racers dress up in fancy costumes, while walking in the race.

The Société des Vieux-Grenadiers is a local gentlemen&#x27;s club founded in 1749 and regroups the local political and economical elite. The society has a military branch performing during official events since the late XIXth century.

Since 1818, a particular chestnut tree has been used as the official &quot;herald of the spring&quot; in Geneva. The &quot;sautier&quot; (secretary of the Parliament of the Canton of Geneva) observes the tree and notes the day of arrival of the first bud. While this event has no practical effect, the sautier issues a formal press release and the local newspaper will usually mention the news.

As this is one of the world&#x27;s oldest records of a plant&#x27;s reaction to climatic conditions, researchers have been interested to note that the first bud has been appearing earlier and earlier in the year. During the 19th century many dates were in March or April. In recent years, they have usually been in late February (sometimes earlier). In 2002, the first bud appeared unusually early, on 7 February, and then again on 29 December of the same year. The following year, one of the hottest years recorded in Europe, was a year with no bud. In 2008, the first bud also appeared early, on 19 February.

=== Music and festivals ===

The opera house, the Grand Théâtre de Genève, which officially opened in 1876, was partly destroyed by a fire in 1951 and reopened in 1962. It has the largest stage in Switzerland. It features opera and dance performances, recitals, concerts and, occasionally, theatre. The Victoria Hall is used for classical music concerts. It is the home of the Orchestre de la Suisse Romande.

Every summer the Fêtes de Genève (Geneva Festival) are organised in Geneva. According to Radio Télévision Suisse in 2013 hundreds of thousands of people came to Geneva to see the annual hour-long grand firework display of the Fêtes de Genève.

An annual music festival takes place in June. Groups of artists perform in different parts of the city. In 2016 the festival celebrated its 25th anniversary.

Further annual festivals are the &quot;Fête de l&#x27;Olivier&quot;, a festival of Arabic music, organized by the ICAM since 1980, and the &quot;Genevan Brass Festival&quot;, founded by Christophe Sturzenegger in 2010.

== Education ==

The Canton of Geneva&#x27;s public school system has &quot;écoles primaires&quot; (ages 4–12) and &quot;cycles d&#x27;orientation&quot; (ages 12–15). Students can leave school at 15, but secondary education is provided by &quot;collèges&quot; (ages 15–19), the oldest of which is the Collège Calvin, which could be considered one of the oldest public schools in the world, &quot;écoles de culture générale&quot; (15–18/19) and the &quot;écoles professionnelles&quot; (15–18/19). The &quot;écoles professionnelles&quot; offer full-time courses and part-time study as part of an apprenticeship. Geneva also has a number of private schools.

In 2011 89,244 (37.0%) of the population had completed non-mandatory upper secondary education, and 107,060 or (44.3%) had completed additional higher education (either university or a Fachhochschule). Of the 107,060 who completed tertiary schooling, 32.5% were Swiss men, 31.6% were Swiss women, 18.1% were non-Swiss men and 17.8% were non-Swiss women.

During the 2011–2012 school year, there were a total of 92,311 students in the Geneva school system (primary to university). The education system in the Canton of Geneva has eight years of primary school, with 32,716 students. The secondary school program consists of three lower, obligatory years of schooling, followed by three to five years of optional, advanced study. There were 13,146 lower-secondary students who attended schools in Geneva. There were 10,486 upper-secondary students from the municipality along with 10,330 students who were in a professional, non-university track program. An additional 11,797 students were attending private schools.
Geneva is home to the University of Geneva where approximately 16,500 students are regularly enrolled. In 1559 John Calvin founded the Geneva Academy, a theological and humanist seminary. In the 19th century the academy lost its ecclesiastic links and in 1873, with the addition of a medical faculty, it became the University of Geneva. In 2011 it was ranked European university.

The Geneva Graduate Institute was among the first academic institutions in the world to teach international relations. It is one of Europe&#x27;s most prestigious institutions, offering MA and PhD programmes in anthropology and sociology, law, political science, history, economics, international affairs, and development studies.

Geneva is also home to more than a dozen private, for-profit universities whose activities have come under scrutiny for offering degrees that are not recognized in Switzerland and engaging in &quot;unscrupulous practices&quot;. These schools include the Geneva School of Diplomacy and International Relations, the International University in Geneva, the Geneva Business School and IFM Business School.

The oldest international school in the world is the International School of Geneva, founded in 1924 along with the League of Nations.

== Economy ==
Geneva&#x27;s economy is largely service-driven and closely linked to the rest of the canton. The city is one of the global leaders in financial centres. Three main sectors dominate the financial sector: commodity trading; trade finance, and wealth management.

Around a third of the world&#x27;s free traded oil, sugar, grains and oil seeds is traded in Geneva. Approximately 22% of the world&#x27;s cotton is traded in the Lake Geneva region. Other major commodities traded in the canton include steel, electricity, or coffee. Large trading companies have their regional or global headquarters in the canton, such as Bunge, Cargill, Vitol, Gunvor, BNP Paribas, Trafigura or Mercuria Energy Group, in addition to being home to the world&#x27;s largest shipping company, Mediterranean Shipping Company. Commodity trading is sustained by a strong trade finance sector, with large banks such as BCGE, BCP, BNP Paribas, BCV, Crédit Agricole, Credit Suisse, ING, Société Générale, and UBS, all having their headquarters in the area for this business.

Wealth management is dominated by non-publicly listed banks and private banks, particularly Pictet, Lombard Odier, Edmond de Rothschild Group, Union Bancaire Privée, Mirabaud Group, Dukascopy Bank, Bordier &amp; Cie, Banque SYZ, or REYL &amp; Cie. In addition, the canton is home to the largest concentration of foreign-owned banks in Switzerland, such as HSBC Private Bank, JPMorgan Chase, or Arab Bank.

Behind the financial sector, the next largest major economic sector is watchmaking, dominated by luxury firms such as Patek Philippe, Vacheron Constantin, Chopard, Piaget, Rolex, Roger Dubuis, Franck Muller, F. P. Journe and others, whose factories are concentrated in the Les Acacias neighbourhood, as well as the neighbouring municipalities of Plan-les-Ouates, Satigny, and Meyrin.

Trade finance, wealth management, and watchmaking, approximately contribute two thirds of the corporate tax paid in the canton

Other large multinationals are also headquartered in the city and canton, such as Firmenich (in Satigny), and Givaudan (in Vernier), the world&#x27;s two largest manufacturers of flavours, fragrances and active cosmetic ingredients; SGS, the world&#x27;s largest inspection, verification, testing and certification services company; Temenos, a large banking software provider; or the local headquarters for Procter &amp; Gamble, Japan Tobacco International, or L&#x27;Oréal (in Vernier).

The city of Geneva is also host to the world&#x27;s largest concentration of international organisations and UN agencies, such as the Red Cross, the World Health Organization, the World Trade Organization, the International Telecommunication Union, the World Intellectual Property Organization, the World Meteorological Organization, and the International Labour Organization, as well as the European headquarters of the United Nations.

Its international mindedness, well-connected airport, and centrality in the continent, also make Geneva a good destination for congresses and trade fairs, of which the largest is the Geneva Motor Show held in Palexpo.

Agriculture is commonplace in the hinterlands of Geneva, particularly wheat and wine. Despite its relatively small size, the canton produces around 10% of the Swiss wine and has the highest vineyard density in the country. The largest strains grown in Geneva are gamay, chasselas, pinot noir, gamaret, and chardonnay.

==Infrastructure==

=== Transportation ===


The city is served by the Geneva Airport. It is connected by Geneva Airport railway station () to both the Swiss Federal Railways network and the French SNCF network, including links to Paris, Lyon, Marseille and Montpellier by TGV. Geneva is connected to the motorway systems of both Switzerland (A1 motorway) and France.

Public transport by bus, trolleybus or tram is provided by &quot;Transports Publics Genevois&quot;. In addition to an extensive coverage of the city centre, the network extends to most of the municipalities of the Canton, with a few lines reaching into France. Public transport by boat is provided by the Mouettes Genevoises, which link the two banks of the lake within the city, and by the which serves more distant destinations such as Nyon, Yvoire, Thonon, Évian, Lausanne and Montreux using both modern diesel vessels and vintage paddle steamers.
Trains operated by Swiss Federal Railways connect the airport to the main station of Cornavin in six minutes. Regional train services are being developed towards Coppet and Bellegarde. At the city limits two new railway stations have been opened since 2002: Genève-Sécheron (close to the UN and the Botanical Gardens) and Lancy-Pont-Rouge.

In 2011 work started on the CEVA rail (Cornavin – Eaux-Vives – Annemasse) project, first planned in 1884, which will connect Cornavin with the Cantonal hospital, Eaux-Vives railway station and Annemasse, in France. The link between the main railway station and the classification yard of La Praille already exists; from there, the line runs mostly underground to the Hospital and Eaux-Vives, where it links to the existing line to France. The line fully opened in December 2019, as part of the Léman Express regional rail network.
In May 2013, the demonstrator electric bus system with a capacity of 133 passengers commenced between Geneva Airport and Palexpo. The project aims to introduce a new system of mass transport with electric &quot;flash&quot; recharging of the buses at selected stops while passengers are disembarking and embarking.

Taxis in Geneva can be difficult to find, and may need to be booked in advance, especially in the early morning or at peak hours. Taxis can refuse to take babies and children because of seating legislation.

An ambitious project to close 200 streets in the centre of Geneva to cars was approved by the Geneva cantonal authorities in 2010 and was planned to be implemented over a span of four years (2010–2014), though , work on the project has yet to be started.

=== Utilities ===

Water, natural gas and electricity are provided to the municipalities of the Canton of Geneva by the state-owned Services Industriels de Genève, known as SIG. Most of the drinking water (80%) is extracted from the lake; the remaining 20% is provided by groundwater, originally formed by infiltration from the Arve. 30% of the Canton&#x27;s electricity needs is locally produced, mainly by three hydroelectric dams on the Rhône (Seujet, Verbois and Chancy-Pougny). In addition, 13% of the electricity produced in the Canton is from the burning of waste at the waste incineration facility of Les Cheneviers. The remaining needs (57%) are covered by imports from other cantons in Switzerland or other European countries; SIG buys only electricity produced by renewable methods, and in particular does not use electricity produced using nuclear reactors or fossil fuels. Natural gas is available in the City of Geneva, as well as in about two-thirds of the municipalities of the canton, and is imported from Western Europe by the Swiss company Gaznat. SIG also provides telecommunication facilities to carriers, service providers and large enterprises. From 2003 to 2005, &quot;Voisin, voisine&quot; a fibre-to-the-home pilot project with a triple play offering was launched to test the end-user market in the Charmilles district.

=== Ecological infrastructure ===
In the context of the city&#x27;s Climate Strategy, Geneva&#x27;s &quot;Office cantonal de l&#x27;agriculture et de la nature&quot; (OCAN) has developed and sustained a network of ecological infrastructure, mainly constituted by biological corridors. Its 2021 revision of the Lighting Plan (&quot;Plan Lumière&quot;) further introduces dark infrastructure in the form of black corridors (&quot;Trame Noire).&quot; In 2024, the metropolitan area Geneva created an open data light pollution map encompassing a “dark grid”.

== International organisations ==


Geneva is the European headquarters of the United Nations, in the Palace of Nations building, up the hill from the headquarters of the former League of Nations. Several agencies are headquartered in Geneva, including the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, the World Health Organization, the International Labour Organization, International Telecommunication Union, the International Baccalaureate Organization and the World Intellectual Property Organization.

Apart from the UN agencies, Geneva hosts many inter-governmental organizations, such as the World Trade Organization, the South Centre, the World Meteorological Organization, the World Economic Forum, the International Organization for Migration, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies and the International Committee of the Red Cross.

The Maison de la Paix building hosts the three Geneva centres supported by the Swiss Confederation: the International Centre for Humanitarian Demining, the Centre for the Democratic Control of Armed Forces and the Geneva Centre for Security Policy, as well as other organisations active in the field of peace, international affairs and sustainable development.

Organizations on the European level include the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) and CERN (the European Organization for Nuclear Research) which is the world&#x27;s largest particle physics laboratory.

The Geneva Environment Network (GEN) publishes the Geneva Green Guide, an extensive listing of Geneva-based global organisations working on environmental protection and sustainable development. A website, jointly run by the Swiss Government, the World Business Council for Sustainable Development, the United Nations Environment Programme and the International Union for Conservation of Nature, includes accounts of how NGOs, business, government and the UN cooperate. By doing so, it attempts to explain why Geneva has been picked by so many NGOs and UN bodies as their headquarters&#x27; location.

The World Organization of the Scout Movement and the World Scout Bureau Central Office are headquartered in Geneva.

<text>Gerard Manley Hopkins (28 July 1844 – 8 June 1889) was an English poet and Jesuit priest, whose posthumous fame places him among the leading English poets. His prosody – notably his concept of sprung rhythm – established him as an innovator, as did his praise of God through vivid use of imagery and nature.

Only after his death did Robert Bridges publish a few of Hopkins&#x27;s mature poems in anthologies, hoping to prepare for wider acceptance of his style. By 1930 Hopkins&#x27;s work was seen as one of the most original literary advances of his century. It intrigued such leading 20th-century poets as T. S. Eliot, Dylan Thomas, W. H. Auden, Stephen Spender and Cecil Day-Lewis.

==Early life and family==
Gerard Manley Hopkins was born in Stratford, Essex (now in Greater London), as the eldest of probably nine children to Manley and Catherine Hopkins, née Smith. He was christened at the Anglican church of St John&#x27;s, Stratford. His father founded a marine insurance firm and at one time served as Hawaiian consul-general in London. He was also for a time churchwarden at St John-at-Hampstead. His grandfather was the physician John Simm Smith, a university colleague of John Keats, and close friend of the eccentric philanthropist Ann Thwaytes. One of his uncles was Charles Gordon Hopkins, a politician of the Hawaiian Kingdom, and he was a first cousin of the writer, historian and suffragette Isabel Giberne Sieveking.

As a poet, Hopkins&#x27;s father published works including &quot;A Philosopher&#x27;s Stone and Other Poems&quot; (1843), &quot;Pietas Metrica&quot; (1849), and &quot;Spicelegium Poeticum, A Gathering of Verses by Manley Hopkins&quot; (1892). He reviewed poetry for &quot;The Times&quot; and wrote one novel. Catherine (Smith) Hopkins was the daughter of a London physician, particularly fond of music and of reading, especially German philosophy, literature and the novels of Dickens. Both parents were deeply religious high-church Anglicans. Catherine&#x27;s sister, Maria Smith Giberne, taught her nephew Gerard to sketch. The interest was supported by his uncle, Edward Smith, his great-uncle Richard James Lane, a professional artist, and other family members. Hopkins&#x27;s initial ambition was to be a painter – he would continue to sketch throughout his life and was inspired as an adult by the work of John Ruskin and the Pre-Raphaelites.

Hopkins became a skilled draughtsman. He found his early training in visual art supported his later work as a poet. His siblings drew a lot of inspiration from literature, religion, and the arts. In 1878, Milicent (1849–1946) enrolled in an Anglican sisterhood. Kate (1856–1933) would help Hopkins publish the first edition of his poetry. Hopkins&#x27;s youngest sister Grace (1857–1945) set many of his poems to music. Lionel (1854–1952) became a world-famous expert on archaic and colloquial Chinese. Arthur (1848–1930) and Everard (1860–1928) were highly successful artists. Cyril (1846–1932) would join his father&#x27;s insurance firm.
Manley Hopkins moved his family to Hampstead in 1852, near where John Keats had lived 30 years before and close to the green spaces of Hampstead Heath. When he was ten years old, Gerard was sent to board at Highgate School (1854–1863). While studying Keats&#x27;s poetry, he wrote &quot;The Escorial&quot; (1860), his earliest extant poem. Here he practised early attempts at asceticism. He once argued that most people drank more liquids than they really needed and bet that he could go without drinking for a week. He persisted until his tongue was black and he collapsed at drill. On another occasion, he abstained from salt for a week. Among his teachers at Highgate was Richard Watson Dixon, who became an enduring friend and correspondent. Of the older pupils Hopkins recalls in his boarding house, the poet Philip Stanhope Worsley won the Newdigate Prize.

==Oxford and priesthood==
Hopkins studied classics at Balliol College, Oxford (1863–1867). He began his time in Oxford as a keen socialite and prolific poet but seems to have alarmed himself with resulting changes in his behaviour. There he forged a lifelong friendship with Robert Bridges (later Poet Laureate of the United Kingdom), which would be important to his development as a poet and in establishing his posthumous acclaim. Hopkins was deeply impressed with the work of Christina Rossetti, who became one of his great contemporary influences. The two met in 1864. During this time he studied with the writer and critic Walter Pater, who tutored him in 1866 and remained a friend until Hopkins left Oxford for the second time in October 1879.
In a journal entry of 6 November 1865, Hopkins declared an ascetic intention for his life and work: &quot;On this day by God&#x27;s grace I resolved to give up all beauty until I had His leave for it.&quot; On 18 January 1866, Hopkins composed his most ascetic poem, &quot;The Habit of Perfection&quot;. On 23 January, he included poetry in a list of things to be given up for Lent. In July, he decided to become a Roman Catholic and travelled to Birmingham in September to consult the leader of the Oxford converts, John Henry Newman. Newman received him into the Roman Catholic Church on 21 October 1866.

The decision to convert estranged Hopkins from his family and from a number of acquaintances. After graduating in 1867, he was provided by Newman with a teaching post at the Oratory in Birmingham. While there he began to study the violin. On 5 May 1868 Hopkins firmly &quot;resolved to be a religious.&quot; Less than a week later, he made a bonfire of his poetry and gave it up almost entirely for seven years. He also felt a call to enter the ministry and decided to become a Jesuit. He paused first to visit Switzerland, which officially forbade Jesuits to enter.

In September 1868, Hopkins began his Jesuit novitiate at Manresa House, Roehampton, under the guidance of Alfred Weld. Two years later he moved to St Mary&#x27;s Hall, Stonyhurst, for philosophical studies, taking vows of poverty, chastity and obedience on 8 September 1870. He felt that his interest in poetry had stopped him devoting himself wholly to religion. However, on reading Duns Scotus in 1872, he saw how the two need not conflict. He continued to write a detailed prose journal in 1868–1875. Unable to suppress a desire to describe the natural world, he also wrote music, sketched, and for church occasions, wrote &quot;verses&quot;, as he called them. He later wrote sermons and other religious pieces.

In 1874, Hopkins returned to Manresa House to teach classics. While studying in the Jesuit house of theological studies, St Beuno&#x27;s College, near St Asaph in Wales, he was asked by his religious superior to write a poem to commemorate the foundering of a German ship in a storm. So in 1875 he took up poetry once more to write a lengthy piece, &quot;The Wreck of the Deutschland&quot;, inspired by the &quot;Deutschland&quot; incident, a maritime disaster in which 157 people died, including five Franciscan nuns who had been leaving Germany due to harsh anti-Catholic laws (see Kulturkampf). The work displays both the religious concerns and some of the unusual metre and rhythms of his subsequent poetry not present in his few remaining early works. It not only depicts the dramatic events and heroic deeds but tells of him reconciling the terrible events with God&#x27;s higher purpose. The poem was accepted but not printed by a Jesuit publication. This rejection fed his ambivalence about his poetry, most of which remained unpublished until after his death.
Hopkins chose the austere and restrictive life of a Jesuit and was gloomy at times. His biographer Robert Bernard Martin notes that &quot;the life expectancy of a man becoming a novice at twenty-one was twenty-three more years rather than the forty years of males of the same age in the general population.&quot; The brilliant student who had left Oxford with first-class honours failed his final theology exam. This almost certainly meant that despite his ordination in 1877, Hopkins would not progress in the order. In 1877 he wrote &quot;God&#x27;s Grandeur&quot;, an array of sonnets that included &quot;The Starlight Night&quot;. He finished &quot;The Windhover&quot; only a few months before his ordination. His life as a Jesuit trainee, though rigorous, isolated and sometimes unpleasant, at least had some stability; the uncertain and varied work after ordination was even harder on his sensibilities. In October 1877, not long after completing &quot;The Sea and the Skylark&quot; and only a month after his ordination, Hopkins took up duties as sub-minister and teacher at Mount St Mary&#x27;s College near Sheffield. In July 1878 he became curate at the Jesuit church in Mount Street, London, and in December that of St Aloysius&#x27;s Church, Oxford, then moving to Manchester, Liverpool and Glasgow. While ministering in Oxford, he became a founding member of The Newman Society, established in 1878 for Catholic members of the University of Oxford. He taught Greek and Latin at Mount St Mary&#x27;s College, Sheffield, and Stonyhurst College, Lancashire.

In the late 1880s Hopkins met Matthew Russell of the &quot;Irish Monthly&quot;, who introduced him to Katharine Tynan and W. B. Yeats.

In 1884, Hopkins became a professor of Greek and Latin at University College Dublin. His English roots and disagreement with the Irish politics of the time, along with his small stature (), unprepossessing nature and personal oddities, reduced his effectiveness as a teacher. This and his isolation in Ireland deepened a gloom that was reflected in his poems of the time, such as &quot;I Wake and Feel the Fell of Dark, not Day&quot;. They came to be known as the &quot;terrible sonnets&quot;, not for their quality but according to Hopkins&#x27;s friend Canon Richard Watson Dixon, because they reached the &quot;terrible crystal&quot;, meaning they crystallised the melancholic dejection that plagued the latter part of Hopkins&#x27;s life.

==Final years==
Several influences led to a melancholic state and restricted his poetic inspiration in his last five years. His workload was heavy. He disliked living in Dublin, away from England and friends. He was disappointed at how far Dublin had fallen from its Georgian elegance of the previous century. His general health suffered and his eyesight began to fail. He felt confined and dejected. As a devout Jesuit, he found himself in an artistic dilemma. To subdue an egotism that he felt would violate the humility required by his religious position, he decided never to publish his poems but Hopkins realised that any true poet requires an audience for criticism and encouragement. This conflict between his religious obligations and his poetic talent made him feel he had failed at both.

After several years&#x27; ill health and bouts of diarrhoea, Hopkins died of typhoid fever in 1889 at the age of 44 years and was buried in Glasnevin Cemetery, after a funeral in St Francis Xavier Church in Gardiner Street, located in Georgian Dublin. He is thought to have suffered throughout his life from what today might be labelled bipolar disorder or chronic unipolar depression and battled a deep sense of melancholic anguish. However, his last words on his deathbed were, &quot;I am so happy, I am so happy&quot;.

==Poetry==
===&quot;The sonnets of desolation&quot;===
According to John Bayley, &quot;All his life Hopkins was haunted by the sense of personal bankruptcy and impotence, the straining of &#x27;time&#x27;s eunuch&#x27; with no more to &#x27;spend&#x27; ...&quot;, a sense of inadequacy, graphically expressed in his last sonnets. Toward the end of his life, Hopkins suffered several long bouts of depression. His &quot;terrible sonnets&quot; struggle with problems of religious doubt. He described them to Bridges as &quot;[t]he thin gleanings of a long weary while&quot;.

&quot;Thou Art Indeed Just, Lord&quot; (1889) echoes &quot;Jeremiah&quot; 12:1 in asking why the wicked prosper. It reflects the exasperation of a faithful servant who feels he has been neglected, and is addressed to a divine person (&quot;Sir&quot;) capable of hearing the complaint, but seemingly unwilling to listen. Hopkins uses parched roots as a metaphor for despair.

The image of the poet&#x27;s estrangement from God figures in &quot;I wake and feel the fell of dark, not day&quot;, in which he describes lying awake before dawn, likening his prayers to &quot;dead letters sent To dearest him that lives alas! away.&quot; The opening line recalls Lamentations 3:2: &quot;He hath led me, and brought me into darkness, but not into light.&quot;

&quot;No Worst, There is None&quot; and &quot;Carrion Comfort&quot; are also counted among the &quot;terrible sonnets&quot;.

===Sprung rhythm===
Much of Hopkins&#x27;s historical importance has to do with the changes he brought to the form of poetry, which ran contrary to conventional ideas of metre. Prior to Hopkins, most Middle English and Modern English poetry was based on a rhythmic structure inherited from the Norman side of English literary heritage. This structure is based on repeating &quot;feet&quot; of two or three syllables, with the stressed syllable falling in the same place on each repetition. Hopkins called this structure &quot;running rhythm&quot;, and although he wrote some of his early verse in running rhythm, he became fascinated with the older rhythmic structure of the Anglo-Saxon tradition, of which &quot;Beowulf&quot; is the most famous example.

Hopkins called his own rhythmic structure sprung rhythm. Sprung rhythm is structured around feet with a variable number of syllables, generally between one and four syllables per foot, with the stress always falling on the first syllable in a foot. It is similar to the &quot;rolling stresses&quot; of Robinson Jeffers, another poet who rejected conventional metre. Hopkins saw sprung rhythm as a way to escape the constraints of running rhythm, which he said inevitably pushed poetry written in it to become &quot;same and tame&quot;. In this way, Hopkins&#x27;s sprung rhythm can be seen as anticipating much of free verse. His work has no great affinity with either of the contemporary Pre-Raphaelite and neo-romanticism schools, although he does share their descriptive love of nature and he is often seen as a precursor to modernist poetry, or as a bridge between the two poetic eras.

===Use of language===
Hopkins was a supporter of linguistic purism in English. In an 1882 letter to Robert Bridges, Hopkins writes: &quot;It makes one weep to think what English might have been; for in spite of all that Shakespeare and Milton have done... no beauty in a language can make up for want of purity.&quot; He took time to learn Old English, which became a major influence on his writing. In the same letter to Bridges he calls Old English &quot;a vastly superior thing to what we have now.&quot;

He uses many archaic and dialect words but also coins new words. One example of this is &quot;twindles&quot;, which seems from its context in &quot;Inversnaid&quot; to mean a combination of &quot;twines&quot; and &quot;dwindles&quot;. He often creates compound adjectives, sometimes with a hyphen (such as &quot;dapple-dawn-drawn falcon&quot;) but often without, as in &quot;rolling level underneath him steady air&quot;. This use of compound adjectives, similar to the Old English use of compound nouns via kennings, concentrates his images, communicating to his readers the instress of the poet&#x27;s perceptions of an inscape.

Added richness comes from Hopkins&#x27;s extensive use of alliteration, assonance, onomatopoeia and rhyme, both at the end of lines and internally as in:

Hopkins was influenced by the Welsh language, which he had acquired while studying theology at St Beuno&#x27;s near St Asaph. The poetic forms of Welsh literature and particularly cynghanedd, with its emphasis on repeating sounds, accorded with his own style and became a prominent feature of his work. This reliance on similar-sounding words with close or differing senses means that his poems are best understood if read aloud. An important element in his work is Hopkins&#x27;s own concept of &quot;inscape&quot;, which was derived in part from the medieval theologian Duns Scotus. Anthony Domestico explains,Inscape, for Hopkins, is the charged essence, the absolute singularity that gives each created thing its being; instress is both the energy that holds the inscape together and the process by which this inscape is perceived by an observer. We instress the inscape of a tulip, Hopkins would say, when we appreciate the particular delicacy of its petals, when we are enraptured by its specific, inimitable shade of pink.&quot;

&quot;The Windhover&quot; aims to depict not the bird in general, but instead one instance and its relation to the breeze. This is just one interpretation of Hopkins&#x27;s most famous poem, one which he felt was his best.
During his lifetime, Hopkins published a few poems. It was only through the efforts of Robert Bridges that his works were seen. Despite Hopkins burning all his poems on entering the Jesuit novitiate, he had already sent some to Bridges, who with some other friends, was one of the few people to see many of them for some years. After Hopkins&#x27;s death they were distributed to a wider audience, mostly fellow poets, and in 1918 Bridges, by then poet laureate, published a collected edition; an expanded edition, prepared by Charles Williams, appeared in 1930, and a greatly expanded edition by William Henry Gardner appeared in 1948 (eventually reaching a fourth edition, 1967, with N. H. Mackenzie).

Notable collections of Hopkins&#x27;s manuscripts and publications are in Campion Hall, Oxford; the Bodleian Library, Oxford; and the Foley Library at Gonzaga University in Spokane, Washington.

===Influences===
====Erotic====
In 1970, Timothy d&#x27;Arch Smith, an antiquarian bookseller, ascribed to Hopkins suppressed homoerotic impulses which he views as taking on a degree of specificity after Hopkins met Robert Bridges&#x27;s distant cousin, friend, and fellow Etonian Digby Mackworth Dolben, &quot;a Christian Uranian&quot;.

In 1991, Robert Bernard Martin wrote in his biography &quot;Gerard Manley Hopkins: A Very Private Life&quot;, that when Hopkins first met Dolben, on Dolben&#x27;s 17th birthday in Oxford in February 1865, it &quot;was, quite simply, the most momentous emotional event of [his] undergraduate years, probably of his entire life.&quot; According to Robert Martin, &quot;Hopkins was completely taken with Dolben, who was nearly four years his junior, and his private journal for confessions the following year proves how absorbed he was in imperfectly suppressed erotic thoughts of him.&quot; Martin considered it &quot;probable that [Hopkins] would have been deeply shocked at the reality of sexual intimacy with another person.&quot;
Hopkins had composed two poems about Dolben, &quot;Where art thou friend&quot; and &quot;The Beginning of the End&quot;. Robert Bridges, who edited the first edition of Dolben&#x27;s poems as well as Hopkins&#x27;s, cautioned that the second poem &quot;must never be printed&quot;, though Bridges himself included it in the first edition (1918).
Another indication of the nature of his feelings for Dolben is that Hopkins&#x27;s high Anglican confessor seems to have forbidden him to have any contact with Dolben except by letter. Hopkins never saw Dolben again, and any continuation of their relationship was abruptly ended by Dolben&#x27;s drowning two years later in June 1867. Hopkins&#x27;s feeling for Dolben seems to have cooled by that time, but he was nonetheless greatly affected by his death. &quot;Ironically, fate may have bestowed more through Dolben&#x27;s death than it could ever have bestowed through longer life ... [for] many of Hopkins&#x27;s best poems – impregnated with an elegiac longing for Dolben, his lost beloved and his muse – were the result.&quot; Hopkins&#x27;s relationship with Dolben was explored in the 2017 novel &quot;The Hopkins Conundrum&quot;.

Some of Hopkins&#x27;s poems, such as &quot;The Bugler&#x27;s First Communion&quot; and &quot;Epithalamion&quot;, arguably embody homoerotic themes, although the second poem was arranged by Robert Bridges from extant fragments. In 2006, M. M. Kaylor, argued for Hopkins&#x27;s inclusion with the Uranian poets, a group whose writings derived, in many ways, from prose works of Walter Pater, Hopkins&#x27;s academic coach for his Greats exams and later a lifelong friend.

Some critics have argued that homoerotic readings are either highly tendentious or that they can be classified under the broader category of &quot;homosociality&quot;, over the gender, sexual-specific &quot;homosexual&quot; term. Hopkins&#x27;s journal writings, they argue, offer a clear admiration for feminised beauty. In 2000, Justus George Lawler criticised Robert Martin&#x27;s biography by suggesting that Martin &quot;cannot see the heterosexual beam... for the homosexual biographical mote in his own eye... it amounts to a slanted eisegesis&quot;. The poems that elicit homoerotic readings can be read not merely as exercises in sublimation but as powerful renditions of religious conviction, a conviction that caused strain in his family and even led him to burn some poems that he felt were unnecessarily self-centred. In 2000, Julia Saville viewed the religious imagery in the poems as Hopkins&#x27;s way of expressing the tension with homosexual identity and desire.

Christopher Ricks noted that Hopkins engaged in a number of penitential practices, &quot;but all of these self-inflictions were not self-inflictions to him, and they are his business – or are his understanding of what it was for him to be about his Father&#x27;s business.&quot; Ricks takes issue with Martin&#x27;s apparent lack of appreciation of the importance of the role of Hopkins&#x27;s religious commitment to his writing, and cautions against assigning a priority of influence to any sexual instincts over other factors such as Hopkins&#x27;s estrangement from his family. In 2009, biographer Paul Mariani found in Hopkins poems &quot;an irreconcilable tension – on the one hand, the selflessness demanded by Jesuit discipline; on the other, the seeming self-indulgence of poetic creation.&quot;

====Isolation====
Hopkins spent the last five years of his life as a classics professor at University College Dublin. Hopkins&#x27;s isolation in 1885 was multiple: a Jesuit distanced from his Anglican family and his homeland, an Englishman teaching in Dublin during a time of political strife, and an unpublished poet striving to reconcile his artistic and religious callings. The poem &quot;To seem the stranger&quot; was written in Ireland between 1885 and 1886 and is a poem of isolation and loneliness.

==Influence on others==
Ricks called Hopkins &quot;the most original poet of the Victorian age.&quot; Hopkins is considered as influential as T. S. Eliot in initiating the modernist movement in poetry. His experiments with elliptical phrasing, double meanings and quirky conversational rhythms turned out to be liberating to poets such as W. H. Auden and Dylan Thomas. Hopkins also had a direct influence on the Ghanaian poet and novelist Kojo Laing, whose poem &quot;No needle in the sky&quot; has been called an intercultural translation of Hopkins&#x27;s &quot;The Windhover&quot;. The American author Ron Hansen held the Gerard Manley Hopkins, SJ, Professorship in English at Santa Clara University; his novel &quot;Exiles&quot; dramatises Hopkins&#x27; composition of &quot;The Wreck of the Deutschland.&quot;

The Gerard Manley Hopkins Building in University College Dublin is named after him.

<text>&quot;Cis&quot;–&quot;trans&quot; isomerism, also known as geometric isomerism, describes certain arrangements of atoms within molecules. The prefixes &quot;&quot;cis&quot; and &quot;trans&quot;&quot; are from Latin: &quot;this side of&quot; and &quot;the other side of&quot;, respectively. In the context of chemistry, &quot;cis&quot; indicates that the functional groups (substituents) are on the same side of some plane, while &quot;trans&quot; conveys that they are on opposing (transverse) sides. &quot;Cis&quot;–&quot;trans&quot; isomers are stereoisomers, that is, pairs of molecules which have the same formula but whose functional groups are in different orientations in three-dimensional space. &quot;Cis&quot; and &quot;trans&quot; isomers occur both in organic molecules and in inorganic coordination complexes. &quot;Cis&quot; and &quot;trans&quot; descriptors are not used for cases of conformational isomerism where the two geometric forms easily interconvert, such as most open-chain single-bonded structures; instead, the terms &quot;&quot;syn&quot; and &quot;anti&quot;&quot; are used.

According to IUPAC, &quot;geometric isomerism&quot; is an obsolete synonym of &quot;&quot;cis&quot;–&quot;trans&quot; isomerism&quot;.

&quot;Cis–trans&quot; or geometric isomerism is classified as one type of configurational isomerism.

== Organic chemistry ==
Very often, &quot;cis&quot;–&quot;trans&quot; stereoisomers contain double bonds or ring structures. In both cases the rotation of bonds is restricted or prevented. When the substituent groups are oriented in the same direction, the diastereomer is referred to as &quot;cis&quot;, whereas when the substituents are oriented in opposing directions, the diastereomer is referred to as &quot;trans&quot;. An example of a small hydrocarbon displaying &quot;cis&quot;–&quot;trans&quot; isomerism is but-2-ene. 1,2-Dichlorocyclohexane is another example.

=== Comparison of physical properties ===
&quot;Cis&quot; and &quot;trans&quot; isomers have distinct physical properties. Their differing shapes influences the dipole moments, boiling, and especially melting points.

These differences can be very small, as in the case of the boiling point of straight-chain alkenes, such as pent-2-ene, which is 37 °C in the &quot;cis&quot; isomer and 36 °C in the &quot;trans&quot; isomer. The differences between &quot;cis&quot; and &quot;trans&quot; isomers can be larger if polar bonds are present, as in the 1,2-dichloroethenes. The &quot;cis&quot; isomer in this case has a boiling point of 60.3 °C, while the &quot;trans&quot; isomer has a boiling point of 47.5 °C. In the &quot;cis&quot; isomer the two polar C–Cl bond dipole moments combine to give an overall molecular dipole, so that there are intermolecular dipole–dipole forces (or Keesom forces), which add to the London dispersion forces and raise the boiling point. In the &quot;trans&quot; isomer on the other hand, this does not occur because the two C−Cl bond moments cancel and the molecule has a net zero dipole moment (it does however have a non-zero quadrupole moment).

The differing properties of the two isomers of butenedioic acid are often very different. 
Polarity is key in determining relative boiling point as strong intermolecular forces raise the boiling point. In the same manner, symmetry is key in determining relative melting point as it allows for better packing in the solid state, even if it does not alter the polarity of the molecule. Another example of this is the relationship between oleic acid and elaidic acid; oleic acid, the &quot;cis&quot; isomer, has a melting point of 13.4 °C, making it a liquid at room temperature, while the &quot;trans&quot; isomer, elaidic acid, has the much higher melting point of 43 °C, due to the straighter &quot;trans&quot; isomer being able to pack more tightly, and is solid at room temperature.

Thus, &quot;trans&quot; alkenes, which are less polar and more symmetrical, have lower boiling points and higher melting points, and &quot;cis&quot; alkenes, which are generally more polar and less symmetrical, have higher boiling points and lower melting points.

In the case of geometric isomers that are a consequence of double bonds, and, in particular, when both substituents are the same, some general trends usually hold. These trends can be attributed to the fact that the dipoles of the substituents in a &quot;cis&quot; isomer will add up to give an overall molecular dipole. In a &quot;trans&quot; isomer, the dipoles of the substituents will cancel out due to being on opposite sides of the molecule. &quot;Trans&quot; isomers also tend to have lower densities than their &quot;cis&quot; counterparts.

As a general trend, &quot;trans&quot; alkenes tend to have higher melting points and lower solubility in inert solvents, as &quot;trans&quot; alkenes, in general, are more symmetrical than &quot;cis&quot; alkenes.

Vicinal coupling constants (3&quot;J&quot;HH), measured by NMR spectroscopy, are larger for &quot;trans&quot; (range: 12–18 Hz; typical: 15 Hz) than for &quot;cis&quot; (range: 0–12 Hz; typical: 8 Hz) isomers.

==== Stability ====

Usually for acyclic systems &quot;trans&quot; isomers are more stable than &quot;cis&quot; isomers. This difference is attributed to the unfavorable steric interaction of the substituents in the &quot;cis&quot; isomer. Therefore, &quot;trans&quot; isomers have a less-exothermic heat of combustion, indicating higher thermochemical stability. In the Benson heat of formation group additivity dataset, &quot;cis&quot; isomers suffer a 1.10 kcal/mol stability penalty. Exceptions to this rule exist, such as 1,2-difluoroethylene, 1,2-difluorodiazene (FN=NF), and several other halogen- and oxygen-substituted ethylenes. In these cases, the &quot;cis&quot; isomer is more stable than the &quot;trans&quot; isomer. This phenomenon is called the &quot;cis effect&quot;.

=== &quot;E&quot;–&quot;Z&quot; notation ===

In principle, &quot;cis&quot;–&quot;trans&quot; notation should not be used for alkenes with two or more different substituents. Instead the &quot;E&quot;–&quot;Z&quot; notation is used based on the priority of the substituents using the Cahn–Ingold–Prelog (CIP) priority rules for absolute configuration. The IUPAC standard designations &quot;E&quot; and &quot;Z&quot; are unambiguous in all cases, and therefore are especially useful for tri- and tetrasubstituted alkenes to avoid any confusion about which groups are being identified as &quot;cis&quot; or &quot;trans&quot; to each other.

&quot;Z&quot; (from the German ) means &quot;together&quot;. &quot;E&quot; (from the German ) means &quot;opposed&quot; in the sense of &quot;opposite&quot;. That is, &quot;Z&quot; has the higher-priority groups &quot;cis&quot; to each other and &quot;E&quot; has the higher-priority groups &quot;trans&quot; to each other. Whether a molecular configuration is designated &quot;E&quot; or &quot;Z&quot; is determined by the CIP rules; higher atomic numbers are given higher priority. For each of the two atoms in the double bond, it is necessary to determine the priority of each substituent. If both the higher-priority substituents are on the same side, the arrangement is &quot;Z&quot;; if on opposite sides, the arrangement is &quot;E&quot;.

Because the &quot;cis&quot;–&quot;trans&quot; and &quot;E&quot;–&quot;Z&quot; systems compare different groups on the alkene, it is not strictly true that &quot;Z&quot; corresponds to &quot;cis&quot; and &quot;E&quot; corresponds to &quot;trans&quot;. For example, &quot;trans&quot;-2-chlorobut-2-ene (the two methyl groups, C1 and C4, on the but-2-ene backbone are &quot;trans&quot; to each other) is (&quot;Z&quot;)-2-chlorobut-2-ene (the chlorine and C4 are together because C1 and C4 are opposite).

==== Undefined alkene stereochemistry ====
Wavy single bonds are the standard way to represent unknown or unspecified stereochemistry or a mixture of isomers (as with tetrahedral stereocenters). A crossed double-bond has been used sometimes; it is no longer considered an acceptable style for general use by IUPAC but may still be required by computer software.

== Inorganic chemistry ==
&quot;Cis&quot;–&quot;trans&quot; isomerism can also occur in inorganic compounds.

=== Diazenes ===
Diazenes (and the related diphosphenes) can also exhibit &quot;cis&quot;–&quot;trans&quot; isomerism. As with organic compounds, the &quot;cis&quot; isomer is generally the more reactive of the two, being the only isomer that can reduce alkenes and alkynes to alkanes, but for a different reason: the &quot;trans&quot; isomer cannot line its hydrogens up suitably to reduce the alkene, but the &quot;cis&quot; isomer, being shaped differently, can.
=== Coordination complexes ===
Coordination complexes with octahedral or square planar geometries can also exhibit &quot;cis-trans&quot; isomerism.

For example, there are two isomers of square planar Pt(NH3)2Cl2, as explained by Alfred Werner in 1893. The &quot;cis&quot; isomer, whose full name is &quot;cis&quot;-diamminedichloroplatinum(II), was shown in 1969 by Barnett Rosenberg to have antitumor activity, and is now a chemotherapy drug known by the short name cisplatin. In contrast, the &quot;trans&quot; isomer (transplatin) has no useful anticancer activity. Each isomer can be synthesized using the trans effect to control which isomer is produced.

For octahedral complexes of formula MX4Y2, two isomers also exist. (Here M is a metal atom, and X and Y are two different types of ligands.) In the &quot;cis&quot; isomer, the two Y ligands are adjacent to each other at 90°, as is true for the two chlorine atoms shown in green in &quot;cis&quot;-[Co(NH3)4Cl2]+, at left. In the &quot;trans&quot; isomer shown at right, the two Cl atoms are on opposite sides of the central Co atom.

A related type of isomerism in octahedral MX3Y3 complexes is
facial–meridional (or &quot;fac&quot;–&quot;mer&quot;) isomerism, in which different numbers of ligands are &quot;cis&quot; or &quot;trans&quot; to each other. Metal carbonyl compounds can be characterized as &quot;fac&quot; or &quot;mer&quot; using infrared spectroscopy.

<text>Grímnismál (Old Norse: ; &#x27;The Lay of Grímnir&#x27;) is one of the mythological poems of the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot;. It is preserved in the Codex Regius manuscript and the AM 748 I 4to fragment. It is spoken through the voice of &quot;Grímnir&quot;, one of the many guises of the god Odin. The very name suggests guise, or mask or hood. Through an error, King Geirröth tortured Odin-as-Grímnir, a fatal mistake, since Odin caused him to fall upon his own sword. The poem is written mostly in the ljóðaháttr metre, typical for wisdom verse.

== Structure and history ==
The work starts out with a lengthy prose section describing the circumstances leading up to Grímnir&#x27;s monologue. The monologue itself comprises 54 stanzas of poetic verse describing the worlds and Odin&#x27;s many guises. The third and last part of the poem is also prose, a brief description of Geirröth&#x27;s demise, his son&#x27;s ascension, and Odin&#x27;s disappearance. 

The prose sections were most likely not part of the original oral versions of Grímnismál. Henry Adams Bellows suggests that they were added in the 12th or 13th century and based on some sort of narrative tradition regarding the poem. This is not entirely certain. The poem itself was likely composed in the first half of the 10th century.

== Synopsis ==
Odin and his wife, Frigg, were sitting in Hlidskjalf, looking out on the worlds. They turned their eyes towards King Geirröth, who was reigning in the stead of his late father, King Hrauthung. Geirröth and his older brother Agnarr had been raised by Odin and Frigg, respectively. The god and goddess had disguised themselves as a peasant and his wife, and had taught the children wisdom. Geirröth returned to his father&#x27;s kingdom where he became king upon his father&#x27;s death, while Agnarr dwelt with a giantess in a cave.

In Hliðskjálf, Odin remarked to Frigg that his foster-child Geirröth seemed to be prospering more so than her Agnarr. Frigg retorted that Geirröth was so parsimonious and inhospitable that he would torture his guests if he thought there were too many of them. Odin disputed this, and the couple entered into a wager in this respect. Frigg then sent her maid Fulla to Geirröth, advising him that a magician would soon enter his court to bewitch him, and saying that he could be recognised by the fact that no dog was fierce enough to attack him.

Geirröth heeded Fulla&#x27;s false warning. He ordered his men to capture the man the dogs wouldn&#x27;t attack, which they did. Odin-as-Grímnir, dressed in a dark blue cloak, allowed himself to be captured. He stated that his name was Grímnir, but he would say nothing further of himself.

Geirröth then had him tortured to force him to speak, putting him between two fires for eight nights. After this time, Geirröth&#x27;s son, named Agnarr after the king&#x27;s brother, came to Grímnir and gave him a full horn from which to drink, saying that his father, the king, was not right to torture him.

Grímnir then spoke, saying that he had suffered eight days and nights, without succour from any save Agnarr, Geirröth&#x27;s son, whom Grímnir prophesied would be Lord of the Goths. He then revealed himself for who he was, as the Highest One, promising Agnarr reward for the drink which he brought him.

Shifting from prose to poetry for Odin-as-Grímnir&#x27;s monologue, Grímnir describes at great length the cosmogony of the worlds, the dwelling places of its inhabitants, and himself and his many guises.

Eventually, Grímnir turns to Geirröth and promises him misfortune, revealing his true identity. Geirröth then realized the magnitude of his mistake. Having learned that he is undone, he rose quickly to pull Odin from the fires, but the sword which he had lain upon his knee slipped and fell hilt down, so that when the king stumbled he impaled himself upon it. Odin then vanished, and Agnarr, son of the dead King Geirröth, ruled in his father&#x27;s stead.

==In popular culture==

The 12th album of the comic Valhalla is loosely based on the poem.

In the 2017 Starz television adaptation of Neil Gaiman&#x27;s &quot;American Gods&quot;, the character Mad Sweeney refers to Mr. Wednesday as Grimnir. Mr. Wednesday later emulates Odin&#x27;s reveal of his identity through his various names when revealing his own true nature.

John &quot;Hannibal&quot; Smith, the cigar-smoking leader of a renegade commando squad in the 1980s action television series &quot;The A-Team&quot;.

==Early life==
George Peppard Jr. was born October 1, 1928, in Detroit, the son of building contractor George Peppard Sr and music voice teacher Vernelle Rohrer Peppard. His mother had five miscarriages before giving birth to George. His family lost all their money in the Depression, and his father had to leave George and his mother in Detroit while he went looking for work. Peppard grew up in the Detroit suburb of Dearborn, Michigan. He graduated from Dearborn High School in 1946.

Peppard enlisted in the United States Marine Corps on July 8, 1946, and rose to the rank of corporal, leaving the Corps at the end of his enlistment in January 1948.

During 1948 and 1949, he studied civil engineering at Purdue University where he was a member of the Purdue Playmakers theatre troupe and Beta Theta Pi fraternity. He became interested in acting, being an admirer of Walter Huston in particular. &quot;I just decided I didn&#x27;t want to be an engineer,&quot; he said later. &quot;It was the best decision I ever made.&quot;

Peppard then transferred to Carnegie Institute of Technology (now Carnegie Mellon University) in Pittsburgh, where he earned his bachelor&#x27;s degree in 1955. (It took longer than normal because he dropped out for a year when his father died in 1951 and he had to finish his father&#x27;s jobs.) He also trained at the Pittsburgh Playhouse. While living in Pittsburgh, Peppard worked as a radio DJ at WLOA in Braddock, Pennsylvania. While giving a weather update, he famously called incoming snow flurries &quot;flow snurries&quot;. This was an anecdote he repeated in several later interviews, including one with former NFL player Rocky Bleier for WPXI.

In addition to acting, Peppard was a pilot. He spent a portion of his 1966 honeymoon training to fly his Learjet in Wichita, Kansas.

==Career==
===Theatre===
Peppard made his stage debut in 1949 at the Pittsburgh Playhouse. After moving to New York City, Peppard enrolled in the Actors Studio, where he studied the Method with Lee Strasberg. He did a variety of jobs to pay his way during this time, such as working as a disc jockey, being a radio station engineer, teaching fencing, driving a taxi and being a mechanic in a motorcycle repair shop.

He worked in summer stock in New England and appeared at the open air Oregon Shakespeare Festival in Ashland, Oregon for two seasons.

In August 1955, he appeared in the play &quot;The Sun Dial&quot;.

===Early television appearances and transition to film===
He worked as a cab driver until getting his first part in &quot;Lamp Unto My Feet&quot;. As noted by &quot;Filmink&quot;, &quot;in hindsight, the late 1950s was a perfect time to be a handsome, Method trained male actor of ability with a beautiful speaking voice based in New York – theatre was vibrant, live television provided plenty of work. Peppard found himself in constant employment almost immediately.&quot; He appeared with Paul Newman, in &quot;The United States Steel Hour&quot; (1956), as the singing, guitar-playing baseball player Piney Woods in &quot;Bang the Drum Slowly&quot;, directed by Daniel Petrie.

He appeared in an episode of &quot;Kraft Theatre&quot;, &quot;Flying Object at Three O&#x27;Clock High&quot; (1956).

In March 1956, Peppard was on stage, off Broadway, in &quot;Beautiful Changes&quot;.

In April 1956, he appeared in a segment of an episode of &quot;Cameras Three&quot; performing from &quot;The Shoemaker&#x27;s Holiday&quot;; &quot;The New York Times&quot; called his performance &quot;beguiling&quot;.

In July 1956, he signed to make his film debut in &quot;The Strange One&quot; directed by Jack Garfein, based on the play &quot;End as a Man&quot;. It was the first film from Garfein as director and Calder Willingham as producer, plus for Peppard, Ben Gazzara, Geoffrey Horne, Pat Hingle, Arthur Storch and Clifton James. Filming took place in Florida. &quot;I wouldn&#x27;t say I was nervous,&quot; said Peppard, &quot;just excited.&quot;

On his return to New York, he performed in &quot;Out to Kill&quot; on TV for &quot;Kraft&quot;. In September he joined the cast of &quot;Girls of Summer&quot; directed by Jack Garfein with Shelley Winters, Storch and Hingle, plus a title song by Stephen Sondheim. This reached Broadway in November. Brooks Atkinson said Peppard &quot;expertly plays a sly, malicious dance teacher.&quot; It had only a short run.

The bulk of his work around this time was for television: &quot;The Kaiser Aluminum Hour&quot; (&quot;A Real Fine Cutting Edge&quot;, directed by George Roy Hill), &quot;Studio One in Hollywood&quot; (&quot;A Walk in the Forest&quot;), &quot;The Alcoa Hour&quot; (&quot;The Big Build-Up&quot; with E. G. Marshall), &quot;Matinee Theatre&quot; (&quot;End of the Rope&quot; with John Drew Barrymore, &quot;Thread That Runs So True&quot;, &quot;Aftermath&quot;), &quot;Kraft Theatre&quot; (&quot;The Long Flight&quot;), &quot;Alfred Hitchcock Presents&quot; (&quot;The Diplomatic Corpse&quot;, with Peter Lorre directed by Paul Henreid), and &quot;Suspicion&quot; (&quot;The Eye of Truth&quot; with Joseph Cotten based on a script by Eric Ambler). &quot;The Strange One&quot; came out in April 1957 but despite some strong reviews – &quot;The New York Times&quot; called Peppard &quot;resolute&quot;. – it was not a financial success.

In September 1957, he appeared in a trial run of a play by Robert Thom, &quot;The Minotaur&quot;, directed by Sidney Lumet.

Peppard played a key role in &quot;Little Moon of Alban&quot; (1958) alongside Christopher Plummer for the &quot;Hallmark Hall of Fame&quot;. The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; called him &quot;excellent&quot;.

In May 1958, Peppard played his second film role, a support part in the Korean War movie &quot;Pork Chop Hill&quot; (1959) directed by Lewis Milestone. He was cast in part because he was unfamiliar to moviegoers.

In May 1958, he appeared in stock in &quot;A Swim in the Sea&quot;.

In October 1958, Peppard appeared on Broadway in &quot;The Pleasure of His Company&quot; (1958) starring Cyril Ritchard, who also directed. Peppard played the boyfriend who wants to marry Dolores Hart who was Ritchard&#x27;s daughter; &quot;The New York Times&quot; called Peppard &quot;admirable&quot;. The play was a hit and ran for a year.

During the show&#x27;s run, Peppard auditioned successfully for MGM&#x27;s &quot;Home from the Hill&quot; (1960) and the studio signed him to a long-term contract – which he had not wanted to do but was a condition for the film. In February 1959, Hedda Hopper announced Peppard would leave &quot;Company&quot; to make two films for MGM: &quot;Home from the Hill&quot; and &quot;The Subterraneans&quot;.

&quot;Home from the Hill&quot; was a prestigious film directed by Vincente Minnelli and starring Robert Mitchum, who played Peppard&#x27;s father. It featured several young actors MGM were hoping to develop, including Peppard, George Hamilton, and Luana Patten. During filming, Peppard said &quot;Brando is a dead talent – I saw him in &quot;The Young Lions&quot;&quot; – but said Peck is &quot;a man of integrity as a star and a person. Lee Strasberg is the only person I know who is brilliant.&quot;

&quot;I want to be an actor and proud of my craft&quot;, said Peppard. &quot;I would like to be an actor who is starred but being a star is something you can&#x27;t count on whereas acting is something I can work on.&quot; It was a success at the box office, although the film&#x27;s high cost meant that it was not profitable.

Peppard&#x27;s next film for MGM was &quot;The Subterraneans&quot;, an adaptation of the 1958 novel by Jack Kerouac co starring Leslie Caron. It flopped and Peppard said &quot;I couldn&#x27;t get arrested&quot; afterwards.

He had meant to follow &quot;The Subterraneans&quot; by returning to Broadway with Julie Harris in &quot;The Warm Peninsular&quot; but this did not happen. In April 1959 Hedda Hopper said he would be in &quot;Chatauqua&quot; but that was not made until a decade later, starring Elvis Presley, as &quot;The Trouble with Girls&quot; (1969). At the end of 1959 Hopper predicted Peppard would be a big star saying &quot;he has great emotional power, is a fine athlete, and does offbeat characters such as James Dean excelled in.&quot; Sol Siegel announced he would play the lead in &quot;Two Weeks in Another Town&quot;. (Kirk Douglas ended up playing it.) He was also announced for the role of Arthur Blake in a film about the first Olympics called &quot;And Seven from America&quot; which was never made.

Peppard returned to television to star in an episode of the anthology series &quot;Startime&quot;, &quot;Incident at a Corner&quot; (1960) under the direction of Alfred Hitchcock alongside Vera Miles.

He played Teddy Roosevelt on television in an episode of &quot;Our American Heritage&quot;, &quot;The Invincible Teddy&quot; (1961).

===Stardom===

His good looks, elegant manner and acting skills landed Peppard his most famous film role as Paul Varjak in &quot;Breakfast at Tiffany&#x27;s&quot; with Audrey Hepburn, based on the novella of the same name by Truman Capote. Director Blake Edwards had not wanted Peppard, but was overruled by the producers. He was cast in July 1960. During filming Peppard did not get along with Hepburn or Patricia Neal, the latter calling him &quot;cold and conceited&quot;. According to &quot;Filmink&quot; the film confirmed that &quot;Peppard’s strength as a leading man was being a solid centre to a movie, someone who could ground the drama around him...he would never have the pull to carry a movie on his own, but he could, in tandem, with another element.&quot;

In November 1961, a newspaper article dubbed him &quot;the next big thing&quot;. Peppard said he had turned down two TV series and was &quot;concentrating on big screen roles.&quot; His contract with MGM was for two pictures a year, allowing for one outside film and six TV appearances a year, plus the right to star in a play every second year. &quot;In a series you don&#x27;t have time to develop a character,&quot; he said. &quot;There&#x27;s no build up; in the first segment you&#x27;re already established.&quot;

He was meant to appear in &quot;Unarmed in Paradise&quot; which was not made. He bought a script by Robert Blees called &quot;Baby Talk&quot; but it was also unmade.

Instead, MGM cast him in the lead of their epic western &quot;How the West Was Won&quot; in 1962.(His character spanned three sections of the episodic Cinerama extravaganza.) It was a massive hit.

He followed this with a war story for Carl Foreman, &quot;The Victors&quot; (1963), made in Europe. He was offered $200,000 to appear in &quot;The Long Ships&quot; but did not want to go to Yugoslavia for six months. He was going to do &quot;Next Time We Love&quot; with Ross Hunter but it was never made.

He starred in &quot;The Carpetbaggers&quot;, a 150-minute saga of a ruthless, Hughes-like aviation and film mogul based on the best-selling novel of the same name by Harold Robbins. The cast included Elizabeth Ashley, who had an affair with Peppard during filming and later married him. She described him as &quot;some kind of Nordic god – six feet tall with beautiful blond hair, blue eyes and a body out of every high school cheerleader&#x27;s teenage lust fantasy.&quot; Ashley claimed Peppard &quot;was never late on set and he had nothing but scorn for actors who weren&#x27;t professional enough to keep that together.&quot;

She added that Peppard:
Never was one of those actors who believes his job is to take the money, hit the mark and say the lines and let it go at that. He felt that as an above-the-title star he had the responsibility to use his muscle and power to try and make it better and that has never stopped in him. He was unrelenting about it, to the point where a lot of executives and directors came to feel he was a pain in the ass. But the really talented people loved working with him because of all his wonderful creative energy.

&quot;My performances bore me&quot;, said Peppard in a 1964 interview, adding that his ambition was to deliver &quot;one great performance. And I must say I feel a little presumptuous to shoot for that. But that&#x27;s the goal, like a hockey goal. I figure I&#x27;ve got a choice ... not of the outcome but of the objective. And my objective is that one performance.&quot;

Peppard returned to television to do &quot;Bob Hope Presents the Chrysler Theatre&quot;, &quot;The Game with Glass Pieces&quot;. In March 1964 he tried to break his MGM contract to make &quot;The Great Adventure&quot; for Anthony Mann.

For MGM, he appeared in &quot;Operation Crossbow&quot; (1965), a war film with Sophia Loren. It was the first film he made under a new contract with MGM to do one movie a year for three years.

He was meant to follow this with an adaptation of the play &quot;Merrily We Roll Along&quot; but it was never made.

&quot;I&#x27;m an actor not a star,&quot; he said around this time, adding that he looked for &quot;three things&quot; in a film, &quot;a good director, a good part and a good script. If I get two out of three of those I&#x27;m satisfied.&quot;

Peppard starred in a thriller, &quot;The Third Day&quot; (1965) with Ashley who had become his second wife. The film was directed by Jack Smight who claimed Warner Bros only agreed to finance it because they had a deal with Peppard. Peppard said when he made the film &quot;I wasn&#x27;t just broke I was up to my ears in debt.&quot;

He was announced for &quot;The Last Night of Don Juan&quot; for Michael Gordon but it was not made. He was cast as the lead in &quot;Sands of the Kalahari&quot; (1965) at a fee of $200,000 but walked off the set after only a few days of filming in March 1965 and had to be replaced by Stuart Whitman. Paramount sued Peppard for $930,555 in damages and he countersued.

Ashley later wrote:
What tormented George so badly was that he was caught between being an actor and a movie star. He did not start off as an untalented pretty nothing who had to be grateful for any piece of meat that was thrown his way. He was intelligent and talented but because he was six foot tall with blond hair and blue eyes he had been put in the slot of being a movie star at a time when the movie studios were still very powerful and expected you to play the game by their rules ... I don&#x27;t think it was possible to be a male movie star who looked like he did and got hot when he did and not be trapped by it.
He had a huge hit with &quot;The Blue Max&quot; (1966), playing a German World War One ace, alongside James Mason and Ursula Andress, directed by John Guillermin. &quot;He could carry these big films,&quot; said &quot;Filmink&quot;.

Film critic David Shipman writes of this stage in his career:
Peppard played a German Jew fighting for the Allies in &quot;Tobruk&quot; (1967) alongside Rock Hudson. &quot;It&#x27;s a big mistake to think I&#x27;m making a lot of money and turning out a lot of crap,&quot; he said in a 1966 interview.

===Decline===
Seeking to ensure his financial security, Peppard bought a cattle ranch. The funding required by this venture prompted Peppard to sign a multi-million-dollar, five-picture contract with Universal in August 1966 – two films for the first year, then one each in the following three. Ashley claimed this ultimately hurt Peppard&#x27;s career.

The first two films under the contract were &quot;Rough Night in Jericho&quot; (1967), a Western with Dean Martin, and &quot;What&#x27;s So Bad About Feeling Good?&quot; (1968), a comedy directed by George Seaton with Mary Tyler Moore; these were followed by a detective film directed by Guillermin, &quot;P.J.&quot; (1968), and &quot;House of Cards&quot; (1968), a thriller directed by Guillermin and shot in Europe. None of these films was particularly successful at the box office. Ashley says that doing these films caused Peppard to start drinking. She also claimed Peppard turned down &quot;The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter&quot; because he did not want to play a weak or possibly homosexual character.

In 1967, he bought the script &quot;Midnight Fair&quot; by Sheridan Greenway, to produce. In 1968, he announced that he had co-written a script, &quot;Watch Them Die&quot;, which he planned to direct, but not play a starring role in. It was never made. Neither was a version of &quot;The Most Dangerous Game&quot; for MGM, announced in 1967.

Peppard starred in the crime drama &quot;Pendulum&quot; (1969), directed by George Schaefer with Jean Seberg, and traveled to England to star in &quot;The Executioner&quot; (1970) opposite Joan Collins. In &quot;Cannon for Cordoba&quot; (1970), Peppard played the steely Captain Rod Douglas, who has been put in charge of gathering a group of soldiers on a dangerous mission into Mexico. His fees for these were $400,000 plus a percentage. He was scheduled to make &quot;The Plot&quot; at Fox but this does not seem to have been made.

Peppard instead was in &quot;One More Train to Rob&quot; (1971), another Western, at Universal. Ashley wrote &quot;he became more and more frustrated and disillusioned from hating the kind of pictures he had to do. There were no good scripts, no good directors and at some point it became icily clear that there weren&#x27;t going to be any.&quot;

In September 1970, he toured Vietnam with a USO show.

===Return to TV===
In March 1971, Peppard announced that his company, Tradewind Productions, had optioned a novel by Stanley Ellin, &quot;The Eighth Circle&quot;, but it was not made.

Peppard starred in a Western TV movie &quot;The Bravos&quot; (1972) with Pernell Roberts. He returned to features with &quot;The Groundstar Conspiracy&quot; (1972) co-starring Michael Sarrazin, shot in Canada for Universal; Peppard&#x27;s fee was $400,000.

In August 1971, Peppard signed to star in &quot;Banacek&quot; (1972–1974), part of &quot;The NBC Mystery Movie&quot; series, starring in 90-minute whodunits as a wealthy Boston playboy who solves thefts for insurance companies for a finder&#x27;s fee. Sixteen regular episodes were produced over two seasons. Peppard also did some second unit directing. &quot;Ever since &quot;The Carpetbaggers&quot; I&#x27;ve played the iron-jawed cold-eyed killer and that gets to be a goddamned bore,&quot; he said in 1972. &quot;Acting is not the most creative thing in the world and when you play a man of action it gets to be a long day. Banacek is the best character I&#x27;ve played in a long time.&quot;

In February 1972, Peppard stood trial in Boston, accused of attempting to rape a stripper in his hotel room. He was cleared of the charges. The same year, he and Ashley were divorced, with Peppard to pay her $2,000 per month alimony plus $350 per month child support for their son Christian.

Peppard starred in &quot;Newman&#x27;s Law&quot; (1974), an action film originally called &quot;Newman&quot;. When &quot;Banacek&quot; ended Peppard wanted to take time off to focus on producing and directing, including a project called &quot;The Total Beast&quot;. However alimony and child support obligations forced him back to acting. He made some TV movies &quot;One of Our Own&quot; (1975), a medical drama, and &quot;Guilty or Innocent: The Sam Sheppard Murder Case&quot; (1975), as Sam Sheppard, for which his fee was $100,000. &quot;One of Our Own&quot; had been a pilot for a TV series which was picked up – &quot;Doctors&#x27; Hospital&quot; (1975) lasted 15 episodes.

Peppard starred in the science-fiction film &quot;Damnation Alley&quot; (1977), which has gone on to attain a substantial cult following in the years since. Peppard&#x27;s role in the film was reportedly turned down by Steve McQueen because of salary issues. The movie cost $8.5 million. Peppard said Jack Smight&#x27;s original director&#x27;s cut was &quot;wonderful&quot; but claimed many of the key scenes in the film were cut when it was re-edited by executives.

With fewer interesting roles coming his way, he acted in, directed and produced the drama &quot;Five Days from Home&quot; in 1979.

===&quot;Five Days from Home&quot;===
Peppard later said the low point of his career came over a three-year period around the time of &quot;Five Days from Home&quot;. &quot;It was a bad time&quot;, he said in 1983. &quot;I was heavily in debt. My career seemed to be going nowhere. Not much work over a three-year period. Every morning I&#x27;d wake up and realize I was getting deeper and deeper into debt&quot;.

He had to sell his car and take out a second mortgage on his home to finance &quot;Five Days from Home&quot;. Eventually, he got his money back and was able to concentrate on his career.&quot;I&#x27;m quite proud of it&quot;, he said in 1979. &quot;I sold many assets to help make it but I don&#x27;t mind. It was the best time of my life.&quot;

He had the lead in the TV movies &quot;Crisis in Mid-air&quot; (1979) and &quot;Torn Between Two Lovers&quot; (1979) and went to Europe for &quot;From Hell to Victory&quot; (1979).

In a rare game show appearance, Peppard did a week of shows on &quot;Password Plus&quot; in 1979, in which he could often be seen smoking cigarettes while filming. Out of five shows, the first was never broadcast on NBC, but aired much later on GSN and Buzzr, because of on-camera comments made by Peppard regarding personal dissatisfaction he felt related to his treatment by the NBC officials who supervised the production of &quot;Password Plus&quot;. As a result of this, Goodson-Todman banned Peppard from appearing on any of their game shows ever again for that incident, which cost them a lot since they had to film an extra episode two weeks later to make up for the pulled episode.

In April 1979, Peppard said &quot;I want to act again – and I need a good role. The Sam Shepherd story I did for TV was the only good role I&#x27;ve had in the last seven to ten years.&quot; He added he was developing two movies and a TV drama series plus an educational series.

===&quot;Dynasty&quot;===
In 1980, Peppard was offered, and accepted, the role of Blake Carrington in the television series &quot;Dynasty&quot;. During the filming of the pilot episode, which also featured Linda Evans and Bo Hopkins, Peppard repeatedly clashed with the show&#x27;s producers, Richard and Esther Shapiro; among other things, he felt that his role was too similar to that of J. R. Ewing in the series &quot;Dallas&quot;. Three weeks later, before filming of additional episodes was set to begin, Peppard was fired and the part was offered to John Forsythe; the scenes with Peppard were re-shot and Forsythe became the permanent star of the show. Joan Collins says she was pleased he didn&#x27;t get the role as she &quot;hated him&quot; following an alleged sexual assault incident.

&quot;It was a big blow,&quot; Peppard noted subsequently, adding he felt Forsythe ultimately did &quot;a better job (as Blake Carrington) than I could have done.&quot; Ironically, this led to his being available to be cast in NBC&#x27;s &quot;The A-Team&quot;, the number one rated television show in its first season in 1982.

&quot;I&#x27;m so glad I wasn&#x27;t drinking&quot;, he said later, having stopped in 1979. &quot;I bet a lot of people thought when I did certain things, I had been drinking and now they found out it wasn&#x27;t the booze at all. It was me.&quot;

During that same period, Peppard also had a role as a cowboy in the science fiction film &quot;Battle Beyond the Stars&quot; (1980). He travelled to Canada to make &quot;Your Ticket Is No Longer Valid&quot; (1981) with Richard Harris, to New Zealand for &quot;Race for the Yankee Zephyr&quot; (1982) and Spain for &quot;Hit Man&quot; (1982).

&quot;I almost disappeared for awhile, between ages 45 and 55&quot;, he later reflected. &quot;Nobody wants to work with someone who quits three series. They think you&#x27;re insane to quit a series with all the millions of dollars to be made there. It gets to be like crossing the mob. You find out some people you thought were your friends aren&#x27;t really.&quot;

===&quot;The A-Team&quot;===
In 1982, Peppard auditioned for and won the role of Colonel John &quot;Hannibal&quot; Smith in the television action adventure series &quot;The A-Team&quot;, acting alongside Mr. T, Dirk Benedict and Dwight Schultz. In the series, the A-Team was a team of renegade commandos on the run from the military for &quot;a crime they did not commit&quot; while serving in the Vietnam War. The A-Team members made their collective living as soldiers of fortune, but they helped only people who came to them with justified grievances.

As &quot;Hannibal&quot; Smith, Peppard played the leader of the A-Team, distinguished by his cigar smoking, confident smirk, black leather gloves, disguises, and distinctive catchphrase, &quot;I love it when a plan comes together.&quot; Peppard was attracted to the role partly because Smith was a master of disguise enabling Peppard to play a variety of characters. &quot;I love the character of Hannibal,&quot; he said. &quot;It inspires my fantasy. And, frankly, I need the money.&quot;

&quot;I wanted to change from leading man to character actor for years now but have never been given the chance before&quot;, he added.

The show started filming in late 1982 and premiered in January 1983. It was an instant ratings success, going straight into the top ten most watched shows in the country. The series, which ran for five seasons on NBC from 1983 to 1987, made Peppard known to a new generation and is arguably his best-known role. His fee was reportedly $50,000 an episode. This went up to $65,000, making him one of the best paid stars on television.

Peppard said &quot;the first year of the show &quot;it was kind of like &quot;Monty Python&quot; – absolutely ridiculous. It was fresh, it was fun, it was silly – building an airplane out of a lawn-mower engine – fun stuff done very straight.&quot; After that, though &quot;it became very boring to me and not very good.&quot;

The role was reportedly written originally with James Coburn in mind, but Coburn declined, and thus it went to Peppard. It was reported that Peppard was annoyed by Mr. T upstaging him in his public image, and at one point in their relationship, refused to speak directly to Mr. T. Instead, he sent messages through intermediaries (including at times fellow cast members, particularly Dirk Benedict), and for this, Peppard was occasionally portrayed by the press as not a team player. Melinda Culea claimed it was Peppard who got her fired after the first season.

&quot;It&#x27;s the first time I ever had money in the bank&quot;, Peppard said later. &quot;Four California divorces and 25 years of alimony will see to it you have no money in the bank. It was a giant boost to my career, and made me a viable actor for other roles.&quot;

During the series&#x27; run Peppard guest starred on the &quot;Tales of the Unexpected&quot; episode &quot;The Dirty Detail&quot; (1983).

===Later career===
Peppard&#x27;s last series was intended to be several television movie features entitled &quot;Man Against the Mob&quot; (1988) and set in the 1940s. In these TV detective films, Peppard played Los Angeles Police Detective Sgt. Frank Doakey. The second film &quot;Man Against the Mob: The Chinatown Murders&quot; was broadcast in December 1989. A third film in this series was planned, but Peppard died before it was filmed.

In his later years, Peppard appeared in several stage productions. In 1988, he portrayed Ernest Hemingway in the play &quot;PAPA&quot;, which played a number of cities including Boise, Idaho; Atlanta, Georgia; and San Francisco. Peppard financed it, and played in it. In 1988, he said, &quot;Once I saw this thing, I knew that if I was going to do it, I&#x27;d have to stick with it. I&#x27;ve got a couple bucks in the bank, so I&#x27;m not working on anything else. I got an adrenaline rush when I first read this play – part joy, part fear.&quot; Peppard said he understood Hemingway. &quot;We were both married four times; that&#x27;s one similarity. Up until ten years ago I used to drink a lot, as he did. And then, he had to deal with living the life of a famous person.&quot;

The play was well received. Peppard said of his image, &quot;There&#x27;s a George Peppard out there that I don&#x27;t know. He&#x27;s been written about, and various people have interpreted him various ways. There are people who&#x27;ve made up stories, apocryphal, about me. There are people who didn&#x27;t like me much.&quot;

He appeared in &quot;Silence Like Glass&quot; (1989) and &quot;Night of the Fox&quot; (1990). In 1989, he said &quot;I&#x27;m afraid I&#x27;m typecast. It was discouraging when it first happened. I was sad. I had hoped to do lots of different kinds of roles. But fear and insecurity guides casting decisions. Movies and TV have to make money. And people get used to you playing a part and doing certain things. If you don&#x27;t do it, they get disappointed and it shows up at the box office.&quot;

In 1990, he was seeking financing for &quot;The Crystal Contract&quot;, a film about an international cocaine cartel that he would produce and in which he would star, but it was never made. &quot;I would like to do another series because it would mean steady work – and because I would like one more hit.&quot;

In 1992, he toured in &quot;The Lion in Winter&quot;, in which he played Henry II to Susan Clark&#x27;s Eleanor of Aquitaine. &quot;I haven&#x27;t been as happy as I am for a long time,&quot; he said. &quot;When you find a part you are right for and you love, it&#x27;s a source of happiness, believe me... If I could have my wish come true, I&#x27;d spend the next two years doing nothing but this play.&quot;

His last television role was guest-starring in a 1994 episode of &quot;Matlock&quot; entitled &quot;The P.I&quot;. The episode, co-starring Tracy Nelson, was meant to serve as a backdoor pilot for a series about a father and his estranged daughter both working as private investigators. The episode aired eight days before Peppard&#x27;s death.

==Personal life==
Peppard was married four times and was the father of three children.
*Helen Davies (1954–1964): two children, Bradford and Julie. Ms. Davies never remarried. 
*Elizabeth Ashley (1966–1972), his co-star in &quot;The Carpetbaggers&quot; and &quot;The Third Day&quot;: one son, Christian. In accordance with their 1972 divorce settlement, Peppard paid Ashley $2,000 per month in alimony for four years, and $350 per month in child support for their son Christian Peppard. Ashley&#x27;s two awards were nullified in 1975 when she married James McCarthy, whom she divorced in 1981.
*Sherry Boucher (1975–1979), a realtor from Springhill, Louisiana, who subsequently married John Lytle.
*Alexis Adams (1984–1986), also known as Joyce Ann Furbee, a TV actress.

In 1990, he said, &quot;Getting married and having a bad divorce is just like breaking your leg. The same leg, in the same place. I&#x27;m lucky I don&#x27;t walk with a cane.&quot;

Peppard resided in a Greek revival-style white cottage in Hollywood Hills, California, until the time of his death. His home featured elegant porches on three sides and a guest house in the back. Later owned by designer Brenda Antin, who spent a year renovating it, the small home was purchased by writer/actress Lena Dunham in 2015 for $2.7 million.

Peppard overcame a serious alcohol problem in 1978, after which he became deeply involved in helping other alcoholics. &quot;I knew I had to stop and I did&quot;, he said in 1983. &quot;Looking back now I&#x27;m ashamed of some of the things I did when I was drinking.&quot;

Peppard smoked three packs of cigarettes a day for most of his life. After a diagnosis of lung cancer in 1992 and an operation to remove part of one lung, he quit smoking.

Despite health problems in his later years, he continued acting. In 1994, just before his death, Peppard completed a pilot with Tracy Nelson for a new series called &quot;The P.I.&quot; It aired as an episode of &quot;Matlock&quot; and was to be spun off into a new television series with Peppard playing an aging detective and Nelson his daughter and sidekick.

On May 8, 1994, while still battling lung cancer, Peppard died from pneumonia in Los Angeles.

==Critical appraisal==
David Shipman published this appraisal of Peppard in 1972:
In 1990, Peppard said, &quot;An enormous amount of my film work has been spent charging up a hill saying, &#x27;Follow me, men! This way!&#x27; Even though I did &quot;Breakfast at Tiffany&#x27;s&quot;, nobody seemed to think I could do comedy. I always played the man of action. And men of action are not terribly deep characters, and not real vocal characters.&quot;

He added, &quot;I trained for seven years before I started getting screen work as a stage actor. I love working for an audience. Aside from that, despite all the uniforms and the guns, I think I am at my base a character actor... Being a star has never interested me. Stars, , are a pain. Stars to me are in the sky. The important question is, &#x27;How good an actor are you?&#x27; And now I have some hope, because I&#x27;m of an age where I could be considered for character roles.&quot;

Shortly before he died, he said, &quot;If you look at my movie list, you&#x27;ll see some really good movies and then the start of ones that were not so good. But I was making enough money to send my children to good schools, have a house for them and give them a center in their lives.&quot;

==Awards==
