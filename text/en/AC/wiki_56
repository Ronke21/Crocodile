<text>Gone with the Wind is a novel by American writer Margaret Mitchell, first published in 1936. The story is set in Clayton County and Atlanta, both in Georgia, during the American Civil War and Reconstruction Era. It depicts the struggles of young Scarlett O&#x27;Hara, the spoiled daughter of a well-to-do plantation owner, who must use every means at her disposal to claw her way out of poverty following Sherman&#x27;s destructive &quot;March to the Sea.&quot; This historical novel features a coming-of-age story, with the title taken from the poem &quot;Non Sum Qualis eram Bonae Sub Regno Cynarae&quot;, written by Ernest Dowson.

&quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; was popular with American readers from the outset and was the top American fiction bestseller in 1936 and 1937. As of 2014, a Harris poll found it to be the second favorite book of American readers, just behind the Bible. More than 30 million copies have been printed worldwide.

&quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; is a controversial reference point for subsequent writers of the South, both black and white. Scholars at American universities refer to, interpret, and study it in their writings. The novel has been absorbed into American popular culture.

Mitchell received the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction for the book in 1937. It was adapted into the 1939 film of the same name, which is considered to be one of the greatest movies ever made and also received the Academy Award for Best Picture during the 12th annual Academy Awards ceremony. &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; is the only novel by Mitchell published during her lifetime.

==Plot==
===Part I===
It is April 15, 1861, the eve of a rebellion in which seven southern states declare their secession from the United States (the &quot;Union&quot;) over a desire to continue the institution of slavery, which was the economic engine of the South. In one of those states, Georgia, the family of wealthy Irish immigrant Gerald O&#x27;Hara owns a plantation (Tara).

The oldest of the three O&#x27;Hara daughters, 16-year-old Scarlett, is dismayed to learn that the man she secretly loves, her county neighbor Ashley Wilkes, is set to announce his engagement to his cousin Melanie Hamilton. The next day, the Wilkeses throw an all-day party at their estate (&quot;Twelve Oaks&quot;) where Scarlett notices someone leering at her. He turns out to be Rhett Butler, who has a reputation for seducing young women. Throughout the day, Scarlett attempts to turn Ashley&#x27;s head by flirting with every man present, including Melanie&#x27;s brother Charles Hamilton. In the afternoon, Scarlett gets Ashley alone and confesses her love for him, convinced he will return it. However, he says only that he cares for her as a friend and intends to marry Melanie. Stung, Scarlett insults Ashley and accuses him of being too cowardly to submit to his real feelings for her. As Ashley departs, Rhett reveals he has overheard their whole exchange. Scarlett feels humiliated.

Later, war is declared, and the men are going to enlist. Feeling petty and vengeful, Scarlett accepts Charles&#x27;s marriage proposal. They marry, and two weeks later, Charles goes to war, where he dies of measles two months later. Scarlett gives birth to his child, Wade Hampton Hamilton. As a widow, she is bound to dye her dresses black, wear a veil in public, and avoid conversations with young men. Scarlett secretly mourns the loss of her youth, not the husband she barely knew.

===Part II===
Scarlett&#x27;s mother, mistaking Scarlett&#x27;s depression for grief, suggests that living with Melanie might lift her spirits. Melanie is living in Atlanta with her Aunt Sarah Jane, who is called by her childhood nickname &quot;Pittypat.&quot; After moving there, Scarlett&#x27;s spirit is revived by the excitement of living in a growing city. She busies herself with hospital work and sewing circles for the Confederate Army. However, her heart is not in itshe does it primarily to avoid being gossiped about by the other women of Atlanta society. Additionally, she believes her efforts may aid Ashley, with whom she is still in love.

Scarlett is mortified when she runs into Rhett while staffing a sales stall at a public dance benefiting the troops. Rhett believes the war is a lost cause but is becoming rich as a blockade runner for profit. He sees through Scarlett&#x27;s &quot;lady in mourning&quot; disguise and recognizes her longing to dance with the other young people, so he bids a lot of gold to win the honor of leading the first dance and chooses her as his partner. Scarlett scandalizes everyone by dancing joyfully while still dressed in widow&#x27;s mourning. Her reputation is saved by Melanie, who is now her sister-in-law and highly respected in Atlanta; she argues that Scarlett is supporting the Confederate cause. Scarlett continues to act recklessly, flirting and dating while still in widow&#x27;s clothes, always protected by Melanie&#x27;s endorsement. She spends much of her time with Rhett, whose sexual attraction to Scarlett is ever-present. At one point, he enrages her with a silky proposition that she become his mistress. Still, she appreciates Rhett for his money, his sophistication, and their shared irritation with the hypocrisy of Atlanta society.

At Christmas (1863), Ashley is granted a furlough from the army and goes to Atlanta. Scarlett struggles to restrain her feelings for him. She remains convinced that he is secretly in love with her and is still married to Melanie out of duty. Scarlett is heartbroken when Melanie becomes pregnant with Ashley&#x27;s child.

===Part III===
The war is going badly for the Confederacy. By September 1864, Atlanta is besieged from three sides. The city becomes desperate as hundreds of wounded Confederate soldiers pour in. Melanie goes into labor with only the inexperienced Scarlett and a young enslaved woman called Prissy to assist, as all the trained doctors are attending to the soldiers. The tattered Confederate States Army sets flame to Atlanta before they abandon it to the Union Army. Amidst the chaos, Melanie gives birth to a boy, Beau.

Scarlett tracks down Rhett and begs him to take her, Wade, Melanie, Beau, and Prissy to Tara. Rhett laughs at this idea, explaining that the Yankees have likely burned Tara. Still, he steals an emaciated horse and a wagon and begins driving them out of Atlanta. At the city&#x27;s edge, Rhett has a change of heart and abandons Scarlett to join the army in their final, doomed push. Scarlett drives the wagon to Tara, which has avoided being burned like many of her neighbors&#x27; homes. However, the situation is bleak: Scarlett&#x27;s mother is dead, her father has lost his mind with grief, her sisters are sick with typhoid fever, the enslaved field workers have left, the Yankees have burned all the cotton, and there is no food.

A long struggle for survival begins, with Scarlett working in the fields. There are several hungry people and animals, along with an ever-present threat from Yankees who steal or burn what little they can find. At one point, Scarlett kills a Yankee soldier who attempts to invade her home and buries his body in the garden. A long post-war succession of Confederate soldiers returning home stop at Tara to find food and rest. Eventually, Ashley returns from the war with his idealistic view of the world shattered. Finding themselves alone one day, he and Scarlett share a kiss. Unable to trust himself with her nearby, Ashley says he will take his family and move away. Scarlett says she can not let them leave when they have nowhere to go and promises not to throw herself at him again.

===Part IV===
Life at Tara begins to recover, but exorbitant taxes are levied on the plantation. Scarlett knows only one man with enough money to help herRhett. She puts on her only pretty dress (made from the velvet curtains at Tara) and finds him in a jailhouse in Atlanta. He is being held on a murder charge and is likely to hang. Although she nearly wins him over with a southern belle routine, he declines to help after realizing her sweetness is an act meant to use his money. Leaving the jailhouse in a snit, Scarlett meets Frank Kennedy, a middle-aged storeowner betrothed to her sister, Suellen. Realizing that Frank also has money and that Suellen will turn her back on Tara once she is married, Scarlett hatches a plot to marry Frank. She lies to Frank that Suellen has changed her mind about marrying him. Dazed, Frank succumbs to Scarlett&#x27;s charms and marries her two weeks later. Wanting to keep his wife happy, Frank gives Scarlett the money to pay the taxes.

While Frank has a cold and is pampered by Aunt Pittypat, Scarlett reviews the accounts at Frank&#x27;s store and finds that many owe him money. Terrified of the possibility of more taxes and irritated with Frank&#x27;s poor business sense, she takes control of the store; her business practices emasculate Frank and leave many Atlantans resentful of her. With a loan from Rhett, she also buys and runs a small sawmill, which is viewed as even more scandalous conduct. To Frank&#x27;s relief and Scarlett&#x27;s dismay, she gets pregnant, which temporarily curtails her business activities. She convinces Ashley to come to Atlanta and manage her mill while still in love with him. At Melanie&#x27;s urging, Ashley reluctantly accepts. Melanie becomes the center of Atlanta society, and Scarlett gives birth to baby Ella Lorena.

Georgia is under martial law, and life has become more frightening. For protection, Scarlett keeps Frank&#x27;s pistol tucked in the upholstery of his buggy. Her lone trips to and from the mill take her past a shanty town where criminals live. While on her way home one evening, she is accosted by two men who try to rob her. However, she escapes with the help of Big Sam, a black former foreman from Tara. Attempting to avenge his wife, Frank and the Ku Klux Klan raid the shanty town, where Frank is shot dead in the fracas. Rhett puts on a charade to keep the raiders from being arrested. He enters the Wilkeses&#x27; home with Hugh Elsing and Ashley, singing and pretending to be drunk. Yankee officers outside question Rhett, who says he and the other men had been at Belle Watling&#x27;s brothel that evening, a story Belle later confirms to the officers. The men are indebted to Rhett, and his reputation among them improves. Meanwhile, the men&#x27;s wivesexcept Melanieare livid at owing their husbands&#x27; lives to the town madam. At Frank&#x27;s funeral, Rhett asks Scarlett to marry him. She refuses at first, but after a bit of repartee, he kisses her passionately, and in the heat of the moment, she accepts. One year later, Scarlett and Rhett announce their engagement, which becomes the talk of the town.

===Part V===

Mr. and Mrs. Butler honeymoon in New Orleans, spending lavishly. Returning to Atlanta, they build a gaudy mansion on Peachtree Street. Rhett happily pays for the house to be built to Scarlett&#x27;s specifications but describes it as an &quot;architectural horror.&quot; Shortly after moving into the house, the sardonic jabs between them become quarrels. Scarlett wonders why Rhett married her and then, &quot;with real hate in her eyes&quot;, tells Rhett she will have a baby, which she does not want. Wade is seven years old in 1869 when his half-sister Eugenie Victoria is born. She has blue eyes, and Melanie nicknames her &quot;Bonnie Blue&quot; in reference to the Bonnie Blue Flag of the Confederacy. After feeling well again, Scarlett makes a trip to the mill and talks to Ashley. In their conversation, she comes away believing Ashley still loves her and is jealous of Rhett. She returns home and tells Rhett she does not want more children. From then on, they sleep separately, and when Bonnie is two years old, she sleeps in a little bed beside Rhett. Rhett turns his attention entirely toward Bonnie, pampering her and working to ensure her a good reputation when she enters society.

Meanwhile, Melanie plans a surprise birthday party for Ashley. Scarlett goes to the mill to stall him until the celebration – a rare opportunity to be alone together. The two reminisce about the old days and how far their lives have departed from what they imagined for themselves. They share an innocent embrace but are spotted in the moment by Ashley&#x27;s sister, India. Before the party has even begun, a rumor of an affair between Ashley and Scarlett explodes across Atlanta, eventually reaching Rhett and Melanie. Melanie refuses to accept any criticism of Scarlett, and India is expelled from the Wilkes home. That night at home, Rhett, drunker than Scarlett has ever seen him and acting more violent than ever, encourages Scarlett to drink with him. However, she declines with deliberate rudeness. Rhett pins her to the wall and tells her they could have been happy together if she could have let go of Ashley. He then takes her in his arms and carries her to her bedroom, where they engage in intercourse. Several days later, a chagrined Rhett leaves town with Bonnie and Prissy for three months. Scarlett is uncertain about her feelings surrounding Rhett, for whom she feels a mixture of desire and revulsion. She then learns she is pregnant with her fourth child.

When Rhett returns, he comments on Scarlett&#x27;s paleness, and she reveals her pregnancy. Rhett sarcastically asks if the father is Ashley; Scarlett calls him a cad and says that no woman would want his baby, to which he replies, &quot;Cheer up, maybe you&#x27;ll have a miscarriage.&quot; She lunges at him but misses and tumbles down the stairs. She is seriously ill for the first time in her life, having lost the baby and broken her ribs. Rhett is remorseful and fears Scarlett will die. Sobbing and drunk, he seeks consolation from Melanie and confesses he acted out of jealousy. Scarlett goes to Tara with Wade and Ella to regain her strength and vitality. She returns healthy to Atlanta and sells the mills to Ashley. Bonnie is four years old in 1873, and Atlanta society is charmed by Rhett&#x27;s transformation into a doting father. Rhett buys Bonnie a Shetland pony, teaching her to ride sidesaddle and paying a trainer to teach the pony to jump. One day, Bonnie makes her father raise the bar to one-and-a-half feet. During the jump, she falls and dies of a broken neck.

In the months following Bonnie&#x27;s death, Rhett is often drunk and disheveled, while Scarlett, though equally bereaved, is more presentable. Melanie conceives a second child but loses the baby and soon dies due to complications. As she comforts the widowed Ashley, Scarlett realizes she stopped loving him long ago and perhaps never did. She is shocked to realize that she has always loved Rhett, and he has loved her in return. She returns home, brimming with her new love and determined to begin anew with him. She discovers him sitting in the library. In the wake of Melanie&#x27;s death, Rhett has decided he wants to rediscover the calm Southern dignity he once knew in his youth and is leaving Atlanta to find it. Scarlett tries to persuade Rhett to either stay or take her with him, but he explains that while he once loved Scarlett, the years of hurt and neglect have killed that love. He says he may &quot;come back often enough to keep gossip down&quot; (since they have decided not to get a divorce), but in reply to Scarlett&#x27;s plea of &quot;What shall I do?&quot; he replies, &quot;My dear, I don&#x27;t give a damn.&quot;, and walks out the front door. Amid her grief, Scarlett consoles herself with the knowledge that she still has Tara. She plans to return there with the certainty that she can recover and win Rhett back because &quot;tomorrow is another day.&quot;

At the end of the novel, Rhett confesses to Scarlett, &quot;I loved you but I couldn&#x27;t let you know it.

==Biographical background and publication==
Born in 1900 in Atlanta, Margaret (Peggy) Mitchell was a Southerner and writer throughout her life. She grew up hearing stories about the American Civil War and the Reconstruction from her Irish-American grandmother, Annie Fitzgerald Stephens, who had endured its suffering while living on the family plantation, Rural Home. Her forceful and intellectual mother, Maybelle Stephens Mitchell, was a suffragist who fought for the rights of women to vote.

As a young woman, Mitchell found love with an army lieutenant. He was killed in World War I, and she would carry his memory for the remainder of her life. After studying at Smith College for a year, during which time her mother died from the 1918 pandemic flu, Mitchell returned to Atlanta. She married, but her husband was an abusive bootlegger. She took a job writing feature articles for the &quot;Atlanta Journal&quot; at a time when Atlanta debutantes of her class did not work. After divorcing her first husband, she married again to a man who shared her interest in writing and literature, John Marsh. He had been the best man at her first wedding.

Margaret Mitchell began writing &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; in 1926 to pass the time while recovering from a slow-healing injury from an auto crash. In April 1935, Harold Latham of Macmillan, an editor looking for new fiction, read her manuscript and saw that it could be a best-seller. After Latham agreed to publish the book, Mitchell worked for another six months checking the historical references and rewriting the opening chapter several times. Mitchell and her husband, John Marsh, a copy editor by trade, edited the final version of the novel. Mitchell wrote the book&#x27;s final moments first and then wrote the events that led to them. &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; was published in June 1936.

==Title==

The author tentatively titled the novel &quot;Tomorrow Is Another Day&quot;, from its last line. Other proposed titles included &quot;Bugles Sang True&quot;, &quot;Not in Our Stars&quot;, and &quot;Tote the Weary Load&quot;. The title Mitchell finally chose is from the first line of the third stanza of the poem &quot;Non Sum Qualis Eram Bonae sub Regno Cynarae&quot; by Ernest Dowson:

Scarlett O&#x27;Hara uses the title phrase when she wonders if her home on a plantation called &quot;Tara&quot; is still standing or if it had &quot;gone with the wind which had swept through Georgia&quot;. In a general sense, the title is a metaphor for the demise of a way of life in the South before the Civil War. When taken in the context of Dowson&#x27;s poem about &quot;Cynara&quot;, the phrase &quot;gone with the wind&quot; alludes to erotic loss. The poem expresses the regrets of someone who has lost his feelings for his &quot;old passion&quot;, Cynara. Dowson&#x27;s Cynara, a name that comes from the Greek word for artichoke, represents a lost love.

It is also possible that the author was influenced by the connection of the phrase &quot;Gone with the wind&quot; with Tara in a line of James Joyce’s &quot;Ulysses&quot; in the chapter &quot;Aeolus&quot;.

==Structure==

===Coming-of-age story===
Margaret Mitchell arranged &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; chronologically, focusing on the life and experiences of the main character, Scarlett O&#x27;Hara, as she grew from adolescence into adulthood. During the novel&#x27;s period, from 1861 to 1873, Scarlett&#x27;s ages ranged from sixteen to twenty-eight. This is a type of &quot;Bildungsroman&quot;, a novel concerned with the moral and psychological growth of the protagonist from youth to adulthood (coming-of-age story). Scarlett&#x27;s development is affected by the events of her time. Mitchell used a smooth linear narrative structure. The novel is known for its exceptional &quot;readability&quot;. The plot is rich with vivid characters.

===Genre===
&quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; is often placed in the literary subgenre of the historical romance novel. Pamela Regis has argued that it is more appropriately classified as a historical novel, as it does not contain all of the elements of the romance genre. The novel has been described as an early classic of the erotic historical genre because it is thought to contain some degree of pornography.

==Plot elements==

===Slavery===

Slavery in &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; is a backdrop to a story that is essentially about other things. Southern plantation fiction (also known as Anti-Tom literature, in reference to reactions to Harriet Beecher Stowe&#x27;s anti-slavery novel, &quot;Uncle Tom&#x27;s Cabin&quot; of 1852) from the mid-19th century, culminating in &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;, is written from the perspective and values of an enslaver and tends to present slaves as docile and happy.

====Caste system====

The characters in the novel are organized into two basic groups along class lines: the white planter class, such as Scarlett and Ashley, and the black house servant class. The enslaved people depicted in &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; are primarily loyal house servants, such as Mammy, Pork, Prissy, and Uncle Peter. House servants are the highest &quot;caste&quot; of enslaved people in Mitchell&#x27;s caste system. They choose to stay with their masters after the Emancipation Proclamation of 1863 and subsequent Thirteenth Amendment of 1865 sets them free. Scarlett thinks of the servants who stayed at Tara, &quot;There were qualities of loyalty and tirelessness and love in them that no strain could break, no money could buy.&quot;

The enslaved field workers make up the lower class in Mitchell&#x27;s caste system. The enslaved field workers from the Tara plantation and the foreman, Big Sam, are taken away by Confederate soldiers to dig ditches and never return to the plantation. Mitchell wrote that other enslaved field workers were &quot;loyal&quot; and &quot;refused to avail themselves of the new freedom&quot;, but the novel has no enslaved field workers who stay on the plantation to work after emancipation.

American William Wells Brown escaped from slavery and published his memoir, or slave narrative, in 1847. He wrote of the disparity in conditions between the house servant and the field hand:

During the time that Mr. Cook was overseer, I was a house servanta situation preferable to a field hand, as I was better fed, better clothed, and not obliged to rise at the ringing bell, but about a half-hour after. I have often laid and heard the crack of the whip, and the screams of the slave.

====Faithful and devoted slave====
Although the novel is more than 1,000 pages long, the character of Mammy never considers what her life might be like away from Tara. She recognizes her freedom to come and go as she pleases, saying, &quot;Ah is free, Miss Scarlett. You kain sen&#x27; me nowhar Ah doan wanter go&quot;, but Mammy remains duty-bound to &quot;Miss Ellen&#x27;s chile&quot;. (No other name for Mammy is given in the novel.)

Eighteen years before the publication of &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;, an article titled &quot;The Old Black Mammy&quot;, written in the &quot;Confederate Veteran&quot; in 1918, discussed the romanticized view of the mammy character persisting in Southern literature:

for her faithfulness and devotion, she has been immortalized in the literature of the South; so the memory of her will never pass, but live on in the tales that are told of those &quot;dear dead days beyond recall&quot;.

Micki McElya, in her book &quot;Clinging to Mammy&quot;, suggests the myth of the faithful enslaved person, in the figure of Mammy, lingered because white Americans wished to live in a world in which African Americans were not angry over the injustice of slavery.

The best-selling anti-slavery novel, &quot;Uncle Tom&#x27;s Cabin&quot; by Harriet Beecher Stowe, published in 1852, is mentioned briefly in &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; as being accepted by the Yankees as &quot;revelation second only to the Bible&quot;. The enduring interest of both &quot;Uncle Tom&#x27;s Cabin&quot; and &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; has resulted in lingering stereotypes of 19th-century enslaved Black people. &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; has become a reference point for subsequent writers about the South, both black and white alike.

===Southern belle===
The southern belle is an archetype for a young woman of the antebellum American South upper class. The southern belle was considered physically attractive but, more importantly, personally charming with sophisticated social skills. She is subject to the correct code of female behavior. The novel&#x27;s heroine, Scarlett O&#x27;Hara, charming though not beautiful, is a classic southern belle.

For young Scarlett, her mother, Ellen O&#x27;Hara, represents the ideal southern belle. In &quot;A Study in Scarlett&quot;, published in &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, Claudia Roth Pierpont wrote:

The Southern belle was bred to conform to a subspecies of the nineteenth-century &quot;lady&quot; ... For Scarlett, the ideal is embodied in her adored mother, the saintly Ellen, whose back is never seen to rest against the back of any chair on which she sits, whose broken spirit everywhere is mistaken for righteous calm

However, Scarlett is not always willing to conform. Kathryn Lee Seidel, in her book, &quot;The Southern Belle in the American Novel&quot;, wrote:

part of her does try to rebel against the restraints of a code of behavior that relentlessly attempts to mold her into a form to which she is not naturally suited.

Scarlett, the figure of a pampered southern belle, lives through an extreme reversal of fortune and wealth and survives to rebuild Tara and her self-esteem. Her bad belle traits (Scarlett&#x27;s deceitfulness, shrewdness, manipulation, and superficiality), in contrast to Melanie&#x27;s good belle traits (trust, self-sacrifice, and loyalty), enable her to survive in the post-war South and pursue her main interest, which is to make enough money to survive and prosper. Although Scarlett was &quot;born&quot; around 1845, she is portrayed to appeal to modern-day readers for her passionate and independent spirit, determination, and obstinate refusal to feel defeated.

====Historical background====

Marriage was supposed to be the goal of all southern belles, as that of their husbands largely determined women&#x27;s status. All social and educational pursuits were directed towards it. Despite the Civil War and the loss of a generation of eligible men, young ladies were still expected to marry. By law and Southern social convention, household heads were adult, white propertied males, and all white women and all African Americans were thought to require protection and guidance because they lacked the capacity for reason and self-control.

The Atlanta Historical Society has produced many &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; exhibits, among them a 1994 exhibit titled &quot;Disputed Territories: &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; and Southern Myths&quot;. The exhibit asked, &quot;Was Scarlett a Lady?&quot;, finding that historically most women of the period were not involved in business activities as Scarlett was during Reconstruction when she ran a sawmill. White women performed traditional jobs such as teaching and sewing and generally disliked work outside the home.

During the Civil War, Southern women played a significant role as volunteer nurses in makeshift hospitals. Many were middle- and upper-class women who had never worked for wages or seen the inside of a hospital. One such nurse was Ada W. Bacot, a young widow who had lost two children. Bacot came from a wealthy South Carolina plantation family that enslaved 87 people.

In the fall of 1862, Confederate laws were changed to permit women to be employed in hospitals as members of the Confederate Medical Department. Twenty-seven-year-old nurse Kate Cumming from Mobile, Alabama, described the primitive hospital conditions in her journal:

They are in the hall, on the gallery, and crowded into very small rooms. The foul air from this mass of human beings at first made me giddy and sick, but I soon got over it. We have to walk, and when we give the men any thing kneel, in blood and water; but we think nothing of it at all.

===Battles===

The Civil War ended on April 26, 1865, when Joseph E. Johnston surrendered his armies in the Carolinas campaign to U.S. Army General William Tecumseh Sherman. Several battles are mentioned or depicted in Gone with the Wind.

====Early and mid war years====

* Seven Days Battles, June 25 – July 1, 1862, Richmond, Virginia, a Confederate victory.
* Battle of Fredericksburg, December 11–15, 1862, Fredericksburg, Virginia, a Confederate victory.
* Streight&#x27;s Raid, April 19 – May 3, 1863, in northern Alabama. U.S. Army Colonel Abel Streight and his men were captured by Confederate General Nathan Bedford Forrest.
* Battle of Chancellorsville, April 30 – May 6, 1863, in Spotsylvania County, Virginia, near the village of Chancellorsville, Virginia, a Confederate victory.
:Ashley Wilkes is stationed on the Rapidan River, Virginia, in the winter of 1863, later captured and sent to a U.S. Army prisoner-of-war camp, Rock Island Arsenal.
* Siege of Vicksburg, May 18 – July 4, 1863, Vicksburg, Mississippi, a Union victory.
* Battle of Gettysburg, July 1–3, 1863, fought in and around Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, a Union victory. &quot;They expected death. They did not expect defeat.&quot;
* Battle of Chickamauga, September 19–20, 1863, northwestern Georgia. The first fighting in Georgia and the most significant Union defeat.
* Chattanooga Campaign, November–December 1863, Tennessee, a Union victory. The city became the supply and logistics base for Sherman&#x27;s 1864 Atlanta Campaign.

====Atlanta Campaign====

The Atlanta Campaign (May–September 1864) took place in northwest Georgia and the area around Atlanta.

Confederate General Johnston fights and retreats from Dalton (May 7–13) to Resaca (May 13–15) to Kennesaw Mountain (June 27). Union General Sherman suffers heavy losses to the entrenched Confederate army. Unable to pass through Kennesaw, Sherman swings his men around to the Chattahoochee River, where the Confederate army is waiting on the opposite side of the river. Once again, General Sherman flanks the Confederate army, forcing Johnston to retreat to Peachtree Creek (July 20), five miles northeast of Atlanta.

* Battle of Atlanta, July 22, 1864, just southeast of Atlanta. The city would not fall until September 2, 1864—heavy losses for Confederate John Bell Hood.
* Battle of Ezra Church, July 28, 1864, Sherman&#x27;s failed attack west of Atlanta where the railroad entered the city.
* Battle of Utoy Creek, August 5–7, 1864, Sherman&#x27;s failed attempt to break the railroad line at East Point, into Atlanta from the west, heavy Union losses.
* Battle of Jonesborough, August 31 – September 1, 1864, Sherman successfully cut the railroad lines from the south into Atlanta. The city of Atlanta was abandoned by General Hood and then occupied by Union troops for the rest of the war.

====March to the Sea====

Sherman&#x27;s March to the Sea was conducted in Georgia during November and December 1864.

====President Lincoln&#x27;s murder====

Although Abraham Lincoln is mentioned in the novel 14 times, no reference is made to his assassination on April 14, 1865.

===Manhood===
Ashley Wilkes is the beau ideal of Southern manhood in Scarlett&#x27;s eyes. A planter by inheritance, Ashley knew the Confederate cause had died. However, Ashley&#x27;s name signifies paleness. His &quot;pallid skin literalizes the idea of Confederate death&quot;.

Ashley contemplates leaving Georgia for New York City. Had he gone North, he would have joined numerous other ex-Confederate transplants there. Ashley, embittered by war, tells Scarlett he has been &quot;in a state of suspended animation&quot; since the surrender. He feels he is not &quot;shouldering a man&#x27;s burden&quot; at Tara and believes he is &quot;much less than a manmuch less, indeed, than a woman&quot;.

A &quot;young girl&#x27;s dream of the Perfect Knight&quot;, Ashley is like a young girl himself. With his &quot;poet&#x27;s eye&quot;, Ashley has a &quot;feminine sensitivity&quot;. Scarlett is angered by the &quot;slur of effeminacy flung at Ashley&quot; when her father tells her the Wilkes family was &quot;born queer&quot;. (Mitchell&#x27;s use of the word &quot;queer&quot; is for its sexual connotation because queer, in the 1930s, was associated with homosexuality.) Ashley&#x27;s effeminacy is associated with his appearance, his lack of forcefulness, and sexual impotence. He rides, plays poker, and drinks like &quot;proper men&quot;, but his heart is not in it, Gerald claims. The embodiment of castration, Ashley wears the head of Medusa on his cravat pin.

Scarlett&#x27;s love interest, Ashley Wilkes, lacks manliness, and her husbandsthe &quot;calf-like&quot; Charles Hamilton, and the &quot;old-maid in britches&quot;, Frank Kennedyare unmanly as well. Mitchell is critiquing masculinity in southern society since Reconstruction. Even Rhett Butler, the well-groomed dandy, is effeminate or &quot;gay-coded&quot;. Charles, Frank, and Ashley represent the impotence of the post-war white South. Its power and influence have been diminished.

===Scallawag===
The word &quot;scallawag&quot; is defined as a loafer, a vagabond, or a rogue. Scallawag had a special meaning after the Civil War as an epithet for a white Southerner who accepted and supported Republican reforms. Mitchell defines scallawags as &quot;Southerners who had turned Republican very profitably.&quot; Rhett Butler is accused of being a &quot;damned Scallawag&quot;. In addition to scallawags, Mitchell portrays other types of scoundrels in the novel: Yankees, carpetbaggers, Republicans, prostitutes, and overseers. In the early years of the Civil War, Rhett is called a &quot;scoundrel&quot; for his &quot;selfish gains&quot; profiteering as a blockade-runner.

As a scallawag, Rhett is despised. He is the &quot;dark, mysterious, and slightly malevolent hero loose in the world&quot;. Literary scholars have identified elements of Mitchell&#x27;s first husband, Berrien &quot;Red&quot; Upshaw, in the character of Rhett. Another sees the image of Italian actor Rudolph Valentino, whom Margaret Mitchell interviewed as a young reporter for &quot;The Atlanta Journal&quot;. Fictional hero Rhett Butler has a &quot;swarthy face, flashing teeth and dark alert eyes&quot;. He is a &quot;scamp, blackguard, without scruple or honor&quot;.

==Themes==

===Survival===

If &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; has a theme it is that of survival. What makes some people come through catastrophes and others, apparently just as able, strong, and brave, go under? It happens in every upheaval. Some people survive; others don&#x27;t. What qualities are in those who fight their way through triumphantly that are lacking in those that go under? I only know that survivors used to call that quality &quot;gumption.&quot; So I wrote about people who had gumption and people who didn&#x27;t.
— Margaret Mitchell, 1936

==Critical reception==

===Reviews===
The sales of Margaret Mitchell&#x27;s novel in the summer of 1936, as the nation was recovering from the Great Depression and at the virtually unprecedented price of three dollars, reached about 1 million by the end of December. The book was a bestseller when reviews began appearing in national magazines. Herschel Brickell, a critic for the &quot;New York Evening Post&quot;, lauded Mitchell for the way she &quot;tosses out the window all the thousands of technical tricks our novelists have been playing with for the past twenty years.&quot;

Ralph Thompson, a book reviewer for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, was critical of the length of the novel and wrote in June 1936:I happen to feel that the book would have been infinitely better had it been edited down to say, 500 pages, but there speaks the harassed daily reviewer as well as the would-be judicious critic. Very nearly every reader will agree, no doubt, that a more disciplined and less prodigal piece of work would have more nearly done justice to the subject-matter.Some reviewers compared the book to William Thackeray&#x27;s &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; and Leo Tolstoy&#x27;s &quot;War and Peace&quot;. Mitchell claimed Charles Dickens as an inspiration and called &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; a &quot;&#x27;Victorian&#x27; type novel.&quot;

Helen Keller read the 12-volume Braille edition. The book brought her fond memories of her Southern infancy, but she also felt sadness compared to what she knew about the South. Keller&#x27;s father had enslaved people and fought as a Confederate captain, but Helen would later support the NAACP and the ACLU.

===Scholarship: Racial, ethnicity and social issues===
&quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; has been criticized for its stereotypical and derogatory portrayal of African Americans in the 19th century South. Former field hands during the early days of Reconstruction are described as behaving &quot;as creatures of small intelligence might naturally be expected to do. Like monkeys or small children turned loose among treasured objects whose value is beyond their comprehension, they ran wildeither from perverse pleasure in destruction or simply because of their ignorance.&quot;

Commenting on this passage of the novel, Jabari Asim, author of &quot;The N Word: Who Can Say It, Who Shouldn&#x27;t, and Why&quot;, says it is &quot;one of the more charitable passages in &quot;Gone With the Wind&quot;, Margaret Mitchell hesitated to blame black &#x27;insolence&#x27; during Reconstruction solely on &#x27;mean niggers&#x27;, of which, she said, there were few even in slavery days.&quot;

Critics say that Mitchell downplayed the violent role of the Ku Klux Klan and their abuse of freedmen. Author Pat Conroy, in his preface to a later edition of the novel, describes Mitchell&#x27;s portrayal of the Ku Klux Klan as having &quot;the same romanticized role it had in &quot;The Birth of a Nation&quot; and appears to be a benign combination of the Elks Club and a men&#x27;s equestrian society&quot;.

Regarding the historical inaccuracies of the novel, historian Richard N. Current points out:

No doubt it is indeed unfortunate that &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; perpetuates many myths about Reconstruction, particularly with respect to blacks. Margaret Mitchell did not originate them and a young novelist can scarcely be faulted for not knowing what the majority of mature, professional historians did not know until many years later.

In &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;, Mitchell explores some complexities in racial issues. A Yankee woman asked Scarlett for advice on whom to appoint as a nurse for her children; Scarlett suggested a &quot;darky&quot;, much to the disgust of the Yankee woman who was seeking an Irish maid, a &quot;Bridget&quot;. African Americans and Irish Americans are treated &quot;in precisely the same way&quot; in &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;, writes David O&#x27;Connell in his 1996 book, &quot;The Irish Roots of Margaret Mitchell&#x27;s Gone With the Wind&quot;. Ethnic slurs on the Irish and Irish stereotypes pervade the novel, O&#x27;Connell claims, and Scarlett is not an exception to the terminology. Irish scholar Geraldine Higgins notes that Jonas Wilkerson labels Scarlett: &quot;you highflying, bogtrotting Irish&quot;. Higgins says that, as the Irish American O&#x27;Haras were enslavers and held African Americans in bondage, the two ethnic groups are not equivalent in the ethnic hierarchy of the novel.

The novel has been criticized for promoting plantation values and romanticizing the white supremacy of the antebellum South. Mitchell biographer Marianne Walker, author of &quot;Margaret Mitchell and John Marsh: The Love Story Behind Gone with the Wind&quot;, believes those who attack the book on these grounds have not read it. She said that the popular 1939 film &quot;promotes a false notion of the Old South&quot;. Mitchell was not involved in the screenplay or film production.

James Loewen, author of &quot;Lies My Teacher Told Me: Everything Your American History Textbook Got Wrong&quot;, says this novel is &quot;profoundly racist and profoundly wrong&quot;. In 1984, an alderman in Waukegan, Illinois, challenged the book&#x27;s inclusion on the reading list of the Waukegan School District on the grounds of &quot;racism&quot; and &quot;unacceptable language&quot;. He objected to the frequent use of the racial slur &quot;nigger&quot;. He also objected to several other books: &quot;The Nigger of the &#x27;Narcissus&#x27;&quot;, &quot;Uncle Tom&#x27;s Cabin&quot;, and &quot;Adventures of Huckleberry Finn&quot; for the same reason.

Mitchell&#x27;s use of color in the novel is symbolic and open to interpretation. Red, green, and a variety of hues of each of these colors are the predominant palette of colors related to Scarlett.

The novel came under intense criticism for alleged racist and white supremacist themes in 2020 following the murder of George Floyd, and the ensuing protests and focus on systemic racism in the United States.

===Awards and recognition===

In 1937, Margaret Mitchell received the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction for &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; and the second annual National Book Award for Fiction from the American Booksellers Association. It is ranked as the second favorite book by American readers, just behind the Bible, according to a 2008 Harris poll. The poll found the novel has the strongest following among women, those aged 44 or more, both Southerners and Midwesterners, both whites and Hispanics, and those who have not attended college. In a 2014 Harris poll, Mitchell&#x27;s novel ranked again as second, after the Bible. The novel is on the list of best-selling books. As of 2010, over 30 million copies have been printed in the United States and abroad. More than 24 editions of &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; have been issued in China. &quot;Time&quot; magazine critics Lev Grossman and Richard Lacayo included the novel on their list of the 100 best English-language novels published between 1923 and 2005. In 2003, the book was listed at number 21 on the BBC&#x27;s The Big Read poll of the UK&#x27;s &quot;best-loved novel&quot;.

=== Censorship ===
&quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; frequently has been the center of controversy.

In 1978, the book was banned from English classrooms in the Anaheim Union High School District in Anaheim, California. 

In 1984, the book was challenged in the Waukegan, Illinois, School District due to the novel&#x27;s use of the word &quot;nigger&quot;.

==Adaptations==
&quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; has been adapted several times for stage and screen:

* The novel was the basis of the classic Academy Award-winning 1939 film of the same name. The film has been considered one of the greatest Hollywood movies ever made, and upon release, was immensely popular in its own right. It was produced by David O. Selznick and stars Clark Gable, Vivien Leigh and Olivia de Havilland.
* The book was adapted into a musical, &quot;Scarlett&quot;, which opened in Tokyo in 1970 (in 1966 it was produced as a nine-hour play without music), and in London in 1972, where it was reduced to four hours. The London production opened in 1973 in Los Angeles and again in Dallas in 1976.
* The Japanese Takarazuka Revue produced a musical adaptation of the novel, &quot;Kaze to Tomo ni Sarinu&quot;, which was performed by the all-female Moon Troupe in 1977. The most recent performance was in January 2014 by the Moon Troupe, with Todoroki Yuu as Rhett Butler and Ryu Masaki as Scarlett O&#x27;Hara.
* A 2003 French musical adaptation was produced by Gérard Presgurvic, &quot;Autant en emporte le vent&quot;.
* The book was adapted into a British musical, &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;, and opened in 2008 in the U.K. at the New London Theatre in the West End.
* A full-length three-act classical ballet version, with a score arranged from the works of Antonín Dvořák and choreographed by Lilla Pártay, premiered in 2007 as performed by the Hungarian National Ballet. It was revived in their 2013 season.
* A new stage adaptation by Niki Landau premiered at the Manitoba Theatre Centre in Winnipeg, Canada in January 2013.

==In popular culture==

&quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; has appeared in many places and forms in popular culture:

===Books, television and more===
* A 1945 cartoon by World War II cartoonist Bill Mauldin shows an American soldier lying on the ground with Margaret Mitchell&#x27;s bullet-riddled book. The caption reads: &quot;Dear, Dear Miss Mitchell, You will probably think this is an awful funny letter to get from a soldier, but I was carrying your big book, &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;, under my shirt and a  ...&quot;
* The novelist Vladimir Nabokov considered &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; to be a &quot;cheap novel&quot;, and in his &quot;Bend Sinister&quot; a book meant to resemble it is used as toilet paper.
* In the season 3 episode of &quot;I Love Lucy&quot;, &quot;Lucy Writes a Novel&quot;, which aired on April 5, 1954, &quot;Lucy&quot; (Lucille Ball) reads about a housewife who makes a fortune writing a novel in her spare time. Lucy writes a novel, which she titles &quot;Real Gone with the Wind&quot;.
* &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; is the book that S. E. Hinton&#x27;s runaway teenage characters, Ponyboy and Johnny, read while hiding from the law in the young adult novel &quot;The Outsiders&quot; (1967).
* A film parody titled &quot;Went with the Wind!&quot; aired in a 1976 episode of &quot;The Carol Burnett Show&quot;. Burnett as Starlett descends a long staircase wearing a green curtain complete with hanging rod. The outfit, designed by Bob Mackie, is displayed at the Smithsonian Institution.
* &quot;Mad&quot; magazine created a parody of the novel &quot;Groan with the Wind&quot; (1991), in which Ashley was renamed Ashtray and Rhett became Rhetch. It ends with Rhetch and Ashtray running off together.
* A pictorial parody in which the enslaved people are white and the protagonists are black appeared in a 1995 issue of &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; titled &quot;Scarlett &#x27;n the Hood&quot;.
* In a &quot;MADtv&quot; comedy sketch (2007), &quot;Slave Girl #8&quot; introduces three alternative endings to the film. In one ending, Scarlett pursues Rhett wearing a jet pack.
===Collectibles===
On June 30, 1986, the 50th anniversary of the day &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; went on sale, the U.S. Post Office issued a 1-cent stamp showing an image of Margaret Mitchell. The stamp was designed by Ronald Adair and was part of the U.S. Postal Service&#x27;s Great Americans series.

On September 10, 1998, the U.S. Post Office issued a 32-cent stamp as part of its Celebrate the Century series, recalling various important events in the 20th century. The stamp, designed by Howard Paine, displays the book with its original dust jacket, a white Magnolia blossom, and a hilt placed against a background of green velvet.

To commemorate the 75th anniversary (2011) of the publication of &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; in 1936, Scribner published a paperback edition featuring the book&#x27;s original jacket art.

===The Windies===
The Windies are ardent &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; fans who follow all the latest news and events surrounding the book and film. They gather periodically in costumes from the film or dressed as Margaret Mitchell. Atlanta, Georgia, is their meeting place.

==Legacy==
One story of the legacy of &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; is the persistence in the people&#x27;s minds of its representation of the history of the Old South and how the American Civil War and Reconstruction changed it. The film adaptation of the novel &quot;amplified this effect&quot;. The plantation legend was &quot;burned&quot; into the mind of the public. Moreover, her fictional account of the war and its aftermath has influenced how the world has viewed the city of Atlanta for successive generations.

Some readers of the novel have seen the film first and read the novel afterward. One difference between the film and the novel is the staircase scene, in which Rhett carries Scarlett up the stairs. In the film, Scarlett weakly struggles and does not scream as Rhett starts up the stairs. In the novel, &quot;he hurt her and she cried out, muffled, frightened.&quot;

Earlier in the novel, in an intended rape at Shantytown (Chapter 44), Scarlett is attacked by a black man who rips open her dress while a white man grabs hold of the horse&#x27;s bridle. She is rescued by another black man, Big Sam. In the film, she is attacked by a white man while a black man grabs the horse&#x27;s bridle.

The Library of Congress began a multiyear &quot;Celebration of the Book&quot; in July 2012 with an exhibition on &quot;Books That Shaped America&quot; and an initial list of 88 books by American authors that have influenced American lives. &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; was included in the Library&#x27;s list. Librarian of Congress, James H. Billington said:

This list is a starting point. It is not a register of the &#x27;best&#x27; American books – although many of them fit that description. Rather, the list is intended to spark a national conversation on books written by Americans that have influenced our lives, whether they appear on this initial list or not. 

Among books on the list considered to be the Great American Novel were &quot;Moby-Dick&quot;, &quot;Adventures of Huckleberry Finn&quot;, &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot;, &quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot;, &quot;The Catcher in the Rye&quot;, &quot;Invisible Man&quot;, and &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot;.

The novel appeals worldwide due to its universal themes: war, love, death, racial conflict, class, gender, and generation, which speak especially to women. In North Korea, readers relate to the novel&#x27;s theme of survival, finding it to be &quot;the most compelling message of the novel&quot;. Margaret Mitchell&#x27;s personal collection of nearly 70 foreign language translations of her novel was given to the Atlanta Public Library after her death.

On August 16, 2012, the Archdiocese of Atlanta announced that it had been bequeathed a 50% stake in the trademarks and literary rights to &quot;Gone With the Wind&quot; from the estate of Margaret Mitchell&#x27;s deceased nephew, Joseph Mitchell. Margaret Mitchell had separated from the Catholic Church. However, one of Mitchell&#x27;s biographers, Darden Asbury Pyron, stated that Margaret Mitchell had &quot;an intense relationship&quot; with her mother, who was a Roman Catholic.

== Publication history ==

===Original manuscript===
Although some of Mitchell&#x27;s papers and documents related to the writing of &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; were burned after her death, many documents, including assorted draft chapters, were preserved. The last four chapters of the novel are held by the Pequot Library of Southport, Connecticut.

===Publication and reprintings (1936 – US)===
The first printing of 10,000 copies contains the original publication date: &quot;Published May, 1936&quot;. After the book was chosen as the Book-of-the-Month Club&#x27;s selection for July, the publication was delayed until June 30. The second printing of 25,000 copies (and subsequent printings) contains the release date: &quot;Published June, 1936&quot;. The third printing of 15,000 copies was made in June 1936. Additionally, 50,000 copies were printed for the Book-of-the-Month Club July selection. &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; was officially released to the American public on June 30, 1936.

===Sequels and prequels===

Although Mitchell refused to write a sequel to &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;, Mitchell&#x27;s estate authorized Alexandra Ripley to write a sequel, which was titled &quot;Scarlett&quot;. The book was subsequently adapted into a television mini-series in 1994. A second sequel was authorized by Mitchell&#x27;s estate titled &quot;Rhett Butler&#x27;s People&quot;, by Donald McCaig. The novel parallels &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; from Rhett Butler&#x27;s perspective. In 2010, Mitchell&#x27;s estate authorized McCaig to write a prequel, which follows the life of the house servant Mammy, whom McCaig names &quot;Ruth&quot;. The novel, &quot;Ruth&#x27;s Journey&quot;, was released in 2014.

The copyright holders of &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; attempted to suppress publication of &quot;The Wind Done Gone&quot; by Alice Randall, which retold the story from the perspective of the enslaved people. A federal appeals court denied the plaintiffs an injunction (&quot;Suntrust v. Houghton Mifflin&quot;) against publication on the basis that the book was a parody and therefore protected by the First Amendment. The parties subsequently settled out of court, and the book became a &quot;New York Times&quot; Best Seller.

A book sequel unauthorized by the copyright holders, &quot;The Winds of Tara&quot; by Katherine Pinotti, was blocked from publication in the United States. The novel was republished in Australia, avoiding U.S. copyright restrictions.

Away from copyright lawsuits, Internet fan fiction has proved to be a fertile medium for sequels (some of them book-length), parodies, and rewritings of &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;.

Numerous unauthorized sequels to &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; have been published in Russia, mostly under the pseudonym Yuliya Hilpatrik, a cover for a consortium of writers. &quot;The New York Times&quot; states that most have a &quot;Slavic&quot; flavor.

Several sequels were written in Hungarian under the pseudonym Audrey D. Milland or Audrey Dee Milland by at least four different authors (who are named in the colophon as translators to make the book seem a translation from the English original, a procedure common in the 1990s but prohibited by law since then). The first picks up where Ripley&#x27;s &quot;Scarlett&quot; ended; the next is about Scarlett&#x27;s daughter Cat. Other books include a prequel trilogy about Scarlett&#x27;s grandmother, Solange, and a three-part miniseries about a supposed illegitimate daughter of Carreen.

=== Copyright status ===

<text>George Washington Carver ( 1864 – January 5, 1943) was an American agricultural scientist and inventor who promoted alternative crops to cotton and methods to prevent soil depletion. He was one of the most prominent black scientists of the early 20th century.

While a professor at Tuskegee Institute, Carver developed techniques to improve types of soils depleted by repeated plantings of cotton. He wanted poor farmers to grow other crops, such as peanuts and sweet potatoes, as a source of their own food and to improve their quality of life. Under his leadership, the Experiment Station at Tuskegee published over forty practical bulletins for farmers, many written by him, which included recipes; many of the bulletins contained advice for poor farmers, including combating soil depletion with limited financial means, producing bigger crops, and preserving food.

Apart from his work to improve the lives of farmers, Carver was also a leader in promoting environmentalism. He received numerous honors for his work, including the Spingarn Medal of the NAACP. In an era of high racial polarization, his fame reached beyond the black community. He was widely recognized and praised in the white community for his many achievements and talents. In 1941, &quot;Time&quot; magazine dubbed Carver a &quot;Black Leonardo&quot;.

==Early years==

Carver was born into slavery, in Diamond Grove, (now Diamond, Newton County, Missouri), near Crystal Palace, sometime in the early 1860s. The date of his birth is uncertain and was not known to Carver because it was before slavery was abolished in Missouri, which occurred in January 1865, during the American Civil War. His enslaver, Moses Carver, descended from a family of immigrants of German or English descent, had purchased George&#x27;s parents, Mary and Giles, from William P. McGinnis on October 9, 1855, for $700 (~$ in ).

Giles died before George was born and when he was a week old, he, his sister, and his mother were kidnapped by night raiders from Arkansas. George&#x27;s brother, James, was rushed to safety from the kidnappers. The kidnappers sold the trio in Kentucky. Moses Carver hired John Bentley to find them, but he found only the infant George. Moses negotiated with the raiders to gain the boy&#x27;s return and rewarded Bentley. After slavery was abolished, Moses Carver and his wife, Susan, raised George and his older brother, James, as their own children. They encouraged George to continue his intellectual pursuits, and &quot;Aunt Susan&quot; taught him the basics of reading and writing.

Black people were not allowed at the public school in Diamond Grove. George decided to go to a school for black children 10 miles (16 km) south, in Neosho. When he reached the town, he found the school closed for the night. He slept in a nearby barn. By his own account, the next morning he met a kind woman, Mariah Watkins, from whom he wished to rent a room. When he identified himself as &quot;Carver&#x27;s George&quot;, as he had done his whole life, she replied that from now on his name was &quot;George Carver&quot;. George liked Mariah Watkins and her words, &quot;You must learn all you can, then go back out into the world and give your learning back to the people&quot;, made a great impression on him.

At age 13, because he wanted to attend the academy there, he moved to the home of another foster family, in Fort Scott, Kansas. After witnessing the killing of a black man by a group of white people, Carver left the city. He attended a series of schools before earning his diploma at Minneapolis High School in Minneapolis, Kansas.

During his time spent in Minneapolis, there was another George Carver in town, which caused confusion over receiving mail. Carver chose a middle initial at random and began requesting letters to him be addressed to George W. Carver. Someone once asked if the &quot;W&quot; stood for Washington, and Carver grinned and said, &quot;Why not?&quot; However, he never used Washington as his middle name, and signed his name as either George W. Carver or simply George Carver.

==College education==
Carver applied to several colleges before being accepted at Highland University in Highland, Kansas. When he arrived, they refused to let him attend because of his race. In August 1886, Carver traveled by wagon with J. F. Beeler from Highland to Eden Township in Ness County, Kansas. He homesteaded a claim near Beeler, where he maintained a small conservatory of plants and flowers and a geological collection. He manually plowed of the claim, planting rice, corn, Indian corn and garden produce, as well as various fruit trees, forest trees, and shrubbery. He also earned money by odd jobs in town and worked as a ranch hand.

In early 1888, Carver obtained a $300 (~$ in ) loan at the Bank of Ness City for education. By June he left the area. In 1890, Carver started studying art and piano at Simpson College in Indianola, Iowa. His art teacher, Etta Budd, recognized Carver&#x27;s talent for painting flowers and plants; she encouraged him to study botany at Iowa State Agricultural College (now Iowa State University) in Ames.

When he began there in 1891, he was the first black student at Iowa State. Carver&#x27;s bachelor&#x27;s thesis for a degree in Agriculture was &quot;Plants as Modified by Man&quot;, dated 1894. Iowa State University professors Joseph Budd and Louis Pammel convinced Carver to continue there for his master&#x27;s degree. Carver did research at the Iowa Experiment Station under Pammel during the next two years. His work at the experiment station in plant pathology and mycology first gained him national recognition and respect as a botanist. Carver received his Master of Science degree in 1896. Carver taught as the first African American faculty member at Iowa State.

Despite occasionally being addressed as &quot;doctor&quot;, Carver never received an official doctorate, and in a personal communication with Pammel, he noted that it was a &quot;misnomer&quot;, given to him by others due to his abilities and their assumptions about his education. Though he did not have an earned doctorate, both Simpson College and Selma University awarded him honorary doctorates of science in his lifetime. In addition, Iowa State awarded him a posthumous doctor of humane letters degree in 1994.

==Tuskegee Institute==

In 1896, Booker T. Washington, the first principal and president of the Tuskegee Institute (now Tuskegee University), invited Carver to head its Agriculture Department. Carver taught there for 47 years, developing the department into a strong research center and working with two additional college presidents during his tenure. He taught methods of crop rotation, introduced several alternative cash crops for farmers that would also improve the soil of areas heavily cultivated in cotton, initiated research into crop products (chemurgy), and taught generations of black students farming techniques for self-sufficiency.

Carver designed a mobile classroom to take education out to farmers. He called it a &quot;Jesup wagon&quot; after the New York financier and philanthropist Morris Ketchum Jesup, who provided funding to support the program.

To recruit Carver to Tuskegee, Washington gave him an above average salary and two rooms for his personal use, although both concessions were resented by some other faculty. Because he had earned a master&#x27;s in a scientific field from a &quot;white&quot; institution, some faculty perceived him as arrogant. Unmarried faculty members normally had to share rooms, with two to a room, in the spartan early days of the institute.

One of Carver&#x27;s duties was to administer the Agricultural Experiment Station farms. He had to manage the production and sale of farm products to generate revenue for the institute. He soon proved to be a poor administrator and clashed with other faculty members, especially George Ruffin Bridgeforth. In 1900, Carver complained that the physical work and the letter-writing required were too much.

In 1904, an Institute committee reported that Carver&#x27;s reports on yields from the poultry yard were exaggerated, and Washington confronted Carver about the issue. Carver replied in writing, &quot;Now to be branded as a liar and party to such hellish deception it is more than I can bear, and if your committee feel that I have willfully lied or [was] party to such lies as were told my resignation is at your disposal.&quot; During Washington&#x27;s last five years at Tuskegee, Carver submitted or threatened his resignation several times: when the administration reorganized the agriculture programs, when he disliked a teaching assignment, to manage an experiment station elsewhere, and when he did not get summer teaching assignments in 1913–14. In each case, Washington smoothed things over.
Carver started his academic career as a researcher and teacher. In 1911, Washington wrote a letter to him complaining that Carver had not followed orders to plant particular crops at the experiment station. This revealed Washington&#x27;s micro-management of Carver&#x27;s department, which he had headed for more than 10 years by then. Washington at the same time refused Carver&#x27;s requests for a new laboratory, research supplies for his exclusive use, and respite from teaching classes. Washington praised Carver&#x27;s abilities in teaching and original research but said this about his administrative skills:

When it comes to the organization of classes, the ability required to secure a properly organized and large school or section of a school, you are wanting in ability. When it comes to the matter of practical farm managing which will secure definite, practical, financial results, you are wanting again in ability.

In 1911, Carver complained that his laboratory had not received the equipment which Washington had promised 11 months before. He also complained about Institute committee meetings. Washington praised Carver in his 1911 memoir, &quot;My Larger Education: Being Chapters from My Experience&quot;. Washington called Carver &quot;one of the most thoroughly scientific men of the Negro race with whom I am acquainted&quot;. After Washington died in 1915, his successor made fewer demands on Carver for administrative tasks.

From 1915 to 1923, Carver concentrated on researching and experimenting with new uses for peanuts, sweet potatoes, soybeans, pecans, and other crops, as well as having his assistants research and compile existing uses. This work, and especially his speaking to a national conference of the Peanut Growers Association in 1920 and in testimony before Congress in 1921 to support passage of a tariff on imported peanuts, brought him wide publicity and increasing renown. In these years, he became one of the most well-known African Americans of his time.

==Rise to fame==

Carver developed techniques to improve soils depleted by repeated plantings of cotton. Together with other agricultural experts, he urged farmers to restore nitrogen to their soils by practicing systematic crop rotation: alternating cotton crops with plantings of sweet potatoes or legumes, such as peanuts, soybeans and cowpeas. These crops both restored nitrogen to the soil and were good for human consumption.

Following the crop rotation practice resulted in improved cotton yields and gave farmers alternative cash crops. To train farmers to successfully rotate and cultivate the new crops, Carver developed an agricultural extension program for Alabama that was similar to the one at Iowa State. To encourage better nutrition in the South, he widely distributed recipes using the alternative crops.

He founded an industrial research laboratory, where he and assistants worked to popularize the new crops by developing hundreds of applications for them. They did original research as well as promoting applications and recipes, which they collected from others. Carver distributed his information as agricultural bulletins.

Carver&#x27;s work was known by officials in the national capital before he became a public figure. President Theodore Roosevelt publicly admired his work. Former professors of Carver&#x27;s from Iowa State University were appointed to positions as Secretary of Agriculture: James Wilson, a former dean and professor of Carver&#x27;s, served from 1897 to 1913. Henry Cantwell Wallace served from 1921 to 1924. He knew Carver personally because his son Henry A. Wallace and the researcher were friends. The younger Wallace served as U.S. Secretary of Agriculture from 1933 to 1940, and as Franklin Delano Roosevelt&#x27;s vice president from 1941 to 1945.

The American industrialist, farmer, and inventor William C. Edenborn of Winn Parish, Louisiana, grew peanuts on his demonstration farm. He consulted with Carver.

In 1916, Carver was made a member of the Royal Society of Arts in England, one of only a handful of Americans at that time to receive this honor. Carver&#x27;s promotion of peanuts gained him the most notice.

By 1920, the U.S. peanut farmers were being undercut by low prices on imported peanuts from the Republic of China. In 1921, peanut farmers and industry representatives planned to appear at Congressional hearings to ask for a tariff. Based on the quality of Carver&#x27;s presentation at their convention, they asked the African-American professor to testify on the tariff issue before the Ways and Means Committee of the United States House of Representatives. Due to segregation, it was highly unusual for an African American to appear as an expert witness, but Carver appeared and unpacked numerous exhibits and samples to make his case for greater food and industrial uses for the peanut. Southern congressmen mocked him, but as he talked about the importance of the peanut and its uses for American agriculture and manufacturing, committee members repeatedly extended the time for his testimony. The Fordney–McCumber Tariff was enacted in 1922, and included a duty on imported peanuts. Carver&#x27;s testimony, including samples of peanut milk, peanut flour, industrial dyes made from peanuts, and other peanut-based products, made him widely known as a public figure.

==Life while famous==

During the last two decades of his life, Carver seemed to enjoy his celebrity status. He was often on the road promoting Tuskegee University, peanuts, sweet potatoes, and racial harmony. Although he only published six agricultural bulletins after 1922, he published articles in peanut industry journals and wrote a syndicated newspaper column, &quot;Professor Carver&#x27;s Advice&quot;. Business leaders came to seek his help, and he often responded with free advice. Three American presidents—Theodore Roosevelt, Calvin Coolidge and Franklin Roosevelt—met with him, and the Crown Prince of Sweden studied with him for three weeks. From 1923 to 1933, Carver toured white Southern colleges for the Commission on Interracial Cooperation.

With his increasing notability, Carver became the subject of biographies and articles. Raleigh H. Merritt contacted him for his biography published in 1929. Merritt wrote:

At present not a great deal has been done to utilize Dr. Carver&#x27;s discoveries commercially. He says that he is merely scratching the surface of scientific investigations of the possibilities of the peanut and other Southern products.

In 1932, the writer James Saxon Childers wrote that Carver and his peanut products were almost solely responsible for the rise in U.S. peanut production after the boll weevil devastated the American cotton crop beginning about 1892. His article, &quot;A Boy Who Was Traded for a Horse&quot; (1932), in &quot;The American Magazine&quot;, and its 1937 reprint in &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot;, contributed to this myth about Carver&#x27;s influence. Other popular media tended to exaggerate Carver&#x27;s impact on the peanut industry.

From 1933 to 1935, Carver worked to develop peanut oil massages to treat infantile paralysis (polio). Ultimately, researchers found that the massages, not the peanut oil, provided the benefits of maintaining some mobility to paralyzed limbs.

From 1935 to 1937, Carver participated in the USDA Disease Survey. Carver had specialized in plant diseases and mycology for his master&#x27;s degree.

In 1937, Carver attended two chemurgy conferences, an emerging field in the 1930s, during the Great Depression and the Dust Bowl, concerned with developing new products from crops. He was invited by Henry Ford to speak at the conference held in Dearborn, Michigan, and they developed a friendship. That year Carver&#x27;s health declined, and Ford later installed an elevator at the Tuskegee dormitory where Carver lived, so that the elderly man would not have to climb stairs.

Carver had been frugal in his life, and in his seventies he established a legacy by creating a museum of his work, as well as the George Washington Carver Foundation at Tuskegee in 1938 to continue agricultural research. He donated nearly in his savings to create the foundation.

Carver headed the modern organic movement in the southern agricultural system. Carver&#x27;s background for his interest in organic farming sprouted from his father being killed during the Civil War, and when his mother was kidnapped by Confederate slave raiders. Now an orphan, Carver found comfort in botany when he was just 11 years old in Kansas. Carver learned about herbal medicine, natural pesticides, and natural fertilizers that yielded plentiful crops from his caretaker. When crops and house plants were dying, he would use his knowledge and go and nurse them back to health. As a teenager, he was termed the &quot;plant doctor&quot;.

When his study about infection in soybean reached Booker T. Washington, he invited him to come and teach at the Tuskegee Agricultural school.

Although the emancipation allowed Black families 40 acres and a mule, President Johnson revoked this and gave the land to white plantation owners instead. This prompted Black farmers to exchange what was once their land, and in turn, a small part of the land&#x27;s harvest. This led to sharecropping. Carver soon realized that farmers were not obtaining enough food to survive, and how the industrialization of cotton had contaminated the soil.

Carver wanted to find a way to organically transform Alabama&#x27;s failing soil. He found that alternating nitrogen-rich crops would let the soil get back to its natural state. Keeping crops like sweet potatoes, peanuts, and cowpeas would produce more food surplus and different types of food for farmers. Carver worked to pioneer organic fertilizers like swamp muck and compost for the farmers to use. These fertilizers were more sustainable to the planet and helped farmers to spend less money on fertilizers since they were recycling products.

Carver pushed for woodland preservation, to help improve the quality of the topsoil. He urged farmers to feed their hogs acorns. The acorns contained natural pesticides and feeding them acorns was cheaper for the farms too. Carver&#x27;s efforts towards the holistic and organic approach are still in practice today. In his research, Carver discovered Permaculture. Permaculture could be used to produce carbon from the atmosphere, produce a higher quantity of crops, and let crops flourish despite global warming.

==Relationships==

Carver never married. At age 40, he began a courtship with Sarah L. Hunt, an elementary school teacher and the sister-in-law of Warren Logan, Treasurer of Tuskegee Institute. This lasted three years until she took a teaching job in California. In her 2015 biography, Christina Vella reviews his relationships and suggests that Carver was bisexual and constrained by mores of his historic period.

When he was 70, Carver established a friendship and research partnership with the scientist Austin W. Curtis Jr. This young black man, a graduate of Cornell University, had some teaching experience before coming to Tuskegee. Carver bequeathed to Curtis his royalties from an authorized 1943 biography by Rackham Holt. After Carver died in 1943, Curtis was fired from Tuskegee Institute. He left Alabama and resettled in Detroit. There he manufactured and sold peanut-based personal care products.

==Death==
Upon returning home one day, Carver suffered a bad fall down a flight of stairs; he was found unconscious by a maid who took him to a hospital. Carver died January 5, 1943, at the age of 78 or 79 from complications (anemia) resulting from this fall. His death came when he was sitting up in bed while painting a Christmas card which said, &quot;Peace on earth and goodwill to all men.&quot; Carver biographer Prema Ramakrishnan said of him that &quot;His death was characteristic of him and his entire life’s work.&quot; He was buried next to Booker T. Washington at Tuskegee University. Due to his frugality, Carver&#x27;s life savings totaled $60,000, all of which he donated in his last years and at his death to the Carver Museum and to the George Washington Carver Foundation.

On his grave was written, &quot;He could have added fortune to fame, but caring for neither, he found happiness and honor in being helpful to the world.&quot;

==Personal life==

===Christianity===

Carver believed he could have faith both in God and science and integrated them into his life. He testified on many occasions that his faith in Jesus was the only mechanism by which he could effectively pursue and perform the art of science. Carver became a Christian when he was still a young boy, as he wrote in connection to his conversion in 1931:

He was not expected to live past his 21st birthday due to failing health. He lived well past the age of 21, and his belief deepened as a result. Throughout his career, he always found friendship with other Christians. He relied on them especially when criticized by the scientific community and media regarding his research methodology.

Carver viewed faith in Jesus Christ as a means of destroying both barriers of racial disharmony and social stratification. He was as concerned with his students&#x27; character development as he was with their intellectual development. He compiled a list of &quot;eight cardinal virtues&quot; whose possession defines &quot;a lady or a gentleman&quot;:
* Be clean both inside and out.
* Who neither looks up to the rich nor down on the poor.
* Who loses, if needs be, without squealing.
* Who wins without bragging.
* Who is always considerate of women, children and old people.
* Who is too brave to lie.
* Who is too generous to cheat.
* Who take his share of the world and lets other people have theirs.
Beginning in 1906 at Tuskegee, Carver led a Bible class on Sundays for several students at their request. He regularly portrayed stories by acting them out.

===Voice pitch===
Even as an adult Carver spoke with a high pitch. Historian Linda O. McMurry noted that he &quot;was a frail and sickly child&quot; who suffered &quot;from a severe case of whooping cough and frequent bouts of what was called croup&quot;. McMurry contested the diagnosis of croup, holding rather that &quot;His stunted growth and apparently impaired vocal cords suggest instead tubercular or pneumococcal infection. Frequent infections of that nature could have caused the growth of polyps on the larynx and may have resulted from a gamma globulin deficiency. ... until his death the high pitch of his voice startled all who met him, and he suffered from frequent chest congestion and loss of voice.&quot;

==Legacy==

A movement to establish a U.S. national monument to Carver began before his death. Because of World War II, such non-war expenditures had been banned by presidential order. Missouri senator Harry S. Truman sponsored a bill in favor of a monument. In a committee hearing on the bill, one supporter said:

The bill is not simply a momentary pause on the part of busy men engaged in the conduct of the war, to do honor to one of the truly great Americans of this country, but it is in essence a blow against the Axis, it is in essence a war measure in the sense that it will further unleash and release the energies of roughly 15,000,000 Negro people in this country for full support of our war effort.

The bill passed unanimously in both houses.

On July 14, 1943, President Franklin D. Roosevelt dedicated $30,000 (~$ in ) for the George Washington Carver National Monument west-southwest of Diamond, Missouri, the area where Carver had spent time in his childhood. This was the first national monument dedicated to an African American and the first to honor someone other than a president. The national monument complex includes a bust of Carver, a -mile nature trail, a museum, the 1881 Moses Carver house, and the Carver cemetery. The national monument opened in July 1953.

In December 1947, a fire broke out in the Carver Museum, and much of the collection was damaged. &quot;Time&quot; magazine reported that all but 3 of the 48 Carver paintings at the museum were destroyed. His best-known painting, displayed at the World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition of 1893 in Chicago, depicts a yucca and cactus. This canvas survived and has undergone conservation. It is displayed together with several of his other paintings.
Carver was featured on U.S. 1948 commemorative stamps. From 1951 to 1954, he was depicted on the commemorative Carver-Washington half dollar coin along with Booker T. Washington. A second stamp honoring Carver, of face value 32¢, was issued on February 3, 1998, as part of the Celebrate the Century stamp sheet series. Two ships, the Liberty ship SS &quot;George Washington Carver&quot; and the nuclear submarine USS &quot;George Washington Carver&quot; (SSBN-656), were named in his honor.

In 1977, Carver was elected to the Hall of Fame for Great Americans. In 1990, he was inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame. In 1994, Iowa State University awarded Carver a Doctor of Humane Letters. In 2000, Carver was a charter inductee in the USDA Hall of Heroes as the &quot;Father of Chemurgy&quot;.

Many institutions continue to honor George Washington Carver. Dozens of elementary schools and high schools are named after him. National Basketball Association star David Robinson and his wife, Valerie, founded an academy named after Carver; it opened on September 17, 2001, in San Antonio, Texas. The Carver Community Cultural Center, a historic center located in San Antonio, is named for him.

In 2002, scholar Molefi Kete Asante listed George Washington Carver as one of 100 Greatest African Americans.

In 2005, Carver&#x27;s research at the Tuskegee Institute was designated a National Historic Chemical Landmark by the American Chemical Society. On February 15, 2005, an episode of &quot;Modern Marvels&quot; included scenes from within Iowa State University&#x27;s Food Sciences Building and about Carver&#x27;s work. In 2005, the Missouri Botanical Garden in St. Louis, Missouri, opened a George Washington Carver garden in his honor, which includes a life-size statue of him.

A color film of Carver shot around 1937 by African American surgeon C. Allen Alexander was added to the National Film Registry of the Library of Congress in 2019. The 12 minutes of footage were taken at the Tuskegee Institute, and includes Carver in his apartment, office and laboratory, as well as scenes of him tending flowers and displaying his paintings.

==Reputed inventions==

Carver has been given credit in popular folklore for many inventions that did not come out of his lab. Three patents (one for cosmetics; , and two for paints and stains; , and ) were issued to Carver in 1925 to 1927; however, they were not commercially successful.

Aside from these patents and some recipes for food, Carver left no records of formulae or procedures for making his products. He did not keep a laboratory notebook.
Mackintosh notes that, &quot;Carver did not explicitly claim that he had personally discovered all the peanut attributes and uses he cited, but he said nothing to prevent his audiences from drawing the inference.&quot;

Carver&#x27;s research was intended to produce replacements from common crops for commercial products, which were generally beyond the budget of the small one-horse farmer. A misconception grew that his research on products for subsistence farmers were developed by others commercially to change Southern agriculture. Carver&#x27;s work to provide small farmers with resources for more independence from the cash economy foreshadowed the &quot;appropriate technology&quot; work of E. F. Schumacher.

===Peanut products===
Dennis Keeney, director of the Leopold Center for Sustainable Agriculture at Iowa State University, wrote in the &quot;Leopold Letter&quot; (newsletter):

Carver worked on improving soils, growing crops with low inputs, and using species that fixed nitrogen (hence, the work on the cowpea and the peanut). Carver wrote in &#x27;The Need of Scientific Agriculture in the South&#x27;: &quot;The virgin fertility of our soils and the vast amount of unskilled labor have been more of a curse than a blessing to agriculture. This exhaustive system for cultivation, the destruction of forest, the rapid and almost constant decomposition of organic matter, have made our agricultural problem one requiring more brains than of the North, East or West.

Carver worked for years to create a company to market his products. The most important was the Carver Penol Company, which sold a mixture of creosote and peanuts as a patent medicine for respiratory diseases such as tuberculosis. Sales were lackluster and the product was ineffective according to the Food and Drug Administration. Other ventures were The Carver Products Company and the Carvoline Company. Carvoline Antiseptic Hair Dressing was a mix of peanut oil and lanolin. Carvoline Rubbing Oil was a peanut oil for massages.

Carver is often mistakenly credited with the invention of peanut butter. By the time Carver published &quot;How to Grow the Peanut and 105 Ways of Preparing it For Human Consumption&quot; in 1916, many methods of preparation of peanut butter had been developed or patented by various pharmacists, doctors and food scientists working in the US and Canada. The Aztecs were known to have made peanut butter from ground peanuts as early as the 15th century. Canadian pharmacist Marcellus Gilmore Edson was awarded (for its manufacture) in 1884, 12 years before Carver began his work at Tuskegee.

===Sweet potato products===
Carver is also associated with developing sweet potato products. In his 1922 sweet potato bulletin, Carver listed a few dozen recipes, &quot;many of which I have copied verbatim from Bulletin No. 129, U. S. Department of Agriculture&quot;. Carver&#x27;s records included the following sweet potato products: 73 dyes, 17 wood fillers, 14 candies, 5 library pastes, 5 breakfast foods, 4 starches, 4 flours, and 3 molasses. He also had listings for vinegars, dry coffee and instant coffee, candy, after-dinner mints, orange drops, and lemon drops.

==Carver bulletins==

During his more than four decades at Tuskegee, Carver&#x27;s official published work consisted mainly of 44 practical bulletins for farmers. His first bulletin in 1898 was on feeding acorns to farm animals. His final bulletin in 1943 was about the peanut. He also published six bulletins on sweet potatoes, five on cotton, and four on cowpeas. Some other individual bulletins dealt with alfalfa, wild plum, tomato, ornamental plants, corn, poultry, dairying, hogs, preserving meats in hot weather, and nature study in schools.

His most popular bulletin, &quot;How to Grow the Peanut and 105 Ways of Preparing it for Human Consumption&quot;, was first published in 1916 and has been reprinted numerous times. It provides a short overview of peanut crop production and contains a list of recipes from other agricultural bulletins, cookbooks, magazines, and newspapers, such as the &quot;Peerless Cookbook&quot;, &quot;Good Housekeeping&quot;, and &quot;Berry&#x27;s Fruit Recipes&quot;. While Carver&#x27;s was not the first American agricultural bulletin devoted to peanuts, his bulletins seem to have been more popular and widespread than those that preceded his.

<text>Grok () is a neologism coined by the American writer Robert A. Heinlein for his 1961 science fiction novel &quot;Stranger in a Strange Land&quot;. While the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; summarizes the meaning of &quot;grok&quot; as &quot;to understand intuitively or by empathy, to establish rapport with&quot; and &quot;to empathize or communicate sympathetically (with); also, to experience enjoyment&quot;, Heinlein&#x27;s concept is far more nuanced, with critic Istvan Csicsery-Ronay Jr. observing that &quot;the book&#x27;s major theme can be seen as an extended definition of the term.&quot; The concept of &quot;grok&quot; garnered significant critical scrutiny in the years after the book&#x27;s initial publication. The term and aspects of the underlying concept have become part of communities such as computer science.

==Descriptions in &quot;Stranger in a Strange Land&quot;==
Critic David E. Wright Sr. points out that in the 1991 &quot;uncut&quot; edition of &quot;Stranger&quot;, the word &quot;grok&quot; &quot;was used first &quot;without any explicit definition&quot; on page 22&quot; and continued to be used without being explicitly defined until page 253 (emphasis in original). He notes that this first intensional definition is simply &quot;to drink&quot;, but that this is only a metaphor &quot;much as English &#x27;I see&#x27; often means the same as &#x27;I understand&#x27;&quot;. Critics have bridged this absence of explicit definition by citing passages from &quot;Stranger&quot; that illustrate the term. A selection of these passages follows:



==Etymology==
Robert A. Heinlein originally coined the term &quot;grok&quot; in his 1961 novel &quot;Stranger in a Strange Land&quot; as a Martian word that could not be defined in Earthling terms, but can be associated with various literal meanings such as &quot;water&quot;, &quot;to drink&quot;, &quot;to relate&quot;, &quot;life&quot;, or &quot;to live&quot;, and had a much more profound figurative meaning that is hard for terrestrial culture to understand because of its assumption of a singular reality.

According to the book, drinking water is a central focus on Mars, where it is scarce. Martians use the merging of their bodies with water as a simple example or symbol of how two entities can combine to create a new reality greater than the sum of its parts. The water becomes part of the drinker, and the drinker part of the water. Both &quot;grok&quot; each other. Things that once had separate realities become entangled in the same experiences, goals, history, and purpose. Within the book, the statement of divine immanence verbalized among the main characters, &quot;thou art God&quot;, is logically derived from the concept inherent in the term &quot;grok&quot;.

Heinlein describes Martian words as &quot;guttural&quot; and &quot;jarring&quot;. Martian speech is described as sounding &quot;like a bullfrog fighting a cat&quot;. Accordingly, &quot;grok&quot; is generally pronounced as a guttural &quot;gr&quot; terminated by a sharp &quot;k&quot; with very little or no vowel sound (a narrow IPA transcription might be ). William Tenn suggests Heinlein in creating the word might have been influenced by Tenn&#x27;s very similar concept of &quot;griggo&quot;, earlier introduced in Tenn&#x27;s story &quot;Venus and the Seven Sexes&quot; (published in 1949). In his later afterword to the story, Tenn says Heinlein considered such influence &quot;very possible&quot;.

==Adoption and modern usage==

===In computer programmer culture===
Uses of the word in the decades after the 1960s are more concentrated in computer culture, such as an &quot;InfoWorld&quot; columnist in 1984 imagining a computer saying, &quot;There isn&#x27;t any software! Only different internal states of hardware. It&#x27;s all hardware! It&#x27;s a shame programmers don&#x27;t grok that better.&quot;

The Jargon File, which describes itself as &quot;The Hacker&#x27;s Dictionary&quot; and has been published under that name three times, puts &quot;grok&quot; in a programming context:

The entry existed in the very earliest forms of the Jargon File in the early 1980s. A typical tech usage from the &quot;Linux Bible, 2005&quot; characterizes the Unix software development philosophy as &quot;one that can make your life a lot simpler once you grok the idea&quot;.

The book &quot;Perl Best Practices&quot; defines &quot;grok&quot; as understanding a portion of computer code in a profound way. It goes on to suggest that to &quot;re-grok&quot; code is to reload the intricacies of that portion of code into one&#x27;s memory after some time has passed and all the details of it are no longer remembered. In that sense, &quot;to grok&quot; means to load everything into memory for immediate use. It is analogous to the way a processor caches memory for short term use, but the only implication by this reference was that it was something a human (or perhaps a Martian) would do.

The main web page for cURL, an open source tool and programming library, describes the function of cURL as &quot;cURL groks URLs&quot;.

The book &quot;Cyberia&quot; covers its use in this subculture extensively:

The keystroke logging software used by the NSA for its remote intelligence gathering operations is named GROK.

One of the most powerful parsing filters used in Elasticsearch software&#x27;s logstash component is named &quot;grok&quot;.

A reference book by Carey Bunks on the use of the GNU Image Manipulation Program is titled &quot;Grokking the GIMP&quot;.

The generative artificial intelligence chatbot developed by xAI is named G&quot;rok&quot;&quot;.&quot;

===In counterculture===
*Tom Wolfe, in his book &quot;The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test&quot; (1968), describes a character&#x27;s thoughts during an acid trip: &quot;He looks down, two bare legs, a torso rising up at him and like he is just noticing them for the first time... he has never seen any of this flesh before, this stranger. He groks over that...&quot;

*In his counterculture Volkswagen repair manual, &quot;How to Keep Your Volkswagen Alive: A Manual of Step-by-Step Procedures for the Compleat Idiot&quot; (1969), dropout aerospace engineer John Muir instructs prospective used VW buyers to &quot;grok the car&quot; before buying.

*The word was used numerous times by Robert Anton Wilson in his works &quot;The Illuminatus! Trilogy&quot; and &quot;Schrödinger&#x27;s Cat Trilogy&quot;. For instance, in &quot;The Eye in the Pyramid&quot;, volume one of &quot;Illuminatus&quot;:
*And in &quot;The Trick Top Hat&quot;, volume two of &quot;Schrödinger&#x27;s Cat&quot;:

<text>The Geelong Football Club, nicknamed the Cats, is a professional Australian rules football club based at Kardinia Park in South Geelong, Victoria, Australia. The club competes in the Australian Football League (AFL), the sport&#x27;s premier competition. The club formed in 1859, making it the second-oldest AFL side after Melbourne and one of the oldest football clubs in the world.

In the 1860s, Geelong participated in a series of Challenge Cup competitions, and was a foundation member of both the Victorian Football Association (VFA) in 1877 and the Victorian Football League (VFL) in 1897, now the national AFL. The club won the Western District Challenge Cup in 1875, a then-record seven VFA premierships between 1878 and 1886, and six VFL premierships by 1963, after which it experienced a 44-year waiting period until it won its next premiership, a Grand Final-record 119-point victory in 2007. Geelong won a further three premierships in 2009, 2011 and 2022. The Cats have fierce competitive rivalries with Hawthorn and Collingwood.

Geelong play most of their home games at Kardinia Park (known for sponsorship reasons as GMHBA Stadium) and play the remainder at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. Geelong&#x27;s traditional guernsey colours are white with navy blue hoops. The club&#x27;s nickname was first used in 1923 after a run of losses prompted a local cartoonist to suggest that the club needed a black cat to bring it good luck. Geelong also field teams in other competitions; a reserves men&#x27;s team in the Victorian Football League (VFL), a senior women&#x27;s team in the AFL Women&#x27;s (AFLW) and a reserves women&#x27;s team in the VFL Women&#x27;s (VFLW) competitions. The club&#x27;s official team song and anthem is &quot;We Are Geelong&quot;.

==History==

The club was founded in 1859 in the city of Geelong, Australia, and is the second oldest AFL club. It is believed to be the fourth oldest football club in Australia and one of the oldest in the world and one of the most successful. Initially playing under its own rules, some of which, notably, were permanently introduced into Australian Football, it adopted the Laws of Australian Football in the early 1860s after a series of compromises with the Melbourne Football Club.

Geelong went on to play for most of its existence in the premier competitions, the first competition, the Caledonian Society Cup, a foundation club of both the Victorian Football Association (VFA) in 1877 and the Victorian Football League (VFL) in 1897., VFL and continues in the elite Australian Football League (AFL). The Cats have been the VFL/AFL premiers ten times, with four in the AFL era (since 1990) in 2007, 2009, 2011, and most recently, 2022, to be the second most successful club over that period one behind Hawthorn. They have also won ten McClelland Trophies, the most of any AFL/VFL club.

Many of the club&#x27;s official records before 1920 have disappeared.

== Club identity and culture ==

=== Guernseys ===

Geelong&#x27;s traditional navy blue and white hooped guernsey has been worn since the club&#x27;s inception in the mid-1800s. The design is said to represent the white seagulls and blue water of Corio Bay.

The team has worn various away guernseys since 1998, all featuring the club&#x27;s logo and traditional colours.

=== Nickname ===
Geelong has been nicknamed the &#x27;Cats&#x27; since 1923, when the &quot;Herald&quot; sporting local cartoonist, &quot;Wells&quot; (Samuel Garnet Wells), suggested that adopting a black cat as a mascot might bring a football club good luck in his &quot;Herald&quot; cartoon of 6 July 1923.

===Song: &quot;We Are Geelong&quot;===
&quot;We Are Geelong&quot; is the song sung after a game won by the Geelong Football Club. It is sung to the tune of &quot;Toreador&quot; from &quot;Carmen&quot;. The lyrics were written by former premiership player John Watts. Only the first verse is used at matches and by the team after a victory. The song currently used by the club was recorded by the Fable Singers in April 1972.

: &quot;We are Geelong, the greatest team of all&quot;
: &quot;We are Geelong; we&#x27;re always on the ball&quot;
: &quot;We play the game as it should be played&quot;
: &quot;At home or far away&quot;
: &quot;Our banners fly high, from dawn to dark&quot;
: &quot;Down at Kardinia Park.&quot;

: &quot;So! Stand up and fight, remember our tradition&quot;
: &quot;Stand up and fight, it&#x27;s always our ambition&quot;
: &quot;Throughout the game to fight with all our might&quot;
: &quot;Because we&#x27;re the mighty blue and white&quot;
: &quot;And when the ball is bounced, to the final bell&quot;
: &quot;Stand up and fight like hell!&quot;

== Stadium and training facilities ==
Geelong&#x27;s administrative headquarters is its home stadium, GMHBA Stadium or also known as Kardinia Park. The club trains here during the season, however it also trains at its alternate training venue, the Deakin University Elite Sports Precinct. The latter features an MCG-sized oval and is used often by the club in the pre-season, when Kardinia Park is being used for other events.

== Rivalries ==
=== Hawthorn ===

The rivalry between Hawthorn and Geelong is defined by two Grand Finals: those of 1989 and 2008. In the 1989 Grand Final, Geelong played the man, resulting in major injuries for several Hawks players, Mark Yeates knocking out Dermott Brereton at the opening bounce; Hawthorn controlled the game, leading by approximately 40 points for most of the match; in the last quarter, Geelong almost managed to come from behind to win, but fell short by six points. In the 2008 Grand Final, Geelong was the heavily backed favourite and had lost only one match for the season, but lost by 26 points; Geelong then won its next eleven matches against Hawthorn over the following five years, under a curse, which was dubbed the &quot;Kennett curse&quot; which was attributed to disrespectful comments made by Hawthorn president Jeff Kennett following the 2008 Grand Final. It was later revealed that after the 2008 grand final, Paul Chapman initiated a pact between other Geelong players to never lose to Hawthorn again. The curse was broken in a preliminary final in 2013, after Paul Chapman played his final match for Geelong the previous week. Hawthorn went on to win the next three premierships. In 2016 Geelong again defeated Hawthorn in the qualifying final. In twenty matches between the two sides between 2008 and 2017, twelve were decided by less than ten points, with Geelong victorious in eleven of those twelve matches.

=== Collingwood ===
In 1925, Geelong won their first flag over Collingwood. In 1930, Collingwood defeated Geelong in the grand final making it four flags in-a-row for the Pies. Geelong would later deny Collingwood three successive premierships in 1937, winning a famous grand final by 32 points.

The two sides played against each other in 6 finals between 1951 and 1955, including the 1952 Grand Final when Geelong easily beat Collingwood by 46 points. In 1953, Collingwood ended Geelong&#x27;s record 23-game winning streak in the home and away season, and later defeated them by 12 points in the grand final, denying the Cats a third successive premiership.

Since 2007, the clubs have again both been at the top of the ladder and have met regularly in finals. Geelong won a memorable preliminary final by five points on their way to their first flag in 44 years. In 2008, Collingwood inflicted Geelong&#x27;s only home-and-away loss, by a massive 86 points, but the teams did not meet in the finals. They would meet in preliminary finals in 2009 and 2010, each winning one &quot;en route&quot; to a premiership. They finally met again in a Grand Final in 2011, which Geelong won by 38 points; Geelong inflicted Collingwood&#x27;s only three losses for the 2011 season.

== Corporate ==
=== Sponsorship ===
At 99 years as of 2024, Geelong&#x27;s sponsorship with the Ford Motor Company is one of the longest active sports sponsorship of any sports team in the world, with continuous sponsorship dating back to 1925. The sponsorship had previously been ratified as the longest in the world by the Guinness World Records, until a change in definitions.

In recent years Geelong-based retail company Cotton On Group has become synonymous with the club, with the company manufacturing on-field and other team merchandise since 2016.

== Reserves team ==

The Geelong reserves (also known as the Bendigo Bank Cats for sponsorship reasons) are the reserves side of the club, playing in the Victorian Football League.

===History===
Geelong&#x27;s reserves side began competing in the Victorian Junior Football League, later known as the VFL/AFL reserves, in 1922. The team won thirteen premierships during that time (1923, 1924, 1930, 1937, 1938, 1948, 1960, 1963, 1964, 1975, 1980, 1981 and 1982), the most of any club.

Since the demise of the AFL reserves competition, the Geelong reserves have competed in the Victorian Football League. Unlike all other Victorian AFL clubs, Geelong has never operated in a reserves affiliation with an existing VFL club, having instead operated its stand-alone reserves team continuously. The team is composed of both reserves players from the club&#x27;s primary and rookie AFL lists, and a separately maintained list of players eligible only for VFL matches. Home games are played at GMHBA Stadium, with some played as curtain-raisers to senior AFL matches.

The side is also known as the Bendigo Bank Cats, referring to the club&#x27;s commercial partnership with Bendigo Bank.

In September 2017, the club was announced as one of two clubs, along with , to receive a license to join the competition in 2019. The club has also had a team in the second-tier VFL Women&#x27;s league since 2017.

<doc id="13009" wikidata="Q193902" url="?curid=13009" title="Galileo (satellite navigation)">
<text>Galileo is a global navigation satellite system (GNSS) created by the European Union through the European Space Agency (ESA) and operated by the European Union Agency for the Space Programme (EUSPA). It is headquartered in Prague, Czechia, with two ground operations centres in Oberpfaffenhofen, Germany (mostly responsible for the control of the satellites), and in Fucino, Italy, (mostly responsible for providing the navigation data). The €10 billion project went live in 2016. It is named after the Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei. 

One of the aims of Galileo is to provide an independent high-precision positioning system so European political and military authorities do not have to rely on the US GPS, or the Russian GLONASS systems, which could be disabled or degraded by their operators at any time. The use of basic (lower-precision) Galileo services is free and open to everyone. A higher-precision service is available for free since 24 January 2023, previously only available to government-authorized users. Galileo is also to provide a new global search and rescue (SAR) function as part of the MEOSAR system.

The first Galileo test satellite GIOVE-A was launched 28 December 2005, while the first satellite to be part of the operational system was launched on 21 October 2011. Galileo started offering Early Operational Capability (EOC) on 15 December 2016, providing initial services with a weak signal. In October 2018, four more Galileo satellites were brought online, increasing the number of active satellites to 18. In November 2018, the FCC approved use of Galileo in the US. As of September 2024, there are 25 launched satellites that operate in the constellation. It is expected that the next generation of satellites will begin to become operational after 2026 to replace the first generation, which can then be used for backup capabilities.

The Galileo system has a greater accuracy than GPS, having an accuracy of less than 1 m when using broadcast ephemeris (GPS: 3 m) and a signal-in-space ranging error (SISRE) of 1.6 cm (GPS: 2.3 cm) when using real-time corrections for satellite orbits and clocks.

== History ==
=== Main objectives ===
In 1999, the different concepts of the three main contributors of the European Space Agency (ESA) (Germany, France and Italy) for Galileo were compared and reduced to one by a joint team of engineers from all three countries. The first stage of the Galileo programme was agreed upon officially on 26 May 2003 by the European Union and the ESA. The system is intended primarily for civilian use, unlike the more military-focused systems of the United States (GPS), Russia (GLONASS) and China (BeiDou) in that Galileo doesn&#x27;t limit accuracy for non-military applications. The European system could be subject to shutdown for military purposes in extreme circumstances (such as an armed conflict). Italy and Germany led the development of the first generation of the Galileo programme, while France is playing a more prominent role in the development of the Galileo Second Generation (G2G).

=== Funding ===
The European Commission had some difficulty funding the project&#x27;s next stage, after several allegedly &quot;per annum&quot; sales projection graphs for the project were exposed in November 2001 as &quot;cumulative&quot; projections, which for each year projected included all previous years of sales. The attention that was brought to this multi-billion euro growing error in sales forecasts resulted in a general awareness in the commission and elsewhere that it was unlikely that the programme would yield the return on investment that had previously been suggested to investors and decision-makers. On 17 January 2002, a spokesman for the project stated that, as a result of US pressure and economic difficulties, &quot;Galileo is almost dead&quot;.

A few months later, however, the situation changed dramatically. European Union member states decided it was important to have a satellite-based positioning and timing infrastructure that the US could not easily turn off in times of political conflict.

The European Union and the European Space Agency agreed in March 2002 to fund the project, pending a review in 2003 (which was completed on 26 May 2003). The starting cost for the period ending in 2005 is estimated at €1.1 billion. The required satellites (the planned number is 30) were to be launched between 2011 and 2014, with the system up and running and under civilian control from 2019. The final cost is estimated at €3 billion, including the infrastructure on Earth, constructed in 2006 and 2007. The plan was for private companies and investors to invest at least two-thirds of the cost of implementation, with the EU and ESA dividing the remaining cost. The base &quot;Open Service&quot; is to be available without charge to anyone with a Galileo-compatible receiver, with an encrypted higher-bandwidth improved-precision &quot;Commercial Service&quot; originally planned to be available at a cost, but in February 2018 the high accuracy service (HAS) (providing Precise Point Positioning data on the E6 frequency) was agreed to be made freely available, with the authentication service remaining commercial. By early 2011 costs for the project had run 50% over initial estimates.

=== Tension with the United States ===
Galileo is intended to be an EU civilian GNSS that allows all users access to it. Initially GPS reserved the highest quality signal for military use, and the signal available for civilian use was intentionally degraded (Selective Availability). This changed with President Bill Clinton signing a policy directive in 1996 to turn off Selective Availability. Since May 2000 the same precision signal has been provided to both civilians and the military.

Since Galileo was designed to provide the highest possible precision (greater than GPS) to anyone, the US was concerned that an enemy could use Galileo signals in military strikes against the US and its allies (some weapons like missiles use GNSSs for guidance). The frequency initially chosen for Galileo would have made it impossible for the US to block the Galileo signals without also interfering with its own GPS signals. The US did not want to lose their GNSS capability with GPS while denying enemies the use of GNSS. Some US officials became especially concerned when Chinese interest in Galileo was reported.

An anonymous EU official claimed that the US officials implied that they might consider shooting down Galileo satellites in the event of a major conflict in which Galileo was used in attacks against American forces.The EU&#x27;s stance is that Galileo is a neutral technology, available to all countries and everyone. At first, EU officials did not want to change their original plans for Galileo, but they have since reached the compromise that Galileo is to use different frequencies. This allows the blocking or jamming of either GNSS without affecting the other.

==== GPS and Galileo ====
One of the reasons given for developing Galileo as an independent system was that position information from GPS can be made significantly inaccurate by the deliberate application of universal selective availability (SA) by the US military. GPS is widely used worldwide for civilian applications; Galileo&#x27;s proponents argued that civil infrastructure, including aircraft navigation and landing, should not rely solely upon a system with this vulnerability.

On 2 May 2000, the selective availability was disabled by the President of the United States, Bill Clinton; in late 2001 the entity managing the GPS confirmed that it did not intend to enable selective availability ever again. Though Selective Availability capability still exists, on 19 September 2007 the US Department of Defense announced that newer GPS satellites would not be capable of implementing Selective Availability; the wave of Block IIF satellites launched in 2009, and all subsequent GPS satellites, are stated not to support selective availability. As old satellites are replaced in the GPS Block III programme, selective availability will cease to be an option. The modernisation programme also contains standardised features that allow GPS III and Galileo systems to inter-operate, allowing receivers to be developed to utilise GPS and Galileo together to create an even more accurate GNSS.

=== Cooperation with the United States ===
In June 2004, in a signed agreement with the United States, the European Union agreed to switch to a binary offset carrier modulation 1.1, or BOC(1,1), allowing the coexistence of both GPS and Galileo, and the future combined use of both systems. The European Union also agreed to address the &quot;mutual concerns related to the protection of allied and US national security capabilities&quot;.

=== First experimental satellites: GIOVE-A and GIOVE-B ===
The first experimental satellite, GIOVE-A, was launched in December 2005 and was followed by a second test satellite, GIOVE-B, launched in April 2008. After successful completion of the In-Orbit Validation (IOV) phase, additional satellites were launched. On 30 November 2007, the 27 EU transport ministers involved reached an agreement that Galileo should be operational by 2013, but later press releases suggest it was delayed to 2014.

=== Funding again, governance issues ===
In mid-2006, the public-private partnership fell apart, and the European Commission decided to nationalise the Galileo programme.

In early 2007, the EU had yet to decide how to pay for the system and the project was said to be &quot;in deep crisis&quot; due to lack of more public funds. German Transport Minister Wolfgang Tiefensee was particularly doubtful about the consortium&#x27;s ability to end the infighting at a time when only one testbed satellite had been successfully launched.

Although a decision was yet to be reached, on 13 July 2007 EU countries discussed cutting €548 million (US$755 million, £370 million) from the union&#x27;s competitiveness budget for the following year and shifting some of these funds to other parts of the financing pot, a move that could meet part of the cost of the union&#x27;s Galileo satellite navigation system. European Union research and development projects could be scrapped to overcome a funding shortfall.

In November 2007, it was agreed to reallocate funds from the EU&#x27;s agriculture and administration budgets and to soften the tendering process in order to invite more EU companies.

In April 2008, the EU transport ministers approved the Galileo Implementation Regulation. This allowed the €3.4 billion to be released from the EU&#x27;s agriculture and administration budgets to allow the issuing of contracts to start construction of the ground station and the satellites.

In June 2009, the European Court of Auditors published a report, pointing out governance issues, substantial delays and budget overruns that led to project stalling in 2007, leading to further delays and failures.

In October 2009, the European Commission cut the number of satellites definitively planned from 28 to 22, with plans to order the remaining six at a later time. It also announced that the first OS, PRS and SoL signal would be available in 2013, and the CS and SOL some time later. The €3.4 billion budget for the 2006–2013 period was considered insufficient. In 2010, the think-tank Open Europe estimated the total cost of Galileo from start to 20 years after completion at €22.2 billion, borne entirely by taxpayers. Under the original estimates made in 2000, this cost would have been €7.7 billion, with €2.6 billion borne by taxpayers and the rest by private investors.

In November 2009, a ground station for Galileo was inaugurated near Kourou (French Guiana). The launch of the first four in-orbit validation (IOV) satellites was planned for the second half of 2011, and the launch of full operational capability (FOC) satellites was planned to start in late 2012.

In March 2010, it was verified that the budget for Galileo would only be available to provide the 4 IOV and 14 FOC satellites by 2014, with no funds then committed to bring the constellation above this 60% capacity. Paul Verhoef, the satellite navigation program manager at the European Commission, indicated that this limited funding would have serious consequences commenting at one point &quot;To give you an idea, that would mean that for three weeks in the year you will not have satellite navigation&quot; in reference to the proposed 18-vehicle constellation.

In July 2010, the European Commission estimated further delays and additional costs of the project to grow up to €1.5–1.7 billion, and moved the estimated date of completion to 2018. After completion the system will need to be subsidised by governments at €750 million per year. An additional €1.9 billion was planned to be spent bringing the system up to the full complement of 30 satellites (27 operational + 3 active spares).

In December 2010, EU ministers in Brussels voted Prague, in the Czech Republic, as the headquarters of the Galileo project.

In January 2011, infrastructure costs up to 2020 were estimated at €5.3 billion. In that same month, Wikileaks revealed that Berry Smutny, the CEO of the German satellite company OHB-System, said that Galileo &quot;is a stupid idea that primarily serves French interests&quot;. The BBC learned in 2011 that €500 million (£440 million) would become available to make the extra purchase, taking Galileo within a few years from 18 operational satellites to 24.

The first two Galileo In-Orbit Validation satellites were launched by Soyuz ST-B flown from Centre Spatial Guyanais on 21 October 2011, and the remaining two on 12 October 2012. As of 2017, the satellites are fully useful for precise positioning and geodesy with a limited usability in navigation.

Twenty-two further satellites with Full Operational Capability (FOC) were on order . The first four pairs of satellites were launched on 22 August 2014, 27 March 2015, 11 September 2015 and 17 December 2015.

== Clock failures ==
In January 2017, news agencies reported that six of the passive hydrogen masers (PHM) and three of the rubidium atomic clocks (RAFS) had failed. Four of the full operational satellites have each lost at least one clock; but no satellite has lost more than two. The operation has not been affected as each satellite is launched with four clocks (2 PHM and 2 RAFS). The possibility of a systemic flaw is being considered. SpectraTime, the Swiss producer of both on-board clock types, declined to comment. According to ESA, they concluded with their industrial partners for the rubidium atomic clocks that some implemented testing and operational measures were required. Additionally some refurbishment is required for the rubidium atomic clocks that still have to be launched. For the passive hydrogen masers operational measures are being studied to reduce the risk of failure. China and India use the same SpectraTime-built atomic clocks in their satellite navigation systems. ESA has contacted the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) who initially reported not having experienced similar failures. However, at the end of January 2017, Indian news outlets reported that all three clocks aboard the IRNSS-1A satellite (launched in July 2013 with a 10-year life expectancy) had failed and that a replacement satellite would be launched in the second half of 2017: these atomic clocks were said to be supplied under a four-million-euro deal.

In July 2017, the European Commission reported that the main causes of the malfunctions have been identified and measures have been put in place to reduce the possibility of further malfunctions of the satellites already in space. According to European sources, ESA took measures to correct both identified sets of problems by replacing a faulty component that can cause a short circuit in the rubidium clocks and improve the passive hydrogen maser clocks as well on satellites still to be launched.

=== Outages ===
==== 2019 ====
From 11 July till 18 July 2019, the whole constellation experienced an &quot;unexplained&quot; signal outage with all active satellites showing &quot;NOT USABLE&quot; status on the Galileo status page. The cause of the incident was an equipment malfunction in the Galileo ground infrastructure that affected the calculation of time and orbit predictions.

==== 2020 ====
On 14 December 2020, starting at 0:00 UTC, Galileo experienced a system-wide performance degradation lasting for 6 hours. GNSS receivers ignoring a &#x27;marginal&#x27; status flag in the Galileo data could have experienced a pseudorange error of up to almost 80 km. The problem was related to an abnormal behaviour of a ground segment atomic clock in the time determination function of the system. The system uses parallel functioning Precise Timing Facilities in the Fucino and Oberpfaffenhofen Galileo Control Centres, and an issue occurred in Fucino whilst maintenance was performed on the parallel system in Oberpfaffenhofen.

== International involvement ==
In September 2003, China joined the Galileo project. China was to invest €230 million (US$302 million, £155 million, CNY 2.34 billion) in the project over the following years.

In July 2004, Israel signed an agreement with the EU to become a partner in the Galileo project.

On 3 June 2005, the European Union and Ukraine signed an agreement for Ukraine to join the project, as noted in a press release. As of November 2005, Morocco also joined the programme.

In September 2005, India signed an agreement with the EU to join the project.

In mid-2006, the public–private partnership fell apart and the European Commission decided to nationalise Galileo as an EU programme. In November 2006, China opted instead to upgrade BeiDou navigation system, its then-regional satellite navigation system. The decision was due to security concerns and issues with Galileo financing.

On 30 November 2007, the 27 member states of the European Union unanimously agreed to move forward with the project, with plans for bases in Germany and Italy. Spain did not approve during the initial vote, but approved it later that day. This greatly improved the viability of the Galileo project: &quot;The EU&#x27;s executive had previously said that if agreement was not reached by January 2008, the long-troubled project would essentially be dead&quot;.

On 3 April 2009, Norway too joined the programme pledging €68.9 million toward development costs and allowing its companies to bid for the construction contracts. Norway, while not a member of the EU, is a member of ESA.

On 18 December 2013, Switzerland signed a cooperation agreement to fully participate in the program, and retroactively contributed €80 million for the period 2008–2013. As a member of ESA, it already collaborated in the development of the Galileo satellites, contributing the hydrogen-maser clocks. Switzerland&#x27;s financial commitment for the period 2014–2020 will be calculated in accordance with the standard formula applied for the Swiss participation in the EU research Framework Programme.

In March 2018, the European Commission announced that the United Kingdom may be excluded from parts of the project (especially relating to the secured service (PRS) following its exit from the European Union (EU). As a result, Airbus was to relocate work on the Ground Control Segment (GCS) from its Portsmouth premises to an EU state. British officials have been reported to be seeking legal advice on whether they can reclaim the €1.4 billion invested by the United Kingdom, of the €10 billion spent to date. In a speech at the EU Institute for Security Studies conference, the EU Chief Negotiator in charge of the Brexit negotiations, Michel Barnier, stressed the EU position that the UK had decided to leave the EU and thus all EU programmes, including Galileo. In August 2018, the UK stated that it would look into creating a competing satellite navigation system to Galileo post-Brexit. In December 2018, British Prime Minister Theresa May announced that the UK would no longer seek to reclaim the investment, and Science Minister Sam Gyimah resigned over the matter.

== System description ==
=== Space segment ===


As of 2012, the system was scheduled to have 15 satellites operational in 2015 and reach full operation in 2020 with the following specifications:
* 30 in-orbit spacecraft (24 in full service and 6 spares)
* Orbital altitude: (MEO)
* Orbital period: 14 hours and 5 minutes (every 17 revolutions, done in 10 sidereal days, a satellite passes over the same location)
* 3 orbital planes, 56.0° inclination, ascending nodes separated by 120.0° longitude (8 operational satellites and 2 active spares per orbital plane)
* Satellite lifetime: &gt;12 years
* Satellite mass: 
* Satellite body dimensions: 
* Span of solar arrays: 
* Power of solar arrays: 1.5 kW (end of life)
* Power of navigation antennas: 155–265 W

=== Ground segment ===

The system&#x27;s orbit and signal accuracy is controlled by a ground segment consisting of:
* Two ground control centres, located in Oberpfaffenhofen and Fucino for Satellite and Mission Control
* Seven telemetry, tracking &amp; control (TT&amp;C) stations, located in Kiruna, 2x Kourou, Nouméa, Réunion, Redu and Papeete
* Ten mission data uplink stations (ULS), two per site, located in Svalbard, Kourou, Papeete, Sainte-Marie, Réunion and Nouméa
* Several worldwide distributed reference sensor stations (GSS), including one in the Kerguelen Islands
* A data dissemination network between all geographically distributed locations
* One service centre, located in Madrid, to help Galileo users.

=== Signals ===
The system transmits three signals: E1 (1575.42 MHz), E5 (1191.795 MHz) consisting of E5a (1176.45 MHz) and E5b (1207.14 MHz), and E6 (1278.75 MHz):


=== Services ===
The Galileo system will have four main services:
;Open Service (OS):This will be available without charge for use by anyone with appropriate mass-market equipment; simple timing, and positioning down to 1 m for a double frequency receiver, best case.

;High Accuracy Service (HAS; resulting from the re-scope of the former Galileo Commercial Service): Accuracy to 20 cm free of charge.

;Public Regulated Service (PRS; encrypted): Designed to be more robust, with anti-jamming mechanisms and reliable problem detection. Limited to authorized governmental bodies.

;Search and Rescue Service (SAR): The Galileo SAR Service is a Medium Earth Orbiting Search and Rescue (MEOSAR) service and part of the International Cospas-Sarsat Programme.

==== Quarterly Service Performance Reports ====
The European GNSS Service Centre provides public quarterly performance reports regarding the Open Service and Search and Rescue Service since 2017. Generally, the reported performance parameters measurements surpass the target values.
The Galileo April, May, June 2021 Quarterly Open Service Performance Report by the European GNSS Service Centre reported the UTC Time Dissemination Service Accuracy was ≤ 4.3 nanoseconds, computed by accumulating samples over the previous 12 months and exceeding the ≤ 30 ns target value. The Signal In Space Error (SISE) was also well within the ≤  target value for Single and (more accurate) Dual Frequency receivers. The Galileo navigation message includes the differences between Galileo System Time (GST), UTC and GPS Time (GPST) (to promote interoperability).
The Galileo April, May, June 2021 Quarterly Search and Rescue Service Performance Report by the European GNSS Service Centre reported the various performance parameters measurements surpassed their target values.
=== Concept ===
Each Galileo satellite has two master passive hydrogen maser atomic clocks and two secondary rubidium atomic clocks which are independent of one other. As precise and stable space-qualified atomic clocks are critical components to any satellite-navigation system, the employed quadruple redundancy keeps Galileo functioning when onboard atomic clocks fail in space. The onboard passive hydrogen maser clocks&#x27; precision is four times better than the onboard rubidium atomic clocks and estimated at 1 second per 3 million years (a timing error of a nanosecond or 1 billionth of a second (10 or second) translates into a 30 cm positional error on Earth&#x27;s surface), and will provide an accurate timing signal to allow a receiver to calculate the time that it takes the signal to reach it. The Galileo satellites are configured to run one hydrogen maser clock in primary mode and a rubidium clock as hot backup. Under normal conditions, the operating hydrogen maser clock produces the reference frequency from which the navigation signal is generated. Should the hydrogen maser encounter any problem, an instantaneous switchover to the rubidium clock would be performed. In case of a failure of the primary hydrogen maser the secondary hydrogen maser could be activated by the ground segment to take over within a period of days as part of the redundant system. A clock monitoring and control unit provides the interface between the four clocks and the navigation signal generator unit (NSU). It passes the signal from the active hydrogen master clock to the NSU and also ensures that the frequencies produced by the master clock and the active spare are in phase, so that the spare can take over instantly should the master clock fail. The NSU information is used to calculate the position of the receiver by trilaterating the difference in received signals from multiple satellites.

The onboard passive hydrogen maser and rubidium clocks are very stable over a few hours. If they were left to run indefinitely, though, their timekeeping would drift, so they need to be synchronized regularly with a network of even more stable ground-based reference clocks. These include active hydrogen maser clocks and clocks based on the caesium frequency standard, which show a far better medium and long-term stability than rubidium or passive hydrogen maser clocks. These clocks on the ground are gathered together within the parallel functioning Precise Timing Facilities in the Fucino and Oberpfaffenhofen Galileo Control Centres. The ground based clocks also generate a worldwide time reference called Galileo System Time (GST), the standard for the Galileo system and are routinely compared to the local realisations of UTC, the UTC(k) of the European frequency and time laboratories.

For more information of the concept of global satellite navigation systems, see GNSS and GNSS positioning calculation.

== European GNSS Service Centre ==
The European GNSS Service Centre (GSC), located in Madrid, is an integral part of Galileo and provides the single interface between the Galileo system and Galileo users. GSC publishes Galileo official documentation, promotes Galileo current and future services worldwide, supports standardisation and distributes Galileo almanacs, ephemeris and metadata.

The GSC User Helpdesk is the point of contact for Galileo user&#x27;s assistance. GSC answers queries and gathers incident notifications from users on Galileo. The helpdesk is continuously available for all worldwide Galileo users through the GSC web portal.

GSC provides updated Galileo constellation status and informs on planned and unplanned events through Notice Advisory to Galileo Users (NAGU). GSC publishes Galileo reference documentation and general information on Galileo services and signals description and Galileo performance reports.

== Search and rescue ==
Galileo provides a global search and rescue (SAR) function as part of the MEOSAR system. Like Russia&#x27;s Glonass, the United States&#x27; Global Positioning System (GPS) satellites, and some Chinese BeiDou satellites, Galileo satellites are equipped with a transponder which relays 406 MHz distress frequency signals from emergency beacons by a Forward Link Service (FLS) to the Rescue coordination centre, which will then initiate a rescue operation.
After receipt of an emergency beacon signal, the Galileo SAR system provides a signal, the Return Link Message (RLM), &quot;to&quot; the emergency beacon, informing the person(s) in distress that the activated beacon has been detected and help is on the way. This return message feature is new in a satellite constellation and is considered a major upgrade compared to the existing Cospas-Sarsat system, which up to then did not provide feedback to the user. Tests in February 2014 found that for Galileo&#x27;s search and rescue function, operating as part of the existing International Cospas-Sarsat Programme, 77% of simulated distress locations can be pinpointed within , and 95% within .
The Galileo Return Link Service (RLS) went live in January 2020 for all RLS capable emergency beacons.

=== Galileo satellite test beds: GIOVE ===


In 2004, the Galileo System Test Bed Version 1 (GSTB-V1) project validated the on-ground algorithms for Orbit Determination and Time Synchronisation (OD&amp;TS). This project, led by ESA and European Satellite Navigation Industries, has provided industry with fundamental knowledge to develop the mission segment of the Galileo positioning system.

* GIOVE-A is the first GIOVE (Galileo In-Orbit Validation Element) test satellite. It was built by Surrey Satellite Technology Ltd (SSTL), and successfully launched on 28 December 2005 by the European Space Agency and the Galileo Joint Undertaking (GJU). Operation of GIOVE-A ensured that Galileo meets the frequency-filing allocation and reservation requirements for the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), a process that was required to be complete by June 2006.
* GIOVE-B, built by Astrium and Thales Alenia Space, has a more advanced payload than GIOVE-A. It was successfully launched on 27 April 2008 at 22:16 UTC aboard a Soyuz-FG/Fregat rocket provided by Starsem.

A third satellite, GIOVE-A2, was originally planned to be built by SSTL for launch in the second half of 2008. Construction of GIOVE-A2 was terminated due to the successful launch and in-orbit operation of GIOVE-B.

The GIOVE Mission segment operated by European Satellite Navigation Industries used the GIOVE-A/B satellites to provide experimental results based on real data to be used for risk mitigation for the IOV satellites that followed on from the testbeds. ESA organised the global network of ground stations to collect the measurements of GIOVE-A/B with the use of the GETR receivers for further systematic study. GETR receivers are supplied by Septentrio as well as the first Galileo navigation receivers to be used to test the functioning of the system at further stages of its deployment. Signal analysis of GIOVE-A/B data confirmed successful operation of all the Galileo signals with the tracking performance as expected.

=== In-Orbit Validation (IOV) satellites ===
These testbed satellites were followed by four IOV Galileo satellites that are much closer to the final Galileo satellite design. The search and rescue (SAR) feature is also installed. The first two satellites were launched on 21 October 2011 from Centre Spatial Guyanais using a Soyuz launcher, the other two on 12 October 2012. This enables key validation tests, since earth-based receivers such as those in cars and phones need to &quot;see&quot; a minimum of four satellites in order to calculate their position in three dimensions. Those 4 IOV Galileo satellites were constructed by Astrium GmbH and Thales Alenia Space. On 12 March 2013, a first fix was performed using those four IOV satellites. Once this In-Orbit Validation (IOV) phase has been completed, the remaining satellites will be installed to reach the Full Operational Capability.

=== Full Operational Capability (FOC) satellites ===

==== FOC Batch 1 ====
On 7 January 2010, it was announced that the contract to build the first 14 FOC satellites was awarded to OHB System and for the navigation payload to Surrey Satellite Technology Limited (SSTL). The first batch of Galileo First Generation satellites known as &quot;Batch-1&quot; consists of the Galileo-FOC FM1 to Galileo-FOC FM14 satellites.
Fourteen satellites were built at a cost of €566 million (£510 million; US$811 million). Arianespace will launch the satellites for a cost of €397 million (£358 million; US$569 million). The European Commission also announced that the €85 million contract for system support covering industrial services required by ESA for integration and validation of the Galileo system had been awarded to Thales Alenia Space. Thales Alenia Space subcontract performances to Astrium GmbH and security to Thales Communications.

==== FOC Batch 2 ====
In February 2012, an additional order of 8 FOC satellites was awarded to OHB Systems for €250 million (US$327 million), after outbidding EADS Astrium tender offer. The second batch of Galileo First Generation satellites known as &quot;Batch-2&quot; consists of the Galileo-FOC FM15 to Galileo-FOC FM22 satellites. Thus bringing the total to 22 FOC satellites. The satellites were built by OHB, with the contribution of Surrey Satellite Technology (SSTL).

==== FOC Batch 3 ====
In June and October 2017, two additional orders for 8 and 4 FOC satellites were awarded to OHB Systems for €324 million and €157.75 million. This third and final batch of Galileo First Generation satellites known as &quot;Batch-3&quot; consists of the Galileo-FOC FM23 to Galileo-FOC FM34 satellites. The satellites are being built by OHB in Bremen, Germany, with the contribution of Surrey Satellite Technology (SSTL) in Guildford, United Kingdom. When completed Batch-3 brings the total to 34 FOC satellites.

==== FOC launches ====
On 7 May 2014, the first two FOC satellites landed in Guyana for their joint launch planned in summer Originally planned for launch during 2013, problems tooling and establishing the production line for assembly led to a delay of a year in serial production of Galileo satellites. These two satellites (Galileo satellites GSAT-201 and GSAT-202) were launched on 22 August 2014. The names of these satellites are Doresa and Milena named after European children who had previously won a drawing contest. On 23 August 2014, launch service provider Arianespace announced that the flight VS09 experienced an anomaly and the satellites were injected into an incorrect orbit. They ended up in elliptical orbits and thus could not be used for navigation. However, it was later possible to use them to perform a physics experiment, so they were not a complete loss.

Satellites GSAT-203 (Adam) and GSAT-204 (Anastasia) were launched successfully on 27 March 2015 from Guiana Space Centre using a Soyuz four stage launcher.

Satellites GSAT-205 (Alba) and GSAT-206 (Oriana) were launched successfully on 11 September 2015 from Guiana Space Centre using a Soyuz four stage launcher.

Satellites GSAT-208 (Liene) and GSAT-209 (Andriana) were successfully launched from Kourou, French Guiana, using the Soyuz four stage launcher on 17 December 2015.

Satellites GSAT-210 (Daniele) and GSAT-211 (Alizée) were launched on 24 May 2016.

Starting in November 2016, deployment of the last twelve satellites will use a modified Ariane 5 launcher, named Ariane 5 ES, capable of placing four Galileo satellites into orbit per launch.

Satellites GSAT-207 (Antonianna), GSAT-212 (Lisa), GSAT-213 (Kimberley), GSAT-214 (Tijmen) were successfully launched from Kourou, French Guiana, on 17 November 2016 on an Ariane 5 ES.

On 15 December 2016, Galileo started offering Initial Operational Capability (IOC). The services currently offered are Open Service, Public Regulated Service and Search and Rescue Service.

The first Batch-2 satellites GSAT-215 (Nicole), GSAT-216 (Zofia), GSAT-217 (Alexandre), GSAT-218 (Irina) were successfully launched from Kourou, French Guiana, on 12 December 2017 on an Ariane 5 ES.

Satellites GSAT-219 (Tara), GSAT-220 (Samuel), GSAT-221 (Anna), GSAT-222 (Ellen) were successfully launched from Kourou, French Guiana, on 25 July 2018 on an Ariane 5 ES.

The first Batch-3 satellites GSAT-223 (Nikolina) and GSAT-224 (Shriya) were successfully launched from Kourou, French Guiana, on 5 December 2021 on a Soyuz four stage launcher.

Shriya successfully joined the constellation on 29 August 2022.

=== Second generation (G2G) satellites ===
During 2014, ESA and its industry partners began studies on Galileo Second Generation (G2G) satellites, which were to be presented to the EC for the late 2020s launch period. One idea was to employ electric propulsion, which would eliminate the need for an upper stage during launch and allow satellites from a single batch to be inserted into more than one orbital plane. The new generation satellites are expected to be available by 2025. and serve to augment the existing network. 

On 20 January 2021, the European Commission announced that it had awarded a €1.47 billion contract to Thales Alenia Space (TAS) and Airbus Defence and Space for 6 spacecraft by each manufacturer. The signing of the contracts to Thales Alenia Space and Airbus Defence and Space, scheduled on 29 January 2021, was suspended by the European Court of Justice following a protest filed by OHB SE, the losing bidder. The OHB protest at the ECJ&#x27;s General Court is based on “allegations of theft of trade secrets”, and seeks both a suspension of the contract signatures and the cancellation of the contract award. In May 2021 ESA reported it signed the contracts to design and build the first batch of Galileo Second Generation (G2G) satellites with Thales Alenia Space and Airbus Defence and Space. 

The 12 G2G satellites will feature a fully digital navigational payload, electric propulsion, enhanced navigation signals and capabilities, inter-satellite links and reconfigurability in space. The number of atomic clocks will increase from four to six. The satellites&#x27; increase in payloads will result in a mass of approximately 2300 kg. The design life is extended from 12 years to 15 years. 

== Applications and impact ==
=== Science projects using Galileo ===
In July 2006, an international consortium of universities and research institutions embarked on a study of potential scientific applications of the Galileo constellation. This project, named GEO6, is a broad study oriented to the general scientific community, aiming to define and implement new applications of Galileo.

Among the various GNSS users identified by the Galileo Joint Undertaking, the GEO6, project addresses the Scientific User Community (UC). The GEO6 project aims at fostering possible novel applications within the scientific UC of GNSS signals, and particularly of Galileo.

The AGILE project is an EU-funded project devoted to the study of the technical and commercial aspects of location-based services (LBS). It includes technical analysis of the benefits brought by Galileo (and EGNOS) and studies the hybridisation of Galileo with other positioning technologies (network-based, WLAN, etc.). Within these projects, some pilot prototypes were implemented and demonstrated.

On the basis of the potential number of users, potential revenues for Galileo Operating Company or Concessionaire (GOC), international relevance, and level of innovation, a set of Priority Applications (PA) will be selected by the consortium and developed within the time-frame of the same project.

These applications will help to increase and optimise the use of the EGNOS services and the opportunities offered by the Galileo Signal Test-Bed (GSTB-V2) and the Galileo (IOV) phase.

All Galileo satellites are equipped with laser retroreflector arrays which allow them to be tracked by the stations of the International Laser Ranging Service. Satellite laser ranging to Galileo satellites are used for the validation of satellite orbits, determination of Earth rotation parameters and for the combined solutions incorporating laser and microwave observations.

=== Receivers ===
All major GNSS receiver chips support Galileo and hundreds of end-user devices are compatible with Galileo. The first, dual-frequency-GNSS-capable Android devices, which track more than one radio signal from each satellite, E1 and E5a frequencies for Galileo, were the Huawei Mate 20 line, Xiaomi Mi 8, Xiaomi Mi 9 and Xiaomi Mi MIX 3. , there were more than 140 Galileo-enabled smartphones on the market of which 9 were dual-frequency enabled. An extensive list of enabled devices, for various uses, on land, sea and in air is frequently updated at the EU website. On 24 December 2018, the European Commission passed a mandate for all new smartphones to implement Galileo for E112 support.

Effective from 1st April 2018, all new vehicles sold in Europe must support eCall, an automatic emergency response system that dials 112 and transmits Galileo location data in the event of an accident.

Until late 2018, Galileo was not authorized for use in the United States and, as a consequence, only variably worked on devices that could receive Galileo signals within United States territory. The Federal Communications Commission&#x27;s (FCC) position on the matter was that non-GPS radio navigation satellite systems (RNSS) receivers must be granted a licence to receive said signals. A waiver of this requirement for Galileo was requested by the EU and submitted in 2015, and on 6 January 2017, public comment on the matter was requested. On 15 November 2018, the FCC granted the requested waiver, explicitly allowing non-federal consumer devices to access Galileo E1 and E5 frequencies. However, most devices, including smartphones, still require operating system updates or similar updates to allow the use of Galileo signals within the United States (most smartphones since the Apple iPhone 6S and Samsung Galaxy S7 have the hardware capability, and simply require a software modification).

=== Coins ===
The European Satellite Navigation project was selected as the main motif of a very high-value collectors&#x27; coin: the Austrian European Satellite Navigation commemorative coin, minted on 1 March 2006. The coin has a silver ring and gold-brown niobium &quot;pill&quot;. In the reverse, the niobium portion depicts navigation satellites orbiting the Earth. The ring shows different modes of transport, for which satellite navigation was developed: an aircraft, a car, a lorry, a train and a container ship.

<text>Gavrilo Princip (, ; 25 July 189428 April 1918) was a Bosnian Serb student who assassinated Archduke Franz Ferdinand, heir presumptive to the throne of Austria-Hungary, and his wife Sophie, Duchess von Hohenberg, in Sarajevo on 28 June 1914. The killing of the Archduke and his wife set off the July Crisis, a series of events that within one month led to the outbreak of World War I.

Princip was born in western Bosnia to a poor Serb family. At the age of 13, he was sent to Sarajevo, the capital of Austrian-occupied Bosnia, to study at the Merchants&#x27; School, before transferring to the gymnasium, where he became politically aware. In 1911, he joined Young Bosnia, a secret local society aiming to free Bosnia from Austrian rule and achieve the unification of the South Slavs. After attending anti-Austrian demonstrations in Sarajevo, he was expelled from school and walked to Belgrade, Serbia, to continue his education. During the First Balkan War, Princip traveled to Southern Serbia to volunteer with the Serbian army&#x27;s irregular forces fighting against the Ottoman Empire but was rejected for being too small and weak.

In 1913, following the unexpected success of the Serbians in the war against the Ottomans, the Austrian military governor of Bosnia, Oskar Potiorek, declared a state of emergency, dissolved the parliament, imposed martial rule, and banned all Serbian public, cultural, and educational societies. Inspired by a spate of assassination attempts against Imperial officials by Slavic nationalists and anarchists, Princip persuaded two other young Bosnians to join a plot to assassinate the heir to the Habsburg Empire during his announced visit to Sarajevo. The Black Hand, a Serbian secret society with ties to Serbian military intelligence, provided the conspirators with weapons and training before facilitating their re-entry into Bosnia.

On Sunday 28 June 1914, during the royal couple&#x27;s visit to Sarajevo, the then-teenager Princip mortally wounded both Franz Ferdinand and his wife Sophie by firing a pistol into their convertible car that had unexpectedly stopped from him. Princip was arrested immediately and tried alongside twenty-four others, all Bosnians and thus Austro-Hungarian subjects. At his trial, Princip stated: &quot;I am a Yugoslav nationalist, aiming for the unification of all Yugoslavs, and I do not care what form of state, but it must be free from Austria.&quot; Princip was spared the death penalty because of his age (19) and sentenced to twenty years in prison. He was imprisoned at the Terezín fortress. The Serbian government itself did not inspire the assassination but the Austrian Foreign Office and Army used the murders as a reason for a preventive war which led directly to World War I.

Princip died on 28 April 1918 from tuberculosis exacerbated by poor prison conditions which had already caused one of his arms to be amputated. His legacy is viewed as controversial; many Serbs regard him as a hero who stood against colonial oppression and slavery, while Bosniaks and Croats frequently view him as a terrorist.

== Early life ==
Gavrilo Princip was born on , in the remote hamlet of Obljaj, near Bosansko Grahovo, in western Bosnia. At the time of his birth, Bosnia was administered by Austria-Hungary, while still formally a province of the Ottoman Empire. He was the second of his parents&#x27; nine children, six of whom died in infancy. Princip&#x27;s mother Marija wanted to name him after her late brother, Špiro, but he was named Gavrilo at the insistence of a local Eastern Orthodox priest, who claimed that naming the sickly infant after the Archangel Gabriel would help him survive.

A Serb family, the Princips had lived in northwestern Bosnia for many centuries. Their ancestors came from Grahovo, Nikšić in Montenegro, emigrating in the early 1700s, they belonged to the Jovićević clan, and adhered to the Serbian Orthodox Christian faith. Princip&#x27;s parents, Petar and Marija (née Mićić), were poor farmers who lived off the meager land they owned. They were part of a class of Christian peasants known to the Ottomans as &quot;&quot; (serfs), and were often oppressed by their Muslim landlords. Petar, who insisted on &quot;strict correctness&quot;, never drank or swore and was mocked by his neighbours as a result. In his youth, he fought in the Herzegovina Uprising against the Ottoman Empire. After the revolt, he resumed farming in the Grahovo valley, cultivating around of land and was forced to give a third of his income to his landlord. To supplement his income and sustain his family, he resorted to transporting mail and passengers across the mountains connecting northwestern Bosnia and Dalmatia.

Despite his father&#x27;s initial objections, as he needed a shepherd to tend his sheep, Princip commenced primary school in 1903, at the age of nine. Despite facing challenges in his first year, he excelled in his studies, eventually receiving a collection of Serbian epic poetry from his headmaster in recognition of his academic success. At thirteen, Princip moved to Sarajevo, where his elder brother Jovan initially intended to enroll him at Sarajevo&#x27;s Austro-Hungarian Military Academy. By the time Princip reached Sarajevo, Jovan had changed his mind following advice from a shopkeeper, who cautioned against sending his younger brother to become &quot;an executioner of his own people.&quot; Instead, Princip was admitted to the Merchants&#x27; School, with Jovan financing his education through earnings from manual labor, such as transporting logs from the surrounding forests to mills in the city. After three years, Princip transferred to secondary school, the Sarajevo Gymnasium.

== Joining Young Bosnia ==
Following the annexation of the region by the Austro-Hungarian empire in 1908, Bosnia, like the other southern Slavic states under imperial rule, yearned for independence. As a result, various student groups emerged interested in movements such as romantic nationalism, nihilism, or anti imperialism, while at school and through his roommate Danilo Ilić, Princip was also exposed to socialist, anarchist, and communist writing. Princip started to associate with like-minded young nationalist revolutionaries and came to admire Bogdan Žerajić, a Bosnian Serb who had attempted to assassinate the Austro-Hungarian Governor of Bosnia and Herzegovina, before taking his own life. Žerajić, who was from Herzegovina like Princip, came to epitomize, in the eyes of many, the ideal of self sacrifice. On the anniversary of his death, Serb youths from Sarajevo started to visit his grave to lay flowers. According to Luigi Albertini, this is where, after spending nights reflecting at the grave, that Princip resolved to participate in his own attack. In 1911, Princip graduated from the fourth grade and joined Young Bosnia (), a society with members from all three major Bosnian ethnic groups, that sought the liberation of Bosnia from Austro-Hungarian rule and the unification of all Southern Slavs in a common nation. Some believed that the newly independent Kingdom of Serbia, as the free part of the south Slavs, was obligated to help unify the southern Slavic peoples. Because the local authorities had forbidden students to form organisations and clubs, Princip and other members of Young Bosnia met in secret. During their meetings, they discussed literature, ethics and politics.

On 18 February 1912, Princip took part in a demonstration against the Habsburg authority in Sarajevo, organised by Luka Jukić, a Croat student from Bosnia. The demonstrators burned a Hungarian flag and many were injured and arrested by the police. During the scuffle Princip was hit with a sabre and his clothes were torn. The following day the students declared a general strike, and for the first time in Bosnian history, Croats, Serbs and Muslims took part together. A student present that day claimed that &quot;Princip went from class to class, threatening with his knuckle-duster all the boys who wavered in coming to the new demonstrations.&quot; As a result of his conduct and his involvement in the demonstrations against Austro-Hungarian authorities, Princip was expelled from school and in the spring of 1912 decided to go to Belgrade, making the 280-kilometre (170 mi) journey on foot. According to one account, he fell to his knees and kissed the ground upon crossing the border into Serbia. Having left Sarajevo without telling his brother, Princip lived without money and in difficult conditions alongside other Bosnian students. In June 1912, he went to the First Belgrade Gymnasium to take the fifth grade exam which he failed.

When war broke out between the Balkan states and Turkey in October 1912, Princip went to a recruitment office in Belgrade to volunteer his service with the , the irregular Serbian units. Upon being rejected because of his small build, he traveled to a different recruitment office this time in Prokuplje, north of the Turkish frontier in southern Serbia. After taking one look at him, Major Vojislav Tankosić, the commander of all Komite units, rejected him for being too small and looking too weak. Humiliated, Princip returned first briefly to Belgrade then back to the village of Hadžići. According to Vladimir Dedijer, his failure to be accepted in the army on the account that he looked weak, was one of the primary motives which pushed Princip to do something exceptionally brave. In the South Slav lands, the unexpected success of the Serbian army resulted in numerous celebrations and demonstrations of support. In reaction on 2 May 1913, while Princip was in Sarajevo, the Austro-Hungarian Governor of Bosnia and Herzegovina General Potiorek declared a state of emergency, suspended the 1910 constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina, implemented martial law, seized control of all schools, and prohibited all Serb public, cultural, and educational societies.

In the summer of 1913 Princip passed the fifth and sixth grades of high school, then in early 1914 he left Sarajevo for Belgrade, stopping briefly in his village to see his parents. While in Belgrade preparing for his sixth-class examinations in the First Belgrade High School, Princip was shown by his friend Nedeljko Čabrinović a newspaper cutting announcing Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria&#x27;s visit to Bosnia in June. Princip decided to lead a group of assassins back to Bosnia and attack the Archduke during his official visit to Sarajevo. He convinced Čabrinović and his old schoolfriend Trifko Grabež to join the plot. They also talked about killing Oskar Potiorek, the provincial governor, as a means of protest against the emergency régime. To find weapons, Princip asked his Bosnian Muslim friend, Djulaga Bukovac, a veteran of the Balkan wars. Bukovac introduced them to Milan Ciganović, another Bosnian expatriate who had fought under Major Tankosić during the Second Balkan War. Ciganović was also a freemason and an associate of the Black Hand, the secretive, ultra-nationalist Serbian group responsible for the regicide of 1903. Ciganović then approached Tankosić, another Black Hand member of Bosnian descent, from whom he obtained the weapons. 

On 27 May 1914, Ciganović supplied the three young Bosnians with five Browning pistols, six grenades, and several vials of poison. Ciganović took the would-be assassins to Topčider forest, just outside the centre of Belgrade, training them on how to use the weapons. Princip proved to be the best marksman. The three-man assassination team left Belgrade on 28 May 1914, taking a river boat that took them to Šabac, they then split up crossing separately the border into Bosnia. Each of them was carrying two bombs tied around their waist as well as pistols, ammunition and a bottle of cyanide in their pockets. Before leaving Serbia, Princip wrote to his former roommate in Sarajevo Danilo Ilić, to notify him of his assassination plan and to ask him to recruit more people. Ilić recruited Muhamed Mehmedbašić, a Bosnian Muslim carpenter, Cvetko Popović, and Vaso Čubrilović, both Bosnian Serb students aged eighteen and seventeen.

== Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand ==

Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria and his wife, Duchess Sophie Chotek, arrived in Sarajevo by train shortly before 10 a.m. on 28 June 1914. Their car was the third in a six-car motorcade heading towards Sarajevo Town Hall.

Princip and five other conspirators were positioned along the route, spaced out along the Appel Quay, each instructed to assassinate the Archduke when the royal car reached their position. The first conspirator, Muhamed Mehmedbašić, stood near the Austro-Hungarian Bank but lost his nerve and allowed the car to pass without acting. At 10:15 am, as the motorcade passed the central police station, 19-year-old student Nedeljko Čabrinović hurled a hand grenade at the Archduke&#x27;s car. The driver accelerated upon seeing the grenade, which had a 10-second delay, and the bomb exploded under the fourth car, seriously wounding two occupants. Following this failed attempt, the motorcade sped away, and the remaining conspirators, including Princip, were unable to act due to the high speed of the vehicles.

After delivering his scheduled speech at Town Hall, the Archduke decided to visit the victims of Čabrinović&#x27;s grenade attack at the Sarajevo Hospital. To avoid the city centre, General Oskar Potiorek directed the royal car to travel straight along the Appel Quay to the hospital. However, Potiorek failed to inform the driver, Leopold Lojka, a Czech, about this change. On the way to the hospital, Lojka, following the original plan, turned onto a side street where Princip happened to be standing in front of a delicatessen. After Potiorek shouted at him to stop, Lojka halted the car and began reversing. As he did so, the engine stalled, and the gears locked. Princip stepped forward, drew an FN Model 1910 semi-automatic pistol, and fired twice at close range into the car. The first bullet struck the Archduke in the neck, while the second hit the Duchess in the abdomen. Both died shortly afterward.

On 13 July 1914, Austro-Hungarian official Friedrich Wiesner submitted a report concluding that there was no evidence to implicate the Serbian government in the conspiracy behind the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand and his wife in Sarajevo. This assessment, communicated to Vienna, confirmed that the Serbian state had not been involved in the plot. Despite this, the Austro-Hungarian government, perceiving Serbia&#x27;s nationalist ambitions as a direct threat to the stability of its multi-ethnic empire, seized upon the assassination as a pretext for action against Serbia. 

This pivotal event set off the July Crisis, a rapid sequence of diplomatic and military escalations among Europe&#x27;s great powers. Tensions reached a breaking point on 28 July 1914, when Austria-Hungary declared war on Serbia. Within days, the conflict expanded as Germany, France, Russia, and Great Britain issued their own declarations of war, plunging Europe into the First World War. Samuel Williamson, a preeminent authority on Austria-Hungary and its role in the lead-up to the war, asserts that Vienna&#x27;s unwavering determination to exploit the assassination to subjugate Serbia and assert dominance over the Balkans was the principal driving force behind the outbreak of the global conflict.

== Arrest and trial ==
Before Princip could fire for a third time, the pistol was wrested from his hand and he was pushed to the ground. He managed to swallow a capsule of cyanide, which failed to kill him. The trial opened on 12 October and lasted until 23 October 1914. Princip and twenty-four people were indicted. All six assassins, except Mehmedbašić, were under twenty at the time of the assassination, while the group was dominated by Bosnian Serbs, four of the indicted were Bosnian Croats and all of them were Austro-Hungarian citizens, none being from Serbia. The state&#x27;s attorney charged twenty-two of the accused with high treason and murder and three with complicity in the murder. Princip stated that he regretted the killing of the Duchess and meant to kill Potiorek, but was nonetheless proud of what he had done. The Austrian police investigators were eager to emphasise the exclusively Serbian nature of the assassination plot for political reasons, but during his trial Princip insisted that, even though he was an ethnic Serb, his commitment was to freeing all south Slavs. All the chief conspirators mentioned the revolutionary destruction of Austria-Hungary and the liberation of the South Slavs as the motivation behind their act.

The Austro-Hungarian authorities tried to hide the fact that the conspirators included Croats and Bosniaks, going as far as changing the name of one of them in the press reports, to portray the entire scheme as being of Serbian origin and carried out only by Serbs. Since it provided the weapons to the assassins and helped them cross the border, the Black Hand was implicated in the assassination. This did not prove that the Serbian government knew about the assassination, let alone approved of it, but was enough for Austria-Hungary to issue a démarche to Serbia known as the July Ultimatum, which led up to the outbreak of World War I. According to David Fromkin what the killings gave Vienna was not a reason, but an excuse, for destroying Serbia.

Princip was nineteen years old at the time and too young to be executed, as he was twenty-seven days shy of the twenty-year minimum age limit required by Habsburg law. On Thursday 28 October 1914 the court found Princip guilty of murder and high treason, he received the maximum sentence of twenty years in prison, he was to serve out his sentence in a military prison within the Habsburg fortress of Theresienstadt in northern Bohemia (now in the Czech Republic).

== Imprisonment and death ==

Princip was chained to a wall in solitary confinement at the Small Fortress in Terezín, where he lived in harsh conditions and developed tuberculosis. From February to June 1916, Princip met four times with Martin Pappenheim, a psychiatrist in the Austro-Hungarian army. Pappenheim wrote that Princip asserted that the First World War would have occurred even if the assassination had not taken place, and that he &quot;cannot feel himself responsible for the catastrophe&quot;.

Princip died on 28 April 1918, three years and ten months after the assassination. At the time of his death, weakened by malnutrition and disease, he weighed around .

== Legacy ==

Long after his death, Princip&#x27;s legacy is still disputed, and he remains a historically significant but polarising figure. For the Habsburg monarchy and its supporters, he was a murderous terrorist; the Kingdom of Yugoslavia portrayed him as a Yugoslav hero; during World War II, Nazis and Croatian fascist Ustaše viewed him as a degenerate criminal and a left-wing anarchist; and for socialist Yugoslavia, he represented a youthful hero of armed resistance, a freedom fighter who fought to liberate all the peoples of Yugoslavia from Imperial rule, fighting for the workers and the oppressed. In 1920 Princip and the other conspirators were exhumed and brought to Sarajevo, where they were buried together beneath the Vidovdan Heroes Chapel. In the 1990s, Princip started to be seen by some as a Serbian nationalist acting for the creation of a Greater Serbia. Political movements and regimes have either praised or demonized him to promote their ideology.

Today he is still celebrated as a hero by numerous Serbs and regarded as a terrorist by many Croats and Bosniaks. Asim Sarajlić, a senior MP of the Bosniak nationalist Party of Democratic Action, stated in 2014 that Princip brought an end to &quot;a golden era of history under Austrian rule&quot; and that &quot;we are strongly against the mythology of Princip as a fighter of freedom&quot;. Many of Bosnia&#x27;s Serbs continue to venerate his memory: Nenad Samardžija, the Serb governor of East Sarajevo, said in 2014 that &quot;we once all lived in one state (Yugoslavia), and we never looked on it as any kind of terrorist act&quot; but &quot;a movement of young people who wanted to liberate themselves from colonial slavery&quot;.

=== Memorials and commemoration ===

The house where Princip lived in Sarajevo was destroyed during World War I. After the war, it was rebuilt as a museum in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. Yugoslavia was conquered by Germany in 1941 and Sarajevo became part of the Independent State of Croatia. The Croatian Ustaše destroyed the house again. After the establishment of Communist Yugoslavia in 1944, the house was rebuilt, became a museum again, and there was another museum dedicated to him within the city of Sarajevo. During the Yugoslav Wars of the 1990s, the house was destroyed again and then rebuilt for the third time in 2015.

Princip&#x27;s pistol was confiscated by the authorities and eventually given, along with the Archduke&#x27;s blood-stained undershirt, to , a Jesuit priest who was a close friend of the Archduke and had given the Archduke and his wife their last rites. The pistol and shirt remained in the possession of the Austrian Jesuits until they were offered on long-term loan to the Museum of Military History in Vienna in 2004. It is now part of the permanent exhibition there. During the Yugoslavian era, Latin Bridge, the site of the assassination, was renamed &quot;Princip&#x27;s Bridge&quot; in remembrance; it reverted to its old name in 1992. In Sarajevo about a half-dozen memorials to Gavrilo Princip have been erected on the site and torn down with each change in power.

In 1917, a pillar was constructed at the corner of where the assassination took place. It was destroyed the following year. In 1941, the 1930 plaque commemorating Princip was removed by the local Germans when the German Army invaded. It was presented to Adolf Hitler as a birthday gift and kept in a museum, only to be lost after 1945. After World War II, a new plaque went up which claimed that &quot;Gavrilo Princip threw off the German occupiers&quot;. During the Bosnian War, embossed footprints marking where Princip fired the fatal shots were torn out.

As the centenary of the assassination neared, an apolitical plaque was put up at the corner where the assassination took place, which states: &quot;From this place on 28 June 1914, Gavrilo Princip assassinated the heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne Franz Ferdinand and his wife Sofia.&quot; On 21 April 2014, a bust of Princip was unveiled in Tovariševo, and on the centenary itself, a statue was erected in East Sarajevo. A year later, a statue of Princip was unveiled in Belgrade by the President of Serbia Tomislav Nikolić and the President of Republika Srpska Milorad Dodik, as a gift from Republika Srpska to Serbia. At the unveiling Nikolić gave a speech, saying in part: &quot;Princip was a hero, a symbol of liberation ideas, tyrant-killer, idea-holder of liberation from slavery, which spanned through Europe&quot;.

On 11 November 2018, the 100th anniversary of the end of World War I, Princess Anita of Hohenberg, the eldest great-grandchild of Archduke Franz Ferdinand, and Branislav Princip, grandnephew of Gavrilo Princip, shook hands in a symbolic act of reconciliation in Graz, Austria.

<doc id="13011" wikidata="Q205380" url="?curid=13011" title="Greenwich Village">
<text>Greenwich Village, or simply the Village, is a neighborhood on the west side of Lower Manhattan in New York City, bounded by 14th Street to the north, Broadway to the east, Houston Street to the south, and the Hudson River to the west. Greenwich Village also contains several subsections, including the West Village west of Seventh Avenue and the Meatpacking District in the northwest corner of Greenwich Village.

Its name comes from &quot;Groenwijck&quot;, Dutch for &quot;Green District&quot;. In the 20th century, Greenwich Village was known as an artists&#x27; haven, the bohemian capital, the cradle of the modern LGBTQ movement, and the East Coast birthplace of both the Beat Generation and counterculture of the 1960s. Greenwich Village contains Washington Square Park, as well as two of New York City&#x27;s private colleges, New York University (NYU) and The New School. In later years it has been associated with hipsters.

Greenwich Village is part of Manhattan Community District 2, and is patrolled by the 6th Precinct of the New York City Police Department. Greenwich Village has undergone extensive gentrification and commercialization; the four ZIP Codes that constitute the Village – 10011, 10012, 10003, and 10014 – were all ranked among the ten most expensive in the United States by median housing prices in 2014, according to &quot;Forbes&quot;, with residential property sale prices in the West Village neighborhood typically exceeding US in 2017.

==Geography==
===Boundaries===

The neighborhood is bordered by Broadway to the east, the North River (part of the Hudson River) to the west, Houston Street to the south, and 14th Street to the north. It is roughly centered on Washington Square Park and New York University. Adjacent to Greenwich Village are the neighborhoods of NoHo and the East Village to the east, SoHo and Hudson Square to the south, and Chelsea and Union Square to the north. The East Village was formerly considered part of the Lower East Side and has never been considered a part of Greenwich Village. The western part of Greenwich Village is known as the West Village; the dividing line of its eastern border is debated but commonly cited as Seventh Avenue or Sixth Avenue. The Far West Village is another sub-neighborhood of Greenwich Village that is bordered on its west by the Hudson River and on its east by Hudson Street.

Into the early 20th century, Greenwich Village was distinguished from the upper-class neighborhood of Washington Square—based on the major landmark of Washington Square Park or Empire Ward in the 19th century.

&quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot;&#x27;s 1956 article on &quot;New York (City)&quot; states (under the subheading &quot;Greenwich Village&quot;) that the southern border of the Village is Spring Street, reflecting an earlier understanding. Today, Spring Street overlaps with the modern, newer SoHo neighborhood designation, while the modern &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; cites the southern border as Houston Street.

===Grid plan===

As Greenwich Village was once a rural, isolated hamlet to the north of the 17th century European settlement on Manhattan Island, its street layout is more organic than the planned grid pattern of the 19th century grid plan (based on the Commissioners&#x27; Plan of 1811). Greenwich Village was allowed to keep the 18th century street pattern of what is now called the West Village: areas that were already built up when the plan was implemented, west of what is now Greenwich Avenue and Sixth Avenue, resulted in a neighborhood whose streets are dramatically different, in layout, from the ordered structure of the newer parts of Manhattan.

Many of the neighborhood&#x27;s streets are narrow and some curve at odd angles. This is generally regarded as adding to both the historic character and charm of the neighborhood. In addition, as the meandering Greenwich Street used to be on the Hudson River shoreline, much of the neighborhood west of Greenwich Street is on landfill, but still follows the older street grid. When Sixth and Seventh Avenues were extended in the early 20th century, they were built diagonally to the existing street plan, and many older, smaller streets had to be demolished.

Unlike the streets of most of Manhattan above Houston Street, streets in the Village are typically named, not numbered. While some of the formerly named streets (including Factory, Herring and Amity Streets) are now numbered, they still do not always conform to the usual grid pattern when they enter the neighborhood. For example, West 4th Street runs east–west across most of Manhattan, but runs north–south in Greenwich Village, causing it to intersect with West 10th, 11th, and 12th Streets before ending at West 13th Street.

A large section of Greenwich Village, made up of more than 50 northern and western blocks in the area up to 14th Street, is part of a Historic District established by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission. The District&#x27;s convoluted borders run no farther south than 4th Street or St. Luke&#x27;s Place, and no farther east than Washington Square East or University Place. Redevelopment in that area is severely restricted, and developers must preserve the main façade and aesthetics of the buildings during renovation.

Most of the buildings of Greenwich Village are mid-rise apartments, 19th century row houses, and the occasional one-family walk-up, a sharp contrast to the high-rise landscape in Midtown and Downtown Manhattan.

===Political representation===

Politically, Greenwich Village is in New York&#x27;s 10th congressional district. It is also in the New York State Senate&#x27;s 25th district, the New York State Assembly&#x27;s 66th district, and the New York City Council&#x27;s 3rd district.

==History==
===Early years===

In the 16th century, Lenape referred to its farthest northwest corner, by the cove on the Hudson River at present-day Gansevoort Street, as Sapokanikan (&quot;tobacco field&quot;). The land was cleared and turned into pasture by the Dutch and their enslaved Africans, who named their settlement (also spelled , &quot;North district&quot;, equivalent to &#x27;North/Northwick&#x27;). In the 1630s, Governor Wouter van Twiller farmed tobacco on here at his &quot;Farm in the Woods&quot;. The English conquered the Dutch settlement of New Netherland in 1664, and Greenwich Village developed as a hamlet separate from the larger New York City to the south on land that would eventually become the Financial District. In 1644, the eleven Dutch African settlers in the area were granted half freedoms after the first Black legal protest in America. All received parcels of land in what is now Greenwich Village, in an area that became known as the Land of the Blacks.

The earliest known reference to the village&#x27;s name as &quot;Greenwich&quot; dates back to 1696, in the will of Yellis Mandeville of Greenwich; however, the village was not mentioned in the city records until 1713. Sir Peter Warren began accumulating land in 1731 and built a frame house capacious enough to hold sittings of the New York General Assembly when smallpox rendered the city dangerous in 1739 and subsequent years; on one occasion in 1746, the house of Mordecai Gomez was used. Warren&#x27;s house, which survived until the Civil War era, overlooked the North River from a bluff; its site on the block bounded by Perry and Charles Streets, Bleecker and West 4th Streets, can still be recognized by its mid-19th century rowhouses inserted into a neighborhood still retaining many houses of the 1830–37 boom.

====Newgate Prison====
From 1797 until 1829, the bucolic village of Greenwich was the location of New York State&#x27;s first penitentiary, Newgate Prison, on the Hudson River at what is now West 10th Street, near the Christopher Street pier. The building was designed by Joseph-François Mangin, who would later co-design New York City Hall. Although the intention of its first warden, Quaker prison reformer Thomas Eddy, was to provide a rational and humanitarian place for retribution and rehabilitation, the prison soon became an overcrowded and pestilent place, subject to frequent riots by the prisoners which damaged the buildings and killed some inmates. By 1821, the prison, designed for 432 inmates, held 817 instead, a number made possible only by the frequent release of prisoners, sometimes as many as 50 a day. Since the prison was north of the New York City boundary at the time, being sentenced to Newgate became known as being &quot;sent up the river&quot;. This term became popularized once prisoners started being sentenced to Sing Sing Prison, in the town of Ossining upstream of New York City.

====Isaacs-Hendricks House====

The oldest house remaining in Greenwich Village is the Isaacs-Hendricks House, at 77 Bedford Street (built 1799, much altered and enlarged 1836, third story 1928). When the Church of St. Luke in the Fields was founded in 1820, it stood in fields south of the road (now Christopher Street) that led from Greenwich Lane (now Greenwich Avenue) down to a landing on the North River. In 1822, a yellow fever epidemic in New York encouraged residents to flee to the healthier air of Greenwich Village, and afterwards many stayed. The future site of Washington Square was a potter&#x27;s field from 1797 to 1823 when up to 20,000 of New York&#x27;s poor were buried here, and still remain. The handsome Greek revival rowhouses on the north side of Washington Square were built about 1832, establishing the fashion of Washington Square and lower Fifth Avenue for decades to come. Well into the 19th century, the district of Washington Square was considered separate from Greenwich Village.

In 1825, the &quot;Commercial Advertiser&quot; was writing that &quot;Greenwich is no longer a country village. Such has been the growth of our city that the building of one block more will connect the two places&quot; of Greenwich and New York. By 1850, the city had developed entirely around Greenwich Village such that the two were no longer considered separate.

===Reputation as urban bohemia===
Greenwich Village historically was known as an important landmark on the map of American bohemian culture in the early and mid-20th century. The neighborhood was known for its colorful, artistic residents and the alternative culture they propagated. Due in part to the progressive attitudes of many of its residents, the Village was a focal point of new movements and ideas, whether political, artistic, or cultural. This tradition as an enclave of avant-garde and alternative culture was established during the 19th century and continued into the 20th century, when small presses, art galleries, and experimental theater thrived. In 1969, enraged members of the gay community, in search for equality, started the Stonewall riots. The Stonewall Inn was later recognized as a National Historic Landmark for having been the location where the gay rights movement originated. On June 27, 2019, the National LGBTQ Wall of Honor was inaugurated at the Stonewall Inn; and on June 28, 2024, the Stonewall National Monument Visitors Center opened, as the first official national visitors center dedicated to the LGBTQ+ experience to open anywhere in the world. Numerous politicians and celebrities participated in the inauguration ceremonies, and the New York City Subway&#x27;s Christopher Street–Sheridan Square station was renamed the Christopher Street–Stonewall station on the same day.

The Tenth Street Studio Building was situated at 51 West 10th Street, between Fifth and Sixth Avenues. The building was commissioned by James Boorman Johnston and designed by Richard Morris Hunt. Its innovative design soon represented a national architectural prototype, and featured a domed central gallery, from which interconnected rooms radiated. Hunt&#x27;s studio within the building housed the first architectural school in the United States. Soon after its completion in 1857, the building helped to make Greenwich Village central to the arts in New York City, drawing artists from all over the country to work, exhibit, and sell their art. In its initial years Winslow Homer took a studio there, as did Edward Lamson Henry, and many of the artists of the Hudson River School, including Frederic Church and Albert Bierstadt.

From the late 19th century until the present, the Hotel Albert has served as a cultural icon of Greenwich Village. Opened during the 1880s and originally located at 11th Street and University Place, called the Hotel St. Stephan and then, after 1902, called the Hotel Albert while under the ownership of William Ryder, it served as a meeting place, restaurant and dwelling for several important artists and writers from the late 19th century well into the 20th century. After 1902, the owner&#x27;s brother Albert Pinkham Ryder lived and painted there. Some other noted guests who lived there include: Augustus St. Gaudens, Robert Louis Stevenson, Mark Twain, Hart Crane, Walt Whitman, Anaïs Nin, Thomas Wolfe, Robert Lowell, Horton Foote, Salvador Dalí, Philip Guston, Jackson Pollock, and Andy Warhol. During the golden age of bohemianism, Greenwich Village became famous for such eccentrics as Joe Gould (profiled at length by Joseph Mitchell) and Maxwell Bodenheim, dancer Isadora Duncan, writer William Faulkner, and playwright Eugene O&#x27;Neill. Political rebellion also made its home here, whether serious (John Reed) or frivolous (Marcel Duchamp and friends set off balloons from atop Washington Square Arch, proclaiming the founding of &quot;The Independent Republic of Greenwich Village&quot; on January 24, 1917).

In 1924, the Cherry Lane Theatre was established. Located at 38 Commerce Street, it is New York City&#x27;s oldest continuously running Off-Broadway theater. A landmark in Greenwich Village&#x27;s cultural landscape, it was built as a farm silo in 1817, and also served as a tobacco warehouse and box factory before Edna St. Vincent Millay and other members of the Provincetown Players converted the structure into a theatre they christened the Cherry Lane Playhouse, which opened on March 24, 1924, with the play &quot;The Man Who Ate the Popomack&quot;. During the 1940s The Living Theatre, Theatre of the Absurd, and the Downtown Theater movement all took root there, and it developed a reputation as a showcase for aspiring playwrights and emerging voices.

In one of the many Manhattan properties that Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney and her husband owned, Gertrude Whitney established the &quot;Whitney Studio Club&quot; at 8 West 8th Street in 1914, as a facility where young artists could exhibit their works. By the 1930s it had evolved into her greatest legacy, the Whitney Museum of American Art, on the site of today&#x27;s New York Studio School of Drawing, Painting and Sculpture. The Whitney was founded in 1931, as an answer to the Museum of Modern Art, founded 1928, and its collection of mostly European modernism and its neglect of American Art. Gertrude Whitney decided to put the time and money into the museum after the New York Metropolitan Museum of Art turned down her offer to contribute her twenty-five-year collection of modern art works. In 1936, the renowned Abstract Expressionist artist and teacher Hans Hofmann moved his art school from East 57th Street to 52 West 9th Street. In 1938, Hofmann moved again to a more permanent home at 52 West 8th Street. The school remained active until 1958, when Hofmann retired from teaching.

On January 8, 1947, stevedore Andy Hintz was fatally shot by hitmen John M. Dunn, Andrew Sheridan, and Danny Gentile in front of his apartment. Before he died on January 29, he told his wife that &quot;Johnny Dunn shot me.&quot; The three gunmen were immediately arrested. Sheridan and Dunn were executed.

The Village hosted the nation&#x27;s first racially integrated nightclub, when Café Society was opened in 1938 at 1 Sheridan Square by Barney Josephson. Café Society showcased African American talent and was intended to be an American version of the political cabarets that Josephson had seen in Europe before World War I. Notable performers there included: Pearl Bailey, Count Basie, Nat King Cole, John Coltrane, Miles Davis, Ella Fitzgerald, Coleman Hawkins, Billie Holiday, Lena Horne, Burl Ives, Lead Belly, Anita O&#x27;Day, Charlie Parker, Les Paul and Mary Ford, Paul Robeson, Kay Starr, Art Tatum, Sarah Vaughan, Dinah Washington, Josh White, Teddy Wilson, Lester Young, and the Weavers, who also in Christmas 1949, played at the Village Vanguard.

The annual Greenwich Village Halloween Parade, initiated in 1974 by Greenwich Village puppeteer and mask maker Ralph Lee, is the world&#x27;s largest Halloween parade and America&#x27;s only major Halloween nighttime parade, attracting more than 60,000 costumed participants, two million in-person spectators, and a worldwide television audience of over 100 million. The parade has its roots in New York&#x27;s queer community.

===Postwar===

Greenwich Village again became important to the bohemian scene during the 1950s, when the Beat Generation focused its energies there. Fleeing from what they saw as oppressive social conformity, a loose collection of writers, poets, artists, and students (later known as the Beats) and the Beatniks, moved to Greenwich Village, and to North Beach in San Francisco, in many ways creating the U.S. East Coast and West Coast predecessors, respectively, to the East Village-Haight Ashbury hippie scene of the next decade. The Village (and surrounding New York City) would later play central roles in the writings of, among others, Maya Angelou, James Baldwin, William S. Burroughs, Truman Capote, Allen Ginsberg, Jack Kerouac, Rod McKuen, Marianne Moore, and Dylan Thomas, who collapsed at the Chelsea Hotel, and died at St. Vincents Hospital at 170 West 12th Street, in the Village after drinking at the White Horse Tavern on November 5, 1953.

Off-Off-Broadway began in Greenwich Village in 1958 as a reaction to Off Broadway, and a &quot;complete rejection of commercial theatre&quot;. Among the first venues for what would soon be called &quot;Off-Off-Broadway&quot; (a term supposedly coined by critic Jerry Tallmer of the &quot;Village Voice&quot;) were coffeehouses in Greenwich Village, in particular, the Caffe Cino at 31 Cornelia Street, operated by the eccentric Joe Cino, who early on took a liking to actors and playwrights and agreed to let them stage plays there without bothering to read the plays first, or to even find out much about the content. Also integral to the rise of Off-Off-Broadway were Ellen Stewart at La MaMa, originally located at 321 E. 9th Street, and Al Carmines at the Judson Poets&#x27; Theater, located at Judson Memorial Church on the south side of Washington Square Park.
The Village had a cutting-edge cabaret and music scene. &quot;The Village Gate&quot;, the &quot;Village Vanguard&quot;, and the &quot;Blue Note&quot; (since 1981) regularly hosted some of the biggest names in jazz. Greenwich Village also played a major role in the development of the folk music scene of the 1960s. Music clubs included &quot;Gerde&#x27;s Folk City&quot;, &quot;The Bitter End,&quot; &quot;Cafe Au Go Go&quot;, &quot;Cafe Wha?&quot;, &quot;The Gaslight Cafe&quot; and &quot;The Bottom Line&quot;. Three of the four members of the Mamas &amp; the Papas met there. Guitarist and folk singer Dave Van Ronk lived there for many years. Village resident and cultural icon Bob Dylan by the mid-60s had become one of the world&#x27;s foremost popular songwriters, and often developments in Greenwich Village would influence the simultaneously occurring folk rock movement in San Francisco and elsewhere, and vice versa. Dozens of other cultural and popular icons got their start in the Village&#x27;s nightclub, theater, and coffeehouse scene during the 1950s, 1960s, and early 1970s. Many artists garnered critical acclaim, some before and some after, performed in the Village. This list includes Eric Andersen, Joan Baez, Jackson Browne, the Clancy Brothers and Tommy Makem, Richie Havens, Jimi Hendrix, Janis Ian, the Kingston Trio, the Lovin&#x27; Spoonful, Bette Midler, Liza Minnelli, Joni Mitchell, Maria Muldaur, Laura Nyro, Phil Ochs, Tom Paxton, Peter, Paul, and Mary, Carly Simon, Simon &amp; Garfunkel, Nina Simone, Barbra Streisand, James Taylor, and the Velvet Underground. The Greenwich Village of the 1950s and 1960s was at the center of Jane Jacobs&#x27;s book &quot;The Death and Life of Great American Cities&quot;, which defended it and similar communities, while criticizing common urban renewal policies of the time.

Founded by New York-based artist Mercedes Matter and her students, the New York Studio School of Drawing, Painting and Sculpture is an art school formed in the mid-1960s in the Village. Officially opened September 23, 1964, the school is still active, at 8 W. 8th Street, the site of the original Whitney Museum of American Art.

Greenwich Village was home to a safe house used by the radical anti-war movement known as the Weather Underground. On March 6, 1970, their safehouse was destroyed when an explosive device they were constructing was accidentally detonated, killing three of their members (Ted Gold, Terry Robbins, and Diana Oughton).

The Village has been a center for movements that challenged the wider American culture, most notably its seminal role in sparking the gay liberation movement. The Stonewall riots were a series of spontaneous, violent protests by members of the gay community against a police raid that took place in the early morning hours of June 28, 1969, at the Stonewall Inn, 53 Christopher Street. Considered together, the demonstrations are widely considered to constitute the single most important event leading to the gay liberation movement and the modern fight for LGBTQ rights in the United States. On June 23, 2015, the Stonewall Inn was the first landmark in New York City to be recognized by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission on the basis of its status in LGBTQ history, and on June 24, 2016, the Stonewall National Monument was named the first U.S. National Monument dedicated to the LGBTQ-rights movement. Greenwich Village contains the world&#x27;s oldest gay and lesbian bookstore, Oscar Wilde Bookshop, founded in 1967, while The Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual &amp; Transgender Community Center – best known as simply &quot;The Center&quot; – has occupied the former Food &amp; Maritime Trades High School at 208 West 13th Street since 1984. In 2006, the Village was the scene of an assault involving seven lesbians and a straight man that sparked appreciable media attention, with strong statements defending both sides of the case. 
On June 20, 2023, the intersection of Fifth Avenue and Washington Square North was officially renamed Edie Windsor and Thea Speyer Way at the state level by New York Governor Kathy Hochul, in honor of the Greenwich Village plaintiffs who prevailed at the United States Supreme Court in 2013, in finding the Defense of Marriage Act, which had limited the definition of marriage as being valid strictly between one man and one woman, to be unconstitutional.

===Preservation===

Since the end of the 20th century, many artists and local historians have mourned the fact that the bohemian days of Greenwich Village are long gone, because of the extraordinarily high housing costs in the neighborhood. The artists fled to other New York City neighborhoods including SoHo, Tribeca, Dumbo, Williamsburg, and Long Island City. Nevertheless, residents of Greenwich Village still possess a strong community identity and are proud of their neighborhood&#x27;s unique history and fame, and its well-known liberal live-and-let-live attitudes.

Historically, local residents and preservation groups have been concerned about development in the Village and have fought to preserve its architectural and historic integrity. In the 1960s, Margot Gayle led a group of citizens to preserve the Jefferson Market Courthouse (later reused as Jefferson Market Library), while other citizen groups fought to keep traffic out of Washington Square Park, and Jane Jacobs, using the Village as an example of a vibrant urban community, advocated to keep it that way.

Since then, preservation has been a part of the Village ethos. Shortly after the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission (LPC) was established in 1965, it acted to protect parts of Greenwich Village, designating the small Charlton-King-Vandam Historic District in 1966, which contains the city&#x27;s largest concentration of row houses in the Federal style, as well as a significant concentration of Greek Revival houses, and the even smaller MacDougal-Sullivan Gardens Historic District in 1967, a group of 22 houses sharing a common back garden, built in the Greek Revival style and later renovated with Colonial Revival façades. In 1969, the LPC designated the Greenwich Village Historic District – which remained the city&#x27;s largest for four decades – despite preservationists&#x27; advocacy for the entire neighborhood to be designated an historic district. Advocates continued to pursue their goal of additional designation, spurred in particular by the increased pace of development in the 1990s.

====Rezoned areas====

The Greenwich Village Society for Historic Preservation (GVSHP), a nonprofit organization dedicated to the architectural and cultural character and heritage of the neighborhood, successfully proposed new districts and individual landmarks to the LPC. Those include:
* Gansevoort Market Historic District was the first new historic district in Greenwich Village in 34 years. The 112 buildings on 11 blocks protect the city&#x27;s distinctive Meatpacking District with its cobblestone streets, warehouses and rowhouses. About 70 percent of the area proposed by GVSHP in 2000 was designated a historic district by the LPC in 2003, while the entire area was listed on the State and National Registers of Historic Places in 2007.
* Weehawken Street Historic District, designated in 2006, is a 14-building, three-block district near the Hudson River centering on tiny Weehawken Street and containing an array of architecture including a sailors&#x27; hotel, former stables, and a wooden house.
* Greenwich Village Historic District Extension I, designated in 2006, brought 46 more buildings on three blocks into the district, thus protecting warehouses, a former public school and police station, and early 19th century rowhouses. Both the Weehawken Street Historic District and the Greenwich Village Historic District Extension I were designated by the LPC in response to the larger proposal for a Far West Village Historic District submitted by GVSHP in 2004.
* Greenwich Village Historic District Extension II, designated in 2010, embracing 225 buildings on 12 blocks, contains 19th century houses, 19th and 20th century tenements, and a variety of cultural landmarks.
* South Village Historic District, designated in 2013, covers 235 buildings on 13 blocks, representing the largest single expansion of landmark protections in Greenwich Village since 1969. It includes well-preserved and renovated 19th century houses, colorful tenements, and a variety of sites important to the area&#x27;s rich immigrant, artistic, and Italian-American history, as well as several low-rise, historically significant New York University buildings on Washington Square South.

The Landmarks Preservation Commission designated as landmarks several individual sites proposed by the Greenwich Village Society for Historic Preservation, including the former Bell Telephone Labs Complex (1861–1933), now Westbeth Artists&#x27; Housing, designated in 2011; the Silver Towers/University Village Complex (1967), designed by I.M. Pei and including the Picasso sculpture &quot;Portrait of Sylvette&quot;, designated in 2008; and three early 19th-century federal houses at 127, 129 and 131 MacDougal Street.

Several contextual rezonings were enacted in Greenwich Village in recent years to limit the size and height of allowable new development in the neighborhood, and to encourage the preservation of existing buildings. The following were proposed by the GVSHP and passed by the City Planning Commission:
* Far West Village Rezoning, approved in 2005, was the first downzoning in Manhattan in many years, putting in place new height caps, thus ending construction of high-rise waterfront towers in much of the Village and encouraging the reuse of existing buildings.
* Washington and Greenwich Street Rezoning, approved in 2010, was passed in near-record time to protect six blocks from out-of-scale hotel development and maintain the low-rise character.

====NYU dispute====

New York University and Greenwich Village preservationists have frequently become embroiled in conflicts between the university&#x27;s campus expansion efforts and the preservation of the scale and character of the Village.

As one press critic put it in 2013, &quot;For decades, New York University has waged architectural war on Greenwich Village.&quot; In recent years, the university has clashed most prominently with community groups such as the Greenwich Village Society for Historic Preservation over the construction of new NYU academic buildings and residence halls. During the design of Furman Hall in 2000, the site of which is adjacent to the Judson Memorial Church, community groups sued the university, claiming the construction of a 13-story tower on the site would &quot;loom behind the campanile of [the church]&quot; and &quot;mar the historic silhouette of Greenwich Village as viewed from Washington Square Park&quot;. Despite a justice in State Supreme Court dismissing the case, the university agreed to a settlement with the groups to avoid future appeals, which included reducing the building to 9 stories and restoring the facades of two historic houses located on the site, the Judson House and a red-brick town house where Edgar Allan Poe once lived, which NYU reconstructed as they appeared in the 19th century.

Another dispute arose during the construction of the 26-story Founders Hall, a residence hall planned to be constructed on the site of St. Ann&#x27;s Church at 120 East Twelfth Street. Amidst protests of the demolition of the church, the university decided to maintain and restore the facade and steeple of the building, parts of which were deteriorating or missing, and it now stands freely directly in front of the 12th Street entrance of the building. Further controversy also arose over the height of the building, as well as how the university would integrate the church&#x27;s facade into the building&#x27;s uses; however, in 2006, NYU began construction and the new dorm was completed in December 2008.

In recent years, the most conflict has arisen over the proposed NYU 2031 plan, which the university released in 2010 as its plan for long-term growth, both within and outside of Greenwich Village. This included a court battle over the City of New York&#x27;s right to transfer three plots of Department of Transportation-owned land to the university for constructing staging, which plaintiffs claimed required the consent of the state legislature. Ultimately, the Appellate Division of New York&#x27;s Supreme Court ruled in the university&#x27;s favor after a lower court blocked the expansion plan; however, so far, the university has only begun construction on 181 Mercer Street, the first building in the planned expansion southwards.

<text>George Simon Kaufman (November 16, 1889June 2, 1961) was an American playwright, theater director and producer, humorist, and drama critic. In addition to comedies and political satire, he wrote several musicals for the Marx Brothers and others. He won the Pulitzer Prize for Drama for the musical &quot;Of Thee I Sing&quot; (with Morrie Ryskind and Ira Gershwin) in 1932, and won again in 1937 for the play &quot;You Can&#x27;t Take It with You&quot; (with Moss Hart). He also won the Tony Award for Best Director in 1951 for the musical &quot;Guys and Dolls&quot;.

==Early years==
George S. Kaufman was born to Joseph S. Kaufman, a hatband manufacturer, and Nettie Meyers in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. He had a younger sister, Ruth. His other sister was Helen, nicknamed &quot;Helse&quot;. Kaufman&#x27;s family was Jewish. He graduated from high school in 1907 and studied law for three months. He grew disenchanted and took on a series of odd jobs, selling silk and working in wholesale ribbon sales.

==Career==
Kaufman began contributing humorous material to the column that Franklin P. Adams wrote for the &quot;New York Mail&quot;. He became close friends with Adams, who helped him get his first newspaper job—humor columnist for &quot;The Washington Times&quot;—in 1912. By 1915 he was a drama reporter on &quot;The New York Tribune&quot;, working under Heywood Broun. In 1917 Kaufman joined &quot;The New York Times&quot;, becoming drama editor and staying with the newspaper until 1930.

Kaufman took his editorial responsibilities seriously. According to legend, on one occasion a press agent asked: &quot;How do I get our leading lady&#x27;s name in the &quot;Times&quot;?&quot; Kaufman: &quot;Shoot her.&quot;

===Theater===

Kaufman&#x27;s Broadway debut was September 4, 1918, at the Knickerbocker Theatre, with the premiere of the melodrama &quot;Someone in the House&quot;. He coauthored the play with Walter C. Percival, based on a magazine story written by Larry Evans. The play opened on Broadway (running for only 32 performances) during that year&#x27;s serious flu epidemic, when people were being advised to avoid crowds. With &quot;dour glee&quot;, Kaufman suggested that the best way to avoid crowds in New York City was to attend his play.

Every Broadway season from 1921 through 1958 had a play written or directed by Kaufman. Since Kaufman&#x27;s death in 1961, revivals of his work on Broadway were produced in the 1960s, the 1970s, the 1980s, the 2000s, and the 2010s. Kaufman wrote only one play alone, &quot;The Butter and Egg Man&quot; in 1925. With Marc Connelly, he wrote &quot;Merton of the Movies&quot;, &quot;Dulcy&quot;, and &quot;Beggar on Horseback&quot;; with Ring Lardner, he wrote &quot;June Moon&quot;; with Edna Ferber, he wrote &quot;The Royal Family&quot;, &quot;Dinner at Eight&quot;, and &quot;Stage Door&quot;; with John P. Marquand, he wrote a stage adaptation of Marquand&#x27;s novel &quot;The Late George Apley&quot;; and with Howard Teichmann, he wrote &quot;The Solid Gold Cadillac&quot;. According to his biography on PBS, &quot;he wrote some of the American theater&#x27;s most enduring comedies&quot; with Moss Hart. Their work includes &quot;Once in a Lifetime&quot; (in which he also performed), &quot;Merrily We Roll Along&quot;, &quot;The Man Who Came to Dinner&quot;, and &quot;You Can&#x27;t Take It with You&quot;, which won the Pulitzer Prize in 1937.

For a period, Kaufman lived at 158 West 58th Street in New York City. The building later was the setting for &quot;Stage Door&quot;. It is now the Park Savoy Hotel, and for many years was considered a single room occupancy hotel.

====Musical theater====
Despite his claim that he knew nothing about music and hated it in the theater, Kaufman collaborated on many musical theater projects. His most successful of such efforts include two Broadway shows crafted for the Marx Brothers, &quot;The Cocoanuts&quot;, written with Irving Berlin, and &quot;Animal Crackers&quot;, written with Morrie Ryskind, Bert Kalmar, and Harry Ruby. According to Charlotte Chandler, &quot;By the time &quot;Animal Crackers&quot; opened ... the Marx Brothers were becoming famous enough to interest Hollywood. Paramount signed them to a contract&quot;. Kaufman was one of the writers who excelled in writing intelligent nonsense for Groucho Marx, a process that was collaborative, given Groucho&#x27;s skills at expanding upon the scripted material. Though the Marx Brothers were notoriously critical of their writers, Groucho and Harpo Marx expressed admiration and gratitude towards Kaufman. Dick Cavett, introducing Groucho onstage at Carnegie Hall in 1972, told the audience that Groucho considered Kaufman to be &quot;his god&quot;.

While &quot;The Cocoanuts&quot; was being developed in Atlantic City, Irving Berlin was hugely enthusiastic about including the song &quot;Always&quot;, which he had written as a wedding present for his bride. Kaufman was less enthusiastic, and refused to rework the libretto to include this number. The song ultimately became a huge hit for Berlin, recorded by many popular performers. According to Laurence Bergreen, &quot;Kaufman&#x27;s lack of enthusiasm caused Irving to lose confidence in the song, and &#x27;Always&#x27; was deleted from the score of &quot;The Cocoanuts&quot; – though not from its creator&#x27;s memory. ... Kaufman, a confirmed misogynist, had had no use for the song in &quot;The Cocoanuts&quot;, but his disapproval did not deter Berlin from saving it for a more important occasion.&quot; &quot;The Cocoanuts&quot; would remain Irving Berlin&#x27;s only Broadway musical – until his last one, &quot;Mr. President&quot; – that did not include at least one eventual hit song.

Kaufman recalled the matter differently. In an article in &quot;Stage&quot; magazine, he recalled that Berlin woke him up at 5 am one morning to play a new song he had just written. &quot;Even &quot;my&quot; deficient musical sense recognized that here was a song that was going to be popular. I listened to it two or three times, then took a stab at it myself, and as dawn came up over the Atlantic, Irving and I were happily singing &#x27;Always&#x27; together—its first performance on any stage. I went back to bed a happy man, and stayed happy until rehearsals started, when it turned out that &#x27;Always&#x27; had not been written for our show at all, but purely for Irving&#x27;s music-publishing house. In its place in &quot;The Cocoanuts&quot; was a song called &#x27;A Little Bungalow,&#x27; which we never could reprise in Act Two because the actors couldn&#x27;t remember it that long.&quot;

Humor derived from political situations was of particular interest to Kaufman. He collaborated on the hit musical &quot;Of Thee I Sing&quot;, which won the 1932 Pulitzer Prize, the first musical so honored, and its sequel &quot;Let &#x27;Em Eat Cake&quot;, as well as one troubled, but eventually successful, satire that had several incarnations, &quot;Strike Up the Band&quot;. Working with Kaufman on these ventures were Ryskind, George Gershwin, and Ira Gershwin. Also, Kaufman, with Moss Hart, wrote the book to &quot;I&#x27;d Rather Be Right&quot;, a musical starring George M. Cohan as Franklin Delano Roosevelt (the U.S. president at the time), with songs by Richard Rodgers and Lorenz Hart. He also co-wrote the 1935 comedy-drama &quot;First Lady&quot;. In 1945, Kaufman adapted &quot;H.M.S. Pinafore&quot; into &quot;Hollywood Pinafore&quot;.

Kaufman also contributed to major New York revues, including &quot;The Band Wagon&quot; (which shared songs, but not plot with the 1953 film version) with Arthur Schwartz and Howard Dietz. His often-anthologized sketch &quot;The Still Alarm&quot; from the revue &quot;The Little Show&quot; lasted long after the show closed. Another well-known sketch of his is &quot;If Men Played Cards as Women Do&quot;. Also, musicals have been based on Kaufman properties, such as the 1981 musical version of &quot;Merrily We Roll Along&quot;, adapted by George Furth and Stephen Sondheim. The musical &quot;Sherry!&quot; (1967) was based on his play &quot;The Man Who Came to Dinner&quot;.

====Directing and producing====
Kaufman directed the original or revival stage productions of many plays and musicals, including &quot;The Front Page&quot; by Charles MacArthur and Ben Hecht (1928), &quot;Of Thee I Sing&quot; (1931 and 1952), &quot;Of Mice and Men&quot; by John Steinbeck (1937), &quot;My Sister Eileen&quot; by Joseph Fields and Jerome Chodorov (1940), &quot;Hollywood Pinafore&quot; (1945), &quot;The Next Half Hour&quot; (1945), &quot;Park Avenue&quot; (1946, also co-wrote the book), &quot;Town House&quot; (1948), &quot;Bravo!&quot; (1948, also co-wrote the script), &quot;Metropole&quot; (1949), the Frank Loesser musical &quot;Guys and Dolls&quot;, for which he won the 1951 Best Director Tony Award, &quot;The Enchanted&quot; (1950), &quot;The Small Hours&quot; (1951, also co-wrote the script), &quot;Fancy Meeting You Again&quot; (1952, also co-wrote the script), &quot;The Solid Gold Cadillac&quot; (1953, also co-wrote the script), and &quot;Romanoff and Juliet&quot; by Peter Ustinov (1957).

Kaufman produced many of his own plays, as well as those of other writers. For a short time, from &quot;circa&quot; 1940 to 1946, Kaufman, with Moss Hart and Max Gordon, owned and operated the Lyceum Theatre.

===Film and television===
Many of Kaufman&#x27;s plays were adapted into Hollywood and British films. Among the more well-received were &quot;Dinner At Eight&quot;, &quot;Stage Door&quot; (almost completely rewritten by others for the film version) and &quot;You Can&#x27;t Take It with You&quot; (changed significantly by others for the film version), which won the Best Picture Oscar in 1938, and &quot;The Dark Tower&quot;. He also occasionally wrote directly for the movies, most significantly the screenplay for &quot;A Night at the Opera&quot; for the Marx Brothers. His only credit as a film director was &quot;The Senator Was Indiscreet&quot; (1947) starring William Powell.

From 1949 until midway through the 1952–1953 season, he appeared as a panelist on the CBS television series &quot;This Is Show Business&quot;. Kaufman made a remark about the excessive airing of &quot;Silent Night&quot; during the Christmas season, &quot;Let&#x27;s make this one program&quot;, he said, &quot;on which no one sings &#x27;Silent Night&#x27;.&quot; The resulting public outcry prompted his dismissal by CBS. In response, Fred Allen said, &quot;There were only two wits on television: Groucho Marx and George S. Kaufman. Without Kaufman, television has reverted to being half-witted.&quot; It would be more than a year before Kaufman appeared on TV again.

===Bridge===

Kaufman was a prominent player of bridge, probably both auction bridge and contract bridge. &quot;The New Yorker&quot; published many of his humorous items about the card game; at least some have been reprinted more than once, including:
*&quot;Kibitzers&#x27; Revolt&quot; and the suggestion that bridge clubs should post notice whether the North–South or the East–West pairs are holding good cards.
*Kaufman was notoriously impatient with poor players. One such partner asked permission to use the men&#x27;s room, according to legend, and Kaufman replied: &quot;Gladly. For the first time today I&#x27;ll know what you have in your hand.&quot;
*On sitting South: (1) &quot;No matter who writes the books or articles, South holds the most terrific cards I ever saw. There is a lucky fellow if ever I saw one.&quot; (2) Oswald Jacoby reported a deal that Kaufman played marvelously in 1952, after which he cracked, &quot;I&#x27;d rather sit South than be the President.&quot;
*On , &quot;I&#x27;d like a review of the bidding with all the original inflections.&quot;

His first wife Beatrice Bakrow Kaufman was also an avid bridge player, and an occasional poker player with Algonquin men, who wrote at least one &quot;New Yorker&quot; article on bridge herself, in 1928.

==Personal life==

In the 1920s, Kaufman was a member of the Algonquin Round Table, a circle of writers and show business people. From the 1920s through the 1950s, Kaufman was as well known for his personality as he was for his writing. In the Moss Hart autobiography &quot;Act One&quot;, Hart portrayed Kaufman as a morose and intimidating figure, uncomfortable with any expressions of affection between human beings—in life or on the page. Hart writes that Max Siegel said: &quot;Maybe I should have warned you. Mr Kaufman hates any kind of sentimentality—can&#x27;t stand it!&quot;
This perspective, along with a number of taciturn observations made by Kaufman himself, led to a simplistic but commonly held belief that Hart was the emotional soul of the creative team while Kaufman was a misanthropic writer of punchlines. Kaufman preferred never to leave Manhattan. He once said: &quot;I never want to go any place where I can&#x27;t get back to Broadway and 44th by midnight.&quot;

Called &quot;Public Lover Number One&quot;, he dated several prominent actresses on Broadway. Kaufman found himself in the center of a scandal in 1936 when, in the midst of a child custody suit, the former husband of actress Mary Astor threatened to publish one of Astor&#x27;s diaries purportedly containing extremely explicit details of an affair between Kaufman and the actress. The diary was eventually destroyed by the court, unread, in 1952, but details of the supposed contents were published in &quot;Confidential&quot; magazine, &quot;Hollywood Babylon&quot; by Kenneth Anger (both always have been considered unreliable sources) and in various other questionable publications. Some of the sexually explicit portions of Mary Astor&#x27;s writing about Kaufman were reprinted in &quot;New York&quot; magazine in 2012 and &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; magazine in 2016. Kaufman had an affair with actress Natalie Schafer during the 1940s.

Kaufman joined the theater club, The Lambs, in 1944.

Kaufman was married to his first wife Beatrice from 1917 until her death in 1945. They had one daughter, Anne Kaufman (Booth). Four years later, he married actress Leueen MacGrath on May 26, 1949, with whom he collaborated on a number of plays before their divorce in August 1957. Kaufman died in New York City on June 2, 1961, at the age of 71. His granddaughter, Beatrice Colen, was an actress who had recurring appearances on both &quot;Happy Days&quot; and &quot;Wonder Woman&quot;.

In 1979, Donald Oliver compiled and edited a collection of Kaufman&#x27;s humorous pieces, with a foreword by Dick Cavett.

==Portrayals==
Kaufman was portrayed by the actor David Thornton in the 1994 film &quot;Mrs. Parker and the Vicious Circle&quot; and by Jason Robards in the 1963 film &quot;Act One&quot;. In the 2014 Broadway adaptation of the latter by James Lapine, he was played by Tony Shalhoub.

The title character of the 1991 Coen brothers film &quot;Barton Fink&quot;, who is a playwright, bears a strong physical resemblance to Kaufman.

Kaufman is portrayed in the film &quot;Mank&quot; by actor Adam Shapiro.

<text>Gilbert Newton Lewis (October 23 or October 25, 1875 – March 23, 1946) was an American physical chemist and a dean of the college of chemistry at University of California, Berkeley. Lewis was best known for his discovery of the covalent bond and his concept of electron pairs; his Lewis dot structures and other contributions to valence bond theory have shaped modern theories of chemical bonding. Lewis successfully contributed to chemical thermodynamics, photochemistry, and isotope separation, and is also known for his concept of acids and bases. Lewis also researched on relativity and quantum physics, and in 1926 he coined the term &quot;photon&quot; for the smallest unit of radiant energy.

G. N. Lewis was born in 1875 in Weymouth, Massachusetts. After receiving his PhD in chemistry from Harvard University and studying abroad in Germany and the Philippines, Lewis moved to California in 1912 to teach chemistry at the University of California, Berkeley, where he became the dean of the college of chemistry and spent the rest of his life. As a professor, he incorporated thermodynamic principles into the chemistry curriculum and reformed chemical thermodynamics in a mathematically rigorous manner accessible to ordinary chemists. He began measuring the free energy values related to several chemical processes, both organic and inorganic. In 1916, he also proposed his theory of bonding and added information about electrons in the periodic table of the chemical elements. In 1933, he started his research on isotope separation. Lewis worked with hydrogen and managed to purify a sample of heavy water. He then came up with his theory of acids and bases, and did work in photochemistry during the last years of his life.

Though he was nominated 41 times, G. N. Lewis never won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry, resulting in a major Nobel Prize controversy. On the other hand, Lewis mentored and influenced numerous Nobel laureates at Berkeley including Harold Urey (1934 Nobel Prize), William F. Giauque (1949 Nobel Prize), Glenn T. Seaborg (1951 Nobel Prize), Willard Libby (1960 Nobel Prize), Melvin Calvin (1961 Nobel Prize) and so on, turning Berkeley into one of the world&#x27;s most prestigious centers for chemistry. On March 23, 1946, Lewis was found dead in his Berkeley laboratory where he had been working with hydrogen cyanide; many postulated that the cause of his death was suicide. After Lewis&#x27; death, his children followed their father&#x27;s career in chemistry, and the Lewis Hall on the Berkeley campus is named after him.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Lewis was born in 1875 and raised in Weymouth, Massachusetts, where there exists a street named for him, G.N. Lewis Way, off Summer Street. Additionally, the wing of the new Weymouth High School Chemistry department has been named in his honor. Lewis received his primary education at home from his parents, Frank Wesley Lewis, a lawyer of independent character, and Mary Burr White Lewis. He read at age three and was intellectually precocious. In 1884 his family moved to Lincoln, Nebraska, and in 1889 he received his first formal education at the university preparatory school.

In 1893, after two years at the University of Nebraska, Lewis transferred to Harvard University, where he obtained his B.S. in 1896. After a year of teaching at Phillips Academy in Andover, Lewis returned to Harvard to study with the physical chemist T. W. Richards and obtained his Ph.D. in 1899 with a dissertation on electrochemical potentials. After a year of teaching at Harvard, Lewis took a traveling fellowship to Germany, the center of physical chemistry, and studied with Walther Nernst at Göttingen and with Wilhelm Ostwald at Leipzig. While working in Nernst&#x27;s lab, Lewis apparently developed a lifelong enmity with Nernst. In the following years, Lewis started to criticize and denounce his former teacher on many occasions, calling Nernst&#x27;s work on his heat theorem &quot;a regrettable episode in the history of chemistry&quot;. A Swedish friend of Nernst&#x27;s, Wilhelm Palmær, was a member of the Nobel Chemistry Committee. There is evidence that he used the Nobel nominating and reporting procedures to block a Nobel Prize for Lewis in thermodynamics by nominating Lewis for the prize three times, and then using his position as a committee member to write negative reports.

===Harvard, Manila, and MIT===
After his stay in Nernst&#x27;s lab, Lewis returned to Harvard in 1901 as an instructor for three more years. He was appointed instructor in thermodynamics and electrochemistry. In 1904 Lewis was granted a leave of absence and became Superintendent of Weights and Measures for the Bureau of Science in Manila, Philippines. The next year he returned to Cambridge, Massachusetts when the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) appointed him to a faculty position, in which he had a chance to join a group of outstanding physical chemists under the direction of Arthur Amos Noyes. He became an assistant professor in 1907, associate professor in 1908, and full professor in 1911.

===University of California, Berkeley===
G. N. Lewis left MIT in 1912 to become a professor of physical chemistry and dean of the College of Chemistry at the University of California, Berkeley. On June 21, 1912, he married Mary Hinckley Sheldon, daughter of a Harvard professor of Romance languages. They had two sons, both of whom became chemistry professors, and a daughter. In 1913, he joined the Alpha Chi Sigma at Berkeley, the professional chemistry fraternity.

Lewis&#x27; graduate advisees at Berkeley went on to be exceptionally successful with the Nobel Committee. 14 Nobel prizes were eventually awarded to the men he took as students. The best-known of these include Harold Urey (1934 Nobel Prize), William F. Giauque (1949 Nobel Prize), Glenn T. Seaborg (1951 Nobel Prize), Willard Libby (1960 Nobel Prize), Melvin Calvin (1961 Nobel Prize). Due to his efforts, the college of chemistry at Berkeley became one of the top chemistry centers in the world.

While at Berkeley he also refused entry to women, including preventing Margaret Melhase from conducting graduate studies. Melhase had previously co-discovered Cesium-137 with Seaborg as an undergraduate. In 1913, he was elected to the National Academy of Sciences. He was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 1918. He resigned in 1934, refusing to state the cause for his resignation; it has been speculated that it was due to a dispute over the internal politics of that institution or to the failure of those he had nominated to be elected. His decision to resign may also have been sparked by his resentment over the award of the 1934 Nobel Prize for chemistry to his student, Harold Urey, for his 1931 isolation of deuterium and the confirmation of its spectrum. This was a prize Lewis almost certainly felt he should have shared for his efforts to purify and characterize heavy water.

==Death==
On 23 March 1946, a graduate student found Lewis&#x27;s lifeless body under a laboratory workbench at Berkeley. Lewis had been working on an experiment with liquid hydrogen cyanide, and deadly fumes from a broken line had leaked into the laboratory. The coroner ruled that the cause of death was coronary artery disease, because of a lack of any signs of cyanosis, but some believe that it may have been a suicide. Berkeley Emeritus Professor William Jolly, who reported the various views on Lewis&#x27;s death in his 1987 history of UC Berkeley&#x27;s College of Chemistry, &quot;From Retorts to Lasers&quot;, wrote that a higher-up in the department believed that Lewis had committed suicide.

If Lewis&#x27;s death was indeed a suicide, a possible explanation was depression brought on by a lunch with Irving Langmuir. Langmuir and Lewis had a long rivalry, dating back to Langmuir&#x27;s extensions of Lewis&#x27;s theory of the chemical bond. Langmuir had been awarded the 1932 Nobel Prize in chemistry for his work on surface chemistry, while Lewis had not received the Prize despite having been nominated 41 times. On the day of Lewis&#x27;s death, Langmuir and Lewis had met for lunch at Berkeley, a meeting that Michael Kasha recalled only years later. Associates reported that Lewis came back from lunch in a dark mood, played a morose game of bridge with some colleagues, then went back to work in his lab. An hour later, he was found dead. Langmuir&#x27;s papers at the Library of Congress confirm that he had been on the Berkeley campus that day to receive an honorary degree.

Lewis Hall at Berkeley, built in 1948, is named in his honor.

== Scientific achievements ==
===Thermodynamics===
Most of Lewis’ lasting interests originated during his Harvard years. The most important was thermodynamics, a subject in which Richards was very active at that time. Although most of the important thermodynamic relations were known by 1895, they were seen as isolated equations, and had not yet been rationalized as a logical system, from which, given one relation, the rest could be derived. Moreover, these relations were inexact, applying only to ideal chemical systems. These were two outstanding problems of theoretical thermodynamics. In two long and ambitious theoretical papers in 1900 and 1901, Lewis tried to provide a solution. Lewis introduced the thermodynamic concept of activity and coined the term &quot;fugacity&quot;. His new idea of fugacity, or &quot;escaping tendency&quot;, was a function with the dimensions of pressure which expressed the tendency of a substance to pass from one chemical phase to another. Lewis believed that fugacity was the fundamental principle from which a system of real thermodynamic relations could be derived. This hope was not realized, though fugacity did find a lasting place in the description of real gases.

Lewis’ early papers also reveal an unusually advanced awareness of J. W. Gibbs&#x27;s and P. Duhem&#x27;s ideas of free energy and thermodynamic potential. These ideas were well known to physicists and mathematicians, but not to most practical chemists, who regarded them as abstruse and inapplicable to chemical systems. Most chemists relied on the familiar thermodynamics of heat (enthalpy) of Berthelot, Ostwald, and Van ’t Hoff, and the calorimetric school. Heat of reaction is not, of course, a measure of the tendency of chemical changes to occur, and Lewis realized that only free energy and entropy could provide an exact chemical thermodynamics. He derived free energy from fugacity; he tried, without success, to obtain an exact expression for the entropy function, which in 1901 had not been defined at low temperatures. Richards too tried and failed, and not until Nernst succeeded in 1907 was it possible to calculate entropies unambiguously. Although Lewis’ fugacity-based system did not last, his early interest in free energy and entropy proved most fruitful, and much of his career was devoted to making these useful concepts accessible to practical chemists.

At Harvard, Lewis also wrote a theoretical paper on the thermodynamics of blackbody radiation in which he postulated that light has a pressure. He later revealed that he had been discouraged from pursuing this idea by his older, more conservative colleagues, who were unaware that Wilhelm Wien and others were successfully pursuing the same line of thought. Lewis’ paper remained unpublished; but his interest in radiation and quantum theory, and (later) in relativity, sprang from this early, aborted effort. From the start of his career, Lewis regarded himself as both chemist and physicist.

===Valence theory===
About 1902 Lewis started to use unpublished drawings of cubical atoms in his lecture notes, in which the corners of the cube represented possible electron positions. Lewis later cited these notes in his classic 1916 paper on chemical bonding, as being the first expression of his ideas.

A third major interest that originated during Lewis’ Harvard years was his valence theory. In 1902, while trying to explain the laws of valence to his students, Lewis conceived the idea that atoms were built up of a concentric series of cubes with electrons at each corner. This “cubic atom” explained the cycle of eight elements in the periodic table and was in accord with the widely accepted belief that chemical bonds were formed by transfer of electrons to give each atom a complete set of eight. This electrochemical theory of valence found its most elaborate expression in the work of Richard Abegg in 1904, but Lewis’ version of this theory was the only one to be embodied in a concrete atomic model. Again Lewis’ theory did not interest his Harvard mentors, who, like most American chemists of that time, had no taste for such speculation. Lewis did not publish his theory of the cubic atom, but in 1916 it became an important part of his theory of the shared electron pair bond.

In 1916, he published his classic paper on chemical bonding &quot;The Atom and the Molecule&quot; in which he formulated the idea of what would become known as the covalent bond, consisting of a shared pair of electrons, and he defined the term odd molecule (the modern term is free radical) when an electron is not shared. He included what became known as Lewis dot structures as well as the cubical atom model. These ideas on chemical bonding were expanded upon by Irving Langmuir and became the inspiration for the studies on the nature of the chemical bond by Linus Pauling.

===Acids and bases===
In 1923, he formulated the electron-pair theory of acid–base reactions. In this theory of acids and bases, a &quot;Lewis acid&quot; is an &quot;electron-pair acceptor&quot; and a &quot;Lewis base&quot; is an &quot;electron-pair donor&quot;. This year he also published a monograph on his theories of the chemical bond.

Based on work by J. Willard Gibbs, it was known that chemical reactions proceeded to an equilibrium determined by the free energy of the substances taking part. Lewis spent 25 years determining free energies of various substances. In 1923 he and Merle Randall published the results of this study, which helped formalize modern chemical thermodynamics.

===Heavy water===
Lewis was the first to produce a pure sample of deuterium oxide (heavy water) in 1933 and the first to study survival and growth of life forms in heavy water. By accelerating deuterons (deuterium nuclei) in Ernest O. Lawrence&#x27;s cyclotron, he was able to study many of the properties of atomic nuclei. During the 1930s, he was mentor to Glenn T. Seaborg, who was retained for post-doctoral work as Lewis&#x27; personal research assistant. Seaborg went on to win the 1951 Nobel Prize in Chemistry and have the element seaborgium named in his honor while he was still alive.

=== O4 Tetraoxygen ===
In 1924, by studying the magnetic properties of solutions of oxygen in liquid nitrogen, Lewis found that O4 molecules were formed. This was the first evidence for tetratomic oxygen.

=== Relativity and quantum physics ===

In 1908 he published the first of several papers on relativity, in which he derived the mass-energy relationship in a different way from Albert Einstein&#x27;s derivation. In 1909, he and Richard C. Tolman combined his methods with special relativity. In 1912 Lewis and Edwin Bidwell Wilson presented a major work in mathematical physics that not only applied synthetic geometry to the study of spacetime, but also noted the identity of a spacetime squeeze mapping and a Lorentz transformation.

In 1926, he coined the term &quot;photon&quot; for the smallest unit of radiant energy (light). Actually, the outcome of his letter to &quot;Nature&quot; was not what he had intended. In the letter, he proposed a photon being a structural element, not energy. He insisted on the need for a new variable, &quot;the number of photons&quot;. Although his theory differed from the quantum theory of light introduced by Albert Einstein in 1905, his name was adopted for what Einstein had called a light quantum (Lichtquant in German).

===Other achievements===
In 1921, Lewis was the first to propose an empirical equation describing the failure of strong electrolytes to obey the law of mass action, a problem that had perplexed physical chemists for twenty years. His empirical equations for what he called ionic strength were later confirmed to be in accord with the Debye–Hückel equation for strong electrolytes, published in 1923.

Over the course of his career, Lewis published on many other subjects besides those mentioned in this entry, ranging from the nature of light quanta to the economics of price stabilization. In the last years of his life, Lewis and graduate student Michael Kasha, his last research associate, established that phosphorescence of organic molecules involves emission of light from one electron in an excited triplet state (a state in which two electrons have their spin vectors oriented in the &quot;same&quot; direction, but in different orbitals) and measured the paramagnetism of this triplet state.

<doc id="13018" wikidata="Q5589680" url="?curid=13018" title="Governor of Michigan">
<text>The governor of Michigan is the head of government of the U.S. state of Michigan. The current governor is Gretchen Whitmer, a member of the Democratic Party, who was inaugurated on January 1, 2019, as the state&#x27;s 49th governor. She was re-elected to serve a second term in 2022. The governor is elected to a four-year term and is limited to two terms.

==Qualifications==
Governors of Michigan, as well as their lieutenant governors, must be United States citizens who have been qualified electors in Michigan for the four years preceding election and must be at least 30 years of age. A constitutional amendment adopted at the 2010 general election provides that a person is ineligible for any elected office, including governor and lieutenant governor, if convicted of a felony involving dishonesty, deceit, fraud, or a breach of the public trust, and if the conviction were related to the person&#x27;s official capacity while holding any elective office or position of employment in local, state, or federal government.

==Elections and term of office==
From statehood until the election of 1966, governors were elected to two-year terms. Elections are held in November, and the governor assumes office the following January, except in the case of death or resignation. From statehood until 1851, elections were held in odd-numbered years. A new state constitution was drafted in 1850 and took effect in 1851. As part of the process bringing the constitution into effect, there was a single one-year term of governor in 1851. Thereafter elections were held in even years.

The constitution adopted in 1963 changed the governor&#x27;s term to four years, starting in 1967. Since then, gubernatorial elections have been offset by two years between the U.S. presidential elections (e.g., presidential elections were in 2008 and 2012, while gubernatorial elections in that time period were in 2010 and 2014). Gubernatorial elections are held concurrently with state Senate elections. The winner of the gubernatorial election takes office at noon on January 1 of the year following the election.

Before 1992, governors could serve an unlimited number of terms. In 1992, an amendment to the Michigan constitution imposed a limit of two four-year terms for the office of governor, whether successive or separated. However, only those terms served after the amendment took effect counted toward the two-term limit. Thus, John Engler, the governor at the time, served three terms as his first term occurred before the restriction. Engler was reelected in 1994 and 1998, but was required to leave office for good in 2002.

==Powers and duties==
The governor has responsibilities to:
* sign or veto laws passed by the legislature; including a line item veto
* reorganize state executive government agencies and departments;
* appoint, with advice and consent of the Senate, and oversee most department heads;
* appoint judges, subject to ratification by the electorate;
* appoint members of boards and commissions;
* propose a state budget;
* give the annual &quot;State of the State address&quot;;
* sue other executives to comply with the law;
* command the state militia; and
* grant pardons for any crime, except cases involving impeachment by the legislature.

The governor appoints the members of the governing boards of 10 of the state&#x27;s 13 public universities and department commissions.

==History of the office==

Forty-seven people have been governor of the state over forty-nine distinct periods, with two, John S. Barry and Frank Fitzgerald, serving non-consecutive terms. Before statehood, there were five governors of the Michigan Territory. Stevens T. Mason, Michigan&#x27;s first governor, also served as a territorial governor. He was elected governor at age 23 as a member of the Democratic Party in 1835 and served until 1840. Mason was the youngest state governor in United States history.

Jennifer Granholm became the first female governor of Michigan on January 1, 2003, when she succeeded Engler; she served for 8 years, until January 1, 2011.

<text>(; Twilight of the Gods), WWV 86D, is the last of the four epic music dramas that constitute Richard Wagner&#x27;s cycle &quot;Der Ring des Nibelungen&quot; (English: &quot;The Ring of the Nibelung&quot;). It received its premiere at the on 17 August 1876, as part of the first complete performance of the whole work.

The title is a translation into German of the Old Norse phrase &quot;&quot;, which in Norse mythology refers to a prophesied war among various beings and gods that ultimately results in the burning, immersion in water, and renewal of the world. As with the rest of the &quot;Ring&quot;, however, Wagner&#x27;s account diverges significantly from these Old Norse sources.

The autograph manuscript of the work is preserved in the Richard Wagner Foundation.

=== Prologue ===

Prelude to the Prologue

==== &quot;Scene 1&quot; ====
The three Norns, daughters of Erda, the goddess of Nature, gather beside Brünnhilde&#x27;s rock, weaving the Rope of Destiny. From it they read of the past, the present, and of the future when Valhalla will be set on fire and the end of the gods will come (&quot;Welch&#x27; Licht leuchtet dort?&quot;). As their narration approaches the point when they want to sing about the fate of Alberich&#x27;s ring and its curse and as the themes of Siegfried and the Curse of the ring are heard, the rope breaks. Lamenting the loss of their wisdom, the Norns disappear, returning to their mother Erda beneath the earth (&quot;Zu End&#x27; ewiges Wissen!&quot;).

Orchestral Interlude - &quot;Tagesgrauen&quot; (&quot;Dawn&quot;)

==== &quot;Scene 2&quot; ====
As day breaks, Siegfried and Brünnhilde emerge from their dwelling high on a mountaintop surrounded by magic fire (&quot;Zu neuen Thaten, theurer Helde&quot;). Brünnhilde sends Siegfried off to new heroic deeds, urging him to keep their love in mind. Siegfried proclaims himself to be simply an executor of her will, and as a pledge of his fidelity he gives her the ring of power that he took from Fafner&#x27;s hoard. In a duet, both of them extoll their loving bond, which nothing can untie, even when distance keeps them apart (&quot;O! heilige Götter!&quot;). Bearing Brünnhilde&#x27;s shield and mounting her steed Grane, Siegfried then rides away.

Orchestral Interlude - &quot;Siegfrieds Rheinfahrt&quot; (&quot;Siegfried&#x27;s Rhine Journey&quot;)

=== Act 1 ===
==== &quot;Scene 1&quot; ====
The act begins on the shores of the Rhine in the Hall of the Gibichungs, a people named after the deceased king Gibich. Gunther, his son and heir, sits enthroned. Gunther&#x27;s half-brother and chief minister Hagen advises him to find a wife for himself and a husband for Gutrune, the sister of them both, to enlarge the glory and might of their dynasty and secure it for the future. He suggests Brünnhilde, the noblest of women, as appropriate for Gunther, and Siegfried, the dragon-slayer, the greatest of heroes, as the best husband for Gutrune. Neither Gunther nor Gutrune knows how to win themselves such partners, but Hagen reminds Gutrune that he has given her a potion she can use to make Siegfried forget any woman he has ever seen and fall in love with her; enamoured of Gutrune, Siegfried will then also be surely willing to bring Brünnhilde, who sleeps on a mountaintop encircled by fire only the fearless can pass, to Gunther in order to gain from him the permission for marriage with Gutrune. Gunther and Gutrune, not knowing that Siegfried and Brünnhilde are actually in love with each other, agree enthusiastically with this plan.

==== &quot;Scene 2&quot; ====
Siegfried lands near the Gibichung Hall with his boat, seeking to meet Gunther, of whose fame he has heard during his journey (&quot;Heil, Siegfried, theurer Held!&quot;). Gunther extends hospitality to the hero, and Gutrune offers him the potion. Unaware of deception, Siegfried toasts Brünnhilde and their mutual love and drinks. In a while he loses his memory of her and is struck by desire for Gutrune. Drugged, Siegfried then offers to win a wife for Gunther, who tells him about Brünnhilde and the magic fire, which only a fearless person can cross. They swear blood-brotherhood, mixing their blood in a drinking horn (&quot;Blühenden Lebens labendes Blut&quot;). Hagen holds the horn but does not join in the oath, and the two new brothers then leave for Brünnhilde&#x27;s rock. Hagen, left on guard duty, gloats that his so-called masters are unwittingly bringing the ring to him (&quot;Hier sitz ich zur Wacht&quot; - &quot;Hagens Wacht&quot; - &quot;Hagen&#x27;s Watch&quot;).

Orchestral Interlude

==== &quot;Scene 3&quot; ====
Meanwhile, Brünnhilde is visited on her rock by her Valkyrie sister Waltraute, who recounts that Wotan returned from his wanderings with his spear shattered. The spear was the symbol of the god&#x27;s authority and the source and instrument of his power, carved with all the treaties through which he ruled. Unable to influence events any more, he has ordered branches of the World tree to be piled around Valhalla by its heroes and waits in resignation for his ravens to bring him news about the ring (&quot;Höre mit Sinn, was ich dir sage!&quot; - &quot;Waltraute&#x27;s Monologue&quot;). Waltraute begs Brünnhilde to return the ring to the Rhinemaidens, but Brünnhilde refuses to relinquish the pledge of Siegfried&#x27;s love, and Waltraute rides away in despair.

Crossing the ring of fire, Siegfried arrives disguised as Gunther by using the Tarnhelm and claims Brünnhilde for his wife (&quot;Brünnhild&#x27;, ein Freier kam&quot;). Though Brünnhilde, terrified by the appearance of an unknown man, tries to resist him, without the divine powers she has earlier renounced for love&#x27;s sake she has now nothing with which to defend herself but the ring, which Siegfried manages to snatch cruelly from her hand during a fight, being immune to its coercive power thanks to his fearlessness. Putting the ring on his own hand instead, Siegfried then spends the night with Brünnhilde on her rock, placing the magic sword Nothung between them as a witness to his loyalty to Gunther and his keeping the promise to bring Brünnhilde untouched (&quot;Nun Nothung, zeuge du&quot;).

=== Act 2 ===
Prelude to Act 2

==== &quot;Scene 1&quot; ====
As Hagen sits sleeping on night watch, his father Alberich appears and urges him to obtain the ring (&quot;Schläfst du, Hagen, mein Sohn?&quot;). Hagen, barely conscious, swears to do so and Alberich vanishes with pleas for Hagen to remain loyal to him.

Orchestral Interlude - &quot;Morgenröthe&quot; (&quot;The Blush of Dawn&quot;)

==== &quot;Scene 2&quot; ====
Siegfried arrives at dawn via Tarnhelm-magic back to the settlement of the Gibichungs, having resumed his natural form and left Brünnhilde on a boat on the Rhine with Gunther. He explains to Gutrune how he managed to change his form back from Gunther&#x27;s just in time for Brünnhilde to not be able to recognize the deceit.

==== &quot;Scene 3&quot; ====
Hagen summons the Gibichung vassals to welcome Gunther and his bride (&quot;Hagens Ruf&quot; - &quot;Hagen&#x27;s Call&quot;). He does this by sounding the war-alarm. The vassals are surprised to learn that the occasion is not battle, but their master&#x27;s wedding and party. Hagen announces that Gunther has won himself a wife and orders them to slay sacrificial animals so that gods may grant a happy marriage. The vassals are then told to defend their new queen&#x27;s honour if someone were to wrong her.

==== &quot;Scene 4&quot; ====
Gunther lands on the Rhine&#x27;s shore in front of Siegfried, Gutrune, Hagen, and the assembled Gibichung men and women and leads in a downcast Brünnhilde as his trophy. With false pomp he then triumphantly announces a double wedding: Brünnhilde to himself, and Gutrune to Siegfried (&quot;Brünnhild&#x27;, die hehrste Frau&quot;). Brünnhilde almost faints in despair as she now sees her beloved, who doesn&#x27;t even recognize her, with a different woman. However, she notices the ring on Siegfried&#x27;s hand, and realizes she has been betrayed (&quot;Betrug! Betrug! Schändlichster Betrug!&quot;). Declaring publicly that the man who conquered her and took the ring was not Gunther but Siegfried in disguise she exposes Gunther as an impostor who tried to increase his own prestige through the deeds of someone else. Filled with unquenchable desperate rage she also denounces Siegfried and falsely accuses him of having intercourse with her while in Gunther&#x27;s form, thus breaking his blood-brotherhood with Gunther. Siegfried denies Brünnhilde&#x27;s charge, but the vassals urge him to prove his innocence by taking an oath. Hagen offers his spear as the weapon by which Siegfried can do so. Siegfried agrees and swears upon Hagen&#x27;s spear-point that he may be killed with it if he has ever loved Brünnhilde (&quot;Helle Wehr, heilige Waffe!&quot;). She also seizes the spear and swears that Siegfried may be killed with it for swearing the false oath. Once again Hagen supervises silently as others take oaths to his advantage. The naively light-hearted Siegfried, wishing for his wedding day to be joyful, then leads Gutrune and the bystanders exuberantly off to the wedding feast, as if nothing too significant has happened.

Orchestral Interlude

==== &quot;Scene 5&quot; ====
Brünnhilde, Hagen, and Gunther do not join the celebration and stay alone by the shore. Deeply shamed by Brünnhilde&#x27;s outburst in front of his subjects and thus threatened in his authority, Gunther agrees to Hagen&#x27;s suggestion that Siegfried must be killed in order for Gunther to regain his standing. Indeed, to see Siegfried die is Gunther&#x27;s duty, since the hero has apparently broken the sacred bond of blood-brotherhood during the night on the rock with Brünnhilde, which betrayal condemns him by law to the rightful punishment of death. Brünnhilde, seeking revenge for Siegfried&#x27;s manifest treachery, joins the plot and tells Hagen that Siegfried would be vulnerable only to a stab in the back. Hagen and Gunther decide to lure Siegfried on a hunting-trip and murder him. They sing a trio in which Brünnhilde and Gunther vow in the name of Wotan, &quot;guardian of oaths&quot;, to kill Siegfried, while Hagen repeats his pledge to Alberich: to acquire the ring and rule the world through its power (&quot;Rache-Terzett&quot; - &quot;Vengeance Trio&quot;).

=== Act 3 ===
Prelude to Act 3

==== &quot;Scene 1&quot; ====
In the woods by the bank of the Rhine, the Rhinemaidens swim playfully and sing a song to the Sun, mourning their lost Rhine gold (&quot;Frau Sonne sendet lichte Strahlen&quot;). Siegfried happens by, separated from the hunting party while searching for prey. The Rhinemaidens urge him to return the ring to the Rhine and thus avoid its curse, but he laughs at them in heroic pride and says he prefers to die rather than bargain for his life. They swim away, predicting that Siegfried will die this very day and that his heir, a lady, will treat them more fairly.

==== &quot;Scene 2&quot; ====
Siegfried rejoins the hunters, who include Gunther and Hagen. While resting, he sings them in high spirits a hero&#x27;s song about the adventures of his youth (&quot;Mime hieß ein mürrischer Zwerg&quot;), recounting his life with Mime, the forging of Nothung, slaying the dragon Fafner and understanding the language of birds. Hagen gives him another potion, which restores his memory, and Siegfried tells of discovering the sleeping Brünnhilde and awakening her with a kiss. Upon hearing this, now having the apparent evidence of Siegfried&#x27;s betrayal of the blood-brotherhood in front of Gunther and his men, Hagen stabs Siegfried in the back with his spear, declares that he had avenged perjury and calmly walks away. In his final agony Siegfried recollects the awakening of Brünnhilde and his love for her and with the memory of blessed fear the feeling for Brünnhilde had taught him, seeing her giving him greetings in a vision, dies (&quot;Brünnhilde! Heilige Braut!&quot;). His body is carried away in a solemn funeral procession that forms the interlude as the scene is changed and recapitulates many of the themes associated with Siegfried and the Wälsungs.

Orchestral Interlude - &quot;Siegfrieds Trauermusik&quot; (&quot;Siegfried&#x27;s Funeral March&quot;)
==== &quot;Scene 3&quot; ====
Back in the Gibichung Hall, Gutrune awaits Siegfried&#x27;s return. Hagen arrives ahead of the funeral party. Gutrune is devastated when Siegfried&#x27;s corpse is brought in. Confronted with his sister&#x27;s pain, Gunther blames Siegfried&#x27;s death on Hagen, who replies that Siegfried had incurred the penalty of his false oath. Moreover, he claims the ring on Siegfried&#x27;s finger by right of conquest. When Gunther objects, Hagen appeals to the vassals to support his lawful claim. Gunther draws his sword but Hagen attacks and easily kills him. As he moves to take the ring, however, Siegfried&#x27;s hand rises miraculously in a threatening gesture. Hagen as well as all present recoil in utmost fear.

Brünnhilde, with her features as if transfigured, suddenly makes her entrance (&quot;Schweigt eures Jammers jauchzenden Schwall!&quot;), having in the meantime met on the river&#x27;s shores the daughters of the Rhine, who talked to her about the ring and its curse. She proclaims Siegfried innocent, as she now recognizes that he betrayed her only due to an intrigue, and declares that Siegfried&#x27;s betrayal and death were necessary for her to become all-knowing and completely free. As the queen of the Gibichungs she then issues orders for a huge funeral pyre for the dead hero to be assembled by the river (&quot;Starke Scheite schichtet mir dort&quot;) and takes the ring from Siegfried&#x27;s hand. With her eyes turned upwards to the sky, Brünnhilde in an apostrophe addresses Wotan, the ruler of oaths and laws, and proclaims that the death of the free hero Siegfried has atoned for the god&#x27;s guilt; renouncing and overcoming through the might of grieving love the power of the ring, she bequeaths it to the Rhinemaidens, who are to claim it from her own ashes after fire has cleansed it of its curse, and declares that Wotan can finally truly rest in peace (&quot;Mein Erbe nun nehm&#x27; ich zu eigen&quot;). Brünnhilde then lights the funeral pyre with a firebrand and with &quot;anxiously longed-for tidings&quot; sends Wotan&#x27;s ravens home to command Loge, the god of fire that still burns on her rock, to fly to Valhalla and set it on fire (&quot;Fliegt heim, ihr Raben!&quot;). After a final eulogy to the dead hero, Brünnhilde, willing to be reunited with her love, mounts her horse Grane and as a valkyrie rides into the flames, joining Siegfried in death.

A sequence of leitmotifs portray the fire flaring up, and the hall of the Gibichungs catching fire and collapsing. The Rhine overflows its banks, quenching the flames, and the Rhinemaidens swim in to claim the ring. Hagen in a frenzy tries at the last moment to stop them and seize the ring for himself, but they drag him into the depths and drown him (&quot;Zurück vom Ring!&quot;), the theme of the curse of the ring being then heard for the last time. As they celebrate the return of the Rhinegold to their river and the breaking of its curse, a red glow spreads through the sky. The surviving Gibichungs now see the interior of Valhalla with gods and heroes visible as described by Waltraute in Act I, Scene 3. A new fire flares up around the Hall of the Gods, hiding it from sight; the gods are consumed in flames and the curtain falls. At the very end of the work there emerges the sound of the &quot;Liebeserlösung&quot; motive - the redemption-through-love leitmotif.

==Reactions==
Robert A. Hall Jr. has analysed &quot;Götterdämmerung&quot; in terms of cultural symbolism. Hermann Danuser has discussed the dramaturgy of the ending of &quot;Götterdämmerung&quot; in the context of the entire &quot;Ring&quot; cycle. William Kinderman has evaluated a large-scale instance of musical recapitulation in Act III. Warren J. Darcy has expostulated on the potential influence of Wagner&#x27;s readings of the philosophy of Arthur Schopenhauer on the music of the &quot;Ring&quot; cycle, particularly on the ending of &quot;Götterdämmerung&quot;.

The historian John Roberts suggested that the killing of Siegfried by Hagen with a stab in the back gave inspiration for the myth that the German Army did not lose World War I, but was instead defeated by a treasonous &quot;stab in the back&quot; from civilians, in particular Jews and Socialists.

The German bass Kurt Moll pointed out that the part of the principal villain, Hagen, is unique in the bass repertoire: it requires a shouting, blaring vocal technique that risks damaging the singer&#x27;s voice; only very large-voiced, powerful singers can sing it. Moll himself avoided the role.

Friedrich Nietzsche&#x27;s 1888–1889 book, &quot;Götzendämmerung&quot;—Twilight of the Idols—is a pun on the title of &quot;Götterdämmerung&quot;, with &quot;Götze&quot; being the German word for &quot;idol&quot; or &quot;false god&quot;.

<text>Gilbert and Sullivan refers to the Victorian-era theatrical partnership of the dramatist W. S. Gilbert (1836–1911) and the composer Arthur Sullivan (1842–1900) and to the works they jointly created. The two men collaborated on fourteen comic operas between 1871 and 1896, of which &quot;H.M.S. Pinafore&quot;, &quot;The Pirates of Penzance&quot; and &quot;The Mikado&quot; are among the best known.

Gilbert, who wrote the libretti for these operas, created fanciful &quot;topsy-turvy&quot; worlds where each absurdity is taken to its logical conclusion: fairies rub elbows with British lords, flirting is a capital offence, gondoliers ascend to the monarchy, and pirates emerge as noblemen who have gone astray. Sullivan, six years Gilbert&#x27;s junior, composed the music, contributing memorable melodies that could convey both humour and pathos.

Their operas have enjoyed broad and enduring international success and are still performed frequently throughout the English-speaking world. Gilbert and Sullivan introduced innovations in content and form that directly influenced the development of musical theatre through the 20th century. The operas have also influenced political discourse, literature, film and television and have been widely parodied and pastiched by humorists. The producer Richard D&#x27;Oyly Carte brought Gilbert and Sullivan together and nurtured their collaboration. He built the Savoy Theatre in 1881 to present their joint works (which came to be known as the Savoy Operas) and founded the D&#x27;Oyly Carte Opera Company, which performed and promoted Gilbert and Sullivan&#x27;s works for over a century.

==Beginnings==

===Gilbert before Sullivan===

Gilbert was born in London on 18 November 1836. His father, William, was a naval surgeon who later wrote novels and short stories, some of which included illustrations by his son. In 1861, to supplement his income, the younger Gilbert began writing illustrated stories, poems and articles of his own, many of which would later be mined as inspiration for his plays and operas, particularly Gilbert&#x27;s series of illustrated poems, the &quot;Bab Ballads&quot;.

In the &quot;Bab Ballads&quot; and his early plays, Gilbert developed a unique &quot;topsy-turvy&quot; style in which humour was derived by setting up a ridiculous premise and working out its logical consequences, however absurd. Director and playwright Mike Leigh described the &quot;Gilbertian&quot; style as follows:

Gilbert developed his innovative theories on the art of stage direction, following the playwright and theatrical reformer Tom Robertson. At the time Gilbert began writing, theatre in Britain was in disrepute. Gilbert helped to reform and elevate the respectability of the theatre, especially beginning with his six short family-friendly comic operas, or &quot;entertainments&quot;, for Thomas German Reed.

At a rehearsal for one of these entertainments, &quot;Ages Ago&quot;, in 1870, the composer Frederic Clay introduced Gilbert to his friend, the young composer Arthur Sullivan. Over the next year, before the two first collaborated, Gilbert continued to write humorous verse, stories and plays, including the comic operas &quot;Our Island Home&quot; (1870) and &quot;A Sensation Novel&quot; (1871), and the blank verse comedies &quot;The Princess&quot; (1870), &quot;The Palace of Truth&quot; (1870) and &quot;Pygmalion and Galatea&quot; (1871).

===Sullivan before Gilbert===

Sullivan was born in London on 13 May 1842. His father was a military bandmaster, and by the time Arthur had reached the age of eight, he was proficient with all the instruments in the band. In school he began to compose anthems and songs. In 1856, he received the first Mendelssohn Scholarship and studied at the Royal Academy of Music and then at Leipzig, where he also took up conducting. His graduation piece, completed in 1861, was a suite of incidental music to Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;The Tempest&quot;. Revised and expanded, it was performed at the Crystal Palace in 1862 and was an immediate sensation. He began building a reputation as England&#x27;s most promising young composer, composing a symphony, a concerto, and several overtures, among them the &quot;Overture di Ballo&quot;, in 1870.
His early major works for the voice included &quot;The Masque at Kenilworth&quot; (1864); an oratorio, &quot;The Prodigal Son&quot; (1869); and a dramatic cantata, &quot;On Shore and Sea&quot; (1871). He composed a ballet, &quot;L&#x27;Île Enchantée&quot; (1864) and incidental music for a number of Shakespeare plays. Other early pieces that were praised were his &quot;Symphony in E&quot;, &quot;Cello Concerto&quot;, and &quot;Overture in C (In Memoriam)&quot; (all three of which premiered in 1866). These commissions were not sufficient to keep Sullivan afloat. He worked as a church organist and composed numerous hymns, popular songs, and parlour ballads.

Sullivan&#x27;s first foray into comic opera was &quot;Cox and Box&quot; (1866), written with the librettist F. C. Burnand for an informal gathering of friends. Public performance followed, with W. S. Gilbert (then writing dramatic criticism for the magazine &quot;Fun&quot;) saying that Sullivan&#x27;s score &quot;is, in many places, of too high a class for the grotesquely absurd plot to which it is wedded.&quot; Nonetheless, it proved highly successful, and is still regularly performed today. Sullivan and Burnand&#x27;s second opera, &quot;The Contrabandista&quot; (1867) was not as successful.

==Operas==

===First collaborations===

====&quot;Thespis&quot;====
In 1871, producer John Hollingshead brought Gilbert and Sullivan together to produce a Christmas entertainment, &quot;Thespis&quot;, at his Gaiety Theatre, a large West End house. The piece was an extravaganza in which the classical Greek gods, grown elderly, are temporarily replaced by a troupe of 19th-century actors and actresses, one of whom is the eponymous Thespis, the Greek father of the drama. Its mixture of political satire and grand opera parody mimicked Offenbach&#x27;s &quot;Orpheus in the Underworld&quot; and &quot;La belle Hélène&quot;, which (in translation) then dominated the English musical stage.

&quot;Thespis&quot; opened on Boxing Day and ran for 63 performances. It outran five of its nine competitors for the 1871 holiday season, and its run was extended beyond the length of a normal run at the Gaiety, but no one at the time foresaw that this was the beginning of a great collaboration. Unlike the later Gilbert and Sullivan works, it was hastily prepared, and its nature was more risqué, like Gilbert&#x27;s earlier burlesques, with a broader style of comedy that allowed for improvisation by the actors. Two of the male characters were played by women, whose shapely legs were put on display in a fashion that Gilbert later condemned. The musical score to &quot;Thespis&quot; was never published and is now lost, except for one song that was published separately, a chorus that was re-used in &quot;The Pirates of Penzance&quot;, and the Act II ballet music.

Over the next three years, Gilbert and Sullivan did not have occasion to work together again, but each man became more eminent in his field. Gilbert worked with Frederic Clay on &quot;Happy Arcadia&quot; (1872) and Alfred Cellier on &quot;Topsyturveydom&quot; (1874) and wrote &quot;The Wicked World&quot; (1873), &quot;Sweethearts&quot; (1874) and several other libretti, farces, extravaganzas, fairy comedies, dramas and adaptations. Sullivan completed his &quot;Festival Te Deum&quot; (1872); another oratorio, &quot;The Light of the World&quot; (1873); his only song cycle, &quot;The Window; or, The Song of the Wrens&quot; (1871); incidental music to &quot;The Merry Wives of Windsor&quot; (1874); and more songs, parlour ballads, and hymns, including &quot;Onward, Christian Soldiers&quot; (1872). At the same time, the audience for theatre was growing because of the rapidly expanding British population; improvement in education and the standard of living, especially of the middle class; improving public transport; and installation of street lighting, which made travel home from the theatre safer. The number of pianos manufactured in England doubled between 1870 and 1890 as more people began to play parlour music at home and more theatres and concert halls opened.

====&quot;Trial by Jury&quot;====

In 1874, Gilbert wrote a short libretto on commission from producer-conductor Carl Rosa, whose wife would have played the leading role, but her death in childbirth cancelled the project. Not long afterwards, Richard D&#x27;Oyly Carte was managing the Royalty Theatre and needed a short opera to be played as an afterpiece to Offenbach&#x27;s &quot;La Périchole&quot;. Carte knew about Gilbert&#x27;s libretto for Rosa and suggested that Sullivan write a score for it. Gilbert read the piece to Sullivan in February 1875, and the composer was delighted with it; &quot;Trial by Jury&quot; was composed and staged in a matter of weeks.
The piece is one of Gilbert&#x27;s humorous spoofs of the law and the legal profession, based on his short experience as a barrister. It concerns a breach of promise of marriage suit. The defendant argues that damages should be slight, since &quot;he is such a very bad lot,&quot; while the plaintiff argues that she loves the defendant fervently and seeks &quot;substantial damages.&quot; After much argument, the judge resolves the case by marrying the lovely plaintiff himself. With Sullivan&#x27;s brother, Fred, as the Learned Judge, the opera was a runaway hit, outlasting the run of &quot;La Périchole&quot;. Provincial tours and productions at other theatres quickly followed.

Fred Sullivan was the prototype for the &quot;patter&quot; (comic) baritone roles in the later operas. F. C. Burnand wrote that he &quot;was one of the most naturally &quot;comic little men&quot; I ever came across. He, too, was a first-rate practical musician... As he was the most absurd person, so was he the very kindliest...&quot; Fred&#x27;s creation would serve as a model for the rest of the collaborators&#x27; works, and each of them has a crucial &quot;comic little man&quot; role, as Burnand had put it. The &quot;patter&quot; baritone (or &quot;principal comedian&quot;, as these roles later were called) would often assume the leading role in Gilbert and Sullivan&#x27;s comic operas, and was usually allotted the speedy patter songs.

After the success of &quot;Trial by Jury&quot;, Gilbert and Sullivan were suddenly in demand to write more operas together. Over the next two years, Richard D&#x27;Oyly Carte and Carl Rosa were two of several theatrical managers who negotiated with the team but were unable to come to terms. Carte proposed a revival of &quot;Thespis&quot; for the 1875 Christmas season, which Gilbert and Sullivan would have revised, but he was unable to obtain financing for the project. In early 1876, Carte requested that Gilbert and Sullivan create another one-act opera on the theme of burglars, but this was never completed.

===Early successes===

====&quot;The Sorcerer&quot;====

Carte&#x27;s real ambition was to develop an English form of light opera that would displace the bawdy burlesques and badly translated French operettas then dominating the London stage. He assembled a syndicate and formed the Comedy Opera Company, with Gilbert and Sullivan commissioned to write a comic opera that would serve as the centrepiece for an evening&#x27;s entertainment.
Gilbert found a subject in one of his own short stories, &quot;The Elixir of Love&quot;, which concerned the complications arising when a love potion is distributed to all the residents of a small village. The leading character was a Cockney businessman who happened to be a sorcerer, a purveyor of blessings (not much called for) and curses (very popular). Gilbert and Sullivan were tireless taskmasters, seeing to it that &quot;The Sorcerer&quot; (1877) opened as a fully polished production, in marked contrast to the under-rehearsed &quot;Thespis&quot;. While &quot;The Sorcerer&quot; won critical acclaim, it did not duplicate the success of &quot;Trial by Jury&quot;. Nevertheless, it ran for more than six months, and Carte and his syndicate were sufficiently encouraged to commission another full-length opera from the team.

====&quot;H.M.S. Pinafore&quot;====

Gilbert and Sullivan scored their first international hit with &quot;H.M.S. Pinafore&quot; (1878), satirising the rise of unqualified people to positions of authority and poking good-natured fun at the Royal Navy and the English obsession with social status (building on a theme introduced in &quot;The Sorcerer&quot;, love between members of different social classes). As with many of the Gilbert and Sullivan operas, a surprise twist changes everything dramatically near the end of the story.

Gilbert oversaw the designs of sets and costumes, and he directed the performers on stage. He sought realism in acting, shunned self-conscious interaction with the audience, and insisted on a standard of characterisation in which the characters were never aware of their own absurdity. He insisted that his actors know their words perfectly and obey his stage directions, which was something new to many actors of the day. Sullivan personally oversaw the musical preparation. The result was a crispness and polish new to the English musical theatre. Jessie Bond wrote later:
&quot;H.M.S. Pinafore&quot; ran in London for 571 performances, an exceptional run for the period. Hundreds of unauthorised, or &quot;pirated&quot;, productions of &quot;Pinafore&quot; appeared in America. During the run of &quot;Pinafore&quot;, Richard D&#x27;Oyly Carte split up with his former investors. The disgruntled former partners, who had invested in the production with no return, staged a public fracas, sending a group of thugs to seize the scenery during a performance. Stagehands managed to ward off their backstage attackers. This event cleared the way for Carte, in alliance with Gilbert and Sullivan, to form the D&#x27;Oyly Carte Opera Company, which then produced all their succeeding operas.

The libretto of &quot;H.M.S. Pinafore&quot; relied on stock character types, many of which were familiar from European opera (and some of which grew out of Gilbert&#x27;s earlier association with the German Reeds): the heroic protagonist (tenor) and his love-interest (soprano); the older woman with a secret or a sharp tongue (contralto); the baffled lyric baritone – the girl&#x27;s father; and a classic villain (bass-baritone). Gilbert and Sullivan added the element of the comic patter-singing character. With the success of &quot;H.M.S. Pinafore&quot;, the D&#x27;Oyly Carte repertory and production system was cemented, and each opera would make use of these stock character types. Before &quot;The Sorcerer&quot;, Gilbert had constructed his plays around the established stars of whatever theatre he happened to be writing for, as had been the case with &quot;Thespis&quot; and &quot;Trial by Jury&quot;. Building on the team he had assembled for &quot;The Sorcerer&quot;, Gilbert no longer hired stars; he created them. He and Sullivan selected the performers, writing their operas for ensemble casts rather than individual stars.
The repertory system ensured that the comic patter character who performed the role of the sorcerer, John Wellington Wells, would become the ruler of the Queen&#x27;s navy as Sir Joseph Porter in &quot;H.M.S. Pinafore&quot;, then join the army as Major-General Stanley in &quot;The Pirates of Penzance&quot;, and so on. Similarly, Mrs. Partlet in &quot;The Sorcerer&quot; transformed into Little Buttercup in &quot;Pinafore&quot;, then into Ruth, the piratical maid-of-all-work in &quot;Pirates&quot;. Relatively unknown performers whom Gilbert and Sullivan engaged early in the collaboration would stay with the company for many years, becoming stars of the Victorian stage. These included George Grossmith, the principal comic; Rutland Barrington, the lyric baritone; Richard Temple, the bass-baritone; and Jessie Bond, the mezzo-soprano soubrette.

====&quot;The Pirates of Penzance&quot;====

&quot;The Pirates of Penzance&quot; (New Year&#x27;s Eve, 1879) also poked fun at grand opera conventions, sense of duty, family obligation, the &quot;respectability&quot; of civilisation and the peerage, and the relevance of a liberal education. The story also revisits &quot;Pinafore&quot;″s theme of unqualified people in positions of authority, in the person of the &quot;modern Major-General&quot; who has up-to-date knowledge about everything except the military. The Major-General and his many daughters escape from the tender-hearted Pirates of Penzance, who are all orphans, on the false plea that he is an orphan himself. The pirates learn of the deception and re-capture the Major-General, but when it is revealed that the pirates are all peers, the Major-General bids them: &quot;resume your ranks and legislative duties, and take my daughters, all of whom are beauties!&quot;

The piece premiered in New York rather than London, in an (unsuccessful) attempt to secure the American copyright, and was another big success with both critics and audiences. Gilbert, Sullivan and Carte tried for many years to control the American performance copyrights over their operas, without success. Nevertheless, &quot;Pirates&quot; was a hit both in New York, again spawning numerous imitators, and then in London, and it became one of the most frequently performed, translated and parodied Gilbert and Sullivan works, also enjoying successful 1981 Broadway and 1982 West End revivals by Joseph Papp that continue to influence productions of the opera.

In 1880, Sullivan&#x27;s cantata &quot;The Martyr of Antioch&quot; premiered at the Leeds Triennial Music Festival, with a libretto adapted by Sullivan and Gilbert from an 1822 epic poem by Henry Hart Milman concerning the 3rd-century martyrdom of St. Margaret of Antioch. Sullivan became the conductor of the Leeds festival beginning in 1880 and conducted the performance. The Carl Rosa Opera Company staged the cantata as an opera in 1898.

===Savoy Theatre opens===

====&quot;Patience&quot;====
&quot;Patience&quot; (1881) satirised the aesthetic movement in general and its colourful poets in particular, combining aspects of A. C. Swinburne, Dante Gabriel Rossetti, Oscar Wilde, James McNeill Whistler and others in the rival poets Bunthorne and Grosvenor. Grossmith, who created the role of Bunthorne, based his makeup, wig and costume on Swinburne and especially Whistler, as seen in the adjacent photograph. The work also lampoons male vanity and chauvinism in the military. The story concerns two rival aesthetic poets, who attract the attention of the young ladies of the village, formerly engaged to the members of a cavalry regiment. But both poets are in love with Patience, the village milkmaid, who detests one of them and feels that it is her duty to avoid the other despite her love for him. Richard D&#x27;Oyly Carte was the booking manager for Oscar Wilde, a then lesser-known proponent of aestheticism, and dispatched him on an American lecture tour in conjunction with the opera&#x27;s U.S. run, so that American audiences might better understand what the satire was all about.

During the run of &quot;Patience&quot;, Carte built the large, modern Savoy Theatre, which became the partnership&#x27;s permanent home. It was the first theatre (and the world&#x27;s first public building) to be lit entirely by electric lighting. &quot;Patience&quot; moved into the Savoy after six months at the Opera Comique and ran for a total of 578 performances, surpassing the run of &quot;H.M.S. Pinafore&quot;.

====&quot;Iolanthe&quot;====

&quot;Iolanthe&quot; (1882) was the first of the operas to open at the Savoy. The fully electric Savoy made possible numerous special effects, such as sparkling magic wands for the female chorus of fairies. The opera poked fun at English law and the House of Lords and made much of the war between the sexes. The critics felt that Sullivan&#x27;s work in &quot;Iolanthe&quot; had taken a step forward. &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; commented, &quot;The composer has risen to his opportunity, and we are disposed to account &quot;Iolanthe&quot; his best effort in all the Gilbertian series.&quot; Similarly, &quot;The Theatre&quot; judged that &quot;the music of &quot;Iolanthe&quot; is Dr Sullivan&#x27;s &quot;chef d&#x27;oeuvre&quot;. The quality throughout is more even, and maintained at a higher standard, than in any of his earlier works...&quot;
&quot;Iolanthe&quot; is one of several of Gilbert&#x27;s works, including &quot;The Wicked World&quot; (1873), &quot;Broken Hearts&quot; (1875), &quot;Princess Ida&quot; (1884) and &quot;Fallen Fairies&quot; (1909), where the introduction of men and &quot;mortal love&quot; into a tranquil world of women wreaks havoc with the status quo. Gilbert had created several &quot;fairy comedies&quot; at the Haymarket Theatre in the early 1870s. These plays, influenced by the fairy work of James Planché, are founded upon the idea of self-revelation by characters under the influence of some magic or some supernatural interference.

In 1882, Gilbert had a telephone installed in his home and at the prompt desk at the Savoy Theatre so that he could monitor performances and rehearsals from his home study. Gilbert had referred to the new technology in &quot;Pinafore&quot; in 1878, only two years after the device was invented and before London even had telephone service. Sullivan had one installed as well, and on 13 May 1883, at a party to celebrate the composer&#x27;s 41st birthday, the guests, including the Prince of Wales (later Edward VII), heard a direct relay of parts of &quot;Iolanthe&quot; from the Savoy. This was probably the first live &quot;broadcast&quot; of an opera.

During the run of &quot;Iolanthe&quot;, in 1883, Sullivan was knighted by Queen Victoria. Although it was the operas with Gilbert that had earned him the broadest fame, the honour was conferred for his services to serious music. The musical establishment, and many critics, believed that this should put an end to his career as a composer of comic opera – that a musical knight should not stoop below oratorio or grand opera. Sullivan, despite the financial security of writing for the Savoy, increasingly viewed his work with Gilbert as unimportant, beneath his skills, and repetitious. Furthermore, he was unhappy that he had to simplify his music to ensure that Gilbert&#x27;s words could be heard. But paradoxically, in February 1883, just after &quot;Iolanthe&quot; opened, Sullivan had signed a five-year agreement with Gilbert and Carte requiring him to produce a new comic opera on six months&#x27; notice.

====&quot;Princess Ida&quot;====
&quot;Princess Ida&quot; (1884) spoofed women&#x27;s education and male chauvinism and continued the theme from &quot;Iolanthe&quot; of the war between the sexes. The opera is based on Tennyson&#x27;s poem &quot;The Princess: A Medley&quot;. Gilbert had written a blank verse farce based on the same material in 1870, called &quot;The Princess&quot;, and he reused a good deal of the dialogue from his earlier play in the libretto of &quot;Princess Ida&quot;. &quot;Ida&quot; is the only Gilbert and Sullivan work with dialogue entirely in blank verse and is also the only one of their works in three acts. Lillian Russell had been engaged to create the title role, but Gilbert did not believe that she was dedicated enough, and when she missed a rehearsal, he dismissed her.

&quot;Princess Ida&quot; was the first of the Gilbert and Sullivan operas that, by the partnership&#x27;s previous standards, was not a success. A particularly hot summer in London did not help ticket sales. The piece ran for a comparatively short 246 performances and was not revived in London until 1919. Sullivan had been satisfied with the libretto, but two months after &quot;Ida&quot; opened, Sullivan told Carte that &quot;it is impossible for me to do another piece of the character of those already written by Gilbert and myself.&quot; As &quot;Princess Ida&quot; showed signs of flagging, Carte realised that, for the first time in the partnership&#x27;s history, no new opera would be ready when the old one closed. On 22 March 1884, he gave Gilbert and Sullivan contractual notice that a new opera would be required in six months&#x27; time. In the meantime, when &quot;Ida&quot; closed, Carte produced a revival of &quot;The Sorcerer&quot;.

===Dodging the magic lozenge===

====&quot;The Mikado&quot;====
The most successful of the Savoy Operas was &quot;The Mikado&quot; (1885), which made fun of English bureaucracy, thinly disguised by a Japanese setting. Gilbert initially proposed a story for a new opera about a magic lozenge that would change the characters, which Sullivan found artificial and lacking in &quot;human interest and probability&quot;, as well as being too similar to their earlier opera, &quot;The Sorcerer&quot;. As dramatised in the film &quot;Topsy-Turvy&quot;, the author and composer were at an impasse until 8 May 1884, when Gilbert dropped the lozenge idea and agreed to provide a libretto without any supernatural elements.

The story focuses on a &quot;cheap tailor&quot;, Ko-Ko, who is promoted to the position of Lord High Executioner of the town of Titipu. He loves his ward, Yum-Yum, but she loves a musician, who is really the son of the emperor of Japan (the Mikado) and who is in disguise to escape the attentions of the elderly and amorous Katisha. The Mikado has decreed that executions must resume without delay in Titipu. When news arrives that the Mikado will be visiting the town, Ko-Ko assumes that he is coming to ascertain whether Ko-Ko has carried out the executions. Too timid to execute anyone, Ko-Ko cooks up a conspiracy to misdirect the Mikado, which goes awry. Eventually, Ko-Ko must persuade Katisha to marry him to save his own life and the lives of the other conspirators.

With the opening of trade between England and Japan, Japanese imports, art and styles became fashionable, and a Japanese village exhibition opened in Knightsbridge, London, making the time ripe for an opera set in Japan. Gilbert said, &quot;I cannot give you a good reason for our... piece being laid in Japan. It... afforded scope for picturesque treatment, scenery and costume, and I think that the idea of a chief magistrate, who is... judge and actual executioner in one, and yet would not hurt a worm, may perhaps please the public.&quot;

Setting the opera in Japan, an exotic locale far away from Britain, allowed Gilbert and Sullivan to satirise British politics and institutions more freely by clothing them in superficial Japanese trappings. Gilbert wrote, &quot;The Mikado of the opera was an imaginary monarch of a remote period and cannot by any exercise of ingenuity be taken to be a slap on an existing institution.&quot; G. K. Chesterton compared it to Swift&#x27;s &quot;Gulliver&#x27;s Travels&quot;: &quot;Gilbert pursued and persecuted the evils of modern England till they had literally not a leg to stand on, exactly as Swift did... I doubt if there is a single joke in the whole play that fits the Japanese. But all the jokes in the play fit the English. ... About England Pooh-bah is something more than a satire; he is the truth.&quot; Several of the later operas are similarly set in foreign or fictional locales, including &quot;The Gondoliers&quot;, &quot;Utopia, Limited&quot; and &quot;The Grand Duke&quot;.
&quot;The Mikado&quot; became the partnership&#x27;s longest-running hit, enjoying 672 performances at the Savoy Theatre, and surpassing the runs of &quot;Pinafore&quot; and &quot;Patience&quot;. It remains the most frequently performed Savoy Opera. It has been translated into numerous languages and is one of the most frequently played musical theatre pieces in history.

====&quot;Ruddigore&quot;====

&quot;Ruddigore&quot; (1887), a topsy-turvy take on Victorian melodrama, was less successful than most of the earlier collaborations with a run of 288 performances. The original title, &quot;Ruddygore&quot;, together with some of the plot devices, including the revivification of ghosts, drew negative comments from critics. Gilbert and Sullivan respelled the title and made a number of changes and cuts. Nevertheless, the piece was profitable, and the reviews were not all bad. For instance, &quot;The Illustrated London News&quot; praised the work and both Gilbert and, especially, Sullivan: &quot;Sir Arthur Sullivan has eminently succeeded alike in the expression of refined sentiment and comic humour. In the former respect, the charm of graceful melody prevails; while, in the latter, the music of the most grotesque situations is redolent of fun.&quot; Further changes were made, including a new overture, when Rupert D&#x27;Oyly Carte revived &quot;Ruddigore&quot; after the First World War, and the piece was regularly performed by the D&#x27;Oyly Carte Opera Company thereafter.

Some of the plot elements of &quot;Ruddigore&quot; were introduced by Gilbert in his earlier one-act opera, &quot;Ages Ago&quot; (1869), including the tale of the wicked ancestor and the device of the ghostly ancestors stepping out of their portraits. When &quot;Ruddigore&quot; closed, no new opera was ready. Gilbert again proposed a version of the &quot;lozenge&quot; plot for their next opera, and Sullivan reiterated his reluctance to set it. While the two men worked out their artistic differences, and Sullivan finished other obligations, Carte produced revivals of such old favourites as &quot;H.M.S. Pinafore&quot;, &quot;The Pirates of Penzance&quot;, and &quot;The Mikado&quot;.

====&quot;The Yeomen of the Guard&quot;====

&quot;The Yeomen of the Guard&quot; (1888), their only joint work with a serious ending, concerns a pair of strolling players – a jester and a singing girl – who are caught up in a risky intrigue at the Tower of London during the 16th century. The dialogue, though in prose, is quasi-Early Modern English in style, and there is no satire of British institutions. For some of the plot elements, Gilbert had reached back to his 1875 tragedy, &quot;Broken Hearts&quot;. &quot;The Times&quot; praised the libretto: &quot;It should... be acknowledged that Mr. Gilbert has earnestly endeavoured to leave familiar grooves and rise to higher things&quot;. Although not a grand opera, the new libretto provided Sullivan with the opportunity to write his most ambitious theatre score to date. The critics, who had recently lauded the composer for his successful oratorio, &quot;The Golden Legend&quot;, considered the score to &quot;Yeomen&quot; to be Sullivan&#x27;s finest, including its overture, which was written in sonata form, rather than as a sequential pot-pourri of tunes from the opera, as in most of his other overtures. The &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; said:

&quot;Yeomen&quot; was a hit, running for over a year, with strong New York and touring productions. During the run, on 12 March 1889, Sullivan wrote to Gilbert,

Sullivan insisted that the next opera must be a grand opera. Gilbert did not feel that he could write a grand opera libretto, but he offered a compromise that Sullivan eventually accepted. The two would write a light opera for the Savoy, and at the same time, Sullivan a grand opera (&quot;Ivanhoe&quot;) for a new theatre that Carte was constructing to present British opera. After a brief impasse over the choice of subject, Sullivan accepted an idea connected with Venice and Venetian life, as &quot;this seemed to me to hold out great chances of bright colour and taking music.&quot;

====&quot;The Gondoliers&quot;====
&quot;The Gondoliers&quot; (1889) takes place partly in Venice and partly in a fictional kingdom ruled by a pair of gondoliers who attempt to remodel the monarchy in a spirit of &quot;republican equality.&quot; Gilbert recapitulates a number of his earlier themes, including the satire of class distinctions figuring in many of his earlier librettos. The libretto also reflects Gilbert&#x27;s fascination with the &quot;Stock Company Act&quot;, highlighting the absurd convergence of natural persons and legal entities, which plays an even larger part in the next opera, &quot;Utopia, Limited&quot;. Press accounts were almost entirely favourable. The &quot;Illustrated London News&quot; reported:

Sullivan&#x27;s old collaborator on &quot;Cox and Box&quot; (later the editor of &quot;Punch&quot; magazine), F. C. Burnand, wrote to the composer: &quot;Magnificento!...I envy you and W.S.G. being able to place a piece like this on the stage in so complete a fashion.&quot; The opera enjoyed a run longer than any of their other joint works except for &quot;H.M.S. Pinafore&quot;, &quot;Patience&quot; and &quot;The Mikado&quot;. There was a command performance of &quot;The Gondoliers&quot; for Queen Victoria and the royal family at Windsor Castle in 1891, the first Gilbert and Sullivan opera to be so honoured. &quot;The Gondoliers&quot; was Gilbert and Sullivan&#x27;s last great success.

===Carpet quarrel===
Though Gilbert and Sullivan&#x27;s working relationship was mostly cordial and even friendly, it sometimes became strained, especially during their later operas, partly because each man saw himself as allowing his work to be subjugated to the other&#x27;s, and partly caused by the opposing personalities of the two: Gilbert was often confrontational and notoriously thin-skinned (though prone to acts of extraordinary kindness), while Sullivan eschewed conflict. Gilbert imbued his libretti with absurdist &quot;topsy-turvy&quot; situations in which the social order was turned upside down. After a time, these subjects were often at odds with Sullivan&#x27;s desire for realism and emotional content. Gilbert&#x27;s political satire often poked fun at the wealthy and powerful whom Sullivan sought out for friendship and patronage.
Gilbert and Sullivan disagreed several times over the choice of a subject. After each of &quot;Princess Ida&quot; and &quot;Ruddigore&quot;, which were less successful than their seven other operas from &quot;H.M.S. Pinafore&quot; to &quot;The Gondoliers&quot;, Sullivan asked to leave the partnership, saying that he found Gilbert&#x27;s plots repetitive and that the operas were not artistically satisfying to him. While the two artists worked out their differences in those cases, Carte kept the Savoy open with revivals of their earlier works. On each occasion, after a few months&#x27; pause, Gilbert responded with a libretto that met Sullivan&#x27;s objections, and the partnership was able to continue.

In April 1890, during the run of &quot;The Gondoliers&quot;, Gilbert challenged Carte over the expenses of the production. Among other items to which Gilbert objected, Carte had charged the cost of a new carpet for the Savoy Theatre lobby to the partnership. Gilbert believed that this was a maintenance expense that should be charged to Carte alone. Gilbert confronted Carte, who refused to reconsider the accounts. Gilbert stormed out and wrote to Sullivan that &quot;I left him with the remark that it was a mistake to kick down the ladder by which he had risen&quot;. Helen Carte wrote that Gilbert had addressed Carte &quot;in a way that I should not have thought you would have used to an offending menial&quot;. On 5 May 1890, Gilbert wrote to Sullivan: &quot;The time for putting an end to our collaboration has at last arrived. … I am writing a letter to Carte ... giving him notice that he is not to produce or perform any of my libretti after Christmas 1890.&quot; As biographer Andrew Crowther has explained:


Things soon degraded, Gilbert lost his temper with his partners and brought a lawsuit against Carte. Sullivan supported Carte by making an affidavit erroneously stating that there were minor legal expenses outstanding from a battle Gilbert had in 1884 with Lillian Russell when, in fact, those expenses had already been paid. When Gilbert discovered this, he asked for a retraction of the affidavit; Sullivan refused. Gilbert felt it was a moral issue and could not look past it. Sullivan felt that Gilbert was questioning his good faith, and in any event Sullivan had other reasons to stay in Carte&#x27;s good graces: Carte was building a new theatre, the Royal English Opera House (now the Palace Theatre), to produce Sullivan&#x27;s only grand opera, &quot;Ivanhoe&quot;. After &quot;The Gondoliers&quot; closed in 1891, Gilbert withdrew the performance rights to his libretti, vowing to write no more operas for the Savoy.

Gilbert next wrote &quot;The Mountebanks&quot; with Alfred Cellier and the flop &quot;Haste to the Wedding&quot; with George Grossmith, and Sullivan wrote &quot;Haddon Hall&quot; with Sydney Grundy. Gilbert eventually won the lawsuit, but his actions and statements had been hurtful to his partners. Nevertheless, the partnership had been so profitable that, after the financial failure of the Royal English Opera House, Carte and his wife sought to reunite the author and composer. In late 1891, after many failed attempts at reconciliation, Gilbert and Sullivan&#x27;s music publisher, Tom Chappell, stepped in to mediate between two of his most profitable artists, and within two weeks he had succeeded, eventually leading to two further collaborations between Gilbert and Sullivan.

===Last works===

&quot;Utopia, Limited&quot; (1893), their penultimate opera, was a very modest success, and their last, &quot;The Grand Duke&quot; (1896), was an outright failure. Neither work entered the canon of regularly performed Gilbert and Sullivan works until the D&#x27;Oyly Carte Opera Company made the first complete professional recordings of the two operas in the 1970s. Gilbert had also offered Sullivan another libretto, &quot;His Excellency&quot; (1894), but Gilbert&#x27;s insistence on casting Nancy McIntosh, his protege from &quot;Utopia&quot;, led to Sullivan&#x27;s refusal, and &quot;His Excellency&quot; was instead composed by F. Osmond Carr. Meanwhile, the Savoy Theatre continued to revive the Gilbert and Sullivan operas, in between new pieces, and D&#x27;Oyly Carte touring companies also played them in repertory.
After &quot;The Grand Duke&quot;, the partners saw no reason to work together again. A last unpleasant misunderstanding occurred in 1898. At the premiere of Sullivan&#x27;s opera &quot;The Beauty Stone&quot; on 28 May, Gilbert arrived at the Savoy Theatre with friends, assuming that Sullivan had reserved some seats for him. Instead, he was informed that Sullivan objected to his presence. The composer later denied that this was true. The last time they met was at the Savoy Theatre on 17 November 1898 at the celebration of the 21st anniversary of the first performance of &quot;The Sorcerer&quot;. They did not speak to each other. Sullivan, by this time in exceedingly poor health, died in 1900, although to the end he continued to write new comic operas for the Savoy with other librettists, most successfully with Basil Hood in &quot;The Rose of Persia&quot; (1899). Gilbert also wrote several works, some with other collaborators, in the 1890s. By the time of Sullivan&#x27;s death in 1900, Gilbert wrote that any memory of their rift had been &quot;completely bridged over,&quot; and &quot;the most cordial relations existed between us.&quot; He stated that &quot;Sullivan ... because he was a composer of the rarest genius, was as modest and as unassuming as a neophyte should be, but seldom is...I remember all that he has done for me in allowing his genius to shed some of its lustre upon my humble name.&quot;

Richard D&#x27;Oyly Carte died in 1901, and his widow, Helen, continued to direct the activities of the D&#x27;Oyly Carte Opera Company at the Savoy and on tour. Gilbert went into semi-retirement, although he continued to direct revivals of the Savoy Operas and wrote new plays occasionally. Between 1906 and 1909, he assisted Mrs. Carte in staging two repertory seasons at the Savoy Theatre. These were very popular and revived interest in the works. Gilbert was knighted during the first repertory season. After Sullivan&#x27;s death, Gilbert wrote only one more comic opera, &quot;Fallen Fairies&quot; (1909; music by Edward German), which was not a success.

==Legacy and assessment==
Gilbert died in 1911, and Richard&#x27;s son, Rupert D&#x27;Oyly Carte, took over the opera company upon his step-mother&#x27;s death in 1913. His daughter, Bridget, inherited the company upon his death in 1948. The D&#x27;Oyly Carte Opera Company toured nearly year-round, except for its many London seasons and foreign tours, performing exclusively the Gilbert and Sullivan operas, until it closed in 1982. During the 20th century, the company gave well over 35,000 performances. The Savoy operas, from the beginning, were produced extensively in North America and Australasia, and soon afterwards in Germany, Russia, and elsewhere in Europe and around the world.
In 1922, Sir Henry Wood explained the enduring success of the collaboration as follows:
G. K. Chesterton similarly praised the combination of the two artists, anticipating the operas&#x27; success into the &quot;remote future&quot;. He wrote that Gilbert&#x27;s satire was &quot;too intelligent to be intelligible&quot; by itself, and that perhaps only Sullivan could have given &quot;wings to his words ... in exactly the right degree frivolous and exactly the right degree fastidious. [The words&#x27;] precise degree of levity and distance from reality ... seemed to be expressed ... in the very notes of the music; almost ... in the note of the laughter that followed it.&quot; In 1957, a review in &quot;The Times&quot; gave this rationale for &quot;the continued vitality of the Savoy operas&quot;:
Because of the unusual success of the operas, the D&#x27;Oyly Carte Opera Company were able, from the start, to license the works to other professional companies, such as the J. C. Williamson Gilbert and Sullivan Opera Company, and to amateur troupes. For almost a century, until the British copyrights expired at the end of 1961, and even afterwards, the D&#x27;Oyly Carte Opera Company influenced productions of the operas worldwide, creating a &quot;performing tradition&quot; for most of the operas that is still referred to today by many directors, both amateur and professional. Indeed, Gilbert, Sullivan and Carte had an important influence on amateur theatre. Cellier and Bridgeman wrote in 1914 that, prior to the creation of the Savoy operas, amateur actors were treated with contempt by professionals. After the formation of amateur Gilbert and Sullivan companies in the 1880s licensed to perform the operas, professionals recognised that the amateur performing groups &quot;support the culture of music and the drama. They are now accepted as useful training schools for the legitimate stage, and from the volunteer ranks have sprung many present-day favourites.&quot; Cellier and Bridgeman attributed the rise in quality and reputation of the amateur groups largely to &quot;the popularity of, and infectious craze for performing, the Gilbert and Sullivan operas&quot;. The National Operatic and Dramatic Association (NODA) was founded in 1899. It reported, in 1914, that nearly 200 British troupes were performing Gilbert and Sullivan that year, constituting most of the amateur companies in the country (this figure included only the societies that were members of NODA). The association further reported that almost 1,000 performances of the Savoy operas had been given in Britain that year, many of them to benefit charities. Cellier and Bridgeman noted that strong amateur groups were performing the operas in places as far away as New Zealand. In the U.S., and elsewhere where British copyrights on the operas were not enforced, both professional and amateur companies performed the works throughout the 20th century – the Internet Broadway Database counts about 150 productions on Broadway alone from 1900 to 1960. The Savoy Company, an amateur group formed in 1901 in Philadelphia, continues to perform today. In 1948, &quot;Life&quot; magazine reported that about 5,000 performances of Gilbert and Sullivan operas were given annually in the US, exceeding the number of performances of Shakespeare plays.

After the copyrights on the operas expired, other professional companies were free to perform and record the operas, even in Britain and The Commonwealth. Many performing companies arose to produce the works, such as Gilbert and Sullivan for All in Britain, and existing companies, such as English National Opera, Carl Rosa Opera Company and Australian Opera, added Gilbert and Sullivan to their repertories. The operas were presented by professional repertory companies in the US, including the competing Light Opera of Manhattan and NYGASP in New York City. In 1980, a Broadway and West End production of &quot;Pirates&quot; produced by Joseph Papp brought new audiences to Gilbert and Sullivan. Between 1988 and 2003, a new iteration of the D&#x27;Oyly Carte Opera Company revived the operas on tour and in the West End. Today, various professional repertory companies, such as NYGASP, Opera della Luna, National Gilbert &amp; Sullivan Opera Company, Opera North, Ohio Light Opera, Scottish Opera and other regional opera companies, and numerous amateur societies, churches, schools and universities continue to produce the works. The most popular G&amp;S works also continue to be performed from time to time by major opera companies, and recordings of the operas, overtures and songs from the operas continue to be released. Since 1994, the International Gilbert and Sullivan Festival has been held every August in England (except 2020), with some two dozen or more performances of the operas given on the main stage, and several dozen related &quot;fringe&quot; events given in smaller venues. The Festival records and offers videos of its most popular professional and amateur productions. In connection with the 2009 festival, a contemporary critic wrote, &quot;The appeal of G&amp;S&#x27;s special blend of charm, silliness and gentle satire seems immune to fashion.&quot; There continue to be hundreds of amateur companies performing the Gilbert and Sullivan works worldwide.

===Recordings and broadcasts===

The first commercial recordings of individual numbers from the Savoy operas began in 1898. In 1917 the Gramophone Company (HMV) produced the first album of a complete Gilbert and Sullivan opera, &quot;The Mikado&quot;, followed by recordings of eight more. Electrical recordings of most of the operas were then issued by HMV and Victor, beginning in the late 1920s, supervised by Rupert D&#x27;Oyly Carte. The D&#x27;Oyly Carte Opera Company continued to produce well-regarded recordings until 1979, helping to keep the operas popular through the decades. Many of these recordings have been reissued on CD. After the company was revived in 1988, it recorded seven of the operas.

After the copyrights on the operas expired, numerous companies around the world released popular audio and video recordings of the operas. In 1966 and again in the 1980s, BBC Radio presented complete cycles of the thirteen extant Gilbert and Sullivan operas, with dialogue. Ad hoc casts of operatic singers conducted by Sir Malcolm Sargent in the 1950s and 60s and Sir Charles Mackerras in the 1990s have made audio sets of several Savoy operas, and in the 1980s Alexander Faris conducted video recordings of eleven of the operas (omitting the last two) with casts including show-business stars as well as professional singers. Joseph Papp&#x27;s Broadway production of &quot;The Pirates of Penzance&quot; was put on record in 1981. Since 1994, the International Gilbert and Sullivan Festival has released numerous professional and amateur CDs and videos of its productions. Ohio Light Opera has recorded several of the operas in the 21st century. The Really Authentic Gilbert and Sullivan Performance Trust (RAGSPT) of Dunedin, New Zealand, recorded all 13 extant Savoy Operas between 2002 and 2012 and licensed the recordings on Creative Commons.

===Cultural influence===
For nearly 150 years, Gilbert and Sullivan have pervasively influenced popular culture in the English-speaking world, and lines and quotations from their operas have become part of the English language (even if not originated by Gilbert), such as &quot;short, sharp shock&quot;, &quot;What never? Well, hardly ever!&quot;, &quot;let the punishment fit the crime&quot;, and &quot;A policeman&#x27;s lot is not a happy one&quot;. The operas have influenced political style and discourse, literature, film and television, have been widely parodied by humorists, and have been quoted in legal rulings.

The American and British musical owes a tremendous debt to G&amp;S, who were admired and copied by early musical theatre authors and composers such as Ivan Caryll, Adrian Ross, Lionel Monckton, P. G. Wodehouse, Guy Bolton and Victor Herbert, and later Jerome Kern, Ira Gershwin, Yip Harburg, Irving Berlin, Ivor Novello, Oscar Hammerstein II, and Andrew Lloyd Webber. Gilbert&#x27;s lyrics served as a model for such 20th-century Broadway lyricists as Cole Porter, Ira Gershwin, and Lorenz Hart. Noël Coward wrote: &quot;I was born into a generation that still took light music seriously. The lyrics and melodies of Gilbert and Sullivan were hummed and strummed into my consciousness at an early age. My father sang them, my mother played them, my nurse, Emma, breathed them through her teeth... My aunts and uncles... sang them singly and in unison at the slightest provocation...&quot;

Professor Carolyn Williams has noted: &quot;The influence of Gilbert and Sullivan – their wit and sense of irony, the send ups of politics and contemporary culture – goes beyond musical theater to comedy in general. Allusions to their work have made their way into our own popular culture&quot;. Gilbert and Sullivan expert and enthusiast Ian Bradley agrees:

The works of Gilbert and Sullivan are themselves frequently pastiched and parodied. Well known examples of this include Tom Lehrer&#x27;s &quot;The Elements&quot; and &quot;Clementine&quot;; Allan Sherman&#x27;s &quot;I&#x27;m Called Little Butterball&quot;, &quot;When I Was a Lad&quot;, &quot;You Need an Analyst&quot; and &quot;The Bronx Bird-Watcher&quot;; and The Two Ronnies&#x27; 1973 Christmas Special. Other comedians have used Gilbert and Sullivan songs as a key part of their routines, including Hinge and Bracket, Anna Russell, and the &quot;HMS Yakko&quot; episode of the animated TV series &quot;Animaniacs&quot;. Songs from Gilbert and Sullivan are often pastiched in advertising, and elaborate advertising parodies have been published, as have the likenesses of various Gilbert and Sullivan performers throughout the decades. Gilbert and Sullivan comic operas are commonly referenced in literature, film and television in various ways that include extensive use of Sullivan&#x27;s music or where action occurs during a performance of a Gilbert and Sullivan opera, such as in the film &quot;The Girl Said No&quot;. There are also a number of Gilbert and Sullivan biographical films, such as Mike Leigh&#x27;s &quot;Topsy-Turvy&quot; (1999) and &quot;The Story of Gilbert and Sullivan&quot; (1953), as well as shows about the partnership, including a 1938 Broadway show, &quot;Knights of Song&quot; and a 1975 West End show called &quot;Tarantara! Tarantara!&quot;

It is not surprising, given the focus of Gilbert on politics, that politicians and political observers have often found inspiration in these works. Chief Justice of the United States William Rehnquist added gold stripes to his judicial robes after seeing them used by the Lord Chancellor in a production of &quot;Iolanthe&quot;. Alternatively, Lord Chancellor Charles Falconer is recorded as objecting so strongly to &quot;Iolanthe&quot;&#x27;s comic portrayal of Lord Chancellors that he supported moves to disband the office. British politicians, beyond quoting some of the more famous lines, have delivered speeches in the form of Gilbert and Sullivan pastiches. These include Conservative Peter Lilley&#x27;s speech mimicking the form of &quot;I&#x27;ve got a little list&quot; from &quot;The Mikado&quot;, listing those he was against, including &quot;sponging socialists&quot; and &quot;young ladies who get pregnant just to jump the housing queue&quot;.

===Overtures===
The overtures from the Gilbert and Sullivan operas remain popular, and there are many recordings of them. Most of them are structured as a &quot;potpourri&quot; of tunes from the operas. They are generally well-orchestrated, but not all of them were composed by Sullivan. However, even those delegated to his assistants were based on an outline he provided, and in many cases incorporated his suggestions or corrections. Sullivan invariably conducted them (as well as the entire operas) on opening night, and they were included in the published scores approved by Sullivan.

Those Sullivan wrote himself include the overtures to &quot;Thespis&quot;, &quot;Iolanthe&quot;, &quot;Princess Ida&quot;, &quot;The Yeomen of the Guard&quot;, &quot;The Gondoliers&quot; and &quot;The Grand Duke&quot;. Sullivan&#x27;s authorship of the overture to &quot;Utopia, Limited&quot; cannot be verified with certainty, as his autograph score is now lost, but it is likely attributable to him, as it consists of only a few bars of introduction, followed by a straight copy of music heard elsewhere in the opera (the Drawing Room scene). &quot;Thespis&quot; is now lost, but there is no doubt that Sullivan wrote its overture. Very early performances of &quot;The Sorcerer&quot; used a section of Sullivan&#x27;s incidental music to Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Henry the VIII&quot;, as he did not have time to write a new overture, but this was replaced in 1884 by one executed by Hamilton Clarke. Of those remaining, the overtures to &quot;H.M.S. Pinafore&quot; and &quot;The Pirates of Penzance&quot; are by Alfred Cellier, the overture to &quot;Patience&quot; is by Eugene d&#x27;Albert, The overtures to &quot;The Mikado&quot; and &quot;Ruddigore&quot; are by Hamilton Clarke (although the &quot;Ruddigore&quot; overture was later replaced by one written by Geoffrey Toye).

Most of the overtures are in three sections: a lively introduction, a slow middle section, and a concluding allegro in sonata form, with two subjects, a brief development, a recapitulation and a coda. Sullivan himself did not always follow this pattern. The overture to &quot;Princess Ida&quot;, for instance, has only an opening fast section and a concluding slow section. The overture to &quot;Utopia Limited&quot; is dominated by a slow section, with only a very brief original passage introducing it.

In the 1920s, the D&#x27;Oyly Carte Opera Company commissioned its musical director at the time, Geoffrey Toye, to write new overtures for &quot;Ruddigore&quot; and &quot;The Pirates of Penzance&quot;. Toye&#x27;s &quot;Ruddigore&quot; overture entered the general repertory, and today is more often heard than the original overture by Clarke. Toye&#x27;s &quot;Pirates&quot; overture did not last long and is now presumed lost. Sir Malcolm Sargent devised a new ending for the overture to &quot;The Gondoliers&quot;, adding the &quot;cachucha&quot; from the second act of the opera. This gave the &quot;Gondoliers&quot; overture the familiar fast-slow-fast pattern of most of the rest of the Savoy Opera overtures, and this version has competed for popularity with Sullivan&#x27;s original version.

==Alternative versions==

===Translations===
Gilbert and Sullivan operas have been translated into many languages, including Yiddish, Hebrew, Portuguese, Swedish, Dutch, Danish, Estonian, Hungarian, Russian, Japanese, French, Italian, Spanish (reportedly including a zarzuela-style &quot;Pinafore&quot;), Catalan and others.

There are many German versions of Gilbert and Sullivan operas, including the popular &quot;Der Mikado&quot;. There is even a German version of &quot;The Grand Duke&quot;. Some German translations of the operas were made by Friedrich Zell and Richard Genée, librettists of &quot;Die Fledermaus&quot; and other Viennese operettas, who even translated one of Sullivan&#x27;s lesser-known operas, &quot;The Chieftain&quot;, as &quot;(Der Häuptling)&quot;.

===Ballets===
* &quot;Pineapple Poll&quot;, created by John Cranko in 1951 at Sadler&#x27;s Wells Theatre; in repertoire at the Birmingham Royal Ballet. The ballet is based on Gilbert&#x27;s 1870 Bab Ballad &quot;The Bumboat Woman&#x27;s Story&quot;, as is &quot;H.M.S. Pinafore&quot;. Cranko expanded the plotline of Gilbert&#x27;s poem and added a happy ending. The music is arranged by Sir Charles Mackerras from themes by Sullivan.
* &quot;Pirates of Penzance - The Ballet!&quot;, created for the Queensland Ballet in 1991

===Adaptations===

Gilbert adapted the stories of &quot;H.M.S. Pinafore&quot; and &quot;The Mikado&quot; into children&#x27;s books called &quot;The Pinafore Picture Book&quot; and &quot;The Story of The Mikado&quot; giving, in some cases, backstory that is not found in the librettos. Many other children&#x27;s books have since been written retelling the stories of the operas or adapting characters or events from them. In the 19th century, the most popular Gilbert and Sullivan songs and music were adapted as dance pieces.

Many musical theatre and film adaptations of the operas have been produced, including the following:
* &quot;The Swing Mikado&quot; (1938; Chicago – all-black cast)
* &quot;The Hot Mikado&quot; (1939) and &quot;Hot Mikado&quot; (1986)
* &quot;The Jazz Mikado&quot; (1927, Berlin)
* &quot;Hollywood Pinafore&quot; (1945)
* &quot;The Cool Mikado&quot; (1962 film)
* &quot;The Black Mikado&quot; (1975)
* &quot;Dick Deadeye, or Duty Done&quot; (1975 animated film)
* &quot;The Pirate Movie&quot; (1982 film)
* &quot;The Ratepayers&#x27; Iolanthe&quot; (1984; Olivier Award-winning musical) adapted by Ned Sherrin and Alistair Beaton
* &quot;The Metropolitan Mikado&quot; (political satire adapted by Sherrin and Beaton, first performed at Queen Elizabeth Hall (1985) starring Louise Gold, Simon Butteriss, Rosemary Ashe, Robert Meadmore and Martin Smith)
* &quot;Di Yam Gazlonim&quot; by Al Grand (1986; a Yiddish adaptation of &quot;Pirates&quot;; a New York production was nominated for a 2007 Drama Desk Award)
* &quot;Pinafore! (A Saucy, Sexy, Ship-Shape New Musical)&quot; (adapted by Mark Savage, first performed at the Celebration Theater in Los Angeles, California in 2001; only one character is female, and all but one of the male characters are gay.
* &quot;Gondoliers&quot;: A Mafia-themed adaptation of the opera, broadly rewritten by John Doyle and orchestrated and arranged Sarah Travis, was given at the Watermill Theatre and transferred to the Apollo Theatre in the West End in 2001. The production used Doyle&#x27;s signature conceit of the actors playing their own orchestra instruments.
* &quot;Parson&#x27;s Pirates&quot; by Opera della Luna (2002)
* &quot;The Ghosts of Ruddigore&quot; by Opera della Luna (2003)
* &quot;Pinafore Swing&quot;, Watermill Theatre (2004: another Doyle adaptation in which the actors double as the orchestra)

<text>Garfield is an American comic strip created by Jim Davis. Originally published locally as &quot;Jon&quot; in 1976 (later changed to &quot;Garfield&quot; in 1977), then in nationwide syndication from 1978, it chronicles the life of the title character Garfield the cat, Odie the dog, and their owner Jon Arbuckle. As of 2013, it was syndicated in roughly 2,580 newspapers and journals; the comic held the Guinness World Record for being the world&#x27;s most widely syndicated comic strip.

Though its setting is rarely mentioned in print, &quot;Garfield&quot; takes place in Jim Davis&#x27;s hometown of Muncie, Indiana, according to the television special &quot;Happy Birthday, Garfield&quot;. Common themes in the strip include Garfield&#x27;s laziness, obsessive eating, love of coffee and lasagna, disdain of Mondays, and dieting. Garfield is also shown to manipulate people to get whatever he wants. The strip&#x27;s focus is mostly on the interactions among Garfield, Jon, and Odie, but other recurring characters appear as well.

&quot;Garfield&quot; has been adapted into various other forms of media. Several half-hour television specials aired on CBS between 1982 and 1991, starting with &quot;Here Comes Garfield&quot; and ending with &quot;Garfield Gets a Life&quot;. Also airing on CBS from 1988 to 1994 was the animated series &quot;Garfield and Friends&quot;, which also adapted Davis&#x27;s other comic strip &quot;U.S. Acres&quot;. All of these featured Lorenzo Music as the voice of Garfield. The feature film &quot;&quot; was released in 2004 and &quot;&quot; two years later. Both were live-action movies featuring a computer-animated Garfield voiced by Bill Murray. Another animated adaptation for television, &quot;The Garfield Show&quot;, aired on France 3 in France and Cartoon Network in the United States from 2009 to 2016. In addition, Garfield has been the subject of merchandise, video games, books, and other spin-off merchandise. The strip has also been re-published in compilations; the first of these, &quot;Garfield at Large&quot; (1980), developed what came to be known as the &quot;Garfield format&quot; for re-publication of newspaper comics in book form.

On August 6, 2019, New York City–based Viacom (now Paramount Global) announced that it would acquire Paws, Inc., including most rights to the &quot;Garfield&quot; franchise (the comics, merchandise and animated cartoons). The deal did not include the rights to the live-action &quot;Garfield&quot; films, which are still owned by The Walt Disney Company through its 20th Century Studios label, as well as &quot;The Garfield Movie&quot; which was released by Sony Pictures under its Columbia Pictures label in 2024. Jim Davis continues to make comics, and a new Garfield animated series is in production for Paramount Global subsidiary Nickelodeon.

==History==
Cartoonist Jim Davis was born and raised in Muncie, Indiana. In 1973, while working as an assistant for T.K. Ryan&#x27;s &quot;Tumbleweeds&quot;, he created the comic strip &quot;Gnorm Gnat&quot;, which ran only in the &quot;Pendleton Times&quot; of Pendleton, Indiana, from 1973 to 1975 and met with little success. Davis had tried to syndicate the strip, but was unsuccessful; he noted that one editor told him that his &quot;art was good, his gags were great, [but] nobody can identify with bugs.&quot; Davis decided to peruse current comic strips to determine what species of animal characters might be more popular. He felt that dogs were doing well, but noticed no prominent cats. Davis figured he could create a cat star, having grown up on a farm with twenty-five cats. Thus was created the character of Garfield.

The title character Garfield was based on the cats Davis grew up around; he took his name and personality from Davis&#x27; grandfather, James A. Garfield Davis, whom he described as &quot;a large, cantankerous man.&quot; Garfield&#x27;s human owner Jon Arbuckle derived his name from a 1950s coffee commercial. Jon&#x27;s roommate Lyman, added to give Jon someone to talk with, carried on the name of an earlier &quot;Gnorm Gnat&quot; character. The final character was Lyman&#x27;s dog Spot, who was renamed Odie so as to avoid confusion with a dog also named Spot in the comic strip &quot;Boner&#x27;s Ark&quot;. From 1976 to early 1978, these characters appeared in a strip called &quot;Jon&quot; which also ran in the &quot;Times&quot;. In 1977, the strip&#x27;s name was changed to &quot;Garfield.&quot; The &quot;Jon&quot; comic strip was largely unknown until 2019, when YouTuber Quinton Hoover found several microfilm archives of the &quot;Jon&quot; publications from the Pendleton Community Library and Indiana State Library. &quot;Jon&quot; first appeared in the &quot;Pendleton Times&quot; on January 8, 1976, just two weeks after &quot;Gnorm Gnat&quot; ended.

In March 1978, United Feature Syndicate accepted the strip for national distribution (which had been retitled &quot;Garfield&quot; on September 1, 1977), and the last &quot;Pendleton Times&quot; strip ran on March 2, 1978. United Feature Syndicate debuted the first strip nationwide in 41 newspapers, starting on June 19, 1978. After a test run, the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; dropped the &quot;Garfield&quot; strip, only to reinstate it after readers&#x27; complaints.

The strip underwent stylistic changes, evolving from the style of the 1976–83 strips, to a more cartoonish look from 1984 onward. This change has mainly affected Garfield&#x27;s design, which underwent a &quot;Darwinian evolution&quot; in which he began walking on his hind legs, &quot;slimmed down&quot;, and &quot;stopped looking ... through squinty little eyes&quot; His evolution, according to Davis, was to make it easier to &quot;push Odie off the table&quot; or &quot;reach for a piece of pie&quot;. The redesign was in part on the advice of Davis&#x27;s mentor and erstwhile rival Charles M. Schulz; though Schulz privately expressed some jealousy at &quot;Garfield&quot; overtaking his own strip &quot;Peanuts&quot; and thought Davis&#x27;s characters were lacking in subtlety and nuance, he provided substantial advice to Davis over the years, particularly in setting the franchising and merchandising blueprint Schulz had built for Snoopy, which Davis adopted to great success for &quot;Garfield&quot;.

&quot;Garfield&quot; quickly became a commercial success. By the beginning of 1981, less than three years after its nationwide launch, the strip was in 850 newspapers and had sold over $15 million in merchandise. To manage the merchandise, Davis founded Paws, Inc. In 1982 the strip was appearing in more than 1,000 newspapers.

By 2002, &quot;Garfield&quot; became the world&#x27;s most syndicated strip, appearing in 2,570 newspapers with 263 million readers worldwide; by 2004, &quot;Garfield&quot; appeared in nearly 2,600 newspapers and sold from $750 million to $1 billion worth of merchandise in 111 countries. In 1994, Davis&#x27;s company, Paws, Inc., purchased all rights to the strips from 1978 to 1993 from United Feature.

While retaining creative control and being the only signer, Davis now only writes and usually does the rough sketches. Since the late 1990s most of the work has been done by long-time assistants Brett Koth and Gary Barker. Inking and coloring work is done by other artists, while Davis spends most of the time supervising production and merchandising the characters.

==Content==
The strip&#x27;s title character is Garfield, an obese orange tabby cat. Garfield&#x27;s personality is defined by his sarcasm, laziness, and gluttony, with the character showing a particular affinity for lasagna. His owner is Jon Arbuckle, a man with an affinity for stereotypically nerdy pastimes. Jon&#x27;s other pet is Odie, a dim-witted yellow dog. Most strips center around interactions among the three characters&#x27; conflicting personalities. Regular themes include Jon&#x27;s frustration with Garfield&#x27;s antics; Garfield&#x27;s disdain for Odie; and Jon&#x27;s interactions with his girlfriend and the pets&#x27; veterinarian, Dr. Liz Wilson. Many strips feature Jon, Garfield, and Odie visiting Jon&#x27;s unnamed parents and brother Doc Boy on their family farm. Other side characters include various mice and spiders within the house, both frequent targets of abuse and scorn from Garfield; Garfield&#x27;s teddy bear Pooky; Garfield&#x27;s girlfriend Arlene, a pink cat; Nermal, a gray striped kitten who enjoys tormenting Garfield over his perceived age; and various other pets who live in the neighborhood.

Part of the strip&#x27;s broad pop cultural appeal is due to its lack of social or political commentary; though this was Davis&#x27;s original intention, he also admitted that his &quot;grasp of politics isn&#x27;t strong&quot;, joking that, for many years, he thought &quot;OPEC was a denture adhesive&quot;.

Originally created with the intentions to &quot;come up with a good, marketable character&quot;, &quot;Garfield&quot; has spawned merchandise earning $750 million to $1 billion annually. In addition to the various merchandise and commercial tie-ins, the strip has spawned several animated television specials, two animated television series, two theatrical feature-length live-action/CGI animated films, and three fully CGI animated direct-to-video films.

==Marketing==

&quot;Garfield&quot; was originally created by Davis with the intention to come up with a &quot;good, marketable character&quot;. Now the world&#x27;s most syndicated comic strip, &quot;Garfield&quot; has spawned a &quot;profusion&quot; of merchandise including clothing, toys, games, books, Caribbean cruises, credit cards, dolls, DVDs of the movies or the TV series, and related media. In April 2024, Motel 6 announced Garfield as their first &quot;Chief Pet Officer&quot; and Garfield-themed rooms for the release of &quot;The Garfield Movie&quot;.

==Media==
===Books===
Starting in 1980, the comic strip has been collected in anthologies. The first, &quot;Garfield at Large&quot;, was published in March 1980 by Ballantine Books. These books helped increase the strip&#x27;s popularity through sales, leading to several of them reaching the top of the &quot;New York Times&quot; best sellers list. For these compilation books, Davis devised a book layout which is considerably longer and less tall than the average book. This allowed the strip to be oriented in the same format as it appeared in the newspaper, as opposed to earlier comic strip anthologies which often stacked the panels vertically. This book style has since been referred to in the publishing industry as the &quot;Garfield format&quot; and has been adapted by other publishers. Davis noted that it became popular for other comic strip anthologies in particular, such as those of &quot;The Far Side&quot;.

===Internet===
Garfield.com was the strip&#x27;s official website, which contained archives of past strips along with games and an online store. Jim Davis had also collaborated with Ball State University and Pearson Digital Learning to create ProfessorGarfield.org, an educational website with interactive games focusing on math and reading skills, and with Children&#x27;s Technology Group to create MindWalker, a web browser that allows parents to limit the websites their children can view to a preset list.

A variety of edited &quot;Garfield&quot; strips have been made available on the Internet, with some being hosted on their own unofficial, dedicated sites. Dating from 2005, a site titled the &quot;Garfield Randomizer&quot; created a three-panel strip using panels from previous &quot;Garfield&quot; strips. Another approach, known as &quot;Silent Garfield&quot;, involved removing Garfield&#x27;s thought balloons from the strips. Some examples date from 2006. A webcomic called &quot;Arbuckle&quot; does the above but also redraws the originals in a different art style. The &quot;Arbuckle&quot; website creator writes: &quot;&#x27;Garfield&#x27; changes from being a comic about a sassy, corpulent feline, and becomes a compelling picture of a lonely, pathetic, delusional man who talks to his pets. Consider that Jon, according to Garfield canon, cannot hear his cat&#x27;s thoughts. This is the world as he sees it. This is his story&quot;.

Another variation along the same lines, called &quot;Realfield&quot; or &quot;Realistic Garfield&quot;, was to redraw Garfield as a real cat and remove his thought balloons. Still another approach to editing the strips involved removing Garfield and other main characters from the originals completely, leaving Jon talking to himself. While strips in this vein could be found online as early as 2006, the 2008 site &quot;Garfield Minus Garfield&quot; by Dan Walsh received enough online attention to be covered by news media. Reception was largely positive: at its peak, the site received as many as 300,000 hits per day. Fans connected with Jon&#x27;s &quot;loneliness and desperation&quot; and found his &quot;crazy antics&quot; humorous; Jim Davis himself called Walsh&#x27;s strips an &quot;inspired thing to do&quot; and said that &quot;some of [the strips] work better [than the originals]&quot;. Ballantine Books, which publishes the &quot;Garfield&quot; books, released a volume of &quot;Garfield Minus Garfield&quot; strips on October 28, 2008. The volume retains Davis as author and features a foreword by Walsh.

On June 19, 2020, the website was shut down during the strip&#x27;s 42nd anniversary, following Paramount&#x27;s acquisition of Paws, Inc. in August 2019. The website now redirects to Nick.com, with an alternative link to GoComics.

=== Television===

Garfield&#x27;s animation debut was on &quot;The Fantastic Funnies&quot;, which aired on CBS on May 15, 1980, voiced by actor Scott Beach. &quot;Garfield&quot; was one of the strips featured, introduced as a newcomer (the strip was only two years old at the time). From 1982 to 1991, twelve primetime &quot;Garfield&quot; cartoon specials and one hour-long primetime documentary celebrating the character&#x27;s 10th anniversary were aired; Lorenzo Music voiced Garfield in all of them. A Saturday morning cartoon show, &quot;Garfield and Friends&quot;, aired for seven seasons from 1988 to 1994. This adaption also starred Music as the voice of Garfield.

&quot;The Garfield Show&quot;, a CGI series, started development in 2007 to coincide with the strip&#x27;s 30th anniversary in 2008. It premiered in France in December 2008 and made its U.S. debut on Cartoon Network on November 2, 2009. A new series is currently in development at Nickelodeon after Paramount Global acquired the franchise.

===Films===

A live-action/computed animated film titled &quot;&quot; was released in theaters on June 11, 2004, and a sequel titled &quot;&quot; was released on June 16, 2006. Both films were released by 20th Century Fox with actor Bill Murray voicing the character in both films. Despite receiving negative reviews from critics, the films were both commercial successes. Three direct-to-video films were released by Paws, Inc. in cooperation with Davis Entertainment: &quot;Garfield Gets Real&quot; on November 20, 2007, &quot;Garfield&#x27;s Fun Fest&quot; on August 5, 2008, and &quot;Garfield&#x27;s Pet Force&quot; on June 16, 2009.

On May 24, 2016, it was announced that Alcon Entertainment would develop a new CG-animated &quot;Garfield&quot; film, with John Cohen and Steven P. Wegner producing, and Mark Dindal directing the feature. In August 2019, Viacom acquired the rights to Garfield, leaving the status of the movie for the time uncertain, with Dindal confirming that the film was still in production in December 2020. On November 1, 2021, Chris Pratt was announced as the voice of Garfield, with animation being provided by DNEG, a production company of the film. David Reynolds was announced as the screenwriter of the film, reuniting him with Dindal after they worked together on &quot;The Emperor&#x27;s New Groove&quot;. Sony Pictures will maintain global distribution rights for the film, apart from China. On May 24, 2022, Samuel L. Jackson joined the voice cast as Vic, Garfield&#x27;s father. In September 2022, the film was scheduled to be released on May 24, 2024.

===Video games===

A &quot;Garfield&quot; video game was developed by Atari, Inc. for its Atari 2600 home video game system and appears in their 1984 catalog. However, after Atari&#x27;s spinoff and sale of its home games and computers division, owner Jack Tramiel decided the character&#x27;s royalties were too expensive given the declining state of the video game industry at the time, and the game was cancelled. A ROM image of the game was however released with Jim Davis&#x27; blessing.

&quot;&quot; is a 1987 video game for the Atari ST, ZX Spectrum, Commodore 64, Amstrad CPC and the Amiga based on the comic strip. Towa Chiki made &quot;A Week of Garfield&quot; for the Family Computer, released only in Japan in 1989. Sega also made the 1995 video game &quot;&quot; for the Sega Genesis/Mega Drive, Game Gear and Windows 3.1 computers. Other companies made games, such as &quot;&quot; for the DS, published by Game Factory, &quot;Garfield&#x27;s Nightmare&quot; for DS, &quot;Garfield&#x27;s Funfest&quot; for DS, and &quot;Garfield Labyrinth&quot; for Game Boy. On PlayStation 2 were &quot;Garfield&quot; and &quot;Garfield 2&quot; (known in the US as &quot;Garfield, a Tale of Two Kitties&quot;). &quot;&quot; was also made for PS2. &quot;Garfield: Saving Arlene&quot; was only released in Japan and in the United Kingdom. And recent additions for mobile devices are &quot;Garfield&#x27;s Diner&quot; and &quot;Garfield&#x27;s Zombie Defense&quot;.

Konami also released a Garfield handheld electronic game titled &quot;Lasagnator&quot; in 1991, which met with mild success.

In 2012, a series of Garfield video games was launched by French publisher Anuman Interactive, including &quot;My Puzzles with Garfield!&quot;, &quot;Multiplication Tables with Garfield&quot;, &quot;Garfield Kart&quot;, &quot;Garfield Kart: Furious Racing&quot;, and &quot;Garfield&#x27;s Match Up&quot;.

Garfield appears as a playable character in several Nickelodeon crossover games, including &quot;Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl&quot;, &quot;Nickelodeon Kart Racers 3: Slime Speedway&quot;, and &quot;Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl 2&quot;.

===Stage===
Joseph Papp, producer of &quot;A Chorus Line&quot;, discussed making a Garfield stage musical, but due to some complications, it never got off ground. A full-length stage musical, titled &quot;Garfield Live&quot;, was planned to kick off its US tour in September 2010, but got moved to January 18, 2011, where it premiered in Muncie, Indiana. The book was written by Jim Davis, with music and lyrics by Michael Dansicker and Bill Meade, and it was booked by AWA Touring Services. The opening song, &quot;Cattitude&quot;, can be heard on the national tour&#x27;s website, along with two more, &quot;On the Fence&quot; and &quot;Going Home!&quot;. When the North American tour concluded in 2012, it toured throughout Asia.

===Comic book===
In agreement with Paws, Boom! Studios launched in May 2012 a monthly &quot;Garfield&quot; comic book, with the first issue featuring a story written by Mark Evanier (who has supervised &quot;Garfield and Friends&quot; and &quot;The Garfield Show&quot;) and illustrated by Davis&#x27;s long-time assistant Gary Barker.

===Art book===
In 2016, Hermes Press signed an agreement with Paws, Inc to publish an art book on the art of author Jim Davis, titled &quot;The Art of Jim Davis&#x27; Garfield&quot;. The book includes an essay by author R.C. Harvey and other original material, and was released in July 2016 for San Diego Comic-Con.

===Restaurant===
In 2018, a ghost restaurant themed after the franchise known as GarfieldEATS was opened in Dubai. Customers order food through the official mobile app, which also contains games and allows users to purchase episodes of &quot;Garfield and Friends&quot;. The restaurant serves lasagna, Garfield-shaped pizza, &quot;Garfuccinos&quot;, and Garfield-shaped dark chocolate bars. A second location opened in Toronto in 2019. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic and a dispute over rent, the restaurant closed in 2020.

==Main characters==

Through the Garfield strips, there have been many additional characters, but the main ones are described here.

===Garfield===
First appearance: June 19, 1978

Garfield is an orange, fuzzy tabby cat born in the kitchen of an Italian restaurant (later revealed in the television special &quot;&quot; to be Mama Leoni&#x27;s Italian Restaurant) who immediately ate all the pasta and lasagna in sight, thus developing his love and obsession for lasagna and pizza.

Gags in the strips commonly deal with Garfield&#x27;s obesity (in one strip, Jon jokes: &quot;I wouldn&#x27;t say Garfield is fat, but the last time he got on a Ferris wheel, the two guys on top starved to death&quot;) and his disdain of any form of exertion or work. He is known for saying &quot;breathing is exercise&quot;.

Though Garfield can be very cynical, he does have a soft side for his teddy bear, Pooky, food, and sleep, and during one Christmas he says, &quot;They say I have to get up early, be nice to people, skip breakfast… I wish it would never end.&quot; However, in the feature film &quot;Garfield Gets Real&quot; and its sequels, Garfield is better behaved, friendlier towards Jon and Odie, less self-centered, and more sympathetic.

It has been wondered by many readers if Garfield can actually be understood by the human characters around him. Sometimes, it seems like Jon can hear him. However, it is mentioned in more than one strip that Jon cannot understand Garfield. However, in the feature film &quot;Garfield Gets Real&quot; and its sequels, Garfield and the other animals (save for Odie) are able to talk to, and be understood by, Jon and the other humans. In the April 1 (April Fools&#x27; Day), 1997, strip drawn by the artists of &quot;Blondie&quot; as part of the comic strip switcheroo, Garfield, still with thought balloons, can be understood by Jon.

To break the fourth wall, June 19 is celebrated within the strip as Garfield&#x27;s birthday. The appearance in 1979 claimed it to be his first birthday, although in the first appearance of the strip (June 19, 1978), he was portrayed as a fully grown cat, implying that the birthday is for the strip itself.

===Jon Arbuckle===
First appearance: June 19, 1978

Jon (Full name: Jonathan Q. Arbuckle) is Garfield&#x27;s owner, usually depicted as an awkward clumsy geek who has trouble finding a date. Jon had a crush on Liz (Garfield&#x27;s veterinarian) and is now dating her. Jon disapproves of Garfield&#x27;s &quot;don&#x27;t care, not interested&quot;, attitude and often encourages his pet to take an interest in the world around him, sometimes stating an interesting fact or asking a philosophical question in an attempt to prompt Garfield into thought. Garfield tends to brush off these attempts with a simple yet logical remark, and despite the trouble Garfield causes, Jon has a heart of gold and is very tolerant of Garfield&#x27;s shortcomings, a fact which Garfield often takes advantage of. Jon&#x27;s exact age is unknown, as in one 1980 strip where he stated he was 29 (though the fact he said that he would be 30 if he wasn&#x27;t sick a year and this was said in the context of a joke told to Garfield makes it possible he is a different age) and in an episode of &quot;The Garfield Show&quot; he was stated to be 22. His birthday is July 28.

Jon loves (or occasionally hates) Garfield and all cats. Many gags focus on this; his inability to get a date is usually attributed to his lack of social skills, his poor taste in clothes (Garfield remarked in one strip after seeing his closet that &quot;two hundred moths committed suicide&quot;; in another, the &quot;geek police&quot; ordered Jon to &quot;throw out his tie&quot;), and his eccentric interests which range from stamp collecting to measuring the growth of his toenails to watching movies with &quot;polka ninjas&quot;. Other strips portray him as lacking intelligence (he is seen reading a pop-up book in one strip).

Jon was born on a farm that apparently contained few amenities; in one strip, his father, upon seeing indoor plumbing, remarks: &quot;Woo-ha! Ain&#x27;t science something?&quot; Jon occasionally visits his parents, brother and grandmother at their farm. It was implied that Jon is inspired by a drawing of Davis himself when he was first drawing the strip. Jon was portrayed as a cartoonist in the first strip and occasional others in the early years; Davis stated his intent had been to express his own frustrations as a cartoonist. Ultimately, Jon&#x27;s job has been referenced far more frequently in &quot;Garfield&quot; animated series than in the strip.

===Odie===
First appearance: August 8, 1978

Odie is a yellow, long-eared beagle with a large, slobbering tongue, who walks on all four legs, though occasionally he will walk on two like Garfield. He was originally owned by Jon&#x27;s friend Lyman, though Jon adopted him after Lyman was written out of the strip. The book &quot;Garfield: His 9 Lives&quot; (1984) retcons Odie&#x27;s origin: there is no mention of Lyman, and Odie was a puppy when he was acquired by Jon as company for Garfield (when Garfield was a kitten).

Odie is younger than Garfield and usually portrayed as naïve, happy, affectionate and blissfully unaware of Garfield&#x27;s cynical, sadistic nature, despite the physical abuse Garfield exhibits toward him, including regularly kicking him off the kitchen table or tricking him into going over the edge himself. On some occasions, however, he is depicted more intelligently, as in one strip, in which he holds a heavy rock to prevent Garfield from doing this, and actually hurts Garfield&#x27;s foot. In one strip when Garfield and Jon are out of the house, Odie is seen reading &quot;War and Peace&quot; and watching &quot;An Evening With Mozart&quot; on television, but in &quot;Ask a Dog&quot; strips, he is depicted as illiterate and has to be read to by Garfield. Odie has only thought once. In another strip, published on January 28, 2010, he is seen solving Jon&#x27;s sudoku puzzle.

===Dr. Liz Wilson===

First appearance: June 26, 1979
Dr. Liz Wilson is Garfield and Odie&#x27;s sarcastic veterinarian and a long time crush of Jon Arbuckle. She has a somewhat deadpan, sardonic persona and almost always reacts negatively to Jon&#x27;s outlandish and goofball behavior but can even find it endearing on occasion. Jon often attempts to ask her out on a date, but rarely succeeds; however, in an extended story arc from June 20 to July 29, 2006 (with the main event taking place on July 28), Liz and Jon kiss, and have been a couple ever since. Her first appearance was in a 1976 &quot;Jon&quot; strip, where Jon runs into her at a laundromat. This became a running gag of the strip, where Jon would often go out of his way to bump into her (a 1976 strip, for example, sees Jon stalking Liz in an alleyway.) in a 1977 strip, Liz takes a job as a waitress at Irma&#x27;s diner, where Jon would also frequently ask her out to no avail. It wouldn&#x27;t be until &quot;Garfield&quot; was syndicated where Liz would work as a vet. Her birthday is January 13.
==Recurring subjects and themes==

Many of the gags focus on Garfield&#x27;s obsessive eating and obesity; his dislike of spiders; his hatred of Mondays, diets, and any form of exertion; his constant shedding (which annoys Jon); and his abuse of Odie and Jon as well as his obsession with mailing Nermal to Abu Dhabi, or simply throwing him &quot;through&quot; the front door. Though he will eat nearly anything (with the exception of raisins and spinach), Garfield is particularly fond of lasagna; he also enjoys eating Jon&#x27;s houseplants and other pets (mainly birds and fish).

He also has odd relationships with household pests; Garfield generally spares mice, and even cooperates with them to cause mischief (much to Jon&#x27;s chagrin), but will readily swat or pound spiders flat. Other gags focus on Jon&#x27;s poor social skills and inability to get a date; before he started dating Liz, he often tried to get dates, usually without success (in one strip, after failing to get a date with &quot;Nancy&quot;, he tries getting a date with her mother and grandmother; he ended up getting &quot;shot down by three generations&quot;). When he does get a date, it usually goes awry; Jon&#x27;s dates have slashed his tires, been tranquilized, and called the police when he stuck carrots in his ears. The storylines featuring Jon&#x27;s dates rarely appear now. Before, he had dates with many odd characters, whereas now, he exclusively dates Liz.

Garfield&#x27;s world has specific locations that appear normally on the comic strips, like the vet&#x27;s office (a place he loathes). Irma&#x27;s Diner is another occasional setting. Irma is a chirpy but slow-witted and unattractive waitress/manager, and one of Jon&#x27;s few friends. The terrible food is the center of most of the jokes, along with the poor management. Jon periodically visits his parents and brother on the farm. This results in week-long comical displays of stupidity by Jon and his family, and their interactions. There is a comic strip where Jon&#x27;s brother Doc Boy is watching two socks in the dryer spinning and Doc Boy calls it entertainment.

On the farm, Jon&#x27;s mother will cook huge dinners; Garfield hugs her for this. Jon has a grandmother who, in a strip, once kicked Odie; Garfield subsequently hugged her. Jon&#x27;s parents have twice visited Jon, Garfield, and Odie in the city. Jon&#x27;s father drove into town on his tractor (which he double-parked) and brought a rooster to wake him up. As Garfield has a love for food, they will often eat out at restaurants. Most trips end up embarrassing because Garfield will pig out, or Jon will do something stupid, including wearing an ugly shirt, which happened one night when he took Liz on a date. When Jon takes Liz on a date, Garfield occasionally tags along—once, he ate the bread and other food at an Italian restaurant they went to.

Frequently, the characters break the fourth wall, mostly to explain something to the readers, talk about a subject that often sets up the strip&#x27;s punchline (like Jon claiming that pets are good for exercise right before he finds Garfield in the kitchen and chases him out), or give a mere glare when a character is belittled or not impressed. Sometimes, this theme revolves around the conventions of the strip; for example, in one strip, Garfield catches a cold and complains about it, noting that his thoughts are stuffed up.

===Short storylines===
One particular semi-recurring storyline features Jon and Liz on a date in a restaurant. They sometimes are waited on by the Italian Armando, who is refined and sophisticated and shows a great loathing towards Jon, presumably for his immature and uncouth behavior at the prestigious eatery. On other occasions, the couple receives a different waiter, such as a large ogre-like man who intimidates Jon when he is about to report a complaint about the food.

Another commonly recurring character, although hardly ever seen, is Jon&#x27;s neighbor, Mrs. Feeny. Garfield seems to take both enormous pride and excess zeal in doing whatever it takes to harass her, to the point that she even erects an electric fence (which does not stop him).

Other unique themes are things like &quot;Garfield&#x27;s Believe it or Don&#x27;t&quot;, &quot;Garfield&#x27;s Law&quot;, &quot;Garfield&#x27;s History of Dogs&quot;, and &quot;Garfield&#x27;s History of Cats&quot;, which show science, history, and the world from Garfield&#x27;s point of view. Another particular theme is &quot;National Fat Week&quot;, where Garfield spends the week making fun of skinny people. Also, there was a storyline involving Garfield catching Odie eating his food and &quot;kicking Odie into next week&quot;. Soon, Garfield realizes that &quot;Lunch isn&#x27;t the same without Odie. He always slips up behind me, barks loudly and makes me fall into my food&quot; (Garfield subsequently falls into his food by himself).

A few days after the storyline began, Garfield is lying in his bed with a &quot;nagging feeling I&#x27;m forgetting something&quot;, with Odie landing on Garfield in the next panel. Jon and Liz began to go out more frequently. Jon has started hiring pet sitters to look after Garfield and Odie, though they do not always work out. Two particular examples are Lillian, an eccentric (and very nearsighted) old lady with odd quirks, and Greta, a muscle-bound woman who was hired to look after the pets during New Year&#x27;s Eve.

Most of December is spent preparing for Christmas, with a predictable focus on presents. Other Christmas themed strips include Jon&#x27;s attempts at decorating the tree and house, or the attempt to buy the tree. Some years, the Christmas strips started as early as the end of November. Another example is &quot;Splut Week&quot;, when Garfield tries to avoid pies that are thrown at him. For most of Garfield&#x27;s history, being hit with a pie has inevitably resulted in the onomatopoeia &quot;splut&quot;, hence the name.

Every week before June 19, the strip focuses on Garfield&#x27;s birthday, which he dreads because of his fear of getting older. This started happening after his sixth birthday. However, before his 29th birthday, Liz put Garfield on a diet. On June 19, 2007, Garfield was given the greatest birthday present: &quot;I&#x27;M OFF MY DIET!&quot; Occasionally the strip celebrates Halloween as well with scary-themed jokes, such as mask gags. There are also seasonal jokes, with snow-related gags common in January or February and beach- or heat-themed jokes in the summer.

One storyline, which ran the week before Halloween in 1989, is unique among Garfield strips in that it is not meant to be humorous. It depicts Garfield awakening in a future in which the house is abandoned and he no longer exists. In Garfield&#x27;s &quot;Twentieth Anniversary Collection&quot;, in which the strips are reprinted, Jim Davis discusses the genesis for this series:

One of the recurring storylines involves Garfield getting lost or running away. The longest one of these lasted for over a month (in 1986, from August 25 to September 28); it began with Jon telling Garfield to go get the newspaper. Garfield walks outside to get it, but speculates about what will happen if he wanders off – and decides to find out. Jon notices Garfield has been gone too long, so he sends Odie out to find him. He quickly realizes his mistake (Odie, being not too bright, also gets lost).

Jon starts to get lonely, so he offers a reward for the return of Garfield and Odie. He is not descriptive, so animals including an elephant, monkeys, a seal, a snake, a kangaroo and joey, and turtles are brought to Jon&#x27;s house for the reward. After a series of events, including Odie being adopted by a small girl, both pets meeting up at a circus that they briefly join, and both going to a pet shop, Garfield and Odie make it back home.

Another story involved Jon going away on a business trip around Christmas time, leaving Garfield a week&#x27;s worth of food, which he devoured instantly. Garfield then leaves the house and gets locked out. He then reunites with his mother, and eventually makes it back home in the snow on Christmas Eve (December 3–23, 1984). Part of this storyline was taken from the 1983 Emmy-winning special &quot;Garfield on the Town&quot;.

=== National Stupid Day ===
The November 11, 2010, strip featured an interaction between Garfield and a spider. The spider forcefully warns Garfield (who is brandishing a newspaper) that should he be squished, there will be an &quot;annual day of remembrance&quot; for him and that he will become famous. The final panel shows a classroom full of spiders, in which the teacher asks, &quot;does anyone here know why we celebrate &#x27;National Stupid Day&#x27;?&quot;

Since November 11 is Veterans Day in the US, some readers expressed concern that the strip and its timing were mocking the holiday. Davis released a statement saying that he had no control over the strip&#x27;s timing but nonetheless apologized for any offense it may have caused.

==Paws, Inc.==

Paws, Inc. was founded in 1981 by Jim Davis to support the Garfield comic strip and its licensing. It is located in Muncie, Indiana, and has a staff of nearly 50 artists and licensing administrators. In 1994, the company purchased all rights to the Garfield comic strips from 1978 to 1993 from United Feature Syndicate. However, the original black and white daily strips and original color Sunday strips remain copyrighted to United Feature Syndicate. The full-color daily strips and recolored Sunday strips are copyrighted to Paws as they are considered a different product. Though rights to the strip remain with Paws, Inc., it is currently distributed by the Andrews McMeel Syndication. In August 2019, Davis sold Paws, Inc. to Viacom, who has placed Garfield under the Nickelodeon banner.

<text>Graham Chapman (8 January 1941 – 4 October 1989) was a British actor, comedian and writer. He was one of the six members of the surrealist comedy group Monty Python. He portrayed authority figures such as The Colonel and the lead role in two Python films, &quot;Holy Grail&quot; (1975) and &quot;Life of Brian&quot; (1979).

Chapman was born in Leicester and was raised in Melton Mowbray. He enjoyed science, acting, and comedy and after graduating from Emmanuel College, Cambridge, and St Bartholomew&#x27;s Hospital Medical College, he turned down a career as a doctor to be a comedian. Chapman eventually established a writing partnership with John Cleese, which reached its critical peak with Monty Python during the 1970s. He subsequently left Britain for Los Angeles, where he attempted to be a success on American television, speaking on the college circuit and producing the pirate film &quot;Yellowbeard&quot; (1983), before returning to Britain in the early 1980s.

Chapman was openly homosexual and a supporter of gay rights and was in a long-term partnership with David Sherlock. He was an alcoholic from his time at Cambridge until he quit drinking shortly before working on &quot;Life of Brian&quot;. He became an enthusiast and patron of the Dangerous Sports Club in the later years of his life. In 1989, Chapman died of tonsil cancer which had spread to his spine. His life and legacy were commemorated at a memorial service at St Bartholomew&#x27;s Hospital two months after his death, which was a testimony to Chapman&#x27;s surreal sense of humour that the remaining five Pythons enacted.

== Early life and education ==

Graham Chapman was born on 8 January 1941 at the Stoneygate Nursing Home, Stoneygate, Leicester, Leicestershire, the son of policeman Walter Chapman and Edith Towers. Walter Chapman was a police constable at the time of Graham&#x27;s birth; he ended his career as a chief inspector. He had been trained as a French polisher for a coffin-maker before entering the police force in the 1930s.

Chapman had an elder brother, John, who was born in 1936. They had, according to Chapman and his brother, an &quot;extremely poor upbringing&quot;. One of Chapman&#x27;s earliest memories was seeing the remains of Polish airmen who had suffered an aeroplane accident near Leicester, later saying the sight remained in his memory.

Chapman was educated at Melton Mowbray Grammar School. He showed a strong affinity for science, sports and amateur dramatics and was singled out for attention when a local paper reviewed his performance of Mark Antony in Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Julius Caesar&quot;. Graham and his brother John were both avid fans of radio comedy, being especially fond of &quot;The Goon Show&quot; and Robert Moreton&#x27;s skill of telling jokes the wrong way round and reversing punchlines. Biographer Jim Yoakum said &quot;the radio shows didn&#x27;t necessarily make him laugh&quot;.

In 1959, Chapman began to study medicine at Emmanuel College, Cambridge. He joined the Cambridge Footlights, where he first began writing with John Cleese. Following graduation, Chapman joined the Footlights show &quot;Cambridge Circus&quot; and toured New Zealand, deferring his medical studies for a year. After the tour, he continued his studies at St Bartholomew&#x27;s Medical College, but became torn between whether to pursue a career in medicine or acting. His brother John later said, &quot;He [Graham] wasn&#x27;t ever driven to go into medicine... it wasn&#x27;t his life&#x27;s ambition.&quot;

== Career ==
=== Pre-Python career ===
Following their Footlights success, Chapman and Cleese began to write professionally for the BBC, initially for David Frost but also for Marty Feldman. Frost had recruited Cleese, and in turn Cleese decided he needed Chapman as a sounding board. Chapman also contributed sketches to the radio series &quot;I&#x27;m Sorry, I&#x27;ll Read That Again&quot; and wrote material on his own and with Bill Oddie. He wrote for &quot;The Illustrated Weekly Hudd&quot; (starring Roy Hudd), &quot;Cilla Black&quot;, &quot;This Is Petula Clark&quot; and &quot;This Is Tom Jones&quot;. Chapman, Cleese and Tim Brooke-Taylor later joined Feldman in the television comedy series &quot;At Last the 1948 Show&quot;. It was Chapman&#x27;s first significant role as a performer as well as a writer and he displayed a gift for deadpan comedy (such as in the sketch &quot;The Minister Who Falls to Pieces&quot;) and imitating various British dialects. The series was the first to feature Chapman&#x27;s sketch of wrestling with himself.

Despite the series&#x27; success, Chapman was still unsure about abandoning his medical career. In between the two series of &quot;At Last The 1948 Show&quot;, he completed his studies at St Bartholomew&#x27;s and became professionally registered as a doctor. Chapman and Cleese also wrote for the long-running television comedy series &quot;Doctor in the House&quot;, and both appeared on a one-off television special, &quot;How to Irritate People&quot; alongside Brooke-Taylor and future Python member Michael Palin. One of Cleese&#x27;s and Chapman&#x27;s sketches, featuring a used car salesman refusing to believe a customer&#x27;s model had broken down, became the inspiration for the Dead Parrot sketch. Chapman also co-wrote several episodes of &quot;Doctor in the House&quot; follow up, &quot;Doctor in Charge&quot;, with Bernard McKenna.

=== Monty Python ===

In 1969, Chapman and Cleese joined the other Pythons, Michael Palin, Eric Idle, Terry Jones and Terry Gilliam, for their sketch comedy series &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Flying Circus&quot;. The group&#x27;s writing was split into well-defined teams, with Chapman collaborating almost exclusively with Cleese. Chapman was particularly keen to remove stereotypical punchlines in sketches and created The Colonel, who would stop them in mid-flow by saying they were &quot;too silly&quot;.

Although the pair were officially equal partners, Cleese later thought that Chapman contributed comparatively little in the way of direct writing, saying &quot;he would come in, say something marvelous and then drift off in his own mind&quot;. The other Pythons have said that Chapman&#x27;s biggest contribution in the writing room was an intuition for what was funny. Gilliam later recalled that &quot;Graham would do the nudge that would push it into something extraordinary&quot;. The series was an immediate success, and Chapman was delighted to learn that medical students at St Bartholomew&#x27;s crowded round the television in the bar to watch it. Chapman was frequently late for rehearsing or recording, leading to the other Pythons calling him &quot;the late Graham Chapman&quot;.

Chapman&#x27;s main contribution to the &quot;Dead Parrot sketch&quot;, derived from the piece within &quot;How to Irritate People&quot; and involving a customer returning a faulty toaster, was &quot;How can we make this &quot;madder&quot;?&quot;, turning the toaster into a dead Norwegian Blue parrot. Cleese later said he and Chapman believed that &quot;there was something very funny there, if we could find the right context for it&quot;. Cleese was in particular concerned that the Cheese Shop sketch simply was not funny, in that it was just mainly a man listing different types of cheese. Chapman urged his partner to continue with it, telling him &quot;Trust me, it&#x27;s funny.&quot; When it was read out at the next script meeting, Cleese found that the others, particularly Palin, thought it was hilarious. The group felt that Chapman had the best acting skills among them. Cleese complimented Chapman by saying that he was &quot;particularly a wonderful actor&quot;.

Chapman played the lead role in two Python films, &quot;Holy Grail&quot; and &quot;Life of Brian&quot;. He was chosen to play the lead in &quot;Holy Grail&quot; because of the group&#x27;s respect for his straight acting skills, and because the other members wanted to play lesser, funnier characters. Chapman did not mind being filmed fully nude in front of a crowd in &quot;Life of Brian&quot;, but the scene, filmed in Tunisia, caused problems with the female Muslim extras.

=== Other work ===
In 1975, Chapman and Douglas Adams wrote a pilot for a television series, entitled &quot;Out of the Trees&quot;, but it received poor ratings after being broadcast at the same time as &quot;Match of the Day&quot; and only the initial episode was produced. In 1978, Chapman co-wrote the comedy film &quot;The Odd Job&quot; with McKenna and starred as one of the main characters. Chapman wanted his friend Keith Moon to play a co-lead role alongside him, but Moon could not pass an acting test, so the part went to David Jason who had previously appeared on &quot;Do Not Adjust Your Set&quot; with Pythons Idle, Jones and Palin. The film was moderately successful. Chapman guest-starred on several television series including &quot;The Big Show&quot;.

In 1976, Chapman began writing a pirate film, &quot;Yellowbeard&quot; (1983), which came out of conversations between Chapman and Moon while in Los Angeles. Moon had always wanted to play Long John Silver, so Chapman began to write a script for him. Moon died in 1978 and the work stalled, eventually being rewritten by McKenna, then by Peter Cook. The film, which starred Chapman as the eponymous pirate, also featured appearances from Cook, Marty Feldman, Cleese, Idle, Spike Milligan and Cheech &amp; Chong. It marked the last appearance of Feldman, who suffered a fatal heart attack in December 1982. The project was fraught with financial difficulties and at times there was not enough money to pay the crew. It was released to mixed reviews. David Robinson, reviewing the film in &quot;The Times&quot;, said that &quot;the Monty Python style of comic anarchy requires more than scatology, rude words and funny faces&quot;.

Chapman published his memoirs, &quot;A Liar&#x27;s Autobiography&quot;, in 1980, choosing the title because he said &quot;it&#x27;s almost &quot;impossible&quot; to tell the truth&quot;. He returned to Britain permanently after &quot;Yellowbeard&quot; was released. He became involved with the extreme sports club Dangerous Sports Club, which popularised bungee jumping. Chapman was scheduled to perform a bungee jump himself, but it was cancelled due to safety concerns.

After reuniting with the other Pythons in the film &quot;The Meaning of Life&quot; (1983), Chapman began a lengthy series of US college tours, talking about The Pythons, the Dangerous Sports Club and his friend Moon, among other subjects. &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; creator and Python fan Lorne Michaels persuaded Chapman to star in &quot;The Big Show&quot;.

In 1988, Chapman appeared in the Iron Maiden video &quot;Can I Play with Madness&quot;. The same year, he starred in a pilot of a proposed television series, &quot;Jake&#x27;s Journey&quot;, but financial problems prevented a full series from being made. In 1988, he also appeared on stage with three other Pythons (Gilliam, Jones and Palin) at the 41st British Academy Film Awards where Monty Python received the BAFTA Award for Outstanding British Contribution To Cinema.

Broadcast in November 1989, the 20th anniversary television special, &quot;Parrot Sketch Not Included – 20 Years of Monty Python&quot;, hosted by Python fan Steve Martin, was Chapman&#x27;s final onscreen appearance with the other five Python members. Chapman was intended to be cast in the &quot;Red Dwarf&quot; episode &quot;Timeslides&quot;, but died before shooting could begin.

== Personal life ==

Chapman first met his long-term partner David Sherlock in Ibiza in 1966. He later described realising he was homosexual as &quot;an important moment in my life&quot;.

The following year, he told his close friends, including Cleese and Feldman, about his relationship. Chapman and Sherlock moved to Belsize Park in 1968, and the pair enjoyed visiting gay clubs in Central London. In the early 1970s, after Chapman had found fame with Monty Python, they moved to a house in Highgate, North London.

In 1972, on a television show hosted by English jazz and blues singer George Melly, Chapman first disclosed his homosexuality publicly, becoming one of the first celebrities to do so. He was a vocal spokesman for gay rights, supporting the Gay Liberation Front. In 1972, Chapman supported the newspaper &quot;Gay News&quot;, which listed him as one of the publication&#x27;s &quot;special friends&quot; in recognition. During a college tour, Chapman mentioned that a television audience member had written to the Pythons to complain about them having a gay member, citing a Bible passage that said any man who lies with a man should be taken out and stoned. Idle replied jokingly that they had found the perpetrator and killed him.

In 1971, Chapman and Sherlock adopted John Tomiczek as their son. Chapman met Tomiczek when Tomiczek was a 14-year-old run-away from Liverpool. After discussions with Tomiczek&#x27;s father, it was agreed that Chapman would become Tomiczek&#x27;s legal guardian. Both Sherlock and Tomiczek remained a constant presence in Chapman&#x27;s life. During the 1970s, Chapman became increasingly concerned about the Pythons&#x27; income and finances. He subsequently moved to Los Angeles to avoid British income tax. In the mid-1980s, he returned to the UK and moved to Maidstone, Kent, with Sherlock and Tomiczek. Tomiczek later became Chapman&#x27;s business manager; he died of a heart attack in 1992 at age 35.

Chapman took up pipe smoking aged 15, which became a lifelong habit. He began drinking heavily during his time at Cambridge and St. Bartholomew&#x27;s, favouring gin. By the time Monty Python went out on tour in 1973, Chapman&#x27;s drinking had begun to affect his performance, causing him to miss cues to go on stage, and was known to suffer from delirium tremens (DTs). He stopped drinking during Christmas 1977, concerned about being able to act in &quot;Life of Brian&quot; successfully, and remained sober for the rest of his life.

== Illness and death ==
In 1988, Chapman made a routine visit to a dentist, who found a small, malignant tumour on one of his tonsils, leading to both being removed via a tonsillectomy. The following year, it was discovered that the cancer had spread into Chapman&#x27;s spinal column, where another tumour was surgically removed. Chapman had several chemotherapy treatments and surgeries during the final months of his life, but ultimately the cancer was declared inoperable. According to his brother, Chapman was visibly upset by the death of his mother that July, by which time he was terminally ill. Shortly afterwards, Chapman filmed scenes for the 20th anniversary of the first broadcast of &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Flying Circus&quot;, the final time he appeared on television.

Chapman died on 4 October 1989 in Maidstone Hospital from resulting complications, aged 48. At the time of his death, he was being visited by Sherlock, brother John and his sister-in-law, and fellow Pythons Palin and Cleese, the latter of whom had to be led out of the room to deal with his grief. Peter Cook had intended to visit, but arrived too late and was visibly shaken by the news. Chapman&#x27;s death occurred on the eve of the twentieth anniversary of the Pythons&#x27; collective debut on British television, and Jones called it &quot;the worst case of party-pooping in all history&quot;.

=== Memorial service ===
The five surviving Python members had decided to stay away from Chapman&#x27;s private funeral to prevent it from becoming a media circus and to give his family some privacy. They sent a wreath in the shape of the Python foot, with the message: &quot;To Graham from the other Pythons with all our love. PS: Stop us if we&#x27;re getting too silly&quot;. The Rolling Stones also sent a floral arrangement, saying &quot;Thanks for all the laughs.&quot;

A public memorial service for Chapman was held at St Bartholomew&#x27;s on 3 December, two months after his death. The service began with a chorus of the hymn &quot;Jerusalem&quot; sung in Engrish with a mock Chinese accent. Cleese delivered a eulogy to Chapman with shock humour that he believed Chapman would have appreciated and became the first person at a televised British memorial service to say &quot;fuck&quot;. Palin also delivered a eulogy to Chapman, as did Idle, quipping that Chapman had decided to die rather than listen to Palin again. Idle led the other surviving Pythons and Chapman&#x27;s close friends and family in a rendition of the song &quot;Always Look on the Bright Side of Life&quot;, from &quot;Life of Brian&quot;, and later closed his remarks by saying: &quot;I&#x27;d just like to be the last person at this meeting to say &#x27;fuck&#x27;.&quot;

Ten years after Chapman&#x27;s death, his ashes were first rumoured to have been &quot;blasted into the skies in a rocket&quot; with assistance from the Dangerous Sports Club. In a second rumour, Chapman&#x27;s ashes had been scattered on the mountains of Snowdonia, Wales, where he had visited regularly as a climber.

== Legacy ==
Following Chapman&#x27;s death, reformations of the Pythons have included an urn said to contain his ashes. At the 1998 Aspen Comedy Arts festival, the urn, brought onstage by a stiff English butler, was &quot;accidentally&quot; knocked over by Terry Gilliam, spilling the &quot;ashes&quot; on-stage. The apparently cremated remains were then removed with a DustBuster. Idle recalled meeting Sherlock, saying &quot;I wish he [Chapman] was here now&quot; and Sherlock replied &quot;Oh, but he is. He&#x27;s in my pocket!&quot;

Asteroid 9617 Grahamchapman, named in Chapman&#x27;s honour, is one of six asteroids named after the Python members.

In 1997, Sherlock allowed Jim Yoakum to start the &quot;Graham Chapman Archives&quot;. Later that year, the novel &quot;Graham Crackers: Fuzzy Memories, Silly Bits, and Outright Lies&quot; was released. It is a semi-sequel to &quot;A Liar&#x27;s Autobiography&quot;, with Chapman&#x27;s works compiled by Yoakum. A compendium of writings, &quot;Calcium Made Interesting: Sketches, Letters, Essays &amp; Gondolas&quot;, also compiled and edited by Yoakum, was published in 2005 in association with the David Sherlock and John Tomiczek trust. In 2000, Chapman&#x27;s play &quot;O Happy Day&quot; was performed by Dad&#x27;s Garage Theatre Company in Atlanta, Georgia, with the assistance of Cleese and Palin. In 2006, the album and DVD release &quot;Looks Like Another Brown Trouser Job&quot; came out, featuring a college lecture recorded in April 1988.
In June 2011, it was announced that Cleese, Jones, Gilliam and Palin would perform in a 3D-animated version of Chapman&#x27;s memoir &quot;A Liar&#x27;s Autobiography: Volume VI&quot;. Co-director Jeff Simpson worked closely with Chapman&#x27;s estate and the surviving Python members to &quot;get this exactly right&quot;. The film, titled &quot;A Liar&#x27;s Autobiography: The Untrue Story of Monty Python&#x27;s Graham Chapman&quot;, was shown at the Toronto International Film Festival in September 2012 and premiered in the UK the following month as part of the BFI London Film Festival. The voices of Cleese, Gilliam, Jones and Palin were spliced into commentary recorded by Chapman reading from his memoir and taped shortly before his death. The film&#x27;s official trailer quoted Chapman as saying, &quot;This is the best film I&#x27;ve been in since I died.&quot;

In September 2012, a British Comedy Society blue plaque commemorating Chapman was unveiled at The Angel pub in Highgate by Jones, Palin, Barry Cryer, Ray Davies and Carol Cleveland. Palin said, &quot;Highgate was his patch, and he should be celebrated because he was a very good, brilliant, funny, nice, wise, kind man, who occasionally drank too much.&quot;

In December 2014, a green plaque funded by Leicestershire County Council was placed on Chapman&#x27;s former home in Burton Road, Melton Mowbray. A year later, a blue plaque at the entrance of Chapman&#x27;s old school, King Edward VII School, was reported as stolen but was later found inside the building. In March 2017, the plaque was moved to Melton Mowbray town centre.

<doc id="13026" wikidata="Q179154" url="?curid=13026" title="Gray whale">
<text>The gray whale (Eschrichtius robustus), also known as the grey whale, is a baleen whale that migrates between feeding and breeding grounds yearly. It reaches a length of , a weight of up to and lives between 55 and 70 years, although one female was estimated to be 75–80 years of age. The common name of the whale comes from the gray patches and white mottling on its dark skin. Gray whales were once called devil fish because of their fighting behavior when hunted. The gray whale is the sole living species in the genus &quot;Eschrichtius&quot;. It is the sole living genus in the family Eschrichtiidae, however some recent studies classify it as a member of the family Balaenopteridae. This mammal is descended from filter-feeding whales that appeared during the Neogene.

The gray whale is distributed in a Northeast Pacific (North American), and an endangered Northwest Pacific (Asian), population. North Atlantic populations were extirpated (perhaps by whaling) on the European coast before 500 CE, and on the American and African Atlantic coasts around the late 17th to early 18th centuries. However, in the 2010s and 2020s there have been rare sightings of gray whales in the North Atlantic, Mediterranean, and even off South Atlantic coasts. 
==Taxonomy==
The gray whale is traditionally placed as the only living species in its genus and family, &quot;Eschrichtius&quot; and Eschrichtiidae, but an extinct species was discovered and placed in the genus in 2017, the Akishima whale (&quot;E. akishimaensis&quot;). Some recent studies place gray whales as being outside the rorqual clade, but as the closest relatives to the rorquals. But other recent DNA analyses have suggested that certain rorquals of the family Balaenopteridae, such as the humpback whale, &quot;Megaptera novaeangliae&quot;, and fin whale, &quot;Balaenoptera physalus&quot;, are more closely related to the gray whale than they are to some other rorquals, such as the minke whales. The American Society of Mammalogists has followed this classification.

John Edward Gray placed it in its own genus in 1865, naming it in honour of physician and zoologist Daniel Frederik Eschricht. The common name of the whale comes from its coloration. The subfossil remains of now extinct gray whales from the Atlantic coasts of England and Sweden were used by Gray to make the first scientific description of a species then surviving only in Pacific waters. The living Pacific species was described by Cope as &quot;Rhachianectes glaucus&quot; in 1869. Skeletal comparisons showed the Pacific species to be identical to the Atlantic remains in the 1930s, and Gray&#x27;s naming has been generally accepted since. Although identity between the Atlantic and Pacific populations cannot be proven by anatomical data, its skeleton is distinctive and easy to distinguish from that of all other living whales.

Many other names have been ascribed to the gray whale, including desert whale, devilfish, gray back, mussel digger and rip sack. The name &quot;Eschrichtius gibbosus&quot; is sometimes seen; this is dependent on the acceptance of a 1777 description by Erxleben.

=== Taxonomic history ===
A number of 18th century authors described the gray whale as &quot;Balaena gibbosa&quot;, the &quot;whale with six bosses&quot;, apparently based on a brief note by :

The gray whale was first described as a distinct species by based on a subfossil found in the brackish Baltic Sea, apparently a specimen from the now extinct north Atlantic population. Lilljeborg, however, identified it as &quot;Balaenoptera robusta&quot;, a species of rorqual. realized that the rib and scapula of the specimen was different from those of any known rorquals, and therefore erected a new genus for it, &quot;Eschrichtius&quot;. were convinced that the bones described by Lilljeborg could not belong to a living species but that they were similar to fossils that Van Beneden had described from the harbour of Antwerp (most of his named species are now considered nomina dubia) and therefore named the gray whale &quot;Plesiocetus robustus&quot;, reducing Lilljeborg&#x27;s and Gray&#x27;s names to synonyms.

Charles Melville Scammon produced one of the earliest descriptions of living Pacific gray whales, and notwithstanding that he was among the whalers who nearly drove them to extinction in the lagoons of the Baja California Peninsula, they were and still are associated with him and his description of the species. At this time, however, the extinct Atlantic population was considered a separate species (&quot;Eschrischtius robustus&quot;) from the living Pacific population (&quot;Rhachianectes glaucus&quot;).

Things got increasingly confused as 19th century scientists introduced new species at an alarming rate (e.g. &quot;Eschrichtius pusillus&quot;, &quot;E. expansus&quot;, &quot;E. priscus&quot;, &quot;E. mysticetoides&quot;), often based on fragmentary specimens, and taxonomists started to use several generic and specific names interchangeably and not always correctly (e.g. &quot;Agalephus gobbosus&quot;, &quot;Balaenoptera robustus&quot;, &quot;Agalephus gibbosus&quot;). Things got even worse in the 1930s when it was finally realised that the extinct Atlantic population was the same species as the extant Pacific population, and the new combination &quot;Eschrichtius gibbosus&quot; was proposed.

==Description==

The gray whale has a dark slate-gray color and is covered by characteristic gray-white patterns, which are scars left by parasites that drop off in its cold feeding grounds. Individual whales are typically identified using photographs of their dorsal surface, matching the scars and patches associated with parasites that have either fallen off or are still attached. They have two blowholes on top of their head, which can create a distinctive heart-shaped blow at the surface in calm wind conditions.

Gray whales measure from in length for newborns to for adults (females tend to be slightly larger than adult males). Newborns are a darker gray to black in color. A mature gray whale can reach , with a typical range of , making them the ninth largest sized species of cetacean.

Notable features that distinguish the gray whale from other mysticetes include its baleen that is variously described as cream, off-white, or blond in color and is unusually short. Small depressions on the upper jaw each contain a lone stiff hair, but are only visible on close inspection. Its head&#x27;s ventral surface lacks the numerous prominent furrows of the related rorquals, instead bearing two to five shallow furrows on the throat&#x27;s underside. The gray whale also lacks a dorsal fin, instead bearing 6 to 12 dorsal crenulations (&quot;knuckles&quot;), which are raised bumps on the midline of its rear quarter, leading to the flukes. This is known as the dorsal ridge. The tail itself is across and deeply notched at the center while its edges taper to a point.

===Pacific groups===
The two populations of Pacific gray whales (east and west) are morphologically and phylogenically different. Other than DNA structures, differences in proportions of several body parts and body colors including skeletal features, and length ratios of flippers and baleen plates have been confirmed between Eastern and Western populations, and some claims that the original eastern and western groups could have been much more distinct than previously thought, enough to be counted as subspecies. Since the original Asian and Atlantic populations have become extinct, it is difficult to determine the unique features among whales in these stocks. However, there have been observations of some whales showing distinctive, blackish body colors in recent years. This corresponds with the DNA analysis of last recorded stranding in China. Differences were also observed between Korean and Chinese specimens.

==Populations==

===North Pacific===
Two Pacific Ocean populations are known to exist: one population that is very low, whose migratory route is presumed to be between the Sea of Okhotsk and southern Korea, and a larger one with a population of about 27,000 individuals in the eastern Pacific traveling between the waters off northernmost Alaska and Baja California Sur. Mothers make this journey accompanied by their calves, usually hugging the shore in shallow kelp beds, and fight viciously to protect their young if they are attacked, earning gray whales the moniker, devil fish.

The western population has had a very slow growth rate despite heavy conservation action over the years, likely due to their very slow reproduction rate. The state of the population hit an all-time low in 2010, when no new reproductive females were recorded, resulting in a minimum of 26 reproductive females being observed since 1995. Even a very small number of additional annual female deaths will cause the subpopulation to decline. However, as of 2018, evidence has indicated that the western population is markedly increasing in number, especially off Sakhalin Island. Following this, the IUCN downlisted the population&#x27;s conservation status from critically endangered to endangered.

===North Atlantic===
The gray whale became extinct in the North Atlantic in the 18th century. They had been seasonal migrants to coastal waters of both sides of Atlantic, including the Baltic Sea, the Wadden Sea, the Gulf of St. Lawrence, the Bay of Fundy, Pamlico Sound and possibly Hudson Bay. Radiocarbon dating of subfossil or fossil European (Belgium, the Netherlands, Sweden, the United Kingdom) coastal remains confirms this, with whaling the possible cause for the population&#x27;s extinction. Remains dating from the Roman epoch were found in the Mediterranean during excavation of the antique harbor of Lattara near Montpellier, France, in 1997, raising the question of whether Atlantic gray whales migrated up and down the coast of Europe from the Wadden Sea to calve in the Mediterranean. A 2018 study utilizing ancient DNA barcoding and collagen peptide matrix fingerprinting confirmed that Roman era whale bones east of the Strait of Gibraltar were gray whales (and North Atlantic right whales), confirming that gray whales once ranged into the Mediterranean. Similarly, radiocarbon dating of American east coastal subfossil remains confirm that gray whales existed there at least through the 17th century. This population ranged at least from Southampton, New York, to Jupiter Island, Florida, the latest from 1675. In his 1835 history of Nantucket Island, Obed Macy wrote that in the early pre-1672 colony a whale of the kind called &quot;scragg&quot; entered the harbor and was pursued and killed by the settlers. A. B. Van Deinse points out that the &quot;scrag whale&quot;, described by P. Dudley in 1725 as one of the species hunted by the early New England whalers, was almost certainly the gray whale.

Since the 2010s, there have been occasional sightings of gray whales in the Atlantic Ocean and in the Mediterranean Sea, including one off the coast of Israel and one off the coast of Namibia. These were presumably migrants from the North Pacific population through the Arctic Ocean. A 2015 study of DNA from subfossil gray whales indicated that this may not be a historically unique event. That study suggested that over the past 100,000 years there have been several migrations of gray whales between the Pacific and Atlantic, with the most recent large scale migration of this sort occurring about 5,000 years ago. These migrations corresponded to times of relatively high temperatures in the Arctic Ocean. In 2021, one individual was seen in the port of Rabat, Morocco, followed by sightings in Algeria and Italy. In March 2024, New England Aquarium researchers photographed a gray whale south of Nantucket, Massachusetts.

===Prewhaling abundance===
Researchers used a genetic approach to estimate pre-whaling abundance based on samples from 42 gray whales, and reported DNA variability at 10 genetic loci consistent with a population size of 76,000–118,000 individuals, three to five times larger than the average census size as measured through 2007. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has collected surveys of gray whale population since at least the 1960s. They state that &quot;the most recent population estimate [from 2007] was approximately 19,000 whales, with a high probability (88%) that the population is at &#x27;optimum sustainable population&#x27; size, as defined by the Marine Mammal Protection Act.&quot; They speculate that the ocean ecosystem has likely changed since the prewhaling era, making a return to prewhaling numbers infeasible. Factors limiting or threatening current population levels include ship strikes, entanglement in fishing gear, and changes in sea-ice coverage associated with climate change.

===Integration and recolonization===

Several whales seen off Sakhalin and on Kamchatka Peninsula have been confirmed to migrate towards eastern side of Pacific and join the larger eastern population. In January 2011, a gray whale that had been tagged in the western population was tracked as far east as the eastern population range off the coast of British Columbia. Recent findings from either stranded or entangled specimens indicate that the original western population have become functionally extinct, and possibly all the whales that have appeared on Japanese and Chinese coasts in modern times are vagrants or re-colonizers from the eastern population.

In mid-1980, there were three gray whale sightings in the eastern Beaufort Sea, placing them further east than their known range at the time. Recent increases in sightings are confirmed in Arctic areas of the historic range for Atlantic stocks, most notably on several locations in the Laptev Sea including the New Siberian Islands in the East Siberian Sea, and around the marine mammal sanctuary of the Franz Josef Land, indicating possible earlier pioneers of re-colonizations. These whales were darker in body color than those whales seen in Sea of Okhotsk. In May 2010, a gray whale was sighted off the Mediterranean shore of Israel. It has been speculated that this whale crossed from the Pacific to the Atlantic via the Northwest Passage, since an alternative route around Cape Horn would not be contiguous to the whale&#x27;s established territory. There has been gradual melting and recession of Arctic sea ice with extreme loss in 2007 rendering the Northwest Passage &quot;fully navigable&quot;. The same whale was sighted again on May 30, 2010, off the coast of Barcelona, Spain.

In May 2013, a gray whale was sighted off Walvis Bay, Namibia. Scientists from the Namibian Dolphin Project confirmed the whale&#x27;s identity and thus provides the only sighting of this species in the Southern Hemisphere. Photographic identification suggests that this is a different individual than the one spotted in the Mediterranean in 2010. As of July 2013, the Namibian whale was still being seen regularly.

In March 2021, a gray whale was sighted near Rabat, the capital of Morocco. In April, additional sightings were made off Algeria and Italy.

In December 2023, a gray whale was sighted off Sunny Isles Beach, Florida.

Genetic analysis of fossil and prefossil gray whale remains in the Atlantic Ocean suggests several waves of dispersal from the Pacific to the Atlantic related to successive periods of climactic warming – during the Pleistocene before the last glacial period and the early Holocene immediately following the opening of the Bering Strait. This information and the recent sightings of Pacific gray whales in the Atlantic, suggest that another range expansion to the Atlantic may be starting.

==Life history==
===Reproduction===
Breeding behavior is complex and often involves three or more animals. Both male and female whales reach puberty between the ages of 6 and 12 with an average of eight to nine years. Females show highly synchronized reproduction, undergoing oestrus in late November to early December. During the breeding season, it is common for females to have several mates. This single ovulation event is believed to coincide with the species&#x27; annual migration patterns, when births can occur in warmer waters. Most females show biennial reproduction, although annual births have been reported. Males also show seasonal changes, experiencing an increase in testes mass that correlates with the time females undergo oestrus. Currently there are no accounts of twin births, although an instance of twins &quot;in utero&quot; has been reported.

The gestation period for gray whales is approximately 13  months, with females giving birth every one to three years. In the latter half of the pregnancy, the fetus experiences a rapid growth in length and mass. Similar to the narrow breeding season, most calves are born within a six-week time period in mid January. The calf is born tail first, and measures about 14–16 ft in length, and a weight of 2,000 lbs. Females lactate for approximately seven months following birth, at which point calves are weaned and maternal care begins to decrease. The shallow lagoon waters in which gray whales reproduce are believed to protect the newborn from sharks and orcas.

On 7 January 2014, a pair of newborn or aborted conjoined twin gray whale calves were found dead in the Laguna Ojo de Liebre (Scammon&#x27;s Lagoon), off the west coast of Mexico. They were joined by their bellies.

===Feeding===

The whale feeds mainly on benthic crustaceans (such as amphipods and ghost shrimp), which it eats by turning on its side and scooping up sediments from the sea floor. This unique feeding selection makes gray whales one of the most strongly reliant on coastal waters among baleen whales. It is classified as a baleen whale and has baleen, or whalebone, which acts like a sieve, to capture small sea animals, including amphipods taken in along with sand, water and other material. Off Vancouver Island, gray whales commonly feed on shrimp-like mysids. When mysids are abundant gray whales are present in fairly large numbers. Despite mysids being a prey of choice, gray whales are opportunistic feeders and can easily switch from feeding planktonically to benthically. When gray whales feed planktonically, they roll onto their right side while their fluke remains above the surface, or they apply the skimming method seen in other baleen whales (skimming the surface with their mouth open). This skimming behavior mainly seems to be used when gray whales are feeding on crab larvae. Other prey items include polychaete worms, herring eggs, various forms of larvae, and small fish.

Gray whales feed benthically, by diving to the ocean floor and rolling on to their side, (like blue whales, gray whales seem to favor rolling onto their right side) and suck up prey from the sea floor. Gray whales seem to favor feeding planktonically in their feeding grounds, but benthically along their migration route in shallower water. Mostly, the animal feeds in the northern waters during the summer; and opportunistically feeds during its migration, depending primarily on its extensive fat reserves. Another reason for this opportunistic feeding may be the result of population increases, resulting in the whales taking advantage of whatever prey is available, due to increased competition. Feeding areas during migration seem to include the Gulf of California, Monterey Bay and Baja California Sur. Calf gray whales drink of their mothers&#x27; 53% fat milk per day.

The main feeding habitat of the western Pacific subpopulation is the shallow ( depth) shelf off northeastern Sakhalin Island, particularly off the southern portion of Piltun Lagoon, where the main prey species appear to be amphipods and isopods. In some years, the whales have also used an offshore feeding ground in depth southeast of Chayvo Bay, where benthic amphipods and cumaceans are the main prey species. Some gray whales have also been seen off western Kamchatka, but to date all whales photographed there are also known from the Piltun area.

===Migration===
Predicted distribution models indicate that overall range in the last glacial period was broader or more southerly distributed, and inhabitations in waters where species presences lack in present situation, such as in southern hemisphere and south Asian waters and northern Indian Ocean were possible due to feasibility of the environment on those days. Range expansions due to recoveries and re-colonization in the future is likely to happen and the predicted range covers wider than that of today. The gray whale undergoes the longest migration of any mammal.

====Eastern Pacific population====

Each October, as the northern ice pushes southward, small groups of eastern gray whales in the eastern Pacific start a two- to three-month, trip south. Beginning in the Bering and Chukchi seas and ending in the warm-water lagoons of Mexico&#x27;s Baja California Peninsula and the southern Gulf of California, they travel along the west coast of Canada, the United States and Mexico.

Traveling night and day, the gray whale averages approximately per day at an average speed of . This round trip of is believed to be the longest annual migration of any mammal. By mid-December to early January, the majority are usually found between Monterey and San Diego such as at Morro bay, often visible from shore. The whale watching industry provides ecotourists and marine mammal enthusiasts the opportunity to see groups of gray whales as they migrate.

By late December to early January, eastern grays begin to arrive in the calving lagoons and bays on the west coast of Baja California Sur. The three most popular are San Ignacio, Magdalena Bay to the south, and, to the north, Laguna Ojo de Liebre (formerly known in English as Scammon&#x27;s Lagoon after whaleman Charles Melville Scammon, who discovered the lagoons in the 1850s and hunted the grays).

Gray whales once ranged into Sea of Cortez and Pacific coasts of continental Mexico south to the Islas Marías, Bahía de Banderas, and Nayarit/Jalisco, and there were two modern calving grounds in Sonora (Tojahui or Yavaros) and Sinaloa (Bahia Santa Maria, Bahia Navachiste, La Reforma, Bahia Altata) until being abandoned in the 1980s.

These first whales to arrive are usually pregnant mothers looking for the protection of the lagoons to bear their calves, along with single females seeking mates. By mid-February to mid-March, the bulk of the population has arrived in the lagoons, filling them with nursing, calving and mating gray whales.

Throughout February and March, the first to leave the lagoons are males and females without new calves. Pregnant females and nursing mothers with their newborns are the last to depart, leaving only when their calves are ready for the journey, which is usually from late March to mid-April. Often, a few mothers linger with their young calves well into May. Whale watching in Baja&#x27;s lagoons is particularly popular because the whales often come close enough to boats for tourists to pet them.

By late March or early April, the returning animals can be seen from Puget Sound to Canada.

=====Resident groups=====

A population of about 200 gray whales stay along the eastern Pacific coast from Canada to California throughout the summer, not making the farther trip to Alaskan waters. This summer resident group is known as the Pacific Coast feeding group.

Any historical or current presence of similar groups of residents among the western population is currently unknown, however, whalers&#x27; logbooks and scientific observations indicate that possible year-round occurrences in Chinese waters and Yellow and Bohai basins were likely to be summering grounds. Some of the better documented historical catches show that it was common for whales to stay for months in enclosed waters elsewhere, with known records in the Seto Inland Sea and the Gulf of Tosa. Former feeding areas were once spread over large portions on mid-Honshu to northern Hokkaido, and at least whales were recorded for majority of annual seasons including wintering periods at least along east coasts of Korean Peninsula and Yamaguchi Prefecture. Some recent observations indicate that historic presences of resident whales are possible: a group of two or three were observed feeding in Izu Ōshima in 1994 for almost a month, two single individuals stayed in Ise Bay for almost two months in the 1980s and in 2012, the first confirmed living individuals in Japanese EEZ in the Sea of Japan and the first of living cow-calf pairs since the end of whaling stayed for about three weeks on the coastline of Teradomari in 2014. One of the pair returned to the same coasts at the same time of the year in 2015 again. Reviewing on other cases on different locations among Japanese coasts and islands observed during 2015 indicate that spatial or seasonal residencies regardless of being temporal or permanental staying once occurred throughout many parts of Japan or on other coastal Asia.

====Western population====
The current western gray whale population summers in the Sea of Okhotsk, mainly off Piltun Bay region at the northeastern coast of Sakhalin Island (Russian Federation). There are also occasional sightings off the eastern coast of Kamchatka (Russian Federation) and in other coastal waters of the northern Okhotsk Sea. Its migration routes and wintering grounds are poorly known, the only recent information being from occasional records on both the eastern and western coasts of Japan and along the Chinese coast. Gray whale had not been observed on Commander Islands until 2016. The northwestern pacific population consists of approximately 300 individuals, based on photo identification collected off of Sakhalin Island and Kamchatka.

The Sea of Japan was once thought not to have been a migration route, until several entanglements were recorded. Any records of the species had not been confirmed since after 1921 on Kyushu. However, there were numerous records of whales along the Genkai Sea off Yamaguchi Prefecture, in Ine Bay in the Gulf of Wakasa, and in Tsushima. Gray whales, along with other species such as right whales and Baird&#x27;s beaked whales, were common features off the north eastern coast of Hokkaido near Teshio, Ishikari Bay near Otaru, the Shakotan Peninsula, and islands in the La Pérouse Strait such as Rebun Island and Rishiri Island. These areas may also have included feeding grounds. There are shallow, muddy areas favorable for feeding whales off Shiretoko, such as at Shibetsu, the Notsuke Peninsula, Cape Ochiishi on Nemuro Peninsula, Mutsu Bay, along the Tottori Sand Dunes, in the Suou-nada Sea, and Ōmura Bay.

The historical calving grounds were unknown but might have been along southern Chinese coasts from Zhejiang and Fujian Province to Guangdong, especially south of Hailing Island and to near Hong Kong. Possibilities include Daya Bay, Wailou Harbour on Leizhou Peninsula, and possibly as far south as Hainan Province and Guangxi, particularly around Hainan Island. These areas are at the southwestern end of the known range. It is unknown whether the whales&#x27; normal range once reached further south, to the Gulf of Tonkin. In addition, the existence of historical calving ground on Taiwan and Penghu Islands (with some fossil records and captures), and any presence in other areas outside of the known ranges off Babuyan Islands in Philippines and coastal Vietnamese waters in Gulf of Tonkin are unknown. There is only one confirmed record of accidentally killing of the species in Vietnam, at Ngoc Vung Island off Ha Long Bay in 1994 and the skeleton is on exhibition at the Quang Ninh Provincial Historical Museum. Gray whales are known to occur in Taiwan Strait even in recent years.

It is also unknown whether any winter breeding grounds ever existed beyond Chinese coasts. For example, it is not known if the whales visited the southern coasts of the Korean Peninsula, adjacent to the Island of Jeju), Haiyang Island, the Gulf of Shanghai, or the Zhoushan Archipelago. There is no evidence of historical presence in Japan south of Ōsumi Peninsula; only one skeleton has been discovered in Miyazaki Prefecture. once considered the Seto Inland Sea to be a historical breeding ground, but only a handful of capture records support this idea, although migrations into the sea have been confirmed. Recent studies using genetics and acoustics, suggest that there are several wintering sites for western gray whales such as Mexico and the East China sea. However, their wintering ground habits in the western North Pacific are still poorly understood and additional research is needed.

====Recent migration in Asian waters====

Even though South Korea put the most effort into conservation of the species among the Asian nations, there are no confirmed sightings along the Korean Peninsula or even in the Sea of Japan in recent years.

The last confirmed record in Korean waters was the sighting of a pair off Bangeojin, Ulsan in 1977. Prior to this, the last was of catches of 5 animals off Ulsan in 1966. There was a possible sighting of a whale within the port of Samcheok in 2015.

There had been 24 records along Chinese coasts including sighting, stranding, intended hunts, and bycatches since 1933. The last report of occurrence of the species in Chinese waters was of a stranded semi adult female in the Bohai Sea in 1996, and the only record in Chinese waters in the 21st century was of a fully-grown female being killed by entanglement in Pingtan, China in November, 2007. DNA studies indicated that this individual might have originated from the eastern population rather than the western.

Most notable observations of living whales after the 1980s were of 17 or 18 whales along Primorsky Krai in late October, 1989 (prior to this, a pair was reported swimming in the area in 1987), followed by the record of 14 whales in La Pérouse Strait on 13th, June in 1982 (in this strait, there was another sighting of a pair in October, 1987). In 2011, presences of gray whales were acoustically detected among pelagic waters in East China Sea between Chinese and Japanese waters.

Since the mid-1990s, almost all the confirmed records of living animals in Asian waters were from Japanese coasts. There have been eight to fifteen sightings and stray records including unconfirmed sightings and re-sightings of the same individual, and one later killed by net-entanglement. The most notable of these observations are listed below:

* The feeding activities of a group of two or three whales that stayed around Izu Ōshima in 1994 for almost a month were recorded underwater by several researchers and whale photographers.
* A pair of thin juveniles were sighted off Kuroshio, Kōchi, a renowned town for whale-watching tourism of resident and sub-resident populations of Bryde&#x27;s whales, in 1997. This sighting was unusual because of the location on mid-latitude in summer time.
* Another pair of sub-adults were confirmed swimming near the mouth of Otani River in Suruga Bay in May, 2003.
* A sub-adult whale that stayed in the Ise and Mikawa Bay for nearly two months in 2012 was later confirmed to be the same individual as the small whale observed off Tahara near Cape Irago in 2010, making it the first confirmed constant migration out of Russian waters. The juvenile observed off Owase in Kumanonada Sea in 2009 might or might not be the same individual. The Ise and Mikawa Bay region is the only location along Japanese coasts that has several records since the 1980s (a mortal entanglement in 1968, above mentioned short-stay in 1982, self-freeing entanglement in 2005), and is also the location where the first commercial whaling started. Other areas with several sighting or stranding records in recent years are off the Kumanonada Sea in Wakayama, off Oshika Peninsula in Tōhoku, and on coastlines close to Tomakomai, Hokkaido.
* Possibly the first confirmed record of living animals in Japanese waters in the Sea of Japan since the end of whaling occurred on 3 April 2014 at Nodumi Beach, Teradomari, Niigata. Two individuals, measuring ten and five metres respectively, stayed near the mouth of Shinano River for three weeks. It is unknown whether this was a cow-calf pair, which would have been a first record in Asia. All of the previous modern records in the Sea of Japan were of by-catches.
* One of the above pair returned on the same beaches at the same time of a year in 2015.
*A juvenile or possibly or not with another larger individual remained in Japanese waters between January or March and May 2015. It was first confirmed occurrences of the species on remote, oceanic islands in Japan. One or more visited waters firstly on Kōzu-shima and Nii-Jima for weeks then adjacent to Miho no Matsubara and behind the Tokai University campus for several weeks. Possibly the same individual was seen off Futo as well. This later was identified as the same individual previously recorded on Sakhalin in 2014, the first re-recording one individual at different Asian locations.
* A young whale was observed by land-based fishermen at Cape Irago in March, 2015.
* One of the above pair appeared in 2015 off southeastern Japan and then reappeared off Tateyama in January, 2016. The identity of this whale was confirmed by Nana Takanawa who photographed the same whale on Niijima in 2015. Likely the same individual was sighted off Futo and half an hour later off Akazawa beach in Itō, Shizuoka on the 14th. The whale then stayed next to a pier on Miyake-jima and later at Habushi beach on Niijima, the same beach the same individual stayed near on the previous year.
* One whale of was beached nearby Wadaura on March 4, 2016. Investigations on the corpse indicate that this was likely a different individual from the above animal.
* A carcass of young female was firstly reported floating along Atami on 4 April then was washed ashore on Ito on the 6th.
* As of April 20, 2017, one or more whale(s) have been staying within Tokyo Bay since February although at one point another whale if or if not the same individual sighted off Hayama, Kanagawa. It is unclear the exact number of whales included in these sightings; two whales reported by fishermen and Japanese coastal guard reported three whales on 20th or 21st.

==Whaling==

===North Pacific===
====Eastern population====
Humans and orcas are the adult gray whale&#x27;s only predators, although orcas are the more prominent predator. Aboriginal hunters, including those on Vancouver Island and the Makah in Washington, have hunted gray whales.

Commercial whaling by Europeans of the species in the North Pacific began in the winter of 1845–46, when two United States ships, the &quot;Hibernia&quot; and the &quot;United States&quot;, under Captains Smith and Stevens, caught 32 in Magdalena Bay. More ships followed in the two following winters, after which gray whaling in the bay was nearly abandoned because &quot;of the inferior quality and low price of the dark-colored gray whale oil, the low quality and quantity of whalebone from the gray, and the dangers of lagoon whaling.&quot;

Gray whaling in Magdalena Bay was revived in the winter of 1855–56 by several vessels, mainly from San Francisco, including the ship &quot;Leonore&quot;, under Captain Charles Melville Scammon. This was the first of 11 winters from 1855 through 1865 known as the &quot;bonanza period&quot;, during which gray whaling along the coast of Baja California reached its peak. Not only were the whales taken in Magdalena Bay, but also by ships anchored along the coast from San Diego south to Cabo San Lucas and from whaling stations from Crescent City in northern California south to San Ignacio Lagoon. During the same period, vessels targeting right and bowhead whales in the Gulf of Alaska, Sea of Okhotsk, and the Western Arctic would take the odd gray whale if neither of the more desirable two species were in sight.

In December 1857, Charles Scammon, in the brig &quot;Boston&quot;, along with his schooner-tender &quot;Marin&quot;, entered Laguna Ojo de Liebre (Jack-Rabbit Spring Lagoon) or later known as Scammon&#x27;s Lagoon (by 1860) and found one of the gray&#x27;s last refuges. He caught 20 whales. He returned the following winter (1858–59) with the bark &quot;Ocean Bird&quot; and schooner tenders &quot;A.M. Simpson&quot; and &quot;Kate&quot;. In three months, he caught 47 cows, yielding of oil. In the winter of 1859–60, Scammon, again in the bark &quot;Ocean Bird&quot;, along with several other vessels, entered San Ignacio Lagoon to the south where he discovered the last breeding lagoon. Within only a couple of seasons, the lagoon was nearly devoid of whales.

Between 1846 and 1874, an estimated 8,000 gray whales were killed by American and European whalemen, with over half having been killed in the Magdalena Bay complex (Estero Santo Domingo, Magdalena Bay itself, and Almejas Bay) and by shore whalemen in California and Baja California.

A second, shorter, and less intensive hunt occurred for gray whales in the eastern North Pacific. Only a few were caught from two whaling stations on the coast of California from 1919 to 1926, and a single station in Washington (1911–21) accounted for the capture of another. For the entire west coast of North America for the years 1919 to 1929, 234 gray whales were caught. Only a dozen or so were taken by British Columbian stations, nearly all of them in 1953 at Coal Harbour. A whaling station in Richmond, California, caught 311 gray whales for &quot;scientific purposes&quot; between 1964 and 1969. From 1961 to 1972, the Soviet Union caught 138 gray whales (they originally reported not having taken any). The only other significant catch was made in two seasons by the steam-schooner &quot;California&quot; off Malibu, California. In the winters of 1934–35 and 1935–36, the &quot;California&quot; anchored off Point Dume in Paradise Cove, processing gray whales. In 1936, gray whales became protected in the United States.

====Western population====
The Japanese began to catch gray whales beginning in the 1570s. At Kawajiri, Nagato, 169 gray whales were caught between 1698 and 1889. At Tsuro, Shikoku, 201 were taken between 1849 and 1896. Several hundred more were probably caught by American and European whalemen in the Sea of Okhotsk from the 1840s to the early 20th century. Whalemen caught 44 with nets in Japan during the 1890s. The real damage was done between 1911 and 1933, when Japanese whalemen killed 1,449 after Japanese companies established several whaling stations on Korean Peninsula and on Chinese coast such as near the Daya bay and on Hainan Island. By 1934, the western gray whale was near extinction. From 1891 to 1966, an estimated 1,800–2,000 gray whales were caught, with peak catches of between 100 and 200 annually occurring in the 1910s.

As of 2001, the Californian gray whale population had grown to about 26,000. As of 2016, the population of western Pacific (seas near Korea, Japan, and Kamchatka) gray whales was an estimated 200.

===North Atlantic===
The North Atlantic population may have been hunted to extinction in the 18th century. Circumstantial evidence indicates whaling could have contributed to this population&#x27;s decline, as the increase in whaling activity in the 17th and 18th centuries coincided with the population&#x27;s disappearance. A. B. Van Deinse points out the &quot;scrag whale&quot;, described by P. Dudley in 1725, as one target of early New England whalers, was almost certainly the gray whale. In his 1835 history of Nantucket Island, Obed Macy wrote that in the early pre-1672 colony, a whale of the kind called &quot;scragg&quot; entered the harbor and was pursued and killed by the settlers. Gray whales (Icelandic &quot;sandlægja&quot;) were described in Iceland in the early 17th century. Formations of commercial whaling among the Mediterranean basin(s) have been considered to be feasible as well.

==Conservation==

Gray whales have been granted protection from commercial hunting by the International Whaling Commission (IWC) since 1949, and are no longer hunted on a large scale.

Limited hunting of gray whales has continued since that time, however, primarily in the Chukotka region of northeastern Russia, where large numbers of gray whales spend the summer months. This hunt has been allowed under an &quot;aboriginal/subsistence whaling&quot; exception to the commercial-hunting ban. Anti-whaling groups have protested the hunt, saying the meat from the whales is not for traditional native consumption, but is used instead to feed animals in government-run fur farms; they cite annual catch numbers that rose dramatically during the 1940s, at the time when state-run fur farms were being established in the region. Although the Soviet government denied these charges as recently as 1987, in recent years the Russian government has acknowledged the practice. The Russian IWC delegation has said that the hunt is justified under the aboriginal/subsistence exemption, since the fur farms provide a necessary economic base for the region&#x27;s native population.

Currently, the annual quota for the gray whale catch in the region is 140 per year. Pursuant to an agreement between the United States and Russia, the Makah tribe of Washington claimed four whales from the IWC quota established at the 1997 meeting. With the exception of a single gray whale killed in 1999, the Makah people have been prevented from hunting by a series of legal challenges, culminating in a United States federal appeals court decision in December 2002 that required the National Marine Fisheries Service to prepare an Environmental Impact Statement. On September 8, 2007, five members of the Makah tribe shot a gray whale using high-powered rifles in spite of the decision. The whale died within 12 hours, sinking while heading out to sea.

As of 2018, the IUCN regards the gray whale as being of &quot;least concern&quot; from a conservation perspective. However, the specific subpopulation in the northwest Pacific is regarded as being &quot;critically endangered&quot;. The northwest Pacific population is also listed as endangered by the U.S. government&#x27;s National Marine Fisheries Service under the U.S. Endangered Species Act. The IWC Bowhead, Right and Gray Whale subcommittee in 2011 reiterated the conservation risk to western gray whales is large because of the small size of the population and the potential anthropogenic impacts.

Gray whale migrations off of the Pacific Coast were observed, initially, by Marineland of the Pacific in Palos Verdes, California. The Gray Whale Census, an official gray whale migration census that has been recording data on the migration of the Pacific gray whale has been keeping track of the population of the Pacific gray whale since 1985. This census is the longest running census of the Pacific gray whale. Census keepers volunteer from December 1 through May, from sun up to sun down, seven days a week, keeping track of the amount of gray whales migrating through the area off of Los Angeles. Information from this census is listed through the American Cetacean Society of Los Angeles (ACSLA).

South Korea and China list gray whales as protected species of high concern. In South Korea, the was registered as the 126th national monument in 1962, although illegal hunts have taken place thereafter, and there have been no recent sightings of the species in Korean waters.

===Rewilding proposal===
In 2005, two conservation biologists proposed a plan to airlift 50 gray whales from the Pacific Ocean to the Atlantic Ocean. They reasoned that, as Californian gray whales had replenished to a suitable population, surplus whales could be transported to repopulate the extinct British population. this plan has not been undertaken.

==Threats==
According to the Government of Canada&#x27;s Management Plan for gray whales, threats to the eastern North Pacific population of gray whales include: increased human activities in their breeding lagoons in Mexico, climate change, acute noise, toxic spills, aboriginal whaling, entanglement with fishing gear, boat collisions, and possible impacts from fossil fuel exploration and extraction.

Western gray whales are facing large-scale offshore oil and gas development programs near their summer feeding grounds, as well as fatal net entrapments off Japan during migration, which pose significant threats to the future survival of the population. The substantial nearshore industrialization and shipping congestion throughout the migratory corridors of the western gray whale population represent potential threats by increasing the likelihood of exposure to ship strikes, chemical pollution, and general disturbance.

Offshore gas and oil development in the Okhotsk Sea within of the primary feeding ground off northeast Sakhalin Island is of particular concern. Activities related to oil and gas exploration, including geophysical seismic surveying, pipelaying and drilling operations, increased vessel traffic, and oil spills, all pose potential threats to western gray whales. Disturbance from underwater industrial noise may displace whales from critical feeding habitat. Physical habitat damage from drilling and dredging operations, combined with possible impacts of oil and chemical spills on benthic prey communities also warrants concern. The western gray whale population is considered to be endangered according to IUCN standards.

Along Japanese coasts, four females including a cow-calf pair were trapped and killed in nets in the 2000s. There had been a record of dead whale thought to be harpooned by dolphin-hunters found on Hokkaido in the 1990s. Meats for sale were also discovered in Japanese markets as well.

2019 has had a record number of gray whale strandings and deaths, with 122 strandings in United States waters and 214 in Canadian waters. The cause of death in some specimens appears to be related to poor nutritional condition. It is hypothesized that some of these strandings are related to changes in prey abundance or quality in the Arctic feeding grounds, resulting in poor feeding. Some scientists suggest that the lack of sea ice has been preventing the fertilization of amphipods, a main source of food for gray whales, so that they have been hunting krill instead, which is far less nutritious. More research needs to be conducted to understand this issue.

A recent study provides some evidence that solar activity is correlated to gray whale strandings. When there was a high prevalence of sunspots, gray whales were five times more likely to strand. A possible explanation for this phenomenon is that solar storms release a large amount of electromagnetic radiation, which disrupts Earth&#x27;s magnetic field and/or the whale&#x27;s ability to analyze it. This may apply to the other species of cetaceans, such as sperm whales. However, there is not enough evidence to suggest that whales navigate through the use of magnetoreception (an organism&#x27;s ability to sense a magnetic field).

Orcas are &quot;a prime predator of gray whale calves.&quot; Typically three to four orcas ram a calf from beneath in order to separate it from its mother, who defends it. Humpback whales have been observed defending gray whale calves from orcas. Orcas will often arrive in Monterey Bay to intercept gray whales during their northbound migration, targeting females migrating with newborn calves. They will separate the calf from the mother and hold the calf under water to drown it. The tactic of holding whales under water to drown them is certainly used by orcas on adult gray whales as well. It is roughly estimated that 33% of the gray whales born in a given year might be killed by predation.

==Captivity==

Because of their size and need to migrate, gray whales have rarely been held in captivity, and then only for brief periods of time. The first captive gray whale, who was captured in Scammon&#x27;s Lagoon, Baja California in 1965, was named Gigi and died two months later from an infection. The second gray whale, who was captured in 1972 from the same lagoon, was named Gigi II and was released a year later after becoming too large for the facilities. The third gray whale, J.J., first beached herself in Marina del Rey, California where she was rushed to SeaWorld San Diego. After 14 months, she was released because she also grew too large to be cared for in the existing facilities. At and when she was released, J.J. was the largest marine mammal ever to be kept in captivity.

<doc id="13027" wikidata="Q3465" url="?curid=13027" title="Jinn">
<text>Jinn (), also romanized as djinn or anglicized as genies, are invisible creatures in early pre-Islamic Arabia and later in Islamic culture and beliefs. Like humans, they are accountable for their deeds and can be either believers (Mu&#x27;minun) or unbelievers (&quot;kuffar&quot;), depending on whether they accept God&#x27;s guidance. 

Since jinn are neither innately evil nor innately good, Islam acknowledged spirits from other religions and could adapt them during its expansion. Jinn are not a strictly Islamic concept; they may represent several pagan beliefs integrated into Islam. Islam places jinn and humans on the same plane in relation to God, both being subject to God&#x27;s judgement and an afterlife. The Quran condemns the pre-Islamic Arabian practice of worshipping or seeking protection from them.

Although usually invisible, jinn are supposed to be composed of thin and subtle bodies (), and can change at will. They favor a snake form, but can also choose to appear as scorpions, lizards, or humans. They may even engage in sexual affairs with humans and produce offspring. If they are injured by someone, they usually seek revenge or possess the assailant&#x27;s body, requiring exorcism. Jinn rarely meddle in human affairs, preferring to live with their own kind in tribes similar to those of pre-Islamic Arabia.

Individual jinn appear on charms and talismans. They are called upon for protection or magical aid, often under the leadership of a king. Many people who believe in jinn wear amulets to protect themselves against the assaults of the jinn, sent out by sorcerers and witches. A commonly held belief is that jinn cannot hurt someone who wears something with the name of God written on it. While some Muslim scholars in the past had ambivalent attitudes towards jinn, contemporary Muslim scholarship increasingly associate jinn with idolatry.

==Etymology and translation==
&quot;Jinn&quot; is an Arabic collective noun deriving from the Semitic root (, &quot;jann&quot;), whose primary meaning is &#x27;to hide&#x27; or &#x27;to adapt&#x27;. Some authors interpret the word to mean, literally, &#x27;beings that are concealed from the senses&#x27;.
Cognates include the Arabic &#x27; (, &#x27;possessed&#x27; or, generally, &#x27;insane&#x27;), &#x27; (, &#x27;garden&#x27;, &#x27;eden&#x27; or &#x27;heaven&#x27;), and &quot;&quot; (, &#x27;embryo&#x27;).
&quot;Jinn&quot; is properly treated as a plural (however in Classical Arabic, may also appear as &quot;jānn&quot;, ), with the singular being &quot;jinnī&quot; (), which the English word &quot;genie&quot; is derived from.

The origin of the word &quot;jinn&quot; remains uncertain. Some scholars relate the Arabic term &quot;jinn&quot; to the Latin &quot;genius&quot; – a guardian spirit of people and places in Roman religion – as a result of syncretism during the reign of the Roman empire under Tiberius and Augustus; however, this derivation is also disputed. Supporters argue that both Roman genii as well as Arabian jinn are considered to be lesser deities inhabiting local sanctuaries, trees or springs, and persons or families. Aramaic &quot;ginnaya&quot; () with the meaning of &#x27;tutelary deity&#x27; or &#x27;guardian&#x27; are attributed to similar functions and are another possible origin of the term &quot;jinn&quot;.

Another suggestion holds that the word is of Persian origin and appeared in the form of the Avestic &quot;Jaini&quot;, a wicked (female) spirit. Jaini were among various creatures in the possibly even pre-Zoroastrian mythology of peoples of Iran. Wensick advocates a purely Arabic origin of the term, asserting that according to the common Semitic view psychic and bodily affections are caused by spirits. An object reacting upon such an affect would be an incarnation of said spirit. Since these spirits are covered from the sight of humans, they would have been called jinn.

The anglicized form &quot;genie&quot; is a borrowing of the French &quot;&quot;, also from the Latin &quot;genius&quot;. It first appeared in 18th century translations of the &quot;Thousand and One Nights&quot; from the 1706 French edition,
where it had been used owing to its rough similarity in sound and sense and further applies to benevolent intermediary spirits, in contrast to the malevolent spirits called &#x27;demon&#x27; and mostly-benevolent &#x27;heavenly angels&#x27;, in literature.
In Assyrian art, the modern term used for creatures ontologically between humans and divinities is also &quot;genie&quot;.

Though not a precise fit, descriptive analogies that have been used for these beings in Western thought include &quot;demon&quot;, &quot;spirit&quot;, &quot;sprite&quot;, and &quot;fairy&quot;, depending on source.
In turn, the Arabic translation for the Greek nymph (&quot;&#x27;arūsa&quot;) is also used for jinn by Middle Eastern sources.
Although the term &quot;spirit&quot; is frequently used, it has been criticised for not capturing the corporeal nature of the jinn, and that the term &quot;genie&quot; should be used instead.

== Pre-Islamic era ==
The exact origins of belief in jinn are not entirely clear. Belief in jinn in pre-Islamic Arab religion is testified not only by the Quran, but also by pre-Islamic Arabic poetry. Some scholars of the Middle East hold that they originated as malevolent spirits residing in deserts and unclean places, who often took the forms of animals; others hold that they were originally pagan nature deities who gradually became marginalized as other deities took greater importance.

=== Fear and veneration ===
Jinn were already worshipped by many Arabs in pre-Islamic Arabia. Julius Wellhausen observed that jinn were often thought to &quot;inhabit or haunt desolate, dark and dingy places in the desert&quot;. For that reason, they were held responsible for various diseases and mental illnesses. Emilie Savage-Smith asserts that malicious jinn and good gods were distinct in pre-Islamic Arabia, but admits that such distinction is not absolute. In the regions north to the Hejaz, Palmyra and Baalbek, the terms &quot;jinni&quot; and &quot;ilah&quot; (deity) were often used interchangeably. Julius Wellhausen likewise agrees that in pre-Islamic Arabia it was assumed there are at least some friendly and helpful beings among the jinn. He distinguishes between a god and a jinni, not on the basis of morality, but on the basis of worship; the jinn are worshipped in private while the gods are worshipped in public.

Al-Jahiz credits the pre-Islamic Arabs with believing that the society of jinn constitutes several tribes and groups, analogous to pre-Islamic Arabian culture. Jinn could also protect, marry, kidnap, possess, and kill people. Despite being invisible, jinn are considered to have bodies (&quot;ajsām&quot;), as described by Zakariya al-Qazwini, they are among animals, along with humans, burdened beasts (like horses), cattle, wildebeests, birds, and reptiles. Jinn are further known as shapeshifters, often assuming the form of an animal, favoring the form of a snake. Other chthonic animals regarded as forms of jinn include scorpions and lizards. Both scorpions and serpents have been venerated in the ancient Near East.

When they shift into a human form however, they are said to stay partly animal and are not fully human. Although the power of jinn usually exceed those of humans, it is conceivable a man could kill a jinni in single combat, but they are feared for attacking without being seen. Some sources even speak of killed jinn leaving behind a carcass similar to either a serpent or a scorpion.

=== Poetry and soothsaying ===
Despite that they were often feared or inspired awe, the jinn were also pictured to befriend humans or have romantic feelings for them. According to common Arabian belief, pre-Islamic soothsayers, philosophers, and poets were inspired by the jinn.

The Arabian poet al-A&#x27;sha (d. after 3/625) is said to have gotten his inspiration for his poetry by a friend named Misḥal (&quot;daʿawtu khalīlī Misḥalan&quot;) and further calls him his jinni-brother (&quot;akhī ʾl-jinnī&quot;). Similarly, the poet Thābit (d. 54/674) who later converted to Islam and became known as &quot;the poet of the prophet&quot;, referred to his jinni-friend as his &quot;sharp-sighted brother from the jinn&quot; (&quot;wa-akhī min al-jinn al-baṣīr&quot;). The relationship between jinn and humans can also be romantic in nature. According to one famous Arabian story, the jinni Manzur fell in love with a human woman called Habbah. He is supposed to have taught her the arts of healing.
The mutual relationship between jinn and humans is different than that of a jinni and a soothsayer (&quot;kāhin&quot;). The soothsayer is presented as someone who is totally controlled by the jinni entering. The soothsayer was consulted to reveal hidden information or settle disputes, as it was believed, the jinn speaking through them revealed hidden knowledge.

==Islam==
Jinn have been called an integral part of the Muslim tradition or faith, completely accepted in official Islam;
prominently featured in folklore. Medieval and modern scholars have studied the consequences implied by their existence, legal status, the possible relations between them and mankind, especially in questions of marriage and property.

=== Quran ===

Jinn are mentioned approximately 29 times in the Quran, exclusively in Meccan surahs. The Quran assumes that the audience is familiar with the subject without elaborating on the jinn much further. According to the , Muhammad was sent as a prophet to both human and jinn communities, and prophets and messengers were sent to both communities.

Throughout the Quran, humans and jinn (&quot;al-ins wa-l-jinn&quot;) appear frequently as a pair, designating their equal status in regards of their creation and rejecting that jinn share divinity with the Creator. The term &quot;ins&quot; derives from &quot;anisa&quot;, which means &quot;to be familiar with&quot;, and refers to recognisable familiar human beings. In contrast, the term &quot;jinn&quot; refers to foreign, invisible, or unknown anthropomorphic beings, which are nonetheless subject to the same considerations as the former. They were both created to worship God (). Because they are supposed to worship God from free will, they are both able for good and evil deeds (, ). They are, like humans, rational beings formed of nations ().

Surah al-jinn is about the revelation to jinn. The same Surah mentions righteous jinn on one hand, and malicious jinn on the other. The jinn can neither harm nor benefit humans, for they are occupied with looking after themselves and their own place in the cosmos. This is in notable contrast to demons and devils in the Judeo-Christian tradition. The Quran does not condemn the jinn as a source of harm, but by mistaking them for beings deserving cultic veneration (). Jinn and humans are blamed for ascribing divine attributes to another creature (i.e. jinn); jinn to themselves and humans to the jinn.

In the Quranic account, despite their similarities, there are important differences between the two species. Whereas humans are made from &quot;clay&quot; or &quot;dirt&quot;, jinn were created from &quot;smokeless fire&quot; (, ), which is possibly the reason why they are credited with some extraordinary abilities, such as invisibility, transformation, and ascending into the air like devils (). Despite some superhuman powers, the jinn occupy no fundamentally different position in the Quran than humans. Like humans, the jinn have no knowledge of the future. Like humanity, jinn face epistemic limitations regarding &quot;the hidden/occult&quot;, have to rely on God&#x27;s messengers, and face eschatological judgement.

=== Exegesis ===
In Quranic interpretation, the term &quot;jinn&quot; can be used in two different ways:

# a specific invisible being, offspring of &quot;abu Jann&quot; considered to be, along with humans, &quot;thaqalān&quot; (accountable for their deeds), created out of &quot;fire and air&quot; (, &quot;mārijin min nār&quot;).
# any object that cannot be detected by human sensory organs, including angels, devils, and the (spiritual) interior of human beings.

Belief in jinn is not included among the six articles of Islamic faith, as belief in angels is. Nonetheless, many Muslim scholars, including the Hanbalī scholar ibn Taymiyya and the Ẓāhirī scholar ibn Hazm, believe they are essential to the Islamic faith since they are mentioned in the Quran. It is generally accepted by the majority of Muslim scholars that jinn can possess individuals. This is considered to be part of the doctrines (&quot;aqidah&quot;) of the &quot;people of the Sunnah&quot; (&quot;ahl as-sunnah wal-jammah&#x27;a&quot;) in the tradition of Ash&#x27;ari. The Atharī scholars ibn Taimiyya and ibn Qayyim agree on this matter. From among the Sunni schools of theology, only the Māturīdīs seems to debate possession. Al-Rustughfanī deemed jinn-possession impossible.

Al-Māturīdī focuses on the dynamics between jinn and humans based on . He states that seeking refuge among the jinn increases fear and anxiety, however, not because of the jinn, but due to the psychological dependence of the individual towards external powers. By that, he refers to seeking refuge among the jinn as a form of &quot;širk&quot;, due to the reliance on a created thing instead of God.

Although jinn frequently appear in hagiographic Sufi literature and their existence is never doubted, they do not play any major role in Sufi cosmology. Because of their similarities to humans, they function neither as a model to follow (like angels) nor tempters of the lower self (like Satan) and mostly feature in poetic anecdotes.

=== Jurisprudence===
The jinn are obligated to follow the divine law (&quot;sharīʿa&quot;), as derived from the Quran by Muslim jurists (&quot;faqīh&quot;). Thus, the jinn are considered, along with humans, to be &quot;mukallāf&quot;. Believers among the jinn are called &quot;Muslim jinn&quot; (&quot;muslimū l-jinn&quot;).

Since both creations must perform the required prayers (&quot;salah&quot;), Muslim jurists debated if one is allowed to perform the prayer behind a jinni. Shibli cites two Hanbalite scholars who regard this as permissible without hesitation. Since Muhammad was sent to jinn and humans, both are &quot;mukallāf&quot; and subject to the command to pray.

Because humans and jinn are capable of procreation, Muslim jurists dealt with the issue of permissibility of intercourse between these two types of creatures. Some &quot;Ḥadīths&quot;, though considered fabricated (&quot;mawḍūʻ&quot;) by some &quot;muhaddith (hadith scholars)&quot;, pushed the necessity for an explanation: 
Although there are recorded cases of purported human-jinn relationships most Muslim jurists agree that such a relationship is not permissible. Even those scholars who allowed such relationships, still considered them undesirable (&quot;makruh&quot;). Offspring of human-jinn relationships are nonetheless, usually considered to be gifted and talented people with special abilities.

===Folklore===

The jinn (also known as: , , ) were adopted by later Islamic culture, since the Quran affirms their existence. Although depictions are categorized into &quot;little tradition&quot; (folklore) and &quot;greater tradition&quot; (official Islam) for research purposes, both depictions are largely the same.

The Quran does not consider foreign mythological beings to be devils, but entities erroneously ascribed divine power to. Therefore, jinn were considered a third class of invisible beings, often neutral or morally ambiguous, not consequently equated with devils. Islam allowed to integrate local beliefs about spirits and deities from Iran, Africa, Turkey and India, into a monotheistic framework without demonizing them. Besides local deities, the existence of purely malevolent spirits is also acknowledged. Thus, jinn exist alongside other mythological entities, such as demons (&quot;Dēw&quot;) and &quot;fairies&quot; (&quot;parī&quot;).

The moral attitude of the jinn is usually associated with their religion. Good jinn are usually considered &quot;Muslim jinn&quot; or &quot;jinn Islam&quot;, whereas unbelieving jinn were tempted by the devils (&quot;shayatin&quot;) and are called &quot;kāfir jinn&quot; or &quot;jinn kāfir&quot;. Besides Islam, they could also practise Christianity and Judaism. Good jinn might teach people moral lessons and might be benevolent, or aid spiritual persons, such as shamans (&quot;kam&quot;) in Central Asia, or spiritual healers in Senegal. Mediha Esenel&#x27;s studies in 1940 Anatolia mentions the belief that spiritually gifted people can act as intermediaries between humans and jinn.

Most of the time, jinn are believed not to interfere with humans and live mostly in desolate or abandoned places. This is, for example, evident from the Turkish phrase &quot;İn Cin top oynuyor&quot;. It is only when they are angered or disturbed, for example, if their children are trodden upon or hot water is thrown on them, that they take revenge on humans. For this reason, Muslims utter &quot;destur&quot; (permission), before doing something which might accidentally hurt jinn, such as sprinkling hot water on public grounds or into bushes, so present jinn are advised to leave the place.

Angered or straightforwardly evil mannered jinn, could hurt people by inflicting physical damage, causing illness, or taking control over a human&#x27;s body. A human can be controlled by jinn under certain circumstances. The individual needs to be in a state of &quot;dha&#x27;iyfah&quot; (Arabic: ضَعِيفَة, &quot;(mental) weakness&quot;). Feelings of insecurity, mental instability, unhappy love and depression (being &quot;tired from the soul&quot;) are forms of &quot;dha&#x27;iyfah&quot;. In that case, it is believed that an exorcism is required to save the person from the assaulting jinni. To protect oneself from jinn, many Muslims wear amulets with the name of God graved on. Jinn are also said to be scared of iron and wolves.

==Modern and post-modern era==
=== Post-modern literature and movies ===

Jinn feature in the magical realism genre, introduced into Turkish literature by Latife Tekin (1983), who uses magical elements known from pre-Islamic and Islamic Anatolian lore. Since the 1980s, this genre has become prominent in Turkish literature. The story by Tekin deals with folkloric and religious belief in a rationalized society.

Contrary to the neutral to positive depiction of jinn in Tekin&#x27;s novels, since 2004 jinn have become a common trope in Middle Eastern horror movies. The presentation of jinn usually combines Quranic with oral and cultural beliefs about jinn. Out of 89 films, 59 have direct references to jinn as the antagonist, 12 use other sorts of demons, while other types of horror, such as the impending apocalypse, hauntings, or ghosts, constitute only 14 films. The popularity of jinn as a choice of monster can best be explained by their affirmation in the Quran. They are still a popular trope today. A study from 2020 shows that jinn are still the favorite horror element among teenagers. Jinn further feature in Iranian horror movies.

=== Prevalence of belief ===

Though discouraged by some teachings of modern Islam, cultural beliefs about jinn remain popular among Muslim societies and their understanding of cosmology and anthropology. Affirmation on the existence of jinn as sapient creatures living along with humans is still widespread in the Middle Eastern world (including Egypt), and West Africa, mental illnesses are still often attributed to jinn possession. 

Since modern times, jinn were often portrayed in a more negative light. After the failure of the rebellion against the East India Company, the Muslim elite regarded jinn-veneration in India as a superstitional belief and hinders the common people to instigate military power. Similarly, the Deobandi movement, although not denying the reality of jinn, mostly depicts jinn as malevolent beings who need to be avoided or exorcised. In modern Iran, (evil) jinn are often substituted by devils. Similarly, in many modern tales, the term &quot;jinn&quot; is used for &quot;div&quot; (demon), causing a shift in meaning. Nonetheless, traditional belief in jinn remains popular in Islamic culture. The negative evaluations of jinn are not static, but rather entangled with traditional and also positive depictions of jinn.

According to a survey undertaken by the Pew Research Center in 2012:

The amount of Muslims believing in jinn from Bosnia and Herzegovina is higher than the general European average (30%), although only 21% believe in sorcery and 13% would wear talisman for protection against jinn; 12% support offerings and appeal given to the jinn.

Sleep paralysis is understood as a &quot;jinn attack&quot; by many sleep paralysis sufferers in Egypt, as discovered by a Cambridge neuroscience study Jalal, Simons-Rudolph, Jalal, &amp; Hinton (2013). The study found that as many as 48% of those who experience sleep paralysis in Egypt believe it to be an assault by the jinn. Almost all of these sleep paralysis sufferers (95%) would recite verses from the Quran during sleep paralysis to prevent future &quot;jinn attacks&quot;. In addition, some (9%) would increase their daily Islamic prayer (&quot;ṣalāh&quot;) to get rid of these assaults by jinn. Sleep paralysis is generally associated with great fear in Egypt, especially if believed to be supernatural in origin.

Similarly, European patients with a Muslim background often attribute mental illnesses to jinn. Most common attributations to jinn are symptoms of hallucination and psychotic symptoms, but can also include mood disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), Capgras syndrome, and epilepsy.
It has been noted that not all Muslims who believe in jinn, believe they can possess people. Furthermore, belief in possession is not limited to Muslims. Contrary to the assumption that higher education is proportional to disenchantment, belief in jinn-possession may remain intact even after medical graduation.

== Visual art ==

Although there are very few visual representations of jinn in Islamic art, when they do appear, it is usually related to a specific event or individual jinn.

Visual representations of jinn appear in manuscripts and their existence is often implied in works of architecture by the presence of apotropaic devices like serpents, which were intended to ward off evil spirits. Lastly, King Solomon is illustrated very often with jinn as the commander of an army that included them.

=== Architectural representation ===

In addition to these representations of jinn in vicinity to kingship, there were also architectural references to jinn throughout the Islamic world. In the Citadel of Aleppo, the entrance gate Bab al-Hayyat made reference to jinn in the stone relief carvings of serpents; likewise, the water gate at Ayyubid Harran housed two copper sculptures of jinn, serving as talismans to ward off both snakes and evil jinn in the form of snakes.

Alongside these depictions of the jinn found at the Aleppo Citadel, depictions of the jinn can be found in the Rūm Seljuk palace. There are a phenomenal range of creatures that can be found on the eight-pointed tiles of the Seal of Sulaymān device. Among these were the jinn, that belonged among Solomon&#x27;s army and as Solomon claimed to have control over the jinn, so did the Rūm Seljuk sultan that claimed to be the Sulaymān of his time. In fact, one of the most common representations of jinn are alongside or in association with King Solomon. It was thought that King Solomon had very close ties to the jinn, and even had control over many of them. The idea that a great and just ruler commands jinn was also extended to other emperors, such as Alexander the Great.

Given this association, jinn were often seen with Solomon in a princely or kingly context, such as the small, animal-like jinn sitting beside King Solomon on his throne illustrated in an illuminated manuscript of &quot;Aja&#x27;ib al-Makhluqat&quot; by Zakariya al-Qazwini, written in the 13th century.

=== Talismanic representation ===

The jinn had an indirect impact on Islamic art through the creation of talismans that were alleged to guard the bearer from the jinn and were enclosed in leather and included Qur&#x27;anic verses. It was not unusual for those talismans to be inscribed with separated Arabic letters, because the separation of those letters was thought to positively affect the potency of the talisman overall. An object that was inscribed with the word of &quot;Allah&quot; was thought to have the power to ward off evil from the person who obtained the object, though many of these objects also had astrological signs, depictions of prophets, or religious narratives.

=== In the &quot;Kitāb al-Bulhān&quot; ===

In the &quot;Book of Wonders&quot; compiled in the 14th century by Abd al-Hasan al-Isfahani, there are illustrations of various supernatural beings (demons, &quot;ʿafārīt&quot;, jinn, the evil eye, devils, lilith, celestial spirits, etc.).

Each celestial spirit is referred to as a &quot;King of the Jinn&quot;, represented alongside his spiritual helpers and alongside the corresponding talismanic symbols. For instance, the &#x27;Red King of Tuesday&#x27; was depicted in the &quot;Book of Wonders&quot; as a sinister form astride a lion. In the same illustration, he holds a severed head and a sword, because the &#x27;Red King of Tuesday&#x27; was aligned with Mars, the god of war. Alongside that, there were illustrations of the &#x27;Gold King&#x27; and the &#x27;White King&#x27;.

Aside from the seven &#x27;Kings of the Jinn&#x27;, the &quot;Book of Wonders&quot; included an illustration of &quot;Huma&quot; (Arabic: حمى), or the &#x27;Fever&#x27;. &quot;Huma&quot; was depicted as three-headed and as embracing the room around him, in order to capture someone and bring on a fever in them.

== Magical practises ==
Jinn might be invoked, along with demons and devils, for means of sorcery, incantation, protection, or divination. Soothsayers (&quot;kāhin&quot;) are credited with the ability to ask jinn about things of the past, since their lives are believed to last longer than that of humans.

Common beliefs regarding sorcery and commanding jinn are attested in ibn al-Nadim&#x27;s &quot;Kitāb al-Fihrist&quot;. Since he locates such practises not as a branch of science or philosophy, but rather in a chapter about stories and fables, the author might not have believed in the efficiency of sorcery himself. He reports that the art of commanding jinn and demons is traced back to Solomon and Jamshid. The first who would have practised a lawful method of incantation is supposed to be Abū Naṣr Aḥmad b. Hilāl during the Umayyad period. Ibn Nadim explains lawful and unlawful subjugating of jinn and demons as distinct: While the former controls the jinn by the power of God&#x27;s divine names, the latter pleases demons and devils by prohibited offerings and sinful acts. According to al-Jāḥiẓ, ibn Hilāl is said to have the power to summon demons and jinn and further claimed to have married a daughter of Satan and begotten a child.

There is evidence that subjugation of spirits, jinn, and demons, was also cultivated by various Islamic authorities. Al-Ṭabasī, who was considered a reliable &quot;muḥadīth&quot; (scholar of &quot;ḥadīth&quot;) and pious ascetic, wrote an extensive treatise (&quot;al-Shāmil fī al-baḥr al-kāmil&quot;) on subjugating demons and jinn. According to Zakariya al-Qazwini, it was well known that jinn obeyed al-Ṭabasī. He gives an example, that al-Ṭabasī demonstrated the jinn to the famous scholar Ghazālī, who saw them as shadows on the wall. He professes that jinn only obey when the individual turns away from the temptations of creation and devoting oneself towards God. The &quot;al-Shāmil&quot; gives detailed instructions for preparations of various incantations. Unlike, for example in the writings of al-Razi, the &quot;al-Shāmil&quot; has no direct link to Hellenistic or Hermetic magic or philosophy. Magic was also used in the Ottoman Empire as evident from the Talismanic shirts of Murad III.

Related to the occult traditions in Islamic culture is the belief in the &quot;Seven kings of the Week&quot;, also known as &quot;rūḥāiya ulia&quot; (higher spirits; angels) and &quot;rūḥāiya sufula&quot; (lower spirits; demons). These beings are, for example, invoked for the preparation of Magic squares. This belief is attested by the Book of Wonders. It contains artistic depictions of several supernatural beings (demons, jinn, the evil eye, fever (Huma, Arabic: حمى), devils, lilith, etc.). Some of these beings indicate that the work connects Hebrew, Christian, and Islamic magical traditions. The original work is attributed to al-Bakhi, who founded a system of astrological magic based on Neo-Platonic thought. Although many pages are damaged, it is possible to reconstruct their meanings from Ottoman copies. Each king is depicted with helpers and associated talismanic symbols.

==Comparative mythology==

In comparative mythology and historical context studies, Quranic studies scholars discuss the relationship between Islamic notions of jinn and earlier Jewish and Christian ideas of supernatural beings or preternatural creatures, especially those of angels, spirits, and demons. It is widely agreed that the belief in jinn was a common element of the culture out of which the Quran came. One question has concerned the degree to Quranic jinn might be compared to fallen angels in Christian traditions, although issues with this view are that jinn are not identified as &quot;angels&quot; and that descriptions of angels do not involve their flying up the sky to eavesdrop on heavenly secrets (unlike jinn who do so in Surah 72). Patricia Crone notes that, like jinn, the demons of the Testament of Solomon ascend to the firmament and eavesdrop on heavenly secrets; as did demons of Zoroastrian cosmology, who in addition encounter a heavenly defense systems (as did Islamic jinn). Similar statements are also found in the Talmud (Berakhot 18b) and the 8th-century &quot;Scolion&quot; of Theodore bar Konai.

Counterparts to Quranic jinn have been identified in the Book of Jubilees, where spirits created by God, associated with fire, having an identified leader (Mastema), may either aid or harm humans, and suffer a similar fate as the jinn. 
The &quot;Shedim&quot; of the Tanakh are said to resemble jinn. Like jinn, among a class of beings of Jewish mythology/belief (&quot;jnun&quot;, &quot;shedim&quot;, etc.), there is a tradition of ritual exorcism and negotiations that differs from that of traditional Jewish cure of spirit possession associated with ghosts (Dybbuk).

Jinn have also been compared to preternatural beings called &quot;gny&quot;&#x27; in inscriptions from Palmyra as well as broader late antique demonologies.

<text>Gallurese () is a Romance dialect of the Italo-Dalmatian family spoken in the region of Gallura, northeastern Sardinia. Gallurese is variously described as a distinct southern dialect of Corsican or transitional language of the dialect continuum between Corsican and Sardinian. &quot;Gallurese International Day&quot; () takes place each year in Palau (Sardinia) with the participation of orators from other areas, including Corsica.

Gallurese is generally considered a southern Corsican dialect, sharing close resemblance in morphology and vocabulary with the dialects of Sartene and Porto-Vecchio on Corsica, whereas its phonology and syntax are similar to those of Sardinian. One third of Gallurese vocabulary is also influenced by Logudorese Sardinian, Catalan, and Spanish.

The Sassarese language, spoken in the area of Sassari, shares similar transitional traits between Tuscan, Corsican and Sardinian but, in comparison with Gallurese, is definitely closer to the Logudorese dialects of Sardinian.

== History ==
The most ancient literary sources in Gallurese date back to the early 17th century, mainly as poetry and religious odes. Some late Middle Age fragments suggest that the formation of the language could be dated to the early 15th century. The origin and the development of Gallurese are debated. Max Leopold Wagner and Maurice Le Lannou argued that successive migration waves from Southern Corsica, promoted under the Aragonese rule to repopulate an area devastated by famine and pandemics, were crucial in the formation of a transitional language.

== Typical constitutional elements of Gallurese ==

*the plural form of nouns in &quot;-i&quot; (&quot;ghjanni&quot; or &quot;polti&quot; &#x27;doors&#x27;) are like in Corsican and Italian, and not as in &quot;-s&quot; like in Sardinian (&quot;jannas&quot;, &quot;portas&quot;), French, Spanish, Catalan, etc.
* Latin &#x27;ll&#x27; has become &quot;-dd-&quot; (like &quot;casteddu, coraddu&quot; &#x27;castle&#x27;, &#x27;coral&#x27;), the same as in Sardinian, southern Corsican and Sicilian (but &quot;castellu, corallu&quot; in northern Corsican);
*&quot;-r-&quot; modified to &quot;-l-&quot; (&quot;poltu&quot; &#x27;port&#x27;, while &quot;portu&quot; in Corsican and Sardinian);
*&quot;-chj-&quot; and &quot;-ghj-&quot; sounds (&quot;ghjesgia&quot; &#x27;church&#x27;, &quot;occhji&quot; &#x27;eyes&#x27;), like in Corsican, while Sardinian is &quot;cresia, ogros&quot;.
* articles &quot;lu&quot;, &quot;la&quot;, &quot;li&quot;, like in ancient Corsican dialects (&quot;u&quot;, &quot;a&quot;, &quot;i&quot; in modern Corsican, &quot;su&quot;, &quot;sa&quot;, &quot;sos&quot;, &quot;sas&quot; in Sardinian);

== Relation to Corsican ==
Gallurese is classified by some linguists as a dialect of Corsican, and by others as a dialect of Sardinian. In any case, a great deal of similarity exists between Southern Corsican dialects and Gallurese, while there is relatively more distance from the neighbouring Sardinian varieties.

Concluding the debate speech, the Sardinian linguist Mauro Maxia stated as follows:
The Regional Government of Sardinia has recognized Gallurese, along with Sassarese as separate languages, distinct from Sardinian.

<text>William Gary Busey (; born June 29, 1944) is an American actor. He portrayed Buddy Holly in &quot;The Buddy Holly Story&quot; (1978), for which he was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor and won the National Society of Film Critics Award for Best Actor. His other starring roles include &quot;A Star Is Born&quot; (1976), &quot;D.C. Cab&quot; (1983), &quot;Silver Bullet&quot; (1985), &quot;Eye of the Tiger&quot; (1986), &quot;Lethal Weapon&quot; (1987), &quot;Hider in the House&quot; (1989), &quot;Predator 2&quot; (1990), &quot;Point Break&quot; (1991), &quot;Under Siege&quot; (1992), &quot;The Firm&quot; (1993), &quot;Drop Zone&quot; (1994), &quot;Black Sheep&quot; (1996) and &quot;Lost Highway&quot; (1997).

==Early life==
William Gary Busey was born in Goose Creek, Texas. While he was in fourth grade, Busey moved to Tulsa, Oklahoma, where he later attended Bell Junior High School, then attended and graduated from Nathan Hale High School. Busey attended Coffeyville Community College before attending Pittsburg State University in Pittsburg, Kansas, on a football scholarship, where he became interested in acting. After a knee injury, he then transferred to Oklahoma State University in Stillwater, Oklahoma, to study theater. He quit school just one unit short of graduation.

==Career==
===Early career===

Busey began his showbusiness career as a drummer in The Rubber Band. He appears on several Leon Russell recordings, credited as playing drums under the name &quot;Teddy Jack Eddy&quot; a character he created when he was a cast member of a local television comedy show in Tulsa, Oklahoma, called &quot;The Uncanny Film Festival and Camp Meeting&quot; on station KTUL (which starred fellow Tulsan Gailard Sartain as &quot;Dr. Mazeppa Pompazoidi&quot;). For his skits on Uncanny Film Festival, Busey drew on his American Hero, belligerent, know-it-all character. When he told Gailard Sartain his character needed a name, Sartain replied, &quot;Take three: Teddy, Jack and Eddy.&quot;

He played in a band called Carp, which released one album on Epic Records in 1969. Busey continued to play several small roles in both film and television during the 1970s. In 1975, as the character &quot;Harvey Daley&quot;, he was the last person killed on the series &quot;Gunsmoke&quot; (in the third-to-last episode, No. 633 – &quot;The Busters&quot;).
===Rise to prominence===

In 1974, Busey played Truckie Wheeler in the ABC television comedy &quot;The Texas Wheelers&quot;. During that same year he made his major film debut with a supporting role in Michael Cimino&#x27;s buddy action caper &quot;Thunderbolt and Lightfoot&quot;, starring Clint Eastwood and Jeff Bridges.

In 1976, he was hired by Barbra Streisand and her producer-boyfriend Jon Peters to play Bobby Ritchie, road manager to Kris Kristofferson&#x27;s character in the remake film &quot;A Star is Born&quot;. On the DVD commentary of the film, Streisand says Busey was great and that she had seen him on a TV series and thought he had the right qualities to play the role.

In 1978, he starred as rock legend Buddy Holly in &quot;The Buddy Holly Story&quot; with Sartain as The Big Bopper. For his performance, Busey received the greatest critical acclaim of his career and the movie earned an Academy Award nomination for Best Actor and the National Society of Film Critics&#x27; Best Actor award for him. In the same year he also starred in the small yet acclaimed drama &quot;Straight Time&quot; and the surfing movie &quot;Big Wednesday&quot;, which is now a minor cult classic.

===Mid-career===
In the 1980s, Busey&#x27;s films included the critically acclaimed western &quot;Barbarosa&quot; (1982), the comedies &quot;D.C. Cab&quot; (1983) and &quot;Insignificance&quot; (1985), the Stephen King adaptation &quot;Silver Bullet&quot; (1985), and the action film &quot;Eye of the Tiger&quot; (1986). He played one of the primary antagonists opposite Mel Gibson and Danny Glover in the action comedy &quot;Lethal Weapon&quot; (1987). He also starred in the psychological thriller &quot;Hider in the House&quot; (1989).

In the 1990s, he had prominent supporting roles in successful action films such as &quot;Predator 2&quot; (1990), &quot;Point Break&quot; (1991), &quot;Under Siege&quot; (1992), and &quot;Drop Zone&quot; (1994). He also appeared in &quot;The Player&quot; (1992), &quot;The Firm&quot; (1993), &quot;Rookie of the Year&quot; (1993), &quot;Black Sheep&quot; (1995), &quot;Lost Highway&quot; (1997), &quot;Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas&quot; (1998), and &quot;Soldier&quot; (1998).

Busey sang the song &quot;Stay All Night&quot; on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; in 1979 (season 4, episode 14), and on the &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot; in the 1990s.

In 2002, Busey voiced the character Phil Cassidy in the video game &quot;Grand Theft Auto: Vice City&quot; and later reprised the role in the prequel &quot;Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Stories&quot; in 2006. In 2003, he starred in a Comedy Central reality show, &quot;I&#x27;m with Busey&quot;. In 2005, he also voiced himself in an episode of &quot;The Simpsons&quot; and appeared in the popular miniseries &quot;Into the West&quot;. Busey controversially appeared in the 2006 Turkish nationalist film &quot;Valley of the Wolves: Iraq&quot; (), which was accused of fascism, anti-Americanism, and antisemitism.

Busey starred in the horror film &quot;The Gingerdead Man&quot; (2005) as the titular character and crazed killer Millard Findlemeyer. In 2007, he appeared as himself in a prominent recurring role on HBO&#x27;s &quot;Entourage&quot;, in which he parodied his eccentric image, ultimately appearing on three episodes of the show. In 2008, he joined the second season of the reality show &quot;Celebrity Rehab with Dr. Drew&quot;. In 2009, Busey appeared as a roaster at the Comedy Central Roast of Larry the Cable Guy.

===Later work===
In a series of 2010 YouTube advertisements for Vitamin Water, Busey appeared as Norman Tugwater, a lawyer who defends professional athletes&#x27; entitlements to a cut from Fantasy Football team owners. Busey returned to reality television on &quot;Celebrity Apprentice 4&quot; in 2011, and appeared again in &quot;Celebrity Apprentice 6&quot;. There, he briefly reprised his role as Buddy Holly by performing &quot;Not Fade Away&quot;.

In 2014, he became a celebrity spokesperson for Amazon Fire TV. Also that year, he appeared in, and became the first American winner of &quot;Celebrity Big Brother 14&quot;. In 2015, he competed on the 21st season of &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot;. He was paired with professional dancer Anna Trebunskaya. Busey and Trebunskaya made it to Week 4 of competition but were then eliminated and finished in 10th place.

In 2019, Busey starred as God in the Off-Broadway musical &quot;Only Human&quot; at the Theatre at St. Clements in New York. The plot of &quot;Only Human&quot; is described as follows: &quot;Before they were enemies, they were co-workers. Jesus and Lucifer never saw eye-to-eye, but when an extreme case of creative differences gets the best of them, all hell breaks loose. Literally.&quot; In a statement on playing God in the upcoming production, he said, &quot;God is everything love is and that love becomes the beginning of blessings and miracles. Playing this role of God is easy because I&#x27;m not acting, I&#x27;m just believing.&quot;

In the web series &quot;Gary Busey Pet Judge&quot; (2020) he presided as a pet court show judge to help resolve problems.

==Personal life==

Busey has three children: Jake, Alectra, and Luke.

On December 4, 1988, Busey was severely injured in a motorcycle accident in which he was not wearing a helmet. His skull was fractured, and he suffered permanent brain damage.

In 1996, Busey publicly announced that he was a Christian, saying &quot;I am proud to tell Hollywood I am a Christian. For the first time I am now free to be myself.&quot; He cites the motorcycle accident and a 1995 cocaine overdose as events that strengthened his Christian faith.

In 1997, Busey underwent successful surgery to remove a plum-sized cancerous tumor from his sinus cavity. The growth was found after he began suffering nose bleeds.

During the filming of the second season of &quot;Celebrity Rehab&quot; in 2008, Busey was referred to psychiatrist Charles Sophy. Sophy suspected that Busey&#x27;s brain injury had had a greater effect on him than was realized. He described it as essentially weakening Busey&#x27;s mental &quot;filters&quot;, which led him to speak and act impulsively. Sophy recommended Busey take valproic acid (Depakote), and Busey agreed.

In 2011, Busey endorsed Newt Gingrich during Gingrich&#x27;s 2012 presidential campaign, but later withdrew his endorsement. In 2015, he endorsed Donald Trump for the 2016 United States Presidential election. After the election, Busey said he was &quot;very happy&quot; that Trump had won, but declined to further discuss it, not wanting to talk about politics.

<text>The &quot;-gry&quot; puzzle is a popular word puzzle that asks for the third English word that ends with the letters &quot;-gry&quot; other than &quot;angry&quot; and &quot;hungry&quot;. Specific wording varies substantially, but the puzzle has no clear answer, as there are no other common English words that end in &quot;-gry&quot;. Interpretations of the puzzle suggest it is either an answerless hoax; a trick question; a sincere question asking for an obscure word; or a corruption of a more straightforward puzzle, which may have asked for words containing &quot;gry&quot; (such as &quot;gryphon&quot;). Of these, countless trick question variants and obscure English words (or nonce words) have been proposed. The lack of a conclusive answer has ensured the enduring popularity of the puzzle, and it has become one of the most frequently asked word puzzles.

The ultimate origin and original form of the puzzle is unknown, but it was popularized in 1975, starting in the New York area, and has remained popular into the 21st century. Various similar puzzles exist, though these have straightforward answers. The most notable is &quot;words ending in &quot;-dous&quot;&quot;, which has been popular since the 1880s.

==Answers==
Various proposed answers exist, stating that the question is one of the following:
* A hoax – there is no answer, and its purpose (or effect) is to frustrate.
* A trick question, with various answers depending on precise wording.
* A sincere question asking for an obscure word, most often proposed as or . This does not apply to wordings that explicitly ask for a very common word.
* A corruption of a more straightforward word puzzle, namely a word containing the sequence &quot;gry&quot;, though not necessarily at the (tail) end, in which case the answer is which is uncommon but in use.

This topic is a source of lively interest, both to lovers of word puzzles and lovers of words. For both groups, much of the appeal lies in the quest, either to trace the origin of the puzzle or compile a complete list of words ending in &quot;-gry&quot;.

More recently, the word &quot;hangry&quot;—a portmanteau of &#x27;hungry&#x27; and &#x27;angry&#x27;—has been used to refer to an irritable state induced by lack of food. Oxford Dictionaries (controlled by, but less restrictive than, the Oxford English Dictionary) added &quot;hangry&quot; on 27 August 2015, and the full Oxford English Dictionary added &quot;hangry&quot; in 2018.

==History==
There are anecdotal reports of various forms of the puzzle dating to the 1950s or earlier; the ultimate origin is presumably an oral tradition or a lost book of puzzles. However, the first documented evidence is from early 1975 in the New York metropolitan area, and the puzzle rapidly gained popularity in this year. The most likely source is the talk show of Bob Grant, from some program in early or mid March 1975.

Merriam-Webster, publishers of the leading American dictionaries, first heard of this puzzle in a letter dated March 17, 1975, from Patricia Lasker of Brooklyn, New York. Lasker says her plant manager heard the question on an unnamed quiz show. Since that time Merriam-Webster has received about four letters each year asking the question.

The puzzle first appears in print in Anita Richterman&#x27;s &quot;Problem Line&quot; column in &quot;Newsday&quot; on April 29, 1975. One &quot;M.Z.&quot; from Wantagh, New York states that the problem was asked on a TV quiz program. Richterman states that she asked a learned professor of English for help when she first received the inquiry, and he did not respond for over a month. This agrees with the Merriam-Webster report, suggesting a quiz show in early or mid March 1975.

In Anita Richterman&#x27;s column on May 9, 1975, several correspondents reported that they had heard the puzzle on the Bob Grant radio talk show on WMCA in New York City. This suggests either that the earlier claims of a (TV) quiz show confused a talk show with a quiz show, or that there was another unspecified quiz show that was then repeated by Grant. The majority of readers gave the answer &quot;&quot;, an obsolete unit of measure invented by John Locke. It is unclear whether this was the answer given on the Grant show, or what the precise wording had been.

By fall 1975 the puzzle had reached the Delaware Valley, again apparently by radio, by which time the puzzle seems to have mutated to a form in which the missing word is an adjective that describes the state of the world.

The puzzle has had occasional bouts of popularity: after its initial popularity in 1975, it was popular in 1978, then again in 1995–1996.

===Reports of earlier versions===
The most credible report of an early version was given on Stumpers-L, which reported a trick question formulation from an eight-page pamphlet entitled &quot;Things to Think About&quot;, probably dating to the 1940s:

== Alternative versions ==

===Trick versions===

#This version only works when spoken: There are three words in English that end in a &quot;gree&quot;. The first two are &quot;angry&quot; and &quot;hungry&quot;, and if you&#x27;ve listened closely, you&#x27;ll agree that I&#x27;ve already told you the third one.
#*The answer is &quot;agree&quot;.
#There are three words in the English language that end with the letters &#x27;g&#x27;, &#x27;r&#x27;, and &#x27;y&#x27;. Two are &quot;hungry&quot; and &quot;angry&quot;. The third word is something everyone uses every day. Everyone knows what the third word means. What is the third word?
#*The answer is &quot;energy&quot;. The riddle says that the word ends in the letters g-r-y; it says nothing about the order of the letters. Many words end with &quot;-rgy&quot;, but energy is something everyone uses every day.
#There are at least three words in the English language that end in &quot;g&quot; or &quot;y&quot;. One of them is &quot;hungry&quot;, and another one is &quot;angry&quot;. There is a third word, a short one, which you probably say every day. If you are listening carefully to everything I say, you just heard me say it three times. What is it?
#*The answer is &quot;say&quot;. This version depends upon the listener confusing the spoken word &quot;or&quot; and the spoken letter &quot;r&quot;.
#There are three words in the English language that end in &quot;gry&quot;. Two words that end in &quot;gry&quot; are &quot;hungry&quot; and &quot;angry&quot;. Everyone knows what the third word means, and everyone uses them every day. If you listened very carefully, I have already stated to you what the third word is. The three words that solve this riddle are...?
#*The answer is the three-word sentence &quot;I am hungry&quot;. This version asks for three words that end in &quot;gry&quot;, not three words each of which ends in &quot;gry&quot;.
#I know two words that end in &quot;gry&quot;. Neither one is angry or hungry. What are they?
#*The answer is &quot;angry&quot; and &quot;hungry&quot;. Since these are words, they are not capable of being angry or hungry.
#Give me three English words, commonly spoken, ending in g-r-y.
#*There are many possible answers, such as &quot;Beg for mercy&quot;, or &quot;Bring your money&quot;.
#There are three words in the English language that end g-r-y. One is angry and another is hungry. The third word is something that &quot;everyone&quot; uses. If you have listened carefully, I have already told you what it is.
#*The answer is &quot;every&quot;. First word is &quot;fuming&quot; which ends with &quot;g&quot;. The word &quot;fuming&quot; is angry (when personified). Second word is &quot;eager&quot; which ends with &quot;r&quot;. The word &quot;eager&quot; is hungry (when personified). Third word is &quot;every&quot; which ends with &quot;y&quot;. The word &quot;everyone&quot; uses the word &quot;every&quot;.

===Meta-puzzle versions===
The remaining versions are a form of meta-puzzle, in the sense that they make no use of the actual letters &quot;gry&quot; themselves, which therefore are a red herring. The red herring only works because there is another puzzle that does use these letters (even though that puzzle has no good answer).

#Think of words ending in &quot;gry&quot;. &quot;Angry&quot; and &quot;hungry&quot; are two of them. There are only three words in &quot;the English language&quot;. What is the third word? Hint: The word is something that everyone uses every day. If you have listened carefully, I have already told you what it is.
#*The answer is &quot;language&quot;, and the logic is as follows: There are only three words in &quot;the English language&quot;; the third word is &quot;language&quot;. Since this version requires quotation marks around the phrase, &quot;the English language&quot;, the written version gives away the trick.
#Angry and hungry are two words in the English language that end in &quot;gry&quot;. &quot;What&quot; is the third word. The word is something that everyone uses every day. If you have listened carefully, I have already told you what it is.
#*The answer is &quot;what&quot;. But again, the quotation marks spoil the puzzle when it is printed.
#There are three words in the English language that end with &quot;gry&quot;. Two of these are &quot;angry&quot; and &quot;hungry&quot;. The third word is a very common word, and you use it often. If you have read what I have told you, you will see that I have given you the third word. What is the third word? Think very carefully.
#*The answer is &quot;three&quot;, the third word in the paragraph. The rest of the paragraph is a red herring.
#There are three words in the English language that end in &quot;gry&quot;. The first &quot;one&quot; is &quot;hungry&quot;, the second &quot;one&quot; is &quot;angry&quot;, what is the third &quot;one&quot;? If you have read this carefully I have given a clue.
#*The answer is the word &quot;one&quot;, which is the third &quot;one&quot;. Again the quotation marks ruin the written puzzle, so this version is usually written without the quotation marks and with the word &quot;one&quot; capitalized.

==Similar puzzles==

There are numerous similar puzzles, giving letter sequences that rarely occur in words. The most-notable of these is the &quot;-dous&quot; puzzle of finding words ending in &quot;-dous&quot;, which was popular in the 1880s. This took various forms, sometimes simply listing all words or all common words, sometimes being posed as a riddle, giving the three common words, &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;, and &quot;&quot;, and requesting the rarer fourth, which is &quot;&quot;. This form originated in 1883, with an A.A. of Glasgow writing to George Augustus Henry Sala in his &quot;Echoes of the Week&quot; column in the &quot;Illustrated London News&quot;.
This question has had enduring popularity, even inspiring a contest, though the words have proven less stable: today &quot;jeopardous&quot; is considered too rare, and the formerly unpopular &quot;&quot; has taken its place; this change occurred as early as 1909. At times other words such as &quot;&quot; have been accepted. Today &quot;&quot; is typically the omitted word, and differs from the others in being a visible compound &quot;&quot; + &quot;&quot;. This puzzle has continued in popularity through the end of the 20th century, with recent versions giving it as an alternative to the gry puzzle.
There is a Russian puzzle which goes: &quot;There are three words in the Russian language which end in -zo. Two of them are &quot;zhelezo&quot; &quot;iron&quot; and &quot;puzo&quot; &quot;belly&quot;. What is the third word?&quot; There is quite a handful of other nouns that end in -zo, in the Russian language, but most of them are fairly obscure terms like авизо, abbreviations or proper names like Кензо. 
Another similar one is words ending in &quot;-cion&quot;, of which the common words are &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;, and &quot;&quot;.

The most similar to the gry puzzle in form is to find three words that contain the letter sequence &quot;shion&quot;, to which the answer is &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;, and &quot;&quot;; this is typically stated by giving &quot;cushion&quot; and &quot;fashion&quot;, and requesting the third word, namely &quot;parishioner&quot;. This can be modified to finding words &quot;ending&quot; with &quot;-shion&quot;, in which case the answer is the obsolete word &quot;&quot;, which is a synonymous variant of &quot;parishioner&quot;. This has not been nearly as popular as the gry puzzle.

==Solution techniques==
The standard way to solve such puzzles is to use a reverse dictionary, or to perform an exhaustive search through a dictionary, either manually, which is tedious and error-prone, or using computer tools such as grep, which requires an electronic word list. At the origin of the gry puzzle, the standard reverse dictionary in modern English was the &quot;Air Force Reverse Dictionary&quot; (formally the &quot;Normal and Reverse Word List&quot;, compiled under the direction of A. F. Brown), which did not have additional answers for gry. The most plausible answer at the time was &quot;&quot;, found in the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot;. A more elaborate strategy is to list words that have endings similar to gry, such as &quot;-gary&quot;, and then search a larger dictionary for obsolete variants ending in &quot;-gry&quot;, for example &quot;begry&quot; for &quot;beggary&quot;.

From around 1980 electronic word lists became widely available on Unix systems, and searching for answers to the gry puzzle was an occasional benchmark; this also turned up &quot;gryphon&quot; in some cases, if match is not required to be at the end. This is now easily done in milliseconds on modern personal computers:

grep gry$ /usr/share/dict/words # Search for words ending in gry
grep gry /usr/share/dict/words # Search for words containing gry

<text>Giosuè Alessandro Giuseppe Carducci (27 July 1835 – 16 February 1907) was an Italian poet, writer, literary critic and teacher. He was noticeably influential, and was regarded as the official national poet of modern Italy. In 1906, he became the first Italian to receive the Nobel Prize in Literature. The Swedish Academy awarded him the prize &quot;not only in consideration of his deep learning and critical research, but above all as a tribute to the creative energy, freshness of style, and lyrical force which characterize his poetic masterpieces.&quot;

==Biography==

He was born in Valdicastello in Pietrasanta, a small town currently part of the Province of Lucca in the northwest corner of Tuscany, which at the time was an independent grand duchy. His father, a doctor, was an advocate of the unification of Italy and was involved with the Carbonari. Because of his politics, the family was forced to move several times during Carducci&#x27;s childhood, eventually settling for a few years in Florence.

From the time he was in school, he was fascinated with the restrained style of Greek and Roman Antiquity, and his mature work reflects a restrained classical style, often using the classical meters of such Latin poets as Horace and Virgil. He translated Book 9 of Homer&#x27;s &quot;Iliad&quot; into Italian.

Carducci was awarded a scholarship to study at the prestigious Scuola Normale Superiore di Pisa. After graduating in 1856, he began teaching school. The following year, he published his first collection of poems, &quot;Rime&quot;. These were difficult years for Carducci: his father died, and his brother committed suicide.

In 1859, he married Elvira Menicucci, and they had four children. He briefly taught Greek at a high school in Pistoia and then was appointed Professor of Italian Literature at the University of Bologna. Here, one of his students was Giovanni Pascoli, who became an eminent poet himself and later succeeded him at the university.

Carducci was a popular lecturer and a fierce critic of literature and society. In his youth he was an atheist, whose political views were vehemently hostile to the Catholic Church. In the course of his life, his views on religion shifted towards a socially oriented theism which he exposed in his famous &quot;Discorso sulla libertà perpetua di San Marino&quot; (&quot;A Speech on San Marino&#x27;s Perpetual Freedom&quot;), pronounced on 30 September 1894 before the authorities and people of that ancient Republic and celebrating &quot;the Universal God of Peoples, Mazzini&#x27;s and Washington&#x27;s God&quot;.

His anti-clerical revolutionary vehemence was prominently showcased in one famous poem, the deliberately blasphemous and provocative (&quot;Hymn to Satan&quot;). &quot;Satan&quot; / &quot;Lucifer&quot; was considered by Italian leftists of the time as a metaphor for the rebellious and freethinking spirit. The poem was composed in 1863 as a dinner party toast, published in 1865, and then republished in 1869 by Bologna&#x27;s radical newspaper, &quot;Il Popolo&quot;, as a provocation timed to coincide with the First Vatican Council, a time when revolutionary fervour directed against the papacy was running high as republicans pressed both politically and militarily for an end to the Vatican&#x27;s domination over the papal states.

While &quot;Inno a Satana&quot; had quite a revolutionary impact, Carducci&#x27;s finest poetry came in later years. His collections &quot;Rime Nuove&quot; (&quot;New Rhymes&quot;) and &quot;Odi Barbare&quot; (&quot;Barbarian Odes&quot;) contain his greatest works.

He was the first Italian to receive the Nobel Prize in Literature, in 1906. He was also appointed senator by the King of Italy (1890). In politics he remained a strong Liberal throughout his life; through the years he progressively evolved from republicanism to a sort of support to monarchy. He was a Freemason of the Grand Orient of Italy. His father Michele, a physician, was also a member of the Italian Carboneria. Although his reputation rests primarily on his poetry, he also produced a large body of prose works. Indeed, his prose writings, including literary criticism, biographies, speeches and essays, fill some 20 volumes. Carducci was also an excellent translator and translated some of Goethe and Heine into Italian.

The Museum of the Risorgimento, Bologna is housed in the Casa Carducci, the house where he died at the age of 71, and contains an exhibit on the author.

==Legacy==
Carducci confessed his sins and was reconciled to the Catholic Church in 1895. On 11 September 1978, Pope John Paul I mentioned him as a &quot;model&quot; for university professors and teachers of Latin.

==Works==
It is not always easy to follow the development of Carducci&#x27;s poetry through the collections he edited. The poet in fact organized his compositions several times and in different ways and gave a definitive arrangement only later in the edition of his &quot;Opere&quot; published for Zanichelli between 1889 and 1909. The following is a list of poetic works published in one volume, then rearranged into the 20 volumes of his &quot;Opere&quot;.

* &quot;Rime&quot;, San Miniato, 1857.
* &quot;&quot;, 1868.
* &quot;Poesie&quot;, Firenze, Barbera, 1871.
* &quot;Primavere elleniche&quot;, 1872.
* &quot;Nuove poesie&quot;, 1873.
* &quot;Odi barbare&quot;, 1877.
* &quot;Juvenilia&quot;, 1880.
* &quot;Levia Gravia&quot;, 1881.
* &quot;&quot;, 1882.
* &quot;Nuove odi barbare&quot;, 1882.
* &quot;&quot;, 1887.
* &quot;Terze odi barbare&quot;, 1889.
* &quot;Delle Odi barbare. Libri II ordinati e corretti&quot;, 1893.
* &quot;&quot;, 1899.
* &quot;Poesie. MDCCCL-MCM&quot;, 1901.

Below are the poetic volumes in the &quot;Opere&quot;. The volumes, however, do not correspond to the chronological order with which the poet had published his first collections, but refer more than anything else to the distinctions of genres and therefore we find poems of the same period in different collections. The collections follow this order:

* &quot;Juvenilia&quot;, in six books, 1850–1860
* &quot;Levia Gravia&quot;, in two books, 1861–1871
* &quot;Inno a Satana&quot;, 1863
* &quot;Giambi ed Epodi&quot;, in two books, 1867–1879
* &quot;Intermezzo&quot;, 1874–1887
* &quot;Rime Nuove&quot;, in nine books, 1861–1887
* &quot;Odi barbare&quot;, in two books, 1873–1889
* &quot;Rime e Ritmi&quot;, 1889–1898
* &quot;Della Canzone di Legnano&quot;, Part I, 1879

=== &quot;Juvenilia&quot; ===
The first collection of lyrical poems, which Carducci collected and divided into six books under the title &quot;Juvenilia&quot; (1850–1860), is undoubtedly inspired by the classical tradition of the &quot;Amici pedanti&quot; group that was constituted at that time for the purpose of fighting the romanticism of the Florentines. In the verses of the collection we can immediately see his imitation of the ancient classics, of the stilnovo style, of Dante and Petrarch and, among the moderns, Vittorio Alfieri, Monti, Foscolo and Leopardi.

But the Carduccian spirit is already visible; his love for the beauty of style, the purity of sentiments and the celebration of liberty, as well as the ability to appreciate all that is genuine, therefore also the language of the common people.

<doc id="13034" wikidata="Q83471" url="?curid=13034" title="Geyser">
<text>A geyser (, ) is a spring with an intermittent water discharge ejected turbulently and accompanied by steam. The formation of geysers is fairly rare and is caused by particular hydrogeological conditions that exist only in a few places on Earth.

Generally, geyser field sites are located near active volcanic areas, and the geyser effect is due to the proximity of magma. Surface water works its way down to an average depth of around where it contacts hot rocks. The pressurized water boils, and this causes the geyser effect of hot water and steam spraying out of the geyser&#x27;s surface vent.

A geyser&#x27;s eruptive activity may change or cease due to ongoing deposition of minerals within their plumbing, exchange of functions with nearby hot springs, earthquake influences, and human intervention. Like many other natural phenomena, geysers are not unique to Earth. Jet-like eruptions, often called cryogeysers, have been observed on several of the moons of the outer Solar System. Due to the low ambient pressures, these eruptions consist of vapour without liquid; they are made more easily visible by particles of dust and ice carried aloft by the gas. Water vapour jets have been observed near the south pole of Saturn&#x27;s moon Enceladus, while nitrogen eruptions have been observed on Neptune&#x27;s moon Triton. There are also signs of carbon dioxide eruptions from the southern polar ice cap of Mars.

In the case of Enceladus, the plumes are believed to be driven by internal energy. In the cases of the venting on Mars and Triton, the activity may result from solar heating via a solid-state greenhouse effect. In all three cases, there is no evidence of the subsurface hydrological system which differentiates terrestrial geysers from other sorts of venting, such as fumaroles.

== Etymology ==
The term &#x27;geyser&#x27; in English dates back to the late 18th century and comes from Geysir, which is a geyser in Iceland. Its name means &quot;one who gushes&quot;.

== Geology ==
=== Form and function ===
Geysers are nonpermanent geological features. Geysers are generally associated with areas of recent magmatism. As the water boils, the resulting pressure forces a superheated column of steam and water to the surface through the geyser&#x27;s internal plumbing. The formation of geysers specifically requires the combination of three geologic conditions that are usually found in volcanic terrain: heat, water, and a subsurface hydraulic system with the right geometry.

The heat needed for geyser formation comes from magma that needs to be close to the surface of the Earth. For the heated water to form a geyser, a plumbing system (made of fractures, fissures, porous spaces, and sometimes cavities) is required. This includes a reservoir to hold the water while it is being heated.

Geysers tend to be coated with geyserite, or siliceous sinter. The water in geysers comes in contact with hot silica-containing rocks, such as rhyolite. The heated water dissolves the silica. As it gets closer to the surface, the water cools and the silica drops out of solution, leaving a deposit of amorphous opal. Gradually the opal anneals into quartz, forming geyserite. Geyserite often covers the microbial mats that grow in geysers. As the mats grow and the silica is deposited, the mats can form up to 50% of the volume of the geyserite.

=== Eruptions ===
Geyser activity, like all hot spring activity, is caused by surface water gradually seeping down through the ground until it meets geothermally heated rock. In non-eruptive hot springs, the heated water then rises back toward the surface by convection through porous and fractured rocks, while in geysers, the water instead is explosively forced upwards by the high steam pressure created when water boils below. Geysers also differ from non-eruptive hot springs in their subterranean structure: geysers have constrictions in their plumbing that creates pressure build-up.

As the geyser fills, the water at the top of the column cools off, but because of the narrowness of the channel, convective cooling of the water in the reservoir is impossible. The cooler water above presses down on the hotter water beneath, not unlike the lid of a pressure cooker, allowing the water in the reservoir to become superheated, i.e. to remain liquid at temperatures well above the standard-pressure boiling point.

Ultimately, the temperatures near the bottom of the geyser rise to a point where boiling begins, forcing steam bubbles to rise to the top of the column. As they burst through the geyser&#x27;s vent, some water overflows or splashes out, reducing the weight of the column and thus the pressure on the water below. With this release of pressure, the superheated water flashes into steam, boiling violently throughout the column. The resulting froth of expanding steam and hot water then sprays out of the geyser vent.

Eventually the water remaining in the geyser cools back to below the boiling point and the eruption ends; heated groundwater begins seeping back into the reservoir, and the whole cycle begins again. The duration of eruptions and the time between successive eruptions vary greatly from geyser to geyser; Strokkur in Iceland erupts for a few seconds every few minutes, while Grand Geyser in the United States erupts for up to 10 minutes every 8–12 hours.

=== General categorization ===

There are two types of geysers: &quot;fountain geysers&quot; which erupt from pools of water, typically in a series of intense, even violent, bursts; and &quot;cone geysers&quot; which erupt from cones or mounds of siliceous sinter (including geyserite), usually in steady jets that last anywhere from a few seconds to several minutes. Old Faithful, perhaps the best-known geyser at Yellowstone National Park, is an example of a cone geyser. Grand Geyser, the tallest predictable geyser on Earth (although Geysir in Iceland is taller, it is not predictable), also at Yellowstone National Park, is an example of a fountain geyser.

There are many volcanic areas in the world that have hot springs, mud pots and fumaroles, but very few have erupting geysers. The main reason for their rarity is that multiple intense transient forces must occur simultaneously for a geyser to exist. For example, even when other necessary conditions exist, if the rock structure is loose, eruptions will erode the channels and rapidly destroy any nascent geysers.

Geysers are fragile, and if conditions change, they may go dormant or extinct. Many have been destroyed simply by people throwing debris into them, while others have ceased to erupt due to dewatering by geothermal power plants. However, the Geysir in Iceland has had periods of activity and dormancy. During its long dormant periods, eruptions were sometimes artificially induced—often on special occasions—by the addition of surfactant soaps to the water.
== Biology ==

Some geysers have specific colours, because despite the harsh conditions, life is often found in them (and also in other hot habitats) in the form of thermophilic prokaryotes. No known eukaryote can survive over .

In the 1960s, when the research of the biology of geysers first appeared, scientists were generally convinced that no life can survive above around —the upper limit for the survival of cyanobacteria, as the structure of key cellular proteins and deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) would be destroyed. The optimal temperature for thermophilic bacteria was placed even lower, around .

However, the observations proved that can exist at high temperatures and that some bacteria even prefer temperatures higher than the boiling point of water. Dozens of such bacteria are known.
Thermophiles prefer temperatures from , while hyperthermophiles grow better at temperatures as high as . As they have heat-stable enzymes that retain their activity even at high temperatures, they have been used as a source of thermostable tools, which are important in medicine and biotechnology, for example in manufacturing antibiotics, plastics, detergents (by the use of heat-stable enzymes lipases, pullulanases and proteases), and fermentation products (for example ethanol is produced). Among these, the first discovered and the most important for biotechnology is &quot;Thermus aquaticus&quot;.

== Major geyser fields and their distribution ==
Geysers are quite rare, requiring a combination of water, heat, and fortuitous plumbing. The combination exists in few places on Earth.

=== Yellowstone National Park ===
Yellowstone is the largest geyser locale, containing thousands of hot springs, and approximately 300 to 500 geysers. It is home to half of the world&#x27;s total number of geysers in its nine geyser basins. It is located mostly in Wyoming, USA, with small portions in Montana and Idaho. Yellowstone includes the world&#x27;s tallest active geyser (Steamboat Geyser in Norris Geyser Basin).

=== Valley of Geysers, Russia ===

The Valley of Geysers (), located in the Kamchatka Peninsula of Russia, is the second-largest concentration of geysers in the world. The area was discovered and explored by Tatyana Ustinova in 1941. There are about 200 geysers in the area, along with many hot-water springs and perpetual spouters. The area was formed by vigorous volcanic activity. The peculiar way of eruptions is an important feature of these geysers. Most of the geysers erupt at angles, and only very few have the geyser cones that exist at many other of the world&#x27;s geyser fields. On 3 June 2007, a massive mudflow influenced two-thirds of the valley. It was then reported that a thermal lake was forming above the valley. Four of the eight thermal areas in the valley were covered by the landslide or by the lake. Velikan Geyser, one of the field&#x27;s largest, was not buried in the slide: the slide shortened its period of eruption from 379 minutes before the slide to 339 minutes after (through 2010).

=== El Tatio, Chile ===

The name &quot;El Tatio&quot; comes from the Quechua word for &quot;oven&quot;. El Tatio is located in the high valleys of the Andes in Chile, surrounded by many active volcanoes, at around above mean sea level. The valley is home to approximately 80 geysers at present. It became the largest geyser field in the Southern Hemisphere after the destruction of many of the New Zealand geysers, and is the third largest geyser field in the world. The salient feature of these geysers is that the height of their eruptions is very low, the tallest being only high, but with steam columns that can be over high. The average geyser eruption height at El Tatio is about .

=== Taupō Volcanic Zone, New Zealand ===
The Taupō Volcanic Zone is located on New Zealand&#x27;s North Island. It is long by and lies over a subduction zone in the Earth&#x27;s crust. Mount Ruapehu marks its southwestern end, while the submarine Whakatāne seamount ( beyond Whakaari / White Island) is considered its northeastern limit. Many geysers in this zone were destroyed due to geothermal developments and a hydroelectric reservoir: only one geyser basin at Whakarewarewa remains.

In the beginning of the 20th century, the largest geyser ever known, the Waimangu Geyser, existed in this zone. It began erupting in 1900 and erupted periodically for four years until a landslide changed the local water table. Eruptions of Waimangu would typically reach and some superbursts are known to have reached . Recent scientific work indicates that the Earth&#x27;s crust below the zone may be as little as thick. Beneath this lies a film of magma wide and long.

=== Iceland ===
Due to the high rate of volcanic activity in Iceland, it is home to some of the most famous geysers in the world. There are around 20–29 active geysers in the country, as well as numerous formerly active geysers. Icelandic geysers are distributed in the zone stretching from south-west to north-east, along the boundary between the Eurasian Plate and the North American Plate. Most of the Icelandic geysers are comparatively short-lived. It is also characteristic that many geysers here are reactivated or newly created after earthquakes, becoming dormant or extinct after some years or some decades.

Two most prominent geysers of Iceland are located in Haukadalur. &quot;The Great Geysir&quot;, which first erupted in the 14th century, gave rise to the word &quot;&quot;. By 1896, Geysir was almost dormant before an earthquake that year caused eruptions to begin again, occurring several times a day; but in 1916, eruptions all but ceased. Throughout much of the 20th century, eruptions did happen from time to time, usually following earthquakes. Some man-made improvements were made to the spring and eruptions were forced with soap on special occasions. Earthquakes in June 2000 subsequently reawakened the giant for a time, but it is not currently erupting regularly. The nearby Strokkur geyser erupts every 5–8 minutes to a height of some .

=== Extinct and dormant geyser fields ===

There used to be two large geyser fields in Nevada—Beowawe and Steamboat Springs—but they were destroyed by the installation of nearby geothermal power plants. At the plants, geothermal drilling reduced the available heat and lowered the local water table to the point that geyser activity could no longer be sustained.

Many of New Zealand&#x27;s geysers have been destroyed by humans in the last century. Several New Zealand geysers have also become dormant or extinct by natural means. The main remaining field is Whakarewarewa at Rotorua. Two-thirds of the geysers at Orakei Korako were flooded by the construction of the hydroelectric Ohakuri dam in 1961. The Wairakei field was lost to a geothermal power plant in 1958. The Rotomahana field was destroyed by the 1886 eruption of Mount Tarawera.

== Misnamed geysers ==

There are various other types of geysers which are different in nature compared to the normal steam-driven geysers. These geysers differ not only in their style of eruption but also in the cause that makes them erupt.

=== Artificial geysers ===
In a number of places where there is geothermal activity, wells have been drilled and fitted with impermeable casements that allow them to erupt like geysers. The vents of such geysers are artificial, but are tapped into natural hydrothermal systems. These so-called &quot;artificial geysers&quot;, technically known as &quot;erupting geothermal wells&quot;, are not true geysers. Little Old Faithful Geyser, in Calistoga, California, is an example. The geyser erupts from the casing of a well drilled in the late 19th century, which opened up a dead geyser.

In the case of the Big Mine Run Geyser in Ashland, Pennsylvania, the heat powering the geyser (which erupts from an abandoned mine vent) comes not from geothermal power, but from the long-simmering Centralia mine fire.

=== Perpetual spouter ===
This is a natural hot spring that spouts water constantly without stopping for recharge. Some of these are incorrectly called geysers, but because they are not periodic in nature they are not considered true geysers.

== Commercialization ==
Geysers are used for various activities such as electricity generation, heating and geotourism. Many geothermal reserves are found all around the world. The geyser fields in Iceland are some of the most commercially viable geyser locations in the world. Since the 1920s hot water directed from the geysers has been used to heat greenhouses and to grow food that otherwise could not have been cultivated in Iceland&#x27;s inhospitable climate. Steam and hot water from the geysers has also been used for heating homes since 1943 in Iceland. In 1979 the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) actively promoted development of geothermal energy in the &quot;Geysers-Calistoga Known Geothermal Resource Area&quot; (KGRA) near Calistoga, California through a variety of research programs and the Geothermal Loan Guarantee Program. The department is obligated by law to assess the potential environmental impacts of geothermal development.

== Extraterrestrial geyser-like features ==
There are many bodies in the Solar System where eruptions which superficially resemble terrestrial geysers have been observed or are believed to occur. Despite being commonly referred to as geysers, they are driven by fundamentally different processes, consist of a wide range of volatiles, and can occur on vastly disparate scales; from the modestly sized Martian carbon dioxide jets to the immense plumes of Enceladus. Generally, there are two broad categories of feature commonly referred to as geysers: sublimation plumes, and cryovolcanic plumes (also referred to as cryogeysers).

Sublimation plumes are jets of sublimated volatiles and dust from shallow sources under icy surfaces. Known examples include the CO2 jets on Mars, and the nitrogen eruptions on Neptune&#x27;s moon Triton.

On Mars carbon dioxide jets are believed to occur in the southern polar region of Mars during spring, as a layer of dry ice accumulated over winter is warmed by the sun. Although these jets have not yet been directly observed, they leave evidence visible from orbit in the form of dark spots and lighter fans atop the dry ice. These features consist primarily of sand and dust blown out by the outbursts, as well as spider-like patterns of channels created below the ice by the rapid flow of CO2 gas. There are a plethora of theories to explain the eruptions, including heating from sunlight, chemical reactions, or even biological activity.

Triton was found to have active eruptions of nitrogen and dust by &quot;Voyager 2&quot; when it flew past the moon in 1989. These plumes were up to 8km high, where winds would blow them up to 150km downwind, creating long, dark streaks across the otherwise bright south polar ice cap. There are various theories as to what drives the activity on Triton, such as solar heating through transparent ice, cryovolcanism, or basal heating of nitrogen ice sheets.

Cryovolcanic plumes or cryogeysers generally refer to large-scale eruptions of predominantly water vapour from active cryovolcanic features on certain icy moons. Such plumes occur on Saturn&#x27;s moon Enceladus and Jupiter&#x27;s moon Europa.

Plumes of water vapour, together with ice particles and smaller amounts of other components (such as carbon dioxide, nitrogen, ammonia, hydrocarbons and silicates), have been observed erupting from vents associated with the &quot;tiger stripes&quot; in the south polar region of Enceladus by the &quot;Cassini&quot; orbiter. These plumes are the source of the material in Saturn&#x27;s E ring. The mechanism which causes these eruptions are generated remains uncertain, as well as to what extent they are physically linked to Enceladus&#x27; subsurface ocean, but they are believed to be powered at least in part by tidal heating. &quot;Cassini&quot; flew through these plumes several times, allowing direct analysis of water from inside another solar system body for the first time.

In December 2013, the Hubble Space Telescope detected water vapour plumes potentially 200km high above the south polar region of Europa. Re-examination of &quot;Galileo&quot; data also suggested that it may have flown through a plume during a flyby in 1997. Water was also detected by the Keck Observatory in 2016, announced in a 2019 Nature article speculating the cause to be a cryovolcanic eruption. It is thought that Europa&#x27;s lineae might be venting this water vapour into space in a similar manner to the &quot;tiger stripes&quot; of Enceladus.

<text>In mathematics, Gaussian elimination, also known as row reduction, is an algorithm for solving systems of linear equations. It consists of a sequence of row-wise operations performed on the corresponding matrix of coefficients. This method can also be used to compute the rank of a matrix, the determinant of a square matrix, and the inverse of an invertible matrix. The method is named after Carl Friedrich Gauss (1777–1855). To perform row reduction on a matrix, one uses a sequence of elementary row operations to modify the matrix until the lower left-hand corner of the matrix is filled with zeros, as much as possible. There are three types of elementary row operations:
* Swapping two rows,
* Multiplying a row by a nonzero number,
* Adding a multiple of one row to another row.
Using these operations, a matrix can always be transformed into an upper triangular matrix (possibly bordered by rows or columns of zeros), and in fact one that is in row echelon form. Once all of the leading coefficients (the leftmost nonzero entry in each row) are 1, and every column containing a leading coefficient has zeros elsewhere, the matrix is said to be in reduced row echelon form. This final form is unique; in other words, it is independent of the sequence of row operations used. For example, in the following sequence of row operations (where two elementary operations on different rows are done at the first and third steps), the third and fourth matrices are the ones in row echelon form, and the final matrix is the unique reduced row echelon form.
formula_1

Using row operations to convert a matrix into reduced row echelon form is sometimes called . In this case, the term &quot;Gaussian elimination&quot; refers to the process until it has reached its upper triangular, or (unreduced) row echelon form. For computational reasons, when solving systems of linear equations, it is sometimes preferable to stop row operations before the matrix is completely reduced.

== Definitions and example of algorithm ==
The process of row reduction makes use of elementary row operations, and can be divided into two parts. The first part (sometimes called forward elimination) reduces a given system to row echelon form, from which one can tell whether there are no solutions, a unique solution, or infinitely many solutions. The second part (sometimes called back substitution) continues to use row operations until the solution is found; in other words, it puts the matrix into reduced row echelon form.

Another point of view, which turns out to be very useful to analyze the algorithm, is that row reduction produces a matrix decomposition of the original matrix. The elementary row operations may be viewed as the multiplication on the left of the original matrix by elementary matrices. Alternatively, a sequence of elementary operations that reduces a single row may be viewed as multiplication by a Frobenius matrix. Then the first part of the algorithm computes an LU decomposition, while the second part writes the original matrix as the product of a uniquely determined invertible matrix and a uniquely determined reduced row echelon matrix.

=== Row operations ===
There are three types of elementary row operations which may be performed on the rows of a matrix:
# Interchanging two rows.
# Multiplying a row by a non-zero scalar.
# Adding a scalar multiple of one row to another.

If the matrix is associated to a system of linear equations, then these operations do not change the solution set. Therefore, if one&#x27;s goal is to solve a system of linear equations, then using these row operations could make the problem easier.

=== Echelon form ===
For each row in a matrix, if the row does not consist of only zeros, then the leftmost nonzero entry is called the &quot;leading coefficient&quot; (or &quot;pivot&quot;) of that row. So if two leading coefficients are in the same column, then a row operation of type 3 could be used to make one of those coefficients zero. Then by using the row swapping operation, one can always order the rows so that for every non-zero row, the leading coefficient is to the right of the leading coefficient of the row above. If this is the case, then matrix is said to be in row echelon form. So the lower left part of the matrix contains only zeros, and all of the zero rows are below the non-zero rows. The word &quot;echelon&quot; is used here because one can roughly think of the rows being ranked by their size, with the largest being at the top and the smallest being at the bottom.

For example, the following matrix is in row echelon form, and its leading coefficients are shown in red:
formula_2

It is in echelon form because the zero row is at the bottom, and the leading coefficient of the second row (in the third column), is to the right of the leading coefficient of the first row (in the second column).

A matrix is said to be in reduced row echelon form if furthermore all of the leading coefficients are equal to 1 (which can be achieved by using the elementary row operation of type 2), and in every column containing a leading coefficient, all of the other entries in that column are zero (which can be achieved by using elementary row operations of type 3).

=== Example of the algorithm ===
Suppose the goal is to find and describe the set of solutions to the following system of linear equations:
formula_3

The table below is the row reduction process applied simultaneously to the system of equations and its associated augmented matrix. In practice, one does not usually deal with the systems in terms of equations, but instead makes use of the augmented matrix, which is more suitable for computer manipulations. The row reduction procedure may be summarized as follows: eliminate from all equations below , and then eliminate from all equations below . This will put the system into triangular form. Then, using back-substitution, each unknown can be solved for.

The second column describes which row operations have just been performed. So for the first step, the is eliminated from by adding to . Next, is eliminated from by adding to . These row operations are labelled in the table as
formula_4

Once is also eliminated from the third row, the result is a system of linear equations in triangular form, and so the first part of the algorithm is complete. From a computational point of view, it is faster to solve the variables in reverse order, a process known as back-substitution. One sees the solution is , , and . So there is a unique solution to the original system of equations.

Instead of stopping once the matrix is in echelon form, one could continue until the matrix is in &quot;reduced&quot; row echelon form, as it is done in the table. The process of row reducing until the matrix is reduced is sometimes referred to as Gauss–Jordan elimination, to distinguish it from stopping after reaching echelon form.

== History ==
The method of Gaussian elimination appears – albeit without proof – in the Chinese mathematical text Chapter Eight: &quot;Rectangular Arrays&quot; of &quot;The Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art&quot;. Its use is illustrated in eighteen problems, with two to five equations. The first reference to the book by this title is dated to 179 AD, but parts of it were written as early as approximately 150 BC. It was commented on by Liu Hui in the 3rd century.

According to Grcar solution of linear equations by elimination was invented independently in several cultures in Eurasia starting from antiquity and in Europe definite examples of procedure were published already by late Renaissance (in 1550&#x27;s). It is quite possible that already then the procedure was considered by mathematicians elementary and in no need to explanation for professionals, so we may never learn its detailed history except that by then it was practiced in at least several places in Europe.

The method in Europe stems from the notes of Isaac Newton. In 1670, he wrote that all the algebra books known to him lacked a lesson for solving simultaneous equations, which Newton then supplied. Cambridge University eventually published the notes as &quot;Arithmetica Universalis&quot; in 1707 long after Newton had left academic life. The notes were widely imitated, which made (what is now called) Gaussian elimination a standard lesson in algebra textbooks by the end of the 18th century. Carl Friedrich Gauss in 1810 devised a notation for symmetric elimination that was adopted in the 19th century by professional hand computers to solve the normal equations of least-squares problems. The algorithm that is taught in high school was named for Gauss only in the 1950s as a result of confusion over the history of the subject.

Some authors use the term &quot;Gaussian elimination&quot; to refer only to the procedure until the matrix is in echelon form, and use the term Gauss–Jordan elimination to refer to the procedure which ends in reduced echelon form. The name is used because it is a variation of Gaussian elimination as described by Wilhelm Jordan in 1888. However, the method also appears in an article by Clasen published in the same year. Jordan and Clasen probably discovered Gauss–Jordan elimination independently.

== Applications ==
Historically, the first application of the row reduction method is for solving systems of linear equations. Below are some other important applications of the algorithm.

=== Computing determinants ===
To explain how Gaussian elimination allows the computation of the determinant of a square matrix, we have to recall how the elementary row operations change the determinant:
* Swapping two rows multiplies the determinant by −1
* Multiplying a row by a nonzero scalar multiplies the determinant by the same scalar
* Adding to one row a scalar multiple of another does not change the determinant.

If Gaussian elimination applied to a square matrix produces a row echelon matrix , let be the product of the scalars by which the determinant has been multiplied, using the above rules. Then the determinant of is the quotient by of the product of the elements of the diagonal of :
formula_5

Computationally, for an matrix, this method needs only arithmetic operations, while using Leibniz formula for determinants requires formula_6 operations , and
recursive Laplace expansion requires operations if the sub-determinants are memorized for being computed only once . Even on the fastest computers, these two methods are impractical or almost impracticable for above 20.

=== Finding the inverse of a matrix ===

A variant of Gaussian elimination called Gauss–Jordan elimination can be used for finding the inverse of a matrix, if it exists. If is an square matrix, then one can use row reduction to compute its inverse matrix, if it exists. First, the identity matrix is augmented to the right of , forming an block matrix . Now through application of elementary row operations, find the reduced echelon form of this matrix. The matrix is invertible if and only if the left block can be reduced to the identity matrix ; in this case the right block of the final matrix is . If the algorithm is unable to reduce the left block to , then is not invertible.

For example, consider the following matrix:
formula_7

To find the inverse of this matrix, one takes the following matrix augmented by the identity and row-reduces it as a 3 × 6 matrix:
formula_8

By performing row operations, one can check that the reduced row echelon form of this augmented matrix is
formula_9

One can think of each row operation as the left product by an elementary matrix. Denoting by the product of these elementary matrices, we showed, on the left, that , and therefore, . On the right, we kept a record of , which we know is the inverse desired. This procedure for finding the inverse works for square matrices of any size.

=== Computing ranks and bases ===
The Gaussian elimination algorithm can be applied to any matrix . In this way, for example, some 6 × 9 matrices can be transformed to a matrix that has a row echelon form like
formula_10
where the stars are arbitrary entries, and are nonzero entries. This echelon matrix contains a wealth of information about : the rank of is 5, since there are 5 nonzero rows in ; the vector space spanned by the columns of has a basis consisting of its columns 1, 3, 4, 7 and 9 (the columns with in ), and the stars show how the other columns of can be written as linear combinations of the basis columns.

All of this applies also to the reduced row echelon form, which is a particular row echelon format.

== Computational efficiency ==
The number of arithmetic operations required to perform row reduction is one way of measuring the algorithm&#x27;s computational efficiency. For example, to solve a system of equations for unknowns by performing row operations on the matrix until it is in echelon form, and then solving for each unknown in reverse order, requires divisions, multiplications, and subtractions, for a total of approximately operations. Thus it has a &quot;arithmetic complexity&quot; (time complexity, where each arithmetic operation take a unit of time, independently of the size of the inputs) of .

This complexity is a good measure of the time needed for the whole computation when the time for each arithmetic operation is approximately constant. This is the case when the coefficients are represented by floating-point numbers or when they belong to a finite field. If the coefficients are integers or rational numbers exactly represented, the intermediate entries can grow exponentially large, so the bit complexity is exponential.
However, Bareiss&#x27; algorithm is a variant of Gaussian elimination that avoids this exponential growth of the intermediate entries; with the same arithmetic complexity of , it has a bit complexity of , and has therefore a strongly-polynomial time complexity.

Gaussian elimination and its variants can be used on computers for systems with thousands of equations and unknowns. However, the cost becomes prohibitive for systems with millions of equations. These large systems are generally solved using iterative methods. Specific methods exist for systems whose coefficients follow a regular pattern (see system of linear equations).

===Bareiss algorithm===

The first strongly-polynomial time algorithm for Gaussian elimination was published by Jack Edmonds in 1967. Independently, and almost simultaneously, Erwin Bareiss discovered another algorithm, based on the following remark, which applies to a division-free variant of Gaussian elimination.

In standard Gaussian elimination, one subtracts from each row formula_11 below the pivot row formula_12 a multiple of formula_12 by formula_14 where formula_15 and formula_16 are the entries in the pivot column of formula_11 and formula_18 respectively.

Bareiss variant consists, instead, of replacing formula_11 with formula_20 This produces a row echelon form that has the same zero entries as with the standard Gaussian elimination.

Bareiss&#x27; main remark is that each matrix entry generated by this variant is the determinant of a submatrix of the original matrix.

In particular, if one starts with integer entries, the divisions occurring in the algorithm are exact divisions resulting in integers. So, all intermediate entries and final entries are integers. Moreover, Hadamard&#x27;s inequality provides an upper bound on the absolute values of the intermediate and final entries, and thus a bit complexity of formula_21 using soft O notation.

Moreover, as an upper bound on the size of final entries is known, a complexity formula_22 can be obtained with modular computation followed either by Chinese remaindering or Hensel lifting.

As a corollary, the following problems can be solved in strongly polynomial time with the same bit complexity:

* Testing whether &quot;m&quot; given rational vectors are linearly independent
* Computing the determinant of a rational matrix
* Computing a solution of a rational equation system &quot;Ax&quot; = &quot;b&quot;
* Computing the inverse matrix of a nonsingular rational matrix
* Computing the rank of a rational matrix

=== Numeric instability ===
One possible problem is numerical instability, caused by the possibility of dividing by very small numbers. If, for example, the leading coefficient of one of the rows is very close to zero, then to row-reduce the matrix, one would need to divide by that number. This means that any error which existed for the number that was close to zero would be amplified. Gaussian elimination is numerically stable for diagonally dominant or positive-definite matrices. For general matrices, Gaussian elimination is usually considered to be stable, when using partial pivoting, even though there are examples of stable matrices for which it is unstable.

== Generalizations ==
Gaussian elimination can be performed over any field, not just the real numbers.

Buchberger&#x27;s algorithm is a generalization of Gaussian elimination to systems of polynomial equations. This generalization depends heavily on the notion of a monomial order. The choice of an ordering on the variables is already implicit in Gaussian elimination, manifesting as the choice to work from left to right when selecting pivot positions.

Computing the rank of a tensor of order greater than 2 is NP-hard. Therefore, if , there cannot be a polynomial time analog of Gaussian elimination for higher-order tensors (matrices are array representations of order-2 tensors).

== Pseudocode ==

As explained above, Gaussian elimination transforms a given matrix into a matrix in row-echelon form.

In the following pseudocode, codice_1 denotes the entry of the matrix in row and column with the indices starting from 1. The transformation is performed &quot;in place&quot;, meaning that the original matrix is lost for being eventually replaced by its row-echelon form.

 h := 1 /* &quot;Initialization of the pivot row&quot; */
 k := 1 /* &quot;Initialization of the pivot column&quot; */
 while h ≤ m and k ≤ n
 /* &quot;Find the k-th pivot:&quot; */
 i_max := argmax (i = h ... m, abs(A[i, k]))
 if A[i_max, k] = 0
 /* &quot;No pivot in this column, pass to next column&quot; */
 k := k + 1
 else
 swap rows(h, i_max)
 /* &quot;Do for all rows below pivot:&quot; */
 for i = h + 1 ... m:
 f := A[i, k] / A[h, k]
 /* &quot;Fill with zeros the lower part of pivot column:&quot; */
 A[i, k] := 0
 /* &quot;Do for all remaining elements in current row:&quot; */
 for j = k + 1 ... n:
 A[i, j] := A[i, j] - A[h, j] * f
 /* &quot;Increase pivot row and column&quot; */
 h := h + 1
 k := k + 1

This algorithm differs slightly from the one discussed earlier, by choosing a pivot with largest absolute value. Such a &quot;partial pivoting&quot; may be required if, at the pivot place, the entry of the matrix is zero. In any case, choosing the largest possible absolute value of the pivot improves the numerical stability of the algorithm, when floating point is used for representing numbers.

Upon completion of this procedure the matrix will be in row echelon form and the corresponding system may be solved by back substitution.

<text>Guantanamo Bay Naval Base (), officially known as Naval Station Guantanamo Bay or NSGB, (also called GTMO, pronounced Gitmo as jargon by members of the U.S. military) is a United States military base occupying a location on of land and water on the shore of Guantánamo Bay at the southeastern end of Cuba. It has been leased to the United States with no end date since 1903 as a coaling station and naval base, making it the oldest overseas U.S. naval base. The lease was $2,000 in gold per year until 1934, when the payment was set to match the value of gold in dollars; in 1974, the yearly lease was set to $4,085. 

Since taking power in 1959, the Cuban government has consistently protested against the U.S. presence on Cuban soil, arguing that the base was imposed on Cuba by force and is illegal under international law. Since 2002, the naval base has contained a military prison, for alleged unlawful combatants captured in Afghanistan, Iraq, and other places during the War on Terror. Cases of alleged torture of prisoners by the U.S. military, and their denial of protection under the Geneva Conventions, have been criticized. The base has been a focal point for debates over civil liberties, notably influenced by the landmark 2008 Supreme Court decision in &quot;Boumediene v. Bush&quot;. This ruling affirmed the constitutional right of detainees to challenge their detention through habeas corpus, highlighting the ongoing tensions between national security measures and fundamental civil liberties.

The 1903 lease has no fixed expiration date; as such, it could only be ended if the US Navy decided to abandon the area or both countries agreed mutually to end the lease.

== Geography ==
The Naval Base occupies three main geographical sections: Leeward Point, Windward Point, and Guantánamo Bay. Guantánamo Bay physically divides the Naval Station into sections. The bay extends past the boundaries of the base into Cuba, where the bay is then referred to as Bahía de Guantánamo. Guantánamo Bay contains several cays, which are identified as Hospital Cay, Medico Cay, North Toro Cay, and South Toro Cay.

Leeward Point of the Naval Station is the site of the active airfield. Major geographical features on Leeward Point include Mohomilla Bay and the Guantánamo River. Three beaches exist on the Leeward side. Two are available for use by base residents, while the third, Hicacal Beach, is closed. Nearby is the US Naval Cemetery at Guantanamo Bay, also known as Cuzco Wells Cemetery. The cemetery holds over 350 burials including that of Captain Henry Smith who died as a result of injuries received during the sinking of his ship the SS Delmundo by the German submarine U-600 on 13 August 1942. 

Windward Point contains most of the activities at the Naval Station. There are nine beaches available to base personnel. The highest point on the base is John Paul Jones Hill (named after the Revolutionary War hero of the same name) at a total of . The geography of Windward Point is such that there are many coves and peninsulas along the bay shoreline providing ideal areas for mooring ships.
According to Stephen Benz, Stephen Crane described the area as &quot;craggy&quot; and &quot;cut with ravines.&quot; He also described the coastline as covered in ridges and &quot;chalky cliffs&quot;.

== History ==

=== Spanish colonial era ===
The area surrounding Guantanamo Bay was originally inhabited by the Taíno people. On 30 April 1494, Christopher Columbus, on his second voyage, arrived and spent the night. The place where Columbus landed is now known as Fisherman&#x27;s Point. Columbus declared the bay &quot;Puerto Grande&quot;. The bay and surrounding areas briefly came under British control during the War of Jenkins&#x27; Ear. Prior to the outbreak of the conflict, the bay was referred to as &quot;Walthenham Harbor&quot; by British cartographers. The British expeditionary force renamed the bay &quot;Cumberland Bay&quot;. They eventually retreated from the area after an attempt to march to Santiago de Cuba was repulsed by Spanish troops.

===Spanish–American War ===

During the Spanish–American War, the U.S. fleet attacking Santiago secured Guantánamo&#x27;s harbor for protection during the hurricane season of 1898. The Marines landed at Guantanamo Bay with naval support, and American and Cuban forces routed the defending Spanish troops. There is a monument on McCalla Hill to one Navy officer and five Marines who died in battle at Guantanamo Bay.

The war ended with the Treaty of Paris of 1898, in which Spain formally relinquished control of Cuba. Although the war was over, the United States maintained a strong military presence on the island. In 1901 the United States government passed the Platt Amendment as part of an Army Appropriations Bill. Section VII of this amendment read

After initial resistance by the Cuban Constitutional Convention, the Platt Amendment was incorporated into the Constitution of the Republic of Cuba in 1901. The Constitution took effect in 1902, and land for a naval base at Guantanamo Bay was granted to the United States the following year.

=== Permanent lease ===

The 1903 lease agreement, which has no fixed expiration date, was executed in two parts. The first, signed in February, consisted of the following provisions: 
#Agreement – The United States of America and the Republic of Cuba, desiring to maintain the Independence of Cuba, will enter into a lease for lands necessary for US Naval Stations.
#Article 1 – Describes the boundaries of the areas being leased, Guantanamo Bay and Bahia Honda. 
#Article 2 – The U.S. may occupy, use, and modify the properties to fit the needs of a coaling and naval station, only. Vessels in the Cuban trade shall have free passage. 
#Article 3 – Cuba retains ultimate sovereignty, but during the occupation, the U.S. exercises sole jurisdiction over the areas described in Article 1. Under conditions to be agreed on, the U.S. has the right to acquire, by purchase or eminent domain, any land included therein.

The second part, signed five months later in July 1903, consisted of the following provisions: 
#Article 1 – Payment is $2000 gold coin, annually. All private lands within the boundaries shall be acquired by Cuba. The U.S. will advance rental payments to Cuba to facilitate those purchases. 
#Article 2 – The U.S. shall pay for a survey of the sites and mark the boundaries with fences.
#Article 3 – There will be no commercial or other enterprise within the leased areas.
#Article 4 – Mutual extradition
#Article 5 – Not ports of entry. 
#Article 6 – Ships shall be subject to Cuban port police. The U.S. will not obstruct entry or departure into the bay. 
#Article 7 – This proposal is open for seven months. 
SIGNED Theodore Roosevelt and Jose M Garcia Montes.

In 1934, the United States unilaterally changed the payment from gold coin to U.S. dollars per the Gold Reserve Act. The lease amount was set at US$3,386.25, based on the price of gold at the time. In 1973, the U.S. adjusted the lease amount to $3,676.50, and in 1974 to $4,085, based on further increases to the price of gold in USD. Payments have been sent annually, but only one lease payment has been accepted since the Cuban Revolution and Fidel Castro claimed that this check was deposited due to confusion in 1959. The Cuban government has not deposited any other lease check since that time.
=== Before and during World War II ===
The Naval Base became a prime area for winter training for the Atlantic fleet. Due to the large increase in population during the training months, the Naval Base quickly established facilities to support everyday functions. Construction of the Guantanamo Bay fleet range system began as early as 1905 under Captain Rogers. Four primary ranges were built during its construction: Range Alpha, Range Beta, Range Charlie, and Range Delta. Due to the size of the base, sections were shut down in order for range operations to proceed. Ironically, the concrete range system&#x27;s size and cost led to its downfall. Strong evidence suggests the fleet ranges were used throughout World War I and the beginning of World War II.

During World War II, the base was set up to use a nondescript number for postal operations. The base used the Fleet Post Office, Atlantic, in New York City, with the address: 115 FPO NY. The base was also an important intermediate distribution point for merchant shipping convoys from New York City and Key West, Florida, to the Panama Canal and the islands of Puerto Rico, Jamaica, and Trinidad and Tobago.

===Cold War and beyond===

From 1953 to 1959, thousands of Cubans commuted daily from outside the base to jobs within it. In mid-1958, vehicular traffic was stopped; workers were required to walk through the base&#x27;s several gates. Public Works Center buses were pressed into service almost overnight to carry the tides of workers to and from the gate. 

The &quot;Cactus Curtain&quot; is a term describing the line separating the naval base from Cuban-controlled territory, an allusion to Europe&#x27;s Iron Curtain, the Bamboo Curtain in East Asia, and the similar Ice Curtain in the Bering Strait. After the Cuban Revolution, some Cubans sought refuge on the Guantanamo Bay Naval Base. In late 1961, Cuban troops planted an long, wide barrier of &quot;Opuntia&quot; (prickly pear) cactus along the northeastern section of the fence surrounding the base in order to prevent checkpoint evasion when moving between the base and Cuba proper.

The curtain forms part of a &quot;no man&#x27;s land&quot; that encircles the base. This area is complete with perimeter patrols, outposts featuring sandbags, and watchtowers, and has been complemented with barbed wire fences, minefields, and cacti. Apart from the cacti, both U.S. and Cuban troops erected, maintained, and otherwise manned these defenses, primarily to prevent checkpoint evasion and possible invasion from the other side.
U.S. and Cuban troops placed some 55,000 anti-personnel and anti-tank land mines across the &quot;no man&#x27;s land&quot; around the perimeter of the naval base, creating the second-largest minefield in the world, and the largest in the Western Hemisphere. Initially, the mines were laid down by US troops, who also laid down signs stating that the landmines were &quot;precautions&quot; and should not be viewed as &quot;aggressive&quot;. In response, Cuban troops also laid down their own mines, with both sides completing their minefields in 1961. Between 1961 and 1965, landmine explosions resulted in the deaths of at least 10 people, including as the result of engineering accidents and late-night partygoers. On 16 May 1996, U.S. President Bill Clinton ordered the demining of the American field. They have since been replaced with motion and sound sensors to detect intruders on the base. The Cuban government has not removed its corresponding minefield outside the perimeter.

During the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962, the families of military personnel were evacuated from the base. Notified of the evacuation on 22 October, evacuees were told to pack one suitcase per family member, to bring evacuation and immunization cards, to tie pets in the yard, to leave the keys to the house on the dining table, and to wait in front of the house for buses. Dependents traveled to the airfield for flights to the United States, or to ports for passage aboard evacuation ships. After the crisis was resolved, family members were allowed to return to the base in December 1962.

From 1939, the base&#x27;s water was supplied by pipelines that drew water from the Yateras River about northeast of the base. The U.S. government paid a fee for this; in 1964, it was about $14,000 a month for about per day. In 1964, the Cuban government stopped the flow. The base had about of water in storage, and strict water conservation was put into effect immediately. The U.S. first imported water from Jamaica by barge, then relocated a desalination plant from San Diego (Point Loma). When the Cuban government accused the United States of &quot;stealing water&quot;, base commander John D. Bulkeley ordered that the pipelines be cut and a section removed. A length of the diameter pipe and a length of the diameter pipe were lifted from the ground and the openings sealed.

During the 1960s and 1970s, the base had problems with alcohol and racial tension. Harassment and strip searches also became a regular occurrence for Cuban workers on the base.

Several old guns from the USS &quot;Monongahela&quot; (1862) have been salvaged and placed around the base. The old warship served as a storeship at Guantanamo until destroyed by fire on 17 March 1908. A gun was salvaged from her wreck and put on display at the Naval Station. Since the gun was deformed by the heat from the fire, it was nicknamed &quot;Old Droopy&quot;. A similar gun, possibly also salvaged from the &quot;Monongahela&quot;, is on display near the Bay View Club on the Naval Station.

By 2006, only two elderly Cubans, Luis Delarosa and Harry Henry, still crossed the base&#x27;s North East Gate daily to work on the base, because the Cuban government prohibited new recruitment since 1959. They both retired at the end of 2012. At the United Nations Human Rights Council in 2013, Cuba&#x27;s Foreign Minister demanded the U.S. return the base.

==Current operations==
The military facility has over 8,500 U.S. sailors and Marines stationed there. It is the only military base the U.S. maintains in a socialist country.

In 2005, the U.S. Navy completed a $12 million wind-power project at the base, erecting four 950 kilowatt, wind turbines, reducing the reliance on diesel fuel to power the existing diesel generators (the base&#x27;s primary electricity generation). In 2006, the wind turbines reduced diesel fuel consumption by annually.

=== Units and commands ===
Access to the Naval Station is very limited and must be pre-approved through the appropriate local chain of command with the Commander of the station as the final approval. Since berthing facilities are limited, visitors must be sponsored indicating that they have an approved residence for the duration of the visit.

; Civilian contractors
Besides servicemembers, the base houses a large number of civilian contractors working for the military. Many of these contractors are migrant workers from Jamaica and the Philippines, and are thought to constitute up to 40% of the base&#x27;s population.

Major contractors working at NSGB have included the following:
* KBR
* Schuyler Line Navigation Company (SLNC)
* Satellite Communication Systems Incorporated
* Centerra
* EMCOR
* Islands Mechanical Contractor
* Munilla Construction Management
* RQ Construction
* MCM Construction
* J&amp;J Worldwide Services

===Cargo shipping===
Ocean transportation is provided by Schuyler Line Navigation Company, a U.S. Flag Ocean Carrier. Schuyler Line operates under government contract to supply sustainment and building supplies to the base.

=== Airfields ===
There are two airfields within the base, Leeward Point Field and McCalla Field. Leeward Point Field is the active military airfield, with the ICAO code MUGM and IATA code NBW. McCalla Field was designated as the auxiliary landing field in 1970s, but was no longer a viable airfield by the 1990s.

==== Leeward Point Field ====
Leeward Point Field was constructed with a 6,000-foot main runway in 1943; the runway was extended in 1953 to 8,000 feet to accommodate jet aircraft. 

Leeward Point Field has a single active runway, 10/28, measuring . The former runway, 9/27 was . Currently, Leeward Point Field operates several aircraft and helicopters supporting base operations. Leeward Point Field was home to Fleet Composite Squadron 10 (VC-10) until the unit was phased out in 1993. VC-10 was one of the last active-duty squadrons flying the Douglas A-4 Skyhawk.

==== McCalla Field ====
McCalla Field was established in 1931 and remained operational until 1970. The airfield was named for Bowman H. McCalla, who was a United States Navy admiral in charge of the Battle of Guantánamo Bay. The current field was expanded in 1941 when the original grass runway was replaced. Naval Air Station Guantanamo Bay was officially established 1 February 1941. Aircraft routinely operating out of McCalla included JRF-5, N3N, J2F, C-1 Trader, and dirigibles. 

The airfield was deactivated in the 1970s and was used to house Cuban and Haitian refugees beginning in the 1990s. Sometime between 1996 and 2001, the refugee camps were dismantled and the area became a collection of abandoned buildings. McCalla Field is now listed as a closed airfield. The USN aviation assets are now located across the bay at Leeward Point Field, about 1.5 miles to the west.

After the events of September 11, the area was reevaluated as a possible location for a detention facility. Camp Justice is now located on the grounds of the former airfield.

The area formerly consisted of three runways, all now closed: 1/19 at , 14/32 at , and 10/28 at . 

The former airfield resides at an elevation of above mean sea level.

=== Detention camp ===

Beginning in the last quarter of the 20th century, the base was used to house Cuban and Haitian refugees intercepted on the high seas. In the early 1990s, it held refugees who fled Haiti after military forces overthrew president Jean-Bertrand Aristide. These refugees were held in a detainment area called Camp Bulkeley until United States district court Judge Sterling Johnson, Jr. declared the camp unconstitutional on 8 June 1993. This decision was later vacated. The last Haitian migrants departed Guantanamo on 1 November 1995.

Beginning in 2002, following the U.S. invasion of Afghanistan, started in response to the September 11 attacks, a small portion of the base was used to detain several hundred individuals with ties or suspected ties to Islamic terrorist groups such as al-Qaeda and the Taliban. These detainees were not afforded POW status or facing formal charges but instead designated enemy combatants; assigned to confinement in Camp Delta, Camp Echo, Camp Iguana, and the now-closed Camp X-Ray. In litigation regarding the availability of fundamental rights to those imprisoned at the base, the U.S. Supreme Court has recognized that the detainees &quot;have been imprisoned in territory over which the United States exercises exclusive jurisdiction and control.&quot; Therefore, the detainees have the fundamental right to due process of law under the Fifth Amendment. A district court has since held that the &quot;Geneva Conventions applied to the Taliban detainees, but not to members of Al-Qaeda terrorist organization.&quot;

On 10 June 2006, the Department of Defense reported that three Guantanamo Bay detainees took their own lives. The military reported the men hanged themselves with nooses made of sheets and clothes. A study published by Seton Hall Law&#x27;s Center for Policy and Research, while making no conclusions regarding what actually transpired, asserts that the military investigation failed to address significant issues detailed in that report.

On 6 September 2006, President George W. Bush announced that alleged or non-alleged combatants held by the CIA would be transferred to the custody of Department of Defense, and held at Guantanamo Prison. Of approximately 500 prisoners in Guantanamo Bay, only 10 have been tried by the Guantanamo military commission, but all cases have been stayed pending the adjustments being made to comply with the U.S. Supreme Court decision in &quot;Hamdi v. Rumsfeld&quot;.

In January 2009, President Obama signed an executive order directing the closing of the Guantánamo detention camp within a year. This plan was thwarted for the time being on 20 May 2009, when the United States Senate voted to keep the prison at Guantanamo Bay open for the foreseeable future and forbid the transfer of any detainees to facilities in the United States. Senator Daniel Inouye, a Democrat from Hawaii and chairman of the appropriations committee, said he favored keeping Guantanamo open until Obama produced a &quot;coherent plan for closing the prison.&quot;
Consequently, Obama decided to postpone difficult decisions on the details for at least six months. On 7 March 2011, Obama issued a new executive order permitting indefinite detention of Guantánamo detainees. This decision was codified into federal law by provision added to the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012. 

In early February 2021, the administration of U.S. President Joe Biden declared his intention to shut down the facility before he leaves office. He did not.

In July 2021, an additional detainee was released.

In June 2022, an Afghan prisoner held at Guantanamo Bay for about 15 years without trial was released.

In February 2023, three prisoners were released from Guantanamo Bay. Majid Khan, who pleaded guilty before a Military Commission in 2012, had completed his sentence of 10 years, and was released to Belize. Brothers Abdul Al-Rahim Ghulam Rabbani and Mohammed Ahmad Ghulam Rabbani, whose detentions were deemed no longer necessary in order to protect the United States from a national security threat, were released and repatriated to the government of Pakistan.

In March 2023, Ghassan al-Sharbi was released to his home country of Saudi Arabia from Guantanamo Bay, after being deemed no longer necessary to detain in order to protect the United States from a national security threat.

In June 2023, United Nations Special Rapporteur on Human Rights and Counter-Terrorism Fionnuala Ní Aoláin released her final report on the detention center. The report concludes that prisoners endure &quot;ongoing cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment&quot; and that the detention center should be closed.

== Represented businesses ==

Despite the prohibition on the establishment of &quot;commercial or other enterprises&quot; as stated in Article 3 of the second part of the lease, several recognized American food outlets have been opened at the military base. Most of the restaurants on the installation are franchises which are owned and operated by the Department of the Navy. Proceeds from these restaurants are used to support Morale, Welfare and Recreation (MWR) activities for service personnel and their families. These restaurants are located inside the base; as such, they are not accessible to Cubans.

A Baskin-Robbins ice cream stand, which opened in the 1980s, was one of the first business franchises allowed on the base. In early 1986, the base added the first and only McDonald&#x27;s restaurant within Cuba. A Subway restaurant was opened in 1987 and closed in 1994 when the Navy Department refused to renew the lease. In 2004, a combined KFC and A&amp;W restaurant was opened at the bowling alley and a Pizza Hut Express was added to the Windjammer Restaurant. There is also a cafe that sells Starbucks coffee, and there is a combined KFC and Taco Bell restaurant.

== Education and schooling ==
Department of Defense Education Activity (DoDEA) provides for the education of dependent personnel with two schools. Both schools are named for Rear Admiral William Thomas Sampson. W.T. Sampson Elementary School serves grades K–5 and W. T. Sampson High School serves grades 6–12. The Villamar Child Development Center provides child care for dependents from six weeks to five years old. MWR operates a Youth Center that provides activities for dependents.

Some former students of Guantánamo have shared stories of their experiences with the Guantánamo Public Memory Project. The 2013 documentary &quot;Guantanamo Circus&quot; directed by Christina Linhardt and Michael Rose reveals a glimpse of day-to-day life on GTMO as seen through the eyes of circus performers who visit the base. It is used as a reference by the Guantánamo Public Memory Project.

== Climate ==
The bay has an annual rainfall of about . The amount of rainfall has resulted in the base being classified as a semi-arid desert environment. The annual average high temperature on the base is , the annual average low is .

<text>Gladstone Gander is a cartoon character created in 1948 by Carl Barks for &quot;Walt Disney&#x27;s Comics and Stories&quot;. He is an anthropomorphic gander (male goose) who possesses exceptionally good luck that grants him anything he desires as well as protecting him from any harm. This is in contrast to his cousin Donald Duck, who is often characterized for having bad luck. Gladstone is also a rival of Donald for the affection of Daisy Duck. Gladstone dresses in a very debonair way, often in a suit, and wearing a bow-tie, fedora, and spats. He has a wavy hairstyle which is depicted either as white or blonde. In the story &quot;Luck of the North&quot; (December 1949), he is described as having a brassy voice.

== Origin ==
Gladstone Gander first appeared in &quot;Wintertime Wager&quot; in &quot;Walt Disney&#x27;s Comics and Stories&quot; #88 (January 1948), written and drawn by Carl Barks. In that story he arrives at Donald Duck&#x27;s house during a freezing cold Christmas Day to remind him of a wager Donald made the previous summer; that he could swim in the Frozenbear Lake during Christmas Day or forfeit his house to Gladstone. Donald eventually loses the wager but Gladstone later on loses a wager of his own, brought to light by Daisy Duck, and thus Donald&#x27;s house is returned to him.

Barks gradually developed Gladstone&#x27;s personality and demeanor after his first appearance and used him quite frequently—in 24 stories between 1948 and 1953, the first five years of his existence. In his first three appearances in 1948 (&quot;Wintertime Wager&quot;, &quot;Gladstone Returns&quot;, &quot;Links Hijinks&quot;), he was portrayed as the mirror image of Donald: an obstinate braggart, perhaps just a little bit more arrogant, but did not yet have his characteristic luck. In his next two appearances, &quot;Rival Beachcombers&quot; and &quot;The Goldilocks Gambit&quot;, Gladstone is portrayed as merely lazy and irritable, and also gullible. The breakthrough of his lucky streak occurs in 1949, within the adventure story &quot;Race to the South Seas!&quot; (&quot;March of Comics&quot; #41). In that story, Donald and his three nephews set sail on a rescue mission from Duckburg to a remote Pacific island on which Scrooge McDuck is believed to have stranded, in an attempt to gain their uncle&#x27;s favor. For the same reason Gladstone is in hot pursuit as well, but because he was &quot;born lucky&quot; as Donald explains to his nephews, without lifting a finger, is having a much easier time than them.

His and Donald&#x27;s rivalry over Daisy is established in &quot;Donald&#x27;s Love Letters&quot; (1949), &quot;Wild About Flowers&quot; (1950), and &quot;Knightly Rivals&quot; (1951), and as potential heirs to Scrooge&#x27;s fortune in &quot;Some Heir Over the Rainbow&quot; (1953). After that, Barks felt unable to develop the character further, finding him basically unsympathetic, and began using him less frequently. But by then, Gladstone had found a steady place in the Duck universe as one of the main established characters; frequently used by other writers and artists both in the Americas and Europe. He was first used by an artist other than Barks in 1951: &quot;Presents For All&quot; by Del Connell and Bob Moore. He appears as a main character in the Big Little Book series book &quot;Luck of the Ducks&quot; (1969).

== Character ==

Gladstone&#x27;s good luck defies probability and provides him with anything that would be to his benefit or enjoyment; as well as things he specifically wishes for, which are at times related to the plot of some stories. This could range from finding wallets and other valuables on the sidewalk to pieces of a ripped apart treasure map floating together in river to form it whole again; revealing the treasure&#x27;s location. His good luck also protects him from any harm. At times he might not even know that a situation will work out in his favor in a later stage and by then often feeling confused or at times even thinking his luck has abandoned him; just to learn that it has been with him all along.

There have been various explanations for Gladstone&#x27;s good luck over the years by various writers and artists. In Barks&#x27; story &quot;Luck of the North&quot; Gladstone proclaims: &quot;I was born under a lucky star, and everything I do will bring me good fortune [...].&quot; This is read from a horoscope book he owns which also has a map showing his lucky star conniving with the planet Neptunus. In many of the Italian comic books stories, Gladstone is bestowed with his luck because Fortuna, the goddess of fortune, is in love with him. In Don Rosa&#x27;s story &quot;The Sign of the Triple Distelfink&quot; (1997), he added the fact that Gladstone was born on the day of his mother Daphne&#x27;s birthday in 1920, under the protection sign of the Triple Distelfink, thus inheriting his mother&#x27;s luck. In some stories he also uses good luck charms like lucky horseshoes or rabbits foots.

However, for all his luck, Gladstone has no achievements to be proud of and no true ambitions, as he is incapable of long-term planning. This is all because of that he does not have to make the slightest of efforts to get what he wants, as his good luck will just give it to him in the end. He also often does not learn any life lessons from any misfortunes he could experience. This leads him to be extremely lazy; at times even thinking that willfully wishing for something is hard work, and disconnected from the realities of ordinary life. All of this is in stark contrast to his relative Scrooge McDuck, who is also capable of taking advantage of opportunities but works hard to create situations favorable for him; is strongly motivated by his ambitions and takes pride in forming his fortune by his own efforts and experiences. Instead, Gladstone often shows pride in his effortlessness and expresses great anxiety if he would betray those ideals. This is something first explored in more detail in Carl Barks&#x27;s story &quot;Gladstone&#x27;s Terrible Secret&quot; (May, 1952). Comic artist and writer Don Rosa has commented about this on the character: &quot;Gladstone is unwilling to make the slightest effort to gain something that his luck cannot give him, and, when things go wrong, he resigns immediately, certain that around the next corner a wallet, dropped by a passer-by, will be waiting for him&quot;. Gladstone feels open contempt towards work of any kind, claiming it is beneath him, to the point of hesitating to help others even if it is to his own advantage, claiming that it seems alarmingly like work.

Also because of his good fortune, Gladstone is most often characterized to be very snobbish and a gloat; especially (and in some stories exclusively) toward his cousin Donald to whom he also can be very aggravating. For all of these reasons, he and Donald have formed an intense rivalry with each other. Gladstone&#x27;s outrageous luck and boastfulness toward his cousin, combined with Donald&#x27;s own ego and belief he can still best him despite all odds — or as Don Rosa&#x27;s version of Donald comments, &quot;Donald&#x27;s eternal tendency towards self-destruction&quot; — have set the stage for many stories featuring the two cousins&#x27; confrontations. They have, however, worked together or at least tolerated each other at times, but this is very rare and not without some tension that easily can turn into their ordinary rivalry.

Occasionally, he is a rival to Scrooge McDuck himself who resents his complete reliance on his uncanny good luck. In such stories, often the only way Gladstone can be believably defeated is to have him win by the letter of the original story preset while the heroes later on take the bigger prize. In Carl Barks&#x27; story &quot;The Golden Nugget Boat&quot; (&quot;Uncle Scrooge&quot; #35, September 1961), Gladstone and Scrooge are competing in a gold prospecting contest in which Gladstone finds a gold nugget the nephews fashioned from a gold item Scrooge already owns to stop him from killing himself from overexertion in the contest. Gladstone finds the nugget and returns to win, but Scrooge and his nephews then find a much bigger nugget they are able to fashion into a boat to return to civilization afterward with a monetary worth that is easily more than Gladstone&#x27;s find. Another instance of this with his rivalry with Donald was in the &quot;Salmon Derby&quot; (&quot;Walt Disney&#x27;s Comics and Stories&quot; #167, August 1954), where Gladstone catches the biggest fish and wins a new car but Donald manages to save a wealthy tycoon&#x27;s daughter and is able to purchase a much bigger car. Another instance was when both Donald and Gladstone were competing for a job as a cameraman for a nature film director because Daisy was the director&#x27;s assistant, Gladstone got the job but wished he had not because he wound up trudging through a swamp to film giant spiders while Daisy stayed behind in America, with Donald.

In more modern stories where he takes a more protagonistic role, writers most often downplay his unlikability to make him more relatable. For example, showing that he can learn from potential bad experiences, even if they never would become reality, and put more emphasis on his love for his family, even if he at times has a hard time expressing these feelings.

In many stories, Gladstone is also considered among the prime candidates for Scrooge McDuck&#x27;s succession. In &quot;Some Heir Over the Rainbow&quot; (&quot;Walt Disney&#x27;s Comics and Stories&quot; #155, August 1953) by Carl Barks, Scrooge gives $1,000 to Donald, Gladstone, and Huey, Dewey and Louie to determine how they use it in order to be the most suitable heir to his fortune. Gladstone thinks of using the money to buy a television set until he finds a raffle ticket, in which he decides to save the money by placing it in a tree. Scrooge is unimpressed that Gladstone did not increase the money at all, but acknowledges that at least he still &quot;had&quot; it. Huey, Dewey, and Louie infuriate Scrooge by investing their money in what Scrooge assumes was a scam. Finally, Scrooge thinks to himself, &quot;I guess my heir will have to be Gladstone Gander! ... What an awful injustice to the world!&quot; Soon afterwards, however, the children&#x27;s decision proves to be the wisest, and they become Scrooge&#x27;s heirs instead of Gladstone.

He is a rival of Donald for the love of his girlfriend Daisy Duck. This is often portrayed either by showing Daisy uncertain of which one she likes the most or; the more common version, that she is angry with Donald and goes out with Gladstone instead to make Donald jealous. In modern comics this love-triangle is at times often more downplayed. However, despite having an eternal crush on Daisy Duck, Gladstone has appeared in love with other duck girls in Italian and Danish comic stories. One of those is Linda Paper, who really conquered Gladstone, making him want to give up all his luck, since she is unlucky and absolutely hates lucky people. She appeared in two subsequent comic stories. Another is Feather Mallard, who is as lucky as Gladstone but whenever they are together they are instead experiencing bad luck. A number of recent Italian stories feature Gladstone&#x27;s protector goddess Fortuna appearing in person. She appears in one noteworthy tale, &quot;Gastone e il debole dalla Fortuna&quot; (&quot;Gladstone and the Struck of Luck&quot;), by Enrico Faccini and Augusto Macchetto, first published on March 24, 1998. In this story, the Goddess takes mortal guise in order to be able to date her favorite gander, and appears to be love-struck with him. Although Gladstone competes for Daisy&#x27;s attention and affection with Donald and often loses, he reassures himself that at least he still has his extraordinary luck, because in the end he is a hedonist and the only person he really adores is himself.

His exact relation to the Duck Family Tree at its early stages was somewhat uncertain. In Carl Barks&#x27; original version of the family tree from the 1950s, Gladstone was the son of Luke the Goose and Daphne Duck who died by overeating at a free-lunch picnic. He was later adopted by Matilda McDuck and Goosetave Gander. Later, Barks is reported to have done away with the adoption, which was never featured in any story. (Of course, no stories denying the event were published.) In a more recent version of the family tree created by Don Rosa, with input from Barks, it was established that Daphne Duck (Donald&#x27;s paternal aunt) married Goostave Gander and the two were Gladstone&#x27;s parents. This is consistent with what Gladstone says in &quot;Race to the South Seas&quot;: &quot;Scrooge McDuck is my mother&#x27;s brother&#x27;s brother-in-law&quot;.

Gladstone has a nephew named Shamrock Gladstone who shares his propensity for luck. He also has a con artist cousin (not on Donald&#x27;s side of the family) named Disraeli Duck.

== Animation ==
Gladstone makes two speaking appearances in the animated series &quot;DuckTales&quot;, where he was voiced by Rob Paulsen. In these episodes he is not characterized as much of a braggart he is in the comics but rather focusing much more on his care-free nature, and additionally acting a bit more foolishly. In the episode &quot;Dime Enough for Luck&quot;, Gladstone is an unwitting stooge for Magica De Spell in one of her attempts to steal Scrooge&#x27;s Number One Dime. He returns in the episode &quot;Dr. Jekyll &amp; Mr. McDuck&quot;, where he accidentally bids on an item that turns out to be valuable. This inspires Scrooge to bid on the next item—a trunk containing Dr. Jekyll&#x27;s formula—which sets the plot in motion. He also makes non-speaking cameo appearances in the episodes &quot;Sweet Duck of Youth&quot; and &quot;Till Nephews Do Us Part&quot;, as well in episode of &quot;House of Mouse&quot; titled &quot;Goofy For A Day&quot;. Gladstone appears in the 2000 video game &quot;Donald Duck: Goin&#x27; Quackers&quot; in his traditional role of Donald&#x27;s rival for Daisy&#x27;s affection, and every time a Boss Battle is about to start, Gladstone greets Donald, but always gets hurt, becoming squished by a giant bird, getting knocked off a building by a wrecking ball, being sent crashing to the bottom of a haunted mansion, and even gets sent back to Duckburg inside a pipe, and every time he gets hurt, he says that he has found a nickel. He also appears in the &quot;DuckTales&quot; reboot, first appearing in the episode &quot;The House of the Lucky Gander!&quot;. In this series, he is voiced by Paul F. Tompkins. This series brings his personality far closer to how he acts in the comics, although it is implied that he is genuinely unaware of how arrogant he is.
