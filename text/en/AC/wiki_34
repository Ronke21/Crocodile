<text>Gradualism, from the Latin (&quot;step&quot;), is a hypothesis, a theory or a tenet assuming that change comes about gradually or that variation is gradual in nature and happens over time as opposed to in large steps. Uniformitarianism, incrementalism, and reformism are similar concepts. 

Gradualism can also refer to desired, controlled change in society, institutions, or policies. For example, social democrats and democratic socialists see the socialist society as achieved through gradualism.

==Geology and biology==
In the natural sciences, gradualism is the theory which holds that profound change is the cumulative product of slow but continuous processes, often contrasted with catastrophism. The theory was proposed in 1795 by James Hutton, a Scottish geologist, and was later incorporated into Charles Lyell&#x27;s theory of uniformitarianism. Tenets from both theories were applied to biology and formed the basis of early evolutionary theory.

Charles Darwin was influenced by Lyell&#x27;s &quot;Principles of Geology&quot;, which explained both uniformitarian methodology and theory. Using uniformitarianism, which states that one cannot make an appeal to any force or phenomenon which cannot presently be observed (see catastrophism), Darwin theorized that the evolutionary process must occur gradually, not in saltations, since saltations are not presently observed, and extreme deviations from the usual phenotypic variation would be more likely to be selected against.

Gradualism is often confused with the concept of phyletic gradualism. It is a term coined by Stephen Jay Gould and Niles Eldredge to contrast with their model of punctuated equilibrium, which is gradualist itself, but argues that most evolution is marked by long periods of evolutionary stability (called stasis), which is punctuated by rare instances of branching evolution.

Phyletic gradualism is a model of evolution which theorizes that most speciation is slow, uniform and gradual. When evolution occurs in this mode, it is usually by the steady transformation of a whole species into a new one (through a process called anagenesis). In this view no clear line of demarcation exists between an ancestral species and a descendant species, unless splitting occurs.

Punctuated gradualism is a microevolutionary hypothesis that refers to a species that has &quot;relative stasis over a considerable part of its total duration [and] underwent periodic, relatively rapid, morphologic change that did not lead to lineage branching&quot;. It is one of the three common models of evolution. While the traditional model of palaeontology, the phylogenetic model, states that features evolved slowly without any direct association with speciation, the relatively newer and more controversial idea of punctuated equilibrium claims that major evolutionary changes do not happen over a gradual period but in localized, rare, rapid events of branching speciation. Punctuated gradualism is considered to be a variation of these models, lying somewhere in between the phyletic gradualism model and the punctuated equilibrium model. It states that speciation is not needed for a lineage to rapidly evolve from one equilibrium to another but may show rapid transitions between long-stable states.

== Politics and society ==
In politics, gradualism is the hypothesis that social change can be achieved in small, discrete increments rather than in abrupt strokes such as revolutions or uprisings. Gradualism is one of the defining features of political liberalism and reformism. Machiavellian politics pushes politicians to espouse gradualism.

Gradualism in social change implemented through reformist means is a moral principle to which the Fabian Society is committed. In a more general way, reformism is the assumption that gradual changes through and within existing institutions can ultimately change a society&#x27;s fundamental economic system and political structures; and that an accumulation of reforms can lead to the emergence of an entirely different economic system and form of society than present-day capitalism. That hypothesis of social change grew out of opposition to revolutionary socialism, which contends that revolution is necessary for fundamental structural changes to occur.

In socialist politics and within the socialist movement, the concept of gradualism is frequently distinguished from reformism, with the former insisting that short-term goals need to be formulated and implemented in such a way that they inevitably lead into long-term goals. It is most commonly associated with the libertarian socialist concept of dual power and is seen as a middle way between reformism and revolutionism.

Martin Luther King Jr. was opposed to the idea of gradualism as a method of eliminating segregation. The United States government wanted to try to integrate African-Americans and European-Americans slowly into the same society, but many believed it was a way for the government to put off actually doing anything about racial segregation:

===Conspiracy theories===
In the terminology of NWO-related speculations, gradualism refers to the gradual implementation of a totalitarian world government.

== Linguistics and language change ==
In linguistics, language change is seen as gradual, the product of chain reactions and subject to cyclic drift. The view that creole languages are the product of catastrophism is heavily disputed.

==Morality==
===Christianity===
===Buddhism, Theravada and Yoga===
Gradualism is the approach of certain schools of Buddhism and other Eastern philosophies (e.g. Theravada or Yoga), that enlightenment can be achieved step by step, through an arduous practice. The opposite approach, that insight is attained all at once, is called subitism. The debate on the issue was very important to the history of the development of Zen, which rejected gradualism, and to the establishment of the opposite approach within the Tibetan Buddhism, after the Debate of Samye. It was continued in other schools of Indian and Chinese philosophy.

==Philosophy==
Contradictorial gradualism is the paraconsistent treatment of fuzziness developed by Lorenzo Pe√±a which regards true contradictions as situations wherein a state of affairs enjoys only partial existence.

<doc id="11883" wikidata="Q21200" url="?curid=11883" title="Germanic languages">
<text>The Germanic languages are a branch of the Indo-European language family spoken natively by a population of about 515 million people mainly in Europe, North America, Oceania, and Southern Africa. The most widely spoken Germanic language, English, is also the world&#x27;s most widely spoken language with an estimated 2 billion speakers. All Germanic languages are derived from Proto-Germanic, spoken in Iron Age Scandinavia, Iron Age Northern Germany and along the North Sea and Baltic coasts.

The West Germanic languages include the three most widely spoken Germanic languages: English with around 360‚Äì400 million native speakers; German, with over 100 million native speakers; and Dutch, with 24 million native speakers. Other West Germanic languages include Afrikaans, an offshoot of Dutch originating from the Afrikaners of South Africa, with over 7.1 million native speakers; Low German, considered a separate collection of unstandardized dialects, with roughly 4.35‚Äì7.15 million native speakers and probably 6.7‚Äì10 million people who can understand it (at least 2.2 million in Germany (2016) and 2.15 million in the Netherlands (2003)); Yiddish, once used by approximately 13 million Jews in pre-World War II Europe, now with approximately 1.5 million native speakers; Scots, with 1.5 million native speakers; Limburgish varieties with roughly 1.3 million speakers along the Dutch‚ÄìBelgian‚ÄìGerman border; and the Frisian languages with over 500,000 native speakers in the Netherlands and Germany.

The largest North Germanic languages are Swedish, Danish, and Norwegian, which are in part mutually intelligible and have a combined total of about 20 million native speakers in the Nordic countries and an additional five million second language speakers; since the Middle Ages, however, these languages have been strongly influenced by Middle Low German, a West Germanic language, and Low German words account for about 30‚Äì60% of their vocabularies according to various estimates. Other extant North Germanic languages are Faroese, Icelandic, and Elfdalian, which are more conservative languages with no significant Low German influence, more complex grammar and limited mutual intelligibility with other North Germanic languages today.

The East Germanic branch included Gothic, Burgundian, and Vandalic, all of which are now extinct. The last to die off was Crimean Gothic, spoken until the late 18th century in some isolated areas of Crimea.

The SIL &quot;Ethnologue&quot; lists 48 different living Germanic languages, 41 of which belong to the Western branch and six to the Northern branch; it places Riograndenser Hunsr√ºckisch German in neither of the categories, but it is often considered a German dialect by linguists. The total number of Germanic languages throughout history is unknown as some of them, especially the East Germanic languages, disappeared during or after the Migration Period. Some of the West Germanic languages also did not survive past the Migration Period, including Lombardic. As a result of World War II and subsequent mass expulsion of Germans, the German language suffered a significant loss of &quot;Sprachraum&quot;, as well as moribundity and extinction of several of its dialects. In the 21st century, German dialects are dying out as Standard German gains primacy.

The common ancestor of all of the languages in this branch is called Proto-Germanic, also known as Common Germanic, which was spoken in about the middle of the 1st millennium BC in Iron Age Scandinavia. Proto-Germanic, along with all of its descendants, notably has a number of unique linguistic features, most famously the consonant change known as &quot;Grimm&#x27;s law.&quot; Early varieties of Germanic entered history when the Germanic tribes moved south from Scandinavia in the 2nd century BC to settle in the area of today&#x27;s northern Germany and southern Denmark.

==Modern status==
===West Germanic languages===
English is an official language of Belize, Canada, Nigeria, Falkland Islands, Saint Helena, Malta, New Zealand, Ireland, South Africa, Philippines, Jamaica, Dominica, Guyana, Trinidad and Tobago, American Samoa, Palau, St. Lucia, Grenada, Barbados, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, Puerto Rico, Guam, Hong Kong, Singapore, Pakistan, India, Papua New Guinea, Namibia, Vanuatu, the Solomon Islands and former British colonies in Asia, Africa and Oceania. Furthermore, it is the &quot;de facto&quot; language of the United Kingdom, the United States and Australia, as well as a recognized language in Nicaragua and Malaysia.

German is a language of Austria, Belgium, Germany, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg and Switzerland; it also has regional status in Italy, Poland, Namibia and Denmark. German also continues to be spoken as a minority language by immigrant communities in North America, South America, Central America, Mexico and Australia. A German dialect, Pennsylvania Dutch, is still used among various populations in the American state of Pennsylvania in daily life. A group of Alemannic German dialects commonly referred to as Alsatian is spoken in Alsace, part of modern France.

Dutch is an official language of Aruba, Belgium, Cura√ßao, the Netherlands, Sint Maarten, and Suriname. The Netherlands also colonized Indonesia, but Dutch was scrapped as an official language after Indonesian independence. Today, it is only used by older or traditionally educated people. Dutch was until 1983 an official language in South Africa but evolved into and was replaced by Afrikaans, a partially mutually intelligible daughter language of Dutch.

Afrikaans is one of the 11 official languages in South Africa and is a &quot;lingua franca&quot; of Namibia. It is used in other Southern African nations, as well.

Low German is a collection of very diverse dialects spoken in the northeast of the Netherlands and northern Germany. Some dialects like East Pomeranian have been imported to South America.

Scots is spoken in Lowland Scotland and parts of Ulster (where the local dialect is known as Ulster Scots).

Frisian is spoken among half a million people who live on the southern fringes of the North Sea in the Netherlands and Germany.

Luxembourgish is a Moselle Franconian dialect that is spoken mainly in the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, where it is considered to be an official language. Similar varieties of Moselle Franconian are spoken in small parts of Belgium, France, and Germany.

Yiddish, once a native language of some 11 to 13 million people, remains in use by some 1.5 million speakers in Jewish communities around the world, mainly in North America, Europe, Israel, and other regions with Jewish populations.

Limburgish varieties are spoken in the Limburg and Rhineland regions, along the Dutch‚ÄìBelgian‚ÄìGerman border.

===North Germanic languages===
In addition to being the official language in Sweden, Swedish is also spoken natively by the Swedish-speaking minority in Finland, which is a large part of the population along the coast of western and southern Finland. Swedish is also one of the two official languages in Finland, along with Finnish, and the only official language in √Öland. Swedish is also spoken by some people in Estonia.

Danish is an official language of Denmark and in its overseas territory of the Faroe Islands, and it is a &quot;lingua franca&quot; and language of education in its other overseas territory of Greenland, where it was one of the official languages until 2009. Danish, a locally recognized minority language, is also natively spoken by the Danish minority in the German state of Schleswig-Holstein.

Norwegian is the official language of Norway (both Bokm√•l and Nynorsk). Norwegian is also the official language in the overseas territories of Norway such as Svalbard, Jan Mayen, Bouvet island, Queen Maud Land, and Peter I island.

Icelandic is the official language of Iceland.

Faroese is the official language of the Faroe Islands, and is also spoken by some people in Denmark.

==History==

All Germanic languages are thought to be descended from a hypothetical Proto-Germanic, united by subjection to the sound shifts of Grimm&#x27;s law and Verner&#x27;s law. These probably took place during the Pre-Roman Iron Age of Northern Europe from . Proto-Germanic itself was likely spoken after , and Proto-Norse from the 2nd century AD and later is still quite close to reconstructed Proto-Germanic, but other common innovations separating Germanic from Proto-Indo-European suggest a common history of pre-Proto-Germanic speakers throughout the Nordic Bronze Age.

From the time of their earliest attestation, the Germanic varieties are divided into three groups: West, East, and North Germanic. Their exact relation is difficult to determine from the sparse evidence of runic inscriptions.

The western group would have formed in the late Jastorf culture, and the eastern group may be derived from the 1st-century variety of Gotland, leaving southern Sweden as the original location of the northern group. The earliest period of Elder Futhark (2nd to 4th centuries) predates the division in regional script variants, and linguistically essentially still reflects the Common Germanic stage. The Vimose inscriptions include some of the oldest datable Germanic inscriptions, starting in .

The earliest coherent Germanic text preserved is the 4th-century Gothic translation of the New Testament by Ulfilas. Early testimonies of West Germanic are in Old Frankish/Old Dutch (the 5th-century Bergakker inscription), Old High German (scattered words and sentences 6th century and coherent texts 9th century), and Old English (oldest texts 650, coherent texts 10th century). North Germanic is only attested in scattered runic inscriptions, as Proto-Norse, until it evolves into Old Norse by about 800.

Longer runic inscriptions survive from the 8th and 9th centuries (Eggjum stone, R√∂k stone), longer texts in the Latin alphabet survive from the 12th century (), and some skaldic poetry dates back to as early as the 9th century.

By about the 10th century, the varieties had diverged enough to make mutual intelligibility difficult. The linguistic contact of the Viking settlers of the Danelaw with the Anglo-Saxons left traces in the English language and is suspected to have facilitated the collapse of Old English grammar that, combined with the influx of Romance Old French vocabulary after the Norman Conquest, resulted in Middle English from the 12th century.

The East Germanic languages were marginalized from the end of the Migration Period. The Burgundians, Goths, and Vandals became linguistically assimilated by their respective neighbors by about the 7th century, with only Crimean Gothic lingering on until the 18th century.

During the early Middle Ages, the West Germanic languages were separated by the insular development of Middle English on one hand and by the High German consonant shift on the continent on the other, resulting in Upper German and Low Saxon, with graded intermediate Central German varieties. By early modern times, the span had extended into considerable differences, ranging from Highest Alemannic in the South to Northern Low Saxon in the North, and, although both extremes are considered German, they are hardly mutually intelligible. The southernmost varieties had completed the second sound shift, while the northern varieties remained unaffected by the consonant shift.

The North Germanic languages, on the other hand, remained unified until well past 1000 AD, and in fact the mainland Scandinavian languages still largely retain mutual intelligibility into modern times. The main split in these languages is between the mainland languages and the island languages to the west, especially Icelandic, which has maintained the grammar of Old Norse virtually unchanged, while the mainland languages have diverged greatly.

==Distinctive characteristics==
Germanic languages possess a number of defining features compared with other Indo-European languages.

Some of the best-known are the following:
# The sound changes known as Grimm&#x27;s Law and Verner&#x27;s Law, which shifted the values of all the Indo-European stop consonants (for example, original * became Germanic * in most cases; compare &quot;three&quot; with Latin , &quot;two&quot; with Latin , &quot;do&quot; with Sanskrit ). The recognition of these two sound laws were seminal events in the understanding of the regular nature of linguistic sound change and the development of the comparative method, which forms the basis of modern historical linguistics.
# The development of a strong stress on the first syllable of the word, which triggered significant phonological reduction of all other syllables. This is responsible for the reduction of most of the basic English, Norwegian, Danish and Swedish words into monosyllables, and the common impression of modern English and German as consonant-heavy languages. Examples are Proto-Germanic ‚Üí &quot;strength&quot;, ‚Üí &quot;ant&quot;, ‚Üí &quot;head&quot;, ‚Üí &quot;hear&quot;, ‚Üí German &quot;autumn, harvest&quot;, ‚Üí German &quot;witch, hag&quot;.
# A change known as Germanic umlaut, which modified vowel qualities when a high front vocalic segment (, or ) followed in the next syllable. Generally, back vowels were fronted, and front vowels were raised. In many languages, the modified vowels are indicated with an umlaut mark (e.g., in German, pronounced , respectively). This change resulted in pervasive alternations in related words ‚Äî prominent in modern German and present to a lesser extent in modern English (e.g., &quot;mouse/mice&quot;, &quot;goose/geese&quot;, &quot;broad/breadth&quot;, &quot;tell/told&quot;, &quot;old/elder&quot;, &quot;foul/filth&quot;, &quot;gold/gild&quot;).
# Large numbers of vowel qualities. English has around 11‚Äì12 vowels in most dialects (not counting diphthongs), Standard Swedish has 17 pure vowels (monophthongs), standard German and Dutch 14, and Danish at least 11. The Amstetten dialect of Bavarian German has 13 distinctions among long vowels alone, one of the largest such inventories in the world.
# &quot;Verb second&quot; (V2) word order, which is uncommon cross-linguistically. Exactly one noun phrase or adverbial element must precede the verb; in particular, if an adverb or prepositional phrase precedes the verb, then the subject must immediately follow the finite verb. In modern English, this survives to a lesser extent, known as &quot;inversion&quot;: examples include some constructions with &quot;here&quot; or &quot;there&quot; (&quot;Here comes the sun; there are five continents&quot;), verbs of speech after a quote (&quot;&quot;Yes&quot;, said John&quot;), sentences beginning with certain conjunctions (&quot;Hardly had he said this when...; Only much later did he realize...&quot;) and sentences beginning with certain adverbs of motion to create a sense of drama (&quot;Over went the boat; out ran the cat; Pop Goes The Weasel&quot;). It is more common in other modern Germanic languages.

Other significant characteristics are:
# The reduction of the various tense and aspect combinations of the Indo-European verbal system into only two: the present tense and the past tense (also called the preterite).
# The development of a new class of weak verbs that use a dental suffix (, or ) instead of vowel alternation (Indo-European ablaut) to indicate past tense. The vast majority of verbs in all Germanic languages are weak; the remaining verbs with vowel ablaut are the strong verbs. The distinction has been lost in Afrikaans.
# A distinction in definiteness of a noun phrase that is marked by different sets of inflectional endings for adjectives, the so-called strong and weak inflections. A similar development happened in the Balto-Slavic languages. This distinction has been lost in modern English but was present in Old English and remains in all other Germanic languages to various degrees.
# Some words with etymologies that are difficult to link to other Indo-European families but with variants that appear in almost all Germanic languages. See Germanic substrate hypothesis.
#Discourse particles, which are a class of short, unstressed words which speakers use to express their attitude towards the utterance or the hearer. This word category seems to be rare outside of the Germanic languages. An example would be the word &#x27;just&#x27;, which the speaker can use to express surprise.

Some of the characteristics present in Germanic languages were not present in Proto-Germanic but developed later as areal features that spread from language to language:
* Germanic umlaut only affected the North and West Germanic languages (which represent all modern Germanic languages) but not the now-extinct East Germanic languages, such as Gothic, nor Proto-Germanic, the common ancestor of all Germanic languages.
* The large inventory of vowel qualities is a later development, due to a combination of Germanic umlaut and the tendency in many Germanic languages for pairs of long/short vowels of originally identical quality to develop distinct qualities, with the length distinction sometimes eventually lost. Proto-Germanic had only five distinct vowel qualities, although there were more actual vowel phonemes because length and possibly nasality were phonemic. In modern German, long-short vowel pairs still exist but are also distinct in quality.
* Proto-Germanic probably had a more general S-O-V-I word order. However, the tendency toward V2 order may have already been present in latent form and may be related to Wackernagel&#x27;s Law, an Indo-European law dictating that sentence clitics must be placed second.

Roughly speaking, Germanic languages differ in how conservative or how progressive each language is with respect to an overall trend toward analyticity. Some, such as Icelandic and, to a lesser extent, German, have preserved much of the complex inflectional morphology inherited from Proto-Germanic (and in turn from Proto-Indo-European). Others, such as English, Swedish, and Afrikaans, have moved toward a largely analytic type.

==Linguistic developments==

The subgroupings of the Germanic languages are defined by shared innovations. It is important to distinguish innovations from cases of linguistic conservatism. That is, if two languages in a family share a characteristic that is not observed in a third language, that is evidence of common ancestry of the two languages &quot;only if&quot; the characteristic is an innovation compared to the family&#x27;s proto-language.

The following innovations are common to the Northwest Germanic languages (all but Gothic):
* The lowering of /u/ to /o/ in initial syllables before /a/ in the following syllable: ‚Üí &quot;bode&quot;, Icelandic &quot;messages&quot; (&quot;a-Umlaut&quot;, traditionally called &quot;Brechung&quot;)
* &quot;Labial umlaut&quot; in unstressed medial syllables (the conversion of /a/ to /u/ and /≈ç/ to /≈´/ before /m/, or /u/ in the following syllable)
* The conversion of /ƒì1/ into /ƒÅ/ (vs. Gothic /ƒì/) in stressed syllables. In unstressed syllables, West Germanic also has this change, but North Germanic has shortened the vowel to /e/, then raised it to /i/. This suggests it was an areal change.
* The raising of final /≈ç/ to /u/ (Gothic lowers it to /a/). It is kept distinct from the nasal /«≠/, which is not raised.
* The monophthongization of /ai/ and /au/ to /ƒì/ and /≈ç/ in non-initial syllables (however, evidence for the development of /au/ in medial syllables is lacking).
* The development of an intensified demonstrative ending in /s/ (reflected in English &quot;this&quot; compared to &quot;the&quot;)
* Introduction of a distinct ablaut grade in Class VII strong verbs, while Gothic uses reduplication (e.g. Gothic &quot;haihait&quot;; ON, OE &quot;hƒìt&quot;, preterite of the Gmc verb &quot;*haitan&quot; &quot;to be called&quot;) as part of a comprehensive reformation of the Gmc Class VII from a reduplicating to a new ablaut pattern, which presumably started in verbs beginning with vowel or /h/ (a development which continues the general trend of de-reduplication in Gmc); there are forms (such as OE dial. &quot;heht&quot; instead of &quot;hƒìt&quot;) which retain traces of reduplication even in West and North Germanic

The following innovations are also common to the Northwest Germanic languages but represent areal changes:
* Proto-Germanic /z/ &gt; /r/ (e.g. Gothic &quot;dius&quot;; ON &quot;d»≥r&quot;, OHG &quot;tior&quot;, OE &quot;dƒìor&quot;, &quot;wild animal&quot;); note that this is not present in Proto-Norse and must be ordered after West Germanic loss of final /z/
* Germanic umlaut

The following innovations are common to the West Germanic languages:
* Loss of final /z/. In single-syllable words, Old High German retains it (as /r/), while it disappears in the other West Germanic languages.
* Change of [√∞] (fricative allophone of /d/) to stop [d] in all environments.
* Change of /l√æ/ to stop /ld/ (except word-finally).
* West Germanic gemination of consonants, except &quot;r&quot;, before /j/. This only occurred in short-stemmed words due to Sievers&#x27; law. Gemination of /p/, /t/, /k/ and /h/ is also observed before liquids.
* Labiovelar consonants become plain velar when non-initial.
* A particular type of &quot;umlaut&quot; /e-u-i/ &gt; /i-u-i/.
* Changes to the 2nd person singular past-tense: Replacement of the past-singular stem vowel with the past-plural stem vowel, and substitution of the ending &quot;-t&quot; with &quot;-ƒ´&quot;.
* Short forms (&quot;*stƒÅn, stƒìn&quot;, &quot;*gƒÅn, gƒìn&quot;) of the verbs for &quot;stand&quot; and &quot;go&quot;; but note that Crimean Gothic also has &quot;gƒìn&quot;.
* The development of a gerund.

The following innovations are common to the Ingvaeonic subgroup of the West Germanic languages, affecting mainly English, Frisian, and to a lesser extent Low German (all of which are Ingvaeonic), as well as Dutch, but not High German:
* The so-called Ingvaeonic nasal spirant law, with loss of /n/ before voiceless fricatives: e.g. &quot;*mun√æ&quot;, &quot;*gans&quot; &gt; Old English &quot;m≈´√æ, g≈çs&quot; &gt; &quot;mouth, goose&quot;, but German &quot;Mund, Gans&quot;.
* The loss of the Germanic reflexive pronoun . Dutch has reclaimed the reflexive pronoun from Middle High German .
* The reduction of the three Germanic verbal plural forms into one form ending in &quot;-√æ&quot;.
* The development of Class III weak verbs into a relic class consisting of four verbs (&quot;*sagjan&quot; &quot;to say&quot;, &quot;*hugjan&quot; &quot;to think&quot;, &quot;*habjan&quot; &quot;to have&quot;, &quot;*libjan&quot; &quot;to live&quot;; cf. the numerous Old High German verbs in &quot;-ƒìn&quot;).
* The split of the Class II weak verb ending &quot;*-≈ç-&quot; into &quot;*-≈ç-/-≈çja-&quot; (cf. Old English &quot;-ian&quot; &lt; &quot;-≈çjan&quot;, but Old High German &quot;-≈çn&quot;).
* Development of a plural ending *-≈çs in a-stem nouns (note, Gothic also has &quot;-≈çs&quot;, but this is an independent development, caused by terminal devoicing of &quot;*-≈çz&quot;; Old Frisian has &quot;-ar&quot;, which is thought to be a late borrowing from Danish). Cf. modern English plural &quot;-(e)s&quot;, but German plural &quot;-e&quot;.
* Possibly, the monophthongization of Germanic &quot;*ai&quot; to &quot;ƒì/ƒÅ&quot; (this may represent independent changes in Old Saxon and Anglo-Frisian).

The following innovations are common to the Anglo-Frisian subgroup of the Ingvaeonic languages:
* Raising of nasalized &quot;a, ƒÅ&quot; into &quot;o, ≈ç&quot;.
* Anglo-Frisian brightening: Fronting of non-nasal &quot;a, ƒÅ&quot; to &quot;√¶,«£&quot; when not followed by &quot;n&quot; or &quot;m&quot;.
* Metathesis of &quot;CrV&quot; into &quot;CVr&quot;, where &quot;C&quot; represents any consonant and &quot;V&quot; any vowel.
* Monophthongization of &quot;ai&quot; into &quot;ƒÅ&quot;.

==Common linguistic features==
===Phonology===
The oldest Germanic languages all share a number of features, which are assumed to be inherited from Proto-Germanic. Phonologically, it includes the important sound changes known as Grimm&#x27;s Law and Verner&#x27;s Law, which introduced a large number of fricatives; late Proto-Indo-European had only one, /s/.

The main vowel developments are the merging (in most circumstances) of long and short /a/ and /o/, producing short /a/ and long /≈ç/. That likewise affected the diphthongs, with PIE /ai/ and /oi/ merging into /ai/ and PIE /au/ and /ou/ merging into /au/. PIE /ei/ developed into long /ƒ´/. PIE long /ƒì/ developed into a vowel denoted as /ƒì1/ (often assumed to be phonetically ), while a new, fairly uncommon long vowel /ƒì2/ developed in varied and not completely understood circumstances. Proto-Germanic had no front rounded vowels, but all Germanic languages except for Gothic subsequently developed them through the process of i-umlaut.

Proto-Germanic developed a strong stress accent on the first syllable of the root, but remnants of the original free PIE accent are visible due to Verner&#x27;s Law, which was sensitive to this accent. That caused a steady erosion of vowels in unstressed syllables. In Proto-Germanic, that had progressed only to the point that absolutely-final short vowels (other than /i/ and /u/) were lost and absolutely-final long vowels were shortened, but all of the early literary languages show a more advanced state of vowel loss. This ultimately resulted in some languages (like Modern English) losing practically all vowels following the main stress and the consequent rise of a very large number of monosyllabic words.

====Table of outcomes====
The following table shows the main outcomes of Proto-Germanic vowels and consonants in the various older languages. For vowels, only the outcomes in stressed syllables are shown. Outcomes in unstressed syllables are quite different, vary from language to language and depend on a number of other factors (such as whether the syllable was medial or final, whether the syllable was open or closed and (in some cases) whether the preceding syllable was light or heavy).

Notes:
* &quot;C-&quot; means before a vowel (word-initially, or sometimes after a consonant).
* &quot;-C-&quot; means between vowels.
* &quot;-C&quot; means after a vowel (word-finally or before a consonant). Word-final outcomes generally occurred &quot;after&quot; deletion of final short vowels, which occurred shortly after Proto-Germanic and is reflected in the history of all written languages except for Proto-Norse.
* The above three are given in the order &quot;C-&quot;, &quot;-C-&quot;, &quot;-C&quot;. If one is omitted, the previous one applies. For example, &quot;f, -[v]-&quot; means that &quot;[v]&quot; occurs after a vowel regardless of what follows.
* Something like &quot;a(‚Ä¶u)&quot; means &quot;&quot;a&quot; if /u/ occurs in the next syllable&quot;.
* Something like &quot;a(n)&quot; means &quot;&quot;a&quot; if /n/ immediately follows&quot;.
* Something like &quot;(n)a&quot; means &quot;&quot;a&quot; if /n/ immediately precedes&quot;.

===Morphology===
The oldest Germanic languages have the typical complex inflected morphology of old Indo-European languages, with four or five noun cases; verbs marked for person, number, tense and mood; multiple noun and verb classes; few or no articles; and rather free word order. The old Germanic languages are famous for having only two tenses (present and past), with three PIE past-tense aspects (imperfect, aorist, and perfect/stative) merged into one and no new tenses (future, pluperfect, etc.) developing. There were three moods: indicative, subjunctive (developed from the PIE optative mood) and imperative. Gothic verbs had a number of archaic features inherited from PIE that were lost in the other Germanic languages with few traces, including dual endings, an inflected passive voice (derived from the PIE mediopassive voice), and a class of verbs with reduplication in the past tense (derived from the PIE perfect). The complex tense system of modern English (e.g. &quot;In three months, the house will still be being built&quot; or &quot;If you had not acted so stupidly, we would never have been caught&quot;) is almost entirely due to subsequent developments (although paralleled in many of the other Germanic languages).

Among the primary innovations in Proto-Germanic are the preterite present verbs, a special set of verbs whose present tense looks like the past tense of other verbs and which is the origin of most modal verbs in English; a past-tense ending; (in the so-called &quot;weak verbs&quot;, marked with &quot;-ed&quot; in English) that appears variously as /d/ or /t/, often assumed to be derived from the verb &quot;to do&quot;; and two separate sets of adjective endings, originally corresponding to a distinction between indefinite semantics (&quot;a man&quot;, with a combination of PIE adjective and pronoun endings) and definite semantics (&quot;the man&quot;, with endings derived from PIE &quot;n&quot;-stem nouns).

Note that most modern Germanic languages have lost most of the inherited inflectional morphology as a result of the steady attrition of unstressed endings triggered by the strong initial stress. (Contrast, for example, the Balto-Slavic languages, which have largely kept the Indo-European pitch accent and consequently preserved much of the inherited morphology.) Icelandic and to a lesser extent modern German best preserve the Proto‚ÄìGermanic inflectional system, with four noun cases, three genders, and well-marked verbs. English and Afrikaans are at the other extreme, with almost no remaining inflectional morphology.

The following shows a typical masculine &quot;a&quot;-stem noun, Proto-Germanic &quot;*fiskaz&quot; (&quot;fish&quot;), and its development in the various old literary languages:

====Strong vs. weak nouns and adjectives====

Originally, adjectives in Proto-Indo-European followed the same declensional classes as nouns. The most common class (the &quot;o/ƒÅ&quot; class) used a combination of &quot;o&quot;-stem endings for masculine and neuter genders and &quot;ƒÅ&quot;-stems ending for feminine genders, but other common classes (e.g. the &quot;i&quot; class and &quot;u&quot; class) used endings from a single vowel-stem declension for all genders, and various other classes existed that were based on other declensions. A quite different set of &quot;pronominal&quot; endings was used for pronouns, determiners, and words with related semantics (e.g., &quot;all&quot;, &quot;only&quot;).

An important innovation in Proto-Germanic was the development of two separate sets of adjective endings, originally corresponding to a distinction between indefinite semantics (&quot;a man&quot;) and definite semantics (&quot;the man&quot;). The endings of indefinite adjectives were derived from a combination of pronominal endings with one of the common vowel-stem adjective declensions ‚Äì usually the &quot;o/ƒÅ&quot; class (often termed the &quot;a/≈ç&quot; class in the specific context of the Germanic languages) but sometimes the &quot;i&quot; or &quot;u&quot; classes. Definite adjectives, however, had endings based on &quot;n&quot;-stem nouns. Originally both types of adjectives could be used by themselves, but already by Proto-Germanic times a pattern evolved whereby definite adjectives had to be accompanied by a determiner with definite semantics (e.g., a definite article, demonstrative pronoun, possessive pronoun, or the like), while indefinite adjectives were used in other circumstances (either accompanied by a word with indefinite semantics such as &quot;a&quot;, &quot;one&quot;, or &quot;some&quot; or unaccompanied).

In the 19th century, the two types of adjectives ‚Äì indefinite and definite ‚Äì were respectively termed &quot;strong&quot; and &quot;weak&quot;, names which are still commonly used. These names were based on the appearance of the two sets of endings in modern German. In German, the distinctive case endings formerly present on nouns have largely disappeared, with the result that the load of distinguishing one case from another is almost entirely carried by determiners and adjectives. Furthermore, due to regular sound change, the various definite (&quot;n&quot;-stem) adjective endings coalesced to the point where only two endings (&quot;-e&quot; and &quot;-en&quot;) remain in modern German to express the sixteen possible inflectional categories of the language (masculine/feminine/neuter/plural crossed with nominative/accusative/dative/genitive ‚Äì modern German merges all genders in the plural). The indefinite (&quot;a/≈ç&quot;-stem) adjective endings were less affected by sound change, with six endings remaining (&quot;-, -e, -es, -er, -em, -en&quot;), cleverly distributed in a way that is capable of expressing the various inflectional categories without too much ambiguity. As a result, the definite endings were thought of as too &quot;weak&quot; to carry inflectional meaning and in need of &quot;strengthening&quot; by the presence of an accompanying determiner, while the indefinite endings were viewed as &quot;strong&quot; enough to indicate the inflectional categories even when standing alone. (This view is enhanced by the fact that modern German largely uses weak-ending adjectives when accompanying an indefinite article, and hence the indefinite/definite distinction no longer clearly applies.) By analogy, the terms &quot;strong&quot; and &quot;weak&quot; were extended to the corresponding noun classes, with &quot;a&quot;-stem and &quot;≈ç&quot;-stem nouns termed &quot;strong&quot; and &quot;n&quot;-stem nouns termed &quot;weak&quot;.

However, in Proto-Germanic ‚Äì and still in Gothic, the most conservative Germanic language ‚Äì the terms &quot;strong&quot; and &quot;weak&quot; are not clearly appropriate. For one thing, there were a large number of noun declensions. The &quot;a&quot;-stem, &quot;≈ç&quot;-stem, and &quot;n&quot;-stem declensions were the most common and represented targets into which the other declensions were eventually absorbed, but this process occurred only gradually. Originally the &quot;n&quot;-stem declension was not a single declension but a set of separate declensions (e.g., &quot;-an&quot;, &quot;-≈çn&quot;, &quot;-ƒ´n&quot;) with related endings, and these endings were in no way any &quot;weaker&quot; than the endings of any other declensions. (For example, among the eight possible inflectional categories of a noun ‚Äî singular/plural crossed with nominative/accusative/dative/genitive ‚Äî masculine &quot;an&quot;-stem nouns in Gothic include seven endings, and feminine &quot;≈çn&quot;-stem nouns include six endings, meaning there is very little ambiguity of &quot;weakness&quot; in these endings and in fact much less than in the German &quot;strong&quot; endings.) Although it is possible to group the various noun declensions into three basic categories ‚Äî vowel-stem, &quot;n&quot;-stem, and other-consonant-stem (a.k.a. &quot;minor declensions&quot;) ‚Äî the vowel-stem nouns do not display any sort of unity in their endings that supports grouping them together with each other but separate from the &quot;n&quot;-stem endings.

It is only in later languages that the binary distinction between &quot;strong&quot; and &quot;weak&quot; nouns become more relevant. In Old English, the &quot;n&quot;-stem nouns form a single, clear class, but the masculine &quot;a&quot;-stem and feminine &quot;≈ç&quot;-stem nouns have little in common with each other, and neither has much similarity to the small class of &quot;u&quot;-stem nouns. Similarly, in Old Norse, the masculine &quot;a&quot;-stem and feminine &quot;≈ç&quot;-stem nouns have little in common with each other, and the continuations of the masculine &quot;an&quot;-stem and feminine &quot;≈çn/ƒ´n&quot;-stem nouns are also quite distinct. It is only in Middle Dutch and modern German that the various vowel-stem nouns have merged to the point that a binary strong/weak distinction clearly applies.

As a result, newer grammatical descriptions of the Germanic languages often avoid the terms &quot;strong&quot; and &quot;weak&quot; except in conjunction with German itself, preferring instead to use the terms &quot;indefinite&quot; and &quot;definite&quot; for adjectives and to distinguish nouns by their actual stem class.

In English, both sets of adjective endings were lost entirely in the late Middle English period.

==Classification==
Note that divisions between and among subfamilies of Germanic are rarely precisely defined; most form continuous clines, with adjacent varieties being mutually intelligible and more separated ones not. Within the Germanic language family are East Germanic, West Germanic, and North Germanic. However, East Germanic languages became extinct several centuries ago.
All living Germanic languages belong either to the West Germanic or to the North Germanic branch.
The West Germanic group is the larger by far, further subdivided into Anglo-Frisian on one hand and Continental West Germanic on the other. Anglo-Frisian notably includes English and all its variants, while Continental West Germanic includes German (standard register and dialects), as well as Dutch (standard register and dialects). East Germanic includes most notably the extinct Gothic and Crimean Gothic languages.

Modern classification looks like this. For a full classification, see List of Germanic languages.

==Writing==
The earliest evidence of Germanic languages comes from names recorded in the 1st century by Tacitus (especially from his work &quot;Germania&quot;), but the earliest Germanic writing occurs in a single instance in the 2nd century BC on the Negau helmet.

From roughly the 2nd century AD, certain speakers of early Germanic varieties developed the Elder Futhark, an early form of the runic alphabet. Early runic inscriptions also are largely limited to personal names and difficult to interpret. The Gothic language was written in the Gothic alphabet developed by Bishop Ulfilas for his translation of the Bible in the 4th century. Later, Christian priests and monks who spoke and read Latin in addition to their native Germanic varieties began writing the Germanic languages with slightly modified Latin letters. However, throughout the Viking Age, runic alphabets remained in common use in Scandinavia.

Modern Germanic languages mostly use an alphabet derived from the Latin Alphabet. In print, German used to be predominately set in blackletter typefaces (e.g., fraktur or schwabacher) until the 1940s, while &quot;Kurrent&quot; and, since the early 20th century, &quot;S√ºtterlin&quot; were formerly used for German handwriting. Yiddish is written using an adapted Hebrew alphabet.

<text>German (, ) is a West Germanic language in the Indo-European language family, mainly spoken in Western and Central Europe. It is the most spoken native language within the European Union. It is the most widely spoken and official (or co-official) language in Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Liechtenstein, and the Italian autonomous province of South Tyrol. It is also an official language of Luxembourg, Belgium and the Italian autonomous region of Friuli-Venezia Giulia, as well as a recognized national language in Namibia. There are also notable German-speaking communities in France (Alsace), the Czech Republic (North Bohemia), Poland (Upper Silesia), Slovakia (Ko≈°ice Region, Spi≈°, and Hauerland), Denmark (North Schleswig), Romania and Hungary (Sopron). Overseas, sizeable communities of German-speakers are found in Brazil (Blumenau and Pomerode), South Africa (Kroondal), Namibia, among others, some communities have decidedly Austrian German or Swiss German characters (e.g. Pozuzo, Peru).

German is one of the major languages of the world. German is the second-most widely spoken Germanic language, after English, both as a first and as a second language. German is also widely taught as a foreign language, especially in continental Europe (where it is the third most taught foreign language after English and French), and in the United States. Overall, German is the fourth most commonly learned second language, and the third most commonly learned second language in the United States in K-12 education. The language has been influential in the fields of philosophy, theology, science, and technology. It is the second most commonly used language in science and the third most widely used language on websites. The German-speaking countries are ranked fifth in terms of annual publication of new books, with one-tenth of all books (including e-books) in the world being published in German.

German is most closely related to other West Germanic languages, namely Afrikaans, Dutch, English, the Frisian languages, and Scots. It also contains close similarities in vocabulary to some languages in the North Germanic group, such as Danish, Norwegian, and Swedish. Modern German gradually developed from Old High German, which in turn developed from Proto-Germanic during the Early Middle Ages.

German is an inflected language, with four cases for nouns, pronouns, and adjectives (nominative, accusative, genitive, dative); three genders (masculine, feminine, neuter) and two numbers (singular, plural). It has strong and weak verbs. The majority of its vocabulary derives from the ancient Germanic branch of the Indo-European language family, while a smaller share is partly derived from Latin and Greek, along with fewer words borrowed from French and Modern English. English, however, is the main source of more recent loanwords.

German is a pluricentric language; the three standardized variants are German, Austrian, and Swiss Standard German. Standard German is sometimes called &quot;High German&quot;, which refers to its regional origin. German is also notable for its broad spectrum of dialects, with many varieties existing in Europe and other parts of the world. Some of these non-standard varieties have become recognized and protected by regional or national governments.

Since 2004, heads of state of the German-speaking countries have met every year, and the Council for German Orthography has been the main international body regulating German orthography.

== Classification ==

German is an Indo-European language that belongs to the West Germanic group of the Germanic languages. The Germanic languages are traditionally subdivided into three branches: North Germanic, East Germanic, and West Germanic. The first of these branches survives in modern Danish, Swedish, Norwegian, Faroese, and Icelandic, all of which are descended from Old Norse. The East Germanic languages are now extinct, and Gothic is the only language in this branch which survives in written texts. The West Germanic languages, however, have undergone extensive dialectal subdivision and are now represented in modern languages such as English, German, Dutch, Yiddish, Afrikaans, and others.

Within the West Germanic language dialect continuum, the Benrath and Uerdingen lines (running through D√ºsseldorf-Benrath and Krefeld-Uerdingen, respectively) serve to distinguish the Germanic dialects that were affected by the High German consonant shift (south of Benrath) from those that were not (north of Uerdingen). The various regional dialects spoken south of these lines are grouped as High German dialects, while those spoken to the north comprise the Low German and Low Franconian dialects. As members of the West Germanic language family, High German, Low German, and Low Franconian have been proposed to be further distinguished historically as Irminonic, Ingvaeonic, and Istvaeonic, respectively. This classification indicates their historical descent from dialects spoken by the Irminones (also known as the Elbe group), Ingvaeones (or North Sea Germanic group), and Istvaeones (or Weser‚ÄìRhine group).

Standard German is based on a combination of Thuringian-Upper Saxon and Upper Franconian dialects, which are Central German and Upper German dialects belonging to the High German dialect group. German is therefore closely related to the other languages based on High German dialects, such as Luxembourgish (based on Central Franconian dialects) and Yiddish. Also closely related to Standard German are the Upper German dialects spoken in the southern German-speaking countries, such as Swiss German (Alemannic dialects) and the various Germanic dialects spoken in the French region of Grand Est, such as Alsatian (mainly Alemannic, but also CentralandUpper Franconian dialects) and Lorraine Franconian (Central Franconian).

After these High German dialects, standard German is less closely related to languages based on Low Franconian dialects (e.g., Dutch and Afrikaans), Low German or Low Saxon dialects (spoken in northern Germany and southern Denmark), neither of which underwent the High German consonant shift. As has been noted, the former of these dialect types is Istvaeonic and the latter Ingvaeonic, whereas the High German dialects are all Irminonic; the differences between these languages and standard German are therefore considerable. Also related to German are the Frisian languages‚ÄîNorth Frisian (spoken in Nordfriesland), Saterland Frisian (spoken in Saterland), and West Frisian (spoken in Friesland)‚Äîas well as the Anglic languages of English and Scots. These Anglo-Frisian dialects did not take part in the High German consonant shift, and the Anglic languages also adopted much vocabulary from both Old Norse and the Norman language.

== History ==
=== Old High German ===
The history of the German language begins with the High German consonant shift during the Migration Period, which separated Old High German dialects from Old Saxon. This sound shift involved a drastic change in the pronunciation of both voiced and voiceless stop consonants (&quot;b&quot;, &quot;d&quot;, &quot;g&quot;, and &quot;p&quot;, &quot;t&quot;, &quot;k&quot;, respectively). The primary effects of the shift were the following below.
* Voiceless stops became long (geminated) voiceless fricatives following a vowel;
* Voiceless stops became affricates in word-initial position, or following certain consonants;
* Voiced stops became voiceless in certain phonetic settings.


While there is written evidence of the Old High German language in several Elder Futhark inscriptions from as early as the sixth century AD (such as the Pforzen buckle), the Old High German period is generally seen as beginning with the &quot;Abrogans&quot; (written ), a Latin-German glossary supplying over 3,000 Old High German words with their Latin equivalents. After the &quot;Abrogans&quot;, the first coherent works written in Old High German appear in the ninth century, chief among them being the &quot;Muspilli&quot;, Merseburg charms, and &#x27;, and other religious texts (the &quot;Georgslied&quot;, &quot;Ludwigslied&quot;, &quot;Evangelienbuch&quot;, and translated hymns and prayers). The &quot;Muspilli&quot; is a Christian poem written in a Bavarian dialect offering an account of the soul after the Last Judgment, and the Merseburg charms are transcriptions of spells and charms from the pagan Germanic tradition. Of particular interest to scholars, however, has been the &#x27;, a secular epic poem telling the tale of an estranged father and son unknowingly meeting each other in battle. Linguistically, this text is highly interesting due to the mixed use of Old Saxon and Old High German dialects in its composition. The written works of this period stem mainly from the Alamanni, Bavarian, and Thuringian groups, all belonging to the Elbe Germanic group (Irminones), which had settled in what is now southern-central Germany and Austria between the second and sixth centuries, during the great migration.

In general, the surviving texts of Old High German (OHG) show a wide range of dialectal diversity with very little written uniformity. The early written tradition of OHG survived mostly through monasteries and scriptoria as local translations of Latin originals; as a result, the surviving texts are written in highly disparate regional dialects and exhibit significant Latin influence, particularly in vocabulary. At this point monasteries, where most written works were produced, were dominated by Latin, and German saw only occasional use in official and ecclesiastical writing.

===Middle High German===
While there is no complete agreement over the dates of the Middle High German (MHG) period, it is generally seen as lasting from 1050 to 1350. This was a period of significant expansion of the geographical territory occupied by Germanic tribes, and consequently of the number of German speakers. Whereas during the Old High German period the Germanic tribes extended only as far east as the Elbe and Saale rivers, the MHG period saw a number of these tribes expanding beyond this eastern boundary into Slavic territory (known as the &#x27;). With the increasing wealth and geographic spread of the Germanic groups came greater use of German in the courts of nobles as the standard language of official proceedings and literature. A clear example of this is the &#x27; employed in the Hohenstaufen court in Swabia as a standardized supra-dialectal written language. While these efforts were still regionally bound, German began to be used in place of Latin for certain official purposes, leading to a greater need for regularity in written conventions.

While the major changes of the MHG period were socio-cultural, High German was still undergoing significant linguistic changes in syntax, phonetics, and morphology as well (e.g. diphthongization of certain vowel sounds: &#x27; (OHG &amp; MHG &quot;house&quot;)&quot;‚Üí (regionally in later MHG)‚Üí&quot; (NHG), and weakening of unstressed short vowels to schwa […ô]: &#x27; (OHG &quot;days&quot;)‚Üí&quot;&quot; (MHG)).

A great wealth of texts survives from the MHG period. Significantly, these texts include a number of impressive secular works, such as the , an epic poem telling the story of the dragon-slayer Siegfried (), and the &quot;Iwein&quot;, an Arthurian verse poem by Hartmann von Aue (), lyric poems, and courtly romances such as &quot;Parzival&quot; and &quot;Tristan&quot;. Also noteworthy is the &quot;&quot;, the first book of laws written in Middle &quot;Low&quot; German (). The abundance and especially the secular character of the literature of the MHG period demonstrate the beginnings of a standardized written form of German, as well as the desire of poets and authors to be understood by individuals on supra-dialectal terms.

The Middle High German period is generally seen as ending when the 1346‚Äì53 Black Death decimated Europe&#x27;s population.

===Early New High German===

Modern High German begins with the Early New High German (ENHG) period, which Wilhelm Scherer dates 13501650, terminating with the end of the Thirty Years&#x27; War. This period saw the further displacement of Latin by German as the primary language of courtly proceedings and, increasingly, of literature in the German states. While these states were still part of the Holy Roman Empire, and far from any form of unification, the desire for a cohesive written language that would be understandable across the many German-speaking principalities and kingdoms was stronger than ever. As a spoken language German remained highly fractured throughout this period, with a vast number of often mutually incomprehensible regional dialects being spoken throughout the German states; the invention of the printing press and the publication of Luther&#x27;s vernacular translation of the Bible in 1534, however, had an immense effect on standardizing German as a supra-dialectal written language.

The ENHG period saw the rise of several important cross-regional forms of chancery German, one being &#x27;, used in the court of the Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian I, and the other being &#x27;, used in the Electorate of Saxony in the Duchy of Saxe-Wittenberg.

Alongside these courtly written standards, the invention of the printing press led to the development of a number of printers&#x27; languages (&quot;&quot;) aimed at making printed material readable and understandable across as many diverse dialects of German as possible. The greater ease of production and increased availability of written texts brought about increased standardisation in the written form of German.

One of the central events in the development of ENHG was the publication of Luther&#x27;s translation of the Bible into High German (the New Testament was published in 1522; the Old Testament was published in parts and completed in 1534). Luther based his translation primarily on the &quot;&quot; of Saxony, spending much time among the population of Saxony researching the dialect so as to make the work as natural and accessible to German speakers as possible. Copies of Luther&#x27;s Bible featured a long list of glosses for each region, translating words which were unknown in the region into the regional dialect. Luther said the following concerning his translation method: Luther&#x27;s translation of the Bible into High German was also decisive for the German language and its evolution from Early New High German to modern Standard German. The publication of Luther&#x27;s Bible was a decisive moment in the spread of literacy in early modern Germany, and promoted the development of non-local forms of language and exposed all speakers to forms of German from outside their own area. With Luther&#x27;s rendering of the Bible in the vernacular, German asserted itself against the dominance of Latin as a legitimate language for courtly, literary, and now ecclesiastical subject-matter. His Bible was ubiquitous in the German states: nearly every household possessed a copy. Nevertheless, even with the influence of Luther&#x27;s Bible as an unofficial written standard, a widely accepted standard for written German did not appear until the middle of the eighteenth century.

===Habsburg Empire===

German was the language of commerce and government in the Habsburg Empire, which encompassed a large area of Central and Eastern Europe. Until the mid-nineteenth century, it was essentially the language of townspeople throughout most of the Empire. Its use indicated that the speaker was a merchant or someone from an urban area, regardless of nationality.

Prague () and Budapest (Buda, ), to name two examples, were gradually Germanized in the years after their incorporation into the Habsburg domain; others, like Pressburg (, now Bratislava), were originally settled during the Habsburg period and were primarily German at that time. Prague, Budapest, Bratislava, and cities like Zagreb () or Ljubljana (), contained significant German minorities.

In the eastern provinces of Banat, Bukovina, and Transylvania (), German was the predominant language not only in the larger towns‚Äîlike (Timi»ôoara), (Sibiu), and (Bra»ôov)‚Äîbut also in many smaller localities in the surrounding areas.

=== Standardization ===
In 1901, the Second Orthographic Conference ended with a (nearly) complete standardization of the Standard German language in its written form, and the Duden Handbook was declared its standard definition. Punctuation and compound spelling (joined or isolated compounds) were not standardized in the process.
The () by Theodor Siebs had established conventions for German pronunciation in theatres, three years earlier; however, this was an artificial standard that did not correspond to any traditional spoken dialect. Rather, it was based on the pronunciation of German in Northern Germany, although it was subsequently regarded often as a general prescriptive norm, despite differing pronunciation traditions especially in the Upper-German-speaking regions that still characterise the dialect of the area todayespecially the pronunciation of the ending as […™k] instead of […™√ß]. In Northern Germany, High German was a foreign language to most inhabitants, whose native dialects were subsets of Low German. It was usually encountered only in writing or formal speech; in fact, most of High German was a written language, not identical to any spoken dialect, throughout the German-speaking area until well into the 19th century. However, wider standardization of pronunciation was established on the basis of public speaking in theatres and the media during the 20th century and documented in pronouncing dictionaries.

Official revisions of some of the rules from 1901 were not issued until the controversial German orthography reform of 1996 was made the official standard by governments of all German-speaking countries. Media and written works are now almost all produced in Standard German which is understood in all areas where German is spoken.

== Geographical distribution ==


As a result of the German diaspora, as well as the popularity of German taught as a foreign language, the geographical distribution of German speakers (or &quot;Germanophones&quot;) spans all inhabited continents.

However, an exact, global number of native German speakers is complicated by the existence of several varieties whose status as separate &quot;languages&quot; or &quot;dialects&quot; is disputed for political and linguistic reasons, including quantitatively strong varieties like certain forms of Alemannic and Low German. With the inclusion or exclusion of certain varieties, it is estimated that approximately 9095 million people speak German as a first language, 1025million speak it as a second language, and 75100million as a foreign language. This would imply the existence of approximately 175220million German speakers worldwide.

German sociolinguist Ulrich Ammon estimated a number of 289 million German foreign language speakers without clarifying the criteria by which he classified a speaker.

=== Europe ===


, about 90million people, or 16% of the European Union&#x27;s population, spoke German as their mother tongue, making it the second most widely spoken language on the continent after Russian and the second biggest language in terms of overall speakers (after English), as well as the most spoken native language.

====German Sprachraum====
The area in central Europe where the majority of the population speaks German as a first language and has German as a (co-)official language is called the &quot;German &quot;Sprachraum&quot;&quot;. German is the official language of the following countries:
* Germany 
* Austria 
* 17 cantons of Switzerland
* Liechtenstein

German is a co-official language of the following countries:
* Belgium (as majority language only in the German-speaking Community, which represents 0.7% of the Belgian population)
* Luxembourg, along with French and Luxembourgish
* Switzerland, co-official at the federal level with French, Italian, and Romansh, and at the local level in four cantons: Bern (with French), Fribourg (with French), Grisons (with Italian and Romansh) and Valais (with French)
* Italy, (as majority language only in the Autonomous Province of South Tyrol, which represents 0.6% of the Italian population)

====Outside the German Sprachraum====
Although expulsions and (forced) assimilation after the two World wars greatly diminished them, minority communities of mostly bilingual German native speakers exist in areas both adjacent to and detached from the Sprachraum.

Within Europe, German is a recognized minority language in the following countries:
* Czech Republic (see also: Germans in the Czech Republic)
* Denmark (see also: North Schleswig Germans)
* Hungary (see also: Germans of Hungary)
* Poland (see also German minority in Poland; German is an auxiliary and co-official language in 31 communes)
* Romania (see also: Germans of Romania)
* Russia (see also: Germans in Russia)
* Slovakia (see also: Carpathian Germans)

In France, the High German varieties of Alsatian and Moselle Franconian are identified as &quot;regional languages&quot;, but the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages of 1998 has not yet been ratified by the government.

===Africa===
====Namibia====
Namibia also was a colony of the German Empire, from 1884 to 1915. About 30,000 people still speak German as a native tongue today, mostly descendants of German colonial settlers. The period of German colonialism in Namibia also led to the evolution of a Standard German-based pidgin language called &quot;Namibian Black German&quot;, which became a second language for parts of the indigenous population. Although it is nearly extinct today, some older Namibians still have some knowledge of it.

German remained a &quot;de facto&quot; official language of Namibia after the end of German colonial rule alongside English and Afrikaans, and had &quot;de jure&quot; co-official status from 1984 until its independence from South Africa in 1990. However, the Namibian government perceived Afrikaans and German as symbols of apartheid and colonialism, and decided English would be the sole official language upon independence, stating that it was a &quot;neutral&quot; language as there were virtually no English native speakers in Namibia at that time. German, Afrikaans, and several indigenous languages thus became &quot;national languages&quot; by law, identifying them as elements of the cultural heritage of the nation and ensuring that the state acknowledged and supported their presence in the country.

Today, Namibia is considered to be the only German-speaking country outside of the &quot;Sprachraum&quot; in Europe. German is used in a wide variety of spheres throughout the country, especially in business, tourism, and public signage, as well as in education, churches (most notably the German-speaking Evangelical Lutheran Church in Namibia (GELK)), other cultural spheres such as music, and media (such as German language radio programs by the Namibian Broadcasting Corporation). The is one of the three biggest newspapers in Namibia and the only German-language daily in Africa.

====Rest of Africa====
An estimated 12,000 people speak German or a German variety as a first language in South Africa, mostly originating from different waves of immigration during the 19th and 20th centuries. One of the largest communities consists of the speakers of &quot;Nataler Deutsch&quot;, a variety of Low German concentrated in and around Wartburg. The South African constitution identifies German as a &quot;commonly used&quot; language and the Pan South African Language Board is obligated to promote and ensure respect for it.

Cameroon was also a colony of the German Empire from the same period (1884 to 1916). However, German was replaced by French and English, the languages of the two successor colonial powers, after its loss in World War I. Nevertheless, since the 21st century, German has become a popular foreign language among pupils and students, with 300,000 people learning or speaking German in Cameroon in 2010 and over 230,000 in 2020. Today Cameroon is one of the African countries outside Namibia with the highest number of people learning German.

===North America===

In the United States, German is the fifth most spoken language in terms of native and second language speakers after English, Spanish, French, and Chinese (with figures for Cantonese and Mandarin combined), with over 1 million total speakers. In the states of North Dakota and South Dakota, German is the most common language spoken at home after English. As a legacy of significant German immigration to the country, German geographical names can be found throughout the Midwest region, such as New Ulm and Bismarck (North Dakota&#x27;s state capital), plus many other regions.

A number of German varieties have developed in the country and are still spoken today, such as Pennsylvania Dutch and Texas German.

===South America===

In Brazil, the largest concentrations of German speakers are in the states of Rio Grande do Sul (where Riograndenser Hunsr√ºckisch developed), Santa Catarina, and Esp√≠rito Santo.

German dialects (namely Hunsrik and East Pomeranian) are recognized languages in the following municipalities in Brazil: 
* Esp√≠rito Santo (statewide cultural language): Domingos Martins, Laranja da Terra, Pancas, Santa Maria de Jetib√°, Vila Pav√£o
* Rio Grande do Sul (Riograndenser Hunsr√ºckisch German is a designated cultural language in the state): Santa Maria do Herval, Cangu√ßu
* Santa Catarina: Ant√¥nio Carlos, Pomerode (standard German recognized)

In Chile, during the 19th and 20th centuries, there was a massive immigration of Germans, Swiss and Austrians. Because of that, two dialects of German emerged, Lagunen-Deutsch and Chiloten-Deutsch. Immigrants even founded prosperous cities and towns. The impact of nineteenth century German immigration to southern Chile was such that Valdivia was for a while a Spanish-German bilingual city with &quot;German signboards and placards alongside the Spanish&quot;. Currently, German and its dialects are spoken in many cities, towns and rural areas of southern Chile, such as Valdivia, Osorno, Puerto Montt, Puerto Varas, Frutillar, Nueva Braunau, Castro, Ancud, among many others.

Small concentrations of German-speakers and their descendants are also found in Argentina, Chile, Paraguay, Venezuela, and Bolivia.

===Oceania===
In Australia, the state of South Australia experienced a pronounced wave of Prussian immigration in the 1840s (particularly from Silesia region). With the prolonged isolation from other German speakers and contact with Australian English, a unique dialect known as Barossa German developed, spoken predominantly in the Barossa Valley near Adelaide. Usage of German sharply declined with the advent of World War I, due to the prevailing anti-German sentiment in the population and related government action. It continued to be used as a first language into the 20th century, but its use is now limited to a few older speakers.

As of the 2013 census, 36,642 people in New Zealand spoke German, mostly descendants of a small wave of 19th century German immigrants, making it the third most spoken European language after English and French and overall the ninth most spoken language.

A German creole named was historically spoken in the former German colony of German New Guinea, modern day Papua New Guinea. It is at a high risk of extinction, with only about 100 speakers remaining, and a topic of interest among linguists seeking to revive interest in the language.

===As a foreign language===

Like English, French, and Spanish, German has become a standard foreign language throughout the world, especially in the Western World. German ranks second on par with French among the best known foreign languages in the European Union (EU) after English, as well as in Russia, and Turkey. In terms of student numbers across all levels of education, German ranks third in the EU (after English and French) and in the United States (after Spanish and French). In British schools, where learning a foreign language is not mandatory, a dramatic decline in entries for German A-Level has been observed. In 2020, approximately 15.4million people were enrolled in learning German across all levels of education worldwide. This number has decreased from a peak of 20.1million in 2000. Within the EU, not counting countries where it is an official language, German as a foreign language is most popular in Eastern and Northern Europe, namely the Czech Republic, Croatia, Denmark, the Netherlands, Slovakia, Hungary, Slovenia, Sweden, Poland, and Bosnia and Herzegovina. German was once, and to some extent still is, a lingua franca in those parts of Europe.

===German-language media worldwide===
A visible sign of the geographical extension of the German language is the German-language media outside the German-speaking countries.
German is the second most commonly used scientific language as well as the third most widely used language on websites after English and Russian.

Deutsche Welle (German pronunciation: [Ààd…î èt É…ô Ààv…õl…ô]; &quot;German Wave&quot; in German), or DW, is Germany&#x27;s public international broadcaster. The service is available in 30 languages. DW&#x27;s satellite television service consists of channels in German, English, Spanish, and Arabic.

==Standard German==

The basis of Standard German developed with the Luther Bible and the chancery language spoken by the Saxon court, part of the regional High German group. However, there are places where the traditional regional dialects have been replaced by new vernaculars based on Standard German; that is the case in large stretches of Northern Germany but also in major cities in other parts of the country. It is important to note, however, that the colloquial Standard German differs from the formal written language, especially in grammar and syntax, in which it has been influenced by dialectal speech.

Standard German differs regionally among German-speaking countries in vocabulary and some instances of pronunciation and even grammar and orthography. This variation must not be confused with the variation of local dialects. Even though the national varieties of Standard German are only somewhat influenced by the local dialects, they are very distinct. German is thus considered a pluricentric language, with currently three national standard varieties of German: Standard German German, Standard Austrian German and Standard Swiss German. In comparison to other European languages (e.g. Portuguese, English), the multi-standard character of German is still not widely acknowledged. However, 90% of Austrian secondary school teachers of German consider German as having &quot;more than one&quot; standard variety. In this context, some scholars speak of a One Standard German Axiom that has been maintained as a core assumption of German dialectology.

In most regions, the speakers use a continuum, e.g. &quot;Umgangssprache&quot; (colloquial standards) from more dialectal varieties to more standard varieties depending on the circumstances.

===Varieties===
In German linguistics, German dialects are distinguished from varieties of Standard German.
The &quot;varieties of Standard German&quot; refer to the different local varieties of the pluricentric German. They differ mainly in lexicon and phonology, but also smaller grammatical differences. In certain regions, they have replaced the traditional German dialects, especially in Northern Germany.
* German Standard German
* Austrian Standard German
* Swiss Standard German

In the German-speaking parts of Switzerland, mixtures of dialect and standard are very seldom used, and the use of Standard German is largely restricted to the written language. About 11% of the Swiss residents speak Standard German at home, but this is mainly due to German immigrants. This situation has been called a &quot;medial diglossia&quot;. Swiss Standard German is used in the Swiss education system, while Austrian German is officially used in the Austrian education system.

==Dialects==
The German dialects are the traditional local varieties of the language; many of them are not mutually intelligible with standard German, and they have great differences in lexicon, phonology, and syntax. If a narrow definition of language based on mutual intelligibility is used, many German dialects are considered to be separate languages (for instance by ISO 639-3). However, such a point of view is unusual in German linguistics.

The German dialect continuum is traditionally divided most broadly into High German and Low German, also called Low Saxon. However, historically, High German dialects and Low Saxon/Low German dialects do not belong to the same language. Nevertheless, in today&#x27;s Germany, Low Saxon/Low German is often perceived as a dialectal variation of Standard German on a functional level even by many native speakers.

The variation among the German dialects is considerable, with often only neighbouring dialects being mutually intelligible. Some dialects are not intelligible to people who know only Standard German. However, all German dialects belong to the dialect continuum of High German and Low Saxon.

===Low German===
Middle Low German was the lingua franca of the Hanseatic League. It was the predominant language in Northern Germany until the 16th century. In 1534, the Luther Bible was published. It aimed to be understandable to a broad audience and was based mainly on Central and Upper German varieties. The Early New High German language gained more prestige than Low German and became the language of science and literature. Around the same time, the Hanseatic League, a confederation of northern ports, lost its importance as new trade routes to Asia and the Americas were established, and the most powerful German states of that period were located in Middle and Southern Germany.

The 18th and 19th centuries were marked by mass education in Standard German in schools. Gradually, Low German came to be politically viewed as a mere dialect spoken by the uneducated. The proportion of the population who can understand and speak it has decreased continuously since World War II.

===Low Franconian===

The Low Franconian dialects fall within a linguistic category used to classify a number of historical and contemporary West Germanic varieties most closely related to, and including, the Dutch language. Consequently, the vast majority of the Low Franconian dialects are spoken outside of the German language area. Low Franconian dialects are spoken in the Netherlands, Belgium, South Africa, Suriname and Namibia, and along the Lower Rhine in Germany, in North Rhine-Westphalia. The region in Germany encompasses parts of the Rhine-Ruhr metropolitan region and of the Ruhr.

The Low Franconian dialects have three different standard varieties: In the Netherlands, Belgium and Suriname, it is Dutch, which is itself a Low Franconian language. In South Africa, it is Afrikaans, which is also categorized as Low Franconian. During the Middle Ages and Early Modern Period, the Low Franconian dialects now spoken in Germany, used Middle Dutch or Early Modern Dutch as their literary language and Dachsprache. Following a 19th-century change in Prussian language policy, use of Dutch as an official and public language was forbidden; resulting in Standard German taking its place as the region&#x27;s official language. As a result, these dialects are now considered German dialects from a socio-linguistic point of view.

The Low Franconian dialects in Germany are divided by the Uerdingen line (north of which &quot;i&quot; is pronounced as &quot;ik&quot; and south of which as &quot;ich&quot;) into northern and southern Low Franconian. The northern variants comprise Kleverlandish, which is most similar to Standard Dutch. The other ones are transitional between Low Franconian and Ripuarian, but closer to Low Franconian.

===High German===

The High German dialects consist of the Central German, High Franconian and Upper German dialects. The High Franconian dialects are transitional dialects between Central and Upper German. The High German varieties spoken by the Ashkenazi Jews have several unique features and are considered as a separate language, Yiddish, written with the Hebrew alphabet.

====Central German====
The Central German dialects are spoken in Central Germany, from Aachen in the west to G√∂rlitz in the east. Modern Standard German is mostly based on Central German dialects.

=====West Central German=====
The West Central German dialects are the Central Franconian dialects (Ripuarian and Moselle Franconian) and the Rhenish Franconian dialects (Hessian and Palatine). These dialects are considered as
* German in Germany and Belgium
* Luxembourgish in Luxembourg
* Lorraine Franconian in Moselle, France
* Alsatian (in a Rhenish Franconian variant) in Alsace bossue, France
* Limburgish or Kerkrade dialect in the Netherlands.
* Transylvanian Saxon in Transylvania, Romania (considered a variant of German)
* Banat Swabian in Banat, Romania (considered a variant of German)
Luxembourgish as well as Transylvanian Saxon and Banat Swabian are based on Moselle Franconian dialects.

* Cities with more than 100,000 inhabitants in the area: Cologne, Frankfurt am Main, Bonn, Mannheim, Wiesbaden, Aachen, Mainz, Kassel, Saarbr√ºcken, Ludwigshafen am Rhein, Leverkusen, Heidelberg, Darmstadt, Offenbach am Main, Luxembourg City, Koblenz, Bergisch Gladbach, Trier, Siegen, Hanau, Kaiserslautern, the south of D√ºsseldorf, and in Romania: Cluj-Napoca (German: Klausenburg), Timi»ôoara (Temeschburg), Bra»ôov (Kronstadt), Oradea (Gro√üwardein), Arad, Sibiu (Hermannstadt) and T√¢rgu Mure»ô (Neumarkt am Mieresch).

=====East Central German=====
Further east, the non-Franconian, East Central German dialects are spoken (Thuringian, Upper Saxon, Erzgebirgisch (dialect of the Ore Mountains) and North Upper Saxon‚ÄìSouth Markish, and earlier, in the then German-speaking parts of Silesia also Silesian, and in then German southern East Prussia also High Prussian).

* Cities with more than 100,000 inhabitants in the area: Berlin, Leipzig, Dresden, Halle (Saale), Magdeburg, Erfurt, Potsdam, Chemnitz and Jena.

====High Franconian====

The High Franconian dialects are transitional dialects between Central and Upper German. They consist of the East and South Franconian dialects.

=====East Franconian=====
The East Franconian dialects are spoken in the region of Franconia. Franconia consists of the Bavarian districts of Upper, Middle, and Lower Franconia, the region of South Thuringia (those parts of Thuringia south of the Thuringian Forest), and the eastern parts of the region of Heilbronn-Franken (Tauber Franconia and Hohenlohe) in northeastern Baden-W√ºrttemberg. East Franconian is also spoken in most parts of Saxon Vogtland (in the Vogtland District around Plauen, Reichenbach im Vogtland, Auerbach/Vogtl., Oelsnitz/Vogtl. and Klingenthal). East Franconian is colloquially referred to as &quot;Fr√§nkisch&quot; (Franconian) in Franconia (including Bavarian Vogtland), and as &quot;Vogtl√§ndisch&quot; (Vogtlandian) in Saxon Vogtland.

* Cities with more than 100,000 inhabitants in the area: Nuremberg, F√ºrth, W√ºrzburg and Erlangen.

=====South Franconian=====
South Franconian is spoken in northern Baden-W√ºrttemberg and in the northeasternmost tip of Alsace (around Wissembourg) in France. In Baden-W√ºrttemberg, they are considered dialects of German, and in Alsace a South Franconian variant of Alsatian.

* Cities with more than 100,000 inhabitants in the area: Karlsruhe and Heilbronn.

====Upper German====
The Upper German dialects are the Alemannic and Swabian dialects in the west and the Austro-Bavarian dialects in the east.

=====Alemannic and Swabian=====

Alemannic dialects are spoken in Switzerland (High Alemannic in the densely populated Swiss Plateau including Z√ºrich and Bern, in the south also Highest Alemannic, and Low Alemannic in Basel), Baden-W√ºrttemberg (Swabian and Low Alemannic, in the southwest also High Alemannic), Bavarian Swabia (Swabian, in the southwesternmost part also Low Alemannic), Vorarlberg/Austria (Low, High, and Highest Alemannic), Alsace/France (Low Alemannic, in the southernmost part also High Alemannic), Liechtenstein (High and Highest Alemannic), and in the district of Reutte in Tyrol, Austria (Swabian). The Alemannic dialects are considered
* German in Baden-W√ºrttemberg and Bavarian Swabia, Germany
* Vorarlbergerisch in Vorarlberg, Austria (considered dialects of German)
* Swiss German in Switzerland and Liechtenstein
* Alsatian in Alsace, France
In Germany, the Alemannic dialects are often referred to as Swabian in Bavarian Swabia and in the historical region of W√ºrttemberg, and as Badian in the historical region of Baden.

The southernmost German-speaking municipality is in the Alemannic region: Zermatt in the Canton of Valais, Switzerland, as is the capital of Liechtenstein: Vaduz.
* Cities with more than 100,000 inhabitants in the area: Stuttgart, Z√ºrich, Augsburg, Strasbourg (Alsatian: Strossburi), Freiburg im Breisgau, Basel, Bern, Ulm, Pforzheim, Reutlingen, Winterthur and Mulhouse (Alsatian: M√¨lh√ºsa).

=====Austro-Bavarian=====

The Austro-Bavarian dialects are spoken in Austria (Vienna, Lower and Upper Austria, Styria, Carinthia, Salzburg, Burgenland, and in most parts of Tyrol), southern and eastern Bavaria (Upper and Lower Bavaria as well as Upper Palatinate), and South Tyrol. Austro-Bavarian is also spoken in southwesternmost Saxony: in the southernmost tip of Vogtland (in the Vogtland District around Adorf, Bad Brambach, Bad Elster and Markneukirchen), where it is referred to as Vogtl√§ndisch (Vogtlandian), just like the East Franconian variant that dominates in Vogtland. There is also one single Austro-Bavarian village in Switzerland: Samnaun in the Canton of the Grisons.

The northernmost Austro-Bavarian village is Breitenfeld (municipality of Markneukirchen, Saxony), the southernmost village is Salorno sulla Strada del Vino (German: Salurn an der Weinstra√üe), South Tyrol.
* Cities with more than 100,000 inhabitants in the area: Vienna, Munich, Graz, Linz, Regensburg, Salzburg, Ingolstadt, Innsbruck, Bolzano (German: Bozen) and Klagenfurt am W√∂rthersee.

==Regiolects==
* Berlinian, the High German regiolect or dialect of Berlin with Low German substrate
* Missingsch, a Low-German-coloured variety of High German.
* Ruhrdeutsch (Ruhr German), the High German regiolect of the Ruhr area.

==Grammar==
German is a fusional language with a moderate degree of inflection, with three grammatical genders; as such, there can be a large number of words derived from the same root.

===Noun inflection===
German nouns inflect by case, gender, and number:
* four cases: nominative, accusative, genitive, and dative.
* three genders: masculine, feminine, and neuter. Word endings sometimes reveal grammatical gender: for instance, nouns ending in (-ing), (-ship), or (-hood, -ness) are feminine, nouns ending in or (diminutive forms) are neuter and nouns ending in (-ism) are masculine. Others are more variable, sometimes depending on the region in which the language is spoken. And some endings are not restricted to one gender, for example: (-er), such as (feminine), celebration, party; (masculine), labourer; and (neuter), thunderstorm.
* two numbers: singular and plural.

This degree of inflection is considerably less than in Old High German and other old Indo-European languages such as Latin, Ancient Greek, and Sanskrit, and it is also somewhat less than, for instance, Old English, modern Icelandic, or Russian. The three genders have collapsed in the plural. With four cases and three genders plus plural, there are 16 permutations of case and gender/number of the article (not the nouns), but there are only six forms of the definite article, which together cover all 16 permutations. In nouns, inflection for case is required in the singular for strong masculine and neuter nouns only in the genitive and in the dative (only in fixed or archaic expressions), and even this is losing ground to substitutes in informal speech. Weak masculine nouns share a common case ending for genitive, dative, and accusative in the singular. Feminine nouns are not declined in the singular. The plural has an inflection for the dative. In total, seven inflectional endings (not counting plural markers) exist in German: .

=== Compounding ===
Like the other Germanic languages, German forms noun compounds in which the first noun modifies the category given by the second: (&quot;dog hut&quot;; specifically: &quot;dog kennel&quot;). Unlike English, whose newer compounds or combinations of longer nouns are often written &quot;open&quot; with separating spaces, German (like some other Germanic languages) nearly always uses the &quot;closed&quot; form without spaces, for example: (&quot;tree house&quot;). Like English, German allows arbitrarily long compounds in theory (see also English compounds). The longest German word verified to be actually in (albeit very limited) use is , which, literally translated, is &quot;beef labelling supervision duties assignment law&quot; [from (cattle), (meat), (labelling), (supervision), (duties), (assignment), (law)]. However, examples like this are perceived by native speakers as excessively bureaucratic, stylistically awkward, or even satirical. On the other hand, even this compound could be expanded by any native speaker.

===Verb inflection===
The inflection of standard German verbs includes:
* Two main conjugation classes: weak and strong (as in English). Additionally, there is a third class, known as mixed verbs, whose conjugation combines features of both the strong and weak patterns.
* Three persons: first, second and third.
* Two numbers: singular and plural.
* Three moods: indicative, imperative and subjunctive (in addition to infinitive).
* Two voices: active and passive. The passive voice uses auxiliary verbs and is divisible into static and dynamic. Static forms show a constant state and use the verb &quot;to be&quot; (sein). Dynamic forms show an action and use the verb &quot;to become&quot; (werden).
* Two tenses without auxiliary verbs (present and preterite) and four tenses constructed with auxiliary verbs (perfect, pluperfect, future and future perfect).
* The distinction between grammatical aspects is rendered by combined use of the subjunctive or preterite marking so the plain indicative voice uses neither of those two markers; the subjunctive by itself often conveys reported speech; subjunctive plus preterite marks the conditional state; and the preterite alone shows either plain indicative (in the past), or functions as a (literal) alternative for either reported speech or the conditional state of the verb, when necessary for clarity.
* The distinction between perfect and progressive aspect is and has, at every stage of development, been a productive category of the older language and in nearly all documented dialects, but strangely enough it is now rigorously excluded from written usage in its present normalised form.
* Disambiguation of completed vs. uncompleted forms is widely observed and regularly generated by common prefixes (&#x27; [to look], &#x27; [to see¬†‚Äì unrelated form: ]).

====Verb prefixes====
The meaning of basic verbs can be expanded and sometimes radically changed through the use of a number of prefixes. Some prefixes have a specific meaning; the prefix &#x27; refers to destruction, as in (to tear apart), (to break apart), (to cut apart). Other prefixes have only the vaguest meaning in themselves; &#x27; is found in a number of verbs with a large variety of meanings, as in (to try) from (to seek), (to interrogate) from (to take), (to distribute) from (to share), (to understand) from (to stand).

Other examples include the following:
 (to stick), (to detain); (to buy), (to sell); (to hear), (to cease); (to drive), (to experience).

Many German verbs have a separable prefix, often with an adverbial function. In finite verb forms, it is split off and moved to the end of the clause and is hence considered by some to be a &quot;resultative particle&quot;. For example, , meaning &quot;to go along&quot;, would be split, giving (Literal: &quot;Go you with?&quot;; Idiomatic: &quot;Are you going along?&quot;).

Indeed, several parenthetical clauses may occur between the prefix of a finite verb and its complement (ankommen = to arrive, er kam an = he arrived, er ist angekommen = he has arrived):
A selectively literal translation of this example to illustrate the point might look like this:
: He &quot;came&quot; on Friday evening, after a hard day at work and the usual annoyances that had time and again been troubling him for years now at his workplace, with questionable joy, to a meal which, as he hoped, his wife had already put on the table, finally home &quot;to&quot;.

===Word order===
German word order is generally with the V2 word order restriction and also with the SOV word order restriction for main clauses. For yes‚Äìno questions, exclamations, and wishes, the finite verb always has the first position. In subordinate clauses, all verb forms occur at the very end.

German requires a verbal element (main verb, modal verb or auxiliary verb as finite verb) to appear second in the sentence. The verb is preceded by the topic of the sentence. The element in focus appears at the end of the sentence. For a sentence without an auxiliary, these are several possibilities:

: (The old man gave me yesterday the book; normal order)
: (The book gave [to] me yesterday the old man)
: (The book gave the old man [to] me yesterday)
: (The book gave [to] me the old man yesterday)
: (Yesterday gave [to] me the old man the book, normal order)
: ([To] me gave the old man the book yesterday (entailing: as for someone else, it was another date))

The position of a noun in a German sentence has no bearing on its being a subject, an object or another argument. In a declarative sentence in English, if the subject does not occur before the predicate, the sentence could well be misunderstood.

However, German&#x27;s flexible word order allows one to emphasise specific words:

Normal word order:
:: The manager entered yesterday at 10 o&#x27;clock with an umbrella in the hand his office.

Second variant in normal word order:
:: The manager entered his office yesterday at 10 o&#x27;clock with an umbrella in the hand.
: This variant accentuates the time specification and that he carried an umbrella.

Object in front:
:: His office entered the manager yesterday at 10 o&#x27;clock with an umbrella in the hand.
: The object (his office) is thus highlighted; it could be the topic of the next sentence.

Adverb of time in front:
:: Yesterday entered the manager at 10 o&#x27;clock with an umbrella in the hand his office. (but today without umbrella)

Both time expressions in front:
:: Yesterday at 10 o&#x27;clock entered the manager with an umbrella in the hand his office.
: The full-time specification is highlighted.

Another possibility:
:: Yesterday at 10 o&#x27;clock entered the manager his office with an umbrella in the hand.
: Both the time specification and the fact he carried an umbrella are accentuated.

Swapped adverbs:
:: The manager entered with an umbrella in the hand yesterday at 10 o&#x27;clock his office.
: The phrase is highlighted.

Swapped object:
:: The manager entered yesterday at 10 o&#x27;clock his office with an umbrella in the hand.
: The time specification and the object (his office) are lightly accentuated.

The flexible word order also allows one to use language &quot;tools&quot; (such as poetic meter and figures of speech) more freely.

====Auxiliary verbs====
When an auxiliary verb is present, it appears in second position, and the main verb appears at the end. This occurs notably in the creation of the perfect tense. Many word orders are still possible:

: (The old man has me today the book given.)
: (The book has the old man me today given.)
: (Today has the old man me the book given.)

The main verb may appear in first position to put stress on the action itself. The auxiliary verb is still in second position.

: (Given has me the old man the book today.) The bare fact that the book has been given is emphasized, as well as &#x27;today&#x27;.

====Modal verbs====
Sentences using modal verbs as finite verbs place the infinitive at the end. For example, the English sentence &quot;Should he go home?&quot; would be rearranged in German to say &quot;Should he (to) home go?&quot; (). Thus, in sentences with several subordinate or relative clauses, the infinitives are clustered at the end. Compare the similar clustering of prepositions in the following (highly contrived) English sentence: &quot;What did you bring that book that I do not like to be read to out of up for?&quot;

====Multiple infinitives====
German subordinate clauses have all verbs clustered at the end, with the finite verb normally in the final position of the cluster. Given that auxiliaries encode future, passive, modality, and the perfect, very long chains of verbs at the end of the sentence can occur. In these constructions, the past participle formed with is often replaced by the infinitive.

: &quot;V psv perf mod&quot;
: One suspects that the deserter probably shot become be should.
: (&quot;It is suspected that the deserter probably had been shot&quot;)
: He knew not that the agent a picklock had make let
: He knew not that the agent a picklock make let had
: (&quot;He did not know that the agent had had a picklock made&quot;)

The order at the end of such strings is subject to variation, but the second one in the last example is unusual.

== Vocabulary ==
Most German vocabulary is derived from the Germanic branch of the Indo-European language family. However, there is a significant number of loanwords from other languages, in particular Latin, Greek, Italian, French, and most recently English. In the early 19th century, Joachim Heinrich Campe estimated that one fifth of the total German vocabulary was of French or Latin origin.

Latin words were already imported into the predecessor of the German language during the Roman Empire and underwent all the characteristic phonetic changes in German. Their origin is thus no longer recognizable for most speakers (e.g. , , , , from Latin , , , , ). Borrowing from Latin continued after the fall of the Roman Empire during Christianisation, mediated by the church and monasteries. Another important influx of Latin words can be observed during Renaissance humanism. In a scholarly context, the borrowings from Latin have continued until today, in the last few decades often indirectly through borrowings from English. During the 15th to 17th centuries, the influence of Italian was great, leading to many Italian loanwords in the fields of architecture, finance and music. The influence of the French language in the 17th to 19th centuries resulted in an even greater import of French words. The English influence was already present in the 19th century, but it did not become dominant until the second half of the 20th century.

Thus, Notker Labeo translated the Aristotelian treatises into pure (Old High) German in the decades after the year 1000. The tradition of loan translation revitalized in the 17th and 18th century with poets like Philipp von Zesen or linguists like Joachim Heinrich Campe, who introduced close to 300 words, which are still used in modern German. Even today, there are movements that promote the substitution of foreign words that are deemed unnecessary with German alternatives.

As in English, there are many pairs of synonyms due to the enrichment of the Germanic vocabulary with loanwords from Latin and Latinized Greek. These words often have different connotations from their Germanic counterparts and are usually perceived as more scholarly.
* ¬†‚Äì &quot;history, historical&quot;, ()
* ¬†‚Äì &quot;humaneness, humane&quot;, ()
* ¬†‚Äì &quot;millennium&quot;, ()
* ¬†‚Äì &quot;perception&quot;, ()
* ¬†‚Äì &quot;vocabulary&quot;, ()
* ‚Äì &quot;dictionary, wordbook&quot;, ()
* ‚Äì &quot;to try&quot;, ()
* ‚Äì &quot;to propose&quot;, ()

The size of the vocabulary of German is difficult to estimate. The (&quot;German Dictionary&quot;), initiated by the Brothers Grimm (Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm) and the most comprehensive guide to the vocabulary of the German language, already contained over 330,000 headwords in its first edition. The modern German scientific vocabulary is estimated at nine million words and word groups (based on the analysis of 35 million sentences of a corpus in Leipzig, which as of July 2003 included 500million words in total).

==Orthography==

Written texts in German are easily recognisable as such by distinguishing features such as umlauts and certain orthographical features, such as the capitalization of all nouns, and the frequent occurrence of long compounds. Because legibility and convenience set certain boundaries, compounds consisting of more than three or four nouns are almost exclusively found in humorous contexts. (English also can string nouns together, though it usually separates the nouns with spaces: as, for example, &quot;toilet bowl cleaner&quot;.)

In German orthography, nouns are capitalized, which makes it easier for readers to determine the function of a word within a sentence. This convention is almost unique to German today (shared perhaps only by the closely related Luxembourgish language and several insular dialects of the North Frisian language), but it was historically common in Northern Europe in the early modern era, including in languages such as Danish which abolished the capitalization of nouns in 1948, and English for a while, into the 1700s.

===Present===
Before the German orthography reform of 1996, &quot;√ü&quot; replaced &quot;ss&quot; after long vowels and diphthongs and before consonants, word-, or partial-word endings. In reformed spelling, &quot;√ü&quot; replaces &quot;ss&quot; only after long vowels and diphthongs.

Since there is no traditional capital form of &quot;√ü&quot;, it was replaced by &quot;SS&quot; (or &quot;SZ&quot;) when capitalization was required. For example, (tape measure) became in capitals. An exception was the use of √ü in legal documents and forms when capitalizing names. To avoid confusion with similar names, lower case &quot;√ü&quot; was sometimes maintained (thus &quot; instead of &quot;). Capital √ü (·∫û) was ultimately adopted into German orthography in 2017, ending a long orthographic debate (thus &quot; and &quot;).

Umlaut vowels (√§, √∂, √º) are commonly transcribed with ae, oe, and ue if the umlauts are not available on the keyboard or other medium used. In the same manner, √ü can be transcribed as ss. Some operating systems use key sequences to extend the set of possible characters to include, amongst other things, umlauts; in Microsoft Windows this is done using Alt codes. German readers understand these transcriptions (although they appear unusual), but they are avoided if the regular umlauts are available, because they are a makeshift and not proper spelling. (In Westphalia and Schleswig-Holstein, city and family names exist where the extra e has a vowel lengthening effect, e.g. &quot;Raesfeld&quot; , &quot;Coesfeld&quot; and &quot;Itzehoe&quot; , but this use of the letter e after a/o/u does not occur in the present-day spelling of words other than proper nouns.)

There is no general agreement on where letters with umlauts occur in the sorting sequence. Telephone directories treat them by replacing them with the base vowel followed by an e. Some dictionaries sort each umlauted vowel as a separate letter after the base vowel, but more commonly words with umlauts are ordered immediately after the same word without umlauts. As an example in a telephone book occurs after but before (because √Ñ is replaced by Ae). In a dictionary comes after , but in some dictionaries and all other words starting with &quot;√Ñ&quot; may occur after all words starting with &quot;A&quot;. In some older dictionaries or indexes, initial &quot;Sch&quot; and &quot;St&quot; are treated as separate letters and are listed as separate entries after &quot;S&quot;, but they are usually treated as S+C+H and S+T.

Written German also typically uses an alternative opening inverted comma (quotation mark) as in .

===Past===
Until the early 20th century, German was printed in blackletter typefaces (in Fraktur, and in Schwabacher), and written in corresponding handwriting (for example Kurrent and S√ºtterlin). These variants of the Latin alphabet are very different from the serif or sans-serif Antiqua typefaces used today, and the handwritten forms in particular are difficult for the untrained to read. The printed forms, however, were claimed by some to be more readable when used for Germanic languages. The Nazis initially promoted Fraktur and Schwabacher because they were considered Aryan, but they abolished them in 1941, claiming that these letters were Jewish. It is believed that this script was banned during the Nazi r√©gime, as they realized that Fraktur would inhibit communication in the territories occupied during World War II.

The Fraktur script however remains present in everyday life in pub signs, beer brands and other forms of advertisement, where it is used to convey a certain rusticality and antiquity.

A proper use of the long s (), ≈ø, is essential for writing German text in Fraktur typefaces. Many Antiqua typefaces also include the long s. A specific set of rules applies for the use of long s in German text, but nowadays it is rarely used in Antiqua typesetting. Any lower case &quot;s&quot; at the beginning of a syllable would be a long s, as opposed to a terminal s or short s (the more common variation of the letter s), which marks the end of a syllable; for example, in differentiating between the words (guard-house) and (tube of polish/wax). One can easily decide which &quot;s&quot; to use by appropriate hyphenation, ( vs. ). The long s only appears in lower case.

==Consonant shifts==
German does not have any dental fricatives (the category containing English ). All of the sounds, which the English language still has, disappeared on the continent in German with the consonant shifts between the 8th and 10th centuries. It is sometimes possible to find parallels between English and German by replacing the English with in German, e.g. &quot;thank&quot; ‚Üí , &quot;this&quot; and &quot;that&quot; ‚Üí and , &quot;thou&quot; (old 2nd person singular pronoun) ‚Üí , &quot;think&quot; ‚Üí , &quot;thirsty&quot; ‚Üí , etc.

Likewise, the in Germanic English words, pronounced in several different ways in modern English (as an or not at all), can often be linked to German , e.g. &quot;to laugh&quot; ‚Üí , &quot;through&quot; ‚Üí , &quot;high&quot; ‚Üí , &quot;naught&quot; ‚Üí , &quot;light&quot; ‚Üí or , &quot;sight&quot; ‚Üí , &quot;daughter&quot; ‚Üí , &quot;neighbour&quot; ‚Üí . This is due to the fact that English was historically pronounced in the same way as German (as and in an allophonic relationship, or potentially as in all circumstances as in modern Dutch) with these word pairs originally (up until around the mid to late 16th century) sounding far more similar than they do today.

==Literature==
The German language is used in German literature and can be traced back to the Middle Ages, with the most notable authors of the period being Walther von der Vogelweide and Wolfram von Eschenbach.
The , whose author remains unknown, is also an important work of the epoch. The fairy tales collected and published by Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm in the 19th century became famous throughout the world.

Reformer and theologian Martin Luther, who translated the Bible into High German (a regional group or German varieties at southern and therefore &quot;higher&quot; regions), is widely credited for attributed to the basis for the modern Standard German language. Among the best-known poets and authors in German are Lessing, Goethe, Schiller, Kleist, Hoffmann, Brecht, Heine and Kafka. Fourteen German-speaking people have won the Nobel Prize in Literature: Theodor Mommsen, Rudolf Christoph Eucken, Paul von Heyse, Gerhart Hauptmann, Carl Spitteler, Thomas Mann, Nelly Sachs, Hermann Hesse, Heinrich B√∂ll, Elias Canetti, G√ºnter Grass, Elfriede Jelinek, Herta M√ºller and Peter Handke, making it the second most awarded linguistic region (together with French) after English.

<doc id="11887" wikidata="Q9129" url="?curid=11887" title="Greek language">
<text>Greek (, ; ) is an Indo-European language, constituting an independent Hellenic branch within the Indo-European language family. It is native to Greece, Cyprus, Italy (in Calabria and Salento), southern Albania, and other regions of the Balkans, Caucasus, the Black Sea coast, Asia Minor, and the Eastern Mediterranean. It has the longest documented history of any Indo-European language, spanning at least 3,400 years of written records. Its writing system is the Greek alphabet, which has been used for approximately 2,800 years; previously, Greek was recorded in writing systems such as Linear B and the Cypriot syllabary. The alphabet arose from the Phoenician script and was in turn the basis of the Latin, Cyrillic, Coptic, Gothic, and many other writing systems.

The Greek language holds a very important place in the history of the Western world. Beginning with the epics of Homer, ancient Greek literature includes many works of lasting importance in the European canon. Greek is also the language in which many of the foundational texts in science and philosophy were originally composed. The New Testament of the Christian Bible was also originally written in Greek. Together with the Latin texts and traditions of the Roman world, the Greek texts and Greek societies of antiquity constitute the objects of study of the discipline of Classics.

During antiquity, Greek was by far the most widely spoken lingua franca in the Mediterranean world. It eventually became the official language of the Byzantine Empire and developed into Medieval Greek. In its modern form, Greek is the official language of Greece and Cyprus and one of the 24 official languages of the European Union. It is spoken by at least 13.5¬†million people today in Greece, Cyprus, Italy, Albania, Turkey, and the many other countries of the Greek diaspora.

Greek roots have been widely used for centuries and continue to be widely used to coin new words in other languages; Greek and Latin are the predominant sources of international scientific vocabulary.

==History==

Greek has been spoken in the Balkan peninsula since around the 3rd millennium BC, or possibly earlier. The earliest written evidence is a Linear B clay tablet found in Messenia that dates to between 1450 and 1350 BC, making Greek the world&#x27;s oldest recorded living language. Among the Indo-European languages, its date of earliest written attestation is matched only by the now-extinct Anatolian languages.

===Periods===

The Greek language is conventionally divided into the following periods:
* Proto-Greek: the unrecorded but assumed last ancestor of all known varieties of Greek. The unity of Proto-Greek would have ended as Hellenic migrants entered the Greek peninsula sometime in the Neolithic era or the Bronze Age.
* Mycenaean Greek: the language of the Mycenaean civilization. It is recorded in the Linear B script on tablets dating from the 15th century BC onwards.
* Ancient Greek: in its various dialects, the language of the Archaic and Classical periods of the ancient Greek civilization. It was widely known throughout the Roman Empire. Ancient Greek fell into disuse in Western Europe in the Middle Ages but remained officially in use in the Byzantine world and was reintroduced to the rest of Europe with the Fall of Constantinople and Greek migration to western Europe.
* Koine Greek (also known as Hellenistic Greek): The fusion of Ionian with Attic, the dialect of Athens, began the process that resulted in the creation of the first common Greek dialect, which became a lingua franca across the Eastern Mediterranean and Near East. Koine Greek can be initially traced within the armies and conquered territories of Alexander the Great; after the Hellenistic colonization of the known world, it was spoken from Egypt to the fringes of India. Due to the widespread use of the Greek language during this period, a set of rules had to be established for the proper dissemination of the language. It is at this point that the term Hellenism (·ºôŒªŒªŒ∑ŒΩŒπœÉŒºœåœÇ) first appears. Hellenism was used by the grammarians and Strabo to denote &quot;correct Greek&quot;. After the Roman conquest of Greece, an unofficial bilingualism of Greek and Latin was established in the city of Rome and Koine Greek became the first or second language in the Roman Empire. The origin of Christianity can also be traced through Koine Greek because the Apostles used this form of the language to spread Christianity. Because it was the original language of the New Testament, and the Old Testament was translated into it as the Septuagint, that variety of Koine Greek may be referred to as New Testament Greek or sometimes Biblical Greek.

* Medieval Greek (also known as Byzantine Greek): the continuation of Koine Greek up to the demise of the Byzantine Empire in the 15th century. &quot;Medieval Greek&quot; is a cover phrase for a whole continuum of different speech and writing styles, ranging from vernacular continuations of spoken Koine that were already approaching Modern Greek in many respects, to highly learned forms imitating classical Attic. Much of the written Greek that was used as the official language of the Byzantine Empire was an eclectic middle-ground variety based on the tradition of written Koine.
* Modern Greek (also known as Neo-Hellenic): Stemming from Medieval Greek, Modern Greek usages can be traced in the Byzantine period, as early as the 11th century. It is the language used by the modern Greeks, and, apart from Standard Modern Greek, there are several dialects of it.

===Diglossia===

In the modern era, the Greek language entered a state of diglossia: the coexistence of vernacular and archaizing written forms of the language. What came to be known as the Greek language question was a polarization between two competing varieties of Modern Greek: Dimotiki, the vernacular form of Modern Greek proper, and Katharevousa, meaning &#x27;purified&#x27;, a compromise between Dimotiki and Ancient Greek developed in the early 19th century that was used for literary and official purposes in the newly formed Greek state. In 1976, Dimotiki was declared the official language of Greece, after having incorporated features of Katharevousa and thus giving birth to Standard Modern Greek, used today for all official purposes and in education.

===Historical unity===

The historical unity and continuing identity between the various stages of the Greek language are often emphasized. Although Greek has undergone morphological and phonological changes comparable to those seen in other languages, never since classical antiquity has its cultural, literary, and orthographic tradition been interrupted to the extent that one can speak of a new language emerging. Greek speakers today still tend to regard literary works of ancient Greek as part of their own rather than a foreign language. It is also often stated that the historical changes have been relatively slight compared with some other languages. According to one estimation, &quot;Homeric Greek is probably closer to Demotic than 12-century Middle English is to modern spoken English&quot;.

==Geographic distribution==
Greek is spoken today by at least 13 million people, principally in Greece and Cyprus along with a sizable Greek-speaking minority in Albania near the Greek-Albanian border. A significant percentage of Albania&#x27;s population has knowledge of the Greek language due in part to the Albanian wave of immigration to Greece in the 1980s and &#x27;90s and the Greek community in the country. Prior to the Greco-Turkish War and the resulting population exchange in 1923 a very large population of Greek-speakers also existed in Turkey, though very few remain today. A small Greek-speaking community is also found in Bulgaria near the Greek-Bulgarian border. Greek is also spoken worldwide by the sizable Greek diaspora which has notable communities in the United States, Australia, Canada, South Africa, Chile, Brazil, Argentina, Russia, Ukraine, the United Kingdom, and throughout the European Union, especially in Germany.

Historically, significant Greek-speaking communities and regions were found throughout the Eastern Mediterranean, in what are today Southern Italy, Turkey, Cyprus, Syria, Lebanon, Israel, Palestine, Egypt, and Libya; in the area of the Black Sea, in what are today Turkey, Bulgaria, Romania, Ukraine, Russia, Georgia, Armenia, and Azerbaijan; and, to a lesser extent, in the Western Mediterranean in and around colonies such as Massalia, Monoikos, and Mainake. It was also used as the official language of government and religion in the Christian Nubian kingdoms, for most of their history.

===Official status===
Greek, in its modern form, is the official language of Greece, where it is spoken by almost the entire population. It is also the official language of Cyprus (nominally alongside Turkish) and the British Overseas Territory of Akrotiri and Dhekelia (alongside English). Because of the membership of Greece and Cyprus in the European Union, Greek is one of the organization&#x27;s 24 official languages. Greek is recognized as a minority language in Albania, and used co-officially in some of its municipalities, in the districts of Gjirokast√´r and Sarand√´. It is also an official minority language in the regions of Apulia and Calabria in Italy. In the framework of the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages, Greek is protected and promoted officially as a regional and minority language in Armenia, Hungary, Romania, and Ukraine. It is recognized as a minority language and protected in Turkey by the 1923 Treaty of Lausanne.

==Characteristics==
The phonology, morphology, syntax, and vocabulary of the language show both conservative and innovative tendencies across the entire attestation of the language from the ancient to the modern period. The division into conventional periods is, as with all such periodizations, relatively arbitrary, especially because, in all periods, Ancient Greek has enjoyed high prestige, and the literate borrowed heavily from it.

===Phonology===
Across its history, the syllabic structure of Greek has varied little: Greek shows a mixed syllable structure, permitting complex syllabic onsets but very restricted codas. It has only oral vowels and a fairly stable set of consonantal contrasts. The main phonological changes occurred during the Hellenistic and Roman period (see Koine Greek phonology for details):
* replacement of the pitch accent with a stress accent.
* simplification of the system of vowels and diphthongs: loss of vowel length distinction, monophthongisation of most diphthongs and several steps in a chain shift of vowels towards (iotacism).
* development of the voiceless aspirated plosives and to the voiceless fricatives and , respectively; the similar development of to may have taken place later (the phonological changes are not reflected in the orthography, and both earlier and later phonemes are written with œÜ, Œ∏, and œá).
* development of the voiced plosives , , and to their voiced fricative counterparts (later ), , and .

===Morphology===
In all its stages, the morphology of Greek shows an extensive set of productive derivational affixes, a limited but productive system of compounding and a rich inflectional system. Although its morphological categories have been fairly stable over time, morphological changes are present throughout, particularly in the nominal and verbal systems. The major change in the nominal morphology since the classical stage was the disuse of the dative case (its functions being largely taken over by the genitive). The verbal system has lost the infinitive, the synthetically-formed future, and perfect tenses and the optative mood. Many have been replaced by periphrastic (analytical) forms.

====Nouns and adjectives====
Pronouns show distinctions in person (1st, 2nd, and 3rd), number (singular, dual, and plural in the ancient language; singular and plural alone in later stages), and gender (masculine, feminine, and neuter), and decline for case (from six cases in the earliest forms attested to four in the modern language). Nouns, articles, and adjectives show all the distinctions except for a person. Both attributive and predicative adjectives agree with the noun.

====Verbs====
The inflectional categories of the Greek verb have likewise remained largely the same over the course of the language&#x27;s history but with significant changes in the number of distinctions within each category and their morphological expression. Greek verbs have synthetic inflectional forms for:

===Syntax===
Many aspects of the syntax of Greek have remained constant: verbs agree with their subject only, the use of the surviving cases is largely intact (nominative for subjects and predicates, accusative for objects of most verbs and many prepositions, genitive for possessors), articles precede nouns, adpositions are largely prepositional, relative clauses follow the noun they modify and relative pronouns are clause-initial. However, the morphological changes also have their counterparts in the syntax, and there are also significant differences between the syntax of the ancient and that of the modern form of the language. Ancient Greek made great use of participial constructions and of constructions involving the infinitive, and the modern variety lacks the infinitive entirely (employing a raft of new periphrastic constructions instead) and uses participles more restrictively. The loss of the dative led to a rise of prepositional indirect objects (and the use of the genitive to directly mark these as well). Ancient Greek tended to be verb-final, but neutral word order in the modern language is VSO or SVO.

===Vocabulary===
Modern Greek inherits most of its vocabulary from Ancient Greek, which in turn is an Indo-European language, but also includes a number of borrowings from the languages of the populations that inhabited Greece before the arrival of Proto-Greeks, some documented in Mycenaean texts; they include a large number of Greek toponyms. The form and meaning of many words have changed. Loanwords (words of foreign origin) have entered the language, mainly from Latin, Venetian, and Turkish. During the older periods of Greek, loanwords into Greek acquired Greek inflections, thus leaving only a foreign root word. Modern borrowings (from the 20th century on), especially from French and English, are typically not inflected; other modern borrowings are derived from Albanian, South Slavic (Macedonian/Bulgarian) and Eastern Romance languages (Aromanian and Megleno-Romanian).

==Loanwords in other languages==

Greek words have been widely borrowed into other languages, including English. Example words include: &quot;mathematics&quot;, &quot;physics&quot;, &quot;astronomy&quot;, &quot;democracy&quot;, &quot;philosophy&quot;, &quot;athletics, theatre, rhetoric&quot;, &quot;baptism&quot;, &quot;evangelist&quot;, etc. Moreover, Greek words and word elements continue to be productive as a basis for coinages: &quot;anthropology&quot;, &quot;photography&quot;, &quot;telephony&quot;, &quot;isomer&quot;, &quot;biomechanics&quot;, &quot;cinematography&quot;, etc. Together with Latin words, they form the foundation of international scientific and technical vocabulary; for example, all words ending in &quot;-logy&quot; (&#x27;discourse&#x27;). There are many English words of Greek origin.

==Classification==
Greek is an independent branch of the Indo-European language family. The ancient language most closely related to it may be ancient Macedonian, which, by most accounts, was a distinct dialect of Greek itself. Aside from the Macedonian question, current consensus regards Phrygian as the closest relative of Greek, since they share a number of phonological, morphological and lexical isoglosses, with some being exclusive between them. Scholars have proposed a Graeco-Phrygian subgroup out of which Greek and Phrygian originated.

Among living languages, some Indo-Europeanists suggest that Greek may be most closely related to Armenian (see Graeco-Armenian) or the Indo-Iranian languages (see Graeco-Aryan), but little definitive evidence has been found. In addition, Albanian has also been considered somewhat related to Greek and Armenian, and it has been proposed that they all form a higher-order subgroup along with other extinct languages of the ancient Balkans; this higher-order subgroup is usually termed Palaeo-Balkan, and Greek has a central position in it.

==Writing system==

===Linear B===
Linear B, attested as early as the late 15th century BC, was the first script used to write Greek. It is basically a syllabary, which was finally deciphered by Michael Ventris and John Chadwick in the 1950s (its precursor, Linear A, has not been deciphered and most likely encodes a non-Greek language). The language of the Linear B texts, Mycenaean Greek, is the earliest known form of Greek.

===Cypriot syllabary===
Another similar system used to write the Greek language was the Cypriot syllabary (also a descendant of Linear A via the intermediate Cypro-Minoan syllabary), which is closely related to Linear B but uses somewhat different syllabic conventions to represent phoneme sequences. The Cypriot syllabary is attested in Cyprus from the 11th century BC until its gradual abandonment in the late Classical period, in favor of the standard Greek alphabet.

===Greek alphabet===
Greek has been written in the Greek alphabet since approximately the 9th century BC. It was created by modifying the Phoenician alphabet, with the innovation of adopting certain letters to represent the vowels. The variant of the alphabet in use today is essentially the late Ionic variant, introduced for writing classical Attic in 403¬†BC. In classical Greek, as in classical Latin, only upper-case letters existed. The lower-case Greek letters were developed much later by medieval scribes to permit a faster, more convenient cursive writing style with the use of ink and quill.

The Greek alphabet consists of 24 letters, each with an uppercase (majuscule) and lowercase (minuscule) form. The letter sigma has an additional lowercase form (œÇ) used in the final position of a word:
====Diacritics====

In addition to the letters, the Greek alphabet features a number of diacritical signs: three different accent marks (acute, grave, and circumflex), originally denoting different shapes of pitch accent on the stressed vowel; the so-called breathing marks (rough and smooth breathing), originally used to signal presence or absence of word-initial /h/; and the diaeresis, used to mark the full syllabic value of a vowel that would otherwise be read as part of a diphthong. These marks were introduced during the course of the Hellenistic period. Actual usage of the grave in handwriting saw a rapid decline in favor of uniform usage of the acute during the late 20th century, and it has only been retained in typography.

After the writing reform of 1982, most diacritics are no longer used. Since then, Greek has been written mostly in the simplified monotonic orthography (or monotonic system), which employs only the acute accent and the diaeresis. The traditional system, now called the polytonic orthography (or polytonic system), is still used internationally for the writing of Ancient Greek.

====Punctuation====
In Greek, the question mark is written as the English semicolon, while the functions of the colon and semicolon are performed by a raised point (‚Ä¢), known as the &quot;ano teleia&quot; (). In Greek the comma also functions as a silent letter in a handful of Greek words, principally distinguishing (&quot;√≥,ti&quot;, &#x27;whatever&#x27;) from (&quot;√≥ti&quot;, &#x27;that&#x27;).

Ancient Greek texts often used &quot;scriptio continua&quot; (&#x27;continuous writing&#x27;), which means that ancient authors and scribes would write word after word with no spaces or punctuation between words to differentiate or mark boundaries. Boustrophedon, or bi-directional text, was also used in Ancient Greek.

===Latin alphabet===
Greek has occasionally been written in the Latin script, especially in areas under Venetian rule or by Greek Catholics. The term / applies when the Latin script is used to write Greek in the cultural ambit of Catholicism (because / is an older Greek term for West-European dating to when most of (Roman Catholic Christian) West Europe was under the control of the Frankish Empire). / (meaning &#x27;Catholic Chiot&#x27;) alludes to the significant presence of Catholic missionaries based on the island of Chios. Additionally, the term Greeklish is often used when the Greek language is written in a Latin script in online communications.

The Latin script is nowadays used by the Greek-speaking communities of Southern Italy.

===Hebrew alphabet===
The Yevanic dialect was written by Romaniote and Constantinopolitan Karaite Jews using the Hebrew Alphabet.

===Arabic alphabet===
In a tradition, that in modern time, has come to be known as Greek Aljamiado, some Greek Muslims from Crete wrote their Cretan Greek in the Arabic alphabet. The same happened among Epirote Muslims in Ioannina. This also happened among Arabic-speaking Byzantine rite Christians in the Levant (Lebanon, Palestine, and Syria). This usage is sometimes called aljamiado, as when Romance languages are written in the Arabic alphabet.

<text>A golem ( ; ) is an animated anthropomorphic being in Jewish folklore, which is created entirely from inanimate matter, usually clay or mud. The most famous golem narrative involves Judah Loew ben Bezalel, the late 16th-century rabbi of Prague. According to &quot;Moment&quot; magazine, &quot;the golem is a highly mutable metaphor with seemingly limitless symbolism. It can be a victim or villain, man or woman‚Äîor sometimes both. Over the centuries, it has been used to connote war, community, isolation, hope, and despair.&quot;

In modern popular culture, the word has become generalized, and any crude anthropomorphic creature devised by a sorcerer may be termed a &quot;golem&quot;. There may be metal golems, such as Talos, or stone golems, e.g., in &quot;Dungeons and Dragons&quot;.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;golem&quot; occurs once in the Bible, in Psalm 139:16, which uses the word (; &#x27;my golem&#x27;, &#x27;my light form&#x27;, &#x27;raw material&#x27;) to connote the unfinished human being before God&#x27;s eyes. The Mishnah uses the term to refer to someone who is unsophisticated: &quot;Seven characteristics are in an uncultivated person, and seven in a learned one&quot; ().

In Modern Hebrew, is used to mean &#x27;dumb&#x27;, &#x27;helpless&#x27;, or &#x27;pupa&#x27;. Similarly, it is often used today as a metaphor for a stupid man or other entity that serves a man under controlled conditions, but is hostile to him in other circumstances. &quot;Golem&quot; passed into Yiddish as , meaning someone who is lethargic or in a stupor.

==History==
===Earliest stories===
The oldest stories of golems date to early Judaism. In the Talmud (Tractate Sanhedrin 38b), Adam is initially created as a golem () when his dust is &quot;kneaded into a shapeless husk&quot;. Like Adam, all golems are created from mud by those close to divinity, but no anthropogenic golem is fully human. Early on, the main disability of the golem was its inability to speak. Sanhedrin 65b describes Rava creating a man (), whom he then sends to Rav Zeira. Zeira speaks to the man, but he does not answer, whereupon Zeira says, &quot;You were created by the sages; return to your dust&quot;.

During the Middle Ages, passages from the &quot;Sefer Yetzirah&quot; (&quot;Book of Formation&quot;) were studied as a means to create and animate a golem, although little in the writings of Jewish mysticism supports this belief. The earliest known written account of how to create a golem can be found in &quot;Sodei Razayya&quot; by Eleazar ben Judah of Worms, who lived in the late 12th and early 13th centuries.

It was believed that golems could be activated by an ecstatic experience induced by the ritual use of various letters of the Hebrew alphabet forming a (any one of the names of God), wherein the was written on a piece of paper and inserted in the mouth or into the forehead of the golem. In some tales (including certain stories of the Che≈Çm and Prague golems), a word such as (, &#x27;truth&#x27;) is inscribed on the golem, sometimes on its forehead. In this example, the golem could then be deactivated by removing the aleph (◊ê), thus changing the inscription from &quot;truth&quot; to &quot;death&quot; (, , &#x27;dead&#x27;).

One source credits Solomon ibn Gabirol, who lived in the 11th century, with creating a golem, possibly female, for household chores. A legend also existed claiming that Samuel of Speyer created a golem in the 12th century.

In 1625, Joseph Delmedigo wrote that &quot;many legends of this sort are current, particularly in Germany.&quot;

===The Golem of Che≈Çm===
The oldest description of the creation of a golem by a historical figure is included in a tradition connected to Rabbi Eliyahu of Che≈Çm (1550‚Äì1583).

A Polish Kabbalist, writing in about 1630‚Äì1650, reported the creation of a golem by Rabbi Eliyahu thusly: &quot;And I have heard, in a certain and explicit way, from several respectable persons that one man [living] close to our time, whose name is R. Eliyahu, the master of the name, who made a creature out of matter [Heb. &quot;Golem&quot;] and form [Heb. &quot;tzurah&quot;] and it performed hard work for him, for a long period, and the name of &quot;emet&quot; was hanging upon his neck until he finally removed it for a certain reason, the name from his neck and it turned to dust.&quot; A similar account was reported by a Christian author, Christoph Arnold, in 1674.

Rabbi Jacob Emden (d. 1776) elaborated on the story in a book published in 1748: &quot;As an aside, I&#x27;ll mention here what I heard from my father&#x27;s holy mouth regarding the Golem created by his ancestor, the Gaon R. Eliyahu Ba&#x27;al Shem of blessed memory. When the Gaon saw that the Golem was growing larger and larger, he feared that the Golem would destroy the universe. He then removed the Holy Name that was embedded on his forehead, thus causing him to disintegrate and return to dust. Nonetheless, while he was engaged in extracting the Holy Name from him, the Golem injured him, scarring him on the face.&quot;

According to the Polish Kabbalist, &quot;the legend was known to several persons, thus allowing us to speculate that the legend had indeed circulated for some time before it was committed to writing and, consequently, we may assume that its origins are to be traced to the generation immediately following the death of R. Eliyahu, if not earlier.&quot;

===The classic narrative: The Golem of Prague===

The most famous golem narrative involves Judah Loew ben Bezalel, the late 16th-century rabbi of Prague, also known as the Maharal, who reportedly &quot;created a golem out of clay from the banks of the Vltava River and brought it to life through rituals and Hebrew incantations to defend the Prague ghetto from antisemitic attacks and pogroms&quot;. Depending on the version of the legend, the Jews in Prague were to be either expelled or killed under the rule of Rudolf II, the Holy Roman Emperor. The Golem was called Josef and was known as Yossele. He was said to be able to make himself invisible and summon spirits from the dead. Rabbi Loew deactivated the Golem on Friday evenings by removing the &quot;shem&quot; before the Sabbath (Saturday) began, so as to let it rest on Sabbath.

One Friday evening, Rabbi Loew forgot to remove the &quot;shem&quot;, and feared that the Golem would desecrate the Sabbath. A different story tells of a golem that fell in love, and when rejected, became the violent monster seen in most accounts. Some versions have the golem eventually going on a murderous rampage. The rabbi then managed to pull the &quot;shem&quot; from his mouth and immobilize him in front of the synagogue, whereupon the golem fell in pieces. The Golem&#x27;s body was stored in the attic &quot;genizah&quot; of the Old New Synagogue, where it would be restored to life again if needed.

Rabbi Loew then forbade anyone except his successors from going into the attic. Rabbi Yechezkel Landau, a successor of Rabbi Loew, reportedly wanted to go up the steps to the attic when he was Chief Rabbi of Prague to verify the tradition. Rabbi Landau fasted and immersed himself in a mikveh, wrapped himself in phylacteries and a prayer-shawl and started ascending the steps. At the top of the steps, he hesitated and then came immediately back down, trembling and frightened. He then re-enacted Rabbi Loew&#x27;s original warning.

According to legend, the body of Rabbi Loew&#x27;s Golem still lies in the synagogue&#x27;s attic. When the attic was renovated in 1883, no evidence of the Golem was found. Some versions of the tale state that the Golem was stolen from the &quot;genizah&quot; and entombed in a graveyard in Prague&#x27;s ≈Ωi≈ækov district, where the ≈Ωi≈ækov Television Tower now stands. A recent legend tells of a Nazi agent ascending to the synagogue attic, dying under suspicious circumstances thereafter. The attic is not open to the general public.

Some Orthodox Jews believe that the Maharal did actually create a golem. The evidence for this belief has been analyzed from an Orthodox Jewish perspective by Shnayer Z. Leiman.

===Sources of the Prague narrative===
The general view of historians and critics is that the story of the Golem of Prague was a German literary invention of the early 19th century. According to John Neubauer, the first writers on the Prague Golem were:
* 1837: Berthold Auerbach, &quot;Spinoza&quot;
* 1841: Gustav Philippson, &quot;Der Golam, eine Legende&quot;
* 1841: Franz Klutschak, &quot;Der Golam des Rabbi L√∂w&quot;
* 1842: Adam Tendlau &quot;Der Golem des Hoch-Rabbi-L√∂w&quot;
* 1847: Leopold Weisel, &quot;Der Golem&quot;

A few slightly earlier examples are known, in 1834 and 1836.

All of these early accounts of the Golem of Prague are in German by Jewish writers. They are suggested to have emerged as part of a Jewish folklore movement parallel with the contemporary German folklore movement.

The origins of the story have been obscured by attempts to exaggerate its age and to pretend that it dates from the time of the Maharal. Rabbi Yudel Rosenberg (1859‚Äì1935) of Tar≈Ç√≥w, before moving to Canada where he became one of its most prominent rabbis, is said to have originated the idea that the narrative dates from the time of the Maharal. Rosenberg published &quot;Nifl&#x27;os Maharal&quot; (&quot;Wonders of Maharal&quot;) (Piotrk√≥w, 1909), which purported to be an eyewitness account by the Maharal&#x27;s son-in-law, who had helped to create the Golem.

Rosenberg claimed that the book was based upon a manuscript that he found in the main library in Metz. &quot;Wonders of Maharal&quot; &quot;is generally recognized in academic circles to be a literary hoax&quot;. Gershom Sholem observed that the manuscript &quot;contains not ancient legends, but modern fiction&quot;. Rosenberg&#x27;s claim was further disseminated in Chayim Bloch&#x27;s (1881‚Äì1973) &quot;The Golem: Legends of the Ghetto of Prague&quot;, English edition 1925.

The &quot;Jewish Encyclopedia&quot; of 1906 cites the historical work &quot;Zemach David&quot; by David Gans, a disciple of the Maharal, published in 1592. In it, Gans writes of an audience between the Maharal and Rudolph II: &quot;Our lord the emperor¬†... Rudolph¬†... sent for and called upon our master Rabbi Low ben Bezalel and received him with a welcome and merry expression, and spoke to him face to face, as one would to a friend. The nature and quality of their words are mysterious, sealed, and hidden.&quot;

But it has been said of this passage, &quot;Even when [the Maharal is] eulogized, whether in David Gans&#x27; &quot;Zemach David&quot; or on his epitaph¬†..., not a word is said about the creation of a golem. No Hebrew work published in the 16th, 17th, and 18th centuries (even in Prague) is aware that the Maharal created a golem.&quot; Furthermore, the Maharal himself did not refer to the Golem in his writings. Rabbi Yedidiah Tiah Weil (1721‚Äì1805), a Prague resident, who described the creation of golems, including those created by Rabbis Avigdor Kara of Prague (died 1439) and Eliyahu of Chelm, did not mention the Maharal. Rabbi Meir Perils&#x27; biography of the Maharal published in 1718 does not mention a golem.

==The Golem of Vilna==
A similar tradition relates to the Vilna Gaon or &quot;the saintly genius from Vilnius&quot; (1720‚Äì1797). Rabbi Chaim Volozhin (Lithuania 1749‚Äì1821) reported in an introduction to &quot;Sifra de Tzeniuta&quot; that he once presented to his teacher, the Vilna Gaon, ten different versions of a certain passage in the &quot;Sefer Yetzira&quot; and asked the Gaon to determine the correct text. The Gaon immediately identified one version as the accurate rendition of the passage.

The amazed student then commented to his teacher that, with such clarity, he should easily be able to create a live human. The Gaon affirmed Rabbi Chaim&#x27;s assertion and said that he once began to create a person when he was a child, under the age of 13, but during the process, he received a sign from Heaven ordering him to desist because of his tender age.

==Theme of hubris==
The existence of a golem is sometimes a mixed blessing. Golems are not intelligent; if commanded to perform a task, they will perform the instructions literally. In many depictions, golems are inherently perfectly obedient. In its earliest known modern form, the Golem of Che≈Çm became enormous and uncooperative. In one version of this story, the rabbi had to resort to trickery to deactivate it, whereupon it crumbled upon its creator and crushed him.

A similar theme of hubris is seen in &quot;Frankenstein&quot;, &quot;The Sorcerer&#x27;s Apprentice&quot;, and some other stories in popular culture, such as &quot;The Terminator&quot;. The theme manifests itself in &quot;R.U.R.&quot; (&quot;Rossum&#x27;s Universal Robots&quot;), Karel ƒåapek&#x27;s 1921 play that coined the term robot. The play was written in Prague, and while ƒåapek denied that he modeled the robot after the golem, many similarities are seen in the plot.

==Culture of the Czech Republic==
The golem is a popular figure in the Czech Republic. The 1915 novel by Gustav Meyrink (&quot;The Golem&quot;) was briefly popular and did much to keep the imagination about the golem going. Several restaurants and other businesses have names that make reference to the creature. A Czech strongman, Ren√© Richter goes by the nickname &quot;Golem&quot;, and a Czech monster truck outfit calls itself the &quot;Golem Team&quot;.

Abraham Akkerman preceded his article on human automatism in the contemporary city with a short satirical poem on a pair of golems turning human.

==Clay Boy variation==
A Yiddish and Slavic folktale is the Clay Boy, which combines elements of the golem and &quot;The Gingerbread Man&quot;, in which a lonely couple makes a child out of clay, with disastrous or comical consequences.

In one common Russian version, an older couple, whose children have left home, make a boy out of clay and dry him by their hearth. The Clay Boy (, ) comes to life; at first, the couple is delighted and treats him like a real child, but the Clay Boy does not stop growing and eats all their food, then all their livestock, and then the Clay Boy eats his parents. The Clay Boy rampages through the village until he is smashed by a quick-thinking goat.

== Golem in popular culture ==
In popular culture, the term &quot;golem&quot; is often used to refer to any magically created human figure&quot; rather than specifically &quot;a humanoid formed by Kabbalistic means&quot;.
=== Film and television ===
Golems are frequently depicted in movies and television shows. Programs with them in the title include:

===Literature===
* &quot;El Golem&quot; is a poem by Jorge Luis Borges, published in 1959, and later published as part of the 1964 book &quot;El otro, el mismo&quot; (&quot;The other, the self&quot;). The poem tells the story of Judah Loew and his creation of the Golem. In the poem, Borges quotes the works of German Jewish philosopher Gershom Scholem and &quot;Cratylus&quot; by Plato.
* Marge Piercy&#x27;s 1991 science fiction novel, &quot;He, She, and It&quot;, features intertwined narratives, one of which is a retelling of the story of Rabbi Loew and his creation of a golem in medieval Prague.
* Terry Pratchett&#x27;s 1996 Discworld novel &quot;Feet of Clay&quot; feature a number of golems who reside in the city of Ankh-Morpork. Golems also appear in &quot;Going Postal&quot; and &quot;Making Money&quot; and make cameos throughout the remainder of the series.
* Ted Chiang&#x27;s 2000 novella ‚ÄúSeventy-Two Letters‚Äù focuses on an alternate history of the world where science and technology are based on the use of golems and, accordingly, the Kabbalistic names embedded in them.
* Michael Chabon&#x27;s 2000 novel &quot;The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier &amp; Clay&quot; features a story of a Golem like creature that is shipped to the United States. 
* The 2004 book &quot;The Golem&#x27;s Eye&quot; by Jonathan Stroud features a magically rendered golem as the main threat.

* Brandon Mull&#x27;s 2006 book series &quot;Fablehaven&quot; prominently contains a golem character, one which is more faithful to traditional portrayals through its depiction as a protector of the community.
* Catherynne M. Valente‚Äôs novel &quot;The Girl Who Circumnavigated Fairyland&quot; and later books in the series feature a golem made of soap, Lye, as a recurring character.
* The Marvel Comics superhero, Captain America, as the character&#x27;s creators, Joe Simon and Jack Kirby, originally conceived of him, has been described as a variant of the Golem concept: a protector of the Jewish community created by one of its elders (Dr. Abraham Erskine).
* &quot;The Golem and the Jinni&quot; is a debut novel written by Helene Wecker, published by Harper in April 2013. It combines the genre of historical fiction with elements of fantasy, telling the story of two displaced magical creatures in 19th century New York City, reflecting the fate of contemporary immigrants to the USA.

===Tabletop and video games===
* Golems appear in the fantasy role-playing game &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; (first published in 1974), and the influence of &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; has led to the inclusion of golems in other tabletop role-playing games, as well as in video games. There are many varieties of golems in the game, and &quot;Backstab&quot; reviewer Philippe Tessier called the creature a &quot;classic of &quot;D&amp;D&quot;&quot;. The clay golem is based on the golem of Medieval Jewish folklore, though changed from &quot;a cherished defender to an unthinking hulk&quot;. The flesh golem is related to Frankenstein&#x27;s monster as Universal&#x27;s 1931 film, seen in e.g. being empowered by electricity, though again with the difference of being essentially an unthinking machine in the game. &quot;D&amp;D&quot;&#x27;s golems are also rooted in Gothic fiction more generally, and are typical denizens of the Ravenloft setting. The flesh golem was ranked ninth among the ten best mid-level monsters by the authors of &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons For Dummies&quot; for both 3rd and 4th edition.
* There is a golem stone enemy in the video game &quot;Dragon Warrior&quot; for the Nintendo Entertainment System.

*Golem is the name of a Pok√©mon whose body is made of rocks. Golett and Golurk are two Pok√©mon inspired by the Golem of Prague.
* A golem features prominently in &quot;The Ghost and the Golem&quot;, a 2024 Jewish historical fantasy interactive fiction game by Benjamin Rosenbaum, on the Choice of Games platform.

<doc id="11891" wikidata="Q3335" url="?curid=11891" title="George Orwell">
<text>Eric Arthur Blair (25 June 1903 ‚Äì 21 January 1950) was an English novelist, poet, essayist, journalist and critic who wrote under the pen name of George Orwell. His work is characterised by lucid prose, social criticism, opposition to all totalitarianism (both authoritarian communism and fascism), and support of democratic socialism.

Orwell is best known for his allegorical novella &quot;Animal Farm&quot; (1945) and the dystopian novel &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot; (1949), although his works also encompass literary criticism, poetry, fiction and polemical journalism. His non-fiction works, including &quot;The Road to Wigan Pier&quot; (1937), documenting his experience of working-class life in the industrial north of England, and &quot;Homage to Catalonia&quot; (1938), an account of his experiences soldiering for the Republican faction of the Spanish Civil War (1936‚Äì1939), are as critically respected as his essays on politics, literature, language and culture.

Orwell&#x27;s work remains influential in popular culture and in political culture, and the adjective &quot;Orwellian&quot;‚Äîdescribing totalitarian and authoritarian social practices‚Äîis part of the English language, like many of his neologisms, such as &quot;Big Brother&quot;, &quot;Thought Police&quot;, &quot;Room 101&quot;, &quot;Newspeak&quot;, &quot;memory hole&quot;, &quot;doublethink&quot;, and &quot;thoughtcrime&quot;. In 2008, &quot;The Times&quot; named Orwell the second-greatest British writer since 1945.

==Life==

===Early years===
Eric Arthur Blair was born on 25 June 1903 in Motihari, Bengal Presidency (now Bihar), British India, into what he described as a &quot;lower-upper-middle class&quot; family. His great-great-grandfather, Charles Blair, was a wealthy slaveowning country gentleman and absentee owner of two Jamaican plantations; hailing from Dorset, he married Lady Mary Fane, daughter of the 8th Earl of Westmorland. His grandfather, Thomas Richard Arthur Blair, was an Anglican clergyman. Orwell&#x27;s father was Richard Walmesley Blair, who worked as a Sub-Deputy Opium Agent in the Opium Department of the Indian Civil Service, overseeing the production and storage of opium for sale to China. His mother, Ida Mabel Blair (&quot;n√©e&quot; Limouzin), grew up in Moulmein, Burma, where her French father was involved in speculative ventures. Eric had two sisters: Marjorie, five years older; and Avril, five years younger. When Eric was one year old, his mother took him and Marjorie to England. In 2014 restoration work began on Orwell&#x27;s birthplace and ancestral house in Motihari.
In 1904, Ida settled with her children at Henley-on-Thames in Oxfordshire. Eric was brought up in the company of his mother and sisters and, apart from a brief visit in mid-1907, he did not see his father until 1912. Aged five, Eric was sent as a day student to a convent school in Henley-on-Thames. It was a Catholic convent run by French Ursuline nuns. His mother wanted him to have a public school education, but his family could not afford it. Through the social connections of Ida&#x27;s brother Charles Limouzin, Blair gained a scholarship to St Cyprian&#x27;s School in Eastbourne, East Sussex. Arriving in September 1911, he boarded for the next five years, returning home only for holidays. Although he knew nothing of the reduced fees, he &quot;soon recognised that he was from a poorer home&quot;. Blair hated the school and many years later wrote an essay &quot;Such, Such Were the Joys&quot;, published posthumously, based on his time there. At St Cyprian&#x27;s, Blair first met Cyril Connolly, who became a writer and who, as the editor of &quot;Horizon&quot;, published several of Orwell&#x27;s essays.
Before the First World War, the family moved south to Shiplake, Oxfordshire, where Eric became friendly with the Buddicom family, especially their daughter Jacintha. When they first met, he was standing on his head in a field. Asked why, he said, &quot;You are noticed more if you stand on your head than if you are right way up.&quot; Growing up together, Buddicom and Blair became idealistic adolescent sweethearts, reading and writing poetry together, and dreaming of becoming famous writers. Blair also enjoyed shooting, fishing and birdwatching with Jacintha&#x27;s brother and sister.

While at St Cyprian&#x27;s, Blair wrote two poems that were published in the &quot;Henley and South Oxfordshire Standard&quot;. He came second to Connolly in the Harrow History Prize, had his work praised by the school&#x27;s external examiner, and earned scholarships to Wellington and Eton. But inclusion on the Eton scholarship roll did not guarantee a place, and none was immediately available. He chose to stay at St Cyprian&#x27;s until December 1916, in case a place at Eton became available.
In January, Blair took up the place at Wellington, where he spent the Spring term. In May 1917 a place became available as a King&#x27;s Scholar at Eton. At this time the family lived at Mall Chambers, Notting Hill Gate. Blair remained at Eton until December 1921, when he left midway between his 18th and 19th birthdays. Wellington was &quot;beastly&quot;, Blair told Jacintha, but he said he was &quot;interested and happy&quot; at Eton. His principal tutor was A. S. F. Gow, Fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge, who gave him advice later in his career. Blair was taught French by Aldous Huxley. Steven Runciman, who was at Eton with Blair, noted that he and his contemporaries appreciated Huxley&#x27;s linguistic flair.

Blair&#x27;s performance reports suggest he neglected his studies, but he worked with Roger Mynors to produce a college magazine, &quot;The Election Times&quot;, joined in the production of other publications‚Äî&quot;College Days&quot; and &quot;Bubble and Squeak&quot;‚Äîand participated in the Eton Wall Game. His parents could not afford to send him to university without another scholarship, and they concluded from his poor results he would not be able to win one. Runciman noted he had a romantic idea about the East, and the family decided Blair should join the Imperial Police, the precursor of the Indian Police Service. For this he had to pass an entrance examination. In December 1921 he left Eton and travelled to join his retired father, mother, and younger sister Avril, who that month had moved to 40 Stradbroke Road, Southwold, Suffolk, the first of their four homes in the town. Blair was enrolled at a crammer there called Craighurst, and brushed up on his Classics, English, and History. He passed the exam, coming seventh out of the 26 who passed.

===Policing in Burma===
Blair&#x27;s maternal grandmother lived at Moulmein, so he chose a posting in Burma, then still a province of British India. In October 1922 he sailed on board SS &quot;Herefordshire&quot; to join the Indian Imperial Police in Burma. A month later, he arrived at Rangoon and travelled to the police training school in Mandalay. He was appointed an Assistant District Superintendent (on probation) on 29 November 1922, at the pay of Rs. 525 per month. After a short posting at Maymyo, Burma&#x27;s principal hill station, he was posted to the frontier outpost of Myaungmya in the Irrawaddy Delta at the beginning of 1924.

Working as an imperial police officer gave him considerable responsibility while most of his contemporaries were still at university in England. When he was posted farther east in the Delta to Twante as a sub-divisional officer, he was responsible for the security of some 200,000 people. At the end of 1924, he was posted to Syriam, closer to Rangoon. Syriam had the refinery of the Burmah Oil Company, &quot;the surrounding land a barren waste, all vegetation killed off by the fumes of sulphur dioxide pouring out day and night from the stacks of the refinery.&quot; But the town was near Rangoon, a cosmopolitan seaport, and Blair went into the city as often as he could, &quot;to browse in a bookshop; to eat well-cooked food; to get away from the boring routine of police life&quot;. In September 1925 he went to Insein, the home of Insein Prison. By this time, Blair had completed his training and was receiving a monthly salary of Rs. 740, including allowances.

Blair recalled he faced hostility from the Burmese, &quot;in the end the sneering yellow faces of young men that met me everywhere, the insults hooted after me when I was at a safe distance, got badly on my nerves&quot;. He recalled that &quot;I was stuck between my hatred of the empire I served and my rage against the evil-spirited little beasts who tried to make my job impossible&quot;.
In Burma, Blair acquired a reputation as an outsider. He spent much of his time alone, reading or pursuing non-&quot;pukka&quot; activities, such as attending the churches of the Karen ethnic group. A colleague, Roger Beadon, recalled that Blair was fast to learn the language and that before he left Burma, &quot;was able to speak fluently with Burmese priests in &#x27;very high-flown Burmese&#x27;.&quot; Blair made changes to his appearance in Burma that remained for the rest of his life, including adopting a pencil moustache. Emma Larkin writes in the introduction to &quot;Burmese Days&quot;: While in Burma, he acquired a moustache similar to those worn by officers of the British regiments stationed there. [He] also acquired some tattoos; on each knuckle he had a small untidy blue circle. Many Burmese living in rural areas still sport tattoos like this‚Äîthey are believed to protect against bullets and snake bites.

In April 1926 he moved to Moulmein, where his maternal grandmother lived. At the end of that year, he was assigned to Katha in Upper Burma, where he contracted dengue fever in 1927. Entitled to a leave in England that year, he was allowed to return in July due to his illness. While on holiday with his family in Cornwall in September 1927, he reappraised his life. Deciding against returning to Burma, he resigned from the Indian Imperial Police to become a writer, with effect from 12 March 1928. He drew on his experiences in the Burma police for the novel &quot;Burmese Days&quot; (1934) and the essays &quot;A Hanging&quot; (1931) and &quot;Shooting an Elephant&quot; (1936).

In England, he settled back in the family home at Southwold, renewing acquaintance with local friends and attending an Old Etonian dinner. He visited his old tutor Gow at Cambridge for advice on becoming a writer. In 1927 he moved to London. Ruth Pitter, a family acquaintance, helped him find lodgings, and by the end of 1927 he had moved into rooms in Portobello Road; a blue plaque commemorates his residence there. Pitter&#x27;s involvement in the move &quot;would have lent it a reassuring respectability in Mrs. Blair&#x27;s eyes&quot;. Pitter had a sympathetic interest in Blair&#x27;s writing, pointed out weaknesses in his poetry, and advised him to write about what he knew. In fact he decided to write of &quot;certain aspects of the present that he set out to know&quot; and ventured into the East End of London‚Äîthe first of the occasional sorties he would make intermittently over a period of five years to discover the world of poverty and the down-and-outers who inhabit it.

In imitation of Jack London, whose writing he admired (particularly &quot;The People of the Abyss&quot;), Blair started to explore the poorer parts of London. On his first outing he set out to Limehouse Causeway, spending his first night in a common lodging house, possibly George Levy&#x27;s &quot;kip&quot;. For a while he &quot;went native&quot; in his own country, dressing like a tramp, adopting the name P.S. Burton; he recorded his experiences of the low life for use in &quot;The Spike&quot;, his first published essay in English, and in the second half of his first book, &quot;Down and Out in Paris and London&quot; (1933).
In early 1928 he moved to Paris. He lived in the rue du Pot de Fer, a working class district in the 5th arrondissement. His aunt Ellen (Nellie) Kate Limouzin also lived in Paris (with the Esperantist Eug√®ne Lanti) and gave him social and, when necessary, financial support. He began to write novels, including an early version of &quot;Burmese Days&quot;, but nothing else survives from that period. He was more successful as a journalist and published articles in &quot;Monde&quot;, a political/literary journal edited by Henri Barbusse (his first article as a professional writer, &quot;La Censure en Angleterre&quot;, appeared in that journal on 6 October 1928); &quot;G. K.&#x27;s Weekly&quot;, where his first article to appear in England, &quot;A Farthing Newspaper&quot;, was printed on 29 December 1928; and &quot;Le Progr√®s Civique&quot; (founded by the left-wing coalition Le Cartel des Gauches). Three pieces appeared in successive weeks in &quot;Le Progr√®s Civique&quot;: discussing unemployment, a day in the life of a tramp, and the beggars of London, respectively. &quot;In one or another of its destructive forms, poverty was to become his obsessive subject‚Äîat the heart of almost everything he wrote until &quot;Homage to Catalonia&quot;.&quot;

He fell seriously ill in February 1929 and was taken to the H√¥pital Cochin, a free hospital where medical students were trained. His experiences there were the basis of his essay &quot;How the Poor Die&quot;, published in 1946 (though he chose not to identify the hospital). Shortly afterwards, he had all his money stolen from his lodging house. Whether through necessity or to collect material, he undertook menial jobs such as dishwashing in a fashionable hotel on the rue de Rivoli, which he later described in &quot;Down and Out in Paris and London&quot;. In August 1929, he sent a copy of &quot;The Spike&quot; to John Middleton Murry&#x27;s &quot;New Adelphi&quot; magazine in London. The magazine was edited by Max Plowman and Sir Richard Rees, and Plowman accepted the work for publication.

===Southwold===

In December 1929 after nearly two years in Paris, Blair returned to England and went directly to his parents&#x27; house in Southwold, a coastal town in Suffolk, which remained his base for the next five years. The family was well established in the town, where his sister Avril ran a tea-house. He became acquainted with many local people, including Brenda Salkeld, the clergyman&#x27;s daughter who worked as a gym-teacher at St Felix Girls&#x27; School. Although Salkeld rejected his offer of marriage, she remained a friend and regular correspondent for many years. He also renewed friendships with older friends, such as Dennis Collings, whose girlfriend Eleanor Jacques was also to play a part in his life.

In early 1930 he stayed briefly in Bramley, Leeds, with his sister Marjorie and her husband Humphrey Dakin. Blair was writing reviews for &quot;Adelphi&quot; and acting as a private tutor to a disabled child at Southwold. He then became tutor to three young brothers, one of whom, Richard Peters, later became a distinguished academic. His history in these years is marked by dualities and contrasts. There is Blair leading a respectable, outwardly eventless life at his parents&#x27; house in Southwold, writing; then in contrast, there is Blair as Burton (the name he used in his down-and-out episodes) in search of experience in the kips and spikes, in the East End, on the road, and in the hop fields of Kent. He went painting and bathing on the beach, and there he met Mabel and Francis Fierz, who later influenced his career. Over the next year he visited them in London, often meeting their friend Max Plowman. He also often stayed at the homes of Ruth Pitter and Richard Rees, where he could &quot;change&quot; for his sporadic tramping expeditions. One of his jobs was domestic work at a lodgings for half a crown (two shillings and sixpence, or one-eighth of a pound) a day.

Blair now contributed regularly to &quot;Adelphi&quot;, with &quot;A Hanging&quot; appearing in August 1931. From August to September 1931 his explorations of poverty continued, and, like the protagonist of &quot;A Clergyman&#x27;s Daughter&quot;, he followed the East End tradition of working in the Kent hop fields. He kept a diary about his experiences there. Afterwards, he lodged in the Tooley Street kip, but could not stand it for long, and with financial help from his parents moved to Windsor Street, where he stayed until Christmas. &quot;Hop Picking&quot;, by Eric Blair, appeared in the October 1931 issue of &quot;New Statesman&quot;, whose editorial staff included his old friend Cyril Connolly. Mabel Fierz put him in contact with Leonard Moore, who became his literary agent in April 1932.

At this time Jonathan Cape rejected &quot;A Scullion&#x27;s Diary&quot;, the first version of &quot;Down and Out&quot;. On the advice of Richard Rees, he offered it to Faber &amp; Faber, but their editorial director, T. S. Eliot, also rejected it. Blair ended the year by deliberately getting himself arrested, so that he could experience Christmas in prison, but after he was picked up and taken to Bethnal Green police station in the East End of London the authorities did not regard his &quot;drunk and disorderly&quot; behaviour as imprisonable, and after two days in a cell he returned home to Southwold.

===Teaching career===

In April 1932 Blair became a teacher at The Hawthorns High School, a school for boys, in Hayes, west London. This was a small private school, and had only 14 or 16 boys aged between ten and sixteen, and one other master. While at the school he became friendly with the curate of the local parish church and became involved with activities there. Mabel Fierz had pursued matters with Moore, and at the end of June 1932, Moore told Blair that Victor Gollancz was prepared to publish &quot;A Scullion&#x27;s Diary&quot; for a ¬£40 advance, through his recently founded publishing house, Victor Gollancz Ltd, which was an outlet for radical and socialist works.

At the end of the summer term in 1932, Blair returned to Southwold, where his parents had used a legacy to buy their own home. Blair and his sister Avril spent the holidays making the house habitable while he also worked on &quot;Burmese Days&quot;. He was also spending time with Eleanor Jacques, but her attachment to Dennis Collings remained an obstacle to his hopes of a more serious relationship.
&quot;Clink&quot;, an essay describing his failed attempt to get sent to prison, appeared in the August 1932 number of &quot;Adelphi&quot;. He returned to teaching at Hayes and prepared for the publication of his book, now known as &quot;Down and Out in Paris and London&quot;. He wished to publish under a different name to avoid any embarrassment to his family over his time as a &quot;tramp&quot;. In a letter to Moore (dated 15 November 1932), he left the choice of pseudonym to Moore and to Gollancz. Four days later, he wrote to Moore, suggesting the pseudonyms P. S. Burton (a name he used when tramping), Kenneth Miles, George Orwell, and H. Lewis Allways. He finally adopted the pen name George Orwell because &quot;It is a good round English name.&quot; The name George was inspired by the patron saint of England, and Orwell after the River Orwell in Suffolk which was one of Orwell&#x27;s favourite locations.

&quot;Down and Out in Paris and London&quot; was published by Victor Gollancz in London on 9 January 1933 and received favourable reviews, with Cecil Day-Lewis complimenting Orwell&#x27;s &quot;clarity and good sense&quot;, and &quot;The Times Literary Supplement&quot; comparing Orwell&#x27;s eccentric characters to the characters of Dickens. &quot;Down and Out&quot; was modestly successful and was next published by Harper &amp; Brothers in New York.

In mid-1933 Blair left Hawthorns to become a teacher at Frays College, in Uxbridge, west London. This was a much larger establishment with 200 pupils and a full complement of staff. He acquired a motorcycle and took trips through the surrounding countryside. On one of these expeditions he became soaked and caught a chill that developed into pneumonia. He was taken to a cottage hospital in Uxbridge, where for a time his life was believed to be in danger. When he was discharged in January 1934, he returned to Southwold to convalesce and, supported by his parents, never returned to teaching.

He was disappointed when Gollancz turned down &quot;Burmese Days&quot;, mainly on the grounds of potential suits for libel, but Harper were prepared to publish it in the United States. Meanwhile, Blair started work on the novel &quot;A Clergyman&#x27;s Daughter&quot;, drawing upon his life as a teacher and on life in Southwold. Eventually in October, after sending &quot;A Clergyman&#x27;s Daughter&quot; to Moore, he left for London to take a job that had been found for him by his aunt Nellie Limouzin.

===Hampstead===

This job was as a part-time assistant in Booklovers&#x27; Corner, a second-hand bookshop in Hampstead run by Francis and Myfanwy Westrope, who were friends of Nellie Limouzin in the Esperanto movement. The Westropes were friendly and provided him with comfortable accommodation at Warwick Mansions, Pond Street. He was sharing the job with Jon Kimche, who also lived with the Westropes. Blair worked at the shop in the afternoons and had his mornings free to write and his evenings free to socialise. These experiences provided background for the novel &quot;Keep the Aspidistra Flying&quot; (1936). As well as the various guests of the Westropes, he was able to enjoy the company of Richard Rees and the &quot;Adelphi&quot; writers and Mabel Fierz. The Westropes and Kimche were members of the Independent Labour Party, although at this time Blair was not seriously politically active. He was writing for the &quot;Adelphi&quot; and preparing &quot;A Clergyman&#x27;s Daughter&quot; and &quot;Burmese Days&quot; for publication.
At the beginning of 1935 he had to move out of Warwick Mansions, and Mabel Fierz found him a flat in Parliament Hill. &quot;A Clergyman&#x27;s Daughter&quot; was published on 11 March 1935. In early 1935 Blair met his future wife Eileen O&#x27;Shaughnessy, when his landlady, Rosalind Obermeyer, who was studying for a master&#x27;s degree in psychology at University College London, invited some of her fellow students to a party. One of these students, Elizaveta Fen, recalled Blair and his friend Richard Rees &quot;draped&quot; at the fireplace, looking, she thought, &quot;moth-eaten and prematurely aged.&quot; Around this time, Blair had started to write reviews for &quot;The New English Weekly&quot;.

In June, &quot;Burmese Days&quot; was published and Cyril Connolly&#x27;s positive review in the &quot;New Statesman&quot; prompted Blair to re-establish contact with his old friend. In August, he moved into a flat, at 50 Lawford Road, Kentish Town, which he shared with Michael Sayers and Rayner Heppenstall. The relationship was sometimes awkward and Blair and Heppenstall even came to blows, though they remained friends and later worked together on BBC broadcasts. Blair was now working on &quot;Keep the Aspidistra Flying&quot;, and also tried unsuccessfully to write a serial for the &quot;News Chronicle&quot;. By October 1935 his flatmates had moved out and he was struggling to pay the rent on his own. He remained until the end of January 1936, when he stopped working at Booklovers&#x27; Corner. In 1980, English Heritage honoured Orwell with a blue plaque at his Kentish Town residence.

===&quot;The Road to Wigan Pier&quot;===

At this time, Victor Gollancz suggested Orwell spend a short time investigating social conditions in economically depressed Northern England. The Depression had introduced a number of working-class writers from the North of England to the reading public. It was one of these working-class authors, Jack Hilton, whom Orwell sought for advice. Orwell had written to Hilton seeking lodging and asking for recommendations on his route. Hilton was unable to provide him lodging, but suggested that he travel to Wigan rather than Rochdale, &quot;for there are the colliers and they&#x27;re good stuff.&quot;

On 31 January 1936, Orwell set out by public transport and on foot. Arriving in Manchester after the banks had closed, he had to stay in a common lodging-house. The next day he picked up a list of contacts sent by Richard Rees. One of these, the trade union official Frank Meade, suggested Wigan, where Orwell spent February staying in dirty lodgings over a tripe shop. In Wigan, he visited many homes to see how people lived, went down Bryn Hall coal mine, and used the local public library to consult public health records and reports on working conditions in mines.

During this time, he was distracted by concerns about style and possible libel in &quot;Keep the Aspidistra Flying&quot;. He made a quick visit to Liverpool and during March, stayed in south Yorkshire, spending time in Sheffield and Barnsley. As well as visiting mines, including Grimethorpe, and observing social conditions, he attended meetings of the Communist Party and of Oswald Mosley (&quot;his speech the usual claptrap‚ÄîThe blame for everything was put upon mysterious international gangs of Jews&quot;) where he saw the tactics of the Blackshirts. He also made visits to his sister at Headingley, during which he visited the Bront√´ Parsonage at Haworth.
Orwell needed somewhere he could concentrate on writing his book, and once again help was provided by Aunt Nellie, who was living at Wallington, Hertfordshire in a very small 16th-century cottage called the &quot;Stores&quot;. Orwell took over the tenancy and moved in on 2 April 1936. He started work on &quot;The Road to Wigan Pier&quot; by the end of April, but also spent hours working on the garden, planting a rose garden which is still extant, and revealing four years later that &quot;outside my work the thing I care most about is gardening, especially vegetable gardening&quot;. He also tested the possibility of reopening the Stores as a village shop. &quot;Keep the Aspidistra Flying&quot; was published by Gollancz on 20 April 1936. On 4 August, Orwell gave a talk at the Adelphi Summer School held at Langham, entitled &quot;An Outsider Sees the Distressed Areas&quot;; others who spoke at the school included John Strachey, Max Plowman, Karl Polanyi and Reinhold Niebuhr.

The result of his journeys through the north was &quot;The Road to Wigan Pier&quot;, published by Gollancz for the Left Book Club in 1937. The first half of the book documents his social investigations of Lancashire and Yorkshire, including an evocative description of working life in the coal mines. The second half is a long essay on his upbringing and the development of his political conscience, which includes an argument for socialism. Gollancz feared the second half would offend readers and added a disculpatory preface to the book while Orwell was in Spain. Orwell&#x27;s research for &quot;The Road to Wigan Pier&quot; led to him being placed under surveillance by the Special Branch from 1936.

Orwell married O&#x27;Shaughnessy on 9 June 1936. Shortly afterwards, the political crisis began in Spain and Orwell followed developments there closely. At the end of the year, concerned by Francisco Franco&#x27;s military uprising, Orwell decided to go to Spain to take part in the Spanish Civil War on the Republican side. Under the erroneous impression that he needed papers from some left-wing organisation to cross the frontier, on John Strachey&#x27;s recommendation he applied unsuccessfully to Harry Pollitt, leader of the British Communist Party. Pollitt was suspicious of Orwell&#x27;s political reliability; he asked him whether he would undertake to join the International Brigades and advised him to get a safe-conduct from the Spanish Embassy in Paris. Not wishing to commit himself until he had seen the situation &quot;in situ&quot;, Orwell instead used his Independent Labour Party contacts to get a letter of introduction to John McNair in Barcelona.

===Spanish Civil War===

Orwell set out for Spain on about 23 December 1936, dining with Henry Miller in Paris on the way. Miller told Orwell that going to fight in the Civil War out of some sense of obligation or guilt was &quot;sheer stupidity&quot; and that the Englishman&#x27;s ideas &quot;about combating Fascism, defending democracy, etc., etc., were all baloney&quot;. A few days later in Barcelona, Orwell met John McNair of the Independent Labour Party (ILP) Office. The Republican government was supported by a number of factions with conflicting aims, including the Workers&#x27; Party of Marxist Unification (POUM), the anarcho-syndicalist Confederaci√≥n Nacional del Trabajo (CNT) and the Unified Socialist Party of Catalonia (a wing of the Spanish Communist Party). Orwell was at first exasperated by this &quot;kaleidoscope&quot; of political parties and trade unions. The ILP was linked to the POUM so Orwell joined the POUM.

After a time at the Lenin Barracks in Barcelona he was sent to the relatively quiet Aragon Front under Georges Kopp. By January 1937 he was at Alcubierre above sea level, in the depth of winter. There was very little military action and Orwell was shocked by the lack of munitions, food and firewood as well as other extreme deprivations. With his Cadet Corps and police training, Orwell was quickly made a corporal. On the arrival of a British ILP Contingent about three weeks later, Orwell and the other English militiaman, Williams, were sent with them to Monte Oscuro and on to Huesca.

Meanwhile, back in England, Eileen had been handling the issues relating to the publication of &quot;The Road to Wigan Pier&quot; before setting out for Spain herself, leaving Nellie Limouzin to look after The Stores. Eileen volunteered for a post in John McNair&#x27;s office and with the help of Georges Kopp paid visits to her husband, bringing him English tea, chocolate and cigars. Orwell had to spend some days in hospital with a poisoned hand and had most of his possessions stolen by the staff. He returned to the front and saw some action in a night attack on the Nationalist trenches where he chased an enemy soldier with a bayonet and bombed an enemy rifle position.

In April, Orwell returned to Barcelona. Wanting to be sent to the Madrid front, which meant he &quot;must join the International Column&quot;, he approached a Communist friend attached to the Spanish Medical Aid and explained his case. &quot;Although he did not think much of the Communists, Orwell was still ready to treat them as friends and allies. That would soon change.&quot; During the Barcelona May Days Orwell was caught up in the factional fighting. He spent much of the time on a roof, with a stack of novels, but encountered Jon Kimche from his Hampstead days during the stay. The subsequent campaign of lies and distortion carried out by the Communist press, in which the POUM was accused of collaborating with the fascists, had a dramatic effect on Orwell. Instead of joining the International Brigades as he had intended, he decided to return to the Aragon Front. Once the May fighting was over, he was approached by a Communist friend who asked if he still intended transferring to the International Brigades. Orwell expressed surprise that they should still want him, because according to the Communist press he was a fascist.
After his return to the front, he was wounded in the throat by a sniper&#x27;s bullet. At 6¬†ft 2 in (1.88 m), Orwell was considerably taller than the Spanish fighters and had been warned against standing against the trench parapet. Unable to speak, and with blood pouring from his mouth, Orwell was carried on a stretcher to Si√©tamo, loaded on an ambulance and sent to hospital in Lleida. He recovered sufficiently to get up and on 27 May 1937 was sent on to Tarragona and two days later to a POUM sanatorium in the suburbs of Barcelona. The bullet had missed his main artery by the barest margin and his voice was barely audible. It had been such a clean shot that the wound immediately went through the process of cauterisation. He received electrotherapy treatment and was declared medically unfit for service.

By the middle of June, the political situation in Barcelona had deteriorated and the POUM‚Äîpainted by the pro-Soviet Communists as a Trotskyist organisation‚Äîwas outlawed and under attack. Members, including Kopp, were arrested and others were in hiding. Orwell and his wife were under threat and had to lie low, although they broke cover to try to help Kopp. They finally escaped from Spain by train. In the first week of July 1937 Orwell arrived back at Wallington; on 13 July 1937 a deposition was presented to the Tribunal for Espionage &amp; High Treason in Valencia, charging the Orwells with &quot;rabid Trotskyism&quot;, and being agents of the POUM. The trial of the leaders of the POUM and of Orwell (in his absence) took place in Barcelona in October and November 1938. Observing events from French Morocco, Orwell wrote that they were &quot;only a by-product of the Russian Trotskyist trials and from the start every kind of lie, including flagrant absurdities, has been circulated in the Communist press.&quot; Orwell&#x27;s experiences in the Spanish Civil War gave rise to &quot;Homage to Catalonia&quot; (1938).

In his book, &quot;The International Brigades: Fascism, Freedom and the Spanish Civil War,&quot; Giles Tremlett writes that according to Soviet files, Orwell and his wife Eileen were spied on in Barcelona in May 1937.

===Rest and recuperation===
Orwell returned to England in June 1937, and stayed at the O&#x27;Shaughnessy home at Greenwich. He found his views on the Spanish Civil War out of favour, but praised the book &quot;Red Spanish Notebook: the first six months of revolution and the civil war&quot; by Juan Ram√≥n Bre√° and Mary Stanley Low in a review for &quot;Time and Tide&quot; magazine. Kingsley Martin rejected two of Orwell&#x27;s works and Gollancz was equally cautious. At the same time, the communist &quot;Daily Worker&quot; was running an attack on &quot;The Road to Wigan Pier&quot;, taking out of context Orwell writing that &quot;the working classes smell&quot;; a letter to Gollancz from Orwell threatening libel action brought a stop to this. Orwell was also able to find a more sympathetic publisher for his views in Fredric Warburg of Secker &amp; Warburg. Orwell returned to Wallington, which he found in disarray after his absence. He acquired goats, a cockerel (rooster) he called Henry Ford and a poodle puppy he called Marx; and settled down to animal husbandry and writing &quot;Homage to Catalonia&quot;.

There were thoughts of going to India to work on &quot;The Pioneer&quot;, a newspaper in Lucknow, but by March 1938 Orwell&#x27;s health had deteriorated. He was admitted to Preston Hall Sanatorium at Aylesford, Kent, a British Legion hospital for ex-servicemen to which his brother-in-law Laurence O&#x27;Shaughnessy was attached. He was thought initially to be suffering from tuberculosis and stayed in the sanatorium until September. &quot;Homage to Catalonia&quot; was published in London by Secker &amp; Warburg and was a commercial flop; it re-emerged in the 1950s, following on the success of Orwell&#x27;s later books.

The novelist L. H. Myers secretly funded a trip to French Morocco for half a year for Orwell to avoid the English winter and recover his health. The Orwells set out in September 1938 via Gibraltar and Tangier to avoid Spanish Morocco and arrived at Marrakech. They rented a villa on the road to Casablanca and during that time Orwell wrote &quot;Coming Up for Air&quot;. They arrived back in England on 30 March 1939 and &quot;Coming Up for Air&quot; was published in June. Orwell spent time in Wallington and Southwold working on a Dickens essay. In June 1939, Orwell&#x27;s father died.

===Second World War and &quot;Animal Farm&quot;===

At the outbreak of the Second World War, Orwell&#x27;s wife Eileen started working in the Censorship Department of the Ministry of Information in central London, staying during the week with her family in Greenwich. Orwell submitted his name to the Central Register for war work, but nothing transpired. He returned to Wallington, and in late 1939 he wrote material for his first collection of essays, &quot;Inside the Whale&quot;. For the next year he was occupied writing reviews for plays, films and books for &quot;The Listener&quot;, &quot;Time and Tide&quot; and &quot;New Adelphi&quot;. On 29 March 1940 his long association with &quot;Tribune&quot; began with a review of a sergeant&#x27;s account of Napoleon&#x27;s retreat from Moscow. At the beginning of 1940, the first edition of Connolly&#x27;s &quot;Horizon&quot; appeared, and this provided a new outlet for Orwell&#x27;s work and new literary contacts. In May the Orwells took lease of a flat in London at Dorset Chambers, Chagford Street, Marylebone. It was the time of the Dunkirk evacuation, and the death in Flanders, of Eileen&#x27;s brother, Laurence O&#x27;Shaughnessy, caused her considerable grief and long-term depression.

Orwell was declared &quot;unfit for any kind of military service&quot; by the Medical Board in June, but soon joined the Home Guard. He shared Tom Wintringham&#x27;s socialist vision for the Home Guard as a revolutionary People&#x27;s Militia. His lecture notes for instructing platoon members include advice on street fighting, field fortifications, and the use of mortars. Sergeant Orwell recruited Fredric Warburg to his unit. During the Battle of Britain he spent weekends with Warburg and his new Zionist friend, Tosco Fyvel, at Warburg&#x27;s house at Twyford, Berkshire. At Wallington he worked on &quot;England Your England&quot; and in London wrote reviews for periodicals. Visiting Eileen&#x27;s family in Greenwich brought him face-to-face with the effects of the Blitz. In 1940 he first worked for the BBC as a producer on their Indian Section, while the broadcaster and writer Venu Chitale was his secretary. In mid-1940, Warburg, Fyvel and Orwell planned Searchlight Books. Eleven volumes eventually appeared, of which Orwell&#x27;s &quot;The Lion and the Unicorn: Socialism and the English Genius&quot;, published in February 1941, was the first.

Early in 1941 he began to write for the American &quot;Partisan Review&quot; which linked Orwell with the New York Intellectuals who were also anti-Stalinist, and contributed to the Gollancz anthology &quot;The Betrayal of the Left&quot;, written in the light of the Molotov‚ÄìRibbentrop Pact. He applied unsuccessfully for a job at the Air Ministry. Meanwhile, he was still writing reviews of books and plays and met the novelist Anthony Powell. He took part in radio broadcasts for the Eastern Service of the BBC. In March the Orwells moved to a seventh-floor flat at Langford Court, St John&#x27;s Wood, while at Wallington Orwell was &quot;digging for victory&quot; by planting potatoes.

In August 1941, Orwell finally obtained &quot;war work&quot; when he was taken on full-time by the BBC&#x27;s Eastern Service. He supervised cultural broadcasts to India, to counter propaganda from Nazi Germany designed to undermine imperial links.

At the end of August he had a dinner with H. G. Wells which degenerated into a row because Wells had taken offence at observations Orwell made about him in a &quot;Horizon&quot; article. In October Orwell had a bout of bronchitis and the illness recurred frequently. David Astor was looking for a provocative contributor for &quot;The Observer&quot; and invited Orwell to write for him‚Äîthe first article appearing in March 1942. In early 1942 Eileen changed jobs to work at the Ministry of Food and in mid-1942 the Orwells moved to a larger flat, 10a Mortimer Crescent in Maida Vale/Kilburn.
At the BBC, Orwell introduced &quot;Voice&quot;, a literary programme for his Indian broadcasts, and by now was leading an active social life with literary friends, particularly on the political left. Late in 1942, he started writing regularly for the left-wing weekly &quot;Tribune&quot; directed by Labour MPs Aneurin Bevan and George Strauss. In March 1943, Orwell&#x27;s mother died, and around this time he told Moore he was starting work on a book, which turned out to be &quot;Animal Farm&quot;.

In September 1943, Orwell resigned from the BBC. His resignation followed a report confirming his fears that few Indians listened to the broadcasts, but he was also keen to concentrate on writing &quot;Animal Farm&quot;. On 24 November 1943, six days before his last day of service, his adaptation of the fairy tale, Hans Christian Andersen&#x27;s &quot;The Emperor&#x27;s New Clothes&quot; was broadcast. It was a genre in which he was greatly interested and which appeared on &quot;Animal Farm&quot;‚Ä≥s title page. He resigned from the Home Guard on medical grounds.

In November 1943, Orwell was appointed literary editor at &quot;Tribune&quot;, where his assistant was his friend Jon Kimche. Orwell was on the staff until early 1945, writing over 80 book reviews and on 3 December 1943 started his regular personal column, &quot;As I Please&quot;. He was still writing reviews for other magazines, including &quot;Partisan Review&quot;, &quot;Horizon&quot;, and the New York &quot;Nation&quot;. By April 1944 &quot;Animal Farm&quot; was ready for publication. Gollancz refused to publish it, considering it an attack on the Soviet regime which was a crucial ally in the war. A similar fate was met from other publishers, including T. S. Eliot at Faber &amp; Faber, until Jonathan Cape agreed to take it.

In May the Orwells had the opportunity to adopt a child, thanks to the contacts of Eileen&#x27;s sister-in-law Gwen O&#x27;Shaughnessy, then a doctor in Newcastle upon Tyne. In June a V-1 flying bomb struck Mortimer Crescent and the Orwells had to find somewhere else to live. Orwell had to scrabble around in the rubble for his books, which he had finally managed to transfer from Wallington, carting them away in a wheelbarrow. Another blow was Cape&#x27;s reversal of his plan to publish &quot;Animal Farm&quot;. The decision followed his visit to Peter Smollett, an official at the Ministry of Information. Smollett was later identified as a Soviet agent.

The Orwells spent time in the North East, near Carlton, County Durham, dealing with the adoption of a boy whom they named Richard Horatio Blair. By September 1944 they had set up home in Islington, at 27b Canonbury Square. Baby Richard joined them there, and Eileen gave up her work at the Ministry of Food to look after her family. Secker &amp; Warburg had agreed to publish &quot;Animal Farm&quot;, planned for the following March, although it did not appear in print until August 1945. By February 1945 David Astor had invited Orwell to become a war correspondent for &quot;The Observer&quot;. He went to liberated Paris, then to Germany and Austria, to such cities as Cologne and Stuttgart. He was never in the front line, under fire, but followed the troops closely, &quot;sometimes entering a captured town within a day of its fall while dead bodies lay in the streets.&quot; Some of his reports were published in the &quot;Manchester Evening News&quot;.

While he was there, Eileen went into hospital for a hysterectomy and died under anaesthetic on 29 March 1945. She had not given Orwell much notice about the operation because of worries about the cost, and because she expected to make a speedy recovery. Orwell returned home and then went back to Europe. He returned to London to cover the 1945 general election at the beginning of July. &quot;Animal Farm: A Fairy Story&quot; was published in Britain on 17 August 1945, and a year later in the US, on 26 August 1946.

===Jura and &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot;===
&quot;Animal Farm&quot; had particular resonance in the post-war climate and its worldwide success made Orwell a sought-after figure. For the next four years, Orwell mixed journalistic work‚Äîmainly for &quot;Tribune&quot;, &quot;The Observer&quot; and the &quot;Manchester Evening News&quot;, though he also contributed to many small-circulation political and literary magazines‚Äîwith writing his best-known work, &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot;, which was published in 1949. He was a leading figure in the so-called Shanghai Club (named after a restaurant in Soho) of left-leaning and √©migr√© journalists, among them E. H. Carr, Sebastian Haffner, Isaac Deutscher, Barbara Ward and Jon Kimche.

In the year following Eileen&#x27;s death he published around 130 articles and a selection of his &quot;Critical Essays&quot;, while remaining active in various political lobbying campaigns. He employed a housekeeper, Susan Watson, to look after his adopted son at the Islington flat, which visitors now described as &quot;bleak&quot;. In September he spent a fortnight on the island of Jura in the Inner Hebrides and saw it as a place to escape from the hassle of London literary life. David Astor was instrumental in arranging a place for Orwell on Jura. Astor&#x27;s family owned Scottish estates in the area and a fellow Old Etonian, Robin Fletcher, had a property on the island. In late 1945 and early 1946 Orwell made several hopeless and unwelcome marriage proposals to younger women, including Celia Kirwan; Ann Popham, who happened to live in the same block of flats; and Sonia Brownell, one of Connolly&#x27;s coterie at the &quot;Horizon&quot; office. Orwell suffered a tubercular haemorrhage in February 1946 but disguised his illness. In 1945 or early 1946, while still living at Canonbury Square, Orwell wrote an article on &quot;British Cookery&quot;, complete with recipes, commissioned by the British Council. Given the post-war shortages, both parties agreed not to publish it. His sister Marjorie died in May.

On 22 May 1946, Orwell set off to live on Jura in Barnhill, an abandoned farmhouse without outbuildings. Conditions at the farmhouse were primitive but the natural history and the challenge of improving the place appealed to Orwell. Orwell returned to London in late 1946 and picked up his literary journalism again. Now a well-known writer, he was swamped with work. Apart from a visit to Jura in the new year he stayed in London for one of the coldest British winters on record and with such a national shortage of fuel that he burnt his furniture and his child&#x27;s toys. The heavy smog in the days before the Clean Air Act 1956 did little to help his health, about which he was reticent, keeping clear of medical attention. Meanwhile, he had to cope with rival claims of publishers Gollancz and Warburg for publishing rights. About this time he co-edited a collection titled &quot;British Pamphleteers&quot; with Reginald Reynolds. As a result of the success of &quot;Animal Farm&quot;, Orwell was expecting a large bill from the Inland Revenue and he contacted a firm of accountants. The firm advised Orwell to establish a company to own his copyright and to receive his royalties and set up a &quot;service agreement&quot; so that he could draw a salary. Such a company, &quot;George Orwell Productions Ltd&quot; (GOP Ltd) was set up on 12 September 1947.

Orwell left London for Jura on 10 April 1947. In July he ended the lease on the Wallington cottage. Back on Jura he worked on &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot;. During that time his sister&#x27;s family visited, and Orwell led a disastrous boating expedition, on 19 August, which nearly led to loss of life whilst trying to cross the notorious Gulf of Corryvreckan and gave him a soaking which was not good for his health. In December a chest specialist was summoned from Glasgow who pronounced Orwell seriously ill, and a week before Christmas 1947 he was in Hairmyres Hospital. Tuberculosis was diagnosed and the request for permission to import streptomycin to treat Orwell went as far as Aneurin Bevan, then Minister of Health. David Astor helped with supply and payment and Orwell began his course of streptomycin on 19 or 20 February 1948. By the end of July 1948 Orwell was able to return to Jura and by December he had finished the manuscript of &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot;. In January 1949, in a very weak condition, he set off for a sanatorium at Cranham, Gloucestershire. Unluckily for Orwell, streptomycin could not be continued, as he developed toxic epidermal necrolysis, a rare side effect.

The sanatorium at Cranham consisted of a series of small wooden chalets or huts in a remote part of the Cotswolds near Stroud. Visitors were shocked by Orwell&#x27;s appearance and concerned by the shortcomings and ineffectiveness of the treatment. Friends were worried about his finances, but by now he was comparatively well off. He was writing to many of his friends, including Jacintha Buddicom, who had &quot;rediscovered&quot; him, and in March 1949, was visited by Celia Kirwan. Kirwan had just started working for a Foreign Office unit, the Information Research Department (IRD), set up by the Labour government to publish anti-communist propaganda, and Orwell gave her a list of people he considered to be unsuitable as IRD authors because of their pro-communist leanings. Orwell&#x27;s list, not published until 2003, consisted mainly of writers but also included actors and Labour MPs. To further promote &quot;Animal Farm&quot;, the IRD commissioned cartoon strips, drawn by Norman Pett, to be placed in newspapers across the globe. Orwell received more streptomycin treatment and improved slightly. This repeat dose of streptomycin, especially after the side effect had been noticed, has been called &quot;ill-advised&quot;. He then received penicillin, although doctors knew it was ineffective against tuberculosis. It is presumed it was given to treat his bronchiectasis. In June 1949 &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot; was published, to critical acclaim.

===Final months and death===
Orwell&#x27;s health continued to decline. In mid-1949, he courted Sonia Brownell, and they announced their engagement in September, shortly before he was removed to University College Hospital in London. She is believed to be the model for Julia, the heroine of &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot;. Sonia took charge of Orwell&#x27;s affairs and attended him diligently in the hospital. Friends of Orwell stated that Brownell helped him through the painful last months of his life and, according to Anthony Powell, cheered Orwell up greatly. However, others have argued that she may have been attracted to him primarily because of his fame.

In September 1949, Orwell invited his accountant Jack Harrison to visit him at the hospital, and Harrison claimed that Orwell then asked him to become director of GOP Ltd and to manage the company, but there was no independent witness. Orwell&#x27;s wedding took place in the hospital room on 13 October 1949, with David Astor as best man. Further meetings were held with his accountant, at which Harrison and Mr and Mrs Blair were confirmed as directors of the company. Orwell&#x27;s health was in decline again by Christmas. Jack Harrison visited later and claimed that Orwell gave him 25% of the company. 

At the age of 46, Orwell suffered a pulmonary artery rupture due to complications of tuberculosis. He died in the early morning of 21 January 1950.

Orwell had requested to be buried in accordance with the Anglican rite in the graveyard of the closest church to wherever he happened to die. The graveyards in central London had no space, and so in an effort to ensure his last wishes could be fulfilled, his widow appealed to his friends to see whether any of them knew of a church with space in its graveyard. David Astor arranged for Orwell to be interred in the churchyard of All Saints&#x27; in Sutton Courtenay. The funeral was organised by Anthony Powell and Malcom Muggeridge. Powell chose the hymns: &quot;All people that on earth do dwell&quot;, &quot;Guide me, O thou great Redeemer&quot; and &quot;Ten thousand times ten thousand&quot;.

Orwell&#x27;s adopted son, Richard Horatio Blair, was brought up by Orwell&#x27;s sister Avril, his legal guardian, and her husband, Bill Dunn.

In 1979, Sonia Brownell brought a High Court action against Harrison when he declared an intention to subdivide his 25 per cent share of the company between his three children. For Sonia, the consequence of this manoeuvre would have made getting overall control of the company three times more difficult. She was considered to have a strong case, but was becoming increasingly ill and eventually was persuaded to settle out of court on 2 November 1980. She died on 11 December 1980, aged 62.

==Literary career and legacy==
During most of his career, Orwell was best known for his journalism, in essays, reviews, columns in newspapers and magazines and in his books of reportage: &quot;Down and Out in Paris and London&quot; (describing a period of poverty in these cities), &quot;The Road to Wigan Pier&quot; (describing the living conditions of the poor in northern England, and class division generally) and &quot;Homage to Catalonia&quot;. According to Irving Howe, Orwell was &quot;the best English essayist since Hazlitt, perhaps since Dr Johnson&quot;.

Modern readers are more often introduced to Orwell as a novelist, particularly through his enormously successful &quot;Animal Farm&quot; and &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot;. The former is often thought to reflect degeneration in the Soviet Union after the Russian Revolution and the rise of Stalinism; the latter, life under totalitarian rule. In 1984, &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot; and Ray Bradbury&#x27;s &quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot; were honoured with the Prometheus Award for their contributions to dystopian literature. In 2011 he received it again for &quot;Animal Farm&quot;. In 2003, &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot; was listed at number 8 and &quot;Animal Farm&quot; at number 46 on the BBC&#x27;s The Big Read poll. In 2021, readers of the &quot;New York Times Book Review&quot; rated &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot; third in a list of &quot;The best books of the past 125 years.&quot;

===Literary influences===
In an autobiographical piece that Orwell sent to the editors of &quot;Twentieth Century Authors&quot; in 1940, he wrote: The writers I care about most and never grow tired of are: Shakespeare, Swift, Fielding, Dickens, Charles Reade, Flaubert and, among modern writers, James Joyce, T. S. Eliot and D. H. Lawrence. But I believe the modern writer who has influenced me most is W. Somerset Maugham, whom I admire immensely for his power of telling a story straightforwardly and without frills. Elsewhere, Orwell strongly praised the works of Jack London, especially his book &quot;The Road&quot;. Orwell&#x27;s investigation of poverty in &quot;The Road to Wigan Pier&quot; strongly resembles that of Jack London&#x27;s &quot;The People of the Abyss&quot;, in which the American journalist disguises himself as an out-of-work sailor to investigate the lives of the poor in London. In his essay &quot;Politics vs. Literature: An Examination of Gulliver&#x27;s Travels&quot; (1946) Orwell wrote: &quot;If I had to make a list of six books which were to be preserved when all others were destroyed, I would certainly put &quot;Gulliver&#x27;s Travels&quot; among them.&quot; On H. G. Wells he wrote, &quot;The minds of all of us, and therefore the physical world, would be perceptibly different if Wells had never existed.&quot;

Orwell was an admirer of Arthur Koestler and became a close friend during the three years that Koestler and his wife Mamain spent at the cottage of Bwlch Ocyn in the Vale of Ffestiniog. Orwell reviewed Koestler&#x27;s &quot;Darkness at Noon&quot; for the &quot;New Statesman&quot; in 1941, saying:
Other writers Orwell admired included Ralph Waldo Emerson, George Gissing, Graham Greene, Herman Melville, Henry Miller, Tobias Smollett, Mark Twain, Joseph Conrad, and Yevgeny Zamyatin. He was both an admirer and a critic of Rudyard Kipling, praising Kipling as a gifted writer and a &quot;good bad poet&quot; whose work is &quot;spurious&quot; and &quot;morally insensitive and aesthetically disgusting,&quot; but undeniably seductive and able to speak to certain aspects of reality more effectively than more enlightened authors. He had a similarly ambivalent attitude to G. K. Chesterton, whom he regarded as a writer of considerable talent who had chosen to devote himself to &quot;Roman Catholic propaganda&quot;, and to Evelyn Waugh, who was, he wrote, &quot;about as good a novelist as one can be (i.e. as novelists go today) while holding untenable opinions&quot;.

===Literary critic===
Throughout his life Orwell continually supported himself as a book reviewer. His reviews are well known and have had an influence on literary criticism. He wrote in the conclusion to his 1940 essay on Charles Dickens,
George Woodcock suggested that the last two sentences also describe Orwell.

Orwell wrote a critique of George Bernard Shaw&#x27;s play &quot;Arms and the Man&quot;. He considered this Shaw&#x27;s best play and the most likely to remain socially relevant. His 1945 essay &quot;In Defence of P.G. Wodehouse&quot; argues that his broadcasts from Germany during the war did not really make him a traitor. He accused The Ministry of Information of exaggerating Wodehouse&#x27;s actions for propaganda purposes.

=== Food writing ===
In 1946, the British Council commissioned Orwell to write an essay on British food as part of a drive to promote British relations abroad. In his essay titled &quot;British Cookery&quot;, Orwell described the British diet as &quot;a simple, rather heavy, perhaps slightly barbarous diet&quot; and where &quot;hot drinks are acceptable at most hours of the day&quot;. He wrote that high tea in the United Kingdom consisted of a variety of savoury and sweet dishes, but &quot;no tea would be considered a good one if it did not include at least one kind of cake&quot;, before adding &quot;as well as cakes, biscuits are much eaten at tea-time&quot;. Orwell included his own recipe for marmalade, a popular British spread on toast. However, the British Council declined to publish the essay on the grounds that it was too problematic to write about food at the time of strict rationing in the UK following the war. In 2019, the essay was discovered in the British Council&#x27;s archives along with the rejection letter. The British Council issued an official apology to Orwell over the rejection of the commissioned essay, publishing the original essay along with the rejection letter.

===Reception and evaluations of Orwell&#x27;s works===

Arthur Koestler said that Orwell&#x27;s &quot;uncompromising intellectual honesty made him appear almost inhuman at times&quot;. Ben Wattenberg stated: &quot;Orwell&#x27;s writing pierced intellectual hypocrisy wherever he found it.&quot; According to historian Piers Brendon, &quot;Orwell was the saint of common decency who would in earlier days, said his BBC boss Rushbrook Williams, &#x27;have been either canonised‚Äîor burnt at the stake. Raymond Williams in &quot;Politics and Letters: Interviews with New Left Review&quot; describes Orwell as a &quot;successful impersonation of a plain man who bumps into experience in an unmediated way and tells the truth about it&quot;. Christopher Norris declared that Orwell&#x27;s &quot;homespun empiricist outlook‚Äîhis assumption that the truth was just there to be told in a straightforward common-sense way‚Äînow seems not merely na√Øve but culpably self-deluding&quot;. The American scholar Scott Lucas has described Orwell as an enemy of the Left. John Newsinger has argued that Lucas could only do this by portraying &quot;all of Orwell&#x27;s attacks on Stalinism [‚Äì] as if they were attacks on socialism, despite Orwell&#x27;s continued insistence that they were not&quot;.

Orwell&#x27;s work has taken a prominent place in the school literature curriculum in England, with &quot;Animal Farm&quot; a regular examination topic at the end of secondary education (GCSE), and &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot; a topic for subsequent examinations below university level (A Levels). A 2016 UK poll saw &quot;Animal Farm&quot; ranked the nation&#x27;s favourite book from school.

Historian John Rodden stated: &quot;John Podhoretz did claim that if Orwell were alive today, he&#x27;d be standing with the neo-conservatives and against the Left. And the question arises, to what extent can you even begin to predict the political positions of somebody who&#x27;s been dead three decades and more by that time?&quot;

John Rodden points out the &quot;undeniable conservative features in the Orwell physiognomy&quot; and remarks on how &quot;to some extent Orwell facilitated the kinds of uses and abuses by the Right that his name has been put to. In other ways there has been the politics of selective quotation.&quot; Rodden refers to the essay &quot;Why I Write&quot;, in which Orwell refers to the Spanish Civil War as being his &quot;watershed political experience&quot;, saying: &quot;The Spanish War and other events in 1936‚Äì37, turned the scale. Thereafter I knew where I stood. Every line of serious work that I have written since 1936 has been written directly or indirectly &quot;against&quot; totalitarianism and &quot;for&quot; democratic socialism as I understand it.&quot; (emphasis in original) Rodden goes on to explain how, during the McCarthy era, the introduction to the Signet edition of &quot;Animal Farm&quot; makes use of selective quotation:
Fyvel wrote about Orwell: His crucial experience¬†[...] was his struggle to turn himself into a writer, one which led through long periods of poverty, failure and humiliation, and about which he has written almost nothing directly. The sweat and agony was less in the slum-life than in the effort to turn the experience into literature.

Conversely, historian Isaac Deutscher was far more critical of Orwell from a Marxist perspective and characterised him as a &quot;simple minded anarchist&quot;. Deutscher argued that Orwell had struggled to comprehend the dialectical philosophy of Marxism, demonstrated personal ambivalence towards other strands of socialism and his works such as &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot; had been appropriated for the purpose of anti-communist Cold War propaganda.

===Influence on language and writing===
In his essay &quot;Politics and the English Language&quot; (1946), Orwell wrote about the importance of precise and clear language, arguing that vague writing can be used as a powerful tool of political manipulation. In that essay, Orwell provides six rules for writers:
Orwell worked as a journalist at &quot;The Observer&quot; for seven years, and its editor David Astor gave a copy of this celebrated essay to every new recruit. In 2003, literary editor at the newspaper Robert McCrum wrote, &quot;Even now, it is quoted in our style book&quot;. Journalist Jonathan Heawood noted: &quot;Orwell&#x27;s criticism of slovenly language is still taken very seriously.&quot;

Andrew N. Rubin argues that &quot;Orwell claimed that we should be attentive to how the use of language has limited our capacity for critical thought just as we should be equally concerned with the ways in which dominant modes of thinking have reshaped the very language that we use.&quot;

The adjective &quot;Orwellian&quot; connotes an attitude and a policy of control by propaganda, surveillance, misinformation, denial of truth and manipulation of the past. In &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot;, Orwell described a totalitarian government that controlled thought by controlling language, making certain ideas literally unthinkable. Several words and phrases from &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot; have entered popular language. &quot;Newspeak&quot; is a simplified and obfuscatory language designed to make independent thought impossible. &quot;Doublethink&quot; means holding two contradictory beliefs simultaneously. The &quot;Thought Police&quot; are those who suppress all dissenting opinion. &quot;Prolefeed&quot; is homogenised, manufactured superficial literature, film and music used to control and indoctrinate the populace through docility. &quot;Big Brother&quot; is a supreme dictator who watches everyone. Other neologisms from the novel include, &quot;Two Minutes Hate&quot;, &quot;Room 101&quot;, &quot;memory hole&quot;, &quot;&quot;, and &quot;thoughtcrime&quot;, as well as providing direct inspiration for the neologism &quot;groupthink&quot;.

Orwell may have been the first to use the term &quot;cold war&quot; in his essay, &quot;You and the Atom Bomb&quot;, published in &quot;Tribune&quot; on 19 October 1945. He wrote:
===Modern culture===

The Orwell Society was formed in 2011 to promote understanding of the life and work of Orwell. A registered UK charity, it was founded and inaugurated by Dione Venables at Phyllis Court members club in Henley-on-Thames, Oxfordshire, a club that was often visited by Orwell in his youth.

Apart from theatre adaptations of his books, several works were written with Orwell as one of the main characters.

* In 2012, a musical play, &quot;One Georgie Orwell&quot;, by Peter Cordwell and Carl Picton was performed at the Greenwich Theatre, London. It explored Orwell&#x27;s life, his concerns for the world that he lived in, and for the Britain that he loved. 
* In 2014, a play written by playwright Joe Sutton titled &quot;Orwell in America&quot; was first performed by the Northern Stage theatre company in White River Junction, Vermont. It is a fictitious account of Orwell doing a book tour in the United States (something he never did in his lifetime). It moved to off-Broadway in 2016. 
* In 2017, &quot;Mrs Orwell&quot; by British playwright Tony Cox opened at the Old Red Lion Theatre¬†in London¬†before transferring¬†to the¬†Southwark Playhouse. The play centres on Orwell&#x27;s second wife Sonia Brownell (played by Cressida Bonas), her reasons for marrying Orwell and her relationship with Lucian Freud.
* In 2019, Tasmanian theatre company Blue Cow presented the play &quot;101&quot; by Cameron Hindrum, in which Orwell is seen working on his novel &quot;1984&quot; &quot;while keeping his severe illness at bay and balancing the demands of fatherhood, art, family and success.&quot;
*Orwell is the main character in a 2017 novel, &quot;The Last Man in Europe&quot;, by Australian author Dennis Glover.
*The young Eric Blair is the main character in Paul Theroux&#x27;s 2024 novel &quot;Burma Sahib&quot;, a fictional narrative of Blair&#x27;s five years in the country.
Orwell&#x27;s birthplace, a bungalow in Motihari, Bihar, India, was opened as a museum in May 2015.

=== Archive ===
In 1960 Orwell&#x27;s widow Sonia deposited his papers on permanent loan to University College London. The collection contains Orwell&#x27;s literary notebooks, manuscripts and typescripts of his work, personal and political diaries, correspondence and family material. Since the initial donation the papers - now known as the George Orwell Archive - have been supplemented by further donations from family, friends and business associates. Orwell&#x27;s son Richard Blair has purchased additional material for the collection since its inception; in 2023 Blair was awarded an Honorary Fellowship from University College London for his contributions.

University College London also holds an extensive collection of Orwell&#x27;s books, including rare and early editions of his works, translations into other languages and titles from his own library.

===Statue===

A statue of George Orwell, sculpted by the British sculptor Martin Jennings, was unveiled on 7 November 2017 outside Broadcasting House, the headquarters of the BBC. The wall behind the statue is inscribed with the following phrase: &quot;If liberty means anything at all, it means the right to tell people what they do not want to hear&quot;. These are words from his proposed preface to &quot;Animal Farm&quot; and a rallying cry for the idea of free speech in an open society.

===Other honours===
In January 2025, the Royal Mint issued a new ¬£2 coin to mark the 75th anniversary of Orwell&#x27;s death. The design, by Henry Gray, is an allusion to &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot;, showing an eye with a camera lens at its centre, and including two quotations from the book.

==Personal life==

===Childhood===
Jacintha Buddicom&#x27;s account, &quot;Eric &amp; Us&quot;, provides an insight into Blair&#x27;s childhood. She quoted his sister Avril that &quot;he was essentially an aloof, undemonstrative person&quot; and said herself of his friendship with the Buddicoms: &quot;I do not think he needed any other friends beyond the schoolfriend he occasionally and appreciatively referred to as &#x27;CC&#x27;&quot;. She could not recall him having schoolfriends to stay and exchange visits as her brother Prosper often did in holidays. Cyril Connolly provides an account of Blair as a child in &quot;Enemies of Promise&quot;. Years later, Blair mordantly recalled his prep school in the essay &quot;Such, Such Were the Joys&quot;, claiming among other things that he &quot;was made to study like a dog&quot; to earn a scholarship. Jacintha Buddicom repudiated Orwell&#x27;s schoolboy misery described in the essay, stating that &quot;he was a specially happy child&quot;. She noted that he did not like his name because it reminded him of a book he greatly disliked‚Äî&quot;Eric, or, Little by Little&quot;, a Victorian boys&#x27; school story.

Connolly remarked of him as a schoolboy, &quot;The remarkable thing about Orwell was that alone among the boys he was an intellectual and not a parrot for he thought for himself&quot;. At Eton, John Vaughan Wilkes, his former headmaster&#x27;s son at St Cyprians, recalled that &quot;he was extremely argumentative‚Äîabout anything‚Äîand criticising the masters and criticising the other boys¬†[...] We enjoyed arguing with him. He would generally win the arguments‚Äîor think he had anyhow.&quot;

Blair liked to carry out practical jokes. Buddicom recalls him swinging from the luggage rack in a railway carriage like an orangutan to frighten a woman passenger out of the compartment. At Eton, he played tricks on John Crace, his housemaster, among which was to enter a spoof advertisement in a college magazine implying pederasty. Gow, his tutor, said he &quot;made himself as big a nuisance as he could&quot; and &quot;was a very unattractive boy&quot;. Later Blair was expelled from the crammer at Southwold for sending a dead rat as a birthday present to the town surveyor.

Blair had an interest in natural history which stemmed from his childhood. In letters from school he wrote about caterpillars and butterflies, and Buddicom recalls his keen interest in ornithology. He also enjoyed fishing and shooting rabbits, and conducting experiments as in cooking a hedgehog or shooting down a jackdaw from the Eton roof to dissect it. His zeal for scientific experiments extended to explosives‚Äîagain Buddicom recalls a cook giving notice because of the noise. Later in Southwold, his sister Avril recalled him blowing up the garden. When teaching he enthused his students with his nature-rambles both at Southwold and at Hayes. His adult diaries are permeated with his observations on nature.

===Relationships and marriage===
Blair&#x27;s adolescent idyll with Buddicom was shattered in the summer of 1921, when he attempted to take their relationship further than Buddicom was ready for, in what was characterised as a &quot;botched seduction&quot;. When Blair left for Burma the following year, he wrote to Buddicom but she soon stopped replying to his letters. Returning from Burma in 1927, Blair went in search of Buddicom at her family home to ask her to marry him but could not find her. What had been &quot;a very serious business indeed&quot; for Blair had apparently been dismissed by Buddicom, leaving Blair potentially emotionally vulnerable. Buddicom and Blair revisited those memories briefly in 1949 in three letters and three telephone calls but without closure.

Mabel Fierz, who later became Blair&#x27;s confidante, said: &quot;He used to say the one thing he wished in this world was that he&#x27;d been attractive to women. He liked women and had many girlfriends I think in Burma. He had a girl in Southwold and another girl in London. He was rather a womaniser, yet he was afraid he wasn&#x27;t attractive.&quot;

Brenda Salkield (Southwold) preferred friendship to any deeper relationship and maintained a correspondence with Blair for many years, particularly as a sounding board for his ideas. She wrote: &quot;He was a great letter writer. Endless letters, and I mean when he wrote you a letter he wrote pages.&quot; His correspondence with Eleanor Jacques (London) was more prosaic, dwelling on a closer relationship and referring to past rendezvous or planning future ones in London and Burnham Beeches.

When Orwell was in the sanatorium in Kent, his wife Eileen&#x27;s friend Lydia Jackson visited. He invited her for a walk and out of sight &quot;an awkward situation arose.&quot; Jackson was to be the most critical of Orwell&#x27;s marriage to Eileen, but their later correspondence hints at a complicity. At the time Eileen was more concerned about Orwell&#x27;s closeness to Brenda Salkield. Orwell had an affair with his secretary at &quot;Tribune&quot; which caused Eileen much distress, and others have been mooted. In a letter to Ann Popham he wrote: &quot;I was sometimes unfaithful to Eileen, and I also treated her badly, and I think she treated me badly, too, at times, but it was a real marriage, in the sense that we had been through awful struggles together and she understood all about my work, etc.&quot; Similarly he suggested to Celia Kirwan that they had both been unfaithful. There are several testaments that it was a well-matched and happy marriage.

In June 1944, Orwell and Eileen adopted a three-week-old boy they named Richard Horatio. According to Richard, Orwell was a wonderful father who gave him devoted, if rather rugged, attention and a great degree of freedom.

Orwell was very lonely after Eileen&#x27;s death in 1945 and was desperate for a wife, both as companion for himself and as mother for Richard. He proposed marriage to four women, including Celia Kirwan, and eventually Sonia Brownell accepted. Orwell had met her when she was assistant to Cyril Connolly, at &quot;Horizon&quot; literary magazine. They were married on 13 October 1949, only three months before Orwell&#x27;s death. Some maintain that Sonia was the model for Julia in &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot;.

===Social interactions===
Orwell was noted for very close and enduring friendships with a few friends, but these were generally people with a similar background or with a similar level of literary ability. Ungregarious, he was out of place in a crowd and his discomfort was exacerbated when he was outside his own class. Though representing himself as a spokesman for the common man, he often appeared out of place with real working people. His brother-in-law Humphrey Dakin, a &quot;Hail fellow, well met&quot; type, who took him to a local pub in Leeds, said that he was told by the landlord: &quot;Don&#x27;t bring that bugger in here again.&quot; Adrian Fierz commented &quot;He wasn&#x27;t interested in racing or greyhounds or pub crawling or shove ha&#x27;penny. He just did not have much in common with people who did not share his intellectual interests.&quot; Awkwardness attended many of his encounters with working-class representatives, as with Pollitt and McNair, but his courtesy and good manners were often commented on. Jack Common observed on meeting him for the first time, &quot;Right away manners, and more than manners‚Äîbreeding‚Äîshowed through.&quot;

In his tramping days, he did domestic work for a time. His extreme politeness was recalled by a member of the family he worked for; she declared that the family referred to him as &quot;Laurel&quot; after the film comedian. With his gangling figure and awkwardness, Orwell&#x27;s friends often saw him as a figure of fun. Geoffrey Gorer commented &quot;He was awfully likely to knock things off tables, trip over things. I mean, he was a gangling, physically badly co-ordinated young man. I think his feeling [was] that even the inanimate world was against him.&quot; At the BBC in the 1940s, &quot;everybody would pull his leg&quot; and Spender described him as having real entertainment value &quot;like, as I say, watching a Charlie Chaplin movie&quot;. A friend of Eileen&#x27;s reminisced about her tolerance and humour, often at Orwell&#x27;s expense.

One biography of Orwell accused him of having had an authoritarian streak. One of his former pupils recalled being beaten so hard he could not sit down for a week. When sharing a flat with Orwell, Heppenstall came home late one night in an advanced stage of loud inebriation. The upshot was that Heppenstall ended up with a bloody nose and was locked in a room. When he complained, Orwell hit him across the legs with a shooting stick and Heppenstall then had to defend himself with a chair. Years later, after Orwell&#x27;s death, Heppenstall wrote a dramatic account of the incident called &quot;The Shooting Stick&quot;.

Orwell got on well with young people. The pupil he beat considered him the best of teachers and the young recruits in Barcelona tried to drink him under the table without success.

In the wake of his most famous works, he attracted many uncritical hangers-on, but many others who sought him found him aloof and even dull. With his soft voice, he was sometimes shouted down or excluded from discussions. At this time, he was severely ill; it was wartime or the austerity period after it; during the war his wife suffered from depression; and after her death he was lonely and unhappy. In addition to that, he always lived frugally and seemed unable to care for himself properly. As a result of all this, people found his circumstances bleak. Some, like Michael Ayrton, called him &quot;Gloomy George&quot;, but others developed the idea that he was an &quot;English secular saint&quot;.

===Lifestyle===
Orwell was a heavy smoker, who rolled his own cigarettes from strong shag tobacco, despite his bronchial condition. His penchant for the rugged life often took him to cold and damp situations. Described by &quot;The Economist&quot; as &quot;perhaps the 20th century&#x27;s best chronicler of English culture&quot;, Orwell considered fish and chips, football, the pub, strong tea, cut-price chocolate, the movies, and radio among the chief comforts for the working class. He advocated a patriotic defence of a British way of life that could not be trusted to intellectuals or, by implication, the state:


Orwell enjoyed strong tea‚Äîhe had Fortnum &amp; Mason&#x27;s tea brought to him in Catalonia. His 1946 essay, &quot;A Nice Cup of Tea&quot;, appeared in the &quot;London Evening Standard&quot; article on how to make tea. He appreciated English beer, taken regularly and moderately, despised drinkers of lager, and wrote about an imagined, ideal British pub in his 1946 &quot;Evening Standard&quot; article, &quot;The Moon Under Water&quot;. Not as particular about food, he enjoyed the wartime &quot;Victory Pie&quot; and extolled canteen food at the BBC. He preferred traditional English dishes, such as roast beef, and kippers.

His dress sense was unpredictable and usually casual. In Southwold, he had the best cloth from the local tailor, but was equally happy in his tramping outfit. His attire in the Spanish Civil War, along with his size-12 boots, was a source of amusement. David Astor described him as looking like a prep school master, while according to the Special Branch dossier, Orwell&#x27;s tendency to dress &quot;in Bohemian fashion&quot; revealed that the author was &quot;a Communist&quot;.

Orwell&#x27;s confusing approach to matters of social decorum‚Äîon the one hand expecting a working-class guest to dress for dinner and, on the other, slurping tea out of a saucer at the BBC canteen‚Äîhelped stoke his reputation as an English eccentric.

==Views==
===Religion===

Orwell was an atheist who identified himself with the humanist outlook on life. Despite this, and despite his criticisms of both religious doctrine and religious organisations, he nevertheless regularly participated in the social and civic life of the church, including by attending Church of England Holy Communion. Acknowledging this contradiction, he once said: &quot;It seems rather mean to go to HC [Holy Communion] when one doesn&#x27;t believe, but I have passed myself off for pious &amp; there is nothing for it but to keep up with the deception.&quot; He had two Anglican marriages and left instructions for an Anglican funeral. Orwell was also well-read in Biblical literature and could quote lengthy passages from the Book of Common Prayer from memory.

His extensive knowledge of the Bible came coupled with unsparing criticism of its philosophy, and as an adult he could not bring himself to believe in its tenets. He said in part V of his essay, &quot;Such, Such Were the Joys&quot;, that &quot;Till about the age of fourteen I believed in God, and believed that the accounts given of him were true. But I was well aware that I did not love him.&quot; Orwell directly contrasted Christianity with secular humanism in his essay &quot;Lear, Tolstoy and the Fool&quot;, finding the latter philosophy more palatable and less &quot;self-interested&quot;. Literary critic James Wood wrote that in the struggle, as he saw it, between Christianity and humanism, &quot;Orwell was on the humanist side, of course&quot;.

Orwell&#x27;s writing was often explicitly critical of religion, and Christianity in particular. He found the church to be a &quot;selfish¬†[...] church of the landed gentry&quot; with its establishment &quot;out of touch&quot; with the majority of its communicants and altogether a pernicious influence on public life. His contradictory and sometimes ambiguous views about the social benefits of religious affiliation mirrored the dichotomies between his public and private lives: Stephen Ingle wrote that it was as if the writer George Orwell &quot;vaunted&quot; his unbelief while Eric Blair the individual retained &quot;a deeply ingrained religiosity&quot;.

===Politics===
Orwell liked to provoke arguments by challenging the status quo, but he was also a traditionalist with a love of old English values. He criticised and satirised, from the inside, the various social milieux in which he found himself. In his &quot;Adelphi&quot; days, he described himself as a &quot;Tory-anarchist&quot;. Of colonialism in &quot;Burmese Days&quot;, he portrays the English colonists as a &quot;dull, decent people, cherishing and fortifying their dullness behind a quarter of a million bayonets.&quot; Writing for &quot;Le Progr√®s Civique&quot;, Orwell described the British colonial government in Burma and India:

The Spanish Civil War played the most important part in defining Orwell&#x27;s socialism. He wrote to Cyril Connolly from Barcelona on 8 June 1937: &quot;I have seen wonderful things and at last really believe in Socialism, which I never did before.&quot; Having witnessed anarcho-syndicalist communities and the subsequent brutal suppression of the anarcho-syndicalists, anti-Stalin communist parties and revolutionaries by the Soviet Union-backed Communists, Orwell returned from Catalonia a staunch anti-Stalinist and joined the British Independent Labour Party.

In Part 2 of &quot;The Road to Wigan Pier&quot;, published by the Left Book Club, Orwell stated that &quot;a real Socialist is one who wishes‚Äînot merely conceives it as desirable, but actively wishes‚Äîto see tyranny overthrown&quot;. Orwell stated in &quot;Why I Write&quot; (1946): &quot;Every line of serious work that I have written since 1936 has been written, directly or indirectly, against totalitarianism and for democratic socialism, as I understand it.&quot; Orwell&#x27;s conception of socialism was of a planned economy alongside democracy. Orwell was a proponent of a federal socialist Europe, a position outlined in his 1947 essay &quot;Toward European Unity&quot;, which first appeared in &quot;Partisan Review&quot;. According to biographer John Newsinger:
Orwell was opposed to rearmament against Nazi Germany and at the time of the Munich Agreement he signed a manifesto entitled &quot;If War Comes We Shall Resist&quot;‚Äîbut he changed his view after the Molotov‚ÄìRibbentrop Pact and the outbreak of the war. He left the ILP because of its opposition to the war and adopted a political position of &quot;revolutionary patriotism&quot;. On 21 March 1940 he wrote a review of Adolf Hitler&#x27;s &quot;Mein Kampf&quot; for &quot;The New English Weekly&quot;, in which he analysed the dictator&#x27;s psychology. Asking &quot;how was it that he was able to put [his] monstrous vision across?&quot;, Orwell tried to understand why Hitler was worshipped by the German people: The situation in Germany, with its seven million unemployed, was obviously favourable for demagogues. But Hitler could not have succeeded against his many rivals if it had not been for the attraction of his own personality, which one can feel even in the clumsy writing of &quot;Mein Kampf&quot;, and which is no doubt overwhelming when one hears his speeches...The fact is that there is something deeply appealing about him. The initial, personal cause of his grievance against the universe can only be guessed at; but at any rate the grievance is here. He is the martyr, the victim, Prometheus chained to the rock, the self-sacrificing hero who fights single-handed against impossible odds. If he were killing a mouse he would know how to make it seem like a dragon.

In December 1940 he wrote in &quot;Tribune&quot; (the Labour left&#x27;s weekly): &quot;We are in a strange period of history in which a revolutionary has to be a patriot and a patriot has to be a revolutionary.&quot; During the war, Orwell was highly critical of the popular idea that an Anglo-Soviet alliance would be the basis of a post-war world of peace and prosperity. In his reply (dated 15 November 1943) to an invitation from the Duchess of Atholl to speak for the British League for European Freedom, he stated that he could not &quot;associate himself with an essentially Conservative body&quot; that claimed to &quot;defend democracy in Europe&quot; but had &quot;nothing to say about British imperialism&quot;. His closing paragraph stated: &quot;I belong to the Left and must work inside it, much as I hate Russian totalitarianism and its poisonous influence in this country.&quot;

Orwell joined the staff of &quot;Tribune&quot; magazine as literary editor, and from then until his death, was a left-wing (though hardly orthodox) Labour-supporting democratic socialist. On 1 September 1944, writing about the Warsaw uprising, Orwell expressed in &quot;Tribune&quot; his hostility against the influence of the alliance with the USSR over the allies: &quot;Do remember that dishonesty and cowardice always have to be paid for. Do not imagine that for years on end you can make yourself the boot-licking propagandist of the sovietic regime, or any other regime, and then suddenly return to honesty and reason. Once a whore, always a whore.&quot; According to Newsinger, although Orwell &quot;was always critical of the 1945‚Äì51 Labour government&#x27;s moderation, his support for it began to pull him to the right politically. This did not lead him to embrace conservatism, imperialism or reaction, but to defend, albeit critically, Labour reformism.&quot;
Special Branch, the intelligence division of the Metropolitan Police, maintained a file on Orwell for more than 20 years of his life. The dossier, published by The National Archives, states that, according to one investigator, Orwell had &quot;advanced Communist views and several of his Indian friends say that they have often seen him at Communist meetings&quot;. MI5, the intelligence department of the Home Office, noted: &quot;It is evident from his recent writings‚Äî&#x27;The Lion and the Unicorn&#x27;‚Äîand his contribution to Gollancz&#x27;s symposium &quot;The Betrayal of the Left&quot; that he does not hold with the Communist Party nor they with him.&quot;

=== Sexuality ===
Sexual politics plays an important role in &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot;. In the novel, people&#x27;s intimate relationships are strictly governed by the party&#x27;s Junior Anti-Sex League, by opposing sexual relations and instead encouraging artificial insemination. Personally, Orwell disliked what he thought as misguided middle-class revolutionary emancipatory views, expressing disdain for &quot;every fruit-juice drinker, nudist, sandal-wearer, sex-maniacs&quot;.

Orwell was also openly against homosexuality. Daphne Patai said: &quot;Of course he was homophobic. That has nothing to do with his relations with his homosexual friends. Certainly, he had a negative attitude and a certain kind of anxiety, a denigrating attitude towards homosexuality. That is definitely the case. I think his writing reflects that quite fully.&quot;

Orwell used the homophobic epithets &quot;nancy&quot; and &quot;pansy&quot;, for example, in expressions of contempt for what he called the &quot;pansy Left&quot;. The protagonist of &quot;Keep the Aspidistra Flying&quot;, Gordon Comstock, conducts an internal critique of his customers when working in a bookshop, and there is an extended passage of several pages in which he concentrates on a homosexual male customer, and sneers at him for his &quot;nancy&quot; characteristics, including a lisp. Stephen Spender &quot;thought Orwell&#x27;s occasional homophobic outbursts were part of his rebellion against the public school&quot;.

==Biographies==
Orwell&#x27;s will requested that no biography of him be written, and his widow, Sonia Brownell, repelled every attempt by those who tried to persuade her to let them write about him. Various recollections and interpretations were published in the 1950s and 1960s, but Sonia saw the 1968 &quot;Collected Works&quot; as the record of his life. She did appoint Malcolm Muggeridge as official biographer, but later biographers have seen this as deliberate spoiling as Muggeridge eventually gave up the work. In 1972, two American authors, Peter Stansky and William Abrahams, produced &quot;The Unknown Orwell&quot;, an unauthorised account of his early years that lacked any support or contribution from Sonia Brownell.

Sonia Brownell then commissioned Bernard Crick to complete a biography and asked Orwell&#x27;s friends to co-operate. Crick collated a considerable amount of material in his work, which was published in 1980, but his questioning of the factual accuracy of Orwell&#x27;s first-person writings led to conflict with Brownell, and she tried to suppress the book. Crick concentrated on the facts of Orwell&#x27;s life rather than his character, and presented primarily a political perspective.

After Sonia Brownell&#x27;s death, other works on Orwell were published in the 1980s, particularly in 1984. These included collections of reminiscences by Audrey Coppard and Crick and Stephen Wadhams. In 1991, Michael Shelden published a biography. More concerned with the literary nature of Orwell&#x27;s work, he sought explanations for Orwell&#x27;s character and treated his first-person writings as autobiographical. Shelden introduced new information that sought to build on Crick&#x27;s work.

Peter Davison&#x27;s publication of the &quot;Complete Works of George Orwell&quot;, completed in 2000, made most of the Orwell Archive accessible to the public. Jeffrey Meyers, a prolific American biographer, was first to take advantage of this and published a book in 2001 that investigated the darker side of Orwell and questioned his saintly image. &quot;Why Orwell Matters&quot; (released in the UK as &quot;Orwell&#x27;s Victory&quot;) was published by Christopher Hitchens in 2002.

In 2003, the centenary of Orwell&#x27;s birth resulted in biographies by Gordon Bowker and D. J. Taylor. Taylor notes the stage management which surrounds much of Orwell&#x27;s behaviour and Bowker highlights the essential sense of decency which he considers to have been Orwell&#x27;s main motivation. An updated edition of Taylor&#x27;s biography was released in 2023 as &quot;Orwell: The New Life&quot;, published by Constable.

In 2018, Ronald Binns published the first detailed study of Orwell&#x27;s years in Suffolk, &quot;Orwell in Southwold&quot;. In 2020, Richard Bradford wrote a new biography, &quot;Orwell: A Man of Our Time&quot;, while in 2021 Rebecca Solnit reflected on Orwell&#x27;s interest in gardening in her book &quot;Orwell&#x27;s Roses&quot;.

Two books about Orwell&#x27;s relationship with his first wife, Eileen O&#x27;Shaughnessy, and her role in his life and career, have been published: &quot;Eileen: The Making of George Orwell&quot; by Sylvia Topp (2020) and &quot;Wifedom: Mrs Orwell&#x27;s Invisible Life&quot; by Anna Funder (2023). In her book Funder claims that Orwell was misogynistic and sadistic. This sparked a strong controversy among Orwell&#x27;s biographers, particularly with Topp. Celia Kirwan&#x27;s family also intervened in the discussion, believing that the attribution to their relative of a relationship with Orwell, as stated by Funder, is false. The publishing house of &quot;Wifedom&quot; was forced to remove that reference from the book.

<doc id="11894" wikidata="Q206273" url="?curid=11894" title="Goeldi's marmoset">
<text>Goeldi&#x27;s marmoset, or Goeldi&#x27;s monkey (Callimico goeldii), is a small New World monkey found on the South American continent, mainly in the upper Amazon basin of Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, and Per√∫. It is the only species classified in the monotypic genus Callimico, thus these monkeys are sometimes referred to as &quot;callimicos&quot;. The species takes its name from its discoverer, Swiss-Brazilian naturalist Emil August Goeldi.

Likely an evolutionary adaptation for camouflage and the evasion of predators, Goeldi&#x27;s marmosets are a dark-furred species, usually a blackish-gray or darker brown in color. Superficially, the short hair on their head gives them a vague resemblance to the larger woolly monkey (&quot;Lagothrix&quot;); however, the back of their necks, their backside, and tails often display light, horizontal striping or highlights. Their bodies are about long, and their tails are about another long. Captive Goeldi&#x27;s marmosets weigh around , while observed individuals were approximately in the wild. Their digits have claw-like nails, except for the hallux, which serves for clinging, scansorial (arboreal) movement and escape, and the extraction of certain food sources from trees, such as fruits, honey, seed pods, etc.

== Taxonomy and evolution ==
Goeldi&#x27;s marmoset was first described in 1904, making &quot;Callimico&quot; one of the more recent monkey genera to be described. In older classification schemes it was sometimes placed in its own family Callimiconidae and sometimes, along with the marmosets and tamarins, in the subfamily Callitrichinae in the family Cebidae. More recently, Callitrichinae has been (re-)elevated to family status as Callitrichidae.

Molecular phylogenetics shows that &quot;C. goeldii&quot; evolved from an ancestral callitrichine and shares this origin with marmosets making them sister taxa. One evolutionary argument to account for their differences, states that &quot;C. goeldii&quot; conserves primitive traits such as single births and a third molar lost in many marmosets. Alternatively, another evolutionary argument indicates that Callimicos came from a two-molar marmoset and reintroduced the remote traits, which in either case selectively give them the ability to access to different resources and occupy different niches. Similarities in delayed embryonic development and secondary limb-bone ossification between &quot;C. goeldii&quot; and marmosets are evidence of their close evolutionary relationship.

== Reproduction ==
Females reach sexual maturity at 8.5 months, males at 16.5 months. The gestation period lasts from 144 to 159 days. Callimicos studied in captivity in North America and Europe for near 40 years have shown to produce on average 3.5 offspring during their lifetime. However, 30% of the females and 45% of the males observed in these settings never reproduced.

Unlike other New World monkeys, they have the capacity to give birth twice a year. Biannual births occur regularly in captivity and less consistently in the wild and are attributed to postpartum estrus that allows the female to be ready to reproduce soon after parturition. The availability of fungus -an important food source for &quot;C. goeldii&quot;- throughout the year also contributes to these multiple births.

The mother carries a single baby monkey per pregnancy, whereas most other species in the family Callitrichidae usually give birth to twins. These singleton births provide the offspring with longer maternal care and weaning delay that results in faster growth rates and in turn earlier sexual maturity than the other marmosets.

== Infant care ==
For the first 2‚Äì3 weeks the mother acts as the primary caregiver after which the father and the helpers, who are often the siblings, share many of the responsibilities. However, mothers in the wild have been observed giving their babies to other members of the troop as early as 10 days after parturition, which is late for other marmosets.

At birth, &quot;Callimico&quot; offspring weigh 10% the weight of their mother&#x27;s whereas the twinning marmosets weight double that amount, which explains the delay in allocare in &quot;C. goeldii&quot; since it is not as crucial as it is for its counterparts. Cooperative care in callitrichines is therefore necessary to help mothers recover from gestation, parturition, and lactation as well as to share the energetic cost of carrying the infant among the helpers and the father.

Caregivers must also provide food to the infants when they turn 4 weeks of age. The task of food provisioning includes tolerance to food robbing since infants are at a stage of learning how to forage by themselves. Also at week 4, mothers stop nursing in the wild, but that behaviour is believed to be influenced by the presence of the observers and therefore, it is suspected that nursing resumes when humans are not present. Whereas &quot;C. goeldii&quot; in captivity, nursing extends until the infant is 8‚Äì15 weeks old. Thus, the offspring will be weaned when it becomes about 63 days of age. There is no difference between male and female helpers on the amount of involvement on infant care. Even juvenile &quot;C. goeldii&quot; participate as active caregivers.

Infants are carried entirely during the first month and 63% of the time on the next month. They do not leave their guardian side until they become 2.5 months of age and around 3 months old, they are rarely carried, but locomotive independence comes more forcibly than voluntarily. Females outnumber males by 2 to 1. The life expectancy in captivity is about 10 years.

== Development ==
From birth to about 18 months old, callimicos grow faster than other marmosets in part because the energy they would otherwise invest on thermal regulation and activity costs if they were not carried by their mothers is instead directed to growth. Likewise, a longer lactation period is also responsible for a faster development. Growth rate and weight gain is similar in both male and female infants and juveniles.

== Distribution and habitat ==
&quot;Callimicos&quot;&#x27;s geographic distribution extends from the Colombian Amazon and the R√≠o Caquet√° (Portuguese: &quot;Japur√°&quot;) to the Peruvian and the western Brazilian Amazon, into the Pando department of northwestern Bolivia, where high densities have been reported. Its presence in Ecuador has yet to be officially confirmed. The distribution of the species is patchy, and its density seems to be dependent on polyspecific associations with tamarins.

Sightings of Goeldi&#x27;s marmosets have been made at the base of the Cordillera Oriental of the Andes in Colombia, in the Department of Putumayo, along the Putumayo and Caquet√° Rivers.

In Per√∫&#x27;s northern interior, they occur in the Pucacuro National Reserve, close to the R√≠o Tigre, where they are known as &quot;chi-chi&quot; by locals. To the south, they have been found at the &quot;Centro de Investigaci√≥n y Capacitaci√≥n R√≠o Los Amigos&quot; (or Los Amigos River Training and Research Center, CICRA), Manu National Park, and the &quot;Concesi√≥n de Conservaci√≥n Rodal Semillero Tahuamanu&quot; (CCRST), in addition to adjacent and surrounding areas. They were also spotted near the Yura River and Sierra del Divisor National Park in groups of three to twelve individuals.

Some observations were previously recorded via the live-trapping of marmosets, beginning in the 1970s until the early 2010s; on one occasion, the captured marmosets were taken for closer examination and breeding at the &quot;Centro de Conservaci√≥n y Reproduci√≥n de Primates&quot;, Iquitos. Using food baits at stationary sites, and recordings of their vocalizations, and those of tamarins, with whom they associate, were also employed to attract them.

In Brazil, Goeldi&#x27;s marmosets occur in the southwest Amazon in the west-central state of Acre, over the Serra do Divisor, south near the Juru√° and into the Greg√≥rio, Amazonas; they can also be found near the Laco River, further south to the upper Pur√∫s and in the Madeira basin, as well as near the Abun√£ River, Rond√¥nia. High densities of this species have been recorded in the Pando department in Bolivia.

Goeldi&#x27;s marmosets prefer to forage in dense, scrubby undergrowth; perhaps because of this, they are rare, with groups living in separate patches of preferred habitat, separated by miles of unfavorable habitat. In the wet season, their diet includes fruits, flowers, flying insects, spiders, mollusks, small lizards, tree frogs and small or young snakes. In the dry season, they feed on fungi, the only tropical primates known to choose this as a source of sustenance. They live in small social groups, of approximately six individuals, that stay within a few feet of one another most of the time, staying in contact via high-pitched calls. They are also known to form polyspecific or interspecific groups with tamarins such as the white-lipped tamarin and brown-mantled tamarin. This is perhaps because Goeldi&#x27;s marmosets are not known to have the X-linked polymorphism which enables some individuals of other New World monkey species to see in full tri-chromatic vision.

<doc id="11921" wikidata="Q11416" url="?curid=11921" title="Gambling">
<text>Gambling (also known as betting or gaming) is the wagering of something of value (&quot;the stakes&quot;) on a random event with the intent of winning something else of value, where instances of strategy are discounted. Gambling thus requires three elements to be present: consideration (an amount wagered), risk (chance), and a prize. The outcome of the wager is often immediate, such as a single roll of dice, a spin of a roulette wheel, or a horse crossing the finish line, but longer time frames are also common, allowing wagers on the outcome of a future sports contest or even an entire sports season.

The term &quot;gaming&quot; in this context typically refers to instances in which the activity has been specifically permitted by law. The two words are not mutually exclusive; &quot;i.e.&quot;, a &quot;gaming&quot; company offers (legal) &quot;gambling&quot; activities to the public and may be regulated by one of many gaming control boards, for example, the Nevada Gaming Control Board. However, this distinction is not universally observed in the English-speaking world. For instance, in the United Kingdom, the regulator of gambling activities is called the Gambling Commission (not the Gaming Commission). The word &quot;gaming&quot; is used more frequently since the rise of computer and video games to describe activities that do not necessarily involve wagering, especially online gaming, with the new usage still not having displaced the old usage as the primary definition in common dictionaries. &quot;Gaming&quot; has also been used euphemistically to circumvent laws against &quot;gambling&quot;. The media and others have used one term or the other to frame conversations around the subjects, resulting in a shift of perceptions among their audiences.

Gambling is also a major international commercial activity, with the legal gambling market totaling an estimated $335 billion in 2009. In other forms, gambling can be conducted with materials that have a value, but are not real money. For example, players of marbles games might wager marbles, and likewise games of &quot;Pogs&quot; or &quot;&quot; can be played with the collectible game pieces (respectively, small discs and trading cards) as stakes, resulting in a meta-game regarding the value of a player&#x27;s collection of pieces.

==History==

Gambling dates back at least to the Paleolithic period, before written history. In Mesopotamia the earliest six-sided dice date to about 3000¬†BCE. However, they were based on astragali dating back thousands of years earlier. In China, gambling houses were widespread in the first millennium BCE, and betting on fighting animals was common. Lotto games and dominoes (precursors of Pai Gow) appeared in China as early as the 10th century.

Playing cards appeared in the 9th century CE in China. Records trace gambling in Japan back at least as far as the 14th century.

Poker, the most popular U.S. card game associated with gambling, derives from the Persian game As-Nas, dating back to the 17th century. 

The first known casino, the Ridotto, started operating in 1638 in Venice, Italy.

===Great Britain===
Gambling has been a main recreational activity in Great Britain for centuries. Queen Elizabeth I chartered a lottery that was drawn in 1569. Horseracing has been a favorite theme for over three centuries. It has been heavily regulated. Historically much of the opposition comes from Nonconformist Protestants, and from social reformers.

===Singapore===
Gambling has been part of Singapore&#x27;s history, though it was strictly controlled by the government for many years. In the mid-20th century, illegal gambling was common. However, with the opening of regulated casinos in 2010, the approach shifted. Today, the government enforces strict laws to promote responsible gambling and prevent illegal activities.

=== United States===
Gambling has been a popular activity in the United States for centuries. It has also been suppressed by law in many areas for almost as long. By the early 20th century, gambling was almost uniformly outlawed throughout the U.S. and thus became a largely illegal activity, helping to spur the growth of the mafia and other criminal organizations. The late 20th century saw a softening in attitudes towards gambling and a relaxation of laws against it.

==Regulation==

Many jurisdictions, local as well as national, either ban gambling or heavily control it by licensing the vendors. Such regulation generally leads to gambling tourism and illegal gambling in the areas where it is not allowed. The involvement of governments, through regulation and taxation, has led to a close connection between many governments and gambling organizations, where legal gambling provides significant government revenue, such as in Monaco and Macau, China.

There is generally legislation requiring that gambling devices be statistically random, to prevent manufacturers from making some high-payoff results impossible. Since these high payoffs have very low probability, a house bias can quite easily be missed unless the devices are checked carefully.

Most jurisdictions that allow gambling require participants to be above a certain age. In some jurisdictions, the gambling age differs depending on the type of gambling. For example, in many American states one must be over 21 to enter a casino, but may buy a lottery ticket after turning 18.
===Insurance===
Because contracts of insurance have many features in common with wagers, insurance contracts are often distinguished in law as agreements in which either party has an interest in the &quot;bet-upon&quot; outcome &quot;beyond&quot; the specific financial terms; for example, a &quot;bet&quot; with an insurer on whether one&#x27;s house will burn down is not gambling, but rather &quot;insurance&quot;, as the homeowner has an obvious interest in the continued existence of the home &quot;independent of&quot; the purely financial aspects of the &quot;bet&quot; (i.e., the insurance policy). Nonetheless, both insurance and gambling contracts are typically considered aleatory contracts under most legal systems, though they are subject to different types of regulation.

===Asset recovery===
Under common law, particularly English Law (English unjust enrichment), a gambling contract may not give a casino &quot;bona fide&quot; purchaser status, permitting the recovery of stolen funds in some situations. In &quot;Lipkin Gorman v Karpnale Ltd&quot;, where a solicitor used stolen funds to gamble at a casino, the House of Lords overruled the High Court&#x27;s previous verdict, adjudicating that the casino return the stolen funds less those subject to any change of position defence. U.S. Law precedents are somewhat similar. For case law on recovery of gambling losses where the loser had stolen the funds see &quot;Rights of owner of stolen money as against one who won it in gambling transaction from thief&quot;.

An interesting question is what happens when the person trying to make recovery is the gambler&#x27;s spouse, and the money or property lost was either the spouse&#x27;s, or was community property. This was a minor plot point in a Perry Mason novel, &quot;The Case of the Singing Skirt&quot;, and it cites an actual case &quot;Novo v. Hotel Del Rio&quot;.

==Religious views==
=== Buddhism ===
The Buddha stated gambling as a source of destruction in Singalovada Sutra.

Professions that are seen to violate the precept against theft include working in the gambling industry.

=== Hinduism ===

Ancient Hindu poems like the Gambler&#x27;s Lament and the &quot;Mahabharata&quot; testify to the existence of gambling among ancient Indians, while highlighting its destructive impact. The text &quot;Arthashastra&quot; ( BCE) recommends taxation and control of gambling.

===Judaism===
Ancient Jewish authorities frowned on gambling, even disqualifying professional gamblers from testifying in court.

===Christianity===

Although the bible does not condemn gambling, instead the desire to get rich is called to account numerous times in the New Testament.

====Catholicism====
The Catholic Church holds the position that there is no moral impediment to gambling, so long as it is fair, all bettors have a reasonable chance of winning, there is no fraud involved, and the parties involved do not have actual knowledge of the outcome of the bet (unless they have disclosed this knowledge), and as long as the following conditions are met: the gambler can afford to lose the bet, and stops when the limit is reached, and the motivation is entertainment and not personal gain leading to the &quot;love of money&quot; or making a living. In general, Catholic bishops have opposed casino gambling on the grounds that it too often tempts people into problem gambling or addiction, and has particularly negative effects on poor people; they sometimes also cite secondary effects such as increases in loan sharking, prostitution, corruption, and general public immorality. Some parish pastors have also opposed casinos for the additional reason that they would take customers away from church bingo and annual festivals where games such as blackjack, roulette, craps, and poker are used for fundraising. St. Thomas Aquinas wrote that gambling should be especially forbidden where the losing bettor is underage or otherwise not able to consent to the transaction. Gambling has often been seen as having social consequences, as satirized by Balzac. For these social and religious reasons, most legal jurisdictions limit gambling, as advocated by Pascal.

====Protestantism====
Gambling views among Protestants vary, with some either discouraging or forbidding their members from participation in gambling. Methodists, in accordance with the doctrine of outward holiness, oppose gambling which they believe is a sin that feeds on greed. Other denominations that discourage gambling are the United Methodist Church, the Free Methodist Church, the Evangelical Wesleyan Church, the Salvation Army, and the Church of the Nazarene.

Other Protestants that oppose gambling include Mennonites, Schwarzenau Brethren, Quakers, the Christian Reformed Church in North America, the Church of the Lutheran Confession, the Southern Baptist Convention, the Assemblies of God, and the Seventh-day Adventist Church.

====Other Christian denominations====
Other churches that oppose gambling include the Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, the , and the Members Church of God International.

===Islam===
There is a consensus among the &quot;‚ÄòUlema‚Äô&quot; (, Scholars (of Islam)) that gambling is &quot;haraam&quot; (, sinful or forbidden). In assertions made during its prohibition, Muslim jurists describe gambling as being both un-Qur‚Äôanic, and as being generally harmful to the Muslim Ummah (, Community). The Arabic terminology for gambling is &quot;Maisir&quot;. 

In parts of the world that implement full Shari‚Äòah, such as Aceh, punishments for Muslim gamblers can range up to 12 lashes or a one-year prison term and a fine for those who provide a venue for such practises. Some Islamic nations prohibit gambling; most other countries regulate it.

===Bah√°&#x27;√≠ Faith===
According to the Most Holy Book, paragraph 155, gambling is forbidden.

==Types==

===Casino games===
While almost any game can be played for money, and any game typically played for money can also be played just for fun, some games are generally offered in a casino setting.

====Table games====

====Electronic gambling====

* Online roulette
* Pachinko
* Sic Bo
* Slot machine
* Video poker
* Video bingo

====Other gambling====
* Bingo
* Keno

===Non-casino games===
Gambling games that take place outside of casinos include bingo (as played in the US and UK), dead pool, lotteries, pull-tab games and scratchcards, and Mahjong.

Other non-casino gambling games include:
* Non-casino card games, including historical games like Basset, Ecart√©, Lansquenet and Put. Technically, a gambling card game is one in which the cards are not actually played but simply bet on.
* Carnival Games such as The Razzle or Hanky Pank
* Coin-tossing games such as Head and Tail, Two-up*
* Confidence tricks such as Three-card Monte or the Shell game
* Dice-based games, such as Backgammon, Liar&#x27;s dice, Passe-dix, Hazard, Threes, Pig, or Mexico (or Perudo);

*Although coin tossing is not usually played in a casino, it has been known to be an official gambling game in some Australian casinos

===Fixed-odds betting===

Fixed-odds betting and Parimutuel betting frequently occur at many types of sporting events, and political elections. In addition many bookmakers offer fixed odds on a number of non-sports related outcomes, for example the direction and extent of movement of various financial indices, the winner of television competitions such as &quot;Big Brother&quot;, and election results. Interactive prediction markets also offer trading on these outcomes, with &quot;shares&quot; of results trading on an open market.

====Parimutuel betting====

One of the most widespread forms of gambling involves betting on horse or greyhound racing. Wagering may take place through parimutuel pools, or bookmakers may take bets personally. Parimutuel wagers pay off at prices determined by support in the wagering pools, while bookmakers pay off either at the odds offered at the time of accepting the bet; or at the median odds offered by track bookmakers at the time the race started.

====Sports betting====

Betting on team sports has become an important service industry in many countries. Before the advent of the internet, millions of people played the football pools every week in the United Kingdom. In addition to organized sports betting, both legal and illegal, there are many side-betting games played by casual groups of spectators, such as NCAA basketball tournament Bracket Pools, Super Bowl Squares, Fantasy Sports Leagues with monetary entry fees and winnings, and in-person spectator games like Moundball.

===Virtual sports===

Based on Sports Betting, Virtual Sports are fantasy and never played sports events made by software that can be played every time without wondering about external things like weather conditions.

===Arbitrage betting===

Arbitrage betting is a theoretically risk-free betting system in which every outcome of an event is bet upon so that a known profit will be made by the bettor upon completion of the event regardless of the outcome. Arbitrage betting is a combination of the ancient art of arbitrage trading and gambling, which has been made possible by the large numbers of bookmakers in the marketplace, creating occasional opportunities for arbitrage.

===Other types of betting===
One can also bet with another person that a statement is true or false, or that a specified event will happen (a &quot;back bet&quot;) or will not happen (a &quot;lay bet&quot;) within a specified time. This occurs in particular when two people have opposing but strongly held views on truth or events. Not only do the parties hope to gain from the bet, they place the bet also to demonstrate their certainty about the issue. Some means of determining the issue at stake must exist. Sometimes the amount bet remains nominal, demonstrating the outcome as one of principle rather than of financial importance.

Betting exchanges allow consumers to both back and lay at odds of their choice. Similar in some ways to a stock exchange, a bettor may want to back a horse (hoping it will win) or lay a horse (hoping it will lose, effectively acting as bookmaker).

Spread betting allows gamblers to wager on the outcome of an event where the pay-off is based on the accuracy of the wager, rather than a simple &quot;win or lose&quot; outcome. For example, a wager can be based on the when a point is scored in the game in minutes and each minute away from the prediction increases or reduces the payout.

==Staking systems==

Many betting systems have been created in an attempt to &quot;beat the house&quot; but no system can make a mathematically unprofitable bet in terms of expected value profitable over time. Widely used systems include:
* Card counting ‚Äì Many systems exist for blackjack to keep track of the ratio of ten values to all others; when this ratio is high the player has an advantage and should increase the amount of their bets. Keeping track of cards dealt confers an advantage in other games as well.
* Due-column betting ‚Äì A variation on fixed profits betting in which the bettor sets a target profit and then calculates a bet size that will make this profit, adding any losses to the target.
* Fixed profits ‚Äì the stakes vary based on the odds to ensure the same profit from each winning selection.
* Fixed stakes ‚Äì a traditional system of staking the same amount on each selection.
* Kelly ‚Äì the optimum level to bet to maximize your future median bank level.
* Martingale ‚Äì A system based on staking enough each time to recover losses from previous bet(s) until one wins.

==Other uses of the term==

Many risk-return choices are sometimes referred to colloquially as &quot;gambling.&quot; Whether this terminology is acceptable is a matter of debate:
* Emotional or physical risk-taking, where the risk-return ratio is not quantifiable (e.g., skydiving, campaigning for political office, asking someone for a date, etc.)
* Insurance is a method of shifting risk from one party to another. Insurers use actuarial methods to calculate appropriate premiums, which is similar to calculating gambling odds. Insurers set their premiums to obtain a long term positive expected return in the same manner that professional gamblers select which bets to make. While insurance is sometimes distinguished from gambling by the requirement of an insurable interest, the equivalent in gambling is simply betting against one&#x27;s own best interests (e.g., a sports coach betting against his own team to mitigate the financial repercussions of a losing season).
* Situations where the possible return is of secondary importance to the wager/purchase (e.g. entering a raffle in support of a charitable cause)

Investments are also usually not considered gambling, although some investments can involve significant risk. Examples of investments include stocks, bonds and real estate. Starting a business can also be considered a form of investment. Investments are generally not considered gambling when they meet the following criteria:
* Economic utility
* Positive expected returns (at least in the long term)
* Underlying value independent of the risk being undertaken

Some speculative investment activities are particularly risky, but are sometimes perceived to be different from gambling:
* Foreign currency exchange (forex) transactions
* Prediction markets
* Securities derivatives, such as options or futures, where the value of the derivative is dependent on the value of the underlying asset at a specific point in time (typically the derivative&#x27;s associated expiration date)

A &quot;&quot; or &quot;levanting&quot; characterises the act of absconding following the outcome of a bet.

==Negative consequences==

Problem gambling has multiple symptoms. Gamblers often play again to try to win back money they have lost, and some gamble to relieve feelings of helplessness and anxiety.

In the United Kingdom, the Advertising Standards Authority has censured several betting firms for advertisements disguised as news articles suggesting falsely that a person had cleared debts and paid for medical expenses by gambling online. The firms face possible fines.

A 2020 study of 32 countries found that the greater the amount of gambling activity in a given country, the more volatile that country&#x27;s stock-market prices are. Legalization of online sports betting was found to decrease household saving, decrease investment with positive expected value and increase financial distress.

==Psychological biases==
Gamblers may exhibit a number of cognitive and motivational biases that distort the perceived odds of events and that influence their preferences for gambles.
* &quot;Preference for likely outcomes&quot;. When gambles are selected through a choice process ‚Äì when people indicate which gamble they prefer from a set of gambles (e.g., win/lose, over/under) ‚Äì people tend to prefer to bet on the outcome that is more likely to occur. Bettors tend to prefer to bet on favorites in athletic competitions, and sometimes will accept even bets on favorites when offered more favorable bets on the less likely outcome (e.g., an underdog team). 
* &quot;Optimism/Desirability Bias.&quot; Gamblers also exhibit optimism, overestimating the likelihood that desired events will occur. Fans of NFL underdog teams, for example, will prefer to bet on their teams at even odds than to bet on the favorite, whether the bet is $5 or $50.
* &quot;Reluctance to bet against (hedge) desired outcomes.&quot; People are reluctant to bet against desired outcomes that are relevant to their identity. Gamblers exhibit reluctance to bet against the success of their preferred U.S. presidential candidates and Major League Baseball, National Football League, National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) basketball, and NCAA hockey teams. More than 45% of NCAA fans in Studies 5 and 6, for instance, turned down a &quot;free&quot; real $5 bet against their team. From a psychological perspective, such a &quot;hedge&quot; creates an interdependence dilemma ‚Äì a motivational conflict between a short-term monetary gain and the long-term benefits accrued from feelings of identification with and loyalty to a position, person, or group whom the bettor desires to succeed. In economic terms, this conflicted decision can be modeled as a trade-off between the outcome utility gained by hedging (e.g., money) and the diagnostic costs it incurs (e.g., disloyalty). People make inferences about their beliefs and identity from their behavior. If a person is uncertain about an aspect of their identity, such as the extent to which they value a candidate or team, hedging may signal to them that they are not as committed to that candidate or team as they originally believed. If the diagnostic cost of this self-signal and the resulting identity change are substantial, it may outweigh the outcome utility of hedging, and they may reject even very generous hedges.
* &quot;Ratio bias.&quot; Gamblers will prefer gambles with worse odds that are drawn from a large sample (e.g., drawing one red ball from an urn containing 89 red balls and 11 blue balls) to better odds that are drawn from a small sample (drawing one red ball from an urn containing 9 red balls and one blue ball).
* &quot;Gambler&#x27;s fallacy/positive recency bias.&quot;

<text>Game theory is the study of mathematical models of strategic interactions. It has applications in many fields of social science, and is used extensively in economics, logic, systems science and computer science. Initially, game theory addressed two-person zero-sum games, in which a participant&#x27;s gains or losses are exactly balanced by the losses and gains of the other participant. In the 1950s, it was extended to the study of non zero-sum games, and was eventually applied to a wide range of behavioral relations. It is now an umbrella term for the science of rational decision making in humans, animals, and computers.

Modern game theory began with the idea of mixed-strategy equilibria in two-person zero-sum games and its proof by John von Neumann. Von Neumann&#x27;s original proof used the Brouwer fixed-point theorem on continuous mappings into compact convex sets, which became a standard method in game theory and mathematical economics. His paper was followed by &quot;Theory of Games and Economic Behavior&quot; (1944), co-written with Oskar Morgenstern, which considered cooperative games of several players. The second edition provided an axiomatic theory of expected utility, which allowed mathematical statisticians and economists to treat decision-making under uncertainty.

Game theory was developed extensively in the 1950s, and was explicitly applied to evolution in the 1970s, although similar developments go back at least as far as the 1930s. Game theory has been widely recognized as an important tool in many fields. John Maynard Smith was awarded the Crafoord Prize for his application of evolutionary game theory in 1999, and fifteen game theorists have won the Nobel Prize in economics as of 2020, including most recently Paul Milgrom and Robert B. Wilson.

==History==
===Earliest results===
In 1713, a letter attributed to Charles Waldegrave, an active Jacobite and uncle to British diplomat James Waldegrave, analyzed a game called &quot;le her&quot;. Waldegrave provided a minimax mixed strategy solution to a two-person version of the card game, and the problem is now known as the Waldegrave problem.

In 1838, Antoine Augustin Cournot provided a model of competition in oligopolies. Though he did not refer to it as such, he presented a solution that is the Nash equilibrium of the game in his (&quot;Researches into the Mathematical Principles of the Theory of Wealth&quot;). In 1883, Joseph Bertrand critiqued Cournot&#x27;s model as unrealistic, providing an alternative model of price competition which would later be formalized by Francis Ysidro Edgeworth.

In 1913, Ernst Zermelo published (&quot;On an Application of Set Theory to the Theory of the Game of Chess&quot;), which proved that the optimal chess strategy is strictly determined.

===Foundation===

The work of John von Neumann established game theory as its own independent field in the early-to-mid 20th century, with von Neumann publishing his paper &quot;On the Theory of Games of Strategy&quot; in 1928. Von Neumann&#x27;s original proof used Brouwer&#x27;s fixed-point theorem on continuous mappings into compact convex sets, which became a standard method in game theory and mathematical economics. Von Neumann&#x27;s work in game theory culminated in his 1944 book &quot;Theory of Games and Economic Behavior&quot;, co-authored with Oskar Morgenstern. The second edition of this book provided an axiomatic theory of utility, which reincarnated Daniel Bernoulli&#x27;s old theory of utility (of money) as an independent discipline. This foundational work contains the method for finding mutually consistent solutions for two-person zero-sum games. Subsequent work focused primarily on cooperative game theory, which analyzes optimal strategies for groups of individuals, presuming that they can enforce agreements between them about proper strategies.

In his 1938 book and earlier notes, √âmile Borel proved a minimax theorem for two-person zero-sum matrix games only when the pay-off matrix is symmetric and provided a solution to a non-trivial infinite game (known in English as Blotto game). Borel conjectured the non-existence of mixed-strategy equilibria in finite two-person zero-sum games, a conjecture that was proved false by von Neumann.

In 1950, John Nash developed a criterion for mutual consistency of players&#x27; strategies known as the Nash equilibrium, applicable to a wider variety of games than the criterion proposed by von Neumann and Morgenstern. Nash proved that every finite n-player, non-zero-sum (not just two-player zero-sum) non-cooperative game has what is now known as a Nash equilibrium in mixed strategies.

Game theory experienced a flurry of activity in the 1950s, during which the concepts of the core, the extensive form game, fictitious play, repeated games, and the Shapley value were developed. The 1950s also saw the first applications of game theory to philosophy and political science. The first mathematical discussion of the prisoner&#x27;s dilemma appeared, and an experiment was undertaken by mathematicians Merrill M. Flood and Melvin Dresher, as part of the RAND Corporation&#x27;s investigations into game theory. RAND pursued the studies because of possible applications to global nuclear strategy.

==== Prize-winning achievements ====
In 1965, Reinhard Selten introduced his solution concept of subgame perfect equilibria, which further refined the Nash equilibrium. Later he would introduce trembling hand perfection as well. In 1994 Nash, Selten and Harsanyi became Economics Nobel Laureates for their contributions to economic game theory.

In the 1970s, game theory was extensively applied in biology, largely as a result of the work of John Maynard Smith and his evolutionarily stable strategy. In addition, the concepts of correlated equilibrium, trembling hand perfection and common knowledge were introduced and analyzed.

In 1994, John Nash was awarded the Nobel Memorial Prize in the Economic Sciences for his contribution to game theory. Nash&#x27;s most famous contribution to game theory is the concept of the Nash equilibrium, which is a solution concept for non-cooperative games, published in 1951. A Nash equilibrium is a set of strategies, one for each player, such that no player can improve their payoff by unilaterally changing their strategy.

In 2005, game theorists Thomas Schelling and Robert Aumann followed Nash, Selten, and Harsanyi as Nobel Laureates. Schelling worked on dynamic models, early examples of evolutionary game theory. Aumann contributed more to the equilibrium school, introducing equilibrium coarsening and correlated equilibria, and developing an extensive formal analysis of the assumption of common knowledge and of its consequences.

In 2007, Leonid Hurwicz, Eric Maskin, and Roger Myerson were awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics &quot;for having laid the foundations of mechanism design theory&quot;. Myerson&#x27;s contributions include the notion of proper equilibrium, and an important graduate text: &quot;Game Theory, Analysis of Conflict&quot;. Hurwicz introduced and formalized the concept of incentive compatibility.

In 2012, Alvin E. Roth and Lloyd S. Shapley were awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics &quot;for the theory of stable allocations and the practice of market design&quot;. In 2014, the Nobel went to game theorist Jean Tirole.

==Different types of games==
===Cooperative / non-cooperative===

A game is &quot;cooperative&quot; if the players are able to form binding commitments externally enforced (e.g. through contract law). A game is &quot;non-cooperative&quot; if players cannot form alliances or if all agreements need to be self-enforcing (e.g. through credible threats).

Cooperative games are often analyzed through the framework of &quot;cooperative game theory&quot;, which focuses on predicting which coalitions will form, the joint actions that groups take, and the resulting collective payoffs. It is different from &quot;non-cooperative game theory&quot; which focuses on predicting individual players&#x27; actions and payoffs by analyzing Nash equilibria.

Cooperative game theory provides a high-level approach as it describes only the structure and payoffs of coalitions, whereas non-cooperative game theory also looks at how strategic interaction will affect the distribution of payoffs. As non-cooperative game theory is more general, cooperative games can be analyzed through the approach of non-cooperative game theory (the converse does not hold) provided that sufficient assumptions are made to encompass all the possible strategies available to players due to the possibility of external enforcement of cooperation.

===Symmetric / asymmetric===
A symmetric game is a game where each player earns the same payoff when making the same choice. In other words, the identity of the player does not change the resulting game facing the other player. Many of the commonly studied 2√ó2 games are symmetric. The standard representations of chicken, the prisoner&#x27;s dilemma, and the stag hunt are all symmetric games.

The most commonly studied asymmetric games are games where there are not identical strategy sets for both players. For instance, the ultimatum game and similarly the dictator game have different strategies for each player. It is possible, however, for a game to have identical strategies for both players, yet be asymmetric. For example, the game pictured in this section&#x27;s graphic is asymmetric despite having identical strategy sets for both players.

===Zero-sum / non-zero-sum===
Zero-sum games (more generally, constant-sum games) are games in which choices by players can neither increase nor decrease the available resources. In zero-sum games, the total benefit goes to all players in a game, for every combination of strategies, and always adds to zero (more informally, a player benefits only at the equal expense of others). Poker exemplifies a zero-sum game (ignoring the possibility of the house&#x27;s cut), because one wins exactly the amount one&#x27;s opponents lose. Other zero-sum games include matching pennies and most classical board games including Go and chess.

Many games studied by game theorists (including the famed prisoner&#x27;s dilemma) are non-zero-sum games, because the outcome has net results greater or less than zero. Informally, in non-zero-sum games, a gain by one player does not necessarily correspond with a loss by another.

Furthermore, &quot;constant-sum games&quot; correspond to activities like theft and gambling, but not to the fundamental economic situation in which there are potential gains from trade. It is possible to transform any constant-sum game into a (possibly asymmetric) zero-sum game by adding a dummy player (often called &quot;the board&quot;) whose losses compensate the players&#x27; net winnings.

===Simultaneous / sequential===

Simultaneous games are games where both players move simultaneously, or instead the later players are unaware of the earlier players&#x27; actions (making them &quot;effectively&quot; simultaneous). Sequential games (a type of dynamic games) are games where players do not make decisions simultaneously, and player&#x27;s earlier actions affect the outcome and decisions of other players. This need not be perfect information about every action of earlier players; it might be very little knowledge. For instance, a player may know that an earlier player did not perform one particular action, while they do not know which of the other available actions the first player actually performed.

The difference between simultaneous and sequential games is captured in the different representations discussed above. Often, normal form is used to represent simultaneous games, while extensive form is used to represent sequential ones. The transformation of extensive to normal form is one way, meaning that multiple extensive form games correspond to the same normal form. Consequently, notions of equilibrium for simultaneous games are insufficient for reasoning about sequential games; see subgame perfection.

In short, the differences between sequential and simultaneous games are as follows:
===Perfect information and imperfect information===

An important subset of sequential games consists of games of perfect information. A game with perfect information means that all players, at every move in the game, know the previous history of the game and the moves previously made by all other players. An imperfect information game is played when the players do not know all moves already made by the opponent such as a simultaneous move game. Examples of perfect-information games include tic-tac-toe, checkers, chess, and Go.

Many card games are games of imperfect information, such as poker and bridge. Perfect information is often confused with complete information, which is a similar concept pertaining to the common knowledge of each player&#x27;s sequence, strategies, and payoffs throughout gameplay. Complete information requires that every player know the strategies and payoffs available to the other players but not necessarily the actions taken, whereas perfect information is knowledge of all aspects of the game and players. Games of incomplete information can be reduced, however, to games of imperfect information by introducing &quot;moves by nature&quot;.

=== Bayesian game ===

One of the assumptions of the Nash equilibrium is that every player has correct beliefs about the actions of the other players. However, there are many situations in game theory where participants do not fully understand the characteristics of their opponents. Negotiators may be unaware of their opponent&#x27;s valuation of the object of negotiation, companies may be unaware of their opponent&#x27;s cost functions, combatants may be unaware of their opponent&#x27;s strengths, and jurors may be unaware of their colleague&#x27;s interpretation of the evidence at trial. In some cases, participants may know the character of their opponent well, but may not know how well their opponent knows his or her own character.

Bayesian game means a strategic game with incomplete information. For a strategic game, decision makers are players, and every player has a group of actions. A core part of the imperfect information specification is the set of states. Every state completely describes a collection of characteristics relevant to the player such as their preferences and details about them. There must be a state for every set of features that some player believes may exist.

For example, where Player 1 is unsure whether Player 2 would rather date her or get away from her, while Player 2 understands Player 1&#x27;s preferences as before. To be specific, supposing that Player 1 believes that Player 2 wants to date her under a probability of 1/2 and get away from her under a probability of 1/2 (this evaluation comes from Player 1&#x27;s experience probably: she faces players who want to date her half of the time in such a case and players who want to avoid her half of the time). Due to the probability involved, the analysis of this situation requires to understand the player&#x27;s preference for the draw, even though people are only interested in pure strategic equilibrium.

=== Combinatorial games ===
Games in which the difficulty of finding an optimal strategy stems from the multiplicity of possible moves are called combinatorial games. Examples include chess and Go. Games that involve imperfect information may also have a strong combinatorial character, for instance backgammon. There is no unified theory addressing combinatorial elements in games. There are, however, mathematical tools that can solve some particular problems and answer some general questions.

Games of perfect information have been studied in combinatorial game theory, which has developed novel representations, e.g. surreal numbers, as well as combinatorial and algebraic (and sometimes non-constructive) proof methods to solve games of certain types, including &quot;loopy&quot; games that may result in infinitely long sequences of moves. These methods address games with higher combinatorial complexity than those usually considered in traditional (or &quot;economic&quot;) game theory. A typical game that has been solved this way is Hex. A related field of study, drawing from computational complexity theory, is game complexity, which is concerned with estimating the computational difficulty of finding optimal strategies.

Research in artificial intelligence has addressed both perfect and imperfect information games that have very complex combinatorial structures (like chess, go, or backgammon) for which no provable optimal strategies have been found. The practical solutions involve computational heuristics, like alpha‚Äìbeta pruning or use of artificial neural networks trained by reinforcement learning, which make games more tractable in computing practice.

===Discrete and continuous games===
Much of game theory is concerned with finite, discrete games that have a finite number of players, moves, events, outcomes, etc. Many concepts can be extended, however. Continuous games allow players to choose a strategy from a continuous strategy set. For instance, Cournot competition is typically modeled with players&#x27; strategies being any non-negative quantities, including fractional quantities.

===Differential games===

Differential games such as the continuous pursuit and evasion game are continuous games where the evolution of the players&#x27; state variables is governed by differential equations. The problem of finding an optimal strategy in a differential game is closely related to the optimal control theory. In particular, there are two types of strategies: the open-loop strategies are found using the Pontryagin maximum principle while the closed-loop strategies are found using Bellman&#x27;s Dynamic Programming method.

A particular case of differential games are the games with a random time horizon. In such games, the terminal time is a random variable with a given probability distribution function. Therefore, the players maximize the mathematical expectation of the cost function. It was shown that the modified optimization problem can be reformulated as a discounted differential game over an infinite time interval.

===Evolutionary game theory===

Evolutionary game theory studies players who adjust their strategies over time according to rules that are not necessarily rational or farsighted. In general, the evolution of strategies over time according to such rules is modeled as a Markov chain with a state variable such as the current strategy profile or how the game has been played in the recent past. Such rules may feature imitation, optimization, or survival of the fittest.

In biology, such models can represent evolution, in which offspring adopt their parents&#x27; strategies and parents who play more successful strategies (i.e. corresponding to higher payoffs) have a greater number of offspring. In the social sciences, such models typically represent strategic adjustment by players who play a game many times within their lifetime and, consciously or unconsciously, occasionally adjust their strategies.

===Stochastic outcomes (and relation to other fields)===
Individual decision problems with stochastic outcomes are sometimes considered &quot;one-player games&quot;. They may be modeled using similar tools within the related disciplines of decision theory, operations research, and areas of artificial intelligence, particularly AI planning (with uncertainty) and multi-agent system. Although these fields may have different motivators, the mathematics involved are substantially the same, e.g. using Markov decision processes (MDP).

Stochastic outcomes can also be modeled in terms of game theory by adding a randomly acting player who makes &quot;chance moves&quot; (&quot;moves by nature&quot;). This player is not typically considered a third player in what is otherwise a two-player game, but merely serves to provide a roll of the dice where required by the game.

For some problems, different approaches to modeling stochastic outcomes may lead to different solutions. For example, the difference in approach between MDPs and the minimax solution is that the latter considers the worst-case over a set of adversarial moves, rather than reasoning in expectation about these moves given a fixed probability distribution. The minimax approach may be advantageous where stochastic models of uncertainty are not available, but may also be overestimating extremely unlikely (but costly) events, dramatically swaying the strategy in such scenarios if it is assumed that an adversary can force such an event to happen. (See Black swan theory for more discussion on this kind of modeling issue, particularly as it relates to predicting and limiting losses in investment banking.)

General models that include all elements of stochastic outcomes, adversaries, and partial or noisy observability (of moves by other players) have also been studied. The &quot;gold standard&quot; is considered to be partially observable stochastic game (POSG), but few realistic problems are computationally feasible in POSG representation.

===Metagames===
These are games the play of which is the development of the rules for another game, the target or subject game. Metagames seek to maximize the utility value of the rule set developed. The theory of metagames is related to mechanism design theory.

The term metagame analysis is also used to refer to a practical approach developed by Nigel Howard, whereby a situation is framed as a strategic game in which stakeholders try to realize their objectives by means of the options available to them. Subsequent developments have led to the formulation of confrontation analysis.

===Mean field game theory===

Mean field game theory is the study of strategic decision making in very large populations of small interacting agents. This class of problems was considered in the economics literature by Boyan Jovanovic and Robert W. Rosenthal, in the engineering literature by Peter E. Caines, and by mathematicians Pierre-Louis Lions and Jean-Michel Lasry.

==Representation of games==

The games studied in game theory are well-defined mathematical objects. To be fully defined, a game must specify the following elements: the &quot;players&quot; of the game, the &quot;information&quot; and &quot;actions&quot; available to each player at each decision point, and the &quot;payoffs&quot; for each outcome. (Eric Rasmusen refers to these four &quot;essential elements&quot; by the acronym &quot;PAPI&quot;.) A game theorist typically uses these elements, along with a solution concept of their choosing, to deduce a set of equilibrium strategies for each player such that, when these strategies are employed, no player can profit by unilaterally deviating from their strategy. These equilibrium strategies determine an equilibrium to the game‚Äîa stable state in which either one outcome occurs or a set of outcomes occur with known probability.

Most cooperative games are presented in the characteristic function form, while the extensive and the normal forms are used to define noncooperative games.

===Extensive form===
The extensive form can be used to formalize games with a time sequencing of moves. Extensive form games can be visualized using game trees (as pictured here). Here each vertex (or node) represents a point of choice for a player. The player is specified by a number listed by the vertex. The lines out of the vertex represent a possible action for that player. The payoffs are specified at the bottom of the tree. The extensive form can be viewed as a multi-player generalization of a decision tree. To solve any extensive form game, backward induction must be used. It involves working backward up the game tree to determine what a rational player would do at the last vertex of the tree, what the player with the previous move would do given that the player with the last move is rational, and so on until the first vertex of the tree is reached.

The game pictured consists of two players. The way this particular game is structured (i.e., with sequential decision making and perfect information), &quot;Player 1&quot; &quot;moves&quot; first by choosing either or (fair or unfair). Next in the sequence, &quot;Player 2&quot;, who has now observed &quot;Player 1&quot;‚Ä≥s move, can choose to play either or (accept or reject). Once &quot;Player 2&quot; has made their choice, the game is considered finished and each player gets their respective payoff, represented in the image as two numbers, where the first number represents Player 1&#x27;s payoff, and the second number represents Player 2&#x27;s payoff. Suppose that &quot;Player 1&quot; chooses and then &quot;Player 2&quot; chooses : &quot;Player 1&quot; then gets a payoff of &quot;eight&quot; (which in real-world terms can be interpreted in many ways, the simplest of which is in terms of money but could mean things such as eight days of vacation or eight countries conquered or even eight more opportunities to play the same game against other players) and &quot;Player 2&quot; gets a payoff of &quot;two&quot;.

The extensive form can also capture simultaneous-move games and games with imperfect information. To represent it, either a dotted line connects different vertices to represent them as being part of the same information set (i.e. the players do not know at which point they are), or a closed line is drawn around them. (See example in the imperfect information section.)

===Normal form===

The normal (or strategic form) game is usually represented by a matrix which shows the players, strategies, and payoffs (see the example to the right). More generally it can be represented by any function that associates a payoff for each player with every possible combination of actions. In the accompanying example there are two players; one chooses the row and the other chooses the column. Each player has two strategies, which are specified by the number of rows and the number of columns. The payoffs are provided in the interior. The first number is the payoff received by the row player (Player 1 in our example); the second is the payoff for the column player (Player 2 in our example). Suppose that Player 1 plays &quot;Up&quot; and that Player 2 plays &quot;Left&quot;. Then Player 1 gets a payoff of 4, and Player 2 gets 3.

When a game is presented in normal form, it is presumed that each player acts simultaneously or, at least, without knowing the actions of the other. If players have some information about the choices of other players, the game is usually presented in extensive form.

Every extensive-form game has an equivalent normal-form game, however, the transformation to normal form may result in an exponential blowup in the size of the representation, making it computationally impractical.

===Characteristic function form===

In cooperative game theory the characteristic function lists the payoff of each coalition. The origin of this formulation is in John von Neumann and Oskar Morgenstern&#x27;s book.

Formally, a characteristic function is a function formula_1 from the set of all possible coalitions of players to a set of payments, and also satisfies formula_2. The function describes how much collective payoff a set of players can gain by forming a coalition.

===Alternative game representations===
Alternative game representation forms are used for some subclasses of games or adjusted to the needs of interdisciplinary research. In addition to classical game representations, some of the alternative representations also encode time related aspects.
==General and applied uses==
As a method of applied mathematics, game theory has been used to study a wide variety of human and animal behaviors. It was initially developed in economics to understand a large collection of economic behaviors, including behaviors of firms, markets, and consumers. The first use of game-theoretic analysis was by Antoine Augustin Cournot in 1838 with his solution of the Cournot duopoly. The use of game theory in the social sciences has expanded, and game theory has been applied to political, sociological, and psychological behaviors as well.

Although pre-twentieth-century naturalists such as Charles Darwin made game-theoretic kinds of statements, the use of game-theoretic analysis in biology began with Ronald Fisher&#x27;s studies of animal behavior during the 1930s. This work predates the name &quot;game theory&quot;, but it shares many important features with this field. The developments in economics were later applied to biology largely by John Maynard Smith in his 1982 book &quot;Evolution and the Theory of Games&quot;.

In addition to being used to describe, predict, and explain behavior, game theory has also been used to develop theories of ethical or normative behavior and to prescribe such behavior. In economics and philosophy, scholars have applied game theory to help in the understanding of good or proper behavior. Game-theoretic approaches have also been suggested in the philosophy of language and philosophy of science. Game-theoretic arguments of this type can be found as far back as Plato. An alternative version of game theory, called chemical game theory, represents the player&#x27;s choices as metaphorical chemical reactant molecules called &quot;knowlecules&quot;. ¬†Chemical game theory then calculates the outcomes as equilibrium solutions to a system of chemical reactions.

===Description and modeling===

The primary use of game theory is to describe and model how human populations behave. Some scholars believe that by finding the equilibria of games they can predict how actual human populations will behave when confronted with situations analogous to the game being studied. This particular view of game theory has been criticized. It is argued that the assumptions made by game theorists are often violated when applied to real-world situations. Game theorists usually assume players act rationally, but in practice, human rationality and/or behavior often deviates from the model of rationality as used in game theory. Game theorists respond by comparing their assumptions to those used in physics. Thus while their assumptions do not always hold, they can treat game theory as a reasonable scientific ideal akin to the models used by physicists. However, empirical work has shown that in some classic games, such as the centipede game, guess 2/3 of the average game, and the dictator game, people regularly do not play Nash equilibria. There is an ongoing debate regarding the importance of these experiments and whether the analysis of the experiments fully captures all aspects of the relevant situation.

Some game theorists, following the work of John Maynard Smith and George R. Price, have turned to evolutionary game theory in order to resolve these issues. These models presume either no rationality or bounded rationality on the part of players. Despite the name, evolutionary game theory does not necessarily presume natural selection in the biological sense. Evolutionary game theory includes both biological as well as cultural evolution and also models of individual learning (for example, fictitious play dynamics).

===Prescriptive or normative analysis===

Some scholars see game theory not as a predictive tool for the behavior of human beings, but as a suggestion for how people ought to behave. Since a strategy, corresponding to a Nash equilibrium of a game constitutes one&#x27;s best response to the actions of the other players ‚Äì provided they are in (the same) Nash equilibrium ‚Äì playing a strategy that is part of a Nash equilibrium seems appropriate. This normative use of game theory has also come under criticism.
=== Economics ===
Game theory is a major method used in mathematical economics and business for modeling competing behaviors of interacting agents. Applications include a wide array of economic phenomena and approaches, such as auctions, bargaining, mergers and acquisitions pricing, fair division, duopolies, oligopolies, social network formation, agent-based computational economics, general equilibrium, mechanism design, and voting systems; and across such broad areas as experimental economics, behavioral economics, information economics, industrial organization, and political economy.

This research usually focuses on particular sets of strategies known as &quot;solution concepts&quot; or &quot;equilibria&quot;. A common assumption is that players act rationally. In non-cooperative games, the most famous of these is the Nash equilibrium. A set of strategies is a Nash equilibrium if each represents a best response to the other strategies. If all the players are playing the strategies in a Nash equilibrium, they have no unilateral incentive to deviate, since their strategy is the best they can do given what others are doing.

The payoffs of the game are generally taken to represent the utility of individual players.

A prototypical paper on game theory in economics begins by presenting a game that is an abstraction of a particular economic situation. One or more solution concepts are chosen, and the author demonstrates which strategy sets in the presented game are equilibria of the appropriate type. Economists and business professors suggest two primary uses (noted above): &quot;descriptive&quot; and &quot;prescriptive&quot;.

==== Managerial economics ====
Game theory also has an extensive use in a specific branch or stream of economics ‚Äì Managerial Economics. One important usage of it in the field of managerial economics is in analyzing strategic interactions between firms. For example, firms may be competing in a market with limited resources, and game theory can help managers understand how their decisions impact their competitors and the overall market outcomes. Game theory can also be used to analyze cooperation between firms, such as in forming strategic alliances or joint ventures. Another use of game theory in managerial economics is in analyzing pricing strategies. For example, firms may use game theory to determine the optimal pricing strategy based on how they expect their competitors to respond to their pricing decisions. Overall, game theory serves as a useful tool for analyzing strategic interactions and decision making in the context of managerial economics.

=== Business ===
The Chartered Institute of Procurement &amp; Supply (CIPS) promotes knowledge and use of game theory within the context of business procurement. CIPS and TWS Partners have conducted a series of surveys designed to explore the understanding, awareness and application of game theory among procurement professionals. Some of the main findings in their third annual survey (2019) include:
*application of game theory to procurement activity has increased ‚Äì at the time it was at 19% across all survey respondents
*65% of participants predict that use of game theory applications will grow
*70% of respondents say that they have &quot;only a basic or a below basic understanding&quot; of game theory
*20% of participants had undertaken on-the-job training in game theory
*50% of respondents said that new or improved software solutions were desirable
*90% of respondents said that they do not have the software they need for their work.

===Project management===

Sensible decision-making is critical for the success of projects. In project management, game theory is used to model the decision-making process of players, such as investors, project managers, contractors, sub-contractors, governments and customers. Quite often, these players have competing interests, and sometimes their interests are directly detrimental to other players, making project management scenarios well-suited to be modeled by game theory.

Piraveenan (2019) in his review provides several examples where game theory is used to model project management scenarios. For instance, an investor typically has several investment options, and each option will likely result in a different project, and thus one of the investment options has to be chosen before the project charter can be produced. Similarly, any large project involving subcontractors, for instance, a construction project, has a complex interplay between the main contractor (the project manager) and subcontractors, or among the subcontractors themselves, which typically has several decision points. For example, if there is an ambiguity in the contract between the contractor and subcontractor, each must decide how hard to push their case without jeopardizing the whole project, and thus their own stake in it. Similarly, when projects from competing organizations are launched, the marketing personnel have to decide what is the best timing and strategy to market the project, or its resultant product or service, so that it can gain maximum traction in the face of competition. In each of these scenarios, the required decisions depend on the decisions of other players who, in some way, have competing interests to the interests of the decision-maker, and thus can ideally be modeled using game theory.

Piraveenan summarizes that two-player games are predominantly used to model project management scenarios, and based on the identity of these players, five distinct types of games are used in project management.

* Government-sector‚Äìprivate-sector games (games that model public‚Äìprivate partnerships)
* Contractor‚Äìcontractor games
* Contractor‚Äìsubcontractor games
* Subcontractor‚Äìsubcontractor games
* Games involving other players

In terms of types of games, both cooperative as well as non-cooperative, normal-form as well as extensive-form, and zero-sum as well as non-zero-sum are used to model various project management scenarios.

===Political science===

The application of game theory to political science is focused in the overlapping areas of fair division, political economy, public choice, war bargaining, positive political theory, and social choice theory. In each of these areas, researchers have developed game-theoretic models in which the players are often voters, states, special interest groups, and politicians.

Early examples of game theory applied to political science are provided by Anthony Downs. In his 1957 book &quot;An Economic Theory of Democracy&quot;, he applies the Hotelling firm location model to the political process. In the Downsian model, political candidates commit to ideologies on a one-dimensional policy space. Downs first shows how the political candidates will converge to the ideology preferred by the median voter if voters are fully informed, but then argues that voters choose to remain rationally ignorant which allows for candidate divergence. Game theory was applied in 1962 to the Cuban Missile Crisis during the presidency of John F. Kennedy.

It has also been proposed that game theory explains the stability of any form of political government. Taking the simplest case of a monarchy, for example, the king, being only one person, does not and cannot maintain his authority by personally exercising physical control over all or even any significant number of his subjects. Sovereign control is instead explained by the recognition by each citizen that all other citizens expect each other to view the king (or other established government) as the person whose orders will be followed. Coordinating communication among citizens to replace the sovereign is effectively barred, since conspiracy to replace the sovereign is generally punishable as a crime. Thus, in a process that can be modeled by variants of the prisoner&#x27;s dilemma, during periods of stability no citizen will find it rational to move to replace the sovereign, even if all the citizens know they would be better off if they were all to act collectively.

A game-theoretic explanation for democratic peace is that public and open debate in democracies sends clear and reliable information regarding their intentions to other states. In contrast, it is difficult to know the intentions of nondemocratic leaders, what effect concessions will have, and if promises will be kept. Thus there will be mistrust and unwillingness to make concessions if at least one of the parties in a dispute is a non-democracy.

However, game theory predicts that two countries may still go to war even if their leaders are cognizant of the costs of fighting. War may result from asymmetric information; two countries may have incentives to mis-represent the amount of military resources they have on hand, rendering them unable to settle disputes agreeably without resorting to fighting. Moreover, war may arise because of commitment problems: if two countries wish to settle a dispute via peaceful means, but each wishes to go back on the terms of that settlement, they may have no choice but to resort to warfare. Finally, war may result from issue indivisibilities.

Game theory could also help predict a nation&#x27;s responses when there is a new rule or law to be applied to that nation. One example is Peter John Wood&#x27;s (2013) research looking into what nations could do to help reduce climate change. Wood thought this could be accomplished by making treaties with other nations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. However, he concluded that this idea could not work because it would create a prisoner&#x27;s dilemma for the nations.

=== Defence science and technology ===

Game theory has been used extensively to model decision-making scenarios relevant to defence applications. Most studies that has applied game theory in defence settings are concerned with Command and Control Warfare, and can be further classified into studies dealing with (i) Resource Allocation Warfare (ii) Information Warfare (iii) Weapons Control Warfare, and (iv) Adversary Monitoring Warfare. Many of the problems studied are concerned with sensing and tracking, for example a surface ship trying to track a hostile submarine and the submarine trying to evade being tracked, and the interdependent decision making that takes place with regards to bearing, speed, and the sensor technology activated by both vessels.

The tool, for example, automates the transformation of public vulnerability data into models, allowing defenders to synthesize optimal defence strategies through Stackelberg equilibrium analysis. This approach enhances cyber resilience by enabling defenders to anticipate and counteract attackers‚Äô best responses, making game theory increasingly relevant in adversarial cybersecurity environments.

Ho et al. provide a broad summary of game theory applications in defence, highlighting its advantages and limitations across both physical and cyber domains.

=== Biology ===

Unlike those in economics, the payoffs for games in biology are often interpreted as corresponding to fitness. In addition, the focus has been less on equilibria that correspond to a notion of rationality and more on ones that would be maintained by evolutionary forces. The best-known equilibrium in biology is known as the &quot;evolutionarily stable strategy&quot; (ESS), first introduced in . Although its initial motivation did not involve any of the mental requirements of the Nash equilibrium, every ESS is a Nash equilibrium.

In biology, game theory has been used as a model to understand many different phenomena. It was first used to explain the evolution (and stability) of the approximate 1:1 sex ratios. suggested that the 1:1 sex ratios are a result of evolutionary forces acting on individuals who could be seen as trying to maximize their number of grandchildren.

Additionally, biologists have used evolutionary game theory and the ESS to explain the emergence of animal communication. The analysis of signaling games and other communication games has provided insight into the evolution of communication among animals. For example, the mobbing behavior of many species, in which a large number of prey animals attack a larger predator, seems to be an example of spontaneous emergent organization. Ants have also been shown to exhibit feed-forward behavior akin to fashion (see Paul Ormerod&#x27;s &quot;Butterfly Economics&quot;).

Biologists have used the game of chicken to analyze fighting behavior and territoriality.

According to Maynard Smith, in the preface to &quot;Evolution and the Theory of Games&quot;, &quot;paradoxically, it has turned out that game theory is more readily applied to biology than to the field of economic behaviour for which it was originally designed&quot;. Evolutionary game theory has been used to explain many seemingly incongruous phenomena in nature.

One such phenomenon is known as biological altruism. This is a situation in which an organism appears to act in a way that benefits other organisms and is detrimental to itself. This is distinct from traditional notions of altruism because such actions are not conscious, but appear to be evolutionary adaptations to increase overall fitness. Examples can be found in species ranging from vampire bats that regurgitate blood they have obtained from a night&#x27;s hunting and give it to group members who have failed to feed, to worker bees that care for the queen bee for their entire lives and never mate, to vervet monkeys that warn group members of a predator&#x27;s approach, even when it endangers that individual&#x27;s chance of survival. All of these actions increase the overall fitness of a group, but occur at a cost to the individual.

Evolutionary game theory explains this altruism with the idea of kin selection. Altruists discriminate between the individuals they help and favor relatives. Hamilton&#x27;s rule explains the evolutionary rationale behind this selection with the equation , where the cost to the altruist must be less than the benefit to the recipient multiplied by the coefficient of relatedness . The more closely related two organisms are causes the incidences of altruism to increase because they share many of the same alleles. This means that the altruistic individual, by ensuring that the alleles of its close relative are passed on through survival of its offspring, can forgo the option of having offspring itself because the same number of alleles are passed on. For example, helping a sibling (in diploid animals) has a coefficient of , because (on average) an individual shares half of the alleles in its sibling&#x27;s offspring. Ensuring that enough of a sibling&#x27;s offspring survive to adulthood precludes the necessity of the altruistic individual producing offspring. The coefficient values depend heavily on the scope of the playing field; for example if the choice of whom to favor includes all genetic living things, not just all relatives, we assume the discrepancy between all humans only accounts for approximately 1% of the diversity in the playing field, a coefficient that was in the smaller field becomes 0.995. Similarly if it is considered that information other than that of a genetic nature (e.g. epigenetics, religion, science, etc.) persisted through time the playing field becomes larger still, and the discrepancies smaller.

===Computer science and logic===
Game theory has come to play an increasingly important role in logic and in computer science. Several logical theories have a basis in game semantics. In addition, computer scientists have used games to model interactive computations. Also, game theory provides a theoretical basis to the field of multi-agent systems.

Separately, game theory has played a role in online algorithms; in particular, the -server problem, which has in the past been referred to as &quot;games with moving costs&quot; and &quot;request-answer games&quot;. Yao&#x27;s principle is a game-theoretic technique for proving lower bounds on the computational complexity of randomized algorithms, especially online algorithms.

The emergence of the Internet has motivated the development of algorithms for finding equilibria in games, markets, computational auctions, peer-to-peer systems, and security and information markets. Algorithmic game theory and within it algorithmic mechanism design combine computational algorithm design and analysis of complex systems with economic theory.

Game theory has multiple applications in the field of artificial intelligence and machine learning. It is often used in developing autonomous systems that can make complex decisions in uncertain environment. Some other areas of application of game theory in AI/ML context are as follows - multi-agent system formation, reinforcement learning, mechanism design etc. By using game theory to model the behavior of other agents and anticipate their actions, AI/ML systems can make better decisions and operate more effectively.

===Philosophy===

Game theory has been put to several uses in philosophy. Responding to two papers by , used game theory to develop a philosophical account of convention. In so doing, he provided the first analysis of common knowledge and employed it in analyzing play in coordination games. In addition, he first suggested that one can understand meaning in terms of signaling games. This later suggestion has been pursued by several philosophers since Lewis. Following game-theoretic account of conventions, Edna Ullmann-Margalit (1977) and Bicchieri (2006) have developed theories of social norms that define them as Nash equilibria that result from transforming a mixed-motive game into a coordination game.

Game theory has also challenged philosophers to think in terms of interactive epistemology: what it means for a collective to have common beliefs or knowledge, and what are the consequences of this knowledge for the social outcomes resulting from the interactions of agents. Philosophers who have worked in this area include Bicchieri (1989, 1993), Skyrms (1990), and Stalnaker (1999).

The synthesis of game theory with ethics was championed by R. B. Braithwaite. The hope was that rigorous mathematical analysis of game theory might help formalize the more imprecise philosophical discussions. However, this expectation was only materialized to a limited extent.

In ethics, some (most notably David Gauthier, Gregory Kavka, and Jean Hampton) authors have attempted to pursue Thomas Hobbes&#x27; project of deriving morality from self-interest. Since games like the prisoner&#x27;s dilemma present an apparent conflict between morality and self-interest, explaining why cooperation is required by self-interest is an important component of this project. This general strategy is a component of the general social contract view in political philosophy (for examples, see and ).

Other authors have attempted to use evolutionary game theory in order to explain the emergence of human attitudes about morality and corresponding animal behaviors. These authors look at several games including the prisoner&#x27;s dilemma, stag hunt, and the Nash bargaining game as providing an explanation for the emergence of attitudes about morality (see, e.g., and ).

===Epidemiology===
Since the decision to take a vaccine for a particular disease is often made by individuals, who may consider a range of factors and parameters in making this decision (such as the incidence and prevalence of the disease, perceived and real risks associated with contracting the disease, mortality rate, perceived and real risks associated with vaccination, and financial cost of vaccination), game theory has been used to model and predict vaccination uptake in a society.

==Well known examples of games==
===Prisoner&#x27;s dilemma===
William Poundstone described the game in his 1993 book Prisoner&#x27;s Dilemma:

Two members of a criminal gang, A and B, are arrested and imprisoned. Each prisoner is in solitary confinement with no means of communication with their partner. The principal charge would lead to a sentence of ten years in prison; however, the police do not have the evidence for a conviction. They plan to sentence both to two years in prison on a lesser charge but offer each prisoner a Faustian bargain: If one of them confesses to the crime of the principal charge, betraying the other, they will be pardoned and free to leave while the other must serve the entirety of the sentence instead of just two years for the lesser charge.

The dominant strategy (and therefore the best response to any possible opponent strategy), is to betray the other, which aligns with the sure-thing principle. However, both prisoners staying silent would yield a greater reward for both of them than mutual betrayal.

===Battle of the sexes ===
The &quot;battle of the sexes&quot; is a term used to describe the perceived conflict between men and women in various areas of life, such as relationships, careers, and social roles. This conflict is often portrayed in popular culture, such as movies and television shows, as a humorous or dramatic competition between the genders. This conflict can be depicted in a game theory framework. This is an example of non-cooperative games.

An example of the &quot;battle of the sexes&quot; can be seen in the portrayal of relationships in popular media, where men and women are often depicted as being fundamentally different and in conflict with each other. For instance, in some romantic comedies, the male and female protagonists are shown as having opposing views on love and relationships, and they have to overcome these differences in order to be together.

In this game, there are two pure strategy Nash equilibria: one where both the players choose the same strategy and the other where the players choose different options. If the game is played in mixed strategies, where each player chooses their strategy randomly, then there is an infinite number of Nash equilibria. However, in the context of the &quot;battle of the sexes&quot; game, the assumption is usually made that the game is played in pure strategies.

===Ultimatum game===

The ultimatum game is a game that has become a popular instrument of economic experiments. An early description is by Nobel laureate John Harsanyi in 1961.

One player, the proposer, is endowed with a sum of money. The proposer is tasked with splitting it with another player, the responder (who knows what the total sum is). Once the proposer communicates his decision, the responder may accept it or reject it. If the responder accepts, the money is split per the proposal; if the responder rejects, both players receive nothing. Both players know in advance the consequences of the responder accepting or rejecting the offer. The game demonstrates how social acceptance, fairness, and generosity influence the players decisions.

Ultimatum game has a variant, that is the dictator game. They are mostly identical, except in dictator game the responder has no power to reject the proposer&#x27;s offer.

===Trust game===
The Trust Game is an experiment designed to measure trust in economic decisions. It is also called &quot;the investment game&quot; and is designed to investigate trust and demonstrate its importance rather than &quot;rationality&quot; of self-interest. The game was designed by Berg Joyce, John Dickhaut and Kevin McCabe in 1995.

In the game, one player (the investor) is given a sum of money and must decide how much of it to give to another player (the trustee). The amount given is then tripled by the experimenter. The trustee then decides how much of the tripled amount to return to the investor. If the recipient is completely self interested, then he/she should return nothing. However that is not true as the experiment conduct. The outcome suggest that people are willing to place a trust, by risking some amount of money, in the belief that there would be reciprocity.

=== Cournot Competition ===

The Cournot competition model involves players choosing quantity of a homogenous product to produce independently and simultaneously, where marginal cost can be different for each firm and the firm&#x27;s payoff is profit. The production costs are public information and the firm aims to find their profit-maximizing quantity based on what they believe the other firm will produce and behave like monopolies. In this game firms want to produce at the monopoly quantity but there is a high incentive to deviate and produce more, which decreases the market-clearing price. For example, firms may be tempted to deviate from the monopoly quantity if there is a low monopoly quantity and high price, with the aim of increasing production to maximize profit. However this option does not provide the highest payoff, as a firm&#x27;s ability to maximize profits depends on its market share and the elasticity of the market demand. The Cournot equilibrium is reached when each firm operates on their reaction function with no incentive to deviate, as they have the best response based on the other firms output. Within the game, firms reach the Nash equilibrium when the Cournot equilibrium is achieved. 
=== Bertrand Competition ===

The Bertrand competition assumes homogenous products and a constant marginal cost and players choose the prices. The equilibrium of price competition is where the price is equal to marginal costs, assuming complete information about the competitors&#x27; costs. Therefore, the firms have an incentive to deviate from the equilibrium because a homogenous product with a lower price will gain all of the market share, known as a cost advantage.

<text>The demography of Germany is monitored by the &quot;Statistisches Bundesamt&quot; (Federal Statistical Office of Germany). According to the most recent data, Germany&#x27;s population is 83,456,045 (31 December 2023) making it the most populous country in the European Union and the nineteenth-most populous country in the world. The total fertility rate was rated at 1.58 in 2021, significantly below the replacement rate of 2.1. For a long time Germany had one of the world&#x27;s lowest fertility rates of around 1.3 to 1.4. However there has been a small increase in recent years. Due to the low birth rate Germany has recorded more deaths than births every year since 1972, which means 2021 was the 50th consecutive year the German population would have decreased without immigration. However, due to immigration the population has actually increased during the last half-century. In 2019 the number of people with a foreign background was 26%; this category includes foreigners, naturalized citizens, ethnic German repatriates from Eastern Europe and the children of all of the above.

Until the early 20th century Germany was also a large emigrant nation; in the 19th century more than 5 million citizens of the German Empire emigrated to the US alone, and in the early 20th century Germany lost another two million to the US as well as significant numbers to Latin America, Canada and Eastern Europe. However, after World War II immigration began to outweigh emigration, as around 14 million ethnic Germans were expelled from the former eastern provinces of the Reich and other areas in Eastern Europe. Of these, roughly 12 million made their way to present-day Germany and several hundred thousand settled in Austria and other countries, while several hundred thousand died. Some additional 4.5 million ethnic Germans from Eastern Europe repatriated after 1950, especially around the end of the Eastern Bloc and mostly from the former Soviet Union, Poland and Romania.

Large-scale immigration to West Germany began during the time of the Wirtschaftswunder from the 1950s to early 1970s when Germany had a shortage of workers and let in Southern Europeans from countries like Turkey, Italy and Spain on a temporary basis as guest workers. The liberalisation of guest worker legislation allowed many to stay and build a life in West Germany. Germany saw another large wave of immigration towards the end of the 20th century, driven by German reunification, refugee inflows from the Yugoslav Wars and large numbers of Turkish nationals seeking asylum. The next large immigration wave began after eastern expansion of the European Union in 2011 as Eastern Europeans were now allowed to live and work in Germany without a visa. During the European migrant crisis of 2015 Germany took in a large number of refugees, both in absolute terms and relative to other EU member states; the country recorded 476,649 asylum seekers in 2015, 745,545 in 2016 and declining numbers thereafter.

Germany has one of the world&#x27;s highest levels of education, technological development, and economic productivity. Since the end of World War II, the number of students entering university has more than tripled, and the trade and technical schools are among the world&#x27;s best. With a per capita income of about ‚Ç¨40,883 in 2018, Germany is a broadly middle-class society. However, there has been a strong increase in the number of children living in poverty. In 1965, one in 75 children was on the welfare rolls; but by 2007 this had increased to one child in six. These children live in relative poverty, but not necessarily in absolute poverty. Millions of Germans travel overseas each year. The social welfare system provides for universal health care, unemployment compensation, child benefits and other social programmes. Germany&#x27;s aging population and struggling economy strained the welfare system in the 1990s. So the government adopted a wide-ranging programme of ‚Äì still controversial ‚Äì belt-tightening reforms, Agenda 2010, including the labour-market reforms known as Hartz concept.

== History ==

===1945‚Äì1990===
After the World War II border shifts and expulsions, the Germans from Central and Eastern Europe and the former eastern territories moved westward to post-war Germany. During the partition of Germany, many Germans from East Germany fled to West Germany for political and economic reasons. Since Germany&#x27;s reunification, there are ongoing migrations from the eastern &quot;New L√§nder&quot; to the western &quot;Old L√§nder&quot; for economic reasons.

The Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic followed different paths when it came to demographics. The politics of the German Democratic Republic was pronatalistic while that of the Federal Republic was compensatory.

Fertility in the GDR was higher than that in the FRG. Demographic politics was only one of the reasons. Women in the GDR had fewer &quot;biographic options&quot;. Young motherhood was expected of them. State funded cost-free childcare was available to all mothers.

===1990‚Äìtoday===
About 1.7 million people have left the new federal states (the East) since the fall of the Berlin Wall, or 12% of the population; a disproportionately high number of them were women under 35.

After 1990, the total fertility rate (TFR) in the East dropped to 0.772 in 1994. This has been attributed to a &quot;demographic shock&quot;: people not only had fewer children, they were also less likely to marry or divorce after the end of the GDR; the biographic options of the citizens of the former GDR had increased. Young motherhood seemed to be less attractive and the age of the first birth rose sharply.

In the following years, the TFR in the East started to rise again, surpassing 1.0 in 1997 and 1.3 in 2004, and reaching the West&#x27;s TFR (1.37) in 2007. In 2010, the East&#x27;s fertility rate (1.459) clearly exceeded that of the West (1.385), while Germany&#x27;s overall TFR had risen to 1.393, the highest value since 1990, which was still far below the natural replacement rate of 2.1 and the birth rates seen under communism. In 2016, the TFR was 1.64 in the East and 1.60 in the West.

Between 1989 and 2009, about 2,000 schools closed because there were fewer children.

In some regions the number of women between the ages of 20 and 30 has dropped by more than 30%. In 2004, in the age group 18‚Äì29 (statistically important for starting families) there were only 90 women for every 100 men in the new federal states (the East, including Berlin).

Until 2007 family politics in the federal republic was compensatory, which means that poor families received more family benefits (such as the &quot;Erziehungsgeld&quot;) than rich ones. In 2007 the so-called &quot;Elterngeld&quot; was introduced. According to Christoph Butterwegge the Elterngeld was meant to &quot;motivate highly educated women to have more children&quot;; the poor on the other hand were disadvantaged by the &quot;Elterngeld&quot;, and now received lower child benefits than the middle classes. The very well-off (who earn more than 250.000 Euro per annum) and those on welfare receive no Elterngeld payments.

In 2013 the following most recent developments were noticed:

* The income of families with young children has risen. Persons holding a college degree, persons older than 30 years and parents with only one child benefited the most. Single parents and young parents did not benefit.
* Fathers are becoming more involved in parenting, and 28% of them now take some time off work (3.3 months on average) when their children are born.
* Mothers are more likely to work and as a result less likely to be economically deprived than they used to be.
* The birth rate of college-educated women has risen.

In the new federal states the fertility rate of college-educated women is now higher than that of those without college degrees. Differences in value priorities and the better availability of childcare in the eastern states are discussed as possible reasons.

In 2019, the non-profit Austrian Institute of Economic Research and the Bertelsmann Stiftung published a study about the economic impact of demographics. The researchers assume a reduction in the per capita income of ‚Ç¨3,700 until 2040.

==Population==
The contemporary demographics of Germany used to also be measured by a series of full censuses mandated by the state, with the most recent held in 1987. Since reunification, German authorities rely on a &quot;micro census&quot;.
Demographic statistics according to the World Population Review. Due to the privacy concerns of the German population after reunification, Germany did not hold a regular census until the EU-mandated 2011 German Census. The requirement was met with large disapproval. As required by the EU, Germany now continues to hold censuses every 10 years.
*One birth every 43 seconds
*One death every 34 seconds
*Net gain of one person every 4 minutes
*One net migrant every 2 minutes

== Vital statistics ==

===Statistics since 1817===
Population statistics since 1817. Territorial changes of Germany occurred in 1866 (establishment of North German Confederation, 1871) (German unification and annexation of Alsace-Lorraine), 1918/1919, 1921/1922, 1945/1946 and in 1990. Death data is incomplete for both world wars, especially WWII.

In 2023, 500,670 (72.25%) children were born to mothers with German citizenship, while 96,422 (13.91%) children were born to mothers with European citizenship (excluding Turkey) and 95,897 (13.84%) children were born to mothers with other citizenship.

===Structure of the population===



== Social issues ==
Most childbirths in Germany happen within marriage. Out of 778,080 births in 2019, 258,835 were to unmarried parents, which means that around 33% or one third of the children are born out of wedlock, while two thirds are within. This percentage of unmarried birth has long been growing and reached 33% in 2010, more than twice of what it was in 1990. However, in recent years it has started to stagnate or even decrease.

The Mikrozensus done in 2008 revealed that the number of children a German woman aged 40 to 75 had, was closely linked to her educational achievement.
In Western Germany, women with tertiary education had the highest rates of childlessness ‚Äî 26% stated that they were childless. This rate dropped to 16% for those with intermediate education, and 11% for those with only compulsory education.
In Eastern Germany however, 9% of the most educated women of that age group and 7% of those who had an intermediary education were childless, while 12% of those having only compulsory education were childless.

The reason for that east-western difference is that the GDR had an &quot;educated mother scheme&quot; and actively tried to encourage first births among the more educated. It did so by propagandizing the opinion that every educated woman should &quot;present at least one child to socialism&quot; and also by financially rewarding its more educated citizen to become parents. The government especially tried to persuade students to become parents while still in college and it was quite successful in doing so. In 1986, 38% of all women, who were about to graduate from college, were mothers of at least one child and an additional 14% were pregnant and 43% of all men, who were about to graduate from college, were fathers of at least one child. There was a sharp decline in the birth rate and especially in the birth rate of the educated after the fall of the Berlin wall. Nowadays, 5% of those about to graduate from college are parents.

The more educated a Western German mother aged 40 to 75 was in 2008, the less likely she was to have a big family.

The same was true for a mother living in Eastern Germany in 2008.

In 2011, this trend was reversed in Eastern Germany, where more highly educated women now had a somewhat higher fertility rate than the rest of the population.

Persons who said they had no religion tend to have fewer children than those who identify as Christians, and studies also found that conservative-leaning Christians had more children compared to liberal-leaning Christians.

A study done in 2005 in the western German state of Nordrhein-Westfalen by the HDZ revealed that childlessness was especially widespread among scientists. It showed that 78% of the women scientists and 71% of the male scientists working in that state were childless.

=== Homelessness ===
==Ethnic minorities and migrant background (&quot;Migrationshintergrund&quot;)==
Germany does not collect data on the ethnic and racial identifications of its citizens, but does collect data on the background group by birth of an individual. The Federal Statistical Office defines persons with a migrant background as all persons who migrated to the present area of the Federal Republic of Germany after 1949, plus all foreign nationals born in Germany and all persons born in Germany as German nationals with at least one parent who migrated to Germany or was born in Germany as a foreign national. The figures presented here are based on this definition only.

In 2010, 2.3 million families with children under 18 years were living in Germany, in which at least one parent had foreign roots. They represented 29% of the total of 8.1 million families with minor children. Compared with 2005¬†‚Äì the year when the microcensus started to collect detailed information on the population with a migrant background¬†‚Äì the proportion of migrant families has risen by 2 percentage points. In 2019, 40% children under 5 years old had migrant background.

Most of the families with a migrant background live in the western part of Germany. In 2010, the proportion of migrant families in all families was 32% in the former territory of the Federal Republic. This figure was more than double that in the new L√§nder (incl. Berlin) where it stood at 15%. Eastern Germany has a much lower proportion of immigrants than the West, as the GDR did not let in that many guest workers and Eastern Germany&#x27;s economy is not doing as well as West Germany&#x27;s and had a higher percentage of jobless persons until recently. However, in recent years the number of people with an immigrant background in East Germany has been growing as refugees (as well as German Repatriates) are distributed with the K√∂nigssteiner Schl√ºssel, so every German state has to take the same number of them compared to its population and economy. In 2019 19.036 million people or 89,6% of people with an immigrant background live in Western Germany (excluding Berlin), being 28,7% of its population, while 1.016 million people with immigrant background 4,8% live in Eastern States, being 8,2% of population, and 1.194 million people with an immigrant background 5,6% live in Berlin, being 33,1% of its population.

In 2019, 26% of Germans of any age group (up from 18,4% in 2008) and 39% of German children (up from 30% in 2008) had at least one parent born abroad. Average age for Germans with at least one parent born abroad was 35.6 years (up from 33.8 years in 2008), while that for Germans, who had two parents born in Germany was 47.3 years (up from 44.6 in 2008).

In 2022, 41 percent of the under-15 age group had a migrant background, 36 percent of the 15 to 49-year-old age group had a migrant background and 19 percent of the age group above (50+).

The largest groups of people with an immigrant background in Germany are people that have Turkey, Poland and Russia as their ancestral homelands.

, the population by background was as follows:


Four other sizable groups of people are referred to as &quot;national minorities&quot; (&quot;nationale Minderheiten&quot;) because they have lived in their respective regions for centuries: Danes, Frisians, Roma and Sinti, and Sorbs. There is a Danish minority (about 50,000, according to government sources) in the northernmost state of Schleswig-Holstein. Eastern and Northern Frisians live at Schleswig-Holstein&#x27;s western coast, and in the north-western part of Lower Saxony. They are part of a wider community (Frisia) stretching from Germany to the northern Netherlands. The Sorbs, a Slavic people with about 60,000 members (according to government sources), are in the Lusatia region of Saxony and Brandenburg. They are the last remnants of the Slavs that lived in central and eastern Germany since the 7th century to have kept their traditions and not been completely integrated into the wider German nation.

Until World War II the Poles were recognized as one of the national minorities. In 1924 the Union of Poles in Germany had initiated cooperation between all national minorities in Germany under the umbrella organization Association of National Minorities in Germany. Some of the union members wanted the Polish communities in easternmost Germany (now Poland) to join the newly established Polish nation after World War I. Even before the German invasion of Poland, leading anti-Nazi members of the Polish minority were deported to concentration camps; some were executed at the Pia≈õnica murder site. Minority rights for Poles in Germany were revoked by Hermann G√∂ring&#x27;s World War II decree of 27 February 1940, and their property was confiscated.

After the war ended, the German government did not re-implement national minority rights for ethnic Poles. The reason for this is that the areas of Germany which formerly had a native Polish minority were annexed to Poland and the Soviet Union, while almost all of the native German populations (formerly the ethnic majority) in these areas subsequently fled or were expelled by force. With the mixed German-Polish territories now lost, the German government subsequently regarded ethnic Poles residing in what remained of Germany as immigrants, just like any other ethnic population with a recent history of arrival. In contrast, Germans living in Poland are recognized as national minority and have granted seats in Polish Parliament. It must be said, however, that an overwhelming number of Germans in Poland have centuries-old historical ties to the lands they now inhabit, whether from living in territory that once belonged to the German state, or from centuries-old communities. In contrast, most Poles in present-day Germany are recent immigrants, though there are some communities which have been present since the 19th and perhaps even the 18th centuries. Despite protests by some in the older Polish-German communities, and despite Germany being now a signatory to the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities, Germany has so far refused to re-implement minority rights for ethnic Poles, based on the fact that almost all areas of historically mixed German-Polish heritage (where the minority rights formerly existed) are no longer part of Germany and because the vast majority of ethnic Poles now residing in Germany are recent immigrants.

Roma people have been in Germany since the Middle Ages. They were persecuted by the Nazis, and thousands of Roma living in Germany were killed by the Nazi regime. Nowadays, they are spread all over Germany, mostly living in major cities. It is difficult to estimate their exact number, as the German government counts them as &quot;persons without migrant background&quot; in their statistics. There are also many assimilated Sinti and Roma. A vague figure given by the German Department of the Interior is about 70,000. In contrast to the old-established Roma population, the majority of them do not have German citizenship, and are classified as immigrants or refugees.

After World War II, 14 million ethnic Germans were expelled from the eastern territories of Germany and homelands outside the former German Empire. The accommodation and integration of these &quot;Heimatvertriebene&quot; in the remaining part of Germany, in which many cities and millions of apartments had been destroyed, was a major effort in the post-war occupation zones and later states of Germany.

Since the 1960s, ethnic Germans from the People&#x27;s Republic of Poland and Soviet Union (especially from Kazakhstan, Russia, and Ukraine), have come to Germany. During the time of Perestroika, and after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the number of immigrants increased heavily. Some of these immigrants are of mixed ancestry. During the 10-year period between 1987 and 2001, a total of 1,981,732 ethnic Germans from the FSU immigrated to Germany, along with more than a million of their non-German relatives. After 1997, however ethnic Slavs or those belonging to Slavic-Germanic mixed origins outnumbered those with only Germanic descent amongst the immigrants. The total number of people currently living in Germany having FSU connection is around 4 to 4.5 million (Including Germans, Slavs, Jews, and those of mixed origins), out of that more than 50% are of German descent.

Germany now has Europe&#x27;s third-largest Jewish population. In 2004, twice as many Jews from former Soviet republics settled in Germany as in Israel, bringing the total inflow to more than 100,000 since 1991. Jews have a voice in German public life through the Central Council of Jews in Germany (Zentralrat der Juden in Deutschland). Some Jews from the former Soviet Union are of mixed heritage. Today, less than 0.1% of the total population of Germany is Jewish.

In 2019 there were also a growing number of at least 529,000 black Afro-Germans defined as people with an African migrant background. Out of them more than 400 thousand have a citizenship of a Subsahara-African country, with others being German citizens. Most of them live in Berlin and Hamburg. Numerous persons from northern African Tunisia and Morocco live in Germany. While they are considered members of a minority group, for the most part, they do not consider themselves &quot;Afro-Germans&quot;, nor are most of them perceived as such by the German people. However, Germany does not keep any statistics regarding ethnicity or race. Hence, the exact number of Germans of African descent is unknown.

Germany&#x27;s biggest East Asian minorities are the Chinese people in Germany, numbering 189,000
and Vietnamese people in Germany, numbering 188,000, many of whom living in Berlin and eastern Germany.
Also there are about 35,000 Japanese citizens residing in Germany. There are also groups of South Asian and Southeast Asian immigrants. Around 163,000 Indians and 124,000 Pakistanis live in Germany. Additionally some 30,000 Filipino citizens and more than 20,000 Indonesian citizens reside in Germany.

Numerous descendants of the so-called &quot;Gastarbeiter&quot; live in Germany. The &quot;Gastarbeiter&quot; mostly came from Turkey, Italy, Greece, Spain, Morocco, Portugal, the former Yugoslavia, Tunisia and Chile.
Also included were Vietnam, Mongolia, North Korea, Angola, Mozambique and Cuba when the former East Germany existed until reunification in 1990. The (socialist) German Democratic Republic (East Germany) however had their guest-workers stay in single-sex dormitories. Female guest workers had to sign contracts saying that they were not allowed to fall pregnant during their stay. If they fell pregnant nevertheless they faced forced abortion or deportation. This is one of the reasons why the vast majority of ethnic minorities today lives in western Germany and also one of the reasons why minorities such as the Vietnamese have the most unusual population pyramid, with nearly all second-generation Vietnamese Germans born after 1989.


== Foreign nationals in Germany ==

As the end of 2023, the most common groups of resident foreign nationals in Germany were as follows:

This list does not include non-ethnic Germans with German nationality and foreign nationals without resident status.
==Population density and distribution==

With an estimated 83.2 million inhabitants in December 2020, Germany is the second-most populous country in Europe after Russia, and ranks as the 19th largest country in the world in terms of population. Its population density stands at 233 inhabitants per square kilometer.

===States===
Germany comprises sixteen states that are collectively referred to as &quot;L√§nder&quot;. Due to differences in size and population the subdivision of these states varies, especially between city-states (&quot;Stadtstaaten&quot;) and states with larger territories (&quot;Fl√§chenl√§nder&quot;). For regional administrative purposes four states, namely Baden-W√ºrttemberg, Bavaria, Hesse and North Rhine-Westphalia, consist of a total of 19 Government Districts (&quot;Regierungsbezirke&quot;). As of 2019 Germany is divided into 400 districts (&quot;Kreise&quot;) at municipal level; these consist of 294 rural districts and 106 urban districts.



===Urbanization===
Germany officially has eleven metropolitan regions. In 2005, Germany had 82 cities with more than 100,000 inhabitants.

==Immigration==

The United Nations Population Fund lists Germany as host to the third-highest number of international migrants worldwide, behind the United States and Saudi Arabia. The largest ethnic group of non-German origin are the Turkish. Since the 1960s, West and later reunified Germany has attracted immigrants primarily from Southern and Eastern Europe as well as Turkey, many of whom (or their children) have acquired German citizenship over time. While most of these immigrants initially arrived as guest workers, changes to guest worker legislation allowed many to stay and to build lives in Germany.

Germany had signed special visa agreements with several countries in times of severe labour shortages or when particular skills were deficient within the country. During the 1960s and 1970s, agreements were signed with the governments of Turkey, Yugoslavia, Italy and Spain to help Germany overcome its severe labour shortage.

As of 2012, after Germany fully legalized visa-free immigrants from the eastern states of the EU, the largest sources of net immigration to Germany were other European countries, most importantly Poland, Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, Italy, Spain, and Greece; notably, in the case of Turkey, German Turks moving to Turkey slightly outnumbered new immigrants in 2012, however, in recent years there are more Turkish immigrants in Germany than emigrants again, including illegal Turkish migrants.

In 2015, there was a large increase in asylum applications following the 2015 refugee crisis, mainly due to the violent conflicts in Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan: 476,649 asylum applications were counted that year. This number went up to even 745,545 in 2016 and began to decline after it.

In 2022, some 23.8 million people in Germany, or 28.7% of the population have migrant background.

Following the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, over 1.06 million refugees from Ukraine were recorded in Germany as of April 2023.

===Migration between Germany and foreign countries, 1950 to 2023===

==Education==

Responsibility for educational oversight in Germany lies primarily with the individual federated states. Since the 1960s, a reform movement has attempted to unify secondary education into a &quot;Gesamtschule&quot; (comprehensive school); several West German states later simplified their school systems to two or three tiers. A system of apprenticeship called &quot;Duale Ausbildung&quot; (&quot;dual education&quot;) allows pupils in vocational training to learn in a company as well as in a state-run vocational school.

Optional kindergarten education is provided for all children between three and six years old, after which school attendance is compulsory for at least nine years, depending on the state. Primary education usually lasts for four years and public schools are not stratified at this stage. In contrast, secondary education includes three traditional types of schools focused on different levels of academic ability: the &quot;Gymnasium&quot; enrols the most academically promising children and prepares students for university studies; the &quot;Realschule&quot; for intermediate students lasts six years; the &quot;Hauptschule&quot; prepares pupils for vocational education.

In addition Germany has a comprehensive school known as the &quot;Gesamtschule&quot;. While some German schools such as the Gymnasium and the Realschule have rather strict entrance requirements, the Gesamtschule does not have such requirements. They offer college preparatory classes for the students who are doing well, general education classes for average students, and remedial courses for those who aren&#x27;t doing that well. In most cases students attending a Gesamtschule may graduate with the Hauptschulabschluss, the Realschulabschluss or the Abitur depending on how well they did in school.
The percentage of students attending a Gesamtschule varies by Bundesland. In 2007 the State of Brandenburg more than 50% of all students attended a Gesamtschule, while in the State of Bavaria less than 1% did.

The general entrance requirement for university is Abitur, a qualification normally based on continuous assessment during the last few years at school and final examinations; however there are a number of exceptions, and precise requirements vary, depending on the state, the university and the subject. Germany&#x27;s universities are recognised internationally; in the Academic Ranking of World Universities (ARWU) for 2008, six of the top 100 universities in the world are in Germany, and 18 of the top 200. Nearly all German universities are public institutions, tuition fees in the range of ‚Ç¨500 were introduced in some states after 2006, but quickly abolished again until 2014.

&quot;Percentage of jobholders holding Hauptschulabschluss, Realschulabschluss or Abitur in Germany&quot;

===Literacy===
Over 99% of those of age 15 and above are estimated to be able to read and write. However, a growing number of inhabitants are functionally illiterate. The young are much more likely to be functionally illiterate than the old. According to a study done by the University of Bremen in cooperation with the &quot;Bundesverband Alphabetisierung e.V.&quot;, 10% of youngsters living in Germany are functionally illiterate and one quarter are able to understand only basic level texts. Illiteracy rates of youngsters vary by ethnic group and parents&#x27; socioeconomic class.

==Health==

The life expectancy in Germany is 81.1 years (78.7 years males, 83.6 years females, 2020 est.). 
, the principal cause of death was cardiovascular disease, at 42%, followed by malignant tumours, at 25%.
, about 82,000 Germans had been infected with HIV/AIDS and 26,000 had died from the disease (cumulatively, since 1982).
According to a 2005 survey, 27% of German adults are smokers.
A 2009 study shows Germany is near the median in terms of overweight and obese people in Europe.

==Religion==

The national constitutions of 1919 and 1949 guarantee freedom of faith and religion; earlier, these freedoms were mentioned only in state constitutions. The modern constitution of 1949 also states that no one may be discriminated against due to their faith or religious opinions. A state church does not exist in Germany (see Freedom of religion in Germany).

According to a 1990s poll by &quot;Der Spiegel&quot;, 45% of Germans believe in God, and a quarter in Jesus Christ. According to the Eurobarometer Poll 2010, 44% of German citizens responded that &quot;they believe there is a God&quot;, 25% responded that &quot;they believe there is some sort of spirit or life force&quot; and 27% responded that &quot;they don&#x27;t believe there is any sort of spirit, God or life force&quot;. 4% gave no response.

Christianity is the largest religion in Germany, comprising roughly half of the country&#x27;s population.

Smaller religious groups (less than 1%) include Judaism, Buddhism and Hinduism.

The two largest churches, the Roman Catholic Church and the Protestant Church in Germany (EKD), have lost significant number of adherents. In 2023 the Catholic Church accounted for 24% and the Evangelical Church for 21.9% of the population. Orthodox Church has 1.5% and other Christian churches and groups summed up to 1% of the population. Since the reunification of Germany, the number of non-religious people has grown and an estimated 46.2% of the country&#x27;s population are not affiliated with any church or religion.

The other religions make up to less than 1% of the population. Buddhism has around 200,000 adherents (0.2%), Judaism has around 200,000 adherents (0.2%), Hinduism 90,000 (0.1%), Sikhism 75,000 (0.1%) and Yazidis religion (45,000‚Äì60,000). All other religious communities in Germany have fewer than 50,000 (&lt;0.1%) adherents.

Protestantism is concentrated in the north and east and Roman Catholicism is concentrated in the south and west. According to the last nationwide census, Protestantism is more widespread among the population with German citizenship; there are slightly more Catholics total because of the Catholic immigrant population (including such groups as Poles and Italians). The former Pope, Benedict XVI, was born in Bavaria. Non-religious people, including atheists and agnostics are especially numerous in the former East Germany and major metropolitan areas.

Of the roughly 4 million Muslims, most are Sunnis and Alevites from Turkey, but there are a small number of Shi&#x27;ites and other denominations. 1.5% of the country&#x27;s overall population declare themselves Orthodox Christians, with Serbs, Greeks, Romanians, Ukrainians and Russians being the most numerous. Germany has Europe&#x27;s third-largest Jewish population (after France and the United Kingdom). In 2004, twice as many Jews from former Soviet republics settled in Germany as in Israel, bringing the total Jewish population to more than 200,000, compared to 30,000 prior to German reunification. Large cities with significant Jewish populations include Berlin, Frankfurt and Munich. Around 250,000 active Buddhists live in Germany; 50% of them are Asian immigrants.

===2011 Census===
Census results were as follows:

* Roman Catholic Church: 24,740,380 or 30.8% of the German population;
* Protestant Church: 24,328,100 or 30.3% of the German population;
* Other, atheist or not specified (including Protestants outside EKD): 31,151,210 or 38.9% of the German population.

==Languages==

German is the only official and most widely spoken language. Standard German is understood throughout the country.

In 2021, the Federal Statistical Office of Germany included a new question regarding the language spoken at home in the micro-census, a large sample survey that yearly covers approximately 1% of the German population living in private households, and the results were as follows:
===Minority languages===

Danish, Low German, Low Rhenish, the Sorbian languages (Lower Sorbian and Upper Sorbian), and the two Frisian languages, Saterfrisian and North Frisian, are officially recognized and protected as minority languages by the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages in their respective regions. With speakers of Romany living in all parts of Germany, the federal government has promised to take action to protect the language. Until now, only Hesse has followed Berlin&#x27;s announcement, and agreed on implementing concrete measures to support Romany speakers.

Germany is a strong supporter of the Charter, as evidenced by things like the 2022 report from the Secretary General of the Council of Europe specifically naming Germany as an example of how to incorporate minority languages in State media. Still, Germany‚Äîlike many other signatories of the Charter‚Äîhas room for improvement in its implementation of the Charter.

===High German dialects===
German dialects ‚Äì some quite distinct from the standard language ‚Äì are used in everyday speech, especially in rural regions. Many dialects, for example the Upper German varieties, are to some degree cultivated as symbols of regional identity and have their own literature, theaters and some TV programming. While speaking a dialect outside its native region might be frowned upon, in their native regions some dialects can be spoken by all social classes. Nevertheless, partly due to the prevalence of Standard German in media, the use of dialects has declined over the past century, especially in the younger population.

The social status of different German dialects can vary greatly. The Alemannic and Bavarian dialects of the south are positively valued by their speakers and can be used in almost all social circumstances. The Saxonian and Thuringian dialects have less prestige and are subject to derision. While Bavarian and Alemannic have kept much of their distinctiveness, the Middle German dialects, which are closer to Standard German, have lost some of their distinctive lexical and grammatical features and tend to be only pronunciation variants of Standard German.

===Low Saxon dialects===

Although Low Saxon is officially recognized as a language on its own, little official action has been taken to foster the language. Historically one third of Germany&#x27;s territory and population was Low Saxon speaking. No data has ever been collected on the actual number of speakers, but today the number of speakers is around 5 million. Despite this relatively high number of speakers there is very little coverage in the media (mostly on NDR TV, no regular programming) and very little education in or on the language. The language is not fixed as part of the school curriculum, and Low Saxon is used as a medium of instruction in only one school in the whole of Germany (as a &quot;model project&quot; in primary school alongside education in Standard German). As a consequence the younger generation refused to adopt the native language of their parents. Language prevalence dropped from more than 90% (depending on the exact region) in the 1930s to less than 5% today. This accounts for a massive intergenerational gap in language use. Older people regularly use the language and take private initiatives to maintain the language, but the lack of innovative potential of the younger generation hinders language maintenance. The language also has its own literature (around 150 published books every year) and there are many theatres (mostly amateur dramatics, but some professional ones, such as Ohnsorg-Theater).

Use of Low Saxon is mainly restricted to use among acquaintances, such as family members, neighbours and friends. A meeting of a village council can be held almost completely in Low Saxon if all participants know each other (as long as written protocols are written in Standard German), but a single foreigner can make the whole meeting switch to Standard German.

The Low Saxon dialects differ in their status too. There is a north‚Äìsouth gradient in language maintenance. The southern dialects of Westfalian, Eastfalian and Brandenburgish have had much stronger speaker losses than the northern coastal dialects of Northern Low Saxon. While Eastfalian has lost speakers to Standard German, Westfalian has lost speakers both to Standard German and to the Standard German based regiolect of the Rhine-Ruhr area. Brandenburgish speakers mostly switched to the Standard German-based regiolect of Berlin. Brandenburgish has been almost completely replaced by the Berlin regiolect. Northern Low Saxon speakers switched mostly to pure Standard German.

===Foreign languages===
English is the most common foreign language and is almost universally taught at the secondary level; it is also taught at elementary level in some states. Other commonly-taught languages are French, Italian, Spanish and Russian. Dutch is taught in states bordering the Netherlands, and Polish in the eastern states bordering Poland. Latin and Ancient Greek are part of the classical education syllabus offered in many secondary schools.

According to a 2004 survey, two-thirds of Germany&#x27;s citizens have at least basic knowledge of English. About 20% consider themselves to be competent speakers of French, followed by speakers of Russian (7%), Italian (6.1%), and Spanish (5.6%). The relatively high number of Russian speakers is a result of immigration from the former Soviet Union to Germany for almost 10 consecutive years, plus its having been learned in school by many older former East Germans as compulsory first foreign language.

<text>The economy of Germany is a highly developed social market economy. It has the largest national economy in Europe, the third-largest by nominal GDP in the world, and the sixth-largest by PPP-adjusted GDP. Due to a volatile currency exchange rate, Germany&#x27;s GDP as measured in dollars fluctuates sharply, but it is among the world¬¥s top 4 since 1960. In 2017, the country accounted for 28% of the Euro area economy according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Germany is a founding member of the European Union and the eurozone.

In 2016, Germany recorded the highest trade surplus in the world, worth $310 billion. This economic result made it the biggest capital exporter globally. Germany is one of the largest exporters globally with $1.81 trillion worth of goods and services exported in 2019. The service sector contributes around 70% of the total GDP, industry 29.1%, and agriculture 0.9%. Exports accounted for 50.3% of national output. The top 10 exports of Germany are vehicles, machinery, chemical goods, electronic products, electrical equipment, pharmaceuticals, transport equipment, basic metals, food products, and rubber and plastics. Germany is the largest manufacturing economy in Europe, and it is less likely to be affected by a financial downturn. Germany conducts applied research with practical industrial value and sees itself as a bridge between the latest university insights and industry-specific product and process improvements. It generates a great deal of knowledge in its own laboratories. Among OECD members, Germany has a highly efficient and strong social security system, which comprises roughly 25% of GDP.

Germany is rich in timber, lignite, potash, and salt. Some minor sources of natural gas are being exploited in the state of Lower Saxony. Until German reunification, the German Democratic Republic mined for uranium in the Ore Mountains (see also: SAG/SDAG Wismut). Energy in Germany is sourced predominantly by fossil fuels (30%), with wind power in second place, then gas, solar, biomass (wood and biofuels), and hydro. Germany is the first major industrialised nation to commit to the renewable energy transition called &quot;Energiewende&quot;. Germany is the leading producer of wind turbines in the world. Renewables produced 46% of electricity consumed in Germany (as of 2019). Germany has been called &quot;the world&#x27;s first major renewable energy economy&quot;. Germany has the world&#x27;s second-largest gold reserve, with over 3,000 tonnes of gold. Germany spends around 3.14% of GDP on advance research and development across various sectors of the economy. It is also the world&#x27;s second-largest high-technology exporter.

More than 99 percent of all German companies belong to the German &quot;Mittelstand&quot;, small and medium-sized enterprises, which are mostly family-owned. These companies represent 48% of the global market leaders in their segments, labelled hidden champions. Of the world&#x27;s 2000 largest publicly listed companies measured by revenue, the Fortune Global 2000, 53 are headquartered in Germany, as are 26 of Europe&#x27;s 100 largest, with the top 10 being the following: Allianz, the world&#x27;s largest insurance company and one of the largest financial services groups and asset managers, largest in Europe; Munich Re, also one of the largest insurance companies; Daimler, Volkswagen, and BMW, among the biggest car markers in the world; Siemens, the world&#x27;s biggest industrial machinery company; Deutsche Telekom, one of the world&#x27;s largest telecommunication companies; Bayer, among the biggest biomedical companies; BASF, the world&#x27;s biggest chemical producer, and SAP, Europe&#x27;s biggest software company. Other major companies include Lufthansa, Europe&#x27;s largest airline, Deutsche Post, the largest logistics company worldwide, Deutsche Bahn, the largest railway company in the world, Bosch, the world&#x27;s largest automotive supplier, Uniper, the world&#x27;s largest energy company, and Aldi and Schwarz Gruppe, Europe&#x27;s largest retailers.

Germany is home to many financial centres and economically important cities, such as Berlin, Hamburg, Munich, Cologne, Frankfurt, and Stuttgart; 4 of the 5 biggest EU metropolitan areas by GDP are in Germany. 7 German banks are among the biggest in the world.

Germany is the world&#x27;s top location for trade fairs; around two thirds of the world&#x27;s leading trade fairs take place in Germany. Some of the largest international trade fairs and congresses are held in several German cities such as Hanover, Frankfurt, Cologne, Leipzig, and D√ºsseldorf.

==History==

===Age of Industrialisation===
The Industrial Revolution in Germany got underway approximately a century later than in the United Kingdom, France, and Belgium, partly because Germany only became a unified country in 1871.

The establishment of the &quot;Deutscher Zollverein&quot; (German Customs Union) in 1834 and the expansion of railway systems were the main drivers of Germany&#x27;s industrial development and political union. From 1834, tariff barriers between increasing numbers of the &quot;Kleindeutschland&quot; German states were eliminated. In 1835 the first German railway linked the Franconian cities of Nuremberg and F√ºrth ‚Äì it proved so successful that the decade of the 1840s saw &quot;railway mania&quot; in all the German states. Between 1845 and 1870, of rail had been built and in 1850 Germany was building its own locomotives. Over time, other German states joined the customs union and started linking their railroads, which began to connect the corners of Germany. The growth of free trade and a rail system across Germany intensified economic development which opened up new markets for local products, created a pool of middle managers, increased the demand for engineers, architects, and skilled machinists, and stimulated investments in coal and iron.

Another factor that propelled German industry forward was the unification of the monetary system, made possible in part by political unification. The Deutsche Mark, a new monetary coinage system backed by gold, was introduced in 1871. However, this system did not fully come into use as silver coins retained their value until 1907.

The victory of Prussia and her allies over Napoleon III of France in the Franco-Prussian War of 1870-1871 marked the end of French hegemony in Europe and resulted in the proclamation of the German Empire in 1871. The establishment of the empire inherently presented Europe with the reality of a new populous and industrialising polity possessing a considerable, and undeniably increasing, economic and diplomatic presence. The influence of French economic principles produced important institutional reforms in Germany, including the abolition of feudal restrictions on the sale of large landed estates, the reduction of the power of the guilds in the cities, and the introduction of a new, more efficient commercial law. Nonetheless, political decisions about the economy of the empire were still largely controlled by a coalition of &quot;rye and iron&quot;, that is the Prussian Junker landowners of the east and the Ruhr heavy industry of the west.

Regarding politics and society, between 1881 and 1889 Chancellor Otto von Bismarck promoted laws that provided social insurance and improved working conditions. He instituted the world&#x27;s first welfare state. Germany was the first to introduce social insurance programmes including universal healthcare, compulsory education, sickness insurance, accident insurance, disability insurance, and a retirement pension. Moreover, the government&#x27;s universal education policy bore fruit with Germany achieving the highest literacy rate in the world ‚Äì 99% ‚Äì education levels that provided the nation with more people good at handling numbers, more engineers, chemists, opticians, skilled workers for its factories, skilled managers, knowledgeable farmers, and skilled military personnel.

By 1900, Germany surpassed Britain in steel production and became the largest producer behind only the United States. The German economic miracle was also intensified by unprecedented population growth from 35 million in 1850 to 67 million in 1913. From 1895 to 1907, the number of workers engaged in machine building doubled from half a million to well over a million. Only 40 percent of Germans lived in rural areas by 1910, a drop from 67% at the birth of the Empire. Industry accounted for 60 percent of the gross national product in 1913. The German chemical industry became the most advanced in the world, and by 1914 the country was producing half the world&#x27;s electrical equipment.

The rapid advance to industrial maturity led to a drastic shift in Germany&#x27;s economic situation ‚Äì from a rural economy into a major exporter of finished goods. The ratio of the finished product to total exports jumped from 38% in 1872 to 63% in 1912. By 1913 Germany had come to dominate all the European markets. By 1914 Germany had become one of the biggest exporters in the world.

===Weimar Republic and Third Reich===

The Nazis rose to power while unemployment was very high, but achieved full employment later thanks to massive public works programmes such as the &quot;Reichsbahn&quot;, &quot;Reichspost&quot;, and the &quot;Reichsautobahn&quot; projects. In 1935 rearmament in contravention of the Treaty of Versailles added to the economy.

The post-1931 financial crisis economic policies of expansionary fiscal policies (as Germany was off the gold standard) was advised by their non-Nazi Minister of Economics, Hjalmar Schacht, who in 1933 became the president of the central bank. Schacht later resigned from the post in 1938 and was replaced by Hermann G√∂ring.

The trading policies of the Third Reich aimed at self-sufficiency but with a lack of raw materials Germany would have to maintain trade links but on bilateral preferences, foreign exchange controls, import quotas, and export subsidies under what was called the &quot;New Plan&quot;(&quot;Neuer Plan&quot;) of 19 September 1934. The &quot;New Plan&quot; was based on trade with less developed countries who would trade raw materials for German industrial goods saving currency. Southern Europe was preferable to Western Europe and North America as there could be no trade blockades. This policy became known as the &quot;Grosswirtschaftsraum&quot; (&quot;greater economic area&quot;) policy.

Eventually, the Nazi party developed strong relationships with big business and abolished trade unions in 1933 in order to form the Reich Labour Service (RAD), German Labour Front (DAF) to set working hours, Beauty of Labour (SDA) which set working conditions, and Strength through Joy (KDF) to ensure sports clubs for workers.

===West Germany===
Beginning with the replacement of the Reichsmark with the Deutsche Mark as legal tender, a lasting period of low inflation and rapid industrial growth was overseen by the government led by German Chancellor Konrad Adenauer and his minister of economics, Ludwig Erhard, raising West Germany from total wartime devastation to one of the most developed nations in modern Europe.

In 1953 it was decided that Germany was to repay $1.1 billion of the aid it had received. The last repayment was made in June 1971.

Apart from these factors, hard work and long hours at full capacity among the population in the 1950s, 1960s, and early 1970s and extra labour supplied by thousands of &quot;Gastarbeiter&quot; (&quot;guest workers&quot;) provided a vital base for the economic upturn.

===East Germany===
By the early 1950s, the Soviet Union had seized reparations in the form of agricultural and industrial products and demanded further heavy reparation payments. Silesia with the Upper Silesian Coal Basin, and Stettin, a prominent natural port, were lost to Poland.

Exports from West Germany exceeded $323 billion in 1988. In the same year, East Germany exported $30.7 billion worth of goods; 65% to other communist states. East Germany had zero unemployment.

Car markers like the Automobilwerk Eisenach and the HQM Sachsenring GmbH produced icons of the East German economy like the Trabant line and the Wartburg line.

===Federal Republic===

The German economy practically stagnated in the beginning of the 2000s. The worst growth figures were achieved in 2002 (+1.4%), in 2003 (+1.0%), and in 2005 (+1.4%). Unemployment was also chronically high. Due to these problems, together with Germany&#x27;s aging population, the welfare system came under considerable strain. This led the government to push through a wide-ranging programme of belt-tightening reforms, Agenda 2010, including the labour market reforms known as Hartz I - IV.

In the later part of the first decade of 2000, the world economy experienced high growth, from which Germany as a leading exporter also profited. Some credit the Hartz reforms with achieving high growth and declining unemployment but others contend that they resulted in a massive decrease in standards of living and that its effects are limited and temporary.

The nominal GDP of Germany contracted in the second and third quarters of 2008, putting the country in a technical recession following a global and European recession cycle. German industrial output dropped to 3.6% in September vis-√†-vis August. In January 2009 the German government under Angela Merkel approved a ‚Ç¨50 billion ($70 billion) economic stimulus plan to protect several sectors from a downturn and a subsequent rise in unemployment rates. Germany exited the recession in the second and third quarters of 2009, mostly due to rebounding manufacturing orders and exports - primarily from outside the eurozone - and relatively steady consumer demand.

Germany is a founding member of the EU, the G8, and the G20, and was the world&#x27;s largest exporter from 2003 to 2008. In 2011 it remained the third largest exporter and third largest importer. Most of the country&#x27;s exports are in engineering, especially machinery, automobiles, chemical goods, and metals. Germany is a leading producer of wind turbines and solar-power technology. Annual trade fairs and congresses are held in cities throughout Germany. 2011 was a record-breaking year for the German economy. German companies exported goods worth over ‚Ç¨1 trillion ($1.3 trillion), the highest figure in history. The number of people in work has risen to 41.6 million, the highest recorded figure.

Through 2012, Germany&#x27;s economy continued to be stronger relative to local neighbouring nations. In 2023, Germany experienced economic difficulties as a result of the closure of Russian natural gas resources due to international sanctions following the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Germany imported 55% of its gas from Russia at the time when Russia started the invasion in 2022. Amid a global energy crisis, Chancellor Olaf Scholz committed to weaken dependence on Russian energy imports by halting certification of Nord Stream 2, while also committing to his long-term predecessor Angela Merkel&#x27;s policy of phasing out nuclear energy.

As of December 2023, Germany is the third largest economy in nominal terms in the world after the United States and China, and the largest economy in Europe. It is the third largest export nation in the world.

In April 2024, a report by the German Economic Institute revealed that despite attempts to expand into other markets, the German economy remains heavily reliant on China for various products and raw materials.

During 2024, the German economy experienced its second consecutive year of contraction. Europe&#x27;s largest economy declined by 0.2% over the year, following a 0.3% contraction in 2023. Germany&#x27;s trade surplus with the United States, reported by Reuters to have reached a record ‚Ç¨65 billion (¬£54.7 billion) during the first 11 months of 2024, has made the nation a likely target for potential tariffs from Donald Trump&#x27;s administration. The economic climate has also been affected by widespread layoffs across major German corporations. Companies such as Siemens, Bosch, Thyssenkrupp, and Deutsche Bahn, all featured in the Fortune 500, are estimated to have collectively cut over 60,000 jobs during the first 10 months of 2024. Bosch, a highly regarded manufacturing firm, announced in November alone plans to reduce its workforce by approximately 7,000 employees.

==Data ==
The following table shows the main economic indicators in 1980‚Äì2024 (with IMF staff estimates in 2025‚Äì2029). Inflation below 5% is in green.

===Companies===

Of the world&#x27;s 500 largest stock-market-listed companies measured by revenue in 2010, the Fortune Global 500, 37 are headquartered in Germany. 40 Germany-based companies are included in the DAX, the most popular German stock market index. Well-known global brands are Mercedes-Benz, BMW, SAP, Siemens, Volkswagen, Adidas, Audi, Allianz, Porsche, Bayer, BASF, Bosch, and Nivea.

Germany is recognised for its specialised small and medium enterprises, known as the &quot;Mittelstand&quot; model. SMEs account for more than 99 percent of German companies. Around 1,000 of these companies are global market leaders in their segment and are labelled hidden champions.

From 1991 to 2010, 40,301 mergers and acquisitions with an involvement of German firms with a total known value of 2,422 bil. EUR have been announced. The largest transactions since 1991 are: the acquisition of Mannesmann by Vodafone for 204.8 bil. EUR in 1999, the merger of Daimler-Benz with Chrysler to form DaimlerChrysler in 1998 valued at 36.3 bil. EUR.

Berlin developed an international startup ecosystem and became a leading location for venture capital funded firms in the European Union.

The sector with the highest number of companies registered in Germany is Services with 1,443,708 companies followed by Finance, Insurance, and Real Estate and Construction with 480,593 and 173,167 companies respectively.
The list includes the largest German companies by revenue in 2011:

===Mergers and acquisitions===
Since German reunification, there have been 52,258 mergers or acquisitions deals inbound or outbound in Germany. The most active year in terms of value was 1999 with a total value of 48 billion EUR, twice as much as the runner up which was 2006 with 24 billion EUR (see graphic &quot;M&amp;A in Germany&quot;).

Here is a list of the top 10 deals (ranked by value) that include a German company. The Vodafone‚ÄìMannesmann deal is still the biggest deal in global history.
==Economic region==
Germany as a federation is a polycentric country and does not have a single economic centre. The stock exchange is located in Frankfurt am Main, the largest Media company (Bertelsmann SE &amp; Co. KGaA) is headquartered in G√ºtersloh; the largest car manufacturers are in Wolfsburg (Volkswagen), Stuttgart (Mercedes-Benz and Porsche), and Munich (Audi and BMW).

Germany is an advocate of closer European economic and political integration. Its commercial policies are increasingly determined by agreements among European Union (EU) members and EU single market legislation. Germany introduced the common European currency, the euro on 1 January 1999. Its monetary policy is set by the European Central Bank in Frankfurt.

The southern states (&quot;Bundesl√§nder&quot;), especially Bayern, Baden-W√ºrttemberg, and Hessen, are economically stronger than the northern states. One of Germany&#x27;s traditionally strongest (and at the same time oldest) economic regions is the Ruhr area in the west, between Duisburg and Dortmund. 27 of the country&#x27;s 100 largest companies are located there. In recent years, however, the area, whose economy is based on natural resources and heavy industry, has seen a substantial rise in unemployment (2010: 8.7%).

The economy of Bayern and Baden-W√ºrttemberg, the states with the lowest number of unemployed people (2018: 2.7%, 3.1%), on the other hand, is based on high-value products. Important sectors are automobiles, electronics, aerospace, and biomedicine, among others. Baden-W√ºrttemberg is an industrial centre especially for the automobile and machine-building industry and the home of brands like Mercedes-Benz (Daimler), Porsche and Bosch.

With the reunification on 3 October 1990, Germany began the major task of reconciling the economic systems of the two former republics. Interventionist economic planning ensured gradual development in eastern Germany up to the level of former West Germany, but the standard of living and annual income remains significantly higher in western German states. The modernisation and integration of the eastern German economy continues to be a long-term process scheduled to last until the year 2019, with annual transfers from west to east amounting to roughly $80 billion. The overall unemployment rate has consistently fallen since 2005 and reached a 20-year low in 2012. The country in July 2014 began legislating to introduce a federally mandated minimum wage which would come into effect on 1 January 2015.

On 25 May 2023, a declaration of a recession in the German economy was made. It was reported that Gross Domestic Product (GDP) had contracted by 0.3% between January and March. This contraction was largely due to increased prices which discouraged consumer spending. The statistics office in Germany reported that household spending had dropped by 1.2% in the first quarter of the year.

==Sectors==
Germany has a social market economy characterised by a highly qualified labour force, a developed infrastructure, a large capital stock, a low level of corruption, and a high level of innovation. It has the largest national economy in Europe, the third largest by nominal GDP in the world, and ranked fifth by GDP (PPP) in 2023.

The service sector contributes around 70% of the total GDP, industry 29.1%, and agriculture 0.9%.

===Primary===
In 2010 agriculture, forestry, and mining accounted for only 0.9% of Germany&#x27;s gross domestic product (GDP) and employed only 2.4% of the population, down from 4% in 1991. Agriculture is extremely productive, and Germany can cover 90% of its nutritional needs with domestic production. Germany is the third-largest agricultural producer in the European Union after France and Italy. Germany&#x27;s principal agricultural products are potatoes, wheat, barley, sugar beets, fruit, and cabbages.

Despite the country&#x27;s high level of industrialisation, almost one-third of its territory is covered by forest. The forestry industry provides for about two-thirds of domestic consumption of wood and wood products, so Germany is a net importer of these items.

The German soil is relatively poor in raw materials. Only lignite (brown coal) and potash salt (&quot;Kalisalz&quot;) are available in significant quantities. However, the former GDR&#x27;s Wismut mining company produced a total of 230,400 tonnes of uranium between 1947 and 1990 and made East Germany the fourth-largest producer of uranium ore worldwide (largest in USSR&#x27;s sphere of control) at the time. Oil, natural gas, and other resources are, for the most part, imported from other countries.

Potash salt is mined in the centre of the country (Niedersachsen, Sachsen-Anhalt, and Th√ºringen). The most important producer is K+S (formerly Kali und Salz AG).

Germany&#x27;s bituminous coal deposits were created more than 300 million years ago from swamps which extended from the present-day South England, over the Ruhr area to Poland. Lignite deposits developed similarly, but during a later period, about 66 million years ago. Because the wood is not yet completely transformed into coal, brown coal contains less energy than bituminous coal.

Lignite is extracted in the extreme western and eastern parts of the country, mainly in Nordrhein-Westfalen, Sachsen, and Brandenburg. Considerable amounts are burned in coal plants near the mining areas, to produce electricity. Transporting lignite over far distances is not economically feasible, therefore the plants are located practically next to the extraction sites. Bituminous coal is mined in Nordrhein-Westfalen and Saarland. Most power plants burning bituminous coal operate on imported material, therefore the plants are located not only near to the mining sites, but throughout the country.

In 2019, the country was the world&#x27;s 3rd largest producer of selenium, the world&#x27;s 5th largest producer of potash, the world&#x27;s 5th largest producer of boron, the world&#x27;s 7th largest producer of lime, the world&#x27;s 13th largest producer of fluorspar, the world&#x27;s 14th largest producer of feldspar, the world&#x27;s 17th largest producer of graphite, the world&#x27;s 18th largest producer of sulfur, in addition to being the 4th largest world producer of salt.

===Industry===
Industry and construction accounted for 30.7% of the gross domestic product in 2017 and employed 24.2% of the workforce. Germany excels in the production of automobiles, machinery, electrical equipment, and chemicals. With the manufacture of 5.2 million vehicles in 2009, Germany was the world&#x27;s fourth-largest producer and largest exporter of automobiles. German automotive companies enjoy an extremely strong position in the so-called premium segment, with a combined world market share of about 90%. All new automobiles sold in Germany must be zero-emission vehicles from 2035.

Small- to medium-sized manufacturing firms (&quot;Mittelstand&quot; companies) which specialise in technologically advanced niche products and are often family-owned form a major part of the German economy. It is estimated that about 1,500 German companies occupy a top three position in their respective market segment worldwide. In about two thirds of all industry sectors German companies belong to the top three competitors.

Germany is the only country among the top five arms exporters that is not a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council.

===Services===
In 2017 services constituted 68.6% of gross domestic product (GDP), and the sector employed 74.3% of the workforce. The subcomponents of services are financial, renting, and business activities (30.5%); trade, hotels and restaurants, and transport (18%); and other service activities (21.7%).

Germany is the seventh most visited country in the world, with a total of 407 million overnights during 2012. This number includes 68.83 million nights by foreign visitors. In 2012, over 30.4 million international tourists arrived in Germany. Berlin has become the third most visited city destination in Europe. Additionally, more than 30% of Germans spend their holiday in their own country, with the biggest share going to Mecklenburg-Vorpommern. Domestic and international travel and tourism combined directly contribute over EUR43.2 billion to German GDP. Including indirect and induced impacts, the industry contributes 4.5% of German GDP and supports 2 million jobs (4.8% of total employment). The largest annual international trade fairs and congresses are held in several German cities such as Hannover, Frankfurt, and Berlin.

==Government finances==
The debt-to-GDP ratio of Germany had its peak in 2010 when it stood at 80.3% and decreased since then. According to Eurostat, the government gross debt of Germany amounts to ‚Ç¨2,152.0 billion or 71.9% of its GDP in 2015. The federal government achieved a budget surplus of ‚Ç¨12.1 billion ($13.1 billion) in 2015. Germany&#x27;s credit rating by credit rating agencies Standard &amp; Poor&#x27;s, Moody&#x27;s, and Fitch Ratings stands at the highest possible rating &quot;AAA&quot; with a stable outlook in 2016.

Germany&#x27;s &quot;debt clock&quot; (&quot;Schuldenuhr&quot;) reversed for the first time in 20 years in January 2018. It is now currently increasing at 10,424.00 per second (October 2020).

Economists generally see Germany&#x27;s current account surplus as undesirable.

==Infrastructure==
===Energy===

Germany is the world&#x27;s fifth-largest consumer of energy, and two-thirds of its primary energy was imported in 2002. In the same year, Germany was Europe&#x27;s largest consumer of electricity, totaling 512.9 terawatt-hours. Government policy promotes energy conservation and the development of renewable energy sources, such as solar, wind, biomass, hydroelectric, and geothermal energy. As a result of energy-saving measures, energy efficiency has been improving since the beginning of the 1970s. The government has set the goal of meeting half the country&#x27;s energy demands from renewable sources by 2050. Renewable energy also plays an increasing role in the labour market: Almost 700,000 people are employed in the energy sector. About 50 percent of them work with renewable energies.

In 2000, the red-green coalition under Chancellor Schr√∂der and the German nuclear power industry agreed to phase out all nuclear power plants by 2021. The conservative coalition under Chancellor Merkel reversed this decision in January 2010, electing to keep plants open. The nuclear disaster of the Japanese nuclear plant Fukushima in March 2011 however, changed the political climate fundamentally: Older nuclear plants have been shut down. Germany is seeking to have wind, solar, biogas, and other renewable energy sources play a bigger role, as the country looks to completely phase out nuclear power by 2022 and coal-fired power plants by 2038. Renewable energy yet still plays a more modest role in energy consumption, though German solar and wind power industries play a leading role worldwide. Germany has been called &quot;the world&#x27;s first major renewable energy economy&quot;.

In 2009, Germany&#x27;s total energy consumption (not just electricity) came from the following sources: oil 34.6%, natural gas 21.7%, lignite 11.4%, bituminous coal 11.1%, nuclear power 11.0%, hydro and wind power 1.5%, others 9.0%.

In the first half of 2021, coal, natural gas, and nuclear energy comprised 56% of the total electricity fed into Germany&#x27;s grid in the first half of 2021. Coal was the leader out of the conventional energy sources, comprising over 27% of Germany&#x27;s electricity. Wind power&#x27;s contribution to the electric grid was 22%.

There are 3 major entry points for oil pipelines: in the northeast (the Druzhba pipeline, coming from Gda≈Ñsk), west (coming from Rotterdam) and southeast (coming from Nelahozeves). The oil pipelines of Germany do not constitute a proper network, and sometimes only connect two different locations. Major oil refineries are located in or near the following cities: Schwedt, Spergau, Vohburg, Burghausen, Karlsruhe, Cologne, Gelsenkirchen, Lingen, Wilhelmshaven, Hamburg, and Heide.

Germany&#x27;s network of natural gas pipelines, on the other hand, is dense and well-connected. Imported pipeline gas comes mostly from Russia, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom.

===Transport===
With its central position in Europe, Germany is an important transportation hub. This is reflected in its dense and modern transportation networks. The extensive motorway (&quot;Autobahn&quot;) network ranks worldwide third largest in its total length and features a lack of blanket speed limits on the majority of routes.

Germany has established a polycentric network of high-speed trains. The Intercity Express or &quot;ICE&quot; is the most advanced service category of the Deutsche Bahn and serves major German cities as well as destinations in neighbouring countries. The train maximum speed varies between 200¬†km/h and 320¬†km/h (125-200¬†mph). Connections are offered at either 30-minute, hourly, or two-hourly intervals. German railways are heavily subsidised, receiving ‚Ç¨17.0 billion in 2014.

The largest German airports are Frankfurt Airport and Munich Airport, both are global hubs of Lufthansa. Other major airports are Berlin Brandenburg Airport, D√ºsseldorf, Hamburg, Hanover, Cologne/Bonn, and Stuttgart.

===Banking system===

Seven German banks are among the biggest in the world. As of 2019, Germany is the country in Europe with the highest number of credit institutions: between 1,600 and 1,800. The types of institutions are in strong competition with each other: 390 &quot;Sparkassen&quot; and 8 public &quot;Landesbanken&quot; groups (1,200 billion euros of deposits), private commercial banks (DB, Commerzbank, and Unicredit-HypoVereinsbank, for 780 billion), cooperative credit banks (700 billion euros), savings banks, and &quot;Raiffeisen&quot;. The total of the system is worth 3,800 billion. 75% of retail customer deposits are managed by savings banks and cooperative credit banks.

According to Eurostat, in 2022 Germany also recorded the highest European rate of gross savings (19.98% of disposable income).

==Technology==
Germany&#x27;s achievements in sciences have been significant, and research and development efforts form an integral part of the economy.

Germany is also one of the leading countries in developing and using green technologies. Companies specialising in green technology have an estimated turnover of ‚Ç¨200 billion. German expertise in engineering, science, and research is eminently respectable.

The lead markets of Germany&#x27;s green technology industry are power generation, sustainable mobility, material efficiency, energy efficiency, waste management and recycling, sustainable water management.

Regarding triadic patents, Germany is in third place after the U.S. and Japan. With more than 26,500 registrations for patents submitted to the European Patent Office, Germany is the leading European nation. Siemens, Bosch, and BASF, with almost 5,000 registrations for patents between them in 2008, are among the top 5 of more than 35,000 companies registering patents. Together with the U.S. and Japan, about patents for nano, bio, and new technologies Germany is one of the world&#x27;s most active nations. With around one-third of triadic patents, Germany leads the way worldwide in the field of vehicle emission reduction.

According to Winfried Kretschmann, who is premier of the region where Daimler is based, &quot;China dominates the production of solar cells. Tesla is ahead in electric cars and Germany has lost the first round of digitalization to Google, Apple, and the like. Whether Germany has a future as an industrial economy will depend on whether we can manage the ecological and digital transformation of our economy&quot;.

==Challenges==

Despite economic prosperity, Germany&#x27;s biggest threat to future economic development is the nation&#x27;s declining birthrate, which is among the lowest in the world. This is particularly prevalent in parts of society with higher education. As a result, the numbers of workers are expected to decrease and the government spending needed to support pensioners and healthcare will increase if the trend is not reversed.

Less than a quarter of German people expect living conditions to improve in the coming decades.

On August 25, 2020, Federal Statistical Office of Germany revealed that the German economy plunged by 9.7% in the second quarter which is the worst on record. The latest figures show how hard the German economy was hit by the government measures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Energy-intensive German industry and German exporters were hit particularly hard by the 2022 global energy crisis. Economy Minister Robert Habeck warned that the planned end of Russian energy imports will permanently raise energy prices for German industry and consumers.

In the early 21st century, German governments supported the European Green Deal and Germany&#x27;s transition to green energy. Germany planned to phase out coal by 2030. The last three nuclear power plants in Germany were shut down on 15 April 2023.

Speaking at the COP28 climate summit in Dubai in December 2023, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz called for a phase-out of fossil fuels, including coal, oil and natural gas, and reiterated Germany&#x27;s commitment to be climate neutral by 2045, saying, &quot;The technologies are there: wind power, photovoltaics, electric motors, green hydrogen.&quot;

===Immigration===

In October 2023, Economy Minister Robert Habeck called for more immigration to Germany, saying the shortage of skilled workers was the country&#x27;s &quot;most pressing structural problem&quot;. Net immigration to Germany was 663,000 in 2023, down from a record 1,462,000 in 2022.

<text>As a densely populated country in a central location in Europe and with a developed economy, Germany has a dense transport infrastructure.

One of the first limited-access highway systems in the world to have been built, the extensive German Autobahn network has no general speed limit for light vehicles (although there are speed limits in many sections today, and there is an limit for trucks). The country&#x27;s most important waterway is the river Rhine, and largest port is that of Hamburg. Frankfurt Airport is a major international airport and European transport hub. Air travel is used for greater distances within Germany but faces competition from the state-owned Deutsche Bahn&#x27;s rail network. High-speed trains called ICE connect cities for passenger travel with speeds up to 300¬†km/h. Many German cities have rapid transit systems and public transport is available in most areas. Buses have historically only played a marginal role in long-distance passenger service, as all routes directly competing with rail services were technically outlawed by a law dating to 1935 (during the Nazi era). Only in 2012 was this law officially amended and thus a long-distance bus market has also emerged in Germany since then.

Since German reunification substantial effort has been made to improve and expand transport infrastructure in what was formerly East Germany. Due to Germany&#x27;s varied history, main traffic flows have changed from primarily east‚Äìwest (old Prussia and the German Empire) to primarily north‚Äìsouth (the 1949-1990 German partition era) to a more balanced flow with both major north‚Äìsouth and east‚Äìwest corridors, both domestically and in transit. Infrastructure, which was further hampered by the havoc wars and scorched earth policies as well as reparations wrought, had to be adjusted and upgraded with each of those shifts.

Verkehrsmittel () and Verkehrszeichen - Transportation signs in Germany are available here in German and English.

==Road and automotive transport==

===Overview===

The volume of traffic in Germany, especially goods transportation, is at a very high level due to its central location in Europe.
In the past few decades, much of the freight traffic shifted from rail to road, which led the Federal Government to introduce a motor toll for trucks in 2005. Individual road usage increased resulting in a relatively high traffic density to other nations. A further increase of traffic is expected in the future.

High-speed vehicular traffic has a long tradition in Germany given that the first freeway (Autobahn) in the world, the AVUS, and the world&#x27;s first automobile were developed and built in Germany. Germany possesses one of the most dense road systems of the world. German motorways have no blanket speed limit for light vehicles. However, posted limits are in place on many dangerous or congested stretches as well as where traffic noise or pollution poses a problem (20.8% under static or temporary limits and an average 2.6% under variable traffic control limit applications as of 2015).

The German government has had issues with upkeep of the country&#x27;s autobahn network, having had to revamp the Eastern portion&#x27;s transport system since the unification of Germany between the German Democratic Republic (East Germany) and the Federal Republic of Germany (West Germany). With that, numerous construction projects have been put on hold in the west, and a vigorous reconstruction has been going since the late 1990s. However, ever since the European Union formed, an overall streamlining and change of route plans have occurred as faster and more direct links to former Soviet bloc countries now exist and are in the works, with intense co-operation among European countries.

Intercity bus service within Germany fell out of favour as post-war prosperity increased, and became almost extinct when legislation was introduced in the 1980s to protect the national railway. After that market was deregulated in 2012, some 150 new intercity bus lines have been established, leading to a significant shift from rail to bus for long journeys. The market has since consolidated with Flixbus controlling over 90% of it and also expanding into neighboring countries.

=== Roads ===


Germany has approximately 650,000¬†km of roads, of which 231,000¬†km are non-local roads. The road network is extensively used with nearly 2 trillion km travelled by car in 2005, in comparison to just 70 billion km travelled by rail and 35 billion km travelled by plane.

The Autobahn is the German federal highway system. The official German term is &#x27; (plural &#x27;, abbreviated &#x27;BAB&#x27;), which translates as &#x27;federal motorway&#x27;. Where no local speed limit is posted, the advisory limit &quot;(Richtgeschwindigkeit)&quot; is 130¬†km/h. The &quot;Autobahn&quot; network had a total length of about in 2016, which ranks it among the most dense and longest systems in the world. Only federally built controlled-access highways meeting certain construction standards including at least two lanes per direction are called &quot;Bundesautobahn&quot;. They have their own, blue-coloured signs and their own numbering system. All &quot;Autobahnen&quot; are named by using the capital letter A, followed by a blank and a number (for example A¬†8).

The main &quot;Autobahnen&quot; going all across Germany have single digit numbers. Shorter highways of regional importance have double digit numbers (like A¬†24, connecting Berlin and Hamburg). Very short stretches built for heavy local traffic (for example ring roads or the A¬†555 from Cologne to Bonn) usually have three digits, where the first digit depends on the region.

East‚Äìwest routes are usually even-numbered, north‚Äìsouth routes are usually odd-numbered. The numbers of the north‚Äìsouth &quot;Autobahnen&quot; increase from west to east; that is to say, the more easterly roads are given higher numbers. Similarly, the east‚Äìwest routes use increasing numbers from north to south.

The autobahns are considered the safest category of German roads: for example, in 2012, while carrying 31% of all motorized road traffic, they only accounted for 11% of Germany&#x27;s traffic fatalities.&lt;ref name=&quot;http://www.bast.de 2012&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

German autobahns are still toll-free for light vehicles, but on 1 January 2005, a blanket mandatory toll on heavy trucks was introduced.

The national roads in Germany are called &quot;Bundesstra√üen&quot; (federal roads). Their numbers are usually well known to local road users, as they appear (written in black digits on a yellow rectangle with black border) on direction traffic signs and on street maps. A Bundesstra√üe is often referred to as &quot;B&quot; followed by its number, for example &quot;B1&quot;, one of the main east‚Äìwest routes. More important routes have lower numbers. Odd numbers are usually applied to north‚Äìsouth oriented roads, and even numbers for east‚Äìwest routes. Bypass routes are referred to with an appended &quot;a&quot; (alternative) or &quot;n&quot; (new alignment), as in &quot;B¬†56n&quot;.

Other main public roads are maintained by the &quot;Bundesl√§nder&quot; (states), called &quot;Landesstra√üe&quot; (country road) or &quot;Staatsstra√üe&quot; (state road). The numbers of these roads are prefixed with &quot;L&quot;, &quot;S&quot; or &quot;St&quot;, but are usually not seen on direction signs or written on maps. They appear on the kilometre posts on the roadside. Numbers are unique only within one state.

The &quot;Landkreise&quot; (districts) and municipalities are in charge of the minor roads and streets within villages, towns and cities. These roads have the number prefix &quot;K&quot; indicating a &quot;Kreisstra√üe&quot;.

==Rail transport==

===Overview===
Germany features a total of 43,468¬†km railways, of which at least 19,973¬†km are electrified (2014).

Deutsche Bahn (German Rail) is the major German railway infrastructure and service operator. Though Deutsche Bahn is a private company, the government still holds all shares and therefore Deutsche Bahn can still be called a state-owned company. Since its reformation under private law in 1994, Deutsche Bahn AG (DB AG) no longer publishes details of the tracks it owns; in addition to the DBAG system there are about 280 privately or locally owned railway companies which own an approximate 3,000¬†km to 4,000¬†km of the total tracks and use DB tracks in &quot;open access&quot;.

Railway subsidies amounted to ‚Ç¨17.0 billion in 2014 and there are significant differences between the financing of long-distance and short-distance (or local) trains in Germany. While long-distance trains can be run by any railway company, the companies also receive no subsidies from the government. Local trains however are subsidised by the German states, which pay the operating companies to run these trains and indeed in 2013, 59% of the cost of short-distance passenger rail transport was covered by subsidies. This resulted in many private companies offering to run local train services as they can provide cheaper service than the state-owned Deutsche Bahn. Track construction is entirely and track maintenance partly government financed both for long and short range trains. On the other hand, all rail vehicles are charged track access charges by DB Netz which in turn delivers (part of) its profits to the federal budget.

High speed rail started in the early 1990s with the introduction of the Inter City Express (ICE) into revenue service after first plans to modernize the rail system had been drawn up under the government of Willy Brandt. While the high speed network is not as dense as those of France or Spain, ICE or slightly slower (max. speed 200¬†km/h) Intercity (IC) serve most major cities. Several extensions or upgrades to high speed lines are under construction or planned for the near future, some of them after decades of planning.

The fastest high-speed train operated by Deutsche Bahn, the InterCityExpress or ICE connects major German and neighbouring international centres such as Z√ºrich, Vienna, Copenhagen, Paris, Amsterdam and Brussels. The rail network throughout Germany is extensive and provides services in most areas. On regular lines, at least one train every two hours will call even in the smallest of villages during the day. Nearly all larger metropolitan areas are served by S-Bahn, U-Bahn, Stra√üenbahn and/or bus networks.

The German government on 13 February 2018 announced plans to make public transportation free as a means to reduce road traffic and decrease air pollution to EU-mandated levels. The new policy will be put to the test by the end of the year in the cities of Bonn, Essen, Herrenberg, Reutlingen and Mannheim. Issues remain concerning the costs of such a move as ticket sales for public transportation constitute a major source of income for cities.

=== International freight trains ===
While Germany and most of contiguous Europe use , differences in signalling, rules and regulations, electrification voltages, etc. create obstacles for freight operations across borders. These obstacles are slowly being overcome, with international (in- and outgoing) and transit (through) traffic being responsible for a large part of the recent uptake in rail freight volume. EU regulations have done much to harmonize standards, making cross border operations easier. Maschen Marshalling Yard near Hamburg is the second biggest in the world and the biggest in Europe. It serves as a freight hub distributing goods from Scandinavia to southern Europe and from Central Europe to the port of Hamburg and overseas. Being a densely populated prosperous country in the center of Europe, there are many important transit routes through Germany. The Mannheim‚ÄìKarlsruhe‚ÄìBasel railway has undergone upgrades and refurbishments since the 1980s and will likely undergo further upgrades for decades to come as it is the main route from the North Sea Ports to northern Italy via the Gotthard Base Tunnel.

=== S-Bahn ===
Almost all major metro areas of Germany have suburban rail systems called S-Bahnen (&quot;Schnellbahnen&quot;). These usually connect larger agglomerations to their suburbs and often other regional towns, although the Rhein-Ruhr S-Bahn connects several large cities. An S-Bahn calls at all intermediate stations and runs more frequently than other trains. In Berlin and Hamburg the S-Bahn has a U-Bahn-like service and uses a third rail whereas all other S-Bahn services rely on catenary power supply.

=== Rapid transit (U-Bahn) ===

Relatively few cities have a full-fledged underground U-Bahn system; S-Bahn (suburban commuter railway) systems are far more common. In some cities the distinction between U-Bahn and S-Bahn systems is blurred; for instance, some S-Bahn systems run underground, have frequencies similar to U-Bahn, and form part of the same integrated transport network. A larger number of cities has upgraded their tramways to light rail standards. These systems are called Stadtbahn (not to be confused with S-Bahn).

Cities with U-Bahn systems are:
* Berlin (U-Bahn)
* Hamburg (U-Bahn)
* Munich (U-Bahn)
* Nuremberg/F√ºrth (U-Bahn)

With the exception of Hamburg, all of those aforementioned cities also have a tram system, often with new lines built to light rail standards. Berlin and Hamburg (as well as the then independent city of Sch√∂neberg whose lone subway line is today&#x27;s line 4 of the Berlin U-Bahn) began building their networks before World War I whereas Nuremberg and Munich - despite earlier attempts in the 1930s and 1940s - only opened their networks in the 1970s (in time for the 1972 Summer Olympics in the case of Munich).
Cities with &quot;Stadtbahn&quot; systems can be found in the article Trams in Germany. Locals sometimes confuse &quot;Stadtbahn&quot; and &quot;proper&quot; &quot;U-Bahn&quot; as the logo for the former sometimes employs a white U on a blue background similar to the logo of the latter (in most cases, however, the Stadtbahn-logo includes additions to that U-logo). Furthermore, Stadtbahn systems often include partially or wholly underground sections (especially in city centers) and in the case of Frankfurt U-Bahn what is properly a &quot;Stadtbahn&quot; is even officially called an U-Bahn. To some extent this confusion was deliberate at the time of the opening of the Stadtbahn networks, as it was seen at the time to be more desirable to have a &quot;proper&quot; U-Bahn system than a &quot;mere&quot; tram system and many cities which embarked on Stadtbahn building projects did so with the official goal of eventually converting the entire network to U-Bahn standards.

===Trams (Stra√üenbahn)===
Germany was among the first countries to have electric streetcars, and Berlin has one of the longest tram networks in the world. Many West German cities abandoned their previous tram systems in the 1960s and 1970s while others upgraded them to &quot;Stadtbahn&quot; (~light rail) standard, often including underground sections. In the East, most cities retained or even expanded their tram systems and since reunification a trend towards new tram construction can be observed in most of the country. Today the only major German city without a tram or light rail system is Hamburg. Tram-train systems like the Karlsruhe model first came to prominence in Germany in the early 1990s and are implemented or discussed in several cities, providing coverage far into the rural areas surrounding cities. Trams exist in all but two of the states of Germany (Hamburg and Schleswig Holstein being the exception) and in 13 of the 16 state capitals (Wiesbaden being the capital outside the aforementioned states without a tram system). While there have been attempts to (re)-establish tram systems in many cities that formerly had them (for example Aachen, Kiel, Hamburg) as well as in some cities that never had them, but are comparatively close to a city that does (for example Erlangen, Wolfsburg), only a handful of such proposals have come to fruition since World War II - the Saarbahn (trams defunct in 1965; Saarbahn established in 1997) in Saarbr√ºcken, Heilbronn Stadtbahn (defunct in 1955, re-established as an extension of Stadtbahn Karlsruhe in 1998) and a few extensions across the border - the Strasbourg tramway to Kehl and the Trams in Basel to Weil am Rhein.

==Air transport==
Short distances and the extensive network of motorways and railways make airplanes uncompetitive for travel within Germany. Only about 1% of all distance travelled was by plane in 2002. But due to a decline in prices with the introduction of low-fares airlines, domestic air travel is becoming more attractive. In 2013 Germany had the fifth largest passenger air market in the world with 105,016,346 passengers. However, the advent of new faster rail lines often leads to cuts in service by the airlines or even total abandonment of routes like Frankfurt-Cologne, Berlin-Hannover or Berlin-Hamburg.

=== Airlines ===
:&quot;see: List of airlines of Germany&quot;

Germany&#x27;s largest airline is Lufthansa, which was privatised in the 1990s. Lufthansa also operates two regional subsidiaries under the Lufthansa Regional brand and a low-cost subsidiary, Eurowings, which operates independently. Lufthansa flies a dense network of domestic, European and intercontinental routes. Germany&#x27;s second-largest airline was Air Berlin, which also operated a network of domestic and European destinations with a focus on leisure routes as well as some long-haul services. Air Berlin declared bankruptcy in 2017 with the last flight under its own name in October of that year.

Charter and leisure carriers include Condor, TUIfly, MHS Aviation and Sundair. Major German cargo operators are Lufthansa Cargo, European Air Transport Leipzig (which is a subsidiary of DHL) and AeroLogic (which is jointly owned by DHL and Lufthansa Cargo).

===Airports===
:&quot;see: List of airports in Germany&quot;

Frankfurt Airport is Germany&#x27;s largest airport, a major transportation hub in Europe and the world&#x27;s twelfth busiest airport. It is one of the airports with the largest number of international destinations served worldwide. Depending on whether total passengers, flights or cargo traffic are used as a measure, it ranks first, second or third in Europe alongside London Heathrow Airport and Paris-Charles de Gaulle Airport. Germany&#x27;s second biggest international airport is Munich Airport, followed by Berlin Brandenburg Airport and D√ºsseldorf Airport.

There are several more scheduled passenger airports throughout Germany, mainly serving European metropolitan and leisure destinations. Intercontinental long-haul routes are operated to and from the airports in Frankfurt, Munich, Berlin, D√ºsseldorf, Cologne/Bonn, Hamburg and Stuttgart.

<text>The Federal Republic of Germany (FRG) is a Central European country and member of the European Union, G4, G7, the G20, the Organizations for Economic Co-operation and Development and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). It maintains a network of 229 diplomatic missions abroad and holds relations with more than 190 countries. As one of the world&#x27;s leading industrialized countries it is recognized as a major power in European and global affairs.

==History==
The history of German foreign policy covers diplomatic developments and international history since 1871.

Before 1866, Habsburg Austria and its German Confederation were the nominal leader in German affairs, but the Hohenzollern Kingdom of Prussia exercised increasingly dominant influence in German affairs, owing partly to its ability to participate in German Confederation politics through its Brandenburg holding, and its ability to influence trade through its Zollverein network. The question of excluding or including Austria&#x27;s influence was settled by the Prussian victory in the Austro-Prussian War in 1866. The unification of Germany was made possible by the Franco-Prussian War of 1870‚Äì71, in which the smaller states joined behind Prussia in a smashing victory over France. The German Empire was put together in 1871 by Otto von Bismarck, who dominated German and indeed all of European diplomatic history until he was forced to resign in 1890.

==Primary institutions and actors==

===Federal Cabinet===
The three cabinet-level ministries responsible for guiding Germany&#x27;s foreign policy are the Ministry of Defense, the Ministry of Economic Cooperation and Development and the Federal Foreign Office. In practice, most German federal departments play some role in shaping foreign policy in the sense that there are few policy areas left that remain outside of international jurisdiction. The bylaws of the Federal Cabinet (as delineated in Germany&#x27;s Basic Law), however, assign the Federal Foreign Office a coordinating function. Accordingly, other ministries may only invite foreign guests or participate in treaty negotiations with the approval of the Federal Foreign Office.

===Bundestag===
With respect to foreign policy, the Bundestag acts in a supervisory capacity. Each of its committees ‚Äì most notably the foreign relations committee ‚Äì oversees the country&#x27;s foreign policy. The consent of the Bundestag (and insofar as L√§nder are impacted, the Bundesrat) is required to ratify foreign treaties. If a treaty legislation passes first reading, it is referred to the Committee on Foreign Affairs, which is capable of delaying ratification and prejudice decision through its report to the Bundestag.

In 1994, a full EU Committee was also created for the purpose of addressing the large flow of EU-related topics and legislation. Also, the committee has the mandate to speak on behalf of the Bundestag and represent it when deciding an EU policy position. A case in point was the committee&#x27;s involvement regarding the European Union&#x27;s eastern enlargement wherein the Committee on Foreign Affairs is responsible for relations with ECE states while the EU Committee is tasked with the negotiations.

===NGOs===
There is a raft of NGOs in Germany that engage foreign policy issues. These NGOs include think-tanks (German Council on Foreign Relations), single-issue lobbying organizations (Amnesty International), as well as other organizations that promote stronger bilateral ties between Germany and other countries (Atlantic Bridge). While the budgets and methods of NGOs are distinct, the overarching goal to persuade decision-makers to the wisdom of their own views is a shared one. In 2004, a new German governance framework, particularly on foreign and security policy areas, emerged where NGOs are integrated into actual policymaking. The idea is that the cooperation between state and civil society groups increases the quality of conflict resolution, development cooperation and humanitarian aid for fragile states. The framework seeks to benefit from the expertise of the NGOs in exchange for these groups to have a chance for influencing foreign policy.

==Disputes==
In 2001, the discovery that the terrorist cell which carried out the attacks against the United States on 11 September 2001, was based in Hamburg, sent shock waves through the country.

The government of Chancellor Gerhard Schr√∂der backed the following U.S. military actions, sending Bundeswehr troops to Afghanistan to lead a joint NATO program to provide security in the country after the ousting of the Taliban.

Nearly all of the public was strongly against America&#x27;s 2003 invasion of Iraq, and any deployment of troops. This position was shared by the SPD/Green government, which led to some friction with the United States.

In August 2006, the German government disclosed a botched plot to bomb two German trains. The attack was to occur in July 2006 and involved a 21-year-old Lebanese man, identified only as Youssef Mohammed E. H. Prosecutors said Youssef and another man left suitcases stuffed with crude propane-gas bombs on the trains.

As of February 2007, Germany had about 3,000 NATO-led International Security Assistance Force force in Afghanistan as part of the War on Terrorism, the third largest contingent after the United States (14,000) and the United Kingdom (5,200). German forces are mostly in the more secure north of the country.

However, Germany, along with some other larger European countries (with the exception of the UK and the Netherlands), have been criticised by the UK and Canada for not sharing the burden of the more intensive combat operations in southern Afghanistan.

==Global initiatives==

===Humanitarian aid===
Germany is the largest net contributor to the United Nations and has several development agencies working in Africa and the Middle East. The development policy of the Federal Republic of Germany is an independent area of German foreign policy. It is formulated by the Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ) and carried out by the implementing organisations. The German government sees development policy as a joint responsibility of the international community. It is the world&#x27;s third biggest aid donor after the United States and France. Germany spent 0.37 per cent of its gross domestic product (GDP) on development, which is below the government&#x27;s target of increasing aid to 0.51 per cent of GDP by 2010. The international target of 0.7% of GNP would have not been reached either.

===Ecological involvement===
==International organizations==
Germany is a member of the Council of Europe, European Union, European Space Agency, G4, G8, International Monetary Fund, NATO, OECD, Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, UN, World Bank Group and the World Trade Organization.

===European Union===

European integration has gone a long way since the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) and the Elys√©e Treaty. Peaceful collaborations with its neighbors remain one of Germany&#x27;s biggest political objectives, and Germany has been on the forefront of most achievements made in European integration:
* Maastricht Treaty

Most of the social issues facing European countries in general: immigration, aging populations, straining social-welfare and pension systems ‚Äì are all important in Germany.
Germany seeks to maintain peace through the &quot;deepening&quot; of integration among current members of the European Union member states
* European Defence Force
* Introduction of the single currency ‚Ç¨ Euro

Germany has been the largest net contributor to EU budgets for decades (in absolute terms ‚Äì given Germany&#x27;s comparatively large population ‚Äì not per capita) and seeks to limit the growth of these net payments in the enlarged union.
* European Constitution

===NATO===

Under the doctrine introduced by the 2003 Defense Policy Guidelines, Germany continues to give priority to the transatlantic partnership with the United States through the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. However, Germany is giving increasing attention to coordinating its policies with the European Union through the Common Foreign and Security Policy.

===UN===
The German Federal Government began an initiative to obtain a permanent seat in the United Nations Security Council, as part of the Reform of the United Nations. This would require approval of a two-thirds majority of the member states and approval of all five Security Council veto powers.

This aspiration could be successful due to Germany&#x27;s good relations with the People&#x27;s Republic of China and the Russian Federation. Germany is a stable and democratic republic and a G7 country which are also favourable attributes. The United Kingdom and France support German ascension to the supreme body. The U.S. is sending mixed signals.

NATO member states, including Germany, decided not to sign the UN treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, a binding agreement for negotiations for the total elimination of nuclear weapons, supported by more than 120 nations.

; Balkan states

The German government was a strong supporter of the enlargement of NATO.

Germany was one of the first nations to recognize Croatia and Slovenia as independent nations, rejecting the concept of Yugoslavia as the only legitimate political order in the Balkans (unlike other European powers, who first proposed a pro-Belgrade policy). This is why Serb authorities sometimes referred to &quot;new German imperialism&quot; as one of the main reasons for Yugoslavia&#x27;s collapse. German troops participate in the multinational efforts to bring &quot;peace and stability&quot; to the Balkans.

; Central Europe
Weimar triangle (France, Germany and Poland); Germany continues to be active economically in the states of Central Europe, and to actively support the development of democratic institutions. In the 2000s, Germany has been arguably the centerpiece of the European Union (though the importance of France cannot be overlooked in this connection).

<text>Germany is a democratic and federal parliamentary republic, where federal legislative power is vested in the (the parliament of Germany) and the (the representative body of the , Germany&#x27;s regional states).

The federal system has, since 1949, been dominated by the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD). The judiciary of Germany is independent of the executive and the legislature, while it is common for leading members of the executive to be members of the legislature as well. The political system is laid out in the 1949 constitution, the (Basic Law), which remained in effect with minor amendments after German reunification in 1990.

The constitution emphasizes the protection of individual liberty in an extensive catalogue of human and civil rights and divides powers both between the federal and state levels and between the legislative, executive and judicial branches.

West Germany was a founding member of the European Community in 1958, which became the EU in 1993. Germany is part of the Schengen Area, and has been a member of the eurozone since 1999. It is a member of the United Nations, NATO, the G7, the G20 and the OECD.

 According to the V-Dem Democracy indices Germany was 2023 the 15th most electoral democratic country in the world.

==History==

===Before 1998===
Beginning with the election of Konrad Adenauer in 1949, the Federal Republic of Germany had Christian Democratic chancellors for 20 years until a coalition between the Social Democrats and the Liberals took over. From 1982, Christian Democratic leader Helmut Kohl was chancellor in a coalition with the Liberals for 16 years. In this period fell the reunification of Germany, in 1990: the German Democratic Republic joined the Federal Republic. In the former GDR&#x27;s territory, five &quot;L√§nder&quot; (states) were established or reestablished. The two parts of Berlin united as one &quot;Land&quot; (state).

The political system of the Federal Republic remained more or less unchanged. Specific provisions for the former GDR territory were enabled via the &quot;unification treaty&quot; between the Federal Republic and the GDR prior to the unification day of 3 October 1990. However, Germany saw in the following two distinct party systems: the Green party and the Liberals remained mostly West German parties, while in the East the former socialist state party, now called The Left Party, flourished along with the Christian Democrats and Social Democrats.

===1998‚Äì2005===


After 16 years of the Christian‚ÄìLiberal coalition, led by Helmut Kohl, the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) together with the Greens won the Bundestag elections of 1998. SPD vice chairman Gerhard Schr√∂der positioned himself as a centrist candidate, in contradiction to the leftist SPD chairman Oskar Lafontaine. The Kohl government was hurt at the polls by slower economic growth in the East in the previous two years, and constantly high unemployment. The final margin of victory was sufficiently high to permit a &quot;red-green&quot; coalition of the SPD with Alliance 90/The Greens (), bringing the Greens into a national government for the first time.

Initial problems of the new government, marked by policy disputes between the moderate and traditional left wings of the SPD, resulted in some voter disaffection. Lafontaine left the government (and later his party) in early 1999. The CDU won in some important state elections but was hit in 2000 by a party donation scandal from the Kohl years. As a result of this Christian Democratic Union (CDU) crisis, Angela Merkel became chair.

The next election for the was on 22 September 2002. Gerhard Schr√∂der led the coalition of SPD and Greens to an eleven-seat victory over the Christian Democrat challengers headed by Edmund Stoiber (CSU). Three factors are generally cited that enabled Schr√∂der to win the elections despite poor approval ratings a few months before and a weaker economy: good handling of the 100-year flood, firm opposition to the US 2003 invasion of Iraq, and Stoiber&#x27;s unpopularity in the east, which cost the CDU crucial seats there.

In its second term, the red‚Äìgreen coalition lost several very important state elections, for example in Lower Saxony where Schr√∂der was the prime minister from 1990 to 1998. On 20 April 2003, chancellor Schr√∂der announced massive labor market reforms, called Agenda 2010, that cut unemployment benefits. Although these reforms sparked massive protests, they are now credited with being in part responsible for the relatively strong economic performance of Germany during the euro-crisis and the decrease in unemployment in Germany in the years 2006‚Äì2007.

===2005‚Äì2009===

On 22 May 2005 the SPD received a devastating defeat in its former heartland, North Rhine-Westphalia. Half an hour after the election results, the SPD chairman Franz M√ºntefering announced that the chancellor would clear the way for new federal elections.

This took the republic by surprise, especially because the SPD was below 20% in polls at the time. The CDU quickly announced Angela Merkel as Christian Democrat candidate for chancellor, aspiring to be the first female chancellor in German history.

New for the 2005 election was the alliance between the newly formed Electoral Alternative for Labor and Social Justice (WASG) and the PDS, planning to fuse into a common party (see Left Party.PDS). With the former SPD chairman, Oskar Lafontaine for the WASG and Gregor Gysi for the PDS as prominent figures, this alliance soon found interest in the media and in the population. Polls in July saw them as high as 12%.

Whereas in May and June 2005 victory of the Christian Democrats seemed highly likely, with some polls giving them an absolute majority, this picture changed shortly before the election on 18 September 2005.

The election results of 18 September were surprising because they differed widely from the polls of the previous weeks. The Christian Democrats even lost votes compared to 2002, narrowly reaching the first place with only 35.2%, and failed to get a majority for a &quot;black‚Äìyellow&quot; government of CDU/CSU and liberal FDP. But the red‚Äìgreen coalition also failed to get a majority, with the SPD losing votes, but polling 34.2% and the greens staying at 8.1%. The Left reached 8.7% and entered the &quot;Bundestag&quot;, whereas the far-right NPD only got 1.6%.

The most likely outcome of coalition talks was a so-called grand coalition between the Christian Democrats (CDU/CSU) and the Social Democrats (SPD). Three party coalitions and coalitions involving The Left had been ruled out by all interested parties (including The Left itself). On 22 November 2005, Angela Merkel was sworn in by President Horst K√∂hler for the office of Bundeskanzlerin.

The existence of the grand coalition on federal level helped smaller parties&#x27; electoral prospects in state elections. Since in 2008, the CSU lost its absolute majority in Bavaria and formed a coalition with the FDP, the grand coalition had no majority in the &quot;Bundesrat&quot; and depended on FDP votes on important issues. In November 2008, the SPD re-elected its already retired chair Franz M√ºntefering and made Frank-Walter Steinmeier its leading candidate for the federal election in September 2009.

As a result of that federal election, the grand coalition brought losses for both parties and came to an end. The SPD suffered the heaviest losses in its history and was unable to form a coalition government. The CDU/CSU had only little losses but also reached a new historic low with its worst result since 1949. The three smaller parties thus had more seats in the German &quot;Bundestag&quot; than ever before, with the liberal party FDP winning 14.6% of votes.

=== 2009‚Äì2013 ===

The CDU/CSU and FDP together held 332 seats (of 622 total seats) and had been in coalition since 27 October 2009. Angela Merkel was re-elected as chancellor, and Guido Westerwelle served as the foreign minister and vice chancellor of Germany. After being elected into the federal government, the FDP suffered heavy losses in the following state elections. The FDP had promised to lower taxes in the electoral campaign, but after being part of the coalition they had to concede that this was not possible due to the economic crisis of 2008. Because of the losses, Guido Westerwelle had to resign as chair of the FDP in favor of Philipp R√∂sler, federal minister of health, who was consequently appointed as vice chancellor. Shortly after, Philipp R√∂sler changed office and became federal minister of economics and technology.

After their electoral fall, the Social Democrats were led by Sigmar Gabriel, a former federal minister and prime minister of Lower Saxony, and by Frank-Walter Steinmeier as the head of the parliamentary group. He resigned on 16 January 2017 and proposed his longtime friend and president of European Parliament Martin Schulz as his successor and chancellor candidate.
Germany has seen increased political activity by citizens outside the established political parties with respect to local and environmental issues such as the location of Stuttgart 21, a railway hub, and construction of Berlin Brandenburg Airport.

=== 2013‚Äì2017 ===
The 18th federal elections in Germany resulted in the re-election of Angela Merkel and her Christian democratic parliamentary group of the parties CDU and CSU, receiving 41.5% of all votes. Following Merkel&#x27;s first two historically low results, her third campaign marked the CDU/CSU&#x27;s best result since 1994 and only for the second time in German history the possibility of gaining an absolute majority. Their former coalition partner, the FDP, narrowly failed to reach the 5% threshold and did not gain seats in the Bundestag.

Not having reached an absolute majority, the CDU/CSU formed a grand coalition with the social-democratic SPD after the longest coalition talks in history, making the head of the party Sigmar Gabriel vice-chancellor and federal minister for economic affairs and energy. Together they held 504 of a total 631 seats (CDU/CSU 311 and SPD 193). The only two opposition parties were The Left (64 seats) and Alliance &#x27;90/The Greens (63 seats), which was acknowledged as creating a critical situation in which the opposition parties did not even have enough seats to use the special controlling powers of the opposition.

=== 2017‚Äì2021 ===
The 19th federal elections in Germany took place on 24 September 2017. The two big parties, the conservative parliamentary group CDU/CSU and the social democrat SPD were in a similar situation as in 2009, after the last grand coalition had ended, and both had suffered severe losses; reaching their second worst and worst result respectively in 2017.

Many votes in the 2017 elections went to smaller parties, leading the right-wing populist party AfD (Alternative for Germany) into the Bundestag which marked a big shift in German politics since it was the first far-right party to win seats in parliament since the 1950s.

With Merkel&#x27;s candidacy for a fourth term, the CDU/CSU only reached 33.0% of the votes, but won the highest number of seats, leaving no realistic coalition option without the CDU/CSU. As all parties in the Bundestag strictly ruled out a coalition with the AfD, the only options for a majority coalition were a so-called &quot;Jamaican&quot; coalition (CDU/CSU, FDP, Greens; named after the party colors resembling those of the Jamaican flag) and a grand coalition with the SPD, which was at first opposed by the Social Democrats and their leader Martin Schulz.

Coalition talks between the three parties of the &quot;Jamaican&quot; coalition were held but the final proposal was rejected by the liberals of the FDP, leaving the government in limbo. Following the unprecedented situation, for the first time in German history different minority coalitions or even direct snap coalitions were also heavily discussed. At this point, Federal President Steinmeier invited leaders of all parties for talks about a government, being the first president in the history of the Federal Republic to do so.

Official coalition talks between CDU/CSU and SPD started in January 2018 and led to a renewal of the grand coalition on 12 March 2018 as well as the subsequent re-election of Angela Merkel as chancellor.

=== 2021‚Äì2025 ===

Scheduled elections for the new Bundestag were held on 26 September 2021 during the COVID-19 pandemic. Angela Merkel did not stand for a fifth term but handed her post over after the second longest term for a chancellor in German history. Olaf Scholz was sworn in as the new chancellor on 8 December 2021. His Social Democrats had won the plurality of votes and formed a liberal-left coalition government with The Greens and the FDP.

For the first time since 1949 the South Schleswig Voters&#x27; Association was able to gain a seat in the Bundestag. As a party which represents Frisian and Danish minorities in Germany it is not bound by the 5% threshold.
The Left party missed that threshold as well and was only able to enter the Bundestag by winning three direct mandates. This was only the fourth time in history that this clause on the minimum number of constituency seats required for party representation in Parliament was applied.

In February 2022, Frank-Walter Steinmeier was elected for a second five-year term as Germany&#x27;s president. Although a largely ceremonial post, he has been seen as a symbol of consensus and continuity.

In a highly publicized break with her former party, The Left, Sahra Wagenknecht formed her own left-wing but culturally and socially conservative populist party, the Sahra Wagenknecht Alliance in 2024. Along with 9 other former members of The Left who held on to their seats in the Bundestag after leaving the party, they now hold 1.36% of mandates and cost The Left party its status as a parliamentary group.

On 6 November 2024, chancellor Olaf Scholz dismissed Christian Lindner from his post as finance minister, starting the 2024 German government crisis. After the FDP left the coalition, Scholz announced a vote of confidence which he lost. President Steinmeier would dissolve the Bundestag on 27 December 2024, paving the way for new federal elections in Germany.

==Constitution==


The &quot;Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany&quot; (Grundgesetz der Bundesrepublik Deutschland) is the Constitution of Germany. It was formally approved on 8 May 1949, and, with the signature of the Allies of World War II on 12 May, came into effect on 23 May, as the constitution of those states of West Germany that were initially included within the Federal Republic. The 1949 Basic Law is a response to the perceived flaws of the 1919 Weimar Constitution, which failed to prevent the rise of the Nazi party in 1933. Since 1990, in the course of the reunification process after the fall of the Berlin Wall, the Basic Law also applies to the eastern states of the former German Democratic Republic.

==Executive==

===Head of state===

The German head of state is the federal president. As in Germany&#x27;s parliamentary system of government, the federal chancellor runs the government and day-to-day politics, while the role of the federal president is mostly ceremonial. The federal president, by their actions and public appearances, represents the state itself, its existence, its legitimacy, and unity. Their office involves an integrative role. Nearly all actions of the federal president become valid only after a countersignature of a government member of Germany.

The president is not obliged by Constitution to refrain from political views. The president is expected to give direction to general political and societal debates, but not in a way that is linked to party politics. Most German presidents were active politicians and party members prior to the office, which means that they have to change their political style when becoming president. The function comprises the official residence of Bellevue Palace.

Under Article 59 (1) of the Basic Law, the federal president represents the Federal Republic of Germany in matters of international law, concludes treaties with foreign states on its behalf and accredits diplomats.

All federal laws must be signed by the president before they can come into effect. The president does not have formal a veto, but the conditions for refusing to sign a law on the basis of unconstitutionality are the subject of debate. The office is currently held by Frank-Walter Steinmeier (since 2017). 

The federal president does have a role in the political system, especially at the establishment of a new government and the dissolution of the Bundestag (parliament). This role is usually nominal but can become significant in case of political instability. Additionally, a federal president together with the Federal Council can support the government in a &quot;legislatory emergency state&quot; to enable laws against the will of the Bundestag (Article 81 of the Basic Law). However, so far the federal president has never had to use these &quot;reserve powers&quot;.

===Head of government===

The &quot;Bundeskanzler&quot; (federal chancellor) heads the &quot;Bundesregierung&quot; (federal government) and thus the executive branch of the federal government. They are elected by and responsible to the &quot;Bundestag&quot;, Germany&#x27;s parliament. The other members of the government are the federal ministers; they are chosen by the Chancellor. Germany, like the United Kingdom, can thus be classified as a parliamentary system. The office is currently held by Olaf Scholz (since 2021). 

The Chancellor cannot be removed from office during a four-year term unless the &quot;Bundestag&quot; has agreed on a successor. This constructive vote of no confidence is intended to avoid a similar situation to that of the Weimar Republic in which the executive did not have enough support in the legislature to govern effectively, but the legislature was too divided to name a successor. The current system also prevents the Chancellor from calling a snap election.

Except in the periods 1969‚Äì1972 and 1976‚Äì1982, when the Social Democratic party of Chancellors Brandt and Schmidt came in second in the elections, the chancellor has always been the candidate of the largest party, usually supported by a coalition of two parties with a majority in the parliament. The chancellor appoints one of the federal ministers as their deputy, who has the unofficial title Vice Chancellor (). The office is currently held by Robert Habeck (since 2021). 

===Cabinet===
The German Cabinet ( or ) is the chief executive body of the Federal Republic of Germany. It consists of the chancellor and the cabinet ministers. The fundamentals of the cabinet&#x27;s organization are set down in articles 62‚Äì69 of the Basic Law. The current cabinet is Scholz (since 2021). 
===Agencies===


Agencies of the German government include:
*Federal Intelligence Service ()
*Federal Bureau of Aircraft Accident Investigation ()
*Federal Aviation Office ()
*Federal Bureau for Maritime Casualty Investigation ()
*Federal Maritime and Hydrographic Agency ()
*Federal Railway Accident Investigation Board ()
*Federal Railway Authority ()

==Legislature==
Federal legislative power is divided between the &quot;Bundestag&quot; and the &quot;Bundesrat&quot;. The &quot;Bundestag&quot; is directly elected by the German people, while the &quot;Bundesrat&quot; represents the governments of the regional states (&quot;L√§nder&quot;). The federal legislature has powers of exclusive jurisdiction and concurrent jurisdiction with the states in areas specified in the constitution.

The &quot;Bundestag&quot; is more powerful than the &quot;Bundesrat&quot; and only needs the latter&#x27;s consent for proposed legislation related to revenue shared by the federal and state governments, and the imposition of responsibilities on the states. In practice, however, the agreement of the &quot;Bundesrat&quot; in the legislative process is often required, since federal legislation frequently has to be executed by state or local agencies. In the event of disagreement between the &quot;Bundestag&quot; and the &quot;Bundesrat&quot;, either side can appeal to the (Mediation Committee), a conference committee-like body of 16 &quot;Bundesrat&quot; and 16 &quot;Bundestag&quot; members, to find a compromise.

===Bundestag===

The &quot;Bundestag&quot; (Federal Diet) is elected for a four-year term and consists of 598 or more members elected by a means of mixed-member proportional representation, which Germans call &quot;personalised proportional representation&quot;. 299 members represent single-seat constituencies and are elected by a first-past-the-post electoral system (Direktmandat), where others (Listenkandidat) are elected from a state list. 

A party must receive either 5% of the national vote or three direct constituencies to be eligible for non-constituency seats in the &quot;Bundestag&quot;. This rule, often called the &quot;five-percent hurdle&quot;, was incorporated into Germany&#x27;s election law to prevent political fragmentation and minority parties from becoming disproportionately influential. Parties representing ethnic minorities are exempt from this threshold. 

Parties that obtain fewer constituency seats than their national share of the vote are allotted seats from state party lists to make up the difference. In contrast, parties that obtain more constituency seats than their national share of the vote are allowed to keep these so-called overhang seats. In federal elections since 2013, other parties obtain extra seats (&quot;balance seats&quot;) that offset advantages from their rivals&#x27; overhang seats. The current &quot;Bundestag&quot; is the largest in German history with 736 members.

A 2023 reform of German election law limits the size of the &quot;Bundestag&quot; to 630 members for upcoming federal elections. Unless exempt from the hurdle, parties that do not make the 5% threshold will no longer be granted representation in parliament even if their candidates win three constituencies. In the same context, the system of overhang and balance seats will also be abolished. Opposition parties have announced they will challenge the decision in Federal Constitutional Court.

The first &quot;Bundestag&quot; elections were held in the Federal Republic of Germany (&quot;West Germany&quot;) on 14 August 1949. Following reunification, elections for the first all-German &quot;Bundestag&quot; were held on 2 December 1990. The last federal election was held on 23 February 2025.

==Judiciary==
Germany follows the civil law tradition. The judicial system comprises three types of courts.

* Ordinary courts, dealing with criminal and most civil cases, are the most numerous by far. The Federal Court of Justice of Germany () is the highest ordinary court and also the highest court of appeals.
* Specialized courts hear cases related to administrative, labour, social, fiscal and patent law.
* Constitutional court focus on judicial review and constitutional interpretation. The Federal Constitutional Court () is the highest court dealing with constitutional matters.

The main difference between the Federal Constitutional Court and the Federal Court of Justice is that the Federal Constitutional Court may only be called if a constitutional matter within a case is in question (e.g. a possible violation of human rights in a criminal trial), while the Federal Court of Justice may be called in any case.

==Foreign relations==
Germany maintains a network of 229 diplomatic missions abroad and holds relations with more than 190 countries. It is the largest contributor to the budget of the European Union (providing 27%) and third largest contributor to the United Nations (providing 8%). Germany is a member of the NATO defence alliance, the Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the G8, the G20, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF).

Germany has played a leading role in the European Union since its inception and has maintained a strong alliance with France since the end of World War II. The alliance was especially close in the late 1980s and early 1990s under the leadership of Christian Democrat Helmut Kohl and Socialist Fran√ßois Mitterrand. Germany is at the forefront of European states seeking to advance the creation of a more unified European political, defence, and security apparatus. For a number of decades after WWII, the Federal Republic of Germany kept a notably low profile in international relations, because of both its recent history and its occupation by foreign powers.

During the Cold War, Germany&#x27;s partition by the Iron Curtain made it a symbol of East‚ÄìWest tensions and a political battleground in Europe. However, Willy Brandt&#x27;s &quot;Ostpolitik&quot; was a key factor in the &quot;d√©tente&quot; of the 1970s. In 1999, Chancellor Gerhard Schr√∂der&#x27;s government defined a new basis for German foreign policy by taking a full part in the decisions surrounding the NATO war against Yugoslavia and by sending German troops into combat for the first time since World War II.

The governments of Germany and the United States are close political allies. The 1948 Marshall Plan and strong cultural ties have crafted a strong bond between the two countries, although Schr√∂der&#x27;s very vocal opposition to the Iraq War had suggested the end of Atlanticism and a relative cooling of German‚ÄìAmerican relations. The two countries are also economically interdependent: 5.0% of German exports in goods are US-bound and 3.5% of German imported goods originate from the US with a trade deficit of -63,678.5 million dollars for the United States (2017). Other signs of the close ties include the continuing position of German‚ÄìAmericans as the largest reported ethnic group in the US, and the status of Ramstein Air Base (near Kaiserslautern) as the largest US military community outside the US.

In 1952 the German government agreed to pay reparations to the Jewish state of Israel amounting to 3 billion marks, equivalent to $8.8 billion today, for the costs of &quot;resettling so great a number of uprooted and destitute Jewish refugees&quot; after the Second World War, and for compensating individual Jews for the losses of livelihood and property due to Nazi persecution, after there emerged a clear moral imperative for societal and political leaders to confront the past. Diplomatic relations were eventually established in 1965 after significant reconciliation efforts, particularly from religious institutions such as the German Coordinating-Council for Christian-Jewish cooperation and the Action Reconciliation Service for Peace. This context means that there is a special relationship between Germany and Israel which continues to the present day.

The policy on foreign aid is an important area of German foreign policy. It is formulated by the Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ) and carried out by the implementing organisations. The German government sees development policy as a joint responsibility of the international community. It is the world&#x27;s fourth biggest aid donor after the United States, the United Kingdom and France. Germany spent 0.37 per cent of its gross domestic product (GDP) on development, which is below the government&#x27;s target of increasing aid to 0.51 per cent of GDP by 2010.

==Administrative divisions==

Germany comprises sixteen states that are collectively referred to as . Due to differences in size and population, the subdivision of these states varies especially between city-states () and states with larger territories (). For regional administrative purposes five states, namely Baden-W√ºrttemberg, Bavaria, Hesse, North Rhine-Westphalia and Saxony, consist of a total of 22 Government Districts (). As of 2009 Germany is divided into 403 districts () on municipal level, these consist of 301 rural districts and 102 urban districts.

==Coalitions==
While East-Germany was under a single-party system, there was only a brief period when the SPD governed West-Germany alone on a federal level as a minority party following the dissolution of its coalition with the FDP in 1982. Otherwise, all governments in West- and post-reunification Germany have been coalitions between two or more parties. In German political tradition, these usually receive a name often based on the parties&#x27; colors:

*Grand coalition (describing a governing coalition of the parties Christian Democratic Union (CDU) along with its sister party the Christian Social Union of Bavaria (CSU) and the Social Democratic Party (SPD)) 
*Traffic light coalition (coalition government of the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD), the Free Democratic Party (FDP) and Alliance 90/The Greens)
*Jamaica coalition (describing a governing coalition among the parties of the Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union (CDU/CSU), Free Democratic Party (FDP), and the Green Party)
*Black-red-green coalition (a governing coalition among the parties of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), Social Democratic Party (SPD) and the Green Party)
*Red‚Äìred‚Äìgreen coalition (a coalition between the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD), The Left, and Alliance 90/The Greens) 
*Red‚Äìred coalition (a governing coalition among the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) and The Left party or its predecessor, the Party of Democratic Socialism (PDS))

Due to the cordon sanitaire (usually called , firewall, in Germany) all other parties have established against the AfD, hypothetical coalitions involving the AfD are rarely discussed. A coalition of CDU/CSU, AfD and FDP would have had a majority in the 20th Bundestag elected in 2021, but was not seriously discussed publicly by either media or politicians. Such a coalition does not have a common nickname, but the term &quot;Bahamas coalition&quot;, in reference to the colors of the flag of the Bahamas (including the AfD&#x27;s light blue), was coined in 2013. Other coalitions involving the AfD are considered even more unlikely due to lack of parliamentary majority, ideological differences and the cordon sanitaire.

== East-West Divide ==
The divide between the East and the West Germany can be seen in contemporary German elections. The Alternative for Germany (AfD), a right-wing populist party has a stronghold in the former East Germany. The left-wing populist Die Linke party (which has roots in the SED) used to have a stronghold in the East as well. The far-right National Democratic Party of Germany (NPD) used to have representation in the East where they were stronger. 

This is in stark distinction from West Germany where the more centrist parties such as the CDU/CSU, SPD, The Greens, and the FDP dominate.

<text>Geometry (from the ; &quot;&quot; &quot;earth&quot;, &quot;&quot; &quot;measurement&quot;) arose as the field of knowledge dealing with spatial relationships. Geometry was one of the two fields of pre-modern mathematics, the other being the study of numbers (arithmetic).

Classic geometry was focused in compass and straightedge constructions. Geometry was revolutionized by Euclid, who introduced mathematical rigor and the axiomatic method still in use today. His book, &quot;The Elements&quot; is widely considered the most influential textbook of all time, and was known to all educated people in the West until the middle of the 20th century.

In modern times, geometric concepts have been generalized to a high level of abstraction and complexity, and have been subjected to the methods of calculus and abstract algebra, so that many modern branches of the field are barely recognizable as the descendants of early geometry. (See Areas of mathematics and Algebraic geometry.)

==Early geometry==
The earliest recorded beginnings of geometry can be traced to early peoples, such as the ancient Indus Valley (see Harappan mathematics) and ancient Babylonia (see Babylonian mathematics) from around 3000¬†BC. Early geometry was a collection of empirically discovered principles concerning lengths, angles, areas, and volumes, which were developed to meet some practical need in surveying, construction, astronomy, and various crafts. Among these were some surprisingly sophisticated principles, and a modern mathematician might be hard put to derive some of them without the use of calculus and algebra. For example, both the Egyptians and the Babylonians were aware of versions of the Pythagorean theorem about 1500 years before Pythagoras and the Indian Sulba Sutras around 800¬†BC contained the first statements of the theorem; the Egyptians had a correct formula for the volume of a frustum of a square pyramid.

===Egyptian geometry===
The ancient Egyptians knew that they could approximate the area of a circle as follows:

::::Area of Circle ‚âà [ (Diameter) x 8/9 ]2.

Problem 50 of the Ahmes papyrus uses these methods to calculate the area of a circle, according to a rule that the area is equal to the square of 8/9 of the circle&#x27;s diameter. This assumes that  is 4√ó(8/9)2 (or 3.160493...), with an error of slightly over 0.63 percent. This value was slightly less accurate than the calculations of the Babylonians (25/8 = 3.125, within 0.53 percent), but was not otherwise surpassed until Archimedes&#x27; approximation of 211875/67441 = 3.14163, which had an error of just over 1 in 10,000.

Ahmes knew of the modern 22/7 as an approximation for , and used it to split a hekat, hekat x 22/x x 7/22 = hekat; however, Ahmes continued to use the traditional 256/81 value for for computing his hekat volume found in a cylinder.

Problem 48 involved using a square with side 9 units. This square was cut into a 3x3 grid. The diagonal of the corner squares were used to make an irregular octagon with an area of 63 units. This gave a second value for of 3.111...

The two problems together indicate a range of values for between 3.11 and 3.16.

Problem 14 in the Moscow Mathematical Papyrus gives the only ancient example finding the volume of a frustum of a pyramid, describing the correct formula:
:formula_1
where &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; are the base and top side lengths of the truncated pyramid and &quot;h&quot; is the height.

===Babylonian geometry===
The Babylonians may have known the general rules for measuring areas and volumes. They measured the circumference of a circle as three times the diameter and the area as one-twelfth the square of the circumference, which would be correct if &quot;œÄ&quot; is estimated as 3. The volume of a cylinder was taken as the product of the base and the height, however, the volume of the frustum of a cone or a square pyramid was incorrectly taken as the product of the height and half the sum of the bases. The Pythagorean theorem was also known to the Babylonians. Also, there was a recent discovery in which a tablet used &quot;œÄ&quot; as 3 and 1/8. The Babylonians are also known for the Babylonian mile, which was a measure of distance equal to about seven miles today. This measurement for distances eventually was converted to a time-mile used for measuring the travel of the Sun, therefore, representing time. There have been recent discoveries showing that ancient Babylonians may have discovered astronomical geometry nearly 1400 years before Europeans did.

===Vedic India geometry===
The Indian Vedic period had a tradition of geometry, mostly expressed in the construction of elaborate altars.
Early Indian texts (1st millennium BC) on this topic include the &quot;Satapatha Brahmana&quot; and the &quot;≈öulba S≈´tras&quot;.

The &quot;≈öulba S≈´tras&quot; has been described as &quot;the earliest extant verbal expression of the Pythagorean Theorem in the world, although it had already been known to the Old Babylonians.&quot; They make use of Pythagorean triples, which are particular cases of Diophantine equations.

According to mathematician S. G. Dani, the Babylonian cuneiform tablet Plimpton 322 written c. 1850 BC &quot;contains fifteen Pythagorean triples with quite large entries, including (13500, 12709, 18541) which is a primitive triple, indicating, in particular, that there was sophisticated understanding on the topic&quot; in Mesopotamia in 1850¬†BC. &quot;Since these tablets predate the Sulbasutras period by several centuries, taking into account the contextual appearance of some of the triples, it is reasonable to expect that similar understanding would have been there in India.&quot; Dani goes on to say:

 As the main objective of the &quot;Sulvasutras&quot; was to describe the constructions of altars and the geometric principles involved in them, the subject of Pythagorean triples, even if it had been well understood may still not have featured in the &quot;Sulvasutras&quot;. The occurrence of the triples in the &quot;Sulvasutras&quot; is comparable to mathematics that one may encounter in an introductory book on architecture or another similar applied area, and would not correspond directly to the overall knowledge on the topic at that time. Since, unfortunately, no other contemporaneous sources have been found it may never be possible to settle this issue satisfactorily.

==Greek geometry==
=== Thales and Pythagoras ===

Thales (635‚Äì543 BC) of Miletus (now in southwestern Turkey), was the first to whom deduction in mathematics is attributed. There are five geometric propositions for which he wrote deductive proofs, though his proofs have not survived. Pythagoras (582‚Äì496 BC) of Ionia, and later, Italy, then colonized by Greeks, may have been a student of Thales, and traveled to Babylon and Egypt. The theorem that bears his name may not have been his discovery, but he was probably one of the first to give a deductive proof of it. He gathered a group of students around him to study mathematics, music, and philosophy, and together they discovered most of what high school students learn today in their geometry courses. In addition, they made the profound discovery of incommensurable lengths and irrational numbers.

=== Plato ===
Plato (427‚Äì347 BC) was a philosopher, highly esteemed by the Greeks. There is a story that he had inscribed above the entrance to his famous school, &quot;Let none ignorant of geometry enter here.&quot; However, the story is considered to be untrue. Though he was not a mathematician himself, his views on mathematics had great influence. Mathematicians thus accepted his belief that geometry should use no tools but compass and straightedge ‚Äì never measuring instruments such as a marked ruler or a protractor, because these were a workman&#x27;s tools, not worthy of a scholar. This dictum led to a deep study of possible compass and straightedge constructions, and three classic construction problems: how to use these tools to trisect an angle, to construct a cube twice the volume of a given cube, and to construct a square equal in area to a given circle. The proofs of the impossibility of these constructions, finally achieved in the 19th century, led to important principles regarding the deep structure of the real number system. Aristotle (384‚Äì322 BC), Plato&#x27;s greatest pupil, wrote a treatise on methods of reasoning used in deductive proofs (see Logic) which was not substantially improved upon until the 19th century.

===Hellenistic geometry===

====Euclid====


Euclid (c. 325‚Äì265 BC), of Alexandria, probably a student at the Academy founded by Plato, wrote a treatise in 13 books (chapters), titled &quot;The Elements of Geometry&quot;, in which he presented geometry in an ideal axiomatic form, which came to be known as Euclidean geometry. The treatise is not a compendium of all that the Hellenistic mathematicians knew at the time about geometry; Euclid himself wrote eight more advanced books on geometry. We know from other references that Euclid&#x27;s was not the first elementary geometry textbook, but it was so much superior that the others fell into disuse and were lost. He was brought to the university at Alexandria by Ptolemy I, King of Egypt.

&quot;The Elements&quot; began with definitions of terms, fundamental geometric principles (called &quot;axioms&quot; or &quot;postulates&quot;), and general quantitative principles (called &quot;common notions&quot;) from which all the rest of geometry could be logically deduced. Following are his five axioms, somewhat paraphrased to make the English easier to read.

# Any two points can be joined by a straight line.
# Any finite straight line can be extended in a straight line.
# A circle can be drawn with any center and any radius.
# All right angles are equal to each other.
# If two straight lines in a plane are crossed by another straight line (called the transversal), and the interior angles between the two lines and the transversal lying on one side of the transversal add up to less than two right angles, then on that side of the transversal, the two lines extended will intersect (also called the parallel postulate).

Concepts, that are now understood as algebra, were expressed geometrically by Euclid, a method referred to as Greek geometric algebra.

====Archimedes====

Archimedes (287‚Äì212 BC), of Syracuse, Sicily, when it was a Greek city-state, was one of the most famous mathematicians of the Hellenistic period. He is known for his formulation of a hydrostatic principle (known as Archimedes&#x27; principle) and for his works on geometry, including Measurement of the Circle and On Conoids and Spheroids. His work On Floating Bodies is the first known work on hydrostatics, of which Archimedes is recognized as the founder. Renaissance translations of his works, including the ancient commentaries, were enormously influential in the work of some of the best mathematicians of the 17th century, notably Ren√© Descartes and Pierre de Fermat.

====After Archimedes====

After Archimedes, Hellenistic mathematics began to decline. There were a few minor stars yet to come, but the golden age of geometry was over. Proclus (410‚Äì485), author of &quot;Commentary on the First Book of Euclid&quot;, was one of the last important players in Hellenistic geometry. He was a competent geometer, but more importantly, he was a superb commentator on the works that preceded him. Much of that work did not survive to modern times, and is known to us only through his commentary. The Roman Republic and Empire that succeeded and absorbed the Greek city-states produced excellent engineers, but no mathematicians of note.

The great Library of Alexandria was later burned. There is a growing consensus among historians that the Library of Alexandria likely suffered from several destructive events, but that the destruction of Alexandria&#x27;s pagan temples in the late 4th century was probably the most severe and final one. The evidence for that destruction is the most definitive and secure. Caesar&#x27;s invasion may well have led to the loss of some 40,000‚Äì70,000 scrolls in a warehouse adjacent to the port (as Luciano Canfora argues, they were likely copies produced by the Library intended for export), but it is unlikely to have affected the Library or Museum, given that there is ample evidence that both existed later.

Civil wars, decreasing investments in maintenance and acquisition of new scrolls and generally declining interest in non-religious pursuits likely contributed to a reduction in the body of material available in the Library, especially in the 4th century. The Serapeum was certainly destroyed by Theophilus in 391, and the Museum and Library may have fallen victim to the same campaign.

==Classical Indian geometry==
In the Bakhshali manuscript, there is a handful of geometric problems (including problems about volumes of irregular solids). The Bakhshali manuscript also &quot;employs a decimal place value system with a dot for zero.&quot; Aryabhata&#x27;s &quot;Aryabhatiya&quot; (499) includes the computation of areas and volumes.

Brahmagupta wrote his astronomical work &quot;&quot; in 628. Chapter 12, containing 66 Sanskrit verses, was divided into two sections: &quot;basic operations&quot; (including cube roots, fractions, ratio and proportion, and barter) and &quot;practical mathematics&quot; (including mixture, mathematical series, plane figures, stacking bricks, sawing of timber, and piling of grain). In the latter section, he stated his famous theorem on the diagonals of a cyclic quadrilateral:

Brahmagupta&#x27;s theorem: If a cyclic quadrilateral has diagonals that are perpendicular to each other, then the perpendicular line drawn from the point of intersection of the diagonals to any side of the quadrilateral always bisects the opposite side.

Chapter 12 also included a formula for the area of a cyclic quadrilateral (a generalization of Heron&#x27;s formula), as well as a complete description of rational triangles (&quot;i.e.&quot; triangles with rational sides and rational areas).

Brahmagupta&#x27;s formula: The area, &quot;A&quot;, of a cyclic quadrilateral with sides of lengths &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;, &quot;d&quot;, respectively, is given by

: formula_2

where &quot;s&quot;, the semiperimeter, given by: formula_3

Brahmagupta&#x27;s Theorem on rational triangles: A triangle with rational sides formula_4 and rational area is of the form:

:formula_5
for some rational numbers formula_6 and formula_7.

Parameshvara Nambudiri was the first mathematician to give a formula for the radius of the circle circumscribing a cyclic quadrilateral. The expression is sometimes attributed to Lhuilier [1782], 350 years later. With the sides of the cyclic quadrilateral being &quot;a, b, c,&quot; and &quot;d&quot;, the radius &quot;R&quot; of the circumscribed circle is:
:formula_8

==Chinese geometry==


The first definitive work (or at least oldest existent) on geometry in China was the &quot;Mo Jing&quot;, the Mohist canon of the early philosopher Mozi (470‚Äì390 BC). It was compiled years after his death by his followers around the year 330 BC. Although the &quot;Mo Jing&quot; is the oldest existent book on geometry in China, there is the possibility that even older written material existed. However, due to the infamous Burning of the Books in a political maneuver by the Qin dynasty ruler Qin Shihuang (r. 221‚Äì210 BC), multitudes of written literature created before his time were purged. In addition, the &quot;Mo Jing&quot; presents geometrical concepts in mathematics that are perhaps too advanced not to have had a previous geometrical base or mathematic background to work upon.

The &quot;Mo Jing&quot; described various aspects of many fields associated with physical science, and provided a small wealth of information on mathematics as well. It provided an &#x27;atomic&#x27; definition of the geometric point, stating that a line is separated into parts, and the part which has no remaining parts (i.e. cannot be divided into smaller parts) and thus forms the extreme end of a line is a point. Much like Euclid&#x27;s first and third definitions and Plato&#x27;s &#x27;beginning of a line&#x27;, the &quot;Mo Jing&quot; stated that &quot;a point may stand at the end (of a line) or at its beginning like a head-presentation in childbirth. (As to its invisibility) there is nothing similar to it.&quot; Similar to the atomists of Democritus, the &quot;Mo Jing&quot; stated that a point is the smallest unit, and cannot be cut in half, since &#x27;nothing&#x27; cannot be halved. It stated that two lines of equal length will always finish at the same place, while providing definitions for the &quot;comparison of lengths&quot; and for &quot;parallels&quot;, along with principles of space and bounded space. It also described the fact that planes without the quality of thickness cannot be piled up since they cannot mutually touch. The book provided definitions for circumference, diameter, and radius, along with the definition of volume.

The Han dynasty (202 BC¬†‚Äì 220 AD) period of China witnessed a new flourishing of mathematics. One of the oldest Chinese mathematical texts to present geometric progressions was the &quot;Su√†n sh√π sh≈´&quot; of 186 BC, during the Western Han era. The mathematician, inventor, and astronomer Zhang Heng (78‚Äì139 AD) used geometrical formulas to solve mathematical problems. Although rough estimates for pi (œÄ) were given in the &quot;Zhou Li&quot; (compiled in the 2nd century BC), it was Zhang Heng who was the first to make a concerted effort at creating a more accurate formula for pi. Zhang Heng approximated pi as 730/232 (or approx 3.1466), although he used another formula of pi in finding a spherical volume, using the square root of 10 (or approx 3.162) instead. Zu Chongzhi (429‚Äì500 AD) improved the accuracy of the approximation of pi to between 3.1415926 and 3.1415927, with 355‚ÅÑ113 (ÂØÜÁéá, Mil√º, detailed approximation) and 22‚ÅÑ7 (Á∫¶Áéá, Yuel√º, rough approximation) being the other notable approximation. In comparison to later works, the formula for pi given by the French mathematician Franciscus Vieta (1540‚Äì1603) fell halfway between Zu&#x27;s approximations.

===&quot;The Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art&quot;===
&quot;The Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art&quot;, the title of which first appeared by 179¬†AD on a bronze inscription, was edited and commented on by the 3rd century mathematician Liu Hui from the Kingdom of Cao Wei. This book included many problems where geometry was applied, such as finding surface areas for squares and circles, the volumes of solids in various three-dimensional shapes, and included the use of the Pythagorean theorem. The book provided illustrated proof for the Pythagorean theorem, contained a written dialogue between of the earlier Duke of Zhou and Shang Gao on the properties of the right angle triangle and the Pythagorean theorem, while also referring to the astronomical gnomon, the circle and square, as well as measurements of heights and distances. The editor Liu Hui listed pi as 3.141014 by using a 192 sided polygon, and then calculated pi as 3.14159 using a 3072 sided polygon. This was more accurate than Liu Hui&#x27;s contemporary Wang Fan, a mathematician and astronomer from Eastern Wu, would render pi as 3.1555 by using 142‚ÅÑ45. Liu Hui also wrote of mathematical surveying to calculate distance measurements of depth, height, width, and surface area. In terms of solid geometry, he figured out that a wedge with rectangular base and both sides sloping could be broken down into a pyramid and a tetrahedral wedge. He also figured out that a wedge with trapezoid base and both sides sloping could be made to give two tetrahedral wedges separated by a pyramid. Furthermore, Liu Hui described Cavalieri&#x27;s principle on volume, as well as Gaussian elimination. From the &quot;Nine Chapters&quot;, it listed the following geometrical formulas that were known by the time of the Former Han dynasty (202 BCE¬†‚Äì 9 CE).

Continuing the geometrical legacy of ancient China, there were many later figures to come, including the famed astronomer and mathematician Shen Kuo (1031‚Äì1095 CE), Yang Hui (1238‚Äì1298) who discovered Pascal&#x27;s Triangle, Xu Guangqi (1562‚Äì1633), and many others.

==Islamic Golden Age==

ThƒÅbit ibn Qurra, using what he called the method of reduction and composition, provided two different general proofs of the Pythagorean theorem for all triangles, before which proofs only existed for the theorem for the special cases of a special right triangle.

A 2007 paper in the journal &quot;Science&quot; suggested that girih tiles possessed properties consistent with self-similar fractal quasicrystalline tilings such as the Penrose tilings.

==Renaissance==
The transmission of the Greek Classics to medieval Europe via the Arabic literature of the 9th to 10th century &quot;Islamic Golden Age&quot; began in the 10th century and culminated in the Latin translations of the 12th century.
A copy of Ptolemy&#x27;s &quot;Almagest&quot; was brought back to Sicily by Henry Aristippus (d. 1162), as a gift from the Emperor to King William I (r. 1154‚Äì1166). An anonymous student at Salerno travelled to Sicily and translated the &quot;Almagest&quot; as well as several works by Euclid from Greek to Latin. Although the Sicilians generally translated directly from the Greek, when Greek texts were not available, they would translate from Arabic. Eugenius of Palermo (d. 1202) translated Ptolemy&#x27;s &quot;Optics&quot; into Latin, drawing on his knowledge of all three languages in the task. The rigorous deductive methods of geometry found in Euclid&#x27;s &quot;Elements of Geometry&quot; were relearned, and further development of geometry in the styles of both Euclid (Euclidean geometry) and Khayyam (algebraic geometry) continued, resulting in an abundance of new theorems and concepts, many of them very profound and elegant.

Advances in the treatment of perspective were made in Renaissance art of the 14th to 15th century which went beyond what had been achieved in antiquity. 
In Renaissance architecture of the &quot;Quattrocento&quot;, concepts of architectural order were explored and rules were formulated. A prime example of is the Basilica di San Lorenzo in Florence by Filippo Brunelleschi (1377‚Äì1446).

In c. 1413 Filippo Brunelleschi demonstrated the geometrical method of perspective, used today by artists, by painting the outlines of various Florentine buildings onto a mirror. 
Soon after, nearly every artist in Florence and in Italy used geometrical perspective in their paintings, notably Masolino da Panicale and Donatello. Melozzo da Forl√¨ first used the technique of upward foreshortening (in Rome, Loreto, Forl√¨ and others), and was celebrated for that. Not only was perspective a way of showing depth, it was also a new method of composing a painting. Paintings began to show a single, unified scene, rather than a combination of several.

As shown by the quick proliferation of accurate perspective paintings in Florence, Brunelleschi likely understood (with help from his friend the mathematician Toscanelli), but did not publish, the mathematics behind perspective. Decades later, his friend Leon Battista Alberti wrote &quot;De pictura&quot; (1435/1436), a treatise on proper methods of showing distance in painting based on Euclidean geometry. Alberti was also trained in the science of optics through the school of Padua and under the influence of Biagio Pelacani da Parma who studied Alhazen&#x27;s &quot;Optics&quot;.

Piero della Francesca elaborated on Della Pittura in his &quot;De Prospectiva Pingendi&quot; in the 1470s. Alberti had limited himself to figures on the ground plane and giving an overall basis for perspective. Della Francesca fleshed it out, explicitly covering solids in any area of the picture plane. Della Francesca also started the now common practice of using illustrated figures to explain the mathematical concepts, making his treatise easier to understand than Alberti&#x27;s. Della Francesca was also the first to accurately draw the Platonic solids as they would appear in perspective.

Perspective remained, for a while, the domain of Florence. Jan van Eyck, among others, was unable to create a consistent structure for the converging lines in paintings, as in London&#x27;s The Arnolfini Portrait, because he was unaware of the theoretical breakthrough just then occurring in Italy. However he achieved very subtle effects by manipulations of scale in his interiors. Gradually, and partly through the movement of academies of the arts, the Italian techniques became part of the training of artists across Europe, and later other parts of the world.
The culmination of these Renaissance traditions finds its ultimate synthesis in the research of the architect, geometer, and optician Girard Desargues on perspective, optics and projective geometry.

The &quot;Vitruvian Man&quot; by Leonardo da Vinci (c. 1490) depicts a man in two superimposed positions with his arms and legs apart and inscribed in a circle and square. The drawing is based on the correlations of ideal human proportions with geometry described by the ancient Roman architect Vitruvius in Book III of his treatise &quot;De Architectura&quot;.

==Modern geometry==

===The 17th century===

In the early 17th century, there were two important developments in geometry. The first and most important was the creation of analytic geometry, or geometry with coordinates and equations, by Ren√© Descartes (1596‚Äì1650) and Pierre de Fermat (1601‚Äì1665). This was a necessary precursor to the development of calculus and a precise quantitative science of physics. The second geometric development of this period was the systematic study of projective geometry by Girard Desargues (1591‚Äì1661). Projective geometry is the study of geometry without measurement, just the study of how points align with each other. There had been some early work in this area by Hellenistic geometers, notably Pappus (c.¬†340). The greatest flowering of the field occurred with Jean-Victor Poncelet (1788‚Äì1867).

In the late 17th century, calculus was developed independently and almost simultaneously by Isaac Newton (1642‚Äì1727) and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz (1646‚Äì1716). This was the beginning of a new field of mathematics now called analysis. Though not itself a branch of geometry, it is applicable to geometry, and it solved two families of problems that had long been almost intractable: finding tangent lines to odd curves, and finding areas enclosed by those curves. The methods of calculus reduced these problems mostly to straightforward matters of computation.

===The 18th and 19th centuries===

====Non-Euclidean geometry====
The very old problem of proving Euclid&#x27;s Fifth Postulate, the &quot;Parallel Postulate&quot;, from his first four postulates had never been forgotten. Beginning not long after Euclid, many attempted demonstrations were given, but all were later found to be faulty, through allowing into the reasoning some principle which itself had not been proved from the first four postulates. Though Omar Khayy√°m was also unsuccessful in proving the parallel postulate, his criticisms of Euclid&#x27;s theories of parallels and his proof of properties of figures in non-Euclidean geometries contributed to the eventual development of non-Euclidean geometry. By 1700 a great deal had been discovered about what can be proved from the first four, and what the pitfalls were in attempting to prove the fifth. Saccheri, Lambert, and Legendre each did excellent work on the problem in the 18th century, but still fell short of success. In the early 19th century, Gauss, Johann Bolyai, and Lobachevsky, each independently, took a different approach. Beginning to suspect that it was impossible to prove the Parallel Postulate, they set out to develop a self-consistent geometry in which that postulate was false. In this they were successful, thus creating the first non-Euclidean geometry. By 1854, Bernhard Riemann, a student of Gauss, had applied methods of calculus in a ground-breaking study of the intrinsic (self-contained) geometry of all smooth surfaces, and thereby found a different non-Euclidean geometry. This work of Riemann later became fundamental for Einstein&#x27;s theory of relativity.

It remained to be proved mathematically that the non-Euclidean geometry was just as self-consistent as Euclidean geometry, and this was first accomplished by Beltrami in 1868. With this, non-Euclidean geometry was established on an equal mathematical footing with Euclidean geometry.

While it was now known that different geometric theories were mathematically possible, the question remained, &quot;Which one of these theories is correct for our physical space?&quot; The mathematical work revealed that this question must be answered by physical experimentation, not mathematical reasoning, and uncovered the reason why the experimentation must involve immense (interstellar, not earth-bound) distances. With the development of relativity theory in physics, this question became vastly more complicated.

====Introduction of mathematical rigor====
All the work related to the Parallel Postulate revealed that it was quite difficult for a geometer to separate his logical reasoning from his intuitive understanding of physical space, and, moreover, revealed the critical importance of doing so. Careful examination had uncovered some logical inadequacies in Euclid&#x27;s reasoning, and some unstated geometric principles to which Euclid sometimes appealed. This critique paralleled the crisis occurring in calculus and analysis regarding the meaning of infinite processes such as convergence and continuity. In geometry, there was a clear need for a new set of axioms, which would be complete, and which in no way relied on pictures we draw or on our intuition of space. Such axioms, now known as Hilbert&#x27;s axioms, were given by David Hilbert in 1894 in his dissertation &quot;Grundlagen der Geometrie&quot; (&quot;Foundations of Geometry&quot;).

====Analysis situs, or topology====
In the mid-18th century, it became apparent that certain progressions of mathematical reasoning recurred when similar ideas were studied on the number line, in two dimensions, and in three dimensions. Thus the general concept of a metric space was created so that the reasoning could be done in more generality, and then applied to special cases. This method of studying calculus- and analysis-related concepts came to be known as analysis situs, and later as topology. The important topics in this field were properties of more general figures, such as connectedness and boundaries, rather than properties like straightness, and precise equality of length and angle measurements, which had been the focus of Euclidean and non-Euclidean geometry. Topology soon became a separate field of major importance, rather than a sub-field of geometry or analysis.

====Geometry of more than 3 dimensions====
The 19th century saw the development of the general concept of Euclidean space by Ludwig Schl√§fli, who extended Euclidean geometry beyond three dimensions. He discovered all the higher-dimensional analogues of the Platonic solids, finding that there are exactly six such regular convex polytopes in dimension four, and three in all higher dimensions.

In 1878 William Kingdon Clifford introduced what is now termed geometric algebra, unifying William Rowan Hamilton&#x27;s quaternions with Hermann Grassmann&#x27;s algebra and revealing the geometric nature of these systems, especially in four dimensions. The operations of geometric algebra have the effect of mirroring, rotating, translating, and mapping the geometric objects that are being modeled to new positions.

===The 20th century===
Developments in algebraic geometry included the study of curves and surfaces over finite fields as demonstrated by the works of among others Andr√© Weil, Alexander Grothendieck, and Jean-Pierre Serre as well as over the real or complex numbers. Finite geometry itself, the study of spaces with only finitely many points, found applications in coding theory and cryptography. With the advent of the computer, new disciplines such as computational geometry or digital geometry deal with geometric algorithms, discrete representations of geometric data, and so forth.
