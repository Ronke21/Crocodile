<text>First aid is the first and immediate assistance given to any person with a medical emergency, with care provided to preserve life, prevent the condition from worsening, or to promote recovery until medical services arrive. First aid is generally performed by someone with basic medical or first response training. Mental health first aid is an extension of the concept of first aid to cover mental health, while psychological first aid is used as early treatment of people who are at risk for developing PTSD. Conflict first aid, focused on preservation and recovery of an individual&#x27;s social or relationship well-being, is being piloted in Canada.

There are many situations that may require first aid, and many countries have legislation, regulation, or guidance, which specifies a minimum level of first aid provision in certain circumstances. This can include specific training or equipment to be available in the workplace (such as an automated external defibrillator), the provision of specialist first aid cover at public gatherings, or mandatory first aid training within schools. Generally, five steps are associated with first aid:

# Assess the surrounding areas.
# Move to a safe surrounding (if not already; for example, road accidents are unsafe to be dealt with on roads).
# Call for help: both professional medical help and people nearby who might help in first aid such as the compressions of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR).
# Perform suitable first aid depending on the injury suffered by the casualty.
# Evaluate the casualty for any fatal signs of danger, or possibility of performing the first aid again.

==Early history and warfare==

Skills of what is now known as first aid have been recorded throughout history, especially in relation to warfare, where the care of both traumatic and medical cases is required in particularly large numbers. The bandaging of battle wounds is shown on Classical Greek pottery from , whilst the parable of the Good Samaritan includes references to binding or dressing wounds. There are numerous references to first aid performed within the Roman army, with a system of first aid supported by surgeons, field ambulances, and hospitals. Roman legions had the specific role of capsarii, who were responsible for first aid such as bandaging, and are the forerunners of the modern combat medic.

Further examples occur through history, still mostly related to battle, with examples such as the Knights Hospitaller in the 11th century AD, providing care to pilgrims and knights in the Holy Land.

===Formalization of life saving treatments===
During the late 18th century, drowning as a cause of death was a major concern amongst the population. In 1767, a society for the preservation of life from accidents in water was started in Amsterdam, and in 1773, physician William Hawes began publicizing the power of artificial respiration as means of resuscitation of those who appeared drowned. This led to the formation, in 1774, of the Society for the Recovery of Persons Apparently Drowned, later the Royal Humane Society, who did much to promote resuscitation.

Napoleon&#x27;s surgeon, Baron Dominique-Jean Larrey, is credited with creating an ambulance corps, the &quot;ambulance volantes&quot;, which included medical assistants, tasked to administer first aid in battle.

In 1859, Swiss businessman Jean-Henri Dunant witnessed the aftermath of the Battle of Solferino, and his work led to the formation of the Red Cross, with a key stated aim of &quot;aid to sick and wounded soldiers in the field&quot;. The Red Cross and Red Crescent are still the largest provider of first aid worldwide.

In 1870, Prussian military surgeon Friedrich von Esmarch introduced formalized first aid to the military, and first coined the term &quot;erste hilfe&quot; (translating to &#x27;first aid&#x27;), including training for soldiers in the Franco-Prussian War on care for wounded comrades using pre-learnt bandaging and splinting skills, and making use of the Esmarch bandage which he designed. The bandage was issued as standard to the Prussian combatants, and also included aide-memoire pictures showing common uses.

In 1872, the Order of Saint John of Jerusalem in England changed its focus from hospice care, and set out to start a system of practical medical help, starting with making a grant towards the establishment of the UK&#x27;s first ambulance service. This was followed by creating its own wheeled transport litter in 1875 (the St John Ambulance), and in 1877 established the St John Ambulance Association (the forerunner of modern-day St John Ambulance) &quot;to train men and women for the benefit of the sick and wounded&quot;.

Also in the UK, Surgeon-Major Peter Shepherd had seen the advantages of von Esmarch&#x27;s new teaching of first aid, and introduced an equivalent programme for the British Army, and so being the first user of &quot;first aid for the injured&quot; in English, disseminating information through a series of lectures. Following this, in 1878, Shepherd and Colonel Francis Duncan took advantage of the newly charitable focus of St John, and established the concept of teaching first aid skills to civilians. The first classes were conducted in the hall of the Presbyterian school in Woolwich (near Woolwich barracks where Shepherd was based) using a comprehensive first aid curriculum.

First aid training began to spread through the British Empire through organisations such as St John, often starting, as in the UK, with high risk activities such as ports and railways.

The first recorded first aid training in the United States took place in Jermyn, Pennsylvania in 1899.

== Main emergences that require first aid and their corresponding cares ==
List of some situations that require specific first aid, and information about them (in alphabetical order):

=== Bleeding ===

A bleeding or hemorrhage is the uncontrolled escape of blood from any vein or artery.

In wounds that are caused by an external agent, there can be an additional risk of infection.

=== Cardiac arrest (total stop of heartbeat) ===
A cardiac arrest is the complete stop of heart function.

=== Choking ===
A choking is an obstruction in the airway

=== Diabetes, hyperglycemia ===
A hyperglycemia or hyperglycaemia is an excessive level of blood sugars.

=== Diabetes, hypoglycemia ===
A hypoglycemia or hypoglycaemia is an excessive fall of blood sugars in a diabetic patient.

It almost always occurs because of a problem with a medication to reduce the sugar level in blood.

=== Drowning ===
A drowning is a suffocation into a liquid substance.

First aid for drowning are very similar to those for cardiorespiratory arrest, but starting with 2 initial ventilations.

=== Infarction of the heart ===
A cardiac infarction is the sudden lack of blood supply to the heart, normally because of a problem in one of its arteries.

=== Stroke ===
A stroke is a sudden lack of blood supply to the brain.

==Aims of first aid==
The primary goal of first aid is to prevent death or serious injury from worsening. The key aims of first aid can be summarized with the acronym of &#x27;the three Ps&#x27;:

* Preserve life: The overriding aim of all medical care which includes first aid, is to save lives and minimize the threat of death. First aid done correctly should help reduce the patient&#x27;s level of pain and calm them down during the evaluation and treatment process.
* Prevent further harm: Prevention of further harm includes addressing both external factors, such as moving a patient away from any cause of harm, and applying first aid techniques to prevent worsening of the condition, such as applying pressure to stop a bleed from becoming dangerous.
* Promote recovery: First aid also involves trying to start the recovery process from the illness or injury, and in some cases might involve completing a treatment, such as in the case of applying a plaster to a small wound.

First aid is not medical treatment, and cannot be compared with what a trained medical professional provides. First aid involves making common sense decisions in the best interest of an injured person.

==Setting the priorities==
A first aid intervention would follow an order, which would try to attend in the best manner the main threats for the life and mobility of the victim.

There are some first aid protocols (such as ATLS, BATLS and SAFE-POINT) that define which are the priorities and the correct execution of the steps for saving human life. A major benefit of the use of official protocols is that they require minimum resources, time and skills, and have a great degree of success.

=== ABCDE and csABCDE general protocol ===
The ABCDE method is the general protocol of first aid and implies a quite general view.

It was initially developed by Dr Peter Safar in the 1950s. But it has received some modifications, improvements and variations that were intended for more specific contexts. For example: it has been completed with improvements from the ATLS (Advanced Trauma Life Support) version of the American College of Surgeons and the BATLS (Battlefield Advanced Trauma Life Support) version of the British Army.

As a result, the mnemonic of the steps of this protocol is ABCDE, or its improved version (cs)ABCDE (sometimes called xABCDE, the words in the mnemonic may vary), which represent:
—An attached first part (named as &quot;cs&quot; or &quot;x&quot;, or in any other way) that will always mention stopping the critical losses of blood and managing with a special and careful treatment to patients with serious damages at the spine that threaten their future mobility:

* catastrophic-bleeding (stopping urgently the massive external bleedings, as it is marked in the BATLS version).
* spine-protection (previous examination of the spine, and careful preventive treatment for its damages, as it is marked in the ATLS version).
—The ABCDE protocol itself:
*Airway (clearing airways).
*Breathing (ensuring respiration).
* Circulation (ensuring effective cardiac output).Any Defibrillation process for a cardiac arrest (total stop of heartbeat) would be included here, or in &#x27;Disability&#x27; (as a double mnemonic &#x27;D&#x27;).
* Disability (neurological condition, level of glucose can also be examined).
* Exposure (or &#x27;Evaluate&#x27;: other questions in an overall examination of the patient, environment).

=== ABC and CABD cardiopulmonary resuscitation protocol ===
This protocol (originally named as ABC) is a simplified version or concrete application of the previous csABCDE (or ABCDE) protocol, that focuses in the use of cardio-pulmonary resuscitation. The American Heart Association and the International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation teach it as a reference.

Its current mnemonic is CABD (an improvement in the sequence for most of the cases):

* Circulation or Chest Compressions.
* Airway: attempt to open the airway (using a head-tilt and chin-lift technique; not in the case of babies, which require avoid tilting the head).
* Breathing or Rescue Breaths.
* Defibrillation: use of an automated external defibrillator to recover heart function.

=== Wider protocols ===
These are the protocols that do not only deal with direct care to the victim but they also mention other complementary tasks (before and later).

==== European protocol ====
This method has been studied and employed for a long time in many European countries, as France. It is a reference, of a certain reputation, that could be applied solely or to a certain degree, usually combining it with the common csABCDE (ABCDE) method or its simplified CABD (ABC) variant about cardio-pulmonary resuscitation. The European method has a wider range than them, and their steps include tasks that are previous to the first aid techniques themselves.

These are its steps (with no official mnemonic that helps to remember them):

* Protection for patients and rescuers. If dangers are present, the patient would be moved to a safer place with a careful management of any detected spinal injury.
* Evaluation of the patient (looking for priorities as critical bleeding and cardiac arrest).
* Alerting to medical services and bystanders.
* Performing the first aid practices. The CABD (or ABC) method for cardio-pulmonary resuscitation and many details of the wider csABCDE (or ABCDE) method would be included in this step.

=== Other mentionable protocols ===
Some other known protocols that could be mentioned in many contexts (in alphabetical order):

AMEGA protocol

It is similar to the European protocol, because it also has a wider range than the common csABCDE (or ABCDE) protocol, and includes other tasks that are previous to the first aid techniques themselves. The order of the steps is changed, and the experience with it is lesser, but it adds the idea of a posterior &#x27;aftermath&#x27; phase.

The mnemonic AMEGA refers to:

* &quot;Assess&quot; the situation, looking for risks.
* &quot;Make safe&quot; the situation, after having identified the risks.
* &quot;Emergency aid&quot;. Performing the first aid practices.
* &quot;Get help&quot;. Asking for emergency help to medical services and bystanders.
* &quot;Aftermath&quot;. The aftermath tasks include recording and reporting, continued care of patients and the welfare of responders and the replacement of used first aid kit elements.
ATLS and BATLS protocols
They are basically the common ABCDE and csABCDE protocol, but focusing in particular aspects.

The ATLS (Advanced Trauma Life Support) version was developed by the American College of Surgeons, focusing in the particular needs of trauma and specifically in the spinal injuries. And the BATLS (Battlefield Advanced Trauma Life Support) version is an improvement for the British Army that added the concept of &#x27;catastrophic bleeding&#x27;.

The preference for one or another among all these protocols can depend on the context and the audience.

==== Check, Call and Care protocol ====
It comes from Red Cross and, as the European protocol, has a wider range than the common csABCDE (ABCDE) method. So it could be seen as a simplification of the European protocol, and, especially, easier to remember as a guide for most of cases.

It mentions the following steps:

* &quot;Check&quot; the scene for safety of the rescuer and others, and check the patient&#x27;s condition.
* &quot;Call&quot; to emergency medical services.
* &quot;Care&quot; the patient.

==== SAFE-POINT protocol ====
Another European protocol, which appeared in the field of construction of Czech Republic to react to any emergence .

Their steps (which have not any mnemonic) are:

* &quot;Safety of the rescuers.&quot;
* &quot;Calling&quot; to emergency telephone number.
* &quot;Bleeding&quot;: treating the massive bleedings.
* &quot;Freeing the airways&quot;.
* &quot;Resuscitation&quot;: applying cardiopulmonary resuscitation.
* &quot;Keeping warm&quot; to the patient.

== Key basic skills ==
Certain skills are considered essential to the provision of first aid and are taught ubiquitously.

=== Displacement skills ===
If there are dangers around (such as fire, electric dangers or others) the patient has to be moved to a safe place, (if it is safe for the first aid provider to do so), where providing the required first aid procedures is possible.

—In case of a possible severe spinal injury: when a patient seems to have a possible serious injury in the spinal cord (in the backbone, either at the neck part or the back part), that patient must not be moved except if that is necessary, and, when necessary, it must be done as little as possible and very carefully (see mentions about this type of injury in the gallery of drawings below). These precautions avoid many risks of causing further damages for the patient&#x27;s mobility in the future.

Usually, the patient needs to end up lying down, in a face-up position, on a sufficiently firm surface (for example, on the floor, which allows to perform the chest compressions of cardiopulmonary resuscitation).
=== Checking skills ===
They evaluate the condition of the victim, first attending to the main threats for life.

The preferred initial way of checking consist of asking, commonly by touching the patient in one of his shoulders and shouting something, such as: &quot;can you hear me?&quot;

In some cases, the victim has a wound that bleeds abundantly, which requires its own additional treatment to stop the blood loss (usually, it would begin by keeping the wound pressed).

If the patient does not react, the heartbeats can be checked in the carotid pulse: placing two fingers on any side of the neck (on the left or the right side), near his head. In cases where checking the carotid pulse is impossible, heartbeats can be perceived in the radial pulse: placing two fingers on a wrist, under the part of the thumb, and applying moderate pressure. Breathing can also be checked additionally, placing an ear on the mouth and, at the same time, watching the chest rising by the effect of the air. It is recommended not to waste too much time of first aid in checking (professional rescuers are taught to take 10 seconds in it).

=== Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) ===

Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is the method of first aid for treating victims of cardiac arrest (complete stop of heartbeat).

=== Airway, Breathing, and Circulation skills ===

ABC method stands for &quot;Airway&quot;, &quot;Breathing&quot;, and &quot;Circulation&quot;. The same mnemonic is used by emergency health professionals.

It is focused on critical life-saving intervention, and it must be rendered before treatment of less serious injuries.

Attention must first be brought to the airway to ensure it is clear. An obstruction (choking) is a life-threatening emergency. If an object blocks the airway, it requires anti-choking procedures. Following any evaluation of the airway, a first aid attendant would determine adequacy of breathing and provide rescue breathing if safe to do so.

Assessment of circulation is now not usually carried out for patients who are not breathing, with first aiders now trained to go straight to chest compressions (and thus providing artificial circulation) but pulse checks may be done on less serious patients.

Some organizations add a fourth step of &quot;D&quot; for &quot;Deadly bleeding&quot; or &quot;Defibrillation&quot;, while others consider this as part of the &quot;Circulation&quot; step simply referred as Disability. Variations on techniques to evaluate and maintain the ABCs depend on the skill level of the first aider. Once the ABCs are secured, first aiders can begin additional treatments or examination, as required if they possess the proper training (such as measuring pupil dilation).

Some organizations teach the same order of priority using the &quot;3Bs&quot;: &quot;Breathing&quot;, &quot;Bleeding&quot;, and &quot;Bones&quot; (or &quot;4Bs&quot;: &quot;Breathing&quot;, &quot;Bleeding&quot;, &quot;Burns&quot;, and &quot;Bones&quot;). While the ABCs and 3Bs are taught to be performed sequentially, certain conditions may require the consideration of two steps simultaneously. This includes the provision of both artificial respiration and chest compressions to someone who is not breathing and has no pulse, and the consideration of cervical spine injuries when ensuring an open airway.

==== Preserving life ====
The patient must have an open airway—that is, an unobstructed passage that allows air to travel from the open mouth or uncongested nose, down through the pharynx and into the lungs. Conscious people maintain their own airway automatically, but those who are unconscious (with a GCS of less than 8) may be unable to do so, as the part of the brain that manages spontaneous breathing may not be functioning.

Whether conscious or not, the patient may be placed in the recovery position, laying on their side. In addition to relaxing the patient, this can have the effect of clearing the tongue from the pharynx. It also avoids a common cause of death in unconscious patients, which is choking on regurgitated stomach contents.

The airway can also become blocked by a foreign object. To dislodge the object and solve the choking case, the first aider may use anti-choking methods (such as &#x27;back slaps, &#x27;chest thrusts&#x27; or &#x27;abdominal thrusts&#x27;).

Once the airway has been opened, the first aider would reassess the patient&#x27;s breathing. If there is no breathing, or the patient is not breathing normally (e.g., agonal breathing), the first aider would initiate CPR, which attempts to restart the patient&#x27;s breathing by forcing air into the lungs. They may also manually massage the heart to promote blood flow around the body.

If the choking person is an infant, the first aider may use anti-choking methods for babies. During that procedure, series of five strong blows are delivered on the infant&#x27;s upper back after placing the infant&#x27;s face in the aider&#x27;s forearm. If the infant is able to cough or cry, no breathing assistance should be given. Chest thrusts can also be applied with two fingers on the lower half of the middle of the chest. Coughing and crying indicate the airway is open and the foreign object will likely to come out from the force the coughing or crying produces.

A first responder should know how to use an Automatic External Defibrillator (AED) in the case of a person having a sudden cardiac arrest. The survival rate of those who have a cardiac arrest outside of the hospital is low. Permanent brain damage sets in after five minutes of no oxygen delivery, so rapid action on the part of the rescuer is necessary. An AED is a device that can examine a heartbeat and produce electric shocks to restart the heart.

A first aider should be prepared to quickly deal with less severe problems such as cuts, grazes or bone fracture. They may be able to completely resolve a situation if they have the proper training and equipment. For situations that are more severe, complex or dangerous, a first aider might need to do the best they can with the equipment they have, and wait for an ambulance to arrive at the scene.

== First aid kits ==

A first aid kit consists of a strong, durable bag or transparent plastic box. They are commonly identified with a white cross on a green background. A first aid kit does not have to be bought ready-made. The advantage of ready-made first aid kits are that they have well organized compartments and familiar layouts.

===Contents===
There is no universal agreement upon the list for the contents of a first aid kit. The UK Health and Safety Executive stress that the contents of workplace first aid kits will vary according to the nature of the work activities. As an example of possible contents of a kit, British Standard BS 8599 &quot;First Aid Kits for the Workplace&quot; lists the following items:
*Information leaflet
*Medium sterile dressings
*Large sterile dressings
*Bandages
*Triangular dressings
*Safety pins
*Adhesive dressings
*Sterile wet wipes
*Microporous tape
*Nitrile gloves
*Face shield
*Foil blanket
*Burn dressings
*Clothing shears
*Conforming bandages
*Finger dressing
*Antiseptic cream
*Scissors
*Tweezers
*Cotton
== Training principles ==
Basic principles, such as knowing the use of adhesive bandage or applying direct pressure on a bleed, are often acquired passively through life experiences. However, to provide effective, life-saving first aid interventions requires instruction and practical training. This is especially true where it relates to potentially fatal illnesses and injuries, such as those that require CPR; these procedures may be invasive, and carry a risk of further injury to the patient and the provider. As with any training, it is more useful if it occurs &quot;before&quot; an actual emergency. And, in many countries, calling emergency medical services allows listening basic first aid instructions over the phone while the ambulance is on the way.

Training is generally provided by attending a course, typically leading to certification. Due to regular changes in procedures and protocols, based on updated clinical knowledge, and to maintain skill, attendance at regular refresher courses or re-certification is often necessary. First aid training is often available through community organizations such as the Red Cross and St. John Ambulance, or through commercial providers, who will train people for a fee. This commercial training is most common for training of employees to perform first aid in their workplace. Many community organizations also provide a commercial service, which complements their community programmes.

=== Types of first aid which require training ===
There are several types of first aid (and first aider) that require specific additional training. These are usually undertaken to fulfill the demands of the work or activity undertaken.
* Aquatic/Marine first aid is usually practiced by professionals such as lifeguards, professional mariners or in diver rescue, and covers the specific problems which may be faced after water-based rescue or delayed MedEvac.
* Battlefield first aid takes into account the specific needs of treating wounded combatants and non-combatants during armed conflict.
* Conflict First Aid focuses on support for stability and recovery of personal, social, group or system well-being and to address circumstantial safety needs.
* Hyperbaric first aid may be practiced by underwater diving professionals, who need to treat conditions such as decompression sickness.
*Oxygen first aid is the providing of oxygen to casualties with conditions resulting in hypoxia. It is also a standard first aid procedure for underwater diving incidents where gas bubble formation in the tissues is possible.
*Wilderness first aid is the provision of first aid under conditions where the arrival of emergency responders or the evacuation of an injured person may be delayed due to constraints of terrain, weather, and available persons or equipment. It may be necessary to care for an injured person for several hours or days.
*Mental health first aid is taught independently of physical first aid. How to support someone experiencing a mental health problem or in a crisis situation. Also how to identify the first signs of someone developing mental ill health and guide people towards appropriate help.
== First aid services ==
Some people undertake specific training in order to provide first aid at public or private events, during filming, or other places where people gather. They may be designated as a &quot;first aider&quot;, or use some other title. This role may be undertaken on a voluntary basis, with organisations such as the Red Cross society and St. John Ambulance, or as paid employment with a medical contractor.

People performing a first aid role, whether in a professional or voluntary capacity, are often expected to have a high level of first aid training and are often uniformed.

==Symbols==

Although commonly associated with first aid, the symbol of a red cross is an official protective symbol of the Red Cross. According to the Geneva Conventions and other international laws, the use of this and similar symbols is reserved for official agencies of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent, and as a protective emblem for medical personnel and facilities in combat situations. Use by any other person or organization is illegal, and may lead to prosecution.

The internationally accepted symbol for first aid is the white cross on a green background shown below.

Some organizations may make use of the Star of Life, although this is usually reserved for use by ambulance services, or may use symbols such as the Maltese Cross, like the Order of Malta Ambulance Corps and St John Ambulance. Other symbols may also be used.

<text>Feudalism, also known as the feudal system, was a combination of legal, economic, military, cultural, and political customs that flourished in medieval Europe from the 9th to 15th centuries. Broadly defined, it was a way of structuring society around relationships derived from the holding of land in exchange for service or labour. 

The classic definition, by François Louis Ganshof (1944), describes a set of reciprocal legal and military obligations of the warrior nobility and revolved around the key concepts of lords, vassals, and fiefs. A broader definition, as described by Marc Bloch (1939), includes not only the obligations of the warrior nobility but the obligations of all three estates of the realm: the nobility, the clergy, and the peasantry, all of whom were bound by a system of manorialism; this is sometimes referred to as a &quot;feudal society&quot;. 

Although it is derived from the Latin word &quot;feodum&quot; or &quot;feudum&quot; (fief), which was used during the medieval period, the term &quot;feudalism&quot; and the system it describes were not conceived of as a formal political system by the people who lived during the Middle Ages. Since the publication of Elizabeth A. R. Brown&#x27;s &quot;The Tyranny of a Construct&quot; (1974) and Susan Reynolds&#x27;s &quot;Fiefs and Vassals&quot; (1994), there has been ongoing inconclusive discussion among medieval historians as to whether feudalism is a useful construct for understanding medieval society.

== Definition ==
The adjective &quot;feudal&quot; was in use by at least 1405, and the noun &quot;feudalism&quot; was in use by the end of the 18th century, paralleling the French .

According to a classic definition by Ganshof, &quot;feudalism&quot; describes a set of reciprocal legal and military obligations of the warrior nobility that revolved around the key concepts of lords, vassals and fiefs, though Ganshof himself noted that his treatment was only related to the &quot;narrow, technical, legal sense of the word.&quot;

A broader definition, as described in Bloch&#x27;s 1939 &quot;Feudal Society&quot;, includes not only the obligations of the warrior nobility but the obligations of all three estates of the realm: the nobility, the clergy, and those who lived off their labour, most directly the peasantry, which was bound by a system of manorialism. This order is often referred to as a &quot;feudal society&quot;, echoing Bloch&#x27;s usage.

Outside its European context, the concept of feudalism can be extended to analogous social structures in other regions, most often in discussions of feudal Japan under the &quot;shoguns&quot;, and sometimes in discussions of the Zagwe dynasty in medieval Ethiopia, which had some feudal characteristics (sometimes called &quot;semifeudal&quot;). Some have taken the feudalism analogy further, seeing feudalism (or traces of it) in places as diverse as Spring and Autumn period China, ancient Egypt, the Parthian Empire, India until the Mughal dynasty and the Antebellum South and Jim Crow laws in the American South.

The term &quot;feudalism&quot; has also been applied—often pejoratively—to non-Western societies where institutions and attitudes similar to those in medieval Europe are perceived to prevail. Some historians and political theorists believe that the term &quot;feudalism&quot; has been deprived of specific meaning by the many ways it has been used, leading them to reject it as a useful concept for understanding society.

The applicability of the term feudalism has also been questioned in the context of some Central and Eastern European countries, such as Poland and Lithuania, with scholars observing that the medieval political and economic structure of those countries bears some, but not all, resemblances to the Western European societies commonly described as feudal.

== Etymology ==

The word &quot;feudal&quot; comes from the medieval Latin &quot;feudālis&quot;, the adjectival form of &quot;feudum&quot; &#x27;fee, feud&#x27;, first attested in a charter of Charles the Fat in 884, which is related to Old French &quot;fé, fié,&quot; Provençal &quot;feo, feu, fieu,&quot; and Italian &quot;fio&quot;. The ultimate origin of &quot;feudālis&quot; is unclear. It may come from a Germanic word, perhaps &quot;fehu&quot; or &quot;*fehôd&quot;, but these words are not attested in this meaning in Germanic sources, or even in the Latin of the Frankish laws.

One theory about the origin of &quot;fehu&quot; was proposed by Johan Hendrik Caspar Kern in 1870, being supported by, amongst others, William Stubbs and Marc Bloch. Kern derived the word from a putative Frankish term &quot;*fehu-ôd&quot;, in which &quot;*fehu&quot; means &#x27;cattle&#x27; and &quot;-ôd&quot; means &#x27;goods&#x27;, implying &quot;a movable object of value&quot;. Bloch explains that by the beginning of the 10th century it was common to value land in monetary terms but to pay for it with objects of equivalent value, such as arms, clothing, horses or food. This was known as &quot;feos&quot;, a term that took on the general meaning of paying for something in lieu of money. This meaning was then applied to land itself, in which land was used to pay for fealty, such as to a vassal. Thus the old word &quot;feos&quot; meaning &#x27;movable property&#x27; would have changed to &quot;feus&quot;, meaning the exact opposite: &#x27;landed property&#x27;.

Archibald Ross Lewis proposes that the origin of &quot;fief&quot; is not &quot;feudum&quot; (or &quot;feodum&quot;), but rather &quot;foderum&quot;, the earliest attested use being in &quot;Vita Hludovici&quot; (840) by Astronomus. In that text is a passage about Louis the Pious that says , which can be translated as &quot;Louis forbade that military (which they popularly call &quot;fodder&quot;) be furnished.&quot;

Initially in medieval Latin European documents, a land grant in exchange for service was called a (Latin). Later, the term , or , began to replace in the documents. The first attested instance of this is from 984, although more primitive forms were seen up to one-hundred years earlier. The origin of the and why it replaced has not been well established, but there are multiple theories, described below.

The term &quot;féodal&quot; was first used in 17th-century French legal treatises (1614) and translated into English legal treatises as an adjective, such as &quot;feodal government&quot;.

In the 18th century, Adam Smith, seeking to describe economic systems, effectively coined the forms &quot;feudal government&quot; and &quot;feudal system&quot; in his book &quot;The Wealth of Nations&quot; (1776). The phrase &quot;feudal system&quot; appeared in 1736, in &quot;Baronia Anglica&quot;, published nine years after the death of its author Thomas Madox, in 1727. In 1771, in his book &quot;The History of Manchester&quot;, John Whitaker first introduced the word &quot;feudalism&quot; and the notion of the feudal pyramid.

Another theory by Alauddin Samarrai suggests an Arabic origin, from &quot;fuyū&quot; (the plural of &quot;fay&quot;, which literally means &#x27;the returned&#x27;, and was used especially for &#x27;land that has been conquered from enemies that did not fight&#x27;). Samarrai&#x27;s theory is that early forms of &#x27;fief&#x27; include &quot;feo&quot;, &quot;feu&quot;, &quot;feuz&quot;, &quot;feuum&quot; and others, the plurality of forms strongly suggesting origins from a loanword. The first use of these terms is in Languedoc, one of the least Germanic areas of Europe and bordering Al-Andalus (Muslim Spain). Further, the earliest use of &quot;feuum&quot; (as a replacement for &quot;beneficium&quot;) can be dated to 899, the same year a Muslim base at Fraxinetum (La Garde-Freinet) in Provence was established. It is possible, Samarrai says, that French scribes, writing in Latin, attempted to transliterate the Arabic word &quot;fuyū&quot; (the plural of &quot;fay&quot;), which was used by the Muslim invaders and occupiers at the time, resulting in a plurality of forms – &quot;feo, feu, feuz, feuum&quot; and others—from which eventually &quot;feudum&quot; derived. Samarrai, however, also advises to handle this theory with care, as Medieval and Early Modern Muslim scribes often used etymologically &quot;fanciful roots&quot; to support outlandish claims that something was of Arabian or Muslim origin.

== History ==
Feudalism, in its various forms, usually emerged as a result of the decentralization of an empire: such as in the Carolingian Empire in the 9th century AD, which lacked the bureaucratic infrastructure[] necessary to support cavalry without allocating land to these mounted troops. Mounted soldiers began to secure a system of hereditary rule over their allocated land and their power over the territory came to encompass the social, political, judicial, and economic spheres.

These acquired powers significantly diminished unitary power in these empires. However, once the infrastructure to maintain unitary power was re-established—as with the European monarchies—feudalism began to yield to this new power structure and eventually disappeared.

=== Classic feudalism ===

The classic François Louis Ganshof version of feudalism describes a set of reciprocal legal and military obligations of the warrior nobility based on the key concepts of lords, vassals, and fiefs. In broad terms a lord was a noble who held land, a vassal was a person granted possession of the land by the lord, and the land was known as a fief. In exchange for the use of the fief and protection by the lord, the vassal provided some sort of service to the lord. There were many varieties of feudal land tenure, consisting of military and non-military service. The obligations and corresponding rights between lord and vassal concerning the fief form the basis of the feudal relationship.

=== Vassalage ===

Before a lord could grant land (a fief) to someone, he had to make that person a vassal. This was done at a formal and symbolic ceremony called a commendation ceremony, which was composed of the two-part act of homage and oath of fealty. During homage, the lord and vassal entered into a contract in which the vassal promised to fight for the lord at his command, whilst the lord agreed to protect the vassal from external forces. &quot;Fealty&quot; comes from the Latin &quot;fidelitas&quot; and denotes the fidelity owed by a vassal to his feudal lord. &quot;Fealty&quot; also refers to an oath that more explicitly reinforces the commitments of the vassal made during homage; such an oath follows homage.

Once the commendation ceremony was complete, the lord and vassal were in a feudal relationship with agreed obligations to one another. The vassal&#x27;s principal obligation to the lord was to provide aid or military service. Using whatever equipment the vassal could obtain by virtue of the revenues from the fief, the vassal had to answer calls to military service by the lord. This security of military help was the primary reason the lord entered into the feudal relationship. In addition, the vassal could have other obligations to his lord, such as attendance at his court, whether manorial, baronial, both termed court baron, or at the king&#x27;s court.
It could also involve the vassal providing &quot;counsel&quot;, so that if the lord faced a major decision he would summon all his vassals and hold a council. At the level of the manor this might be a fairly mundane matter of agricultural policy, but also included sentencing by the lord for criminal offences, including capital punishment in some cases. Concerning the king&#x27;s feudal court, such deliberation could include the question of declaring war. These are examples of feudalism; depending on the period of time and location in Europe, feudal customs and practices varied.

=== The feudal revolution in France ===
In its origin, the feudal grant of land had been seen in terms of a personal bond between lord and vassal, but with time and the transformation of fiefs into hereditary holdings, the nature of the system came to be seen as a form of &quot;politics of land&quot; (an expression used by the historian Marc Bloch). The 11th century in France saw what has been called by historians a &quot;feudal revolution&quot; or &quot;mutation&quot; and a &quot;fragmentation of powers&quot; (Bloch) that was unlike the development of feudalism in England or Italy or in Germany in the same period or later: Counties and duchies began to break down into smaller holdings as castellans and lesser &quot;seigneurs&quot; took control of local lands, and (as comital families had done before them) lesser lords usurped/privatized a wide range of prerogatives and rights of the state, including travel dues, market dues, fees for using woodlands, obligations, use the lord&#x27;s mill and, most importantly, the highly profitable rights of justice, etc. (what Georges Duby called collectively the &quot;seigneurie banale&quot;). Power in this period became more personal.

This &quot;fragmentation of powers&quot; was not, however, systematic throughout France, and in certain counties (such as Flanders, Normandy, Anjou, Toulouse), counts were able to maintain control of their lands into the 12th century or later. Thus, in some regions (like Normandy and Flanders), the vassal/feudal system was an effective tool for ducal and comital control, linking vassals to their lords; but in other regions, the system led to significant confusion, all the more so as vassals could and frequently did pledge themselves to two or more lords. In response to this, the idea of a &quot;liege lord&quot; was developed (where the obligations to one lord are regarded as superior) in the 12th century.

===End of European feudalism (1500–1850s)===
Around this time, rich, &quot;middle-class&quot; commoners chafed at the authority and powers held by feudal lords, overlords, and nobles, and preferred the idea of autocratic rule where a king and one royal court held almost all the power. Feudal nobles regardless of ethnicity generally thought of themselves as arbiters of a politically free system, so this often puzzled them before the fall of most feudal laws.

Most of the military aspects of feudalism effectively ended by about 1500. This was partly since the military shifted from armies consisting of the nobility to professional fighters thus reducing the nobility&#x27;s claim on power, but also because the Black Death reduced the nobility&#x27;s hold over the lower classes. Vestiges of the feudal system hung on in France until the French Revolution of the 1790s. Even when the original feudal relationships had disappeared, there were many institutional remnants of feudalism left in place. Historian Georges Lefebvre explains how at an early stage of the French Revolution, on just one night of 4 August 1789, France abolished the long-lasting remnants of the feudal order. It announced, &quot;The National Assembly abolishes the feudal system entirely.&quot; Lefebvre explains:

Originally the peasants were supposed to pay for the release of seigneurial dues; these dues affected more than a quarter of the farmland in France and provided most of the income of the large landowners. The majority refused to pay and in 1793 the obligation was cancelled. Thus the peasants got their land free, and also no longer paid the tithe to the church.

In the Kingdom of France, following the French Revolution, feudalism was abolished with a decree of 11 August 1789 by the Constituent Assembly, a provision that was later extended to various parts of Italian kingdom following the invasion by French troops. In the Kingdom of Naples, Joachim Murat abolished feudalism with the law of 2 August 1806, then implemented with a law of 1 September 1806 and a royal decree of 3 December 1808. In the Kingdom of Sicily the abolishing law was issued by the Sicilian Parliament on 10 August 1812. In Piedmont feudalism ceased by virtue of the edicts of 7 March, and 19 July 1797 issued by Charles Emmanuel IV, although in the Kingdom of Sardinia, specifically on the island of Sardinia, feudalism was abolished only with an edict of 5 August 1848.

In the Kingdom of Lombardy–Venetia, feudalism was abolished with the law of 5 December 1861 n.º 342 were all feudal bonds abolished. The system lingered on in parts of Central and Eastern Europe as late as the 1850s. Slavery in Romania was abolished in 1856. Russia finally abolished serfdom in 1861.

More recently in Scotland, on 28 November 2004, the Abolition of Feudal Tenure etc. (Scotland) Act 2000 entered into full force putting an end to what was left of the Scottish feudal system. The last feudal regime, that of the island of Sark, was abolished in December 2008, when the first democratic elections were held for the election of a local parliament and the appointment of a government. The &quot;revolution&quot; is a consequence of the juridical intervention of the European Parliament, which declared the local constitutional system as contrary to human rights, and, following a series of legal battles, imposed parliamentary democracy.

== Feudal society ==
The phrase &quot;feudal society&quot; as defined by Marc Bloch offers a wider definition than Ganshof&#x27;s and includes within the feudal structure not only the warrior aristocracy bound by vassalage, but also the peasantry bound by manorialism, and the estates of the Church. Thus the feudal order embraces society from top to bottom, though the &quot;powerful and well-differentiated social group of the urban classes&quot; came to occupy a distinct position to some extent outside the classic feudal hierarchy.

== Historiography ==
The idea of &quot;feudalism&quot; was unknown and the system it describes was not conceived of as a formal political system by the people living in the medieval period. This section describes the history of the idea of feudalism, how the concept originated among scholars and thinkers, how it changed over time, and modern debates about its use.

=== Evolution of the concept ===

The concept of a feudal state or period, in the sense of either a regime or a period dominated by lords who possess financial or social power and prestige, became widely held in the middle of the 18th century, as a result of works such as Montesquieu&#x27;s (1748; published in English as &quot;The Spirit of Law&quot;), and Henri de Boulainvilliers&#x27;s (1737; published in English as &quot;An Historical Account of the Ancient Parliaments of France or States-General of the Kingdom&quot;, 1739). In the 18th century, writers of the Enlightenment wrote about feudalism to denigrate the antiquated system of the , or French monarchy. This was the Age of Enlightenment, when writers valued reason and the Middle Ages were viewed as the &quot;Dark Ages&quot;. Enlightenment authors generally mocked and ridiculed anything from the &quot;Dark Ages&quot; including feudalism, projecting its negative characteristics on the current French monarchy as a means of political gain. For them &quot;feudalism&quot; meant seigneurial privileges and prerogatives. When the French Constituent Assembly abolished the &quot;feudal regime&quot; in August 1789, this is what was meant. 

Adam Smith used the term &quot;feudal system&quot; to describe a social and economic system defined by inherited social ranks, each of which possessed inherent social and economic privileges and obligations. In such a system, wealth derived from agriculture, which was arranged not according to market forces but on the basis of customary labour services owed by serfs to landowning nobles.

=== Heinrich Brunner ===

Heinrich Brunner, in his &quot;The Equestrian Service and the Beginnings of the Feudal System&quot; (1887), maintained that Charles Martel laid the foundation for feudalism during the 8th century. Brunner believed Martel to be a brilliant warrior who secularized church lands for the purpose of providing &quot;precarias&quot; (or leases) for his followers, in return for their military service. Martel&#x27;s military ambitions were becoming more expensive as it changed into a cavalry force, thus the need to maintain his followers through the despoiling of church lands. 

Responding to Brunner&#x27;s thesis, Paul Fouracre theorizes that the church itself held power over the land with its own &quot;precarias&quot;. The most commonly utilized &quot;precarias&quot; was the gifting of land to the church, done for various spiritual and legal purposes. Although Charles Martel did indeed utilize &quot;precaria&quot; for his own purposes, and even drove some of the bishops out of the church and placed his own laymen in their seats, Fouracre discounts Martel&#x27;s role in creating political change, that it was simply a military move in order to have control in the region by hording land through tenancies, and expelling the bishops who he did not agree with, but it did not specifically create feudalism.  

=== Karl Marx ===
Karl Marx also uses the term in the 19th century in his analysis of society&#x27;s economic and political development, describing feudalism (or more usually feudal society or the feudal mode of production) as the order coming before capitalism. For Marx, what defined feudalism was the power of the ruling class (the aristocracy) in their control of arable land, leading to a class society based upon the exploitation of the peasants who farm these lands, typically under serfdom and principally by means of labour, produce and money rents. He deemed feudalism a &#x27;democracy of unfreedom&#x27;, juxtaposing the oppression of feudal subjects with a holistic integration of political and economic life of the sort lacking under industrial capitalism.

He also took it as a paradigm for understanding the power-relationships between capitalists and wage-labourers in his own time: &quot;in pre-capitalist systems it was obvious that most people did not control their own destiny—under feudalism, for instance, serfs had to work for their lords. Capitalism seems different because people are in theory free to work for themselves or for others as they choose. Yet most workers have as little control over their lives as feudal serfs.&quot; Some later Marxist theorists (e.g. Eric Wolf) have applied this label to include non-European societies, grouping feudalism together with imperial China and the Inca Empire, in the pre-Columbian era, as &#x27;tributary&#x27; societies .

=== Later studies ===
In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, J. Horace Round and Frederic William Maitland, both historians of medieval Britain, arrived at different conclusions about the character of Anglo-Saxon English society before the Norman Conquest in 1066. Round argued that the Normans had brought feudalism with them to England, while Maitland contended that its fundamentals were already in place in Britain before 1066. The debate continues today, but a consensus viewpoint is that England before the Conquest had commendation (which embodied some of the personal elements in feudalism) while William the Conqueror introduced a modified and stricter northern French feudalism to England incorporating (1086) oaths of loyalty to the king by all who held by feudal tenure, even the vassals of his principal vassals (holding by feudal tenure meant that vassals must provide the quota of knights required by the king or a money payment in substitution).

In the 20th century, two outstanding historians offered still more widely differing perspectives. The French historian Marc Bloch, arguably the most influential 20th-century medieval historian, approached feudalism not so much from a legal and military point of view but from a sociological one, presenting in &quot;Feudal Society&quot; (1939; English 1961) a feudal order not limited solely to the nobility. It is his radical notion that peasants were part of the feudal relationship that sets Bloch apart from his peers: while the vassal performed military service in exchange for the fief, the peasant performed physical labour in return for protection – both are a form of feudal relationship. According to Bloch, other elements of society can be seen in feudal terms; all the aspects of life were centred on &quot;lordship&quot;, and so we can speak usefully of a feudal church structure, a feudal courtly (and anti-courtly) literature, and a feudal economy.

In contradistinction to Bloch, the Belgian historian François Louis Ganshof defined feudalism from a narrow legal and military perspective, arguing that feudal relationships existed only within the medieval nobility itself. Ganshof articulated this concept in &quot;Qu&#x27;est-ce que la féodalité?&quot; (&quot;What is feudalism?&quot;, 1944; translated in English as &quot;Feudalism&quot;). His classic definition of feudalism is widely accepted today among medieval scholars, though questioned both by those who view the concept in wider terms and by those who find insufficient uniformity in noble exchanges to support such a model.

Although Georges Duby was never formally a student in the circle of scholars around Marc Bloch and Lucien Febvre, that came to be known as the Annales school, Duby was an exponent of the tradition. In a published version of his 1952 doctoral thesis entitled (&quot;Society in the 11th and 12th centuries in the Mâconnais region&quot;), and working from the extensive documentary sources surviving from the Burgundian monastery of Cluny, as well as the dioceses of Mâcon and Dijon, Duby excavated the complex social and economic relationships among the individuals and institutions of the Mâconnais region and charted a profound shift in the social structures of medieval society around the year 1000. He argued that in early 11th century, governing institutions—particularly comital courts established under the Carolingian monarchy—that had represented public justice and order in Burgundy during the 9th and 10th centuries receded and gave way to a new feudal order wherein independent aristocratic knights wielded power over peasant communities through strong-arm tactics and threats of violence.

In 1939, the Austrian historian Theodor Mayer subordinated the feudal state as secondary to his concept of a &quot;Personenverbandsstaat&quot; (personal interdependency state), understanding it in contrast to the territorial state. This form of statehood, identified with the Holy Roman Empire, is described as the most complete form of medieval rule, completing conventional feudal structure of lordship and vassalage with the personal association among the nobility. But the applicability of this concept to cases outside of the Holy Roman Empire has been questioned, as by Susan Reynolds. The concept has also been questioned and superseded in German historiography because of its bias and reductionism towards legitimating the .

=== Challenges to the feudal model ===
In 1974, the American historian Elizabeth A. R. Brown rejected the label &quot;feudalism&quot; as an anachronism that imparts a false sense of uniformity to the concept. Having noted the current use of many, often contradictory, definitions of &quot;feudalism&quot;, she argued that the word is only a construct with no basis in medieval reality, an invention of modern historians read back &quot;tyrannically&quot; into the historical record. Supporters of Brown have suggested that the term should be expunged from history textbooks and lectures on medieval history entirely. In &quot;Fiefs and Vassals: The Medieval Evidence Reinterpreted&quot; (1994), Susan Reynolds expanded upon Brown&#x27;s original thesis. Although some contemporaries questioned Reynolds&#x27;s methodology, other historians have supported it and her argument. Reynolds argues:
The term &quot;feudal&quot; has also been applied to non-Western societies, in which institutions and attitudes similar to those of medieval Europe are perceived to have prevailed (see Examples of feudalism). Japan has been extensively studied in this regard. Karl Friday notes that in the 21st century historians of Japan rarely invoke feudalism; instead of looking at similarities, specialists attempting comparative analysis concentrate on fundamental differences. Ultimately, critics say, the many ways the term &quot;feudalism&quot; has been used have deprived it of specific meaning, leading some historians and political theorists to reject it as a useful concept for understanding society.

Historian Richard Abels notes that &quot;Western civilization and world civilization textbooks now shy away from the term &#x27;feudalism&#x27;.&quot;

<text>Foxes are small-to-medium-sized omnivorous mammals belonging to several genera of the family Canidae. They have a flattened skull; upright, triangular ears; a pointed, slightly upturned snout; and a long, bushy tail (&quot;brush&quot;).

Twelve species belong to the monophyletic &quot;true fox&quot; group of genus &quot;Vulpes&quot;. Another 25 current or extinct species are sometimes called foxes – they are part of the paraphyletic group of the South American foxes or an outlying group, which consists of the bat-eared fox, gray fox, and island fox.

Foxes live on every continent except Antarctica. The most common and widespread species of fox is the red fox (&quot;Vulpes vulpes&quot;) with about 47 recognized subspecies. The global distribution of foxes, together with their widespread reputation for cunning, has contributed to their prominence in popular culture and folklore in many societies around the world. The hunting of foxes with packs of hounds, long an established pursuit in Europe, especially in the British Isles, was exported by European settlers to various parts of the New World.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;fox&quot; comes from Old English and derives from Proto-Germanic *&quot;fuhsaz&quot;. This in turn derives from Proto-Indo-European *&quot;puḱ-&quot; &quot;thick-haired, tail.&quot; Male foxes are known as &quot;dogs&quot;, &quot;tods&quot;, or &quot;reynards&quot;; females as &quot;vixens&quot;; and young as &quot;cubs&quot;, &quot;pups&quot;, or &quot;kits&quot;, though the last term is not to be confused with the kit fox, a distinct species. &quot;Vixen&quot; is one of very few modern English words that retain the Middle English southern dialectal &quot;v&quot; pronunciation instead of &quot;f&quot;; i.e., northern English &quot;fox&quot; versus southern English &quot;vox&quot;. A group of foxes is referred to as a &quot;skulk&quot;, &quot;leash&quot;, or &quot;earth&quot;.

==Phylogenetic relationships==

Within the Canidae, the results of DNA analysis shows several phylogenetic divisions:
* The fox-like canids, which include the kit fox (&quot;Vulpes velox&quot;), red fox (&quot;Vulpes vulpes&quot;), Cape fox (&quot;Vulpes chama&quot;), Arctic fox (&quot;Vulpes lagopus&quot;), and fennec fox (&quot;Vulpes zerda&quot;).
* The wolf-like canids, (genus &quot;Canis&quot;, &quot;Cuon&quot; and &quot;Lycaon&quot;) including the dog &quot;(Canis lupus familiaris)&quot;, gray wolf (&quot;Canis lupus&quot;), red wolf (&quot;Canis rufus&quot;), eastern wolf (&quot;Canis lycaon&quot;), coyote (&quot;Canis latrans&quot;), golden jackal (&quot;Canis aureus&quot;), Ethiopian wolf (&quot;Canis simensis&quot;), black-backed jackal (&quot;Canis mesomelas&quot;), side-striped jackal (&quot;Canis adustus&quot;), dhole (&quot;Cuon alpinus&quot;), and African wild dog (&quot;Lycaon pictus&quot;).
* The South American canids, including the bush dog (&quot;Speothos venaticus&quot;), hoary fox (&quot;Lycalopex uetulus&quot;), crab-eating fox (&quot;Cerdocyon thous&quot;) and maned wolf (&quot;Chrysocyon brachyurus&quot;).
* Various monotypic taxa, including the bat-eared fox (&quot;Otocyon megalotis&quot;), gray fox (&quot;Urocyon cinereoargenteus&quot;), and raccoon dog (&quot;Nyctereutes procyonoides&quot;).

==Biology==
===General morphology===
Foxes are generally smaller than some other members of the family Canidae such as wolves and jackals, while they may be larger than some within the family, such as raccoon dogs. In the largest species, the red fox, males weigh between , while the smallest species, the fennec fox, weighs just .

Fox features typically include a triangular face, pointed ears, an elongated rostrum, and a bushy tail. They are digitigrade (meaning they walk on their toes). Unlike most members of the family Canidae, foxes have partially retractable claws. Fox vibrissae, or whiskers, are black. The whiskers on the muzzle, known as mystacial vibrissae, average long, while the whiskers everywhere else on the head average to be shorter in length. Whiskers (carpal vibrissae) are also on the forelimbs and average long, pointing downward and backward. Other physical characteristics vary according to habitat and adaptive significance.

===Pelage===
Fox species differ in fur color, length, and density. Coat colors range from pearly white to black-and-white to black flecked with white or grey on the underside. Fennec foxes (and other species of fox adapted to life in the desert, such as kit foxes), for example, have large ears and short fur to aid in keeping the body cool. Arctic foxes, on the other hand, have tiny ears and short limbs as well as thick, insulating fur, which aid in keeping the body warm. Red foxes, by contrast, have a typical auburn pelt, the tail normally ending with a white marking.

A fox&#x27;s coat color and texture may vary due to the change in seasons; fox pelts are richer and denser in the colder months and lighter in the warmer months. To get rid of the dense winter coat, foxes moult once a year around April; the process begins from the feet, up the legs, and then along the back. Coat color may also change as the individual ages.

===Dentition===
A fox&#x27;s dentition, like all other canids, is I 3/3, C 1/1, PM 4/4, M 3/2 = 42. (Bat-eared foxes have six extra molars, totalling in 48 teeth.) Foxes have pronounced carnassial pairs, which is characteristic of a carnivore. These pairs consist of the upper premolar and the lower first molar, and work together to shear tough material like flesh. Foxes&#x27; canines are pronounced, also characteristic of a carnivore, and are excellent in gripping prey.

===Behaviour===
In the wild, the typical lifespan of a fox is one to three years, although individuals may live up to ten years. Unlike many canids, foxes are not always pack animals. Typically, they live in small family groups, but some (such as Arctic foxes) are known to be solitary.

Foxes are omnivores. Their diet is made up primarily of invertebrates such as insects and small vertebrates such as reptiles and birds. They may also eat eggs and vegetation. Many species are generalist predators, but some (such as the crab-eating fox) have more specialized diets. Most species of fox consume around of food every day. Foxes cache excess food, burying it for later consumption, usually under leaves, snow, or soil. While hunting, foxes tend to use a particular pouncing technique, such that they crouch down to camouflage themselves in the terrain and then use their hind legs to leap up with great force and land on top of their chosen prey. Using their pronounced canine teeth, they can then grip the prey&#x27;s neck and shake it until it is dead or can be readily disemboweled.

The gray fox is one of only two canine species known to regularly climb trees; the other is the raccoon dog.

===Sexual characteristics===

The male fox&#x27;s scrotum is held up close to the body with the testes inside even after they descend. Like other canines, the male fox has a baculum, or penile bone. The testes of red foxes are smaller than those of Arctic foxes. Sperm formation in red foxes begins in August–September, with the testicles attaining their greatest weight in December–February.

Vixens are in heat for one to six days, making their reproductive cycle twelve months long. As with other canines, the ova are shed during estrus without the need for the stimulation of copulating. Once the egg is fertilized, the vixen enters a period of gestation that can last from 52 to 53 days. Foxes tend to have an average litter size of four to five with an 80 percent success rate in becoming pregnant. Litter sizes can vary greatly according to species and environmentthe Arctic fox, for example, can have up to eleven kits.

The vixen usually has six or eight mammae. Each teat has 8 to 20 lactiferous ducts, which connect the mammary gland to the nipple, allowing for milk to be carried to the nipple.

===Vocalization===
The fox&#x27;s vocal repertoire is vast, and includes:
;Whine: Made shortly after birth. Occurs at a high rate when kits are hungry and when their body temperatures are low. Whining stimulates the mother to care for her young; it also has been known to stimulate the male fox into caring for his mate and kits.
;Yelp: Made about 19 days later. The kits&#x27; whining turns into infantile barks, yelps, which occur heavily during play.
;Explosive call: At the age of about one month, the kits can emit an explosive call which is intended to be threatening to intruders or other cubs; a high-pitched howl.
;Combative call: In adults, the explosive call becomes an open-mouthed combative call during any conflict; a sharper bark.
;Growl: An adult fox&#x27;s indication to their kits to feed or head to the adult&#x27;s location.
;Bark: Adult foxes warn against intruders and in defense by barking.

In the case of domesticated foxes, the whining seems to remain in adult individuals as a sign of excitement and submission in the presence of their owners.

==Classification==
Canids commonly known as foxes include the following genera and species:


==Conservation==
Several fox species are endangered in their native environments. Pressures placed on foxes include habitat loss and being hunted for pelts, other trade, or control. Due in part to their opportunistic hunting style and industriousness, foxes are commonly resented as nuisance animals. Contrastingly, foxes, while often considered pests themselves, have been successfully employed to control pests on fruit farms while leaving the fruit intact.

===&quot;Urocyon littoralis&quot;===
The island fox, though considered a near-threatened species throughout the world, is becoming increasingly endangered in its endemic environment of the California Channel Islands. A population on an island is smaller than those on the mainland because of limited resources like space, food and shelter. Island populations are therefore highly susceptible to external threats ranging from introduced predatory species and humans to extreme weather.

On the California Channel Islands, it was found that the population of the island fox was so low due to an outbreak of canine distemper virus from 1999 to 2000 as well as predation by non-native golden eagles. Since 1993, the eagles have caused the population to decline by as much as 95%. Because of the low number of foxes, the population went through an Allee effect (an effect in which, at low enough densities, an individual&#x27;s fitness decreases). Conservationists had to take healthy breeding pairs out of the wild population to breed them in captivity until they had enough foxes to release back into the wild. Nonnative grazers were also removed so that native plants would be able to grow back to their natural height, thereby providing adequate cover and protection for the foxes against golden eagles.

===&quot;Pseudalopex fulvipes&quot;===
Darwin&#x27;s fox was considered critically endangered because of their small known population of 250 mature individuals as well as their restricted distribution. However, the IUCN have since downgraded the conservation status from crictically endangered in their 2004 and 2008 assessments to endangered in the 2016 assessment, following findings of a wider distribution than previously reported. On the Chilean mainland, the population is limited to Nahuelbuta National Park and the surrounding Valdivian rainforest. Similarly on Chiloé Island, their population is limited to the forests that extend from the southernmost to the northwesternmost part of the island. Though the Nahuelbuta National Park is protected, 90% of the species live on Chiloé Island.

A major issue the species faces is their dwindling, limited habitat due to the cutting and burning of the unprotected forests. Because of deforestation, the Darwin&#x27;s fox habitat is shrinking, allowing for their competitor&#x27;s (chilla fox) preferred habitat of open space, to increase; the Darwin&#x27;s fox, subsequently, is being outcompeted. Another problem they face is their inability to fight off diseases transmitted by the increasing number of pet dogs. To conserve these animals, researchers suggest the need for the forests that link the Nahuelbuta National Park to the coast of Chile and in turn Chiloé Island and its forests, to be protected. They also suggest that other forests around Chile be examined to determine whether Darwin&#x27;s foxes have previously existed there or can live there in the future, should the need to reintroduce the species to those areas arise. And finally, the researchers advise for the creation of a captive breeding program, in Chile, because of the limited number of mature individuals in the wild.

==Relationships with humans==
Foxes are often considered pests or nuisance creatures for their opportunistic attacks on poultry and other small livestock. Fox attacks on humans are not common.
Many foxes adapt well to human environments, with several species classified as &quot;resident urban carnivores&quot; for their ability to sustain populations entirely within urban boundaries. Foxes in urban areas can live longer and can have smaller litter sizes than foxes in non-urban areas. Urban foxes are ubiquitous in Europe, where they show altered behaviors compared to non-urban foxes, including increased population density, smaller territory, and pack foraging. Foxes have been introduced in numerous locations, with varying effects on indigenous flora and fauna.

In some countries, foxes are major predators of rabbits and hens. Population oscillations of these two species were the first nonlinear oscillation studied and led to the derivation of the Lotka–Volterra equation.

===As food===
Fox meat is edible, though it is not considered a common cuisine in any country.

===Hunting===

Fox hunting originated in the United Kingdom in the 16th century. Hunting with dogs is now banned in the United Kingdom, though hunting without dogs is still permitted. Red foxes were introduced into Australia in the early 19th century for sport, and have since become widespread through much of the country. They have caused population decline among many native species and prey on livestock, especially new lambs. Fox hunting is practiced as recreation in several other countries including Canada, France, Ireland, Italy, Russia, United States and Australia.

===Domestication===
There are many records of domesticated red foxes and others, but rarely of sustained domestication. A recent and notable exception is the Russian silver fox, which resulted in visible and behavioral changes, and is a case study of an animal population modeling according to human domestication needs. The current group of domesticated silver foxes are the result of nearly fifty years of experiments in the Soviet Union and Russia to &quot;de novo&quot; domesticate the silver morph of the red fox. This selective breeding resulted in physical and behavioral traits appearing that are frequently seen in domestic cats, dogs, and other animals, such as pigmentation changes, floppy ears, and curly tails. Notably, the new foxes became more tame, allowing themselves to be petted, whimpering to get attention and sniffing and licking their caretakers.

===Urban settings===

Foxes are among the comparatively few mammals which have been able to adapt themselves to a certain degree to living in urban (mostly suburban) human environments. Their omnivorous diet allows them to survive on discarded food waste, and their skittish and often nocturnal nature means that they are often able to avoid detection, despite their larger size.

Urban foxes have been identified as threats to cats and small dogs, and for this reason there is often pressure to exclude them from these environments.

The San Joaquin kit fox is a highly endangered species that has, ironically, become adapted to urban living in the San Joaquin Valley and Salinas Valley of southern California. Its diet includes mice, ground squirrels, rabbits, hares, bird eggs, and insects, and it has claimed habitats in open areas, golf courses, drainage basins, and school grounds.

Though rare, bites by foxes have been reported; in 2018, a woman in Clapham, London was bitten on the arm by a fox after she had left the door to her flat open.

===In popular culture===

The fox appears in many cultures, usually in folklore. There are slight variations in their depictions. In European, Persian, East Asian, and Native American folklore, foxes are symbols of cunning and trickery—a reputation derived especially from their reputed ability to evade hunters. This is usually represented as a character possessing these traits. These traits are used on a wide variety of characters, either making them a nuisance to the story, a misunderstood hero, or a devious villain.

In East Asian folklore, foxes are depicted as familiar spirits possessing magic powers. Similar to in the folklore of other regions, foxes are portrayed as mischievous, usually tricking other people, with the ability to disguise as an attractive female human. Others depict them as mystical, sacred creatures who can bring wonder or ruin. Nine-tailed foxes appear in Chinese folklore, literature, and mythology, in which, depending on the tale, they can be a good or a bad omen. The motif was eventually introduced from Chinese to Japanese and Korean cultures.

The constellation Vulpecula represents a fox.

<text>Foundationalism concerns philosophical theories of knowledge resting upon non-inferential justified belief, or some secure foundation of certainty such as a conclusion inferred from a basis of sound premises. The main rival of the foundationalist theory of justification is the coherence theory of justification, whereby a body of knowledge, not requiring a secure foundation, can be established by the interlocking strength of its components, like a puzzle solved without prior certainty that each small region was solved correctly.

Identifying the alternatives as either circular reasoning or infinite regress, and thus exhibiting the regress problem, Aristotle made foundationalism his own clear choice, positing basic beliefs underpinning others. Descartes, the most famed foundationalist, discovered a foundation in the fact of his own existence and in the &quot;clear and distinct&quot; ideas of reason, whereas Locke found a foundation in experience. Differing foundations may reflect differing epistemological emphases—empiricists emphasizing &quot;experience&quot;, rationalists emphasizing &quot;reason&quot;—but may blend both.

In the 1930s, debate over foundationalism revived. Whereas Moritz Schlick viewed scientific knowledge like a pyramid where a special class of statements does not require verification through other beliefs and serves as a foundation, Otto Neurath argued that scientific knowledge lacks an ultimate foundation and acts like a raft. In the 1950s, the dominance of foundationalism was challenged by a number of philosophers such as Willard Van Orman Quine and Wilfrid Sellars. Quine&#x27;s ontological relativity found any belief networked to one&#x27;s beliefs on all of reality, while auxiliary beliefs somewhere in the vast network are readily modified to protect desired beliefs.

Classically, foundationalism had posited infallibility of basic beliefs and deductive reasoning between beliefs—a strong foundationalism. Around 1975, weak foundationalism emerged. Thus recent foundationalists have variously allowed fallible basic beliefs, and inductive reasoning between them, either by enumerative induction or by inference to the best explanation. And whereas internalists require cognitive access to justificatory means, externalists find justification without such access.

==History==
Foundationalism was initiated by French early modern philosopher René Descartes. In his &quot;Meditations&quot;, Descartes challenged the contemporary principles of philosophy by arguing that everything he knew he learnt from or through his senses. He used various arguments to challenge the reliability of the senses, citing previous errors and the possibilities that he was dreaming or being deceived by an Evil Demon which rendered all of his beliefs about the external world false. Descartes attempted to establish the secure foundations for knowledge to avoid scepticism. He contrasted the information provided by senses, which is unclear and uncertain, with the truths of geometry, which are clear and distinct. Geometrical truths are also certain and indubitable; Descartes thus attempted to find truths which were clear and distinct because they would be indubitably true and a suitable foundation for knowledge. His method was to question all of his beliefs until he reached something clear and distinct that was indubitably true. The result was his &quot;cogito ergo sum&quot; – &#x27;I think therefore I am&#x27;, or the belief that he was thinking – as his indubitable belief suitable as a foundation for knowledge. This resolved Descartes&#x27; problem of the Evil Demon. Even if his beliefs about the external world were false, his beliefs about what he was experiencing were still indubitably true, even if those perceptions do not relate to anything in the world.

Several other philosophers of the early modern period, including John Locke, G. W. Leibniz, George Berkeley, David Hume, and Thomas Reid, accepted foundationalism as well. Baruch Spinoza was interpreted as metaphysical foundationalist by G. W. F. Hegel, a proponent of coherentism. Immanuel Kant&#x27;s foundationalism rests on his theory of categories.

In late modern philosophy, foundationalism was defended by J. G. Fichte in his book &quot;Grundlage der gesamten Wissenschaftslehre&quot; (1794/1795), Wilhelm Windelband in his book &quot;Über die Gewißheit der Erkenntniss.&quot; (1873), and Gottlob Frege in his book &quot;Die Grundlagen der Arithmetik&quot; (1884).

In contemporary philosophy, foundationalism has been defended by Edmund Husserl, Bertrand Russell and John McDowell.

==Definition==
Foundationalism is an attempt to respond to the regress problem of justification in epistemology. According to this argument, every proposition requires justification to support it, but any justification also needs to be justified itself. If this goes on &quot;ad infinitum&quot;, it is not clear how anything in the chain could be justified. Foundationalism holds that there are &#x27;basic beliefs&#x27; which serve as foundations to anchor the rest of our beliefs. Strong versions of the theory assert that an indirectly justified belief is completely justified by basic beliefs; more moderate theories hold that indirectly justified beliefs require basic beliefs to be justified, but can be further justified by other factors.

Since ancient Greece, Western philosophy has pursued a solid foundation as the ultimate and eternal reference system for all knowledge. This foundation serves not only as a starting point but also as the fundamental basis for understanding the truth of existence. Thinking is the process of proving the validity of knowledge, not proving the rationality of the foundation from which knowledge is shaped. This means, with ultimate cause, the foundation is true, absolute, entire and impossible to prove. Neopragmatist philosopher Richard Rorty, a proponent of anti-foundationalism, said that the fundamentalism confirmed the existence of the &quot;privileged representation&quot; which constitutes the foundation, from which dominates epistemology. The earliest foundationalism is Plato&#x27;s theory of Forms, which shows the general concept as a model for the release of existence, which is only the faint copy of the Forms of eternity, that means, understanding the expression of objects leads to acquiring all knowledge, then acquiring knowledge accompanies achieving the truth. Achieving the truth means understanding the foundation. This idea still has some appeal in for example international relations studies.

===Classical foundationalism===
Foundationalism holds basic beliefs exist, which are justified without reference to other beliefs, and that nonbasic beliefs must ultimately be justified by basic beliefs. Classical foundationalism maintains that basic beliefs must be infallible if they are to justify nonbasic beliefs, and that only deductive reasoning can be used to transfer justification from one belief to another. Laurence BonJour has argued that the classical formulation of foundationalism requires basic beliefs to be infallible, incorrigible, indubitable, and certain if they are to be adequately justified. Mental states and immediate experience are often taken as good candidates for basic beliefs because it is argued that beliefs about these do not need further support to be justified.

===Modest foundationalism===
As an alternative to the classic view, modest foundationalism does not require that basic perceptual beliefs are infallible, but holds that it is reasonable to assume that perceptual beliefs are justified unless evidence to the contrary exists. This is still foundationalism because it maintains that all non-basic beliefs must be ultimately justified by basic beliefs, but it does not require that basic beliefs are infallible and allows inductive reasoning as an acceptable form of inference. For example, a belief that &#x27;I see red&#x27; could be defeated with psychological evidence showing my mind to be confused or inattentive. Modest foundationalism can also be used to avoid the problem of inference. Even if perceptual beliefs are infallible, it is not clear that they can infallibly ground empirical knowledge (even if my belief that the table looks red to me is infallible, the inference to the belief that the table actually is red might not be infallible). Modest foundationalism does not require this link between perception and reality to be so strong; our perception of a table being yellow is adequate justification to believe that this is the case, even if it is not infallible.

Reformed epistemology is a form of modest foundationalism which takes religious beliefs as basic because they are non-inferentially justified: their justification arises from religious experience, rather than prior beliefs. This takes a modest approach to foundationalism – religious beliefs are not taken to be infallible, but are assumed to be &quot;prima facie&quot; justified unless evidence arises to the contrary.

===Internalism and externalism===
Foundationalism can take internalist and externalist forms. Internalism requires that a believer&#x27;s justification for a belief must be accessible to them for it to be justified. Foundationalist internalists have held that basic beliefs are justified by mental events or states, such as experiences, that do not constitute beliefs. Alternatively, basic beliefs may be justified by some special property of the belief itself, such as its being self-evident or infallible. Externalism maintains that it is unnecessary for the means of justification of a belief to be accessible to the believer.

Reliabilism is an externalist foundationalist theory, initially proposed by Alvin Goldman, which argues that a belief is justified if it is reliably produced, meaning that it will be probably true. Goldman distinguished between two kinds of justification for beliefs: belief-dependent and belief-independent. A belief-dependent process uses prior beliefs to produce new beliefs; a belief-independent process does not, using other stimuli instead. Beliefs produced this way are justified because the processes that cause them are reliable; this might be because we have evolved to reach good conclusions when presented with sense-data, meaning the conclusions we draw from our senses are usually true.

==Criticisms==

Critics of foundationalism often argue that for a belief to be justified it must be supported by other beliefs; in Donald Davidson&#x27;s phrase, &quot;only a belief can be a reason for another belief&quot;. For instance, Wilfrid Sellars argued that non-doxastic mental states cannot be reasons, and so noninferential warrant cannot be derived from them. Similarly, critics of externalist foundationalism argue that only mental states or properties the believer is aware of could make a belief justified.

Postmodernists and post-structuralists such as Richard Rorty and Jacques Derrida have attacked foundationalism on the grounds that the truth of a statement or discourse is only verifiable in accordance with other statements and discourses. Rorty in particular elaborates further on this, claiming that the individual, the community, the human body as a whole have a &#x27;means by which they know the world&#x27; (this entails language, culture, semiotic systems, mathematics, science etc.). In order to verify particular means, or particular statements belonging to certain means (e.g., the propositions of the natural sciences), a person would have to &#x27;step outside&#x27; the means and critique them neutrally, in order to provide a foundation for adopting them. However, this is impossible. The only way in which one can know the world is through the means by which they know the world; a method cannot justify itself. This argument can be seen as directly related to Wittgenstein&#x27;s theory of language, drawing a parallel between postmodernism and late logical positivism that is united in critique of foundationalism.

<text>Felidae () is the family of mammals in the order Carnivora colloquially referred to as cats. A member of this family is also called a felid ().

The 41 extant Felidae species exhibit the greatest diversity in fur patterns of all terrestrial carnivores. Cats have retractile claws, slender muscular bodies and strong flexible forelimbs. Their teeth and facial muscles allow for a powerful bite. They are all obligate carnivores, and most are solitary predators ambushing or stalking their prey. Wild cats occur in Africa, Europe, Asia and the Americas. Some wild cat species are adapted to forest and savanna habitats, some to arid environments, and a few also to wetlands and mountainous terrain. Their activity patterns range from nocturnal and crepuscular to diurnal, depending on their preferred prey species.

Reginald Innes Pocock divided the extant Felidae into three subfamilies: the Pantherinae, the Felinae and the Acinonychinae, differing from each other by the ossification of the hyoid apparatus and by the cutaneous sheaths which protect their claws.
This concept has been revised following developments in molecular biology and techniques for the analysis of morphological data. Today, the living Felidae are divided into two subfamilies: the Pantherinae and Felinae, with the Acinonychinae subsumed into the latter. Pantherinae includes five &quot;Panthera&quot; and two &quot;Neofelis&quot; species, while Felinae includes the other 34 species in 12 genera.

The first cats emerged during the Oligocene about , with the appearance of &quot;Proailurus&quot; and &quot;Pseudaelurus&quot;. The latter species complex was ancestral to two main lines of felids: the cats in the extant subfamilies and a group of extinct &quot;saber-tooth&quot; felids of the subfamily Machairodontinae, which range from the type genus &quot;Machairodus&quot; of the late Miocene to &quot;Smilodon&quot; of the Pleistocene. The &quot;false saber-toothed cats&quot;, the Barbourofelidae and Nimravidae, are not true cats but are closely related. Together with the Felidae, Viverridae, Nandiniidae, Eupleridae, hyenas and mongooses, they constitute the Feliformia.

==Characteristics==

All members of the cat family have the following characteristics in common:
* They are digitigrade and have five toes on their forefeet and four on their hind feet. Their curved claws are protractile and attached to the terminal bones of the toe with ligaments and tendons. The claws are guarded by cutaneous sheaths, except in the &quot;Acinonyx&quot;.
* The pads of both fore and hind feet form compact three-lobed cushions.
* They actively protract the claws by contracting muscles in the toe, and they passively retract them. The dewclaws are expanded but do not protract.
* They have lithe and flexible bodies with muscular limbs.
* Their skulls are foreshortened with a rounded profile and large orbits.
* They have 30 teeth with a dental formula of . The upper third premolar and lower molar are adapted as carnassial teeth, suited to tearing and cutting flesh. The canine teeth are large, reaching exceptional size in the extinct Machairodontinae. The lower carnassial is smaller than the upper carnassial and has a crown with two compressed blade-like pointed cusps.
* Their tongues are covered with horn-like papillae, which rasp meat from prey and aid in grooming.
* Their noses project slightly beyond the lower jaw.
* Their eyes are relatively large, situated to provide binocular vision. Their night vision is especially good due to the presence of a &quot;tapetum lucidum&quot;, which reflects light inside the eyeball, and gives felid eyes their distinctive shine. As a result, the eyes of felids are about six times more light-sensitive than those of humans, and many species are at least partially nocturnal. The retina of felids also contains a relatively high proportion of rod cells, adapted for distinguishing moving objects in conditions of dim light, which are complemented by the presence of cone cells for sensing colour during the day.
* They have well-developed and highly sensitive whiskers above the eyes, on the cheeks, and the muzzle, but not below the chin. Whiskers help to navigate in the dark and to capture and hold prey.
* Their external ears are large and especially sensitive to high-frequency sounds in the smaller cat species. This sensitivity allows them to locate small rodent prey.
* The penis is subconical, facing downward when not erect and backward during urination. The baculum is small or vestigial, and shorter than in the Canidae. Most felids have penile spines that induce ovulation during copulation.
* They have a vomeronasal organ in the roof of the mouth, allowing them to &quot;taste&quot; the air. The use of this organ is associated with the flehmen response.
* They cannot detect the sweetness of sugar, as they lack the sweet taste receptor.
* They share a broadly similar set of vocalizations but with some variation between species. In particular, the pitch of calls varies, with larger species producing deeper sounds; overall, the frequency of felid calls ranges between 50 and 10,000 hertz. The standard sounds made by felids include mewing, chuffing, spitting, hissing, snarling and growling. Mewing and chuffing are the main contact sound, whereas the others signify an aggressive motivation.
* They can purr during both phases of respiration, though pantherine cats seem to purr only during oestrus and copulation, and as cubs when suckling. Purring is generally a low-pitch sound of 16.8–27.5 Hz and is mixed with other vocalization types during the expiratory phase. The ability to roar comes from an elongated and specially adapted larynx and hyoid apparatus. When air passes through the larynx on the way from the lungs, the cartilage walls of the larynx vibrate, producing sound. Only lions, leopards, tigers, and jaguars are truly able to roar, although the loudest mews of snow leopards have a similar, if less structured, sound. Clouded leopards can neither purr nor roar, and so &quot;Neofelis&quot; is said to be a sister group to &quot;Panthera&quot;. Sabretoothed cats may have had the ability to both roar and purr.
The colour, length and density of their fur are very diverse. Fur colour covers the gamut from white to black, and fur patterns from distinctive small spots, and stripes to small blotches and rosettes. Most cat species are born with spotted fur, except the jaguarundi (&quot;Herpailurus yagouaroundi&quot;), Asian golden cat (&quot;Catopuma temminckii&quot;) and caracal (&quot;Caracal caracal&quot;). The spotted fur of lion (&quot;Panthera leo&quot;), cheetah (&quot;Acinonyx jubatus&quot;) and cougar (&quot;Puma concolor&quot;) cubs change to uniform fur during their ontogeny. Those living in cold environments have thick fur with long hair, like the snow leopard (&quot;Panthera uncia&quot;) and the Pallas&#x27;s cat (&quot;Otocolobus manul&quot;). Those living in tropical and hot climate zones have short fur. Several species exhibit melanism with all-black individuals, cougars are notable for lacking melanism but leucism and albinism are present in cougars along with many other felids.

In the great majority of cat species, the tail is between a third and a half of the body length, although with some exceptions, like the &quot;Lynx&quot; species and margay (&quot;Leopardus wiedii&quot;). Cat species vary greatly in body and skull sizes, and weights:
* The largest cat species is the tiger (&quot;Panthera tigris&quot;), with a head-to-body length of up to , a weight range of at least , and a skull length ranging from . Although the maximum skull length of a lion is slightly greater at , it is generally smaller in head-to-body length than the tiger.
* The smallest cat species are the rusty-spotted cat (&quot;Prionailurus rubiginosus&quot;) and the black-footed cat (&quot;Felis nigripes&quot;). The former is in length and weighs . The latter has a head-to-body length of and a maximum recorded weight of .

Most cat species have a haploid number of 18 or 19. Central and South American cats have a haploid number of 18, possibly due to the combination of two smaller chromosomes into a larger one.

Felidae have type IIx muscle fibers three times more powerful than the muscle fibers of human athletes.

==Evolution==

The family Felidae is part of the Feliformia, a suborder that diverged probably about into several families. The Felidae and the Asiatic linsangs are considered a sister group, which split about .

The earliest cats probably appeared about . &quot;Proailurus&quot; is the oldest known cat that occurred after the Eocene–Oligocene extinction event about ; fossil remains were excavated in France and Mongolia&#x27;s Hsanda Gol Formation. Fossil occurrences indicate that the Felidae arrived in North America around . This is about 20million years later than the Ursidae and the Nimravidae, and about 10 million years later than the Canidae.

In the Early Miocene about , &quot;Pseudaelurus&quot; lived in Africa. Its fossil jaws were also excavated in geological formations of Europe&#x27;s Vallesian, Asia&#x27;s Middle Miocene and North America&#x27;s late Hemingfordian to late Barstovian epochs.

In the Early or Middle Miocene, the saber-toothed Machairodontinae evolved in Africa and migrated northwards in the Late Miocene. With their large upper canines, they were adapted to prey on large-bodied megaherbivores. &quot;Miomachairodus&quot; is the oldest known member of this subfamily. &quot;Metailurus&quot; lived in Africa and Eurasia about . Several &quot;Paramachaerodus&quot; skeletons were found in Spain. &quot;Homotherium&quot; appeared in Africa, Eurasia and North America around , and &quot;Megantereon&quot; about . &quot;Smilodon&quot; lived in North and South America from about . This subfamily became extinct in the Late Pleistocene.

Results of mitochondrial analysis indicate that the living Felidae species descended from a common ancestor, which originated in Asia in the Late Miocene epoch. They migrated to Africa, Europe and the Americas in the course of at least ten migration waves during the past ~11 million years. Low sea levels and interglacial and glacial periods facilitated these migrations. &quot;Panthera blytheae&quot; is the oldest known pantherine cat dated to the late Messinian to early Zanclean ages about . A fossil skull was excavated in 2010 in Zanda County on the Tibetan Plateau. &quot;Panthera palaeosinensis&quot; from North China probably dates to the Late Miocene or Early Pliocene. The skull of the holotype is similar to that of a lion or leopard. &quot;Panthera zdanskyi&quot; dates to the Gelasian about . Several fossil skulls and jawbones were excavated in northwestern China. &quot;Panthera gombaszoegensis&quot; is the earliest known pantherine cat that lived in Europe about .

Living felids fall into eight evolutionary lineages or species clades. Genotyping of the nuclear DNA of all 41 felid species revealed that hybridization between species occurred in the course of evolution within the majority of the eight lineages.

Modelling of felid coat pattern transformations revealed that nearly all patterns evolved from small spots.

==Classification==
Traditionally, five subfamilies had been distinguished within the Felidae based on phenotypical features: the Pantherinae, the Felinae, the Acinonychinae, and the extinct Machairodontinae and Proailurinae. Acinonychinae used to only contain the genus &quot;Acinonyx&quot; but this genus is now within the Felinae subfamily.

<doc id="11303" wikidata="Q36192" url="?curid=11303" title="Folklore">
<text>Folklore is the body of expressive culture shared by a particular group of people, culture or subculture. This includes oral traditions such as tales, myths, legends, proverbs, poems, jokes, and other oral traditions. This also includes material culture, such as traditional building styles common to the group. Folklore also encompasses customary lore, taking actions for folk beliefs, including folk religion, and the forms and rituals of celebrations such as Christmas, weddings, folk dances, and initiation rites. 

Each one of these, either singly or in combination, is considered a folklore artifact or traditional cultural expression. Just as essential as the form, folklore also encompasses the transmission of these artifacts from one region to another or from one generation to the next. Folklore is not something one can typically gain from a formal school curriculum or study in the fine arts. Instead, these traditions are passed along informally from one individual to another, either through verbal instruction or demonstration.

The academic study of folklore is called folklore studies or folkloristics, and it can be explored at the undergraduate, graduate, and Ph.D. levels.

== Overview ==

The word &quot;folklore&quot;, a compound of &quot;folk&quot; and &quot;lore&quot;, was coined in 1846 by the Englishman William Thoms, who contrived the term as a replacement for the contemporary terminology of &quot;popular antiquities&quot; or &quot;popular literature&quot;. The second half of the word, &quot;&quot;, comes from Old English lār &#x27;instruction&#x27;. It is the knowledge and traditions of a particular group frequently passed along by word of mouth.

The concept of &quot;&quot; has varied over time. When Thoms first created this term, &quot;folk&quot; applied only to rural, frequently poor, and illiterate peasants. A more modern definition of &quot;folk&quot; is a social group that includes two or more people with common traits who express their shared identity through distinctive traditions. &quot;Folk is a flexible concept which can refer to a nation as in American folklore or to a single family.&quot; This expanded social definition of &quot;folk&quot; supports a broader view of the material, i.e., the lore, considered to be &quot;folklore artifacts&quot;. These now include all &quot;things people make with words (verbal lore), things they make with their hands (material lore), and things they make with their actions (customary lore)&quot;. Folklore are no longer considered to be limited to that which is old or obsolete. These folk artifacts continue to be passed along informally, as a rule anonymously, and always in multiple variants. The folk group is not individualistic; it is community-based and nurtures its lore in community. &quot;As new groups emerge, new folklore is created… surfers, motorcyclists, computer programmers&quot;. In direct contrast to high culture, where any single work of a named artist is protected by copyright law, folklore is a function of shared identity within a common social group.

Having identified folk artifacts, the professional folklorist strives to understand the &quot;significance&quot; of these beliefs, customs, and objects for the group, since these cultural units would not be passed along unless they had some continued relevance within the group. That meaning can, however, shift and morph; for example, the Halloween celebration of the 21st century is not the All Hallows&#x27; Eve of the Middle Ages and even gives rise to its own set of urban legends independent of the historical celebration; the cleansing rituals of Orthodox Judaism were originally good public health in a land with little water, but now these customs signify for some people identification as an Orthodox Jew. By comparison, a common action such as tooth brushing, which is also transmitted within a group, remains a practical hygiene and health issue and does not rise to the level of a group-defining tradition. Tradition is initially remembered behavior; once it loses its practical purpose, there is no reason for further transmission unless it has been imbued with meaning beyond the initial practicality of the action. This meaning is at the core of folkloristics, the study of folklore.

With the increasing theoretical sophistication of the social sciences, it has become evident that folklore is a naturally occurring and necessary component of any social group; it is indeed all around us. Folklore does not have to be old or antiquated; it continues to be created and transmitted, and in any group, it is used to differentiate between &quot;us&quot; and &quot;them.&quot;

== Origin and development of folklore studies ==
Folklore began to distinguish itself as an autonomous discipline during the period of romantic nationalism in Europe. A particular figure in this development was Johann Gottfried von Herder, whose writings in the 1770s presented oral traditions as organic processes grounded in the locale. After the German states were invaded by Napoleonic France, Herder&#x27;s approach was adopted by many of his fellow Germans, who systematized the recorded folk traditions and used them in their process of nation building. This process was enthusiastically embraced by smaller nations, like Finland, Estonia, and Hungary, which were seeking political independence from their dominant neighbors.

Folklore, as a field of study, further developed among 19th-century European scholars, who were contrasting tradition with the newly developing modernity. Its focus was the oral folklore of the rural peasant populations, which were considered as residues and survivals of the past that continued to exist within the lower strata of society. The &quot;Kinder- und Hausmärchen&quot; of the Brothers Grimm (first published 1812) is the best known but by no means only collection of verbal folklore of the European peasantry of that time. This interest in stories, sayings, and songs continued throughout the 19th century and aligned the fledgling discipline of folkloristics with literature and mythology. By the turn of the 20th century, the number and sophistication of folklore studies and folklorists had grown both in Europe and North America. Whereas European folklorists remained focused on the oral folklore of the homogenous peasant populations in their regions, the American folklorists, led by Franz Boas and Ruth Benedict, chose to consider Native American cultures in their research, and included the totality of their customs and beliefs as folklore. This distinction aligned American folkloristics with cultural anthropology and ethnology, using the same techniques of data collection in their field research. This divided alliance of folkloristics between the humanities in Europe and the social sciences in America offers a wealth of theoretical vantage points and research tools to the field of folkloristics as a whole, even as it continues to be a point of discussion within the field itself.

The term &quot;folkloristics&quot;, along with the alternative name &quot;folklore studies&quot;, became widely used in the 1950s to distinguish the academic study of traditional culture from the folklore artifacts themselves. When the American Folklife Preservation Act (Public Law 94-201) was passed by the U.S. Congress in January 1976, to coincide with the Bicentennial Celebration, folkloristics in the United States came of age.

&quot;…[Folklife] means the traditional expressive culture shared within the various groups in the United States: familial, ethnic, occupational, religious, regional; expressive culture includes a wide range of creative and symbolic forms such as custom, belief, technical skill, language, literature, art, architecture, music, play, dance, drama, ritual, pageantry, handicraft; these expressions are mainly learned orally, by imitation, or in performance, and are generally maintained without benefit of formal instruction or institutional direction.&quot; 

Added to the extensive array of other legislation designed to protect the natural and cultural heritage of the United States, this law also marks a shift in national awareness. It gives voice to a growing understanding that cultural diversity is a national strength and a resource worthy of protection. Paradoxically, it is a unifying feature, not something that separates the citizens of a country. &quot;We no longer view cultural difference as a problem to be solved, but as a tremendous opportunity. In the diversity of American folklife, we find a marketplace teeming with the exchange of traditional forms and cultural ideas, a rich resource for Americans&quot;. This diversity is celebrated annually at the Smithsonian Folklife Festival and many other folklife fests around the country.

There are numerous other definitions. According to William Bascom major article on the topic, there are &quot;four functions to folklore&quot;:
* Folklore lets people escape from repressions imposed upon them by society.
* Folklore validates culture, justifying its rituals and institutions to those who perform and observe them.
* Folklore is a pedagogic device which reinforces morals and values and builds wit.
* Folklore is a means of applying social pressure and exercising social control.

== Definition of &quot;folk&quot; ==
The folk of the 19th century, the social group identified in the original term &quot;folklore&quot;, was characterized by being rural, illiterate, and poor. They were the peasants living in the countryside, in contrast to the urban populace of the cities. Only toward the end of the century did the urban proletariat (on the coattails of Marxist theory) become included with the rural poor as folk. The common feature in this expanded definition of folk was their identification as the underclass of society.

Moving forward into the 20th century, in tandem with new thinking in the social sciences, folklorists also revised and expanded their concept of the folk group. By the 1960s, it was understood that social groups, i.e., folk groups, were all around us; each individual is enmeshed in a multitude of differing identities and their concomitant social groups. The first group that each of us is born into is the family, and each family has its own unique family folklore. As a child grows into an individual, its identities also increase to include age, language, ethnicity, occupation, etc. Each of these cohorts has its own folklore, and as one folklorist points out, this is &quot;not idle speculation… Decades of fieldwork have demonstrated conclusively that these groups do have their own folklore.&quot; In this modern understanding, folklore is a function of shared identity within any social group.

This folklore can include jokes, sayings, and expected behavior in multiple variants, always transmitted in an informal manner. For the most part, it will be learned by observation, imitation, repetition, or correction by other group members. This informal knowledge is used to confirm and reinforce the identity of the group. It can be used both internally within the group to express their common identity, for example in an initiation ceremony for new members. It can also be used externally to differentiate the group from outsiders, like a folk dance demonstration at a community festival. Significant to folklorists here is that there are two opposing but equally valid ways to use this in the study of a group: you can start with an identified group in order to explore its folklore, or you can identify folklore items and use them to identify the social group.

Beginning in the 1960s, a further expansion of the concept of folk began to unfold through the study of folklore. Individual researchers identified folk groups that had previously been overlooked and ignored. One notable example of this is found in an issue of the &quot;Journal of American Folklore&quot;, published in 1975, which is dedicated exclusively to articles on women&#x27;s folklore, with approaches that had not come from a man&#x27;s perspective. Other groups that were highlighted as part of this broadened understanding of the folk group were non-traditional families, occupational groups, and families that pursued the production of folk items over multiple generations.

Folklorist Richard Dorson explained in 1976 that the study of folklore is &quot;concerned with the study of traditional culture, or the unofficial culture&quot; that is the folk culture, &quot;as opposed to the elite culture, not for the sake of proving a thesis but to learn about the mass of [humanity] overlooked by the conventional disciplines.&quot;

== Folklore genres ==

Individual folklore artifacts are commonly classified as one of three types: material, verbal or customary lore. For the most part self-explanatory, these categories include physical objects (material folklore), common sayings, expressions, stories and songs (verbal folklore), and beliefs and ways of doing things (customary folklore). There is also a fourth major subgenre defined for children&#x27;s folklore and games (childlore), as the collection and interpretation of this fertile topic is particular to school yards and neighborhood streets. Each of these genres and their subtypes is intended to organize and categorize the folklore artifacts; they provide common vocabulary and consistent labeling for folklorists to communicate with each other.

That said, each artifact is unique; in fact, one of the characteristics of all folklore artifacts is their variation within genres and types. This is in direct contrast to manufactured goods, where the goal in production is to create identical products, and any variations are considered mistakes. It is, however, just this required variation that makes identification and classification of the defining features a challenge. While this classification is essential for the subject area of folkloristics, it remains just labeling and adds little to an understanding of the traditional development and meaning of the artifacts themselves.

Necessary as they are, genre classifications are misleading in their oversimplification of the subject area. Folklore artifacts are never self-contained, they do not stand in isolation but are particulars in the self-representation of a community. Different genres are frequently combined with each other to mark an event. So a birthday celebration might include a song or formulaic way of greeting the birthday child (verbal), presentation of a cake and wrapped presents (material), as well as customs to honor the individual, such as sitting at the head of the table and blowing out the candles with a wish. There might also be special games played at birthday parties, which are not generally played at other times. Adding to the complexity of the interpretation, the birthday party for a seven-year-old will not be identical to the birthday party for that same child as a six-year-old, even though they follow the same model. For each artifact embodies a single variant of a performance in a given time and space. The task of the folklorist becomes to identify within this surfeit of variables the constants and the expressed meaning that shimmer through all variations: honoring of the individual within the circle of family and friends, gifting to express their value and worth to the group, and of course, the festival food and drink as signifiers of the event.

=== Verbal tradition ===

The formal definition of verbal lore is words, both written and oral, that are &quot;spoken, sung, voiced forms of traditional utterance that show repetitive patterns.&quot; Crucial here are the repetitive patterns. Verbal lore is not just any conversation, but words and phrases conforming to a traditional configuration recognized by both the speaker and the audience. For narrative types, by definition, they have a consistent structure and follow an existing model in their narrative form. As just one simple example, in English, the phrase &quot;An elephant walks into a bar…&quot; instantaneously flags the following text as a joke. It might be one you have already heard, but it might be one that the speaker has just thought up within the current context. Another example is the child&#x27;s song Old MacDonald Had a Farm, where each performance is distinctive in the animals named, their order, and their sounds. Songs such as this are used to express cultural values (farms are important, farmers are old and weather-beaten) and teach children about different domesticated animals.

Verbal folklore was the original folklore, the artifacts defined by William Thoms as older, oral cultural traditions of the rural populace. In his 1846 published call for help in documenting antiquities, Thoms was echoing scholars from across the European continent to collect artifacts of verbal lore. By the beginning of the 20th century, these collections had grown to include artifacts from around the world and across several centuries. A system to organize and categorize them became necessary. Antti Aarne published the first classification system for folktales in 1910. This was later expanded into the Aarne–Thompson classification system by Stith Thompson and remains the standard classification system for European folktales and other types of oral literature. As the number of classified oral artifacts grew, similarities were noted in items that had been collected from very different geographic regions, ethnic groups, and epochs, giving rise to the Historic–Geographic Method, a methodology that dominated folkloristics in the first half of the 20th century.

When William Thoms first published his appeal to document the verbal lore of the rural populations, it was believed these folk artifacts would die out as the population became literate. Over the past two centuries, this belief has proven to be wrong; folklorists continue to collect verbal lore in both written and spoken form from all social groups. Some variants might have been captured in published collections, but much of it is still transmitted orally and, indeed, continues to be generated in new forms and variants at an alarming rate.

=== Material culture ===
The genre of material culture includes all artifacts that can be touched, held, lived in, or eaten. They are tangible objects with a physical or mental presence, either intended for permanent use or to be used at the next meal. Most of these folklore artifacts are single objects that have been created by hand for a specific purpose; however, folk artifacts can also be mass-produced, such as dreidels or Christmas decorations. These items continue to be considered folklore because of their long (pre-industrial) history and their customary use. All of these material objects &quot;existed prior to and continue alongside mechanized industry. … [They are] transmitted across the generations and subject to the same forces of conservative tradition and individual variation&quot; that are found in all folk artifacts. Folklorists are interested in the physical form, the method of manufacture or construction, the pattern of use, as well as the procurement of the raw materials. The meaning to those who both make and use these objects is important. Of primary significance in these studies is the complex balance of continuity over change in both their design and their decoration.
In Europe, prior to the Industrial Revolution, everything was made by hand. While some folklorists of the 19th century wanted to secure the oral traditions of the rural folk before the populace became literate, other folklorists sought to identify hand-crafted objects before their production processes were lost to industrial manufacturing. Just as verbal lore continues to be actively created and transmitted in today&#x27;s culture, so these handicrafts can still be found all around us, with possibly a shift in purpose and meaning. There are many reasons for continuing to handmake objects for use, for example these skills may be needed to repair manufactured items, or a unique design might be required which is not (or cannot be) found in the stores. Many crafts are considered as simple home maintenance, such as cooking, sewing and carpentry. For many people, handicrafts have also become an enjoyable and satisfying hobby. Handmade objects are often regarded as prestigious, where extra time and thought is spent in their creation and their uniqueness is valued. For the folklorist, these hand-crafted objects embody multifaceted relationships in the lives of the craftspeople and the users, a concept that has been lost with mass-produced items that have no connection to an individual craftsperson.

Many traditional crafts, such as ironworking and glass-making, have been elevated to the fine or applied arts and taught in art schools; or they have been repurposed as folk art, characterized as objects whose decorative form supersedes their utilitarian needs. Folk art is found in hex signs on Pennsylvania Dutch barns, tin man sculptures made by metalworkers, front yard Christmas displays, decorated school lockers, carved gun stocks, and tattoos. &quot;Words such as naive, self-taught, and individualistic are used to describe these objects, and the exceptional rather than the representative creation is featured.&quot; This is in contrast to the understanding of folklore artifacts that are nurtured and passed along within a community.

Many objects of material folklore are challenging to classify, difficult to archive, and unwieldy to store. The assigned task of museums is to preserve and make use of these bulky artifacts of material culture. To this end, the concept of the living museum has developed, beginning in Scandinavia at the end of the 19th century. These open-air museums not only display the artifacts, but also teach visitors how the items were used, with actors reenacting the everyday lives of people from all segments of society, relying heavily on the material artifacts of a pre-industrial society. Many locations even duplicate the processing of the objects, thus creating new objects of an earlier historic time period. Living museums are now found throughout the world as part of a thriving heritage industry.

=== Customs ===
Customary culture is remembered enactment, i.e. re-enactment. It is the patterns of expected behavior within a group, the &quot;traditional and expected way of doing things&quot; A custom can be a single gesture, such as thumbs down or a handshake. It can also be a complex interaction of multiple folk customs and artifacts as seen in a child&#x27;s birthday party, including verbal lore (Happy Birthday song), material lore (presents and a birthday cake), special games (Musical chairs) and individual customs (making a wish as you blow out the candles). Each of these is a folklore artifact in its own right, potentially worthy of investigation and cultural analysis. Together they combine to build the custom of a birthday party celebration, a scripted combination of multiple artifacts which have meaning within their social group.

Folklorists divide customs into several different categories. A custom can be a seasonal celebration, such as Thanksgiving or New Year&#x27;s. It can be a life cycle celebration for an individual, such as baptism, birthday or wedding. A custom can also mark a community festival or event; examples of this are Carnival in Cologne or Mardi Gras in New Orleans. This category also includes the Smithsonian Folklife Festival celebrated each summer on the Mall in Washington, DC. A fourth category includes customs related to folk beliefs. Walking under a ladder is just one of many symbols considered unlucky. Occupational groups tend to have a rich history of customs related to their life and work, so the traditions of sailors or lumberjacks. The area of ecclesiastical folklore, which includes modes of worship not sanctioned by the established church tends to be so large and complex that it is usually treated as a specialized area of folk customs; it requires considerable expertise in standard church ritual in order to adequately interpret folk customs and beliefs that originated in official church practice.

Customary folklore is always a performance, be it a single gesture or a complex of scripted customs, and participating in the custom, either as performer or audience, signifies acknowledgment of that social group. Some customary behavior is intended to be performed and understood only within the group itself, so the handkerchief code sometimes used in the gay community or the initiation rituals of the Freemasons. Other customs are designed specifically to represent a social group to outsiders, those who do not belong to this group. The St. Patrick&#x27;s Day Parade in New York and in other communities across the continent is a single example of an ethnic group parading their separateness (differential behavior), and encouraging Americans of all stripes to show alliance to this colorful ethnic group.

These festivals and parades, with a target audience of people who do not belong to the social group, intersect with the interests and mission of public folklorists, who are engaged in the documentation, preservation, and presentation of traditional forms of folklife. With a swell in popular interest in folk traditions, these community celebrations are becoming more numerous throughout the western world. While ostensibly parading the diversity of their community, economic groups have discovered that these folk parades and festivals are good for business. All shades of people are out on the streets, eating, drinking and spending. This attracts support not only from the business community, but also from federal and state organizations for these local street parties. Paradoxically, in parading diversity within the community, these events have come to authenticate true community, where business interests ally with the varied (folk) social groups to promote the interests of the community as a whole.

=== Childlore and games ===
Childlore is a distinct branch of folklore that deals with activities passed on by children to other children, away from the influence or supervision of an adult. Children&#x27;s folklore contains artifacts from all the standard folklore genres of verbal, material, and customary lore; it is however the child-to-child conduit that distinguishes these artifacts. For childhood is a social group where children teach, learn and share their own traditions, flourishing in a street culture outside the purview of adults. This is also ideal where it needs to be collected; as Iona and Peter Opie demonstrated in their pioneering book &quot;Children&#x27;s Games in Street and Playground&quot;. Here the social group of children is studied on its own terms, not as a derivative of adult social groups. It is shown that the culture of children is quite distinctive; it is generally unnoticed by the sophisticated world of adults, and quite as little affected by it.

Of particular interest to folklorists here is the mode of transmission of these artifacts; this lore circulates exclusively within an informal pre-literate children&#x27;s network or folk group. It does not include artifacts taught to children by adults. However children can take the taught and teach it further to other children, turning it into childlore. Or they can take the artifacts and turn them into something else; so Old McDonald&#x27;s farm is transformed from animal noises to the scatological version of animal poop. This childlore is characterized by &quot;its lack of dependence on literary and fixed form. Children…operate among themselves in a world of informal and oral communication, unimpeded by the necessity of maintaining and transmitting information by written means&quot;. This is as close as folklorists can come to observing the transmission and social function of this folk knowledge before the spread of literacy during the 19th century.

As we have seen with the other genres, the original collections of children&#x27;s lore and games in the 19th century was driven by a fear that the culture of childhood would die out. Early folklorists, among them Alice Gomme in Britain and William Wells Newell in the United States, felt a need to capture the unstructured and unsupervised street life and activities of children before it was lost. This fear proved to be unfounded. In a comparison of any modern school playground during recess and the painting of &quot;Children&#x27;s Games&quot; by Pieter Breugel the Elder we can see that the activity level is similar, and many of the games from the 1560 painting are recognizable and comparable to modern variations still played today.

These same artifacts of childlore, in innumerable variations, also continue to serve the same function of learning and practicing skills needed for growth. So bouncing and swinging rhythms and rhymes encourage development of balance and coordination in infants and children. Verbal rhymes like Peter Piper picked... serve to increase both the oral and aural acuity of children. Songs and chants, accessing a different part of the brain, are used to memorize series (Alphabet song). They also provide the necessary beat to complex physical rhythms and movements, be it hand-clapping, jump roping, or ball bouncing. Furthermore, many physical games are used to develop strength, coordination and endurance of the players. For some team games, negotiations about the rules can run on longer than the game itself as social skills are rehearsed. Even as we are just now uncovering the neuroscience that undergirds the developmental function of this childlore, the artifacts themselves have been in play for centuries.

=== Folk history ===
A case has been made for considering folk history as a distinct sub-category of folklore, an idea that has received attention from such folklorists as Richard Dorson. This field of study is represented in &quot;The Folklore Historian&quot;, an annual journal sponsored by the History and Folklore Section of the American Folklore Society and concerned with the connections of folklore with history, as well as the history of folklore studies.

== Folklore performance in context ==
Lacking context, folklore artifacts would be uninspiring objects without any life of their own. It is only through performance that the artifacts come alive as an active and meaningful component of a social group; the intergroup communication arises in the performance and this is where transmission of these cultural elements takes place. American folklorist Roger D. Abrahams has described it thus: &quot;Folklore is folklore only when performed. As organized entities of performance, items of folklore have a sense of control inherent in them, a power that can be capitalized upon and enhanced through effective performance.&quot; Without transmission, these items are not folklore, they are just individual quirky tales and objects.

This understanding in folkloristics only occurred in the second half of the 20th century, when the two terms &quot;folklore performance&quot; and &quot;text and context&quot; dominated discussions among folklorists. These terms are not contradictory or even mutually exclusive. As borrowings from other fields of study, one or the other linguistic formulation is more appropriate to any given discussion. Performance is frequently tied to verbal and customary lore, whereas context is used in discussions of material lore. Both formulations offer different perspectives on the same folkloric understanding, specifically that folklore artifacts need to remain embedded in their cultural environment if we are to gain insight into their meaning for the community.

The concept of cultural (folklore) performance is shared with ethnography and anthropology among other social sciences. The cultural anthropologist Victor Turner identified four universal characteristics of cultural performance: playfulness, framing, the use of symbolic language, and employing the subjunctive mood. In viewing the performance, the audience leaves the daily reality to move into a mode of make-believe, or &quot;what if?&quot; It is self-evident that this fits well with all types of verbal lore, where reality has no place among the symbols, fantasies, and nonsense of traditional tales, proverbs, and jokes. Customs and the lore of children and games also fit easily into the language of a folklore performance.

Material culture requires some moulding to turn it into a performance. Should we consider the performance of the creation of the artifact, as in a quilting party, or the performance of the recipients who use the quilt to cover their marriage bed? Here the language of context works better to describe the quilting of patterns copied from the grandmother, quilting as a social event during the winter months, or the gifting of a quilt to signify the importance of the event. Each of these—the traditional pattern chosen, the social event, and the gifting—occur within the broader context of the community. Even so, when considering context, the structure and characteristics of performance can be recognized, including an audience, a framing event, and the use of decorative figures and symbols, all of which go beyond the utility of the object.

=== Backstory ===
Before the Second World War, folk artifacts had been understood and collected as cultural shards of an earlier time. They were considered individual vestigial artifacts, with little or no function in the contemporary culture. Given this understanding, the goal of the folklorist was to capture and document them before they disappeared. They were collected with no supporting data, bound in books, archived and classified more or less successfully. The Historic–Geographic Method worked to isolate and track these collected artifacts, mostly verbal lore, across space and time.

Following the Second World War, folklorists began to articulate a more holistic approach toward their subject matter. In tandem with the growing sophistication in the social sciences, attention was no longer limited to the isolated artifact, but extended to include the artifact embedded in an active cultural environment. One early proponent was Alan Dundes with his essay &quot;Texture, Text and Context&quot;, first published 1964. A public presentation in 1967 by Dan Ben-Amos at the American Folklore Society brought the behavioral approach into open debate among folklorists. In 1972 Richard Dorson called out the &quot;young Turks&quot; for their movement toward a behavioral approach to folklore. This approach &quot;shifted the conceptualization of folklore as an extractable item or &#x27;text&#x27; to an emphasis on folklore as a kind of human behavior and communication. Conceptualizing folklore as behavior redefined the job of folklorists...&quot;

Folklore became a verb, an action, something that people do, not just something that they have. It is in the performance and the active context that folklore artifacts get transmitted in informal, direct communication, either verbally or in demonstration. Performance includes all the different modes and manners in which this transmission occurs.

=== Tradition-bearer and audience ===

Transmission is a communicative process requiring a binary: one individual or group who actively transmits information in some form to another individual or group. Each of these is a defined role in the folklore process. The tradition-bearer is the individual who actively passes along the knowledge of an artifact; this can be either a mother singing a lullaby to her baby, or an Irish dance troupe performing at a local festival. They are named individuals, usually well known in the community as knowledgeable in their traditional lore. They are not the anonymous &quot;folk&quot;, the nameless mass without of history or individuality.

The audience of this performance is the other half in the transmission process; they listen, watch, and remember. Few of them will become active tradition-bearers; many more will be passive tradition-bearers who maintain a memory of this specific traditional artifact, in both its presentation and its content.

There is active communication between the audience and the performer. The performer is presenting to the audience; the audience in turn, through its actions and reactions, is actively communicating with the performer. The purpose of this performance is not to create something new but to re-create something that already exists; the performance is words and actions which are known, recognized and valued by both the performer and the audience. For folklore is first and foremost remembered behavior. As members of the same cultural reference group, they identify and value this performance as a piece of shared cultural knowledge.


=== Framing the performance ===
To initiate the performance, there must be a frame of some sort to indicate that what is to follow is indeed performance. The frame brackets it as outside of normal discourse. In customary lore such as life cycle celebrations (ex. birthday) or dance performances, the framing occurs as part of the event, frequently marked by location. The audience goes to the event location to participate. Games are defined primarily by rules, it is with the initiation of the rules that the game is framed. The folklorist Barre Toelken describes an evening spent in a Navaho family playing string figure games, with each of the members shifting from performer to audience as they create and display different figures to each other.

In verbal lore, the performer will start and end with recognized linguistic formulas. An easy example is seen in the common introduction to a joke: &quot;Have you heard the one...&quot;, &quot;Joke of the day...&quot;, or &quot;An elephant walks into a bar&quot;. Each of these signals to the listeners that the following is a joke, not to be taken literally. The joke is completed with the punch line of the joke. Another traditional narrative marker in English is the framing of a fairy tale between the phrases &quot;Once upon a time&quot; and &quot;They all lived happily ever after.&quot; Many languages have similar phrases which are used to frame a traditional tale. Each of these linguistic formulas removes the bracketed text from ordinary discourse, and marks it as a recognized form of stylized, formulaic communication for both the performer and the audience.

=== In the subjunctive voice ===
Framing as a narrative device serves to signal to both the story teller and the audience that the narrative which follows is indeed a fiction (verbal lore), and not to be understood as historical fact or reality. It moves the framed narration into the subjunctive mood, and marks a space in which &quot;fiction, history, story, tradition, art, teaching, all exist within the narrated or performed expressive &#x27;event&#x27; outside the normal realms and constraints of reality or time.&quot; This shift from the realis to the irrealis mood is understood by all participants within the reference group. It enables these fictional events to contain meaning for the group, and can lead to very real consequences.

=== Anderson&#x27;s law of auto-correction ===
The theory of self-correction in folklore transmission was first articulated by the folklorist Walter Anderson in the 1920s; this posits a feedback mechanism which would keep folklore variants closer to the original form. This theory addresses the question about how, with multiple performers and multiple audiences, the artifact maintains its identity across time and geography. Anderson credited the audience with censoring narrators who deviated too far from the known (traditional) text.

Any performance is a two-way communication process. The performer addresses the audience with words and actions; the audience in turn actively responds to the performer. If this performance deviates too far from audience expectations of the familiar folk artifact, they will respond with negative feedback. Wanting to avoid more negative reaction, the performer will adjust his performance to conform to audience expectations. &quot;Social reward by an audience [is] a major factor in motivating narrators...&quot; It is this dynamic feedback loop between performer and audience which gives stability to the text of the performance.

In reality, this model is not so simplistic; there are multiple redundancies in the active folklore process. The performer has heard the tale multiple times, he has heard it from different story tellers in multiple versions. In turn, he tells the tale multiple times to the same or a different audience, and they expect to hear the version they know. This expanded model of redundancy in a non-linear narrative process makes it difficult to innovate during any single performance; corrective feedback from the audience will be immediate. &quot;At the heart of both autopoetic self-maintenance and the &#x27;virality&#x27; of meme transmission... it is enough to assume that some sort of recursive action maintains a degree of integrity [of the artifact] in certain features ... sufficient to allow us to recognize it as an instance of its type.&quot;

=== Context of material lore ===
For material folk artifacts, it becomes more fruitful to return to the terminology of Alan Dundes: text and context. Here the text designates the physical artifact itself, the single item made by an individual for a specific purpose. The context is then unmasked by observation and questions concerning both its production and its usage. Why was it made, how was it made, who will use it, how will they use it, where did the raw materials come from, who designed it, etc. These questions are limited only by the skill of the interviewer.

In his study of southeastern Kentucky chair makers, Michael Owen Jones describes production of a chair within the context of the life of the craftsman. For Henry Glassie in his study of Folk Housing in Middle Virginia, the investigation concerns the historical pattern he finds repeated in the dwellings of this region: the house is planted in the landscape just as the landscape completes itself with the house. The artisan in his roadside stand or shop in the nearby town wants to make and display products which appeal to customers. There is &quot;a craftsperson&#x27;s eagerness to produce &#x27;satisfactory items&#x27; due to a close personal contact with the customer and expectations to serve the customer again.&quot; Here the role of consumer &quot;... is the basic force responsible for the continuity and discontinuity of behavior.&quot;

In material culture the context becomes the cultural environment in which the object is made (chair), used (house), and sold (wares). None of these artisans is &quot;anonymous&quot; folk; they are individuals making a living with the tools and skills learned within and valued in the context of their community.

=== Toelken&#x27;s conservative-dynamic continuum ===
No two performances are identical. The performer attempts to keep the performance within expectations, but this happens despite a multitude of changing variables. He has given this performance one time more or less, the audience is different, the social and political environment has changed. In the context of material culture, no two hand-crafted items are identical. Sometimes these deviations in the performance and the production are unintentional, just part of the process. But sometimes these deviations are intentional; the performer or artisan want to play with the boundaries of expectation and add their own creative touch. They perform within the tension of conserving the recognized form and adding innovation.

The folklorist Barre Toelken identifies this tension as &quot;a combination of both changing (&#x27;dynamic&#x27;) and static (&#x27;conservative&#x27;) elements that evolve and change through sharing, communication and performance.&quot; Over time, the cultural context shifts and morphs: new leaders, new technologies, new values, new awareness. As the context changes, so must the artifact, for without modifications to map existing artifacts into the evolving cultural landscape, they lose their meaning. Joking as an active form of verbal lore makes this tension visible as joke cycles come and go to reflect new issues of concern. Once an artifact is no longer applicable to the context, transmission becomes a nonstarter; it loses relevancy for a contemporary audience. If it is not transmitted, then it is no longer folklore and becomes instead an historic relic.

=== In the electronic age ===
Folklorists have begun to identify how the advent of electronic communications will modify and change the performance and transmission of folklore artifacts. It is clear that the internet is modifying folkloric process, not killing it, as despite the historic association between folklore and anti-modernity, people continue to use traditional expressive forms in new media, including the internet. Jokes and joking are as plentiful as ever both in traditional face-to-face interactions and through electronic transmission. New communication modes are also transforming traditional stories into many different configurations. The fairy tale Snow White is now offered in multiple media forms for both children and adults, including a television show and video game.

Yeh et al. (2023) suggest that user-generated content (UGC) should be considered as folklore, especially in mental health communities, because it conveys informal, unofficial knowledge through first-hand stories of treatment experiences. These narratives, often shared on YouTube, serve to educate and transmit culture, much like traditional folklore. They provide insight into mental health consumers&#x27; experiences with antidepressants, highlighting where they obtain information, gaps in their knowledge, and obstacles to seeking or continuing treatment. UGC in the form of YouTube reviews reflects dynamic, recurring expressions that function as a modern-day method of passing on informal knowledge.

<text>Fusion cuisine is a cuisine that combines elements of different culinary traditions that originate from different countries, regions, or cultures. Cuisines of this type are not categorized according to any one particular cuisine style and have played a part in many contemporary restaurant cuisines since the 1970s.

The term fusion cuisine, added to the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; in 2002, is defined as &quot;a style of cookery which blends ingredients and methods of preparation from different countries, regions, or ethnic groups; food cooked in this style.&quot;

==Categories==

Fusion food is created by combining various cooking techniques from different cultures to produce a new type of cuisine. Although it is commonly invented by chefs, fusion cuisine can occur naturally. Cuisines which get fused can either come from a particular region (such as East Asian cuisine and European cuisine), sub-region (such as Southwestern American cuisine and New Mexican cuisine) or a country (such as Chinese cuisine, Japanese cuisine, Korean cuisine, French cuisine, Italian cuisine).

Asian fusion restaurants which combine the various cuisines of different Asian countries have become popular in many parts of the United States, United Kingdom and Australia. Often featured are East Asian, Southeast Asian, and South Asian dishes alongside one another and offering dishes that are inspired combinations of such cuisines. California cuisine is considered a fusion culture, taking inspiration particularly from Italy, France, Mexico, the idea of the European delicatessen, and East Asia, and then creating traditional dishes from these cultures with non-traditional ingredients – such as California pizza. In Australia, due to immigration, fusion cuisine is being reinvented and is becoming increasingly the norm at numerous cafes and restaurants, with Asian-fusion restaurants like Tetsuya&#x27;s in Sydney ranking highly in The World&#x27;s 50 Best Restaurants.

In the United Kingdom, fish and chips can be seen as an early fusion dish due to its marrying of ingredients stemming from Jewish, French, and Belgian cuisines.

Filipino cuisine is sometimes characterized as the &quot;original Asian fusion cuisine&quot;, combining native culinary traditions and ingredients with the very different cuisines of China, Spain, Malaysia, Thailand and Mongolia, among others, due to its unique colonial history. Food in Malaysia (also Indonesia) is another example of fusion cuisine which blends Malay, Javanese, Chinese and Indian and light influences from Thai, Portuguese, Dutch, and British cuisines. Oceanic cuisine combines the different cuisines of the various island nations.

== Types ==
Another form of fusion food can be created by utilizing ingredients and flavors from one culture to create a unique twist on a dish from the different cultures. For example, a taco pizza is a type of pizza created using taco ingredients such as cheddar and pepper jack cheese, salsa, refried beans, and other common taco ingredients, fusing both Italian and Mexican cuisines.

Similar approaches have been used for fusion sushi, such as rolling maki with different types of rice and ingredients such as curry and basmati rice, cheese and salsa with Spanish rice, or spiced ground lamb and capers rolled with Greek-style rice and grape leaves, which resembles inside-out dolmades. Some fusion cuisines have themselves become accepted as a national cuisine, as with Peruvian Nikkei cuisine, which combines Japanese spices and seasonings and Peruvian ingredients like ají with seafood. A quintessential Peruvian Nikkei dish is &quot;maki acevichado&quot; or &quot;ceviche roll&quot;, consisting of ceviche with avocado rolled into maki.

Saudi Arabia has been investing in resources to preserve their culture. In Jeddah, different cultures from Africa and Asia have used the combination of Saudi Arabia&#x27;s spices to create new fusion foods found throughout the region and the country.

==History==
Fusion cuisine has existed for millennia as a form of cross-cultural exchange, though the term was only defined in the late 1900s. Mixtures of different cultures&#x27; cuisines have been adapted since the 16th century.

=== Colonialism ===
A lasting legacy of colonialism is fusion food. Colonial trade resulted in the exchange of ingredients, such as bánh mì originating from French ingredients used in French Indochina, Jamaican patties combining the turnover with spices and peppers from the British Empire&#x27;s possessions in Asia and Africa, and ramen originating as &quot;shina soba&quot; or &quot;Chinese noodle&quot; from the Empire of Japan&#x27;s occupation of China&#x27;s island territories in the late 1800s and early 1900s. Indigenous domestic servants were active participants in creating fusion foods by mixing ingredients and techniques.

Alongside the creation of new dishes, colonialism also introduced class dimensions of food as cultural capital that modified consumption patterns. Indigenous practices of eating guinea pigs in Peru were banned and considered savage until recent movements to reclaim food practices, resulting in the erasure of much traditional knowledge in indigenous communities. These hierarchies are argued to be present in modern fusion food, which has been criticised for being portrayed as European cuisines &#x27;elevating&#x27; other cuisines into modernity. Colonial debates also extend into discourse about the authenticity of foods such as the origins of Chicken tikka masala, and orientalist critiques of immigrant food being gentrified as ‘ethnic’ food.

=== Adaptation to local palates ===
In a climate of increasing globalization, where cultures and cuisines frequently cross-borders, cooking and food evolves to cater to the palates of the local communities, a phenomenon known as &quot;glocalization&quot;, a portmanteau of &quot;localization&quot; and &quot;globalization&quot;.” Fusion cuisine is sometimes created by multinational restaurants, especially fast food chains. A primary example of this corporate globalized expansion is in the case of McDonald&#x27;s regional menus which are adapted to &quot;reflect different tastes and local traditions for every country in which we have restaurants&quot;. In addition to catering to the regional food traditions, McDonald&#x27;s also takes an additional consideration for religious beliefs and laws, as seen in the absence of beef and pork items on Indian menus.

Beyond accounting for the cultural or religious differences in cuisine, some fusion foods have also been created to fit the taste preferences of local communities when ethnic or cultural foods from abroad were introduced. A hallmark example of this adaptation is in the popular sushi roll, the California roll, which was created in America in the latter half of the 20th-century. A popular myth behind its composition containing crab, vegetables, and rice on the exterior cites the American aversion to foreign ingredients such as raw fish and seaweed.

These adjustments to foreign cuisines have both corporate and historical origins. In the example of McDonald&#x27;s, the creation of regional menus can be seen as an economic choice to cater to the local palates and traditions. Another example of popularized fusion foods is the Korean stew &quot;budae-jjigae&quot;, which was created by combining American ingredients of Spam, Vienna sausages, and sliced cheese, in a &quot;kimchi stew&quot; in the wake of the Korean War during which American tastes and influence were prevalent in Korea.

=== Role of immigration ===
Immigrants play a significant role in shaping modern fusion cuisine.  Food can often be a form of cultural expression that fosters a relationship with one&#x27;s heritage, and fusion can emerge from creating foods from immigrant&#x27;s adaptation of their own cultural food to the ingredients available in the host country or region. Immigrants may adapt the use of their cultural ingredients to local culinary traditions. For example, Vietnamese immigrants in the Southern United States used Vietnamese condiments in traditionally Creole cuisine, while adhering to Southern cooking methods. Similarly, the establishment of American Chinese cuisine has origins in Chinese-owned small businesses in American ghettos and Chinatowns, with many of these restaurants responsible for the adaptation of Chinese cuisine to American paletes.

Immigrants may also adapt their cultural flavors to the availability of ingredients in the host country: Indian-Chinese cuisine shaped by Chinese immigrants to British-ruled India often uses Indian spice and flavor profiles such as garam masala and turmeric. As such, immigrant-founded fusion cuisines also play a role in shaping food culture in the host country by introducing new flavors and ingredients.

Indian-Chinese cuisine is an example of how gradual migration and exchange across shared international borders contributes to fusion cuisine. Similar cases are Sino-Korean food emerging from Chinese diasporas in Korea and shared borders between Korea and Northeastern China, and Mexican-American cuisine influenced by Mexican immigration to the Southwest United States that combines Mexican, Native American, and European flavors.  

The convergence of two or more immigrant groups in a different host country can also lead to the emergence of fusion cuisines. Chinese and Latin American immigrants to the United States have collaboratively founded fusion restaurants, serving dishes such as Chinese dumplings filled with traditional slow-roasted pork from the Yucatàn Peninsula. In the United States, Asian fusion cuisine can constitute pan-Asian multi-ethnic ingredients such as rice, leading to a newfound form of &quot;American&quot; Asian food unfound in Asia. One popular example of pan-Asian fusion food found in North America is the rice bowl, often with ingredients commonly used together in Asia such as garlic with chili, stir-fried vegetables with tofu. This illustrates the dynamic process between fusion food and its relationship with intercultural solidarity, influenced by both local and other immigrant cultures.

=== Modern fusion food ===
Japanese cooking techniques were combined with French techniques in 1970s France to create nouvelle cuisine.

Wolfgang Puck is attributed as one of the pioneers of fusion cuisine, with some dispute. However, his restaurant &quot;Chinois on Main&quot; was named after the term attributed to Richard Wing, who in the 1960s combined French and Chinese cooking at the former Imperial Dynasty restaurant in Hanford, California.

Chef Norman Van Aken was the first person to use the term &quot;fusion cooking&quot; as he delivered a speech at a symposium in Santa Fe in 1988. Soon journalist Regina Schrambling wrote about Van Aken&#x27;s work and the term spread around the globe. Norman Van Aken ended his speech by discussing the history of fusion cuisine, such as the use of coffee in Italian cuisine. Van Aken related this to coffee being used in different desserts such as Calabrian ricotta with chocolate mousse.

<doc id="11306" wikidata="Q1185775" url="?curid=11306" title="Frame problem">
<text>In artificial intelligence, with implications for cognitive science, the frame problem describes an issue with using first-order logic to express facts about a robot in the world. Representing the state of a robot with traditional first-order logic requires the use of many axioms that simply imply that things in the environment do not change arbitrarily. For example, Hayes describes a &quot;block world&quot; with rules about stacking blocks together. In a first-order logic system, additional axioms are required to make inferences about the environment (for example, that a block cannot change position unless it is physically moved). The frame problem is the problem of finding adequate collections of axioms for a viable description of a robot environment.

John McCarthy and Patrick J. Hayes defined this problem in their 1969 article, &quot;Some Philosophical Problems from the Standpoint of Artificial Intelligence&quot;. In this paper, and many that came after, the formal mathematical problem was a starting point for more general discussions of the difficulty of knowledge representation for artificial intelligence. Issues such as how to provide rational default assumptions and what humans consider common sense in a virtual environment.

In philosophy, the frame problem became more broadly construed in connection with the problem of limiting the beliefs that have to be updated in response to actions. In the logical context, actions are typically specified by what they change, with the implicit assumption that everything else (the frame) remains unchanged.

==Description==
The frame problem occurs even in very simple domains. A scenario with a door, which can be open or closed, and a light, which can be on or off, is statically represented by two propositions formula_1 and formula_2. If these conditions can change, they are better represented by two predicates formula_3 and formula_4 that depend on time; such predicates are called fluents. A domain in which the door is closed and the light off at time 0, and the door opened at time 1, can be directly represented in logic by the following formulae:

:formula_5
:formula_6
:formula_7

The first two formulae represent the initial situation; the third formula represents the effect of executing the action of opening the door at time 1. If such an action had preconditions, such as the door being unlocked, it would have been represented by formula_8. In practice, one would have a predicate formula_9 for specifying when an action is executed and a rule formula_10 for specifying the effects of actions. The article on the situation calculus gives more details.

While the three formulae above are a direct expression in logic of what is known, they do not suffice to correctly draw consequences. While the following conditions (representing the expected situation) are consistent with the three formulae above, they are not the only ones.

Indeed, another set of conditions that is consistent with the three formulae above is:

The frame problem is that specifying only which conditions are changed by the actions does not entail that all other conditions are not changed. This problem can be solved by adding the so-called “frame axioms”, which explicitly specify that all conditions not affected by actions are not changed while executing that action. For example, since the action executed at time 0 is that of opening the door, a frame axiom would state that the status of the light does not change from time 0 to time 1:

:formula_11

The frame problem is that one such frame axiom is necessary for every pair of action and condition such that the action does not affect the condition. In other words, the problem is that of formalizing a dynamical domain without explicitly specifying the frame axioms.

The solution proposed by McCarthy to solve this problem involves assuming that a minimal amount of condition changes have occurred; this solution is formalized using the framework of circumscription. The Yale shooting problem, however, shows that this solution is not always correct. Alternative solutions were then proposed, involving predicate completion, fluent occlusion, successor state axioms, etc.; they are explained below. By the end of the 1980s, the frame problem as defined by McCarthy and Hayes was solved. Even after that, however, the term “frame problem” was still used, in part to refer to the same problem but under different settings (e.g., concurrent actions), and in part to refer to the general problem of representing and reasoning with dynamical domains.

== Solutions ==
The following solutions depict how the frame problem is solved in various formalisms. The formalisms themselves are not presented in full: what is presented are simplified versions that are sufficient to explain the full solution.

===Fluent occlusion solution===
This solution was proposed by Erik Sandewall, who also defined a formal language for the specification of dynamical domains; therefore, such a domain can be first expressed in this language and then automatically translated into logic. In this article, only the expression in logic is shown, and only in the simplified language with no action names.

The rationale of this solution is to represent not only the value of conditions over time, but also whether they can be affected by the last executed action. The latter is represented by another condition, called occlusion. A condition is said to be &quot;occluded&quot; in a given time point if an action has been just executed that makes the condition true or false as an effect. Occlusion can be viewed as “permission to change”: if a condition is occluded, it is relieved from obeying the constraint of inertia.

In the simplified example of the door and the light, occlusion can be formalized by two predicates formula_12 and formula_13. The rationale is that a condition can change value only if the corresponding occlusion predicate is true at the next time point. In turn, the occlusion predicate is true only when an action affecting the condition is executed.

:formula_5
:formula_6
:formula_16
:formula_17
:formula_18

In general, every action making a condition true or false also makes the corresponding occlusion predicate true. In this case, formula_19 is true, making the antecedent of the fourth formula above false for formula_20; therefore, the constraint that formula_21 does not hold for formula_20. Therefore, formula_1 can change value, which is also what is enforced by the third formula.

In order for this condition to work, occlusion predicates have to be true only when they are made true as an effect of an action. This can be achieved either by circumscription or by predicate completion. It is worth noticing that occlusion does not necessarily imply a change: for example, executing the action of opening the door when it was already open (in the formalization above) makes the predicate formula_24 true and makes formula_1 true; however, formula_1 has not changed value, as it was true already.

===Predicate completion solution===
This encoding is similar to the fluent occlusion solution, but the additional predicates denote change, not permission to change. For example, formula_27 represents the fact that the predicate formula_1 will change from time formula_29 to formula_30. As a result, a predicate changes if and only if the corresponding change predicate is true. An action results in a change if and only if it makes true a condition that was previously false or vice versa.

:formula_5
:formula_6
:formula_33
:formula_34
:formula_35

The third formula is a different way of saying that opening the door causes the door to be opened. Precisely, it states that opening the door changes the state of the door if it had been previously closed. The last two conditions state that a condition changes value at time formula_29 if and only if the corresponding change predicate is true at time formula_29. To complete the solution, the time points in which the change predicates are true have to be as few as possible, and this can be done by applying predicate completion to the rules specifying the effects of actions.

===Successor state axioms solution===
The value of a condition after the execution of an action can be determined by
the fact that the condition is true if and only if:

# the action makes the condition true; or
# the condition was previously true and the action does not make it false.

A successor state axiom is a formalization in logic of these two facts. For
example, if formula_38 and formula_39 are two
conditions used to denote that the action executed at time formula_29 was
to open or close the door, respectively, the running example is encoded as
follows.

: formula_5
: formula_6
: formula_43
: formula_44

This solution is centered around the value of conditions, rather than the
effects of actions. In other words, there is an axiom for every condition,
rather than a formula for every action. Preconditions to actions (which are not
present in this example) are formalized by other formulae. The successor state
axioms are used in the variant to the situation calculus proposed by
Ray Reiter.

===Fluent calculus solution===
The fluent calculus is a variant of the situation calculus. It solves the frame problem by using first-order logic terms, rather than predicates, to represent the states. Converting predicates into terms in first-order logic is called reification; the fluent calculus can be seen as a logic in which predicates representing the state of conditions are reified.

The difference between a predicate and a term in first-order logic is that a term is a representation of an object (possibly a complex object composed of other objects), while a predicate represents a condition that can be true or false when evaluated over a given set of terms.

In the fluent calculus, each possible state is represented by a term obtained by composition of other terms, each one representing the conditions that are true in state. For example, the state in which the door is open and the light is on is represented by the term formula_45. It is important to notice that a term is not true or false by itself, as it is an object and not a condition. In other words, the term formula_45 represent a possible state, and does not by itself mean that this is the current state. A separate condition can be stated to specify that this is actually the state at a given time, e.g., formula_47 means that this is the state at time formula_48.

The solution to the frame problem given in the fluent calculus is to specify the effects of actions by stating how a term representing the state changes when the action is executed. For example, the action of opening the door at time 0 is represented by the formula:

: formula_49

The action of closing the door, which makes a condition false instead of true, is represented in a slightly different way:

: formula_50

This formula works provided that suitable axioms are given about formula_51 and formula_52, e.g., a term containing the same condition twice is not a valid state (for example, formula_53 is always false for every formula_54 and formula_29).

===Event calculus solution===
The event calculus uses terms for representing fluents, like the fluent calculus, but also has one or more axioms constraining the value of fluents, like the successor state axioms. There are many variants of the event calculus, but one of the simplest and most useful employs a single axiom to represent the law of inertia:

:formula_56
:formula_57
:formula_58

The axiom states that a fluent formula_59 holds at a time formula_60, if an event formula_61 happens and initiates formula_59 at an earlier time formula_63, and there is no event formula_64 that happens and terminates formula_59 after or at the same time as formula_63 and before formula_60.

To apply the event calculus to a particular problem domain, it is necessary to define the formula_68 and formula_69 predicates for that domain. For example:

:formula_70
:formula_71
:formula_72
:formula_73

To apply the event calculus to a particular problem in the domain, it is necessary to specify the events that happen in the context of the problem. For example:

: formula_74. 
: formula_75.

To solve a problem, such as &quot;which fluents hold at time 5?&quot;, it is necessary to pose the problem as a goal, such as:

:formula_76

In this case, obtaining the unique solution:

:formula_77

The event calculus solves the frame problem, eliminating undesired solutions, by using a non-monotonic logic, such as first-order logic with circumscription or by treating the event calculus as a logic program using negation as failure.

===Default logic solution===
The frame problem can be thought of as the problem of formalizing the principle that, by default, &quot;everything is presumed to remain in the state in which it is&quot; (Leibniz, &quot;An Introduction to a Secret Encyclopædia&quot;, &quot;c&quot;. 1679). This default, sometimes called the &quot;commonsense law of inertia&quot;, was expressed by Raymond Reiter in default logic:

: formula_78

(if formula_79 is true in situation formula_54, and it can be assumed that formula_79 remains true after executing action formula_82, then we can conclude that formula_79 remains true).

Steve Hanks and Drew McDermott argued, on the basis of their Yale shooting example, that this solution to the frame problem is unsatisfactory. Hudson Turner showed, however, that it works correctly in the presence of appropriate additional postulates.

===Answer set programming solution===
The counterpart of the default logic solution in the language of answer set programming is a rule with strong negation:

:formula_84

(if formula_85 is true at time formula_86, and it can be assumed that formula_85 remains true at time formula_88, then we can conclude that formula_85 remains true).

=== Separation logic solution ===
Separation logic is a formalism for reasoning about computer programs using pre/post specifications of the form formula_90. Separation logic is an extension of Hoare logic oriented to reasoning about mutable data structures in computer memory and other dynamic resources, and it has a special connective *, pronounced &quot;and separately&quot;, to support independent reasoning about disjoint memory regions.

Separation logic employs a &quot;tight&quot; interpretation of pre/post specs, which say that the code can &quot;only&quot; access memory locations guaranteed to exist by the precondition. This leads to the soundness of the most important inference rule of the logic, the &quot;frame rule&quot;

formula_91

The frame rule allows descriptions of arbitrary memory outside the footprint (memory accessed) of the code to be added to a specification: this enables the initial specification to concentrate only on the footprint. For example, the inference

formula_92

captures that code which sorts a list &quot;x&quot; does not unsort a separate list &quot;y,&quot; and it does this without mentioning &quot;y&quot; at all in the initial spec above the line.

Automation of the frame rule has led to significant increases in the scalability of automated reasoning techniques for code, eventually deployed industrially to codebases with tens of millions of lines.

There appears to be some similarity between the separation logic solution to the frame problem and that of the fluent calculus mentioned above.

===Action description languages===
Action description languages elude the frame problem rather than solving it. An action description language is a formal language with a syntax that is specific for describing situations and actions. For example, that the action formula_93 makes the door open if not locked is expressed by:

: formula_93 causes formula_1 if formula_96

The semantics of an action description language depends on what the language can express (concurrent actions, delayed effects, etc.) and is usually based on transition systems.

Since domains are expressed in these languages rather than directly in logic, the frame problem only arises when a specification given in an action description logic is to be translated into logic. Typically, however, a translation is given from these languages to answer set programming rather than first-order logic.

<text>Frans Eemil Sillanpää (; 16 September 1888 – 3 June 1964) was a Finnish writer. In 1939, he became the first Finnish writer to be awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature &quot;for his deep understanding of his country&#x27;s peasantry and the exquisite art with which he has portrayed their way of life and their relationship with Nature&quot;.

==Early life==
Frans Eemil Sillanpää was born into a peasant farming family in Hämeenkyrö. Although his parents were poor, they managed to send him to school in Tampere. At school Sillanpää was a good student and with aid from his benefactor Henrik Liljeroos he entered the University of Helsinki in 1908 to study medicine. His acquaintances at university included the painters Eero Järnefelt and Pekka Halonen, composer Jean Sibelius and author Juhani Aho.

==Career==
In 1913 Sillanpää moved from Helsinki to his old home village and devoted himself to writing. In 1914 Sillanpää wrote articles for the newspaper &quot;Uusi Suometar&quot;. In 1916 Sillanpää married Sigrid Maria Salomäki, whom he had met in 1914.

By principle, Sillanpää was against all forms of violence and believed in scientific optimism. In his work he portrayed rural people as living united with the land.

The novel &quot;Hurskas kurjuus&quot; (Meek Heritage) (1919) depicted the reasons for Finnish Civil War and was controversial at the time due to its objective approach.

Sillanpää won international fame for his novel &quot;Nuorena nukkunut&quot; (translated to English as &quot;The Maid Silja&quot;) in 1931.

In 1939, Sillanpää was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature &quot;for his deep understanding of his country&#x27;s peasantry and the exquisite art with which he has portrayed their way of life and their relationship with Nature.&quot; A few days after he received the prize, talks between Finland and Soviet Union broke down and the Winter War began. Sillanpää traveled to Stockholm to receive the Nobel Prize and donated the golden medal to be melted for funds to aid the war effort.

Before the Winter War, Sillanpää wrote the lyrics for &quot;Sillanpään marssilaulu&quot; to lift his spirits when his eldest son Esko was partaking in military practices at Karelian Isthmus.

In 1939, Sillanpää&#x27;s wife Sigrid died of pneumonia leaving him with eight children. Some time after, Sillanpää married his secretary Anna von Hertzen (1900–1983).

In 1941 Sillanpää divorced his wife Anna. His alcoholism and other ailments needed hospital treatment. In 1943 he returned to public life as a bearded old &#x27;Grandpa Sillanpää&#x27;. His radio appearances, especially his tradition of speaking on Christmas Eve from 1945 to 1963 attracted listeners.

The asteroid 1446 Sillanpää, discovered on January 26, 1938, by Finnish astronomer and physicist Yrjö Väisälä, was named after him.

==Death==
Sillanpää died on 3 June 1964 in Helsinki aged 75.

<text>Flambards is a novel for children or young adults by K. M. Peyton, first published by Oxford University Press in 1967 with illustrations by Victor Ambrus. Alternatively, &quot;Flambards&quot; is the trilogy (1967–1969) or series (1967–1981) named after its first book. The series is set in England just before, during, and after World War I.

The novel &quot;Flambards&quot; (book one) features a teenage orphan and heiress Christina Parsons, who comes to live at Flambards, the impoverished Essex estate owned by her crippled and tyrannical uncle, William Russell, and his two sons, Mark and Will.

== Novel summary ==

Christina Parsons, who has been shunted around the family since she was orphaned at the age of five years in 1901, is sent to live at Flambards with her mother&#x27;s half-brother, the crippled Russell. Her Aunt Grace speculates that Russell plans for Christina to marry his son Mark to restore Flambards to its former glory using the money that she will inherit on her twenty-first birthday. Mark is as brutish as his father, with a great love for hunting, whereas the younger son William is terrified of horses after a hunting accident and aspires to be an aviator. Christina soon develops a love for horses and hunting. She also finds friendship with the injured William, who challenges her ideas on class boundaries. William and Christina eventually fall in love and run away from the hunt ball to London, hoping to marry.

==Series==

The fourth book controversially reversed the ending of the original trilogy, twelve years later and following the television series.

* &quot;Flambards&quot; (Oxford, 1967)
* &quot;The Edge of the Cloud&quot; (Oxford, 1969)
* &quot;Flambards in Summer&quot; (Oxford, 1969)
* &quot;Flambards Divided&quot; (1981)

For &quot;The Edge of the Cloud&quot;, Peyton won the annual Carnegie Medal from the Library Association, recognising the year&#x27;s best children&#x27;s book by a British subject. She was a commended runner-up for both the first and third books, the latter in competition with her Medal-winning work.

She also won the 1970 Guardian Children&#x27;s Fiction Prize, conferred by &quot;The Guardian&quot; newspaper and judged by a panel of British children&#x27;s writers. Ordinarily the prize recognises one fiction book published during the preceding calendar year; exceptionally Peyton won for the Flambards trilogy completed in 1969.

The trilogy was adapted as a 13-part television series in 1979, &quot;Flambards&quot;, starring Christine McKenna as Christina Parsons.

World Publishing issued a US edition of the first book in 1968, retaining the Ambrus illustrations. World (Cleveland and New York) also published US editions of the second and third books in 1969 and 1970, also with the original illustrations, although all three novels were reset with a greater page-counts.

<doc id="11313" wikidata="Q1366945" url="?curid=11313" title="Father Ted">
<text>Father Ted is a sitcom created by Irish writers Graham Linehan and Arthur Mathews and produced by British production company Hat Trick Productions for British television channel Channel 4. It aired over three series from 21 April 1995 until 1 May 1998, including a Christmas special, for a total of 25 episodes. It aired on Nine Network (series 1) and ABC Television (series 2 and 3) in Australia, and on TV2 in New Zealand.

Set on the fictional Craggy Island, a remote location off Ireland&#x27;s west coast, &quot;Father Ted&quot; stars Dermot Morgan as Father Ted Crilly, alongside fellow priests Father Dougal McGuire (Ardal O&#x27;Hanlon) and Father Jack Hackett (Frank Kelly). Dishonourably exiled on the island by Bishop Leonard Brennan (Jim Norton) for various reasons, the priests live together in the parochial house with their housekeeper Mrs Doyle (Pauline McLynn). The show subverts parodies of low-brow humour as it portrays nuanced themes of loneliness, agnosticism, existentialism and purgatory experienced by its title character; this deeper meaning of the show has been much acclaimed.

&quot;Father Ted&quot; won several British Academy Television Awards—including twice for Best Comedy Series, and remains a popular sitcom in Ireland and the UK. In a 2001 Channel 4 poll, Dougal was ranked fifth on their list of the 100 Greatest TV Characters. In 2019, &quot;Father Ted&quot; was named the second-greatest British sitcom (after &quot;Fawlty Towers)&quot; by a panel of comedy experts for &quot;Radio Times&quot;.

==Synopsis==
The show follows the misadventures of three Irish Roman Catholic priests who live in a parish on the fictional Craggy Island, located off the west coast of Ireland. Father Ted Crilly, Father Dougal McGuire and Father Jack Hackett live chaotically together in Craggy Island&#x27;s parochial house, along with their housekeeper Mrs Doyle, who always wants to serve them tea.

The three priests answer to Bishop Len Brennan, who has banished them to Craggy Island as punishment for different incidents in their past: Ted for alleged financial impropriety (apparently involving some money &quot;resting&quot; in his account and a child being deprived of a visit to Lourdes so that Ted could go to Las Vegas), Dougal for an event only referred to as the &quot;Blackrock Incident&quot; (resulting in &quot;many nuns&#x27; lives [being] irreparably damaged&quot;), and Jack for his alcoholism and womanising, particularly for an unspecified incident at a wedding in Athlone.

The show revolves around the priests&#x27; lives on Craggy Island, sometimes dealing with matters of the church but more often dealing with Father Ted&#x27;s schemes to either resolve a situation with the parish or other Craggy Island residents, or to win games of one-upmanship against his enemy, Father Dick Byrne of the nearby Rugged Island parish.

==Episodes==

==Production==
===Writing===
Linehan and Mathews first met while working at &quot;Hot Press&quot;. In the late 1980s, Mathews, Paul Woodfull and Kieran Woodfull formed The Joshua Trio, a U2 tribute band. The trio began writing comedy sketches to accompany their act. Mathews created the Father Ted character for his short-lived stand-up routine. Before The Joshua Trio played at gigs, Mathews would occasionally come on-stage as Father Ted and tell jokes involving his great friend, Father Dougal McGuire.

In 1991, Mathews left his job at &quot;Hot Press&quot; and moved into Linehan&#x27;s London home. Over the next three to four years, they worked on rough ideas for shows while at the same time writing for sketch shows such as &quot;The All New Alexei Sayle Show&quot; and &quot;The Fast Show&quot;. One of these ideas was for a comedy mockumentary series called &quot;Irish Lives&quot;, with six episodes, each focusing on a different character living somewhere in Ireland. They scripted an episode centring on a priest named Father Ted Crilly, who visits his friends in the seminary in Maynooth College. Producer Geoffrey Perkins suggested that the episode&#x27;s concept be dramatised and rewritten as a sitcom.
In the January 1994 issue of &quot;In Dublin&quot; (Vol 19, No2), Mathews and Linehan told Damian Corless, who had initially introduced the pair to each other, of their work in progress, describing Ted as &quot;basically a nice man&quot;, Dougal as &quot;nice but really stupid&quot; and Jack as &quot;a hideous creature&quot;. Linehan revealed: &quot;They&#x27;ve all been sent to this isolated place called Craggy Island because they&#x27;re crap priests.&quot; Mathews elaborated: &quot;They&#x27;ve each a terrible secret which is why they&#x27;ve been banished to this place, and the terrible thing is that they can&#x27;t get away from each other. Obviously it&#x27;s not entirely reality-based.&quot; Mathews was originally intended to play Ted, but decided he lacked the acting ability the role required. Maurice O&#x27;Donoghue, who plays Father Dick in the series, was their second choice for the role of Ted, being the right age and having a similar look and lightness. Mathews always preferred Dermot Morgan; Linehan was initially reluctant, fearing he would play Ted the same as &quot;Father Trendy&quot;, a character he played on the RTÉ television show &quot;The Live Mike&quot;, but Morgan lobbied hard for the role and was cast.

The show was pitched directly to the UK&#x27;s Hat Trick Productions and Channel 4 by the duo, contrary to rumours that RTÉ (the Irish national broadcaster) were originally offered the series but rejected it.

===Recording===
Three series and one Christmas special were aired. Declan Lowney directed the first two series and the Christmas special, while the third series was directed by Linehan (location scenes) and Andy De Emmony (studio scenes). In addition, Morgan and O&#x27;Hanlon hosted an hour of Comic Relief in character, during which Kelly and McLynn also made brief guest appearances. One day after the shooting of series three wrapped, Dermot Morgan died of a heart attack, aged 45. As a mark of respect, the third series was first broadcast a week later than originally planned.

The show was already scheduled to conclude with the third series prior to Morgan&#x27;s death, as Morgan said that he did not want to continue playing the role of Father Ted for fear of being typecast: &quot;I don&#x27;t want to be the next Clive Dunn and end up playing the same character for years.&quot;

Following Morgan&#x27;s death, the production company received calls from numerous agents and casting directors suggesting either new actors for the role of Ted or spin-offs without the character; Linehan and Mathews declined all offers.

===Music===
In 1994, the writers asked alternative rock band Pulp to compose the theme music for &quot;Father Ted&quot;, requesting a parody of a typical sitcom theme. When Pulp said no, they contacted Neil Hannon, frontman of Northern Irish chamber pop band The Divine Comedy. Hannon&#x27;s first effort, a jaunty composition, was rejected on Geoffrey Perkins&#x27;s advice. Hannon composed a second theme, which the team found acceptable. This theme was recorded by Hannon and co-producer Darren Allison at The Jesus and Mary Chain&#x27;s private studio. One of William Reid&#x27;s guitars was selected by Allison and Hannon to carry the main tune, which was played by Hannon. Both themes were also reworked, with new lyrics, for inclusion on The Divine Comedy&#x27;s 1996 album &quot;Casanova&quot;: the final &quot;Father Ted&quot; theme became &quot;Songs of Love&quot;, while Hannon&#x27;s rejected theme became &quot;A Woman of the World&quot;.

In 2010, Linehan discussed the dramatic effect this choice had on the tone of the series: &quot;&#x27;Woman of the World&#x27; was kind of like a jaunty, plinky-plonky song, and we wanted that song. He [Hannon] gave us two choices: he gave us that, and &#x27;Songs of Love&#x27;, and we wanted the plinky-plonky song because our idea was we were making fun of sitcoms. We were saying, you know, we don&#x27;t like sitcoms. This is a parody of sitcoms. This is a kind of satire on sitcoms. And I remember Geoffrey [Perkins] looking really glum and sad about this, you know? And then he said, &#x27;Why do you want to make fun of your characters?&#x27; He said, &#x27;People will love these characters.&#x27; And that was just a real revelation for me, and after that, whatever he said went, as far as I was concerned.&quot;

The Divine Comedy also contributed most of the show&#x27;s original music, including the songs &quot;Big Men in Frocks&quot; (for the episode &quot;Rock-a-Hula Ted&quot;), &quot;My Lovely Horse&quot; and &quot;The Miracle is Mine&quot; (for &quot;A Song for Europe&quot;), and &quot;My Lovely Mayo Mammy&quot; (for &quot;Night of the Nearly Dead&quot;). Neil Hannon also provided Ted and Dougal&#x27;s vocals in the dream sequence version of &quot;My Lovely Horse&quot;, which was produced by Allison and Hannon, and later appeared as a B-side on the band&#x27;s single &quot;Gin Soaked Boy&quot;.

===Location===

The interior scenes were recorded at the London Studios in front of a live studio audience, while exterior filming was at various locations in Ireland. Location work for &quot;Father Ted&quot; was done mostly in County Clare, including locations at Corofin, Ennis, Kilfenora, Ennistymon, and Kilnaboy. The Parochial House is McCormack&#x27;s at Glenquin, on the Boston road from Kilnaboy. The cinema featured in &quot;The Passion of St Tibulus&quot; was the Ormonde Cinema, Greystones, County Wicklow and &quot;The Field&quot;, the location for Funland in &quot;&#x27;Good Luck, Father Ted&#x27;&quot;, is in Portrane, North County Dublin. The &#x27;Very Dark Caves&#x27; featured in &quot;The Mainland&quot; were the Aillwee caves in the Burren, County Clare.

Some exterior shots for the episode &quot;And God Created Woman&quot; were filmed in Dún Laoghaire, South County Dublin. The opening sequence (including shots of the &quot;Plassy&quot; shipwreck) were filmed over Inisheer — the smallest of the Aran Islands.

==Comedic style==
The series is set in a humorously surreal world in which Ted is the only fully rounded normal character among &quot;caricatures&quot;, according to Graham Linehan: &quot;exaggerated-over-friendly, over-quiet, over-stupid, over-dull [...] they really only got one thing, they&#x27;ve got one job.&quot;

Embarrassment plays a role in many storylines, in a similar fashion to &quot;Fawlty Towers&quot;. Linehan says, &quot;if Ted is in a situation that is slightly embarrassing we get him out of it [...] by having him lying or cheating, basically digging a massive hole for himself&quot;. Arthur Mathews has described &quot;Seinfeld&quot; as a major influence on the comedy of &quot;Father Ted&quot;, with himself and Linehan being &quot;big fans&quot; of the show. &quot;Father Ted&quot; also contains references to pop culture, and some film parodies, such as the episode &quot;Speed 3&quot;. An avid fan of Monty Python growing up, Linehan cited the ineffectual protest of &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Life of Brian&quot; upon its release in 1979 as an influence for the &quot;Father Ted&quot; episode &quot;The Passion of Saint Tibulus&quot;.

Regarding the series&#x27;s religious content, Linehan says &quot;Ted doesn&#x27;t have an anti-religious view of life, but a non-religious view. It&#x27;s a job to him. He doesn&#x27;t care about religion.&quot; While writing, he says the show&#x27;s creators imagined Ted and Dougal as &quot;just two people who happen to be [priests]&quot;.

==Reception==
&quot;Father Ted&quot; was met with critical acclaim and is the most popular sitcom in Irish TV history. The Irish media frequently uses the series as a point of comparison in political stories.

In 1996 and 1999, the show won the BAFTA award for Best Comedy, while Morgan also won Best Comedy Performance. In 1995 the show won Best New TV Comedy at the British Comedy Awards, with O&#x27;Hanlon receiving Top TV Comedy Newcomer Award. At the 1996 British Comedy Awards the show won Top Channel 4 Sitcom Award, McLynn took the Top TV Comedy Actress award. In 1997 the show was given the Best Channel 4 Sitcom Award. It was also ranked at number 50 in the BFI&#x27;s 2000 list of the 100 greatest British television programmes of the 20th century, the highest ranking Channel 4 production on the list. In 2004, it came 11th in the poll for Britain&#x27;s Best Sitcom. In August 2012, Channel 4 viewers voted the series as the No 1 in &quot;C4&#x27;s 30 Greatest Comedy Shows&quot;.

Notable fans of the show include director Steven Spielberg, musicians Liam Gallagher, Madonna, Cher and Moby, actors Jim Carrey and Steve Martin, comedian Ricky Gervais, and wrestler Sheamus. Maurice Gibb of the Bee Gees was buried with a copy of the DVD box set. Singer-songwriter Sinéad O&#x27;Connor was a fan, and attended the recording of the Christmas special. Irish musician Bono also requested to appear in the series.

In January 2007, a dispute arose between Inisheer and Inishmore over which island can claim to be Craggy Island, and thereby host a three-day Friends of Ted Festival. The dispute was settled by a five-a-side football match that February. Inishmore won 2–0 allowing them to use the title of Craggy Island until February 2008, while Inisheer was given the title of Rugged Island. The Friends of Ted Festival, better known as Ted Fest, has been held annually as a &quot;Father Ted&quot; fan convention since 2007.

In August 2020 An Post released a set of commemorative postage stamps, each with a catchphrase from the series on a background of the parochial house&#x27;s lurid wallpaper, in a booklet listing Mrs Doyle&#x27;s guesses for the name of Father Todd Unctious.

Several quotes from the series have entered the popular lexicon, such as: &quot;These are &quot;small&quot;, but the ones out there are &quot;far away&quot;. Small. Far away.&quot;, &quot;Down with this sort of thing&quot;, &quot;Careful now&quot;, &quot;That would be an ecumenical matter&quot; and &quot;I hear you&#x27;re a racist now, Father&quot;.

==Derivatives==
On 1 January 2011, Channel 4 dedicated a night of programmes to celebrate the show&#x27;s 15th anniversary year. This included &quot;Father Ted: Unintelligent Design&quot;, a documentary on the show&#x27;s influences, and &quot;Small, Far Away: The World of Father Ted&quot;, a documentary revisiting the show&#x27;s history with the writers and many of the surviving cast (Pauline McLynn was unable to take part as she was working in another country).

===Roles reprised===
In 2001, Pauline McLynn reprised her role as Mrs Doyle in a run of advertisements for the UK&#x27;s Inland Revenue, reminding people to get their taxes in on time with her catchphrase from the programme (&quot;Go on, go on, go on...&quot;). It was voted in an Adwatch poll of 1,000 people as the year&#x27;s worst advertisement.

Later in 2001, Ardal O&#x27;Hanlon returned to the role of Father Dougal for a series of PBS advertisements to coincide with &quot;Father Ted&quot;″s American broadcast; these segments were included on later DVD releases as &quot;Fundraising with Father Dougal&quot;.

In 2012, Frank Kelly made a brief appearance as Father Jack on an episode of &quot;The One Show&quot; with Graham Norton.

In 2014, guest star Ben Keaton returned to the role of Father Austin Purcell, performing a stand-up routine and hosting the pub quiz &quot;Arse Biscuits&quot; in-character. In 2015, he launched the spin-off web series &quot;Cook Like a Priest&quot;.

In February 2016, Over The Top Wrestling marked the anniversary of Morgan&#x27;s death with &quot;Ah Ted&quot;, an event held in Dublin&#x27;s Tivoli Variety Theatre. During the main-event tag-team match between The Lads From the Flats and The Kings of the North, Patrick McDonnell, Joe Rooney and Michael Redmond reprised their roles as Eoin McLove, Father Damo Lennon and Father Paul Stone respectively. McLove entered the ring first, withstanding one wrestler&#x27;s attack on his crotch because he has &quot;no willy&quot;, but was soon attacked by Father Damo, who brought the whistle he stole from Benson. Father Stone served as a special guest referee, performing a three-count so slow that one wrestler kicked out after two. In 2017, Rooney appeared as Father Damo in the video for Brave Giant&#x27;s &quot;The Time I Met the Devil&quot;, which follows him on the way to give Mass after a night of alcohol and sex.

===Potential remakes===
Since the end of the series, several attempts to remake &quot;Father Ted&quot; have been reported, but none has yet materialised.

In July 2003, it was announced that the show would be remade for the American market. The remake would be scripted by Spike Feresten, who previously wrote for US sitcoms &quot;Seinfeld&quot; and &quot;The Simpsons&quot;. Ferensten stated: &quot;I was raised Catholic and this show just felt right to me. The essence of the show is about men who are also priests and, as men, they have many foibles.&quot; Hat Trick founders Denise O&#x27;Donoghue and Jimmy Mulville were set to produce. The US production company was Pariah Productions, which previously adapted &quot;The Kumars at No. 42&quot; for an American audience.

In March 2004, Supanet Limited reported that an American remake was in development. This version would be set on a fictional island off the coast of New York. Steve Martin and Graham Norton would reportedly play Ted and Dougal. Martin had not been expected to take the role because of his stature, but agreed because he was a fan of the original series, and would reportedly be paid £500,000 per episode. Norton was cast based on his popularity with American audiences, and in reference to his appearance as Father Noel Furlong in the original series.

In November 2007, a separate American remake was announced. Rather than Craggy Island, this version would be set in an unfortunate fishing village in New England. American actor John Michael Higgins was cast as Ted, but expressed concerns about the show&#x27;s religious themes: &quot;The English have a very robust history of being unkind about religion. We don&#x27;t have that in our country, we&#x27;re frightened of it. It&#x27;s basically that you guys are doing an Irish joke also, we don&#x27;t have that. So I&#x27;ll be Father Ted, we&#x27;ll see how it goes.&quot; Filming was scheduled to begin in January 2008.

In January 2015, Linehan said that there had been &quot;a few attempts&quot; by US broadcasters to remake the show, including one which would have been set in Boston – an idea Linehan considered &quot;ridiculous&quot;.

===Musical===
In an interview with &quot;Radio Times&quot; in January 2015, Linehan said that he wanted to revive &quot;Father Ted&quot; as a musical stage production. He stated that he would never revive the television series, &quot;because of the risk you poison people&#x27;s memories of the original&quot;, but that the completely new format would make the project worthwhile. He mentioned the possibility of a dance number with &quot;spinning cardinals&quot;. He said that the musical would have to reference the Catholic child abuse scandals, saying, &quot;The jokes would have to have a little bit more edge, because you just can&#x27;t ignore this stuff.&quot; Mathews was &quot;not as convinced&quot; of the musical idea, though Linehan insisted it could work.

In December, Mathews said that he and Paul Woodfull were developing a Joshua Trio musical and a show focusing on a &quot;Father Michael Cleary-type character&quot;, and that the &quot;Father Ted&quot; musical may follow. He expressed concerns that it would &quot;dilute the product&quot; or be seen as a &quot;cash-in&quot;, but said that he believed there was an audience for the project. In April 2017, Linehan said that the musical would draw inspiration from &quot;The Book of Mormon&quot;, and would &quot;go for the jugular ... You get all the things people loved about it, all the innocence and all the sweetness, but introduce a harder edge.&quot; Linehan also said that, being a special event, the musical would need to focus on a &quot;world-shaking&quot; story, possibly with Ted becoming Pope due to &quot;some weird succession thing&quot;.

In June 2018, Linehan announced that &quot;Pope Ted: The Father Ted Musical&quot; was nearing completion, with a script by Linehan and Mathews. Linehan said, &quot;It&#x27;s the real final episode of &quot;Father Ted ...&quot; This was the right idea. Arthur and I have been laughing our arses off while writing it. Just like the old days.&quot; The Divine Comedy frontman Neil Hannon, who wrote the television show&#x27;s music, composed the music.

In March 2022, Linehan said the musical had been cancelled by producers following the controversy over his public statements about transgender rights. He said that the musical was &quot;ready to go&quot;, with a completed story and songs, but &quot;just because a group of people have decided that anybody who speaks up against this ideology is evil, [the producers have] just kind of rolled over for those people. No one is standing up for me.&quot; Hannon, a longtime friend of Linehan&#x27;s, said the project was difficult and said about the controversy around Linehan: &quot;It&#x27;s been difficult to watch what&#x27;s happened. I believe in free speech, but I also very much believe in people&#x27;s perfect right to remain completely silent on issues that they don&#x27;t feel they can speak on. And that&#x27;s all I want to say about it.&quot;

In December 2020, Linehan said he was seeking legal advice regarding Hat Trick Productions who he argued were preventing the musical from going into production owing to &quot;activists&quot; within the company.

<doc id="11314" wikidata="Q1423785" url="?curid=11314" title="Foster's Lager">
<text>Foster&#x27;s Lager is an internationally distributed brand of Australian lager. It is owned by the Japanese brewing group Asahi Group Holdings, and is brewed under licence in a number of countries, including its biggest market, the UK, where the European rights to the brand are owned by Heineken International.

While Foster&#x27;s is the largest-selling Australian beer brand in the world, it is not as popular and relatively rare compared with other beers in Australia, particularly when compared to current Carlton &amp; United Breweries beers such as Victoria Bitter and Carlton Draught.

==History==
Foster&#x27;s was created by two American brothers, William M. and Ralph R. Foster, who arrived in Melbourne from New York in 1886. The brothers began brewing Foster&#x27;s Lager in November 1888. It was made available to the public from February 1889. The product was first exported in 1901, when bottles were sent to Australian combatants in the Boer War.

In 1907, the company merged with five other brewing companies to form Carlton &amp; United Breweries (CUB). Then only available in bottles, Foster&#x27;s Lager was considered to be CUB&#x27;s premium brand.

In 1958, steel cans were introduced. Foster&#x27;s Lager was first imported into the UK in 1971, and was launched in the US in 1972.

Commencing 1981, the brand was brewed under licence in the UK by Watney Mann and Truman Brewers. In 1986, Courage Brewery obtained the rights to brew and distribute Foster&#x27;s alongside Watney Mann and Truman Brewers, which Courage took over in 1990.

In 2011, CUB and its product lines, including Foster&#x27;s, were bought by the South African and British conglomerate SABMiller, which in turn was incorporated into the multinational (Belgian, Brazilian, and American) Anheuser-Busch InBev in 2016. In 2019, Anheuser-Busch InBev agreed to sell CUB including Fosters to Asahi Breweries. The deal was completed in 2020.

==Production==
Advertising from the early 20th century claimed Foster&#x27;s Lager was adjuncted with cane sugar. A number of breweries advertised a sugar content, (e.g. Bulimba), as it implied a lighter less bitter brew than was commonly sold. (Rice malt and very light barley malts replaced sugar, which can be troublesome for brewers.)

The Tim Foster&#x27;s yeast in use today was brought to Carlton in 1923 from Professor Jorgensen in Denmark.

The lager is hopped with selected oil extracts of Super Pride of Ringwood hops, which like any modern beer, is added after fermentation to minimise losses to the yeast sediment. The hop is sourced from the only two farms in Australia that grow it.

The product is 4% ABV in Europe, Australia and India, and 5% in the US.

The Latin American and European rights to the beer are owned by Heineken International, who brews and distributes a 4% ABV Foster&#x27;s in most European countries. In the United States and Canada, rights to the brand are owned by Molson Coors. Heineken also acquired Brasil Kirin which previously had the right to the beer in Latin America.

In the UK, Foster&#x27;s is produced by Heineken at the Royal Brewery in Manchester.

Production of the Australian regular brand recommenced in 2014, but it was only briefly promoted. It had been in continuous production from November 1888 to about 2002, making it the longest-lived beer label in Australia. Once a &quot;premium&quot; brand, Foster&#x27;s Lager has been bypassed by the Foster&#x27;s Group&#x27;s favoured premium brands of Carlton Crown Lager and Stella Artois.

In Australia until the end of the 1970s, Foster&#x27;s Lager was a reasonably popular bottled and canned beer with a somewhat premium image. In the early 1980s there were major changes in the Australian brewing industry, including the merger of Castlemaine (Brisbane), Swan (Perth) and Toohey&#x27;s (Sydney) into a national brewing group, as a result of acquisitions by Perth entrepreneur Alan Bond.

Faced with inroads into its non-Victorian markets, Carlton and United Beverages (CUB) reviewed its product range and attempted to re-position some of its brands. Foster&#x27;s Draught was introduced, served on tap alongside established draught brands such as Castlemaine XXXX and Toohey&#x27;s Draught. Despite some initial success, bolstered by heavy advertising, the brand did not prove to be popular and was eventually withdrawn from sale.

The Foster&#x27;s Group has tended to promote the brands of Carlton Draught (mainstream market) and Victoria Bitter (working class male market).

The CUB Yatala Road Brewery south of Brisbane, the site of the former Power&#x27;s Brewery, brews all CUB mainstream and contract beers that are sold outside of Victoria. The Yatala Brewery is the largest in the Southern Hemisphere. CUB&#x27;s Abbotsford Brewery (Abbot&#x27;s Lager) now only supplies Victoria and South Australia. The Victoria (Vic Bitter) and Carlton (Carlton Draft) breweries were closed in the late 20th century and the CUB headquarters moved to Abbotsford. 

In late 2014 Foster&#x27;s enjoyed some renewed success in the Australian market, due to returning to wide-release sale in Australian liquor stores with some renewed nostalgic brand recognition. Foster&#x27;s lager was marketed as &quot;Foster&#x27;s Classic&quot; and sold in 375ml cans with 4.0% ABV.

In November 2020, CUB announced that it would &quot;relaunch&quot; the brand in Australia, boosting local production by 300% and price it competitively against rival brands.

In Australia in 2024 CUB decided not to produce the original Foster&#x27;s Lager 4.9% version. It has been replaced by Foster&#x27;s Classic 4.0% version.

==Global market==
In April 2006, Scottish &amp; Newcastle plc announced that it had agreed to acquire the Foster&#x27;s brand in Europe (including Turkey), the Russian Federation and other countries in the Commonwealth of Independent States for approximately £309 million. In August 2006, SABMiller, now owned by AB InBev, announced that it had bought back rights to the Foster&#x27;s brand in India for a reported $120m from private investors.

An unusual case emerged in 2015 when a New York consumer of Foster&#x27;s Lager sued the brewer after – he claimed – discovering it was not brewed in Australia. He proposed a class action on the grounds of deceptive marketing. The suit cited advertising slogans such as &#x27;Foster&#x27;s Australian for Beer&#x27; and &#x27;How to Speak Australian&#x27; were intended to trick consumers into believing the beer is made in Australia – which in turn meant the beer could be sold at a higher, premium price.

A number of companies own marketing rights to Foster&#x27;s including Heineken International in Latin America, Europe and CIS and Molson Coors in the U.S. and Canada.

==Variants==
Scottish &amp; Newcastle launched Foster&#x27;s Twist, a beer with a hint of citrus that was marketed as a refreshing alternative to other heavier beers and Premium Packaged Spirits such as Smirnoff Ice. Foster&#x27;s Twist was 4.5% abv. It has since been withdrawn from the market.

There also exists Foster&#x27;s Super Chilled, which is served at a colder temperature and is available in pubs and bars.

In 2008, Foster&#x27;s was introduced with a widget called a &quot;scuba&quot; placed into the can to ensure good mixing. This variant is only currently available in the UK.

In the UK, customers are also able to purchase a keg of Foster&#x27;s for private parties, collecting and returning the keg at a participating store or public house.

Also, there is Fosters Gold which has a slightly higher alcohol percentage of 4.5% sold only in bottles.

==Sponsorship==
From 1964, the brand was promoted in the UK by comedian Barry Humphries and his &quot;Private Eye&quot; character Barry McKenzie, a bumbling Foster&#x27;s swilling Australian expatriate.

Foster&#x27;s Lager used the slogan &quot;The Amber Nectar&quot; in Australia and the UK, and &quot;Australian for Beer&quot;, elsewhere overseas. The overseas advertising of the product often focuses on the Australian connotations of the beer, e.g. with reference to stereotypical Australian imagery such as kangaroos, exaggerated accents, and cork hats. This was true of a campaign in the 1980s fronted by the Australian comedian Paul Hogan.

The 2009 campaign for Foster&#x27;s contains two 40-second adverts, &quot;Backpacker&quot; and &quot;Deep Sea&quot;; both end with the slogan, &quot;Foster&#x27;s – get some Australian in you.&quot;

The Foster&#x27;s Lager brand was used as an advertising sponsorship deal with Norwich City F.C. from 1986 to 1989 (a period which included two top five finishes and a run to the FA Cup semi-finals). At its commencement, the sponsorship by Foster&#x27;s was the most lucrative sponsorship ever given to an English football club.

The brand sponsored Formula One events regularly from 1986 to 2006. During this period it was the title sponsor for the Australian GP (1986–1993 and 2002–2006), the British GP (1990–1993 and 2000–2006) and the San Marino GP (2003–2006). It also was the prime sponsor and trackside sponsor of many other Grands Prix during this time. The brand was also used in a sponsorship deal with the A1 Team Australia from 2005 to 2007.

The UK division of the Foster&#x27;s brand has focused on cultivating comedy-centric advertising and sponsorship arrangements and on 9 November 2011 they launched a trailer for their sponsored, online-only version of the hit 90s&#x27; television show &quot;The Fast Show&quot;. The six weekly episodes started on 10 November and featured the original cast (with the exception of Mark Williams) and many of the characters from the previous series.

From 2010 to 2015 Foster&#x27;s adverts featured &quot;Good call&quot;, in which numerous Britons phone up Australians Brad and Dan for general advice. The campaign was revived in 2019.

<doc id="11315" wikidata="Q79784" url="?curid=11315" title="Friends">
<text>Friends is an American television sitcom created by David Crane and Marta Kauffman, which aired on NBC from September 22, 1994, to May 6, 2004, lasting ten seasons. With an ensemble cast starring Jennifer Aniston, Courteney Cox, Lisa Kudrow, Matt LeBlanc, Matthew Perry and David Schwimmer, the show revolves around six friends in their 20s and early 30s who live in Manhattan, New York City. The original executive producers were Kevin S. Bright, Kauffman, and David Crane.

Kauffman and Crane began developing &quot;Friends&quot; under the working title &quot;Insomnia Cafe&quot; between November and December 1993. They presented the idea to Bright, and together they pitched a seven-page treatment of the show to NBC. After several script rewrites and changes, including title changes to &quot;Six of One&quot; and &quot;Friends Like Us&quot;, the series was finally named &quot;Friends&quot;. Filming took place at Warner Bros. Studios in Burbank, California. The series was produced by Bright/Kauffman/Crane Productions and Warner Bros. Television.

The show ranked within the top ten of the final television season ratings; it ultimately reached the number-one spot in its eighth season. The series finale aired on May 6, 2004, and was watched by around 52.5 million American viewers, making it the fifth-most-watched series finale in television history and the most-watched television episode of the 2000s. &quot;Friends&quot; received acclaim throughout its run, becoming one of the most popular television shows of all time. It is also one of the most successful and highest-grossing television shows of all time, having grossed an estimated $1.4 billion since its debut. The series was nominated for 62 Primetime Emmy Awards, winning the Outstanding Comedy Series award in 2002 for its eighth season. The show ranked 21 on &quot;TV Guide&quot;″s 50 Greatest TV Shows of All Time, 29 on &quot;Variety&quot; magazine&#x27;s The 100 Greatest TV Shows of All Time, and 5 on &quot;Empire&quot; magazine&#x27;s The 50 Greatest TV Shows of All Time. In 1997, the episode &quot;The One with the Prom Video&quot; was ranked 100 on &quot;TV Guide&quot;″s 100 Greatest Episodes of All-Time. In 2013, &quot;Friends&quot; ranked 24 on the Writers Guild of America&#x27;s 101 Best Written TV Series of All Time, and 28 on &quot;TV Guide&quot;″s 60 Best TV Series of All Time. The sitcom&#x27;s cast members returned for &quot;&quot;, a reunion special which was released on HBO Max on May 27, 2021.

== Cast and characters ==


* Jennifer Aniston as Rachel Green: A fashion enthusiast and Monica Geller&#x27;s best friend from childhood. Rachel first moves in with Monica in season one after nearly marrying Barry Farber. Rachel and Ross Geller are later involved in an on-again, off-again relationship throughout the series. Rachel dates other men during the series, such as Italian neighbor, Paolo, in season one; Joshua Bergin, a client from Bloomingdale&#x27;s, in season four; Tag Jones, her assistant, in season seven; and Joey Tribbiani, one of her close friends, in season ten. Rachel&#x27;s first job is as a waitress at the coffee house Central Perk, but she later becomes an assistant buyer at Bloomingdale&#x27;s in season three, and a buyer at Ralph Lauren in season five. Rachel and Ross have a daughter named Emma Geller-Green in &quot;The One Where Rachel Has a Baby, Part Two&quot; at the end of season eight. In the final episode of the series, Ross and Rachel confess their love for each other, and Rachel gives up a dream fashion job at Louis Vuitton in Paris to be with him. Despite her friendliness, she is often self-centered and refuses to take responsibility for her actions.
* Courteney Cox as Monica Geller: The &quot;mother hen&quot; of the group and a chef, known for her perfectionist, bossy, competitive, and obsessive-compulsive nature. Monica was overweight as a child. She works as a chef in various restaurants throughout the show. Monica&#x27;s first serious relationship is with a long-time family friend Richard Burke, who is 21 years her senior. The two maintain a strong relationship for some time until Richard expresses that he does not want to have children. Monica and Chandler Bing, one of her best friends, later start a relationship after spending a night with each other in London in the season four finale, leading to their marriage in season seven and the adoption of twins Jack and Erica Bing at the end of the series. A running gag in the show is Chandler&#x27;s easy-going and humorous nature conflicting with Monica&#x27;s high-maintenance and compulsive behavior.
* Lisa Kudrow as Phoebe Buffay: A masseuse and self-taught musician. Phoebe is often the most aloof member of the group as a hippy. As a child, Phoebe lived in upstate New York with her mother Lily Buffay, until her mother committed suicide and Phoebe took to the streets. She writes and sings her own strange songs, accompanying herself on the guitar. She has an identical twin named Ursula Buffay, who shares few of Phoebe&#x27;s traits. Phoebe has three serious relationships over the show&#x27;s run: David, a scientist, in season one, with whom she breaks up when he moves to Minsk on a research grant; Gary, a police officer whose badge she finds, in season five; and an on-and-off relationship with Mike Hannigan in seasons nine and ten. In season nine, Phoebe and Mike break up due to his desire not to marry. David returns from Minsk, leading to the two getting back together, but she eventually rejects him for Mike when both of them propose to her. Phoebe and Mike marry in season ten.
* Matt LeBlanc as Joey Tribbiani: A struggling actor and food lover who becomes famous for his role on soap opera &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot; as Dr. Drake Ramoray. Joey has many short-term girlfriends. Despite his womanizing and his dim-witted, often ignorant, behavior, Joey is innocent and well-intentioned. Joey often uses the catchphrase pick-up line &quot;How &quot;you&quot; doin&#x27;?&quot; in his attempts to win over most of the women he meets. Joey rooms with his best friend Chandler for years, and later with Rachel. He falls in love with Rachel in season eight, but Rachel politely tells Joey that she does not share his feelings. They eventually date briefly in season ten, but after realizing it will not work due to their friendship and Rachel&#x27;s complicated relationship with Ross, they return to being friends. At the end of the series, he is the only remaining single member of the group, and becomes the main protagonist of the sequel series &quot;Joey&quot;.
* Matthew Perry as Chandler Bing: An executive in statistical analysis and data reconfiguration for a large multinational corporation. Chandler hates this job, although it pays well. He attempts to quit during season one but is lured back with a new office and a pay raise. He eventually quits this job in season nine due to a transfer to Tulsa, Oklahoma. He becomes a junior copywriter at an advertising agency later that season. Chandler has a peculiar family history, being the son of an erotic novelist mother Nora Tyler Bing and a gay, cross-dressing Las Vegas star father Charles Bing. Chandler is known for his sarcastic sense of humor, bad luck in relationships, and tendency to be the butt of all jokes. Despite this, he is still kind and usually serves as the voice of reason in contrast to his more arrogant and selfish friends. Chandler marries Monica, one of his best friends, in season seven, and they adopt twins at the end of the series. Before his relationship with Monica, Chandler dated Janice Hosenstein in season one and subsequently broke up with her many times.
* David Schwimmer as Ross Geller: Monica&#x27;s &quot;geeky&quot; older brother, a PhD-carrying palaeontologist working at the American Museum of Natural History, and later a tenured professor of palaeontology at New York University. Ross is involved in an on-again, off-again relationship with Rachel throughout the series. He has three failed marriages during the series: Carol Willick, a lesbian who is also the mother of his son, Ben Geller; Emily Waltham, who divorces him after he accidentally says Rachel&#x27;s name instead of hers during their wedding vows; and Rachel, as the two drunkenly marry in Las Vegas. His divorces become a running joke within the series. Following a one-night stand, he and Rachel have a daughter, Emma, by the end of season eight. They finally confess that they are still in love with each other in the series finale.

James Michael Tyler appears as Gunther, a barista at Central Perk, in every season of the show, but is only ever credited as a guest star. Gunther has a mostly secret profound love for Rachel throughout the entire series. At one point he becomes the manager of the coffee house. It is revealed that Gunther speaks Dutch in addition to English, as well as being a former soap opera actor.

In their original contracts for the first season, cast members were paid $22,500 per episode. The cast members received different salaries in the second season, beginning from the $20,000 range to $40,000 per episode. Before their salary negotiations for the third season, the cast decided to enter collective negotiations, despite Warner Bros.&#x27; preference for individual deals. The actors were given the salary of the least paid cast member. The stars were each paid $75,000 per episode in season three, $85,000 in season four, $100,000 in season five, $125,000 in season six, $750,000 in seasons seven and eight, and $1 million in seasons nine and ten, making Aniston, Cox, and Kudrow the highest-paid TV actresses of all time. The cast also received syndication royalties beginning in 2000 after renegotiations. At the time, that financial benefit of a piece of the show&#x27;s lucrative back-end profits had only been given out to stars who had ownership rights in a show, like Jerry Seinfeld and Bill Cosby.

Series creator David Crane wanted all six actors to be equally prominent, and the series was lauded as being &quot;the first true &#x27;ensemble&#x27; show.&quot; The cast members made efforts to keep the ensemble format and not allow one member to dominate; they entered themselves in the same acting categories for awards, opted for collective salary negotiations, and asked to appear together on magazine cover photos in the first season. The cast members also became best friends off-screen, so much so that recurring guest star Tom Selleck reported that he sometimes felt left out.

The cast remained good friends after the series run, most notably Cox and Aniston, with Aniston being godmother to Cox and David Arquette&#x27;s daughter, Coco. In the official farewell commemorative book &quot;Friends &#x27;Til the End&quot;, each separately acknowledged in interviews that the cast had become their family.

== Episodes ==


=== Season 1 ===
The first season introduces the six main characters who live in New York City: Rachel Green, a waitress; professional chef Monica Geller; her paleontologist brother, Ross Geller; free-spirited masseuse Phoebe Buffay; struggling actor Joey Tribbiani; and Ross&#x27;s college friend, Chandler Bing, whose precise occupation at a corporation is unknown. Rachel arrives at Central Perk, wearing her wedding dress, after leaving her fiancé, Barry Farber (Mitchell Whitfield), an orthodontist, at the altar. She moves into her high school friend Monica&#x27;s apartment, and gets a waitress job at Central Perk.

Ross, who has had a crush on Rachel since high school, often attempts to declare his feelings for her. However many obstacles stand in his way, including his insecurities, Rachel dating an Italian neighbor named Paolo, and the fact that he is expecting a baby with his lesbian ex-wife, Carol Willick (played first by Anita Barone and then Jane Sibbett), who gives birth to Ben Geller (Cole Sprouse) later in the season. Joey never has a steady girlfriend and constantly sleeps with a variety of women. Phoebe is rather odd and complex, mostly due to her mother Lily Buffay&#x27;s suicide when she was a child and having lived on the streets for a time. However, the gang loves her regardless.

Chandler breaks up with his girlfriend, Janice Hosenstein (Maggie Wheeler), only to find himself reconnecting with her throughout the series. Near the end of the season, while Ross is at a paleontology dig in China, Chandler accidentally lets slip that Ross loves Rachel, who then realizes that she also cares for him. The season ends with Rachel waiting at the airport for Ross, who is returning from China.

=== Season 2 ===
Rachel greets Ross at the airport only to discover that he has returned with Julie (Lauren Tom), someone he knew from graduate school. Rachel&#x27;s attempts to tell Ross that she loves him initially mirror his failed attempts in the first season. After he breaks up with Julie for Rachel, friction between them develops when Rachel discovers Ross&#x27;s list of the cons of dating her. They eventually begin a relationship after Rachel sees an old home video from her and Monica&#x27;s prom night and realizes Ross was going to stand in for her prom date Chip Matthews (Dan Gauthier) who nearly stood her up.

Monica is promoted to head chef at the Iridium restaurant, then gets fired for accepting gifts from a supplier, which is against company policy. Needing money, she is forced to take an embarrassing job as a waitress at a 1950s-style diner. She begins dating Richard Burke (Tom Selleck), a recently divorced family friend who is 21 years her senior. They eventually break up when Monica realizes that Richard, already a father, does not want more children. Joey is cast in a fictional version of the soap opera, &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot; as neurosurgeon Dr. Drake Ramoray. He moves out of his and Chandler&#x27;s apartment, forcing Chandler to get a new roommate, Eddie Menuek (Adam Goldberg).

However, Eddie is annoying and somewhat deranged. When Joey claims in a soap opera magazine interview that he writes many of his own lines, offending the show&#x27;s writer (James E. Reilly), his character is killed off. No longer able to afford his expensive new apartment, Joey moves back in with Chandler, kicking Eddie out in the process. In the season finale, Chandler talks to an anonymous woman in an online chat room. When they agree to meet in person, the woman turns out to be Janice.

=== Season 3 ===
Season 3 takes on a significantly more serialized format. Chandler and Janice date for several episodes until Joey catches Janice kissing her soon-to-be ex-husband Gary Litman (Mark Cohen). Not wanting to destroy her family, Chandler urges Janice to go back to Gary, then becomes depressed over the breakup for several episodes. Rachel quits her job at Central Perk and begins working at Bloomingdale&#x27;s, an upscale department store chain. Ross soon becomes jealous of her colleague Mark Robinson (Steven Eckholdt) and frustrated by Rachel&#x27;s long work hours. She is tired of his constant jealousy and insecurity, and decides they need a relationship break.

Ross, hurt and somewhat drunk, immediately sleeps with Chloe (Angela Featherstone), &quot;the hot girl from the Xerox place,&quot; causing Rachel to break up with him completely. Although Phoebe initially believes she has no family except her twin sister Ursula Buffay (Lisa Kudrow), she learns she has a half-brother, Frank Buffay, Jr. (Giovanni Ribisi) and discovers her birth mother, Phoebe Abbott (Teri Garr) over the course of the season. Joey falls in love with his acting partner Kate Miller (Dina Meyer), but is jealous of her dating Marshall Townend (Reg Rogers) the director of their play. They begin a brief relationship that ends when she takes an acting job in Los Angeles.

Monica dates millionaire Pete Becker (Jon Favreau), despite her initially not being attracted to him. However, she breaks up with Pete after he is seriously hurt trying to become the Ultimate Fighting Champion and refuses to quit. Phoebe sets Ross up on a date with her friend, Bonnie (Christine Taylor), inciting Rachel&#x27;s jealousy. She tries sabotaging the relationship by coercing Bonnie to shave her head bald, and eventually admits to Ross that she still has feelings for him. The season closes with Ross having to choose between Rachel and Bonnie.

=== Season 4 ===
In the season 4 premiere, after Ross breaks up with Bonnie, he and Rachel briefly reconcile after Ross pretends to read a long letter that Rachel wrote for him. However, Ross continues to insist that the two were on a break when he slept with Chloe, so they break up again. Joey dates Kathy (Paget Brewster), a girl that Chandler has a crush on. Kathy and Chandler later kiss, which causes drama between Chandler and Joey. Joey only forgives Chandler and allows him to date Kathy after Chandler spends Thanksgiving in a box as punishment.

Chandler&#x27;s relationship with Kathy ends after he discovers that she cheated on him due to an argument. Phoebe loses her job as a masseuse after making out with one of her clients Rick Sanoven (Jason Brooks) and she accompanies Monica, who has become a caterer for hire. They soon start a catering business together but Monica, after negatively reviewing a restaurant, Allesandro&#x27;s, is offered the position of head chef. Despite initially being pressured by the wrath of her co-workers, Monica eventually asserts her dominance in the kitchen. Phoebe becomes a surrogate for her brother and his fiancé, Alice Knight (Debra Jo Rupp).

Monica and Rachel are forced to switch apartments with Joey and Chandler after losing a bet during a quiz game, but manage to switch back by bribing them with Knicks season tickets and a one-minute kiss (off-screen) between each other. After her boss Joanna (Alison La Placa) dies, Rachel is demoted to personal shopping and meets and later dates a customer named Joshua Burgin (Tate Donovan). Ross begins dating an English woman named Emily Waltham (Helen Baxendale), and they quickly get engaged. Rachel struggles to cope and hastily suggests to Joshua that they marry, after which he rejects her. In the season finale, the group, apart from a heavily pregnant Phoebe and Rachel, travel to Ross and Emily&#x27;s wedding in London. Chandler and Monica sleep together, and Rachel, realizing that she is still in love with Ross, rushes to London to stop Ross and Emily&#x27;s wedding, but changes her mind when she sees them happy together. While saying his vows, Ross accidentally says Rachel&#x27;s name at the altar, shocking his bride Emily and the guests.

=== Season 5 ===
Ross and Emily marry, but an angry and humiliated Emily flees the reception. Rachel soon admits her love for Ross, but realizing how ridiculous this is, advises him to work on his marriage to Emily. She develops a crush on her neighbor Danny (George Newbern) and they date briefly, until she realizes that he is too close with his sister Krista (Julie Lauren). Monica and Chandler try to keep their new relationship a secret from their friends. Phoebe gives birth to triplets in the show&#x27;s 100th episode. She gives birth to a boy, Frank Buffay, Jr. Jr., and two girls, Leslie and Chandler Buffay, the latter of whom was supposed to be a boy, but was later revealed to be a girl.

After weeks of trying to contact her, Emily agrees to reconcile with Ross and move to New York if he breaks off all communication with Rachel. Ross agrees, but later attends a dinner with all his friends, Rachel included. Emily phones Ross, discovers Rachel is there, realizes she does not trust him and ends their marriage. Ross takes out his anger at work, resulting in him being indefinitely suspended from the museum, and he moves in with Chandler and Joey until eventually getting a new apartment across the street from them.

Rachel gets a new job at Ralph Lauren. Phoebe has a brief relationship with a police officer, Gary (Michael Rapaport), after finding his badge and using it as her own. Monica and Chandler go public with their relationship, to the surprise and delight of their friends. They decide to get married on a trip to Las Vegas, but change their plans after witnessing Ross and Rachel drunkenly stumbling out of the wedding chapel.

=== Season 6 ===
In the season 6 premiere, Ross and Rachel&#x27;s marriage turns out to be a drunken mistake that neither remembers until the other friends mention it. Ross promises Rachel he will get them an annulment, then secretly does nothing because he cannot face having three failed marriages. By the time Rachel discovers they are still married, an annulment is impossible due to their history; they are forced to get a divorce. After ignoring the numerous signs that they should get married, Monica and Chandler decide to live together, forcing Rachel to move in with Phoebe. Joey gets a new roommate, Janine LaCroix (Elle Macpherson).

Joey and Janine develop feelings for each other and date briefly until Janine criticizes Monica and Chandler, ending the relationship. After Janine moves out, Joey struggles with paying his bills so he takes a job at Central Perk. He soon lands a role on a cable TV series called &quot;Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.&quot;, starring alongside a crime-fighting robot. Ross gets a teaching job at New York University. He dates Elizabeth Stevens (Alexandra Holden), a student, despite it being against university policy. Elizabeth&#x27;s father, Paul Stevens (Bruce Willis), disapproves of Ross but falls for Rachel, and they start dating.

Both relationships soon end: Elizabeth is too immature for Ross, and previously reserved Paul opens up emotionally and is more than Rachel can handle. Phoebe and Rachel&#x27;s apartment catches fire, and Rachel moves in with Joey, while Phoebe stays with Chandler and Monica, though they later switch. While at a museum that has a two-year wait for weddings, Monica puts her name on the reservation list as a joke. When Chandler intercepts the museum&#x27;s phone call about a cancellation, he panics; however, Chandler has been planning to propose while pretending he may never want to marry.

While dining at a fancy restaurant, Chandler&#x27;s planned proposal is subverted by Monica&#x27;s ex-boyfriend Richard Burke, who unexpectedly shows up. Richard later tells Monica he wants to marry her and have children. Monica becomes upset at Chandler, believing his ruse about not wanting to marry. Chandler believes Monica has left him until he comes home to find their apartment decorated with candles and her waiting to propose to him. When she becomes too emotional to continue, Chandler proposes and she accepts.

=== Season 7 ===
The seventh season mainly follows Monica and Chandler as they plan their wedding amid various problems. Joey&#x27;s television series, &quot;Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E&quot; is canceled, but he is offered his old role on &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot;; the show is retconned with the revelation that Dr. Drake Ramoray has been in a four-year coma and is revived with a brain transplant from Cecilia Monroe (Susan Sarandon)&#x27;s character Jessica Lockhart. Phoebe&#x27;s repaired apartment now has one large bedroom instead of the original two, so Rachel permanently stays at Joey&#x27;s. Rachel is promoted at Ralph Lauren and impulsively hires a young assistant, Tag Jones (Eddie Cahill), based on his looks, passing over a more qualified woman Hilda (Jean St. James). Tag discovers her feelings about him at Thanksgiving dinner, and they begin dating, hiding it from co-workers. However, on her 30th birthday, Rachel ends their relationship, realizing Tag is too young and immature, particularly if she intends to follow her marriage schedule.

Hours before Monica and Chandler&#x27;s wedding ceremony, Chandler panics and goes into hiding just as Phoebe and Rachel find a positive pregnancy test in Monica and Chandler&#x27;s bathroom. They assume Monica is pregnant. Ross and Phoebe find Chandler and convince him to return for the ceremony, though he briefly bolts again after overhearing Phoebe and Rachel discussing the pregnancy test. He quickly returns, embracing the idea of fatherhood. After the ceremony, Monica denies she is pregnant; unbeknown to everyone, the positive pregnancy test is Rachel&#x27;s.

=== Season 8 ===
Season 8 begins at Monica and Chandler&#x27;s wedding reception. Phoebe and Monica discover Rachel&#x27;s pregnancy and persuade her to take another test to confirm it. Phoebe initially claims the test is negative, badly disappointing Rachel, then reveals it is positive, saying Rachel now knows how she really feels about having a baby. Ross is eventually revealed to be the father, and the season revolves around Rachel&#x27;s pregnancy. Rachel and Ross agree to be co-parents without resuming their romantic relationship; Ross begins dating Mona (Bonnie Somerville), who is Monica&#x27;s co-worker from Allesandro&#x27;s.

Joey takes Rachel out to quell her fears about motherhood, and realizes he has romantic feelings for her. While suppressing his feelings, he encourages Rachel to stay at Ross&#x27;s apartment so he can be involved in the pregnancy. The arrangement is too much for Mona, and she breaks up with Ross. Joey tells Ross about his feelings for Rachel. Ross initially is angry, then gives his blessing. Joey tells Rachel that he loves her, but she realizes she does not feel the same way, and they remain friends. When Rachel goes into labor, Ross&#x27;s mother Judy Geller (Christina Pickles) gives him a family heirloom ring and encourages him to propose to Rachel. Ross hesitates, and puts the ring in his jacket, which he later leaves in Rachel&#x27;s room.

After Monica jokes about having kids, she and Chandler decide to have a baby, starting while they are still at the hospital. After a prolonged labor, during which numerous other expectant mothers, including Janice, are taken to the delivery room, Rachel gives birth to baby Emma Geller-Green. She is left saddened and afraid after Janice later says that Ross may not always be there for her and the baby. When Joey comforts Rachel, the ring falls from Ross&#x27;s jacket to the floor. Joey kneels to pick it up, and Rachel, believing he is proposing, impulsively says yes. Meanwhile, Ross intends to ask Rachel if she wants to resume their relationship.

=== Season 9 ===
Season nine begins with Ross and Rachel cohabitating with their daughter Emma, after Joey and Rachel clear up the proposal misunderstanding. Monica and Chandler run into obstacles as they try for a baby: Chandler unknowingly agrees to a work transfer to Tulsa just as Monica is offered a head chef job at a new restaurant, Javu, resulting in Chandler commuting back and forth. After being apart from Monica during Christmas, Chandler quits to pursue a new career in advertising, starting as an unpaid intern at an ad agency, and eventually being hired as a junior copywriter. Monica and Chandler discover they are physically incompatible to conceive and after considering multiple options, decide to adopt.

Phoebe begins dating Mike Hannigan (Paul Rudd) for most of the season until Mike says that he never wants to marry again. Phoebe dates her ex-boyfriend from season 1, David (Hank Azaria) who plans on proposing to her, but Mike proposes first. Phoebe rejects both proposals but gets back together with Mike, only needing the reassurance that they have a future together. Rachel, believing that her co-worker Gavin Mitchell (Dermot Mulroney) is trying to steal her job while she is on maternity leave, returns to Ralph Lauren early. She discovers at her birthday party that Gavin has feelings for her. They kiss but do not pursue a relationship due to her history with Ross.

Meanwhile, Ross, having seen the kiss, retaliates by dating other women. After realizing that her and Ross&#x27;s living situation is too weird, Rachel and Emma move in with Joey. Rachel develops a crush on him, only to be disheartened when he starts dating Charlie Wheeler (Aisha Tyler), a new palaeontology professor to whom Ross is attracted. In the finale, the group travels to Barbados for Ross&#x27;s keynote speech at a conference. Joey and Charlie break up upon realizing they have nothing in common. Joey then learns about Rachel&#x27;s feelings for him, but says they cannot pursue this because of Ross. However, upon seeing Ross and Charlie kiss each other, he goes to Rachel&#x27;s hotel room, and the finale ends with them kissing.

=== Season 10 ===
The tenth season brings several long-running story lines to a close. Joey and Rachel try to contend with Ross&#x27;s feelings about their relationship, and after disastrous attempts to consummate, decide it is best they remain friends. Charlie breaks up with Ross to get back together with her ex-boyfriend Dr. Benjamin Hobart (Greg Kinnear). Mid-season, Joey officiates Phoebe and Mike&#x27;s wedding outside the Central Perk coffee house after a snow storm paralyzes the city, preventing them and guests getting to the wedding venue. Monica and Chandler are chosen by a pregnant woman named Erica (Anna Faris) to adopt her baby.

Following this, Monica and Chandler prepare to move to a house in the suburbs to raise their family, saddening everyone, particularly Joey, who is coping with all the changes in his life. In the series finale, Erica gives birth to fraternal twins Jack and Erica Bing, much to Monica and Chandler&#x27;s surprise. Rachel is fired from Ralph Lauren after her boss Mr. Zelner (Steve Ireland) overhears her interviewing for a job at Gucci. She encounters her former Bloomingdale co-worker Mark, who offers her a new job at Louis Vuitton in Paris. Ross, believing Rachel wants to stay, tries bribing Mr. Zelner to rehire her until he realizes Rachel wants to go to Paris. When Rachel says a tearful personal goodbye to everyone except Ross at her going away party, a hurt and angry Ross confronts Rachel, and they end up sleeping together.

Rachel leaves, and Ross – realizing how much he loves Rachel – chases her to the airport. When he reaches her, Rachel says she has to go to Paris. Before the plane takes off, Rachel calls Ross&#x27;s home phone and leaves a voice mail, apologizing for the way it ended. While speaking, she realizes that she loves him too, and gets off the plane at the last minute. The series ends with all the friends, plus Monica and Chandler&#x27;s new babies, leaving the empty apartment together for a final cup of coffee at Central Perk. The show ends first with a shot of everyone&#x27;s keys to Monica and Chandler&#x27;s apartment left on the counter top, and then pans to a shot of the apartment&#x27;s purple door.

== Production ==

=== Conception ===
David Crane and Marta Kauffman began developing three new television pilots that would premiere in 1994 after their sitcom &quot;Family Album&quot; was cancelled by CBS in 1993. Kauffman and Crane decided to pitch the series about &quot;six people in their 20s making their way in Manhattan&quot; to NBC since they thought it would fit best there. (Film director and screenwriter Cameron Crowe has asserted that the concept originated with Warner Bros. Television wanting him to make his 1992 movie &quot;Singles&quot; into a television show. Crowe alleges that when he refused permission, the idea was then taken over by Crane and Kaufman, who changed some details from the premise of the movie while developing the show.)

Crane and Kauffman presented the idea to their production partner Kevin Bright, who had served as executive producer on their HBO series &quot;Dream On&quot;. The idea for the series was conceived when Crane and Kauffman began thinking about the time when they had finished college and started living by themselves in New York; Kauffman believed they were looking at a time when the future was &quot;more of a question mark.&quot; They found the concept to be interesting, as they believed &quot;everybody knows that feeling&quot;, and because it was also how they felt about their own lives at the time. The team titled the series &quot;Insomnia Cafe&quot; and pitched the idea as a seven-page treatment to NBC in December 1993.

At the same time, Warren Littlefield, the then-president of NBC Entertainment, was seeking a comedy involving young people living together and sharing expenses after he regretted passing on the Black sitcom &quot;Living Single&quot;. Littlefield wanted the group to share memorable periods of their lives with friends, who had become &quot;new, surrogate family members.&quot; However, Littlefield found difficulty in bringing the concept to life and found the scripts developed by NBC to be terrible. When Kauffman, Crane and Bright pitched &quot;Insomnia Cafe&quot;, Littlefield was impressed that they knew who their characters were. NBC bought the idea as a put pilot, meaning they risked financial penalties if the pilot was not filmed.

Kauffman and Crane took three days to write the pilot script for a show they titled &quot;Friends Like Us.&quot; Littlefield wanted the series to &quot;represent Generation X and explore a new kind of tribal bonding&quot;, but the rest disagreed. Crane argued that it was not a series for one generation, and wanted to produce a series that everyone would enjoy watching. NBC liked the script and ordered the series. They changed the title to &quot;Six of One&quot;, mainly because they felt &quot;Friends Like Us&quot; was too similar to the ABC sitcom &quot;These Friends of Mine&quot;.

=== Casting ===
Once it became apparent that the series was a favored project at NBC, Littlefield reported that he was getting calls from every agent in town, wanting their client to be a part of the series. Auditions for the lead roles took place in New York and Los Angeles. The casting director shortlisted 1,000 actors who had applied for each role down to 75. Those who received a callback read in front of Crane, Kauffman and Bright. At the end of March, the number of potential actors had been reduced to three or four for each part, and these actors were asked to read for Les Moonves, then president of Warner Bros. Television.

Having worked with David Schwimmer in the past, the series creators wrote the character of Ross Geller with him in mind, and he was the first actor cast. Courteney Cox wanted to play the role of Monica Geller because she liked the &quot;strong&quot; character, but the producers had her in mind to play Rachel Green because of her &quot;cheery, upbeat energy&quot;, which was not how they envisioned Monica; after Cox&#x27;s audition, though, Kauffman agreed with Cox, and she got the role. When Matt LeBlanc auditioned for Joey Tribbiani, he put a &quot;different spin&quot; on the character. He played Joey more simple-minded than intended and gave the character heart. Although Crane and Kauffman did not want LeBlanc for the role at the time, they were told by the network to cast him. Jennifer Aniston, Matthew Perry and Lisa Kudrow were cast as Rachel, Chandler Bing and Phoebe Buffay based on their auditions. Perry and Aniston, both still under contract to other shows that year, &quot;LAX 2194&quot; and &quot;Muddling Through&quot;, were cast days before shooting of the pilot began.

More changes occurred to the series&#x27;s storylines during the casting process. The writers found that they had to adjust the characters they had written to suit the actors, and the discovery process of the characters occurred throughout the first season. Kauffman acknowledged that Joey&#x27;s character became &quot;this whole new being&quot;, and that &quot;it wasn&#x27;t until we did the first Thanksgiving episode that we realized how much fun Monica&#x27;s neuroses are.&quot;

=== Writing ===
In the weeks after NBC&#x27;s pick up of &quot;Friends&quot;, Crane, Kauffman and Bright reviewed sent-in scripts that writers had originally prepared for other series, mainly unproduced &quot;Seinfeld&quot; episodes. Kauffman and Crane hired a team of seven young writers because &quot;When you&#x27;re 40, you can&#x27;t do it anymore. The networks and studios are looking for young people coming in out of college.&quot; The creators felt that using six equal characters, rather than emphasizing one or two, would allow for &quot;myriad storylines and give the show legs.&quot; The majority of the storyline ideas came from the writers, although the actors added ideas. Although the writers originally planned the big love story to be between Joey and Monica, the idea of a romantic interest between Ross and Rachel emerged during the period when Kauffman and Crane wrote the pilot script.

During the production of the pilot, NBC requested that the script be changed to feature one dominant storyline and several minor ones, but the writers refused, wanting to keep three storylines of equal weight. NBC also wanted the writers to include an older character to balance out the young ones. Crane and Kauffman were forced to comply and wrote a draft of an early episode that featured &quot;Pat the Cop&quot; who would be used to provide advice to the other characters. Crane found the storyline to be terrible, and Kauffman joked, &quot;You know the book, &quot;Pat the Bunny&quot;? We had Pat the Cop.&quot; NBC eventually relented and dropped the idea.

Each summer, the producers would outline the storylines for the subsequent season. Before an episode went into production, Kauffman and Crane would revise the script written by another writer, mainly if something concerning either the series or a character felt foreign. The hardest episodes to write were always &quot;the first one and the last one of each season.&quot; Unlike other storylines, the idea for a relationship between Joey and Rachel was decided on halfway through the eighth season. The creators did not want Ross and Rachel to get back together so soon, and while looking for a romantic impediment, a writer suggested Joey&#x27;s romantic interest in Rachel.

The storyline was incorporated into the season; however, when the actors feared that the storyline would make their characters unlikable, the storyline was wrapped up, until it again resurfaced in the season&#x27;s finale. For the ninth season, the writers were unsure about the amount of storyline to give to Rachel&#x27;s baby Emma Geller-Green, as they wanted the show neither to revolve around a baby nor pretend there to be none. Crane said that it took them a while to accept the idea of a tenth season, which they decided to do because they had enough stories left to tell to justify the season. Kauffman and Crane would not have signed on for an eleventh season, even if all the cast members had wanted to continue.

The episode title format—&quot;The One ...&quot;—was created when the producers realized that the episode titles would not be featured in the opening credits, and therefore would be unknown to most of the audience. Episode titles officially begin with &quot;The One ...&quot; except the title of the pilot episode and the series finale &quot;The Last One&quot;. The season 5 episode &quot;The One Hundredth&quot; has the alternative title of &quot;The One With The Triplet&quot;.

=== Filming ===

The first season was shot on Stage 5 at Warner Bros. Studios in Burbank, California. NBC executives had worried that the coffee house setting was too hip and asked for the series to be set in a diner, but eventually consented to the coffee house concept. The opening title sequence was filmed in a fountain at the Warner Bros. Ranch at 4:00 am, while it was particularly cold for a Burbank morning. At the beginning of the second season, production moved to the larger Stage 24, which was renamed The &quot;Friends&quot; Stage after the series finale.

Filming for the series began during the summer of 1994 in front of a live audience, who were given a summary of the series to familiarize themselves with the six main characters. A hired comedian entertained the studio audience between takes. Each 22-minute episode took six hours to film—twice the length of most sitcom tapings—mainly due to the several retakes and rewrites of the script.

Although the producers always wanted to find the right stories to take advantage of being on location, &quot;Friends&quot; was never shot in New York. Bright felt that filming outside the studio made episodes less funny, even when shooting on the lot outside, and that the live audience was an integral part of the series. When the series was criticized for incorrectly depicting New York, with the financially struggling group of friends being able to afford huge apartments, Bright noted that the set had to be big enough for the cameras, lighting, and &quot;for the audience to be able to see what&#x27;s going on&quot;. The apartments also needed to provide a place for the actors to execute the actions in the scripts.

The fourth-season finale was shot on location in London because the producers were aware of the series&#x27; popularity in the UK. The scenes were shot in a studio with three audiences each made up of 500 people. These were the show&#x27;s largest audiences throughout its run. The fifth-season finale, set in Las Vegas, was filmed at Warner Bros. Studios, although Bright met people who thought it was filmed on location.

== Series finale ==
The series&#x27;s creators completed the first draft of the hour-long finale in January 2004, four months before its original airing. Crane, Kauffman and Bright watched the finales of other sitcoms to prepare the episode&#x27;s outline, paying attention to what worked and what did not. They liked the ones that stayed true to the series, deeming &quot;The Last Show&quot;, the finale of &quot;The Mary Tyler Moore Show&quot; to be the gold standard. Crane, Kauffman, and Bright had difficulty writing the finale. They did not want to do &quot;something high concept, or take the show out of the show.&quot; The most critical parts of the finale were shot without an audience and with a minimum number of crew members. The main cast enjoyed the finale and were confident that the fans would react similarly:

NBC heavily promoted the series finale, which was preceded by weeks of media hype. Local NBC affiliates organized viewing parties around the U.S., including an event at Universal CityWalk featuring a special broadcast of the finale on an outdoor Astrovision screen. The finale was the subject of two episodes of &quot;Dateline NBC&quot;, one of which ran for two hours. A one-hour retrospective of clips from previous episodes was shown before the airing of the episode. Following the finale, &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot; was filmed on the set of the &quot;Friends&quot;&#x27; Central Perk coffee house, which featured the cast as guests. The advertising rates for the finale averaged $2 million for 30 seconds of commercial time, breaking the record held by the &quot;Seinfeld&quot; finale at $1.7 million.

In the U.S., 52.5 million viewers watched the finale on May 6, 2004, making it the most-watched entertainment telecast since the &quot;Seinfeld&quot; finale in 1998. The finale was the fifth most-watched series finale in television history, only behind the finales of &quot;M*A*S*H&quot; (&quot;Goodbye, Farewell and Amen&quot;), &quot;Cheers&quot; (&quot;One for the Road&quot;), &quot;The Fugitive&quot;, (&quot;The Judgment&quot;) and &quot;Seinfeld&quot;, which were respectively watched by 105, 80.4, 78.0 and 76.3 million viewers. The retrospective episode was watched by fewer than 36 million viewers, and the finale was the second most-watched television broadcast of the year in the United States, only behind the Super Bowl. Following the finales of &quot;Friends&quot; and &quot;Frasier&quot;, media critics speculated about the fate of the sitcom genre. Opinions varied between a signalling of the end of the sitcom genre, a small decline in the large history of the genre, and a general reduction of scripted television in favor of reality shows.

== Reunion special ==

On November 12, 2019, &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; announced that Warner Bros TV was developing a &quot;Friends&quot; reunion for HBO Max that would feature the whole cast and creators returning. On February 21, 2020, HBO confirmed that the unscripted reunion special, tentatively named &quot;The One Where They Got Back Together&quot;, was set to be released in May the same year, along with the 236 original episodes of the series. On March 18, 2020, it was announced that the special, which was set to film on the &quot;Friends&quot; Stage on March 23 and 24, had been postponed indefinitely, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In November 2020, Matthew Perry tweeted that the reunion is set to start filming in March 2021. On May 13, 2021, a teaser trailer was released officially announcing &quot;&quot; also known as &quot;The One Where They Get Back Together&quot;. The reunion special was released on HBO Max on May 27, 2021.

== Reception ==
=== Critical reception ===
Early reviews of the series were mixed; the first season holds a Metacritic score of 65 out of 100, based on 24 sampled reviews, indicating &quot;generally favourable reviews&quot;. Tom Feran of &quot;The Plain Dealer&quot; wrote that the series traded &quot;vaguely and less successfully on the hanging-out style of &quot;Seinfeld&quot;&quot;, while Ann Hodges of the &quot;Houston Chronicle&quot; called it &quot;the new &quot;Seinfeld&quot; wannabe, but it will never be as funny as &quot;Seinfeld&quot;.&quot; In the &quot;Los Angeles Daily News&quot;, Ray Richmond named the series as &quot;one of the brighter comedies of the new season&quot;, and the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; called it &quot;flat-out the best comedy series of the new season.&quot;

The &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;″ Ginny Holbert found Joey and Rachel&#x27;s characters to be underdeveloped, while Richmond commended the cast as a &quot;likeable youth ensemble&quot; with &quot;good chemistry.&quot; Robert Bianco of &quot;USA Today&quot; was complimentary of Schwimmer, calling him &quot;terrific.&quot; He also praised the female leads, but was concerned that Perry&#x27;s role as Chandler was &quot;undefined&quot; and that LeBlanc was &quot;relying too much on the same brain-dead stud routine that was already tired the last two times he tried it.&quot; The authors of &quot;Friends Like Us: The Unofficial Guide to Friends&quot; thought that the cast was &quot;trying just a little too hard&quot;; in particular, Perry and Schwimmer.

As the series progressed, reviews became more positive, and &quot;Friends&quot; became one of the most popular sitcoms of its time. It is now often ranked among the all-time best TV shows. Critics commended the series for having consistently sharp writing and for the chemistry between the main actors. Noel Holston of &quot;Newsday&quot;, who had dismissed the pilot as a &quot;so-so &quot;Seinfeld&quot; wannabe&quot; in 1994, repudiated his earlier review after re-watching the episode and felt like writing an apology to the writers. Heather Havrilesky of &quot;Salon.com&quot; thought that the series &quot;hit its stride&quot; in the second season. Havrilesky found the character-specific jokes and situations &quot;could reliably make you laugh out loud a few times each episode&quot;, and the quality of writing allowed the stories to be &quot;original and innovative.&quot;

Bill Carter of &quot;The New York Times&quot; called the eighth season a &quot;truly stunning comeback.&quot; Carter found that by &quot;generating new hot storylines and high-decibel laughs&quot;, the series made its way &quot;back into the hearts of its fans.&quot; However, Liane Bonin of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; felt that the direction of the ninth season was a &quot;disappointing buzzkill&quot;, criticizing it for the non-stop celebrity guest spots and going into jump the shark territory. Although disappointed with the season, Bonin noted that &quot;the writing [was] still sharp.&quot; Havrilesky thought that the tenth season was &quot;alarmingly awful, far worse than you would ever imagine a show that was once so good could be.&quot; &quot;Friends&quot; was featured on &quot;Time&quot;″s list of &quot;The 100 Best TV Shows of All-Time&quot;, saying, &quot;the well-hidden secret of this show was that it called itself &quot;Friends&quot;, and was really about family.&quot;

Reviews of the series finale were mostly positive. &quot;USA Today&quot;″s Robert Bianco described the finale as entertaining and satisfying and praised it for deftly mixing emotion and humor while highlighting each of the stars. Sarah Rodman of the &quot;Boston Herald&quot; praised Aniston and Schwimmer for their acting, but felt that their characters&#x27; reunion was &quot;a bit too neat, even if it was what most of the show&#x27;s legions of fans wanted.&quot; Roger Catlin of the &quot;Hartford Courant&quot; felt that newcomers to the series would be &quot;surprised at how laughless the affair could be, and how nearly every strained gag depends on the sheer stupidity of its characters.&quot; Ken Parish Perkins, writing for &quot;Fort Worth Star-Telegram&quot;, pointed out that the finale was &quot;more touching than comical, more satisfying in terms of closure than knee-slappingly funny.&quot;

In a 2021 program on ITV, &quot;Mr. Bean&quot; writer Richard Curtis accused the &quot;Friends&quot; writers of stealing the joke which involved Joey getting a turkey stuck on his head in &quot;The One with All the Thanksgivings&quot; from the 1992 episode &quot;Merry Christmas, Mr. Bean&quot;. In that episode, Mr. Bean (Rowan Atkinson) got a turkey stuck on his head after losing his watch while stuffing the turkey and put his head in to try to retrieve it. Rowan Atkinson, however, argued that jokes are meant to be stolen, or to inspire.

=== Awards ===
To maintain the series&#x27; ensemble format, the main cast members decided to enter themselves in the same acting categories for awards. Beginning with the eighth season, the actors decided to submit themselves in the lead actor balloting, rather than in the supporting actor fields. The series was nominated for 62 Primetime Emmy Awards, winning six.

Aniston and Kudrow are the only main cast members to win an Emmy, while Cox is the only actor not to be nominated. The series won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Comedy Series at the 54th Primetime Emmy Awards in 2002, receiving nominations in 1995, 1996, 1999, 2000, and 2003. The series also won an American Comedy Award, one GLAAD Media Award, one Golden Globe Award, three Logie Awards, six People&#x27;s Choice Awards, one Satellite Award, and one Screen Actors Guild Award.

=== Ratings ===
The table below shows the ratings of &quot;Friends&quot; in the United States, where it consistently ranked within the top ten of the final television season ratings. &quot;Rank&quot; refers to how well &quot;Friends&quot; rated compared to other television series that aired during primetime hours of the corresponding television season. It is shown in relation to the total number of series airing on the then-six major English-language networks in a given season. &quot;Viewers&quot; refers to the average number of viewers for all original episodes, broadcast during the television season in the series&#x27; regular timeslot. The &quot;season premiere&quot; is the date that the first episode of the season aired, and the &quot;season finale&quot; is the date that the final episode of the season aired. Following the September 11 attacks, ratings increased 17% over the previous season.

=== Syndication ===
Because of syndication revenue, &quot;Friends&quot; continues to generate approximately $1 billion each year for Warner Bros. That translates into about $20 million in annual residuals each for Jennifer Aniston, Courteney Cox, Lisa Kudrow, Matt LeBlanc, Matthew Perry and David Schwimmer, who each get 2% of syndication income for &quot;Friends&quot;.

All episodes became available on Netflix on January 1, 2015, introducing a new generation to the show. UK &quot;Friends&quot; reruns&#x27; ratings in 2015 increased by more than 10% annually. The 2016 reruns&#x27; US weekly audience, not including streaming, of 16 million would make it a hit on network television were the show still being produced. In the US, the series has a syndication deal through multiple networks, including Nick at Nite, TBS, and Paramount Network. In July 2019, it was announced that from the beginning of 2020, &quot;Friends&quot; would not be available on Netflix in the US and instead would be shown on Warner Bros. Discovery&#x27;s video-streaming service HBO Max, which launched in May 2020.

== Legacy and cultural impact ==

Although the producers thought of &quot;Friends&quot; as &quot;only a TV show&quot;, psychologists investigated the cultural impact of &quot;Friends&quot; during the series&#x27; run. Aniston&#x27;s hairstyle was nicknamed &quot;The Rachel&quot; and copied around the world. Joey&#x27;s catchphrase, &quot;How &quot;you&quot; doin&#x27;?&quot;, became a popular part of Western English slang, often used as a pick-up line or when greeting friends. The series also influenced the English language, according to a study by the University of Toronto that found that the characters used the emphasized word &quot;so&quot; to modify adjectives more often than any other intensifier. Although the preference had already made its way into the American vernacular, usage on the series may have accelerated the change. Chandler&#x27;s habit of ending a sentence unfinished for sarcasm also influenced viewers&#x27; speech. The show&#x27;s availability on streaming television—it accounted for 4% of all Netflix views in 2018—gave it a large new Gen Z audience. Kauffman reported that her high school daughter&#x27;s friends thought that &quot;Friends&quot; was a new period piece about the 1990s. One young fan described the show as &quot;aspirational ... [kids hope] that when they&#x27;re that age ... they&#x27;ll have those friends&quot;.

&quot;Friends&quot; has been credited in helping non-English speaking students to learn the language. A 2012 poll by Kaplan International English Colleges found that more than a quarter (26%) of its students cited the sitcom as the best show for helping them improve their English. Notable individuals who have also said that the sitcom helped them learn English include Liverpool Football Club manager Jürgen Klopp, South Korean band BTS member RM and Belgian professional golfer Thomas Pieters.

&quot;Friends&quot; developed an alternative family lifestyle by representing young people who live unconventional domestic lives. It presented the idea that &quot;all you need are good friends&quot; and that you can construct families through choice. The audience was able to identify with the program through the troubles seen on weekly episodes. It portrayed a new way of living life and developing relationships which were not normally seen in conventional society. According to a pop-culture expert at the University at Buffalo, &quot;Friends&quot; is &quot;one of those rare shows that marked a change in American culture.&quot; The images of youth and the roles they portray are better defined and represent a lifestyle that centers around creating and sustaining relationships between friends running their own lives and seeking help from each other.
&quot;Vox&quot; stated that &quot;Friends&quot; had an impact on the creation of other conflictless &quot;hangout sitcoms&quot;, with groups of adult friends who are funny and have similar character traits. One example of this is &quot;How I Met Your Mother&quot;, which &quot;The Guardian&quot;″s TV and radio blog noted also shares its setting (Manhattan) with &quot;Friends&quot;. Other examples include &quot;The Big Bang Theory&quot;, &quot;New Girl&quot;, and &quot;Happy Endings&quot;.

Readers of &quot;TV Guide&quot; voted the cast of &quot;Friends&quot; their Best Comedy cast of all time, ranking at 29% of the votes, beating &quot;Seinfeld&quot;, which registered 18%. A poll undertaken by &quot;60 Minutes&quot; and &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; named &quot;Friends&quot; the third-greatest sitcom of all time. In 2014, the series was ranked by &quot;Mundo Estranho&quot; the Best TV Series of All Time. A 2015 survey by &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; of 2,800 actors, producers, directors, and other industry people named &quot;Friends&quot; as their No. 1 favorite show.

&quot;Friends&quot; was parodied in the twelfth season &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot; episode &quot;Murder Among Friends&quot;. In the episode, amateur sleuth Jessica Fletcher (Angela Lansbury) investigates the murder of Ricki Vardian (Cindy Katz) a producer for &quot;Buds&quot;, a fictional television series about the daily lives of a group of city friends. The episode was devised after CBS moved &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot; from its regular Sunday night timeslot to a Thursday night timeslot directly opposite &quot;Friends&quot; on NBC; Angela Lansbury was quoted by Bruce Lansbury, her brother and &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot;″s supervising producer, as having &quot;a bit of an attitude&quot; about the move to Thursday, but he saw the plot as &quot;a friendly setup, no mean-spiritedness.&quot; Jerry Ludwig, the writer of the episode, researched the &quot;flavor&quot; of &quot;Buds&quot; by watching episodes of &quot;Friends&quot;.

Producers of &quot;Married... with Children&quot; attempted to create a spinoff series called &quot;Enemies&quot;, which was intended to act as an antithesis to &quot;Friends&quot; the same way &quot;Married... with Children&quot; had been an antithesis to family sitcoms such as &quot;The Cosby Show&quot;. However, the Fox network declined to pick up the series.

=== Coffee house ===
The Central Perk coffee house, one of the principal settings of the series, is part of the Warner Bros. Studio Tour Hollywood. People sometimes propose marriage on the couch, and many tourists cry when they sit on it. The coffee house has inspired various imitations worldwide. In 2006, Iranian businessman Mojtaba Asadian started a Central Perk franchise, registering the name in 32 countries. The decor of the coffee houses is inspired by &quot;Friends&quot;, featuring replica couches, counters, neon signage and bricks. The coffee houses contain paintings of the various characters from the series, and televisions playing &quot;Friends&quot; episodes. James Michael Tyler, who plays Gunther, the Central Perk manager in the series, attended the grand opening of the Dubai café, where he worked as a waiter.

Central Perk was rebuilt as part of a museum exhibit at Warner Bros. Studios and was shown on &quot;The Ellen DeGeneres Show&quot; in October 2008 when Jennifer Aniston visited the set for the first time since the series finale in 2004. From September 24 to October 7, 2009, a Central Perk replica was on Broadwick Street, Soho, London. The coffee house sold coffee to customers and featured a display of &quot;Friends&quot; memorabilia and props, such as the Geller Cup from the season three episode &quot;The One with the Football&quot;. In Beijing, business owner Du Xin opened a coffee shop named Central Perk in March 2010.

In India, there are six &quot;Friends&quot;-themed cafes which features many icons from the original TV series, including Chandler and Joey&#x27;s ugly dog statue, the orange sofa, the purple door of Monica and Rachel&#x27;s apartment, and Phoebe&#x27;s pink bicycle. One named Central Perk is in Chandigarh, Kolkata; one named F.R.I.E.N.D.S. Cafe in West Bengal, and the others are in Delhi, Gurgaon; Bhubaneswar, Odisha; and Pune, Maharashtra.

There are two &quot;Friends&quot; themed cafes in Pakistanone in Lahore, Punjab, known as &quot;Friends Cafe&quot; and the other in Peshawar, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa called &quot;Central Perk&quot;. Both cafes have an iconic couch, a guitar and foosball table, quotes from the show on the walls and episode reruns on a projector. They&#x27;re planning to have their own Gunther at the bar.

In 2016, a Central Perk replica was opened in Outram, Singapore. It is the only Central Perk replica outside of the United States that has been given intellectual property rights by Warner Bros. The café includes feature walls, replicating the walls of the main characters&#x27; apartments and memorabilia and props used on the show.

In August 2019, Lego launched a Central Perk Lego set to mark the show&#x27;s 25 anniversary.

== Distribution ==
=== Broadcast ===

==== United States ====
After the produced pilot lived up to NBC&#x27;s hopes, the series premiered with the name &quot;Friends&quot; on September 22, 1994, in the coveted Thursday 8:30 p.m. time slot. The pilot aired between &quot;Mad About You&quot; and &quot;Seinfeld&quot;, and was watched by almost 22 million American viewers. The series was a huge success throughout its run and was a staple of NBC&#x27;s Thursday night line-up, dubbed by the network as Must See TV. When Crane told reporters in 2001 that the ninth season was a possibility, critics believed that he was posturing and that at least two of the cast members would not sign on for another season. When it was confirmed that &quot;Friends&quot; would return for a ninth season, the news was mainly about the amount of money—$7 million per episode—that it took to bring the series back for another season.

After year-long expectations that the ninth season would be the series&#x27; last, NBC signed a deal in late December 2002 to bring the series back for a final tenth season. The series&#x27; creative team did not want to extend negotiations into the next year and wanted to start writing the rest of the ninth-season episodes and a potential series finale. NBC agreed to pay $10 million to Warner Bros. for the production of each tenth-season episode, the highest price in television history for a 30-minute series. Although NBC was unable to bring in enough advertising revenue from commercials to cover the costs, the series was integral to the Thursday night schedule, which brought high ratings and profits to the other television series. The cast demanded that the tenth season be reduced from the usual 24 episodes to 18 episodes to allow them to work on outside projects.

In fall 2001, Warner Bros. Domestic Cable made a deal with sister network TBS (both were owned by Time Warner) to air the series in rerun syndication. Warner Bros. Domestic Cable announced that it had sold additional cable rights to &quot;Friends&quot; to Nick at Nite which began airing in the fall of 2011 (unlike the TBS and broadcast syndication airings, Nick at Nite broadcasts of the series, which began airing as part of a seven-night launch marathon on September 5, 2011, replace the end credit tag scenes with marginalized credits featuring promotions for the series and other Nick at Nite programs). Warner Bros. was expected to make $200 million in license fees and advertising from the deal. Nick at Nite paid $500,000 per episode to air the episodes after 6 pm. ET for six years through fall 2017. In syndication until 2005, &quot;Friends&quot; had earned $4 million per episode in cash license fees for a total of $944 million.

Comedy Central began airing reruns of &quot;Friends&quot; in October 2019.

==== International ====

Having already made huge success in the United States, &quot;Friends&quot; producers decided to air the show in Europe. It premiered in the United Kingdom on April 28, 1995. Season 1 was broadcast until September 1995 on Channel 4 at 9:30 PM on Friday nights, and immediately was a success. The popularity of the show allowed &quot;I&#x27;ll Be There for You&quot; the theme song by the Rembrandts to hit number 3 on the UK Singles Charts in September 1995.

The popularity of the show in Britain led to an episode being produced in London at the end of the fourth season, starring British actress Helen Baxendale, who became a leading cast member in seasons four and five during her character Emily Waltham&#x27;s relationship with Ross. The show has since aired on different channels in the UK in their original, unedited international versions prior to their being re-edited for US broadcast and syndication. These versions, with additional footage not seen domestically, have aired on such stations as Channel 4, Sky1, E4, and Comedy Central UK.

In September 2011, &quot;Friends&quot; officially ended on E4 after the channel re-ran the series since 2004. Comedy Central took over the rights to air the program from October 2011. Since 2018 Channel 5 started airing the program. In the Republic of Ireland, each season of the show made its European debut on RTÉ2. After 2004 RTÉ2 began to repeat the series from the start before moving over to TV3 and its digital channel 3e in 2010. , repeats of the show have returned to RTÉ2 while also broadcasting on Comedy Central Ireland.

Season 10&#x27;s finale in the UK, broadcast on May 28, 2004, was on Channel 4. It was broadcast from 9 pm to 10 pm and attracted &quot;Friends&quot;&#x27; largest UK audiences. It attracted almost 10 million viewers, and is currently standing at Number 10 in Channel 4&#x27;s most-watched shows. &quot;Big Brother&quot; was moved to 10 pm, which &quot;Friends&quot; had beaten. &quot;Friends&quot; got 9.6 million viewers at 9 pm, while &quot;Big Brother 5&quot;″s launch attracted 7.2 million viewers at 10 pm, which is the most-watched premiere on UK TV ever. However, on January 3, 2007, &quot;Celebrity Big Brother 5&quot;″s launch was watched by 7.3 million viewers, and its eviction on January 19, 2007, was watched by 8.7 million viewers.

&quot;Friends&quot; has previously aired in Australia on the Seven Network (season 1), Nine Network (season 2–10), Network Ten (2007–09, repeats), Arena, 111 Hits, 9Gem (2012–2018, repeats), and TVHits. It currently airs on 10 Peach and on pay TV channel Comedy, both of which broadcast the high-definition version of the series. The show is broadcast on TV2 in New Zealand.

In Canada, the series was broadcast on Global. In later years, it was syndicated on several of its cable sibling networks, including Slice, DTour, and TVTropolis, its previous incarnation. The series is now syndicated to Bell Media owned CTV Comedy Channel.

In Latin America, the first seven seasons aired on Sony, and the remaining seasons on Warner. In Brazil, free-to-air networks RedeTV! and SBT also aired a few seasons.

In India, the show is broadcast by Comedy Central at various times. It is the most-watched English language show in the country.

In the Philippines, the show was originally aired on ABC-5
from 1996 to 2005 and ETC from 2005 to 2014.

In Greece, the show was broadcast on Star Channel. In Cyprus, &quot;Friends&quot; aired on CyBC 2 while reruns air on TVOne.

In November 2019 Croatian television broadcaster RTL2 announced that they will be airing &quot;Friends&quot;, and to this day they are shown every late night

In 2022, Bilibili, iQIYI, Tencent Video, and Youku began distributing edited &quot;Friends&quot; episodes in China. These edited versions of episodes removed most LGBT content, not edited in original Chinese airings. Chinese fans of the show reacted negatively online.

=== Remaster ===
Beginning in March 2012, high definition versions of all 236 &quot;Friends&quot; episodes were made available to local broadcast stations, starting with the pilot episode. For the remastered episodes, Warner Bros. restored previously cropped images on the left and right sides of the screen, using the original 35 mm film source, to use the entire 16:9 widescreen frame. Because the show was not originally filmed for widescreen, but rather filmed in 4-perf format and protected for 4:3, some cropping problems arise in some shots where information from the top and bottom of the frame is removed, and some expanded shots reveal unintentional artifacts, including set edges, boom mics and body doubles replacing some of the main cast.

In early versions of the HD remasters, there were also a few shots, including chroma effects shots, which were sourced from standard-definition videotape sources, as not all of the footage had been located in time for the remaster. The original film sources for these shots were later rescanned for later broadcast and release. These masters had been airing in New Zealand on TV2 since January 2011, and the earlier HD prints continue to air on Comedy Central in the United Kingdom as of 2020. Netflix added all ten seasons of &quot;Friends&quot; in high definition to its streaming service in the United States in January 2015 before the platform discontinued the series in late 2019.

== Home media ==
=== Streaming ===
In October 2014, Warner Bros. chairman and chief executive officer, Kevin Tsujihara, announced that the company had licensed the North American streaming rights of all ten seasons of &quot;Friends&quot; to Netflix, in a deal said to be worth around $500,000 an episode, or about $120 million in total. The show became available on Netflix from January 1, 2015. The Netflix airings are the versions aired on NBC rather than the longer international versions, as discussed below. The series left Netflix in the US on January 1, 2020, as it began streaming on HBO Max on May 27, 2020. The series left Netflix in Canada for Crave on December 31, 2020.

=== Blu-ray and DVD ===
All ten seasons have been released on DVD individually and as a box set. Each Region 1 season release contains special features and are presented in their aforementioned original international broadcast versions, although Region 2 releases are as originally aired domestically. For the first season, each episode is updated with color correction and sound enhancement. A wide range of &quot;Friends&quot; merchandise has been produced by various companies. In September 1995, WEA Records released the first album of music from &quot;Friends&quot;, the &quot;Friends Original TV Soundtrack&quot;, containing music featured in previous and future episodes. The soundtrack debuted on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 at number 46, and sold 500,000 copies in November 1995.

In 1999, a second soundtrack album entitled &quot;Friends Again&quot; was released. Other merchandise includes a &quot;Friends&quot; version of the DVD game &quot;Scene It?&quot;, and a quiz video game for PlayStation 2 and PC entitled &quot;Friends: The One with All the Trivia&quot;. On September 28, 2009, a box set was released in the UK celebrating the show&#x27;s 15th anniversary. The box set contained extended episodes, an episode guide, and original special features.

Warner Home Video released a complete series collection on Blu-ray on November 13, 2012. The collection does not feature the extra deleted scenes and jokes that were included on prior DVD releases, and are therefore presented in their NBC broadcast versions.

In Australia, the original DVD releases were fold out box sets which contained three discs, and released as follows: Season 1 and Season 2 on March 13, 2002, Season 3 and Season 4 on July 9, 2002, Season 5, 6 and 7 on July 29, 2002, Season 8 on March 18, 2003, Season 9 on February 11, 2004, and Season 10 on November 24, 2004. Repackaged sets, slimmed into regular DVD cases also containing three discs were released from 2003 to 2004. Collector&#x27;s Edition sets were released from September 9, 2003, through to February 1, 2006, these sets contains 4 discs, in fat DVD cases, with extra bonus material.

On October 4, 2006, the individual seasons were repackaged into regular DVD case sets and marked as &quot;Including Brand New Bonus Disc&quot;. Once again each individual season were repackaged with new artwork on March 31, 2010. The first complete series boxset on DVD was released around 2004 or 2005, this was titled &#x27;The One With All Ten Seasons&quot; and the packaging was a black box with a lift up lid and contains exclusive packaging for all ten seasons.

The second complete series boxset was released August 21, 2013 and was a red box which contained the 2010 individual season sets inside. On October 1, 2014, was the 20th Anniversary boxset, this was a white box and contained the same 2010 individual releases inside. On October 7, 2015, another boxset was released &#x27;The One With All Ten Seasons&quot;, the same name used on the original boxset, however this time slimmed down and contains the 2010 individual releases inside. The outer box is open on insert side for the cases to slide in and out, more of a budget release. In 2016, a repackaged &#x27;The Complete Series&#x27; Blu-ray boxset was issued, containing the same 10 individual seasons in the original set, however the box is more cut down and is opened on one side, and also does not include the book that contained the episode guide.

The entire series was released on Ultra HD Blu-ray on September 24, 2024.

== Spin-off ==

After the series finale in 2004, LeBlanc signed on for the spin-off series, &quot;Joey&quot;, following Joey&#x27;s move to Los Angeles to pursue his acting career. Kauffman and Crane were not interested in the spin-off, although Bright agreed to executive produce the series with Scott Silveri and Shana Goldberg-Meehan. NBC heavily promoted &quot;Joey&quot; and gave it &quot;Friends&quot;&#x27; Thursday 8:00 pm timeslot.

The pilot was watched by 18.6 million American viewers, but ratings continually decreased throughout the series&#x27;s two seasons, averaging 10.2 million viewers in the first season and 7.1 million in the second. The final broadcast episode on March 7, 2006, was watched by 7.09 million viewers; NBC cancelled the series on May 15, 2006, after two seasons, leaving eight episodes unaired. Bright blamed the collaboration between NBC executives, the studio and other producers for quickly ruining the series:

<doc id="11318" wikidata="Q2900564" url="?curid=11318" title="FBI Most Wanted Terrorists">
<text>The FBI Most Wanted Terrorists is a list created and first released on October 10, 2001, with the authority of United States President George W. Bush, following the September 11 attacks
(9/11 incident). Initially, the list contained 22 of the top suspected terrorists chosen by the FBI, all of whom had earlier been indicted for acts of terrorism between 1985 and 1998. None of the 22 had been captured by US or other authorities by that date. Of the 22, only Osama Bin Laden was by then already listed on the FBI Ten Most Wanted Fugitives list.

No particular legal consequences flowed from the creation of and inclusion on the list. On January 17, 2002, the FBI released a third major FBI wanted list, which has now become known as the FBI Seeking Information – War on Terrorism list, to enlist the public&#x27;s help in reporting information which may prevent future terrorist attacks. The information sought to be reported is not necessarily relating to any person on any of the FBI wanted lists.

==Initial persons alleged to be terrorist fugitives==
On the fugitive group wanted poster, the FBI did not list the persons in any particular stated order, except perhaps for the consistent placing of bin Laden in the number one position of the top row. However, the 22 can easily fit into distinct categories over the two decades, based on the terrorist attacks in which they were, according to US authorities, involved.

For organization and ease of reference here, the 22 on the list are grouped by the attack for which they were placed on the list.

==FBI Seeking Information – War on Terrorism list==
Whereas the Most Wanted Terrorists list is reserved for terrorist fugitives who have been indicted by federal grand juries, the FBI recognized a further need to achieve a much quicker response time in order to prevent any future attacks which may be in the current planning stages. To enlist the public&#x27;s help in this effort, the FBI sought a way to deliver the early known suspected terror attack information, often very limited, out to the public as quickly as possible. So, on January 17, 2002, the third major FBI wanted list was first released, which has now become known as the FBI Seeking Information – Terrorism list.

As the name of this list implies, the FBI&#x27;s intent is to acquire any critical information from the public, as soon as possible, about the suspected terrorists, who may be in the planning stages of terror attacks against United States nationals at home and abroad. The first such list profiled five persons about whom little was known, but who were suspected of plotting terrorist attacks in martyrdom operations. The main evidence against the five was five videos they had produced, found in the rubble of Mohammed Atef&#x27;s destroyed home outside Kabul, Afghanistan.

==Additions to the list==
By 2006, more than four years had passed since the FBI had listed the original 22 alleged terrorists on the Most Wanted Terrorist list. Of those 22, by then four had been qualified for removal from the list, due to death or capture. Also by then, the FBI determined that other people qualified for the list. Some were indicted for attacks and plots that had taken place since the original list had been compiled. The original indictments had been for incidents only through 1998. The US had been victim to at least two significant terror attacks, which had generated new indictments, notably:

* USS &quot;Cole&quot; bombing in 2000, which killed 17 American sailors and wounded 40 on October 12, 2000, off the port coast of Aden, Yemen
* September 11, 2001 attacks in Manhattan, Washington, D.C., and Pennsylvania

In addition, after the original 2001 list had been compiled and released to the public, the US had foiled and issued indictments for numerous other plots, involving some new listed Most Wanted Terrorists. Those notable other plots involved:

* The Buffalo Six, a Buffalo, New York, cell, or Lackawanna Cell, exposed September 2002
* Palestinian Islamic Jihad, on Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) charges for plots based from Syria since 1995
* Abu Sayyaf kidnappings and murders of foreign nationals in the Philippines

In February 2006, the FBI completed two groups of additions to the Most Wanted Terrorists list, the first additions in over four years. On February 24, 2006, the day after adding two names to the list, the FBI added an additional six fugitive terrorists, for various plots and attacks. One of the entries was for an indictment dating back to the June 14, 1985, hijacking of TWA flight 847 by Hezbollah (see above).

Additionally, the FBI also added to the Seeking Information – War on Terrorism list an additional three people, most notably, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the leader of Al-Qaeda in Iraq. This marked the first time that al-Zarqawi had appeared on any of the three major FBI wanted lists. On June 8, 2006, ABC News reported that Abu Musab al-Zarqawi was confirmed to have been killed in Baghdad in a bombing raid by a United States task force. His death was confirmed by multiple sources in Iraq, including the United States government.

==Rewards==
Since 1984, the United States government has also used the Rewards for Justice Program, which pays monetary rewards of up to $25 million, or now, in some cases more, upon special authorization by the United States Secretary of State, to individuals who provide information which substantially leads to countering of terrorist attacks against United States persons. More than $100 million had been paid to over 60 people through this program.

The Rewards for Justice Program was established by the 1984 Act to Combat International Terrorism, Public Law 98-533, and is administered by the Bureau of Diplomatic Security, within the U.S. Department of State.

<doc id="11319" wikidata="Q37388" url="?curid=11319" title="Francis Bacon">
<text>Francis Bacon, 1st Viscount St Alban, 1st Baron Verulam, PC (; 22 January 1561 – 9 April 1626) was an English philosopher and statesman who served as Attorney General and Lord Chancellor of England under King James I. Bacon argued for the importance of natural philosophy, guided by scientific method, and his works remained influential throughout the Scientific Revolution.

Bacon has been called the father of empiricism. He argued for the possibility of scientific knowledge based only upon inductive reasoning and careful observation of events in nature. He believed that science could be achieved by the use of a sceptical and methodical approach whereby scientists aim to avoid misleading themselves. Although his most specific proposals about such a method, the Baconian method, did not have long-lasting influence, the general idea of the importance and possibility of a sceptical methodology makes Bacon one of the later founders of the scientific method. His portion of the method based in scepticism was a new rhetorical and theoretical framework for science, whose practical details are still central to debates on science and methodology. He is famous for his role in the scientific revolution, promoting scientific experimentation as a way of glorifying God and fulfilling scripture.

Bacon was a patron of libraries and developed a system for cataloguing books under three categories – history, poetry, and philosophy – which could further be divided into specific subjects and subheadings. About books he wrote: &quot;Some books are to be tasted; others swallowed; and some few to be chewed and digested.&quot; The Baconian theory of Shakespeare authorship, a fringe theory which was first proposed in the mid-19th century, contends that Bacon wrote at least some and possibly all of the plays conventionally attributed to William Shakespeare.

Bacon was educated at Trinity College at the University of Cambridge, where he rigorously followed the medieval curriculum, which was presented largely in Latin. He was the first recipient of the Queen&#x27;s counsel designation, conferred in 1597 when Elizabeth I reserved him as her legal advisor. After the accession of James I in 1603, Bacon was knighted, then created Baron Verulam in 1618 and Viscount St Alban in 1621. He had no heirs, and so both titles became extinct on his death of pneumonia in 1626 at the age of 65. He is buried at St Michael&#x27;s Church, St Albans, Hertfordshire.

==Biography==
===Early life and education===

Francis Bacon was born on 22 January 1561 at York House near Strand in London, the son of Sir Nicholas Bacon (Lord Keeper of the Great Seal) by his second wife, Anne (Cooke) Bacon, the daughter of the noted Renaissance humanist Anthony Cooke. His mother&#x27;s sister was married to William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley, making Burghley Bacon&#x27;s uncle.

Biographers believe that Bacon was educated at home in his early years owing to poor health, which would plague him throughout his life. He received tuition from John Walsall, a graduate of Oxford with a strong leaning toward Puritanism. He attended Trinity College at the University of Cambridge on 5 April 1573 at the age of 12, living there for three years along with his older brother Anthony Bacon (1558–1601) under the personal tutelage of John Whitgift, future Archbishop of Canterbury. Bacon&#x27;s education was conducted largely in Latin and followed the medieval curriculum. It was at Cambridge that Bacon first met Queen Elizabeth, who was impressed by his precocious intellect, and was accustomed to calling him &quot;The young lord keeper&quot;.

His studies brought him to the belief that the methods and results of science as then practised were erroneous. His reverence for Aristotle conflicted with his rejection of Aristotelian philosophy, which seemed to him barren, argumentative and wrong in its objectives.

On 27 June 1576, he and Anthony entered &quot;de societate magistrorum&quot; at Gray&#x27;s Inn. A few months later, Francis went abroad with Sir Amias Paulet, the English ambassador at Paris, while Anthony continued his studies at home. The state of government and society in France under Henry III afforded him valuable political instruction. For the next three years he visited Blois, Poitiers, Tours, Italy, and Spain. There is no evidence that he studied at the University of Poitiers. During his travels, Bacon studied language, statecraft, and civil law while performing routine diplomatic tasks. On at least one occasion he delivered diplomatic letters to England for Walsingham, Burghley, Leicester, and for the queen.

The sudden death of his father in February 1579 prompted Bacon to return to England. Sir Nicholas had laid up a considerable sum of money to purchase an estate for his youngest son, but he died before doing so, and Francis was left with only a fifth of that money. Having borrowed money, Bacon got into debt. To support himself, he took up his residence in law at Gray&#x27;s Inn in 1579, his income being supplemented by a grant from his mother Lady Anne of the manor of Marks near Romford in Essex, which generated a rent of £46.

===Parliamentarian===

Bacon stated that he had three goals: to uncover truth, to serve his country, and to serve his church. He sought to achieve these goals by seeking a prestigious post. In 1580, through his uncle, Lord Burghley, he applied for a post at court that might enable him to pursue a life of learning, but his application failed. For two years he worked quietly at Gray&#x27;s Inn, until he was admitted as an outer barrister in 1582.

His parliamentary career began when he was elected MP for Bossiney, Cornwall, in a by-election in 1581. In 1584 he took his seat in Parliament for Melcombe in Dorset, and in 1586 for Taunton. At this time, he began to write on the condition of parties in the church, as well as on the topic of philosophical reform in the lost tract &quot;Temporis Partus Maximus&quot;. Yet he failed to gain a position that he thought would lead him to success. He showed signs of sympathy to Puritanism, attending the sermons of the Puritan chaplain of Gray&#x27;s Inn and accompanying his mother to the Temple Church to hear Walter Travers. This led to the publication of his earliest surviving tract, which criticized the English church&#x27;s suppression of the Puritan clergy. In the Parliament of 1586, he openly urged execution for the Catholic Mary, Queen of Scots.

About this time, he again approached his powerful uncle for help; this move was followed by his rapid progress at the bar. He became a bencher in 1586 and was elected a Reader in 1587, delivering his first set of lectures in Lent the following year. In 1589, he received the valuable appointment of reversion to the Clerkship of the Star Chamber, although he did not formally take office until 1608; the post was worth £1,600 a year.

In 1588 he became MP for Liverpool and then for Middlesex in 1593. He later sat three times for Ipswich (1597, 1601, 1604) and once for Cambridge University (1614).

He became known as a liberal-minded reformer, eager to amend and simplify the law. Though a friend of the crown, he opposed feudal privileges and dictatorial powers. He spoke against religious persecution. He struck at the House of Lords in its usurpation of the Money Bills. He advocated for the union of England and Scotland, which made him a significant influence toward the consolidation of the United Kingdom; and he later would advocate for the integration of Ireland into the Union. Closer constitutional ties, he believed, would bring greater peace and strength to these countries.

===Final years of Elizabeth&#x27;s reign===

Bacon soon became acquainted with Robert Devereux, the 2nd Earl of Essex, Queen Elizabeth&#x27;s favourite. By 1591 he acted as the earl&#x27;s confidential adviser. In 1592, he was commissioned to write a tract in response to the Jesuit Robert Parson&#x27;s anti-government polemic, which he titled &quot;Certain Observations Made upon a Libel&quot;, identifying England with the ideals of democratic Athens against the belligerence of Spain. Bacon took his third parliamentary seat for Middlesex when in February 1593 Elizabeth summoned Parliament to investigate a Roman Catholic plot against her. Bacon&#x27;s opposition to a bill that would levy triple subsidies in half the usual time offended the Queen: opponents accused him of seeking popularity, and for a time the Court excluded him from favour.

When the office of Attorney General fell vacant in 1594, Lord Essex&#x27;s influence was not enough to secure the position for Bacon and it was given to Sir Edward Coke. Likewise, Bacon failed to secure the lesser office of Solicitor General in 1595, the Queen pointedly snubbing him by appointing Sir Thomas Fleming instead. To console him for these disappointments, Essex presented him with a property at Twickenham, which Bacon subsequently sold for £1,800.

In 1597 Bacon became the first Queen&#x27;s Counsel designate, when Queen Elizabeth reserved him as her legal counsel. In 1597, he was also given a patent, giving him precedence at the Bar. Despite his designations, he was unable to gain the status and notoriety of others. In a plan to revive his position he unsuccessfully courted the wealthy young widow Lady Elizabeth Hatton. His courtship failed after she broke off their relationship upon accepting marriage to Sir Edward Coke, a further spark of enmity between the men. In 1598 Bacon was arrested for debt. Afterward, however, his standing in the Queen&#x27;s eyes improved. Gradually, Bacon earned the standing of one of the learned counsels. His relationship with the Queen further improved when he severed ties with Essexa shrewd move, as Essex would be executed for treason in 1601.

With others, Bacon was appointed to investigate the charges against Essex. A number of Essex&#x27;s followers confessed that Essex had planned a rebellion against the Queen. Bacon was subsequently a part of the legal team headed by the Attorney General Sir Edward Coke at Essex&#x27;s treason trial. After the execution, the Queen ordered Bacon to write the official government account of the trial, which was later published as &quot;A DECLARATION of the Practices and Treasons attempted and committed by Robert late Earle of Essex and his Complices, against her Majestie and her Kingdoms ...&quot; after Bacon&#x27;s first draft was heavily edited by the Queen and her ministers.

According to his personal secretary and chaplain, William Rawley, as a judge Bacon was always tender-hearted, &quot;looking upon the examples with the eye of severity, but upon the person with the eye of pity and compassion&quot;. And also that &quot;he was free from malice&quot;, &quot;no revenger of injuries&quot;, and &quot;no defamer of any man&quot;.

===James I comes to the throne===

The succession of James I brought Bacon into greater favour. He was knighted in 1603. In another shrewd move, Bacon wrote his &quot;Apologies&quot; in defence of his proceedings in the case of Essex, as Essex had favoured James to succeed to the throne. The following year, during the course of the uneventful first parliamentary session, Bacon married Alice Barnham. In June 1607, he was at last rewarded with the office of Solicitor General and in 1608 he began working as the Clerk of the Star Chamber. Despite a generous income, old debts still could not be paid. He sought further promotion and wealth by supporting King James and his arbitrary policies. In 1610 the fourth session of James&#x27;s first Parliament met. Despite Bacon&#x27;s advice to him, James and the Commons found themselves at odds over royal prerogatives and the King&#x27;s embarrassing extravagance. The House was finally dissolved in February 1611. Throughout this period Bacon managed to stay in favour with the King while retaining the confidence of the Commons.

In 1613 Bacon was finally appointed Attorney General, after advising the King to shuffle judicial appointments. As Attorney General, Bacon, by his zealous effortswhich included tortureto obtain the conviction of Edmund Peacham for treason, raised legal controversies of high constitutional importance. Bacon and Gray&#x27;s Inn produced &quot;The Masque of Flowers&quot; to celebrate the wedding of Robert Carr, 1st Earl of Somerset and his wife, Frances Howard, Countess of Somerset, and he successfully prosecuted them for murder in 1616.

The so-called Prince&#x27;s Parliament of April 1614 objected to Bacon&#x27;s presence in the seat for Cambridge and to the various royal plans that Bacon had supported. Although he was allowed to stay, Parliament passed a law that forbade the Attorney General to sit in Parliament. His influence over the King had evidently inspired resentment or apprehension in many of his peers. Bacon, however, continued to receive the King&#x27;s favour, which led to his appointment in March 1617 as temporary Regent of England (for a period of a month), and in 1618 as Lord Chancellor. On 12 July 1618 the King created Bacon Baron Verulam of Verulam in the Peerage of England; he then became known as Francis, Lord Verulam.

Bacon continued to use his influence with the King to mediate between the throne and Parliament, and in this capacity he was further elevated in the same peerage as Viscount St Alban on 27 January 1621.

===Lord Chancellor and public disgrace===

Bacon&#x27;s public career ended in disgrace in 1621. After he fell into debt, a parliamentary committee on the administration of the law charged him with 23 separate counts of corruption. His lifelong enemy, Sir Edward Coke, who had instigated these accusations, was one of those appointed to prepare the charges against the chancellor. To the lords, who sent a committee to enquire whether a confession was really his, he replied, &quot;My lords, it is my act, my hand, and my heart; I beseech your lordships to be merciful to a broken reed.&quot; He was sentenced to a fine of £40,000 and committed to the Tower of London at the king&#x27;s pleasure; the imprisonment lasted only a few days and the fine was remitted by the king. More seriously, parliament declared Bacon incapable of holding future office or sitting in parliament. He narrowly escaped undergoing degradation, which would have stripped him of his titles of nobility. Subsequently, the disgraced viscount devoted himself to study and writing.

There seems little doubt that Bacon had accepted gifts from litigants, but this was an accepted custom of the time and not necessarily evidence of deeply corrupt behaviour. While acknowledging that his conduct had been lax, he countered that he had never allowed gifts to influence his judgement and, indeed, he had on occasion given a verdict against those who had paid him. He even had an interview with King James in which he assured:
He also wrote the following to George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham:
As the conduct of accepting gifts was ubiquitous and common practice, and the Commons was zealously inquiring into judicial corruption and malfeasance, it has been suggested that Bacon served as a scapegoat to divert attention from Buckingham&#x27;s own ill practice and alleged corruption.

The true reason for his acknowledgement of guilt is the subject of debate, but some authors speculate that it may have been prompted by his sickness, or by a view that through his fame and the greatness of his office he would be spared harsh punishment. He may even have been blackmailed, with a threat to charge him with sodomy, into confession.

The British jurist Basil Montagu wrote in Bacon&#x27;s defense, concerning the episode of his public disgrace:
===Personal life===
====Religious beliefs====
Bacon was a devout Anglican. He believed that philosophy and the natural world must be studied inductively, but argued that we can only study arguments for the existence of God. Information about God&#x27;s attributes (such as nature, action, and purposes) can only come from special revelation. Bacon also held that knowledge was cumulative, that study encompassed more than a simple preservation of the past. &quot;Knowledge is the rich storehouse for the glory of the Creator and the relief of man&#x27;s estate,&quot; he wrote. In his Essays, he affirms that &quot;a little philosophy inclineth man&#x27;s mind to atheism, but depth in philosophy bringeth men&#x27;s minds about to religion.&quot;

Bacon&#x27;s idea of idols of the mind may have self-consciously represented an attempt to Christianize science at the same time as developing a new, reliable scientific method; Bacon gave worship of Neptune as an example of the idola tribus fallacy, hinting at the religious dimensions of his critique of the idols.

Bacon was against the splintering within Christianity, believing that it would ultimately lead to the creation of atheism as a dominant worldview, as indicated with his quote that &quot;The causes of atheism are: divisions in religion, if they be many; for any one main division, addeth zeal to both sides; but many divisions introduce atheism. Another is, scandal of priests; when it is come to that which St. Bernard saith &quot;One cannot now say the priest is as the people, for the truth is that the people are not so bad as the priest&quot;. A third is, custom of profane scoffing in holy matters; which doth by little and little deface the reverence of religion. And lastly, learned times, specially with peace and prosperity; for troubles and adversities do more bow men&#x27;s minds to religion.&quot;

====Architectural projects====
Bacon built Verulam House in St Albans to his own designs. It has been suggested that this building was derivative of Sir Rowland Hill&#x27;s building at Soulton Hall.

====Marriage to Alice Barnham====
When he was 36, Bacon courted Elizabeth Hatton, a young widow of 20. Reportedly, she broke off their relationship upon accepting marriage to a wealthier man, Bacon&#x27;s rival, Sir Edward Coke. Years later, Bacon still wrote of his regret that the marriage to Hatton had not taken place.

At the age of 45, Bacon married Alice Barnham, the 13-year-old daughter of a well-connected London alderman and MP. Bacon wrote two sonnets proclaiming his love for Alice. The first was written during his courtship and the second on his wedding day, 10 May 1606. When Bacon was appointed lord chancellor, &quot;by special Warrant of the King&quot;, Lady Bacon was given precedence over all other Court ladies. Bacon&#x27;s personal secretary and chaplain, William Rawley, wrote in his biography of Bacon that his marriage was one of &quot;much conjugal love and respect&quot;, mentioning a robe of honour that he gave to Alice and which &quot;she wore unto her dying day, being twenty years and more after his death&quot;.

However, an increasing number of reports circulated about friction in the marriage, with speculation that this may have been due to Alice&#x27;s making do with less money than she had once been accustomed to. It was said that she was strongly interested in fame and fortune, and when household finances dwindled, she complained bitterly. Bunten wrote in her &quot;Life of Alice Barnham&quot;  that, upon their descent into debt, she went on trips to ask for financial favours and assistance from their circle of friends. Bacon disinherited her upon discovering her secret romantic relationship with Sir John Underhill, rewriting his will (which had generously planned to leave her lands, goods, and income) and revoking her entirely as a beneficiary.

====Sexuality====
Several authors believe that, despite his marriage, Bacon was primarily attracted to men. Forker, for example, has explored the &quot;historically documentable sexual preferences&quot; of both Francis Bacon and King James I and concluded they were both oriented to &quot;masculine love&quot;, a contemporary term that &quot;seems to have been used exclusively to refer to the sexual preference of men for members of their own gender.&quot; Bacon&#x27;s sexuality has been disputed by others, who point to lack of consistent evidence and consider the sources to be more open to interpretation.

The Jacobean antiquary and Bacon&#x27;s fellow parliament member Sir Simonds D&#x27;Ewes implied there had been a question of bringing Bacon to trial for buggery, with which his brother Anthony Bacon had also been charged. (Bacon&#x27;s brother &quot;apparently also was homosexual&quot;, according to literature and sexuality scholar Joseph Cady.) In his &quot;Autobiography and Correspondence&quot; diary entry for 3 May 1621, the date of Bacon&#x27;s censure by Parliament, D&#x27;Ewes describes Bacon&#x27;s love for his Welsh serving-men, in particular his servant Mr. Henry Godrick or Goodrick, a &quot;very effeminate-faced youth&quot; whom he calls &quot;his catamite and bedfellow&quot;. Bacon&#x27;s own mother complained to Anthony on Bacon&#x27;s affection for another servant of his, named Percy, whom she wrote Bacon kept as &quot;a coach companion and bed companion.&quot;

In his &quot;Brief Lives&quot; sketches (likely composed during 1665–1690 and published as a book in 1813), the antiquary John Aubrey wrote that Bacon was a pederast &quot;whose Ganimeds and Favourites tooke Bribes&quot;. While pederast strictly denoted &quot;boy-lover&quot; in earlier times, Cady wrote that Aubrey deployed the term discreetly in the original Greek to signify &quot;male homosexual&quot;. The figure of Ganymede, he continued, was another of many common ways of referring obliquely to homosexuality.

In &quot;New Atlantis&quot;, Bacon described his utopian island as being &quot;the chastest nation under heaven&quot;, with &quot;no touch&quot; of &quot;masculine love&quot;. Cady argued that Bacon&#x27;s reference to male homosexuality in the &quot;New Atlantis&quot; deliberately gave the appearance of coming from &quot;outside the phenomenon&quot; due to prevalent opposition. It contrasted deliberately with &quot;veiled&quot; praise of the topic elsewhere in Bacon&#x27;s work, he asserted. Cady offered several examples, including that Bacon discussed only male beauty in his short essay &quot;Of Beauty&quot;. He also noted that Bacon ended his monologue &quot;The Masculine Birth of Time&quot; with an older man asking a younger one (from his &quot;inmost heart&quot;) to &quot;give yourself to me so that I may restore you to yourself&quot; and &quot;secure [you] an increase beyond all hopes and prayers of ordinary marriages&quot;.

===Death===

On 9 April 1626, Bacon died of pneumonia at Highgate outside London, specifically at Arundel House, a country residence of his friend the Earl of Arundel, though Arundel was then imprisoned in the Tower of London. An influential account of the circumstances of his death was given by John Aubrey&#x27;s &quot;Brief Lives&quot;. Aubrey&#x27;s vivid account, which portrays Bacon as a martyr to experimental scientific method, has him journeying to High-gate through the snow with the King&#x27;s physician when he is suddenly inspired by the possibility of using the snow to preserve meat:

After stuffing the fowl with snow, Bacon contracted a fatal case of pneumonia. Some people, including Aubrey, consider these two contiguous, possibly coincidental events as related and causative of his death:Aubrey has been criticized for his evident credulousness in this and other works; on the other hand, he knew Thomas Hobbes, Bacon&#x27;s fellow-philosopher and friend.

Being unwittingly on his deathbed, the philosopher dictated his last letter to the Earl:

Another account appears in a biography by William Rawley, Bacon&#x27;s personal secretary and chaplain:

He was buried in St Michael&#x27;s Church in St Albans. At the news of his death, over 30 great minds collected together their eulogies of him, which were then later published in Latin. He left personal assets of about £7,000 and lands that realised £6,000 when sold. His debts amounted to more than £23,000, equivalent to more than £4m at current value.

==Philosophy and works==

Francis Bacon&#x27;s philosophy is displayed in the vast and varied writings he left, which might be divided into three great branches:
* &quot;Scientific works&quot; in which his ideas for a universal reform of knowledge into scientific methodology and the improvement of mankind&#x27;s state using the Scientific method are presented.
* &quot;Religious and literary works&quot; in which he presents his moral philosophy and theological meditations.
* &quot;Juridical works&quot; in which his reforms in English law are proposed.

==Influence and legacy==
===Science===

Bacon&#x27;s seminal work the &quot;Novum Organum&quot; was highly influential in the 17th century among scholars, in particular Sir Thomas Browne, who in his encyclopedia &quot;Pseudodoxia Epidemica&quot; (1646–72) frequently adheres to a Baconian approach to his scientific enquiries. This book entails the basis of the scientific method as a means of observation and induction. Also Robert Hooke was highly influenced by Bacon, using Baconian language and ideas in his book, &quot;Micrographia.&quot;

According to Bacon, learning and knowledge all derive from inductive reasoning. Through his belief in experimentally-derived data, he theorised that all the knowledge that was necessary to fully understand a concept could be attained using induction. &quot;Induction&quot; in this context can be thought of as &quot;reasoning from evidence,&quot; as opposed to &quot;deduction,&quot; or &quot;top-down reasoning,&quot; which can be thought of as &quot;reasoning from a pre-existing premise, or hypothesis.&quot; In order to get to the point of an inductive conclusion, one must consider the importance of observing the particulars (specific parts of nature). &quot;Once these particulars have been gathered together, the interpretation of Nature proceeds by sorting them into a formal arrangement so that they may be presented to the understanding.&quot; Experimentation is essential to discovering the truths of Nature. When an experiment happens, the data is used to form a result and conclusion. Note that this process does not involve a pre-existing hypothesis. On the contrary, inductive reasoning starts with data, not a prior premise or hypothesis. Through this conclusion of particulars, an understanding of Nature can be formed. Now that an understanding of Nature has been arrived at, an inductive conclusion can be drawn. &quot;There are and can be only two ways of searching into and discovering truth. The one flies from the senses and particulars to the most general axioms, and from these principles, the truth of which it takes for settled and immovable, proceeds to judgment and to the discovery of middle axioms. And this way is now in fashion. The other derives axioms from the senses and particulars, rising by a gradual and unbroken ascent, so that it arrives at the most general axioms last of all. This is the true way, but as yet untried.&quot; (Bacon&#x27;s axiom XIX from the Novum Organum) 

Bacon explains how we come to this understanding and knowledge because of this process in comprehending the complexities of nature. &quot;Bacon sees nature as an extremely subtle complexity, which affords all the energy of the natural philosopher to disclose her secrets.&quot; Bacon described the evidence and proof revealed through taking a specific example from nature and expanding that example into a general, substantial claim of nature. Once we understand the particulars in nature, we can learn more about it and become surer of things occurring in nature, gaining knowledge and obtaining new information all the while. &quot;It is nothing less than a revival of Bacon&#x27;s supremely confident belief that inductive methods can provide us with ultimate and infallible answers concerning the laws and nature of the universe.&quot; Bacon states that when we come to understand parts of nature, we can eventually understand nature better as a whole because of induction. Because of this, Bacon concludes that all learning and knowledge must be drawn from inductive reasoning.

During the Restoration, Bacon was commonly invoked as a guiding spirit of the Royal Society founded under Charles II in 1660. During the 18th-century French Enlightenment, Bacon&#x27;s non-metaphysical approach to science became more influential than the dualism of his French contemporary Descartes, and was associated with criticism of the &quot;Ancien Régime&quot;. In 1733 Voltaire introduced him to a French audience as the &quot;father&quot; of the scientific method, an understanding which had become widespread by the 1750s. In the 19th century his emphasis on induction was revived and developed by William Whewell, among others. He has been reputed as the &quot;Father of Experimental Philosophy&quot;.

He also wrote a long treatise on Medicine, &quot;History of Life and Death&quot;, with natural and experimental observations for the prolongation of life.

One of his biographers, the historian William Hepworth Dixon, states: &quot;Bacon&#x27;s influence in the modern world is so great that every man who rides in a train, sends a telegram, follows a steam plough, sits in an easy chair, crosses the channel or the Atlantic, eats a good dinner, enjoys a beautiful garden, or undergoes a painless surgical operation, owes him something.&quot;

In 1902 Hugo von Hofmannsthal published a fictional letter, known as &quot;The Lord Chandos Letter&quot;, addressed to Bacon and dated 1603, about a writer who is experiencing a crisis of language.

===North America===

Bacon played a leading role in establishing the British colonies in North America, especially in Virginia, the Carolinas and Newfoundland in northeastern Canada. His government report on &quot;The Virginia Colony&quot; was submitted in 1609. In 1610 Bacon and his associates received a charter from the king to form &quot;the Tresurer and the Companye of Adventurers and planter of the Cittye of London and Bristoll for the Collonye or plantacon in Newfoundland&quot;, and sent John Guy to found a colony there. Thomas Jefferson, the third President of the United States, wrote: &quot;Bacon, Locke and Newton. I consider them as the three greatest men that have ever lived, without any exception, and as having laid the foundation of those superstructures which have been raised in the Physical and Moral sciences&quot;.

In 1910, Newfoundland issued a postage stamp to commemorate Bacon&#x27;s role in establishing the colony. The stamp describes Bacon as &quot;the guiding spirit in Colonization Schemes in 1610&quot;. Moreover, some scholars believe he was largely responsible for the drafting, in 1609 and 1612, of two charters of government for the Virginia Colony. William Hepworth Dixon considered that Bacon&#x27;s name could be included in the list of Founders of the United States.

===Law===
Although few of his proposals for law reform were adopted during his lifetime, Bacon&#x27;s legal legacy was considered by the magazine &quot;New Scientist&quot; in 1961 as having influenced the drafting of the Napoleonic Code as well as the law reforms introduced by 19th-century British Prime Minister Sir Robert Peel. The historian William Hepworth Dixon referred to the Napoleonic Code as &quot;the sole embodiment of Bacon&#x27;s thought&quot;, saying that Bacon&#x27;s legal work &quot;has had more success abroad than it has found at home&quot;, and that in France &quot;it has blossomed and come into fruit&quot;.

Harvey Wheeler attributed to Bacon, in &quot;Francis Bacon&#x27;s Verulamiumthe Common Law Template of The Modern in English Science and Culture&quot;, the creation of these distinguishing features of the modern common law system:
* using cases as repositories of evidence about the &quot;unwritten law&quot;;
* determining the relevance of precedents by exclusionary principles of evidence and logic;
* treating opposing legal briefs as adversarial hypotheses about the application of the &quot;unwritten law&quot; to a new set of facts.

As late as the 18th century, some juries still declared the law rather than the facts, but already before the end of the 17th century Sir Matthew Hale explained modern common law adjudication procedure and acknowledged Bacon as the inventor of the process of discovering unwritten laws from the evidences of their applications. The method combined empiricism and inductivism in a new way that was to imprint its signature on many of the distinctive features of modern English society. Paul H. Kocher writes that Bacon is considered by some jurists to be the father of modern Jurisprudence.

Bacon is commemorated with a statue in Gray&#x27;s Inn, South Square in London where he received his legal training, and where he was elected Treasurer of the Inn in 1608.

More recent scholarship on Bacon&#x27;s jurisprudence has focused on his advocating torture as a legal recourse for the crown. Bacon himself was not a stranger to the torture chamber; in his various legal capacities in both Elizabeth I&#x27;s and James I&#x27;s reigns, Bacon was listed as a commissioner on five torture warrants. In 1613(?), in a letter addressed to King James I on the question of torture&#x27;s place within English law, Bacon identifies the scope of torture as a means to further the investigation of threats to the state: &quot;In the cases of treasons, torture is used for discovery, and not for evidence.&quot; For Bacon, torture was not a punitive measure, an intended form of state repression, but instead offered a modus operandi for the government agent tasked with uncovering acts of treason.

===Organization of knowledge===

Francis Bacon developed the idea that a classification of knowledge must be universal while handling all possible resources. In his progressive view, humanity would be better if access to educational resources were provided to the public, hence the need to organise it. His approach to learning reshaped the Western view of knowledge theory from an individual to a social interest.

The original classification proposed by Bacon organised all types of knowledge into three general groups: history, poetry, and philosophy. He did that based on his understanding of how information is processed: memory, imagination, and reason, respectively. His methodical approach to the categorization of knowledge goes hand-in-hand with his principles of scientific methods. Bacon&#x27;s writings were the starting point for William Torrey Harris&#x27;s classification system for libraries in the United States by the second half of the 1800s.

The phrase &quot; (or &quot;), meaning &quot;knowledge is power&quot;, is commonly attributed to Bacon: the expression &quot;&quot; (&quot;knowledge itself is power&quot;) occurs in his &quot;Meditationes Sacrae&quot; (1597).

==Historical debates==
===Bacon and Shakespeare===
The Baconian hypothesis of Shakespearean authorship, first proposed in the mid-19th century, contends that Francis Bacon wrote some or even all of the plays conventionally attributed to William Shakespeare.

===Occult theories===

Francis Bacon often gathered with the men at Gray&#x27;s Inn to discuss politics and philosophy, and to try out various theatrical scenes that he admitted writing. Bacon&#x27;s alleged connection to the Rosicrucians and the Freemasons has been widely discussed by authors and scholars in many books. However, others, including Daphne du Maurier in her biography of Bacon, have argued that there is no substantive evidence to support claims of involvement with the Rosicrucians. Frances Yates does not make the claim that Bacon was a Rosicrucian, but presents evidence that he was nevertheless involved in some of the more closed intellectual movements of his day. She argues that Bacon&#x27;s movement for the advancement of learning was closely connected with the German Rosicrucian movement, while Bacon&#x27;s &quot;New Atlantis&quot; portrays a land ruled by Rosicrucians. He apparently saw his own movement for the advancement of learning to be in conformity with Rosicrucian ideals.

The link between Bacon&#x27;s work and the Rosicrucians&#x27; ideals which Yates allegedly found was the conformity of the purposes expressed by the Rosicrucian Manifestos and Bacon&#x27;s plan of a &quot;Great Instauration&quot;, for the two were calling for a reformation of both &quot;divine and human understanding&quot;, as well as both, had in view the purpose of mankind&#x27;s return to the &quot;state before the Fall&quot;.

Another major link is said to be the resemblance between Bacon&#x27;s &quot;New Atlantis&quot; and the German Rosicrucian Johann Valentin Andreae&#x27;s &quot;Description of the Republic of Christianopolis&quot; (1619). Andreae describes a utopic island in which Christian theosophy and applied science ruled, and in which the spiritual fulfilment and intellectual activity constituted the primary goals of each individual, the scientific pursuits being the highest intellectual callinglinked to the achievement of spiritual perfection. Andreae&#x27;s island also depicts a great advancement in technology, with many industries separated in different zones which supplied the population&#x27;s needswhich shows great resemblance to Bacon&#x27;s scientific methods and purposes.

While rejecting occult conspiracy theories surrounding Bacon and the claim Bacon personally identified as a Rosicrucian, intellectual historian Paolo Rossi has argued for an occult influence on Bacon&#x27;s scientific and religious writing. He argues that Bacon was familiar with early modern alchemical texts and that Bacon&#x27;s ideas about the application of science had roots in Renaissance magical ideas about science and magic facilitating humanity&#x27;s domination of nature. Rossi further interprets Bacon&#x27;s search for hidden meanings in myth and fables in such texts as &quot;The Wisdom of the Ancients&quot; as succeeding earlier occultist and Neoplatonic attempts to locate hidden wisdom in pre-Christian myths. As indicated by the title of his study, however, Rossi claims Bacon ultimately rejected the philosophical foundations of occultism as he came to develop a form of modern science.

Rossi&#x27;s analysis and claims have been extended by Jason Josephson-Storm in his study, &quot;The Myth of Disenchantment&quot;. Josephson-Storm also rejects conspiracy theories surrounding Bacon and does not make the claim that Bacon was an active Rosicrucian. However, he argues that Bacon&#x27;s &quot;rejection&quot; of magic actually constituted an attempt to purify magic of Catholic, demonic, and esoteric influences and to establish magic as a field of study and application paralleling Bacon&#x27;s vision of science. Furthermore, Josephson-Storm argues that Bacon drew on magical ideas when developing his experimental method. Josephson-Storm finds evidence that Bacon considered nature a living entity, populated by spirits, and argues Bacon&#x27;s views on the human domination and application of nature actually depend on his spiritualism and personification of nature.

Bacon&#x27;s influence can also be seen on a variety of religious and spiritual authors, and on groups that have utilized his writings in their own belief systems.

<text>A snap (also called a &quot;hike&quot;, &quot;snapback&quot;, or &quot;pass from center&quot;) is the backward passing of the ball in gridiron football at the start of play from scrimmage.

==Action==
The ball begins on the ground with its long axis parallel to the sidelines of the field, its ends marking each team&#x27;s line of scrimmage in American football; in Canadian football, the line of scrimmage of the team without the ball is 1 yard past their side of the ball. The player snapping the ball (known officially as the &quot;snapper&quot; in rule books) delivers the ball to another player, and that action is the snap. The snapper may hand, throw, or even roll the ball to the other player. The snap must be a quick and continuous movement of the ball by one or both hands of the snapper, and the ball must leave the snapper&#x27;s hands. The various rules codes have additional requirements, all of which have the effect of requiring the ball to go backward. The snapper almost always passes the ball between his legs, but only in Canadian football is that required.

In the standard gridiron football formation, the center/centre is the snapper and is situated in the middle of the line of scrimmage. Only in arena football is the center required by rule to be the snapper. In other codes, a guard, tackle, running back, tight end or split end can legally deliver the snap; such scenarios, known as an &quot;unbalanced line&quot;, are seldom used outside of trick plays and novelties.
For a handed snap, the snapper will usually have his head up, facing opponents. For a thrown snap, especially in formations wherein the ball may be snapped to players in different positions, the snapper will commonly looking between his legs. Because of the vulnerability of a player in such a position, the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) and the National Federation of State High School Associations (&quot;Fed&quot;) have adopted rules providing that if a player is positioned at least seven yards behind the neutral zone to receive a snap, opponents are not to deliberately contact the snapper until one second after the snap (NCAA), or until the snapper has a chance to react (Fed). However, in professional football it is common for a center to be able to practice a single &quot;shotgun&quot; formation thrown snap enough to keep his head up and toss it blindly.

A snap is considered a backward pass, therefore if the ball is snapped and it hits the ground without any player gaining control of the ball the play is ruled as a fumble.

==Snap count==

The team entitled to snap the ball will usually know in advance the moment when the snap is to occur as one of their players calls out signals, which usually include a loud sound such as &quot;hut&quot; voiced one or more times, the number of which they know; they are thus said to know the &quot;snap count&quot;. Therefore, they have a considerable advantage over their opponents. The center is not, however, allowed to make motions simulating part of the snap-action; therefore their opponents can be confident the first motion of the ball or the center&#x27;s hands is the beginning of the snap.

The snap count is decided on in the huddle, usually expressed as &quot;...on &lt;number&gt;.&quot; being the final words spoken by the quarterback after calling the play but before the huddle breaks and the players go to the line of scrimmage. The snap count allows offensive players to have a small head start. The defensive players want to predict the snap, and build up speed such that they cross the line of scrimmage exactly as the play begins, to increase their chances of getting a tackle for a loss or a sack. By varying the snap count, a quarterback forces the defensive players to react to the movement of the offensive players, or risk being called for an offsides or encroachment penalty. Unfortunately for the offense, this advantage can sometimes become a disadvantage. When faced with an exceptionally loud stadium, players may be unable to hear the snap count and are forced to concentrate more on visual cues (silent snap count or a hard count), or risk false start penalties.

The offense must also be mindful of the play clock. If they fail to snap the ball in time they incur a delay of game penalty. Also, with a dwindling play clock, the defense has better chances of guessing when the ball will be snapped. It is easier to predict when the ball will be snapped with 2 seconds left on the play clock, rather than 5 seconds.

The defensive team is not allowed to simulate, by calling out numbers, the offense&#x27;s snap count. Successfully simulating the count would cause members of the offensive team to act too early ruining co-ordination of the play and inviting penalties. Current rules, unlike earlier rules, position officials so far from the line of scrimmage for 50 minutes of the 60-minute game that it is extremely difficult to hear if the defense is simulating the count.

== History and rationale ==
The snap, the set scrum and ruck in today&#x27;s rugby union, and the play-the-ball in rugby league have common origins in rugby football. As the rules of rugby&#x27;s scrimmage were written when the game came to North America, they had a significant flaw which was corrected by custom elsewhere, but by the invention of the snap in American football.

The rule adopted by a committee for American football in 1880 first provided for the uncontested right of one side to play the ball by foot (in any direction) for a scrimmage. A certain use of the foot on the ball which had the same effect as heeling it back was known as a &quot;snap&quot;. Later in the 19th century, the option of snapping the ball back by hand was added. The option to play the ball with the foot was preserved, however, for several decades, although by early in the 20th century it was restricted to kicking the ball forward. The kick forward in scrimmage was a surprise play that did not work against a prepared defense. Also for several decades alternatives to the scrimmage for playing the ball from across the sideline after it had gone out of bounds—a throw-in or &quot;fair&quot;, and &quot;bounding in&quot;—existed. Until well into the 20th century, rather than an official readying the ball for scrimmage, the side entitled to the snap had complete custody of the ball and could snap it from the required spot at any time; for instance, a tackled ball carrier might feign injury, then suddenly snap the ball while recumbent, there being no stance requirement yet. The neutral zone and the right of the center not to be contacted by an opponent before the snap also was not an original feature. As the 20th century drew to a close, the NCAA and National Federation of State High School Associations extended that protection to some time the snap, in cases where a player is positioned at least 7 yards deep to receive a thrown snap.

Canadian football used the rugby scrimmage unaltered until near the end of the 19th century, when, regionally at first, under the influence of the American scrimmage, the number of players in the scrimmage was limited to three—a &quot;centre scrimmager&quot; bound on either side by props called &quot;side scrimmagers&quot;. The centre scrimmager was later renamed the &quot;snap&quot;, and in intercollegiate play one side was given the right to put foot to ball first. Beginning regionally again and universally by 1923, the Burnside rules led to the three-man scrimmage being reduced to the centre alone, the number of players on the field being reduced commensurately from 14 to 12, and a snap rule and neutral zone similar to that of American football was adopted. In addition to the between-the-legs requirement noted above, for several years after the adoption of the hand snap, a hand-to-hand snap was illegal, the ball required to be thrown instead, in Canadian football. (Though it was technically legal, the hand-to-hand snap was not used on the American side of the border until the 1930s.) Apparently, a complete break was desired from system of backheeling, and the T formation having gone into eclipse in American football at the time, the Canadian snap was modeled on the formations then in common use in the US, such as the single-wing formation.

The game design rationale for requiring the snap to be a quick and continuous motion to the backfield is to eliminate the need for rules provisions for a live ball in scrimmage. In rugby union the ball may be retained by the forwards and played for a time via the foot in a scrummage (which rugby league has as well) or ruck, or by the hands in a maul, necessitating additional restrictions on play and player positioning during those intervals. In American and Canadian football, the ball as it is put in play is only held in the line (by the center) for a fraction of a second. The uncontested possession also, as Walter Camp pointed out, allows for better offensive and defensive planning by the side entitled to snap the ball and their opposition, respectively. A muffed snap can be recovered by either team.

<doc id="11347" wikidata="Q515636" url="?curid=11347" title="FIFO (computing and electronics)">
<text>In computing and in systems theory, first in, first out (the first in is the first out), acronymized as FIFO, is a method for organizing the manipulation of a data structure (often, specifically a data buffer) where the oldest (first) entry, or &quot;head&quot; of the queue, is processed first.

Such processing is analogous to servicing people in a queue area on a first-come, first-served (FCFS) basis, i.e. in the same sequence in which they arrive at the queue&#x27;s tail.

FCFS is also the jargon term for the FIFO operating system scheduling algorithm, which gives every process central processing unit (CPU) time in the order in which it is demanded. FIFO&#x27;s opposite is LIFO, last-in-first-out, where the youngest entry or &quot;top of the stack&quot; is processed first. A priority queue is neither FIFO or LIFO but may adopt similar behaviour temporarily or by default. Queueing theory encompasses these methods for processing data structures, as well as interactions between strict-FIFO queues.

== Computer science ==
Depending on the application, a FIFO could be implemented as a hardware shift register, or using different memory structures, typically a circular buffer or a kind of list. For information on the abstract data structure, see Queue (data structure). Most software implementations of a FIFO queue are not thread safe and require a locking mechanism to verify the data structure chain is being manipulated by only one thread at a time.

The following code shows a linked list FIFO C++ language implementation. In practice, a number of list implementations exist, including popular Unix systems C sys/queue.h macros or the C++ standard library std::list template, avoiding the need for implementing the data structure from scratch.
#include &lt;memory&gt;
#include &lt;stdexcept&gt;

using namespace std;

template &lt;typename T&gt;
class FIFO {
 struct Node {
 T value;
 shared_ptr&lt;Node&gt; next = nullptr;

 Node(T _value): value(_value) {}

 shared_ptr&lt;Node&gt; front = nullptr;
 shared_ptr&lt;Node&gt; back = nullptr;

public:
 void enqueue(T _value) {
 if (front == nullptr) {
 front = make_shared&lt;Node&gt;(_value);
 back = front;
 } else {
 back-&gt;next = make_shared&lt;Node&gt;(_value);
 back = back-&gt;next;
 }

 T dequeue() {
 if (front == nullptr)
 throw underflow_error(&quot;Nothing to dequeue&quot;);

 T value = front-&gt;value;
 front = move(front-&gt;next);
 return value;
};
In computing environments that support the pipes-and-filters model for interprocess communication, a FIFO is another name for a named pipe.

Disk controllers can use the FIFO as a disk scheduling algorithm to determine the order in which to service disk I/O requests, where it is also known by the same FCFS initialism as for CPU scheduling mentioned before.

Communication network bridges, switches and routers used in computer networks use FIFOs to hold data packets in route to their next destination. Typically at least one FIFO structure is used per network connection. Some devices feature multiple FIFOs for simultaneously and independently queuing different types of information.

== Electronics ==
FIFOs are commonly used in electronic circuits for buffering and flow control between hardware and software. In its hardware form, a FIFO primarily consists of a set of read and write pointers, storage and control logic. Storage may be static random access memory (SRAM), flip-flops, latches or any other suitable form of storage. For FIFOs of non-trivial size, a dual-port SRAM is usually used, where one port is dedicated to writing and the other to reading.

The first known FIFO implemented in electronics was by Peter Alfke in 1969 at Fairchild Semiconductor. Alfke was later a director at Xilinx.

=== Synchronicity ===
A synchronous FIFO is a FIFO where the same clock is used for both reading and writing. An asynchronous FIFO uses different clocks for reading and writing and they can introduce metastability issues. A common implementation of an asynchronous FIFO uses a Gray code (or any unit distance code) for the read and write pointers to ensure reliable flag generation. One further note concerning flag generation is that one must necessarily use pointer arithmetic to generate flags for asynchronous FIFO implementations. Conversely, one may use either a leaky bucket approach or pointer arithmetic to generate flags in synchronous FIFO implementations.

A hardware FIFO is used for synchronization purposes. It is often implemented as a circular queue, and thus has two pointers:
* Read pointer / read address register
* Write pointer / write address register

=== Status flags ===

Examples of FIFO status flags include: full, empty, almost full, and almost empty. A FIFO is empty when the read address register reaches the write address register. A FIFO is full when the write address register reaches the read address register. Read and write addresses are initially both at the first memory location and the FIFO queue is &quot;empty&quot;.

In both cases, the read and write addresses end up being equal. To distinguish between the two situations, a simple and robust solution is to add one extra bit for each read and write address which is inverted each time the address wraps. With this set up, the disambiguation conditions are:
* When the read address register equals the write address register, the FIFO is empty.
* When the read and write address registers differ only in the extra most significant bit and the rest are equal, the FIFO is full.

<text>A firewall is a fire-resistant barrier used to prevent the spread of fire. Firewalls are built between or through buildings, structures, or electrical substation transformers, or within an aircraft or vehicle.

==Applications==
Firewalls can be used to subdivide a building into separate fire areas and are constructed in accordance with the locally applicable building codes. Firewalls are a portion of a building&#x27;s passive fire protection systems.

Firewalls can be used to separate-high value transformers at an electrical substation in the event of a mineral oil tank rupture and ignition. The firewall serves as a fire containment wall between one oil-filled transformer and other neighboring transformers, building structures, and site equipment.

==Types==

There are three main classifications of &quot;fire rated walls&quot;: fire walls, fire barriers, and fire partitions. 
*A &quot;firewall&quot; is an assembly of materials used to delay the spread of fire a wall assembly with a prescribed fire resistance duration and independent structural stability. This allows a building to be subdivided into smaller sections. If a section becomes structurally unstable due to fire or other causes, that section can break or fall away from the other sections in the building. 
*A &quot;fire barrier wall&quot;, or a &quot;fire partition&quot;, is a fire-rated wall assembly that are not structurally self-sufficient. 

Fire barrier walls are typically continuous from an exterior wall to an exterior wall, or from a floor below to a floor or roof above, or from one fire barrier wall to another fire barrier wall, having a fire resistance rating equal to or greater than the required rating for the application. Fire barriers are continuous through concealed spaces (e.g., above a ceiling) to the floor deck or roof deck above the barrier. Fire partitions are not required to extend through concealed spaces if the construction assembly forming the bottom of the concealed space, such as the ceiling, has a fire resistance rating at least equal to or greater than the fire partition.
*A &quot;high challenge fire wall&quot; is a wall used to subdivide a building with high fire challenge occupancies, having enhanced fire resistance ratings and enhanced appurtenance protection to prevent the spread of fire, and having structural stability.

Portions of structures that are subdivided by fire walls are permitted to be considered separate buildings, in that fire walls have sufficient structural stability to maintain the integrity of the wall in the event of the collapse of the building construction on either side of the wall.

==Characteristics==
*Fire rating - Fire walls are constructed in such a way as to achieve a code-determined fire-resistance rating, thus forming part of a fire compartment&#x27;s passive fire protection. Germany includes repeated impact force testing upon new fire wall systems. Other codes require impact resistance on a performance basis
*Design loads – Fire wall must withstand a minimum , and additional seismic loads.
*Substation transformer firewalls are typically free-standing modular walls custom designed and engineered to meet application needs.
*Building fire walls typically extend through the roof and terminate at a code-determined height above it. They are usually finished off on the top with flashing (sheet metal cap) for protection against the elements.

===Materials===

*Building and structural fire walls in North America are usually made of concrete, concrete blocks, or reinforced concrete. Older fire walls, built prior to World War II, used brick materials.
*Fire barrier walls are typically constructed of drywall or gypsum board partitions with wood or metal framed studs.
*Penetrations – Penetrations through fire walls, such as for pipes and cables, must be protected with a listed firestop assembly designed to prevent the spread of fire through wall penetrations. Penetrations (holes) must not defeat the structural integrity of the wall, such that the wall cannot withstand the prescribed fire duration without threat of collapse.
*Openings – Other openings in fire walls, such as doors and windows, must also be fire-rated &quot;fire door assemblies&quot; and &quot;fire window assemblies&quot;.

==Performance based design==
Firewalls are used in varied applications that require specific design and performance specifications. Knowing the potential conditions that may exist during a fire are critical to selecting and installing an effective firewall. For example, a firewall designed to meet National Fire Protection Agency, (NFPA), 221-09 section A.5.7 which indicates an average temperature of , is not designed to withstand higher temperatures such as would be present in higher challenge fires, and as a result would fail to function for the expected duration of the listed wall rating.

Performance based design takes into account the potential conditions during a fire. Understanding thermal limitations of materials is essential to using the correct material for the application. Laboratory testing is used to simulate fire scenarios and wall loading conditions. The testing results in an assigned listing number for the fire-rated assembly that defines the expected fire resistance duration and wall structural integrity under the tested conditions. Designers may elect to specify a listed fire wall assembly or design a wall system that would require performance testing to certify the expected protections before use of the designed fire-rated wall system.

==High-voltage transformer fire barriers==

Fire barriers are used around large electrical transformers as firewalls. 
These barriers are used to isolate one transformer in case of fire or explosions, preventing fire propagation to neighboring transformers.

<doc id="11353" wikidata="Q131654" url="?curid=11353" title="Frigg">
<text>Frigg (; Old Norse: ) is a goddess, one of the Æsir, in Germanic mythology. In Norse mythology, the source of most surviving information about her, she is associated with marriage, prophecy, clairvoyance and motherhood, and dwells in the wetland halls of Fensalir. In wider Germanic mythology, she is known in Old High German as &#x27;, in Langobardic as &#x27;, in Old English as &#x27;, in Old Frisian as Frīa, and in Old Saxon as &#x27;, all ultimately stemming from the Proto-Germanic theonym *&quot;Frijjō&quot;. Nearly all sources portray her as the wife of the god Odin.

In Old High German and Old Norse sources, she is specifically connected with Fulla, but she is also associated with the goddesses Lofn, Hlín, Gná, and ambiguously with the Earth, otherwise personified as an apparently separate entity Jörð (Old Norse: &#x27;Earth&#x27;). The children of Frigg and Odin include the gleaming god Baldr.

The English weekday name Friday (ultimately meaning &#x27;Frigg&#x27;s Day&#x27;) bears her name. After Christianization, the mention of Frigg continued to occur in Scandinavian folklore. During modern times, Frigg has appeared in popular culture, has been the subject of art and receives veneration in Germanic Neopaganism.

==Name and origin==
=== Etymology ===
The theonyms &quot;Frigg&quot; (Old Norse), &quot;Frīja&quot; (Old High German), &quot;Frīg&quot; (Old English), &quot;Frīa&quot; (Old Frisian), and &quot;Frī&quot; (Old Saxon) are cognates (linguistic siblings from the same origin). They stem from the Proto-Germanic feminine noun &quot;*Frijjō&quot;, which emerged as a substantivized form of the adjective *&quot;frijaz&quot; (&#x27;free&#x27;) via Holtzmann&#x27;s law. In a clan-based societal system, the meaning &#x27;free&#x27; arose from the meaning &#x27;related&#x27;. The name is indeed etymologically close to the Sanskrit &quot;priyā&quot; and the Avestan &quot;fryā&quot; (&#x27;own, dear, beloved&#x27;), all ultimately descending from the Proto-Indo-European stem *&quot;priH-o-&quot;, denoting &#x27;one&#x27;s own, beloved&#x27;. The Proto-Germanic verb &quot;*frijōnan&quot; (&#x27;to love&#x27;), as well as the nouns *&quot;frijōndz&quot; (&#x27;friend&#x27;) and *&quot;frijađwō&quot; (&#x27;friendship, peace&#x27;), are also related.

An -a suffix has been sometimes applied by modern editors to denote femininity, resulting in the form &quot;Frigga&quot;. This spelling also serves the purpose of distancing the goddess from the English word &quot;frig&quot;, with a primary meaning of masturbate or to the common alternative to the English profanity &quot;fuck&quot;. Several place names refer to Frigg in what are now Norway and Sweden, although her name is altogether absent in recorded place names in Denmark.

=== Origin of Frigg ===
The connection with and possible earlier identification of the goddess Freyja with Frigg in the Proto-Germanic period is a matter of scholarly debate (see Frigg and Freyja common origin hypothesis). Like the name of the group of gods to which Freyja belongs, the Vanir, the name &quot;Freyja&quot; is not attested outside of Scandinavia. This is in contrast to the name of the goddess &quot;Frigg&quot;, who is also attested as a goddess among West Germanic peoples. Evidence is lacking for the existence of a common Germanic goddess from which Old Norse &quot;Freyja&quot; descends, but scholars have commented that this may simply be due to the scarcity of surviving sources.

Regarding the Freyja–Frigg common origin hypothesis, scholar Stephan Grundy writes that &quot;the problem of whether Frigg or Freyja may have been a single goddess originally is a difficult one, made more so by the scantiness of pre-Viking Age references to Germanic goddesses, and the diverse quality of the sources. The best that can be done is to survey the arguments for and against their identity, and to see how well each can be supported.&quot;

=== Origin of &quot;Friday&quot; ===
The English weekday name &quot;Friday&quot; comes from Old English &quot;Frīġedæġ&quot;, meaning &#x27;day of Frig&#x27;. It is cognate with Old Frisian &quot;Frīadei&quot; (≈ &quot;Fri(g)endei&quot;), Middle Dutch &quot;Vridach&quot; (≈ &quot;Vriendach&quot;), Middle Low German &quot;Vrīdach&quot; (≈ &quot;Vrīgedach&quot;), and Old High German &quot;Frîatac&quot;. The Old Norse &quot;Frjádagr&quot; was borrowed from a West Germanic language. All of these terms derive from Late Proto-Germanic *&quot;Frijjōdag&quot; (&#x27;Day of Frijjō&#x27;), a calque of Latin &quot;Veneris dies&quot; (&#x27;Day of Venus&#x27;; cf. modern Italian &quot;venerdì&quot;, French &quot;vendredi&quot;, Spanish &quot;viernes&quot;).

The Germanic goddess&#x27; name has substituted for the Roman name of a comparable deity, a practice known as &quot;interpretatio germanica&quot;. Although the Old English theonym &quot;Frīg&quot; is only found in the name of the weekday, it is also attested as a common noun in &quot;frīg&quot; (&#x27;love, affections [plural], embraces [in poetry]&#x27;). The Old Norse weekday &quot;Freyjudagr&quot;, a rare synonym of &quot;Frjádagr&quot;, saw the replacement of the first element with the genitive of &quot;Freyja&quot;.

===&quot;Origo Gentis Langobardorum&quot; and &quot;Historia Langobardorum&quot;===
The 7th-century &quot;Origo Gentis Langobardorum&quot;, and Paul the Deacon&#x27;s 8th-century &quot;Historia Langobardorum&quot; derived from it, recount a founding myth of the Langobards, a Germanic people who ruled a region of what is now Italy (see Lombardy). According to this legend, a &quot;small people&quot; known as the &quot;Winnili&quot; were ruled by a woman named Gambara who had two sons, Ybor and Agio. The Vandals, ruled by Ambri and Assi, came to the Winnili with their army and demanded that they pay them tribute or prepare for war. Ybor, Agio, and their mother Gambara rejected their demands for tribute. Ambra and Assi then asked the god Godan for victory over the Winnili, to which Godan responded (in the longer version in the &quot;Origo&quot;): &quot;Whom I shall first see when at sunrise, to them will I give the victory.&quot;

Meanwhile, Ybor and Agio called upon Frea, Godan&#x27;s wife. Frea counseled them that &quot;at sunrise the Winnil[i] should come, and that their women, with their hair let down around the face in the likeness of a beard should also come with their husbands&quot;. At sunrise, Frea turned Godan&#x27;s bed around to face east and woke him. Godan saw the Winnili, including their whiskered women, and asked &quot;who are those Long-beards?&quot; Frea responded to Godan, &quot;As you have given them a name, give them also the victory&quot;. Godan did so, &quot;so that they should defend themselves according to his counsel and obtain the victory&quot;. Thenceforth the Winnili were known as the &quot;Langobards&quot; (Langobardic &quot;long-beards&quot;).

===Second Merseburg Incantation===

A 10th-century manuscript found in what is now Merseburg, Germany, features an invocation known as the Second Merseburg Incantation. The incantation calls upon various continental Germanic gods, including Old High German Frija and a goddess associated with her—Volla, to assist in healing a horse:
===&quot;Poetic Edda&quot;===

In the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot;, compiled during the 13th century from earlier traditional material, Frigg is mentioned in the poems &quot;Völuspá&quot;, &quot;Vafþrúðnismál&quot;, the prose of &quot;Grímnismál&quot;, &quot;Lokasenna&quot;, and &quot;Oddrúnargrátr&quot;.

Frigg receives three mentions in the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot; poem &quot;Völuspá&quot;. In the first mention the poem recounts that Frigg wept for the death of her son Baldr in Fensalir. Later in the poem, when the future death of Odin is foretold, Odin is referred to as the &quot;beloved of Frigg&quot; and his future death is referred to as the &quot;second grief of Frigg&quot;. Like the reference to Frigg weeping in Fensalir earlier in the poem, the implied &quot;first grief&quot; is a reference to the grief she felt upon the death of her son, Baldr.
Frigg plays a prominent role in the prose introduction to the poem, &quot;Grímnismál&quot;. The introduction recounts that two sons of king Hrauðungr, Agnar (age 10) and Geirröðr (age 8), once sailed out with a trailing line to catch small fish, but wind drove them out into the ocean and, during the darkness of night, their boat wrecked. The brothers went ashore, where they met a crofter. They stayed on the croft for one winter, during which the couple separately fostered the two children: the old woman fostered Agnar and the old man fostered Geirröðr. Upon the arrival of spring, the old man brought them a ship. The old couple took the boys to the shore, and the old man took Geirröðr aside and spoke to him. The boys entered the boat and a breeze came.

The boat returned to the harbor of their father. Geirröðr, forward in the ship, jumped to shore and pushed the boat, containing his brother, out and said &quot;go where an evil spirit may get thee.&quot; Away went the ship and Geirröðr walked to a house, where he was greeted with joy; while the boys were gone, their father had died, and now Geirröðr was king. He &quot;became a splendid man.&quot; The scene switches to Odin and Frigg sitting in Hliðskjálf, &quot;look[ing] into all the worlds.&quot; Odin says: &quot;&#x27;Seest thou Agnar, thy foster-son, where he is getting children a giantess [Old Norse &quot;gȳgi&quot;] in a cave? while Geirröd, my foster son, is a king residing in his country.&#x27; Frigg answered, &#x27;He is so inhospitable that he tortures his guests, if he thinks that too many come.&#x27;&quot;

Odin replied that this was a great untruth and so the two made a wager. Frigg sent her &quot;waiting-maid&quot; Fulla to warn Geirröðr to be wary, lest a wizard who seeks him should harm him, and that he would know this wizard by the refusal of dogs, no matter how ferocious, to attack the stranger. While it was not true that Geirröðr was inhospitable with his guests, Geirröðr did as instructed and had the wizard arrested. Upon being questioned, the wizard, wearing a blue cloak, said no more than that his name is &quot;Grímnir&quot;. Geirröðr has Grímnir tortured and sits him between two fires for 8 nights. Upon the 9th night, Grímnir is brought a full drinking horn by Geirröðr&#x27;s son, Agnar (so named after Geirröðr&#x27;s brother), and the poem continues without further mention or involvement of Frigg.

In the poem &quot;Lokasenna&quot;, where Loki accuses nearly every female in attendance of promiscuity and/or unfaithfulness, an aggressive exchange occurs between the god Loki and the goddess Frigg (and thereafter between Loki and the goddess Freyja about Frigg). A prose introduction to the poem describes that numerous gods and goddesses attended a banquet held by Ægir. These gods and goddesses include Odin and, &quot;his wife&quot;, Frigg.

===&quot;Prose Edda&quot;===

Frigg is mentioned throughout the &quot;Prose Edda&quot;, compiled in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson. Frigg is first mentioned in the &quot;Prose Edda&quot; Prologue, wherein a euhemerized account of the Norse gods is provided. The author describes Frigg as the wife of Odin, and, in a case of folk etymology, the author attempts to associate the name &quot;Frigg&quot; with the Latin-influenced form &quot;Frigida&quot;. The Prologue adds that both Frigg and Odin &quot;had the gift of prophecy.&quot;

In the next section of the &quot;Prose Edda&quot;, &quot;Gylfaginning&quot;, High tells Gangleri (the king Gylfi in disguise) that Frigg, daughter of Fjörgynn (Old Norse &quot;Fjörgynsdóttir&quot;) is married to Odin and that the Æsir are descended from the couple, and adds that &quot;the earth [&quot;Jörðin&quot;] was [Odin&#x27;s] daughter and his wife.&quot; According to High, the two had many sons, the first of which was the mighty god Thor.
Later in &quot;Gylfaginning&quot;, Gangleri asks about the &quot;ásynjur&quot;, a term for Norse goddesses. High says that &quot;highest&quot; among them is Frigg and that only Freyja &quot;is highest in rank next to her.&quot; Frigg dwells in Fensalir &quot;and it is very splendid.&quot; In this section of &quot;Gylfaginning&quot;, Frigg is also mentioned in connection to other &quot;ásynjur&quot;: Fulla carries Frigg&#x27;s ashen box, &quot;looks after her footwear and shares her secrets;&quot; Lofn is given special permission by Frigg and Odin to &quot;arrange unions&quot; among men and women; Hlín is charged by Frigg to protect those that Frigg deem worthy of keeping from danger; and Gná is sent by Frigg &quot;into various worlds to carry out her business.&quot;

In section 49 of &quot;Gylfaginning&quot;, a narrative about the fate of Frigg&#x27;s son Baldr is told. According to High, Baldr once started to have dreams indicating that his life was in danger. When Baldr told his fellow Æsir about his dreams, the gods met together for a thing and decided that they should &quot;request immunity for Baldr from all kinds of danger.&quot; Frigg subsequently receives promises from the elements, the environment, diseases, animals, and stones, amongst other things. The request successful, the Æsir make sport of Baldr&#x27;s newfound invincibility; shot or struck, Baldr remained unharmed. However, Loki discovers this and is not pleased by this turn of events, so, in the form of a woman, he goes to Frigg in Fensalir.

There, Frigg asks this female visitor what the Æsir are up to assembled at the thing. The woman says that all of the Æsir are shooting at Baldr and yet he remains unharmed. Frigg explains that &quot;Weapons and wood will not hurt Baldr. I have received oaths from them all.&quot; The woman asks Frigg if all things have sworn not to hurt Baldr, to which Frigg notes one exception; &quot;there grows a shoot of a tree to the west of Val-hall. It is called mistletoe. It seemed young to me to demand the oath from.&quot; Loki immediately disappears.
Now armed with mistletoe, Loki arrives at the thing where the Æsir are assembled and tricks the blind Höðr, Baldr&#x27;s brother, into shooting Baldr with a mistletoe projectile. To the horror of the assembled gods, the mistletoe goes directly through Baldr, killing him. Standing in horror and shock, the gods are initially only able to weep due to their grief. Frigg speaks up and asks &quot;who there was among the Æsir who wished to earn all her love and favour and was willing to ride the road to Hel and try if he could find Baldr, and offer Hel a ransom if she would let Baldr go back to Asgard.&quot;

Hermóðr, Baldr&#x27;s brother, accepts Frigg&#x27;s request and rides to Hel. Meanwhile, Baldr is given a grand funeral attended by many beings—foremost mentioned of which are his mother and father, Frigg and Odin. During the funeral, Nanna dies of grief and is placed in the funeral pyre with Baldr, her dead husband. Hermóðr locates Baldr and Nanna in Hel. Hermodr secures an agreement for the return of Baldr and with Hermóðr Nanna sends gifts to Frigg (a linen robe) and Fulla (a finger-ring). Hermóðr rides back to the Æsir and tells them what has happened. However, the agreement fails due to the sabotage of a jötunn in a cave named Þökk (Old Norse &#x27;thanks&#x27;), described as perhaps Loki in disguise.

Frigg is mentioned several times in the &quot;Prose Edda&quot; section &quot;Skáldskaparmál&quot;. The first mention occurs at the beginning of the section, where the Æsir and Ásynjur are said to have once held a banquet in a hall in a land of gods, Asgard. Frigg is one of the twelve ásynjur in attendance.

===&quot;Heimskringla&quot; and sagas===
In &quot;Ynglinga saga&quot;, the first book of &quot;Heimskringla&quot;, a Euhemerized account of the origin of the gods is provided. Frigg is mentioned once. According to the saga, while Odin was away, Odin&#x27;s brothers Vili and Vé oversaw Odin&#x27;s holdings. Once, while Odin was gone for an extended period, the Æsir concluded that he was not coming back. His brothers started to divvy up Odin&#x27;s inheritance, &quot;but his wife Frigg they shared between them. However, a short while afterwards, [Odin] returned and took possession of his wife again.

In &quot;Völsunga saga&quot;, the great king Rerir and his wife (unnamed) are unable to conceive a child; &quot;that lack displeased them both, and they fervently implored the gods that they might have a child. It is said that Frigg heard their prayers and told Odin what they asked.&quot;

==Archaeological record==

A 12th century depiction of a cloaked but otherwise nude woman riding a large cat appears on a wall in the Schleswig Cathedral in Schleswig-Holstein, Northern Germany. Beside her is similarly a cloaked yet otherwise nude woman riding a distaff. Due to iconographic similarities to the literary record, these figures have been theorized as depictions of Freyja and Frigg respectively.

==Scholarly reception and interpretation==

Due to numerous similarities, some scholars have proposed that the Old Norse goddesses Frigg and Freyja descend from a common entity from the Proto-Germanic period. Regarding a Freyja-Frigg common origin hypothesis, scholar Stephan Grundy comments that &quot;the problem of whether Frigg or Freyja may have been a single goddess originally is a difficult one, made more so by the scantiness of pre-Viking Age references to Germanic goddesses, and the diverse quality of the sources. The best that can be done is to survey the arguments for and against their identity, and to see how well each can be supported.&quot;

Unlike Frigg but like the name of the group of gods to which Freyja belongs, the Vanir, the name &quot;Freyja&quot; is not attested outside of Scandinavia, as opposed to the name of the goddess &quot;Frigg&quot;, who is attested as a goddess common among the Germanic peoples, and whose name is reconstructed as Proto-Germanic *&quot;Frijjō&quot;. Similar proof for the existence of a common Germanic goddess from which &quot;Freyja&quot; descends does not exist, but scholars have commented that this may simply be due to the scarcity of evidence outside of the North Germanic record.

==Modern influence==
Frigg is referenced in art and literature into the modern period. In the 18th century, Gustav III of Sweden, king of Sweden, composed &quot;Friggja&quot;, a play, so named after the goddess, and H. F. Block and Hans Friedrich Blunck&#x27;s &quot;Frau Frigg und Doktor Faust&quot; in 1937. Other examples include fine art works by K. Ehrenberg (&quot;Frigg, Freyja&quot;, drawing, 1883), John Charles Dollman (&quot;Frigga Spinning the Clouds&quot;, painting, c. 1900), Emil Doepler (&quot;Wodan und Frea am Himmelsfenster&quot;, painting, 1901), and H. Thoma (&quot;Fricka&quot;, drawing, date not provided).
