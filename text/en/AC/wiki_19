<text>Frederick Charles Copleston (10 April 1907 – 3 February 1994) was a British Jesuit priest, philosopher, and historian of philosophy, best known for his influential multi-volume &quot;A History of Philosophy&quot; (1946–75).

Copleston achieved a degree of popularity in the media for debating the existence of God with Bertrand Russell in a celebrated 1948 BBC broadcast; the following year he debated logical positivism and the meaningfulness of religious language with his friend the analytic philosopher A. J. Ayer.

==Origins==
Frederick Charles Copleston was born on 10 April 1907 at Claremont in the parish of Trull, near Taunton in Somerset, England, the eldest son of Frederick Selwyn Copleston (1850–1935), a judge of the High Court in Rangoon, Burma, by his second wife, Norah Margaret Little. He was a member of the family of Copleston, lords of the manor of Copleston in Devon until 1659, one of the most ancient in that county according to a traditional rhyme related by John Prince (d.1723):

&quot;Crocker, Cruwys, and Coplestone&quot;,
 &quot;When the Conqueror came were at home&quot; 
==Biography==
He was raised an Anglican—his uncle, Reginald Stephen Copleston, was an Anglican bishop of Calcutta; another uncle, Ernest Copleston, was the Anglican Bishop of Colombo. Copleston was educated at Marlborough College from 1920 to 1925. At the age of eighteen, he converted to the Roman Catholic faith, which caused a great deal of stress in his family. Copleston explained his recognition of the objective authority in the Catholic Church:&quot;It seemed to me that if Christ was truly the Son of God and if he founded a Church to teach all nations in His name, it must be a Church teaching with authority, as her Master did. Obviously one might deny that Christ was the Son of God, and one might reject the claim that he founded a Church. But if these two claims were accepted, it seemed to me that in spite of all its faults the Roman Catholic Church was the only one which could reasonably be thought to have developed out of what Christ established.&quot; His father, though opposed to his son&#x27;s becoming a Catholic, helped him complete his education at St John&#x27;s College, Oxford, where he studied from 1925 to 1929. He graduated from Oxford University in 1929 having managed a third in classical moderations and a good second at Greats. After Oxford, Copleston entered St. Mary&#x27;s College, Oscott as a seminarian for the diocese of Clifton, but realized the life was not for him.

In 1930, he entered instead the Jesuits. After completing the two-year Jesuit novitiate in Roehampton, he followed the traditional course of studies for the priesthood at the Jesuit house of studies in Heythrop, Oxfordshire and in 1937 he was ordained a Jesuit priest there. In 1938 he travelled to Germany to complete his training, returning to Britain just before the outbreak of war in 1939. Copleston was originally destined to study for his doctorate at the Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome, but the war now made that impossible. Instead, he accepted a posting that saw him return to Heythrop in Oxfordshire to teach the history of philosophy to the few Jesuits remaining there.

From this time onwards, Copleston began writing his influential multi-volume &quot;A History of Philosophy&quot; (1946–75), a textbook that presents clear accounts of ancient, medieval, and modern philosophy. Still highly respected, Copleston&#x27;s history has been described as &quot;a monumental achievement&quot; that &quot;stays true to the authors it discusses, being very much a work in exposition&quot;.

Copleston achieved a degree of popularity in the media for debating the existence of God with Bertrand Russell in a celebrated 1948 BBC broadcast. (See Copleston–Russell debate). The following year he debated logical positivism and the meaningfulness of religious language with his friend the analytic philosopher A. J. Ayer.

Throughout the rest of his academic career, Copleston accepted a number of prestigious titles, including visiting professor at Rome&#x27;s Gregorian University, where he spent six months each year lecturing from 1952 to 1968. In 1970 the Jesuit Heythrop house of studies was relocated to London, where as Heythrop College it became a constituent part of the federal University of London. Copleston became the new college&#x27;s respected principal and gave undergraduate courses. His uncontestable mastery of his material immediately won the confidence and respect of the students, who were drawn from among younger Jesuits and junior religious from male and female religious orders, and some lay men and women. Moreover, his affable manner, dry humour and unfailing courtesy made him popular. In that same year 1970, he was made Fellow of the British Academy (FBA), and in 1972 he was given a personal professorship by the University of London. In 1975, he was made an Honorary Fellow of St. John&#x27;s College, Oxford.

After officially retiring in 1974, he continued to lecture. From 1974 to 1982, Copleston was visiting professor at the University of Santa Clara, California, and from 1979 to 1981, he delivered the Gifford Lectures at the University of Aberdeen, Scotland, which were published as &quot;Religion and the One&quot;. These lectures attempted to &quot;express themes perennial in his thinking and more personal than in his history&quot;. Toward the end of his life, Copleston received honorary doctorates from a number of institutions, including Santa Clara University, California, Uppsala University, and the University of St Andrews.

Copleston was offered memberships in the Royal Institute of Philosophy and in the Aristotelian Society. In 1993 he was made CBE. Father Frederick Copleston died on 3 February 1994 at St Thomas&#x27; Hospital in London, at the age of 86.

==Legacy==
In addition to his influential multi-volume &quot;History of Philosophy&quot; (1946–75), one of Copleston&#x27;s most significant contributions to modern philosophy was his work on the theories of Saint Thomas Aquinas. He attempted to clarify Aquinas&#x27;s Five Ways (in the &quot;Summa Theologica&quot;) by making a distinction between &quot;in fieri&quot; causes and &quot;in esse&quot; causes. By doing so, Copleston makes clear that Aquinas wanted to put forth the concept of an omnipresent God rather than a being that could have disappeared after setting the chain of cause and effect into motion.

<doc id="11162" wikidata="Q43015" url="?curid=11162" title="Finance">
<text>Finance refers to monetary resources and to the study and discipline of money, currency, assets and liabilities. As a subject of study, it is related to but distinct from economics, which is the study of the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services. Based on the scope of financial activities in financial systems, the discipline can be divided into personal, corporate, and public finance.

In these financial systems, assets are bought, sold, or traded as financial instruments, such as currencies, loans, bonds, shares, stocks, options, futures, etc. Assets can also be banked, invested, and insured to maximize value and minimize loss. In practice, risks are always present in any financial action and entities.

Due to its wide scope, a broad range of subfields exists within finance. Asset-, money-, risk- and investment management aim to maximize value and minimize volatility. Financial analysis assesses the viability, stability, and profitability of an action or entity. Some fields are multidisciplinary, such as mathematical finance, financial law, financial economics, financial engineering and financial technology. These fields are the foundation of business and accounting. In some cases, theories in finance can be tested using the scientific method, covered by experimental finance.

The early history of finance parallels the early history of money, which is prehistoric. Ancient and medieval civilizations incorporated basic functions of finance, such as banking, trading and accounting, into their economies. In the late 19th century, the global financial system was formed.

In the middle of the 20th century, finance emerged as a distinct academic discipline, separate from economics. The earliest doctoral programs in finance were established in the 1960s and 1970s. Today, finance is also widely studied through career-focused undergraduate and master&#x27;s level programs.

==The financial system==



As outlined, the financial system consists of the flows of capital that take place between individuals and households (personal finance), governments (public finance), and businesses (corporate finance). &quot;Finance&quot; thus studies the process of channeling money from savers and investors to entities that need it.Savers and investors have money available which could earn interest or dividends if put to productive use. Individuals, companies and governments must obtain money from some external source, such as loans or credit, when they lack sufficient funds to run their operations.

In general, an entity whose income exceeds its expenditure can lend or invest the excess, intending to earn a fair return. Correspondingly, an entity where income is less than expenditure can raise capital usually in one of two ways: (i) by borrowing in the form of a loan (private individuals), or by selling government or corporate bonds; (ii) by a corporation selling equity, also called stock or shares (which may take various forms: preferred stock or common stock). The owners of both bonds and stock may be &quot;institutional investors&quot;—financial institutions such as investment banks and pension funds—or private individuals, called &quot;private investors&quot; or &quot;retail investors.&quot; (See Financial market participants.)

The lending is often indirect, through a financial intermediary such as a bank, or via the purchase of notes or bonds (corporate bonds, government bonds, or mutual bonds) in the bond market. The lender receives interest, the borrower pays a higher interest than the lender receives, and the financial intermediary earns the difference for arranging the loan.
A bank aggregates the activities of many borrowers and lenders. A bank accepts deposits from lenders, on which it pays interest. The bank then lends these deposits to borrowers. Banks allow borrowers and lenders, of different sizes, to coordinate their activity.

Investing typically entails the purchase of stock, either individual securities or via a mutual fund, for example. Stocks are usually sold by corporations to investors so as to raise required capital in the form of &quot;equity financing&quot;, as distinct from the &quot;debt financing&quot; described above. The financial intermediaries here are the investment banks. The investment banks find the initial investors and facilitate the listing of the securities, typically shares and bonds. Additionally, they facilitate the securities exchanges, which allow their trade thereafter, as well as the various service providers which manage the performance or risk of these investments. These latter include mutual funds, pension funds, wealth managers, and stock brokers, typically servicing retail investors (private individuals).

Inter-institutional trade and investment, and fund-management at this scale, is referred to as &quot;wholesale finance&quot;. 
Institutions here extend the products offered, with related trading, to include bespoke options, swaps, and structured products, as well as specialized financing; this &quot;financial engineering&quot; is inherently mathematical, and these institutions are then the major employers of &quot;quants&quot; (see below). In these institutions, risk management, regulatory capital, and compliance play major roles.
==Areas of finance==
As outlined, finance comprises, broadly, the three areas of personal finance, corporate finance, and public finance.These, in turn, overlap and employ various activities and sub-disciplines—chiefly investments, risk management, and quantitative finance.

===Personal finance===

Personal finance refers to the practice of budgeting to ensure enough funds are available to meet basic needs, while ensuring there is only a reasonable level of risk to lose said capital. Personal finance may involve paying for education, financing durable goods such as real estate and cars, buying insurance, investing, and saving for retirement. Personal finance may also involve paying for a loan or other debt obligations. The main areas of personal finance are considered to be income, spending, saving, investing, and protection. The following steps, as outlined by the Financial Planning Standards Board, suggest that an individual will understand a potentially secure personal finance plan after:
* Purchasing insurance to ensure protection against unforeseen personal events;
* Understanding the effects of tax policies, subsidies, or penalties on the management of personal finances;
* Understanding the effects of credit on individual financial standing;
* Developing a savings plan or financing for large purchases (auto, education, home);
* Planning a secure financial future in an environment of economic instability;
* Pursuing a checking or a savings account;
* Preparing for retirement or other long term expenses.

===Corporate finance===
Corporate finance deals with the actions that managers take to increase the value of the firm to the shareholders, the sources of funding and the capital structure of corporations, and the tools and analysis used to allocate financial resources. While corporate finance is in principle different from managerial finance, which studies the financial management of all firms rather than corporations alone, the concepts are applicable to the financial problems of all firms, and this area is then often referred to as &quot;business finance&quot;.

Typically, &quot;corporate finance&quot; relates to the &quot;long term&quot; objective of maximizing the value of the entity&#x27;s assets, its stock, and its return to shareholders, while also balancing risk and profitability. This entails three primary areas: 
#Capital budgeting: selecting which projects to invest in—here, accurately determining value is crucial, as judgements about asset values can be &quot;make or break&quot;.
#Dividend policy: the use of &quot;excess&quot; funds—these are to be reinvested in the business or returned to shareholders.
#Capital structure: deciding on the mix of funding to be used—here attempting to find the optimal capital mix re debt-commitments vs cost of capital.
The latter creates the link with investment banking and securities trading, as above, in that the capital raised will generically comprise debt, i.e. corporate bonds, and equity, often listed shares. Re risk management within corporates, see below.

Financial managers—i.e. as distinct from corporate financiers—focus more on the &quot;short term&quot; elements of profitability, cash flow, and &quot;working capital management&quot; (inventory, credit and debtors), ensuring that the firm can safely and profitably carry out its financial &quot;and operational&quot; objectives; i.e. that it: (1) can service both maturing short-term debt repayments, and scheduled long-term debt payments, and (2) has sufficient cash flow for ongoing and upcoming operational expenses. (See Financial management and FP&amp;A.)
===Public finance===


Public finance describes finance as related to sovereign states, sub-national entities, and related public entities or agencies. It generally encompasses a long-term strategic perspective regarding investment decisions that affect public entities. These long-term strategic periods typically encompass five or more years. Public finance is primarily concerned with:
* Identification of required expenditures of a public sector entity;
* Source(s) of that entity&#x27;s revenue;
* The budgeting process;
* Sovereign debt issuance, or municipal bonds for public works projects.

Central banks, such as the Federal Reserve System banks in the United States and the Bank of England in the United Kingdom, are strong players in public finance. They act as lenders of last resort as well as strong influences on monetary and credit conditions in the economy.

Development finance, which is related, concerns investment in economic development projects provided by a (quasi) governmental institution on a non-commercial basis; these projects would otherwise not be able to get financing. A public–private partnership is primarily used for infrastructure projects: a private sector corporate provides the financing up-front, and then draws profits from taxpayers or users.
Climate finance, and the related Environmental finance, address the financial strategies, resources and instruments used in climate change mitigation.

===Investment management===

Investment management is the professional asset management of various securities—typically shares and bonds, but also other assets, such as real estate, commodities and alternative investments—in order to meet specified investment goals for the benefit of investors.

As above, investors may be institutions, such as insurance companies, pension funds, corporations, charities, educational establishments, or private investors, either directly via investment contracts or, more commonly, via collective investment schemes like mutual funds, exchange-traded funds, or real estate investment trusts.

At the heart of investment management is asset allocation—diversifying the exposure among these asset classes, and among individual securities within each asset class—as appropriate to the client&#x27;s investment policy, in turn, a function of risk profile, investment goals, and investment horizon (see Investor profile). Here:
*Portfolio optimization is the process of selecting the best portfolio given the client&#x27;s objectives and constraints. 
*Fundamental analysis is the approach typically applied in valuing and evaluating the individual securities.
*Technical analysis is about forecasting future asset prices with past data.

Overlaid is the portfolio manager&#x27;s investment style—broadly, active vs passive, value vs growth, and small cap vs. large cap—and investment strategy.

In a well-diversified portfolio, achieved investment performance will, in general, largely be a function of the asset mix selected, while the individual securities are less impactful. The specific approach or philosophy will also be significant, depending on the extent to which it is complementary with the market cycle.
Risk management here is discussed immediately below.

A quantitative fund is managed using computer-based mathematical techniques (increasingly, machine learning) instead of human judgment. The actual trading is typically automated via sophisticated algorithms.

===Risk management===

Risk management, in general, is the study of how to control risks and balance the possibility of gains; it is the process of measuring risk and then developing and implementing strategies to manage that risk. 
Financial risk management is the practice of protecting corporate value against financial risks, often by &quot;hedging&quot; exposure to these using financial instruments. The focus is particularly on credit and market risk, and in banks, through regulatory capital, includes operational risk.
*Credit risk is the risk of default on a debt that may arise from a borrower failing to make required payments; 
*Market risk relates to losses arising from movements in market variables such as prices and exchange rates;
*Operational risk relates to failures in internal processes, people, and systems, or to external events. 
Financial risk management is related to corporate finance in two ways. Firstly, firm exposure to market risk is a direct result of previous capital investments and funding decisions; while credit risk arises from the business&#x27;s credit policy and is often addressed through credit insurance and provisioning.Secondly, both disciplines share the goal of enhancing or at least preserving, the firm&#x27;s economic value, and in this context overlaps also enterprise risk management, typically the domain of strategic management. Here, businesses devote much time and effort to forecasting, analytics and performance monitoring. (See ALM and treasury management.)

For banks and other wholesale institutions, risk management focuses on managing, and as necessary hedging, the various positions held by the institution—both trading positions and long term exposures—and on calculating and monitoring the resultant economic capital, and regulatory capital under Basel III. The calculations here are mathematically sophisticated, and within the domain of quantitative finance as below. Credit risk is inherent in the business of banking, but additionally, these institutions are exposed to counterparty credit risk. Banks typically employ Middle office &quot;Risk Groups&quot;, whereas front office risk teams provide risk &quot;services&quot; (or &quot;solutions&quot;) to customers.

Additional to diversification, the fundamental risk mitigant here, investment managers will apply various hedging techniques as appropriate, these may relate to the portfolio as a whole or to individual stocks. Bond portfolios are often (instead) managed via cash flow matching or immunization, while for derivative portfolios and positions, traders use &quot;the Greeks&quot; to measure and then offset sensitivities. In parallel, managers – active and passive – will monitor tracking error, thereby minimizing and preempting any underperformance vs their &quot;benchmark&quot;.

===Quantitative finance===
Quantitative finance—also referred to as &quot;mathematical finance&quot;—includes those finance activities where a sophisticated mathematical model is required, and thus overlaps several of the above.

As a specialized practice area, quantitative finance comprises primarily three sub-disciplines; the underlying theory and techniques are discussed in the next section:
#Quantitative finance is often synonymous with financial engineering. This area generally underpins a bank&#x27;s customer-driven derivatives business—delivering bespoke OTC-contracts and &quot;exotics&quot;, and designing the various structured products and solutions mentioned—and encompasses modeling and programming in support of the initial trade, and its subsequent hedging and management.
#Quantitative finance also significantly overlaps financial risk management in banking, as mentioned, both as regards this hedging, and as regards economic capital as well as compliance with regulations and the Basel capital / liquidity requirements. 
#&quot;Quants&quot; are also responsible for building and deploying the investment strategies at the quantitative funds mentioned; they are also involved in quantitative investing more generally, in areas such as trading strategy formulation, and in automated trading, high-frequency trading, algorithmic trading, and program trading.

==Financial theory==

Financial theory is studied and developed within the disciplines of management, (financial) economics, accountancy and applied mathematics.
In the abstract, &quot;finance&quot; is concerned with the investment and deployment of assets and liabilities over &quot;space and time&quot;; i.e., it is about performing valuation and asset allocation today, based on the risk and uncertainty of future outcomes while appropriately incorporating the time value of money. 
Determining the present value of these future values, &quot;discounting&quot;, must be at the risk-appropriate discount rate, in turn, a major focus of finance-theory.As financial theory has roots in many disciplines, including mathematics, statistics, economics, physics, and psychology, it can be considered a mix of an art and science, and there are ongoing related efforts to organize a list of unsolved problems in finance.

===Managerial finance===

Managerial finance 
is the branch of finance that deals with the financial aspects of the management of a company, and the financial dimension of managerial decision-making more broadly. It provides the theoretical underpin for the practice described above, concerning itself with the managerial application of the various finance techniques. Academics working in this area are typically based in business school finance departments, in accounting, or in management science.

The tools addressed and developed relate in the main to managerial accounting and corporate finance: 
the former allow management to better understand, and hence act on, financial information relating to profitability and performance; the latter, as above, are about optimizing the overall financial structure, including its impact on working capital. Key aspects of managerial finance thus include:
# Financial planning and forecasting
# Capital budgeting
# Capital structure
# Working capital management
# Risk management
# Financial analysis and reporting.
The discussion, however, extends to business strategy more broadly, emphasizing alignment with the company&#x27;s overall strategic objectives; and similarly incorporates the managerial perspectives of planning, directing, and controlling.

===Financial economics===

Financial economics is the branch of economics that studies the interrelation of financial variables, such as prices, interest rates and shares, as opposed to real economic variables, i.e. goods and services. It thus centers on pricing, decision making, and risk management in the financial markets, and produces many of the commonly employed financial models. (Financial econometrics is the branch of financial economics that uses econometric techniques to parameterize the relationships suggested.)

The discipline has two main areas of focus: asset pricing and corporate finance; the first being the perspective of providers of capital, i.e. investors, and the second of users of capital; respectively:
# Asset pricing theory develops the models used in determining the risk-appropriate discount rate, and in pricing derivatives; and includes the portfolio- and investment theory applied in asset management. The analysis essentially explores how rational investors would apply risk and return to the problem of investment under uncertainty, producing the key &quot;Fundamental theorem of asset pricing&quot;. Here, the twin assumptions of rationality and market efficiency lead to modern portfolio theory (the CAPM), and to the Black–Scholes theory for option valuation. At more advanced levels—and often in response to financial crises—the study then extends these &quot;neoclassical&quot; models to incorporate phenomena where their assumptions do not hold, or to more general settings.
# Much of corporate finance theory, by contrast, considers investment under &quot;certainty&quot; (Fisher separation theorem, &quot;theory of investment value&quot;, and Modigliani–Miller theorem). Here, theory and methods are developed for the decisioning about funding, dividends, and capital structure discussed above. A recent development is to incorporate uncertainty and contingency—and thus various elements of asset pricing—into these decisions, employing for example real options analysis.

===Financial mathematics===


Financial mathematics is the field of applied mathematics concerned with financial markets; 
Louis Bachelier&#x27;s doctoral thesis, defended in 1900, is considered to be the first scholarly work in this area. The field is largely focused on the modeling of derivatives—with much emphasis on interest rate- and credit risk modeling—while other important areas include insurance mathematics and quantitative portfolio management. Relatedly, the techniques developed are applied to pricing and hedging a wide range of asset-backed, government, and corporate-securities.

As above, in terms of practice, the field is referred to as quantitative finance and / or mathematical finance, and comprises primarily the three areas discussed.
The main mathematical tools and techniques are, correspondingly:
*for derivatives, Itô&#x27;s stochastic calculus, simulation, and partial differential equations; see aside boxed discussion re the prototypical Black-Scholes and the various numeric techniques now applied
*for risk management, value at risk, stress testing and &quot;sensitivities&quot; analysis (applying the &quot;greeks&quot;); the underlying mathematics comprises mixture models, PCA, volatility clustering and copulas.
*in both of these areas, and particularly for portfolio problems, quants employ sophisticated optimization techniques

Mathematically, these separate into two analytic branches: derivatives pricing uses risk-neutral probability (or arbitrage-pricing probability), denoted by &quot;Q&quot;; while risk and portfolio management generally use physical (or actual or actuarial) probability, denoted by &quot;P&quot;. These are interrelated through the above &quot;Fundamental theorem of asset pricing&quot;.

The subject has a close relationship with financial economics, which, as outlined, is concerned with much of the underlying theory that is involved in financial mathematics: generally, financial mathematics will derive and extend the mathematical models suggested. Computational finance is the branch of (applied) computer science that deals with problems of practical interest in finance, and especially emphasizes the numerical methods applied here.

===Experimental finance===
Experimental finance aims to establish different market settings and environments to experimentally observe and provide a lens through which science can analyze agents&#x27; behavior and the resulting characteristics of trading flows, information diffusion, and aggregation, price setting mechanisms, and returns processes. Researchers in experimental finance can study to what extent existing financial economics theory makes valid predictions and therefore prove them, as well as attempt to discover new principles on which such theory can be extended and be applied to future financial decisions. Research may proceed by conducting trading simulations or by establishing and studying the behavior of people in artificial, competitive, market-like settings.

===Behavioral finance===
Behavioral finance studies how the &quot;psychology&quot; of investors or managers affects financial decisions and markets 
and is relevant when making a decision that can impact either negatively or positively on one of their areas. With more in-depth research into behavioral finance, it is possible to bridge what actually happens in financial markets with analysis based on financial theory. Behavioral finance has grown over the last few decades to become an integral aspect of finance.

Behavioral finance includes such topics as:
# Empirical studies that demonstrate significant deviations from classical theories;
# Models of how psychology affects and impacts trading and prices;
# Forecasting based on these methods;
# Studies of experimental asset markets and the use of models to forecast experiments.

A strand of behavioral finance has been dubbed quantitative behavioral finance, which uses mathematical and statistical methodology to understand behavioral biases in conjunction with valuation. 

=== Quantum finance ===
Quantum finance involves applying quantum mechanical approaches to financial theory, providing novel methods and perspectives in the field. &quot;Quantum&quot; &quot;finance&quot; is an interdisciplinary field, in which theories and methods developed by &quot;quantum&quot; physicists and economists are applied to solve financial problems. It represents a branch known as econophysics. Although &quot;quantum&quot; computational methods have been around for quite some time and use the basic principles of physics to better understand the ways to implement and manage cash flows, it is mathematics that is actually important in this new scenario Finance theory is heavily based on financial instrument pricing such as stock option pricing. Many of the problems facing the finance community have no known analytical solution. As a result, numerical methods and computer simulations for solving these problems have proliferated. This research area is known as computational finance. Many computational finance problems have a high degree of computational complexity and are slow to converge to a solution on classical computers. In particular, when it comes to option pricing, there is additional complexity resulting from the need to respond to quickly changing markets. For example, in order to take advantage of inaccurately priced stock options, the computation must complete before the next change in the almost continuously changing stock market. As a result, the finance community is always looking for ways to overcome the resulting performance issues that arise when pricing options. This has led to research that applies alternative computing techniques to finance. Most commonly used quantum financial models are quantum continuous model, quantum binomial model, multi-step quantum binomial model etc.

== History of finance ==


The origin of finance can be traced to the beginning of state formation and trade during the Bronze Age. The earliest historical evidence of finance is dated to around 3000 BCE. Banking originated in West Asia, where temples and palaces were used as safe places for the storage of valuables. Initially, the only valuable that could be deposited was grain, but cattle and precious materials were eventually included. During the same period, the Sumerian city of Uruk in Mesopotamia supported trade by lending as well as the use of interest. In Sumerian, &quot;interest&quot; was &quot;mas&quot;, which translates to &quot;calf&quot;. In Greece and Egypt, the words used for interest, &quot;tokos&quot; and &quot;ms&quot; respectively, meant &quot;to give birth&quot;. In these cultures, interest indicated a valuable increase, and seemed to consider it from the lender&#x27;s point of view. The Code of Hammurabi (1792–1750 BCE) included laws governing banking operations. The Babylonians were accustomed to charging interest at the rate of 20 percent per year. By 1200 BCE, cowrie shells were used as a form of money in China.

The use of coins as a means of representing money began in the years between 700 and 500 BCE. Herodotus mentions the use of crude coins in Lydia around 687 BCE and, by 640 BCE, the Lydians had started to use coin money more widely and opened permanent retail shops. Shortly after, cities in Classical Greece, such as Aegina, Athens, and Corinth, started minting their own coins between 595 and 570 BCE. During the Roman Republic, interest was outlawed by the &quot;Lex Genucia&quot; reforms in 342 BCE, though the provision went largely unenforced. Under Julius Caesar, a ceiling on interest rates of 12% was set, and much later under Justinian it was lowered even further to between 4% and 8%.

The first stock exchange was opened in Antwerp in 1531. Since then, popular exchanges such as the London Stock Exchange (founded in 1773) and the New York Stock Exchange (founded in 1793) were created.

<text>The Pinchcliffe Grand Prix () is a 1975 Norwegian stop-motion-animated sports film directed by Ivo Caprino. It is based on characters from a series of books by Norwegian cartoonist and author Kjell Aukrust.

It is the most widely seen Norwegian film of all time, having sold some 5.5 million tickets since its release to a population which currently numbers just over 5 million. The film sold 28 million movie tickets in the former Soviet Union.

==Plot==
In the village of Flåklypa, (En. Pinchcliffe), the inventor Reodor Felgen (En. Theodore Rimspoke) lives with his animal friends Ludvig (En. Lambert) (a nervous, pessimistic and melancholic hedgehog) and Solan Gundersen (En. Sonny Duckworth) (a cheerful and optimistic magpie). Reodor works as a bicycle repairman, though he spends most of his time inventing weird Rube Goldberg-like contraptions. One day, the trio discovers that one of Reodor&#x27;s former assistants, Rudolf Blodstrupmoen (En. Rudolph Gore-Slimey), has stolen his design for a race car engine and has become a world champion Formula One driver. Solan secures funding from Arab oil sheik Ben Redic Fy Fazan (En. Abdul Ben Bonanza), who happens to be vacationing in Flåklypa, and to enter the race, the trio builds a gigantic racing car: &quot;Il Tempo Gigante&quot;—a fabulous construction with two extremely big engines (weighing 2.8 tonnes alone and making the seismometer in Bergen show 7.8 Richter when started the first time), a body made out of copper, a spinning radar (that turns out to be useful when Blodstrupmoen starts engaging in smoke warfare during the race), super-retometric distributor, and its own blood bank. Reodor ends up winning despite Blodstrupmoen&#x27;s attempts at sabotage.

==History==
In 1970, Ivo Caprino and his small team of collaborators started work on a 25-minute-long TV special, which would eventually become &quot;The Pinchcliffe Grand Prix&quot;. The TV special was a collection of sketches based on Aukrust&#x27;s books, with no real storyline. After 1½ years of work, it was decided that it didn&#x27;t really work as a whole, so production on the TV special was stopped (with the exception of some very short clips, no material from it has ever been seen by the public). About one year after the rejection, Ivo Caprino&#x27;s son, Remo Caprino, got the idea to make the sketches into a full-length film. Kjell Aukrust, Ivo Caprino, Kjell Syversen, and Remo Caprino began at that point to write the script for what would later become &quot;The Pinchcliffe Grand Prix&quot;.

The film is heavily inspired by the birthplace of Kjell Aukrust&#x27;s father, Lom. The Flåklypa-mountain is a stylized version of a real mountain, where the valley underneath it is named Flåklypa. It is also widely believed that the characters are caricatures of real persons.

The film was made in 3½ years by a team of approximately five people. Caprino directed and animated. Bjarne Sandemose (Caprino&#x27;s principal collaborator throughout his career) built most of the props, sets, and cars and was in charge of the technical aspects of making the film. Ingeborg Riiser designed the puppets and Gerd Alfsen made the costumes and props. Charley Patey was the cameraman.

When it came out in 1975, &quot;The Pinchcliffe Grand Prix&quot; was an enormous success in Norway, selling 1 million tickets in its first year of release. It remains the biggest box office hit of all time in Norway (Caprino Studios claim it has sold 5.5 million tickets to date) and was also released in many other countries. The film held the record for the highest grossing stop motion animated film until it was surpassed in 1993 by &quot;The Nightmare Before Christmas&quot;. The film was shown in cinemas every day of the week for 28 years, from 1975 until 2003—mainly in Norway, Moscow and Tokyo. A real &quot;Il tempo gigante&quot; car was used to promote the film, e.g. driving around the Hockenheimring between races. The car originally had a 250 hp Cadillac engine but when Niki Lauda saw it he provided them with a 7.6 L, 550 hp, big-block Chevrolet. The car also has an auxiliary jet-engine, but due to EU restrictions the vehicle is barely permitted to be used at all save for exclusive TV cameos.

The UK release featured the voice of well-known Formula One commentator Murray Walker. There is also a US dubbed version.

The film was first released on DVD in 2001. In 2005, a digitally restored 30th-anniversary DVD was released which featured soundtracks and subtitles in five languages including Danish, English, Finnish, Swedish and Norwegian. 

The film aired every Christmas Eve in Norway for several years, until a change of channel from NRK to TV 2 changed the airing date to 23 or 25 December. In 2009 it showed on the 25th.

It was released on 8 May 1980 in Australian theaters by Filmways Australia and released in US and Canada in 1981.

== Subsequent films based on Aukrust&#x27;s &quot;Flåklypa&quot; universe ==
* &quot;Gurin with the Foxtail&quot; (1998)
* &quot;Solan og Ludvig - Jul i Flåklypa&quot; (2013)
* &quot;Solan og Ludvig: Herfra til Flåklypa&quot; (2015)
* &quot;Månelyst i Flåklypa&quot; (2018)

== Other works inspired ==
In 2000, a computer game based on the film was released. The game was created by Tyr Neilsen who was Creative Director and in charge of production at Ingames Interactive until a debilitating accident ended his video game career. The project was taken over and completed by Caprino&#x27;s son Remo, while his grandson Mario was lead programmer. The lead designer was Joe Dever. The game was ported to Nintendo DS in 2010 and sold over 380,000 copies in Norway.

The film inspired a young Christian von Koenigsegg to create the Koenigsegg CC, the first of the Koenigsegg line of supercars.

Norwegian hip-hop duo Multicyde based their 1999 single &quot;Not for the Dough&quot; on a sample from the film&#x27;s soundtrack and featured excerpts from the film in the song&#x27;s music video.

<text>Fortran (; formerly FORTRAN) is a third generation, compiled, imperative programming language that is especially suited to numeric computation and scientific computing.

Fortran was originally developed by IBM. It first compiled correctly in 1958. Fortran computer programs have been written to support scientific and engineering applications, such as numerical weather prediction, finite element analysis, computational fluid dynamics, plasma physics, geophysics, computational physics, crystallography and computational chemistry. It is a popular language for high-performance computing and is used for programs that benchmark and rank the world&#x27;s fastest supercomputers.

Fortran has evolved through numerous versions and dialects. In 1966, the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) developed a standard for Fortran to limit proliferation of compilers using slightly different syntax. Successive versions have added support for a character data type (Fortran 77), structured programming, array programming, modular programming, generic programming (Fortran 90), parallel computing (Fortran 95), object-oriented programming (Fortran 2003), and concurrent programming (Fortran 2008).

Since April 2024, Fortran has ranked among the top ten languages in the TIOBE index, a measure of the popularity of programming languages.

==Naming==
The first manual for FORTRAN describes it as a &quot;Formula Translating System&quot;, and printed the name with small caps, . Other sources suggest the name stands for &quot;Formula Translator&quot;, or &quot;Formula Translation&quot;.

Early IBM computers did not support lowercase letters, and the names of versions of the language through FORTRAN 77 were usually spelled in all-uppercase. FORTRAN 77 was the last version in which the Fortran character set included only uppercase letters.

The official language standards for Fortran have referred to the language as &quot;Fortran&quot; with initial caps since Fortran 90.

==Origins==
In late 1953, John W. Backus submitted a proposal to his superiors at IBM to develop a more practical alternative to assembly language for programming their IBM 704 mainframe computer. Backus&#x27; historic FORTRAN team consisted of programmers Richard Goldberg, Sheldon F. Best, Harlan Herrick, Peter Sheridan, Roy Nutt, Robert Nelson, Irving Ziller, Harold Stern, Lois Haibt, and David Sayre. Its concepts included easier entry of equations into a computer, an idea developed by J. Halcombe Laning and demonstrated in the Laning and Zierler system of 1952.

A draft specification for &quot;The IBM Mathematical Formula Translating System&quot; was completed by November 1954. The first manual for FORTRAN appeared in October 1956, with the first FORTRAN compiler delivered in April 1957. Fortran produced efficient enough code for assembly language programmers to accept a high-level programming language replacement.

John Backus said during a 1979 interview with &quot;Think&quot;, the IBM employee magazine, &quot;Much of my work has come from being lazy. I didn&#x27;t like writing programs, and so, when I was working on the IBM 701, writing programs for computing missile trajectories, I started work on a programming system to make it easier to write programs.&quot;

The language was widely adopted by scientists for writing numerically intensive programs, which encouraged compiler writers to produce compilers that could generate faster and more efficient code. The inclusion of a complex number data type in the language made Fortran especially suited to technical applications such as electrical engineering.

By 1960, versions of FORTRAN were available for the IBM 709, 650, 1620, and 7090 computers. Significantly, the increasing popularity of FORTRAN spurred competing computer manufacturers to provide FORTRAN compilers for their machines, so that by 1963 over 40 FORTRAN compilers existed.

FORTRAN was provided for the IBM 1401 computer by an innovative 63-phase compiler that ran entirely in its core memory of only 8000 (six-bit) characters. The compiler could be run from tape, or from a 2200-card deck; it used no further tape or disk storage. It kept the program in memory and loaded overlays that gradually transformed it, in place, into executable form, as described by Haines.
This article was reprinted, edited, in both editions of &quot;Anatomy of a Compiler&quot; and in the IBM manual &quot;Fortran Specifications and Operating Procedures, IBM 1401&quot;. The executable form was not entirely machine language; rather, floating-point arithmetic, sub-scripting, input/output, and function references were interpreted, preceding UCSD Pascal P-code by two decades. GOTRAN, a simplified, interpreted version of FORTRAN I (with only 12 statements not 32) for &quot;load and go&quot; operation was available (at least for the early IBM 1620 computer). Modern Fortran, and almost all later versions, are fully compiled, as done for other high-performance languages.

The development of Fortran paralleled the early evolution of compiler technology, and many advances in the theory and design of compilers were specifically motivated by the need to generate efficient code for Fortran programs.

===FORTRAN===
The initial release of FORTRAN for the IBM 704 contained 32 statements, including:
* and statements
* Assignment statements
* Three-way &quot;arithmetic&quot; statement, which passed control to one of three locations in the program depending on whether the result of the arithmetic expression was negative, zero, or positive
* Control statements for checking exceptions (, , and ); and control statements for manipulating sense switches and sense lights (, , and )
* , computed , , and assigned 
* loops
* Formatted I/O: , , , , , and 
* Unformatted I/O: , , , and 
* Other I/O: , , and 
* , , and 
* statement (for providing optimization hints to the compiler).

The arithmetic statement was reminiscent of (but not readily implementable by) a three-way comparison instruction (CAS—Compare Accumulator with Storage) available on the 704. The statement provided the only way to compare numbers—by testing their difference, with an attendant risk of overflow. This deficiency was later overcome by &quot;logical&quot; facilities introduced in FORTRAN IV.

The statement was used originally (and optionally) to give branch probabilities for the three branch cases of the arithmetic statement. It could also be used to suggest how many iterations a loop might run. The first FORTRAN compiler used this weighting to perform &quot;at compile time&quot; a Monte Carlo simulation of the generated code, the results of which were used to optimize the placement of basic blocks in memory—a very sophisticated optimization for its time. The Monte Carlo technique is documented in Backus et al.&#x27;s paper on this original implementation, &quot;The FORTRAN Automatic Coding System&quot;:

The fundamental unit of program is the basic block; a basic block is a stretch of program which has one entry point and one exit point. The purpose of section 4 is to prepare for section 5 a table of predecessors (PRED table) which enumerates the basic blocks and lists for every basic block each of the basic blocks which can be its immediate predecessor in flow, together with the absolute frequency of each such basic block link. This table is obtained by running the program once in Monte-Carlo fashion, in which the outcome of conditional transfers arising out of IF-type statements and computed GO TO&#x27;s is determined by a random number generator suitably weighted according to whatever FREQUENCY statements have been provided.

The first FORTRAN compiler reported diagnostic information by halting the program when an error was found and outputting an error code on its console. That code could be looked up by the programmer in an error messages table in the operator&#x27;s manual, providing them with a brief description of the problem. Later, an error-handling subroutine to handle user errors such as division by zero, developed by NASA, was incorporated, informing users of which line of code contained the error.

====Fixed layout and punched cards====


Before the development of disk files, text editors and terminals, programs were most often entered on a keypunch keyboard onto 80-column punched cards, one line to a card. The resulting deck of cards would be fed into a card reader to be compiled. Punched card codes included no lower-case letters or many special characters, and special versions of the IBM 026 keypunch were offered that would correctly print the re-purposed special characters used in FORTRAN.

Reflecting punched card input practice, Fortran programs were originally written in a fixed-column format, with the first 72 columns read into twelve 36-bit words.

A letter &quot;C&quot; in column 1 caused the entire card to be treated as a comment and ignored by the compiler. Otherwise, the columns of the card were divided into four fields:
* 1 to 5 were the label field: a sequence of digits here was taken as a label for use in DO or control statements such as GO TO and IF, or to identify a FORMAT statement referred to in a WRITE or READ statement. Leading zeros are ignored and 0 is not a valid label number.
* 6 was a continuation field: a character other than a blank or a zero here caused the card to be taken as a continuation of the statement on the prior card. The continuation cards were usually numbered 1, 2, &quot;etc.&quot; and the starting card might therefore have zero in its continuation column—which is not a continuation of its preceding card.
* 7 to 72 served as the statement field.
* 73 to 80 were ignored (the IBM 704&#x27;s card reader only used 72 columns).

Columns 73 to 80 could therefore be used for identification information, such as punching a sequence number or text, which could be used to re-order cards if a stack of cards was dropped; though in practice this was reserved for stable, production programs. An IBM 519 could be used to copy a program deck and add sequence numbers. Some early compilers, e.g., the IBM 650&#x27;s, had additional restrictions due to limitations on their card readers. Keypunches could be programmed to tab to column 7 and skip out after column 72. Later compilers relaxed most fixed-format restrictions, and the requirement was eliminated in the Fortran 90 standard.

Within the statement field, whitespace characters (blanks) were ignored outside a text literal. This allowed omitting spaces between tokens for brevity or including spaces within identifiers for clarity. For example, was a valid identifier, equivalent to , and 101010DO101I=1,101 was a valid statement, equivalent to 10101 DO 101 I = 1, 101 because the zero in column 6 is treated as if it were a space (!), while 101010DO101I=1.101 was instead 10101 DO101I = 1.101, the assignment of 1.101 to a variable called DO101I. Note the slight visual difference between a comma and a period.

Hollerith strings, originally allowed only in FORMAT and DATA statements, were prefixed by a character count and the letter H (e.g., ), allowing blanks to be retained within the character string. Miscounts were a problem.

==Evolution==

===FORTRAN II===
IBM&#x27;s &quot;FORTRAN II&quot; appeared in 1958. The main enhancement was to support procedural programming by allowing user-written subroutines and functions which returned values with parameters passed by reference. The COMMON statement provided a way for subroutines to access common (or global) variables. Six new statements were introduced:
* , , and 
* and 

Over the next few years, FORTRAN II added support for the and data types.

Early FORTRAN compilers supported no recursion in subroutines. Early computer architectures supported no concept of a stack, and when they did directly support subroutine calls, the return location was often stored in one fixed location adjacent to the subroutine code (e.g. the IBM 1130) or a specific machine register (IBM 360 &quot;et seq&quot;), which only allows recursion if a stack is maintained by software and the return address is stored on the stack before the call is made and restored after the call returns. Although not specified in FORTRAN 77, many F77 compilers supported recursion as an option, and the Burroughs mainframes, designed with recursion built-in, did so by default. It became a standard in Fortran 90 via the new keyword RECURSIVE.

====Simple FORTRAN II program====
This program, for Heron&#x27;s formula, reads data on a tape reel containing three 5-digit integers A, B, and C as input. There are no &quot;type&quot; declarations available: variables whose name starts with I, J, K, L, M, or N are &quot;fixed-point&quot; (i.e. integers), otherwise floating-point. Since integers are to be processed in this example, the names of the variables start with the letter &quot;I&quot;. The name of a variable must start with a letter and can continue with both letters and digits, up to a limit of six characters in FORTRAN II. If A, B, and C cannot represent the sides of a triangle in plane geometry, then the program&#x27;s execution will end with an error code of &quot;STOP 1&quot;. Otherwise, an output line will be printed showing the input values for A, B, and C, followed by the computed AREA of the triangle as a floating-point number occupying ten spaces along the line of output and showing 2 digits after the decimal point, the .2 in F10.2 of the FORMAT statement with label 601.

===FORTRAN III===
IBM also developed a &quot;FORTRAN III&quot; in 1958 that allowed for inline assembly code among other features; however, this version was never released as a product. Like the 704 FORTRAN and FORTRAN II, FORTRAN III included machine-dependent features that made code written in it unportable from machine to machine, as well as boolean algebraic statements support. Early versions of FORTRAN provided by other vendors suffered from the same disadvantage.

===FORTRAN IV===
IBM began development of FORTRAN IV in 1961 as a result of customer demands. FORTRAN IV removed the machine-dependent features of FORTRAN II (such as ), while adding new features such as a data type, logical Boolean expressions, and the &quot;logical IF statement&quot; as an alternative to the &quot;arithmetic IF statement.&quot; FORTRAN IV was eventually released in 1962, first for the IBM 7030 (&quot;Stretch&quot;) computer, followed by versions for the IBM 7090, IBM 7094, and later for the IBM 1401 in 1966.

By 1965, FORTRAN IV was supposed to be compliant with the &quot;standard&quot; being developed by the American Standards Association X3.4.3 FORTRAN Working Group.

Between 1966 and 1968, IBM offered several FORTRAN IV compilers for its System/360, each named by letters that indicated the minimum amount of memory the compiler needed to run.

The letters (F, G, H) matched the codes used with System/360 model numbers to indicate memory size, each letter increment being a factor of two larger:
* 1966 : FORTRAN IV F for DOS/360 (64K bytes)
* 1966 : FORTRAN IV G for OS/360 (128K bytes)
* 1968 : FORTRAN IV H for OS/360 (256K bytes)

Digital Equipment Corporation maintained DECSYSTEM-10 Fortran IV (F40) for PDP-10 from 1967 to 1975. Compilers were also available for the UNIVAC 1100 series and the Control Data 6000 series and 7000 series systems.

At about this time FORTRAN IV had started to become an important educational tool and implementations such as the University of Waterloo&#x27;s WATFOR and WATFIV were created to simplify the complex compile and link processes of earlier compilers.

In the FORTRAN IV programming environment of the era, except for that used on Control Data Corporation (CDC) systems, only one instruction was placed per line. The CDC version allowed for multiple instructions per line if separated by a (dollar) character. The FORTRAN sheet was divided into four fields, as described above.

Two compilers of the time, IBM &quot;G&quot; and UNIVAC, allowed comments to be written on the same line as instructions, separated by a special character: &quot;master space&quot;: V (perforations 7 and 8) for UNIVAC and perforations 12/11/0/7/8/9 (hexadecimal FF) for IBM. These comments were not to be inserted in the middle of continuation cards.

===FORTRAN 66===
Perhaps the most significant development in the early history of FORTRAN was the decision by the &quot;American Standards Association&quot; (now American National Standards Institute (ANSI)) to form a committee sponsored by the Business Equipment Manufacturers Association (BEMA) to develop an &quot;American Standard Fortran&quot;. The resulting two standards, approved in March 1966, defined two languages, &quot;FORTRAN&quot; (based on FORTRAN IV, which had served as a de facto standard), and &quot;Basic FORTRAN&quot; (based on FORTRAN II, but stripped of its machine-dependent features). The FORTRAN defined by the first standard, officially denoted X3.9-1966, became known as &quot;FORTRAN 66&quot; (although many continued to term it FORTRAN IV, the language on which the standard was largely based). FORTRAN 66 effectively became the first industry-standard version of FORTRAN. FORTRAN 66 included:
* Main program, , , and program units
* , , , , and data types
* , , and statements
* statement for specifying initial values
* Intrinsic and (e.g., library) functions
* Assignment statement
* , computed , assigned , and statements
* Logical and arithmetic (three-way) statements
* loop statement
* , , , , and statements for sequential I/O
* statement and assigned format
* , , , and statements
* Hollerith constants in and statements, and as arguments to procedures
* Identifiers of up to six characters in length
* Comment lines
* line

The above Fortran II version of the Heron program needs several modifications to compile as a Fortran 66 program. Modifications include using the more machine independent versions of the and statements, and removal of the unneeded type conversion functions. Though not required, the arithmetic statements can be re-written to use logical statements and expressions in a more structured fashion.

===FORTRAN 77===

After the release of the FORTRAN 66 standard, compiler vendors introduced several extensions to &quot;Standard Fortran&quot;, prompting ANSI committee X3J3 in 1969 to begin work on revising the 1966 standard, under sponsorship of CBEMA, the Computer Business Equipment Manufacturers Association (formerly BEMA). Final drafts of this revised standard circulated in 1977, leading to formal approval of the new FORTRAN standard in April 1978. The new standard, called &quot;FORTRAN 77&quot; and officially denoted X3.9-1978, added a number of significant features to address many of the shortcomings of FORTRAN 66:

* Block and statements, with optional and clauses, to provide improved language support for structured programming
* loop extensions, including parameter expressions, negative increments, and zero trip counts
* , , and statements for improved I/O capability
* Direct-access file I/O
* statement, to override implicit conventions that undeclared variables are if their name begins with , , , , , or (and otherwise)
* data type, replacing Hollerith strings with vastly expanded facilities for character input and output and processing of character-based data
* statement for specifying constants
* statement for persistent local variables
* Generic names for intrinsic functions (e.g. also accepts arguments of other types, such as or ).
* A set of intrinsics () for lexical comparison of strings, based upon the ASCII collating sequence. (These ASCII functions were demanded by the U.S. Department of Defense, in their conditional approval vote.)
* A maximum of seven dimensions in arrays, rather than three. Allowed subscript expressions were also generalized.

In this revision of the standard, a number of features were removed or altered in a manner that might invalidate formerly standard-conforming programs.
(Removal was the only allowable alternative to X3J3 at that time, since the concept of &quot;deprecation&quot; was not yet available for ANSI standards.)
While most of the 24 items in the conflict list (see Appendix A2 of X3.9-1978) addressed loopholes or pathological cases permitted by the prior standard but rarely used, a small number of specific capabilities were deliberately removed, such as:

* Hollerith constants and Hollerith data, such as GREET = 12HHELLO THERE!
* Reading into an H edit (Hollerith field) descriptor in a FORMAT specification
* Overindexing of array bounds by subscripts 
 DIMENSION A(10,5)
 Y = A(11,1)

* Transfer of control out of and back into the range of a DO loop (also known as &quot;Extended Range&quot;)

A Fortran 77 version of the Heron program requires no modifications to the Fortran 66 version. However this example demonstrates additional cleanup of the I/O statements, including using list-directed I/O, and replacing the Hollerith edit descriptors in the statements with quoted strings. It also uses structured and statements, rather than /.

===Transition to ANSI Standard Fortran===
The development of a revised standard to succeed FORTRAN 77 would be repeatedly delayed as the standardization process struggled to keep up with rapid changes in computing and programming practice. In the meantime, as the &quot;Standard FORTRAN&quot; for nearly fifteen years, FORTRAN 77 would become the historically most important dialect.

An important practical extension to FORTRAN 77 was the release of MIL-STD-1753 in 1978. This specification, developed by the U.S. Department of Defense, standardized a number of features implemented by most FORTRAN 77 compilers but not included in the ANSI FORTRAN 77 standard. These features would eventually be incorporated into the Fortran 90 standard.

* and statements
* statement
* variant of the statement
* Bit manipulation intrinsic functions, based on similar functions included in Industrial Real-Time Fortran (ANSI/ISA S61.1 (1976))

The IEEE 1003.9 POSIX Standard, released in 1991, provided a simple means for FORTRAN 77 programmers to issue POSIX system calls. Over 100 calls were defined in the document allowing access to POSIX-compatible process control, signal handling, file system control, device control, procedure pointing, and stream I/O in a portable manner.

===Fortran 90===
The much-delayed successor to FORTRAN 77, informally known as &quot;Fortran 90&quot; (and prior to that, &quot;Fortran 8X&quot;), was finally released as ISO/IEC standard 1539:1991 in 1991 and an ANSI Standard in 1992. In addition to changing the official spelling from FORTRAN to Fortran, this major revision added many new features to reflect the significant changes in programming practice that had evolved since the 1978 standard:

* Free-form source input removed the need to skip the first six character positions before entering statements.
* Lowercase Fortran keywords
* Identifiers up to 31 characters in length (In the previous standard, it was only six characters).
* Inline comments
* Ability to operate on arrays (or array sections) as a whole, thus greatly simplifying math and engineering computations.
** whole, partial and masked array assignment statements and array expressions, such as X(1:N)=R(1:N)*COS(A(1:N))
** statement for selective array assignment
** array-valued constants and expressions,
** user-defined array-valued functions and array constructors.
*  procedures
* Modules, to group related procedures and data together, and make them available to other program units, including the capability to limit the accessibility to only specific parts of the module.
* A vastly improved argument-passing mechanism, allowing interfaces to be checked at compile time
* User-written interfaces for generic procedures
* Operator overloading
* Derived (structured) data types
* New data type declaration syntax, to specify the data type and other attributes of variables
* Dynamic memory allocation by means of the attribute and the and statements
*  attribute, pointer assignment, and statement to facilitate the creation and manipulation of dynamic data structures
* Structured looping constructs, with an statement for loop termination, and and statements for terminating normal loop iterations in an orderly way
* , , . . . , construct for multi-way selection
* Portable specification of numerical precision under the user&#x27;s control
* New and enhanced intrinsic procedures.

====Obsolescence and deletions====
Unlike the prior revision, Fortran 90 removed no features. Any standard-conforming FORTRAN 77 program was also standard-conforming under Fortran 90, and either standard should have been usable to define its behavior.

A small set of features were identified as &quot;obsolescent&quot; and were expected to be removed in a future standard. All of the functionalities of these early-version features can be performed by newer Fortran features. Some are kept to simplify porting of old programs but many were deleted in Fortran 95.
====&quot;Hello, World!&quot; example====

program helloworld
 print *, &quot;Hello, World!&quot;
end program helloworld
===Fortran 95===
&quot;Fortran 95&quot;, published officially as ISO/IEC 1539-1:1997, was a minor revision, mostly to resolve some outstanding issues from the Fortran 90 standard. Nevertheless, Fortran 95 also added a number of extensions, notably from the High Performance Fortran specification:

* and nested constructs to aid vectorization
* User-defined and procedures
* Default initialization of derived type components, including pointer initialization
* Expanded the ability to use initialization expressions for data objects
* Initialization of pointers to 
* Clearly defined that arrays are automatically deallocated when they go out of scope.

A number of intrinsic functions were extended (for example a argument was added to the intrinsic).

Several features noted in Fortran 90 to be &quot;obsolescent&quot; were removed from Fortran 95:

* statements using and index variables
* Branching to an statement from outside its block
* statement
* and assigned statement, and assigned format specifiers
* Hollerith edit descriptor.

An important supplement to Fortran 95 was the ISO technical report &quot;TR-15581: Enhanced Data Type Facilities&quot;, informally known as the &quot;Allocatable TR.&quot; This specification defined enhanced use of arrays, prior to the availability of fully Fortran 2003-compliant Fortran compilers. Such uses include arrays as derived type components, in procedure dummy argument lists, and as function return values. ( arrays are preferable to -based arrays because arrays are guaranteed by Fortran 95 to be deallocated automatically when they go out of scope, eliminating the possibility of memory leakage. In addition, elements of allocatable arrays are contiguous, and aliasing is not an issue for optimization of array references, allowing compilers to generate faster code than in the case of pointers.)

Another important supplement to Fortran 95 was the ISO technical report &quot;TR-15580: Floating-point exception handling&quot;, informally known as the &quot;IEEE TR.&quot; This specification defined support for IEEE floating-point arithmetic and floating-point exception handling.

====Conditional compilation and varying length strings====
In addition to the mandatory &quot;Base language&quot; (defined in ISO/IEC 1539-1 : 1997), the Fortran 95 language also included two optional modules:
* Varying length character strings (ISO/IEC 1539-2 : 2000)
* Conditional compilation (ISO/IEC 1539-3 : 1998)
which, together, compose the multi-part International Standard (ISO/IEC 1539).

According to the standards developers, &quot;the optional parts describe self-contained features which have been requested by a substantial body of users and/or implementors, but which are not deemed to be of sufficient generality for them to be required in all standard-conforming Fortran compilers.&quot; Nevertheless, if a standard-conforming Fortran does provide such options, then they &quot;must be provided in accordance with the description of those facilities in the appropriate Part of the Standard&quot;.

==Modern Fortran==

The language defined by the twenty-first century standards, in particular because of its incorporation of object-oriented programming support and subsequently Coarray Fortran, is often referred to as &#x27;Modern Fortran&#x27;, and the term is increasingly used in the literature.

===Fortran 2003===
&quot;Fortran 2003,&quot; officially published as ISO/IEC 1539-1:2004, was a major revision introducing many new features. A comprehensive summary of the new features of Fortran 2003 is available at the Fortran Working Group (ISO/IEC JTC1/SC22/WG5) official Web site.

From that article, the major enhancements for this revision include:
* Derived type enhancements: parameterized derived types, improved control of accessibility, improved structure constructors, and finalizers
* Object-oriented programming support: type extension and inheritance, polymorphism, dynamic type allocation, and type-bound procedures, providing complete support for abstract data types
* Data manipulation enhancements: allocatable components (incorporating TR 15581), deferred type parameters, attribute, explicit type specification in array constructors and allocate statements, pointer enhancements, extended initialization expressions, and enhanced intrinsic procedures
* Input/output enhancements: asynchronous transfer, stream access, user specified transfer operations for derived types, user specified control of rounding during format conversions, named constants for preconnected units, the statement, regularization of keywords, and access to error messages
* Procedure pointers
* Support for IEEE floating-point arithmetic and floating-point exception handling (incorporating TR 15580)
* Interoperability with the C programming language
* Support for international usage: access to ISO 10646 4-byte characters and choice of decimal or comma in numeric formatted input/output
* Enhanced integration with the host operating system: access to command-line arguments, environment variables, and processor error messages

An important supplement to Fortran 2003 was the ISO technical report &quot;TR-19767: Enhanced module facilities in Fortran.&quot; This report provided &quot;sub-modules,&quot; which make Fortran modules more similar to Modula-2 modules. They are similar to Ada private child sub-units. This allows the specification and implementation of a module to be expressed in separate program units, which improves packaging of large libraries, allows preservation of trade secrets while publishing definitive interfaces, and prevents compilation cascades.

===Fortran 2008===
ISO/IEC 1539-1:2010, informally known as Fortran 2008, was approved in September 2010. As with Fortran 95, this is a minor upgrade, incorporating clarifications and corrections to Fortran 2003, as well as introducing some new capabilities. The new capabilities include:

* Sub-modules – additional structuring facilities for modules; supersedes ISO/IEC TR 19767:2005
* Coarray Fortran – a parallel execution model
* The DO CONCURRENT construct – for loop iterations with no interdependencies
* The CONTIGUOUS attribute – to specify storage layout restrictions
* The BLOCK construct – can contain declarations of objects with construct scope
* Recursive allocatable components – as an alternative to recursive pointers in derived types

The Final Draft international Standard (FDIS) is available as document N1830.

A supplement to Fortran 2008 is the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) Technical Specification (TS) 29113 on &quot;Further Interoperability of Fortran with C&quot;, which has been submitted to ISO in May 2012 for approval. The specification adds support for accessing the array descriptor from C and allows ignoring the type and rank of arguments.

===Fortran 2018===
The Fortran 2018 revision of the language was earlier referred to as Fortran 2015. It was a significant revision and was released on November 28, 2018.

Fortran 2018 incorporates two previously published Technical Specifications:

* ISO/IEC TS 29113:2012 Further Interoperability with C
* ISO/IEC TS 18508:2015 Additional Parallel Features in Fortran

Additional changes and new features include support for ISO/IEC/IEEE 60559:2011 (the version of the IEEE floating-point standard before the latest minor revision IEEE ), hexadecimal input/output, IMPLICIT NONE enhancements and other changes.

Fortran 2018 deleted the arithmetic IF statement. It also deleted non-block DO constructs - loops which do not end with an END DO or CONTINUE statement. These had been an obsolescent part of the language since Fortran 90.

New obsolescences are: COMMON and EQUIVALENCE statements and the BLOCK DATA program unit, labelled DO loops, specific names for intrinsic functions, and the FORALL statement and construct.

===Fortran 2023===
Fortran 2023 (ISO/IEC 1539-1:2023) was published in November 2023, and can be purchased from the ISO.
Fortran 2023 is a minor extension of Fortran 2018 that focuses on correcting errors and omissions
in Fortran 2018. It also adds some small features, including an enumerated type capability.

==Language features==

A full description of the Fortran language features brought by Fortran 95 is covered in the related article, &quot;Fortran 95 language features&quot;. The language versions defined by later standards are often referred to collectively as &#x27;Modern Fortran&#x27; and are described in the literature.

==Science and engineering==


Although a 1968 journal article by the authors of BASIC already described FORTRAN as &quot;old-fashioned&quot;, programs have been written in Fortran for many decades and there is a vast body of Fortran software in daily use throughout the scientific and engineering communities. Jay Pasachoff wrote in 1984 that &quot;physics and astronomy students simply have to learn FORTRAN. So much exists in FORTRAN that it seems unlikely that scientists will change to Pascal, Modula-2, or whatever.&quot; In 1993, Cecil E. Leith called FORTRAN the &quot;mother tongue of scientific computing&quot;, adding that its replacement by any other possible language &quot;may remain a forlorn hope&quot;.

It is the primary language for some of the most intensive super-computing tasks, such as in astronomy, climate modeling, computational chemistry, computational economics, computational fluid dynamics, computational physics, data analysis, hydrological modeling, numerical linear algebra and numerical libraries (LAPACK, IMSL and NAG), optimization, satellite simulation, structural engineering, and weather prediction. Many of the floating-point benchmarks to gauge the performance of new computer processors, such as the floating-point components of the SPEC benchmarks (e.g., CFP2006, CFP2017) are written in Fortran. Math algorithms are well documented in Numerical Recipes.

Apart from this, more modern codes in computational science generally use large program libraries, such as METIS for graph partitioning, PETSc or Trilinos for linear algebra capabilities, deal.II or FEniCS for mesh and finite element support, and other generic libraries. Since the early 2000s, many of the widely used support libraries have also been implemented in C and more recently, in C++. On the other hand, high-level languages such as the Wolfram Language, MATLAB, Python, and R have become popular in particular areas of computational science. Consequently, a growing fraction of scientific programs are also written in such higher-level scripting languages. For this reason, facilities for inter-operation with C were added to Fortran 2003 and enhanced by the ISO/IEC technical specification 29113, which was incorporated into Fortran 2018 to allow more flexible interoperation with other programming languages.

==Portability==
Portability was a problem in the early days because there was no agreed upon standard—not even IBM&#x27;s reference manual—and computer companies vied to differentiate their offerings from others by providing incompatible features. Standards have improved portability. The 1966 standard provided a reference syntax and semantics, but vendors continued to provide incompatible extensions. Although careful programmers were coming to realize that use of incompatible extensions caused expensive portability problems, and were therefore using programs such as &quot;The PFORT Verifier,&quot; it was not until after the 1977 standard, when the National Bureau of Standards (now NIST) published &quot;FIPS PUB 69&quot;, that processors purchased by the U.S. Government were required to diagnose extensions of the standard. Rather than offer two processors, essentially every compiler eventually had at least an option to diagnose extensions.

Incompatible extensions were not the only portability problem. For numerical calculations, it is important to take account of the characteristics of the arithmetic. This was addressed by Fox et al. in the context of the 1966 standard by the &quot;PORT&quot; library. The ideas therein became widely used, and were eventually incorporated into the 1990 standard by way of intrinsic inquiry functions. The widespread (now almost universal) adoption of the IEEE 754 standard for binary floating-point arithmetic has essentially removed this problem.

Access to the computing environment (e.g., the program&#x27;s command line, environment variables, textual explanation of error conditions) remained a problem until it was addressed by the 2003 standard.

Large collections of library software that could be described as being loosely related to engineering and scientific calculations, such as graphics libraries, have been written in C, and therefore access to them presented a portability problem. This has been addressed by incorporation of C interoperability into the 2003 standard.

It is now possible (and relatively easy) to write an entirely portable program in Fortran, even without recourse to a preprocessor.

==Obsolete variants==
Until the Fortran 66 standard was developed, each compiler supported its own variant of Fortran. Some were more divergent from the mainstream than others.

The first Fortran compiler set a high standard of efficiency for compiled code. This goal made it difficult to create a compiler so it was usually done by the computer manufacturers to support hardware sales. This left an important niche: compilers that were fast and provided good diagnostics for the programmer (often a student). Examples include Watfor, Watfiv, PUFFT, and on a smaller scale, FORGO, Wits Fortran, and Kingston Fortran 2.

Fortran 5 was marketed by Data General Corp from the early 1970s to the early 1980s, for the Nova, Eclipse, and MV line of computers. It had an optimizing compiler that was quite good for minicomputers of its time. The language most closely resembles FORTRAN 66.

FORTRAN V was distributed by Control Data Corporation in 1968 for the CDC 6600 series. The language was based upon FORTRAN IV.

Univac also offered a compiler for the 1100 series known as FORTRAN V. A spinoff of Univac Fortran V was Athena FORTRAN.

Specific variants produced by the vendors of high-performance scientific computers (e.g., Burroughs, Control Data Corporation (CDC), Cray, Honeywell, IBM, Texas Instruments, and UNIVAC) added extensions to Fortran to take advantage of special hardware features such as instruction cache, CPU pipelines, and vector arrays. For example, one of IBM&#x27;s FORTRAN compilers (&quot;H Extended IUP&quot;) had a level of optimization which reordered the machine code instructions to keep multiple internal arithmetic units busy simultaneously. Another example is &quot;CFD&quot;, a special variant of FORTRAN designed specifically for the ILLIAC IV supercomputer, running at NASA&#x27;s Ames Research Center.
IBM Research Labs also developed an extended FORTRAN-based language called &quot;VECTRAN&quot; for processing vectors and matrices.

Object-Oriented Fortran was an object-oriented extension of Fortran, in which data items can be grouped into objects, which can be instantiated and executed in parallel. It was available for Sun, Iris, iPSC, and nCUBE, but is no longer supported.

Such machine-specific extensions have either disappeared over time or have had elements incorporated into the main standards. The major remaining extension is OpenMP, which is a cross-platform extension for shared memory programming. One new extension, Coarray Fortran, is intended to support parallel programming.

&quot;FOR TRANSIT&quot; was the name of a reduced version of the IBM 704 FORTRAN language, which was implemented for the IBM 650, using a translator program developed at Carnegie in the late 1950s. The following comment appears in the IBM Reference Manual (&quot;FOR TRANSIT Automatic Coding System&quot; C28-4038, Copyright 1957, 1959 by IBM):

The FORTRAN system was designed for a more complex machine than the 650, and consequently some of the 32 statements found in the FORTRAN Programmer&#x27;s Reference Manual are not acceptable to the FOR TRANSIT system. In addition, certain restrictions to the FORTRAN language have been added. However, none of these restrictions make a source program written for FOR TRANSIT incompatible with the FORTRAN system for the 704.

The permissible statements were:

* Arithmetic assignment statements, e.g., codice_1
* codice_2
* codice_3
* 
* codice_4
* 
* 
* 

Up to ten subroutines could be used in one program.

FOR TRANSIT statements were limited to columns 7 through 56, only. Punched cards were used for input and output on the IBM 650. Three passes were required to translate source code to the &quot;IT&quot; language, then to compile the IT statements into SOAP assembly language, and finally to produce the object program, which could then be loaded into the machine to run the program (using punched cards for data input, and outputting results onto punched cards).

Two versions existed for the 650s with a 2000 word memory drum: FOR TRANSIT I (S) and FOR TRANSIT II, the latter for machines equipped with indexing registers and automatic floating-point decimal (bi-quinary) arithmetic. Appendix A of the manual included wiring diagrams for the IBM 533 card reader/punch control panel.

===Fortran-based languages===
Prior to FORTRAN 77, many preprocessors were commonly used to provide a friendlier language, with the advantage that the preprocessed code could be compiled on any machine with a standard FORTRAN compiler. These preprocessors would typically support structured programming, variable names longer than six characters, additional data types, conditional compilation, and even macro capabilities. Popular preprocessors included EFL, FLECS, iftran, MORTRAN, SFtran, S-Fortran, Ratfor, and Ratfiv. EFL, Ratfor and Ratfiv, for example, implemented C-like languages, outputting preprocessed code in standard FORTRAN 66. The PFORT preprocessor was often used to verify that code conformed to a portable subset of the language. Despite advances in the Fortran language, preprocessors continue to be used for conditional compilation and macro substitution.

One of the earliest versions of FORTRAN, introduced in the &#x27;60s, was popularly used in colleges and universities. Developed, supported, and distributed by the University of Waterloo, WATFOR was based largely on FORTRAN IV. A student using WATFOR could submit their batch FORTRAN job and, if there were no syntax errors, the program would move straight to execution. This simplification allowed students to concentrate on their program&#x27;s syntax and semantics, or execution logic flow, rather than dealing with submission Job Control Language (JCL), the compile/link-edit/execution successive process(es), or other complexities of the mainframe/minicomputer environment. A down side to this simplified environment was that WATFOR was not a good choice for programmers needing the expanded abilities of their host processor(s), e.g., WATFOR typically had very limited access to I/O devices. WATFOR was succeeded by WATFIV and its later versions.

 (line programming)

LRLTRAN was developed at the Lawrence Radiation Laboratory to provide support for vector arithmetic and dynamic storage, among other extensions to support systems programming. The distribution included the Livermore Time Sharing System (LTSS) operating system.

The Fortran-95 Standard includes an optional &quot;Part 3&quot; which defines an optional conditional compilation capability. This capability is often referred to as &quot;CoCo&quot;.

Many Fortran compilers have integrated subsets of the C preprocessor into their systems.

SIMSCRIPT is an application specific Fortran preprocessor for modeling and simulating large discrete systems.

The F programming language was designed to be a clean subset of Fortran 95 that attempted to remove the redundant, unstructured, and deprecated features of Fortran, such as the statement. F retains the array features added in Fortran 90, and removes control statements that were made obsolete by structured programming constructs added to both FORTRAN 77 and Fortran 90. F is described by its creators as &quot;a compiled, structured, array programming language especially well suited to education and scientific computing&quot;. Essential Lahey Fortran 90 (ELF90) was a similar subset.

Lahey and Fujitsu teamed up to create Fortran for the Microsoft .NET Framework. Silverfrost FTN95 is also capable of creating .NET code.

==Code examples==
The following program illustrates dynamic memory allocation and array-based operations, two features introduced with Fortran 90. Particularly noteworthy is the absence of loops and / statements in manipulating the array; mathematical operations are applied to the array as a whole. Also apparent is the use of descriptive variable names and general code formatting that conform with contemporary programming style. This example computes an average over data entered interactively.
program average

 ! Read in some numbers and take the average
 ! As written, if there are no data points, an average of zero is returned
 ! While this may not be desired behavior, it keeps this example simple

 implicit none

 real, allocatable :: points(:)
 integer :: number_of_points
 real :: average_points, positive_average, negative_average
 average_points = 0.
 positive_average = 0.
 negative_average = 0.
 write (*,*) &quot;Input number of points to average:&quot;
 read (*,*) number_of_points

 allocate (points(number_of_points))

 write (*,*) &quot;Enter the points to average:&quot;
 read (*,*) points

 ! Take the average by summing points and dividing by number_of_points
 if (number_of_points &gt; 0) average_points = sum(points) / number_of_points

 ! Now form average over positive and negative points only
 if (count(points &gt; 0.) &gt; 0) positive_average = sum(points, points &gt; 0.) / count(points &gt; 0.)
 if (count(points &lt; 0.) &gt; 0) negative_average = sum(points, points &lt; 0.) / count(points &lt; 0.)

 ! Print result to terminal stdout unit 6
 write (*,&#x27;(a,g12.4)&#x27;) &#x27;Average = &#x27;, average_points
 write (*,&#x27;(a,g12.4)&#x27;) &#x27;Average of positive points = &#x27;, positive_average
 write (*,&#x27;(a,g12.4)&#x27;) &#x27;Average of negative points = &#x27;, negative_average
 deallocate (points) ! free memory

end program average
==Humor==
During the same FORTRAN standards committee meeting at which the name &quot;FORTRAN 77&quot; was chosen, a satirical technical proposal was incorporated into the official distribution bearing the title &quot;Letter O Considered Harmful&quot;. This proposal purported to address the confusion that sometimes arises between the letter &quot;O&quot; and the numeral zero, by eliminating the letter from allowable variable names. However, the method proposed was to eliminate the letter from the character set entirely (thereby retaining 48 as the number of lexical characters, which the colon had increased to 49). This was considered beneficial in that it would promote structured programming, by making it impossible to use the notorious statement as before. (Troublesome statements would also be eliminated.) It was noted that this &quot;might invalidate some existing programs&quot; but that most of these &quot;probably were non-conforming, anyway&quot;.

When X3J3 debated whether the minimum trip count for a DO loop should be zero or one in Fortran 77, Loren Meissner suggested a minimum trip count of two—reasoning &quot;(tongue-in-cheek)&quot; that if it were less than two, then there would be no reason for a loop.

When assumed-length arrays were being added, there was a dispute as to the appropriate character to separate upper and lower bounds. In a comment examining these arguments, Walt Brainerd penned an article entitled &quot;Astronomy vs. Gastroenterology&quot; because some proponents had suggested using the star or asterisk (&quot;*&quot;), while others favored the colon (&quot;:&quot;).

Variable names beginning with the letters I–N have a default type of integer, while variables starting with any other letters defaulted to real, although programmers could override the defaults with an explicit declaration. This led to the joke: &quot;In FORTRAN, GOD is REAL (unless declared INTEGER).&quot;

<text>Fortaleza ( , ; ) is the state capital of Ceará, located in Northeastern Brazil. It is Brazil&#x27;s 4th largest city—Fortaleza surpassed Salvador in 2022 census with a population of slightly over 2.4 million—and 12th among cities with the highest gross domestic product. It forms the core of the Fortaleza metropolitan area, which is home to almost 4 million people.

The municipality is part of the Mercosur common market, and vital trade port which is closest to mainland Europe, being from Lisbon, Portugal.

To the north of the city lies the Atlantic Ocean; to the south are the municipalities of Pacatuba, Eusébio, Maracanaú and Itaitinga; to the east is the municipality of Aquiraz and the Atlantic Ocean; and to the west is the municipality of Caucaia. Residents of the city are known as &quot;Fortalezenses&quot;. Fortaleza is one of the three leading cities in the Northeast region together with Recife and Salvador.

==History==
===Colonial period===
Colonisation began in 1603 when Portugal was part of the Iberian Union, when the Portuguese Pero Coelho de Souza constructed the Fort of São Tiago and founded the settlement of &quot;Nova Lisboa&quot; (New Lisbon). After a victory over the French in 1612, Martins Soares Moreno expanded the Fort of São Tiago and changed its name to Forte de São Sebastião.

In 1630 the Dutch invaded the Brazilian Northeast and in 1637 they took the Fort of São Sebastião and ruled over Ceará. In battles with the Portuguese and natives in 1644 the fort was destroyed. Under captain Matthias Beck the Dutch West Indies Company built a new fortress by the banks of river Pajeú. Fort &quot;Schoonenborch&quot; (&quot;graceful stronghold&quot;) officially opened on 19 August 1649. After the capitulation of Pernambuco in 1654, the Dutch handed over this fortress to the Portuguese, who renamed it &quot;Fortaleza da Nossa Senhora de Assunção&quot; (&quot;Fort of Our Lady of the Assumption&quot;), after which the city of Fortaleza takes its name.

Fortaleza was officially founded as a village 1726, becoming the capital of Ceará state in 1799.

===Imperial period===
During the 19th century, Fortaleza was consolidated as an urban centre in Ceará, supported by the cotton industry. With the transformation of the city into a regional export center and with the increase of direct navigation to Europe, the customs building of Fortaleza was built in 1812. In 1824, the city was targeted by the revolutionaries of Confederation of the Equator.

<text>Political freedom (also known as political autonomy or political agency) is a central concept in history and political thought and one of the most important features of democratic societies. Political freedom has been described as freedom from oppression or coercion, the absence of disabling conditions for an individual and the fulfillment of enabling conditions, or the absence of life conditions of compulsion in society, such as economic compulsion. 

Although political freedom is often interpreted negatively as the freedom from unreasonable external constraints on action, it can also refer to the positive exercise of rights, capacities and possibilities for action and the exercise of social or group rights. The concept can also include freedom from internal constraints on political action or speech such as social conformity, consistency, or inauthentic behaviour. The concept of political freedom is closely connected with the concepts of civil liberties and human rights, which in democratic societies are usually afforded legal protection from the state.

== Views ==
Various groups along the political spectrum hold different views about what they believe constitutes political freedom.

Left-wing political philosophy generally couples the notion of freedom with that of positive liberty or the enabling of a group or individual to determine their own life or realize their own potential. In this sense, freedom may include freedom from poverty, starvation, treatable disease, and oppression as well as freedom from force and coercion, from whomever they may issue.

According to neoliberal philosopher and economist Friedrich Hayek, the &quot;socialist argument&quot; defined &quot;individual liberty&quot; as &quot; &#x27;freedom from&#x27; obstacles&quot;. He argued that this definition only &quot;confused&quot; and obscured the aim of &quot;securing individual freedom&quot;, because it permitted a possible &quot;identification of freedom with power.&quot; The subsequent &quot;collective power over circumstances&quot; misappropriated &quot;the physical &#x27;ability to do what I want&#x27;, the power to satisfy our wishes, or the extent of the choice of alternatives open to us.&quot; Hayek maintained that once any possible &quot;identification of freedom with power is admitted,&quot; a &quot;totalitarian state&quot; coalesced where &quot;liberty has been suppressed in the name of liberty.&quot;

Social anarchists see negative and positive liberty as complementary concepts of freedom. Such a view of rights may require utilitarian trade-offs, such as sacrificing the right to the product of one&#x27;s labor or freedom of association for less racial discrimination or more subsidies for housing. Social anarchists describe the negative liberty-centric view endorsed by capitalism as &quot;selfish freedom&quot;.

Political philosopher Alasdair MacIntyre theorized freedom in terms of our social interdependence with other people.

Economist Milton Friedman argues in his book &quot;Capitalism and Freedom&quot; that there are two types of freedom, namely political freedom and economic freedom, and that without economic freedom there cannot be political freedom.

In his article &quot;Why the Market Subverts Democracy&quot;, Robin Hahnel takes issue with Friedman&#x27;s concept of economic freedom, asserting that there will be infringements on the freedom of others whenever anyone exercises their own economic freedom. He argues that such infringements produce conflicts that are resolved through property rights systems, and therefore it is essential to decide what is a better or a worse property rights system, yet Friedman simply takes for granted the existing property rights and does not question them.

Political philosopher Nikolas Kompridis posits that the pursuit of freedom in the modern era can be broadly divided into two motivating ideals, namely freedom as autonomy or independence and freedom as the ability to cooperatively initiate a new beginning.

Political freedom has also been theorized in its opposition to and a condition of power relations, or the power of action upon actions, by Michel Foucault. It has also been closely identified with certain kinds of artistic and cultural practice by Cornelius Castoriadis, Antonio Gramsci, Herbert Marcuse, Jacques Rancière and Theodor Adorno.

Environmentalists often argue that political freedoms should include some constraint on use of ecosystems. They maintain there is no such thing, for instance, as freedom to pollute or freedom to deforest given that such activities create negative externalities, which violates other groups&#x27; liberty to not be exposed to pollution. The popularity of SUVs, golf and urban sprawl has been used as evidence that some ideas of freedom and ecological conservation can clash. This leads at times to serious confrontations and clashes of values reflected in advertising campaigns, e.g. that of PETA regarding fur.

John Dalberg-Acton stated: &quot;The most certain test by which we judge whether a country is really free is the amount of security enjoyed by minorities.&quot;

Gerald C. MacCallum Jr. spoke of a compromise between positive and negative freedoms, saying that an agent must have full autonomy over themselves. In this view, freedom is a triadic relationship because it is about three things, namely the agent, the constraints they need to be free from and the goal they are aspiring to.

== History ==
Hannah Arendt traces the conceptual origins of freedom to ancient Greek politics. According to her study, the concept of freedom was historically inseparable from political action. Politics could only be practiced by those who had freed themselves from the necessities of life so that they could participate in the realm of political affairs. According to Arendt, the concept of freedom became associated with the Christian notion of freedom of the will, or inner freedom, around the 5th century CE and since then freedom as a form of political action has been neglected even though, as she says, freedom is &quot;the raison d&#x27;être of politics&quot;.

Arendt says that political freedom is historically opposed to sovereignty or will-power since in ancient Greece and Rome the concept of freedom was inseparable from performance and did not arise as a conflict between the will and the self. Similarly, the idea of freedom as freedom from politics is a notion that developed in modern times. This is opposed to the idea of freedom as the capacity to &quot;begin anew&quot;, which Arendt sees as a corollary to the innate human condition of natality, or our nature as &quot;new beginnings and hence beginners&quot;.

In Arendt&#x27;s view, political action is an interruption of automatic process, either natural or historical. The freedom to begin anew is thus an extension of &quot;the freedom to call something into being which did not exist before, which was not given, not even as an object of cognition or imagination, and which therefore, strictly speaking, could not be known&quot;.

<doc id="11178" wikidata="Q860" url="?curid=11178" title="Foobar">
<text>The terms foobar (), foo, bar, baz, qux, quux, and others are used as metasyntactic variables and placeholder names in computer programming or computer-related documentation. They have been used to name entities such as variables, functions, and commands whose exact identity is unimportant and serve only to demonstrate a concept.
The style guide for Google developer documentation recommends against using them as example project names because they are unclear and can cause confusion.

== History and etymology ==
It is possible that &quot;foobar&quot; is a playful allusion to the World War II-era military slang FUBAR (&quot;fucked up beyond all recognition)&quot;.

According to a RFC from the Internet Engineering Task Force, the word FOO originated as a nonsense word with its earliest documented use in the 1930s comic &quot;Smokey Stover&quot; by Bill Holman. Holman states that he used the word due to having seen it on the bottom of a jade Chinese figurine in San Francisco Chinatown, purportedly signifying &quot;good luck&quot;. If true, this is presumably related to the Chinese word &quot;fu&quot; (&quot;&quot;, sometimes transliterated &quot;foo&quot;, as in &quot;foo dog&quot;), which can mean &quot;happiness&quot; or &quot;blessing&quot;.

The first known use of the terms in print in a programming context appears in a 1965 edition of MIT&#x27;s &quot;Tech Engineering News&quot;. The use of &quot;foo&quot; in a programming context is generally credited to the Tech Model Railroad Club (TMRC) of MIT from . In the complex model system, there were scram switches located at numerous places around the room that could be thrown if something undesirable was about to occur, such as a train moving at full power towards an obstruction. Another feature of the system was a digital clock on the dispatch board. When someone hit a scram switch, the clock stopped and the display was replaced with the word &quot;FOO&quot;; at TMRC the scram switches are, therefore, called &quot;Foo switches&quot;. Because of this, an entry in the 1959 &quot;Dictionary of the TMRC Language&quot; went something like this: &quot;FOO: The first syllable of the misquoted sacred chant phrase &#x27;foo mane padme hum.&#x27; Our first obligation is to keep the foo counters turning.&quot; One book describing the MIT train room describes two buttons by the door labeled &quot;foo&quot; and &quot;bar&quot;. These were general-purpose buttons and were often repurposed for whatever fun idea the MIT hackers had at the time, hence the adoption of foo and bar as general-purpose variable names. An entry in the &quot;Abridged Dictionary of the TMRC Language&quot; states:

&quot;Foobar&quot; was used as a variable name in the Fortran code of &quot;Colossal Cave Adventure&quot; (1977 Crowther and Woods version). The variable FOOBAR was used to contain the player&#x27;s progress in saying the magic phrase &quot;Fee Fie Foe Foo&quot;, a phrase from an historical quatrain in the classic English fairy tale Jack and the Beanstalk. Intel also used the term &quot;foo&quot; in their programming documentation in 1978.

==Examples in culture==
* Foo Camp is an annual hacker convention.
* BarCamp, an international network of user-generated conferences.
* During the &quot;United States v. Microsoft Corp.&quot; trial, evidence was presented that Microsoft had tried to use the Web Services Interoperability organization (WS-I) as a means to stifle competition, including e-mails in which top executives including Bill Gates and Steve Ballmer referred to the WS-I using the codename &quot;foo&quot;.
* foobar2000 is an audio player.

<text>Functional analysis is a branch of mathematical analysis, the core of which is formed by the study of vector spaces endowed with some kind of limit-related structure (for example, inner product, norm, or topology) and the linear functions defined on these spaces and suitably respecting these structures. The historical roots of functional analysis lie in the study of spaces of functions and the formulation of properties of transformations of functions such as the Fourier transform as transformations defining, for example, continuous or unitary operators between function spaces. This point of view turned out to be particularly useful for the study of differential and integral equations.

The usage of the word &quot;functional&quot; as a noun goes back to the calculus of variations, implying a function whose argument is a function. The term was first used in Hadamard&#x27;s 1910 book on that subject. However, the general concept of a functional had previously been introduced in 1887 by the Italian mathematician and physicist Vito Volterra. The theory of nonlinear functionals was continued by students of Hadamard, in particular Fréchet and Lévy. Hadamard also founded the modern school of linear functional analysis further developed by Riesz and the group of Polish mathematicians around Stefan Banach.

In modern introductory texts on functional analysis, the subject is seen as the study of vector spaces endowed with a topology, in particular infinite-dimensional spaces. In contrast, linear algebra deals mostly with finite-dimensional spaces, and does not use topology. An important part of functional analysis is the extension of the theories of measure, integration, and probability to infinite-dimensional spaces, also known as infinite dimensional analysis.

==Normed vector spaces==
The basic and historically first class of spaces studied in functional analysis are complete normed vector spaces over the real or complex numbers. Such spaces are called Banach spaces. An important example is a Hilbert space, where the norm arises from an inner product. These spaces are of fundamental importance in many areas, including the mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics, machine learning, partial differential equations, and Fourier analysis.

More generally, functional analysis includes the study of Fréchet spaces and other topological vector spaces not endowed with a norm.

An important object of study in functional analysis are the continuous linear operators defined on Banach and Hilbert spaces. These lead naturally to the definition of C*-algebras and other operator algebras.

===Hilbert spaces===
Hilbert spaces can be completely classified: there is a unique Hilbert space up to isomorphism for every cardinality of the orthonormal basis. Finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces are fully understood in linear algebra, and infinite-dimensional separable Hilbert spaces are isomorphic to formula_1. Separability being important for applications, functional analysis of Hilbert spaces consequently mostly deals with this space. One of the open problems in functional analysis is to prove that every bounded linear operator on a Hilbert space has a proper invariant subspace. Many special cases of this invariant subspace problem have already been proven.

===Banach spaces===
General Banach spaces are more complicated than Hilbert spaces, and cannot be classified in such a simple manner as those. In particular, many Banach spaces lack a notion analogous to an orthonormal basis.

Examples of Banach spaces are formula_2-spaces for any real number Given also a measure formula_3 on set then sometimes also denoted formula_4 or has as its vectors equivalence classes formula_5 of measurable functions whose absolute value&#x27;s formula_6-th power has finite integral; that is, functions formula_7 for which one has
formula_8

If formula_3 is the counting measure, then the integral may be replaced by a sum. That is, we require
formula_10

Then it is not necessary to deal with equivalence classes, and the space is denoted written more simply formula_11 in the case when formula_12 is the set of non-negative integers.

In Banach spaces, a large part of the study involves the dual space: the space of all continuous linear maps from the space into its underlying field, so-called functionals. A Banach space can be canonically identified with a subspace of its bidual, which is the dual of its dual space. The corresponding map is an isometry but in general not onto. A general Banach space and its bidual need not even be isometrically isomorphic in any way, contrary to the finite-dimensional situation. This is explained in the dual space article.

Also, the notion of derivative can be extended to arbitrary functions between Banach spaces. See, for instance, the Fréchet derivative article.

==Linear functional analysis==

==Major and foundational results==

There are four major theorems which are sometimes called the four pillars of functional analysis: 

* the Hahn–Banach theorem
* the open mapping theorem
* the closed graph theorem
* the uniform boundedness principle, also known as the Banach–Steinhaus theorem. 

Important results of functional analysis include:

===Uniform boundedness principle===

The uniform boundedness principle or Banach–Steinhaus theorem is one of the fundamental results in functional analysis. Together with the Hahn–Banach theorem and the open mapping theorem, it is considered one of the cornerstones of the field. In its basic form, it asserts that for a family of continuous linear operators (and thus bounded operators) whose domain is a Banach space, pointwise boundedness is equivalent to uniform boundedness in operator norm.

The theorem was first published in 1927 by Stefan Banach and Hugo Steinhaus but it was also proven independently by Hans Hahn.

===Spectral theorem===

There are many theorems known as the spectral theorem, but one in particular has many applications in functional analysis.

This is the beginning of the vast research area of functional analysis called operator theory; see also the spectral measure.

There is also an analogous spectral theorem for bounded normal operators on Hilbert spaces. The only difference in the conclusion is that now formula_7 may be complex-valued.

===Hahn–Banach theorem===

The Hahn–Banach theorem is a central tool in functional analysis. It allows the extension of bounded linear functionals defined on a subspace of some vector space to the whole space, and it also shows that there are &quot;enough&quot; continuous linear functionals defined on every normed vector space to make the study of the dual space &quot;interesting&quot;.

===Open mapping theorem===

The open mapping theorem, also known as the Banach–Schauder theorem (named after Stefan Banach and Juliusz Schauder), is a fundamental result which states that if a continuous linear operator between Banach spaces is surjective then it is an open map. More precisely,
The proof uses the Baire category theorem, and completeness of both formula_12 and formula_15 is essential to the theorem. The statement of the theorem is no longer true if either space is just assumed to be a normed space, but is true if formula_12 and formula_15 are taken to be Fréchet spaces.

===Closed graph theorem===

===Other topics===
==Foundations of mathematics considerations==
Most spaces considered in functional analysis have infinite dimension. To show the existence of a vector space basis for such spaces may require Zorn&#x27;s lemma. However, a somewhat different concept, the Schauder basis, is usually more relevant in functional analysis. Many theorems require the Hahn–Banach theorem, usually proved using the axiom of choice, although the strictly weaker Boolean prime ideal theorem suffices. The Baire category theorem, needed to prove many important theorems, also requires a form of axiom of choice.

==Points of view==
Functional analysis includes the following tendencies:
*&quot;Abstract analysis&quot;. An approach to analysis based on topological groups, topological rings, and topological vector spaces.
*&quot;Geometry of Banach spaces&quot; contains many topics. One is combinatorial approach connected with Jean Bourgain; another is a characterization of Banach spaces in which various forms of the law of large numbers hold.
*&quot;Noncommutative geometry&quot;. Developed by Alain Connes, partly building on earlier notions, such as George Mackey&#x27;s approach to ergodic theory.
*&quot;Connection with quantum mechanics&quot;. Either narrowly defined as in mathematical physics, or broadly interpreted by, for example, Israel Gelfand, to include most types of representation theory.

<text>Francis Albert Sinatra (; December 12, 1915 – May 14, 1998) was an American singer and actor. Nicknamed the &quot;Chairman of the Board&quot;, &quot;Ol&#x27; Blue Eyes&quot;, and &quot;The Voice&quot;, he is regarded as one of the most popular entertainers of the 20th century. Sinatra is among the world&#x27;s best-selling music artists, with an estimated 150 million record sales globally.

Born in Hoboken, New Jersey, Sinatra began his musical career in the swing era and was influenced by the easy-listening vocal style of Bing Crosby. He joined the Harry James band as the vocalist in 1939 before finding success as a solo artist after signing with Columbia Records in 1943, becoming the idol of the &quot;bobby soxers&quot;. In 1946, Sinatra released his debut album, &quot;The Voice of Frank Sinatra&quot;. He then signed with Capitol Records and released several albums with arrangements by Nelson Riddle, notably &quot;In the Wee Small Hours&quot; (1955) and &quot;Songs for Swingin&#x27; Lovers!&quot; (1956). In 1960, Sinatra left Capitol Records to start his own record label, Reprise Records, releasing a string of successful albums. He collaborated with Count Basie on &quot;Sinatra-Basie: An Historic Musical First&quot; (1962) and &quot;It Might as Well Be Swing&quot; (1964). In 1965, he recorded &quot;September of My Years&quot; and starred in the Emmy-winning television special &quot;Frank Sinatra: A Man and His Music&quot;. After releasing &quot;Sinatra at the Sands&quot; in 1966, Sinatra recorded one of his most famous collaborations with Tom Jobim, &quot;Francis Albert Sinatra &amp; Antonio Carlos Jobim&quot;. It was followed by 1968&#x27;s &quot;Francis A. &amp; Edward K.&quot; with Duke Ellington. Sinatra retired in 1971 following the release of &quot;My Way&quot; but came out of retirement two years later. He recorded several albums and released &quot;New York, New York&quot; in 1980.

Sinatra also forged a highly successful acting career. After winning the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for &quot;From Here to Eternity&quot; (1953), he starred in &quot;The Man with the Golden Arm&quot; (1955) and &quot;The Manchurian Candidate&quot; (1962). Sinatra also appeared in musicals such as &quot;On the Town&quot; (1949), &quot;Guys and Dolls&quot; (1955), &quot;High Society&quot; (1956), and &quot;Pal Joey&quot; (1957), which won him a Golden Globe Award. Toward the end of his career, he frequently played detectives, including the title character in &quot;Tony Rome&quot; (1967). Sinatra received the Golden Globe Cecil B. DeMille Award in 1971. On television, &quot;The Frank Sinatra Show&quot; began on CBS in 1950, and he continued to make appearances on television throughout the 1950s and 1960s.

In 1983, Sinatra was honored at the Kennedy Center Honors. He was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1985 and the Congressional Gold Medal in 1997. Sinatra received eleven Grammy Awards, including the Grammy Trustees Award, Grammy Legend Award, and the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award. American music critic Robert Christgau called him &quot;the greatest singer of the 20th century&quot; and he continues to be regarded as an iconic figure.

== Early life ==

Francis Albert Sinatra was born on December 12, 1915, in a tenement at 415 Monroe Street in Hoboken, New Jersey, the only child of Italian immigrants Natalina &quot;Dolly&quot; Garaventa and Antonino Martino &quot;Marty&quot; Sinatra. Sinatra weighed at birth and had to be delivered with the aid of forceps, which caused severe scarring to his left cheek, neck, and ear, and perforated his eardrum—which remained damaged for the rest of his life. His grandmother resuscitated him by running him under cold water until he gasped. Due to his injuries, his baptism at St. Francis Church in Hoboken was delayed until April 2, 1916. A childhood operation on his mastoid bone left major scarring on his neck, and during adolescence he was further scarred by cystic acne. Sinatra was raised in the Catholic Church.

Sinatra&#x27;s mother was energetic and driven; biographers believe that she was the dominant factor in the development of her son&#x27;s personality and self-confidence. Sinatra&#x27;s fourth wife Barbara would later claim that Dolly &quot;knocked him around a lot&quot; when he was a child. Dolly became influential in Hoboken and in local Democratic Party circles. She worked as a midwife, and according to Sinatra biographer Kitty Kelley, ran an illegal abortion service that catered to Italian Catholic girls, for which she was nicknamed &quot;Hatpin Dolly&quot;. She had a gift for languages and served as a local interpreter.

Sinatra&#x27;s illiterate father was a bantamweight boxer who later worked at the Hoboken Fire Department, working his way up to captain. Due to his illiteracy, he stressed the importance of a &quot;complete and full&quot; education and had instilled in his son the desire to become a civil engineer and enroll at Stevens Institute of Technology in Hoboken. Sinatra spent much time at his parents&#x27; tavern in Hoboken, working on his homework and occasionally singing for spare change. During the Great Depression, Dolly provided money to her son for outings with friends and to buy expensive clothes, resulting in neighbors describing him as the &quot;best-dressed kid in the neighborhood&quot;. Excessively thin and small as a child and young man, Sinatra&#x27;s skinny frame later became a staple of jokes during stage shows.

At a young age, Sinatra developed an interest in music, particularly big band jazz and listened to Gene Austin, Rudy Vallée, Russ Colombo, and Bob Eberly while idolizing Bing Crosby. For his 15th birthday, his uncle Domenico gave him a ukulele, with which he performed at family gatherings. Sinatra attended David E. Rue Jr. High School from 1928, and A. J. Demarest High School (since renamed as Hoboken High School) in 1931, where he arranged bands for school dances, but left without graduating after having attended only 47 days before being expelled for &quot;general rowdiness&quot;. 

To please his mother, he enrolled at Drake Business School, but departed after 11 months. Dolly found her son work as a delivery boy at the &quot;Jersey Observer&quot; newspaper (since merged into &quot;The Jersey Journal&quot;), where his godfather Frank Garrick worked; he later worked as a riveter at the Tietjen and Lang shipyard. He began performing in local Hoboken social clubs and sang for free on radio stations such as WAAT in Jersey City. In New York, Sinatra found jobs singing for his supper or for cigarettes. To improve his speech, he began taking elocution lessons for a dollar each from vocal coach John Quinlan, one of the first people to notice his impressive vocal range.

== Music career ==
=== 1935–1942: Hoboken Four, Harry James, and Tommy Dorsey ===

Sinatra began singing professionally as a teenager. He never learned to read music but learned by ear. He got his first break in 1935 when his mother persuaded a local singing group called the 3 Flashes to let him join. Baritone Fred Tamburro stated that &quot;Frank hung around us like we were gods or something&quot;, admitting that they only took him on board because he owned a car and could chauffeur the group. Sinatra soon learned they were auditioning for the &quot;Major Bowes Amateur Hour&quot; show and &quot;begged&quot; the group to let him join. 

With Sinatra, the group became known as the &quot;Hoboken Four&quot; and passed an audition from Edward Bowes to appear on the show. They each earned $12.50, and attracted 40,000 votes to win first prize—a six-month contract to perform on stage and radio across the U.S. Sinatra quickly became the group&#x27;s lead singer, and, much to the jealousy of his fellow group members, garnered most of the attention from the girls. Due to the success of the group, Bowes kept asking for them to return, disguised under different names, varying from &quot;The Secaucus Cockamamies&quot; to &quot;The Bayonne Bacalas&quot;.
In 1938, Sinatra found employment as a singing waiter at a roadhouse called &quot;The Rustic Cabin&quot; in Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey, for which he was paid $15 a week. The roadhouse was connected to the WNEW radio station in New York City, and he began performing with a group live during the &quot;Dance Parade&quot; show. Despite the low salary, Sinatra felt that this was the break he was looking for, and boasted to friends that he was going to &quot;become so big that no one could ever touch him&quot;. In March 1939, saxophone player Frank Mane, who knew Sinatra from Jersey City radio station WAAT, arranged for him to audition and record &quot;Our Love&quot;, his first solo studio recording. In June, bandleader Harry James, who had heard Sinatra sing on &quot;Dance Parade&quot;, signed him to a two-year contract of $75 a week after a show at the Paramount Theatre in New York. It was with the James band that Sinatra released his first commercial record &quot;From the Bottom of My Heart&quot; in July. No more than 8,000 copies were sold, and further records released with James through 1939, such as &quot;All or Nothing at All&quot;, also had weak sales on their initial release. Thanks to his vocal training, Sinatra could now sing two tones higher, and developed a repertoire which included songs such as &quot;My Buddy&quot;, &quot;Willow Weep for Me&quot;, &quot;It&#x27;s Funny to Everyone but Me&quot;, &quot;Here Comes the Night&quot;, &quot;On a Little Street in Singapore&quot;, &quot;Ciribiribin&quot;, and &quot;Every Day of My Life&quot;.
Sinatra became increasingly frustrated with the Harry James band, feeling that he was not achieving the major success and acclaim he was looking for. His pianist and close friend Hank Sanicola persuaded him to stay with the group, but in November 1939 he left James to replace Jack Leonard as the lead singer of the Tommy Dorsey band. Sinatra earned $125 a week, appearing at the Palmer House in Chicago, and James released Sinatra from his contract. 

On January 26, 1940, he made his first public appearance with the band at the Coronado Theatre in Rockford, Illinois, opening the show with &quot;Stardust&quot;. Dorsey recalled: &quot;You could almost feel the excitement coming up out of the crowds when the kid stood up to sing. Remember, he was no matinée idol. He was just a skinny kid with big ears. I used to stand there so amazed I&#x27;d almost forget to take my own solos&quot;. 

Dorsey was a major influence on Sinatra and became a father figure. Sinatra copied Dorsey&#x27;s mannerisms and traits, becoming a demanding perfectionist like him, even adopting his hobby of toy trains. He asked Dorsey to be godfather to his daughter Nancy in June 1940. Sinatra later said that &quot;The only two people I&#x27;ve ever been afraid of are my mother and Tommy Dorsey.&quot; Though Kelley says that Sinatra and drummer Buddy Rich were bitter rivals, other authors state that they were friends and even roommates when the band was on the road, but professional jealousy surfaced as both men wanted to be considered the star of Dorsey&#x27;s band. Later, Sinatra helped Rich form his own band with a $25,000 loan and provided financial help to Rich during times of the drummer&#x27;s serious illness.

In his first year with Dorsey, Sinatra recorded more than forty songs. Sinatra&#x27;s first vocal hit was the song &quot;Polka Dots and Moonbeams&quot; in late April 1940. Two more chart appearances followed with &quot;Say It&quot; and &quot;Imagination&quot;, which was Sinatra&#x27;s first top-10 hit. His fourth chart appearance (and his first on the first officially published &quot;Billboard&quot; chart) was &quot;I&#x27;ll Never Smile Again&quot;, topping the charts for twelve weeks beginning in mid-July. Other records with Tommy Dorsey issued by RCA Victor include &quot;Our Love Affair&quot; and &quot;Stardust&quot; in 1940; &quot;Oh! Look at Me Now&quot;, &quot;Dolores&quot;, &quot;Everything Happens to Me&quot;, and &quot;This Love of Mine&quot; in 1941; &quot;Just as Though You Were There&quot;, &quot;Take Me&quot;, and &quot;There Are Such Things&quot; in 1942; and &quot;It Started All Over Again&quot;, &quot;In the Blue of Evening&quot;, and &quot;It&#x27;s Always You&quot; in 1943. 

As his success and popularity grew, Sinatra pushed Dorsey to allow him to record some solo songs. Dorsey eventually relented, and on January 19, 1942, Sinatra recorded &quot;Night and Day&quot;, &quot;The Night We Called It a Day&quot;, &quot;The Song is You&quot;, and &quot;Lamplighter&#x27;s Serenade&quot; at a Bluebird recording session, with Axel Stordahl as arranger and conductor. Sinatra first heard the recordings at the Hollywood Palladium and Hollywood Plaza and was astounded at how good he sounded. Stordahl recalled: &quot;He just couldn&#x27;t believe his ears. He was so excited you almost believed he had never recorded before. I think this was a turning point in his career. I think he began to see what he might do on his own&quot;.

After the 1942 recordings, Sinatra believed he needed to go solo, with an insatiable desire to compete with Bing Crosby, but he was hampered by his contract which gave Dorsey 43% of Sinatra&#x27;s lifetime earnings. A legal battle ensued, eventually settled in August 1942. On September 3, 1942, Dorsey bade farewell to Sinatra, reportedly saying &quot;I hope you fall on your ass&quot;, but he was more gracious on the air when replacing Sinatra with singer Dick Haymes. 

Rumors began spreading in newspapers that Sinatra&#x27;s mobster godfather, Willie Moretti, coerced Dorsey at gunpoint to let Sinatra out of his contract for a few thousand dollars. Sinatra persuaded Stordahl to come with him and become his personal arranger, offering him $650 a month, five times his salary from Dorsey. Dorsey and Sinatra, who had been very close, never reconciled their differences.

=== 1942–1945: Onset of Sinatramania and Role in World War II ===

By May 1941, Sinatra topped the male singer polls in &quot;Billboard&quot; and &quot;DownBeat&quot; magazines. His appeal to bobby soxers, as teenage girls of that time were called, revealed a new audience for popular music, which had previously been recorded mainly for adults. The phenomenon became officially known as &quot;Sinatramania&quot; after his &quot;legendary opening&quot; at the Paramount Theatre in New York on December 30, 1942. 

According to Nancy Sinatra, Jack Benny later said, &quot;I thought the goddamned building was going to cave in. I never heard such a commotion... All this for a fellow I never heard of.&quot; Sinatra performed for four weeks at the theatre, his act following the Benny Goodman orchestra, after which his contract was renewed for another four weeks by Bob Weitman due to his popularity. He became known as &quot;Swoonatra&quot; or &quot;The Voice&quot;, and his fans &quot;Sinatratics&quot;. They organized meetings and sent masses of letters of adoration, and within a few weeks of the show, some 1,000 Sinatra fan clubs had been reported across the US. 

Sinatra&#x27;s publicist, George Evans, encouraged interviews and photographs with fans and was the man responsible for depicting Sinatra as a vulnerable, shy, Italian–American with a rough childhood who made good. When Sinatra returned to the Paramount in October 1944, only 250 persons left the first show, and 35,000 fans left outside caused a near riot, known as the Columbus Day Riot, outside the venue because they were not allowed in. Such was the bobby-soxer devotion to Sinatra that they were known to write Sinatra&#x27;s song titles on their clothing, bribe hotel maids for an opportunity to touch his bed, and steal clothing he was wearing, most commonly his bow tie.
Sinatra signed with Columbia Records as a solo artist on June 1, 1943, during the 1942–44 musicians&#x27; strike. Columbia Records re-released Harry James and Sinatra&#x27;s August 1939 version of &quot;All or Nothing at All&quot;, which reached number 2 on June 2 and was on the best-selling list for 18 weeks. He initially had great success, and performed on the radio on &quot;Your Hit Parade&quot; from February 1943 until December 1944, and on stage. 

Columbia wanted new recordings of their growing star as quickly as possible, so Alec Wilder was hired as an arranger and conductor for several sessions with a vocal group called the Bobby Tucker Singers. Of the nine songs recorded during these sessions, seven charted on the best-selling list. That year he made his first solo nightclub appearance at New York&#x27;s Riobamba, and a successful concert in the Wedgewood Room of the prestigious Waldorf-Astoria New York that year secured his popularity in New York high society. Sinatra released &quot;You&#x27;ll Never Know&quot;, &quot;Close to You&quot;, &quot;Sunday, Monday, or Always&quot; and &quot;People Will Say We&#x27;re in Love&quot; as singles. By the end of 1943, he was more popular in a &quot;DownBeat&quot; poll than Bing Crosby.

Sinatra did not serve in the military during World War II. On December 11, 1943, he was officially classified 4-F (&quot;Registrant not acceptable for military service&quot;) by his draft board because of his perforated eardrum. However, Army files reported that Sinatra had actually been rejected because he was &quot;not acceptable material from a psychiatric viewpoint;&quot; his emotional instability was hidden to avoid &quot;undue unpleasantness for both the selectee and the induction service&quot;. Briefly, there were rumors reported by columnist Walter Winchell that Sinatra paid $40,000 to avoid military service, but the FBI found this to be without merit.
Toward the end of the war, Sinatra entertained the troops during several successful overseas USO tours with comedian Phil Silvers. During one trip to Rome, he met the Pope, who asked him if he was an operatic tenor. Sinatra worked frequently with the popular Andrews Sisters in radio in the 1940s, and many USO shows were broadcast to troops via the Armed Forces Radio Service (AFRS). In 1944, Sinatra released &quot;I Couldn&#x27;t Sleep a Wink Last Night&quot; as a single and recorded his own version of Irving Berlin&#x27;s &quot;White Christmas&quot;. The following year he released &quot;I Dream of You (More Than You Dream I Do)&quot;, &quot;Saturday Night (Is the Loneliest Night of the Week)&quot;, &quot;Dream&quot;, and &quot;Nancy (with the Laughing Face)&quot; as singles.

=== 1946–1952: Columbia years and career slump ===
Despite being heavily involved in political activity in 1945 and 1946, in those two years, Sinatra sang on 160 radio shows, recorded 36 times, and shot four films. By 1946, he was performing on stage up to 45 times a week, singing up to 100 songs daily, and earning up to $93,000 a week.

In 1946, Sinatra released &quot;Oh! What it Seemed to Be&quot;, &quot;Day by Day&quot;, &quot;They Say It&#x27;s Wonderful&quot;, &quot;Five Minutes More&quot;, and &quot;The Coffee Song&quot; as singles, and launched his first album, &quot;The Voice of Frank Sinatra&quot;, which reached No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; chart. William Ruhlmann of AllMusic wrote that Sinatra &quot;took the material very seriously, singing the love lyrics with utter seriousness&quot; and that his &quot;singing and the classically influenced settings gave the songs unusual depth of meaning.&quot; He was soon selling 10million records a year. 

Such was Sinatra&#x27;s command at Columbia that his love of conducting was indulged with the release of the set &quot;Frank Sinatra Conducts the Music of Alec Wilder&quot;, an offering unlikely to appeal to Sinatra&#x27;s core fanbase of teenage girls at the time. The following year he released his second album, &quot;Songs by Sinatra&quot;, featuring songs of a similar mood and tempo such as Irving Berlin&#x27;s &quot;How Deep is the Ocean?&quot; and Harold Arlen&#x27;s and Jerome Kern&#x27;s &quot;All The Things You Are&quot;. &quot;Mam&#x27;selle&quot;, composed by Edmund Goulding with lyrics by Mack Gordon for the film &quot;The Razor&#x27;s Edge&quot; (1946), was released as a single. 

Sinatra had competition; versions by Art Lund, Dick Haymes, Dennis Day, and The Pied Pipers also reached the top ten of the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts. In December, he recorded &quot;Sweet Lorraine&quot; with the Metronome All-Stars, featuring talented jazz musicians such as Coleman Hawkins, Harry Carney and Charlie Shavers, with Nat King Cole on piano, in what Charles L. Granata describes as &quot;one of the highlights of Sinatra&#x27;s Columbia epoch&quot;.

Sinatra&#x27;s third album, &quot;Christmas Songs by Sinatra&quot;, was originally released in 1948 as a 78rpm album set, and a 10&quot; LP record was released two years later. When Sinatra was featured as a priest in &quot;The Miracle of the Bells&quot;, due to press negativity surrounding his alleged Mafia connections at the time, it was announced to the public that Sinatra would donate his $100,000 in wages from the film to the Catholic Church. 

By the end of 1948, Sinatra had slipped to fourth on &quot;DownBeat&quot;″s annual poll of most popular singers, and in the following year he was pushed out of the top spots in polls for the first time since 1943. &quot;Frankly Sentimental&quot; (1949) was panned by &quot;DownBeat&quot;, who commented that &quot;for all his talent, it seldom comes to life.&quot;
Though &quot;The Hucklebuck&quot; reached the top ten, it was his last single release under the Columbia label. Sinatra&#x27;s last two albums with Columbia, &quot;Dedicated to You&quot; and &quot;Sing and Dance with Frank Sinatra&quot;, were released in 1950. Sinatra would later feature a number of the &quot;Sing and Dance with Frank Sinatra&quot; album&#x27;s songs, including &quot;Lover&quot;, &quot;It&#x27;s Only a Paper Moon&quot;, and &quot;It All Depends on You&quot;, on his 1961 Capitol release, &quot;Sinatra&#x27;s Swingin&#x27; Session!!!&quot;.

Culminating the low of his career was the death of publicist George Evans in January 1950. According to Jimmy Van Heusen, Sinatra&#x27;s close friend and songwriter, Evans&#x27;s death to him was &quot;an enormous shock which defies words&quot;, as he had been crucial to his career and popularity with the &quot;Bobby soxers&quot;. 

Sinatra&#x27;s reputation continued to decline as reports broke in February of his affair with Ava Gardner and the destruction of his marriage to Nancy, though he insisted that his marriage had long been over even before he met Gardner. In April, Sinatra was engaged to perform at the Copa club in New York, but had to cancel five days of the booking due to a submucosal hemorrhage of the throat. Evans once said that whenever Sinatra suffered from a bad throat and loss of voice it was always due to emotional tension, which &quot;absolutely destroyed him&quot;.
In financial difficulty following his divorce and career decline, Sinatra was forced to borrow $200,000 from Columbia to pay his back taxes after MCA refused to front the money. Rejected by Hollywood, he turned to Las Vegas and made his debut at the Desert Inn in September 1951, and also began singing at the Riverside Hotel in Reno, Nevada. 

Sinatra became one of Las Vegas&#x27;s pioneer residency entertainers, and a prominent figure on the Vegas scene throughout the 1950s and 1960s onwards, a period described by Rojek as the &quot;high-water mark&quot; of Sinatra&#x27;s &quot;hedonism and self-absorption&quot;. Rojek notes that the Rat Pack &quot;provided an outlet for gregarious banter and wisecracks&quot; but argues that it was Sinatra&#x27;s vehicle, possessing an &quot;unassailable command over the other performers.&quot; Sinatra would fly to Las Vegas from Los Angeles in Van Heusen&#x27;s plane. On October 4, 1953, Sinatra made his first performance at the Sands Hotel and Casino, after an invitation by the manager Jack Entratter. Sinatra typically performed there three times a year and later acquired a share in the hotel.

Sinatra&#x27;s decline in popularity was evident in his concert appearances. At a brief run at the Paramount in New York, he drew small audiences. At the Desert Inn in Las Vegas, he performed to half-filled houses. At a concert at Chez Paree in Chicago, only 150 people turned up in a 1,200-seat venue. By April 1952, he was performing at the Kauai County Fair in Hawaii. Sinatra&#x27;s relationship with Columbia Records was disintegrating, with A&amp;R executive Mitch Miller claiming he &quot;couldn&#x27;t give away&quot; Sinatra records. Though several notable recordings were made during this time period, such as &quot;If I Could Write a Book&quot; in January 1952, which Granata sees as a &quot;turning point&quot;, forecasting his later work with its sensitivity, 

Columbia and MCA dropped him later that year. His last studio recording for Columbia, &quot;Why Try To Change Me Now&quot;, was recorded in New York on September 17, 1952, with an orchestra arranged and conducted by Percy Faith. Journalist Burt Boyar observed, &quot;Sinatra had had it. It was sad. From the top to the bottom in one horrible lesson.&quot;

=== 1953–1960: Career Revival and the Capitol years ===

The release of the film &quot;From Here to Eternity&quot; in August 1953 marked the beginning of a remarkable career revival. Tom Santopietro notes that Sinatra began to bury himself in his work, with an &quot;unparalleled frenetic schedule of recordings, movies and concerts&quot;, in what authors Anthony Summers and Robbyn Swan describe as &quot;a new and brilliant phase.&quot; 

On March 13, 1953, Sinatra met with Capitol Records vice president Alan Livingston and signed a seven-year recording contract. His first session for Capitol took place at KHJ studios at Studio C, 5515 Melrose Avenue in Los Angeles, with Axel Stordahl conducting. The session produced four recordings, including &quot;I&#x27;m Walking Behind You&quot;, Sinatra&#x27;s first Capitol single. 

After spending two weeks on location in Hawaii filming &quot;From Here to Eternity&quot;, Sinatra returned to KHJ on April 30 for his first recording session with Nelson Riddle, an established arranger and conductor at Capitol who was Nat King Cole&#x27;s musical director. After recording the first song, &quot;I&#x27;ve Got the World on a String&quot;, Sinatra offered Riddle a rare expression of praise, &quot;Beautiful!&quot;, and after listening to the playbacks, he could not hide his enthusiasm, exclaiming, &quot;I&#x27;m back, baby, I&#x27;m back!&quot;
In subsequent sessions in May and November 1953, Sinatra and Riddle developed and refined their musical collaboration, with Sinatra providing specific guidance on the arrangements. Sinatra&#x27;s first album for Capitol, &quot;Songs for Young Lovers&quot;, was released on January 4, 1954, and included &quot;A Foggy Day&quot;, &quot;I Get a Kick Out of You&quot;, &quot;My Funny Valentine&quot;, &quot;Violets for Your Furs&quot;, and &quot;They Can&#x27;t Take That Away from Me&quot;, songs which became staples of his later concerts. 

That same month, Sinatra released the single &quot;Young at Heart&quot;, which reached No. 2 and was awarded Song of the Year. In March, he recorded and released the single &quot;Three Coins in the Fountain&quot;, a &quot;powerful ballad&quot; that reached No. 4. Sinatra&#x27;s second album with Riddle, &quot;Swing Easy!&quot;, which reflected his &quot;love for the jazz idiom&quot; according to Granata, was released on August 2 of that year and included &quot;Just One of Those Things&quot;, &quot;Taking a Chance on Love&quot;, &quot;Get Happy&quot;, and &quot;All of Me&quot;. &quot;Swing Easy!&quot; was named Album of the Year by &quot;Billboard&quot;, and he was named &quot;Favorite Male Vocalist&quot; by &quot;Billboard&quot;, &quot;DownBeat&quot;, and &quot;Metronome&quot; that year. 

Sinatra came to consider Riddle &quot;the greatest arranger in the world&quot;, and Riddle, who considered Sinatra, &quot;a perfectionist&quot;, said: &quot;It&#x27;s not only that his intuitions as to tempo, phrasing, and even configuration are amazingly right, but his taste is so impeccable... There is still no one who can approach him.&quot;
In 1955, Sinatra released &quot;In the Wee Small Hours&quot;, his first 12&quot; LP, featuring songs such as &quot;In the Wee Small Hours of the Morning&quot;, &quot;Mood Indigo&quot;, &quot;Glad to Be Unhappy&quot; and &quot;When Your Lover Has Gone&quot;. According to Granata it was the first concept album of his to make a &quot;single persuasive statement&quot;, with an extended program and &quot;melancholy mood&quot;. Sinatra embarked on his first tour of Australia the same year. 

Another collaboration with Riddle resulted in &quot;Songs for Swingin&#x27; Lovers!&quot;, sometimes seen as one of his best albums, which was released in March 1956. It features a recording of &quot;I&#x27;ve Got You Under My Skin&quot; by Cole Porter, which reportedly took 22 takes to perfect.

His February 1956 recording sessions inaugurated the studios at the Capitol Records Building, complete with a 56-piece symphonic orchestra. According to Granata, his recordings of &quot;Night and Day&quot;, &quot;Oh! Look at Me Now&quot;, and &quot;From This Moment On&quot; revealed &quot;powerful sexual overtones, stunningly achieved through the mounting tension and release of Sinatra&#x27;s best-teasing vocal lines&quot;, while his recording of &quot;River, Stay &#x27;Way from My Door&quot; in April demonstrated his &quot;brilliance as a syncopational improviser.&quot; 

Riddle said that Sinatra took &quot;particular delight&quot; in singing &quot;The Lady is a Tramp&quot;, commenting that he &quot;always sang that song with a certain amount of salaciousness&quot;, making &quot;cue tricks&quot; with the lyrics. His penchant for conducting was displayed again in 1956&#x27;s &quot;Frank Sinatra Conducts Tone Poems of Color&quot;, an instrumental album that has been interpreted to be a catharsis to his failed relationship with Gardner. Sinatra also sang at that year&#x27;s Democratic National Convention and performed with The Dorsey Brothers for a week soon afterward at the Paramount Theatre.
In 1957, Sinatra released &quot;Close to You&quot;, &quot;A Swingin&#x27; Affair!&quot;, and &quot;Where Are You?&quot;—his first album in stereo, with Gordon Jenkins. Granata considers &quot;Close to You&quot; to have been thematically his closest concept album to perfection during the &quot;golden&quot; era, and Nelson Riddle&#x27;s finest work, which was &quot;extremely progressive&quot; by the standards of the day. It is structured like a three-act play, each commencing with the songs &quot;With Every Breath I Take&quot;, &quot;Blame It on My Youth&quot; and &quot;It Could Happen to You&quot;. For Granata, Sinatra&#x27;s &quot;A Swingin&#x27; Affair!&quot; and &quot;Songs for Swingin&#x27; Lovers!&quot; solidified &quot;Sinatra&#x27;s image as a &#x27;swinger&#x27;, from both a musical and visual standpoint.&quot; Buddy Collette considered the swing albums to have been heavily influenced by Sammy Davis Jr. and stated that when he worked with Sinatra in the mid-1960s, he approached a song much differently than he had done in the early 1950s. 

On June 9, 1957, he performed in a 62-minute concert conducted by Riddle at the Seattle Civic Auditorium, his first appearance in Seattle since 1945. The recording was first released as a bootleg, but Artanis Entertainment Group officially released it as &quot;Sinatra &#x27;57 in Concert&quot; in 1999, after Sinatra&#x27;s death. 

In 1958, Sinatra released the concept album &quot;Come Fly with Me&quot; with Billy May, designed as a musical world tour. It reached the top spot on the &quot;Billboard&quot; album chart in its second week, remaining at the top for five weeks, and was nominated for the Grammy Award for Album of the Year at the inaugural Grammy Awards. The title song, &quot;Come Fly With Me&quot;, written especially for him, would become one of his best-known standards. On May 29, he recorded seven songs in a single session, more than double the usual yield of a recording session, and an eighth, &quot;Lush Life&quot;, was abandoned as Sinatra found it too technically demanding. In September, Sinatra released &quot;Frank Sinatra Sings for Only the Lonely&quot;, a stark collection of introspective saloon songs and blues-tinged ballads, which proved a huge commercial success, spending 120 weeks on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s album chart and peaking at No. 1. Cuts from this LP, such as &quot;Angel Eyes&quot; and &quot;One for My Baby (and One More for the Road)&quot;, would remain staples of the &quot;saloon song&quot; segments of Sinatra&#x27;s concerts.
In 1959, Sinatra released &quot;Come Dance with Me!&quot;, a highly successful, critically acclaimed album that stayed on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Pop album chart for 140 weeks, peaking at No. 2. It won the Grammy Award for Album of the Year, as well as Best Vocal Performance, Male and Best Arrangement for Billy May. 

He released &quot;No One Cares&quot; in the same year, a collection of &quot;brooding, lonely&quot; torch songs, which critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine thought was &quot;nearly as good as its predecessor &quot;Where Are You?&quot;, but lacked the &quot;lush&quot; arrangements of it and the &quot;grandiose melancholy&quot; of &quot;Only the Lonely&quot;.

In the words of Kelley, by 1959, Sinatra was &quot;not simply the leader of the Rat Pack&quot; but had &quot;assumed the position of &quot;il padrone&quot; in Hollywood.&quot; He was asked by 20th Century Fox to be the master of ceremonies at a luncheon attended by Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev on September 19, 1959. &quot;Nice &#x27;n&#x27; Easy&quot;, a collection of ballads, topped the &quot;Billboard&quot; chart in October 1960 and remained in the charts for 86 weeks, winning critical plaudits.

=== 1960–1969: Reprise years ===
Sinatra grew discontented at Capitol and feuded with Alan Livingston, which lasted over six months. His first attempt at owning his own label was with his pursuit of buying declining jazz label Verve Records, which ended once an initial agreement with Verve founder Norman Granz &quot;failed to materialize&quot;. 

He decided to form his own label, Reprise Records, and, in an effort to assert his new direction, temporarily parted with Riddle, May and Jenkins, working with other arrangers such as Neil Hefti, Don Costa, and Quincy Jones. Sinatra built the appeal of Reprise Records as one in which artists were promised creative control, as well as a guarantee that they would eventually gain &quot;complete ownership of their work, including publishing rights.&quot; 

Under Sinatra the company developed into a music industry &quot;powerhouse&quot;, and he later sold it for an estimated $80million. His first album on the label, &quot;Ring-a-Ding-Ding!&quot; (1961), was a major success, peaking at No.4 on &quot;Billboard&quot;. The album was released in February 1961, the same month that Reprise Records released Ben Webster&#x27;s &quot;The Warm Moods&quot;, Sammy Davis Jr.&#x27;s &quot;The Wham of Sam&quot;, Mavis River&#x27;s &quot;Mavis&quot; and Joe E. Lewis&#x27;s &quot;It is Now Post Time&quot;. During the initial years of Reprise, Sinatra was still under contract to record for Capitol, completing his contractual commitment with the release of &quot;Point of No Return&quot;, recorded on September 11 and 12, 1961.
In 1962, Sinatra released &quot;Sinatra and Strings&quot;, a set of standard ballads arranged by Don Costa, which became one of the most critically acclaimed works of Sinatra&#x27;s Reprise period. Frank Jr., who was present during the recording, noted the &quot;huge orchestra&quot;, which Nancy Sinatra stated &quot;opened a whole new era&quot; in pop music, with orchestras getting bigger, embracing a &quot;lush string sound&quot;. 

Sinatra and Count Basie collaborated for the album &quot;Sinatra-Basie&quot; the same year, a popular and successful release which prompted them to rejoin two years later for the follow-up &quot;It Might as Well Be Swing&quot;, arranged by Quincy Jones. The two became frequent performers together, and appeared at the Newport Jazz Festival in 1965. Also in 1962, as the owner of his own record label, Sinatra was able to step on the podium as conductor again, releasing his third instrumental album &quot;Frank Sinatra Conducts Music from Pictures and Plays&quot;.

In 1963, Sinatra reunited with Nelson Riddle for &quot;The Concert Sinatra&quot;, an ambitious album featuring a 73-piece symphony orchestra arranged and conducted by Riddle. The concert was recorded on a motion picture scoring soundstage with the use of multiple synchronized recording machines that employed an optical signal onto 35mm film designed for movie soundtracks. Granata considers the album to have been &quot;impeachable&quot; [sic], &quot;one of the very best of the Sinatra-Riddle ballad albums&quot;, in which Sinatra displayed his vocal range, particularly in &quot;Ol&#x27; Man River&quot;, in which he darkened the hue.

In 1964, the song &quot;My Kind of Town&quot; was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Song. Sinatra released &quot;Softly, as I Leave You&quot;, and collaborated with Bing Crosby and Fred Waring on &quot;America, I Hear You Singing&quot;, a collection of patriotic songs recorded as a tribute to the assassinated President John F. Kennedy. Sinatra increasingly became involved in charitable pursuits in this period. In 1961 and 1962, he went to Mexico to put on performances for Mexican charities. and in July 1964, he was present at the dedication of the Frank Sinatra International Youth Center for Arab and Jewish children in Nazareth.

Sinatra&#x27;s phenomenal success in 1965, coinciding with his 50th birthday, prompted &quot;Billboard&quot; to proclaim that he may have reached the &quot;peak of his eminence&quot;. In June 1965, Sinatra, Sammy Davis Jr., and Dean Martin played live in St. Louis to benefit Dismas House, a prisoner rehabilitation and training center with nationwide programs that, in particular, helped serve black Americans. 

The Rat Pack concert, called The Frank Sinatra Spectacular, was broadcast live via satellite to numerous movie theaters across America. The album &quot;September of My Years&quot; was released September 1965, and went on to win the Grammy Award for best album of the year. Granata considers the album to have been one of the finest of his Reprise years, &quot;a reflective throwback to the concept records of the 1950s, and more than any of those collections, distills everything that Frank Sinatra had ever learned or experienced as a vocalist&quot;. One of the album&#x27;s singles, &quot;It Was a Very Good Year&quot;, won the Grammy Award for Best Vocal Performance, Male. A career anthology, &quot;A Man and His Music&quot;, followed in November, winning Album of the Year at the Grammys the following year.

In 1966, Sinatra released &quot;That&#x27;s Life&quot;, with both the single of &quot;That&#x27;s Life&quot; and album becoming Top Ten hits on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s pop charts. &quot;Strangers in the Night&quot; went on to top the &quot;Billboard&quot; and UK pop singles charts, winning the award for Record of the Year at the Grammys. Sinatra&#x27;s first live album, &quot;Sinatra at the Sands&quot;, was recorded during January and February 1966 at the Sands Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas. Sinatra was backed by the Count Basie Orchestra, with Quincy Jones conducting. Sinatra pulled out from the Sands the following year when he was driven out by its new owner Howard Hughes after a fight.
Sinatra started 1967 with a series of recording sessions with Antônio Carlos Jobim. He recorded one of his collaborations with Jobim, the Grammy-nominated album &quot;Francis Albert Sinatra &amp; Antônio Carlos Jobim&quot;, which was one of the best-selling albums of the year, behind the Beatles&#x27;s &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot;. 

According to Santopietro the album &quot;consists of an extraordinarily effective blend of bossa nova and slightly swinging jazz vocals, and succeeds in creating an unbroken mood of romance and regret.&quot; Writer Stan Cornyn wrote that Sinatra sang so softly on the album that it was comparable to the time that he suffered from a vocal hemorrhage in 1950.

Sinatra released the album &quot;The World We Knew&quot;, which features a chart-topping duet of &quot;Somethin&#x27; Stupid&quot; with daughter Nancy. In December, Sinatra collaborated with Duke Ellington on the album &quot;Francis A. &amp; Edward K.&quot;. According to Granata, the recording of &quot;Indian Summer&quot; on the album was a favorite of Riddle&#x27;s, noting the &quot;contemplative mood [which] is heightened by a Johnny Hodges alto sax solo that will bring a tear to your eye&quot;. 

With Sinatra in mind, singer-songwriter Paul Anka wrote the song &quot;My Way&quot;, using the melody of the French &quot;Comme d&#x27;habitude&quot; (&quot;As Usual&quot;), composed by Claude François and Jacques Revaux. Sinatra recorded it in one take, just after Christmas 1968. &quot;My Way&quot;, Sinatra&#x27;s best-known song on the Reprise label, was not an instant success, charting at No. 27 in the US and No. 5 in the UK. However, it remained in the UK charts for 122 weeks, including 75 non-consecutive weeks in the Top 40, between April 1969 and September 1971, which was still a record in 2015. Sinatra told songwriter Ervin Drake in the 1970s that he &quot;detested&quot; singing the song because he believed audiences would think it was a &quot;self-aggrandizing tribute&quot;. According to NPR, &quot;My Way&quot; has become one of the most requested songs at funerals.

In an effort to maintain his commercial viability in the late 1960s, Sinatra would record works by Paul Simon (&quot;Mrs. Robinson&quot;), the Beatles (&quot;Yesterday&quot;), and Joni Mitchell (&quot;Both Sides, Now&quot;) in 1969.

=== 1970–1981: &quot;Retirement&quot; and return ===

In 1970, Sinatra released &quot;Watertown&quot;, a critically acclaimed concept album, with music by Bob Gaudio (of the Four Seasons) and lyrics by Jake Holmes. However, it sold a mere 30,000 copies that year and reached a peak chart position of 101. 

He left Caesars Palace in September of that year after an incident in which executive Sanford Waterman pulled a gun on him. He performed several charity concerts with Count Basie at the Royal Festival Hall in London. On November 2, 1970, Sinatra recorded the last songs for Reprise Records before his self-imposed retirement, announced the following June at a concert in Hollywood to raise money for the Motion Picture and TV Relief Fund. He gave a &quot;rousing&quot; performance of &quot;That&#x27;s Life&quot;, and finished the concert with a Matt Dennis and Earl Brent song, &quot;Angel Eyes&quot; which he had recorded on the &quot;Only the Lonely&quot; album in 1958. He sang the last line. &quot;&#x27;Scuse me while I disappear.&quot; The spotlight went dark, and he left the stage. 

He told &quot;LIFE&quot; journalist Thomas Thompson that &quot;I&#x27;ve got things to do, like the first thing is not to do at all for eight months... maybe a year&quot;, while Barbara Sinatra later said that Sinatra had grown &quot;tired of entertaining people, especially when all they really wanted were the same old tunes he had long ago become bored by&quot;. Around this time, Sinatra designed &quot;Villa Maggio&quot;, a holiday home and retreat near Palm Desert. While he was in retirement, President Richard Nixon asked him to perform at a Young Voters Rally in anticipation of the upcoming campaign. Sinatra obliged and chose to sing &quot;My Kind of Town&quot; for the rally held in Chicago on October 20, 1972.
In 1973, Sinatra came out of his short-lived retirement with a television special and album. The album, entitled &quot;Ol&#x27; Blue Eyes Is Back&quot;, arranged by Gordon Jenkins and Don Costa, was a success, reaching number 13 on &quot;Billboard&quot; and number 12 in the UK. The television special, &quot;Magnavox Presents Frank Sinatra&quot;, reunited Sinatra with Gene Kelly. 

He initially developed problems with his vocal cords during the comeback due to a prolonged period without singing. That Christmas, he performed at the Sahara Hotel in Las Vegas, and returned to Caesars Palace the following month in January 1974. He began what Barbara Sinatra describes as a &quot;massive comeback tour of the United States, Europe, the Far East, and Australia.&quot; In July, while on a second tour of Australia, he caused an uproar by describing journalists therewho were aggressively pursuing his every move and pushing for a press conferenceas &quot;bums, parasites, fags, and buck-and-a-half hookers.&quot; After he was pressured to apologize, Sinatra instead insisted that the journalists apologize for &quot;fifteen years of abuse I have taken from the world press.&quot; Union actions canceled concerts and grounded Sinatra&#x27;s plane, essentially trapping him in Australia. 

Sinatra&#x27;s lawyer, Mickey Rudin, arranged for Sinatra to issue a written conciliatory note and a final concert that was televised to the nation. In October 1974, he appeared at New York City&#x27;s Madison Square Garden in a televised concert that was later released as an album under the title &quot;The Main Event – Live&quot;. Backing him was bandleader Woody Herman and the Young Thundering Herd, who accompanied Sinatra on a European tour later that month.

In 1975, Sinatra performed in concerts in New York with Count Basie and Ella Fitzgerald, and at the London Palladium with Basie and Sarah Vaughan, and in Tehran at Aryamehr Stadium, giving 140 performances in 105 days. In August he held several concerts at Lake Tahoe together with the newly risen singer John Denver, who became a frequent collaborator. Sinatra had recorded Denver&#x27;s &quot;Leaving on a Jet Plane&quot; and &quot;My Sweet Lady&quot; for &quot;Sinatra &amp; Company&quot; (1971), and according to Denver, his song &quot;A Baby Just Like You&quot; was written at Sinatra&#x27;s request for his new grandchild, Angela. 

During the Labor Day weekend held in 1976, Sinatra was responsible for reuniting old friends and comedy partners Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis for the first time in nearly twenty years, when they performed at the &quot;Jerry Lewis MDA Telethon&quot;. That year, the Friars Club selected him as the &quot;Top Box Office Name of the Century&quot;, and he was given the Scopus Award by the American Friends of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem in Israel and an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters from the University of Nevada.

Sinatra continued to perform at Caesars Palace in the late 1970s and was performing there in January 1977 when his mother Dolly died in a plane crash on the way to see him. He canceled two weeks of shows and spent time recovering from the shock in Barbados. In March, he performed in front of Princess Margaret at the Royal Albert Hall in London, raising money for the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children. On March 14, he recorded with Nelson Riddle for the last time, recording the songs &quot;Linda&quot;, &quot;Sweet Lorraine&quot;, and &quot;Barbara&quot;. The two men had a major falling out and later patched up their differences in January 1985 at a dinner organized for Ronald Reagan when Sinatra asked Riddle to make another album with him. Riddle was ill at the time and died that October before they had a chance to record.

In 1978, Sinatra filed a $1million lawsuit against a land developer for using his name in the &quot;Frank Sinatra Drive Center&quot; in West Los Angeles. During a party at Caesars in 1979, he was awarded the Grammy Trustees Award, while celebrating 40 years in show business and his 64th birthday. That year, former President Gerald Ford awarded Sinatra the International Man of the Year Award, and he performed in front of the Egyptian pyramids for Anwar Sadat, which raised more than $500,000 for Sadat&#x27;s wife&#x27;s charities.

In 1980, Sinatra&#x27;s first album in six years was released, &quot;&quot;, a highly ambitious triple album that features an array of songs from both the pre-rock and rock eras. It was the first studio album of Sinatra&#x27;s to feature his touring pianist at the time, Vinnie Falcone, and was based on an idea by Sonny Burke. The album garnered six Grammy nominations– winning for best liner notes– and peaked at number 17 on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s album chart, and spawned yet another song that would become a signature tune, &quot;Theme from New York, New York&quot;. 

That year, as part of the Concert of the Americas, he performed in the Maracanã Stadium in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, which broke records for the &quot;largest live paid audience ever recorded for a solo performer&quot;. The following year, Sinatra built on the success of &quot;Trilogy&quot; with &quot;She Shot Me Down&quot;, an album that was praised for embodying the dark tone of his Capitol years. Also in 1981, Sinatra was embroiled in controversy when he worked a 10-day engagement for $2million in Sun City, in the internationally unrecognized Bophuthatswana, breaking a cultural boycott against apartheid-era South Africa. President Lucas Mangope awarded Sinatra with the highest honor, the Order of the Leopard, and made him an honorary tribal chief.

=== 1982–1998: Later career and final projects ===
Santopietro stated that by the early 1980s, Sinatra&#x27;s voice had &quot;coarsened, losing much of its power and flexibility, but audiences didn&#x27;t care.&quot; In 1982, he signed a $16million three-year deal with the Golden Nugget of Las Vegas. 

Kelley notes that by this period, Sinatra&#x27;s voice had grown &quot;darker, tougher and loamier&quot;, but he &quot;continued to captivate audiences with his immutable magic.&quot; She added that his baritone voice &quot;sometimes cracked, but the gliding intonations still aroused the same raptures of delight as they had at the Paramount Theater.&quot; 

That year, he made a reported further $1.3million from the Showtime television rights to his &quot;Concert of the Americas&quot; in the Dominican Republic, $1.6million for a concert series at Carnegie Hall, and $250,000 in just one evening at the Chicago Fest. He donated a lot of his earnings to charity. He put on a performance at the White House for Italian president Sandro Pertini, and performed at the Radio City Music Hall with Luciano Pavarotti and George Shearing.

Sinatra was honored at the 1983 Kennedy Center Honors, alongside Katherine Dunham, James Stewart, Elia Kazan, and Virgil Thomson. Quoting Henry James, President Reagan said in honoring his old friend that &quot;art was the shadow of humanity&quot; and that Sinatra had &quot;spent his life casting a magnificent and powerful shadow.&quot; 

On September 21, 1983, Sinatra filed a $2million court case against Kitty Kelley, suing her for punitive damages, before her unofficial biography, &quot;His Way&quot;, was even published. The book became a best-seller for &quot;all the wrong reasons&quot; and &quot;the most eye-opening celebrity biography of our time&quot;, according to William Safire of &quot;The New York Times&quot;. Sinatra was always adamant that such a book would be written on his terms, and he himself would &quot;set the record straight&quot; in details of his life. 

According to Kelley, the family detested her and the book, which took its toll on Sinatra&#x27;s health. Kelley says that Tina Sinatra blamed her for her father&#x27;s colon surgery in 1986. He was forced to drop the case on September 19, 1984, with several leading newspapers expressing concerns about censorship.

In 1984, Sinatra worked with Quincy Jones for the first time in nearly two decades on the album &quot;L.A. Is My Lady&quot;, which was well received critically. The album was a substitute for another Jones project, an album of duets with Lena Horne, which had to be abandoned. In 1986, Sinatra collapsed on stage while performing in Atlantic City and was hospitalized for diverticulitis, which left him looking frail. Two years later, Sinatra reunited with Martin and Davis and went on the Rat Pack Reunion Tour, during which they played many large arenas. When Martin dropped out of the tour early on, a rift developed between them, and the two never spoke again.

On June 6, 1988, Sinatra made his last recordings with Reprise for an album that was not released. He recorded &quot;My Foolish Heart&quot;, &quot;Cry Me a River&quot;, and other songs. Sinatra never completed the project, but take number 18 of &quot;My Foolish Heart&quot; may be heard in &quot;The Complete Reprise Studio Recordings&quot; (1995).
In 1990, Sinatra was awarded the second &quot;Ella Award&quot; by the Los Angeles-based Society of Singers, and performed for a final time with Ella Fitzgerald at the award ceremony. Sinatra maintained an active touring schedule in the early 1990s, performing 65 concerts in 1990, 73 in 1991, and 84 in 1992 in seventeen countries.

In 1993, Sinatra returned to Capitol Records and the recording studio for &quot;Duets&quot;, which became his best-selling album. The album and its sequel, &quot;Duets II&quot;, released the following year, would see Sinatra remake his classic recordings with popular contemporary performers, who added their vocals to a pre-recorded tape.

During his tours in the early 1990s, his memory failed him at times during concerts, and he fainted onstage in Richmond, Virginia in March 1994. His final public concerts were held in Fukuoka Dome in Japan on December 19–20, 1994. The following year, Sinatra sang for the last time on February 25, 1995, before a live audience of 1200 select guests at the Palm Desert Marriott Ballroom on the closing night of the Frank Sinatra Desert Classic golf tournament. 

&quot;Esquire&quot; reported of the show that Sinatra was &quot;clear, tough, on the money&quot; and &quot;in absolute control&quot;. Sinatra was awarded the Legend Award at the 1994 Grammy Awards, where he was introduced by Bono, who said of him, &quot;Frank&#x27;s the chairman of the bad attitude... Rock &#x27;n roll plays at being tough, but this guy is the boss– the chairman of boss&quot;.

In 1995, to mark Sinatra&#x27;s 80th birthday, the Empire State Building glowed blue. A star-studded birthday tribute, &quot;Sinatra: 80 Years My Way&quot;, was held at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles, featuring performers such as Ray Charles, Little Richard, Natalie Cole and Salt-N-Pepa singing his songs. At the end of the program, Sinatra performed on stage for the last time to sing the final notes of the &quot;Theme from New York, New York&quot; with an ensemble. In recognition of his many years of association with Las Vegas, Sinatra was elected to the Gaming Hall of Fame in 1997.

== Artistry ==
While Sinatra never learned how to read music well, he had a natural understanding of it, and he worked very hard from a young age to improve his abilities in all aspects of music. He could follow a lead sheet (simplified sheet music showing a song&#x27;s basic structure) during a performance by &quot;carefully following the patterns and groupings of notes arranged on the page&quot; and made his own notations to the music, using his ear to detect semitonal differences. 

Granata states that some of the most accomplished classically trained musicians soon noticed his musical understanding and remarked that Sinatra had a &quot;sixth sense&quot;, which &quot;demonstrated unusual proficiency when it came to detecting incorrect notes and sounds within the orchestra.&quot; 

Sinatra was an aficionado of classical music, and would often request classical strains in his music, inspired by composers such as Puccini and Impressionist masters. His personal favorite was Ralph Vaughan Williams. He would insist on always recording live with the band because it gave him a &quot;certain feeling&quot; to perform live surrounded by musicians.
By the mid-1940s, such was his understanding of music that after hearing an air check of some compositions by Alec Wilder, which were for strings and woodwinds, he became the conductor at Columbia Records for six of Wilder&#x27;s compositions. The works were considered by Wilder to have been among the finest renditions and recordings of his compositions, past or present. Critic Gene Lees, a lyricist and the author of the words to the Jobim melody &quot;This Happy Madness&quot;, expressed amazement when he heard Sinatra&#x27;s recording of it on &quot;Sinatra &amp; Company&quot; (1971), considering him to have delivered the lyrics to perfection.

Voice coach John Quinlan was impressed by Sinatra&#x27;s vocal range, remarking, &quot;He has far more voice than people think he has. He can vocalize to a B-flat on top in full voice, and he doesn&#x27;t need a mic either&quot;. As a singer, early on, he was primarily influenced by Bing Crosby, but later believed that Tony Bennett was &quot;the best singer in the business.&quot; Bennett himself claimed that as a performer, Sinatra had &quot;perfected the art of intimacy.&quot; According to Nelson Riddle, Sinatra had a &quot;fairly rangy voice&quot;, remarking that &quot;His voice has a very strident, insistent sound in the top register, a smooth lyrical sound in the middle register, and a very tender sound in the low. His voice is built on infinite taste, with an overall inflection of sex. He points everything he does from a sexual standpoint&quot;. 

Despite his heavy New Jersey accent, when Sinatra sang, his accent was barely detectable; according to Richard Schuller, his diction became &quot;precise&quot; while singing and his articulation &quot;meticulous&quot;. His timing was impeccable, allowing him, according to Charles L. Granata, to &quot;toy with the rhythm of a melody, bringing tremendous excitement to his reading of a lyric.&quot; Tommy Dorsey observed that Sinatra would &quot;take a musical phrase and play it all the way through seemingly without breathing for eight, ten, maybe sixteen bars.&quot; Dorsey was a considerable influence on Sinatra&#x27;s techniques for his vocal phrasing with his own exceptional breath control on the trombone, and Sinatra regularly swam and held his breath underwater, thinking of song lyrics to increase his breathing power.

Arrangers such as Nelson Riddle and Anthony Fanzo found Sinatra to be a perfectionist who constantly drove himself and others around him, stating that his collaborators approached him with uneasiness because of his unpredictable and often volatile temperament. 

Granata comments that Sinatra was almost fanatically obsessed with perfection to the point that people began wondering if he was genuinely concerned about the music or showing off his power over others. On days when he felt that his voice was not right, he would know after only a few notes and would postpone the recording session until the following day, yet still pay his musicians. 

After a period of performing, Sinatra tired of singing a certain set of songs and was always looking for talented new songwriters and composers to work with. Once he found ones that he liked, he actively sought to work with them as often as he could and made friends with many of them. Over the years, he recorded 87 of Sammy Cahn&#x27;s songs, of which 24 were composed by Jule Styne and 43 by Jimmy Van Heusen. The Cahn-Styne partnership lasted from 1942 until 1954, when Van Heusen succeeded him as Sinatra&#x27;s main composer.

Unlike many of his contemporaries, Sinatra insisted upon direct input regarding arrangements and tempos for his recordings. He would spend weeks thinking about the songs he wanted to record and would keep an arranger in mind for each song. Barbara Sinatra notes that Sinatra would almost always credit the songwriter at the end of each number and would often make comments to the audience, such as &quot;Isn&#x27;t that a pretty ballad&quot; or &quot;Don&#x27;t you think that&#x27;s the most marvelous love song&quot;, delivered with &quot;childlike delight&quot;. She states that after each show, Sinatra would be &quot;in a buoyant, electrically charged mood, a post-show high that would take him hours to come down from as he quietly relived every note of the performance he&#x27;d just given.&quot;

Sinatra&#x27;s split with Gardner in the fall of 1953 had a profound impact on the types of songs he sang and on his voice. He began to console himself in songs with a &quot;brooding melancholy&quot;, such as &quot;I&#x27;m a Fool to Want You&quot;, &quot;Don&#x27;t Worry &#x27;Bout Me&quot;, &quot;My One and Only Love&quot; and &quot;There Will Never Be Another You&quot;, which Riddle believed was the direct influence of Ava Gardner. 

Lahr comments that the new Sinatra was &quot;not the gentle boy balladeer of the forties. Fragility had gone from his voice, to be replaced by a virile adult&#x27;s sense of happiness and hurt&quot;. Author Granata considered Sinatra a &quot;master of the art of recording&quot;, noting that his work in the studio &quot;set him apart from other gifted vocalists.&quot; During his career, he made over 1000 recordings. Recording sessions would typically last three hours. However, Sinatra would always prepare for them by spending at least an hour by the piano beforehand to vocalize, followed by a short rehearsal with the orchestra to ensure the balance of sound. 

During his Columbia years, Sinatra used an RCA Type 44 microphone, which Granata describes as &quot;the &#x27;old-fashioned&#x27; microphone which is closely associated with Sinatra&#x27;s crooner image of the 1940s&quot;. At Capitol, he used a Neumann U 47, an &quot;ultra-sensitive&quot; microphone that better captured the timbre and tone of his voice.

In the 1950s, Sinatra&#x27;s career was facilitated by developments in technology. Up to sixteen songs could now be held by the twelve-inch L.P., and this allowed Sinatra to use song in a novelistic way, turning each track into a kind of chapter, which built and counterpointed moods to illuminate a larger theme&quot;. Santopietro writes that through the 1950s and well into the 1960s, &quot;Every Sinatra LP was a masterpiece of one sort of another, whether uptempo, torch song, or swingin&#x27; affairs. Track after track, the brilliant concept albums redefined the nature of pop vocal art&quot;.

== Film career ==
=== 1941–1952: Debut, musical films, and career slump ===
Sinatra attempted to pursue an acting career in Hollywood in the early 1940s. While films appealed to him, being exceptionally self-confident, he was rarely enthusiastic about his own acting, once remarking that &quot;pictures stink&quot;. Sinatra made his film debut performing in an uncredited sequence in &quot;Las Vegas Nights&quot; (1941), singing &quot;I&#x27;ll Never Smile Again&quot; with Tommy Dorsey&#x27;s Pied Pipers. He had a cameo role along with Duke Ellington and Count Basie in Charles Barton&#x27;s &quot;Reveille with Beverly&quot; (1943), making a brief appearance singing &quot;Night and Day&quot;. Next, he was given leading roles in &quot;Higher and Higher&quot; and &quot;Step Lively&quot; (both 1944) for RKO.
Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer cast Sinatra opposite Gene Kelly and Kathryn Grayson in the Technicolor musical &quot;Anchors Aweigh&quot; (1945), in which he played a sailor on leave in Hollywood. A major success, it garnered several Academy Award wins and nominations, and the song &quot;I Fall in Love Too Easily&quot;, sung by Sinatra in the film, was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Song. He briefly appeared at the end of Richard Whorf&#x27;s commercially successful &quot;Till the Clouds Roll By&quot; (1946), a Technicolor musical biopic of Jerome Kern, in which he sang &quot;Ol&#x27; Man River&quot;.

Sinatra co-starred again with Gene Kelly in the Technicolor musical &quot;Take Me Out to the Ball Game&quot; (1949), in which they play baseball players who are part-time vaudevillians. He teamed up with Kelly for a third time in &quot;On the Town&quot; (1949), playing a sailor on leave in New York City. The film remains rated very highly by critics, and in 2006, it ranked No. 19 on the American Film Institute&#x27;s list of best musicals. Both &quot;Double Dynamite&quot; (1951), an RKO Irving Cummings comedy produced by Howard Hughes, and Joseph Pevney&#x27;s &quot;Meet Danny Wilson&quot; (1952) failed to make an impression.

=== 1953–1959: Career comeback and prime ===

Fred Zinnemann&#x27;s &quot;From Here to Eternity&quot; (1953) deals with the tribulations of three soldiers, played by Burt Lancaster, Montgomery Clift, and Sinatra, stationed on Hawaii in the months leading up to the attack on Pearl Harbor. Sinatra had long been desperate to find a film role that would bring him back into the spotlight, and Columbia Pictures boss Harry Cohn had been inundated by appeals from people across Hollywood to give Sinatra a chance to star as &quot;Maggio&quot; in the film. During production, Montgomery Clift became a close friend, and Sinatra later professed that he &quot;learned more about acting from him than anybody I ever knew before&quot;. After several years of critical and commercial decline, his Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor win helped him regain his position as the top recording artist in the world. His performance also won a Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor – Motion Picture. The &quot;Los Angeles Examiner&quot; wrote that Sinatra is &quot;simply superb, comical, pitiful, childishly brave, pathetically defiant&quot;, commenting that his death scene is &quot;one of the best ever photographed&quot;.

Sinatra starred opposite Doris Day in the musical film &quot;Young at Heart&quot; (1954), and earned critical praise for his performance as a psychopathic killer posing as an FBI agent opposite Sterling Hayden in the film noir &quot;Suddenly&quot; (1954).

Sinatra was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actor and BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role for his role as a heroin addict in &quot;The Man with the Golden Arm&quot; (1955). After roles in &quot;Guys and Dolls&quot;, and &quot;The Tender Trap&quot; (both 1955), Sinatra was nominated for a BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role for his role as a medical student in Stanley Kramer&#x27;s directorial début, &quot;Not as a Stranger&quot; (1955). During production, Sinatra got drunk with Robert Mitchum and Broderick Crawford and trashed Kramer&#x27;s dressing room. Kramer vowed at the time never to hire Sinatra again and later regretted casting him as a Spanish guerrilla leader in &quot;The Pride and the Passion&quot; (1957).
Sinatra featured alongside Bing Crosby and Grace Kelly in &quot;High Society&quot; (1956) for MGM, earning a reported $250,000 for the picture. The public rushed to the cinemas to see Sinatra and Crosby together on-screen, and it ended up earning over $13million at the box office, becoming one of the highest-grossing pictures of its year. He starred opposite Rita Hayworth and Kim Novak in George Sidney&#x27;s &quot;Pal Joey&quot; (1957), for which Sinatra won a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy. Santopietro considers the scene in which Sinatra sings &quot;The Lady Is a Tramp&quot; to have been the finest moment of his film career. He next portrayed comedian Joe E. Lewis in &quot;The Joker Is Wild&quot; (1957); the song &quot;All the Way&quot; won the Academy Award for Best Original Song. By 1958, Sinatra was one of the ten biggest box office draws in the United States, appearing with Dean Martin and Shirley MacLaine in Vincente Minnelli&#x27;s &quot;Some Came Running&quot; and &quot;Kings Go Forth&quot; (both 1958) with Tony Curtis and Natalie Wood. &quot;High Hopes&quot;, sung by Sinatra in the Frank Capra comedy, &quot;A Hole in the Head&quot; (1959), won the Academy Award for Best Original Song, and became a chart hit, lasting on the Hot 100 for 17 weeks.

=== 1960–1980: Later career ===

Due to an obligation, he owed to 20th Century Fox for walking off the set of Henry King&#x27;s &quot;Carousel&quot; (1956), Sinatra starred opposite Shirley MacLaine, Maurice Chevalier and Louis Jourdan in &quot;Can-Can&quot; (1960). He earned $200,000 and 25% of the profits for the performance. Around the same time, he starred in the Las Vegas-set &quot;Ocean&#x27;s 11&quot; (1960), the first film to feature the Rat Pack together and the start of a &quot;new era of screen cool&quot; for Santopietro. Sinatra personally financed the film and paid Martin and Davis fees of $150,000 and $125,000, respectively, sums considered exorbitant for the period. He had a leading role opposite Laurence Harvey in &quot;The Manchurian Candidate&quot; (1962), which he considered to be the role he was most excited about and the high point of his film career. Vincent Canby, writing for the magazine &quot;Variety&quot;, found the portrayal of Sinatra&#x27;s character to be &quot;a wide-awake pro creating a straight, quietly humorous character of some sensitivity.&quot; He appeared with the Rat Pack in the western &quot;Sergeants 3&quot; (1962), and again in the 1964 gangster-oriented musical &quot;Robin and the 7 Hoods&quot;. For his performance in &quot;Come Blow Your Horn&quot; (1963), adapted from the Neil Simon play, he was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor– Motion Picture Musical or Comedy.
Sinatra directed &quot;None but the Brave&quot; (1965), and &quot;Von Ryan&#x27;s Express&quot; (1965) was a major success. In the late 1960s, Sinatra became known for playing detectives, including Tony Rome in &quot;Tony Rome&quot; (1967) and its sequel &quot;Lady in Cement&quot; (1968). He played a similar role in &quot;The Detective&quot; (1968). As &quot;Die Hard&quot; was based on the novel sequel to &quot;The Detective&quot;, the studio was contractually obliged to offer Sinatra the role. Sinatra, who was 70 at the time, declined.

Sinatra starred opposite George Kennedy in the western &quot;Dirty Dingus Magee&quot; (1970), an &quot;abysmal&quot; affair according to Santopietro, which was panned by the critics. The following year, Sinatra received a Golden Globe Cecil B. DeMille Award and had intended to play Detective Harry Callahan in &quot;Dirty Harry&quot; (1971), but had to turn down the role due to developing Dupuytren&#x27;s contracture in his hand. Sinatra&#x27;s last major film role was opposite Faye Dunaway in Brian G. Hutton&#x27;s &quot;The First Deadly Sin&quot; (1980). Santopietro said that as a troubled New York City homicide cop, Sinatra gave an &quot;extraordinarily rich&quot;, heavily layered characterization, one which &quot;made for one terrific farewell&quot; to his film career.

== Television and radio career ==

After beginning on the &quot;Major Bowes Amateur Hour&quot; radio show with the Hoboken Four in 1935, and later WNEW and WAAT in Jersey City, Sinatra became the star of radio shows of his own on NBC and CBS from the early 1940s to the mid-1950s. In 1942, Sinatra hired arranger Axel Stordahl away from Tommy Dorsey before he began his first radio program that year, keeping Stordahl with him for all of his radio work.. By the end of 1942, he was named the &quot;Most Popular Male Vocalist on Radio&quot; in a &quot;DownBeat&quot; poll. Early on he frequently worked with The Andrews Sisters on radio. They would appear as guests on each other&#x27;s shows, as well as on many USO shows broadcast to troops via the Armed Forces Radio Service (AFRS). He appeared as a special guest in the sisters&#x27; ABC &quot;Eight-to-the-Bar Ranch&quot; series, while the trio in turn guested on his &quot;Songs by Sinatra&quot; series on CBS. Sinatra had two stints as a regular member of the cast of &quot;Your Hit Parade&quot;; his first was from 1943 to 1945, and second was from 1946 to May 28, 1949, during which he was paired with the then-new girl singer, Doris Day. Starting in September 1949, the BBD&amp;O advertising agency produced a radio series starring Sinatra for Lucky Strike called &quot;Light Up Time&quot;– some 176 15-minute shows that featured him and Dorothy Kirsten singing– which lasted through to May 1950.

In October 1951, the second season of &quot;The Frank Sinatra Show&quot; began on CBS Television. Ultimately, Sinatra did not find the success on television for which he had hoped. Santopietro writes that Sinatra &quot;never appeared fully at ease on his own television series.&quot; In 1953 and 1954, Sinatra starred in the NBC radio program &quot;Rocky Fortune&quot;, portraying Rocco Fortunato (a.k.a. Rocky Fortune).
In 1957, Sinatra formed a three-year $3million contract with ABC to launch &quot;The Frank Sinatra Show&quot;, featuring himself and guests in 36 half-hour shows. ABC agreed to allow Sinatra&#x27;s Hobart Productions to keep 60% of the residuals and bought stock in Sinatra&#x27;s film production unit, Kent Productions, guaranteeing him $7million. Though an initial critical success upon its debut on October 18, 1957, it soon attracted negative reviews from &quot;Variety&quot; and &quot;The New Republic&quot;, and &quot;The Chicago Sun-Times&quot; thought that Sinatra and frequent guest Dean Martin &quot;performed like a pair of adult delinquents&quot;, &quot;sharing the same cigarette and leering at girls.&quot; In return, Sinatra later made numerous appearances on &quot;The Dean Martin Show&quot; and Martin&#x27;s TV specials.

Sinatra&#x27;s fourth and final Timex TV special, &quot;Welcome Home Elvis&quot;, was broadcast in March 1960, earning massive viewing figures. During the show, he performed a duet with Presley, who sang Sinatra&#x27;s 1957 hit &quot;Witchcraft&quot; with the host performing the 1956 Presley classic &quot;Love Me Tender&quot;. Sinatra had previously been highly critical of Elvis Presley and rock and roll in the 1950s, describing it as a &quot;deplorable, a rancid smelling aphrodisiac&quot; that &quot;fosters almost totally negative and destructive reactions in young people.&quot; A CBS News special about Sinatra&#x27;s 50th birthday, &quot;Frank Sinatra: A Man and His Music&quot;, was broadcast on November 16, 1965, and received an Emmy award and a Peabody Award.

Continuing his musical collaboration with Jobim and Ella Fitzgerald in 1967, Sinatra appeared in the TV special, &quot;A Man and His Music + Ella + Jobim&quot;, which was broadcast on CBS on November 13. When Sinatra came out of retirement in 1973, he appeared in a TV special that shared its title with his contemporaneously released album, &quot;Ol&#x27; Blue Eyes Is Back&quot;. In the late 1970s, John Denver appeared as a guest in the &quot;Sinatra and Friends&quot; ABC-TV Special, singing &quot;September Song&quot; as a duet.

Sinatra starred as a detective in &quot;Contract on Cherry Street&quot; (1977), cited as his &quot;one starring role in a dramatic television film&quot;. Ten years later, he made a guest appearance opposite Tom Selleck in &quot;Magnum, P.I.&quot;. Shot in January 1987, the episode aired on CBS on February 25.

== Personal life ==
Sinatra was married to Nancy Sinatra (née Barbato) from 1939 to 1951. The couple had three children, Nancy (born 1940), Frank Jr. (1944–2016), and Tina (born 1948).

Sinatra met Barbato in Long Branch, New Jersey, in the summer of 1934 while working as a lifeguard. He agreed to marry her after an incident at &quot;The Rustic Cabin&quot; that led to his arrest. Sinatra had numerous extramarital affairs, and gossip magazines published details of affairs with women including Marilyn Maxwell, Lana Turner, Joi Lansing, and Marilyn Monroe.

Sinatra was married to Hollywood actress Ava Gardner from 1951 to 1957. It was a turbulent marriage with many well-publicized fights and altercations. The couple formally announced their separation on October 29, 1953, through MGM. Gardner filed for divorce in June 1954, at a time when she was dating matador Luis Miguel Dominguín, but the divorce was not settled until 1957. Sinatra continued to feel very strongly for her, and they remained friends for life.

Sinatra reportedly broke off engagements to Lauren Bacall in 1958 and Juliet Prowse in 1962. He was romantically linked to Pat Sheehan, Vikki Dougan, and Kipp Hamilton. Sinatra and Mia Farrow were married on July 19, 1966, and the couple divorced in August 1968. They remained close friends for life, and in a 2013 interview, Farrow said that Sinatra might be the father of her son, Ronan Farrow (born 1987). In a 2015 &quot;CBS Sunday Morning&quot; interview, Nancy Sinatra dismissed the claim as &quot;nonsense&quot;. She said that her father had a vasectomy years before Farrow&#x27;s birth.

Sinatra was married to Barbara Marx from 1976 until his death. The couple married on July 11, 1976, at Sunnylands, in Rancho Mirage, California, the estate of media magnate Walter Annenberg.

Sinatra was close friends with Jilly Rizzo, songwriter Jimmy Van Heusen, golfer Ken Venturi, comedian Pat Henry, baseball manager Leo Durocher, and president John F. Kennedy (for whom he organized an inaugural ball with Peter Lawford). In his spare time, he enjoyed listening to classical music. He swam daily in the Pacific Ocean. He often played golf with Venturi at the course in Palm Springs, where he lived in the house &quot;Twin Palms&quot; he had commissioned from E. Stewart Williams in 1947 He liked painting, reading, and building model railways.

Though Sinatra was critical of the church on numerous occasions and had a pantheistic, Einstein-like view of God in his earlier life, he was inducted into the Catholic Sovereign Military Order of Malta in 1976, and he turned to Catholicism for healing after his mother died in a plane crash in 1977. He died as a practicing Catholic and had a Catholic burial.

=== Style and personality ===
Sinatra was known for his immaculate sense of style. He spent lavishly on expensive custom-tailored tuxedos and stylish pin-striped suits, which made him feel wealthy and important and that he was giving his very best to the audience. He was also obsessed with cleanliness—while with the Tommy Dorsey band, he developed the nickname &quot;Lady Macbeth&quot; because of frequent showering and switching his outfits. His deep blue eyes earned him the popular nickname &quot;Ol&#x27; Blue Eyes&quot;.
For Santopietro, Sinatra was the personification of America in the 1950s: &quot;cocky, eye on the main chance, optimistic, and full of the sense of possibility.&quot; Barbara Sinatra wrote, &quot;A big part of Frank&#x27;s thrill was the sense of danger that he exuded, an underlying, ever-present tension only those closest to him knew could be defused with humor.&quot; Cary Grant, a friend of Sinatra, stated that Sinatra was the &quot;most honest person he&#x27;d ever met&quot;, who spoke &quot;a simple truth, without artifice which scared people&quot;, and was often moved to tears by his performances. Jo-Caroll Dennison commented that he possessed &quot;great inner strength&quot; and that his energy and drive were &quot;enormous.&quot; A workaholic, he reportedly only slept four hours a night on average. Throughout his life, Sinatra had mood swings and bouts of mild to severe depression, stating to an interviewer in the 1950s that &quot;I have an over-acute capacity for sadness as well as elation.&quot; Barbara Sinatra stated that he would &quot;snap at anyone for the slightest misdemeanor&quot;, while Van Heusen said that when Sinatra got drunk, it was &quot;best to disappear.&quot;

Sinatra&#x27;s mood swings often developed into violence, directed at people he felt had crossed him, particularly journalists who gave him scathing reviews, publicists, and photographers. According to Rojek, he was &quot;capable of deeply offensive behavior that smacked of a persecution complex.&quot; He received negative press for fights with Lee Mortimer in 1947, photographer Eddie Schisser in Houston in 1950, Judy Garland&#x27;s publicist Jim Byron on the Sunset Strip in 1954, and for a confrontation with &quot;Washington Post&quot; journalist Maxine Cheshire in 1973, in which he implied that she was a cheap prostitute. His feud with then-&quot;Chicago Sun Times&quot; columnist Mike Royko began when Royko wrote a column questioning why Chicago police offered free protection to Sinatra when he had his own security. Sinatra wrote an angry letter in response, calling Royko a &quot;pimp&quot; and threatening to &quot;punch you in the mouth&quot; for speculating that he wore a toupée.

Sinatra was also known for his generosity, particularly after his comeback. Kelley notes that when Lee J. Cobb nearly died from a heart attack in June 1955, Sinatra flooded him with &quot;books, flowers, delicacies&quot;, paid his hospital bills, and visited him daily, telling him that his &quot;finest acting&quot; was yet to come.

=== Alleged organized-crime links and Cal Neva Lodge ===

Sinatra became the stereotype of the &quot;tough working-class Italian American&quot;, something which he embraced. He said that if it had not been for his interest in music, he would have likely ended up in a life of crime. Willie Moretti was Sinatra&#x27;s godfather and the notorious underboss of the Genovese crime family, and he helped Sinatra in exchange for kickbacks and was reported to have intervened in releasing Sinatra from his contract with Tommy Dorsey. Sinatra was present at the Mafia Havana Conference in 1946, and the press learned of his being there with Lucky Luciano. One newspaper published the headline &quot;Shame, Sinatra&quot;. He was reported to be a good friend of mobster Sam Giancana, Kelley quoted Jo-Carrol Silvers that Sinatra &quot;adored&quot; Bugsy Siegel and boasted to friends about him and how many people Siegel had killed. Kelley says that Sinatra and mobster Joseph Fischetti had been good friends from 1938 onward and acted like &quot;Sicilian brothers&quot;. She also states that Sinatra and Hank Sanicola were financial partners with Mickey Cohen in the gossip magazine &quot;Hollywood Night Life&quot;.

The FBI kept records amounting to 2,403 pages on Sinatra, who was a natural target with his alleged Mafia ties, his ardent New Deal politics, and his friendship with John F. Kennedy. The FBI kept him under surveillance for almost five decades beginning in the 1940s. The documents include accounts of Sinatra as the target of death threats and extortion schemes. The FBI documented that Sinatra was losing esteem with the Mafia as he grew closer to President Kennedy, whose younger brother Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy was leading a crackdown on organized crime. Sinatra said he was not involved: &quot;Any report that I fraternized with goons or racketeers is a vicious lie.&quot;

In 1960, Sinatra bought a share in the Cal Neva Lodge &amp; Casino, a casino hotel on the south shore of Lake Tahoe. Sinatra built the Celebrity Room theater, which attracted his show business friends Red Skelton, Marilyn Monroe, Victor Borge, Joe E. Lewis, Lucille Ball, Lena Horne, Juliet Prowse, the McGuire Sisters, and others. By 1962, he reportedly held a 50-percent share in the hotel. Sinatra&#x27;s gambling license was temporarily suspended by the Nevada Gaming Control Board in 1963 after Giancana was spotted on the premises. Due to ongoing pressure from the FBI and Nevada Gaming Commission on mobster control of casinos, Sinatra agreed to give up his share in Cal Neva and the Sands. That year, his son Frank Jr. was kidnapped but was eventually released unharmed. Sinatra&#x27;s gambling license was restored in February 1981, following support from Ronald Reagan.

== Political views and activism ==
Sinatra held varied political views throughout his life. His mother, Dolly, was a Democratic Party ward leader. After meeting President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1944, he subsequently heavily campaigned for the Democrats in the 1944 presidential election. According to Jo Carroll Silvers, in his younger years, Sinatra had &quot;ardent liberal&quot; sympathies and was &quot;so concerned about poor people that he was always quoting Henry Wallace.&quot; He was outspoken against racism, particularly toward black people and Italians, from a young age. In the early 1950s, he was among those who campaigned to combine the racially segregated musicians&#x27; unions in Los Angeles. In November 1945, Sinatra was invited by the mayor of Gary, Indiana, to try to settle a strike by white students of Froebel High School against the &quot;Pro-Negro&quot; policies of the new principal. His comments, while praised by liberal publications, led to accusations by some that he was a communist, which he denied. In the 1948 presidential election, Sinatra actively campaigned for President Harry S. Truman. In 1952 and 1956, he campaigned for Adlai Stevenson.
Of all the U.S. presidents he associated with during his career, he was closest to John F. Kennedy. Sinatra often invited Kennedy to Hollywood and Las Vegas, and the two would womanize and enjoy parties together. In January 1961, Sinatra and Peter Lawford organized the Inaugural Gala in Washington, D.C., held on the evening before President Kennedy was sworn into office. After taking office, Kennedy distanced himself from Sinatra due partly to Sinatra&#x27;s ties with the Mafia. In 1962, Sinatra was snubbed by the President as, during his visit to his Palm Springs, Kennedy stayed with the Republican Bing Crosby instead of Sinatra, citing FBI concerns about the latter&#x27;s alleged connections to organized crime. Sinatra had spared no expense upgrading the facilities at his home in anticipation of the President&#x27;s visit, fitting it with a heliport, which he smashed with a sledgehammer after the rejection. Despite the snub, when he learned of Kennedy&#x27;s assassination he reportedly sobbed in his bedroom for three days. Sinatra worked with Hubert H. Humphrey in 1968, and remained a supporter of the Democratic Party until the early 1970s. Although still a registered Democrat, Sinatra endorsed Republican Ronald Reagan for a second term as Governor of California in 1970. He officially changed allegiance in July 1972 when he supported Richard Nixon in the 1972 presidential election.

In the 1980 presidential election, Sinatra donated $4million to Ronald Reagan&#x27;s campaign. Sinatra arranged Reagan&#x27;s Presidential gala, as he had done for Kennedy. In 1985, Reagan presented Sinatra with the Presidential Medal of Freedom, remarking, &quot;His love of country, his generosity for those less fortunate... make him one of our most remarkable and distinguished Americans.&quot;

In June 1984, Sinatra performed at the State Dinner in the White House honoring Sri Lankan President J. R. Jayawardena at the invitation of Reagan.
Santopietro notes that Sinatra was a &quot;lifelong sympathizer with Jewish causes.&quot; He was awarded the Hollzer Memorial Award by the Los Angeles Jewish Community in 1949. He gave a series of concerts in Israel in 1962 and donated his entire $50,000 fee for appearing in a cameo role in &quot;Cast a Giant Shadow&quot; (1966) to the Youth Center in Jerusalem. On November 1, 1972, he raised $6.5million in bond pledges for Israel, and was given the Medallion of Valor for his efforts. The Frank Sinatra Student Center at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem was dedicated in his name in 1978.

From his youth, Sinatra displayed sympathy for black Americans and worked both publicly and privately all his life to help the struggle for equal rights. He blamed racial prejudice on the parents of children. Sinatra played a major role in the desegregation of Nevada hotels and casinos in the 1950s and 1960s. On January 27, 1961, Sinatra played a benefit show at Carnegie Hall for Martin Luther King Jr. and led his fellow Rat Pack members and Reprise label mates in boycotting hotels and casinos that refused entry to black patrons and performers. According to his son, Frank Jr., King sat weeping in the audience at one of his father&#x27;s concerts in 1963 as Sinatra sang &quot;Ol&#x27; Man River&quot;, a song from the musical &quot;Show Boat&quot; that is sung by a black American stevedore. When he changed his political affiliations in 1970, Sinatra became less outspoken on racial issues. Though he did much towards civil rights causes, it did not stop the occasional racial jibe from him and the other Rat Pack members toward Davis at concerts.

== Death and funeral ==

During the final years of his life, Sinatra was in ill health and was frequently hospitalized for heart and breathing problems, high blood pressure, pneumonia, and bladder cancer. He made no public appearances following a heart attack in February 1997. On the night of May 14, 1998, Sinatra died of another heart attack at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, with his wife Barbara at his side; he was 82. Barbara encouraged Sinatra to &quot;fight&quot; while attempts were made to stabilize him, and reported that his final words were, &quot;I&#x27;m losing.&quot; Sinatra&#x27;s daughter, Tina, later wrote that she and her siblings had not been notified of their father&#x27;s final hospitalization, and it was her belief that &quot;the omission was deliberate. Barbara would be the grieving widow &quot;alone&quot; at her husband&#x27;s side.&quot; The night after Sinatra&#x27;s death, the lights on the Empire State Building were turned blue, the lights at the Las Vegas Strip were dimmed in his honor, and the casinos stopped spinning for one minute. Significant increases in recording sales worldwide were reported by &quot;Billboard&quot; in the month of his death.

Sinatra&#x27;s funeral was held at the Church of the Good Shepherd in Beverly Hills, California, on May 20, 1998, with 400 mourners in attendance and thousands of fans outside. Gregory Peck, Tony Bennett, and Sinatra&#x27;s son, Frank Jr., addressed the mourners, who included many people from entertainment.

Sinatra was buried in a blue business suit; his grave, adorned with mementos from family members, was next to his parents in Desert Memorial Park in Cathedral City, California. The phrases &quot;The Best Is Yet to Come&quot;, and &quot;Beloved Husband &amp; Father&quot; were placed on Sinatra&#x27;s modest grave marker. Sinatra&#x27;s gravestone was changed to read &quot;Sleep Warm, Poppa&quot;, due to damage caused to the original gravestone under mysterious circumstances, according to the magazine &quot;Palm Springs Life&quot;.

== Legacy and honors ==
Robert Christgau referred to Sinatra as &quot;the greatest singer of the 20th century&quot;. His popularity is matched only by Bing Crosby, Elvis Presley, The Beatles, and Michael Jackson. For Santopietro, Sinatra was the &quot;greatest male pop singer in the history of America&quot;, who amassed &quot;unprecedented power onscreen and off&quot;, and &quot;seemed to exemplify the common man, an ethnic twentieth-century American male who reached the &#x27;top of the heap&#x27;, yet never forgot his roots.&quot; Santopietro argues that Sinatra created his world, which he was able to dominate—his career was centered around power, perfecting the ability to capture an audience.

Gus Levene commented that Sinatra&#x27;s strength was that when it came to lyrics, telling a story musically, Sinatra displayed a &quot;genius&quot; ability and feeling, which with the &quot;rare combination of voice and showmanship&quot; made him the &quot;original singer&quot; which others who followed most tried to emulate. George Roberts, a trombonist in Sinatra&#x27;s band, remarked that Sinatra had a &quot;charisma, or whatever it is about him, that no one else had.&quot; Biographer Arnold Shaw considered that &quot;If Las Vegas had not existed, Sinatra could have invented it.&quot; He quoted reporter James Bacon in saying that Sinatra was the &quot;swinging image on which the town is built&quot;, adding that no other entertainer quite &quot;embodied the glamour&quot; associated with Las Vegas. Sinatra is seen as one of the icons of the 20th century, and has three stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for his work in film and music.

In Sinatra&#x27;s native Hoboken, he was awarded the Key to the City by Mayor Fred M. De Sapio on October 30, 1947. In 2003, the city&#x27;s main post office was rededicated in his honor. A bronze plaque, placed two years before Sinatra&#x27;s death in 1998, marks the site of the house where he was born. There is also a marker in front of Hoboken Historical Museum, which has artifacts from his life and conducts Sinatra walking tours. Frank Sinatra Drive runs parallel to the Hudson River Waterfront Walkway. On the waterfront is Frank Sinatra Park, where a bronze plaque was placed in 1989 upon its opening. In the Frank Sinatra Park, a tall bronze statue of Sinatra was dedicated in 2021 on December 12, Sinatra&#x27;s birthday. A residence hall at Montclair State University in New Jersey was named in his honor. Other buildings named for Sinatra include the Frank Sinatra School of the Arts in Astoria, Queens, the Frank Sinatra International Student Center at Israel&#x27;s Hebrew University in Jerusalem dedicated in 1978, and the Frank Sinatra Hall at the USC School of Cinematic Arts in Los Angeles, California, dedicated in 2002. Wynn Resorts&#x27; Encore Las Vegas resort features a restaurant dedicated to Sinatra which opened in 2008. There are several streets and roads named in honor of Frank Sinatra in several states of the U.S.

Various items of memorabilia from Sinatra&#x27;s life and career, such as Frank Sinatra&#x27;s awards, gold records, and various personal items, are displayed at USC&#x27;s Frank Sinatra Hall in Los Angeles and at Wynn Resort&#x27;s Sinatra restaurant in Las Vegas.

The United States Postal Service issued a 42-cent stamp in honor of Sinatra in May 2008, commemorating the tenth anniversary of his death.
The United States Congress passed a resolution on May 20, 2008, designating May 13 as Frank Sinatra Day.

Sinatra received three Honorary Degrees during his lifetime. In May 1976, he was invited to speak at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas graduation commencement held at Sam Boyd Stadium. It was at this commencement that he was bestowed an Honorary Doctorate litterarum humanarum by the university. During his speech, Sinatra stated that his education had come from &quot;the school of hard knocks&quot; and that &quot;this is the first educational degree I have ever held in my hand. I will never forget what you have done for me today&quot;. In 1984 and 1985, Sinatra received an Honorary Doctorate of Fine Arts from Loyola Marymount University and an Honorary Doctorate of Engineering from the Stevens Institute of Technology.

In 2023, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked Sinatra at No. 19 on their list of the 200 Greatest Singers of All Time.

In 2024, a new road in North Bristol was named &quot;Sinatra Way&quot;, to commemorate Sinatra&#x27;s 1953 visit to Frenchay Hospital, which used to sit at the site of a new housing development.

== Film, television and stage portrayals ==
A television miniseries based on Sinatra&#x27;s life, titled &quot;Sinatra&quot;, was aired by CBS in 1992. The series was directed by James Steven Sadwith, who won an Emmy Award for Outstanding Individual Achievement in Directing for a Miniseries or a Special and starred Philip Casnoff as Sinatra. &quot;Sinatra&quot; was written by Abby Mann and Philip Mastrosimone and produced by Sinatra&#x27;s daughter, Tina.

Sinatra has subsequently been portrayed on screen by Ray Liotta (&quot;The Rat Pack&quot;, 1998), James Russo (&quot;Stealing Sinatra&quot;, 2003), Dennis Hopper (&quot;The Night We Called It a Day&quot;, 2003), and Robert Knepper (&quot;My Way&quot;, 2012), and spoofed by Joe Piscopo and Phil Hartman on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;. A biographical film directed by Martin Scorsese has long been planned. A 1998 episode of the BBC documentary series &quot;Arena&quot;, &quot;The Voice of the Century&quot;, focused on Sinatra. Alex Gibney directed a four-part biographical series on Sinatra, &quot;All or Nothing at All&quot;, for HBO in 2015. A musical tribute was aired on CBS television in December 2015 to mark Sinatra&#x27;s centenary. Sinatra was also portrayed by Rico Simonini in the 2018 feature film &quot;Frank &amp; Ava&quot;, which is based on a play by Willard Manus. Creed singer Scott Stapp also portrayed Sinatra in the 2024 feature film &quot;Reagan&quot;, a biopic of U.S. President Ronald Reagan. Martin Scorsese planned to make a film on Sinatra and his second wife Ava Gardner.

Sinatra believed that Johnny Fontane, a mob-associated singer in Mario Puzo&#x27;s novel &quot;The Godfather&quot; (1969), was based on him. Puzo wrote in 1972 that when the author and singer met in Chasen&#x27;s, Sinatra &quot;started to shout abuse&quot;, calling Puzo a &quot;pimp&quot; and threatening violence. Francis Ford Coppola, director of the film adaptation, said in the audio commentary that &quot;Obviously Johnny Fontane was inspired by a kind of Frank Sinatra character&quot;.

In 2023, a biopic jukebox stage musical titled &quot;&quot; by Joe DiPietro premiered at the Birmingham Repertory Theatre starring Tony Award-winning actor Matt Doyle as Sinatra.

<text>A funeral is a ceremony connected with the final disposition of a corpse, such as a burial or cremation, with the attendant observances. Funerary customs comprise the complex of beliefs and practices used by a culture to remember and respect the dead, from interment, to various monuments, prayers, and rituals undertaken in their honour. Customs vary between cultures and religious groups. Funerals have both normative and legal components. Common secular motivations for funerals include mourning the deceased, celebrating their life, and offering support and sympathy to the bereaved; additionally, funerals may have religious aspects that are intended to help the soul of the deceased reach the afterlife, resurrection or reincarnation.

The funeral usually includes a ritual through which the corpse receives a final disposition. Depending on culture and religion, these can involve either the destruction of the body (for example, by cremation, sky burial, decomposition, disintegration or dissolution) or its preservation (for example, by mummification). Differing beliefs about cleanliness and the relationship between body and soul are reflected in funerary practices. A memorial service (service of remembrance or celebration of life) is a funerary ceremony that is performed without the remains of the deceased person. In both a closed casket funeral and a memorial service, photos of the deceased representing stages of life would be displayed on an altar. Relatives or friends would give out eulogies in both services as well.

== Etymology ==
The word &quot;funeral&quot; comes from the Latin &quot;funus&quot;, which had a variety of meanings, including the corpse and the funerary rites themselves. Funerary art is art produced in connection with burials, including many kinds of tombs, and objects specially made for burial like flowers with a corpse.

==Overview==
Funeral rites pre-date modern &quot;Homo Sapiens&quot; and dated to at least 300,000 years ago. For example, in the Shanidar Cave in Iraq, in Pontnewydd Cave in Wales and at other sites across Europe and the Near East, Archaeologists have discovered Neanderthal skeletons with a characteristic layer of flower pollen. This deliberate burial and reverence given to the dead has been interpreted as suggesting that Neanderthals had religious beliefs, although the evidence is not unequivocal – while the dead were apparently buried deliberately, burrowing rodents could have introduced the flowers.

Substantial cross-cultural and historical research document funeral customs as a highly predictable, stable force in communities. Funeral customs tend to be characterized by five &quot;anchors&quot;: significant symbols, gathered community, ritual action, cultural heritage, and transition of the dead body (corpse).

==Religious funerals==
===Bahá&#x27;í Faith===
Funerals in the Bahá&#x27;í Faith are characterized by not embalming, a prohibition against cremation, using a chrysolite or hardwood casket, wrapping the body in silk or cotton, burial not farther than an hour (including flights) from the place of death, and placing a ring on the deceased&#x27;s finger stating, &quot;I came forth from God, and return unto Him, detached from all save Him, holding fast to His Name, the Merciful, the Compassionate.&quot; The Bahá&#x27;í funeral service also contains the only prayer that is permitted to be read as a group – congregational prayer, although most of the prayer is read by one person in the gathering. The Bahá&#x27;í decedent often controls some aspects of the Bahá&#x27;í funeral service, since leaving a will and testament is a requirement for Bahá&#x27;ís. Since there are no Bahá&#x27;í clergy, services are usually conducted under the guise, or with the assistance of, a Local Spiritual Assembly.

===Buddhist===
A Buddhist funeral marks the transition from one life to the next for the deceased. It also reminds the living of their own mortality. Cremation is the preferred choice, although burial is also allowed. Buddhists in Tibet perform sky burials where the body is exposed to be eaten by vultures. The body is dissected with a blade on the mountain top before the exposure. Crying and wailing is discouraged and the (body breakers who perform the ritual) laugh as if they are doing farm work. Tibetan Buddhists believe that a light-hearted atmosphere during the funeral helps the soul of the dead to get a better afterlife. After the vultures consume all the flesh the smash the bones into pieces and mix them with tsampa to feed to the vultures.

===Christian===

Congregations of varied denominations perform different funeral ceremonies, but most involve offering prayers, scripture reading from the Bible, a sermon, homily, or eulogy, and music. One issue of concern as the 21st century began was with the use of secular music at Christian funerals, a custom generally forbidden by the Catholic Church.

Christian burials have traditionally occurred on consecrated ground such as in churchyards. There are many funeral norms like in Christianity to follow. Burial, rather than a destructive process such as cremation, was the traditional practice amongst Christians, because of the belief in the resurrection of the body. Cremations later came into widespread use, although some denominations forbid them. The US Conference of Catholic Bishops said &quot;The Church earnestly recommends that the pious custom of burying the bodies of the deceased be observed; nevertheless, the Church does not prohibit cremation unless it was chosen for reasons contrary to Christian doctrine&quot; (canon 1176.3).

===Hindu===
Antyesti, literally &#x27;last rites&#x27; or &#x27;last sacrifice&#x27;, refers to the rite-of-passage rituals associated with a funeral in Hinduism. It is sometimes referred to as , or .

A dead adult Hindu is cremated, while a dead child is typically buried. The rite of passage is said to be performed in harmony with the sacred premise that the microcosm of all living beings is a reflection of a macrocosm of the universe. The soul (Atman, Brahman) is believed to be the immortal essence that is released at the ritual, but both the body and the universe are vehicles and transitory in various schools of Hinduism. They consist of five elements: air, water, fire, earth and space. The last rite of passage returns the body to the five elements and origins. The roots of this belief are found in the Vedas, for example in the hymns of Rigveda in section 10.16, as follows:

The final rites of a burial, in case of untimely death of a child, is rooted in Rigveda&#x27;s section 10.18, where the hymns mourn the death of the child, praying to deity Mrityu to &quot;neither harm our girls nor our boys&quot;, and pleads the earth to cover, protect the deceased child as a soft wool.

Among Hindus, the dead body is usually cremated within a day of death. The body is washed, wrapped in white cloth for a man or a widow, red for a married woman, the two toes tied together with a string, a (red mark) placed on the forehead. The dead adult&#x27;s body is carried to the cremation ground near a river or water, by family and friends, and placed on a pyre with feet facing south. The eldest son, or a male mourner, or a priest then bathes before leading the cremation ceremonial function. He circumambulates the dry wood pyre with the body, says a eulogy or recites a hymn in some cases, places sesame seed in the dead person&#x27;s mouth, sprinkles the body and the pyre with ghee (clarified butter), then draws three lines signifying (deity of the dead), (time, deity of cremation) and the dead. The pyre is then set ablaze, while the mourners mourn. The ash from the cremation is consecrated to the nearest river or sea. After the cremation, a period of mourning is observed for 10 to 12 days after which the immediate male relatives or the sons of the deceased shave their head, trim their nails, recites prayers with the help of priest or Brahmin and invite all relatives, kins, friends and neighbours to eat a simple meal together in remembrance of the deceased. This day, in some communities, also marks a day when the poor and needy are offered food in memory of the dead. In most Hindu communities the last day of the mourning is called as Terahveen (the thirteenth day), and on this day items of basic needs along with some favourite items of the deceased are donated to the priests. Also on the same day the eldest son of the family is ceremonially crowned (called &quot;Pagdi Rasm&quot;) for he is now the head of the family. A feast is also organised for Brahmins,family members, and friends. 

===Zoroastrianism===

The belief that bodies are infested by Nasu upon death greatly influenced Zoroastrian burial ceremonies and funeral rites. Burial and cremation of corpses was prohibited, as such acts would defile the sacred creations of earth and fire respectively. Burial of corpses was so looked down upon that the exhumation of &quot;buried corpses was regarded as meritorious.&quot; For these reasons, &quot;Towers of Silence&quot; were developed—, amphitheater like structures in which corpses were placed so carrion-eating birds could feed on them.

Sagdīd, meaning &#x27;seen by a dog,&#x27; is a ritual that must be performed as promptly after death as possible. The dog is able to calculate the degree of evil within the corpse, and entraps the contamination so it may not spread further, expelling Nasu from the body. Nasu remains within the corpse until it has been seen by a dog, or until it has been consumed by a dog or a carrion-eating bird. According to chapter 31 of the Denkard, the reasoning for the required consumption of corpses is that the evil influences of Nasu are contained within the corpse until, upon being digested, the body is changed from the form of nasa into nourishment for animals. The corpse is thereby delivered over to the animals, changing from the state of corrupted nasa to that of hixr, which is &quot;dry dead matter,&quot; considered to be less polluting.

A path through which a funeral procession has traveled must not be passed again, as Nasu haunts the area thereafter, until the proper rites of banishment are performed. Nasu is expelled from the area only after &quot;a yellow dog with four eyes, or a white dog with yellow ears&quot; is walked through the path three times. If the dog goes unwillingly down the path, it must be walked back and forth up to nine times to ensure that Nasu has been driven off.

Zoroastrian ritual exposure of the dead is first known of from the writings of the mid-5th century BCE Herodotus, who observed the custom amongst Iranian expatriates in Asia Minor. In Herodotus&#x27; account (Histories i.140), the rites are said to have been &quot;secret&quot;, but were first performed after the body had been dragged around by a bird or dog. The corpse was then embalmed with wax and laid in a trench.

While the discovery of ossuaries in both eastern and western Iran dating to the 5th and 4th centuries BCE indicates that bones were isolated, that this separation occurred through ritual exposure cannot be assumed: burial mounds, where the bodies were wrapped in wax, have also been discovered. The tombs of the Achaemenid emperors at Naqsh-e Rustam and Pasargadae likewise suggest non-exposure, at least until the bones could be collected. According to legend (incorporated by Ferdowsi into his Shahnameh), Zoroaster is himself interred in a tomb at Balkh (in present-day Afghanistan).

Writing on the culture of the Persians, Herodotus reports on the Persian burial customs performed by the Magi, which are kept secret. However, he writes that he knows they expose the body of male dead to dogs and birds of prey, then they cover the corpse in wax, and then it is buried. The Achaemenid custom is recorded for the dead in the regions of Bactria, Sogdia, and Hyrcania, but not in Western Iran.

The Byzantine historian Agathias has described the burial of the Sasanian general Mihr-Mihroe: &quot;the attendants of Mermeroes took up his body and removed it to a place outside the city and laid it there as it was, alone and uncovered according to their traditional custom, as refuse for dogs and horrible carrion&quot;.

Towers are a much later invention and are first documented in the early 9th century CE. The ritual customs surrounding that practice appear to date to the Sassanid era (3rd–7th century CE). They are known in detail from the supplement to the &quot;Shāyest nē Shāyest&quot;, the two &quot;Revayats&quot; collections, and the two Saddars.

===Islamic===


Funerals in Islam (called in Arabic) follow fairly specific rites. In all cases, however, sharia (Islamic religious law) calls for burial of the body, preceded by a simple ritual involving bathing and shrouding the body, followed by (prayer).

Burial rituals should normally take place as soon as possible and include:
* Bathing the dead body with water, camphor and leaves of ziziphus lotus, except in extraordinary circumstances as in battle.
* Enshrouding the dead body in a white cotton or linen cloth except extraordinary cases such as battle. In such cases apparel of corpse is not changed.
* Reciting the funeral prayer in all cases for a Muslim.
* Burial of the dead body in a grave in all cases for a Muslim.
* Positioning the deceased so that when the face or body is turned to the right side it faces Mecca.

The mourning period is 40 days long.

===Jewish===

In Judaism, funerals follow fairly specific rites, though they are subject to variation in custom. Halakha calls for preparatory rituals involving bathing and shrouding the body accompanied by prayers and readings from the Hebrew Bible, and then a funeral service marked by eulogies and brief prayers, and then the lowering of the body into the grave and the filling of the grave. Traditional law and practice forbid cremation of the body; the Reform Jewish movement generally discourages cremation but does not outright forbid it.

Burial rites should normally take place as soon as possible and include:
* Bathing the dead body.
* Enshrouding the dead body. Men are shrouded with a and then (outside the Land of Israel) with a (shawl), while women are shrouded in a plain white cloth.
* Keeping watch over the dead body.
* Funeral service, including eulogies and brief prayers.
* Burial of the dead body in a grave.
* Filling of the grave, traditionally done by family members and other participants at the funeral.
* In many communities, the deceased is positioned so that the feet face the Temple Mount in Jerusalem (in anticipation that the deceased will be facing the reconstructed Third Temple when the messiah arrives and resurrects the dead).

===Sikh===
In Sikhism death is not considered a natural process, an event that has absolute certainty and only happens as a direct result of God&#x27;s Will or Hukam. In Sikhism, birth and death are closely associated, as they are part of the cycle of human life of &quot;coming and going&quot; () which is seen as a transient stage towards Liberation (), understood as completely in unity with God. Sikhs believe in reincarnation.

Death is only the progression of the soul on its journey from God, through the created universe and back to God again. In life a Sikh is expected to constantly remember death so that they may be sufficiently prayerful, detached and righteous to break the cycle of birth and death and return to God.

The public display of grief by wailing or crying out loud at the funeral (called ) is discouraged and should be kept to a minimum. Cremation is the preferred method of disposal, burial and burial at sea are also allowed if by necessity or by the will of the person. Markers such as gravestones, monuments, etc. are not allowed, because the body is considered to be just the shell and the person&#x27;s soul is their real self.

On the day of the cremation, the body is washed and dressed and then taken to the Gurdwara or home where hymns (Shabadads) from Sri Guru Granth Sahib Ji, the Sikh Scriptures are recited by the congregation. Kirtan may also be performed by Ragis while the relatives of the deceased recite &quot;Waheguru&quot; sitting near the coffin. This service normally takes from 30 to 60 minutes. At the conclusion of the service, an Ardas is said before the coffin is taken to the cremation site.

At the point of cremation, a few more Shabadads may be sung and final speeches are made about the deceased person. The eldest son or a close relative generally lights the fire. This service usually lasts about 30 to 60 minutes. The ashes are later collected and disposed of by immersing them in a river, preferably one of the five rivers in the state of Punjab, India.

The ceremony in which the Sidharan Paath is begun after the cremation ceremony, may be held when convenient, wherever the Sri Guru Granth Sahib Ji is present.

Hymns are sung from Sri Guru Granth Sahib Ji; the first five and final verses of &quot;Anand Sahib,&quot; the &quot;Song of Bliss,&quot; are recited or sung. The first five verses of Sikhism&#x27;s morning prayer, &quot;Japji Sahib&quot;, are read aloud to begin the Sidharan paath. A hukam, or random verse, is then read from Sri Guru Granth Sahib Ji. Ardas, a prayer, is offered, and Prashad, a sacred sweet, is distributed. Langar, a meal, is then served to guests.

While the Sidharan paath is being read, the family may also sing hymns daily. Reading may take as long as needed to complete the paath.

This ceremony is followed by Sahaj Paath Bhog, Kirtan Sohila, night time prayer is recited for one week, and finally Ardas called the &quot;Antim Ardas&quot; (&quot;Final Prayer&quot;) is offered the last week.

===Celtic===
It was custom for an officiant to walk in front of the coffin with a horse&#x27;s skull; this tradition was still observed by Welsh peasants up until the 19th century.

==Western funerals==
===Classical antiquity===
====Ancient Greece====

The Greek word for funeral – &quot;kēdeía&quot; (κηδεία) – derives from the verb &quot;kēdomai&quot; (κήδομαι), that means attend to, take care of someone. Derivative words are also &quot;kēdemón&quot; (κηδεμών, &quot;guardian&quot;) and &quot;kēdemonía&quot; (κηδεμονία, &quot;guardianship&quot;). From the Cycladic civilization in 3000 BCE until the Hypo-Mycenaean era in 1200–1100 BCE the main practice of burial is interment. The cremation of the dead that appears around the 11th century BCE constitutes a new practice of burial and is probably an influence from the East. Until the Christian era, when interment becomes again the only burial practice, both cremation and interment had been practiced depending on the area.

The ancient Greek funeral since the Homeric era included the &quot;próthesis&quot; (πρόθεσις), the &quot;ekphorá&quot; (ἐκφορά), the burial and the &quot;perídeipnon&quot; (περίδειπνον). In most cases, this process is followed faithfully in Greece until today.

&quot;Próthesis&quot; is the deposition of the body of the deceased on the funeral bed and the threnody of his relatives. Today the body is placed in the casket, that is always open in Greek funerals. This part takes place in the house where the deceased had lived. An important part of the Greek tradition is the &quot;epicedium&quot;, the mournful songs that are sung by the family of the deceased along with professional mourners (who are extinct in the modern era). The deceased was watched over by his beloved the entire night before the burial, an obligatory ritual in popular thought, which is maintained still.

&quot;Ekphorá&quot; is the process of transport of the mortal remains of the deceased from his residence to the church, nowadays, and afterward to the place of burial. The procession in the ancient times, according to the law, should have passed silently through the streets of the city. Usually certain favourite objects of the deceased were placed in the coffin in order to &quot;go along with him&quot;. In certain regions, coins to pay Charon, who ferries the dead to the underworld, are also placed inside the casket. A last kiss is given to the beloved dead by the family before the coffin is closed.
The Roman orator Cicero describes the habit of planting flowers around the tomb as an effort to guarantee the repose of the deceased and the purification of the ground, a custom that is maintained until today. After the ceremony, the mourners return to the house of the deceased for the &quot;perídeipnon&quot;, the dinner after the burial. According to archaeological findings – traces of ash, bones of animals, shards of crockery, dishes and basins – the dinner during the classical era was also organized at the burial spot. Taking into consideration the written sources, however, the dinner could also be served in the houses.

The &quot;Necrodeipnon&quot; (Νεκρόδειπνον) was the funeral banquet which was given at the house of the nearest relative.

Two days after the burial, a ceremony called &quot;the thirds&quot; was held. Eight days after the burial the relatives and the friends of the deceased assembled at the burial spot, where &quot;the ninths&quot; would take place, a custom still kept. In addition to this, in the modern era, memorial services take place 40 days, 3 months, 6 months, 9 months, 1 year after the death and from then on every year on the anniversary of the death. The relatives of the deceased, for an unspecified length of time that depends on them, are in mourning, during which women wear black clothes and men a black armband.

&quot;Nekysia&quot; (Νεκύσια), meaning the day of the dead, and &quot;Genesia&quot; (Γενέσια), meaning the day of the forefathers (ancestors), were yearly feasts in honour of the dead.

&quot;Nemesia&quot; (Νεμέσια) or &quot;Nemeseia&quot; (Nεμέσεια) was also a yearly feast in honour of the dead, most probably intended for averting the anger of the dead.

====Ancient Rome====

In ancient Rome, the eldest surviving male of the household, the &quot;pater familias&quot;, was summoned to the death-bed, where he attempted to catch and inhale the last breath of the decedent.

Funerals of the socially prominent usually were undertaken by professional undertakers called &quot;libitinarii&quot;. No direct description has been passed down of Roman funeral rites. These rites usually included a public procession to the tomb or pyre where the body was to be cremated. The surviving relations bore masks bearing the images of the family&#x27;s deceased ancestors. The right to carry the masks in public eventually was restricted to families prominent enough to have held &quot;curule magistracies&quot;. Mimes, dancers, and musicians hired by the undertakers, and professional female mourners, took part in these processions. Less well-to-do Romans could join benevolent funerary societies (&quot;collegia funeraticia&quot;) that undertook these rites on their behalf.

Nine days after the disposal of the body, by burial or cremation, a feast was given (&quot;cena novendialis&quot;) and a libation poured over the grave or the ashes. Since most Romans were cremated, the ashes typically were collected in an urn and placed in a niche in a collective tomb called a &quot;columbarium&quot; (literally, &quot;dovecote&quot;). During this nine-day period, the house was considered to be tainted, &quot;funesta&quot;, and was hung with Taxus baccata or Mediterranean Cypress branches to warn passersby. At the end of the period, the house was swept out to symbolically purge it of the taint of death.

Several Roman holidays commemorated a family&#x27;s dead ancestors, including the &quot;Parentalia&quot;, held February 13 through 21, to honor the family&#x27;s ancestors; and the Feast of the Lemures, held on May 9, 11, and 13, in which ghosts (&quot;larvae&quot;) were feared to be active, and the &quot;pater familias&quot; sought to appease them with offerings of beans.

The Romans prohibited cremation or inhumation within the sacred boundary of the city &quot;(pomerium)&quot;, for both religious and civil reasons, so that the priests might not be contaminated by touching a dead body, and that houses would not be endangered by funeral fires.

Restrictions on the length, ostentation, expense of, and behaviour during funerals and mourning gradually were enacted by a variety of lawmakers. Often the pomp and length of rites could be politically or socially motivated to advertise or aggrandise a particular kin group in Roman society. This was seen as deleterious to society and conditions for grieving were set. For instance, under some laws, women were prohibited from loud wailing or lacerating their faces and limits were introduced for expenditure on tombs and burial clothes.

The Romans commonly built tombs for themselves during their lifetime. Hence these words frequently occur in ancient inscriptions, V.F. Vivus Facit, V.S.P. Vivus Sibi Posuit. The tombs of the rich usually were constructed of marble, the ground enclosed with walls, and planted around with trees. But common sepulchres usually were built below ground, and called hypogea. There were niches cut out of the walls, in which the urns were placed; these, from their resemblance to the niche of a pigeon-house, were called columbaria.

===North American funerals===
Within the United States and Canada, in most cultural groups and regions, the funeral rituals can be divided into three parts: visitation, funeral, and the burial service. A home funeral (services prepared and conducted by the family, with little or no involvement from professionals) is legal in nearly every part of North America, but in the 21st century, they are uncommon in the US.
====Visitation====

At the &quot;visitation&quot; (also called a &quot;viewing&quot;, &quot;wake&quot; or &quot;calling hours&quot;), in Christian or secular Western custom, the body of the deceased person (or decedent) is placed on display in the casket (also called a coffin, however almost all body containers are caskets). The viewing often takes place on one or two evenings before the funeral. In the past, it was common practice to place the casket in the decedent&#x27;s home or that of a relative for viewing. This practice continues in many areas of Ireland and Scotland. The body is traditionally dressed in the decedent&#x27;s best clothes. In recent times there has been more variation in what the decedent is dressed in – some people choose to be dressed in clothing more reflective of how they dressed in life. The body will often be adorned with common jewelry, such as watches, necklaces, brooches, etc. The jewelry may be taken off and given to the family of the deceased prior to burial or be buried with the deceased. Jewelry has to be removed before cremation in order to prevent damage to the crematory. The body may or may not be embalmed, depending upon such factors as the amount of time since the death has occurred, religious practices, or requirements of the place of burial.

The most commonly prescribed aspects of this gathering are that the attendees sign a book kept by the deceased&#x27;s survivors to record who attended. In addition, a family may choose to display photographs taken of the deceased person during his/her life (often, formal portraits with other family members and candid pictures to show &quot;happy times&quot;), prized possessions and other items representing his/her hobbies and/or accomplishments. A more recent trend is to create a DVD with pictures and video of the deceased, accompanied by music, and play this DVD continuously during the visitation.

The viewing is either &quot;open casket&quot;, in which the embalmed body of the deceased has been clothed and treated with cosmetics for display; or &quot;closed casket&quot;, in which the coffin is closed. The coffin may be closed if the body was too badly damaged because of an accident or fire or other trauma, deformed from illness, if someone in the group is emotionally unable to cope with viewing the corpse, or if the deceased did not wish to be viewed. In cases such as these, a picture of the deceased, usually a formal photo, is placed atop the casket.
However, this step is foreign to Judaism; Jewish funerals are held soon after death (preferably within a day or two, unless more time is needed for relatives to come), and the corpse is never displayed. Torah law forbids embalming. Traditionally flowers (and music) are not sent to a grieving Jewish family as it is a reminder of the life that is now lost. The Jewish shiva tradition discourages family members from cooking, so food is brought by friends and neighbors. (&quot;See also Jewish bereavement.&quot;)

The decedent&#x27;s closest friends and relatives who are unable to attend frequently send flowers to the viewing, with the exception of a Jewish funeral, where flowers would not be appropriate (donations are often given to a charity instead).

Obituaries sometimes contain a request that attendees do not send flowers (e.g. &quot;In lieu of flowers&quot;). The use of these phrases has been on the rise for the past century. In the US in 1927, only 6% of the obituaries included the directive, with only 2% of those mentioned charitable contributions instead. By the middle of the century, they had grown to 15%, with over 54% of those noting a charitable contribution as the preferred method of expressing sympathy.

====Funeral====

The deceased is usually transported from the funeral home to a church in a hearse, a specialized vehicle designed to carry casketed remains. The deceased is often transported in a procession (also called a funeral cortège), with the hearse, funeral service vehicles, and private automobiles traveling in a procession to the church or other location where the services will be held. In a number of jurisdictions, special laws cover funeral processions – such as requiring most other vehicles to give right-of-way to a funeral procession. Funeral service vehicles may be equipped with light bars and special flashers to increase their visibility on the roads. They may also all have their headlights on, to identify which vehicles are part of the cortege, although the practice also has roots in ancient Roman customs. After the funeral service, if the deceased is to be buried the funeral procession will proceed to a cemetery if not already there. If the deceased is to be cremated, the funeral procession may then proceed to the crematorium.
Funeral customs vary from country to country. In the United States, any type of noise other than quiet whispering or mourning is considered disrespectful.

A burial tends to cost more than a cremation.

====Burial service====

At a religious burial service, conducted at the side of the grave, tomb, mausoleum or cremation, the body of the decedent is buried or cremated at the conclusion.

Sometimes, the burial service will immediately follow the funeral, in which case a funeral procession travels from the site of the funeral to the burial site. In some other cases, the burial service is the funeral, in which case the procession might travel from the cemetery office to the grave site. Other times, the burial service takes place at a later time, when the final resting place is ready, if the death occurred in the middle of winter.

If the decedent served in a branch of the Armed forces, military rites are often accorded at the burial service.

In many religious traditions, pallbearers, usually males who are relatives or friends of the decedent, will carry the casket from the chapel (of a funeral home or church) to the hearse, and from the hearse to the site of the burial service.

Most religions expect coffins to be kept closed during the burial ceremony. In Eastern Orthodox funerals, the coffins are reopened just before burial to allow mourners to look at the deceased one last time and give their final farewells. Greek funerals are an exception as the coffin is open during the whole procedure unless the state of the body does not allow it.
Morticians may ensure that all jewelry, including wristwatch, that were displayed at the wake are in the casket before it is buried or entombed. Custom requires that everything goes into the ground; however this is not true for Jewish services. Jewish tradition stipulates that nothing of value is buried with the deceased.

In the case of cremation such items are usually removed before the body goes into the furnace. Pacemakers are removed prior to cremation – if left in they could explode.

===Indigenous Americans===
Funerals for indigenous people, like many other cultures, are a method to remember, commemorate and respect the dead through their own cultural practices and traditions.

==== California ====
In the past, there has been scrutiny when the topic of indigenous funeral sites was approached. Thus the federal government deemed it necessary to include a series of acts that would protect and accurately affiliate some of these burials with their correct native individuals or groups. This was enacted through the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act. Furthermore, in 2001 California created the California Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act that would &quot;require all state agencies and museums that receive state funding and that have possession or control over collections of humans remains or cultural items to provide a process for identification and repatriates of these items to appropriate tribes.&quot; In 2020, it was amended to include tribes that were beyond State and Federal knowledge.

=== Western Yuman region ===
In the Ipai, Tipai, Paipai, and Kiliwa regions funeral practices are similar in their social and power dynamics. The way that these funeral sites were created was based on previous habitation. Meaning, these were sites were their peoples may have died or if they had been a temporary home for some of these groups. Additionally, these individual burials were characterized by grave markers and/or grave offerings. The markers included inverted metates, fractured pieces of metates as well as cairns. As for offerings, food, shell and stone beads were often found in burial mounds along with portions human remains.

The state of the human remains found at the site can vary, data suggests that cremations are recent in prehistory compared to just burials. Ranging from the middle Holocene era to the Late Prehistoric Period. Additionally, the position these people were placed in plays a role in how the afterlife was viewed. With recent ethnographic evidence coming from the Yuman people, it is believed that the spirits of the dead could potentially harm the living. so, they would often layer the markers or offerings above the body so that they would be unable to &quot;leave&quot; their graves and enact harm.
====Tongva====
In the Los Angeles Basin, researchers discovered communal mourning features at West Bluffs and Landing Hill. These communal mourning rituals were estimated to have taken place during the Intermediate Period (3,000-1,000 B.P.). Archaeologists have found fragmented pieces of a large schist pestle which was deliberately broken in a methodical way. Other fragmented vessels show signs of uneven burning on the interior surface presumed to have been caused by burning combustible material.

In the West Bluffs and Landing Hill assemblages there are many instances of artifacts that were dyed in red ochre pigment after being broken. The tradition of intentionally breaking objects has been a custom in the region for thousands of years for the purpose of releasing the spirit within the object, reducing harm to the community, or as an expression of grief. Pigmentation of grave goods also has many interpretations, the Chumash associate the color red with both earth and fire. While some researchers consider the usage of the red pigment as an important transitional moment in the adult life cycle.

===Memorial services===

A memorial service is one given for the deceased, often without the body present. The service takes place &quot;after&quot; cremation or burial at sea, after donation of the body to an academic or research institution, or after the ashes have been scattered. It is also significant when the person is missing and presumed dead, or known to be deceased though the body is not recoverable. These services often take place at a funeral home; however, they can be held in a home, school, workplace, church or other location of some significance. A memorial service may include speeches (eulogies), prayers, poems, or songs to commemorate the deceased. Pictures of the deceased and flowers are usually placed where the coffin would normally be placed.

After the sudden deaths of important public officials, public memorial services have been held by communities, including those without any specific connection to the deceased. For examples, community memorial services were held after the assassinations of US presidents James A. Garfield and William McKinley.

===European funerals===
====United Kingdom====
In the UK, funerals are commonly held at a church, crematorium or cemetery chapel. Historically, it was customary to bury the dead, but since the 1960s, cremation has been more common.

While there is no visitation ceremony like in North America, relatives may view the body beforehand at the funeral home. A room for viewing is usually called a &quot;chapel of rest&quot;. Funerals typically last about half an hour. They are sometimes split into two ceremonies: a main funeral and a shorter &quot;committal&quot; ceremony. In the latter, the coffin is either handed over to a crematorium or buried in a cemetery. This allows the funeral to be held at a place without cremation or burial facilities. Alternatively, the entire funeral may be held in the chapel of the crematorium or cemetery. It is not customary to view a cremation; instead, the coffin may be removed from the chapel or hidden with curtains towards the end of the funeral.

After the funeral, it is common for the mourners to gather for refreshments. This is sometimes called a wake, though this is different from how the term is used in other countries, where a wake is a ceremony before the funeral.

====Finland====

In Finland, religious funerals (&quot;hautajaiset&quot;) are quite ascetic. The local priest or minister says prayers and blesses the deceased in their house. The mourners (&quot;saattoväki&quot;) traditionally bring food to the mourners&#x27; house. Common current practice has the deceased placed into the coffin in the place where they died. The undertaker will pick up the coffin and place it in the hearse and drive it to the funeral home, while the closest relatives or friends of the deceased will follow the hearse in a funeral procession in their own cars. The coffin will be held at the funeral home until the day of the funeral. The funeral services may be divided into two parts. First is the church service (&quot;siunaustilaisuus&quot;) in a cemetery chapel or local church, then the burial.

====Iceland====
====Italy====
The majority of Italians are Roman Catholic and follow Catholic funeral traditions. Historically, mourners would walk in a funeral procession to the gravesite; today vehicles are used.

====Greece====
Greek funerals are generally held in churches, including a Trisagion service. There is usually a 40-day mourning period, and the end of which, a memorial service is held. Every year following, a similar service takes place, to mark the anniversary of the death.

====Poland====

In Poland, in urban areas, there are usually two, or just one &quot;stop&quot;. The body, brought by a hearse from the mortuary, may be taken to a church or to a cemetery chapel. There is then a funeral mass or service at the cemetery chapel. Following the mass or Service the casket is carried in procession (usually on foot) by hearse to the grave. Once at the grave-site, the priest will commence the graveside committal service and the casket is lowered. The mass or service usually takes place at the cemetery.

In some traditional rural areas, the wake (&quot;czuwanie&quot;) takes place in the house of the deceased or their relatives. The body lies in state for three days in the house. The funeral usually takes place on the third day. Family, neighbors and friends gather and pray during the day and night on those three days and nights. There are usually three stages in the funeral ceremony (&quot;ceremonia pogrzebowa&quot;, &quot;pogrzeb&quot;): the wake (&quot;czuwanie&quot;), then the body is carried by procession (usually on foot) or people drive in their own cars to the church or cemetery chapel for mass, and another procession by foot to the gravesite.

After the funeral, families gather for a post-funeral get-together (&quot;stypa&quot;). It can be at the family home, or at a function hall. In Poland cremation is less popular because the Catholic Church in Poland prefers traditional burials (though cremation is allowed). Cremation is more popular among non-religious people and Protestants in Poland.

====Russia====
====Scotland====
An old funeral rite from the Scottish Highlands involved burying the deceased with a wooden plate resting on his chest. On the plate were placed a small amount of earth and salt, to represent the future of the deceased. The earth hinted that the body would decay and become one with the earth, while the salt represented the soul, which does not decay. This rite was known as &quot;earth laid upon a corpse&quot;. This practice was also carried out in Ireland, as well as in parts of England, particularly in Leicestershire, although in England the salt was intended to prevent air from distending the corpse.

====Spain====
In Spain, a burial or cremation may occur very soon after a death. Most Spaniards are Roman Catholics and follow Catholic funeral traditions. First, family and friends sit with the deceased during the wake until the burial. Wakes are a social event and a time to laugh and honor the dead. Following the wake comes the funeral mass (Tanatorio) at the church or cemetery chapel. Following the mass is the burial. The coffin is then moved from the church to the local cemetery, often with a procession of locals walking behind the hearse.
====Sweden====

The first Swedish evangelical order of burial was given in Olaus Petri&#x27;s handbook of 1529. From the medieval order, it had only kept burial and cremation. The funeral where the priest blessed the recently deceased, which after the Reformation came to be called a reading, was forbidden in the church order of 1686, but was taken over by lay people instead. It was then followed by the wake, which was banned by the church law in 1686, when it was often considered degenerate to do dancing and games where beer and brandy were served. It came however, to live on in the custom of &quot;singing out corpses&quot;. In older times, the grave was often shoveled closed during the hymn singing. During the 17th century, homilies became common, they were later replaced by grift speeches, which, however, never became mandatory. In 1686, it was decided that those who had lived a Christian life should be &quot;honestly and properly buried in a grave&quot;. It also determined that the burial would be performed by a priest in the Church of Sweden (later some religious communities were given the right to bury their dead themselves). Burial could only take place at a burial site intended for the purpose. Loss of honorable burial became a punishment. A distinction was made between silent burial (for some serious criminals) and quiet burial without singing and bell ringing and with abbreviated ritual (for some criminals, unbaptized children and for those who committed suicide). Church burial was compulsory for members of the Church of Sweden until 1926, when the possibility was opened for civil burial.

====Wales====
Traditionally, a good funeral (as they were called) had one draw the curtains for a period of time; at the wake, when new visitors arrived, they would enter from the front door and leave through the back door. The women stayed at home whilst the men attended the funeral, the village priest would then visit the family at their home to talk about the deceased and to console them.

The first child of William Price, a Welsh Neo-Druidic priest, died in 1884. Believing that it was wrong to bury a corpse, and thereby pollute the earth, Price decided to cremate his son&#x27;s body, a practice which had been common in Celtic societies.
The police arrested him for the illegal disposal of a corpse. Price successfully argued in court that while the law did not state that cremation was legal, it also did not state that it was illegal. The case set a precedent that, together with the activities of the newly founded Cremation Society of Great Britain, led to the &quot;Cremation Act 1902&quot;. The Act imposed procedural requirements before a cremation could occur and restricted the practice to authorised places.

==Other types of funerals==
=== Celebration of life ===
A growing number of families choose to hold a life celebration or celebration of life event for the deceased in addition to or instead of a traditional funeral. Unlike funerals, the focus of the ceremony is on the life that was lived. Such ceremonies may be held outside the funeral home or place of worship; restaurants, parks, pubs and sporting facilities are popular choices based on the specific interests of the deceased. Celebrations of life focus on a life that was lived, including the person&#x27;s best qualities, interests, achievements and impact, rather than mourning a death. Some events are portrayed as joyous parties, instead of a traditional somber funeral. Taking on happy and hopeful tones, celebrations of life discourage wearing black and focus on the deceased&#x27;s individuality. An extreme example might have &quot;a fully stocked open bar, catered food, and even favors.&quot; Notable recent celebrations of life ceremonies include those for René Angélil and Maya Angelou.

===Jazz funeral===

Originating in New Orleans, Louisiana, U.S., alongside the emergence of jazz music in late 19th and early 20th centuries, the jazz funeral is a traditionally African-American burial ceremony and celebration of life unique to New Orleans that involves a parading funeral procession accompanied by a brass band playing somber hymns followed by upbeat jazz music. Traditional jazz funerals begin with a processional led by the funeral director, family, friends, and the brass band, i.e., the &quot;main line&quot;, who march from the funeral service to the burial site while the band plays slow dirges and Christian hymns. After the body is buried, or &quot;cut loose&quot;, the band begins to play up-tempo, joyful jazz numbers, as the main line parades through the streets and crowds of &quot;second liners&quot; join in and begin dancing and marching along, transforming the funeral into a street festival.

===Green===
The terms &quot;green burial&quot; and &quot;natural burial&quot;, used interchangeably, apply to ceremonies that aim to return the body with the earth with little to no use of artificial, non-biodegradable materials. As a concept, the idea of uniting an individual with the natural world after they die appears as old as human death itself, being widespread before the rise of the funeral industry. Holding environmentally-friendly ceremonies as a modern concept first attracted widespread attention in the 1990s. In terms of North America, the opening of the first explicitly &quot;green&quot; burial cemetery in the U.S. took place in the state of South Carolina. However, the Green Burial Council, which came into being in 2005, has based its operations out of California. The institution works to officially certify burial practices for funeral homes and cemeteries, making sure that appropriate materials are used.

Religiously, some adherents of the Roman Catholic Church often have particular interest in &quot;green&quot; funerals given the faith&#x27;s preference to full burial of the body as well as the theological commitments to care for the environment stated in Catholic social teaching.

Those with concerns about the effects on the environment of traditional burial or cremation may be placed into a natural bio-degradable green burial shroud. That, in turn, sometimes gets placed into a simple coffin made of cardboard or other easily biodegradable material. Furthermore, individuals may choose their final resting place to be in a specially designed park or woodland, sometimes known as an &quot;ecocemetery&quot;, and may have a tree or other item of greenery planted over their grave both as a contribution to the environment and a symbol of remembrance.

===Humanist and otherwise not religiously affiliated===

Humanists UK organises a network of humanist funeral celebrants or officiants across England and Wales, Northern Ireland, and the Channel Islands and a similar network is organised by the Humanist Society Scotland. Humanist officiants are trained and experienced in devising and conducting suitable ceremonies for non-religious individuals. Humanist funerals recognise no &quot;afterlife&quot;, but celebrate the life of the person who has died. In the twenty-first century, humanist funerals were held for well-known people including Claire Rayner, Keith Floyd, Linda Smith, and Ronnie Barker.

In areas outside of the United Kingdom, Ireland has featured an increasing number of non-religious funeral arrangements according to publications such as &quot;Dublin Live&quot;. This has occurred in parallel with a trend of increasing numbers of people carefully scripting their own funerals before they die, writing the details of their own ceremonies. The Irish Association of Funeral Directors has reported that funerals without a religious focus occur mainly in more urbanized areas in contrast to rural territories. Notably, humanist funerals have started to become more prominent in other nations such as the Republic of Malta, in which civil rights activist and humanist Ramon Casha had a large scale event at the Radisson Blu Golden Sands resort devoted to laying him to rest. Although such non-religious ceremonies are &quot;a rare scene in Maltese society&quot; due to the large role of the Roman Catholic Church within that country&#x27;s culture, according to &quot;Lovin Malta&quot;, &quot;more and more Maltese people want to know about alternative forms of burial... without any religion being involved&quot;.

Actual events during non-religious funerals vary, but they frequently reflect upon the interests and personality of the deceased. For example, the humanist ceremony for the aforementioned Keith Floyd, a restaurateur and television personality, included a reading of Rudyard Kipling&#x27;s poetic work &quot;If—&quot; and a performance by musician Bill Padley. Organizations such as the Irish Institute of Celebrants have stated that more and more regular individuals request training for administering funeral ceremonies, instead of leaving things to other individuals.

More recently, some commercial organisations offer &quot;civil funerals&quot; that can integrate traditionally religious content.

===Police/fire services===

Funerals specifically for fallen members of fire or police services are common in United States and Canada. These funerals involve honour guards from police forces and/or fire services from across the country and sometimes from overseas. A parade of officers often precedes or follows the hearse carrying the fallen comrade. A traditional fire department funeral consists of two raised aerial ladders. The firefighters travel under the aerials on their ride, on the fire apparatus, to the cemetery. Once there, the grave service includes the playing of bagpipes. The pipes have come to be a distinguishing feature of a fallen hero&#x27;s funeral. Also a &quot;Last Alarm Bell&quot; is rung. A portable fire department bell is tolled at the conclusion of the ceremony.

===Masonic===
A Masonic funeral is held at the request of a departed Mason or family member. The service may be held in any of the usual places or a Lodge room with committal at graveside, or the complete service can be performed at any of the aforementioned places without a separate committal. Freemasonry does not require a Masonic funeral.

There is no single convention for a Masonic funeral service. Some Grand Lodges have a prescribed service (as it is a worldwide organisation). Some of the customs include the presiding officer wearing a hat while doing his part in the service, the Lodge members placing sprigs of evergreen on the casket, and a small white leather apron may being placed in or on the casket. The hat may be worn because it is Masonic custom (in some places in the world) for the presiding officer to have his head covered while officiating. To Masons, the sprig of evergreen is a symbol of immortality. A Mason wears a white leather apron, called a &quot;lambskin&quot;, on becoming a Mason, and he may continue to wear it even in death.

==Asian funerals==

In most East Asian, South Asian and many Southeast Asian cultures, the wearing of white is symbolic of death. In these societies, white or off-white robes are traditionally worn to symbolize that someone has died and can be seen worn among relatives of the deceased during a funeral ceremony. In Chinese culture, red is strictly forbidden as it is a traditionally symbolic color of happiness. Exceptions are sometimes made if the deceased has reached an advanced age such as 85, in which case the funeral is considered a celebration, where wearing white with some red is acceptable. Contemporary Western influence however has meant that dark-colored or black attire is now often also acceptable for mourners to wear (particularly for those outside the family). In such cases, mourners wearing dark colors at times may also wear a white or off-white armband or white robe.

Contemporary South Korean funerals typically mix western culture with traditional Korean culture, largely depending on socio-economic status, region, and religion. In almost all cases, all related males in the family wear woven armbands representing seniority and lineage in relation to the deceased, and must grieve next to the deceased for a period of three days before burying the body. During this period of time, it is customary for the males in the family to personally greet all who come to show respect. While burials have been preferred historically, recent trends show a dramatic increase in cremations due to shortages of proper burial sites and difficulties in maintaining a traditional grave. The ashes of the cremated corpse are commonly stored in columbaria.

===In Japan===
Most Japanese funerals are conducted with Buddhist and/or Shinto rites. Many ritually bestow a new name on the deceased; funerary names typically use obsolete or archaic kanji and words, to avoid the likelihood of the name being used in ordinary speech or writing. The new names are typically chosen by a Buddhist priest, after consulting the family of the deceased.

Religious thought among the Japanese people is generally a blend of Shintō and Buddhist beliefs. In modern practice, specific rites concerning an individual&#x27;s passage through life are generally ascribed to one of these two faiths. Funerals and follow-up memorial services fall under the purview of Buddhist ritual, and 90% Japanese funerals are conducted in a Buddhist manner[?]. Aside from the religious aspect, a Japanese funeral usually includes a wake, the cremation of the deceased, and inclusion within the family grave. Follow-up services are then performed by a Buddhist priest on specific anniversaries after death.

According to an estimate in 2005, 99% of all deceased Japanese are cremated. In most cases the cremated remains are placed in an urn and then deposited in a family grave. In recent years however, alternative methods of disposal have become more popular, including scattering of the ashes, burial in outer space, and conversion of the cremated remains into a diamond that can be set in jewelry.

===In the Philippines===

Funeral practices and burial customs in the Philippines encompass a wide range of personal, cultural, and traditional beliefs and practices which Filipinos observe in relation to death, bereavement, and the proper honoring, interment, and remembrance of the dead. These practices have been vastly shaped by the variety of religions and cultures that entered the Philippines throughout its complex history.

Most if not all present-day Filipinos, like their ancestors, believe in some form of an afterlife and give considerable attention to honouring the dead. Except amongst Filipino Muslims (who are obliged to bury a corpse less than 24 hours after death), a wake is generally held from three days to a week. Wakes in rural areas are usually held in the home, while in urban settings the dead is typically displayed in a funeral home. Friends and neighbors bring food to the family, such as &quot;pancit&quot; noodles and &quot;bibingka&quot; cake&quot;;&quot; any leftovers are never taken home by guests, because of a superstition against it. Apart from spreading the news about someone&#x27;s death verbally, obituaries are also published in newspapers. Although the majority of the Filipino people are Christians, they have retained some traditional indigenous beliefs concerning death.

===In Korea===
In Korea, funerals are typically held for three days and different things are done in each day.

The first day: on the day a person dies, the body is moved to a funeral hall. They prepare clothes for the body and put them into a chapel of rest. Then food is prepared for the deceased. It is made up of three bowls of rice and three kinds of Korean side dishes. Also, there has to be three coins and three straw shoes. This can be cancelled if the family of the dead person have a particular religion.

On the second day the funeral director washes the body and shrouding is done. Then, a family member of the dead person puts uncooked rice in the mouth of the body. This step does not have to be done if the family has a certain religion. After putting the rice in the mouth, the body is moved into a coffin. Family members, including close relatives, of the dead person will wear mourning clothing. Typically, mourning for a woman includes Korean traditional clothes, Hanbok, and mourning for man includes a suit. The color has to be black. The ritual ceremony begins when they are done with changing clothes and preparing foods for the dead person. The ritual ceremony is different depending on their religion. After the ritual ceremony family members will start to greet guests.

On the third day, the family decides whether to bury the body in the ground or cremate the body. In the case of burial, three family members sprinkle dirt on the coffin three times. In the case of cremation, there is no specific ritual; the only requirement is a jar to store burned bones and a place to keep the jar.

Other than these facts, in Korea, people who come to the funeral bring condolence money. Also, a food called Yukgaejang is served to guests, oftentimes with the Korean distilled drink called soju.

===In Mongolia===
In Mongolia, like many other cultures, funeral practices are the most important rituals that they follow[How so?]. They have mixed their rituals with Buddhists due to creating a new, unique way of death.

For Mongolians who are very strict about tradition, families choose from three different ways of burial: open-air burial which is most common, cremation, and embalming. Many factors go into deciding which funeral practice to do. These consisted of the family&#x27;s social standing, the cause of death, and the place of death. Embalming was mainly chosen by members of the Lamaistic Church; by choosing this practice, they are usually buried in a sitting position. This would show that they would always be in the position of prayer. Also, more important people such as nobles would be buried with weapons, horses and food in their coffins to help them prepare for the next world.

The coffin is designed and built by three to four relatives, mainly men. The builders bring planks to the hut where the dead is located and put together the box and the lid. The same people who build the coffin also decorate the funeral. Most of this work is done after dusk. With specific instruction, they work on decorations inside the youngest daughter&#x27;s house. The reason for this is so the deceased is not disturbed at night.

===In Vietnam===

In Vietnam, Buddhism is the most commonly practiced religion, however, most burial methods do not coincide with the Buddhist belief of cremation.

The body of the deceased is moved to a loved one&#x27;s house and placed in an expensive coffin. The body usually stays there for about three days, allowing time for people to visit and place gifts in the mouth. This stems from the Vietnamese belief that the dead should be surrounded by their family. This belief goes so far as to include superstition as well. If somebody is dying in Vietnamese culture, they are rushed home from the hospital so they can die there, because if they die away from home it is believed to be bad luck to take a corpse home.

Many services are also held in the Vietnamese burial practices. One is held before moving the coffin from the home and the other is held at the burial site. After the burial of the loved one, incense is burned at the gravesite and respect is paid to all the nearby graves. Following this, the family and friends return to the home and enjoy a feast to celebrate the life of the recently departed. Even after the deceased has been buried, the respect and honor continues. For the first 49 days after the burying, the family holds a memorial service every 7 days, where the family and friends come back together to celebrate the life of their loved one. After this, they meet again on the 100th day after the death, then 265 days after the death, and finally they meet on the anniversary of the death of their loved one, a whole year later, to continue to celebrate the glorious life of their recently departed.

The Vietnamese funeral, or đám giỗ, is a less somber occasion than most traditional Western funerals. The đám giỗ is a celebration of the deceased&#x27;s life and is centered around the deceased&#x27;s family.

Family members might wear a traditional garment called a mourning headband to signify their relationship with the deceased. Typical mourning headbands are thin strips of fabric that are wrapped around the wearer&#x27;s head. Traditionally, the deceased&#x27;s closest family members, such as children, siblings, spouses, and parents will wear white mourning headbands. More distant family members&#x27; headband colors may vary. In some cultures, the deceased&#x27;s nieces, nephews, or grandchildren may be required to wear white headbands with red dots. Other societies may encourage grandchildren to wear white headbands with blue dots. Fourth generation grandchildren often wear yellow mourning headbands.

The use of mourning headbands emphasizes the importance of personal and familial roles in Vietnamese society. It also allows funeral attendants to carefully choose their interactions and offer condolences to those closest to the deceased.

Traditionally, attendants of a Vietnamese funeral service are encouraged to wear the color white. In many East Asian cultures, white is viewed as a sign of loss and mourning. In Vietnam, members of the Caodaist faith believe that white represents purity and the ability to communicate beyond spiritual worlds.

==African funerals==
===Ancient Egypt===
===West African===
African funerals are usually open to many visitors. The custom of burying the dead in the floor of dwelling-houses has been to some degree prevalent on the Gold Coast of Africa. The ceremony depends on the traditions of the ethnicity the deceased belonged to. The funeral may last for as much as a week. Another custom, a kind of memorial, frequently takes place seven years after the person&#x27;s death. These funerals and especially the memorials may be extremely expensive for the family in question. Cattle, sheep, goats, and poultry, may be offered and then consumed.

The Ashanti and Akan ethnic groups in Ghana typically wear red and black during funerals. For special family members, there is typically a funeral celebration with singing and dancing to honor the life of the deceased. Afterwards, the Akan hold a sombre funeral procession and burial with intense displays of sorrow. Other funerals in Ghana are held with the deceased put in elaborate Fantasy coffins colored and shaped after a certain object, such as a fish, crab, boat, and even airplanes. The Kane Kwei Carpentry Workshop in Teshie, named after Seth Kane Kwei who invented this new style of coffin, has become an international reference for this form of art.

====Funeral practices of the Dagbamba====
===East African===
Evidence of Africa&#x27;s earliest funeral was found in Kenya in 2021. A 78,000 year old Middle Stone Age grave of a three-year-old child was discovered in Panga ya Saidi cave complex, Kenya. Researchers said the child&#x27;s head appeared to have been laid on a pillow. The body had been laid in a fetal position.

In Kenya funerals are an expensive undertaking. Keeping bodies in morgues to allow for fund raising is a common occurrence more so in urban areas. Some families opt to bury their dead in the countryside homes instead of urban cemeteries, thus spending more money on transporting the dead.

==Historical mausoleums==
===China===
====Mausoleum of the First Qin Emperor====

The first emperor of the Qin dynasty, Qin Shi Huang&#x27;s mausoleum is located in the Lintong District of Xi&#x27;an, Shaanxi Province. Qin Shi Huang&#x27;s tomb is one of the World Heritage sites in China. Its remarkable feature and size have been known as one of the most important historical sites in China. Qin Shi Huang is the first emperor who united China for the first time. The mausoleum was built in 247 BCE after he became the emperor of the Qin dynasty.

Ancient Chinese mausoleums have unique characteristics compared to other cultures[citation?]. Ancient Chinese thought that the soul remains even after death, (immortal soul) regarded funeral practices as an important tradition. From their long history, the construction of mausoleums has developed over time, creating monumental and massive ancient emperor&#x27;s tomb.

Archeologists have found more than 8,000 life-sized figures resembling an army surrounding the emperor&#x27;s tomb. The primary purpose of the placement of Terracotta Army is to protect the emperor&#x27;s tomb. The figures were composed of clay and fragments of pottery. The Terracotta Army represents soldiers, horses, government officials, and even musicians. The arrangement and the weapons they are carrying accurately represent the real formations and weapons of the time. Furthermore, facial features aren&#x27;t identical, each sculpture bearing a unique look.

====Imperial Tombs of the Ming and Qing Dynasties====

The Imperial Tombs of the Ming and Qing Dynasties are included as World Heritage Sites. The three Imperial Tombs of the Qin dynasty were added in 2000 and 2003. The three tombs were all built in the 17th century. The tombs have been constructed to memorialize the emperors of the Qing dynasty and their ancestors. In tradition, Chinese have followed Feng Shui to build and decorate the interior. All of the tombs are strictly made following the superstition of Feng Shui.

The Imperial Tombs of the Ming and Qing Dynasties clearly show the cultural and architectural tradition that has existed in the area for more than 500 years[citation?]. In Chinese culture, the tombs were considered as a portal between the world of the living and the dead[citation?]. Chinese believed that the portal would divide the soul into two parts. The half of the soul would go to heaven, and the other half would remain within the physical body.

==Mutes and professional mourners==
From about 1600 to 1914 Europe had two professions that have almost entirely disappeared. The mute appears in art quite frequently, but in literature is probably best known from Dickens&#x27;s &quot;Oliver Twist&quot; (1837–1839). Oliver is working for Mr Sowerberry when characterised thus: &quot;There&#x27;s an expression of melancholy in his face, my dear... which is very interesting. He would make a delightful mute, my love.&quot; And in &quot;Martin Chuzzlewit&quot; (1842–1844), Moult, the undertaker, states: &quot;This promises to be one of the most impressive funerals...no limitation of expense...I have orders to put on my whole establishment of mutes, and mutes come very dear, Mr Pecksniff&quot;.

The main function of a funeral mute was to stand around at funerals with a sad, pathetic face. A symbolic protector of the deceased, the mute would usually stand near the door of the home or church. In Victorian times, mutes would wear somber clothing including black cloaks, top hats with trailing hatbands, and gloves.

The professional mourner, generally a woman, would shriek and wail (often while clawing her face and tearing at her clothing), to encourage others to weep. Records document forms of professional mourning from Ancient Greece. The 2003 award-winning Philippine comedy &quot;Crying Ladies&quot; revolves around the lives of three women who are part-time professional mourners for the Chinese-Filipino community in Manila&#x27;s Chinatown. According to the film, the Chinese use professional mourners to help expedite the entry of a deceased loved one&#x27;s soul into heaven by giving the impression that he or she was a good and loving person, well-loved by many.

==State funeral==

High-ranking national figures such as heads of state, prominent politicians, military figures, national heroes and eminent cultural figures may be offered state funerals.

==Final disposition==
Common methods of disposal are:
* Burial of the entire body in the earth, often within a coffin or casket (also referred to as &quot;inhumation&quot; or &quot;interment&quot;)
* Permanent storage in an above-ground tomb or mausoleum (also referred to as &quot;immurement&quot;)
* Cremation, which burns soft tissue and renders much of the skeleton to ash. The remains may contain larger pieces of bone which are ground in a machine to the consistency of ash. The ashes are commonly stored in an urn, or scattered on land or water. In some cases, an urn can be placed inside a columbarium at a cemetery.

==Self-planned funerals==

Some people choose to make their funeral arrangements in advance so that at the time of their death, their wishes are known to their family. However, the extent to which decisions regarding the disposition of a decedent&#x27;s remains (including funeral arrangements) can be controlled by the decedent while still alive vary from one jurisdiction to another. In the United States, there are states which allow one to make these decisions for oneself if desired, for example by appointing an agent to carry out one&#x27;s wishes; in other states, the law allows the decedent&#x27;s next-of-kin to make the final decisions about the funeral without taking the wishes of the decedent into account.

The decedent may, in most U.S. jurisdictions, provide instructions as to the funeral by means of a last will and testament. These instructions can be given some legal effect if bequests are made contingent on the heirs carrying them out, with alternative gifts if they are not followed. This requires the will to become available in time; aspects of the disposition of the remains of US President Franklin Delano Roosevelt ran contrary to a number of his stated wishes, which were found in a safe that was not opened until after the funeral.

==Organ donation and body donation==
Some people donate their bodies to a medical school for use in research or education. Medical students frequently study anatomy from donated cadavers; they are also useful in forensic research. Some medical conditions, such as amputations or various surgeries can make the cadaver unsuitable for these purposes; in other cases the bodies of people who had certain medical conditions are useful for research into those conditions. Many medical schools rely on the donation of cadavers for the teaching of anatomy. It is also possible to arrange for donate organs and tissue after death for treating the sick, or even whole cadavers for forensic research at body farms.

<doc id="11185" wikidata="Q7252" url="?curid=11185" title="Feminism">
<text>Feminism is a range of socio-political movements and ideologies that aim to define and establish the political, economic, personal, and social equality of the sexes. Feminism holds the position that modern societies are patriarchal—they prioritize the male point of view—and that women are treated unjustly in these societies. Efforts to change this include fighting against gender stereotypes and improving educational, professional, and interpersonal opportunities and outcomes for women.

Originating in late 18th-century Europe, feminist movements have campaigned and continue to campaign for women&#x27;s rights, including the right to vote, run for public office, work, earn equal pay, own property, receive education, enter into contracts, have equal rights within marriage, and maternity leave. Feminists have also worked to ensure access to contraception, legal abortions, and social integration; and to protect women and girls from sexual assault, sexual harassment, and domestic violence. Changes in female dress standards and acceptable physical activities for women have also been part of feminist movements.

Many scholars consider feminist campaigns to be a main force behind major historical societal changes for women&#x27;s rights, particularly in the West, where they are near-universally credited with achieving women&#x27;s suffrage, gender-neutral language, reproductive rights for women (including access to contraceptives and abortion), and the right to enter into contracts and own property. Although feminist advocacy is, and has been, mainly focused on women&#x27;s rights, some argue for the inclusion of men&#x27;s liberation within its aims, because they believe that men are also harmed by traditional gender roles. Feminist theory, which emerged from feminist movements, aims to understand the nature of gender inequality by examining women&#x27;s social roles and lived experiences. Feminist theorists have developed theories in a variety of disciplines in order to respond to issues concerning gender.

Numerous feminist movements and ideologies have developed over the years, representing different viewpoints and political aims. Traditionally, since the 19th century, first-wave liberal feminism, which sought political and legal equality through reforms within a liberal democratic framework, was contrasted with labour-based proletarian women&#x27;s movements that over time developed into socialist and Marxist feminism based on class struggle theory. Since the 1960s, both of these traditions are also contrasted with the radical feminism that arose from the radical wing of second-wave feminism and that calls for a radical reordering of society to eliminate patriarchy. Liberal, socialist, and radical feminism are sometimes referred to as the &quot;Big Three&quot; schools of feminist thought.

Since the late 20th century, many newer forms of feminism have emerged. Some forms, such as white feminism and gender-critical feminism, have been criticized as taking into account only white, middle class, college-educated, heterosexual, or cisgender perspectives. These criticisms have led to the creation of ethnically specific or multicultural forms of feminism, such as black feminism and intersectional feminism.

== History ==

=== Terminology ===

Mary Wollstonecraft is seen by many as a founder of feminism due to her 1792 book titled &quot;A Vindication of the Rights of Woman&quot; in which she argues that class and private property are the basis of discrimination against women, and that women as much as men needed equal rights. Charles Fourier, a utopian socialist and French philosopher, is credited with having coined the word &quot;féminisme&quot; in 1837, but no trace of the word have been found in his works. The word &quot;féminisme&quot; (&quot;feminism&quot;) first appeared in France in 1871 in a medicine thesis about men suffering from tuberculosis and having developed, according to the author Ferdinand-Valère Faneau de la Cour, feminine traits. The word &quot;féministe&quot; (&quot;feminist&quot;), inspired by its medical use, was coined by Alexandre Dumas fils in a 1872 essay, referring to men who supported women rights. In both cases, the use of the word was very negative and reflected a criticism of a so-called &quot;confusion of the sexes&quot; by women who refused to abide by the sexual division of society and challenged the inequalities between sexes.

The concepts appeared in the Netherlands in 1872, Great Britain in the 1890s, and the United States in 1910. The &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; dates the first appearance in English in this meaning back to 1895. Depending on the historical moment, culture and country, feminists around the world have had different causes and goals. Most western feminist historians contend that all movements working to obtain women&#x27;s rights should be considered feminist movements, even when they did not (or do not) apply the term to themselves. Other historians assert that the term should be limited to the modern feminist movement and its descendants. Those historians use the label &quot;protofeminist&quot; to describe earlier movements.

=== Waves ===
The history of the modern western feminist movement is divided into multiple &quot;waves&quot;.

The first comprised women&#x27;s suffrage movements of the 19th and early-20th centuries, promoting women&#x27;s right to vote. The second wave, the women&#x27;s liberation movement, began in the 1960s and campaigned for legal and social equality for women. In or around 1992, a third wave was identified, characterized by a focus on individuality and diversity. Additionally, some have argued for the existence of a fourth wave, starting around 2012, which has used social media to combat sexual harassment, violence against women and rape culture; it is best known for the Me Too movement.

=== 19th and early 20th centuries ===

First-wave feminism was a period of activity during the 19th and early-20th centuries. In the UK and US, it focused on the promotion of equal contract, marriage, parenting, and property rights for women. New legislation included the Custody of Infants Act 1839 in the UK, which introduced the tender years doctrine for child custody and gave women the right of custody of their children for the first time. Other legislation, such as the Married Women&#x27;s Property Act 1870 in the UK and extended in the 1882 Act, became models for similar legislation in other British territories. Victoria passed legislation in 1884 and New South Wales in 1889; the remaining Australian colonies passed similar legislation between 1890 and 1897. With the turn of the 19th century, activism focused primarily on gaining political power, particularly the right of women&#x27;s suffrage, though some feminists were active in campaigning for women&#x27;s sexual, reproductive, and economic rights too.

Women&#x27;s suffrage (the right to vote and stand for parliamentary office) began in Britain&#x27;s Australasian colonies at the end of the 19th century, with the self-governing colony of New Zealand granting women the right to vote in 1893; South Australia followed suit with the Constitutional Amendment (Adult Suffrage) Act 1894 in 1894. This was followed by Australia granting female suffrage in 1902.

In Britain, the suffragettes and suffragists campaigned for the women&#x27;s vote, and in 1918 the Representation of the People Act was passed granting the vote to women over the age of 30 who owned property. In 1928, this was extended to all women over 21. Emmeline Pankhurst was the most notable activist in England. &quot;Time&quot; named her one of the 100 Most Important People of the 20th Century, stating: &quot;she shaped an idea of women for our time; she shook society into a new pattern from which there could be no going back.&quot; In the US, notable leaders of this movement included Lucretia Mott, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, and Susan B. Anthony, who each campaigned for the abolition of slavery before championing women&#x27;s right to vote. These women were influenced by the Quaker theology of spiritual equality, which asserts that men and women are equal under God. They were also influenced by earlier American feminist thought leaders Judith Sargent Murray, John Neal, Sarah Moore Grimké, and Margaret Fuller. In the US, first-wave feminism is considered to have ended with the passage of the Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution (1919), granting women the right to vote in all states. The term &quot;first wave&quot; was coined retroactively when the term &quot;second-wave feminism&quot; came into use.

In Germany, feminists like Clara Zetkin was very interested in women&#x27;s politics, including the fight for equal opportunities and women&#x27;s suffrage, through socialism. She helped to develop the social-democratic women&#x27;s movement in Germany. From 1891 to 1917, she edited the SPD women&#x27;s newspaper &quot;Die Gleichheit&quot; (Equality). In 1907 she became the leader of the newly founded &quot;Women&#x27;s Office&quot; at the SPD. She also contributed to International Women&#x27;s Day (IWD).

During the late Qing period and reform movements such as the Hundred Days&#x27; Reform, Chinese feminists called for women&#x27;s liberation from traditional roles and Neo-Confucian gender segregation. Later, the Chinese Communist Party created projects aimed at integrating women into the workforce, and claimed that the revolution had successfully achieved women&#x27;s liberation.

According to Nawar al-Hassan Golley, Arab feminism was closely connected with Arab nationalism. In 1899, Qasim Amin, considered the &quot;father&quot; of Arab feminism, wrote &quot;The Liberation of Women&quot;, which argued for legal and social reforms for women. He drew links between women&#x27;s position in Egyptian society and nationalism, leading to the development of Cairo University and the National Movement. In 1923 Hoda Shaarawi founded the Egyptian Feminist Union, became its president and a symbol of the Arab women&#x27;s rights movement.

The Iranian Constitutional Revolution in 1905 triggered the Iranian women&#x27;s movement, which aimed to achieve women&#x27;s equality in education, marriage, careers, and legal rights. However, during the Iranian revolution of 1979, many of the rights that women had gained from the women&#x27;s movement were systematically abolished, such as the Family Protection Law.

=== Mid-20th century ===

By the mid-20th century, women still lacked significant rights. In France, women obtained the right to vote only with the Provisional Government of the French Republic of 21 April 1944. The Consultative Assembly of Algiers of 1944 proposed on 24 March 1944 to grant eligibility to women but following an amendment by Fernard Grenier, they were given full citizenship, including the right to vote. Grenier&#x27;s proposition was adopted 51 to 16. In May 1947, following the November 1946 elections, the sociologist Robert Verdier minimized the &quot;gender gap&quot;, stating in &quot;Le Populaire&quot; that women had not voted in a consistent way, dividing themselves, as men, according to social classes. During the baby boom period, feminism waned in importance. Wars (both World War I and World War II) had seen the provisional emancipation of some women, but post-war periods signalled the return to conservative roles.

In Switzerland, women gained the right to vote in federal elections in 1971; but in the canton of Appenzell Innerrhoden women obtained the right to vote on local issues only in 1991, when the canton was forced to do so by the Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland. In Liechtenstein, women were given the right to vote by the women&#x27;s suffrage referendum of 1984. Three prior referendums held in 1968, 1971 and 1973 had failed to secure women&#x27;s right to vote.
Feminists continued to campaign for the reform of family laws which gave husbands control over their wives. Although by the 20th century coverture had been abolished in the UK and US, married women in many continental European countries still had very few rights. For instance, in France, married women did not receive the right to work without their husband&#x27;s permission until 1965. Feminists have also worked to abolish the &quot;marital exemption&quot; in rape laws which precluded the prosecution of husbands for the rape of their wives. Earlier efforts by first-wave feminists such as Voltairine de Cleyre, Victoria Woodhull and Elizabeth Clarke Wolstenholme-Elmy to criminalize marital rape in the late 19th century had failed; this was only achieved a century later in most Western countries, but is still not achieved in many other parts of the world.

French philosopher Simone de Beauvoir provided a Marxist solution and an existentialist view on many of the questions of feminism with the publication of &quot;The Second Sex&quot; in 1949. The book expressed feminists&#x27; sense of injustice. Second-wave feminism is a feminist movement beginning in the early 1960s and continuing to the present; as such, it coexists with third-wave feminism. Second-wave feminism is largely concerned with issues of equality beyond suffrage, such as ending gender discrimination. 

Second-wave feminists see women&#x27;s cultural and political inequalities as inextricably linked and encourage women to understand aspects of their personal lives as deeply politicized and as reflecting sexist power structures. The feminist activist and author Carol Hanisch coined the slogan &quot;The Personal is Political&quot;, which became synonymous with the second wave.

Second- and third-wave feminism in China has been characterized by a reexamination of women&#x27;s roles during the communist revolution and other reform movements, and new discussions about whether women&#x27;s equality has actually been fully achieved.

In 1956, President Gamal Abdel Nasser of Egypt initiated &quot;state feminism&quot;, which outlawed discrimination based on gender and granted women&#x27;s suffrage, but also blocked political activism by feminist leaders. During Sadat&#x27;s presidency, his wife, Jehan Sadat, publicly advocated further women&#x27;s rights, though Egyptian policy and society began to move away from women&#x27;s equality with the new Islamist movement and growing conservatism. However, some activists proposed a new feminist movement, Islamic feminism, which argues for women&#x27;s equality within an Islamic framework.

In Latin America, revolutions brought changes in women&#x27;s status in countries such as Nicaragua, where feminist ideology during the Sandinista Revolution aided women&#x27;s quality of life but fell short of achieving a social and ideological change.

In 1963, Betty Friedan&#x27;s book &quot;The Feminine Mystique&quot; helped voice the discontent that American women felt. The book is widely credited with sparking the beginning of second-wave feminism in the United States. Within ten years, women made up over half the First World workforce. In 1970, Australian writer Germaine Greer published &quot;The Female Eunuch&quot;, which became a worldwide bestseller, reportedly driving up divorce rates. Greer posits that men hate women, that women do not know this and direct the hatred upon themselves, as well as arguing that women are devitalised and repressed in their role as housewives and mothers.

=== Late 20th and early 21st centuries ===

==== Third-wave feminism ====
Third-wave feminism is traced to the emergence of the riot grrrl feminist punk subculture in Olympia, Washington, in the early 1990s, and to Anita Hill&#x27;s televised testimony in 1991—to an all-male, all-white Senate Judiciary Committee—that Clarence Thomas, nominated for the Supreme Court of the United States, had sexually harassed her. The term &quot;third wave&quot; is credited to Rebecca Walker, who responded to Thomas&#x27;s appointment to the Supreme Court with an article in &quot;Ms.&quot; magazine, &quot;Becoming the Third Wave&quot; (1992). She wrote:

Third-wave feminism also sought to challenge or avoid what it deemed the second wave&#x27;s essentialist definitions of femininity, which, third-wave feminists argued, overemphasized the experiences of upper middle-class white women. Third-wave feminists often focused on &quot;&quot; and challenged the second wave&#x27;s paradigm as to what was, or was not, good for women, and tended to use a post-structuralist interpretation of gender and sexuality. Feminist leaders rooted in the second wave, such as Gloria Anzaldúa, bell hooks, Chela Sandoval, Cherríe Moraga, Audre Lorde, Maxine Hong Kingston, and many other non-white feminists, sought to negotiate a space within feminist thought for consideration of race-related subjectivities. Third-wave feminism also contained internal debates between difference feminists, who believe that there are important psychological differences between the sexes, and those who believe that there are no inherent psychological differences between the sexes and contend that gender roles are due to social conditioning.

==== Standpoint theory ====

Standpoint theory is a feminist theoretical point of view stating that a person&#x27;s social position influences their knowledge. This perspective argues that research and theory treat women and the feminist movement as insignificant and refuses to see traditional science as unbiased. Since the 1980s, standpoint feminists have argued that the feminist movement should address global issues (such as rape, incest, and prostitution) and culturally specific issues (such as female genital mutilation in some parts of Africa and Arab societies, as well as glass ceiling practices that impede women&#x27;s advancement in developed economies) in order to understand how gender inequality interacts with racism, homophobia, classism and colonization in a &quot;matrix of domination&quot;.

==== Fourth-wave feminism ====

Fourth-wave feminism is a proposed extension of third-wave feminism which corresponds to a resurgence in interest in feminism beginning around 2012 and associated with the use of social media. According to feminist scholar Prudence Chamberlain, the focus of the fourth wave is justice for women and opposition to sexual harassment and violence against women. Its essence, she writes, is &quot;incredulity that certain attitudes can still exist&quot;.

Fourth-wave feminism is &quot;defined by technology&quot;, according to Kira Cochrane, and is characterized particularly by the use of Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, YouTube, Tumblr, and blogs such as Feministing to challenge misogyny and further gender equality.

Issues that fourth-wave feminists focus on include street and workplace harassment, campus sexual assault and rape culture. Scandals involving the harassment, abuse, and murder of women and girls have galvanized the movement. These have included the 2012 Delhi gang rape, 2012 Jimmy Savile allegations, the Bill Cosby allegations, 2014 Isla Vista killings, 2016 trial of Jian Ghomeshi, 2017 Harvey Weinstein allegations and subsequent Weinstein effect, and the 2017 Westminster sexual scandals.

Examples of fourth-wave feminist campaigns include the Everyday Sexism Project, No More Page 3, Stop Bild Sexism, &quot;Mattress Performance&quot;, &quot;10 Hours of Walking in NYC as a Woman&quot;, #YesAllWomen, Free the Nipple, One Billion Rising, the 2017 Women&#x27;s March, the 2018 Women&#x27;s March, and the #MeToo movement. In December 2017, &quot;Time&quot; magazine chose several prominent female activists involved in the #MeToo movement, dubbed &quot;the silence breakers&quot;, as Person of the Year.

=== Decolonial feminism ===
Decolonial feminism reformulates the coloniality of gender by critiquing the very formation of gender and its subsequent formations of patriarchy and the gender binary, not as universal constants across cultures, but as structures that have been instituted by and for the benefit of European colonialism. Marìa Lugones proposes that decolonial feminism speaks to how &quot;the colonial imposition of gender cuts across questions of ecology, economics, government, relations with the spirit world, and knowledge, as well as across everyday practices that either habituate us to take care of the world or to destroy it.&quot; Decolonial feminists like Karla Jessen Williamson and Rauna Kuokkanen have examined colonialism as a force that has imposed gender hierarchies on Indigenous women that have disempowered and fractured Indigenous communities and ways of life.

==== Postfeminism ====

The term postfeminism is used to describe a range of viewpoints reacting to feminism since the 1980s. While not being &quot;anti-feminist&quot;, postfeminists believe that women have achieved second wave goals while being critical of third- and fourth-wave feminist goals. The term was first used to describe a backlash against second-wave feminism, but it is now a label for a wide range of theories that take critical approaches to previous feminist discourses and includes challenges to the second wave&#x27;s ideas. Other postfeminists say that feminism is no longer relevant to today&#x27;s society. Amelia Jones has written that the postfeminist texts which emerged in the 1980s and 1990s portrayed second-wave feminism as a monolithic entity. Dorothy Chunn describes a &quot;blaming narrative&quot; under the postfeminist moniker, where feminists are undermined for continuing to make demands for gender equality in a &quot;post-feminist&quot; society, where &quot;gender equality has (already) been achieved&quot;. According to Chunn, &quot;many feminists have voiced disquiet about the ways in which rights and equality discourses are now used against them&quot;.

== Theory ==
Feminist theory is the extension of feminism into theoretical or philosophical fields. It encompasses work in a variety of disciplines, including anthropology, sociology, economics, women&#x27;s studies, literary criticism, art history, psychoanalysis, and philosophy. Feminist theory aims to understand gender inequality and focuses on gender politics, power relations, and sexuality. While providing a critique of these social and political relations, much of feminist theory also focuses on the promotion of women&#x27;s rights and interests. Themes explored in feminist theory include discrimination, stereotyping, objectification (especially sexual objectification), oppression, and patriarchy.
In the field of literary criticism, Elaine Showalter describes the development of feminist theory as having three phases. The first she calls &quot;feminist critique&quot;, in which the feminist reader examines the ideologies behind literary phenomena. The second Showalter calls &quot;gynocriticism&quot;, in which the &quot;woman is producer of textual meaning&quot;. The last phase she calls &quot;gender theory&quot;, in which the &quot;ideological inscription and the literary effects of the sex/gender system are explored&quot;.

This was paralleled in the 1970s by French feminists, who developed the concept of &quot;écriture féminine&quot; (which translates as &quot;female or feminine writing&quot;). Hélène Cixous argues that writing and philosophy are &quot;&quot; and along with other French feminists such as Luce Irigaray emphasize &quot;writing from the body&quot; as a subversive exercise. The work of Julia Kristeva, a feminist psychoanalyst and philosopher, and Bracha Ettinger, artist and psychoanalyst, has influenced feminist theory in general and feminist literary criticism in particular. However, as the scholar Elizabeth Wright points out, &quot;none of these French feminists align themselves with the feminist movement as it appeared in the Anglophone world&quot;.

== Movements and ideologies ==

Many overlapping feminist movements and ideologies have developed over the years. Feminism is often divided into three main traditions called liberal, radical and socialist/Marxist feminism, sometimes known as the &quot;Big Three&quot; schools of feminist thought. Since the late 20th century, newer forms of feminisms have also emerged. Some branches of feminism track the political leanings of the larger society to a greater or lesser degree, or focus on specific topics, such as the environment.

=== Liberal feminism ===
Liberal feminism, also known under other names such as reformist, mainstream, or historically as bourgeois feminism, arose from 19th-century first-wave feminism, and was historically linked to 19th-century liberalism and progressivism, while 19th-century conservatives tended to oppose feminism as such. Liberal feminism seeks equality of men and women through political and legal reform within a liberal democratic framework, without radically altering the structure of society; liberal feminism &quot;works within the structure of mainstream society to integrate women into that structure&quot;. During the 19th and early 20th centuries liberal feminism focused especially on women&#x27;s suffrage and access to education. Former Norwegian supreme court justice and former president of the liberal Norwegian Association for Women&#x27;s Rights, Karin Maria Bruzelius, has described liberal feminism as &quot;a realistic, sober, practical feminism&quot;.

Susan Wendell argues that &quot;liberal feminism is an historical tradition that grew out of liberalism, as can be seen very clearly in the work of such feminists as Mary Wollstonecraft and John Stuart Mill, but feminists who took principles from that tradition have developed analyses and goals that go far beyond those of 18th and 19th century liberal feminists, and many feminists who have goals and strategies identified as liberal feminist ... reject major components of liberalism&quot; in a modern or party-political sense; she highlights &quot;equality of opportunity&quot; as a defining feature of liberal feminism.

Liberal feminism is a very broad term that encompasses many, often diverging modern branches and a variety of feminist and general political perspectives; some historically liberal branches are equality feminism, social feminism, equity feminism, difference feminism, individualist/libertarian feminism and some forms of state feminism, particularly the state feminism of the Nordic countries. The broad field of liberal feminism is sometimes confused with the more recent and smaller branch known as libertarian feminism, which tends to diverge significantly from mainstream liberal feminism. For example, &quot;libertarian feminism does not require social measures to reduce material inequality; in fact, it opposes such measures ... in contrast, liberal feminism may support such requirements and egalitarian versions of feminism insist on them.&quot;

Catherine Rottenberg notes that the of classic liberal feminism was &quot;to pose an immanent critique of liberalism, revealing the gendered exclusions within liberal democracy&#x27;s proclamation of universal equality, particularly with respect to the law, institutional access, and the full incorporation of women into the public sphere.&quot; Rottenberg contrasts classic liberal feminism with modern neoliberal feminism which &quot;seems perfectly in sync with the evolving neoliberal order.&quot; According to Zhang and Rios, &quot;liberal feminism tends to be adopted by &#x27;mainstream&#x27; (i.e., middle-class) women who do not disagree with the current social structure.&quot; They found that liberal feminism with its focus on equality is viewed as the dominant and &quot;default&quot; form of feminism.

Some modern forms of feminism that historically grew out of the broader liberal tradition have more recently also been described as conservative in relative terms. This is particularly the case for libertarian feminism which conceives of people as self-owners and therefore as entitled to freedom from coercive interference.

=== Radical feminism ===
Radical feminism arose from the radical wing of second-wave feminism and calls for a radical reordering of society to eliminate male supremacy. It considers the male-controlled capitalist hierarchy as the defining feature of women&#x27;s oppression and the total uprooting and reconstruction of society as necessary. Separatist feminism does not support heterosexual relationships. Lesbian feminism is thus closely related. Other feminists criticize separatist feminism as sexist.

=== Materialist ideologies ===
Rosemary Hennessy and Chrys Ingraham say that materialist forms of feminism grew out of Western Marxist thought and have inspired a number of different (but overlapping) movements, all of which are involved in a critique of capitalism and are focused on ideology&#x27;s relationship to women. Marxist feminism argues that capitalism is the root cause of women&#x27;s oppression, and that discrimination against women in domestic life and employment is an effect of capitalist ideologies. Socialist feminism distinguishes itself from Marxist feminism by arguing that women&#x27;s liberation can only be achieved by working to end both the economic and cultural sources of women&#x27;s oppression. Anarcha-feminists believe that class struggle and anarchy against the state require struggling against patriarchy, which comes from involuntary hierarchy.

=== Other modern feminisms ===
==== Ecofeminism ====
Ecofeminists see men&#x27;s control of land as responsible for the oppression of women and destruction of the natural environment. Ecofeminism has been criticized for focusing too much on a mystical connection between women and nature.

==== Black and postcolonial ideologies ====
Sara Ahmed argues that Black and postcolonial feminisms pose a challenge &quot;to some of the organizing premises of Western feminist thought&quot;. During much of its history, feminist movements and theoretical developments were led predominantly by middle-class white women from Western Europe and North America. However, women of other races have proposed alternative feminisms. This trend accelerated in the 1960s with the civil rights movement in the United States and the end of Western European colonialism in Africa, the Caribbean, parts of Latin America, and Southeast Asia. Since that time, women in developing nations and former colonies and who are of colour or various ethnicities or living in poverty have proposed additional feminisms. Womanism emerged after early feminist movements were largely white and middle-class. Postcolonial feminists argue that colonial oppression and Western feminism marginalized postcolonial women but did not turn them passive or voiceless. Third-world feminism and indigenous feminism are closely related to postcolonial feminism. These ideas also correspond with ideas in African feminism, motherism, Stiwanism, negofeminism, femalism, transnational feminism, and Africana womanism.

==== Social constructionist ideologies ====

In the late 20th century various feminists began to argue that gender roles are socially constructed, and that it is impossible to generalize women&#x27;s experiences across cultures and histories. Post-structural feminism draws on the philosophies of post-structuralism and deconstruction in order to argue that the concept of gender is created socially and culturally through discourse. Postmodern feminists also emphasize the social construction of gender and the discursive nature of reality; however, as Pamela Abbott et al. write, a postmodern approach to feminism highlights &quot;the existence of multiple truths (rather than simply men and women&#x27;s standpoints)&quot;.

==== Transgender people ====
Third-wave feminists tend to view the struggle for trans rights as an integral part of intersectional feminism. Fourth-wave feminists also tend to be trans-inclusive. The American National Organization for Women (NOW) president Terry O&#x27;Neill said the struggle against transphobia is a feminist issue and NOW has affirmed that &quot;trans women are women, trans girls are girls.&quot; Several studies have found that people who identify as feminists tend to be more accepting of trans people than those who do not.

An ideology variously known as trans-exclusionary radical feminism (or its acronym, TERF) or gender-critical feminism is critical of concepts of gender identity and transgender rights, holding that biological sex characteristics are an immutable determination of gender or supersede the importance of gender identity, that trans women are not women, and that trans men are not men. These views have been described as transphobic by many other feminists.
==== Cultural movements ====

Riot grrrls took an anti-corporate stance of self-sufficiency and self-reliance. Riot grrrl&#x27;s emphasis on universal female identity and separatism often appears more closely allied with second-wave feminism than with the third wave. The movement encouraged and made &quot;adolescent girls&#x27; standpoints central&quot;, allowing them to express themselves fully. Lipstick feminism is a cultural feminist movement that attempts to respond to the backlash of second-wave radical feminism of the 1960s and 1970s by reclaiming symbols of &quot;feminine&quot; identity such as make-up, suggestive clothing and having a sexual allure as valid and empowering personal choices.

== Demographics ==

According to 2014 Ipsos poll covering 15 developed countries, 53 percent of respondents identified as feminists, and 87 percent agreed that &quot;women should be treated equally to men in all areas based on their competency, not their gender&quot;. However, only 55 percent of women agreed that they have &quot;full equality with men and the freedom to reach their full dreams and aspirations&quot;. Taken together, these studies reflect the importance differentiating between claiming a &quot;feminist identity&quot; and holding &quot;feminist attitudes or beliefs&quot;.

According to a 2015 poll, 18 percent of Americans use the label of &quot;feminist&quot; to describe themselves, while 85 percent are feminists in practice as they reported they believe in &quot;equality for women&quot;. The poll found that 52 percent did not identify as feminist, 26 percent were unsure, and 4 percent provided no response.

Sociological research shows that, in the US, increased educational attainment is associated with greater support for feminist issues. In addition, politically liberal people are more likely to support feminist ideals compared to those who are conservative.

According to a 2016 Survation poll for the Fawcett Society, 7 percent of Britons use the label of &quot;feminist&quot; to describe themselves, while 83 percent say they support equality of opportunity for women – this included higher support from men (86%) than women (81%).

== Sexuality ==

Feminist views on sexuality vary, and have differed by historical period and by cultural context. Feminist attitudes to female sexuality have taken a few different directions. Matters such as the sex industry, sexual representation in the media, and issues regarding consent to sex under conditions of male dominance have been particularly controversial among feminists. This debate has culminated in the late 1970s and the 1980s, in what came to be known as the feminist sex wars, which pitted anti-pornography feminism against sex-positive feminism, and parts of the feminist movement were deeply divided by these debates. Feminists have taken a variety of positions on different aspects of the sexual revolution from the 1960s and 70s. Over the course of the 1970s, a large number of influential women accepted lesbian and bisexual women as part of feminism.

=== Sex industry ===

Opinions on the sex industry are diverse. Feminists who are critical of the sex industry generally see it as the exploitative result of patriarchal social structures which reinforce sexual and cultural attitudes complicit in rape and sexual harassment. Alternately, feminists who support at least part of the sex industry argue that it can be a medium of feminist expression and reflect a woman&#x27;s right to control and define her own sexuality.

Individualist feminists support the existence of a sex industry on the grounds that adult women have the right to consent to sexual acts as they choose and should have access to labor rights, to earn money how they choose. In this view, banning the sex industry effectively strips women of their right to work and earn money on their own terms, treating them as children who cannot make decisions for themselves. In this view, women who consider the sex industry degrading do not have to partake in it. Women who do choose to work in the sex industry however should not be banned from doing so, given that they are doing so willingly. Libertarian Feminist Zine, Reclaim, has argued that sex work has helped more women (including students, freelancers, and women in poverty) achieve financial independence than all government grants combined.

Feminist views of pornography range from condemnation of pornography as a form of violence against women, to an embracing of some forms of pornography as a medium of feminist expression and a legitimate career. Similarly, feminists&#x27; views on prostitution vary, ranging from critical to supportive.

=== Affirming female sexual autonomy ===

For feminists, a woman&#x27;s right to control her own sexuality is a key issue and one that is heavily contested between different branches of feminism. Radical feminists such as Catharine MacKinnon argue that women have very little control over their own bodies, with female sexuality being largely controlled and defined by men in patriarchal societies. Radical feminists argue that sexual violence committed by men is often rooted in ideologies of male sexual entitlement and that these systems grant women very few legitimate options to refuse sexual advances. Some radical feminists have argued that women should not engage in heterosexual sex, and choose lesbianism as a lifestyle and political choice, a view that has fallen out of favor, as sexuality is seen as largely biologically influenced rather than a choice one can make for political reasons.

Some radical feminists argue that all cultures are, in one way or another, dominated by ideologies that deny women&#x27;s right to sexual expression, because men under a patriarchy define sex on their own terms. This entitlement can take different forms, depending on the culture. In some conservative and religious cultures marriage is regarded as an institution which requires a wife to be sexually available at all times, virtually without limit; thus, forcing or coercing sex on a wife is not considered a crime or even an abusive behaviour.

In 1968, radical feminist Anne Koedt argued in her essay &quot;The Myth of the Vaginal Orgasm&quot; that women&#x27;s biology and the clitoral orgasm had not been properly analyzed and popularized, because men &quot;have orgasms essentially by friction with the vagina&quot; and not the clitoral area.

Other branches of feminism such as individualist feminism consider themselves sex-positive, and see women&#x27;s expression of their own sexuality as a right. In this view, what is or is not &quot;degrading&quot; is subjective, and each person has a right to decide for themselves what sexual acts they find degrading and if they want to participate in them or not. Individualist feminist, Wendy McElroy wrote in her book, XXX: A Woman&#x27;s Right to Pornography, &quot;let&#x27;s examine [...] the idea that pornography is degrading to women. Degrading is a subjective term. Personally, I find detergent commercials in which women become orgasmic over soapsuds to be tremendously degrading to women. I find movies in which prostitutes are treated like ignorant drug addicts to be slander against women. Every woman has the right—the need!—to define degradation for herself.&quot;

According to this view, part of sexual autonomy is the right to define one&#x27;s boundaries, desires and limits around their sexuality rather than accept a narrative in which all women are victims of men during a sex act.

== Science ==
Sandra Harding says that the &quot;moral and political insights of the women&#x27;s movement have inspired social scientists and biologists to raise critical questions about the ways traditional researchers have explained gender, sex and relations within and between the social and natural worlds.&quot; Some feminists, such as Ruth Hubbard and Evelyn Fox Keller, criticize traditional scientific discourse as being historically biased towards a male perspective. A part of the feminist research agenda is the examination of the ways in which power inequities are created or reinforced in scientific and academic institutions. Physicist Lisa Randall, appointed to a task force at Harvard by then-president Lawrence Summers after his controversial discussion of why women may be underrepresented in science and engineering, said, &quot;I just want to see a whole bunch more women enter the field so these issues don&#x27;t have to come up anymore.&quot;

Lynn Hankinson Nelson writes that feminist empiricists find fundamental differences between the experiences of men and women. Thus, they seek to obtain knowledge through the examination of the experiences of women and to &quot;uncover the consequences of omitting, misdescribing, or devaluing them&quot; to account for a range of human experience. Another part of the feminist research agenda is the uncovering of ways in which power inequities are created or reinforced in society and in scientific and academic institutions. Furthermore, despite calls for greater attention to be paid to structures of gender inequity in the academic literature, structural analyses of gender bias rarely appear in highly cited psychological journals, especially in the commonly studied areas of psychology and personality.

One criticism of feminist epistemology is that it allows social and political values to influence its findings. Susan Haack also points out that feminist epistemology reinforces traditional stereotypes about women&#x27;s thinking (as intuitive and emotional, etc.); Meera Nanda further cautions that this may in fact trap women within &quot;traditional gender roles and help justify patriarchy&quot;.

=== Biology and gender ===

Modern feminism challenges the essentialist view of gender as biologically intrinsic. For example, Anne Fausto-Sterling&#x27;s book, &quot;Myths of Gender&quot;, explores the assumptions embodied in scientific research that support a biologically essentialist view of gender. In &quot;Delusions of Gender&quot;, Cordelia Fine disputes scientific evidence that suggests that there is an innate biological difference between men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s minds, asserting instead that cultural and societal beliefs are the reason for differences between individuals that are commonly perceived as sex differences.

=== Feminist psychology ===

Feminism in psychology emerged as a critique of the dominant male outlook on psychological research where only male perspectives were studied with all male subjects. As women earned doctorates in psychology, women and their issues were introduced as legitimate topics of study. Feminist psychology emphasizes social context, lived experience, and qualitative analysis. Projects such as Psychology&#x27;s Feminist Voices have emerged to catalogue the influence of feminist psychologists on the discipline.

== Culture ==
=== Design ===

There is a long history of feminist activity in design disciplines like industrial design, graphic design and fashion design. This work has explored topics like beauty, DIY, feminine approaches to design and community-based projects. Some iconic writing includes Cheryl Buckley&#x27;s essays on design and patriarchy and Joan Rothschild&#x27;s &quot;Design and Feminism: Re-Visioning Spaces, Places, and Everyday Things&quot;. More recently, Isabel Prochner&#x27;s research explored how feminist perspectives can support positive change in industrial design, helping to identify systemic social problems and inequities in design and guiding socially sustainable and grassroots design solutions.

=== Businesses ===

Feminist activists have established a range of feminist businesses, including feminist bookstores, credit unions, presses, mail-order catalogs and restaurants. These businesses flourished as part of the second and third waves of feminism in the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s.

=== Visual arts ===

Corresponding with general developments within feminism, and often including such self-organizing tactics as the consciousness-raising group, the movement began in the 1960s and flourished throughout the 1970s. Jeremy Strick, director of the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles, described the feminist art movement as &quot;the most influential international movement of any during the postwar period&quot;, and Peggy Phelan says that it &quot;brought about the most far-reaching transformations in both artmaking and art writing over the past four decades&quot;. Feminist artist Judy Chicago, who created &quot;The Dinner Party&quot;, a set of vulva-themed ceramic plates in the 1970s, said in 2009 to &quot;ARTnews&quot;, &quot;There is still an institutional lag and an insistence on a male Eurocentric narrative. We are trying to change the future: to get girls and boys to realize that women&#x27;s art is not an exception—it&#x27;s a normal part of art history.&quot; A feminist approach to the visual arts has most recently developed through cyberfeminism and the posthuman turn, giving voice to the ways &quot;contemporary female artists are dealing with gender, social media and the notion of embodiment&quot;.

=== Literature ===


The feminist movement produced feminist fiction, feminist non-fiction, and feminist poetry, which created new interest in women&#x27;s writing. It also prompted a general reevaluation of women&#x27;s historical and academic contributions in response to the belief that women&#x27;s lives and contributions have been underrepresented as areas of scholarly interest. There has also been a close link between feminist literature and activism, with feminist writing typically voicing key concerns or ideas of feminism in a particular era.

Much of the early period of feminist literary scholarship was given over to the rediscovery and reclamation of texts written by women. In Western feminist literary scholarship, Studies like Dale Spender&#x27;s &quot;Mothers of the Novel&quot; (1986) and Jane Spencer&#x27;s &quot;The Rise of the Woman Novelist&quot; (1986) were ground-breaking in their insistence that women have always been writing.

Commensurate with this growth in scholarly interest, various presses began the task of reissuing long-out-of-print texts. Virago Press began to publish its large list of 19th- and early-20th-century novels in 1975 and became one of the first commercial presses to join in the project of reclamation. In the 1980s, Pandora Press, responsible for publishing Spender&#x27;s study, issued a companion line of 18th-century novels written by women. More recently, Broadview Press continues to issue 18th- and 19th-century novels, many hitherto out of print, and the University of Kentucky has a series of republications of early women&#x27;s novels.

Particular works of literature have come to be known as key feminist texts. &quot;A Vindication of the Rights of Woman&quot; (1792) by Mary Wollstonecraft, is one of the earliest works of feminist philosophy. &quot;A Room of One&#x27;s Own&quot; (1929) by Virginia Woolf, is noted in its argument for both a literal and figural space for women writers within a literary tradition dominated by patriarchy.

The widespread interest in women&#x27;s writing is related to a general reassessment and expansion of the literary canon. Interest in post-colonial literatures, gay and lesbian literature, writing by people of colour, working people&#x27;s writing, and the cultural productions of other historically marginalized groups has resulted in a whole scale expansion of what is considered &quot;literature&quot;, and genres hitherto not regarded as &quot;literary&quot;, such as children&#x27;s writing, journals, letters, travel writing, and many others are now the subjects of scholarly interest. Most genres and subgenres have undergone a similar analysis, so literary studies have entered new territories such as the &quot;female gothic&quot; or women&#x27;s science fiction.

According to Elyce Rae Helford, &quot;Science fiction and fantasy serve as important vehicles for feminist thought, particularly as bridges between theory and practice.&quot; Feminist science fiction is sometimes taught at the university level to explore the role of social constructs in understanding gender. Notable texts of this kind are Ursula K. Le Guin&#x27;s &quot;The Left Hand of Darkness&quot; (1969), Joanna Russ&#x27; &quot;The Female Man&quot; (1970), Octavia Butler&#x27;s &quot;Kindred&quot; (1979) and Margaret Atwood&#x27;s &quot;Handmaid&#x27;s Tale&quot; (1985).
Feminist nonfiction has played an important role in voicing concerns about women&#x27;s lived experiences. For example, Maya Angelou&#x27;s &quot;I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings&quot; was extremely influential, as it represented the specific racism and sexism experienced by black women growing up in the United States.

In addition, many feminist movements have embraced poetry as a vehicle through which to communicate feminist ideas to public audiences through anthologies, poetry collections, and public readings.

Moreover, historical pieces of writing by women have been used by feminists to speak about what women&#x27;s lives were like in the past while demonstrating the power that they held and the impact they had in their communities. An important figure in the history of women&#x27;s literature is Hrotsvitha (–973), a canoness who was an early female poet in the German lands. As a historian, Hrotsvitha is one of the few writers to address women&#x27;s lives from a woman&#x27;s perspective during the Middle Ages. Hrotsvitha&#x27;s six short dramas are considered to be her magnum opus. She has been called &quot;the most remarkable woman of her time&quot; and an important figure in the history of women.

=== Music ===
Women&#x27;s music (or womyn&#x27;s music or wimmin&#x27;s music) is the music by women, for women, and about women. The genre emerged as a musical expression of the second-wave feminist movement as well as the labour, civil rights, and peace movements. The movement was started by lesbians such as Cris Williamson, Meg Christian, and Margie Adam, African-American women activists such as Bernice Johnson Reagon and her group Sweet Honey in the Rock, and peace activist Holly Near. Women&#x27;s music also refers to the wider industry of women&#x27;s music that goes beyond the performing artists to include studio musicians, producers, sound engineers, technicians, cover artists, distributors, promoters, and festival organizers who are also women.
Riot grrrl is an underground feminist hardcore punk movement described in the cultural movements section of this article.

Feminism became a principal concern of musicologists in the 1980s as part of the New Musicology. Prior to this, in the 1970s, musicologists were beginning to discover women composers and performers, and had begun to review concepts of canon, genius, genre and periodization from a feminist perspective. In other words, the question of how women musicians fit into traditional music history was now being asked. Through the 1980s and 1990s, this trend continued as musicologists like Susan McClary, Marcia Citron and Ruth Solie began to consider the cultural reasons for the marginalizing of women from the received body of work. Concepts such as music as gendered discourse; professionalism; reception of women&#x27;s music; examination of the sites of music production; relative wealth and education of women; popular music studies in relation to women&#x27;s identity; patriarchal ideas in music analysis; and notions of gender and difference are among the themes examined during this time.

While the music industry has long been open to having women in performance or entertainment roles, women are much less likely to have positions of authority, such as being the leader of an orchestra. In popular music, while there are many women singers recording songs, there are very few women behind the audio console acting as music producers, the individuals who direct and manage the recording process.

=== Cinema ===

Feminist cinema, advocating or illustrating feminist perspectives, arose largely with the development of feminist film theory in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Women who were radicalized during the 1960s by political debate and sexual liberation; but the failure of radicalism to produce substantive change for women galvanized them to form consciousness-raising groups and set about analysing, from different perspectives, dominant cinema&#x27;s construction of women. Differences were particularly marked between feminists on either side of the Atlantic. 1972 saw the first feminist film festivals in the U.S. and U.K. as well as the first feminist film journal, &quot;Women &amp; Film&quot;. Trailblazers from this period included Claire Johnston and Laura Mulvey, who also organized the Women&#x27;s Event at the Edinburgh Film Festival. Other theorists making a powerful impact on feminist film include Teresa de Lauretis, Anneke Smelik and Kaja Silverman. Approaches in philosophy and psychoanalysis fuelled feminist film criticism, feminist independent film and feminist distribution.

It has been argued that there are two distinct approaches to independent, theoretically inspired feminist filmmaking. &#x27;Deconstruction&#x27; concerns itself with analysing and breaking down codes of mainstream cinema, aiming to create a different relationship between the spectator and dominant cinema. The second approach, a feminist counterculture, embodies feminine writing to investigate a specifically feminine cinematic language. Bracha L. Ettinger invented a field of notions and concepts that serve the research of cinema from feminine perspective: The Matrixial Gaze. Ettinger&#x27;s language include original concepts to discover feminine perspectives. Many writers in the fields of film theory and contemporary art are using the Ettingerian matrixial sphere (matricial sphere).

During the 1930s–1950s heyday of the big Hollywood studios, the status of women in the industry was abysmal. Since then female directors such as Sally Potter, Catherine Breillat, Claire Denis and Jane Campion have made art movies, and directors like Kathryn Bigelow and Patty Jenkins have had mainstream success. This progress stagnated in the 1990s, and men outnumber women five to one in behind the camera roles.

== Politics ==

Feminism had complex interactions with the major political movements of the 20th century.

=== Socialism ===

Since the late 19th century, some feminists have allied with socialism, whereas others have criticized socialist ideology for being insufficiently concerned about women&#x27;s rights. August Bebel, an early activist of the German Social Democratic Party (SPD), published his work &quot;Die Frau und der Sozialismus&quot;, juxtaposing the struggle for equal rights between sexes with social equality in general. In 1907 there was an International Conference of Socialist Women in Stuttgart where suffrage was described as a tool of class struggle. Clara Zetkin of the SPD called for women&#x27;s suffrage to build a &quot;socialist order, the only one that allows for a radical solution to the women&#x27;s question&quot;.

In Britain, the women&#x27;s movement was allied with the Labour party. In the U.S., Betty Friedan emerged from a radical background to take leadership. Radical Women is the oldest socialist feminist organization in the U.S. and is still active. During the Spanish Civil War, Dolores Ibárruri (&quot;La Pasionaria&quot;) led the Communist Party of Spain. Although she supported equal rights for women, she opposed women fighting on the front and clashed with the anarcha-feminist Mujeres Libres.

Feminists in Ireland in the early 20th century included the revolutionary Irish Republican, suffragette and socialist Constance Markievicz who in 1918 was the first woman elected to the British House of Commons. However, in line with Sinn Féin abstentionist policy, she would not take her seat in the House of Commons. She was re-elected to the Second Dáil in the elections of 1921. She was also a commander of the Irish Citizens Army, which was led by the socialist and self-described feminist Irish leader James Connolly, during the 1916 Easter Rising.

=== Fascism ===
Fascism has been prescribed dubious stances on feminism by its practitioners and by women&#x27;s groups. Amongst other demands concerning social reform presented in the Fascist manifesto in 1919 was expanding the suffrage to all Italian citizens of age 18 and above, including women (accomplished only in 1946, after the defeat of fascism) and eligibility for all to stand for office from age 25. This demand was particularly championed by special Fascist women&#x27;s auxiliary groups such as the &quot;fasci femminilli&quot; and only partly realized in 1925, under pressure from dictator Benito Mussolini&#x27;s more conservative coalition partners.

Cyprian Blamires states that although feminists were among those who opposed the rise of Adolf Hitler, feminism has a complicated relationship with the Nazi movement as well. While Nazis glorified traditional notions of patriarchal society and its role for women, they claimed to recognize women&#x27;s equality in employment. However, Hitler and Mussolini declared themselves as opposed to feminism, and after the rise of Nazism in Germany in 1933, there was a rapid dissolution of the political rights and economic opportunities that feminists had fought for during the pre-war period and to some extent during the 1920s. Georges Duby et al. write that in practice fascist society was hierarchical and emphasized male virility, with women maintaining a largely subordinate position. Blamires also writes that neofascism has since the 1960s been hostile towards feminism and advocates that women accept &quot;their traditional roles&quot;.

=== Civil rights movement and anti-racism ===

The civil rights movement has influenced and informed the feminist movement and vice versa. Many American feminists adapted the language and theories of black equality activism and drew parallels between women&#x27;s rights and the rights of non-white people. Despite the connections between the women&#x27;s and civil rights movements, some tensions arose during the late 1960s and the 1970s as non-white women argued that feminism was predominantly white, straight, and middle class, and did not understand and was not concerned with issues of race and sexuality. Similarly, some women argued that the civil rights movement had sexist and homophobic elements and did not adequately address minority women&#x27;s concerns. These criticisms created new feminist social theories about identity politics and the intersections of racism, classism, and sexism; they also generated new feminisms such as black feminism and Chicana feminism in addition to making large contributions to lesbian feminism and other integrations of queer of colour identity.

=== Neoliberalism ===

Neoliberalism has been criticized by feminist theory for having a negative effect on the female workforce population across the globe, especially in the global south. Masculinist assumptions and objectives continue to dominate economic and geopolitical thinking. Women&#x27;s experiences in non-industrialized countries reveal often deleterious effects of modernization policies and undercut orthodox claims that development benefits everyone.

Proponents of neoliberalism have theorized that by increasing women&#x27;s participation in the workforce, there will be heightened economic progress, but feminist critics have stated that this participation alone does not further equality in gender relations. Neoliberalism has failed to address significant problems such as the devaluation of feminized labour, the structural privileging of men and masculinity, and the politicization of women&#x27;s subordination in the family and the workplace. The &quot;feminization of employment&quot; refers to a conceptual characterization of deteriorated and devalorized labour conditions that are less desirable, meaningful, safe and secure. Employers in the global south have perceptions about feminine labour and seek workers who are perceived to be undemanding, docile and willing to accept low wages. Social constructs about feminized labour have played a big part in this, for instance, employers often perpetuate ideas about women as &#x27;secondary income earners to justify their lower rates of pay and not deserving of training or promotion.

== Societal impact ==

The feminist movement has effected change in Western society, including women&#x27;s suffrage; greater access to education; more equal payment to men; the right to initiate divorce proceedings; the right of women to make individual decisions regarding pregnancy (including access to contraceptives and abortion); and the right to own property.

=== Civil rights ===
From the 1960s on, the campaign for women&#x27;s rights was met with mixed results in the U.S. and the U.K. Other countries of the EEC agreed to ensure that discriminatory laws would be phased out across the European Community.

Some feminist campaigning also helped reform attitudes to child sexual abuse. The view that young girls cause men to have sexual intercourse with them was replaced by that of men&#x27;s responsibility for their own conduct, the men being adults.

In the U.S., the National Organization for Women (NOW) began in 1966 to seek women&#x27;s equality, including through the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA), which did not pass, although some states enacted their own. Reproductive rights in the U.S. centred on the court decision in &quot;Roe&quot; v. &quot;Wade&quot; enunciating a woman&#x27;s right to choose whether to carry a pregnancy to term.

The division of labour within households was affected by the increased entry of women into workplaces in the 20th century. Sociologist Arlie Russell Hochschild found that, in two-career couples, men and women, on average, spend about equal amounts of time working, but women still spend more time on housework, although Cathy Young responded by arguing that women may prevent equal participation by men in housework and parenting. Judith K. Brown writes, &quot;Women are most likely to make a substantial contribution when subsistence activities have the following characteristics: the participant is not obliged to be far from home; the tasks are relatively monotonous and do not require rapt concentration and the work is not dangerous, can be performed in spite of interruptions, and is easily resumed once interrupted.&quot;

In international law, the &quot;Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women&quot; (CEDAW) is an international convention adopted by the United Nations General Assembly and described as an international bill of rights for women. It came into force in those nations ratifying it.

=== Jurisprudence ===
Feminist jurisprudence is a branch of jurisprudence that examines the relationship between women and law. It addresses questions about the history of legal and social biases against women and about the enhancement of their legal rights.

Feminist jurisprudence signifies a reaction to the philosophical approach of modern legal scholars, who typically see the law as a process for interpreting and perpetuating a society&#x27;s universal, gender-neutral ideals. Feminist legal scholars claim that this fails to acknowledge women&#x27;s values or legal interests or the harms that they may anticipate or experience.

=== Language ===

Proponents of gender-neutral language argue that the use of gender-specific language often implies male superiority or reflects an unequal state of society. According to &quot;The Handbook of English Linguistics&quot;, generic masculine pronouns and gender-specific job titles are instances &quot;where English linguistic convention has historically treated men as prototypical of the human species.&quot;

Merriam-Webster chose &quot;feminism&quot; as its 2017 Word of the Year, noting that &quot;Word of the Year is a quantitative measure of interest in a particular word.&quot;

=== Theology ===
Feminist theology is a movement that reconsiders the traditions, practices, scriptures, and theologies of religions from a feminist perspective. Some of the goals of feminist theology include increasing the role of women among the clergy and religious authorities, reinterpreting male-dominated imagery and language about God, determining women&#x27;s place in relation to career and motherhood, and studying images of women in the religion&#x27;s sacred texts.

Christian feminism is a branch of feminist theology which seeks to interpret and understand Christianity in light of the equality of women and men, and that this interpretation is necessary for a complete understanding of Christianity. While there is no standard set of beliefs among Christian feminists, most agree that God does not discriminate on the basis of sex, and are involved in issues such as the ordination of women, male dominance and the balance of parenting in Christian marriage, claims of moral deficiency and inferiority of women compared to men, and the overall treatment of women in the church.

Islamic feminists advocate women&#x27;s rights, gender equality, and social justice grounded within an Islamic framework. Advocates seek to highlight the deeply rooted teachings of equality in the Quran and encourage a questioning of the patriarchal interpretation of Islamic teaching through the Quran, &quot;hadith&quot; (sayings of Muhammad), and &quot;sharia&quot; (law) towards the creation of a more equal and just society. Although rooted in Islam, the movement&#x27;s pioneers have also used secular and Western feminist discourses and recognize the role of Islamic feminism as part of an integrated global feminist movement.

Buddhist feminism is a movement that seeks to improve the religious, legal, and social status of women within Buddhism. It is an aspect of feminist theology which seeks to advance and understand the equality of men and women morally, socially, spiritually, and in leadership from a Buddhist perspective. The Buddhist feminist Rita Gross describes Buddhist feminism as &quot;the radical practice of the co-humanity of women and men&quot;.

Jewish feminism is a movement that seeks to improve the religious, legal, and social status of women within Judaism and to open up new opportunities for religious experience and leadership for Jewish women. The main issues for early Jewish feminists in these movements were the exclusion from the all-male prayer group or &quot;minyan&quot;, the exemption from positive time-bound &quot;mitzvot&quot;, and women&#x27;s inability to function as witnesses and to initiate divorce. Many Jewish women have become leaders of feminist movements throughout their history.

Dianic Wicca is a feminist-centred thealogy.

Secular or atheist feminists have engaged in feminist criticism of religion, arguing that many religions have oppressive rules towards women and misogynistic themes and elements in religious texts.

=== Patriarchy ===
Patriarchy is a social system in which society is organized around male authority figures. In this system, fathers have authority over women, children, and property. It implies the institutions of male rule and privilege and is dependent on female subordination. Most forms of feminism characterize patriarchy as an unjust social system that is oppressive to women. Carole Pateman argues that the patriarchal distinction &quot;between masculinity and femininity is the political difference between freedom and subjection.&quot; In feminist theory the concept of patriarchy often includes all the social mechanisms that reproduce and exert male dominance over women. Feminist theory typically characterizes patriarchy as a social construction, which can be overcome by revealing and critically analyzing its manifestations. Some radical feminists have proposed that because patriarchy is too deeply rooted in society, separatism is the only viable solution. Other feminists have criticized these views as being anti-men.

=== Men and masculinity ===

Feminist theory has explored the social construction of masculinity and its implications for the goal of gender equality. The social construct of masculinity is seen by feminism as problematic because it associates males with aggression and competition, and reinforces patriarchal and unequal gender relations. Patriarchal cultures are criticized for &quot;limiting forms of masculinity&quot; available to men and thus narrowing their life choices. Some feminists are engaged with men&#x27;s issues activism, such as bringing attention to male rape and spousal battery and addressing negative social expectations for men.

Male participation in feminism is generally encouraged by feminists and is seen as an important strategy for achieving full societal commitment to gender equality. Many male feminists and pro-feminists are active in both women&#x27;s rights activism, feminist theory, and masculinity studies. However, some argue that while male engagement with feminism is necessary, it is problematic because of the ingrained social influences of patriarchy in gender relations. The consensus today in feminist and masculinity theories is that men and women should cooperate to achieve the larger goals of feminism.

== Reactions ==

Different groups of people have responded to feminism, and both men and women have been among its supporters and critics. Among American university students, for both men and women, support for feminist ideas is more common than self-identification as a feminist. The US media tends to portray feminism negatively and feminists &quot;are less often associated with day-to-day work/leisure activities of regular women&quot;. However, as recent research has demonstrated, as people are exposed to self-identified feminists and to discussions relating to various forms of feminism, their own self-identification with feminism increases.

=== Pro-feminism ===

Pro-feminism is the support of feminism without implying that the supporter is a member of the feminist movement. The term is most often used in reference to men who are actively supportive of feminism. The activities of pro-feminist men&#x27;s groups include anti-violence work with boys and young men in schools, offering sexual harassment workshops in workplaces, running community education campaigns, and counselling male perpetrators of violence. Pro-feminist men also may be involved in men&#x27;s health, activism against pornography including anti-pornography legislation, men&#x27;s studies, and the development of gender equity curricula in schools. This work is sometimes in collaboration with feminists and women&#x27;s services, such as domestic violence and rape crisis centres.

=== Anti-feminism and criticism of feminism ===

Anti-feminism is opposition to feminism in some or all of its forms.

In the 19th century, anti-feminism was mainly focused on opposition to women&#x27;s suffrage. Later, opponents of women&#x27;s entry into institutions of higher learning argued that education was too great a physical burden on women. Other anti-feminists opposed women&#x27;s entry into the labour force, or their right to join unions, to sit on juries, or to obtain birth control and control of their sexuality.

Some people have opposed feminism on the grounds that they believe it is contrary to traditional values or religious beliefs. Some anti-feminists argue, for example, that social acceptance of divorce and non-married women is wrong and harmful, and that men and women are fundamentally different and thus their different traditional roles in society should be maintained. Other anti-feminists oppose women&#x27;s entry into the workforce, political office, and the voting process, as well as the lessening of male authority in families.

Writers such as Camille Paglia, Christina Hoff Sommers, Jean Bethke Elshtain, Elizabeth Fox-Genovese, and Daphne Patai oppose some forms of feminism, though they identify as feminists. They argue, for example, that feminism often promotes misandry and the elevation of women&#x27;s interests above men&#x27;s, and criticize radical feminist positions as harmful to both men and women. Daphne Patai and Noretta Koertge argue that the term &quot;anti-feminist&quot; is used to silence academic debate about feminism. A meta-analysis in 2023 published in the journal &quot;Psychology of Women Quarterly&quot; investigated the stereotype of feminists&#x27; attitudes to men and concluded that feminist views of men were no different to that of non-feminists or men towards men and titled the phenomenon the misandry myth, based on &quot;evidence that it is false and widespread&quot;.

=== Secular humanism ===

Secular humanism is an ethical framework that attempts to dispense with any unreasoned dogma, pseudoscience, and superstition. Critics of feminism sometimes ask &quot;Why feminism and not humanism?&quot;. Some humanists argue, however, that the goals of feminists and humanists largely overlap, and the distinction is only in motivation. For example, a humanist may consider abortion in terms of a utilitarian ethical framework, rather than considering the motivation of any particular woman in getting an abortion. In this respect, it is possible to be a humanist without being a feminist, but this does not preclude the existence of feminist humanism. Humanism played a significant role in protofeminism during the Renaissance period in such that humanists made educated women popular figures despite the challenge of the patriarchal organization of society.

<text>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is a U.S. federal government agency within the U.S. Department of Transportation that regulates civil aviation in the United States and surrounding international waters. Its powers include air traffic control, certification of personnel and aircraft, setting standards for airports, and protection of U.S. assets during the launch or re-entry of commercial space vehicles. Powers over neighboring international waters were delegated to the FAA by authority of the International Civil Aviation Organization.

The FAA was created in as the Federal Aviation Agency, replacing the Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA). In 1967, the FAA became part of the newly formed U.S. Department of Transportation and was renamed the Federal Aviation Administration.

==Major functions==
The FAA&#x27;s roles include:
*Regulating U.S. commercial space transportation
*Regulating air navigation facilities&#x27; geometric and flight inspection standards
*Encouraging and developing civil aeronautics, including new aviation technology
*Issuing, suspending, or revoking pilot certificates
*Regulating civil aviation to promote transportation safety in the United States, especially through local offices called Flight Standards District Offices
*Developing and operating a system of air traffic control and navigation for both civil and military aircraft
*Researching and developing the National Airspace System and civil aeronautics
*Developing and carrying out programs to control aircraft noise and other environmental effects of civil aviation

==Organizations==
The FAA operates five &quot;lines of business&quot;. Their functions are:

*Air Traffic Organization (ATO): provides air navigation service within the National Airspace System. In ATO, employees operate air traffic control facilities comprising Airport Traffic Control Towers (ATCT), Terminal Radar Approach Control Facilities (TRACONs), and Air Route Traffic Control Centers (ARTCC). 
*Aviation Safety (AVS): responsible for aeronautical certification of personnel and aircraft, including pilots, airlines, and mechanics.
*Airports (ARP): plans and develops the national airport system; oversees standards for airport safety, inspection, design, construction, and operation. The office awards $3.5 billion annually in grants for airport planning and development.
*Office of Commercial Space Transportation (AST): ensures protection of U.S. assets during the launch or reentry of commercial space vehicles.
*Security and Hazardous Materials Safety (ASH): responsible for risk reduction of terrorism and other crimes and for investigations, materials safety, infrastructure protection, and personnel security.

==Regions and Aeronautical Center operations==

The FAA is headquartered in Washington, D.C., and also operates the William J. Hughes Technical Center near Atlantic City, New Jersey, for support and research, and the Mike Monroney Aeronautical Center in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, for training. The FAA has nine regional administrative offices:
*Alaskan Region – Anchorage, Alaska
*Northwest Mountain – Seattle, Washington
*Western Pacific – Los Angeles, California
*Southwest – Fort Worth, Texas
*Central – Kansas City, Missouri
*Great Lakes – Chicago, Illinois
*Southern – Atlanta, Georgia
*Eastern – New York, New York
*New England – Boston, Massachusetts

==History==
=== Background ===
The Air Commerce Act of May 20, 1926, is the cornerstone of the U.S. federal government&#x27;s regulation of civil aviation. This landmark legislation was passed at the urging of the aviation industry, whose leaders believed the airplane could not reach its full commercial potential without federal action to improve and maintain safety standards. The Act charged the Secretary of Commerce with fostering air commerce, issuing and enforcing air traffic rules, licensing pilots, certifying aircraft, establishing airways, and operating and maintaining aids to air navigation. The newly created Aeronautics Branch, operating under the Department of Commerce assumed primary responsibility for aviation oversight.

In fulfilling its civil aviation responsibilities, the U.S. Department of Commerce initially concentrated on such functions as safety regulations and the certification of pilots and aircraft. It took over the building and operation of the nation&#x27;s system of lighted airways, a task initiated by the Post Office Department. The Department of Commerce improved aeronautical radio communications—before the founding of the Federal Communications Commission in 1934, which handles most such matters today—and introduced radio beacons as an effective aid to air navigation.

The Aeronautics Branch was renamed the Bureau of Air Commerce in 1934 to reflect its enhanced status within the Department. As commercial flying increased, the Bureau encouraged a group of airlines to establish the first three centers for providing air traffic control (ATC) along the airways. In 1936, the Bureau itself took over the centers and began to expand the ATC system. The pioneer air traffic controllers used maps, blackboards, and mental calculations to ensure the safe separation of aircraft traveling along designated routes between cities.

In 1938, the Civil Aeronautics Act transferred the federal civil aviation responsibilities from the Commerce Department to a new independent agency, the Civil Aeronautics Authority. The legislation also expanded the government&#x27;s role by giving the CAA the authority and the power to regulate airline fares and to determine the routes that air carriers would serve.

President Franklin D. Roosevelt split the authority into two agencies in 1940: the Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA) and the Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB). CAA was responsible for ATC, airman and aircraft certification, safety enforcement, and airway development. CAB was entrusted with safety regulation, accident investigation, and economic regulation of the airlines. The CAA was part of the Department of Commerce. The CAB was an independent federal agency.

On the eve of America&#x27;s entry into World War II, CAA began to extend its ATC responsibilities to takeoff and landing operations at airports. This expanded role eventually became permanent after the war. The application of radar to ATC helped controllers in their drive to keep abreast of the postwar boom in commercial air transportation. In 1946, meanwhile, Congress gave CAA the added task of administering the federal-aid airport program, the first peacetime program of financial assistance aimed exclusively at development of the nation&#x27;s civil airports.

=== Formation ===
The approaching era of jet travel (and a series of midair collisions—most notably the 1956 Grand Canyon mid-air collision) prompted passage of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958. This legislation passed the CAA&#x27;s functions to a new independent body, the Federal Aviation Agency. The act also transferred air safety regulation from the CAB to the FAA, and gave it sole responsibility for a joint civil-military system of air navigation and air traffic control. The FAA&#x27;s first administrator, Elwood R. Quesada, was a former Air Force general and adviser to President Eisenhower.

The same year witnessed the birth of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), which was created in response to the Soviet Union (USSR) launch of the first manmade satellite. NASA assumed NACA&#x27;s aeronautical research role.

=== 1960s reorganization ===

In 1967, a new U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) combined major federal responsibilities for air and surface transport. The Federal Aviation Agency&#x27;s name changed to the Federal Aviation Administration as it became one of several agencies (e.g., Federal Highway Administration, Federal Railroad Administration, the Coast Guard, and the Saint Lawrence Seaway Commission) within DOT. The FAA administrator no longer reported directly to the president, but instead to the Secretary of Transportation. New programs and budget requests would have to be approved by DOT, which would then include these requests in the overall budget and submit it to the president.

At the same time, a new National Transportation Safety Board took over the Civil Aeronautics Board&#x27;s (CAB) role of investigating and determining the causes of transportation accidents and making recommendations to the secretary of transportation. CAB was merged into DOT with its responsibilities limited to the regulation of commercial airline routes and fares.

The FAA gradually assumed additional functions. The hijacking epidemic of the 1960s had already brought the agency into the field of civil aviation security. In response to the hijackings on September 11, 2001, this responsibility is now primarily taken by the Department of Homeland Security. The FAA became more involved with the environmental aspects of aviation in 1968 when it received the power to set aircraft noise standards. Legislation in 1970 gave the agency management of a new airport aid program and certain added responsibilities for airport safety. During the 1960s and 1970s, the FAA also started to regulate high altitude (over 500 feet) kite and balloon flying.
=== 1970s and deregulation ===
By the mid-1970s, the agency had achieved a semi-automated air traffic control system using both radar and computer technology. This system required enhancement to keep pace with air traffic growth, however, especially after the Airline Deregulation Act of 1978 phased out the CAB&#x27;s economic regulation of the airlines. A nationwide strike by the air traffic controllers union in 1981 forced temporary flight restrictions but failed to shut down the airspace system. During the following year, the agency unveiled a new plan for further automating its air traffic control facilities, but progress proved disappointing. In 1994, the FAA shifted to a more step-by-step approach that has provided controllers with advanced equipment.

In 1979, Congress authorized the FAA to work with major commercial airports to define noise pollution contours and investigate the feasibility of noise mitigation by residential retrofit programs. Throughout the 1980s, these charters were implemented.

In the 1990s, satellite technology received increased emphasis in the FAA&#x27;s development programs as a means to improvements in communications, navigation, and airspace management. In 1995, the agency assumed responsibility for safety oversight of commercial space transportation, a function begun eleven years before by an office within DOT headquarters. The agency was responsible for the decision to ground flights after the September 11 attacks.

===21st century===
In December 2000, an organization within the FAA called the Air Traffic Organization, (ATO) was set up by presidential executive order. This became the air navigation service provider for the airspace of the United States and for the New York (Atlantic) and Oakland (Pacific) oceanic areas. It is a full member of the Civil Air Navigation Services Organisation.

The FAA issues a number of awards to holders of its certificates. Among these are demonstrated proficiencies as an aviation mechanic (the AMT Awards), a flight instructor (Gold Seal certification), a 50-year aviator (Wright Brothers Master Pilot Award), a 50-year mechanic (Charles Taylor Master Mechanic Award) or as a proficient pilot. The latter, the FAA &quot;WINGS Program&quot;, provides a lifetime series of grouped proficiency activities at three levels (Basic, Advanced, and Master) for pilots who have undergone several hours of ground and flight training since their last WINGS award, or &quot;Phase&quot;. The FAA encourages volunteerism in the promotion of aviation safety. The FAA Safety Team, or FAASTeam, works with Volunteers at several levels and promotes safety education and outreach nationwide.

On March 18, 2008, the FAA ordered its inspectors to reconfirm that airlines are complying with federal rules after revelations that Southwest Airlines flew dozens of aircraft without certain mandatory inspections. The FAA exercises surprise Red Team drills on national airports annually.

On October 31, 2013, after outcry from media outlets, including heavy criticism from Nick Bilton of &quot;The New York Times&quot;, the FAA announced it will allow airlines to expand the passengers use of portable electronic devices during all phases of flight, but mobile phone calls would still be prohibited (and use of cellular networks during any point when aircraft doors are closed remains prohibited to-date). Implementation initially varied among airlines. The FAA expected many carriers to show that their planes allow passengers to safely use their devices in airplane mode, gate-to-gate, by the end of 2013. Devices must be held or put in the seat-back pocket during the actual takeoff and landing. Mobile phones must be in airplane mode or with mobile service disabled, with no signal bars displayed, and cannot be used for voice communications due to Federal Communications Commission regulations that prohibit any airborne calls using mobile phones. From a technological standpoint, cellular service would not work in-flight because of the rapid speed of the airborne aircraft: mobile phones cannot switch fast enough between cellular towers at an aircraft&#x27;s high speed. However, the ban is due to potential radio interference with aircraft avionics. If an air carrier provides Wi-Fi service during flight, passengers may use it. Short-range Bluetooth accessories, like wireless keyboards, can also be used.

In July 2014, in the wake of the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17, the FAA suspended flights by U.S. airlines to Ben Gurion Airport during the 2014 Israel–Gaza conflict for 24 hours. The ban was extended for a further 24 hours but was lifted about six hours later.

The FAA Reauthorization Act of 2018 gives the FAA one year to establish minimum pitch, width and length for airplane seats, to ensure they are safe for passengers.

As of 2018,
the FAA plans to replace the &quot;FAA Telecommunications Infrastructure&quot; (FTI) program with the &quot;FAA Enterprise Network Services&quot; (FENS) program.

The first FAA licensed orbital human space flight took place on November 15, 2020, carried out by SpaceX on behalf of NASA.

=== History of FAA Administrators ===

The administrator is appointed for a five-year term.

On March 19, 2019, President Donald Trump announced he would nominate Stephen Dickson, a former executive and pilot at Delta Air Lines, to be the next FAA Administrator. On July 24, 2019, the Senate confirmed Dickson by a vote of 52–40. He was sworn in as Administrator by Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao on August 12, 2019. On February 16, 2022, Dickson announced his resignation as FAA Administrator, effective March 31, 2022. In September 2023, President Joe Biden announced that he would be nominating Mike Whitaker to lead the FAA. Whitaker previously served as deputy administrator of the FAA under President Barack Obama.

==Criticism==
===Conflicting roles===
The FAA has been cited as an example of regulatory capture, &quot;in which the airline industry openly dictates to its regulators its governing rules, arranging for not only beneficial regulation, but placing key people to head these regulators.&quot; Retired NASA Office of Inspector General Senior Special Agent Joseph Gutheinz, who used to be a Special Agent with the Office of Inspector General for the Department of Transportation and with FAA Security, is one of the most outspoken critics of FAA. Rather than commend the agency for proposing a $10.2 million fine against Southwest Airlines for its failure to conduct mandatory inspections in 2008, he was quoted as saying the following in an Associated Press story: &quot;Penalties against airlines that violate FAA directives should be stiffer. At $25,000 per violation, Gutheinz said, airlines can justify rolling the dice and taking the chance on getting caught. He also said the FAA is often too quick to bend to pressure from airlines and pilots.&quot; Other experts have been critical of the constraints and expectations under which the FAA is expected to operate. The dual role of encouraging aerospace travel and regulating aerospace travel are contradictory. For example, to levy a heavy penalty upon an airline for violating an FAA regulation which would impact their ability to continue operating would not be considered encouraging aerospace travel.

On July 22, 2008, in the aftermath of the Southwest Airlines inspection scandal, a bill was unanimously approved in the House to tighten regulations concerning airplane maintenance procedures, including the establishment of a whistleblower office and a two-year &quot;cooling off&quot; period that FAA inspectors or supervisors of inspectors must wait before they can work for those they regulated. The bill also required rotation of principal maintenance inspectors and stipulated that the word &quot;customer&quot; properly applies to the flying public, not those entities regulated by the FAA. The bill died in a Senate committee that year.

In September 2009, the FAA administrator issued a directive mandating that the agency use the term &quot;customers&quot; to refer to only the flying public.

===Lax regulatory oversight===
In 2007, two FAA whistleblowers, inspectors Charalambe &quot;Bobby&quot; Boutris and Douglas E. Peters, alleged that Boutris said he attempted to ground Southwest after finding cracks in the fuselage of an aircraft, but was prevented by supervisors he said were friendly with the airline. This was validated by a report by the Department of Transportation which found FAA managers had allowed Southwest Airlines to fly 46 airplanes in 2006 and 2007 that were overdue for safety inspections, ignoring concerns raised by inspectors. Audits of other airlines resulted in two airlines grounding hundreds of planes, causing thousands of flight cancellations. The House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee held hearings in April 2008. Jim Oberstar, former chairman of the committee, said its investigation uncovered a pattern of regulatory abuse and widespread regulatory lapses, allowing 117 aircraft to be operated commercially although not in compliance with FAA safety rules. Oberstar said there was a &quot;culture of coziness&quot; between senior FAA officials and the airlines and &quot;a systematic breakdown&quot; in the FAA&#x27;s culture that resulted in &quot;malfeasance, bordering on corruption&quot;. In 2008 the FAA proposed to fine Southwest $10.2 million for failing to inspect older planes for cracks,&lt;ref name=&quot;ap-mailtrib/msnbc&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2009 Southwest and the FAA agreed that Southwest would pay a $7.5 million penalty and would adopt new safety procedures, with the fine doubling if Southwest failed to follow through.

===Changes to air traffic controller application process===

In 2014, the FAA modified its approach to air traffic control hiring. It launched more &quot;off the street bids&quot;, allowing anyone with either a four-year degree or five years of full-time work experience to apply, rather than the closed college program or Veterans Recruitment Appointment bids, something that had last been done in 2008. Thousands were hired, including veterans, Collegiate Training Initiative graduates, and people who are true &quot;off the street&quot; hires. The move was made to open the job up to more people who might make good controllers but did not go to a college that offered a CTI program. Before the change, candidates who had completed coursework at participating colleges and universities could be &quot;fast-tracked&quot; for consideration. However, the CTI program had no guarantee of a job offer, nor was the goal of the program to teach people to work actual traffic. The goal of the program was to prepare people for the FAA Academy in Oklahoma City, OK. Having a CTI certificate allowed a prospective controller to skip the Air Traffic Basics part of the academy, about a 30- to 45-day course, and go right into Initial Qualification Training (IQT). All prospective controllers, CTI or not, have had to pass the FAA Academy in order to be hired as a controller. Failure at the academy means FAA employment is terminated. In January 2015 they launched another pipeline, a &quot;prior experience&quot; bid, where anyone with an FAA Control Tower Operator certificate (CTO) and 52 weeks of experience could apply. This was a revolving bid, every month the applicants on this bid were sorted out, and eligible applicants were hired and sent directly to facilities, bypassing the FAA academy entirely.

In the process of promoting diversity, the FAA revised its hiring process. The FAA later issued a report that the &quot;bio-data&quot; was not a reliable test for future performance. However, the &quot;Bio-Q&quot; was not the determining factor for hiring, it was merely a screening tool to determine who would take a revised Air Traffic Standardized Aptitude Test (ATSAT). Due to cost and time, it was not practical to give all 30,000 some applicants the revised ATSAT, which has since been validated. In 2015 Fox News levied criticism that the FAA discriminated against qualified candidates.

In December 2015, a reverse discrimination lawsuit was filed against the FAA seeking class-action status for the thousands of men and women who spent up to $40,000 getting trained under FAA rules before they were abruptly changed. The prospects of the lawsuit are unknown, as the FAA is a self-governing entity and therefore can alter and experiment with its hiring practices, and there was never any guarantee of a job in the CTI program.

=== Close Calls ===

In August 2023 &quot;The New York Times&quot; published an investigative report that showed overworked air traffic controllers at understaffed facilities making errors that resulted in 46 near collisions in the air and on the ground in the month of July alone.

===Next Generation Air Transportation System===
A May 2017 letter from staff of the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure to members of the same committee sent before a meeting to discuss air traffic control privatization noted a 35-year legacy of failed air traffic control modernization management, including NextGen. The letter said the FAA initially described NextGen as fundamentally transforming how air traffic would be managed. In 2015, however, the National Research Council noted that NextGen, as currently executed, was not broadly transformational and that it is a set of programs to implement a suite of incremental changes to the National Airspace System (NAS).

More precise Performance Based Navigation can reduce fuel burn, emissions, and noise exposure for a majority of communities, but the concentration of flight tracks also can increase noise exposure for people who live directly under those flight paths. A feature of the NextGen program is GPS-based waypoints, which result in consolidated flight paths for planes. The result of this change is that many localities experience huge increases in air traffic over previously quiet areas. Complaints have risen with the added traffic and multiple municipalities have filed suit.

===Boeing 737 MAX controversy===

As a result of the March 10, 2019 Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 crash and the Lion Air Flight 610 crash five months earlier, most airlines and countries began grounding the Boeing 737 MAX 8 (and in many cases all MAX variants) due to safety concerns, but the FAA declined to ground MAX 8 aircraft operating in the U.S. On March 12, the FAA said that its ongoing review showed &quot;no systemic performance issues and provides no basis to order grounding the aircraft.&quot; Some U.S. Senators called for the FAA to ground the aircraft until an investigation into the cause of the Ethiopian Airlines crash was complete. U.S. Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao said that &quot;If the FAA identifies an issue that affects safety, the department will take immediate and appropriate action.&quot; The FAA resisted grounding the aircraft until March 13, 2019, when it received evidence of similarities in the two accidents. By then, 51 other regulators had already grounded the plane, and by March 18, 2019, all 387 aircraft in service were grounded. Three major U.S. airlines--Southwest, United, and American Airlines—were affected by this decision.

Further investigations also revealed that the FAA and Boeing had colluded on recertification test flights, attempted to cover up important information and that the FAA had retaliated against whistleblowers.

==Regulatory process==
===Designated Engineering Representative===
A Designated Engineering Representative (DER) is an engineer who is appointed under 14 CFR section 183.29 to act on behalf of a company or as an independent consultant (IC). The DER system enables the FAA to delegate certain involvement in airworthiness exams, tests, and inspections to qualified technical people outside of the FAA. Qualifications and policies for appointment of Designated Airworthiness Representatives are established in FAA Order 8100.8, &quot;Designee Management Handbook&quot;. Working procedures for DERs are prescribed in FAA Order 8110.37, &quot;Designated Engineering Representative (DER) Handbook&quot;.

*Company DERs act on behalf of their employer and may only approve, or recommend that the FAA approves, technical data produced by their employer.
*Consultant DERs are appointed to act as independent DERs and may approve, or recommend that the FAA approves, technical data produced by any person or organization.

Neither type of DER is an employee of either the FAA or the United States government. While a DER represents the FAA when acting under the authority of a DER appointment; a DER has no federal protection for work done or the decisions made as a DER. Neither does the FAA provide any indemnification for a DER from general tort law. &quot;The FAA cannot shelter or protect DERs from the consequences of their findings.&quot;

===Designated Airworthiness Representative (DAR)===

A DAR is an individual appointed in accordance with 14 CFR 183.33 who may perform examination, inspection, and testing services necessary to the issuance of certificates. There are two types of DARs: manufacturing, and maintenance.

*Manufacturing DARs must possess aeronautical knowledge, experience, and meet the qualification requirements of FAA Order 8100.8.
*Maintenance DARs must hold:
*# a mechanic&#x27;s certificate with an airframe and powerplant rating, under 14 CFR part 65 &quot;Certification: Airmen Other Than Flight Crewmembers&quot;, or
*# a repairman certificate and be employed at a repair station certificated under 14 CFR part 145, or an air carrier operating certificate holder with an FAA-approved continuous airworthiness program, and must meet the qualification requirements of Order 8100.8, Chapter 14.

Specialized Experience – Amateur-Built and Light-Sport Aircraft DARs Both Manufacturing DARs and Maintenance DARs may be authorized to perform airworthiness certification of light-sport aircraft. DAR qualification criteria and selection procedures for amateur-built and light-sport aircraft airworthiness functions are provided in Order 8100.8.

=== Continued Airworthiness Notification to the International Community (CANIC) ===
A Continued Airworthiness Notification to the International Community (commonly abbreviated as CANIC) is a notification from the FAA to civil airworthiness authorities of foreign countries of pending significant safety actions.

The FAA Airworthiness Directives Manual, states the following:
8. Continued Airworthiness Notification to the International Community (CANIC).

:a. A CANIC is used to notify civil airworthiness authorities of other countries of pending significant safety actions. A significant safety action can be defined as, but not limited to, the following:

::(1) Urgent safety situations;

::(2) The pending issuance of an Emergency AD;

::(3) A safety action that affects many people, operators;

::(4) A Special Federal Aviation Regulation (SFAR);

::(5) Other high interest event (e.g., a special certification review). 

==== Notable CANICs ====

The FAA issued a CANIC to state the continued airworthiness of the Boeing 737 MAX, following the crash of Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302.

Another CANIC notified the ungrounding of the MAX, ending a 20-month grounding.

=== Proposed regulatory reforms ===

====FAA reauthorization and air traffic control reform====
U.S. law requires that the FAA&#x27;s budget and mandate be reauthorized on a regular basis. On July 18, 2016, President Obama signed a second short-term extension of the FAA authorization, replacing a previous extension that was due to expire that day.

The 2016 extension (set to expire itself in September 2017) left out a provision pushed by Republican House leadership, including House Transportation and Infrastructure (T&amp;I) Committee Chairman Bill Shuster (R-PA). The provision would have moved authority over air traffic control from the FAA to a non-profit corporation, as many other nations, such as Canada, Germany and the United Kingdom, have done. Shuster&#x27;s bill, the Aviation Innovation, Reform, and Reauthorization (AIRR) Act, expired in the House at the end of the 114th Congress.

The House T&amp;I Committee began the new reauthorization process for the FAA in February 2017. It is expected that the committee will again urge Congress to consider and adopt air traffic control reform as part of the reauthorization package. Shuster has additional support from President Trump, who, in a meeting with aviation industry executives in early 2017 said the U.S. air control system is &quot;...totally out of whack.&quot;
