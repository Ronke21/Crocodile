<doc id="10827" wikidata="Q506702" url="?curid=10827" title="Film crew">
<text>A film crew is a group of people, hired by a production company, for the purpose of producing a film or motion picture. The crew is distinguished from the cast, as the cast are understood to be the actors who appear in front of the camera or provide voices for characters in the film. The crew is also separate from the producers, as the producers are the ones who own a portion of either the film studio or the film&#x27;s intellectual property rights. A film crew is divided into different departments, each of which specializes in a specific aspect of the production. Film crew positions have evolved over the years, spurred by technological change, but many traditional jobs date from the early 20th century and are common across jurisdictions and filmmaking cultures.

Motion picture projects have three discrete stages: development, production, and distribution. Within the production stage there are also three clearly defined sequential phases (pre-production, principal photography, and post-production) and many film crew positions are associated with only one or two of the phases. Distinctions are also made between above-the-line personnel (such as the director, screenwriter, and producers) who begin their involvement during the project&#x27;s development stage, and the below-the-line technical crew involved only with the production stage.

== Director ==
A director is the person who directs the making of a film. The director most often has the highest authority on a film set. Generally, a director controls a film&#x27;s artistic and dramatic aspects and visualizes the screenplay (or script) while guiding the technical crew and actors in the fulfillment of that vision. The director has a key role in choosing the cast members, production design, and the creative aspects of filmmaking. Under European Union law, the director is viewed as the author of the film.

The director gives direction to the cast and crew, and creates an overall vision through which a film eventually becomes realized or noticed. Directors need to be able to mediate differences in creative visions and stay within the boundaries of the film&#x27;s budget. There are many pathways to becoming a film director. Some directors started as screenwriters, cinematographers, film editors, or actors. Other directors have attended a film school. Directors use different approaches. Some outline a general plotline and let the actors improvise dialogue, while others control every aspect, and demand that the actors and crew follow instructions precisely. Some directors also write their own screenplays or collaborate on screenplays with long-standing writing partners. Some directors edit or appear in their films, or compose the music score for their films.

== Production ==
Production is generally not considered a department as such, but rather as a series of functional groups. These include the film&#x27;s producers and executive producers and production office staff such as the production manager, the production coordinator, and their assistants; the various assistant directors; the accounting staff and sometimes the locations manager and their assistants.

; Producer
: A film producer creates the conditions for filmmaking. The producer initiates, coordinates, supervises, and controls matters such as fund raising, hiring key personnel, and arranging for distributors. The producer is involved throughout all phases of the film making process from development to completion of a project. There may be several producers on a film who may take a role in a number of areas, such as development, financing or production.
; Executive producer
: An executive producer (EP) is a producer who was not involved in the technical aspects of the filmmaking process in the original definition, but has played a financial or creative role in ensuring that the project goes into production. Today, however, the title has become ambiguous, particularly in feature films. Since the 1980s, it has become increasingly common for the line producer to be given the title of executive producer, while the initiating producer takes the &quot;produced by&quot; credit. On other projects, the reverse happens, with the line producer taking the &quot;produced by&quot; credit. So the two credits have become effectively interchangeable, with no precise definition.

=== Production office ===
; Line producer
: The line producer is the liaison between the studio or producer and the production manager, responsible for managing the production budget. The title is associated with the idea that they are the person who is &quot;on the line&quot; on a day-to-day basis, and responsible for lining up the resources needed.
; Production assistant
: Production assistants, referred to as PAs, assist in the production office or in various departments with general tasks, such as assisting the first assistant director with set operations.

==== Production managements ====
; Production manager
: The production manager supervises the physical aspects of the production (not the creative aspects) including personnel, technology, budget, and scheduling. It is the production manager&#x27;s responsibility to make sure the filming stays on schedule and within its budget. The PM also helps manage the day-to-day budget by managing operating costs such as salaries, production costs, and everyday equipment rental costs. The PM often works under the supervision of a line producer and directly supervises the production coordinator.
; Assistant production manager
: The assistant production manager is the assistant to the production manager (PM) and carries out various jobs for the PM. Normally only big budget Hollywood feature films have an assistant PM.
; Unit manager
: The unit manager fulfills the same role as the production manager but for secondary &quot;unit&quot; shooting. In some functional structures, the unit manager subsumes the role of the transport coordinator.
; Production coordinator
: The production coordinator is the information nexus of the production, responsible for organizing all the logistics from hiring crew, renting equipment, and booking talent. The PC is an integral part of film production.
; First assistant director
: The first assistant director (1st AD) assists the production manager and director. The ultimate aim of any 1st AD is to ensure the film comes in on schedule while maintaining a safe working environment in which the director, principal artists (actors) and crew can be focused on their work. They oversee day-to-day management of the cast and crew scheduling, equipment, script, and set. A 1st AD may also be responsible for directing background action for major shots or the entirety of relatively minor shots, at the director&#x27;s discretion.
; Second assistant director
: The second assistant director (2nd AD) is the chief assistant of the 1st AD and helps carry out those tasks delegated to the 1st AD. The 2nd AD may also direct background action and extras in addition to helping the 1st AD with scheduling, booking, etc. The 2nd AD is responsible for creating call sheets that let the crew know the schedule and important details about the shooting day.
; Other assistant directors
: Sometimes other assistant directors are needed such as in Canadian and British functional structures the 3rd assistant director (3rd AD) and even trainee assistant directors (trainee AD). In the American system there are 2nd 2nd assistant director (2nd 2nd AD). Normally in the American system 2nd 2nd ADs control big crowd extras and make sure if shooting on location none of the public get into shots.

==== Accounting ====
; Production accountant
: Production accountants manage the money and ensure the production comes in on budget and everyone gets paid. The industry is notorious for unusual accounting methods which are collectively labelled Hollywood accounting. Production accountants are often assisted by assistant accountants, sometimes called clerks, responsible for accounts receivable, accounts payable and payroll.

=== Locations ===
; Location manager
: Oversees the locations department and its staff, typically reporting directly to the production manager or assistant director (or even director or executive producer). Location manager is responsible for final clearing (or guaranteeing permission to use) a location for filming and must often assist production and finance departments in maintaining budget management regarding actual location/permit fees as well as labor costs to production for the locations department at large.
; Assistant location manager
: Works with the location manager and the various departments in arranging technical scouts for the essential staff (grips, electric, camera, etc.) to see options which the location manager has selected for filming. The assistant location manager will be onset during the filming process to oversee the operation, whereas the location manager continues pre-production from elsewhere (generally an office) on the upcoming locations. (On most location-based television shows, there will be two assistant location managers that alternate episodes, allowing one to prep an upcoming episode while the other is on set with the current one)
; Location scout
: Does much of the actual research, footwork and photography to document location possibilities. Often the location manager will do some scouting themselves, as well as the assistant location manager.
; Location assistant
: Hired by the location manager to be on set before, during, and after the filming process. General responsibilities include arriving first at the location to allow the set dressers into the set for preparation; maintaining the cleanliness of the location areas during filming; fielding complaints from neighbours; and ultimately, at the end of the filming, making sure it seems as though the film crew was never there. There are generally one to three assistants on a shoot at any given time.
; Location production assistant
: This position exists generally on larger budget productions. The locations PA is the assistant who is almost never on set, but instead is always prepping a location or &quot;wrapping&quot; a location; that is, when a location requires several days of setup and breakdown preceding and following the day(s) of filming. A location production assistant is what a set production assistant is in Canada.

=== Digital service ===
Since the turn of the 21st century, several additional professionals are now routinely listed in the production credits on most major motion pictures.
; Social publicist
: The publicist liaises between the film production and the media. They create press releases, in collaboration with the producers, and work with the unit still photographer.
; Legal counsel
: Entertainment lawyers negotiate contracts, clear licensing rights for any intellectual property used in the film, obtain tax credits from local governments, and take care of immigration paperwork when cast or crew cross international borders to shoot on location.
; System administrator
: A system administrator or sysadmin, is a person employed to maintain and operate a computer system or network. This role is increasingly important for digital monitors on set, digital intermediate editing and post production, digital effects, digital sound, and sometimes for full digital production.

=== Continuity ===
; Script supervisor
: Also known as the continuity person, the script supervisor keeps track of what parts of the script have been filmed and makes notes of any deviations between what was actually filmed and what appeared in the script. They make notes on every shot, and keep track of props, blocking, and other details to ensure continuity between shots and scenes. An important part of a script supervisor&#x27;s job is to make sure that the actors&#x27; movements, the directions they are looking in a shot, particularly when speaking to or responding to another actor, plus the positions of props they are using and every thing else matches from shot to shot. If there is an apparent mismatch, the director must be informed immediately so that it can be reshot before the lighting setup is changed or at least before the location is wrapped and the set is struck. Not only does the job of script supervisor require a great deal of awareness and meticulous note-taking skills, it also requires much diplomacy to advise the director that they may have a problem editing something just recorded. The script supervisor is also in charge of providing the &quot;official&quot; scene numbers and take numbers to the second camera assistant (clapper loader in some countries) for the slate, as well as to the sound mixer, and to clearly note which take the director has chosen to be used (as a &quot;print&quot;, in film terms) in the finished product. All of this information is then relayed to the editor every day after shooting has wrapped in the form of copies made of both the script supervisor&#x27;s notes as well as their matching script pages.

=== Casting ===
; Casting director
: The casting director chooses the actors for the characters of the movie. This usually involves inviting potential actors to read an excerpt from the script for an audition.
; Cast Production Assistant
: The cast PA assists the actors of the film. This usually involves personal and technical requests, that might be highly sensible and private or common domain or knowledge.

== Camera and lighting ==

; Director of photography
: The director of photography (sometimes shortened to DP or DoP) is in charge of the look of the &quot;frame&quot; of the movie shots, hence the name &quot;photography&quot;. They are the chief of the camera and lighting crew of the film. The DP makes decisions on lighting and framing of shots in conjunction with the film&#x27;s director. Typically, the director tells the DP how they want a shot to look, and the DP chooses the correct lens, filter, lighting and composition to achieve the desired aesthetic effect. The DP is the senior creative crew member after the director.
: The term cinematographer is usually synonymous with director of photography, though some professionals insist this only applies when the director of photography and camera operator are the same person.

=== Camera ===
; Camera operator
: The camera operator uses the camera at the direction of the cinematographer, director of photography, or the film director to capture the scenes on film or video. Generally, a cinematographer or director of photography does not operate the camera, but sometimes these jobs may be combined.
; First assistant camera
: The first assistant camera, 1st AC or focus puller, is responsible for keeping the camera in focus as it is shooting, as well as building the camera at the beginning of the day and taking it apart at the end. They also thread the film when a new magazine is loaded.
; Second assistant camera
: The second assistant camera, 2nd AC or clapper loader, operates the clapperboard commonly referred to in the United States as a &quot;slate&quot; at the beginning of each take and loads the raw film stock or blank videocassette into the camera magazines between takes, if there is no additional specifically designated film loader. The 2nd AC is also in charge of overseeing the meticulously kept notebooks that record when the film stock is received, used, and sent to the lab for processing. Additionally, the 2nd AC oversees organization of camera equipment and transport of the equipment from one shooting location to another.
; Film loader
: The film loader transfers motion picture film from the manufacturer&#x27;s light-tight canisters to the camera magazines for attachment to the camera by the 2nd AC. After exposure during filming, the loader then removes the film from the magazines and places it back into the light-tight cans for transport to the laboratory. It is the responsibility of the loader to manage the inventory of film and communicate with the 1st AC on the film usage and remaining stock throughout the day. On small production crews, this job is often combined with the 2nd AC. With the prevalence of digital photography, this role is taken on by the digital imaging technician.
; Camera production assistant
: The camera PA, camera intern or camera trainee, assists the crew while learning the trade of the camera assistant, operator or cinematographer.
; Digital imaging technician
: On digital photography productions the digital imaging technician, or DIT, is responsible for the coordination of the internal workings of the digital camera. Under the direction of the cinematographer or director of photography, the DIT will make adjustments to the multitude of variables available in most professional digital cameras to creatively or technically manipulate the resulting image. It may also be the responsibility of the DIT to archive and manage the digital data, create compressed dailies from raw footage and prepare all digital images for post-production.
; Steadicam operator
: A steadicam operator is someone who is skilled at operating a steadicam (trademark for a camera stabilization rig). This person is usually one of the camera operators on the production.
; Motion control technician / Operator
: This technician operates a motion control rig, which essentially is a &#x27;camera robot&#x27; able to consistently repeat camera moves for special effects uses. Motion control rigs are typically rented with an experienced operator.
; Set photographer
: The Set Photographer is the person who creates film stills, still photographic images specifically intended for use in the marketing and publicity. 

=== Lighting ===
; Gaffer
: The gaffer is the head of the lighting department, responsible for the design of the lighting plan for a production. Sometimes the gaffer is credited as chief lighting technician.
; Best boy (electric)
: The best boy electric is the chief assistant to the gaffer. They are not usually on set, but dealing with upkeep of the lighting truck, rentals, manpower, and other logistics. Sometimes the best boy electric is credited as assistant chief lighting technician.
; Lighting technician / Electrics
: Also called electrics or lamp operators, lighting technicians are involved with setting up and controlling lighting equipment and temporary power distribution on set.

=== Grip ===
Grips are trained lighting and rigging technicians. Their main responsibility is to work closely with the electrical department to put in the non-electrical components of lighting set-ups required for a shot, such as flags, overheads, and bounces. On the sound stage, they move and adjust major set pieces when something needs to be moved to get a camera into position. In addition to lifting heavy objects and setting rigging points for lights, they also report to the key grip. In the US and Canada, grips may belong to the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees.

; Key grip
: The key grip is the chief grip on a set, and is the head of the set operations department. The key grip works with the director of photography to help set up the set and to achieve correct lighting and blocking. They are also used to manoeuver the cameras around the set.
; Best boy (grip)
: The best boy is chief assistant to the key grip. They are also responsible for organizing the grip truck throughout the day.
; Dolly grip
: The grip in charge of operating the camera dollies and camera cranes is called the dolly grip. They place, level, and move the dolly track, then push and pull the dolly, and usually a camera operator and camera assistant as riders.

== Sound production ==
; Production sound mixer
: The production sound mixer (or sound recordist) is the head of the sound department on location and is responsible for the operation of the audio mixer and recorder(s) which receive feeds from the microphones on set. It is their responsibility to decide how they will deploy their team to capture the sound for each shot, select which microphones will be used for each setup, mix audio from all of the microphones in real time into a &quot;mix track&quot; that will be used while viewing rushes and during the edit, and sometimes in the final film, and to maintain logs of audio related issues for post production. The sound mixer is considered a department head, and is thus completely responsible for all aspects of production sound.
; Boom operator
: The boom operator, first assistant sound or &quot;1st AS&quot;, is responsible for using microphones on the end of boom poles (lightweight telescopic poles made of aluminium, or more commonly, carbon fibre) held above actor&#x27;s heads during a scene to capture dialogue. It is also their responsibility to relay information from the &quot;floor&quot; back to the production sound mixer regarding upcoming shots, troublesome noises that the mixer will need to be made aware of if they can not be silenced, and for mounting radio microphones on actors. In France, the boom operator is called the perchman.
; Second assistant sound
: The second assistant sound, utility sound technician, or &quot;2nd AS&quot;, is the assistant to the boom operator and is responsible for moving and preparing sound equipment for use around the set while the boom op watches rehearsals and prepares for the next shot, as well as handling wireless audio feeds to the director, script supervisor and producers, and laying carpet and other sound dampening materials in locations with problematic floors or a troublesome acoustic. In addition, the 2nd AS is regularly called upon to operate a second boom in scenes with a larger number of actors or where actors are physically spaced too far apart for the 1st AS to cover all of the dialogue with one microphone. The 2nd AS also regularly aids in the radio mic&#x27;ing of cast when there are a large number of actors in a scene. The term &quot;sound utility technician&quot; is now considered an outdated term by BECTU in the UK and 2nd AS is preferred, with sound utility technician as a role being omitted from recent versions of the rate card. The role is sometimes informally known as a &quot;cable wrangler&quot; or &quot;cable boy&quot;.

== Art department ==
The art department in a major feature film can often number hundreds of people. Usually it is considered to include several sub-departments: the art department proper, with its art director, set designers and draftsmen; set decoration, under the set decorator; props, under the props master/mistress; construction, headed by the construction coordinator; scenic, headed by the key scenic artist; and special effects.

; Production designer
: The production designer is responsible for creating the visual appearance of the film – settings, costumes, character makeup; all taken as a unit. The production designer works closely with the director and the director of photography to achieve the look of the film.

=== Art (sets and graphic art) ===
Within the overall art department is a sub-department, also called the art department – which can be confusing. This consists of the people who design the sets and create the graphic art.

; Art director
: The art director reports to the production designer, and more directly oversees artists and craftspeople, such as the set designers, graphic artists, and illustrators who give form to the production design as it develops. The art director works closely with the construction coordinator and key scenic artist to oversee the aesthetic and textural details of sets as they are realized. Typically, the art director oversees the budget and schedule of the overall art department. On large-budget productions with numerous sets and several art directors, one might be credited as supervising art director or senior art director.
; Standby art director
: In the organizational system used in Ireland or the United Kingdom, the standby art director monitors the art department&#x27;s work on set during filming on behalf of the production designer. They work closely with the standby painters and standby carpenters, and co-ordinate any changes to the set during filming. In the North American system, this work is shared between the props master and the on-set dresser.
; Assistant art director
: The first, second and third assistant art directors carry out the instructions of the art director. Their work often involves measuring locations and collecting other pertinent information for the production designer. Sometimes a set designer is also the first assistant art director. In this capacity, they manage the workflow and act as the foreman of the drawing office.
; Illustrator
: The illustrator draws or paints visual representations of the designs to communicate the ideas imagined by the production designer. Illustrators are sometimes credited as concept artists.
; Graphic artist
: The graphic artist is responsible for the design and creation of all graphic elements, including: signs, billboards, posters, logos, nameplates, and automotive-wrapping — that are created specifically for the film. They will often create several versions of a design, the preferred of which then being chosen by the production designer. On certain productions, they may also be employed, under the direction of the props master, in the creation of small, printed items, such as fliers, receipts, bills of sale, etc.

=== Sets ===
; Set designer
: The set designer is the draftsman, often an architect, who realizes the structures or interior spaces called for by the production designer. Set decorator: The set decorator is in charge of the decorating of a film set, which includes the furnishings and all the other objects that will be seen in the film. They work closely with the production designer and coordinate with the art director. In recognition of the set decorator&#x27;s importance, the Academy Award for art direction is given jointly to both the production designer and the set decorator. Set dresser The set dressers apply and remove the &quot;dressing&quot;; i.e., furniture, drapery, carpets, wall signs, vinyl decals – everything one would find in a location, (even doorknobs and wall sockets, when such items do not fall under the purview of construction.) Most of the swing gang&#x27;s work occurs before and after the shooting crew arrives, but one set dresser remains with the shooting crew and is known as the on-set dresser. In some countries, such as Ireland or the United Kingdom, the set dressing department is referred to as dressing props department. Informally, in the US, the department is often referred to simply as &quot;set dec&quot;.
; Buyer
: The buyer works with, and reports to, the set decorator. The buyer locates, and then purchases or rents the set dressing. Then there is the Leadman. The leadman (or leadperson) is the foreman of the set dressing crew, often referred to as the swing gang. They also assist the set decorator.
; Set dresser
: The set dressers apply and remove the &quot;dressing&quot;; i.e., furniture, drapery, carpets, wall signs, vinyl decals – everything one would find in a location, (even doorknobs and wall sockets, when such items do not fall under the purview of construction.) Most of the swing gang&#x27;s work occurs before and after the shooting crew arrives, but one set dresser remains with the shooting crew and is known as the on-set dresser. In some countries, such as Ireland or the United Kingdom, the set dressing department is referred to as dressing props department. Informally, in the US, the department is often referred to simply as &quot;set dec&quot;.
; Greensman
: The greensman or greensperson is a specialised set dresser dealing with the artistic arrangement or landscape design of plant material, sometimes real and sometimes artificial, and usually a combination of both. Depending on the scope of the greens work in a film, the greensperson may report to the art director or may report directly to the production designer. If a significant amount of greens work is required in a film, then the greens may be an identifiable sub-department, with its own team – often of a size numbering double figures – and hierarchy (e.g., greensmaster, greens supervisor, foreperson, leading hand, laborers). Specialists from other areas of the art dept. (e.g., fabricators, sculptors, painters, scenics) may also be drafted to work exclusively on greens.

=== Construction ===
; Construction coordinator
: The construction coordinator oversees the construction of all the sets. The coordinator orders materials, schedules the work, and supervises the often sizeable construction crew of carpenters, painters and labourers. In some jurisdictions the construction coordinator is called the construction manager.
; Head carpenter
: The head carpenter is the foreman of a gang of carpenters and laborers.
; Propmaker
: The propmaker (prop fabricator), as the name implies, builds the props that are used for the film. In US jurisdictions, propmakers are carpenters who build props and sets, and are often technicians skilled in wood and metalwork.

=== Scenic ===
; Key scenic
: The key scenic artist (scenic charge) is responsible for the surface treatments of the sets. This includes special paint treatments such as aging and gilding, as well as simulating the appearance of wood, stone, brick, metal, stained glass—anything called for by the production designer. The key scenic artist supervises the crew of painters, and is often a master craftsperson. In the UK, the above responsibilities would normally be those of the head painter, and the scenic artist is responsible for producing artist painted backings. In the US, a key scenic is called the charge scenic.
; Head of the Plastering Department
: The Head of the Plastering Department is responsible for managing fibrous plasterers, who are highly skilled plasters who can re-create any period, using mold making and casting abilities.

=== Property ===
; Propmaster
: The propmaster or mistress is in charge of finding and managing all the props that appear in the film. These include any items handled by actors that are not part of the scenery or costumes, and all consumable food items that appear on screen. Job responsibilities include purchasing, renting, and manufacturing anything actors handle or touch. In period works, it is the propmaster&#x27;s job to ensure that the props provided are accurate to the time period. The propmistress usually has several assistants. The assistant propmaster is the person running the set and in charge of working directly with the actors, director, and on-set crew. Weapons master: Any film that uses a prop gun that is a &quot;realistic imitation firearm&quot; should have a weapons master. The weapons master, sometimes credited as the armorer, weapons specialist, weapons handler, weapons wrangler, or weapons coordinator, is a film-crew specialist who works with the propmaster, director, actors, stunt coordinator, and script supervisor. The weapons master is specifically responsible for maintaining control of any prop weapons, including firearms, knives, swords, bows, and staff weapons.

== Costume department ==
; Costume designer
: The costume designer is responsible for all the clothing and costumes worn by all the actors that appear on screen. They are also responsible for designing, planning, and organizing the construction of the garments down to the fabric, colors, and sizes. The costume designer works closely with the director to understand and interpret &quot;character&quot;, and counsels with the production designer to achieve an overall tone of the film. In large productions, the costume designer will usually have one or more assistant costume designers.
; Costume supervisor
: The costume supervisor works closely with the designer. In addition to helping with the design of the costumes, they manage the wardrobe workspace. They supervise construction or sourcing of garments, hiring and firing of support staff, budget, paperwork, and department logistics. It is also called the wardrobe supervisor, although this term is used less and less.
; Key costumer
: The key costumer is employed on larger productions to manage the set costumers, and to handle the star&#x27;s wardrobe needs.
; Costume standby
: The costume standby is present on set at all times. It is his or her responsibility to monitor the quality and continuity of the actors and actresses costumes before and during takes. she or he will also assist the actors and actresses with dressing.
; Breakdown artist
: A breakdown artist may be employed during the pre-production period to break down garments. This specialized job includes making new clothing appear dirty, faded, and worn.
; Costume buyer
: On large productions a buyer may be employed to source and purchase fabrics and garments. A buyer might also be referred to as a shopper. This distinction is often made when the lead actor in a production has control over their wardrobe, and they may personally hire this person.
; Cutter
: A costume technician who fits or tailors costumes, usually on set. They might also be called fitter, seamstress, or tailor. Some celebrity actors have favorite cutters, and larger productions may hire several and have them on set at the same time, particularly in period film projects that might have complicated or expensive extras wardrobe.

=== Hair and make-up ===
Some actors or actresses have personal makeup artists or hair stylists.

; Make-up Designer
: The makeup designer is the department head that answers directly to the director and production designer. They are responsible for planning makeup designs for all leading and supporting cast. Their department includes all cosmetic makeup, body makeup and if special effects are involved, the makeup designer will consult with a special effects makeup team to create all prosthetics and SFX makeup in a production. It is common that the makeup designer performs makeup applications on lead cast, with assistance, and allows other crew members to work with supporting and minor roles. The designer will normally execute especially complicated or important makeup processes that are to be featured on camera.
; Special make-up effects artist (SFX makeup): A special effects make-up artist works with live models or structures in the entertainment industry, applying make-up effects or prosthetics. May be an own department that answers directly to the director and production designer or reports to the Key make-up artist.
; Make-up supervisor: The make-up supervisor is a supporting position that normally reports to the key makeup artist to assist in running the makeup department. Make-up supervisors typically handle production matters and generally serve the needs of senior artists. Makeup supervisors rarely do makeup themselves. Their duties can include keeping a record of makeup continuity, handing the scheduling of makeup teams and providing for the general needs of the makeup department. They are expected to be a connection between the makeup department and the rest of the production departments, making sure that makeup supplies, production assistants or electricians are on hand when needed.
; Make-up artist: Make-up artists work with makeup, hair and special effects to create the characters look for anyone appearing on screen. They assist and report to the key make-up artist.
; Key hair: The key hair is the department head that answers directly to the director and production designer. The key hair will normally design and style the hair of lead actors.
; Hair stylist: The hair stylist is responsible for maintaining and styling the hair, including wigs and extensions, of anyone appearing on screen. They assist and report to the key hair.

== Special effects ==
The special effects department oversees the mechanical effects (also called physical or practical effects) that create optical illusions during live-action shooting. It is not to be confused with the visual effects department, which adds photographic effects during filming to be altered later during video editing in the post-production process.

; Special effects supervisor
: The special effects supervisor instructs the special effects crew on how to design moving set elements and props that will safely break, explode, burn, collapse and implode without destroying the film set. He or she is also responsible for reproducing weather conditions and other on-camera magic.
; Special effects assistant
: The SFX assistants carry out the instructions of the special effects supervisor, building set pieces like breakaway furniture and cities in miniature, lighting pyrotechnics, and setting up rigging equipment for stunts.

== Stunts ==
; Stunt coordinator
: Where the film requires a stunt and involves the use of stunt performers, the stunt coordinator will arrange the casting and performance of the stunt, working closely with the director and the 1st AD.
; Set Medic
: Films and TV programs in general should always have a set or unit medic on set at all times from construction, through filming and to strike but a film unit that has stunts must always have trained senior EMT(A) or Paramedic on Set.

== Post-production ==
; Film editor
: The film editor is the creative head of the post production department and is responsible for assembling the picture into a cohesive edited story, with the help of the director. They are primarily responsible for selecting performances of the actors with the director, adjusting the tempo, pace, and structure of the final edited film. In some cases, the editor may help restructure the story of a film differently from the original script to focus a story point, or increase an emotional response from the audience. They are also involved with providing feedback on the sound mix, visual effects, and music with the director. They can also collaborate with the colorist and director of photography to adjust framing for mood or eye trace. There are usually several assistant editors who creatively support the editor as well as manage footage and data for the entire post production team.
; Post-production supervisor
: Post-production supervisors are responsible for the post-production process, during which they maintain clarity of information and good channels of communication between the producer, editor, supervising sound editor, the facilities companies (such as film labs, CGI studios and negative cutters) and the production accountant. Although this is not a creative role, it is pivotal in ensuring that the film&#x27;s post-production budget is manageable and achievable, and that all deadlines are met. Because large amounts of money are involved, and most of a film&#x27;s budget is spent during production, the post-production period can often be difficult and challenging.

: The negative cutter cuts and splices the negatives as directed by the film editor, and then provides the assembled negative reels to the lab for prints (positives for projection) to be made.
; Colorist
: With a photochemical process, the color timer adjusts the color of the film via printer lights for greater consistency in the film&#x27;s colors. With a digital intermediate process, the colorist can use digital tools in manipulating the image and has greater creative freedom in changing the aesthetic of a film.
; Telecine colorist
: A telecine colorist is responsible for a &quot;grade&quot;, a look that has been created with a grading system, which adjusts brightness, contrast and color.

=== Visual effects ===
Visual effects commonly refers to post-production alterations of the film&#x27;s images. The on set VFX crew works to prepare shots and plates for future visual effects. This may include adding tracking markers, taking and asking for reference plates and helping the director understand the limitations and ease of certain shots that will effect the future post production. A VFX crew can also work alongside the special effects department for any on-set optical effects that need physical representation during filming (on camera).

; Visual effects producer
: The visual effects producer works with the visual effects supervisor to break down the script into storyboards, and advises the director as to how she or he should approach the scenes. Together they determine which sequences are to be shot as live action elements, which would work well in miniature, and which (if any) should be computer generated.
; Visual effects creative director
: VFX creative directors are very much like production designers, except they direct and supervise the creative side of the film&#x27;s visual effects. The position is particularly in demand for films with massive amounts of computer generated imagery and scenes.
; Visual effects supervisor
: The visual effects supervisor is in charge of the VFX crew, working with production and the film&#x27;s director to achieve the desired in-camera optical effects of the film.
; Visual effects editor
: The visual effects editor incorporates visual effects into the current cuts of live action sequences, producing multiple versions of each shot. Altered scenes are then evaluated by the visual effects supervisor and creative director for aesthetic and technical direction, and by the producers for review and final editing.
; Compositor
: A compositor is a visual effects artist responsible for compositing images from different sources such as video, film, computer generated 3D imagery, 2D animations, matte paintings, photographs, and text.
; Rotoscope artists / Paint artists
: Rotoscope and paint artists may rotoscope the footage, manually creating mattes for use in compositing. They may also paint visual information into or out of a scene, such as removing wires and rigs, logos, dust busting, scratch removal, etc.
; Matte painter
: Matte painters draw and paint entire sets or extend portions of an existing set.

=== Sound and music ===
; Sound designer
: The sound designer, or supervising sound editor, is in charge of the post-production sound of a movie. Sometimes this may involve great creative license, and other times it may simply mean working with the director and editor to balance the sound to their liking.
; Dialogue editor
: The dialogue editor is responsible for assembling and editing all the dialog in the soundtrack.
; Sound editor
: The sound editor is responsible for assembling and editing all the sound effects in the soundtrack.
; Re-recording mixer
: The re-recording mixer balances all of the sounds prepared by the dialogue, music and effects editors, and finalizes the film&#x27;s audio track.
; Music supervisor
: The music supervisor works with the composer, mixers and editors to create and integrate the film&#x27;s music. In Hollywood, a music supervisor&#x27;s primary responsibility is to act as liaison between the film production and the recording industry, negotiating the use rights for all source music used in a film.
; Composer
: The composer is responsible for writing the musical score for a film.
; Foley artist
: The foley artist is the person who creates the post-sync sound effects for a film. These sound effects are recorded in sync to picture and are mostly body movements, footsteps or object manipulations. The most common reason for recording these effects live to picture is the fact that such sounds are lost when the dialogue is removed to be replaced by a foreign-language version. Unsatisfactorily recorded sync sound effects can also be replaced with foley effects. Foley artists are also known as foley walkers. Foley is named after its first known practitioner, an early Hollywood sound editor named Jack Foley.
; Conductor / Orchestrator
: A conductor is supposed to be knowledgeable of special synchronization procedures to conduct the score to an orchestra. An orchestrator is someone who furthers the composer&#x27;s notes and symbols and fills out the intended notation for the film score.
; Score recorder / mixer
: A score&#x27;s recorder is someone who records the film score and a score&#x27;s mixer is someone who mixes the film score.
; Music preparation
: A music preparer is someone who prepares out the score for orchestra performers and who copies out the music.
; Music editor
: A music editor is someone who edits the film score and works with the composer to make sure it goes with the film.
; Additional orchestration
: Additional orchestration people work with the conductor and orchestrator, and edit the film score.

== Previsualization ==
Previsualization (also known as previs, previz, pre-rendering, preview, or wireframe windows) is the visualizing of complex scenes in a film before filming. It is also a concept in still photography. It is also used to describe techniques such as storyboarding, either in the form of charcoal sketches or in digital technology, in the planning and conceptualization of film scenes.

== Animation ==
Animation film crews have many of the same roles and departments as live-action films (including directing, production, editing, camera, sound, etc.), but nearly all on-set departments (lighting, electrical, grip, sets, props, costume, hair, makeup, special effects, and stunts) were traditionally replaced with a single animation department made up of various types of animators (character, effects, in-betweeners, cleanup, etc.). In traditional animation, the nature of the medium meant that everything was literally flattened into the drawn lines and solid colors that became the characters, making nearly all live-action positions irrelevant. Because animation has traditionally been so labor-intensive and thus expensive, animation films normally have a separate story department in which storyboard artists painstakingly develop scenes to make sure they make sense before they are actually animated.

However, since the turn of the 21st century, modern 3D computer graphics and computer animation have made possible a level of rich detail never seen before. Many animated films now have specialized artists and animators who act as the virtual equivalent of lighting technicians, grips, costume designers, props masters, set decorators, set dressers, and cinematographers. They make artistic decisions strongly similar to those of their live-action counterparts, but implement them in a virtual space that exists only in software rather than on a physical set. There have been major breakthroughs in the simulation of hair since 2005, meaning that hairstylists have been called in since then to consult on a few animation projects.

<doc id="10828" wikidata="Q44619" url="?curid=10828" title="Fear">
<text>Fear is an unpleasant emotion that arises in response to perceived dangers or threats. Fear causes physiological and psychological changes. It may produce behavioral reactions such as mounting an aggressive response or fleeing the threat, commonly known as the fight-or-flight response. Extreme cases of fear can trigger an immobilized freeze response. Fear in humans can occur in response to a present stimulus or anticipation of a future threat. Fear is involved in some mental disorders, particularly anxiety disorders.

In humans and other animals, fear is modulated by cognition and learning. Thus, fear is judged as rational and appropriate, or irrational and inappropriate. Irrational fears are phobias. Fear is closely related to the emotion anxiety, which occurs as the result of often future threats that are perceived to be uncontrollable or unavoidable. The fear response serves survival and has been preserved throughout evolution. Even simple invertebrates display an emotion &quot;akin to fear.&quot; Research suggests that fears are not solely dependent on their nature but also shaped by social relations and culture, which guide an individual&#x27;s understanding of when and how to fear.

==Physiological signs==

Many physiological changes in the body are associated with fear, summarized as the fight-or-flight response. An innate response for coping with danger, it works by accelerating the breathing rate (hyperventilation), heart rate, vasoconstriction of the peripheral blood vessels leading to blood pooling, dilating the pupils, increasing muscle tension including the muscles attached to each hair follicle to contract and causing &quot;goosebumps&quot;, or more clinically, piloerection (making a cold person warmer or a frightened animal look more impressive), sweating, increased blood glucose (hyperglycemia), increased serum calcium, increase in white blood cells called neutrophilic leukocytes, alertness leading to sleep disturbance and &quot;butterflies in the stomach&quot; (dyspepsia). This primitive mechanism may help an organism survive by either running away or fighting the danger. With the series of physiological changes, the consciousness realizes an emotion of fear.

There are observable physical reactions in individuals who experience fear. An individual might experience a feeling of dizziness, lightheaded, like they are being choked, sweating, shortness of breath, vomiting or nausea, numbness or shaking and any other like symptoms. These bodily reactions inform the individual that they are afraid and should proceed to remove or get away from the stimulus that is causing that fear.

==Causes==
An influential categorization of stimuli causing fear was proposed by psychologist Jeffrey Alan Gray; namely, intensity, novelty, special evolutionary dangers, stimuli arising during social interaction, and conditioned stimuli. Another categorization was proposed by Archer, who, besides conditioned fear stimuli, categorized fear-evoking (as well as aggression-evoking) stimuli into three groups; namely, pain, novelty, and frustration, although he also described &quot;looming&quot;, which refers to an object rapidly moving towards the visual sensors of a subject, and can be categorized as &quot;intensity&quot;. Russell described a more functional categorization of fear-evoking stimuli, in which for instance novelty is a variable affecting more than one category: 1) Predator stimuli (including movement, suddenness, proximity, but also learned and innate predator stimuli); 2) Physical environmental dangers (including intensity and heights); 3) Stimuli associated with increased risk of predation and other dangers (including novelty, openness, illumination, and being alone); 4) Stimuli stemming from conspecifics (including novelty, movement, and spacing behavior); 5) Species-predictable fear stimuli and experience (special evolutionary dangers); and 6) Fear stimuli that are not species predictable (conditioned fear stimuli).

=== Nature ===
Although many fears are learned, the capacity to fear is part of human nature. Many studies have found that certain fears (e.g. animals, heights) are much more common than others (e.g. flowers, clouds). These fears are also easier to induce in the laboratory. This phenomenon is known as preparedness. Because early humans that were quick to fear dangerous situations were more likely to survive and reproduce; preparedness is theorized to be a genetic effect that is the result of natural selection.

From an evolutionary psychology perspective, different fears may be different adaptations that have been useful in our evolutionary past. They may have developed during different time periods. Some fears, such as fear of heights, may be common to all mammals and developed during the mesozoic period. Other fears, such as fear of snakes, may be common to all simians and developed during the cenozoic time period (the still-ongoing geological era encompassing the last 66 million of history). Still others, such as fear of mice and insects, may be unique to humans and developed during the paleolithic and neolithic time periods (when mice and insects become important carriers of infectious diseases and harmful for crops and stored foods).

=== Conditioning ===

Nonhuman animals and humans innovate specific fears as a result of learning. This has been studied in psychology as fear conditioning, beginning with John B. Watson&#x27;s Little Albert experiment in 1920, which was inspired after observing a child with an irrational fear of dogs. In this study, an 11-month-old boy was conditioned to fear a white rat in the laboratory. The fear became generalized to include other white, furry objects, such as a rabbit, dog, and even a Santa Claus mask with white cotton balls in the beard.

Fear can be learned by experiencing or watching a frightening traumatic accident. For example, if a child falls into a well and struggles to get out, he or she may develop a fear of wells, heights (acrophobia), enclosed spaces (claustrophobia), or water (aquaphobia). There are studies looking at areas of the brain that are affected in relation to fear. When looking at these areas (such as the amygdala), it was proposed that a person learns to fear regardless of whether they themselves have experienced trauma, or if they have observed the fear in others. In a study completed by Andreas Olsson, Katherine I. Nearing and Elizabeth A. Phelps, the amygdala were affected both when subjects observed someone else being submitted to an aversive event, knowing that the same treatment awaited themselves, and when subjects were subsequently placed in a fear-provoking situation. This suggests that fear can develop in both conditions, not just simply from personal history.

Fear is affected by cultural and historical context. For example, in the early 20th century, many Americans feared polio, a disease that can lead to paralysis. There are consistent cross-cultural differences in how people respond to fear. Display rules affect how likely people are to express the facial expression of fear and other emotions.

Fear of victimization is a function of perceived risk and seriousness of potential harm.

== Common triggers ==
=== Phobias ===

According to surveys, some of the most common fears are of demons and ghosts, the existence of evil powers, cockroaches, spiders, snakes, heights, water, enclosed spaces, tunnels, bridges, needles, social rejection, failure, examinations, and public speaking.

Regionally some may more so fear terrorist attacks, death, war, criminal or gang violence, being alone, the future, nuclear war, flying, clowns, intimacy, people, and driving.

===Uncertainty===

Fear of the unknown or irrational fear is caused by negative thinking (worry) which arises from anxiety accompanied by a subjective sense of apprehension or dread. Irrational fear shares a common neural pathway with other fears, a pathway that engages the nervous system to mobilize bodily resources in the face of danger or threat. Many people are scared of the &quot;unknown&quot;. The irrational fear can branch out to many areas such as the hereafter, the next ten years or even tomorrow. Chronic irrational fear has deleterious effects since the elicitor stimulus is commonly absent or perceived from delusions. Such fear can create comorbidity with the anxiety disorder umbrella. Being scared may cause people to experience anticipatory fear of what may lie ahead rather than planning and evaluating for the same. For example, &quot;continuation of scholarly education&quot; is perceived by many educators as a risk that may cause them fear and stress, and they would rather teach things they&#x27;ve been taught than go and do research.

The ambiguity of situations that tend to be uncertain and unpredictable can cause anxiety in addition to other psychological and physical problems in some populations; especially those who engage it constantly, for example, in war-ridden places or in places of conflict, terrorism, abuse, etc. Poor parenting that instills fear can also debilitate a child&#x27;s psyche development or personality. For example, parents tell their children not to talk to strangers in order to protect them. In school, they would be motivated to not show fear in talking with strangers, but to be assertive and also aware of the risks and the environment in which it takes place. Ambiguous and mixed messages like this can affect their self-esteem and self-confidence. Researchers say talking to strangers is not something to be thwarted but allowed in a parent&#x27;s presence if required. Developing a sense of equanimity to handle various situations is often advocated as an antidote to irrational fear and as an essential skill by a number of ancient philosophies.

Fear of the unknown (FOTU) &quot;may be a, or possibly the, fundamental fear&quot; from early times when there were many threats to life.

==Behavior==
Although fear behavior varies from species to species, it is often divided into two main categories; namely, avoidance/flight and immobility. To these, different researchers have added different categories, such as threat display and attack, protective responses (including startle and looming responses), defensive burying, and social responses (including alarm vocalizations and submission). Finally, immobility is often divided into freezing and tonic immobility.

The decision as to which particular fear behavior to perform is determined by the level of fear as well as the specific context, such as environmental characteristics (escape route present, distance to refuge), the presence of a discrete and localized threat, the distance between threat and subject, threat characteristics (speed, size, directness of approach), the characteristics of the subject under threat (size, physical condition, speed, degree of crypsis, protective morphological structures), social conditions (group size), and the amount of experience with the type of the threat.

==Mechanism==

Often laboratory studies with rats are conducted to examine the acquisition and extinction of conditioned fear responses. In 2004, researchers conditioned rats (&quot;Rattus norvegicus&quot;) to fear a certain stimulus, through electric shock. The researchers were able to then cause an extinction of this conditioned fear, to a point that no medications or drugs were able to further aid in the extinction process. The rats showed signs of avoidance learning, not fear, but simply avoiding the area that brought pain to the test rats. The avoidance learning of rats is seen as a conditioned response, and therefore the behavior can be unconditioned, as supported by the earlier research.

Species-specific defense reactions (SSDRs) or avoidance learning in nature is the specific tendency to avoid certain threats or stimuli, it is how animals survive in the wild. Humans and animals both share these species-specific defense reactions, such as the flight-or-fight, which also include pseudo-aggression, fake or intimidating aggression and freeze response to threats, which is controlled by the sympathetic nervous system. These SSDRs are learned very quickly through social interactions between others of the same species, other species, and interaction with the environment. These acquired sets of reactions or responses are not easily forgotten. The animal that survives is the animal that already knows what to fear and how to avoid this threat. An example in humans is the reaction to the sight of a snake, many jump backwards before cognitively realizing what they are jumping away from, and in some cases, it is a stick rather than a snake.

As with many functions of the brain, there are various regions of the brain involved in deciphering fear in humans and other nonhuman species. The amygdala communicates both directions between the prefrontal cortex, hypothalamus, the sensory cortex, the hippocampus, thalamus, septum, and the brainstem. The amygdala plays an important role in SSDR, such as the ventral amygdalofugal, which is essential for associative learning, and SSDRs are learned through interaction with the environment and others of the same species. An emotional response is created only after the signals have been relayed between the different regions of the brain, and activating the sympathetic nervous systems; which controls the flight, fight, freeze, fright, and faint response. Often a damaged amygdala can cause impairment in the recognition of fear (like the human case of patient S.M.). This impairment can cause different species to lack the sensation of fear, and often can become overly confident, confronting larger peers, or walking up to predatory creatures.

Robert C. Bolles (1970), a researcher at University of Washington, wanted to understand species-specific defense reactions and avoidance learning among animals, but found that the theories of avoidance learning and the tools that were used to measure this tendency were out of touch with the natural world. He theorized the species-specific defense reaction (SSDR). There are three forms of SSDRs: flight, fight (pseudo-aggression), or freeze. Even domesticated animals have SSDRs, and in those moments it is seen that animals revert to atavistic standards and become &quot;wild&quot; again. Dr. Bolles states that responses are often dependent on the reinforcement of a safety signal, and not the aversive conditioned stimuli. This safety signal can be a source of feedback or even stimulus change. Intrinsic feedback or information coming from within, muscle twitches, increased heart rate, are seen to be more important in SSDRs than extrinsic feedback, stimuli that comes from the external environment. Dr. Bolles found that most creatures have some intrinsic set of fears, to help assure survival of the species. Rats will run away from any shocking event, and pigeons will flap their wings harder when threatened. The wing flapping in pigeons and the scattered running of rats are considered species-specific defense reactions or behaviors. Bolles believed that SSDRs are conditioned through Pavlovian conditioning, and not operant conditioning; SSDRs arise from the association between the environmental stimuli and adverse events. Michael S. Fanselow conducted an experiment, to test some specific defense reactions, he observed that rats in two different shock situations responded differently, based on instinct or defensive topography, rather than contextual information.

Species-specific defense responses are created out of fear, and are essential for survival. Rats that lack the gene stathmin show no avoidance learning, or a lack of fear, and will often walk directly up to cats and be eaten. Animals use these SSDRs to continue living, to help increase their chance of fitness, by surviving long enough to procreate. Humans and animals alike have created fear to know what should be avoided, and this fear can be learned through association with others in the community, or learned through personal experience with a creature, species, or situations that should be avoided. SSDRs are an evolutionary adaptation that has been seen in many species throughout the world including rats, chimpanzees, prairie dogs, and even humans, an adaptation created to help individual creatures survive in a hostile world.

Fear learning changes across the lifetime due to natural developmental changes in the brain. This includes changes in the prefrontal cortex and the amygdala.

The visual exploration of an emotional face does not follow a fixed pattern but modulated by the emotional content of the face. Scheller et al. found that participants paid more attention to the eyes when recognising fearful or neutral faces, while the mouth was fixated on when happy faces are presented, irrespective of task demands and spatial locations of face stimuli. These findings were replicated when fearful eyes are presented and when canonical face configurations are distorted for fearful, neutral and happy expressions.

===Neurocircuitry in mammals===

* The thalamus collects sensory data from the senses
* Sensory cortex receives data from the thalamus and interprets it
* Sensory cortex organizes information for dissemination to the hypothalamus (fight or flight), amygdalae (fear), hippocampus (memory)

The brain structures that are the center of most neurobiological events associated with fear are the two amygdalae, located behind the pituitary gland. Each amygdala is part of a circuitry of fear learning. They are essential for proper adaptation to stress and specific modulation of emotional learning memory. In the presence of a threatening stimulus, the amygdalae generate the secretion of hormones that influence fear and aggression. Once a response to the stimulus in the form of fear or aggression commences, the amygdalae may elicit the release of hormones into the body to put the person into a state of alertness, in which they are ready to move, run, fight, etc. This defensive response is generally referred to in physiology as the fight-or-flight response regulated by the hypothalamus, part of the limbic system. Once the person is in safe mode, meaning that there are no longer any potential threats surrounding them, the amygdalae will send this information to the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) where it is stored for similar future situations, which is known as memory consolidation.

Some of the hormones involved during the state of fight-or-flight include epinephrine, which regulates heart rate and metabolism as well as dilating blood vessels and air passages, norepinephrine increasing heart rate, blood flow to skeletal muscles and the release of glucose from energy stores, and cortisol which increases blood sugar, increases circulating neutrophilic leukocytes, calcium amongst other things.

After a situation which incites fear occurs, the amygdalae and hippocampus record the event through synaptic plasticity. The stimulation to the hippocampus will cause the individual to remember many details surrounding the situation. Plasticity and memory formation in the amygdala are generated by activation of the neurons in the region. Experimental data supports the notion that synaptic plasticity of the neurons leading to the lateral amygdalae occurs with fear conditioning. In some cases, this forms permanent fear responses such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or a phobia. MRI and fMRI scans have shown that the amygdalae in individuals diagnosed with such disorders including bipolar or panic disorder are larger and wired for a higher level of fear.

Pathogens can suppress amygdala activity. Rats infected with the toxoplasmosis parasite become less fearful of cats, sometimes even seeking out their urine-marked areas. This behavior often leads to them being eaten by cats. The parasite then reproduces within the body of the cat. There is evidence that the parasite concentrates itself in the amygdala of infected rats. In a separate experiment, rats with lesions in the amygdala did not express fear or anxiety towards unwanted stimuli. These rats pulled on levers supplying food that sometimes sent out electrical shocks. While they learned to avoid pressing on them, they did not distance themselves from these shock-inducing levers.

Several brain structures other than the amygdalae have also been observed to be activated when individuals are presented with fearful vs. neutral faces, namely the occipitocerebellar regions including the fusiform gyrus and the inferior parietal / superior temporal gyri. Fearful eyes, brows and mouth seem to separately reproduce these brain responses. Scientists from Zurich studies show that the hormone oxytocin related to stress and sex reduces activity in your brain fear center.

====Pheromones and contagion====
In threatening situations, insects, aquatic organisms, birds, reptiles, and mammals emit odorant substances, initially called alarm substances, which are chemical signals now called alarm pheromones. This is to defend themselves and at the same time to inform members of the same species of danger and leads to observable behavior change like freezing, defensive behavior, or dispersion depending on circumstances and species. For example, stressed rats release odorant cues that cause other rats to move away from the source of the signal.

After the discovery of pheromones in 1959, alarm pheromones were first described in 1968 in ants and earthworms, and four years later also found in mammals, both mice and rats. Over the next two decades, identification and characterization of these pheromones proceeded in all manner of insects and sea animals, including fish, but it was not until 1990 that more insight into mammalian alarm pheromones was gleaned.

In 1985, a link between odors released by stressed rats and pain perception was discovered: unstressed rats exposed to these odors developed opioid-mediated analgesia. In 1997, researchers found that bees became less responsive to pain after they had been stimulated with isoamyl acetate, a chemical smelling of banana, and a component of bee alarm pheromone. The experiment also showed that the bees&#x27; fear-induced pain tolerance was mediated by an endorphin.

By using the forced swimming test in rats as a model of fear-induction, the first mammalian &quot;alarm substance&quot; was found. In 1991, this &quot;alarm substance&quot; was shown to fulfill criteria for pheromones: well-defined behavioral effect, species specificity, minimal influence of experience and control for nonspecific arousal. Rat activity testing with the alarm pheromone, and their preference/avoidance for odors from cylinders containing the pheromone, showed that the pheromone had very low volatility.

In 1993 a connection between alarm chemosignals in mice and their immune response was found. Pheromone production in mice was found to be associated with or mediated by the pituitary gland in 1994.

In 2004, it was demonstrated that rats&#x27; alarm pheromones had different effects on the &quot;recipient&quot; rat (the rat perceiving the pheromone) depending which body region they were released from: Pheromone production from the face modified behavior in the recipient rat, e.g. caused sniffing or movement, whereas pheromone secreted from the rat&#x27;s anal area induced autonomic nervous system stress responses, like an increase in core body temperature. Further experiments showed that when a rat perceived alarm pheromones, it increased its defensive and risk assessment behavior, and its acoustic startle reflex was enhanced.

It was not until 2011 that a link between severe pain, neuroinflammation and alarm pheromones release in rats was found: real time RT-PCR analysis of rat brain tissues indicated that shocking the footpad of a rat increased its production of proinflammatory cytokines in deep brain structures, namely of IL-1β, heteronuclear Corticotropin-releasing hormone and c-fos mRNA expressions in both the paraventricular nucleus and the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, and it increased stress hormone levels in plasma (corticosterone).

The neurocircuit for how rats perceive alarm pheromones was shown to be related to the hypothalamus, brainstem, and amygdalae, all of which are evolutionary ancient structures deep inside or in the case of the brainstem underneath the brain away from the cortex, and involved in the fight-or-flight response, as is the case in humans.

Alarm pheromone-induced anxiety in rats has been used to evaluate the degree to which anxiolytics can alleviate anxiety in humans. For this, the change in the acoustic startle reflex of rats with alarm pheromone-induced anxiety (i.e. reduction of defensiveness) has been measured. Pretreatment of rats with one of five anxiolytics used in clinical medicine was able to reduce their anxiety: namely midazolam, phenelzine (a nonselective monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor), propranolol, a nonselective beta blocker, clonidine, an alpha 2 adrenergic agonist or CP-154,526, a corticotropin-releasing hormone antagonist.

Faulty development of odor discrimination impairs the perception of pheromones and pheromone-related behavior, like aggressive behavior and mating in male rats: The enzyme Mitogen-activated protein kinase 7 (MAPK7) has been implicated in regulating the development of the olfactory bulb and odor discrimination and it is highly expressed in developing rat brains, but absent in most regions of adult rat brains. Conditional deletion of the MAPK7gene in mouse neural stem cells impairs several pheromone-mediated behaviors, including aggression and mating in male mice. These behavior impairments were not caused by a reduction in the level of testosterone, by physical immobility, by heightened fear or anxiety or by depression. Using mouse urine as a natural pheromone-containing solution, it has been shown that the impairment was associated with defective detection of related pheromones, and with changes in their inborn preference for pheromones related to sexual and reproductive activities.

Lastly, alleviation of an acute fear response because a friendly peer (or in biological language: an affiliative conspecific) tends and befriends is called &quot;social buffering&quot;. The term is in analogy to the 1985 &quot;buffering&quot; hypothesis in psychology, where social support has been proven to mitigate the negative health effects of alarm pheromone mediated distress. The role of a &quot;social pheromone&quot; is suggested by the recent discovery that olfactory signals are responsible in mediating the &quot;social buffering&quot; in male rats. &quot;Social buffering&quot; was also observed to mitigate the conditioned fear responses of honeybees. A bee colony exposed to an environment of high threat of predation did not show increased aggression and aggressive-like gene expression patterns in individual bees, but decreased aggression. That the bees did not simply habituate to threats is suggested by the fact that the disturbed colonies also decreased their foraging.

Biologists have proposed in 2012 that fear pheromones evolved as molecules of &quot;keystone significance&quot;, a term coined in analogy to keystone species. Pheromones may determine species compositions and affect rates of energy and material exchange in an ecological community. Thus pheromones generate structure in a food web and play critical roles in maintaining natural systems.

====Humans====
Evidence of chemosensory alarm signals in humans has emerged slowly: Although alarm pheromones have not been physically isolated and their chemical structures have not been identified in humans so far, there is evidence for their presence. Androstadienone, for example, a steroidal, endogenous odorant, is a pheromone candidate found in human sweat, axillary hair and plasma. The closely related compound androstenone is involved in communicating dominance, aggression or competition; sex hormone influences on androstenone perception in humans showed a high testosterone level related to heightened androstenone sensitivity in men, a high testosterone level related to unhappiness in response to androstenone in men, and a high estradiol level related to disliking of androstenone in women.

A German study from 2006 showed when anxiety-induced versus exercise-induced human sweat from a dozen people was pooled and offered to seven study participants, of five able to olfactorily distinguish exercise-induced sweat from room air, three could also distinguish exercise-induced sweat from anxiety induced sweat. The acoustic startle reflex response to a sound when sensing anxiety sweat was larger than when sensing exercise-induced sweat, as measured by electromyography analysis of the orbital muscle, which is responsible for the eyeblink component. This showed for the first time that fear chemosignals can modulate the startle reflex in humans without emotional mediation; fear chemosignals primed the recipient&#x27;s &quot;defensive behavior&quot; prior to the subjects&#x27; conscious attention on the acoustic startle reflex level.

In analogy to the social buffering of rats and honeybees in response to chemosignals, induction of empathy by &quot;smelling anxiety&quot; of another person has been found in humans.

A study from 2013 provided brain imaging evidence that human responses to fear chemosignals may be gender-specific. Researchers collected alarm-induced sweat and exercise-induced sweat from donors extracted it, pooled it and presented it to 16 unrelated people undergoing functional brain MRI. While stress-induced sweat from males produced a comparably strong emotional response in both females and males, stress-induced sweat from females produced markedly stronger arousal in women than in men. Statistical tests pinpointed this gender-specificity to the right amygdala and strongest in the superficial nuclei. Since no significant differences were found in the olfactory bulb, the response to female fear-induced signals is likely based on processing the meaning, i.e. on the emotional level, rather than the strength of chemosensory cues from each gender, i.e. the perceptual level.

An approach-avoidance task was set up where volunteers seeing either an angry or a happy cartoon face on a computer screen pushed away or pulled toward them a joystick as fast as possible. Volunteers smelling androstadienone, masked with clove oil scent responded faster, especially to angry faces than those smelling clove oil only, which was interpreted as androstadienone-related activation of the fear system. A potential mechanism of action is, that androstadienone alters the &quot;emotional face processing&quot;. Androstadienone is known to influence the activity of the fusiform gyrus which is relevant for face recognition.

===Cognitive-consistency theory===
Cognitive-consistency theories assume that &quot;when two or more simultaneously active cognitive structures are logically inconsistent, arousal is increased, which activates processes with the expected consequence of increasing consistency and decreasing arousal.&quot; In this context, it has been proposed that fear behavior is caused by an inconsistency between a preferred, or expected, situation and the actually perceived situation, and functions to remove the inconsistent stimulus from the perceptual field, for instance by fleeing or hiding, thereby resolving the inconsistency. This approach puts fear in a broader perspective, also involving aggression and curiosity. When the inconsistency between perception and expectancy is small, learning as a result of curiosity reduces inconsistency by updating expectancy to match perception. If the inconsistency is larger, fear or aggressive behavior may be employed to alter the perception in order to make it match expectancy, depending on the size of the inconsistency as well as the specific context. Aggressive behavior is assumed to alter perception by forcefully manipulating it into matching the expected situation, while in some cases thwarted escape may also trigger aggressive behavior in an attempt to remove the thwarting stimulus.

==Research==
In order to improve our understanding of the neural and behavioral mechanisms of adaptive and maladaptive fear, investigators use a variety of translational animal models. These models are particularly important for research that would be too invasive for human studies. Rodents such as mice and rats are common animal models, but other species are used. Certain aspects of fear research still requires more research such as sex, gender, and age differences.

===Models===
These animal models include, but are not limited to, fear conditioning, predator-based psychosocial stress, single prolonged stress, chronic stress models, inescapable foot/tail shocks, immobilization or restraint, and stress enhanced fear learning. While the stress and fear paradigms differ between the models, they tend to involve aspects such as acquisition, generalization, extinction, cognitive regulation, and reconsolidation.

==== Pavlovian ====
Fear conditioning, also known as Pavlovian or classical conditioning, is a process of learning that involves pairing a neutral stimulus with an unconditional stimulus (US). A neutral stimulus is something like a bell, tone, or room that does not elicit a response normally where a US is a stimulus that results in a natural or unconditioned response (UR) – in Pavlov&#x27;s famous experiment the neutral stimulus is a bell and the US would be food with the dog&#x27;s salvation being the UR. Pairing the neutral stimulus and the US results in the UR occurring not only with the US but also the neutral stimulus. When this occurs the neutral stimulus is referred to as the conditional stimulus (CS) and the response the conditional response (CR). In the fear conditioning model of Pavlovian conditioning the US is an aversive stimulus such as a shock, tone, or unpleasant odor.

==== Predator-based psychosocial stress ====
Predator-based psychosocial stress (PPS) involves a more naturalistic approach to fear learning. Predators such as a cat, a snake, or urine from a fox or cat are used along with other stressors such as immobilization or restraint in order to generate instinctual fear responses.

==== Chronic stress models ====
Chronic stress models include chronic variable stress, chronic social defeat, and chronic mild stress. These models are often used to study how long-term or prolonged stress/pain can alter fear learning and disorders.

==== Single prolonged stress ====
Single prolonged stress (SPS) is a fear model that is often used to study PTSD. Its paradigm involves multiple stressors such as immobilization, a force swim, and exposure to ether delivered concurrently to the subject. This is used to study non-naturalistic, uncontrollable situations that can cause a maladaptive fear responses that is seen in a lot of anxiety and traumatic based disorders.

==== Stress enhanced fear learning ====
Stress enhanced fear learning (SEFL) like SPS is often used to study the maladaptive fear learning involved in PTSD and other traumatic based disorders. SEFL involves a single extreme stressor such as a large number of footshocks simulating a single traumatic stressor that somehow enhances and alters future fear learning.

==Management==

===Pharmaceutical===
A drug treatment for fear conditioning and phobias via the amygdalae is the use of glucocorticoids. In one study, glucocorticoid receptors in the central nuclei of the amygdalae were disrupted in order to better understand the mechanisms of fear and fear conditioning. The glucocorticoid receptors were inhibited using lentiviral vectors containing Cre-recombinase injected into mice. Results showed that disruption of the glucocorticoid receptors prevented conditioned fear behavior. The mice were subjected to auditory cues which caused them to freeze normally. A reduction of freezing was observed in the mice that had inhibited glucocorticoid receptors.

=== Psychological ===
Cognitive behavioral therapy has been successful in helping people overcome their fear. Because fear is more complex than just forgetting or deleting memories, an active and successful approach involves people repeatedly confronting their fears. By confronting their fears in a safe manner a person can suppress the &quot;fear-triggering memories&quot; or stimuli.

Exposure therapy has known to have helped up to 90% of people with specific phobias to significantly decrease their fear over time.

Another psychological treatment is systematic desensitization, which is a type of behavior therapy used to completely remove the fear or produce a disgusted response to this fear and replace it. The replacement that occurs will be relaxation and will occur through conditioning. Through conditioning treatments, muscle tensioning will lessen and deep breathing techniques will aid in de-tensioning.

=== Literary and religious ===
There are other methods for treating or coping with one&#x27;s fear, such as writing down rational thoughts regarding fears. Journal entries are a healthy method of expressing one&#x27;s fears without compromising safety or causing uncertainty. Another suggestion is a fear ladder. To create a fear ladder, one must write down all of their fears and score them on a scale of one to ten. Next, the person addresses their phobia, starting with the lowest number.

Religion can help some individuals cope with fear.

==Incapability==

People who have damage to their amygdalae, which can be caused by a rare genetic disease known as Urbach–Wiethe disease, are unable to experience fear. The disease destroys both amygdalae in late childhood. Since the discovery of the disease, there have only been 400 recorded cases. A lack of fear can allow someone to get into a dangerous situation they otherwise would have avoided.

==Society and culture==
=== Death ===

The fear of the end of life and its existence is, in other words, the fear of death. Historically, attempts were made to reduce this fear by performing rituals which have helped collect the cultural ideas that we now have in the present. These rituals also helped preserve the cultural ideas. The results and methods of human existence had been changing at the same time that social formation was changing.

When people are faced with their own thoughts of death, they either accept that they are dying or will die because they have lived a full life or they will experience fear. A theory was developed in response to this, which is called the terror management theory. The theory states that a person&#x27;s cultural worldviews (religion, values, etc.) will mitigate the terror associated with the fear of death through avoidance. To help manage their terror, they find solace in their death-denying beliefs, such as their religion. Another way people cope with their death related fears is pushing any thoughts of death into the future or by avoiding these thoughts all together through distractions. Although there are methods for one coping with the terror associated with their fear of death, not everyone suffers from these same uncertainties. People who believe they have lived life to the &quot;fullest&quot; typically do not fear death.

Death anxiety is multidimensional; it covers &quot;fears related to one&#x27;s own death, the death of others, fear of the unknown after death, fear of obliteration, and fear of the dying process, which includes fear of a slow death and a painful death&quot;.

The Yale philosopher Shelly Kagan examined fear of death in a 2007 Yale open course by examining the following questions: Is fear of death a reasonable appropriate response? What conditions are required and what are appropriate conditions for feeling fear of death? What is meant by fear, and how much fear is appropriate? According to Kagan for fear in general to make sense, three conditions should be met:

# the object of fear needs to be &quot;something bad&quot;
# there needs to be a non-negligible chance that the bad state of affairs will happen
# there needs to be some uncertainty about the bad state of affairs

The amount of fear should be appropriate to the size of &quot;the bad&quot;. If the three conditions are not met, fear is an inappropriate emotion. He argues, that death does not meet the first two criteria, even if death is a &quot;deprivation of good things&quot; and even if one believes in a painful afterlife. Because death is certain, it also does not meet the third criterion, but he grants that the unpredictability of when one dies &quot;may&quot; be cause to a sense of fear.

In a 2003 study of 167 women and 121 men, aged 65–87, low self-efficacy predicted fear of the unknown after death and fear of dying for women and men better than demographics, social support, and physical health. Fear of death was measured by a &quot;Multidimensional Fear of Death Scale&quot; which included the 8 subscales Fear of Dying, Fear of the Dead, Fear of Being Destroyed, Fear for Significant Others, Fear of the Unknown, Fear of Conscious Death, Fear for the Body After Death, and Fear of Premature Death. In hierarchical multiple regression analysis, the most potent predictors of death fears were low &quot;spiritual health efficacy&quot;, defined as beliefs relating to one&#x27;s perceived ability to generate spiritually based faith and inner strength, and low &quot;instrumental efficacy&quot;, defined as beliefs relating to one&#x27;s perceived ability to manage activities of daily living.

Psychologists have tested the hypotheses that fear of death motivates religious commitment, and that assurances about an afterlife alleviate the fear, with equivocal results. Religiosity can be related to fear of death when the afterlife is portrayed as time of punishment. &quot;Intrinsic religiosity&quot;, as opposed to mere &quot;formal religious involvement&quot;, has been found to be negatively correlated with death anxiety. In a 1976 study of people of various Christian denominations, those who were most firm in their faith, who attended religious services weekly, were the least afraid of dying. The survey found a negative correlation between fear of death and &quot;religious concern&quot;.

In a 2006 study of white, Christian men and women the hypothesis was tested that traditional, church-centered religiousness and de-institutionalized spiritual seeking are ways of approaching fear of death in old age. Both religiousness and spirituality were related to positive psychosocial functioning, but only church-centered religiousness protected subjects against the fear of death.

=== Religion ===
Statius in the &quot;Thebaid&quot; (Book 3, line 661) aired the irreverent suggestion that &quot;fear first made gods in the world&quot;.

From a Christian theological perspective, the word &quot;fear&quot; can encompass more than simple dread. Robert B. Strimple says that fear includes the &quot;... convergence of awe, reverence, adoration, humility..&quot;. Some translations of the Bible, such as the New International Version, sometimes express the concept of &quot;fear&quot; with the word &quot;reverence&quot;.

A similar phrase, &quot;God-fearing&quot;, is sometimes used as a rough synonym for &quot;pious&quot;. It is a standard translation for the Arabic word taqwa (; &quot;forbearance, restraint&quot;) in Muslim contexts. In Judaism, &quot;fear of God&quot; describes obedience to Jewish law even when invisible to others.

=== Manipulation ===

Fear may be politically and culturally manipulated to persuade citizenry of ideas which would otherwise be widely rejected or dissuade citizenry from ideas which would otherwise be widely supported. In contexts of disasters, nation-states manage the fear not only to provide their citizens with an explanation about the event or blaming some minorities, but also to adjust their previous beliefs.

Fear can alter how a person thinks or reacts to situations because fear has the power to inhibit one&#x27;s rational way of thinking. As a result, people who do not experience fear, are able to use fear as a tool to manipulate others. People who are experiencing fear, seek preservation through safety and can be manipulated by a person who is there to provide that safety that is being sought after. &quot;When we&#x27;re afraid, a manipulator can talk us out of the truth we see right in front of us. Words become more real than reality&quot; By this, a manipulator can use our fear to manipulate us out the truth and instead make us believe and trust in their truth. Politicians are notorious for using fear to manipulate the people into supporting their policies. This strategy taps into primal human emotions, leveraging fear of the unknown, external threats, or perceived dangers to influence decision-making.

=== Fiction and mythology ===
Fear is found and reflected in mythology and folklore as well as in works of fiction such as novels and films.

Works of dystopian and (post)apocalyptic fiction convey the fears and anxieties of societies.

The fear of the world&#x27;s end is about as old as civilization itself. In a 1967 study, Frank Kermode suggests that the failure of religious prophecies led to a shift in how society apprehends this ancient mode. Scientific and critical thought supplanting religious and mythical thought as well as a public emancipation may be the cause of eschatology becoming replaced by more realistic scenarios. Such might constructively provoke discussion and steps to be taken to prevent depicted catastrophes.

&quot;The Story of the Youth Who Went Forth to Learn What Fear Was&quot; is a German fairy tale dealing with the topic of not knowing fear.
Many stories also include characters who fear the antagonist of the plot. One important characteristic of historical and mythical heroes across cultures is to be fearless in the face of big and often lethal enemies.

&quot;The Magnus Archives&quot; is a fiction horror podcast written by Jonathan Sims and directed by Alexander J. Newall that, among other things, formulates an archetypal ontology of fear through the dissemination of case files at a paranormal research institute set in a world where the metaphysical basis of paranormal activity and unexplainable horrors is fear incarnate. The diegesis states that true categorization of fear is impossible, that fear is all one unknowable thing; however, there exists an ontological structure of fear archetypes in this universe proposed by a fictional version of the architect Robert Smirke. It is a unique construction of fear in that it is not based on the science or neurology of fear, but on thematic and experiential connections between different phobias. For example, the fear of disease and vermin comes from the same place as the fear of abusive relationships, as both lie in fearing corruptions to the self. The final season of the podcast consists almost entirely of poetic meditations on the nature of fear.

Fear in art has been explored by the Japanese scholar Kyoko Nakano, in a series of books and a 2017 exhibition about &quot;kowai-e&quot; (lit. scary pictures).

=== Athletics ===
In the world of athletics, fear is often used as a means of motivation to not fail. This situation involves using fear in a way that increases the chances of a positive outcome. In this case, the fear that is being created is initially a cognitive state to the receiver. This initial state is what generates the first response of the athlete, this response generates a possibility of fight or flight reaction by the athlete (receiver), which in turn will increase or decrease the possibility of success or failure in the certain situation for the athlete. The amount of time that the athlete has to determine this decision is small but it is still enough time for the receiver to make a determination through cognition. Even though the decision is made quickly, the decision is determined through past events that have been experienced by the athlete. The results of these past events will determine how the athlete will make his cognitive decision in the split second that he or she has.

Fear of failure as described above has been studied frequently in the field of sport psychology. Many scholars have tried to determine how often fear of failure is triggered within athletes, as well as what personalities of athletes most often choose to use this type of motivation. Studies have also been conducted to determine the success rate of this method of motivation.

Murray&#x27;s Exploration in Personal (1938) was one of the first studies that actually identified fear of failure as an actual motive to avoid failure or to achieve success. His studies suggested that inavoidance, the need to avoid failure, was found in many college-aged men during the time of his research in 1938. This was a monumental finding in the field of psychology because it allowed other researchers to better clarify how fear of failure can actually be a determinant of creating achievement goals as well as how it could be used in the actual act of achievement.

In the context of sport, a model was created by R.S. Lazarus in 1991 that uses the cognitive-motivational-relational theory of emotion. 
Another study was done in 2001 by Conroy, Poczwardowski, and Henschen that created five aversive consequences of failing that have been repeated over time. The five categories include (a) experiencing shame and embarrassment, (b) devaluing one&#x27;s self-estimate, (c) having an uncertain future, (d) important others losing interest, (e) upsetting important others. These five categories can help one infer the possibility of an individual to associate failure with one of these threat categories, which will lead them to experiencing fear of failure.

In summary, the two studies that were done above created a more precise definition of fear of failure, which is &quot;a dispositional tendency to experience apprehension and anxiety in evaluative situations because individuals have learned that failure is associated with aversive consequences&quot;.

The author and internet content creator John Green wrote about “the yips”—a common colloquialism for a debilitating, often chronic manifestation of athletic anxiety experienced by some professional athletes—in an essay for his podcast and novel &quot;The Anthropocene Reviewed&quot;. Green discusses famous examples of when athletic anxiety has ruined careers and juxtaposes it with the nature of general anxiety as a whole. Green settles, however, on a conclusion for the essay evoking resilience and hope in the human condition by describing a circumstance where the baseball player Rick Ankiel reset his career back to the minor leagues as an outfielder after getting the yips as a major league pitcher.

<text>A football team is a group of players selected to play together in the various team sports known as football. Such teams could be selected to play in a match against an opposing team, to represent a football club, group, state or nation, an all-star team or even selected as a hypothetical team (such as a or team of the century) and never play an actual match.

The difference between a football team and a football club is incorporation, a football club is an entity which is formed and governed by a committee and has members which may consist of supporters in addition to players. The benefit of club formation is that it gives teams access to additional volunteer or paid support staff, facilities and equipment. 

==Summary==
There are several varieties of football, including association football, gridiron football, Australian rules football, Gaelic football, rugby league and rugby union. The number of players selected for each team, within these varieties and their associated codes, can vary substantially. Sometimes, the word &quot;team&quot; may be limited to those who play on the field in a match and does not always include other players who may take part as replacements or emergency players. &quot;Football squad&quot; may be used to be inclusive of these support and reserve players.

The words team and club are sometimes used interchangeably by supporters, typically referring to the team within the club playing in the highest division or competition. A football club is a type of sports club which is an organized or incorporated body. Typically these will have a committee, secretary, president, or chairperson, registrar and members. Football clubs typically have a set of rules, including rules under which they play and are themselves typically members of a league or association which are affiliated with a governing body within their sport. Clubs may field multiple teams from their registered players (which may participate in several different divisions or leagues). A club is responsible for ensuring the continued existence of its teams in their respective competitions. The oldest football clubs date back to the early 19th century. While records exist for most incorporated clubs, they do not exist for all football clubs. Standalone clubs are usually run like businesses and appear on official registers. However many football clubs were formed as part of larger organisations (schools, athletic clubs, societies) and therefore public records of their formation and operation may not be kept unless they compete with other teams. Football clubs may also be dormant for periods and be re-formed (for example going into recess for reasons such as war or lack of a league or competition to participate in) and even switch between football codes. Likewise, a football club may fold if it becomes insolvent or is incapable of fielding a team to play matches.

==Variation of player numbers among football codes==

The number of players that take part in the sport simultaneously, thus forming the team are:

*Association football: 11
**Seven-a-side football:7
**Indoor soccer: 5–7
**Futsal, beach football, five-a-side football: 5
*American football: 11
**Arena football: 8
*Canadian football: 12
*Rugby league: 13
**Rugby league nines: 9
*Rugby union: 15
**Rugby sevens: 7
*Gaelic football: 15
*Australian rules football: 18

<text>F, or f, is the sixth letter of the Latin alphabet and many modern alphabets influenced by it, including the modern English alphabet and the alphabets of all other modern western European languages. Its name in English is &quot;ef&quot; (pronounced ), and the plural is &quot;efs&quot;.

== History ==
The origin of ⟨F⟩ is the Semitic letter &quot;waw&quot;, which represented a sound like or . It probably originally depicted either a hook or a club. It may have been based on a comparable Egyptian hieroglyph such as that which represented the word &quot;mace&quot; (transliterated as ḥ(dj)): T3

The Phoenician form of the letter was adopted into Greek as a vowel, &quot;upsilon&quot; (which resembled its descendant ⟨Y⟩ but was also the ancestor of the Roman letters ⟨U⟩, ⟨V⟩, and ⟨W⟩); and, with another form, as a consonant, &quot;digamma&quot;, which indicated the pronunciation , as in Phoenician. Latin ⟨F⟩, despite being pronounced differently, is ultimately descended from digamma and closely resembles it in form.

After sound changes eliminated from most dialects of Greek (Doric Greek retained it), &quot;digamma&quot; was used only as a numeral. However, the Greek alphabet also gave rise to other alphabets, and some of these retained letters descended from digamma. In the Etruscan alphabet, ⟨F⟩ probably represented , as in Greek, and the Etruscans formed the digraph ⟨FH⟩ to represent . (At the time these letters were borrowed, there was no Greek letter that represented /f/: the Greek letter phi ⟨Φ⟩ then represented an aspirated voiceless bilabial plosive , although in Modern Greek it has come to represent .) The Etruscan digraph may have been inspired by the rare use of ⟨ϜΗ⟩ in archaic Greek inscriptions for a dialectal sound like , e.g. in the reflexive pronoun ϜΗΕ, which corresponds to Classical ἕ &quot;hé&quot;. When the Romans adopted the alphabet, they used ⟨V⟩ (from Greek &quot;upsilon&quot;) not only for the vowel , but also for the corresponding semivowel , leaving ⟨F⟩ available for . Initially, ⟨FH⟩ was also used for this sound in Latin, but the ⟨H⟩ was soon dropped. And so out of the various &quot;vav&quot; variants in the Mediterranean world, the letter F entered the Roman alphabet attached to a sound which the Greeks did not have. The Roman alphabet forms the basis of the alphabet used today for English and many other languages.

The lowercase ⟨f⟩ is not related to the visually similar long s, ⟨ſ⟩ (or medial s). The use of the &quot;long s&quot; largely died out by the beginning of the 19th century, mostly to prevent confusion with ⟨f⟩ when using a short mid-bar.

== Use in writing systems ==
=== English ===
In the English writing system is used to represent the sound , the voiceless labiodental fricative. It is often doubled at the end of words. Exceptionally, it represents the voiced labiodental fricative in the common word &quot;of&quot; and its derivatives.

F is the eleventh least frequently used letter in the English language (after G, Y, P, B, V, K, J, X, Q, and Z), with a frequency of about 2.23% in words.

=== Other languages ===
In the writing systems of other languages, commonly represents , or .
* In French orthography, is used to represent . It may also be silent at the end of words.
* In Spanish orthography, is used to represent . 
* In Esperanto orthography, is used to represent . 
* In the Hepburn romanization of Japanese, is used to represent . This sound is usually considered to be an allophone of , which is pronounced in different ways depending upon its context; Japanese is pronounced as before .
* In Welsh orthography, represents while represents .
* In Slavic languages, is used primarily in words of foreign (Hellenic, Romance, or Germanic) origin.
* In spoken Icelandic, in the middle of a word is often voiced to (e.g., Að sofa – to sleep).

=== Other systems ===
The International Phonetic Alphabet uses to represent the voiceless labiodental fricative.

== Other uses ==

* In the hexadecimal (base 16) numbering system, F is a number that corresponds to the number 15 in decimal (base 10) counting.
* The italic letter is conventionally used to denote an arbitrary function. Closely on f with hook (ƒ).
* A bold italic letter is used in musical notation as a dynamic indicator for &quot;loud or strong&quot;. It stands for the Italian word &quot;forte&quot;.
* In countries such as the United States, the letter &quot;F&quot; is defined as a failure in terms of academic evaluation. Other countries that use this system include Saudi Arabia, Venezuela, and the Netherlands.
* The letter F has become an Internet meme, where it is used to pay respects. This use is derived from the 2014 video game &quot;Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare&quot;, where in a quick-time event, protagonist Jack Mitchell must pay his respects to his friend Will Irons who fell in combat in a previous mission, represented by the player pressing F when playing the PC version. People on the Internet use the letter F sometimes in a genuine way to express respect, sadness, or condolences towards other Internet personalities, Internet memes, or other players on certain events.

<text>Food preservation includes processes that make food more resistant to microorganism growth and slow the oxidation of fats. This slows down the decomposition and rancidification process. Food preservation may also include processes that inhibit visual deterioration, such as the enzymatic browning reaction in apples after they are cut during food preparation. By preserving food, food waste can be reduced, which is an important way to decrease production costs and increase the efficiency of food systems, improve food security and nutrition and contribute towards environmental sustainability. For instance, it can reduce the environmental impact of food production.

Many processes designed to preserve food involve more than one food preservation method. Preserving fruit by turning it into jam, for example, involves boiling (to reduce the fruit&#x27;s moisture content and to kill bacteria, etc.), sugaring (to prevent their re-growth) and sealing within an airtight jar (to prevent recontamination).

Different food preservation methods have different impacts on the quality of the food and food systems. Some traditional methods of preserving food have been shown to have a lower energy input and carbon footprint compared to modern methods. Some methods of food preservation are also known to create carcinogens.

== Traditional techniques ==
Some techniques of food preservation pre-date the dawn of agriculture. Others were discovered more recently.

=== Boiling ===
Boiling liquids can kill any existing microbes. Milk and water are often boiled to kill any harmful microbes that may be present in them.

=== Burial ===
Burial of food can preserve it due to a variety of factors: lack of light, lack of oxygen, cool temperatures, pH level, or desiccants in the soil. Burial may be combined with other methods such as salting or fermentation. Most foods can be preserved in soil that is very dry and salty (thus a desiccant) such as sand, or soil that is frozen.

Many root vegetables are very resistant to spoilage and require no other preservation than storage in cool dark conditions, for example by burial in the ground, such as in a storage clamp (not to be confused with a root cellar). Cabbage was traditionally buried during autumn in northern US farms for preservation. Some methods keep it crispy while other methods produce sauerkraut. A similar process is used in the traditional production of kimchi.

Sometimes meat is buried under conditions that cause preservation. If buried on hot coals or ashes, the heat can kill pathogens, the dry ash can desiccate, and the earth can block oxygen and further contamination. If buried where the earth is very cold, the earth acts like a refrigerator, or, in areas of permafrost, a freezer.

In Odisha, India, it is practical to store rice by burying it underground. This method helps to store for three to six months during the dry season.

Butter and similar substances have been preserved as bog butter in Irish peat bogs for centuries. Century eggs are traditionally created by placing eggs in alkaline mud (or other alkaline substance), resulting in their &quot;inorganic&quot; fermentation through raised pH instead of spoiling. The fermentation preserves them and breaks down some of the complex, less flavorful proteins and fats into simpler, more flavorful ones.

=== Canning ===

Canning involves cooking food, sealing it in sterilized cans or jars, and boiling the containers to kill or weaken any remaining bacteria as a form of sterilization. It was invented by the French confectioner Nicolas Appert. By 1806, this process was used by the French Navy to preserve meat, fruit, vegetables, and even milk. Although Appert had discovered a new way of preservation, it was not understood until 1864 when Louis Pasteur found the relationship between microorganisms, food spoilage, and illness.

Foods have varying degrees of natural protection against spoilage and may require that the final step occurs in a pressure cooker. High-acid fruits like strawberries require no preservatives to can and only a short boiling cycle, whereas marginal vegetables such as carrots require longer boiling and the addition of other acidic elements. Low-acid foods, such as vegetables and meats, require pressure canning. Food preserved by canning or bottling is at immediate risk of spoilage once the can or bottle has been opened.

Lack of quality control in the canning process may allow ingress of water or micro-organisms. Most such failures are rapidly detected as decomposition within the can cause gas production and the can will swell or burst. However, there have been examples of poor manufacture (underprocessing) and poor hygiene allowing contamination of canned food by the obligate anaerobe &quot;Clostridium botulinum&quot;, which produces an acute toxin within the food, leading to severe illness or death. This organism produces no gas or obvious taste and remains undetected by taste or smell. Its toxin is denatured by cooking, however. Cooked mushrooms, when handled poorly and then canned, can support the growth of &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot;, which produces a toxin that is not destroyed by canning or subsequent reheating.

=== Confit ===

Meat can be preserved by salting it, cooking it at or near in some kind of fat (such as lard or tallow), and then storing it immersed in the fat. These preparations were popular in Europe before refrigerators became ubiquitous. They are still popular in France, where the term originates. The preparation will keep longer if stored in a cold cellar or buried in cold ground.

=== Cooling ===

Cooling preserves food by slowing down the growth and reproduction of microorganisms and the action of enzymes that causes the food to rot. The introduction of commercial and domestic refrigerators drastically improved the diets of many in the Western world by allowing food such as fresh fruit, salads and dairy products to be stored safely for longer periods, particularly during warm weather.

Before the era of mechanical refrigeration, cooling for food storage occurred in the forms of root cellars and iceboxes. Rural people often did their own ice cutting, whereas town and city dwellers often relied on the ice trade. Today, root cellaring remains popular among people who value various goals, including local food, heirloom crops, traditional home cooking techniques, family farming, frugality, self-sufficiency, organic farming, and others.

=== Aging of wine ===
In the recent years such PEF techniques are utilised in the artificial aging of red wines, i.e. by utising wood chips.

=== Curing ===
The earliest form of curing was dehydration or drying, used as early as 12,000BC. Smoking and salting techniques improve on the drying process and add antimicrobial agents that aid in preservation. Smoke deposits a number of pyrolysis products onto the food, including the phenols syringol, guaiacol and catechol. Salt accelerates the drying process using osmosis and also inhibits the growth of several common strains of bacteria. More recently nitrites have been used to cure meat, contributing a characteristic pink colour.

In 2015, the International Agency for Research on Cancer of the World Health Organization classified processed meat—i.e., meat that has undergone salting, curing, and smoking—as &quot;carcinogenic to humans&quot;.

=== Fermentation ===

Some foods, such as many cheeses, wines, and beers, are prepared by fermentation. This involves cultivating specific microorganisms to combat spoilage from other, less benign organisms. These microorganisms keep pathogens in check by producing acid or alcohol, which eventually creates an environment toxic for themselves and other microorganisms.

Methods of fermentation include, but are not limited to, starter microorganisms, salt, hops, controlled (usually cool) temperatures and controlled (usually low) levels of oxygen. These methods are used to create the specific controlled conditions that will support the desirable organisms that produce food fit for human consumption. Fermentation is the microbial conversion of starch and sugars into alcohol. Not only can fermentation produce alcohol, but it can also be a valuable preservation technique. Fermentation can also make foods more nutritious and palatable.

Water was also turned into alcoholic beverages through fermentation. When water is used to make beer, the boiling during the brewing process may kill bacteria that could make people sick. The barley and other ingredients also infuse the drink with nutrients, and the microorganisms can also produce vitamins as they ferment. However, the common belief that premodern people avoided drinking ordinary water is a myth. While people avoided drinking dirty or polluted water, they also avoided using it for the production of beer and wine. Water was visually inspected, smelled, tasted, filtered, and boiled if necessary. It was used for drinking as well as for diluting wine, cooking, and many other processes.

=== Freezing ===

Freezing is also one of the most commonly used processes, both commercially and domestically, for preserving a very wide range of foods, including prepared foods that would not have required freezing in their unprepared state. For example, potato waffles are stored in the freezer, but potatoes themselves require only a cool dark place to ensure many months&#x27; storage. Cold stores provide large-volume, long-term storage for strategic food stocks held in case of national emergency in many countries.

=== Heating ===
Heating to temperatures which are sufficient to kill microorganisms inside the food is a method used with perpetual stews.

=== Jellying ===
Food may be preserved by cooking in a material that solidifies to form a gel. Such materials include gelatin, agar, maize flour, and arrowroot flour.

Some animal flesh forms a protein gel when cooked. Eels and elvers, and sipunculid worms, are a delicacy in Xiamen, China, as are jellied eels in the East End of London, where they are eaten with mashed potatoes. British cuisine has a rich tradition of potted meats. Meat off-cuts were, until the 1950s, preserved in aspic, a gel made from gelatin and clarified meat broth. Another form of preservation is setting the cooked food in a container and covering it with a layer of fat. Potted chicken liver can be prepared in this way, and so can potted shrimps, to be served on toast. Calf&#x27;s foot jelly used to be prepared for invalids.

Jellying is one of the steps in producing traditional pâtés. Many jugged meats (see below) are also jellied.

Another type of jellying is fruit preserves, which are preparations of cooked fruits, vegetables and sugar, often stored in glass jam jars and Mason jars. Many varieties of fruit preserves are made globally, including sweet fruit preserves, such as those made from strawberry or apricot, and savory preserves, such as those made from tomatoes or squash. The ingredients used and how they are prepared determine the type of preserves; jams, jellies, and marmalades are all examples of different styles of fruit preserves that vary based upon the fruit used. In English, the word &quot;preserves&quot;, in plural form, is used to describe all types of jams and jellies.

=== &quot;Kangina&quot; ===
In rural Afghanistan, grapes are preserved in disc-shaped vessels made of mud and straw, called &quot;kangina&quot;. The vessels, which can preserve fresh grapes for up to 6 months, passively control their internal environments to restrict gas exchange and water loss, prolonging the lives of late-harvested grapes stored within them.

=== Jugging ===

Meat can be preserved by jugging. Jugging is the process of stewing the meat (commonly game or fish) in a covered earthenware jug or casserole. The animal to be jugged is usually cut into pieces, placed into a tightly sealed jug with brine or gravy, and stewed. Red wine and/or the animal&#x27;s own blood is sometimes added to the cooking liquid. Jugging was a popular method of preserving meat up until the middle of the 20th century.

=== Lye ===

Sodium hydroxide (lye) makes food too alkaline for bacterial growth. Lye will saponify fats in the food, which will change its flavor and texture. Lutefisk uses lye in its preparation, as do some olive recipes. Modern recipes for century eggs also call for lye.

=== Pickling ===

Pickling is a method of preserving food in an edible, antimicrobial liquid. Pickling can be broadly classified into two categories: chemical pickling and fermentation pickling.

In chemical pickling, the food is placed in an edible liquid that inhibits or kills bacteria and other microorganisms. Typical pickling agents include brine (high in salt), vinegar, alcohol, and vegetable oil. Many chemical pickling processes also involve heating or boiling so that the food being preserved becomes saturated with the pickling agent. Common chemically pickled foods include cucumbers, peppers, corned beef, herring, and eggs, as well as mixed vegetables such as piccalilli.

In fermentation pickling, bacteria in the liquid produce organic acids as preservation agents, typically by a process that produces lactic acid through the presence of lactobacillales. Fermented pickles include sauerkraut, nukazuke, kimchi, and surströmming.

=== Sugaring ===

The earliest cultures have used sugar as a preservative, and it was commonplace to store fruit in honey. Similar to pickled foods, sugar cane was brought to Europe through the trade routes. In northern climates without sufficient sun to dry foods, preserves are made by heating the fruit with sugar. &quot;Sugar tends to draw water from the microbes (plasmolysis). This process leaves the microbial cells dehydrated, thus killing them. In this way, the food will remain safe from microbial spoilage.&quot; Sugar is used to preserve fruits, either in an antimicrobial syrup with fruit such as apples, pears, peaches, apricots, and plums, or in crystallized form where the preserved material is cooked in sugar to the point of crystallization and the resultant product is then stored dry. This method is used for the skins of citrus fruit (candied peel), angelica, and ginger. Sugaring can be used in the production of jam and jelly.

== Modern industrial techniques ==
Techniques of food preservation were developed in research laboratories for commercial applications.

===Aseptic processing===

Aseptic processing works by placing sterilized food (typically by heat, see ultra-high temperature processing) into sterlized packaging material under sterile conditions. The result is a sealed, sterile food product similar to canned food, but depending on the technique used, damage to food quality is typically reduced compared to canned food. A greater variety of packaging materials can be used as well.

Besides UHT, aseptic processing may be used in conjunction with any of the microbe-reduction technologies listed below. With pasteurization and &quot;high pressure pasteurization&quot;, the food may not be completely sterilized (instead achieving a specified log reduction), but the use of sterile packaging and environments is retained.

=== Pasteurization ===

Pasteurization is a process for preservation of liquid food. It was originally applied to combat the souring of young local wines. Today, the process is mainly applied to dairy products. In this method, milk is heated at about for 15–30 seconds to kill the bacteria present in it and cooling it quickly to to prevent the remaining bacteria from growing. The milk is then stored in sterilized bottles or pouches in cold places. This method was invented by Louis Pasteur, a French chemist, in 1862.

=== Vacuum packing ===

Vacuum-packing stores food in a vacuum environment, usually in an air-tight bag or bottle. The vacuum environment strips bacteria of oxygen needed for survival. Vacuum-packing is commonly used for storing nuts to reduce loss of flavor from oxidization. A major drawback to vacuum packaging, at the consumer level, is that vacuum sealing can deform contents and rob certain foods, such as cheese, of its flavor.

=== Freeze drying ===
=== Preservatives ===

Preservative food additives can be &quot;antimicrobial&quot; – which inhibit the growth of bacteria or fungi, including mold – or &quot;antioxidant&quot;, such as oxygen absorbers, which inhibit the oxidation of food constituents. Common antimicrobial preservatives include nisin, sorbates, calcium propionate, sodium nitrate/nitrite, sulfites (sulfur dioxide, sodium bisulfite, potassium hydrogen sulfite, etc.), EDTA, hinokitiol, and ε-polylysine. Antioxidants include tocopherols (Vitamin E), butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA) and butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT). Other preservatives include ethanol.

There is also another approach of impregnating packaging materials (plastic films or other) with antioxidants and antimicrobials.

=== Irradiation ===

Irradiation of food is the exposure of food to ionizing radiation. Multiple types of ionizing radiation can be used, including beta particles (high-energy electrons) and gamma rays (emitted from radioactive sources such as cobalt-60 or cesium-137). Irradiation can kill bacteria, molds, and insect pests, reduce the ripening and spoiling of fruits, and at higher doses induce sterility. The technology may be compared to pasteurization; it is sometimes called &quot;cold pasteurization&quot;, as the product is not heated. Irradiation may allow lower-quality or contaminated foods to be rendered marketable.

National and international expert bodies have declared food irradiation as &quot;wholesome&quot;; organizations of the United Nations, such as the World Health Organization and Food and Agriculture Organization, endorse food irradiation. Consumers may have a negative view of irradiated food based on the misconception that such food is radioactive; in fact, irradiated food does not and cannot become radioactive. Activists have also opposed food irradiation for other reasons, for example, arguing that irradiation can be used to sterilize contaminated food without resolving the underlying cause of the contamination. International legislation on whether food may be irradiated or not varies worldwide from no regulation to a full ban.

Approximately 500,000 tons of food items are irradiated per year worldwide in over 40 countries. These are mainly spices and condiments, with an increasing segment of fresh fruit irradiated for fruit fly quarantine.

=== Pulsed electric field electroporation ===

Pulsed electric field (PEF) electroporation is a method for processing cells by means of brief pulses of a strong electric field. PEF holds potential as a type of low-temperature alternative pasteurization process for sterilizing food products. In PEF processing, a substance is placed between two electrodes, then the pulsed electric field is applied. The electric field enlarges the pores of the cell membranes, which kills the cells and releases their contents. PEF for food processing is a developing technology still being researched. There have been limited industrial applications of PEF processing for the pasteurization of fruit juices. To date, several PEF treated juices are available on the market in Europe. Furthermore, for several years a juice pasteurization application in the US has used PEF. For cell disintegration purposes especially potato processors show great interest in PEF technology as an efficient alternative for their preheaters. Potato applications are already operational in the US and Canada. There are also commercial PEF potato applications in various countries in Europe, as well as in Australia, India, and China.

=== Modified atmosphere ===
Modifying atmosphere is a way to preserve food by operating on the atmosphere around it. It is often used to package:
* Fresh fruits and vegetables, especially salds crops, which contain living cells that respire even while refrigerated. Reducing oxygen () concentration and increasing the carbon dioxide () concentration slows down their respiration, conserves stored energy, and therefore increases shelf life. High humidity is also used to reduce water loss.
* Red meat, which needs high to reduce oxidation of myoglobin and maintain an attractive bright red color of the meat.
* Other meat and fish, which uses higher to reduce oxidation and slow down some microbes.

=== Nonthermal plasma ===

This process subjects the surface of food to a &quot;flame&quot; of ionized gas molecules, such as helium or nitrogen. This causes micro-organisms to die off on the surface.

=== High-pressure food preservation ===

High pressure can be used to disable harmful microorganisms and spoilage enzymes while retaining the food&#x27;s fresh appearance, flavor, texture and nutrients. By 2005, the process was being used for products ranging from orange juice to guacamole to deli meats and widely sold. Depending on temperature and pressure settings, HP processing can achieve either pasteurization-equivalent log reduction or go all the way to achieve sterilization of all microbes.

=== Biopreservation ===

Biopreservation is the use of natural or controlled microbiota or antimicrobials as a way of preserving food and extending its shelf life. Beneficial bacteria or the fermentation products produced by these bacteria are used in biopreservation to control spoilage and render pathogens inactive in food. It is a benign ecological approach which is gaining increasing attention.

Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) have antagonistic properties that make them particularly useful as biopreservatives. When LABs compete for nutrients, their metabolites often include active antimicrobials such as lactic acid, acetic acid, hydrogen peroxide, and peptide bacteriocins. Some LABs produce the antimicrobial nisin, which is a particularly effective preservative.

LAB bacteriocins are used in the present day as an integral part of hurdle technology. Using them in combination with other preservative techniques can effectively control spoilage bacteria and other pathogens, and can inhibit the activities of a wide spectrum of organisms, including inherently resistant Gram-negative bacteria.

=== Hurdle technology ===
Hurdle technology is a method of ensuring that pathogens in food products can be eliminated or controlled by combining more than one approach. These approaches can be thought of as &quot;hurdles&quot; the pathogen has to overcome if it is to remain active in the food. The right combination of hurdles can ensure all pathogens are eliminated or rendered harmless in the final product.

Hurdle technology has been defined by Leistner (2000) as an intelligent combination of hurdles that secures the microbial safety and stability as well as the organoleptic and nutritional quality and the economic viability of food products. The organoleptic quality of the food refers to its sensory properties, that is its look, taste, smell, and texture.

Examples of hurdles in a food system are high temperature during processing, low temperature during storage, increasing the acidity, lowering the water activity or redox potential, and the presence of preservatives or biopreservatives. According to the type of pathogens and how risky they are, the intensity of the hurdles can be adjusted individually to meet consumer preferences in an economical way, without sacrificing the safety of the product.

<doc id="10835" wikidata="Q181417" url="?curid=10835" title="Frequency modulation">
<text>Frequency modulation (FM) is the encoding of information in a carrier wave by varying the instantaneous frequency of the wave. The technology is used in telecommunications, radio broadcasting, signal processing, and computing.

In analog frequency modulation, such as radio broadcasting, of an audio signal representing voice or music, the instantaneous frequency deviation, i.e. the difference between the frequency of the carrier and its center frequency, has a functional relation to the modulating signal amplitude.

Digital data can be encoded and transmitted with a type of frequency modulation known as frequency-shift keying (FSK), in which the instantaneous frequency of the carrier is shifted among a set of frequencies. The frequencies may represent digits, such as &quot;0&quot; and &quot;1&quot;. FSK is widely used in computer modems such as fax modems, telephone caller ID systems, garage door openers, and other low-frequency transmissions. Radioteletype also uses FSK.

Frequency modulation is widely used for FM radio broadcasting. It is also used in telemetry, radar, seismic prospecting, and monitoring newborns for seizures via EEG, two-way radio systems, sound synthesis, magnetic tape-recording systems and some video-transmission systems. In radio transmission, an advantage of frequency modulation is that it has a larger signal-to-noise ratio and therefore rejects radio frequency interference better than an equal power amplitude modulation (AM) signal. For this reason, most music is broadcast over FM radio.

Frequency modulation and phase modulation are the two complementary principal methods of angle modulation; phase modulation is often used as an intermediate step to achieve frequency modulation. These methods contrast with amplitude modulation, in which the amplitude of the carrier wave varies, while the frequency and phase remain constant.

==Theory==

If the information to be transmitted (i.e., the baseband signal) is formula_1 and the sinusoidal carrier is formula_2, where &quot;fc&quot; is the carrier&#x27;s base frequency, and &quot;Ac&quot; is the carrier&#x27;s amplitude, the modulator combines the carrier with the baseband data signal to get the transmitted signal: 

:formula_3

where formula_4, formula_5 being the sensitivity of the frequency modulator and formula_6 being the amplitude of the modulating signal or baseband signal.

In this equation, formula_7 is the &quot;instantaneous frequency&quot; of the oscillator and formula_8 is the &quot;frequency deviation&quot;, which represents the maximum shift away from &quot;fc&quot; in one direction, assuming &quot;x&quot;&quot;m&quot;(&quot;t&quot;) is limited to the range ±1.

This process of integrating the instantaneous frequency to create an instantaneous phase is different from adding the modulating signal to the carrier frequency
:formula_9
which would result in a modulated signal that has spurious local minima and maxima that do not correspond to those of the carrier. 

While most of the energy of the signal is contained within &quot;fc&quot; ± &quot;f&quot;Δ, it can be shown by Fourier analysis that a wider range of frequencies is required to precisely represent an FM signal. The frequency spectrum of an actual FM signal has components extending infinitely, although their amplitude decreases and higher-order components are often neglected in practical design problems.

===Sinusoidal baseband signal===
Mathematically, a baseband modulating signal may be approximated by a sinusoidal continuous wave signal with a frequency &quot;fm&quot;. This method is also named as single-tone modulation. The integral of such a signal formula_10 is:

:formula_11

In this case, the expression for y(t) above simplifies to:

:formula_12

where the amplitude formula_13 of the modulating sinusoid is represented in the peak deviation formula_4 (see frequency deviation).

The harmonic distribution of a sine wave carrier modulated by such a sinusoidal signal can be represented with Bessel functions; this provides the basis for a mathematical understanding of frequency modulation in the frequency domain.

===Modulation index===
As in other modulation systems, the modulation index indicates by how much the modulated variable varies around its unmodulated level. It relates to variations in the carrier frequency:

:formula_15

where formula_16 is the highest frequency component present in the modulating signal &quot;x&quot;&quot;m&quot;(&quot;t&quot;), and formula_17 is the peak frequency-deviationi.e. the maximum deviation of the &quot;instantaneous frequency&quot; from the carrier frequency. For a sine wave modulation, the modulation index is seen to be the ratio of the peak frequency deviation of the carrier wave to the frequency of the modulating sine wave.

If formula_18, the modulation is called narrowband FM (NFM), and its bandwidth is approximately formula_19. Sometimes modulation index formula_20 is considered NFM and other modulation indices are considered wideband FM (WFM or FM).

For digital modulation systems, for example, binary frequency shift keying (BFSK), where a binary signal modulates the carrier, the modulation index is given by:

:formula_21

where formula_22 is the symbol period, and formula_23 is used as the highest frequency of the modulating binary waveform by convention, even though it would be more accurate to say it is the highest &quot;fundamental&quot; of the modulating binary waveform. In the case of digital modulation, the carrier formula_24 is never transmitted. Rather, one of two frequencies is transmitted, either formula_25 or formula_26, depending on the binary state 0 or 1 of the modulation signal.

If formula_27, the modulation is called &quot;wideband FM&quot; and its bandwidth is approximately formula_28. While wideband FM uses more bandwidth, it can improve the signal-to-noise ratio significantly; for example, doubling the value of formula_17, while keeping formula_30 constant, results in an eight-fold improvement in the signal-to-noise ratio. (Compare this with chirp spread spectrum, which uses extremely wide frequency deviations to achieve processing gains comparable to traditional, better-known spread-spectrum modes).

With a tone-modulated FM wave, if the modulation frequency is held constant and the modulation index is increased, the (non-negligible) bandwidth of the FM signal increases but the spacing between spectra remains the same; some spectral components decrease in strength as others increase. If the frequency deviation is held constant and the modulation frequency increased, the spacing between spectra increases.
Frequency modulation can be classified as narrowband if the change in the carrier frequency is about the same as the signal frequency, or as wideband if the change in the carrier frequency is much higher (modulation index &gt; 1) than the signal frequency. For example, narrowband FM (NFM) is used for two-way radio systems such as Family Radio Service, in which the carrier is allowed to deviate only 2.5 kHz above and below the center frequency with speech signals of no more than 3.5 kHz bandwidth. Wideband FM is used for FM broadcasting, in which music and speech are transmitted with up to 75 kHz deviation from the center frequency and carry audio with up to a 20 kHz bandwidth and subcarriers up to 92 kHz.

===Bessel functions===
For the case of a carrier modulated by a single sine wave, the resulting frequency spectrum can be calculated using Bessel functions of the first kind, as a function of the sideband number and the modulation index. The carrier and sideband amplitudes are illustrated for different modulation indices of FM signals. For particular values of the modulation index, the carrier amplitude becomes zero and all the signal power is in the sidebands.

Since the sidebands are on both sides of the carrier, their count is doubled, and then multiplied by the modulating frequency to find the bandwidth. For example, 3 kHz deviation modulated by a 2.2 kHz audio tone produces a modulation index of 1.36. Suppose that we limit ourselves to only those sidebands that have a relative amplitude of at least 0.01. Then, examining the chart shows this modulation index will produce three sidebands. These three sidebands, when doubled, gives us (6 × 2.2 kHz) or a 13.2 kHz required bandwidth.
===Carson&#x27;s rule===
A rule of thumb, &quot;Carson&#x27;s rule&quot; states that nearly all (≈98 percent) of the power of a frequency-modulated signal lies within a bandwidth formula_31 of:

:formula_32

where formula_33, as defined above, is the peak deviation of the instantaneous frequency formula_34 from the center carrier frequency formula_35, formula_36 is the Modulation index which is the ratio of frequency deviation to highest frequency in the modulating signal and formula_16is the highest frequency in the modulating signal.
Condition for application of Carson&#x27;s rule is only sinusoidal signals. For non-sinusoidal signals:

:formula_38

where W is the highest frequency in the modulating signal but non-sinusoidal in nature and D is the Deviation ratio which is the ratio of frequency deviation to highest frequency of modulating non-sinusoidal signal.

==Noise reduction==
FM provides improved signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), as compared for example with AM. Compared with an optimum AM scheme, FM typically has poorer SNR below a certain signal level called the noise threshold, but above a higher level – the full improvement or full quieting threshold – the SNR is much improved over AM. The improvement depends on modulation level and deviation. For typical voice communications channels, improvements are typically 5–15 dB. FM broadcasting using wider deviation can achieve even greater improvements. Additional techniques, such as pre-emphasis of higher audio frequencies with corresponding de-emphasis in the receiver, are generally used to improve overall SNR in FM circuits. Since FM signals have constant amplitude, FM receivers normally have limiters that remove AM noise, further improving SNR.

==Implementation==

===Modulation===
FM signals can be generated using either direct or indirect frequency modulation:
* Direct FM modulation can be achieved by directly feeding the message into the input of a voltage-controlled oscillator.
* For indirect FM modulation, the message signal is integrated to generate a phase-modulated signal. This is used to modulate a crystal-controlled oscillator, and the result is passed through a frequency multiplier to produce an FM signal. In this modulation, narrowband FM is generated leading to wideband FM later and hence the modulation is known as indirect FM modulation.

===Demodulation===
Many FM detector circuits exist. A common method for recovering the information signal is through a Foster–Seeley discriminator or ratio detector. A phase-locked loop can be used as an FM demodulator. &quot;Slope detection&quot; demodulates an FM signal by using a tuned circuit which has its resonant frequency slightly offset from the carrier. As the frequency rises and falls the tuned circuit provides a changing amplitude of response, converting FM to AM. AM receivers may detect some FM transmissions by this means, although it does not provide an efficient means of detection for FM broadcasts. In Software-Defined Radio implementations the demodulation may be carried out by using the Hilbert transform (implemented as a filter) to recover the instantaneous phase, and thereafter differentiating this phase (using another filter) to recover the instantaneous frequency. Alternatively, a complex mixer followed by a bandpass filter may be used to translate the signal to baseband, and then proceeding as before.

==Applications==
=== Doppler effect===
When an echolocating bat approaches a target, its outgoing sounds return as echoes, which are Doppler-shifted upward in frequency. In certain species of bats, which produce constant frequency (CF) echolocation calls, the bats compensate for the Doppler shift by lowering their call frequency as they approach a target. This keeps the returning echo in the same frequency range of the normal echolocation call. This dynamic frequency modulation is called the Doppler Shift Compensation (DSC), and was discovered by Hans Schnitzler in 1968.

===Magnetic tape storage===
FM is also used at intermediate frequencies by analog VCR systems (including VHS) to record the luminance (black and white) portions of the video signal. Commonly, the chrominance component is recorded as a conventional AM signal, using the higher-frequency FM signal as bias. FM is the only feasible method of recording the luminance (&quot;black-and-white&quot;) component of video to (and retrieving video from) magnetic tape without distortion; video signals have a large range of frequency components – from a few hertz to several megahertz, too wide for equalizers to work with due to electronic noise below −60 dB. FM also keeps the tape at saturation level, acting as a form of noise reduction; a limiter can mask variations in playback output, and the FM capture effect removes print-through and pre-echo. A continuous pilot-tone, if added to the signal – as was done on V2000 and many Hi-band formats – can keep mechanical jitter under control and assist timebase correction.

These FM systems are unusual, in that they have a ratio of carrier to maximum modulation frequency of less than two; contrast this with FM audio broadcasting, where the ratio is around 10,000. Consider, for example, a 6-MHz carrier modulated at a 3.5-MHz rate; by Bessel analysis, the first sidebands are on 9.5 and 2.5 MHz and the second sidebands are on 13 MHz and −1 MHz. The result is a reversed-phase sideband on +1 MHz; on demodulation, this results in unwanted output at 6 – 1 = 5 MHz. The system must be designed so that this unwanted output is reduced to an acceptable level.

===Sound===
FM is also used at audio frequencies to synthesize sound. This technique, known as FM synthesis, was popularized by early digital synthesizers and became a standard feature in several generations of personal computer sound cards.

===Radio===

Edwin Howard Armstrong (1890–1954) was an American electrical engineer who invented wideband frequency modulation (FM) radio.
He patented the regenerative circuit in 1914, the superheterodyne receiver in 1918 and the super-regenerative circuit in 1922. Armstrong presented his paper, &quot;A Method of Reducing Disturbances in Radio Signaling by a System of Frequency Modulation&quot;, (which first described FM radio) before the New York section of the Institute of Radio Engineers on November 6, 1935. The paper was published in 1936.

As the name implies, wideband FM (WFM) requires a wider signal bandwidth than amplitude modulation by an equivalent modulating signal; this also makes the signal more robust against noise and interference. Frequency modulation is also more robust against signal-amplitude-fading phenomena. As a result, FM was chosen as the modulation standard for high frequency, high fidelity radio transmission, hence the term &quot;FM radio&quot; (although for many years the BBC called it &quot;VHF radio&quot; because commercial FM broadcasting uses part of the VHF bandthe FM broadcast band). FM receivers employ a special detector for FM signals and exhibit a phenomenon known as the &quot;capture effect&quot;, in which the tuner &quot;captures&quot; the stronger of two stations on the same frequency while rejecting the other (compare this with a similar situation on an AM receiver, where both stations can be heard simultaneously). Frequency drift or a lack of selectivity may cause one station to be overtaken by another on an adjacent channel. Frequency drift was a problem in early (or inexpensive) receivers; inadequate selectivity may affect any tuner.

A wideband FM signal can also be used to carry a stereo signal; this is done with multiplexing and demultiplexing before and after the FM process. The FM modulation and demodulation process is identical in stereo and monaural processes.

FM is commonly used at VHF radio frequencies for high-fidelity broadcasts of music and speech. In broadcast services, where audio fidelity is important, wideband FM is generally used. Analog TV sound is also broadcast using FM. Narrowband FM is used for voice communications in commercial and amateur radio settings. In two-way radio, narrowband FM (NBFM) is used to conserve bandwidth for land mobile, marine mobile and other radio services.

A high-efficiency radio-frequency switching amplifier can be used to transmit FM signals (and other constant-amplitude signals). For a given signal strength (measured at the receiver antenna), switching amplifiers use less battery power and typically cost less than a linear amplifier. This gives FM another advantage over other modulation methods requiring linear amplifiers, such as AM and QAM.

There are reports that on October 5, 1924, Professor Mikhail A. Bonch-Bruevich, during a scientific and technical conversation in the Nizhny Novgorod Radio Laboratory, reported about his new method of telephony, based on a change in the period of oscillations. Demonstration of frequency modulation was carried out on the laboratory model.

===Hearing assistive technology===
Frequency modulated systems are a widespread and commercially available assistive technology that make speech more understandable by improving the signal-to-noise ratio in the user&#x27;s ear. They are also called &quot;auditory trainers&quot;, a term which refers to any sound amplification system not classified as a hearing aid. They intensify signal levels from the source by 15 to 20 decibels. FM systems are used by hearing-impaired people as well as children whose listening is affected by disorders such as auditory processing disorder or ADHD. For people with sensorineural hearing loss, FM systems result in better speech perception than hearing aids. They can be coupled with behind-the-ear hearing aids to allow the user to alternate the setting. FM systems are more convenient and cost-effective than alternatives such as cochlear implants, but many users use FM systems infrequently due to their conspicuousness and need for recharging.

<text>Faith and rationality exist in varying degrees of conflict or compatibility. Rationality is based on reason or facts. Faith is belief in inspiration, revelation, or authority. The word &quot;faith&quot; sometimes refers to a belief that is held in spite of or against reason or empirical evidence, or it can refer to belief based upon a degree of evidential warrant.

==Relationship between faith and reason==
Rationalists point out that many people hold irrational beliefs, for many reasons. There may be evolutionary causes for irrational beliefs—irrational beliefs may increase our ability to survive and reproduce.

One more reason for irrational beliefs can perhaps be explained by operant conditioning. For example, in one study by B. F. Skinner in 1948, pigeons were awarded grain at regular time intervals regardless of their behaviour. The result was that each of the pigeons developed their own idiosyncratic response which had become associated with the consequence of receiving grain.

Believers in the value of faith—for example those who believe salvation is possible through faith alone—frequently suggest that everyone holds beliefs arrived at by faith, not reason.

One form of belief held &quot;by faith&quot; may be seen existing in a faith as based on warrant. In this view some degree of evidence provides warrant for faith; it consists in other words in &quot;explain[ing] great things by small.&quot;

== Christianity ==
=== Catholic views ===
Thomas Aquinas was the first to write a full treatment of the relationship, differences, and similarities between faith, which he calls &quot;an intellectual assent&quot;, and reason.

&quot;Dei Filius&quot; was a dogmatic constitution of the First Vatican Council on the Roman Catholic faith. It was adopted unanimously on 24 April 1870. It states that &quot;not only can faith and reason never be opposed to one another, but they are of mutual aid one to the other&quot;.

Recent popes have spoken about faith and rationality: &quot;Fides et ratio&quot;, an encyclical letter promulgated by Pope John Paul II on 14 September 1998, deals with the relationship between faith and reason. Pope Benedict XVI&#x27;s Regensburg lecture, delivered on 12 September 2006, was on the subject of &quot;faith, reason and the university&quot;.

=== Lutheran views ===
=== Reformed views ===

Alvin Plantinga upholds that faith may be the result of evidence testifying to the reliability of the source of truth claims, but although it may involve this, he sees faith as being the result of hearing the truth of the gospel with the internal persuasion by the Holy Spirit moving and enabling him to believe. &quot;Christian belief is produced in the believer by the internal instigation of the Holy Spirit, endorsing the teachings of Scripture, which is itself divinely inspired by the Holy Spirit. The result of the work of the Holy Spirit is faith.&quot;

=== Evangelical views ===
American biblical scholar Archibald Thomas Robertson stated that the Greek word &quot;pistis&quot; used for faith in the New Testament (over two hundred forty times), and rendered &quot;assurance&quot; in Acts 17:31 (KJV), is &quot;an old verb to furnish, used regularly by Demosthenes for bringing forward evidence.&quot; Likewise Tom Price (Oxford Centre for Christian Apologetics) affirms that when the New Testament talks about faith positively it only uses words derived from the Greek root [pistis] which means &quot;to be persuaded.&quot;

In contrast to faith meaning blind trust, in the absence of evidence, even in the teeth of evidence, Alister McGrath quotes Oxford Anglican theologian W. H. Griffith-Thomas (1861–1924), who states faith is &quot;not blind, but intelligent&quot; and &quot;commences with the conviction of the mind based on adequate evidence&quot;, which McGrath sees as &quot;a good and reliable definition, synthesizing the core elements of the characteristic Christian understanding of faith.&quot;

==Jewish views==
The 14th-century Jewish philosopher Levi ben Gerson tried to reconcile faith and reason. He wrote: &quot;the Law cannot prevent us from considering to be true that which our reason urges us to believe.&quot;

<doc id="10842" wikidata="Q5427517" url="?curid=10842" title="F wave">
<text>In neuroscience, an F wave is one of several motor responses which may follow the direct motor response (M) evoked by electrical stimulation of peripheral motor or mixed (sensory and motor) nerves. F-waves are the second of two late voltage changes observed after stimulation is applied to the skin surface above the distal region of a nerve, in addition to the H-reflex (Hoffman&#x27;s Reflex) which is a muscle reaction in response to electrical stimulation of innervating sensory fibers. Traversal of F-waves along the entire length of peripheral nerves between the spinal cord and muscle, allows for assessment of motor nerve conduction between distal stimulation sites in the arm and leg, and related motoneurons (MN&#x27;s) in the cervical and lumbosacral cord. F-waves are able to assess both afferent and efferent loops of the alpha motor neuron in its entirety. As such, various properties of F-wave motor nerve conduction are analyzed in nerve conduction studies (NCS), and often used to assess polyneuropathies, resulting from states of neuronal demyelination and loss of peripheral axonal integrity.

With respect to its nomenclature, the F-wave is so named as it was initially studied in the smaller muscles of the foot. The observation of F-waves in the same motor units (MU) as those present in the direct motor response (M), along with the presence of F-waves in deafferented animal and human models, indicates that F-waves require direct activation of motor axons to be elicited, and do not involve conduction along afferent sensory nerves. Thus, the F-wave is considered a wave, as opposed to a reflex.

== Physiology ==
F-waves are evoked by strong electrical stimuli (supramaximal) applied to the skin surface above the distal portion of a nerve. This impulse travels both in orthodromic fashion (towards the muscle fibers) and antidromic fashion (towards the cell body in the spinal cord) along the alpha motor neuron. As the orthodromic impulse reaches innervated muscle fibers, a strong direct motor response (M) is evoked in these muscle fibers, resulting in a primary compound muscle action potential (CMAP). As the antidromic impulse reaches the cell bodies within the anterior horn of the motor neuron pool by retrograde transmission, a select portion of these alpha motor neurons, (roughly 5-10% of available motor neurons), &#x27;backfire&#x27; or rebound. This antidromic &#x27;backfiring&#x27; elicits an orthodromic impulse that follows back down the alpha motor neuron, towards innervated muscle fibers. Conventionally, axonal segments of motor neurons previously depolarized by preceding antidromic impulses enter a hyperpolarized state, disallowing the travel of impulses along them. However, these same axonal segments remains excitable or relatively depolarized for a sufficient period of time, allowing for rapid antidromic backfiring, and thus the continuation of the orthodromic impulse towards innervated muscle fibers. This successive orthodromic stimulus then evokes a smaller population of muscle fibers, resulting in a smaller CMAP known as an F-wave.

Several physiological factors may possibly influence the presence of F-waves after peripheral nerve stimulation. The shape and size of F-waves, along with the probability of their presence is small, as a high degree of variability exists in motor unit (MU) activation for any given stimulation. Thus, the generation of CMAP&#x27;s which elicit F-waves is subject to the variability in activation of motor units in a given pool over successive stimuli. Moreover, stimulation of peripheral nerve fibers account for both orthodromic impulses (along sensory fibers, towards the dorsal horn), as well as antidromic activity (along alpha motor neurons towards the ventral horn). Antidromic activity along collateral branches of alpha motor neurons may result in the activation of inhibitory Renshaw cells or direct inhibitory collaterals between motorneurons. Inhibition by these means may lower excitability of adjacent motor neurons and decrease the potential for antidromic backfiring and resultant F-waves; although it has been argued Renshaw cells preferentially inhibit smaller alpha motor neurons limited influence on modulation of antidromic backfiring.

Because a different population of anterior horn cells is stimulated with each stimulation, F waves are characterized as ubiquitous, low amplitude, late motor responses, which can vary in amplitude, latency and configuration across a series of stimuli.

== Properties ==
F waves can be analyzed by several properties including:
* &quot;amplitude&quot; (μV) - height or voltage of F wave
* &quot;duration&quot; (ms) - length of F wave
* &quot;latency&quot; (ms) - period between initial stimulation and F wave elicitation

== Measurements==
Several measurements can be done on the F responses, including:
* &quot;minimal and maximal F wave latencies (ms) -&quot; frequently used in the assessment of demyelinating neuropathic conditions including Guillain-Barré syndrome.
* &quot;chronodispersion -&quot; difference in maximal and minimal latencies across a series of F waves
* &quot;F wave persistence -&quot; measure of alpha motor neuron excitability calculated as the number of F responses elicited divided by the number of stimuli presented.

The minimal F wave latency is typically 25-32 ms in the upper extremities and 45-56 ms in the lower extremities.

F wave persistence is the number of F waves obtained per the number of stimulations, which is normally 80-100% (or above 50%).

<text>In botany, a fruit is the seed-bearing structure in flowering plants (angiosperms) that is formed from the ovary after flowering (see Fruit anatomy).

Fruits are the means by which angiosperms disseminate their seeds. Edible fruits in particular have long propagated using the movements of humans and other animals in a symbiotic relationship that is the means for seed dispersal for the one group and nutrition for the other; humans, and many other animals, have become dependent on fruits as a source of food. Consequently, fruits account for a substantial fraction of the world&#x27;s agricultural output, and some (such as the apple and the pomegranate) have acquired extensive cultural and symbolic meanings.

In common language and culinary usage, &quot;fruit&quot; normally means the seed-associated fleshy structures (or produce) of plants that typically are sweet (or sour) and edible in the raw state, such as apples, bananas, grapes, lemons, oranges, and strawberries. In botanical usage, the term &quot;fruit&quot; also includes many structures that are not commonly called as such in everyday language, such as nuts, bean pods, corn kernels, tomatoes, and wheat grains.

== Botanical vs. culinary ==

Many common language terms used for fruit and seeds differ from botanical classifications. For example, in botany, a &quot;fruit&quot; is a ripened ovary or carpel that contains seeds, e.g., an orange, pomegranate, tomato or a pumpkin. A &quot;nut&quot; is a type of fruit (and not a seed), and a &quot;seed&quot; is a ripened ovule.

In culinary language, a &quot;fruit&quot; is the sweet- or not sweet- (even sour-) tasting produce of a specific plant (e.g., a peach, pear or lemon); &quot;nuts&quot; are hard, oily, non-sweet plant produce in shells (hazelnut, acorn). &quot;Vegetables&quot;, so-called, typically are savory or non-sweet produce (zucchini, lettuce, broccoli, and tomato). but some may be sweet-tasting (sweet potato).

Examples of botanically classified fruit that are typically called vegetables include cucumber, pumpkin, and squash (all are cucurbits); beans, peanuts, and peas (all legumes); and corn, eggplant, bell pepper (or sweet pepper), and tomato. Many spices are fruits, botanically speaking, including black pepper, chili pepper, cumin and allspice. In contrast, rhubarb is often called a fruit when used in making pies, but the edible produce of rhubarb is actually the leaf stalk or petiole of the plant. Edible gymnosperm seeds are often given fruit names, e.g., ginkgo nuts and pine nuts.

Botanically, a cereal grain, such as corn, rice, or wheat is a kind of fruit (termed a caryopsis). However, the fruit wall is thin and fused to the seed coat, so almost all the edible grain-fruit is actually a seed.

== Structure ==

The outer layer, often edible, of most fruits is called the &quot;pericarp&quot;. Typically formed from the ovary, it surrounds the seeds; in some species, however, other structural tissues contribute to or form the edible portion. The pericarp may be described in three layers from outer to inner, i.e., the &quot;epicarp&quot;, &quot;mesocarp&quot; and &quot;endocarp&quot;.

Fruit that bears a prominent pointed terminal projection is said to be &quot;beaked&quot;.

== Development ==
A fruit results from the fertilizing and maturing of one or more flowers. The gynoecium, which contains the &quot;stigma-style-ovary&quot; system, is centered in the flower-head, and it forms all or part of the fruit. Inside the ovary(ies) are one or more ovules. Here begins a complex sequence called &quot;double fertilization&quot;: a female gametophyte produces an egg cell for the purpose of fertilization. (A female gametophyte is called a &quot;megagametophyte&quot;, and also called the &quot;embryo sac&quot;.) After double fertilization, the ovules will become seeds.

Ovules are fertilized in a process that starts with pollination, which is the movement of pollen from the stamens to the stigma-style-ovary system within the flower-head. After pollination, a pollen tube grows from the (deposited) pollen through the stigma down the style into the ovary to the ovule. Two sperm are transferred from the pollen to a megagametophyte. Within the megagametophyte, one sperm unites with the egg, forming a zygote, while the second sperm enters the central cell forming the endosperm mother cell, which completes the double fertilization process. Later, the zygote will give rise to the embryo of the seed, and the endosperm mother cell will give rise to endosperm, a nutritive tissue used by the embryo.

Fruit formation is associated with meiosis, a central aspect of sexual reproduction in flowering plants. During meiosis homologous chromosomes replicate, recombine and randomly segregate, and then undergo segregation of sister chromatids to produce haploid cells. Union of haploid nuclei from pollen and ovule (fertilisation), occurring either by self- or cross-pollination, leads to the formation of a diploid zygote that can then develop into an embryo within the emerging seed. Repeated fertilisations within the ovary are accompanied by maturation of the ovary to form the fruit.

As the ovules develop into seeds, the ovary begins to ripen and the ovary wall, the &quot;pericarp&quot;, may become fleshy (as in berries or drupes), or it may form a hard outer covering (as in nuts). In some multi-seeded fruits, the extent to which a fleshy structure develops is proportional to the number of fertilized ovules. The pericarp typically is differentiated into two or three distinct layers; these are called the &quot;exocarp&quot; (outer layer, also called epicarp), &quot;mesocarp&quot; (middle layer), and &quot;endocarp&quot; (inner layer).

In some fruits, the sepals, petals, stamens or the style of the flower fall away as the fleshy fruit ripens. However, for simple fruits derived from an &quot;inferior ovary&quot; – i.e., one that lies the attachment of other floral parts – there are parts (including petals, sepals, and stamens) that fuse with the ovary and ripen with it. For such a case, when floral parts other than the ovary form a significant part of the fruit that develops, it is called an accessory fruit. Examples of accessory fruits include apple, rose hip, strawberry, and pineapple.

Because several parts of the flower besides the ovary may contribute to the structure of a fruit, it is important to understand how a particular fruit forms. There are three general modes of fruit development:

* Apocarpous fruits develop from a &quot;single flower&quot; (while having one or more separate, unfused, carpels); they are the simple fruits.
* Syncarpous fruits develop from a &quot;single gynoecium&quot; (having two or more carpels fused together).
* Multiple fruits form from many flowers – i.e., an inflorescence of flowers.

==Classification of fruits==

Consistent with the three modes of fruit development, plant scientists have classified fruits into three main groups: simple fruits, aggregate fruits, and multiple (or composite) fruits. The groupings reflect how the ovary and other flower organs are arranged and how the fruits develop, but they are not evolutionarily relevant as diverse plant taxa may be in the same group.

While the section of a fungus that produces spores is called a &quot;fruiting&quot; body, fungi are members of the fungi kingdom and not of the plant kingdom.

=== Simple fruits ===

Simple fruits are the result of the ripening-to-fruit of a simple or compound ovary in a &quot;single flower&quot; with a &quot;single pistil&quot;. In contrast, a single flower with numerous pistils typically produces an aggregate fruit; and the merging of several flowers, or a &#x27;multiple&#x27; of flowers, results in a &#x27;multiple&#x27; fruit. A simple fruit is further classified as either dry or fleshy.

To distribute their seeds, dry fruits may split open and discharge their seeds to the winds, which is called dehiscence. Or the distribution process may rely upon the decay and degradation of the fruit to expose the seeds; or it may rely upon the eating of fruit and excreting of seeds by frugivores – both are called indehiscence. Fleshy fruits do not split open, but they also are indehiscent and they may also rely on frugivores for distribution of their seeds. Typically, the entire outer layer of the ovary wall ripens into a potentially edible pericarp.

Types of dry simple fruits, (with examples) include:
* Achene – most commonly seen in aggregate fruits (e.g., strawberry, see below).
* Capsule – (Brazil nut: botanically, it is not a nut).
* Caryopsis – (cereal grains, including wheat, rice, oats, barley).
* Cypsela – an achene-like fruit derived from the individual florets in a capitulum: (dandelion).
* Fibrous drupe – (coconut, walnut: botanically, neither is a true nut.).
* Follicle – follicles are formed from a single carpel, and opens by one suture: (milkweed); also commonly seen in aggregate fruits: (magnolia, peony).
* Legume – (bean, pea, peanut: botanically, the peanut is the seed of a legume, not a nut).
* Loment – a type of indehiscent legume: (sweet vetch or wild potato).
* Nut – (beechnut, hazelnut, acorn (of the oak): botanically, these are true nuts).
* Samara – (ash, elm, maple key).
* Schizocarp, see below – (carrot seed).
* Silique – (radish seed).
* Silicle – (shepherd&#x27;s purse).
* Utricle – (beet, &quot;Rumex&quot;).

Fruits in which part or all of the &quot;pericarp&quot; (fruit wall) is fleshy at maturity are termed &quot;fleshy simple fruits&quot;.

Types of fleshy simple fruits, (with examples) include:
* Berry – the berry is the most common type of fleshy fruit. The entire outer layer of the ovary wall ripens into a potentially edible &quot;pericarp&quot;, (see below).
* Stone fruit or drupe – the definitive characteristic of a drupe is the hard, &quot;lignified&quot; stone (sometimes called the &quot;pit&quot;). It is derived from the ovary wall of the flower: apricot, cherry, olive, peach, plum, mango.
* Pome – the pome fruits: apples, pears, rosehips, saskatoon berry, etc., are a syncarpous (fused) fleshy fruit, a simple fruit, developing from a half-inferior ovary. Pomes are of the family Rosaceae.

==== Berries ====

Berries are a type of simple fleshy fruit that issue from a single ovary. (The ovary itself may be compound, with several carpels.) The botanical term &quot;true berry&quot; includes grapes, currants, cucumbers, eggplants (aubergines), tomatoes, chili peppers, and bananas, but excludes certain fruits that are called &quot;-berry&quot; by culinary custom or by common usage of the term – such as strawberries and raspberries. Berries may be formed from one or more carpels (i.e., from the simple or compound ovary) from the same, single flower. Seeds typically are embedded in the fleshy interior of the ovary.

Examples include:
* Tomato – in culinary terms, the tomato is regarded as a vegetable, but it is botanically classified as a fruit and a berry.
* Banana – the fruit has been described as a &quot;leathery berry&quot;. In cultivated varieties, the seeds are diminished nearly to non-existence.
* Pepo – berries with skin that is hardened: cucurbits, including gourds, squash, melons.
* Hesperidium – berries with a rind and a juicy interior: most citrus fruit.
* Cranberry, gooseberry, redcurrant, grape.

The strawberry, regardless of its appearance, is classified as a dry, not a fleshy fruit. Botanically, it is not a berry; it is an aggregate-accessory fruit, the latter term meaning the fleshy part is derived not from the plant&#x27;s ovaries but from the receptacle that holds the ovaries. Numerous dry achenes are attached to the outside of the fruit-flesh; they appear to be seeds but each is actually an ovary of a flower, with a seed inside.

Schizocarps are dry fruits, though some appear to be fleshy. They originate from syncarpous ovaries but do not actually dehisce; rather, they split into segments with one or more seeds. They include a number of different forms from a wide range of families, including carrot, parsnip, parsley, cumin.

=== Aggregate fruits ===

An aggregate fruit is also called an aggregation, or &quot;etaerio&quot;; it develops from a single flower that presents numerous simple pistils. Each pistil contains one carpel; together, they form a fruitlet. The ultimate (fruiting) development of the aggregation of pistils is called an &quot;aggregate fruit&quot;, &quot;etaerio fruit&quot;, or simply an &quot;etaerio&quot;.

Different types of aggregate fruits can produce different etaerios, such as achenes, drupelets, follicles, and berries.

* For example, the Ranunculaceae species, including &quot;Clematis&quot; and &quot;Ranunculus&quot;, produces an etaerio of achenes;
* &quot;Rubus&quot; species, including raspberry: an etaerio of drupelets;
* &quot;Calotropis&quot; species: an etaerio of follicles fruit;
* &quot;Annona&quot; species: an etaerio of berries.

Some other broadly recognized species and their etaerios (or aggregations) are:
* Teasel; fruit is an aggregation of cypselas.
* Tuliptree; fruit is an aggregation of samaras.
* Magnolia and peony; fruit is an aggregation of follicles.
* American sweet gum; fruit is an aggregation of capsules.
* Sycamore; fruit is an aggregation of achenes.

The pistils of the raspberry are called &quot;drupelets&quot; because each pistil is like a small drupe attached to the receptacle. In some bramble fruits, such as blackberry, the receptacle, an accessory part, elongates and then develops as part of the fruit, making the blackberry an aggregate-accessory fruit. The strawberry is also an aggregate-accessory fruit, of which the seeds are contained in the achenes. Notably in all these examples, the fruit develops from a single flower, with numerous pistils.

=== Multiple fruits ===

A multiple fruit is formed from a cluster of flowers, (a &#x27;multiple&#x27; of flowers) – also called an &quot;inflorescence&quot;. Each (&#x27;smallish&#x27;) flower produces a single fruitlet, which, as all develop, all merge into one mass of fruit. Examples include pineapple, fig, mulberry, Osage orange, and breadfruit. An inflorescence (a cluster) of white flowers, called a head, is produced first. After fertilization, each flower in the cluster develops into a drupe; as the drupes expand, they develop as a &quot;connate&quot; organ, merging into a multiple fleshy fruit called a &quot;syncarp&quot;.

Progressive stages of multiple flowering and fruit development can be observed on a single branch of the Indian mulberry, or &quot;noni&quot;. During the sequence of development, a progression of second, third, and more inflorescences are initiated in turn at the head of the branch or stem.

=== Accessory fruit forms ===

Fruits may incorporate tissues derived from other floral parts besides the ovary, including the receptacle, hypanthium, petals, or sepals. Accessory fruits occur in all three classes of fruit development – simple, aggregate, and multiple. Accessory fruits are frequently designated by the hyphenated term showing both characters. For example, a pineapple is a multiple-accessory fruit, a blackberry is an aggregate-accessory fruit, and an apple is a simple-accessory fruit.

=== Table of fleshy fruit examples ===
== Seedless fruits ==

Seedlessness is an important feature of some fruits of commerce. Commercial cultivars of bananas and pineapples are examples of seedless fruits. Some cultivars of citrus fruits (especially grapefruit, mandarin oranges, navel oranges, satsumas), table grapes, and of watermelons are valued for their seedlessness. In some species, seedlessness is the result of &quot;parthenocarpy&quot;, where fruits set without fertilization. Parthenocarpic fruit-set may (or may not) require pollination, but most seedless citrus fruits require a stimulus from pollination to produce fruit. Seedless bananas and grapes are triploids, and seedlessness results from the abortion of the embryonic plant that is produced by fertilization, a phenomenon known as &quot;stenospermocarpy&quot;, which requires normal pollination and fertilization.

== Seed dissemination ==
Variations in fruit structures largely depend on the modes of dispersal applied to their seeds. Dispersal is achieved by wind or water, by explosive dehiscence, and by interactions with animals.

Some fruits present their outer skins or shells coated with spikes or hooked burrs; these evolved either to deter would-be foragers from feeding on them or to serve to attach themselves to the hair, feathers, legs, or clothing of animals, thereby using them as dispersal agents. These plants are termed zoochorous; common examples include cocklebur, unicorn plant, and beggarticks (or Spanish needle).

By developments of mutual evolution, the fleshy produce of fruits typically appeals to hungry animals, such that the seeds contained within are taken in, carried away, and later deposited (i.e., defecated) at a distance from the parent plant. Likewise, the nutritious, oily kernels of nuts typically motivate birds and squirrels to hoard them, burying them in soil to retrieve later during the winter of scarcity; thereby, uneaten seeds are sown effectively under natural conditions to germinate and grow a new plant some distance away from the parent.

Other fruits have evolved flattened and elongated wings or helicopter-like blades, e.g., elm, maple, and tuliptree. This mechanism increases dispersal distance away from the parent via wind. Other wind-dispersed fruit have tiny &quot;parachutes&quot;, e.g., dandelion, milkweed, salsify.

Coconut fruits can float thousands of miles in the ocean, thereby spreading their seeds. Other fruits that can disperse via water are nipa palm and screw pine.

Some fruits have evolved propulsive mechanisms that fling seeds substantial distances – perhaps up to in the case of the sandbox tree – via explosive dehiscence or other such mechanisms (see impatiens and squirting cucumber).

== Food uses ==
 A large variety of fruits – fleshy (simple) fruits from apples to berries to watermelon; dry (simple) fruits including beans and rice and coconuts; aggregate fruits including strawberries, raspberries, blackberries, pawpaw; and multiple fruits such as pineapple, fig, mulberries – are commercially valuable as human food. They are eaten both fresh and as jams, marmalade and other fruit preserves. They are used extensively in manufactured and processed foods (cakes, cookies, baked goods, flavorings, ice cream, yogurt, canned vegetables, frozen vegetables and meals) and beverages such as fruit juices and alcoholic beverages (brandy, fruit beer, wine). Spices like vanilla, black pepper, paprika, and allspice are derived from berries. Olive fruit is pressed for olive oil and similar processing is applied to other oil-bearing fruits and vegetables. Some fruits are available all year round, while others (such as blackberries and apricots in the UK) are subject to seasonal availability.

Fruits are also used for socializing and gift-giving in the form of fruit baskets and fruit bouquets.

Typically, many botanical fruits – &quot;vegetables&quot; in culinary parlance – (including tomato, green beans, leaf greens, bell pepper, cucumber, eggplant, okra, pumpkin, squash, zucchini) are bought and sold daily in fresh produce markets and greengroceries and carried back to kitchens, at home or restaurant, for preparation of meals.

=== Storage ===
All fruits benefit from proper post-harvest care, and in many fruits, the plant hormone ethylene causes ripening. Therefore, maintaining most fruits in an efficient cold chain is optimal for post-harvest storage, with the aim of extending and ensuring shelf life.

=== Nutritional value ===
A meta-analysis of 83 studies showed fruit or vegetable consumption is associated with reduced markers of inflammation (reduced tumor necrosis factor and C-reactive protein) and enhanced immune cell profile (increased gamma delta T cells).

Various culinary fruits provide significant amounts of fiber and water, and many are generally high in vitamin C. An overview of numerous studies showed that fruits (e.g., whole apples or whole oranges) are satisfying (filling) by simply eating and chewing them.

The dietary fiber consumed in eating fruit promotes satiety, and may help to control body weight and aid reduction of blood cholesterol, a risk factor for cardiovascular diseases. Fruit consumption is under preliminary research for the potential to improve nutrition and affect chronic diseases. Regular consumption of fruit is generally associated with reduced risks of several diseases and functional declines associated with aging.

=== Food safety ===
For food safety, the CDC recommends proper fruit handling and preparation to reduce the risk of food contamination and foodborne illness. Fresh fruits and vegetables should be carefully selected; at the store, they should not be damaged or bruised; and precut pieces should be refrigerated or surrounded by ice.

All fruits and vegetables should be rinsed before eating. This recommendation also applies to produce with rinds or skins that are not eaten. It should be done just before preparing or eating to avoid premature spoilage.

Fruits and vegetables should be kept separate from raw foods like meat, poultry, and seafood, as well as from utensils that have come in contact with raw foods. Fruits and vegetables that are not going to be cooked should be thrown away if they have touched raw meat, poultry, seafood, or eggs.

All cut, peeled, or cooked fruits and vegetables should be refrigerated within two hours. After a certain time, harmful bacteria may grow on them and increase the risk of foodborne illness.

=== Allergies ===
Fruit allergies make up about 10 percent of all food-related allergies.

== Nonfood uses ==

Because fruits have been such a major part of the human diet, various cultures have developed many different uses for fruits they do not depend on for food. For example:

* Bayberry fruits provide a wax often used to make candles;
* Many dry fruits are used as decorations or in dried flower arrangements (e.g., annual honesty, cotoneaster, lotus, milkweed, unicorn plant, and wheat). Ornamental trees and shrubs are often cultivated for their colorful fruits, including beautyberry, cotoneaster, holly, pyracantha, skimmia, and viburnum.
* Fruits of opium poppy are the source of opium, which contains the drugs codeine and morphine, as well as the biologically inactive chemical theabaine from which the drug oxycodone is synthesized.
* Osage orange fruits are used to repel cockroaches.
* Many fruits provide natural dyes (e.g., cherry, mulberry, sumac, and walnut).
* Dried gourds are used as bird houses, cups, decorations, dishes, musical instruments, and water jugs.
* Pumpkins are carved into Jack-o&#x27;-lanterns for Halloween.
* The fibrous core of the mature and dry Luffa fruit is used as a sponge.
* The spiny fruit of burdock or cocklebur inspired the invention of Velcro.
* Coir fiber from coconut shells is used for brushes, doormats, floor tiles, insulation, mattresses, sacking, and as a growing medium for container plants. The shell of the coconut fruit is used to make bird houses, bowls, cups, musical instruments, and souvenir heads.
* The hard and colorful grain fruits of Job&#x27;s tears are used as decorative beads for jewelry, garments, and ritual objects.
* Fruit is often a subject of still life paintings.

<text>French materialism is the name given to a handful of French 18th-century philosophers during the Age of Enlightenment, many of them clustered around the salon of Baron d&#x27;Holbach. Although there are important differences between them, all of them were materialists who believed that the world was made up of a single substance, matter, the motions and properties of which could be used to explain all phenomena. 

Prominent French materialists of the 18th century include:

* Julien Offray de La Mettrie
* Denis Diderot
* Baron d&#x27;Holbach
* Claude Adrien Helvétius
* Pierre Jean Georges Cabanis
* Jacques-André Naigeon

<text>February is the second month of the year in the Julian and Gregorian calendars. The month has 28 days in common years and 29 in leap years, with the 29th day being called the &quot;leap day&quot;. 
February is the third and last month of meteorological winter in the Northern Hemisphere. In the Southern Hemisphere, February is the third and last month of meteorological summer, being the seasonal equivalent of August in the Northern Hemisphere.

== Pronunciation ==
&quot;February&quot; can be pronounced in several different ways. The beginning of the word is commonly pronounced either as or ; many people drop the first &quot;r&quot;, replacing it with , as if it were spelled &quot;Febuary&quot;. This comes about by analogy with &quot;January&quot; (), as well as by a dissimilation effect whereby having two &quot;r&quot;s close to each other causes one to change. The ending of the word is pronounced in the US and in the UK.

== History ==
The Roman month was named after the Latin term , which means &quot;purification&quot;, via the purification ritual held on February 15 (full moon) in the old lunar Roman calendar. January and February were the last two months to be added to the Roman calendar, since the Romans originally considered winter a monthless period of the year. They were added by Numa Pompilius about 713 BC. February remained the last month of the calendar year until the time of the decemvirs (), when it became the second month. At certain times February was truncated to 23 or 24 days, and a 27-day intercalary month, Intercalaris, was occasionally inserted immediately after February to realign the year with the seasons.

February observances in Ancient Rome included Amburbium (precise date unknown), Sementivae (February 2), Februa (February 13–15), Lupercalia (February 13–15), Parentalia (February 13–22), Quirinalia (February 17), Feralia (February 21), Caristia (February 22), Terminalia (February 23), Regifugium (February 24), and Agonium Martiale (February 27). These days do not correspond to the modern Gregorian calendar.

Under the reforms that instituted the Julian calendar, Intercalaris was abolished, leap years occurred regularly every fourth year, and in leap years February gained a 29th day. Thereafter, it remained the second month of the calendar year, meaning the order that months are displayed (January, February, March, ..., December) within a year-at-a-glance calendar. Even during the Middle Ages, when the numbered Anno Domini year began on March 25 or December 25, the second month was February whenever all twelve months were displayed in order. The Gregorian calendar reforms made slight changes to the system for determining which years were leap years, but also contained a 29-day February.

Historical names for February include the Old English terms Solmonath (mud month) and Kale-monath (named for cabbage) as well as Charlemagne&#x27;s designation Hornung. In Finnish, the month is called , meaning &quot;month of the pearl&quot;; when snow melts on tree branches, it forms droplets, and as these freeze again, they are like pearls of ice. In Polish and Ukrainian, respectively, the month is called or (), meaning the month of ice or hard frost. In Macedonian the month is (), meaning month of cutting (wood). In Czech, it is called , meaning month of submerging (of river ice).

In Slovene, February is traditionally called , related to icicles or Candlemas. This name originates from , written as in the &quot;New Carniolan Almanac&quot; from 1775 and changed to its final form by Franc Metelko in his &quot;New Almanac&quot; from 1824. The name was also spelled , meaning &quot;the month of cutting down of trees&quot;. In 1848, a proposal was put forward in &quot;Kmetijske in rokodelske novice&quot; by the Slovene Society of Ljubljana to call this month (related to ice melting), but it did not stick. The idea was proposed by a priest, Blaž Potočnik. Another name of February in Slovene was , after the mythological character Vesna.

== Patterns ==

Having only 28 days in common years, February is the only month of the year that can pass without a single full moon. Using Coordinated Universal Time as the basis for determining the date and time of a full moon, this last happened in 2018 and will next happen in 2037. The same is true regarding a new moon: again using Coordinated Universal Time as the basis, this last happened in 2014 and will next happen in 2033.

February is also the only month of the calendar that, at intervals alternating between one of six years and two of eleven years, has exactly four full 7-day weeks. In countries that start their week on a Monday, it occurs as part of a common year starting on Friday, in which February 1st is a Monday and the 28th is a Sunday; the most recent occurrence was 2021, and the next one will be 2027. In countries that start their week on a Sunday, it occurs in a common year starting on Thursday; the most recent occurrence was 2015 and the next occurrence will be 2026. The pattern is broken by a skipped leap year, but no leap year has been skipped since 1900 and no others will be skipped until 2100.

== Astronomy ==
February meteor showers include the Alpha Centaurids (appearing in early February), the March Virginids (lasting from February 14 to April 25, peaking around March 20), the Delta Cancrids (appearing December 14 to February 14, peaking on January 17), the Omicron Centaurids (late January through February, peaking in mid-February), Theta Centaurids (January 23 – March 12, only visible in the southern hemisphere), Eta Virginids (February 24 and March 27, peaking around March 18), and Pi Virginids (February 13 and April 8, peaking between March 3 and March 9).

== Symbols ==

The zodiac signs of February are Aquarius (until February 18) and Pisces (February 19 onward).

Its birth flowers are the violet (&quot;Viola&quot;), the common primrose (&quot;Primula vulgaris&quot;), and the Iris. Its birthstone is the amethyst, which symbolizes piety, humility, spiritual wisdom, and sincerity.

<text>The first lady of the United States (FLOTUS) is a title typically held by the wife of the president of the United States, concurrent with the president&#x27;s term in office. Although the first lady&#x27;s role has never been codified or officially defined, she figures prominently in the political and social life of the United States. The first lady of the United States is the hostess of the White House.

Historically, when a president has been unmarried or a widower, he has usually asked a relative to act as White House hostess. While the household always had domestic staff, since the early 20th century, the first lady has been assisted by her event staff, which has grown over the years to include communications, personal, and program staff. Her office is now known as the Office of the First Lady and is headquartered in the East Wing of the White House. 

Since the 1900s, the role of first lady has changed considerably. It has come to include involvement in political campaigns, management of the White House, championship of social causes, and representation of the president at official and ceremonial occasions. Additionally, over the years individual first ladies have held influence in a range of sectors, from fashion to public opinion on policy, as well as advocacy for female empowerment.

== Origins of the title ==
The use of the title &quot;First Lady&quot; to describe the spouse or hostess of an executive began in the United States. In the early days of the republic, there was not a generally accepted title for the wife of the president. Many early first ladies expressed their own preference for how they were addressed, including the use of such titles as &quot;Lady&quot;, &quot;Mrs. President&quot; and &quot;Mrs. Presidentress&quot;; Martha Washington was often referred to as &quot;Lady Washington&quot;. One of the earliest uses of the term &quot;First Lady&quot; was applied to her in an 1838 newspaper article that appeared in the &quot;St. Johnsbury Caledonian&quot;, the author, &quot;Mrs. Sigourney&quot;, discusses how Martha Washington had not changed, even after her husband George became president. She wrote that &quot;The first lady of the nation still preserved the habits of early life. Indulging in no indolence, she left the pillow at dawn, and after breakfast, retired to her chamber for an hour for the study of the scriptures and devotion.&quot;

According to popular belief, Dolley Madison was referred to as first lady in 1849 at her funeral in a eulogy delivered by President Zachary Taylor; however, no written record of this eulogy exists, nor did any of the newspapers of her day refer to her by that title. Sometime after 1849, the title began being used in Washington, D.C., social circles. The first person to have the title applied to her while she was actually holding the office was Harriet Lane, the niece of James Buchanan; &quot;Leslie&#x27;s Illustrated Newspaper&quot; used the phrase to describe her in an 1860 article about her duties as White House hostess. Another of the earliest known written examples comes from a November 3, 1863, diary entry of William Howard Russell, in which he referred to gossip about &quot;the First Lady in the Land&quot;, referring to Mary Todd Lincoln. The title first gained nationwide recognition in 1877, when newspaper journalist Mary C. Ames referred to Lucy Webb Hayes as &quot;the First Lady of the Land&quot; while reporting on the inauguration of Rutherford B. Hayes. The frequent reporting on Lucy Hayes&#x27; activities helped spread use of the title outside Washington. A popular 1911 comedic play about Dolley Madison by playwright Charles Nirdlinger, titled &quot;The First Lady in the Land&quot;, popularized the title further. By the 1930s, it was in wide use. Use of the title later spread from the United States to other nations.

When Edith Wilson took control of her husband&#x27;s schedule in 1919 after he had a debilitating stroke, one Republican senator labeled her &quot;the Presidentress who had fulfilled the dream of the suffragettes by changing her title from First Lady to Acting First Man&quot;. According to the Nexis database, the abbreviation FLOTUS (pronounced ) was first used in 1983 by Donnie Radcliffe, writing in &quot;The Washington Post&quot;.

=== Non-spouses in the role ===
Several women (at least thirteen) who were not presidents&#x27; wives have served as first lady, as when the president was a bachelor or widower, or when the wife of the president was unable to fulfill the duties of the first lady herself. In these cases, the position has been filled by a female relative of the president, such as Jefferson&#x27;s daughter Martha Jefferson Randolph, Jackson&#x27;s daughter-in-law Sarah Yorke Jackson and his wife&#x27;s niece Emily Donelson, Taylor&#x27;s daughter Mary Elizabeth Bliss, Benjamin Harrison&#x27;s daughter Mary Harrison McKee, Buchanan&#x27;s niece Harriet Lane, Chester A. Arthur&#x27;s sister Mary Arthur McElroy and Cleveland&#x27;s sister Rose Cleveland.

=== Potential male title ===
Each of the 45 presidents of the United States have been males, and all have either had their wives, or a female hostess, assume the role of first lady. Thus, a male equivalent of the title of first lady has never been needed; in 2016, as Hillary Clinton became the first woman to win a major party&#x27;s presidential nomination, questions were raised as to what her husband Bill would be titled if she were to win the presidency. During the campaign, the title of First Gentleman of the United States was most frequently suggested for Bill Clinton, although as a former president himself, he might have been called &quot;Mr. President&quot;. In addition, state governors&#x27; male spouses are typically called the first gentleman of their respective state (for example, Michael Haley was the first gentleman of South Carolina while his wife, Nikki, served as governor). Ultimately, Hillary Clinton lost the election, rendering this a moot point.

In 2021, Kamala Harris took office as vice president, making her husband Doug Emhoff the first male spouse of a nationally elected officeholder. Emhoff assumed the title of Second Gentleman of the United States (&quot;gentleman&quot; replacing &quot;lady&quot; in the title) making it likely that any future male spouse of a president will be given the title of first gentleman. Harris would later go on to replace President Joe Biden as the Democratic presidential nominee in the 2024 presidential election. Had Harris&#x27; presidential campaign been successful, Emhoff would presumably have been granted this title. However, Harris lost the election, again rendering this a moot point.

== Role ==

The position of the first lady is not an elected one and carries only ceremonial duties. Nonetheless, first ladies have held a highly visible position in American society. The role of the first lady has evolved over the centuries. She is, first and foremost, the hostess of the White House. She organizes and attends official ceremonies and functions of state either along with, or in place of, the president. Lisa Burns identifies four successive main themes of the first ladyship: as public woman (1900–1929); as political celebrity (1932–1961); as political activist (1964–1977); and as political interloper (1980–2001).

Martha Washington created the role and hosted many affairs of state at the national capital (New York and Philadelphia). This socializing became known as the Republican Court and provided elite women with opportunities to play backstage political roles. Both Martha Washington and Abigail Adams were treated as if they were &quot;ladies&quot; of the British royal court.

Dolley Madison popularized the first ladyship by engaging in efforts to assist orphans and women, by dressing in elegant fashions and attracting newspaper coverage, and by risking her life to save iconic treasures during the War of 1812. Madison set the standard for the ladyship and her actions were the model for nearly every first lady until Eleanor Roosevelt in the 1930s. Roosevelt traveled widely and spoke to many groups, often voicing personal opinions to the left of the president&#x27;s. She authored a weekly newspaper column and hosted a radio show. Jacqueline Kennedy led an effort to redecorate and restore the White House.

Many first ladies became significant fashion trendsetters. Some have exercised a degree of political influence by virtue of being an important advisor to the president.

Over the course of the 20th century, it became increasingly common for first ladies to select specific causes to promote, usually ones that are not politically divisive. It is common for the first lady to hire a staff to support these activities. Lady Bird Johnson pioneered environmental protection and beautification. Pat Nixon encouraged volunteerism and traveled extensively abroad; Betty Ford supported women&#x27;s rights; Rosalynn Carter aided those with mental disabilities; Nancy Reagan founded the Just Say No drug awareness campaign; Barbara Bush promoted literacy; Hillary Clinton sought to reform the healthcare system in the U.S.; Laura Bush supported women&#x27;s rights groups, and encouraged childhood literacy. Michelle Obama became identified with supporting military families and tackling childhood obesity; and Jill Biden focused her support on military families and White House history. The current first lady Melania Trump has used her position to help children, including prevention of cyberbullying and support for those whose lives are affected by drugs.

Since 1964, the incumbent and all living former first ladies are honorary members of the board of trustees of the National Cultural Center, the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts.

Near the end of her husband&#x27;s presidency, Hillary Clinton became the first first lady to seek political office, when she ran for United States Senate. During the campaign, her daughter Chelsea took over much of the first lady&#x27;s role. Victorious, Clinton served as junior senator from New York from 2001 to 2009, when she resigned to become President Obama&#x27;s secretary of state. Later, she was the Democratic Party nominee for president in the 2016 election, but lost to Donald Trump.

== Office of the First Lady ==
The Office of the First Lady of the United States is accountable to the first lady for her to carry out her duties as hostess of the White House, and is also in charge of all social and ceremonial events of the White House. The first lady has her own staff that includes a chief of staff, press secretary, White House social secretary, and chief floral designer. The Office of the First Lady is an entity of the White House Office, a branch of the Executive Office of the President. When First Lady Hillary Clinton decided to pursue a run for Senator of New York, she set aside her duties as first lady and moved to Chappaqua, New York, to establish state residency. She resumed her duties as first lady after winning her senatorial campaign, and retained her duties as both first lady and a U.S. senator for the seventeen-day overlap before Bill Clinton&#x27;s term came to an end.

== Collections ==
Established in 1912, the First Ladies Collection has been one of the most popular attractions at the Smithsonian Institution. The original exhibition opened in 1914 and was one of the first at the Smithsonian to prominently feature women. Originally focused largely on fashion, the exhibition now delves deeper into the contributions of first ladies to the and American society. In 2008, &quot;First Ladies at the Smithsonian&quot; opened at the National Museum of American History as part of its reopening year celebration. That exhibition served as a bridge to the museum&#x27;s expanded exhibition on first ladies&#x27; history that opened on November 19, 2011. &quot;The First Ladies&quot; explores the unofficial but important position of first lady and the ways that different women have shaped the role to make their own contributions to the presidential administrations and the nation. The exhibition features 26 dresses and more than 160 other objects, ranging from those of Martha Washington to Michelle Obama, and includes White House china, personal possessions and other objects from the Smithsonian&#x27;s unique collection of first ladies&#x27; materials.
== Influence ==
Some first ladies have garnered attention for their dress and style. Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, for instance, became a global fashion icon: her style was copied by commercial manufacturers and imitated by many young women, and she was named to the International Best Dressed List Hall of Fame in 1965. Mamie Eisenhower was named one of the twelve best-dressed women in the country by the New York Dress Institute every year that she was First Lady. The &quot;Mamie Look&quot; involved a full-skirted dress, charm bracelets, pearls, little hats, and bobbed, banged hair. Michelle Obama also received significant attention for her fashion choices: style writer Robin Givhan praised her in &quot;The Daily Beast&quot;, arguing that the First Lady&#x27;s style had helped to enhance the public image of the office.

== Causes and initiatives ==

<text>Franklin Patrick Herbert Jr. (October 8, 1920February 11, 1986) was an American science-fiction author, best known for his 1965 novel &quot;Dune&quot; and its five sequels. He also wrote short stories and worked as a newspaper journalist, photographer, book reviewer, ecological consultant, and lecturer.

&quot;Dune&quot; is the best-selling science fiction novel of all time, and the series is a classic of the science-fiction genre. The &quot;Dune&quot; saga, set in the distant future and taking place over millennia, explores complex themes, such as the long-term survival of the human species, human evolution, planetary science and ecology, and the intersection of religion, politics, economics, sex, and power in a future where humanity has long since developed interstellar travel and colonized many thousands of worlds.

The series has been adapted numerous times, including the feature film David Lynch&#x27;s &quot;Dune&quot; (1984), the miniseries &quot;Frank Herbert&#x27;s Dune&quot; (2000) and &quot;Children of Dune&quot; (2003), and a motion picture trilogy currently in production, with Denis Villeneuve&#x27;s &quot;Dune&quot; (2021) and &quot;&quot; (2024) having been released.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Franklin Patrick Herbert Jr. was born on October 8, 1920, in Tacoma, Washington, to Franklin Patrick Herbert Sr. and Eileen (née McCarthy) Herbert. His paternal grandparents had come west in 1905 to join Burley Colony in Kitsap County, one of many utopian communes springing up in Washington State beginning in the 1890s. His upbringing included spending a lot of time on the rural Olympic and Kitsap Peninsulas. He was fascinated by books, could read much of the newspaper before the age of five, had an excellent memory, and learned quickly. He had an early interest in photography, buying a Kodak box camera at age ten, a new folding camera in his early teens, and a color film camera in the mid-1930s. Due to his parents&#x27; drinking, he ran away from home with his little sister, 5-year-old Patricia Lou, in 1938 to live with Frank&#x27;s favorite maternal aunt, Peggy &quot;Violet&quot; Rowntree, and her husband, Ken Rowntree, Sr. Within weeks, Patricia moved back home. But Frank, 18, remained with his aunt and uncle.

===Education===
He enrolled in high school at Salem High School (now North Salem High School), where he graduated the next year. In 1939, his parents and sister had moved to Los Angeles, California, so Frank followed them. He lied about his age to get his first newspaper job at the &quot;Glendale Star&quot;. Herbert then returned to Salem in 1940 where he worked for the &quot;Oregon Statesman&quot; newspaper (now &quot;Statesman Journal&quot;) in a variety of positions, including photographer.

Herbert married Flora Lillian Parkinson in San Pedro, California, in 1941. They had one daughter, Penelope (b. February 16, 1942), and divorced in 1943. During 1942, after the U.S. entry into World War II, he served in the U.S. Navy&#x27;s Seabees for six months as a photographer, but suffered a head injury and was given a medical discharge. Herbert subsequently moved to Portland, Oregon where he reported for &quot;The Oregon Journal&quot;.

After the war, Herbert attended the University of Washington, where he met Beverly Ann Stuart at a creative writing class in 1946. They were the only students who had sold any work for publication; Herbert had sold two pulp adventure stories to magazines, the first to &quot;Esquire&quot; in 1945 titled &quot;Survival of the Cunning&quot;, and Stuart had sold a story to &quot;Modern Romance&quot; magazine. They married in Seattle in 1946, and had two sons, Brian (b. 1947) and Bruce (1951–1993). In 1949 Herbert and his wife moved to California to work on the Santa Rosa &quot;Press-Democrat&quot;. Here they befriended the psychologists Ralph and Irene Slattery. The Slatterys introduced Herbert to the work of several thinkers who would influence his writing, including Freud, Jung, Jaspers and Heidegger; they also familiarized Herbert with Zen Buddhism.

Herbert never graduated from college. According to his son Brian, he wanted to study only what interested him and so did not complete the required curriculum. He returned to journalism and worked at the &quot;Seattle Star&quot; and the &quot;Oregon Statesman&quot;. He was a writer and editor for the &quot;San Francisco Examiner&quot; &quot;California Living&quot; magazine for a decade.

===Early career===
In a 1973 interview, Herbert stated that he had been reading science fiction &quot;about ten years&quot; before he began writing in the genre, and he listed his favorite authors as H. G. Wells, Robert A. Heinlein, Poul Anderson and Jack Vance.

Herbert&#x27;s first science fiction story, &quot;Looking for Something&quot;, was published in the April 1952 issue of &quot;Startling Stories&quot;, then a monthly edited by Samuel Mines. Three more of his stories appeared in 1954 issues of &quot;Astounding Science Fiction&quot; and &quot;Amazing Stories&quot;. His career as a novelist began in 1955 with the serial publication of &quot;Under Pressure&quot; in &quot;Astounding&quot; from November 1955; afterward it was issued as a book by Doubleday titled &quot;The Dragon in the Sea&quot;. The story explored sanity and madness in the environment of a 21st-century submarine and predicted worldwide conflicts over oil consumption and production. It was a critical success but not a major commercial one. During this time Herbert also worked as a speechwriter for Republican senator Guy Cordon.

=== &quot;Dune&quot; ===

Herbert began researching &quot;Dune&quot; in 1959. He was able to devote himself wholeheartedly to his writing career because his wife returned to work full-time as an advertising writer for department stores, becoming their breadwinner during the 1960s. The novel &quot;Dune&quot; was published in 1965, which spearheaded the &quot;Dune&quot; franchise. He later told Willis E. McNelly that the novel originated when he was assigned to write a magazine article about sand dunes in the Oregon Dunes near Florence, Oregon. He got overinvolved and ended up with far more raw material than needed for an article; while the article was never written, it planted in Herbert the seed that would become &quot;Dune&quot;. Another possible source of inspiration for &quot;Dune&quot; was Herbert&#x27;s purported experiences with psilocybin, according to mycologist Paul Stamets&#x27;s account, which describes Herbert&#x27;s hobby of cultivating chanterelles. The biography of Frank Herbert, &quot;Dreamer of Dune&quot;, written by his son Brian Herbert, confirms that the author was passionate about culinary mushrooms but not his use of psilocybin.

&quot;Dune&quot; took six years of research and writing to complete and was much longer than other commercial science fiction of the time. &quot;Analog&quot; (the renamed &quot;Astounding&quot;, still edited by John W. Campbell) published it in two parts comprising eight installments, &quot;Dune World&quot; from December 1963 and &quot;Prophet of Dune&quot; in 1965. It was then rejected by nearly twenty book publishers. One editor prophetically wrote, &quot;I might be making the mistake of the decade, but...&quot;

Sterling E. Lanier, an editor of Chilton Book Company (known mainly for its auto-repair manuals), had read the Dune serials and offered a $7,500 advance plus future royalties for the rights to publish them as a hardcover book. Herbert rewrote much of his text.

&quot;Dune&quot; was soon a critical success. It won the Nebula Award for Best Novel in 1965 and shared the Hugo Award in 1966 with &quot;...And Call Me Conrad&quot; by Roger Zelazny.

&quot;Dune&quot; was not an immediate bestseller, although by 1968 Herbert had made $20,000 from it, far more than most science fiction novels of the time. It was not, however, enough to let him take up full-time writing. The publication of &quot;Dune&quot; did open doors for him; he was the &quot;Seattle Post-Intelligencer&quot; education writer from 1969 to 1972 and lecturer in general studies and interdisciplinary studies at the University of Washington (1970–1972). He worked in Vietnam and Pakistan as a social and ecological consultant in 1972, and in 1973 he was director-photographer of the television show &quot;The Tillers&quot;.

By the end of 1972, Herbert had retired from newspaper writing and became a full-time fiction writer. During the 1970s and 1980s, he enjoyed considerable commercial success as an author. He divided his time between homes in Hawaii and Washington&#x27;s Olympic Peninsula; his home in Port Townsend on the peninsula was intended to be an &quot;ecological demonstration project&quot;. During this time he wrote numerous books and pushed ecological and philosophical ideas. He continued his &quot;Dune&quot; saga with &quot;Dune Messiah&quot; (1969), &quot;Children of Dune&quot; (1976), &quot;God Emperor of Dune&quot; (1981), &quot;Heretics of Dune&quot; (1984) and &quot;&quot; (1985). Herbert planned to write a seventh novel to conclude the series, but his death in 1986 left storylines unresolved.

Other works by Herbert include &quot;The Godmakers&quot; (1972), &quot;The Dosadi Experiment&quot; (1977), &quot;The White Plague&quot; (1982) and the books he wrote in partnership with Bill Ransom: &quot;The Jesus Incident&quot; (1979), &quot;The Lazarus Effect&quot; (1983) and &quot;The Ascension Factor&quot; (1988), which were sequels to Herbert&#x27;s 1966 novel &quot;&quot;. He also helped launch the career of Terry Brooks with a very positive review of Brooks&#x27; first novel, &quot;The Sword of Shannara&quot;, in 1977.

=== Success, family changes, and death ===
Herbert&#x27;s change in fortune was shadowed by tragedy. In 1974, his wife Beverly underwent treatment for lung cancer. She lived ten more years, but her health was adversely affected by the treatment. In October 1978, Herbert was the featured speaker at the Octocon II science fiction convention held at the El Rancho Tropicana in Santa Rosa, California. In 1979, he met anthropologist Jim Funaro with whom he conceived the Contact Conference. In June 1981, Herbert was a guest of honour at Advention &#x27;81 in Adelaide, South Australia. Beverly Herbert died on February 7, 1984. Herbert completed and published &quot;Heretics of Dune&quot; that year. In his afterword to 1985&#x27;s &quot;&quot;, Herbert included a dedication to Beverly.

The year 1984 was a tumultuous year in Herbert&#x27;s life. During this same year of his wife&#x27;s death, his career took off with the release of David Lynch&#x27;s film version of &quot;Dune&quot;. Despite high expectations, a big-budget production design and an A-list cast, the movie drew mostly poor reviews in the United States. However, despite a disappointing response in the US, the film was a critical and commercial success in Europe and Japan.

In 1985, after Beverly&#x27;s death, Herbert married his former Putnam representative Theresa Shackleford. The same year he published &quot;Chapterhouse: Dune&quot;, which tied up many of the saga&#x27;s story threads. This would be Herbert&#x27;s final single work (the collection &quot;Eye&quot; was published that year, and &quot;Man of Two Worlds&quot; was published in 1986). He died of a massive pulmonary embolism while recovering from surgery for pancreatic cancer on February 11, 1986, in Madison, Wisconsin, aged 65.

=== Political views ===
Herbert was a Republican and an environmentalist. His political views have been variously described as conservative, reactionist, and libertarian. Herbert was politically active within the Republican party, and worked as a speechwriter for several politicians, including Senator Guy Cordon. Herbert also volunteered on the campaign of Republican William Bantz in the 1958 Washington Senate election, who unsuccessfully challenged the incumbent Democrat Henry M. Jackson.

Herbert was a critic of the Soviet Union. He was a distant relative of the Republican senator Joseph McCarthy, whom he referred to as &quot;Cousin Joe&quot;. However, he was appalled to learn of McCarthy&#x27;s blacklisting of suspected communists from working in certain careers and believed that he was endangering essential freedoms of citizens of the United States. Herbert also opposed American involvement in the war in Vietnam. He was also critical of welfare, arguing that it increased dependence on the state.

Herbert believed that governments lie to protect themselves and that, following the Watergate scandal, President Richard Nixon had unwittingly taught an important lesson in not trusting government. He considered Nixon a better president than John F. Kennedy, calling the latter &quot;one of the most dangerous presidents this country ever had.&quot; He praised President Ronald Reagan, for his pro-family and pro-individualist stances, while opposing his foreign policy.

In &quot;Chapterhouse: Dune&quot;, he wrote:
Frank Herbert believed civil service to be &quot;one of the most serious errors we made as a democracy&quot; and that bureaucracy negatively impacts the lives of people in all forms of government. He stated that &quot;every such bureaucracy eventually becomes an aristocracy&quot; and uses preferential treatment and nepotism in favor of bureaucrats as his main arguments.

==Ideas and themes==
Frank Herbert used his science fiction novels to explore complex ideas involving philosophy, religion, psychology, politics and ecology. The underlying thrust of his work was a fascination with the question of human survival and evolution. Herbert has attracted a dedicated fan base, many of whom have attempted to read everything he wrote (fiction or non-fiction); indeed, such was the devotion of some of his readers that Herbert was at times asked if he was founding a cult, a proposition which he very much rejected.

There are a number of key themes found in Herbert&#x27;s work:
* A concern with leadership: Herbert explored the human tendency to slavishly submit to charismatic leaders. He delved into both the flaws and potentials of bureaucracy and government.
* Herbert was among the first science fiction authors to popularize ideas about ecology and systems thinking. He stressed the need for humans to think both holistically and with regards to the long-term.
* The relationship between religion, politics and power.
* Human survival and adaptation: Herbert writes of the Fremen, the Sardaukar, and the Dosadi, who are molded by their terrible living conditions into dangerous super races.
* Human possibilities and potential: Herbert offered Mentats, the Bene Gesserit and the Bene Tleilax as different visions of human potential.
* The nature of sanity and madness. Frank Herbert was interested in the work of Thomas Szasz and the anti-psychiatry movement. Often, Herbert poses the question, &quot;What is sane?&quot;, and while there are clearly examples of insane behavior and psychopathy to be found in his works (as evinced by characters such as Piter De Vries), it is often suggested that normal and abnormal are relative terms which humans are sometimes ill-equipped to apply to one another, especially on the basis of statistical regularity.
* The possible effects and consequences of consciousness-altering chemicals, such as the spice in the &quot;Dune&quot; saga, as well as the &#x27;Jaspers&#x27; fungus in &quot;The Santaroga Barrier&quot;, and the Kelp in the sequence.
* How language shapes thought. More specifically, Herbert was influenced by Alfred Korzybski&#x27;s &quot;General Semantics&quot;. Algis Budrys wrote that Herbert&#x27;s knowledge of language and linguistics was &#x27;worth at least one PhD and the Chair of Philology at a good New England college&#x27;.
* Learning, teaching, and thinking.

Frank Herbert refrained from offering his readers formulaic answers to many of the questions he explored.

==Status and influence on science fiction==
&quot;Dune&quot; and the &quot;Dune&quot; saga constitute one of the world&#x27;s best-selling science fiction series and novels; &quot;Dune&quot; in particular has received widespread critical acclaim, winning the Nebula Award in 1965 and sharing the Hugo Award in 1966, and is frequently considered one of the best science fiction novels ever, if not the best. &quot;Locus&quot; subscribers voted it the all-time best SF novel in 1975, again in 1987, and the best &quot;before 1990&quot; in 1998.

&quot;Dune&quot; is considered a landmark novel for a number of reasons:

* &quot;Dune&quot; is a landmark of soft science fiction. Herbert deliberately suppressed technology in his &quot;Dune&quot; universe so that he could address the future of humanity, rather than the future of humanity&#x27;s technology. &quot;Dune&quot; considers the way humans and their institutions might change over time.
* Frank Herbert was a great popularizer of scientific ideas. In &quot;Dune&quot;, he helped popularize the term &quot;ecology&quot;. Gerald Jonas explains in &quot;The New York Times Book Review&quot;: &quot;So completely did Mr. Herbert work out the interactions of man and beast and geography and climate that &quot;Dune&quot; became the standard for an emerging subgenre of &#x27;ecological&#x27; science fiction.&quot;
* &quot;Dune&quot; is considered an example of literary world-building. &quot;The Library Journal&quot; reports that &quot;&quot;Dune&quot; is to science fiction what &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; is to fantasy&quot;. Arthur C. Clarke is quoted as making a similar statement on the back cover of a paper edition of &quot;Dune&quot;. Frank Herbert imagined every facet of his creation. He included glossaries, quotes, documents, and histories, to bring his universe alive to his readers. No science fiction novel before it had so vividly realized life on another world.

Herbert never again equalled the critical acclaim he received for &quot;Dune&quot;. Neither his sequels to &quot;Dune&quot; nor any of his other books won a Hugo or Nebula Award, although almost all of them were &quot;New York Times&quot; Best Sellers.

Malcolm Edwards wrote, in &quot;The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction&quot;:

The Science Fiction Hall of Fame inducted Herbert in 2006.

California State University, Fullerton&#x27;s Pollack Library has several of Herbert&#x27;s draft manuscripts of &quot;Dune&quot; and other works, with the author&#x27;s notes, in their Frank Herbert Archives.

Metro Parks Tacoma built Dune Peninsula and the Frank Herbert Trail at Point Defiance Park in July 2019 to honor the hometown writer.

==Bibliography==
=== Posthumously published works ===
Beginning in 2012, Herbert&#x27;s estate and WordFire Press have released four previously unpublished novels in e-book and paperback formats: &quot;High-Opp&quot; (2012), &quot;Angels&#x27; Fall&quot; (2013), &quot;A Game of Authors&quot; (2013), and &quot;A Thorn in the Bush&quot; (2014).

In recent years, Frank Herbert&#x27;s son Brian Herbert and author Kevin J. Anderson have added to the &quot;Dune&quot; franchise, using notes left behind by Frank Herbert and discovered over a decade after his death. Brian Herbert and Anderson have written three prequel trilogies (&quot;Prelude to Dune&quot;, &quot;Legends of Dune&quot; and &quot;Great Schools of Dune&quot;) exploring the history of the &quot;Dune&quot; universe before the events of the original novel, two novels that take place between novels of the original &quot;Dune&quot; sequels (with plans for more), as well as two post-&quot;Chapterhouse Dune&quot; novels that complete the original series (&quot;Hunters of Dune&quot; and &quot;Sandworms of Dune&quot;) based on Frank Herbert&#x27;s own &quot;Dune 7&quot; outline.

<doc id="10853" wikidata="Q2623733" url="?curid=10853" title="Fictional language">
<text>Fictional languages are the subset of constructed languages (conlangs) that have been created as part of a fictional setting (e.g. for use in a book, movie, television show, or video game). Typically they are the creation of one individual, while natural languages evolve out of a particular culture or people group, and other conlangs may have group involvement. Fictional languages are also distinct from natural languages in that they have no native speakers. By contrast, the constructed language of Esperanto now has native speakers.

Fictional languages are intended to be the languages of a fictional world and are often designed with the intent of giving more depth, and an appearance of plausibility, to the fictional worlds with which they are associated. The goal of the author may be to have their characters communicate in a fashion which is both alien and dislocated. Within their fictional world, these languages do function as natural languages, helping to identify certain races or people groups and set them apart from others.

While some less-formed fictional languages are created as distorted versions or dialects of a pre-existing natural language, many are independently designed conlangs with their own lexicon (some more robust than others) and rules of grammar. Some of the latter are fully formed enough to be learned as a speakable language, and many subcultures exist of those who are &#x27;fluent&#x27; in one or more of these fictional languages. Often after the creator of a fictional language has accomplished their task, the fandom of that fictional universe will pick up where the creator left off and continue to flesh out the language, making it more like a natural language and therefore more usable.

==Purpose==
Fictional languages are separated from artistic languages by both purpose and relative completion: a fictional language often has the least amount of grammar and vocabulary possible, and rarely extends beyond the absolutely necessary. At the same time, some others have developed languages in detail for their own sake, such as J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s Quenya and Sindarin (two Elvish languages), &quot;Star Trek&quot;″s Klingon language and &quot;Avatar&quot;&#x27;s Na&#x27;vi language which exist as functioning, usable languages.

By analogy with the word &quot;conlang&quot;, the term &quot;conworld&quot; is used to describe these fictional worlds, inhabited by fictional constructed cultures. The conworld influences vocabulary (what words the language will have for flora and fauna, articles of clothing, objects of technology, religious concepts, names of places and tribes, etc.), as well as influencing other factors such as pronouns, or how their cultures view the break-off points between colors or the gender and age of family members. Sound is also a directing factor, as creators seek to show their audience through phonology the type of race or people group to whom the language belongs.

==Commercial fictional languages==
Commercial fictional languages are those languages created for use in various commercial media, such as:

* Books (&quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;″ Quenya and Sindarin)
* Films (&quot;Avatar&quot;″s Na&#x27;vi, Kiliki and &quot;Star Wars&quot;″ Huttese.)
* Television shows (&quot;Star Trek&quot;″s Klingon, the Ultra Series&#x27; Ultra Language, &quot;Game of Thrones&quot;&#x27; Valyrian and Dothraki)
* Video games (&quot;Far Cry Primal&quot;″s Wenja, &quot;The Sims&quot;″ Simlish, &quot;Splatoon&quot;″s inkling typeface, The &quot;Ar Tonelico&quot; Series&#x27; Hymmnos.)
* Comics (&quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot;″s Bordurian and Syldavian)
* Toys (&quot;Furby&quot;&#x27;s Furbish)
* Musical albums (&quot;Magma&quot;″s Kobaïan)
*Children&#x27;s TV shows (&quot;Pingu&quot;″s Penguinese)

While some languages are created purely from the desire of the creator, language creation can be a profession. In 1974, Victoria Fromkin was the first person hired to create a language (&quot;Land of the Lost&quot;&#x27;s Paku). Since then, notable professional language creators have included Marc Okrand (Klingon), David Peterson (Dothraki and others in &quot;Game of Thrones&quot;), and Paul Frommer (Na&#x27;vi).

==Alien languages==
A notable subgenre of fictional languages are alien languages, the ones that are used or might be used by putative extraterrestrial life forms. Alien languages are subject of both science fiction and scientific research. Perhaps the most fully developed fictional alien language is the Klingon language of the &quot;Star Trek&quot; universe – a fully developed constructed language.

The problem of alien language has confronted generations of science fiction writers; some have created fictional languages for their characters to use, while others have circumvented the problem through translation devices or other fantastic technology. For example, the &quot;Star Trek&quot; universe makes use of a &quot;universal translator&quot;, which explains why such different races, often meeting for the first time, are able to communicate with each other. Another more humorous example would be the Babel fish from &quot;The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot;, an aurally-inserted fish that instantaneously translates alien speech to the speaker&#x27;s native language.

While in many cases an alien language is but an element of a fictional reality, in a number of science fiction works the core of the plot involves linguistic and psychological problems of communication between various alien species.

=== Visual alien languages ===

A further subgenre of alien languages are those that are visual, rather than auditory. Notable examples of this type are Sherman&#x27;s Circular Gallifreyan from BBC&#x27;s &quot;Doctor Who&quot; series and the heptapod&#x27;s written language, which is distinct from their spoken language, from the 2016 film &quot;Arrival&quot;.

==Internet-based fictional languages==

Internet-based fictional languages are hosted along with their &quot;conworlds&quot; on the internet, and based at these sites, becoming known to the world through the visitors to these sites. Verdurian, the language of Mark Rosenfelder&#x27;s Verduria on the planet of Almea, is an Internet-based fictional language.

<text>Formula One, commonly abbreviated as F1, is the highest class of international racing for open-wheel single-seater formula racing cars sanctioned by the Fédération Internationale de l&#x27;Automobile (FIA). The FIA Formula One World Championship has been one of the world&#x27;s premier forms of motorsport since its inaugural running in 1950 and is often considered to be the pinnacle of motorsport. The word &quot;formula&quot; in the name refers to the set of rules all participants&#x27; cars must follow. A Formula One season consists of a series of races, known as Grands Prix. Grands Prix take place in multiple countries and continents on either purpose-built circuits or closed roads.

A points scoring system is used at Grands Prix to determine two annual World Championships: one for the drivers, and one for the constructors—now synonymous with teams. Each driver must hold a valid Super Licence, the highest class of racing licence the FIA issues, and the races must be held on Grade One tracks, the highest grade rating the FIA issues for tracks.

Formula One cars are the world&#x27;s fastest regulated road-course racing cars, owing to high cornering speeds achieved by generating large amounts of aerodynamic downforce, much of which is generated by front and rear wings, as well as underbody tunnels. The cars depend on electronics, aerodynamics, suspension, and tyres. Traction control, launch control, automatic shifting, and other electronic driving aids were first banned in . They were briefly reintroduced in , and have more recently been banned since and , respectively.

With the average annual cost of running a team—designing, building, and maintaining cars, pay, transport—at approximately million, Formula One&#x27;s financial and political battles are widely reported. The Formula One Group is owned by Liberty Media, which acquired it in 2017 from private-equity firm CVC Capital Partners for billion.

==History==
Formula One originated from the World Manufacturers&#x27; Championship (1925–1930) and European Drivers&#x27; Championship (1931–1939). The &quot;formula&quot; is a set of rules that all participants&#x27; cars must follow. Formula One was a formula agreed upon in 1946 to officially become effective in 1947. The first Grand Prix in accordance with the new regulations was the 1946 Turin Grand Prix, anticipating the formula&#x27;s official start. Before World War II, a number of Grand Prix racing organisations made suggestions for a new championship to replace the European Championship, but due to the suspension of racing during the conflict, the new International Formula for cars did not become formalised until 1946, to become effective in 1947. The new World Championship was instituted to commence in 1950.

The first world championship race, the 1950 British Grand Prix, took place at Silverstone Circuit in the United Kingdom on 13 May 1950. Giuseppe Farina, competing for Alfa Romeo, won the first Drivers&#x27; World Championship, narrowly defeating his teammate Juan Manuel Fangio. Fangio won the championship in , , , , and . This set the record for the most World Championships won by a single driver, a record that stood for 46 years until Michael Schumacher won his sixth championship in 2003.
A Constructors&#x27; Championship was added in the 1958 season. Stirling Moss, despite often being regarded as one of the greatest Formula One drivers in the 1950s and 1960s, never won the Formula One championship. Between 1955 and 1961, Moss finished second in the championship four times and third the other three times. Fangio won 24 of the 52 races he entered—still the record for the highest Formula One winning percentage by an individual driver. National championships existed in South Africa and the UK in the 1960s and 1970s. Promoters held non-championship Formula One events for many years. Due to the increasing cost of competition, the last of these was held in 1983.

This era featured teams managed by road-car manufacturers, such as Alfa Romeo, Ferrari, Mercedes-Benz and Maserati. The first seasons featured prewar cars like Alfa Romeo&#x27;s 158, which were front-engined, with narrow tyres and 1.5-litre supercharged or 4.5-litre naturally aspirated engines. The and seasons were run to Formula Two regulations, for smaller, less powerful cars, due to concerns over the dearth of Formula One cars. When a new Formula One formula for engines limited to 2.5 litres was reinstated for the 1954 world championship, Mercedes-Benz introduced its W196, which featured things never seen on Formula One cars before, such as desmodromic valves, fuel injection, and enclosed streamlined bodywork. Mercedes drivers won the championship for the next two years, before the team withdrew from all motorsport competitions due to the 1955 Le Mans disaster.

=== Technological developments ===
The first major technological development in the sport was Bugatti&#x27;s introduction of mid-engined cars. Jack Brabham, the world champion in , , and , soon proved the mid-engine&#x27;s superiority over all other engine positions. By all teams had switched to mid-engined cars. The Ferguson P99, a four-wheel drive design, was the last front-engined Formula One car to enter a world championship race. It entered the 1961 British Grand Prix, the only front-engined car to compete that year.

During , Lotus introduced a car with an aluminium-sheet monocoque chassis instead of the traditional space-frame design. This proved to be the greatest technological breakthrough since the introduction of mid-engined cars.

In , sponsorship was introduced to the sport. Team Gunston became the first team to run cigarette sponsorship on its Brabham cars, which privately entered in orange, brown and gold colours of Gunston cigarettes in the 1968 South African Grand Prix on 1 January 1968. Five months later, the first works team, Lotus, initially using the British racing green, followed this example when it entered its cars painted in the red, gold, and white colours of the Imperial Tobacco&#x27;s Gold Leaf livery at the 1968 Spanish Grand Prix.

Aerodynamic downforce slowly gained importance in car design with the appearance of aerofoils during the 1968 season. The wings were introduced by Lotus&#x27;s owner Colin Chapman who installed modest front wings and a rear spoiler on his Lotus 49B at the 1968 Monaco Grand Prix. In the late 1970s, Lotus introduced ground-effect aerodynamics, previously used on Jim Hall&#x27;s Chaparral 2J in 1970, that provided enormous downforce and greatly increased cornering speeds. The aerodynamic forces pressing the cars to the track were up to five times the car&#x27;s weight. As a result, extremely stiff springs were needed to maintain a constant ride height, leaving the suspension virtually solid. This meant that the drivers depended entirely on the tyres for any small amount of cushioning of the car and driver from irregularities of the road surface.

===Big business===
Beginning in the 1970s, Bernie Ecclestone rearranged the management of Formula One&#x27;s commercial rights; he is widely credited with transforming the sport into the multi-billion dollar business it now is. When Ecclestone bought the Brabham team during 1971, he gained a seat on the Formula One Constructors&#x27; Association, and in 1978, he became its president. Previously, the circuit owners controlled the income of the teams and negotiated with each individually; Ecclestone persuaded the teams to &quot;hunt as a pack&quot; through FOCA. He offered Formula One to circuit owners as a package they could take or leave. In return for the package, almost all that was required was to surrender trackside advertising.

The formation of the Fédération Internationale du Sport Automobile (FISA) in 1979 set off the FISA–FOCA war, during which FISA and its president Jean-Marie Balestre argued repeatedly with FOCA over television revenues and technical regulations. &quot;The Guardian&quot; said that Ecclestone and Max Mosley &quot;used [FOCA] to wage a guerrilla war with a very long-term aim in view&quot;. FOCA threatened to establish a rival series and boycotted a Grand Prix, and FISA withdrew its sanction from races. The result was the 1981 Concorde Agreement, which guaranteed technical stability, as teams were to be given reasonable notice of new regulations. Although FISA asserted its right to the TV revenues, it gave FOCA the administration of those rights.

FISA imposed a ban on ground-effect aerodynamics during . But by then, turbocharged engines, which Renault had pioneered in , were producing over and were essential to be competitive. By , a BMW turbocharged engine achieved a flash reading of pressure, estimated to be over in qualifying for the . The next year, power in race trim reached around , with boost pressure limited to only 4.0 bar. These cars were the most powerful open-wheel circuit racing cars ever. To reduce engine power output and thus speeds, the FIA limited fuel tank capacity in , and boost pressures in , before banning turbocharged engines completely in .

The development of electronic driver aids began in the 1980s. Lotus began to develop a system of active suspension, which first appeared during 1983 on the Lotus 92. By 1987, this system had been perfected and was driven to victory by Ayrton Senna in the Monaco Grand Prix that year. In the early 1990s, other teams followed suit and semi-automatic gearboxes and traction control were a natural progression. The FIA, due to complaints that technology was determining races&#x27; outcomes more than driver skill, banned many such aids for the season. This resulted in cars that previously depended on electronic aids becoming very &quot;twitchy&quot; and difficult to drive. Observers felt the ban on driver aids was in name only, as they &quot;proved difficult to police effectively&quot;.

The teams signed a second Concorde Agreement in 1992 and a third in 1997.

On the track, the McLaren and Williams teams dominated the 1980s and 1990s. Brabham was also competitive during the early 1980s, winning two Drivers&#x27; Championships with Nelson Piquet. Powered by Porsche, Honda, and Mercedes-Benz, McLaren won 16 championships (seven constructors&#x27; and nine drivers&#x27;) in that period, while Williams used engines from Ford, Honda, and Renault to also win 16 titles (nine constructors&#x27; and seven drivers&#x27;). The rivalry between racers Ayrton Senna and Alain Prost became F1&#x27;s central focus during and continued until Prost retired at the end of . Senna died at the 1994 San Marino Grand Prix after crashing into a wall on the exit of the notorious curve Tamburello. The FIA worked to improve the sport&#x27;s safety standards since that weekend, during which Roland Ratzenberger also died in an accident during Saturday qualifying. No driver died of injuries sustained on the track at the wheel of a Formula One car for 20 years until the 2014 Japanese Grand Prix, where Jules Bianchi collided with a recovery vehicle after aquaplaning off the circuit, dying nine months later from his injuries. Since 1994, three track marshals have died, one at the 2000 Italian Grand Prix, one at the 2001 Australian Grand Prix and one at the 2013 Canadian Grand Prix.

Since Senna&#x27;s and Ratzenberger&#x27;s deaths, the FIA has used safety as a reason to impose rule changes that otherwise, under the Concorde Agreement, would have had to be agreed upon by all the teams—most notably the changes introduced for . This so-called &#x27;narrow track&#x27; era resulted in cars with smaller rear tyres, a narrower track overall, and the introduction of grooved tyres to reduce mechanical grip. The objective was to reduce cornering speeds and produce racing similar to rainy conditions by enforcing a smaller contact patch between tyre and track. According to the FIA, this was to reduce cornering speeds in the interest of safety.

Results were mixed, as the lack of mechanical grip resulted in the more ingenious designers clawing back the deficit with aerodynamic grip. This resulted in pushing more force onto the tyres through wings and aerodynamic devices, which in turn resulted in less overtaking, as these devices tended to make the wake behind the car turbulent or &#x27;dirty&#x27;. This prevented other cars from following closely due to their dependence on &#x27;clean&#x27; air to make the car stick to the track. The grooved tyres also had the unfortunate side effect of initially being of a harder compound to be able to hold the grooved tread blocks, which resulted in spectacular accidents in times of aerodynamic grip failure, as the harder compound could not grip the track as well.

Drivers from McLaren, Williams, Renault (formerly Benetton), and Ferrari, dubbed the &quot;Big Four&quot;, won every World Championship from to . The teams won every Constructors&#x27; Championship from to , as well as placing themselves as the top four teams in the Constructors&#x27; Championship in every season between and , and winning every race but one (the 1996 Monaco Grand Prix) between and . Due to the technological advances of the 1990s, the cost of competing in Formula One increased dramatically, thus increasing financial burdens. This, combined with the dominance of four teams (largely funded by big car manufacturers such as Mercedes-Benz), caused the poorer independent teams to struggle not only to remain competitive but to stay in business. This effectively forced several teams to withdraw.

===Manufacturers&#x27; return===
 Michael Schumacher and Ferrari won five consecutive Drivers&#x27; Championships (2000–2004) and six consecutive Constructors&#x27; Championships (1999–2004). Schumacher set many new records, including those for Grand Prix wins (91, since beaten by Lewis Hamilton), wins in a season (13, since beaten by Max Verstappen), and most Drivers&#x27; Championships (seven, tied with Lewis Hamilton as of 2021). Schumacher&#x27;s championship streak ended on 25 September 2005, when Renault driver Fernando Alonso became Formula One&#x27;s youngest champion at that time (until Lewis Hamilton in and followed by Sebastian Vettel in 2010). During 2006, Renault and Alonso won both titles again. Schumacher retired at the end of 2006 after 16 years in Formula One, but came out of retirement for the 2010 season, racing for the newly formed Mercedes works team, following the rebrand of Brawn GP.

During this period, FIA frequently changed the championship rules with the intention of improving the on-track action and cutting costs. Team orders, legal since the championship started during 1950, were banned during 2002, after several incidents in which teams openly manipulated race results, generating negative publicity, most famously by Ferrari at the 2002 Austrian Grand Prix. Other changes included the qualifying format, the point-scoring system, the technical regulations, and rules specifying how long engines and tyres must last. A &#x27;tyre war&#x27; between suppliers Michelin and Bridgestone saw lap times fall, although, at the 2005 United States Grand Prix at Indianapolis, seven out of ten teams did not race when their Michelin tyres were deemed unsafe for use, leading to Bridgestone becoming the sole tyre supplier to Formula One for the 2007 season by default. On 20 December 2007 Bridgestone signed a contract that officially made it the exclusive tyre supplier for the next three seasons.

During 2006, Max Mosley outlined a &#x27;green&#x27; future for Formula One, in which efficient use of energy would be an important factor.

Starting in 2000, with Ford&#x27;s purchase of Stewart Grand Prix to form the Jaguar Racing team, new manufacturer-owned teams entered Formula One for the first time since Alfa Romeo&#x27;s and Renault&#x27;s departures in 1985. By 2006, the manufacturer teams—Renault, BMW, Toyota, Honda, and Ferrari—dominated the championship, taking five of the first six places in the Constructors&#x27; Championship. The exception was McLaren, which at the time was part-owned by Mercedes-Benz. Through the Grand Prix Manufacturers Association (GPMA), the manufacturers negotiated a larger share of Formula One&#x27;s commercial profit and a greater say in the running of the sport.

===Manufacturers&#x27; decline and return of the privateers===

In 2008 and 2009, Honda, BMW, and Toyota all withdrew from Formula One racing within a year, blaming the economic recession. This resulted in the end of manufacturer dominance of the sport. The Honda F1 team went through a management buyout to become Brawn GP, with Ross Brawn and Nick Fry running and owning the majority of the organisation. Brawn GP laid off hundreds of employees, but won the year&#x27;s world championships. BMW F1 was bought out by the original founder of the team, Peter Sauber. The Lotus F1 Team was another, formerly manufacturer-owned team that reverted to &quot;privateer&quot; ownership, together with the buy-out of the Renault team by Genii Capital investors. But a link with its previous owners still survived, with its car continuing to be powered by a Renault engine until 2014.

McLaren also announced that it was to reacquire the shares in its team from Mercedes-Benz (McLaren&#x27;s partnership with Mercedes was reported to have started to sour with the McLaren Mercedes SLR road car project and tough F1 championships, which included McLaren being found guilty of spying on Ferrari). Hence, during the 2010 season, Mercedes-Benz re-entered the sport as a manufacturer after it purchased Brawn GP and split with McLaren after 15 seasons with the team.

During the season, Formula One was gripped by the FIA–FOTA dispute. FIA President Max Mosley proposed numerous cost-cutting measures for the next season, including an optional budget cap for the teams; teams electing to take the budget cap would be granted greater technical freedom, adjustable front and rear wings, and an engine not subject to a rev limiter. The Formula One Teams Association (FOTA) believed that allowing some teams to have such technical freedom would have created a &#x27;two-tier&#x27; championship, and thus requested urgent talks with the FIA. But talks broke down and FOTA teams announced, with the exception of Williams and Force India, that &#x27;they had no choice&#x27; but to form a breakaway championship series.
On 24 June, Formula One&#x27;s governing body and the teams reached an agreement to prevent a breakaway series. It was agreed teams must cut spending to the level of the early 1990s within two years; exact figures were not specified, and Max Mosley agreed he would not stand for reelection to the FIA presidency in October. Following further disagreements, after Mosley suggested he would stand for reelection, FOTA made it clear that breakaway plans were still being pursued. On 8 July, FOTA issued a press release stating it had been informed it was not entered for the 2010 season, and an FIA press release said the FOTA representatives had walked out of the meeting. On 1 August, it was announced FIA and FOTA had signed a new Concorde Agreement, bringing an end to the crisis and securing the sport&#x27;s future until 2012.

To compensate for the loss of manufacturer teams, four new teams were accepted entry into the 2010 season ahead of a much anticipated &#x27;cost-cap&#x27;. Entrants included a reborn Team Lotus—led by a Malaysian consortium including Tony Fernandes, the boss of Air Asia; Hispania Racing—the first Spanish Formula One team; and Virgin Racing—Richard Branson&#x27;s entry into the series following a successful partnership with Brawn the year before. They were also joined by the US F1 Team, which planned to run out of the United States as the only non-European-based team in the sport. Financial issues befell the squad before they even made the grid. Despite the entry of these new teams, the proposed cost-cap was repealed and these teams—which did not have the budgets of the midfield and top-order teams—ran around at the back of the field until they collapsed; HRT in 2012, Caterham (formerly Lotus) in 2014 and Manor (formerly Virgin, then Marussia), having survived falling into administration in 2014, at the end of 2016.

=== Hybrid era ===
A major rule shakeup in saw the 2.4-litre naturally aspirated V8 engines replaced by 1.6-litre turbocharged hybrid power units. This prompted Honda to return to the sport in 2015 as the championship&#x27;s fourth power unit manufacturer. Mercedes emerged as the dominant force after the rule shakeup, with Lewis Hamilton winning the championship closely followed by his main rival and teammate, Nico Rosberg, with the team winning 16 out of the 19 races that season. The team continued this form in the next two seasons, again winning 16 races in before taking a record 19 wins in 2016, with Hamilton claiming the title in the former year and Rosberg winning it in the latter by five points. The 2016 season also saw a new team, Haas, join the grid, while Max Verstappen became the youngest-ever race winner at age 18 in Spain.

After revised aerodynamic regulations were introduced, the 2017 and 2018 seasons featured a title battle between Mercedes and Ferrari. Mercedes ultimately won the titles with multiple races to spare and continued to dominate in the next two years, eventually winning seven consecutive Drivers&#x27; Championships from 2014 to 2020 and eight consecutive Constructors&#x27; titles from 2014 to 2021. During this eight-year period between 2014 and 2021, a Mercedes driver won 111 of the 160 races, with Hamilton winning 81 of these and taking six Drivers&#x27; Championships during this period to equal Schumacher&#x27;s record of seven titles. In 2021, the Honda-powered Red Bull team began to seriously challenge Mercedes, with Verstappen beating Hamilton to the Drivers&#x27; Championship after a season-long battle that saw the pair exchange the championship lead multiple times.

This era has seen an increase in car manufacturer presence in the sport. After Honda&#x27;s return as an engine manufacturer in 2015, Renault came back as a team in 2016 after buying back the Lotus F1 Team. In 2018, Aston Martin and Alfa Romeo became Red Bull and Sauber&#x27;s title sponsors, respectively. Sauber was rebranded as Alfa Romeo Racing for the 2019 season, while Racing Point part-owner Lawrence Stroll bought a stake in Aston Martin to rebrand the Racing Point team as Aston Martin for 2021. In August 2020, all ten F1 teams signed a new Concorde Agreement committing them to the sport until 2025, including a $145 million budget cap for car development to support equal competition and sustainable development.

The COVID-19 pandemic forced the sport to adapt to budgetary and logistical limitations. A significant overhaul of the technical regulations intended to be introduced in the 2021 season was pushed back to 2022, with constructors instead using their 2020 chassis for two seasons and a token system limiting which parts could be modified introduced. The start of the season was delayed by several months, and both it and seasons were subject to several postponements, cancellations, and rescheduling of races due to shifting restrictions on international travel. Many races took place behind closed doors and with only essential personnel present to maintain social distancing.

In 2022, the F1 governing body announced a major rule and car design change intended to promote closer racing through the use of ground effects, new aerodynamics, larger wheels with low-profile tyres, and redesigned nose and wing regulations. Red Bull emerged as the dominant force after the rule shakeup. The 2022 and 2023 Constructors&#x27; and Drivers&#x27; Championships were won by Red Bull and Verstappen, with multiple races to spare.

In 2023 the FIA opened applications for new teams to enter Formula 1 in the then near future. Of the teams that applied, only Andretti were approved by the FIA, with them then being rejected by Formula One Management, though they have launched an appeal.

In early 2024, the Formula One landscape underwent a significant change in the sphere of team sponsorships and collaborations. Having competed for five seasons under the Alfa Romeo name, Sauber introduced a title partnership with the online casino Stake.com, resulting in the team&#x27;s new identity as Stake F1 Team Kick Sauber. Sauber will hold Stake&#x27;s sponsorship name until the end of 2025, after which it will become the Audi works team for the 2026 season onwards. Scuderia AlphaTauri, Red Bull&#x27;s junior team, dropped its name and took on sponsors from Hugo Boss and Cash App, becoming Visa Cash App RB, or VCARB for 2024. Also in 2024, Formula One announced partnerships with Mattel to release Hot Wheels die-cast cars, and with Lego, with the first new sets releasing in 2025. Previously, Lego sets based on Formula One cars had been released in 2024.

The regulations governing Formula One are set to be revised for the 2026 season, with big changes planned to help encourage closer and more competitive racing. 
Changes include: 
*Move to fully sustainable fuels,
*Reduction in width and length for closer racing
*new Front and Rear wing regulations
*Electric Motor
*MGU-K (Motor Generator Unit – Kinetic) power increased from 120 kW to 350 kW
*More stringent safety requirements
*Tighter budget caps

In November 2024, General Motors reached an agreement to enter Formula 1 in 2026 with its Cadillac brand.

==Racing and strategy==
A Formula One Grand Prix event spans a weekend. It typically begins with two free practice sessions on Friday, and one free practice session on Saturday. Additional drivers (commonly known as third drivers) are allowed to run on Fridays, but only two cars may be used per team, requiring a race driver to give up their seat. A qualifying session is held after the last free practice session. This session determines the starting order for the race on Sunday.

===Tyre rules===

Each driver may use no more than thirteen sets of dry-weather tyres, four sets of intermediate tyres, and three sets of wet-weather tyres during a race weekend.

===Qualifying===
For much of the sport&#x27;s history, qualifying sessions differed little from practice sessions; drivers would have one or more sessions in which to set their fastest time, with the grid order determined by each driver&#x27;s best single lap, with the fastest getting first place on the grid, referred to as pole position. From 1996 to 2002, the format was a one-hour shootout. This approach lasted until the end of 2002 before the rules were changed again because the teams were not running in the early part of the session to take advantage of better track conditions later on.

Grids were generally limited to 26 cars – if the race had more entries, qualification would also decide which drivers would start the race. During the early 1990s, the number of entries was so high that the worst-performing teams had to enter a pre-qualifying session, with the fastest cars allowed through to the main qualifying session. The qualifying format began to change in the early 2000s, with the FIA experimenting with limiting the number of laps, determining the aggregate time over two sessions, and allowing each driver only one qualifying lap.

The current qualifying system was adopted in the 2006 season. Known as &quot;knock-out&quot; qualifying, it is split into three periods, known as Q1, Q2, and Q3. In each period, drivers run qualifying laps to attempt to advance to the next period, with the slowest drivers being &quot;knocked out&quot; of qualification (but not necessarily the race) at the end of the period and their grid positions set within the rearmost five based on their best lap times. Drivers are allowed as many laps as they wish within each period. After each period, all times are reset, and only a driver&#x27;s fastest lap in that period (barring infractions) counts. Any timed lap started before the end of that period may be completed and will count toward that driver&#x27;s placement. The number of cars eliminated in each period is dependent on the total number of cars entered into the championship.

Currently, with 20 cars, Q1 runs for 18 minutes, and eliminates the slowest five drivers. During this period, any driver whose best lap takes longer than 107% of the fastest time in Q1 will not be allowed to start the race without permission from the stewards. Otherwise, all drivers proceed to the race albeit in the worst starting positions. This rule does not affect drivers in Q2 or Q3. In Q2, the 15 remaining drivers have 15 minutes to set one of the ten fastest times and proceed to the next period. Finally, Q3 lasts 12 minutes and sees the remaining ten drivers decide the first ten grid positions. At the beginning of the 2016 Formula 1 season, the FIA introduced a new qualifying format, whereby drivers were knocked out every 90 seconds after a certain amount of time had passed in each session. The aim was to mix up grid positions for the race, but due to unpopularity, the FIA reverted to the above qualifying format for the Chinese GP, after running the format for only two races.

Each car is allocated one set of the softest tyres for use in Q3. The cars that qualify for Q3 must return them after Q3; the cars that do not qualify for Q3 can use them during the race. As of 2022, all drivers are given a free choice of tyre to use at the start of the Grand Prix, whereas in previous years only the drivers that did not participate in Q3 had free tyre choice for the start of the race. Any penalties that affect grid position are applied at the end of qualifying. Grid penalties can be applied for driving infractions in the previous or current Grand Prix, or for changing a gearbox or engine component. If a car fails scrutineering, the driver will be excluded from qualifying but will be allowed to start the race from the back of the grid at the race stewards&#x27; discretion.

2021 saw the trialling of a &#x27;sprint qualifying&#x27; race on the Saturday of three race weekends, with the intention of testing the new approach to qualifying. The traditional qualifying would determine the starting order for the sprint, and the result of the sprint would then determine the start order for the Grand Prix. The system returned for the 2022 season, now titled the &#x27;sprint&#x27;. From 2023, sprint races no longer impacted the start order for the main race, which would be determined by traditional qualifying. Sprints would have their own qualifying session, titled the &#x27;sprint shootout&#x27;; such a system made its debut at the 2023 Azerbaijan Grand Prix and is set to be used throughout all sprint sessions in place of the traditional second free practice session. Sprint qualifying sessions are run much shorter than traditional qualifying, and each session required teams to fit new tyres – mediums for SQ1 and SQ2, and softs for SQ3 – otherwise they cannot participate in the session.

===Race===
The race begins with a warm-up lap, after which the cars assemble on the starting grid in the order they qualified. This lap is often referred to as the formation lap, as the cars lap in formation with no overtaking (although a driver who makes a mistake may regain lost ground). The warm-up lap allows drivers to check the condition of the track and their car, gives the tyres a chance to warm up to increase traction and grip, and also gives the pit crews time to clear themselves and their equipment from the grid for the race start.
Once all the cars have formed on the grid, after the medical car positions itself behind the pack, a light system above the track indicates the start of the race: five red lights are illuminated at intervals of one second; they are all then extinguished simultaneously after an unspecified time (typically less than 3 seconds) to signal the start of the race. The start procedure may be abandoned if a driver stalls on the grid or on the track in an unsafe position, signalled by raising their arm. If this happens, the procedure restarts: a new formation lap begins with the offending car removed from the grid. The race may also be restarted in the event of a serious accident or dangerous conditions, with the original start voided. The race may be started from behind the Safety Car if race control feels a racing start would be excessively dangerous, such as extremely heavy rainfall. As of the season, there will always be a standing restart. If due to heavy rainfall a start behind the safety car is necessary, then after the track has dried sufficiently, drivers will form up for a standing start. There is no formation lap when races start behind the Safety Car.

Under normal circumstances, the winner of the race is the first driver to cross the finish line having completed a set number of laps. Race officials may end the race early (putting out a red flag) due to unsafe conditions such as extreme rainfall, and it must finish within two hours, although races are only likely to last this long in the case of extreme weather or if the safety car is deployed during the race. When a situation justifies pausing the race without terminating it, the red flag is deployed; since 2005, a ten-minute warning is given before the race is resumed behind the safety car, which leads the field for a lap before it returns to the pit lane (before then the race resumed in race order from the penultimate lap before the red flag was shown).

In the 1950s, race distances varied from to . The maximum race length was reduced to in 1966 and in 1971. The race length was standardized to the current in 1989. However, street races like Monaco have shorter distances, to keep under the two-hour limit.

Drivers may overtake one another for position over the course of the race. If a leader comes across a backmarker (slower car) who has completed fewer laps, the back marker is shown a blue flag telling them that they are obliged to allow the leader to overtake them. The slower car is said to be &quot;lapped&quot; and, once the leader finishes the race, is classified as finishing the race &quot;one lap down&quot;. A driver can be lapped numerous times, by any car in front of them. A driver who fails to complete more than 90% of the race distance is shown as &quot;not classified&quot; in the results.

Throughout the race, drivers may make pit stops to change tyres and repair damage (from 1994 to 2009 inclusive, they could also refuel). Different teams and drivers employ different pit stop strategies in order to maximise their car&#x27;s potential. Three dry tyre compounds, with different durability and adhesion characteristics, are available to drivers. Over the course of a race, drivers must use two of the three available compounds. The different compounds have different levels of performance and choosing when to use which compound is a key tactical decision to make. Different tyres have different colours on their sidewalls; this allows spectators to understand the strategies.

Under wet conditions, drivers may switch to one of two specialised wet weather tyres with additional grooves (one &quot;intermediate&quot;, for mild wet conditions, such as after recent rain, one &quot;full wet&quot;, for racing in or immediately after rain). A driver must make at least one stop to use two tyre compounds; up to three stops are typically made, although further stops may be necessary to fix damage or if weather conditions change. If rain tyres are used, drivers are no longer obliged to use two types of dry tyres.

====Race director====
This role involves managing the logistics of each F1 Grand Prix, inspecting cars in parc fermé before a race, enforcing FIA rules, and controlling the lights which start each race. As the head of the race officials, the race director also plays a large role in resolving disputes among teams and drivers. The race director may also refer incidents to the race stewards, who may give penalties, such as drive-through penalties (or stop-and-go penalties), demotions on a pre-race start grid, race disqualifications and fines should parties break regulations. As of the 2024 Las Vegas Grand Prix, the race director is Rui Marques, with Herbie Blash as a permanent advisor.

====Safety car====

In the event of an incident that risks the safety of competitors or trackside race marshals, race officials may choose to deploy the safety car. This in effect suspends the race, with drivers following the safety car around the track at its speed in race order, with no overtaking permitted. Cars that have been lapped may, during the safety car period and depending on circumstances permitted by the race director, be allowed to un-lap themselves in order to ensure a smoother restart and to avoid blue flags being immediately thrown upon the resumption of the race with many of the cars in very close proximity to each other. The safety car circulates until the danger is cleared; after it comes in, the race restarts with a rolling start. Pit stops under a safety car are permitted, and in many cases can offer a great advantage to teams who are able to pit and change tyres prior to the end of the safety car period. On the lap in which the safety car returns to the pit lane, the leading car takes over the role of the safety car until the timing line. After crossing this line, drivers are allowed to start racing for track position once more.

Mercedes-Benz has supplied a variety of its AMG models to Formula One to use as the safety car since 1996. From 2021 onwards, Aston Martin has supplied the Vantage share duties with Mercedes-AMGs.

Since 2000, the main safety car driver has been German ex-racing driver Bernd Mayländer. He is usually joined by FIA technical assistant Richard Darker, who relays information between the safety car and race control.

===== Virtual Safety Car =====

Following an accident at the 2014 Japanese Grand Prix, which saw driver Jules Bianchi suffer a serious head injury that led to his death, the FIA established an &quot;accident panel&quot; to investigate the dynamics of the accident and ways to minimise the risk of a crash during similar circumstances that do not warrant the deployment of a safety car and cannot be simply managed with yellow flags. When the virtual safety car is deployed, the virtual marshal panels around the track display &quot;VSC&quot;. All drivers receive a &quot;VSC&quot; notice on their steering wheels, and they must all keep their lap times above a pre-determined minimum, also known as keeping a positive delta. The system was first implemented during the 2015 Monaco Grand Prix, before being upgraded to a full safety car, following a collision between Max Verstappen and Romain Grosjean.

=== Flags ===

Flags specifications and usage are prescribed by Appendix H of the FIA&#x27;s International Sporting Code.
The format of the race has changed little through Formula One&#x27;s history. The main changes have revolved around what is allowed at pit stops. In the early days of Grand Prix racing, a driver would be allowed to continue a race in their teammate&#x27;s car should theirs develop a problem – in the modern era, cars are so carefully fitted to drivers that this has become impossible. In recent years, the emphasis has been on changing refuelling and tyre change regulations.

Since the 2010 season, refuelling – which was reintroduced in 1994 – has not been allowed, to encourage less tactical racing following safety concerns. The rule requiring both compounds of tyre to be used during the race was introduced in 2007, again to encourage racing on the track. The safety car is another relatively recent innovation that reduced the need to deploy the red flag, allowing races to be completed on time for a growing international live television audience.

===Points system===


Various systems for awarding championship points have been used since 1950. The current system, in place since 2010, awards the top ten cars points in the Drivers&#x27; and Constructors&#x27; Championships, with the winner receiving 25 points. All points won at each race are added up, and the driver and constructor with the most points at the end of the season are crowned World Champions. Regardless of whether a driver stays with the same team throughout the season, or switches teams, all points earned by them count for the Drivers&#x27; Championship.

A driver must be classified in order to receive points, , a driver must complete at least 90% of the race distance in order to receive points. Therefore, it is possible for a driver to receive points even if they retired before the end of the race.

From some time between the 1977 and 1980 seasons to the end of the 2021 season if less than 75% of the race laps were completed by the winner, then only half of the points listed in the table were awarded to the drivers and constructors. This has happened on only five occasions in the history of the championship, and it had a notable influence on the final standing of the season. The last occurrence was at the 2021 Belgian Grand Prix when the race was called off after just three laps behind a safety car because of torrential rain. The half points rule was replaced by a distance-dependent gradual scale system for 2022.

==Constructors==

A Formula One constructor is the entity credited for designing the chassis and the engine. If both are designed by the same company, that company receives sole credit as the constructor (e.g., Ferrari). If they are designed by different companies, both are credited, and the name of the chassis designer is placed before that of the engine designer (e.g., ). All constructors are scored individually, even if they share either chassis or engine with another constructor (e.g., Williams-Ford, Williams-Honda in ).

Since , Formula One teams have been required to build the chassis in which they compete, and consequently the distinction between the terms &quot;team&quot; and &quot;constructor&quot; became less pronounced, though engines may still be produced by a different entity. This requirement distinguishes the sport from series such as the IndyCar Series which allows teams to purchase chassis, and &quot;spec series&quot; such as Formula 2 which require all cars be kept to an identical specification. It also effectively prohibits privateers, which were common even in Formula One well into the 1970s.

The sport&#x27;s debut season, , saw eighteen teams compete, but due to high costs, many dropped out quickly. In fact, such was the scarcity of competitive cars for much of the first decade of Formula One that Formula Two cars were admitted to fill the grids. Ferrari is the oldest Formula One team, the only still-active team which competed in 1950.

Early manufacturer involvement came in the form of a &quot;factory team&quot; or &quot;works team&quot; (that is, one owned and staffed by a major car company), such as those of Alfa Romeo, Ferrari, or Renault. Ferrari holds the record for having won the most Constructors&#x27; Championships (sixteen).

Companies such as Climax, Repco, Cosworth, Hart, Judd and Supertec, which had no direct team affiliation, often sold engines to teams that could not afford to manufacture them. In the early years, independently owned Formula One teams sometimes also built their engines, though this became less common with the increased involvement of major car manufacturers such as BMW, Ferrari, Honda, Mercedes-Benz, Renault, and Toyota, whose large budgets rendered privately built engines less competitive. Cosworth was the last independent engine supplier. It is estimated the major teams spend between €100 and €200 million ($125–$225 million) per year per manufacturer on engines alone.

In the 2007 season, for the first time since the 1981 rule, two teams used chassis built by other teams. Super Aguri started the season using a modified Honda Racing RA106 chassis (used by Honda the previous year), while Scuderia Toro Rosso used the same chassis used by the parent Red Bull Racing team, which was formally designed by a separate subsidiary. The usage of these loopholes was ended for 2010 with the publication of new technical regulations, which require each constructor to own the intellectual property rights to their chassis, The regulations continue to allow a team to subcontract the design and construction of the chassis to a third-party, an option used by the HRT team in 2010 and Haas currently.

Although teams rarely disclose information about their budgets, it is estimated they range from US$66 million to US$400 million each.

Entering a new team in the Formula One World Championship requires a $200 million up-front payment to the FIA, which is then shared equally among the existing teams. As a consequence, constructors desiring to enter Formula One often prefer to buy an existing team: BAR&#x27;s purchase of Tyrrell and Midland&#x27;s purchase of Jordan allowed both of these teams to sidestep the large deposit and secure the benefits the team already had, such as TV revenue.

Seven out of the ten teams competing in Formula One are based close to London in an area centred around Oxford. Ferrari have both their chassis and engine assembly in Maranello, Italy. The RB Formula One Team is based close to Ferrari in Faenza, whilst Sauber Motorsport is based near Zurich in Switzerland.

==Drivers==

Every team in Formula One must run two cars in every session in a Grand Prix weekend, and every team may use up to four drivers in a season. A team may also run two additional drivers in Free Practice sessions, which are often used to test potential new drivers for a career as a Formula One driver or gain experienced drivers to evaluate the car. Most drivers are contracted for at least the duration of a season, with driver changes taking place in-between seasons, in comparison to early years when drivers often competed on an ad hoc basis from race to race. Each competitor must be in the possession of a FIA Super Licence to compete in a Grand Prix, which is issued to drivers who have met the criteria of success in junior motorsport categories and having achieved of running in a Formula One car. Drivers may also be issued a Super Licence by the World Motor Sport Council if they fail to meet the criteria. Although most drivers earn their seat on ability, commercial considerations also come into play with teams having to satisfy sponsors and financial demands.

Teams also contract test and reserve drivers to stand in for regular drivers when necessary and develop the team&#x27;s car; although with the reduction on testing the reserve drivers&#x27; role mainly takes places on a simulator, such as &quot;rFpro&quot;, which is used by most of the F1 teams.

Each driver chooses an unassigned number from 2 to 99 (excluding 17 which was retired following the death of Jules Bianchi) upon entering Formula One and keeps that number during their time in the series. The number one is reserved for the reigning Drivers&#x27; Champion, who retains their previous number and may choose to use it instead of the number one. At the onset of the championship, numbers were allocated by race organisers on an ad hoc basis from race to race.

Permanent numbers were introduced in to take effect in , when teams were allocated numbers in ascending order based on the Constructors&#x27; Championship standings at the end of the 1973 season. The teams would hold those numbers from season to season with the exception of the team with the World Drivers&#x27; Champion, which would swap its numbers with the one and two of the previous champion&#x27;s team. New entrants were allocated spare numbers, with the exception of the number 13 which had been unused since .

As teams kept their numbers for long periods of time, car numbers became associated with a team, such as Ferrari&#x27;s 27 and 28. A different system was used from to : at the start of each season, the current Drivers&#x27; Champion was designated number one, their teammate number two, and the rest of the teams assigned ascending numbers according to previous season&#x27;s Constructors&#x27; Championship order.

, a total of 34 separate drivers have won the World Drivers&#x27; Championship, with Michael Schumacher and Lewis Hamilton holding the record for most championships with seven. Lewis Hamilton achieved the most race wins, too, in 2020. Jochen Rindt is the only posthumous World Champion, after his points total was not surpassed despite his fatal accident at the 1970 Italian Grand Prix, with 4 races still remaining in the season. Drivers from the United Kingdom have been the most successful in the sport, with 20 championships among 10 drivers, and 204 wins.

===Physical demands===

Driving in Formula One is highly demanding physically, with drivers typically burning around 1,000 calories per hour and losing of weight per race. A key reason for the physical demands is the extreme g-forces generated by driving at high speeds, with modern Formula One cars capable of generating forces of up to 6.5 &quot;g&quot;s when cornering, 6 &quot;g&quot;s when braking and 2 &quot;g&quot;s when accelerating. When a driver experiences 6 &quot;g&quot;, they will feel a force equivalent to six times their body weight; for a person weighing , this would be . Another factor is the high temperature inside the car, as the engine is mounted directly behind the driver. The temperature in the cockpit of a Formula One car can be as high as and drivers have to wear several layers of fireproof racing clothing. The steering wheel and brake pedal also require considerable strength to operate. Before the introduction of power steering in the 2000s, drivers had to cope with steering forces of up to , while achieving maximum braking power requires drivers to apply around of force to the brake pedal. Drivers also need to be light, as every extra kilogram of weight noticeably reduces performance. Drivers also need to train on cardiovascular fitness since heart rates can average more than 170 bpm during a race, this is more than a healthy adult would typically experience while running.

===Feeder series===
Most F1 drivers start in kart racing competitions and then come up through traditional European single-seater series like Formula Ford and Formula Renault to Formula 3, and finally the GP2 Series. GP2 started in 2005, replacing Formula 3000, which itself had replaced Formula Two as the last major stepping-stone into F1. GP2 was rebranded as the FIA Formula 2 Championship in 2017. Most champions from this level graduate into F1, but 2006 GP2 champion Lewis Hamilton became the first F2, F3000 or GP2 champion to win the Formula One drivers&#x27; title in 2008.

Drivers are not required to have competed at this level before entering Formula One. British F3 has supplied many F1 drivers, with champions, including Nigel Mansell, Ayrton Senna and Mika Häkkinen having moved straight from that series to Formula One, and Max Verstappen made his F1 debut following a single season in European F3. More rarely a driver may be picked from an even lower level, as was the case with 2007 World Champion Kimi Räikkönen, who went straight from Formula Renault to F1.

American open-wheel car racing has also contributed to the Formula One grid. CART champions Mario Andretti and Jacques Villeneuve became F1 World Champions, while Juan Pablo Montoya won seven races in F1. Other CART (also known as ChampCar) champions, like Michael Andretti and Alessandro Zanardi won no races in F1. Other drivers have taken different paths to F1; Damon Hill raced motorbikes, and Michael Schumacher raced in sports cars, albeit after climbing through the junior single-seater ranks. Former F1 driver Paul di Resta raced in DTM until he was signed with Force India in 2011.

==Grands Prix==
The number of Grands Prix held in a season has varied over the years. The inaugural World Championship season comprised only seven races, while the season contained 24 races, the highest number of World Championship races in one season. There were no more than 11 Grands Prix per season during the early decades of the championship, although a large number of non-championship Formula One events also took place. The number of Grands Prix increased to an average of 16 to 17 by the late 1970s, while non-championship events ended in 1983. More Grands Prix began to be held in the 2000s, and recent seasons have seen an average of 21 races. 

Six of the original seven races took place in Europe; the only non-European race that counted towards the World Championship in 1950 was the Indianapolis 500, which was held to different regulations and later replaced by the United States Grand Prix. The F1 championship gradually expanded to other non-European countries. Argentina hosted the first South American Grand Prix in , and Morocco hosted the first African World Championship race in . Asia and Oceania followed (Japan in and Australia in ), and the first race in the Middle East was held in . The 19 races of the season were spread over every populated continent except for Africa, with 10 Grands Prix held outside Europe.

Some of the Grands Prix pre-date the formation of the World Championship, such as the French Grand Prix and were incorporated into the championship as Formula One races in 1950. The British and Italian Grands Prix are the only events to have been held every Formula One season; other long-running races include the Belgian, German, and French Grands Prix. The Monaco Grand Prix was first held in 1929 and has run continuously since 1955 (with the exception of 2020) and is widely considered to be one of the most important and prestigious automobile races in the world.

All Grands Prix have traditionally been run during the day, until the inaugural hosted the first Formula One night race in 2008, which was followed by the day–night Abu Dhabi Grand Prix in 2009 and the Bahrain Grand Prix which converted to a night race in 2014. Other Grands Prix in Asia have had their start times adjusted to benefit the European television audience.

===Contracted Grands Prix===

The following twenty-four Grands Prix, all of which appeared on the schedule, have a contract to be hosted at the listed circuits for the 2025 season: 
*The Saudi Arabian Grand Prix will move to a purpose built circuit in Qiddiya in 2028.
*The Spanish Grand Prix will move to a street circuit in Madrid in 2026.

===New Locations Initiative (2008–present)===
Bold denotes the Grands Prix scheduled as part of the season.

Since 2008, the Formula One Group has been targeting new &quot;destination cities&quot; to expand its global reach, with the aim to produce races from countries that have not previously been involved in the sport. This initiative started with the 2008 Singapore Grand Prix.
==Circuits==


Formula One races must be held on Grade One tracks, the highest grade-rating issued by the FIA for tracks. The layout and lap distance of each circuit can vary significantly as long as they stay within the FIA&#x27;s regulations. In most cases, the tracks run in a clockwise direction, although there are a handful of tracks in the Championship that run anticlockwise.

A typical circuit features a stretch of straight road on which the starting grid is situated, with the pit lane normally located right next to it. The pit lane is home to each team&#x27;s garage, where cars are stored and serviced before a race. During a pit stop, drivers enter the pit lane to change their tyres, receive repairs or aerodynamic adjustments from their pit crew, or retire from the race (if the car is in a condition to do so). Prior to the 2010 season, pit stops also facilitated mid-race refueling of the cars. Special pit roads and track markings help to make sure drivers pit and rejoin the track safely.

Most of the circuits currently in use are specially constructed for competition, but the calendar also features several circuits that use converted public streets to varying degrees. These tracks include Monaco, Melbourne, Singapore, Baku, Miami, Jeddah, and Las Vegas. Three-time World champion Nelson Piquet famously described racing in Monaco as &quot;like riding a bicycle around your living room&quot;. The Monaco Grand Prix holds a unique exception to the FIA&#x27;s minimum race distance requirement—the Grand Prix only needs to last enough laps to cover a distance of 260 km, versus the standard 305 km.

Circuit design to protect the safety of drivers is becoming increasingly sophisticated, as exemplified by the Bahrain International Circuit, added in and designed – like most of F1&#x27;s new circuits – by Hermann Tilke. Several of the new circuits in F1, especially those designed by Tilke, have been criticised as lacking the &quot;flow&quot; of such classics as Spa-Francorchamps and Imola. His redesign of the Hockenheim circuit in Germany for example, while providing more capacity for grandstands and eliminating extremely long and dangerous straights, has been frowned upon by many who argue that part of the character of the Hockenheim circuits was the long and blinding straights into dark forest sections. These newer circuits, however, are generally agreed to meet the safety standards of modern Formula One better than the older ones.

The Circuit of the Americas in Austin, the Sochi Autodrom in Sochi and the Baku City Circuit in Azerbaijan have all been introduced as brand new tracks since 2012. In 2020, Algarve International Circuit debuted on the F1 calendar as the venue of the Portuguese Grand Prix, with the country having last hosted a race in 1996. In 2021, Circuit Zandvoort returned to the F1 calendar as the Dutch Grand Prix, having last hosted a race in 1985. The Las Vegas Grand Prix entered the sport in 2023.

==Cars and technology==
Modern Formula One cars are mid-engined, hybrid, semi-open cockpit, open-wheel single-seaters. The chassis is made largely of carbon-fibre composites, rendering it light but extremely stiff and strong. The whole car, including the driver but not fuel, weighs only – the minimum weight set by the regulations. If the construction of the car is lighter than the minimum, it can be ballasted up to add the necessary weight. The race teams take advantage of this by placing this ballast at the extreme bottom of the chassis, thereby locating the centre of gravity as low as possible in order to improve handling and weight transfer.

The cornering speed of Formula One cars is largely determined by the aerodynamic downforce that they generate, which pushes the car down onto the track. This is provided by &quot;wings&quot; mounted at the front and rear of the vehicle, and by ground effect created by low air pressure under the flat bottom of the car. The aerodynamic design of the cars is very heavily constrained to limit performance. The previous generation of cars sported a large number of small winglets, &quot;barge boards&quot;, and turning vanes designed to closely control the flow of the air over, under, and around the car.

The other major factor controlling the cornering speed of the cars is the design of the tyres. From to , the tyres in Formula One were not &quot;slicks&quot; (tyres with no tread pattern) as in most other circuit racing series. Instead, each tyre had four large circumferential grooves on its surface designed to limit the cornering speed of the cars. Slick tyres returned to Formula One in the season. Suspension is double wishbone or multilink front and rear, with pushrod operated springs and dampers on the chassis – one exception being that of the 2009 specification Red Bull Racing car (RB5) which used pullrod suspension at the rear, the first car to do so since the Minardi PS01 in 2001. Ferrari used a pullrod suspension at both the front and rear in their car. Both Ferrari (F138) and McLaren (MP4-28) of the 2013 season used a pullrod suspension at both the front and the rear. In , McLaren (MCL36) and Red Bull Racing (RB18) switched to a pullrod front suspension and push rod rear suspension.

Carbon-carbon disc brakes are used for reduced weight and increased frictional performance. These provide a very high level of braking performance and are usually the element that provokes the greatest reaction from drivers new to the formula. The carbon material enhances the brakes by maintaining an effective performance under extreme heat. To optimise this, the brakes feature 1,000 ventilation holes, ensuring for maximum performance and cooling.

In , the technical regulations changed considerably in order to reduce the turbulence (commonly referred to as &quot;dirty air&quot;) produced by the aerodynamics of the car. This includes a redesigned front and rear wing, larger wheels with a lower tyre profile, wheel covers, small winglets, the banning of barge boards, and the reintroduction of Ground effect downforce production. These have been changed to promote racing, meaning cars lose less downforce when following another car. It allows cars to follow another at a much closer distance, without extending the gap due to the turbulent air. (See 2022 Formula One World Championship Technical regulations)

Formula One cars must have four wheels made of the same metallic material, which must be one of two magnesium alloys specified by the FIA. Magnesium alloy wheels made by forging are used to achieve maximum unsprung rotating weight reduction. As of 2022, the wheels are covered with &quot;spec&quot; (Standardised) Wheel Covers, the wheel diameter has increased from 13 inches to 18 inches (reducing the &quot;tyre profile&quot;), and small winglets have been placed over the front tyres.
Starting with the 2014 Formula 1 season, the engines have changed from a 2.4-litre naturally aspirated V8 to turbocharged 1.6-litre V6 power-units. These get a significant amount of their power from electric motors. In addition, they include a lot of energy recovery technology. Engines run on unleaded fuel closely resembling publicly available petrol. The oil which lubricates and protects the engine from overheating is very similar in viscosity to water. The 2006 generation of engines spun up to 20,000 rpm and produced over . For , engines were restricted to 19,000 rpm with limited development areas allowed, following the engine specification freeze since the end of . For the 2009 Formula One season the engines were further restricted to 18,000 rpm.

A wide variety of technologies – including active suspension are banned under the current regulations. Despite this the current generation of cars can reach speeds in excess of at some circuits. The highest straight line speed recorded during a Grand Prix was , set by Juan Pablo Montoya during the 2005 Italian Grand Prix. During qualifying for the 2016 European Grand Prix, Valtteri Bottas set a record top speed of 378 km/h (234.9 mph). A BAR-Honda Formula One car, running with minimum downforce on a runway in the Mojave Desert achieved a top speed of in 2006. According to Honda, the car fully met the FIA Formula One regulations.

Even with the limitations on aerodynamics, at aerodynamically generated downforce is equal to the weight of the car, and the oft-repeated claim that Formula One cars create enough downforce to &quot;drive on the ceiling&quot;, while possible in principle, has never been put to the test. Downforce of 2.5 times the car&#x27;s weight can be achieved at full speed. The downforce means that the cars can achieve a lateral force with a magnitude of up to 3.5 times that of the force of gravity (3.5g) in cornering. Consequently, the driver&#x27;s head is pulled sideways with a force equivalent to the weight of 20 kg in corners. Such high lateral forces are enough to make breathing difficult and the drivers need supreme concentration and fitness to maintain their focus for the one to two hours that it takes to complete the race. A high-performance road car like the Enzo Ferrari only achieves around 1g.

, each team may have no more than two cars available for use at any time. Each driver may use no more than four engines during a championship season unless they drive for more than one team. If more engines are used, they drop ten places on the starting grid of the event at which an additional engine is used. The only exception is where the engine is provided by a manufacturer or supplier taking part in its first championship season, in which case up to five may be used by a driver. Each driver may use no more than one gearbox for six consecutive events; every unscheduled gearbox change requires the driver to drop five places on the grid unless they failed to finish the previous race due to reasons beyond the team&#x27;s control.

, each driver is limited to three power units per season, before incurring grid penalties.

==Revenue and profits==
In March 2007, &quot;F1 Racing&quot; published its annual estimates of spending by Formula One teams. The total spending of all eleven teams in 2006 was estimated at $2.9 billion US. This was broken down as follows: Toyota $418.5 million, Ferrari $406.5 m, McLaren $402 m, Honda $380.5 m, BMW Sauber $355 m, Renault $324 m, Red Bull $252 m, Williams $195.5 m, Midland F1/Spyker-MF1 $120 m, Toro Rosso $75 m, and Super Aguri $57 million.

Costs vary greatly from team to team. Honda, Toyota, McLaren-Mercedes, and Ferrari were estimated to have spent approximately $200 million on engines in 2006, Renault spent approximately $125 million and Cosworth&#x27;s 2006 V8 was developed for $15 million. In contrast to the 2006 season on which these figures are based, the 2007 sporting regulations banned all performance-related engine development.

Formula One teams pay entry fees of $500,000, plus $5,000 per point scored the previous year or $6,000 per point for the winner of the Constructors&#x27; Championship. Formula One drivers pay a FIA Super Licence fee, which in 2013 was €10,000 plus €1,000 per point.

There have been controversies with the way profits are shared among the teams. The smaller teams have complained that the profits are unevenly shared, favouring established top teams. In September 2015, Force India and Sauber officially lodged a complaint with the European Union against Formula One questioning the governance and stating that the system of dividing revenues and determining the rules is unfair and unlawful.

The cost of building a brand-new permanent circuit can be up to hundreds of millions of dollars, while the cost of converting a public road, such as Albert Park, into a temporary circuit is much less. Permanent circuits, however, can generate revenue all year round from leasing the track for private races and other races, such as MotoGP. The Shanghai International Circuit cost over $300 million and the Istanbul Park circuit cost $150 million to build.

A number of Formula One drivers earn the highest salary of any drivers in auto racing. The highest-paid driver in 2021 is Lewis Hamilton, who received $55 million in salary from Mercedes AMG Petronas F1 – a record for any driver. The very top Formula One drivers get paid more than IndyCar or NASCAR drivers; however, the earnings immediately fall off after the top three F1 drivers, and the majority of NASCAR racers will make more money than their F1 counterparts. Most top IndyCar drivers are paid around a tenth of their Formula One counterparts.

In the second quarter of 2020, Formula One reported a loss revenue of $122 million and an income of $24 million. This was a result of the delay of the racing championship start as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The company grossed revenues of $620 million for the same quarter the previous year.

=== Cost cap ===
Since the beginning of Formula 1 back in 1950, the sport&#x27;s governing body has not had any regulations limiting the spending of a team. This has led to a pattern where teams with large budgets perform significantly better than their competitors and the gap has only continued to increase.

For instance, in 2019, the richest teams such as Mercedes and Ferrari spent $420 million and $435 million respectively, whereas teams such as Williams or Haas, only spent $125 million and $150 million respectively. This gap was widening by the season and disparities like this prompted the FIA to introduce a cost cap in February 2021.

The FIA proposed the cost cap as a measure to reward engineering prowess over sheer expenditure. They did this in an effort to bridge the gap between the midfield teams and the teams challenging for the driver&#x27;s and constructors&#x27; titles.

The cap was $175 million in 2021, although was reduced further to $145 million in response to economic turmoil due to the COVID-19 pandemic. For 2022, the cost cap was further reduced to $140 million and in 2023 it fell to $135 million where it will remain for the 2024 and 2025 seasons.

The 2022 season served as a critical test for the effectiveness of the cost cap as it was the year the new regulations were introduced, allowing all teams to start from scratch and build a car that was independent of the previous years. Critics have argued that the cap might not be sufficient enough to close the gap in competition because it excluded certain expenses like driver salaries, compensation for the three highest paid-staff members, and marketing costs along with loopholes that allowed the likes of Adrian Newey&#x27;s salary of Red Bull to be excluded from the cost cap. They also contended that established teams could exploit existing infrastructures and resources accumulated over years, thus maintaining their competitive edge despite the spending limits.

However, an alternative perspective highlights that the cost cap encourages teams to maximise efficiency and foster innovation within their financial means. McLaren started the 2023 season as the slowest car on the track, with their drivers finishing outside the points with Lando Norris at P17 and Oscar Piastri at P20. Seven months later, with the right upgrades, they managed to be the fastest car on the grid throughout qualifying and race pace. Facing budgetary constraints similar to their competitors, McLaren focused on strategic engineering upgrades and talent development. Their significant mid-season improvements led to notable on-track success, demonstrating that with clever resource management and engineering talent, teams can challenge the dominance of traditionally wealthier competitors.

McLaren CEO Zak Brown said that &quot;the cap has been outstanding for the sport.&quot; He also went on to say that there is a feeling that at any point in the season, any team can challenge for a place it wasn&#x27;t equipped to do so at the start of the season.

The critics have expressed that the impact of the cost cap suggests that engineering excellence and strategic ingenuity can indeed offset the advantages of larger budgets. By promoting a more balanced competitive environment, the cost cap has made Formula 1 more exciting for fans and more viable for teams.

==Future==

The expense of Formula One has seen the FIA and the Formula One Commission attempt to create new regulations to lower the costs for a team to compete in the sport.

Following their purchase of the commercial rights to the sport in 2017, Liberty Media announced their vision for the future of Formula One at the 2018 Bahrain Grand Prix. The proposal identified five key areas, including streamlining the governance of the sport, emphasising cost-effectiveness, maintaining the sport&#x27;s relevance to road cars and encouraging new manufacturers to enter the championship whilst enabling them to be competitive.

On 19 August 2020, it was announced that all 10 teams had signed the new Concorde Agreement. This came into effect at the start of the 2021 season and changed how prize money and TV revenue is distributed.

===Environmental impact===
Formula One has initiated a plan to become carbon neutral by 2030. By 2025, all events should become &quot;sustainable&quot;, including eliminating single-use plastics and ensuring all waste is reused, recycled or composted.

A report conducted by Formula One estimated that the series was responsible for 256,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions in the 2019 season, finding that 45% of emissions were from logistics and only 0.7% were from emissions from the cars themselves.

In January 2020, FIA and Formula One signed the United Nations &quot;Sports for Climate Action&quot; framework. After the signing was announced, FIA President Jean Todt said: &quot;As an international Federation comprising 244 members in 140 countries and the leader in motor sport and mobility development, we are fully committed to global environmental protection. The signing of this UN Sports for Climate Action Framework reinforces the momentum that has been growing in our Federation for many years. Since the introduction of the hybrid power unit in F1 to the creation of the Environment and Sustainability Commission, the entire FIA community has been investing time, energy and financial resources to the benefit of environmental innovations. We aim to inspire greater awareness and best practice in sustainability motor sport standards.&quot;

From the 2021–22 season, all cars will increase the bio-component of their fuel, using E10 fuel, rather than the 5.75% of ethanol currently used. This percentage is expected to grow again in the future. In December 2020, the FIA claimed that it had developed a fuel with 100% sustainability, to be used in Formula One from either 2025 or 2026, when new engine regulations come into force.

=== Social inequities ===
Prior to the beginning of the 2020 Formula One World Championship, F1 announced and launched the #WeRaceAsOne initiative. The initiative primarily focuses on visible displays of solidarity in the fight against racism on Grand Prix Weekends, as well as the creation of a Formula 1 Task Force that will &quot;listen to people from across the paddock [...] and make conclusions on the actions required to improve the diversity and opportunity in Formula 1 at all levels&quot;. The move spurs from the growing questions about racism and global inequalities perpetuated by the sport. The 70-year history of the World Championship has been dominated by European and white drivers, with the first (and only) black driver, Lewis Hamilton, participating in the world championship since 2007.

In addition to organization-wide measures, individual teams have also acknowledged deficiencies in the sport&#x27;s cultural and political activism. During the 2020 season, the Mercedes-AMG Petronas F1 Team conducted a study of its racial composition and found that approximately 95% of its workforce was white. Due to the results of the study, the team changed the car&#x27;s livery to promote anti-racism messages and also launched the Accelerate 25 programme. The program vows that approximately 25% of all new hires to the team will come from underrepresented minorities in the sport until 2025.

The 20 drivers on the grid have also stood in solidarity on multiple occasions in the fight against racism both on and off the track. Following the murder of George Floyd in the summer of 2020, all twenty drivers wore &quot;End Racism&quot; shirts and took part in an organised anti-racism protest during the pre-race formalities. In the year since, Lewis Hamilton has remained vocal in his pre-race attire, with other drivers occasionally wearing change-demanding clothing.

== Women in Formula One ==
Since the creation of Formula One, in 1950, there have been five women to compete in a Grand Prix, and only one managed to score. The involvement of women in the Formula One paddock ranges from race engineers and strategists to media and communications personnel. With the release of the Netflix show, &quot;Drive to Survive&quot;, the female viewership of the sport has risen. In 2019 20% of the total Formula One viewership was female, and by 2022 this number had increased to 40%.

=== F1 Academy ===
F1 Academy, created by Formula One in 2023, is the only female single-seater racing championship. Its inaugural championship was won by Marta García of Prema Racing. The establishment of F1 Academy has attracted significant levels of attention to women in motorsport; Netflix has announced the release of a docuseries in 2025 about the academy. In addition to this companies such as Tommy Hilfiger, Charlotte Tilbury, Puma, and Red Bull have become sponsors of F1 Academy due to its increasing popularity.

=== Female Formula One drivers ===
Maria Teresa de Filippis was the first female to compete in a Formula One Grand Prix at the 1958 Monaco Grand Prix. She competed in a total of five Grand Prix, racing under the Italian flag and has been hailed a pioneer of women in motorsport.

Lella Lombardi is the only female to place within the points at a Formula One Grand Prix. She competed in three seasons, entering seventeen races, and starting twelve. After finishing sixth in the 1975 Spanish Grand Prix, Lombardi became the first and only female to score points during an official Formula Grand Prix. Due to the race not reaching full completion half points were awarded and Lombardi only gained .5 points.

Desiré Wilson the only woman to win a Formula One race of any kind, winning the second round of the 1980 Aurora AFX F1 Championship.

Giovanna Amati was the last female driver to attempt to qualify for a Formula One Grand Prix. In 1992, she was signed by Brabham and participated in three races—South Africa, Mexico, and Brazil—but failed to qualify for any of them. Amati faced significant challenges, including an underperforming car and limited testing opportunities. She was replaced by Damon Hill after Brabham struggled with financial difficulties and performance issues. Despite not making a race start, her entry remains significant, as no woman has attempted to qualify for a Grand Prix since. Her participation also marked the last time a female driver was officially listed on an F1 entry list until Susie Wolff took part in free practice sessions for Williams in 2014.

=== Race engineers ===
Hannah Schmitz currently holds the role of principal strategy engineer at Red Bull Racing. She has been with the team since 2009 and played a strong presence in its victories in 2021, 2022, and 2023. In 2023 Schmitz won the McLaren Applied Female Engineer of the Year Award winner for her role within Red Bull Racing.

=== Team principals ===
Susie Wolff is the current managing director of F1 Academy, however her presence within the Formula One paddock has lasted several decades. In the beginning of her career she was told to drive a pink car, although she was skeptical, Wolff obliged figuring that young girls would see the car and feel more inspired to begin racing. In 2012 Wolff was a Williams Grand Prix Engineering development driver, during her four years at Williams, she competed in several free practice sessions for the team. After her time at Williams, Wolff became the team principal of Formula E team Venturi Racing, and saw the team to their most successful season to date.

Austrian Monisha Kaltenborn became the sport&#x27;s first ever female Team principal when she took over the role at Sauber Formula 1 Team in 2010.

==Media coverage==

Formula One is broadcast live, or tape delayed in almost every country and territory and attracts one of the largest global television audiences. The 2008 season attracted a global audience of 600 million people per race. The cumulative television audience was calculated to be 54 billion for the 2001 season, broadcast to 200 territories.

During the early 1990s, Formula One Group created a number of trademarks, an official logo, an official TV graphics package and in 2003, an official website for the sport in an attempt to give it a corporate identity.

TV stations all take what is known as the &quot;World Feed&quot;, either produced historically by the &quot;host broadcaster&quot; or by Formula One Management (FOM). The host broadcaster either had one feed for all, or two separate feeds – a feed for local viewers and a feed for international viewers. The one size fits all approach meant that there was bias to a certain team or driver during the event, which led to viewers missing out on more important action and incidents, while the two-feed approach meant that replays (for when returning from an ad break) and local bias action could be overlaid on the local feed while the international feed was left unaffected.

The only station that differed from this set up was &quot;DF1&quot; (re-branded to &quot;Premiere&quot; then to &quot;Sky Deutschland&quot;) – a German channel which offers all sessions live and interactive, with features such as the onboard and pit-lane channels. This service was purchased by Bernie Ecclestone at the end of 1996 and became F1 Digital Plus, which was made more widely available around Europe until the end of 2002, when the cost of the digital interactive service was thought too much.

On 12 January 2011, F1 announced that it would adopt the HD format for the 2011 season.

It was announced on 29 July 2011, that Sky Sports and the BBC would team up to show the races in F1 from 2012 to 2018. Sky launched a dedicated channel, Sky Sports F1 which covered all races live without commercial interruption as well as live practice and qualifying sessions, along with F1 programming, including interviews, archive action and magazine shows. In 2012 the BBC broadcast live coverage of half of the races in the season. The BBC ended its television contract after the 2015 season, three years earlier than planned. The free-to-air TV rights were picked up by Channel 4 until the end of the 2018 season. Sky Sports F1 coverage remained unaffected and BBC Radio 5 Live and 5 Sports Extra coverage was extended until 2021. As of 2022, BBC Radio 5 Live and 5 Sports Extra has rights to such coverage until 2024.

While Sky Sports and Channel 4 are the two major broadcasters of Formula 1, other countries show Formula One races. Many use commentary from either Sky Sports or Channel 4. In most of Asia (excluding China), the two main broadcasters of Formula One includes the Fox network and Star Sports (in India). In the United States, ESPN holds the official rights to broadcast the sport while ABC also holds free-to-air rights for some races under the ESPN on ABC banner. In Germany, Austria and Switzerland, the two main broadcasters are RTL Germany and n-TV. In China, there are multiple channels that broadcast Formula One which include CCTV, Tencent, Guangdong TV and Shanghai TV. Currently in France, the only channel that broadcasts Formula One is the pay TV channel Canal+, having renewed its broadcasting rights until 2024.

The official Formula One website has live timing charts that can be used during the race to follow the leaderboard in real time. An official application has been available for the Apple App Store since 2009, and on Google Play since 2011, that shows users a real-time feed of driver positions, timing and commentary. On 26 November 2017 Formula One unveiled a new logo, which replaced the previous &quot;flying one&quot; in use since 1993.

In March 2018, FOM announced the launch of F1 TV, an over-the-top streaming platform that lets viewers watch multiple simultaneous video feeds and timing screens in addition to traditional directed race footage and commentary. In April 2024, FOM launched a free ad-supported streaming television channel known as the Formula 1 Channel in the United States, which shows classic Grands Prix, documentaries and analysis from past races.

==Distinction between Formula One and World Championship races==

Currently, the terms &quot;Formula One race&quot; and &quot;World Championship race&quot; are effectively synonymous. Since 1984, every Formula One race has counted towards the World Championship, and every World Championship race has been run to Formula One regulations. However, the two terms are not interchangeable.
* The first Formula One race was held in 1946, whereas the World Championship did not start until 1950.
* In the 1950s and 1960s, there were many Formula One races that did not count for the World Championship; in 1950, a total of twenty-two Formula One races were held, of which only six counted towards the World Championship. The number of non-championship Formula One events decreased throughout the 1970s and 1980s, to the point where the last non-championship Formula One race was the 1983 Race of Champions.
* The World Championship was not always exclusively composed of Formula One events:
** The World Championship was originally established as the &quot;World Championship for Drivers&quot;, i.e. without the term &quot;Formula One&quot; in the title. It only officially became the FIA Formula One World Championship in 1981.
** From 1950 to 1960, the Indianapolis 500 race counted towards the World Championship. This race was run to American Automobile Association, and later United States Automobile Club, Championship Car regulations, rather than to Formula One regulations. Only one of the World Championship regulars, Alberto Ascari in 1952, started at Indianapolis during this period.
** From 1952 to 1953, all races counting towards the World Championship (except the Indianapolis 500) were run to Formula Two regulations. Formula One was not changed to Formula Two during this period; the Formula One regulations remained the same, and numerous non-championship Formula One races were staged during this time.

The distinction is most relevant when considering career summaries and all-time lists. For example, in the List of Formula One drivers, Clemente Biondetti is shown with a single race against his name. Biondetti actually competed in four Formula One races in 1950, but only one of these counted for the World Championship.

In the earlier history of Formula One, many races took place outside the World Championship, and local championships run to Formula One regulations also occurred. These events often took place on circuits that were not always suitable for the World Championship and featured local cars and drivers as well as those competing in the championship.

===European non-championship racing===
In the early years of Formula One, before the world championship was established, there were around twenty races held from late Spring to early Autumn in Europe, although not all of these were considered significant. Most competitive cars came from Italy, particularly Alfa Romeo. After the start of the world championship, these non-championship races continued. In the 1950s and 1960s, there were many Formula One races which did not count for the World Championship; in a total of twenty-two Formula One races were held, of which only six counted towards the World Championship. In 1952 and 1953, when the world championship was run to Formula Two regulations, non-championship events were the only Formula One races that took place.

Some races, particularly in the UK, including the Race of Champions, Oulton Park International Gold Cup and the International Trophy, were attended by the majority of the world championship contenders. Other smaller events were regularly held in locations not part of the championship, such as the Syracuse and Danish Grands Prix, although these only attracted a small amount of the championship teams and relied on private entries and lower Formula cars to make up the grid. These became less common through the 1970s and 1983 saw the last non-championship Formula One race; the 1983 Race of Champions at Brands Hatch, won by reigning World Champion Keke Rosberg in a Williams-Cosworth in a close fight with American Danny Sullivan.

===South African Formula One championship===
South Africa&#x27;s domestic Formula One championship ran from 1960 through to 1975. The frontrunning cars in the series were recently retired from the world championship although there were also locally built or modified cars.

===British Formula One Championship===
The DFV helped in making the UK domestic Formula One championship possible between 1978 and 1980. As in South Africa a decade before, second-hand cars from manufacturers like Lotus and Fittipaldi Automotive were the order of the day, although some, such as the March 781, were built specifically for the series. In 1980, the series saw South African Desiré Wilson become the only woman to win a Formula One race when she triumphed at Brands Hatch in a Wolf WR3.

<text>Franchino Baresi (; born 8 May 1960) is an Italian football youth team coach and a former player and manager. He mainly played as a sweeper or as a central defender, and spent his entire 20-year career with Serie A club AC Milan, captaining the club for 15 seasons. He is considered to be one of the best defenders of all time. He was ranked 19th in &quot;World Soccer&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the 100 greatest players of the 20th century. With Milan, he won three UEFA Champions League titles, six Serie A titles, four Supercoppa Italiana titles, two European Super Cups and two International Cups, as well as a World Cup with Italy.

With the Italy national team, he was a member of the Italian squad that won the 1982 FIFA World Cup. He also played in the 1990 World Cup, where he was named in the FIFA World Cup All-Star Team, finishing third in the competition. At the 1994 World Cup, he was named Italy&#x27;s captain and was part of the squad that reached the final, although he would miss a penalty in the resulting shoot-out as Brazil lifted the trophy. Baresi also represented Italy at two UEFA European Championships, in 1980 and 1988, and at the 1984 Olympics, reaching the semi-finals on each occasion.

The younger brother of former footballer Giuseppe Baresi, after joining the Milan senior team as a youngster, Franco Baresi was initially nicknamed &quot;Piscinin&quot;, Milanese for &quot;little one&quot;. Due to his skill and success, he was later known as &quot;Kaiser Franz&quot;, a reference to fellow sweeper Franz Beckenbauer. In 1999, he was voted Milan&#x27;s Player of the Century. After his final season at Milan in 1997, the club retired Baresi&#x27;s shirt number 6. He was named by Pelé one of the 125 Greatest Living Footballers at the FIFA centenary awards ceremony in 2004. Baresi was inducted into the Italian Football Hall of Fame in 2013.

==Early life==
Baresi grew up in a farmstead on the outskirts of a small north Italian town, Travagliato. He did not watch football on television until he was 10.

==Club career==
Originally an AC Milan youth product, Baresi went on to spend his entire 20-year professional career with Milan, making his Serie A debut at age 17 during the 1977–78 season on 23 April 1978. He had initially been rejected by the Internazionale youth team, who chose his brother Giuseppe instead, hence the Milan youth team signed Franco Baresi. The two brothers ended up captaining their respective teams shortly after, with their image while exchanging pennants became the trademark of Milan&#x27;s &quot;derby della Madonnina&quot; throughout the 80s.

The following season, he was made a member of the starting 11, playing as a sweeper or as a centreback, winning the 1978–79 Serie A title, Milan&#x27;s tenth overall, playing alongside Fabio Capello and Gianni Rivera.
This success was soon followed by a dark period in the club&#x27;s history, when Milan was relegated to Serie B twice during the early 1980s. Milan were relegated in 1980 for being involved in the match fixing scandal of 1980, and once again after finishing third-last in the 1981–82 season, after having just returned to Serie A the previous season, after winning the 1980–81 Serie B title. Despite being a member of the Euro 1980 Italy squad that had finished fourth, and the 1982 World Cup-winning team, Baresi elected to stay with Milan, winning the Serie B title for the second time during the 1982–83 season and bringing Milan back to Serie A. After Aldo Maldera and Fulvio Collovati left the club in 1982, Baresi was appointed Milan&#x27;s captain, at age 22, and would hold this position for much of his time at the club, becoming a symbol and a leader for the team. During this bleak period for Milan, Baresi did manage to win a Mitropa Cup in 1982 and reached the Coppa Italia final during 1984–85 season, although the team failed to dominate in Serie A.
During the end of the 1980s and the first half of the 1990s, Baresi was at the heart of a notable all-Italian defence alongside Paolo Maldini, Alessandro Costacurta, Mauro Tassotti and later Christian Panucci, under managers Arrigo Sacchi and Fabio Capello, a defence which is regarded by many as one of the greatest of all time. When the attacking Dutch trio of Marco van Basten, Ruud Gullit and Frank Rijkaard arrived at the club in the late 1980s, Milan began a period of domestic and international triumphs, and between 1987 and 1996, at the height of the club&#x27;s success, the Milan squad contained many Italian and international stars, such as Roberto Donadoni, Carlo Ancelotti, Marco van Basten, Ruud Gullit, Frank Rijkaard and later Demetrio Albertini, Dejan Savićević, Zvonimir Boban, Marcel Desailly, George Weah, Jean-Pierre Papin, Brian Laudrup and Roberto Baggio. Under Sacchi, Milan won the Serie A title in 1987–88, with Baresi helping Milan to concede only 14 goals. This title was immediately followed by a Supercoppa Italiana in 1988 the next season, and back-to-back European Cups in 1988–89 and 1989–90; In the 1990 European Cup Final, Baresi turned in a dominant performance as the team&#x27;s captain, helping Milan to defend the European Cup title and keep a clean sheet in a 1–0 victory over Benfica. Baresi was also runner-up to teammate Van Basten for the Ballon d&#x27;Or in 1989, finishing ahead of his other teammate Frank Rijkaard, and was named Serie A Footballer of the Year in 1989–90. Milan also reached the Coppa Italia final during the 1989–90 season.

Baresi went on to win four more Serie A titles with Milan under Fabio Capello, including three consecutive titles in 1991–92, 1992–93 and the 1993–94 seasons. Baresi helped Milan win the 1991–92 title undefeated, helping Milan to go unbeaten for an Italian record of 58 matches. Milan also scored a record 74 goals that season. During the 1993–94 season, Baresi helped Milan concede a mere 15 goals in Serie A, helping the club to finish the season with the best defence. Baresi also won three consecutive Supercoppa Italiana under Capello, in 1992, 1993 and 1994. Milan also reached three consecutive UEFA Champions League finals during the 1992–93, 1993–94 and 1994–95 seasons, losing to Marseille in 1992–93 and Ajax in 1994–95. Baresi won the third European Cup/UEFA Champions League of his career in 1993–94 when Milan defeated Johan Cruyff&#x27;s Barcelona &quot;Dream Team&quot; 4–0 in the final. Baresi also managed to win the 1994 European Super Cup, although Milan were defeated in the 1994 Intercontinental Cup, the 1993 European Super Cup and the 1993 Intercontinental Cup. Under Capello, Milan and Baresi were able to capture another Serie A title during 1995–96 season, Baresi&#x27;s sixth.

Baresi retired at the end of the 1996–97 Serie A season, at age 37. In his 20 seasons with Milan, he won six Serie A titles, three European Cup/UEFA Champions League titles (reaching five finals in total), two Intercontinental Cups (four finals in total), three European Supercups (four finals in total), four Supercoppa Italiana (five finals in total), two Serie B titles and a Mitropa Cup. He scored 31 goals for Milan, 21 of which were on penalties, and, despite being a defender, he was the top scorer of the Coppa Italia during the 1989–90 season, the only trophy which he failed to win with Milan, reaching the final twice during his career. His final goal for Milan was scored in a 2–1 win against Padova on 27 August 1995. In his honour, Milan retired his number 6 shirt, which he had worn throughout his career. The captain&#x27;s armband, which he had worn for 15 seasons, was handed over to Paolo Maldini. Milan organised a celebration match in his honour, which was played on 28 October 1997 at the San Siro, featuring many footballing stars.

==International career==
At age 20, while still playing in the Italy under-21 side, Baresi was named in Italy&#x27;s 22-man squad for the 1980 European Championship (along with his older brother Giuseppe) by manager Enzo Bearzot. The tournament was held on home soil and Italy finished fourth. However, unlike his brother, Franco Baresi did not play a single match in the tournament. Euro 1980 would be the only time the two brothers were on the Italy squad together at a major tournament. At age 22, Baresi was named in Italy&#x27;s squad for the 1982 FIFA World Cup. The &quot;Azzurri&quot; won their third World Cup, defeating West Germany in the final, but Baresi, once again, was not selected to play a match throughout the tournament. Baresi was also a member of the Italy squad that took part in the 1984 Olympics. Italy finished in fourth place after a semi-final defeat to Brazil, and losing the bronze medal match to Yugoslavia. Baresi scored a goal against the United States during the group stage.

Baresi won his first senior international cap in a 1984 UEFA Championship qualifying match against Romania in Florence, on 14 December 1982, a 0–0 draw. Italy, however, ultimately failed to qualify for the final tournament.

Baresi was not included in Italy&#x27;s squad for the 1986 World Cup by coach Enzo Bearzot, who saw him as being more of a midfielder than a defender (although his brother Giuseppe was selected as a defender for the World Cup, as well as Roberto Tricella). He returned to the team for the 1988 European Championship, playing as a sweeper, where Italy reached the semi-finals under Azeglio Vicini, becoming an undisputed first team member and playing in every match. He made his first appearance in a World Cup finals match in the 1990 tournament, which was held on home soil, and he played in every match as one of the starting centre-backs, as Italy finished in third-place, after being eliminated by defending champions Argentina in a penalty shootout in the semi-finals. Baresi helped the Italian defence to keep five consecutive clean sheets, only conceding two goals, and going unbeaten for a World Cup record of 518 minutes, until they were beaten by an Argentinian equaliser in the semi-final. His performances earned him a spot on the 1990 World Cup Team of the tournament.

After replacing Giuseppe Bergomi as captain for the 1994 World Cup under his former manager at Milan, Arrigo Sacchi, Baresi sustained an injury to his meniscus in Italy&#x27;s second group match, a 1–0 win against Norway, and missed most of the tournament. He returned to the squad 25 days later, in time for the final, with a dominant defensive performance, helping Italy to keep a clean sheet against Brazil, despite the key defensive absences of his Milan teammates Alessandro Costacurta and Mauro Tassotti. After a 0–0 deadlock following extra time, the match went to a penalty shootout, and Baresi subsequently missed his penalty, suffering from severe cramps and fatigue. Following misses by Daniele Massaro and Roberto Baggio, Italy were defeated by Brazil in the penalty shootout.

Following the World Cup defeat, Baresi made one more appearance for Italy, in an away UEFA Euro 1996 qualifying match against Slovenia on 7 September 1994, which ended in a 1–1 draw. Baresi subsequently retired from the national side at age 34, passing the captain&#x27;s armband to his Milan teammate Paolo Maldini. Baresi amassed 81 caps for Italy, scoring one goal in a friendly win against the Soviet Union, and he is one of seven players to have achieved the rare feat of winning Gold, Silver and Bronze FIFA World Cup medals during his international career.

==Style of play==
Baresi is regarded as one of the greatest defenders of all time. He played his entire 20-year career with Milan, becoming a club legend. At Milan, he formed one of the most formidable defensive units of all time, alongside Paolo Maldini, Alessandro Costacurta, Mauro Tassotti, Filippo Galli and later Christian Panucci. He was a complete and consistent defender who combined power with elegance and was gifted with outstanding physical and mental attributes, such as pace, strength, tenacity, concentration and stamina, which made him effective in the air, despite his lack of notable height for a centre-back.
Although Baresi was capable of playing anywhere along the backline, he primarily excelled as a centreback and as sweeper, where he combined his defensive attributes, and his ability to read the game, with his excellent vision, technique, distribution and ball skills. These qualities also enabled him to excel in a zonal marking system, maintain a high defensive line, and play the offside trap, in particular during his time at Milan under Sacchi; indeed, Baresi came to be known for often raising his arm towards the linesman whenever his team attempted to play the offside trap. Baresi&#x27;s passing range, technical ability and ball control allowed him to advance forward into the midfield to start attacking plays from the back, enabling him to function as a secondary playmaker for his team, and also play as a defensive or central midfielder when necessary. Despite being a defender, he was also an accurate penalty kick taker. Baresi was known for being a strong and accurate tackler, who was very good at winning back possession, and at anticipating and intercepting plays, due to his acute tactical intelligence, speed of thought, marking ability and positional sense. A precocious talent in his youth, throughout the course of his career, he also stood out for his professionalism, athleticism, longevity, and discipline in training, as well as his outstanding leadership, commanding presence on the pitch and his organisational skills; indeed, he captained both Milan and the Italy national team.

Baresi also shares the record of most own goals scored in Serie A history (eight, along with Riccardo Ferri).

==Coaching career==
On 1 June 2002, Baresi was officially appointed as director of football at Fulham, but tensions between Baresi and then Fulham manager Jean Tigana led to resignation from the club in August.

He was appointed head coach of Milan&#x27;s &quot;Primavera&quot; Under-20 squad. In 2006, he was moved by the club to coach the &quot;Berretti&quot; Under-19 squad, with his former teammate Filippo Galli replacing him at the helm of the Primavera squad. He retired from coaching and was replaced by Roberto Bertuzzo.

==Personal life==
Franco Baresi is the younger brother of Internazionale legendary defender Giuseppe Baresi. As youngsters, both players had tryouts for Inter, but Franco was rejected, and purchased by local rivals Milan. As he was the younger player, Franco was initially known as &quot;Baresi 2&quot;. However, due to Franco&#x27;s eventual great success and popularity throughout his career, which surpassed even that of his older brother&#x27;s, Giuseppe later became known as &quot;the other Baresi&quot;, despite also achieving notable success.

In 1981, Baresi suffered from a blood infection that forced him out of play for nearly four months and worsened his health to the point of him needing a wheelchair. While in treatment, he participated in the medical research for the disease.

==Media==
Baresi is featured in the EA Sports football video game series &quot;FIFA 14&quot;&#x27;s Classic XI – a multi-national all-star team, along with compatriots Bruno Conti, Gianni Rivera and Giacinto Facchetti. He was also named in the Ultimate Team Legends in &quot;FIFA 15&quot;.

<doc id="10857" wikidata="Q1123245" url="?curid=10857" title="Stage (stratigraphy)">
<text>In chronostratigraphy, a stage is a succession of rock strata laid down in a single age on the geologic timescale, which usually represents millions of years of deposition. A given stage of rock and the corresponding age of time will by convention have the same name, and the same boundaries.

Rock series are divided into stages, just as geological epochs are divided into ages. Stages are divided into smaller stratigraphic units called chronozones or substages, and added together into superstages.

The term faunal stage is sometimes used, referring to the fact that the same fauna (animals) are found throughout the layer (by definition).

==Definition==

Stages are primarily defined by a consistent set of fossils (biostratigraphy) or a consistent magnetic polarity (see paleomagnetism) in the rock. Usually one or more index fossils that are common, found worldwide, easily recognized, and limited to a single, or at most a few, stages are used to define the stage&#x27;s bottom. 

Thus, for example in the local North American subdivision, a paleontologist finding fragments of the trilobite &quot;Olenellus&quot; would identify the beds as being from the Waucoban Stage whereas fragments of a later trilobite such as &quot;Elrathia&quot; would identify the stage as Albertan. 

Stages were important in the 19th and early 20th centuries as they were the major tool available for dating and correlating rock units prior to the development of seismology and radioactive dating in the second half of the 20th century. Microscopic analysis of the rock (petrology) is also sometimes useful in confirming that a given segment of rock is from a particular age.

Originally, faunal stages were only defined regionally. As additional stratigraphic and geochronologic tools were developed, they were defined over ever broader areas. More recently, the adjective &quot;faunal&quot; has been dropped as regional and global correlations of rock sequences have become relatively certain and there is less need for faunal labels to define the age of formations. A tendency developed to use European and, to a lesser extent, Asian stage names for the same time period worldwide, even though the faunas in other regions often had little in common with the stage as originally defined.

==International standardization==

Boundaries and names are established by the International Commission on Stratigraphy (ICS) of the International Union of Geological Sciences. As of 2008, the ICS is nearly finished with a task begun in 1974, subdividing the Phanerozoic eonothem into internationally accepted stages using two types of benchmark. For younger stages, a Global Boundary Stratotype Section and Point (GSSP), a physical outcrop clearly demonstrates the boundary. For older stages, a Global Standard Stratigraphic Age (GSSA) is an absolute date. The benchmarks will give a much greater certainty that results can be compared with confidence in the date determinations, and such results will have farther scope than any evaluation based solely on local knowledge and conditions. 

In many regions local subdivisions and classification criteria are still used along with the newer internationally coordinated uniform system, but once the research establishes a more complete international system, it is expected that local systems will be abandoned.

==Stages and lithostratigraphy==
Stages can include many lithostratigraphic units (for example formations, beds, members, etc.) of differing rock types that were being laid down in different environments at the same time. In the same way, a lithostratigraphic unit can include a number of stages or parts of them.

<doc id="10858" wikidata="Q905" url="?curid=10858" title="Franz Kafka">
<text>Franz Kafka (3 July 1883 – 3 June 1924) was a Jewish Austrian-Czech novelist and writer from Prague who wrote in German. He is widely regarded as a major figure of 20th-century literature. His work fuses elements of realism and the fantastic, and typically features isolated protagonists facing bizarre or surrealistic predicaments and incomprehensible socio-bureaucratic powers. It has been interpreted as exploring themes of alienation, existential anxiety, guilt, and absurdity. His best known works include the novella &quot;The Metamorphosis&quot; (1915) and the novels &quot;The Trial&quot; (1924) and &quot;The Castle&quot; (1926). The term &quot;Kafkaesque&quot; has entered English to describe absurd situations like those depicted in his writing.

Kafka was born into a middle-class German- and Yiddish-speaking Czech Jewish family in Prague, the capital of the Kingdom of Bohemia, which belonged to the Austrian part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire (today the capital of the Czech Republic, also known as Czechia). He trained as a lawyer, and after completing his legal education was employed full-time in various legal and insurance jobs. Being employed full-time forced Kafka to relegate writing to his spare time. Few of his works were published during his lifetime; the story collections &quot;Contemplation&quot; (1912) and &quot;A Country Doctor&quot; (1919), and individual stories, such as his novella &quot;The Metamorphosis&quot;, were published in literary magazines, but they received little attention. Over the course of his life, Kafka wrote hundreds of letters to family and close friends, including his father, with whom he had a strained and formal relationship. He became engaged to several women but never married. He died relatively unknown in 1924 of tuberculosis, at the age of 40.

Kafka was a prolific writer, but he burned an estimated 90 percent of his total work due to persistent struggles with self-doubt. Much of the remaining 10 percent is lost or otherwise unpublished. In his will, Kafka instructed his close friend and literary executor Max Brod to destroy his unfinished works, including his novels &quot;The Trial&quot;, &quot;The Castle&quot;, and (1927), but Brod ignored these instructions and had much of his work published. Kafka&#x27;s writings became famous in German-speaking countries after World War II, influencing German literature, and its influence spread elsewhere in the world in the 1960s. It has also influenced artists, composers, and philosophers.

== Life ==
=== Early life ===
Kafka was born near the Old Town Square in Prague, then part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. His family were German-speaking middle-class Ashkenazi Jews. His father, Hermann Kafka (1854–1931), was the fourth child of Jakob Kafka, a or ritual slaughterer in Osek, a Czech village with a large Jewish population located near Strakonice in southern Bohemia. Hermann brought the Kafka family to Prague. After working as a travelling sales representative, he eventually became a fashion retailer who employed up to 15 people and used the image of a jackdaw ( in Czech, pronounced and colloquially written as &quot;kafka&quot;) as his business logo. Kafka&#x27;s mother, Julie (1856–1934), was the daughter of Jakob Löwy, a prosperous retail merchant in Poděbrady, and was better educated than her husband.

Kafka&#x27;s parents, from traditional Jewish society, spoke German replete with influences from their native Yiddish; their children, raised in an acculturated environment, spoke Standard German. Hermann and Julie had six children, of whom Franz was the eldest. Franz&#x27;s two brothers, Georg and Heinrich, died in infancy before Franz was seven; his three sisters were Gabriele (&quot;Elli&quot;) (1889–1942), Valerie (&quot;Valli&quot;) (1890–1942) and Ottilie (&quot;Ottla&quot;) (1892–1943). All three were murdered in the Holocaust of World War II. Valli was deported to the Łódź Ghetto in occupied Poland in 1942, but that is the last documentation of her; it is assumed she did not survive the war. Ottilie was Kafka&#x27;s favourite sister.

Hermann is described by Kafka scholar and translator Stanley Corngold as a &quot;huge, selfish, overbearing businessman&quot; and by Franz Kafka as &quot;a true Kafka in strength, health, appetite, loudness of voice, eloquence, self-satisfaction, worldly dominance, endurance, presence of mind, knowledge of human nature, a certain way of doing things on a grand scale, of course with all the defects and weaknesses that go with all these advantages and into which your temperament and sometimes your hot temper drive you&quot;. On business days, both parents were absent from the home, with Julie Kafka working as many as 12 hours each day helping to manage the family business. Consequently, Kafka&#x27;s childhood was somewhat lonely, and the children were reared largely by a series of governesses and servants. Kafka&#x27;s troubled relationship with his father is evident in his (&quot;Letter to His Father&quot;) of more than 100 pages, in which he complains of being profoundly affected by his father&#x27;s authoritarian and demanding character; his mother, in contrast, was quiet and shy. The dominating figure of Kafka&#x27;s father had a significant influence on Kafka&#x27;s writing.

The Kafka family had a servant girl living with them in a cramped apartment. Franz&#x27;s room was often cold. In November 1913, the family moved into a bigger apartment, although Ellie and Valli had married and moved out of the first apartment. In early August 1914, just after World War I began, the sisters did not know where their husbands were in the military and moved back in with the family in this larger apartment. Both Ellie and Valli also had children. Franz at age 31 moved into Valli&#x27;s former apartment, quiet by contrast, and lived by himself for the first time.

=== Education ===
From 1889 to 1893, Kafka attended the German boys&#x27; elementary school at the (meat market), now known as Masná Street. His Jewish education ended with his &quot;bar mitzvah&quot; celebration at the age of 13. Kafka never enjoyed attending the synagogue and went with his father only on four high holidays each year.

After leaving elementary school in 1893, Kafka was admitted to the rigorous classics-oriented state gymnasium, , an academic secondary school at Old Town Square, located within Kinský Palace. German was the language of instruction, but Kafka also spoke and wrote in Czech. He studied the latter at the gymnasium for eight years, achieving good grades. Kafka received compliments for his Czech, but never considered himself fluent in the language. He spoke German with a Czech accent. He completed his Matura exams in 1901.

Kafka was admitted to the of Prague in 1901. He was originally admitted for philosophy, and he had additionally signed up for chemistry. Kafka began studying chemistry but switched to law after two weeks. Although this field did not excite him, it offered a range of career possibilities, which pleased his father. In addition, law required a longer course of study, giving Kafka time to take classes in German studies and art history. He also joined a student club, (Reading and Lecture Hall of the German students), which organised literary events, readings and other activities. Among Kafka&#x27;s friends were the journalist Felix Weltsch, who studied philosophy, the actor Yitzchak Lowy who came from an orthodox Hasidic Warsaw family, and the writers Ludwig Winder, Oskar Baum and Franz Werfel.

At the end of his first year of studies, Kafka met Max Brod, a fellow law student who became a close friend for life. Years later, Brod coined the term (&quot;The Close Prague Circle&quot;) to describe the group of writers, which included Kafka, Felix Weltsch and Brod himself. Brod soon noticed that, although Kafka was shy and seldom spoke, what he said was usually profound. Kafka was an avid reader throughout his life; together he and Brod read Plato&#x27;s &quot;Protagoras&quot; in the original Greek, on Brod&#x27;s initiative, and Flaubert&#x27;s and (&quot;The Temptation of Saint Anthony&quot;) in French, at his own suggestion. Kafka considered Fyodor Dostoevsky, Gustave Flaubert, Nikolai Gogol, Franz Grillparzer, and Heinrich von Kleist to be his &quot;true blood brothers&quot;. Besides these, he took an interest in Czech literature and was also very fond of the works of Goethe. Kafka was awarded the degree of Doctor of Law on 18 June 1906 and performed an obligatory year of unpaid service as a law clerk for the civil and criminal courts.

=== Employment ===
On 1 November 1907, Kafka was employed at the , an insurance company, where he worked for nearly a year. His correspondence during that period indicates that he was unhappy with a work schedule—from 08:00 until 18:00—that made it extremely difficult to concentrate on writing, which was assuming increasing importance to him. On 15 July 1908, he resigned. Two weeks later, he found employment more amenable to writing when he joined the Worker&#x27;s Accident Insurance Institute for the Kingdom of Bohemia (). The job involved investigating and assessing compensation for personal injury to industrial workers; accidents such as lost fingers or limbs were commonplace, owing to poor work safety policies at the time. It was especially true of factories fitted with machine lathes, drills, planing machines and rotary saws, which were rarely fitted with safety guards.

His father often referred to his son&#x27;s job as an insurance officer as a , literally &quot;bread job&quot;, a job done only to pay the bills; Kafka often claimed to despise it. Kafka was rapidly promoted and his duties included processing and investigating compensation claims, writing reports, and handling appeals from businessmen who thought their firms had been placed in too high a risk category, which cost them more in insurance premiums. He would compile and compose the annual report on the insurance institute for the several years he worked there. The reports were well received by his superiors. Kafka usually got off work at 2 p.m., so that he had time to spend on his literary work, to which he was committed. Kafka&#x27;s father also expected him to help out at and take over the family fancy goods store. In his later years, Kafka&#x27;s illness often prevented him from working at the insurance bureau and at his writing.

In late 1911, Elli&#x27;s husband Karl Hermann and Kafka became partners in the first asbestos factory in Prague, known as Prager Asbestwerke Hermann &amp; Co., having used dowry money from Hermann Kafka. Kafka showed a positive attitude at first, dedicating much of his free time to the business, but he later resented the encroachment of this work on his writing time. During that period, he also found interest and entertainment in the performances of Yiddish theatre. After seeing a Yiddish theatre troupe perform in October 1911, for the next six months Kafka &quot;immersed himself in Yiddish language and in Yiddish literature&quot;. This interest also served as a starting point for his growing exploration of Judaism. It was at about this time that Kafka became a vegetarian. Around 1915, Kafka received his draft notice for military service in World WarI, but his employers at the insurance institute arranged for a deferment because his work was considered essential government service. He later attempted to join the military but was prevented from doing so by medical problems associated with tuberculosis, with which he was diagnosed in 1917. In 1918, the Worker&#x27;s Accident Insurance Institute put Kafka on a pension due to his illness, for which there was no cure at the time, and he spent most of the rest of his life in sanatoriums.

=== Private life ===
Kafka never married. According to Brod, Kafka was &quot;tortured&quot; by sexual desire, and Kafka&#x27;s biographer Reiner Stach states that his life was full of &quot;incessant womanising&quot; and that he was filled with a fear of &quot;sexual failure&quot;. Kafka visited brothels for most of his adult life and pornography was &quot;part and parcel of his sexual life&quot; at one time. In addition, he had close relationships with several women during his lifetime. On 13 August 1912, Kafka met Felice Bauer, a relative of Brod&#x27;s, who worked in Berlin as a representative of a dictaphone company. A week after the meeting at Brod&#x27;s home, Kafka wrote in his diary:

Shortly after this meeting, Kafka wrote the story &quot;&quot; (&quot;The Judgment&quot;) in only one night and in a productive period worked on (&quot;The Man Who Disappeared&quot;) and &quot;Die Verwandlung&quot; (&quot;The Metamorphosis&quot;). Kafka and Felice Bauer communicated mostly through letters over the next five years, met occasionally, and were engaged twice. Kafka&#x27;s extant letters to Bauer were published as (&quot;Letters to Felice&quot;); her letters did not survive. After he had written to Bauer&#x27;s father asking to marry her, Kafka wrote in his diary:

According to the biographers Stach and James Hawes, Kafka became engaged a third time around 1920, to Julie Wohryzek, a poor and uneducated hotel chambermaid. Kafka&#x27;s father objected to Julie because of her Zionist beliefs. Although Kafka and Julie rented a flat and set a wedding date, the marriage never took place. During this time, Kafka began a draft of &quot;Letter to His Father&quot;. Before the date of the intended marriage, he took up with yet another woman. While he needed women and sex in his life, he had low self-confidence, felt sex was dirty, and was cripplingly shy—especially about his body.

Stach and Brod state that during the time that Kafka knew Felice Bauer, he had an affair with a friend of hers, Margarethe &quot;Grete&quot; Bloch, a Jewish woman from Berlin. Brod says that Bloch gave birth to Kafka&#x27;s son, although Kafka never knew about the child. The boy, whose name is not known, was born in 1914 or 1915 and died in Munich in 1921. However, Kafka&#x27;s biographer Peter-André Alt says that, while Bloch had a son, Kafka was not the father, as the pair were never intimate. Stach points out that there is a great deal of contradictory evidence around the claim that Kafka was the father.

Kafka was diagnosed with tuberculosis in August 1917 and moved for a few months to the Bohemian village of Zürau (Siřem in Czech), where his sister Ottla worked on the farm of her brother-in-law Karl Hermann. He felt comfortable there and later described this time as perhaps the best period of his life, probably because he had no responsibilities. He kept diaries and made notes in exercise books (). From those notes, Kafka extracted 109 numbered pieces of text on single pieces of paper (); these were later published as (The Zürau Aphorisms or Reflections on Sin, Hope, Suffering, and the True Way).

In 1920, Kafka began an intense relationship with Milena Jesenská, a Czech journalist and writer who was non-Jewish and who was married, but when she met Kafka, her marriage was a &quot;sham&quot;. His letters to her were later published as . During a vacation in July 1923 to Graal-Müritz on the Baltic Sea, Kafka met Dora Diamant, a 25-year-old kindergarten teacher from an orthodox Jewish family. Kafka, hoping to escape the influence of his family to concentrate on his writing, moved briefly to Berlin (September 1923-March 1924) and lived with Diamant. She became his lover and sparked his interest in the Talmud. He worked on four stories, including (&quot;A Hunger Artist&quot;), which were published shortly after his death.

===Siblings===
Kafka&#x27;s parents had six children; Franz was the eldest. His two brothers, Georg and Heinrich, died in infancy; his three sisters, Gabriele (&quot;Elli&quot;) (September 22, 1889 – fall of 1942), Valerie (&quot;Valli&quot;) (1890–1942) and Ottilie (&quot;Ottla&quot;) (1892–1943), are believed to have been murdered in the Holocaust of the Second World War. Ottilie was Kafka&#x27;s favourite sister.

Gabriele was Kafka&#x27;s eldest sister. She was known as Elli or Ellie; her married name is variously rendered as Hermann or Hermannová. She attended a German girls&#x27; school in Prague&#x27;s Řeznická Street and later a private girls&#x27; secondary school. She married Karl Hermann (1883–1939), a salesman, in 1910. The couple had a son, Felix (1911–1940), and two daughters, Gertrude (Gerti) Kaufmann (1912–1972), and Hanna Seidner (1920–1941). After her marriage to Hermann, she became closer to her brother, whose letters showed an active interest in the upbringing and education of her children. He accompanied her on a 1915 trip to Hungary to visit Hermann, who was stationed there, and spent a summer with her and her children in Müritz the year before he died.

With the outbreak of the Great Depression in 1929, the Hermann family business experienced financial difficulties and eventually went bankrupt. Karl Hermann died February 27, 1939, and Elli was supported financially by her sisters. On October 21, 1941, she was deported together with her daughter Hanna to the Łódź Ghetto, where she lived temporarily with her sister Valli and Valli&#x27;s husband in the spring of 1942. She was probably killed in the Kulmhof extermination camp in the fall of 1942. Of Elli&#x27;s three children, only her daughter Gerti survived the Second World War. A memorial plaque commemorates the three sisters at the family grave in the New Jewish Cemetery in Prague.

=== Personality ===

Kafka had a lifelong suspicion that people found him mentally and physically repulsive. However, many of those who met him found him to possess obvious intelligence and a sense of humour; they also found him handsome, although of austere appearance. Kafka was thought to be &quot;very self-analytic&quot;. Brod compared Kafka to Heinrich von Kleist, noting that both writers had the ability to describe a situation realistically with precise details. Brod thought Kafka was one of the most entertaining people he had met; Kafka enjoyed sharing his humour with his friends but also helped them in difficult situations with good advice. According to Brod, he was a passionate reciter, able to phrase his speech as though it were music. Brod felt that two of Kafka&#x27;s most distinguishing traits were &quot;absolute truthfulness&quot; () and &quot;precise conscientiousness&quot; (). He explored inconspicuous details in depth and with such precision and love that unforeseen things surfaced that seemed strange but absolutely true ().

Kafka&#x27;s letters and unexpurgated diaries reveal repressed homoerotic desires, including an infatuation with novelist Franz Werfel and fascination with the work of Hans Blüher on male bonding. Saul Friedländer argues that this mental struggle may have informed the themes of alienation and psychological brutality in his writing.

Although Kafka showed little interest in exercise as a child, he later developed a passion for games and physical activity and was an accomplished rider, swimmer, and rower. On weekends, he and his friends embarked on long hikes, often planned by Kafka himself. His other interests included alternative medicine, modern education systems such as Montessori, and technological novelties such as airplanes and film. Writing was vitally important to Kafka; he considered it a &quot;form of prayer&quot;. He was highly sensitive to noise and preferred absolute quiet when writing. Kafka was also a vegetarian and did not drink alcohol.

Pérez-Álvarez has claimed that Kafka had symptomatology consistent with schizoid personality disorder. His style, it is claimed, not only in (&quot;The Metamorphosis&quot;) but in other writings, appears to show low- to medium-level schizoid traits, which Pérez-Álvarez claims to have influenced much of his work. His anguish can be seen in this diary entry from 21 June 1913:

and in Zürau Aphorism number 50:

Italian medical researchers Alessia Coralli and Antonio Perciaccante have posited in a 2016 article that Kafka may have had borderline personality disorder with co-occurring psychophysiological insomnia. Joan Lachkar interpreted as &quot;a vivid depiction of the borderline personality&quot; and described the story as &quot;model for Kafka&#x27;s own abandonment fears, anxiety, depression, and parasitic dependency needs. Kafka illuminated the borderline&#x27;s general confusion of normal and healthy desires, wishes, and needs with something ugly and disdainful&quot;.

Though Kafka never married, he held marriage and children in high esteem. He had several girlfriends and lovers during his life. He may have suffered from an eating disorder. Doctor Manfred M. Fichter of the Psychiatric Clinic, University of Munich, presented &quot;evidence for the hypothesis that the writer Franz Kafka had suffered from an atypical anorexia nervosa&quot;, and that Kafka was not just lonely and depressed but also &quot;occasionally suicidal&quot;. In his 1995 book &quot;Franz Kafka, the Jewish Patient&quot;, Sander Gilman investigated &quot;why a Jew might have been considered &#x27;hypochondriacal&#x27; or &#x27;homosexual&#x27; and how Kafka incorporates aspects of these ways of understanding the Jewish male into his own self-image and writing&quot;. Kafka considered suicide at least once, in late 1912.

=== Political views ===

Before World War I, Kafka attended several meetings of the &quot;Klub mladých&quot;, a Czech anarchist, anti-militarist, and anti-clerical organization. Hugo Bergmann, who attended the same elementary and high schools as Kafka, fell out with Kafka during their last academic year (1900–1901) because &quot;[Kafka&#x27;s] socialism and my Zionism were much too strident&quot;. Bergmann said: &quot;Franz became a socialist, I became a Zionist in 1898. The synthesis of Zionism and socialism did not yet exist.&quot; Bergmann claims that Kafka wore a red carnation to school to show his support for socialism. In one diary entry, Kafka made reference to the influential anarchist philosopher Peter Kropotkin: &quot;Don&#x27;t forget Kropotkin!&quot;

During the communist era, the legacy of Kafka&#x27;s work for Eastern Bloc socialism was hotly debated. Opinions ranged from the notion that he satirised the bureaucratic bungling of a crumbling Austro-Hungarian Empire, to the belief that he embodied the rise of socialism. A further key point was Marx&#x27;s theory of alienation. While the orthodox position was that Kafka&#x27;s depictions of alienation were no longer relevant for a society that had supposedly eliminated alienation, a 1963 conference held in Liblice, Czechoslovakia, on the eightieth anniversary of his birth, reassessed the importance of Kafka&#x27;s portrayal of bureaucracy. Whether Kafka was a political writer is still an issue of debate.

=== Judaism and Zionism ===

Kafka grew up in Prague as a German-speaking Jew. He was deeply fascinated by the Jews of Eastern Europe, who he thought possessed an intensity of spiritual life that was absent from Jews in the West. His diary contains many references to Yiddish writers. Yet he was at times alienated from Judaism and Jewish life. On 8 January 1914, he wrote in his diary:
In his adolescent years, Kafka declared himself an atheist.

Hawes suggests that Kafka, though very aware of his own Jewishness, did not incorporate it into his work, which, according to Hawes, lacks Jewish characters, scenes or themes. In the opinion of literary critic Harold Bloom, although Kafka was uneasy with his Jewish heritage, he was the quintessential Jewish writer. Lothar Kahn is likewise unequivocal: &quot;The presence of Jewishness in Kafka&#x27;s is no longer subject to doubt&quot;. Pavel Eisner, one of Kafka&#x27;s first translators, interprets (&quot;The Trial&quot;) as the embodiment of the &quot;triple dimension of Jewish existence in Prague... his protagonist Josef K. is (symbolically) arrested by a German (Rabensteiner), a Czech (Kullich), and a Jew (Kaminer). He stands for the &#x27;guiltless guilt&#x27; that imbues the Jew in the modern world, although there is no evidence that he himself is a Jew&quot;.

In his essay &quot;Sadness in Palestine?!&quot;, Dan Miron explores Kafka&#x27;s connection to Zionism: &quot;It seems that those who claim that there was such a connection and that Zionism played a central role in his life and literary work, and those who deny the connection altogether or dismiss its importance, are both wrong. The truth lies in some very elusive place between these two simplistic poles.&quot; Kafka considered moving to Palestine with Felice Bauer, and later with Dora Diamant. He studied Hebrew while living in Berlin, hiring a friend of Brod&#x27;s from Palestine, Pua Bat-Tovim, to tutor him and attending Rabbi Julius Grünthal and Rabbi Julius Guttmann&#x27;s classes in the Berlin (College for the Study of Judaism), where he also studied Talmud.

Livia Rothkirchen calls Kafka the &quot;symbolic figure of his era&quot;. His contemporaries included numerous Jewish, Czech, and German writers who were sensitive to Jewish, Czech, and German culture. According to Rothkirchen, &quot;This situation lent their writings a broad cosmopolitan outlook and a quality of exaltation bordering on transcendental metaphysical contemplation. An illustrious example is Franz Kafka&quot;.

Towards the end of his life Kafka sent a postcard to his friend Hugo Bergmann in Tel Aviv, announcing his intention to emigrate to Palestine. Bergmann refused to host Kafka because he had young children and was afraid that Kafka would infect them with tuberculosis.

==Death==

Kafka&#x27;s laryngeal tuberculosis worsened and in March 1924 he returned from Berlin to Prague, where members of his family, principally his sister Ottla and Dora Diamant, took care of him. He went to Hugo Hoffmann&#x27;s sanatorium in Kierling just outside Vienna for treatment on 10 April, and died there on 3 June 1924. The cause of death seemed to be starvation: the condition of Kafka&#x27;s throat made eating too painful for him, and since parenteral nutrition had not yet been developed, there was no way to feed him. Kafka was editing &quot;A Hunger Artist&quot; on his deathbed, a story whose composition he had begun before his throat closed to the point that he could not take any nourishment. His body was brought back to Prague where he was buried on 11 June 1924, in the New Jewish Cemetery in Prague-Žižkov. His obituary appeared in the &quot;Prager Presse&quot; and the &quot;Berliner Tageblatt&quot;. Kafka was virtually unknown during his own lifetime, but he did not consider fame important. He rose to fame rapidly after his death, particularly after World War II. The Kafka tombstone was designed by architect Leopold Ehrmann.
== Works ==


All of Kafka&#x27;s published works were written in German. What little was published during his lifetime attracted scant public attention.

Kafka finished none of his full-length novels and burned around 90 percent of his work, much of it during the period he lived in Berlin with Diamant, who helped him burn the drafts. In his early years as a writer he was influenced by von Kleist, whose work he described in a letter to Bauer as frightening and whom he considered closer than his own family.

The first mention of Kafka&#x27;s work was in an article by Max Brod on February 9, 1907 in the Berlin weekly &quot;Die Gegenwart&quot;, two years prior to his first publication. Brod would write about his friend again in 1921 in an essay entitled &quot;Der Dichter Frank Kafka&quot;.

Kafka&#x27;s earliest published works were eight stories that appeared in 1908 in the first issue of the literary journal &quot;Hyperion&quot; under the title (&quot;Contemplation&quot;). He wrote the story &quot;&quot; (&quot;Description of a Struggle&quot;) in 1904; in 1905 he showed it to Brod, who advised him to continue writing and convinced him to submit it to &quot;Hyperion&quot;. Kafka published a fragment in 1908 and two sections in the spring of 1909, all in Munich.

In a creative outburst on the night of 22 September 1912, Kafka wrote the story &quot;Das Urteil&quot; (&quot;The Judgment&quot;, literally: &quot;The Verdict&quot;) and dedicated it to Felice Bauer. Brod noted the similarity in names of the main character and his fictional fiancée, Georg Bendemann and Frieda Brandenfeld, to Franz Kafka and Felice Bauer. The story is often considered Kafka&#x27;s breakthrough work. It deals with the troubled relationship of a son and his dominant father, facing a new situation after the son&#x27;s engagement. Kafka later described writing it as &quot;a complete opening of body and soul&quot;, a story that &quot;evolved as a true birth, covered with filth and slime&quot;. The story was first published in Leipzig in 1912 and dedicated &quot;to Miss Felice Bauer&quot;, and in subsequent editions &quot;for F.&quot;

In 1912, Kafka wrote &quot;Die Verwandlung&quot; (&quot;The Metamorphosis&quot;, or &quot;The Transformation&quot;), published in 1915 in Leipzig. The story begins with a travelling salesman waking to find himself transformed into an , a monstrous vermin, being a general term for unwanted and unclean pests, especially insects. Critics regard the work as one of the seminal works of fiction of the 20th century. The story &quot;In der Strafkolonie&quot; (&quot;In the Penal Colony&quot;), dealing with an elaborate torture and execution device, was written in October 1914, revised in 1918, and published in Leipzig during October 1919. The story &quot;Ein Hungerkünstler&quot; (&quot;A Hunger Artist&quot;), published in the periodical in 1924, describes a victimized protagonist who experiences a decline in the appreciation of his strange craft of starving himself for extended periods. His last story, &quot;Josefine, die Sängerin oder Das Volk der Mäuse&quot; (&quot;Josephine the Singer, or the Mouse Folk&quot;), also deals with the relationship between an artist and his audience.

=== Novels ===

Kafka began his first novel in 1912; its first chapter is the story &quot;Der Heizer&quot; (&quot;The Stoker&quot;). He called the work, which remained unfinished, (&quot;The Man Who Disappeared&quot; or &quot;The Missing Person&quot;), but when Brod published it after Kafka&#x27;s death he named it &quot;Amerika&quot;. The inspiration for the novel was the time Kafka spent in the audience of Yiddish theatre the previous year, bringing him to a new awareness of his heritage, which led to the thought that an innate appreciation for one&#x27;s heritage lives deep within each person. More explicitly humorous and slightly more realistic than most of Kafka&#x27;s works, the novel shares the motif of an oppressive and intangible system putting the protagonist repeatedly in bizarre situations. It uses many details of experiences from his relatives who had emigrated to America and is the only work for which Kafka considered an optimistic ending.

In 1914 Kafka began the novel (&quot;The Trial&quot;), the story of a man arrested and prosecuted by a remote, inaccessible authority, with the nature of his crime revealed neither to him nor to the reader. He did not complete the novel, although he finished the final chapter. According to Nobel Prize-winning author Elias Canetti, Felice is central to the plot of &quot;Der Process&quot; and Kafka said it was &quot;her story&quot;. Canetti titled his book on Kafka&#x27;s letters to Felice &quot;Kafka&#x27;s Other Trial&quot;, in recognition of the relationship between the letters and the novel. Michiko Kakutani notes in a review for &quot;The New York Times&quot; that Kafka&#x27;s letters have the &quot;earmarks of his fiction: the same nervous attention to minute particulars; the same paranoid awareness of shifting balances of power; the same atmosphere of emotional suffocation—combined, surprisingly enough, with moments of boyish ardour and delight.&quot;

According to his diary, Kafka was already planning his novel (&quot;The Castle&quot;), by 11 June 1914; however, he did not begin writing it until 27 January 1922. The protagonist is the (land surveyor) named K., who struggles for unknown reasons to gain access to the mysterious authorities of a castle who govern the village. Kafka&#x27;s intent was that the castle&#x27;s authorities notify K. on his deathbed that his &quot;legal claim to live in the village was not valid, yet, taking certain auxiliary circumstances into account, he was to be permitted to live and work there&quot;. Dark and at times surreal, the novel is focused on alienation, bureaucracy, the seemingly endless frustrations of man&#x27;s attempts to stand against the system, and the futile and hopeless pursuit of an unattainable goal. Hartmut M. Rastalsky noted in his thesis: &quot;Like dreams, his texts combine precise &#x27;realistic&#x27; detail with absurdity, careful observation and reasoning on the part of the protagonists with inexplicable obliviousness and carelessness.&quot;

=== Drawings ===

Kafka drew and sketched extensively. His interest in art grew from 1901 to 1906. He &quot;practiced drawing, took drawing classes, attended art history lectures, and sought to establish a connection to Prague&#x27;s artistic circles&quot;. According to Max Brod, Kafka &quot;was even more indifferent, or perhaps better, more hostile to his drawings than he was to his literary production&quot;. As he did with his writings, Kafka asked in his testament for his drawings to be destroyed. Brod preserved all of Kafka&#x27;s drawings that Kafka gave him or that he could rescue from the wastebasket or otherwise, but &quot;[a]nything that I didn&#x27;t rescue was destroyed&quot;. Until May 2021, only about 40 of his drawings were known. In 2022, Yale University Press published &quot;Franz Kafka: The Drawings&quot;. The book brought to light about 150 sketches by Kafka.

=== Publishing history ===

Kafka&#x27;s stories were initially published in literary periodicals. His first eight were printed in 1908 in the first issue of the bi-monthly &quot;Hyperion&quot;. Franz Blei published two dialogues in 1909 which became part of &quot;Beschreibung eines Kampfes&quot; (&quot;Description of a Struggle&quot;). A fragment of the story &quot;Die Aeroplane in Brescia&quot; (&quot;The Aeroplanes at Brescia&quot;), written on a trip to Italy with Brod, appeared in the daily &quot;Bohemia&quot; on 28 September 1909. On 27 March 1910, several stories that later became part of the book were published in the Easter edition of &quot;Bohemia&quot;. In Leipzig during 1913, Brod and publisher Kurt Wolff included &quot;&quot; (&quot;The Judgment. A Story by Franz Kafka.&quot;) in their literary yearbook for the art poetry &quot;Arkadia&quot;. In the same year, Wolff published &quot;Der Heizer&quot; (&quot;The Stoker&quot;) in the Jüngste Tag series, where it enjoyed three printings. The story &quot;&quot; (&quot;Before the Law&quot;) was published in the 1915 New Year&#x27;s edition of the independent Jewish weekly ; it was reprinted in 1919 as part of the story collection (&quot;A Country Doctor&quot;) and became part of the novel . Other stories were published in various publications, including Martin Buber&#x27;s &quot;Der Jude&quot;, the paper , and the periodicals , &quot;Genius&quot;, and &quot;Prager Presse&quot;.

Kafka&#x27;s first published book, (&quot;Contemplation&quot;, or &quot;Meditation&quot;), was a collection of 18stories written between 1904 and 1912. On a summer trip to Weimar, Brod initiated a meeting between Kafka and Kurt Wolff; Wolff published in the at the end of 1912 (with the year given as 1913). Kafka dedicated it to Brod, &quot;, and added in the personal copy given to his friend &quot; (&quot;As it is already printed here, for my dearest Max&quot;).

Kafka&#x27;s novella &quot;Die Verwandlung&quot; (&quot;The Metamorphosis&quot;) was first printed in the October 1915 issue of , a monthly edition of expressionist literature, edited by René Schickele. Another story collection, (&quot;A Country Doctor&quot;), was published by Kurt Wolff in 1919, dedicated to Kafka&#x27;s father. Kafka prepared a final collection of four stories for print, &quot;(A Hunger Artist)&quot;, which appeared in 1924 after his death, in . On 20 April 1924, the published Kafka&#x27;s essay on Adalbert Stifter.

==== Max Brod ====
At the time of his death, Kafka&#x27;s works were probably known only to a small circle of Czech and German writers. Kafka left his work, both published and unpublished, to his friend and literary executor Max Brod with explicit instructions that it should be destroyed on Kafka&#x27;s death; Kafka wrote: &quot;Dearest Max, my last request: Everything I leave behind me... in the way of diaries, manuscripts, letters (my own and others&#x27;), sketches, and so on, [is] to be burned unread.&quot; Brod ignored this request and published the novels and collected works between 1925 and 1935. Brod defended his action by claiming that he had told Kafka, &quot;I shall not carry out your wishes&quot;, and that &quot;Franz should have appointed another executor if he had been absolutely determined that his instructions should stand&quot;.

Brod took many of Kafka&#x27;s papers, which remain unpublished, with him in suitcases to Palestine when he fled there in 1939. Kafka&#x27;s last lover, Dora Diamant (later, Dymant-Lask), also ignored his wishes, secretly keeping 20notebooks and 35letters. These were confiscated by the Gestapo in 1933, but scholars continue to search for them.

As Brod published the bulk of the writings in his possession, Kafka&#x27;s work began to attract wider attention and critical acclaim. Brod found it difficult to arrange Kafka&#x27;s notebooks in chronological order. One problem was that Kafka often began writing in different parts of the book; sometimes in the middle, sometimes working backwards from the end. Brod finished many of Kafka&#x27;s incomplete works for publication. For example, Kafka left with unnumbered and incomplete chapters and with incomplete sentences and ambiguous content; Brod rearranged chapters, copy-edited the text, and changed the punctuation. appeared in 1925 in . Kurt Wolff published two other novels, in 1926 and &quot;Amerika&quot; in 1927. In 1931, Brod edited a collection of prose and unpublished stories as &quot;The Great Wall of China&quot;, including the titular short story &quot;The Great Wall of China&quot;. The book appeared in the Gustav Kiepenheuer Verlag. Brod&#x27;s sets are usually called the &quot;Definitive Editions&quot;.

==== Modern editions ====
In 1961 Malcolm Pasley acquired for the Oxford Bodleian Library most of Kafka&#x27;s original handwritten works. The text for was later purchased through auction and is stored at the German Literary Archives in Marbach am Neckar, Germany. Subsequently, Pasley headed a team (including Gerhard Neumann, Jost Schillemeit and Jürgen Born) which reconstructed the German novels; republished them. Pasley was the editor for , published in 1982, and (&quot;The Trial&quot;), published in 1990. Jost Schillemeit was the editor of () published in 1983. These are called the &quot;Critical Editions&quot; or the &quot;Fischer Editions&quot;.

In 2023, the first unexpurgated edition of Kafka&#x27;s diaries was published in English, &quot;more than three decades after this complete text appeared in German. The sole previous English edition, with Brod&#x27;s edits, was issued in the late 1940s&quot;. The new edition revealed that Brod had expunged homoerotic references, and negative comments about Eastern European Jews.

==== Unpublished papers ====
When Brod died in 1968, he left Kafka&#x27;s unpublished papers, which are believed to number in the thousands, to his secretary Esther Hoffe. She released or sold some, but left most to her daughters, Eva and Ruth, who also refused to release the papers. A court battle began in 2008 between the sisters and the National Library of Israel, which claimed these works became the property of the nation of Israel when Brod emigrated to British Palestine in 1939. Esther Hoffe sold the original manuscript of for US$2 million in 1988 to the German Literary Archive Museum of Modern Literature in Marbach am Neckar. A ruling by a Tel Aviv family court in 2010 held that the papers must be released and a few were, including a previously unknown story, but the legal battle continued. The Hoffes claim the papers are their personal property, while the National Library of Israel argues they are &quot;cultural assets belonging to the Jewish people&quot;. The National Library also suggests that Brod bequeathed the papers to them in his will. The Tel Aviv Family Court ruled in October 2012, six months after Ruth&#x27;s death, that the papers were the property of the National Library. The Israeli Supreme Court upheld the decision in December 2016.

=== After-death biographies and critiques ===

After his death, Rudolf Kayser wrote an article titled &quot;Anmerkungen zu Franz Kafka&quot; for the &quot;Neue Rundschau&quot;, and Manfred Sturmann wrote a biographical essay titled &quot;Erinnerungen an Kafka&quot; for the &quot;Allgemeine Zeitung&quot;. In 1935, Brod wrote a biography. &quot;Since this work was written in German, however, it was not available to the majority of English critics&quot;.

From 1924 to 1927, Brod arranged for the publication of Kafka&#x27;s three unfinished novels and otherwise promoted Kafka&#x27;s works. During this period, many analytical essays were written about his work. In the late 1920s, 55 articles were written about Kafka&#x27;s work, most of them reviews and references. Examples include Heinrich Jacob&#x27;s &quot;Kafka oder die Wahrhaftigke&quot; for &quot;Der Feuerreiter&quot; in 1924 and Brod&#x27;s &quot;Infantilismus Kleist und Kafka&quot; in 1927.

Kafka&#x27;s work was translated to English in the 1930s, and American journals and magazines such as &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, &quot;The Nation and Athenaeum&quot;, &quot;The Nation&quot;, &quot;Scribners&quot;, &quot;New York Tribune&quot;, and &quot;The Bookman&quot;, wrote reviews about his books. &quot;The Castle&quot; was specially very well reviewed. But afterwards, until 1937, only three articles were written.

At the same time, in Germany, in 1930 only four articles were written, and the following year saw eight articles. But in 1932, only one article was published, possibly because of the rise of the National Socialist party, as there was a strong antisemitic bias at a time. In Nazi Germany, between 1933 and 1937, only 11 articles about Kafka were published, mostly by Jews in periodical such as &quot;Der Morgen&quot;, &quot;Frankfurter Zeitung&quot;, &quot;Jüdische Rundschau&quot;, and &quot;Hochland&quot;. From 1937 to 1939, no articles were written.

In 1937, &quot;The Trial&quot; was translated to English. There were 12 reviews in the United States, but the book was reviewed 20 times in other languages, including in France and Brazil. The reviews were mixed, with &quot;The New York Times&quot; reviewer stating that &quot;it is beyond me&quot; and other reviewers stating that Kafka was &quot;one of the most extraordinary writers of our time&quot;.

In the following year, &quot;Amerika&quot; was translated to English and generally well received by four English and two American reviewers. In the same year, &quot;Das Schloss&quot; was translated into French and received five reviews.

In 1939, Kafka&#x27;s work was reviewed in many countries, including in the periodicals &quot;The Southern Review&quot;, &quot;The Kenyon Review&quot; and &quot;Expressionism in German Life&quot;. In 1940, &quot;The Southern Review&quot; published a religious interpretation of &quot;The Trial&quot;. In 1941, eleven reviews and articles were published, including &quot;a doctor&#x27;s dissertation at the University of Zürich&quot; by Herbert Tauber, entitled &quot;Franz Kafka, eine Deutung seiner Werke&quot;. Other countries whose writers showed interest in Kafka&#x27;s work were Peru, Cuba, and Brazil.

In the first years of World War II, interest in Kafka&#x27;s work diminished in the United States, with only two articles published. In 1943, four articles were published, with one that &quot;criticized Kafka as a symbol of the social decadence which was responsible for the failure of the Weimar Republic&quot;. But in the following year, interest in his work increased again, with six articles published. As World War II drew to a close, interest in Kafka grew once again, with 16 articles appearing in various countries&#x27; periodicals, including &quot;Focus One&quot;, &quot;Quarterly Review of Literature&quot;, and &quot;Les Cahiers du Sud&quot;, as well as in the book &quot;Freudism and the Literary Mind&quot;. Many intellectuals grew interested on Kafka&#x27;s work, with articles by Parker Tyler in &quot;Accent&quot;, Albert Camus in &quot;Hope and Absurdity&quot;, and Jean Wahl in &quot;Kierkegaard and Kafka&quot; tying his work to existentialism. In 1946, Kafka&#x27;s work was popular, with 21 articles on it written that year.

=== Critical interpretations ===

The poet W. H. Auden called Kafka &quot;the Dante of the twentieth century&quot;; the novelist Vladimir Nabokov placed him among the greatest writers of the 20th century. Gabriel García Márquez noted the reading of Kafka&#x27;s &quot;The Metamorphosis&quot; showed him &quot;that it was possible to write in a different way&quot;. A prominent theme of Kafka&#x27;s work, first established in the short story &quot;Das Urteil&quot;, is father–son conflict: the guilt induced in the son is resolved through suffering and atonement. Other prominent themes and archetypes include alienation, physical and psychological brutality, characters on a terrifying quest, and mystical transformation.

Kafka&#x27;s style has been compared to that of Kleist as early as 1916, in a review of &quot;Die Verwandlung&quot; and &quot;Der Heizer&quot; by Oscar Walzel in &quot;Berliner Beiträge&quot;. The nature of Kafka&#x27;s prose allows for varied interpretations and critics have placed his writing into a variety of literary schools. Marxists, for example, have sharply disagreed over how to interpret Kafka&#x27;s works. Some accused him of distorting reality whereas others claimed he was critiquing capitalism. The hopelessness and absurdity common to his works are seen as emblematic of existentialism. Some of Kafka&#x27;s books are influenced by the expressionist movement, though the majority of his literary output was associated with the experimental modernist genre. Kafka also touches on the theme of human conflict with bureaucracy. William Burrows claims that such work is centred on the concepts of struggle, pain, solitude, and the need for relationships. Others, such as Thomas Mann, see Kafka&#x27;s work as allegorical: a quest, metaphysical in nature, for God.

According to Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari, the themes of alienation and persecution, although present in Kafka&#x27;s work, have been overemphasised by critics. They argue that Kafka&#x27;s work is more deliberate and subversive—and more joyful—than may first appear. They point out that reading Kafka while focusing on the futility of his characters&#x27; struggles reveals Kafka&#x27;s humour; he is not necessarily commenting on his own problems, but rather pointing out how people tend to invent problems. In his work, Kafka often creates malevolent, absurd worlds. Kafka read drafts of his works to his friends, typically concentrating on his humorous prose. The writer Milan Kundera suggests that Kafka&#x27;s surrealist humour may have been an inversion of Dostoevsky&#x27;s presentation of characters who are punished for a crime. In Kafka&#x27;s work, a character is punished although a crime has not been committed. Kundera believes that Kafka&#x27;s inspirations for his characteristic situations came both from growing up in a patriarchal family and from living in a totalitarian state.

Attempts have been made to identify the influence of Kafka&#x27;s legal background and the role of law in his fiction. Most interpretations identify aspects of law and legality as important in his work, in which the legal system is often oppressive. The law in Kafka&#x27;s works, rather than being representative of any particular legal or political entity, is usually interpreted to represent a collection of anonymous, incomprehensible forces. These are hidden from the individual but control the lives of the people, who are innocent victims of systems beyond their control. Critics who support this absurdist interpretation cite instances where Kafka describes himself in conflict with an absurd universe, such as the following entry from his diary:

However, James Hawes argues many of Kafka&#x27;s descriptions of the legal proceedings in —metaphysical, absurd, bewildering and nightmarish as they might appear—are based on accurate and informed descriptions of German and Austrian criminal proceedings of the time, which were inquisitorial rather than adversarial. Although he worked in insurance, as a trained lawyer Kafka was &quot;keenly aware of the legal debates of his day&quot;. In an early 21st-century publication that uses Kafka&#x27;s office writings as its point of departure, Pothik Ghosh states that with Kafka, law &quot;has no meaning outside its fact of being a pure force of domination and determination&quot;.

=== Translations ===

The first instance of Kafka being translated into English was in 1925, when William A. Drake published &quot;A Report for an Academy&quot; in the &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot;. Eugene Jolas translated Kafka&#x27;s &quot;The Judgment&quot; for the modernist journal &quot;transition&quot; in 1928. In 1930, Edwin and Willa Muir translated the first German edition of . This was published as &quot;The Castle&quot; by Secker &amp; Warburg in England and Alfred A. Knopf in the United States. In the 1930&#x27;s, Alberto Spaini translated &quot;The Process&quot; to Italian and Alexandre Vialatte translated it to French. A 1941 edition, including a homage by Thomas Mann, spurred a surge in Kafka&#x27;s popularity in the United States during the late 1940s. The Muirs translated all shorter works that Kafka had seen fit to print; they were published by Schocken Books in 1948 as &quot;The Penal Colony: Stories and Short Pieces&quot;, including additionally &quot;The First Long Train Journey&quot;, written by Kafka and Brod, Kafka&#x27;s &quot;A Novel about Youth&quot;, a review of Felix Sternheim&#x27;s &quot;Die Geschichte des jungen Oswald&quot;, his essay on Kleist&#x27;s &quot;Anecdotes&quot;, his review of the literary magazine &quot;Hyperion&quot;, and an epilogue by Brod.

Later editions, notably those of 1954 (&quot;Dearest Father: Stories and Other Writings&quot;), included text, translated by Eithne Wilkins and Ernst Kaiser, that had been deleted by earlier publishers. Known as &quot;Definitive Editions&quot;, they include translations of &quot;The Trial, Definitive&quot;, &quot;The Castle, Definitive&quot;, and other writings. These translations are generally accepted to have a number of biases and are considered to be dated in interpretation. Published in 1961 by Schocken Books, &quot;Parables and Paradoxes&quot; presented in a bilingual edition by Nahum N. Glatzer selected writings, drawn from notebooks, diaries, letters, short fictional works and the novel &quot;Der Process&quot;.

New translations were completed and published based on the recompiled German text of Pasley and Schillemeit&quot;The Castle, Critical&quot; by Mark Harman (Schocken Books, 1998), &quot;The Trial, Critical&quot; by Breon Mitchell (Schocken Books, 1998), and &quot;The Man Who Disappeared (Amerika)&quot; by Michael Hofmann (Penguin Books, 1996) and &quot;Amerika: The Missing Person&quot; by Mark Harman (Schocken Books, 2008).

==== Translation problems to English ====

Kafka often made extensive use of a characteristic particular to German, which permits long sentences that sometimes can span an entire page. Kafka&#x27;s sentences sometimes deliver an unexpected impact just before the full stop, finalizing the meaning and focus of the sentence. This is due to the construction of subordinate clauses in German, which require that the verb be at the end of the sentence. Such constructions are difficult to duplicate in English, so it is up to the translator to provide the reader with the same (or an at least equivalent) effect as the original text. German&#x27;s more flexible word order and syntactical differences provide for multiple ways in which the same German writing can be translated into English. An example is the first sentence of Kafka&#x27;s &quot;The Metamorphosis&quot;, which is crucial to the setting and understanding of the entire story:

The sentence above also exemplifies an instance of another difficult problem facing translators: dealing with the author&#x27;s intentional use of ambiguous idioms and words that have several meanings, which results in phrasing that is difficult to translate precisely. English translators often render the word as &#x27;insect&#x27;; in Middle German, however, literally means &#x27;an animal unclean for sacrifice&#x27;; in today&#x27;s German, it means &#x27;vermin&#x27;. It is sometimes used colloquially to mean &#x27;bug&#x27;—a very general term, unlike the scientific &#x27;insect&#x27;. Kafka had no intention of labeling Gregor, the protagonist of the story, as any specific thing but instead wanted to convey Gregor&#x27;s disgust at his transformation. Another example of this can be found in the final sentence of &quot;Das Urteil&quot; (&quot;The Judgement&quot;), with Kafka&#x27;s use of the German noun . Literally, means &#x27;intercourse&#x27; and, as in English, can have either a sexual or a non-sexual meaning. The word is additionally used to mean &#x27;transport&#x27; or &#x27;traffic&#x27;; therefore the sentence can also be translated as: &quot;At that moment an unending stream of traffic crossed over the bridge.&quot; The double meaning of &quot;Verkehr&quot; is given added weight by Kafka&#x27;s confession to Brod that when he wrote that final line he was thinking of &quot;a violent ejaculation&quot;.

=== Literary and cultural influence ===

Unlike many famous writers, Kafka is rarely quoted by others. Instead, he is noted more for his visions and perspective. Kafka had a strong influence on Gabriel García Márquez, Milan Kundera and the novel &quot;The Palace of Dreams&quot; by Ismail Kadare. Shimon Sandbank, a professor, literary critic, and writer, also identifies Kafka as having influenced Jorge Luis Borges, Albert Camus, Eugène Ionesco, J. M. Coetzee and Jean-Paul Sartre. A &quot;Financial Times&quot; literary critic credits Kafka with influencing José Saramago, and Al Silverman, a writer and editor, states that J. D. Salinger loved to read Kafka&#x27;s works. The Romanian writer Mircea Cărtărescu said &quot;Kafka is the author I love the most and who means, for me, the gate to literature&quot;; he also described Kafka as &quot;the saint of literature&quot;.

Kafka has been cited as an influence on the Swedish writer Stig Dagerman, and the Japanese writer Haruki Murakami, who paid homage to Kafka in his novel &quot;Kafka on the Shore&quot; with the namesake protagonist.
In 1999 a committee of 99 authors, scholars, and literary critics ranked and the second and ninth most significant German-language novels of the 20th century. Harold Bloom said &quot;when he is most himself, Kafka gives us a continuous inventiveness and originality that rivals Dante and truly challenges Proust and Joyce as that of the dominant Western author of our century&quot;. Sandbank argues that despite Kafka&#x27;s pervasiveness, his enigmatic style has yet to be emulated. Neil Christian Pages, a professor of German Studies and Comparative Literature at Binghamton University who specialises in Kafka&#x27;s works, says Kafka&#x27;s influence transcends literature and literary scholarship; it impacts visual arts, music, and popular culture. Harry Steinhauer, a professor of German and Jewish literature, says that Kafka &quot;has made a more powerful impact on literate society than any other writer of the twentieth century&quot;. Brod said that the 20th century will one day be known as the &quot;century of Kafka&quot;.

Michel-André Bossy writes that Kafka created a rigidly inflexible and sterile bureaucratic universe. Kafka wrote in an aloof manner full of legal and scientific terms. Yet his serious universe also had insightful humour, all highlighting the &quot;irrationality at the roots of a supposedly rational world&quot;. His characters are trapped, confused, full of guilt, frustrated, and lacking understanding of their surreal world. Much post-Kafka fiction, especially science fiction, follows the themes and precepts of Kafka&#x27;s universe. This can be seen in the works of authors such as George Orwell and Ray Bradbury.

The following are examples of works across a range of dramatic, literary, and musical genres that demonstrate the extent of Kafka&#x27;s cultural influence:

=== &quot;Kafkaesque&quot; ===

The term &quot;Kafkaesque&quot; is used to describe concepts and situations reminiscent of Kafka&#x27;s work, particularly (&quot;The Trial&quot;) and &quot;Die Verwandlung&quot; (&quot;The Metamorphosis&quot;). Examples include instances in which bureaucracies overpower people, often in a surreal, nightmarish milieu that evokes feelings of senselessness, disorientation, and helplessness. Characters in a Kafkaesque setting often lack a clear course of action to escape a labyrinthine situation. Kafkaesque elements often appear in existential works, but the term has transcended the literary realm to apply to real-life occurrences and situations that are incomprehensibly complex, bizarre, or illogical.

Numerous films and television works have been described as Kafkaesque, and the style is particularly prominent in dystopian science fiction. Works in this genre that have been thus described include Patrick Bokanowski&#x27;s film &quot;The Angel&quot; (1982), Terry Gilliam&#x27;s film &quot;Brazil&quot; (1985), and Alex Proyas&#x27; science fiction film noir, &quot;Dark City&quot; (1998). Films from other genres which have been similarly described include Roman Polanski&#x27;s &quot;The Tenant&quot; (1976), Joseph Losey’s &quot;Monsieur Klein&quot; (1976) and the Coen brothers&#x27; &quot;Barton Fink&quot; (1991). The television series &quot;The Prisoner&quot; and &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; are also frequently described as Kafkaesque.

However, with common usage, the term has become so ubiquitous that Kafka scholars note it is often misused. More accurately then, according to author Ben Marcus, paraphrased in &quot;What it Means to be Kafkaesque&quot; by Joe Fassler in &quot;The Atlantic&quot;, &quot;Kafka&#x27;s quintessential qualities are affecting use of language, a setting that straddles fantasy and reality, and a sense of striving even in the face of bleakness—hopelessly and full of hope.&quot;

3412 Kafka is an asteroid from the inner regions of the asteroid belt, approximately 6 kilometers in diameter. It was discovered on 10 January 1983 by American astronomers Randolph Kirk and Donald Rudy at Palomar Observatory in California, United States, and named after Kafka by them.

The Franz Kafka Museum in Prague is dedicated to Kafka and his work. A major component of the museum is an exhibit, &quot;The City of K. Franz Kafka and Prague&quot;, which was first shown in Barcelona in 1999, moved to the Jewish Museum in New York City, and finally established in Prague in Malá Strana (Lesser Town), along the Moldau, in 2005. The museum aims with this exhibit to immerse the visitor into the world in which Kafka lived and about which he wrote.

The Franz Kafka Prize, established in 2001, is an annual literary award of the Franz Kafka Society and the City of Prague. It recognizes the merits of literature as &quot;humanistic character and contribution to cultural, national, language and religious tolerance, its existential, timeless character, its generally human validity, and its ability to hand over a testimony about our times&quot;. The selection committee and recipients come from all over the world, but are limited to living authors who have had at least one work published in Czech. The recipient receives $10,000, a diploma, and a bronze statuette at a presentation in Prague&#x27;s Old Town Hall, on the Czech State Holiday in late October.

San Diego State University operates the Kafka Project, which began in 1998 as the official international search for Kafka&#x27;s last writings.

<text>The Fields Medal is a prize awarded to two, three, or four mathematicians under 40 years of age at the International Congress of the International Mathematical Union (IMU), a meeting that takes place every four years. The name of the award honours the Canadian mathematician John Charles Fields.

The Fields Medal is regarded as one of the highest honors a mathematician can receive, and has been described as the Nobel Prize of Mathematics, although there are several major differences, including frequency of award, number of awards, age limits, monetary value, and award criteria. According to the annual Academic Excellence Survey by ARWU, the Fields Medal is consistently regarded as the top award in the field of mathematics worldwide, and in another reputation survey conducted by IREG in 2013–14, the Fields Medal came closely after the Abel Prize as the second most prestigious international award in mathematics.

The prize includes a monetary award which, since 2006, has been 15,000. Fields was instrumental in establishing the award, designing the medal himself, and funding the monetary component, though he died before it was established and his plan was overseen by John Lighton Synge.

The medal was first awarded in 1936 to Finnish mathematician Lars Ahlfors and American mathematician Jesse Douglas, and it has been awarded every four years since 1950. Its purpose is to give recognition and support to younger mathematical researchers who have made major contributions. In 2014, the Iranian mathematician Maryam Mirzakhani became the first female Fields Medalist. In total, 64 people have been awarded the Fields Medal.

The most recent group of Fields Medalists received their awards on 5 July 2022 in an online event which was live-streamed from Helsinki, Finland. It was originally meant to be held in Saint Petersburg, Russia, but was moved following the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine.

==Conditions of the award==
The Fields Medal has for a long time been regarded as the most prestigious award in the field of mathematics and is often described as the Nobel Prize of Mathematics. Unlike the Nobel Prize, the Fields Medal is only awarded every four years. The Fields Medal also has an age limit: a recipient must be under age 40 on 1 January of the year in which the medal is awarded. The under-40 rule is based on Fields&#x27;s desire that &quot;while it was in recognition of work already done, it was at the same time intended to be an encouragement for further achievement on the part of the recipients and a stimulus to renewed effort on the part of others.&quot; Moreover, an individual can only be awarded one Fields Medal; winners are ineligible to be awarded future medals.

First awarded in 1936, 64 people have won the medal as of 2022. With the exception of two PhD holders in physics (Edward Witten and Martin Hairer), only people with a PhD in mathematics have won the medal.

==List of Fields medalists==
In certain years, the Fields medalists have been officially cited for particular mathematical achievements, while in other years such specificities have not been given. However, in every year that the medal has been awarded, noted mathematicians have lectured at the International Congress of Mathematicians on each medalist&#x27;s body of work. In the following table, official citations are quoted when possible (namely for the years 1958, 1998, and every year since 2006). For the other years through 1986, summaries of the ICM lectures, as written by Donald Albers, Gerald L. Alexanderson, and Constance Reid, are quoted. In the remaining years (1990, 1994, and 2002), part of the text of the ICM lecture itself has been quoted. The upcoming awarding of the Fields Medal at the 2026 International Congress of the International Mathematical Union is planned to take place in Philadelphia.

==Landmarks==
The medal was first awarded in 1936 to the Finnish mathematician Lars Ahlfors and the American mathematician Jesse Douglas, and it has been awarded every four years since 1950. Its purpose is to give recognition and support to younger mathematical researchers who have made major contributions.

In 1954, Jean-Pierre Serre became the youngest winner of the Fields Medal, at 27. He retains this distinction.

In 1966, Alexander Grothendieck boycotted the ICM, held in Moscow, to protest Soviet military actions taking place in Eastern Europe. Léon Motchane, founder and director of the Institut des Hautes Études Scientifiques, attended and accepted Grothendieck&#x27;s Fields Medal on his behalf.

In 1970, Sergei Novikov, because of restrictions placed on him by the Soviet government, was unable to travel to the congress in Nice to receive his medal.

In 1978, Grigory Margulis, because of restrictions placed on him by the Soviet government, was unable to travel to the congress in Helsinki to receive his medal. The award was accepted on his behalf by Jacques Tits, who said in his address: &quot;I cannot but express my deep disappointment—no doubt shared by many people here—in the absence of Margulis from this ceremony. In view of the symbolic meaning of this city of Helsinki, I had indeed grounds to hope that I would have a chance at last to meet a mathematician whom I know only through his work and for whom I have the greatest respect and admiration.&quot;

In 1982, the congress was due to be held in Warsaw but had to be rescheduled to the next year, because of martial law introduced in Poland on 13 December 1981. The awards were announced at the ninth General Assembly of the IMU earlier in the year and awarded at the 1983 Warsaw congress.

In 1990, Edward Witten became the first physicist to win the award.

In 1998, at the ICM, Andrew Wiles was presented by the chair of the Fields Medal Committee, Yuri I. Manin, with the first-ever IMU silver plaque in recognition of his proof of Fermat&#x27;s Last Theorem. Don Zagier referred to the plaque as a &quot;quantized Fields Medal&quot;. Accounts of this award frequently make reference that at the time of the award Wiles was over the age limit for the Fields medal. Although Wiles was slightly over the age limit in 1994, he was thought to be a favorite to win the medal; however, a gap (later resolved by Taylor and Wiles) in the proof was found in 1993.

In 2006, Grigori Perelman, who proved the Poincaré conjecture, refused his Fields Medal and did not attend the congress.

In 2014, Maryam Mirzakhani became the first Iranian as well as the first woman to win the Fields Medal, and Artur Avila became the first South American and Manjul Bhargava became the first person of Indian origin to do so.

In 2022, Maryna Viazovska became the first Ukrainian to win the Fields Medal, and June Huh became the first person of Korean ancestry to do so.

==Medal==

The medal was designed by Canadian sculptor R. Tait McKenzie. It is made of 14KT gold, has a diameter of 63.5mm, and weighs 169g.

* On the obverse is Archimedes and a quote attributed to 1st century AD poet Manilius, which reads in Latin: (&quot;To surpass one&#x27;s understanding and master the world&quot;). The year number 1933 is written in Roman numerals and contains an error (MCNXXXIII rather than MCMXXXIII). In capital Greek letters the word Ἀρχιμηδους, or &quot;of Archimedes,&quot; is inscribed.
* On the reverse is the inscription:

Translation: &quot;Mathematicians gathered from the entire world have awarded [understood but not written: &#x27;this prize&#x27;] for outstanding writings.&quot;

In the background, there is the representation of Archimedes&#x27; tomb, with the carving illustrating his theorem On the Sphere and Cylinder, behind an olive branch. (This is the mathematical result of which Archimedes was reportedly most proud: Given a sphere and a circumscribed cylinder of the same height and diameter, the ratio between their volumes is equal to .)

The rim bears the name of the prizewinner.

==Female recipients==

The Fields Medal has had two female recipients, Maryam Mirzakhani from Iran in 2014, and Maryna Viazovska from Ukraine in 2022.
==In popular culture==

The Fields Medal gained some recognition in popular culture due to references in the 1997 film, &quot;Good Will Hunting&quot;. In the movie, Gerald Lambeau (Stellan Skarsgård) is an MIT professor who won the award prior to the events of the story. Throughout the film, references made to the award are meant to convey its prestige in the field.

<doc id="10861" wikidata="Q36097" url="?curid=10861" title="The Trial">
<text>The Trial () is a novel written by Franz Kafka in 1914 and 1915 and published posthumously on 26 April 1925. One of his best-known works, it tells the story of Josef K., a man arrested and prosecuted by a remote, inaccessible authority, with the nature of his crime revealed neither to him nor to the reader. Heavily influenced by Dostoevsky&#x27;s &quot;Crime and Punishment&quot; and &quot;The Brothers Karamazov&quot;, Kafka even went so far as to call Dostoevsky a blood relative. Like Kafka&#x27;s two other novels, &quot;The Castle&quot; and &quot;Amerika&quot;, &quot;The Trial&quot; was never completed, although it does include a chapter that appears to bring the story to an intentionally abrupt ending.

After Kafka&#x27;s death in 1924, his friend and literary executor Max Brod edited the text for publication by Verlag Die Schmiede. The original manuscript is held at the Museum of Modern Literature, Marbach am Neckar, Germany. The first English-language translation, by Willa and Edwin Muir, was published in 1937. In 1999, the book was listed in &quot;Le Monde&quot; 100 Books of the Century and as No. 2 of the Best German Novels of the Twentieth Century.

==Development==
Kafka drafted the opening sentence of &quot;The Trial&quot; in August 1914 and worked on the novel throughout 1915. This was an unusually productive period for Kafka, despite the outbreak of World War I, which significantly increased the pressures of his day job as an insurance agent.

Having begun by writing the opening and concluding sections of the novel, Kafka worked on the intervening scenes in a haphazard manner, using several different notebooks simultaneously. His friend Max Brod, knowing Kafka&#x27;s habit of destroying his own work, eventually took the manuscript for safekeeping. It consisted of 161 loose pages torn from notebooks, which Kafka had bundled together into chapters. The order of the chapters was not made clear to Brod; nor was he told which parts were complete and which were unfinished. Following Kafka&#x27;s death in 1924, Brod edited the work and assembled it into a novel to the best of his ability. Further editorial work has been done by later scholars, but Kafka&#x27;s final vision for &quot;The Trial&quot; remains unknown.

==Plot summary==

On the morning of his thirtieth birthday, Josef K., the chief clerk of a bank, is unexpectedly arrested by two agents from an unidentified agency for an unspecified crime. The agents discuss the situation with Josef in the unoccupied room of his fellow lodger Fräulein Bürstner, in the unexplained presence of three junior clerks from Josef&#x27;s bank. Josef is not imprisoned, but left free to go about his business. His landlady, Frau Grubach, tries to console Josef about the trial. He visits Bürstner to explain the events, and then harasses her by kissing her without consent.

Josef finds that Fräulein Montag, a lodger from another room, has moved in with Fräulein Bürstner. He suspects that this is a coy manoeuvre meant to distance him from Bürstner, and resolves that she will eventually fall for his charms.

Josef is summoned to appear at the court&#x27;s address the coming Sunday, without being told the time or location. After a period of exploration he finds the court in the attic of a dilapidated working-class tenement block, at the back of a young washerwoman&#x27;s home. Josef is rebuked for his lateness and mistaken for a house painter rather than a bank clerk. He arouses the assembly&#x27;s hostility after a passionate plea about the absurdity of the trial and the falseness of the accusation, despite still not knowing the charges. The proceedings are interrupted by a man sexually assaulting the washerwoman in a corner. Josef notices that all the assembly members are wearing pins on their lapels which he interprets as signifying their membership of a secret organisation.

The following Sunday Josef goes to the courtroom again, but the court is not in session. The washerwoman gives him information about the process and attempts to seduce him before a law student, the man who assaulted her the previous week, takes her away, claiming her to be his mistress. The woman&#x27;s husband, a court usher, then takes Josef on a tour of the court offices, which ends after Josef becomes extremely weak in the presence of other court officials and defendants.

One evening, in a storage room at his own bank, Josef discovers the two agents who arrested him being whipped for soliciting bribes from Josef, which he had complained about at court. Josef tries to argue with the flogger, saying that the men need not be whipped, but the flogger cannot be swayed. The next day he returns to the storage room and is shocked to find everything as he had found it the day before, including the whipper and the two agents.

Josef is visited by his uncle Karl, who lives in the country. Worried by the rumors about his nephew, Karl introduces Josef to Herr Huld, a sickly and bedridden lawyer tended to by Leni, a young woman who shows an immediate attraction to Josef. During a conversation between Karl and Huld about Josef&#x27;s case, Leni calls Josef away for a sexual encounter. Afterwards, Josef meets his angry uncle outside, who claims that Josef&#x27;s lack of respect for the advocate, by leaving the meeting and romantically engaging with the woman who is apparently Huld&#x27;s mistress, has hurt his case.

Josef has become increasingly preoccupied by his case, to the detriment of his work. He has further meetings with Huld, and continues to engage in discreet trysts with Leni, but the advocate&#x27;s work appears to be having no effect on the proceedings. At the bank, one of Josef&#x27;s clients recommends he seek the advice of Titorelli, the court&#x27;s official painter. Titorelli outlines the options he can help Josef pursue: indefinite postponement of the process, or a temporary acquittal that could at any point result in re-arrest. Unequivocal acquittal is not a viable option. 

Suspicious of the advocate&#x27;s motives and the apparent lack of progress, Josef finally decides to dismiss Huld and take control of matters himself. Upon arriving at Huld&#x27;s office, he meets a downtrodden merchant, Rudi Block, who offers Josef some insight from a fellow defendant&#x27;s perspective. Block&#x27;s case has continued for five years and he has gone from being a successful businessman to being almost bankrupt and is virtually enslaved by his dependence on the lawyer and Leni, with whom he appears to be sexually involved. The lawyer mocks Block in front of Josef for his dog-like subservience. This experience further poisons Josef&#x27;s opinion of his lawyer.

Josef is put in charge of accompanying an important Italian client to the city&#x27;s cathedral, but the client never meets him there. While inside the cathedral, a priest calls Josef by name and tells him a fable (which was published earlier as &quot;Before the Law&quot;) that is meant to explain his situation. The priest tells Josef that the parable is an ancient text of the court, and many generations of court officials have interpreted it differently.

On the eve of Josef&#x27;s thirty-first birthday, two men arrive at his apartment. The three walk through the city, and Josef catches a brief glimpse of Fräulein Bürstner. They arrive at a small quarry outside the city, and the men kill Josef, stabbing him in the heart with a butcher&#x27;s knife while strangling him. Josef summarizes his situation with his last words: &quot;Like a dog!&quot;.

<text>The Metamorphosis (), also translated as The Transformation, is a novella by Franz Kafka published in 1915. One of Kafka&#x27;s best-known works, &quot;The Metamorphosis&quot; tells the story of salesman Gregor Samsa, who wakes one morning to find himself inexplicably transformed into a huge insect (, &quot; vermin&quot;) and struggles to adjust to this condition. The novella has been widely discussed among literary critics, who have offered varied interpretations. In popular culture and adaptations of the novella, the insect is commonly depicted as a cockroach. 

About 70 printed pages, it is the longest of the stories Kafka considered complete and published during his lifetime. It was first published in 1915 in the October issue of the journal &quot;Die weißen Blätter&quot; under the editorship of René Schickele. The first edition in book form appeared in December 1915 in the series &quot;Der jüngste Tag&quot;, edited by Kurt Wolff.

==Plot==
Gregor Samsa wakes up one morning to find himself transformed into a &quot;monstrous vermin&quot;. He initially considers the transformation to be temporary and slowly ponders the consequences of his metamorphosis. Stuck on his back and unable to get up and leave the bed, Gregor reflects on his job as a traveling salesman and cloth merchant, which he characterizes as being full of &quot;temporary and constantly changing human relationships, which never come from the heart&quot;. He sees his employer as a despot and would quickly quit his job if he were not his family&#x27;s sole breadwinner and working off his bankrupt father&#x27;s debts. While trying to move, Gregor finds that his office manager, the chief clerk, has shown up to check on him, indignant about Gregor&#x27;s unexcused absence. Gregor attempts to communicate with both the manager and his family, but all they can hear from behind the door is incomprehensible vocalizations. Gregor laboriously drags himself across the floor and opens the door. The clerk, upon seeing the transformed Gregor, flees the apartment. Gregor&#x27;s family is horrified, and his father drives him back towards his room. Gregor is injured when he tries to force himself through the doorway (which is too narrow for him), but gets unstuck when his father shoves him through.

With Gregor&#x27;s unexpected transformation, his family is deprived of financial stability. They keep Gregor locked in his room, and he begins to accept his new identity and adapt to his new body. His sister Grete is the only one willing to bring him food, which she finds Gregor only likes if it is rotten. He spends much of his time crawling around on the floor, walls, and ceiling. Upon discovering Gregor&#x27;s new pastime, Grete decides to remove his furniture to give him more space. She and her mother begin to empty the room of everything, except the sofa under which Gregor hides whenever anyone comes in. He finds their actions deeply distressing, fearing that he might forget his past as a human, and desperately tries to save a particularly loved portrait on the wall of a woman clad in fur. His mother loses consciousness at the sight of him clinging to the image to protect it. When Grete rushes out of the room to get some aromatic spirits, Gregor follows her and is slightly hurt when she drops a medicine bottle and it breaks. Their father returns home and angrily hurls apples at Gregor, one of which becomes lodged in a sensitive spot in his back and severely wounds him.

Gregor suffers from his injuries and eats very little. His father, mother, and sister all get jobs and increasingly begin to neglect him, and his room begins to be used for storage. For a time, his family leaves Gregor&#x27;s door open in the evenings so he can listen to them talk to each other, but this happens less frequently once they rent a room in the apartment to three male tenants, since they are not told about Gregor. One day, the charwoman, who briefly looks in on Gregor each day when she arrives and before she leaves, neglects to close his door fully. Attracted by Grete&#x27;s violin-playing in the living room, Gregor crawls out and is spotted by the unsuspecting tenants, who complain about the apartment&#x27;s unhygienic conditions and say they are leaving, will not pay anything for the time they have already stayed, and may take legal action. Grete, who is tired of taking care of Gregor and realizes the burden his existence puts on each member of the family, tells her parents they must get rid of &quot;it&quot; or they will all be ruined. Gregor, understanding that he is no longer wanted, laboriously makes his way back to his room and dies of starvation before sunrise. His body is discovered by the charwoman, who alerts his family and then disposes of the corpse. The relieved and optimistic father, mother, and sister all take the day off work. They travel by tram into the countryside and make plans to move to a smaller apartment to save money. During the short trip, Mr. and Mrs. Samsa realize that, despite the hardships that have brought some paleness to her face, Grete has grown up into a pretty young lady with a good figure and they think about finding her a husband.

==Characters==

===Gregor Samsa===

Gregor is the main character of the story. He works as a traveling salesman in order to provide money for his sister and parents. He wakes up one morning finding himself transformed into an insect. After the metamorphosis, Gregor becomes unable to work and is confined to his room for most of the remainder of the story. This prompts his family to begin working once again. Gregor is depicted as isolated from society and often both misunderstands the true intentions of others and is misunderstood.

===Grete Samsa===
Grete is Gregor&#x27;s younger sister, and she becomes his caretaker after his metamorphosis. They initially have a close relationship, but this quickly fades. At first, she volunteers to feed him and clean his room, but she grows increasingly impatient with the burden and begins to leave his room in disarray out of spite. Her initial decision to take care of Gregor may have come from a desire to contribute and be useful to the family, since she becomes angry and upset when the mother cleans his room. It is made clear that Grete is disgusted by Gregor, as she always opens the window upon entering his room to keep from feeling nauseous and leaves without doing anything if Gregor is in plain sight. She plays the violin and dreams of going to the conservatory to study, a dream Gregor had intended to make happen; he had planned on making the announcement on Christmas Day. To help provide an income for the family after Gregor&#x27;s transformation, she starts working as a salesgirl. Grete is also the first to suggest getting rid of Gregor, which causes Gregor to plan his own death. At the end of the story, Grete&#x27;s parents realize that she has become beautiful and full-figured and decide to consider finding her a husband.

===Mr. Samsa===
Mr. Samsa is Gregor&#x27;s father. After the metamorphosis, he is forced to return to work in order to support the family financially. His attitude towards his son is harsh. He regards the transformed Gregor with disgust and possibly even fear and attacks Gregor on several occasions. Even when Gregor was human, Mr. Samsa regarded him mostly as a source of income for the family. Gregor&#x27;s relationship with his father is modelled after Kafka&#x27;s own relationship with his father. The theme of alienation becomes quite evident here.

===Mrs. Samsa===
Mrs. Samsa is Gregor&#x27;s mother. She is portrayed as a submissive wife. She suffers from asthma, which is a constant source of concern for Gregor. She is initially shocked at Gregor&#x27;s transformation, but she still wants to enter his room. However, it proves too much for her and gives rise to a conflict between her maternal impulse and sympathy and her fear and revulsion at Gregor&#x27;s new form.

===The Charwoman===
The charwoman is an old widowed lady who is employed by the Samsa family after their previous maid begs to be dismissed on account of the fright she experiences owing to Gregor&#x27;s new form. She is paid to take care of their household duties. Apart from Grete and her father, the charwoman is the only person who is in close contact with Gregor, and she is unafraid in her dealings with Gregor. She does not question his changed state; she seemingly accepts it as a normal part of his existence. She is the one who notices Gregor has died and disposes of his body.

== Interpretation ==
Like much of Kafka&#x27;s work, &quot;The Metamorphosis&quot; tends to be given a religious (Max Brod) or psychological interpretation. It has been particularly common to read the story as an expression of Kafka&#x27;s father complex, as was first done by Charles Neider in his &quot;The Frozen Sea: A Study of Franz Kafka&quot; (1948). Besides the psychological approach, interpretations focusing on sociological aspects, which see the Samsa family as a portrayal of general social circumstances, have also gained a large following.

Vladimir Nabokov rejected such interpretations, noting that they do not live up to Kafka&#x27;s art. He instead chose an interpretation guided by the artistic detail but excluded any symbolic or allegoric meanings. Arguing against the popular father-complex theory, he observed that it is the sister more than the father who should be considered the cruelest person in the story, since she is the one backstabbing Gregor. In Nabokov&#x27;s view, the central narrative theme is the artist&#x27;s struggle for existence in a society replete with narrow-minded people who destroy him step by step. Commenting on Kafka&#x27;s style, he writes, &quot;The transparency of his style underlines the dark richness of his fantasy world. Contrast and uniformity, style and the depicted, portrayal and fable are seamlessly intertwined&quot;.

In 1989, Nina Pelikan Straus wrote a feminist interpretation of &quot;The Metamorphosis&quot;, noting that the story is not only about the metamorphosis of Gregor but also about the metamorphosis of his family and, in particular, his younger sister Grete. Straus suggested that the social and psychoanalytic resonances of the text depend on Grete&#x27;s role as a woman, daughter, and sister, and that prior interpretations failed to recognize Grete&#x27;s centrality to the story.

In 1999, Gerhard Rieck pointed out that Gregor and his sister, Grete, form a pair, which is typical of many of Kafka&#x27;s texts: it is made up of one passive, rather austere, person and another active, more libidinal, person. The appearance of figures with such almost irreconcilable personalities who form couples in Kafka&#x27;s works has been evident since he wrote his short story &quot;Description of a Struggle&quot; (e.g. the narrator/young man and his &quot;acquaintance&quot;). They also appear in &quot;The Judgment&quot; (Georg and his friend in Russia), in all three of his novels (e.g. Robinson and Delamarche in &quot;Amerika&quot;) as well as in his short stories &quot;A Country Doctor&quot; (the country doctor and the groom) and &quot;A Hunger Artist&quot; (the hunger artist and the panther). Rieck views these pairs as parts of one single person (hence the similarity between the names Gregor and Grete) and in the final analysis as the two determining components of the author&#x27;s personality. Not only in Kafka&#x27;s life but also in his oeuvre does Rieck see the description of a fight between these two parts.

Reiner Stach argued in 2004 that no elucidating comments were needed to illustrate the story and that it was convincing by itself, self-contained, even absolute. He believes that there is no doubt the story would have been admitted to the canon of world literature even if we had known nothing about its author.

According to Peter-André Alt (2005), the figure of the insect becomes a drastic expression of Gregor Samsa&#x27;s deprived existence. Reduced to carrying out his professional responsibilities, anxious to guarantee his advancement and vexed with the fear of making commercial mistakes, he is the creature of a functionalistic professional life.

In 2007, Ralf Sudau took the view that particular attention should be paid to the motifs of self-abnegation and disregard for reality. Gregor&#x27;s earlier behavior was characterized by self-renunciation and his pride in being able to provide a secure and leisured existence for his family. When he finds himself in a situation where he himself is in need of attention and assistance and in danger of becoming a parasite, he doesn&#x27;t want to admit this new role to himself and be disappointed by the treatment he receives from his family, which is becoming more and more careless and even hostile over time. According to Sudau, Gregor is self-denyingly hiding his nauseating appearance under the sofa and gradually famishing, thus pretty much complying with the more or less blatant wish of his family. His gradual emaciation and &quot;self-reduction&quot; shows signs of a fatal hunger strike (which on the part of Gregor is unconscious and unsuccessful, on the part of his family not understood or ignored). Sudau also lists the names of selected interpreters of &quot;The Metamorphosis&quot; (e.g. Beicken, Sokel, Sautermeister and Schwarz). According to them, the narrative is a metaphor for the suffering resulting from leprosy, an escape into the disease or a symptom onset, an image of an existence which is defaced by the career, or a revealing staging which cracks the veneer and superficiality of everyday circumstances and exposes its cruel essence. He further notes that Kafka&#x27;s representational style is on one hand characterized by an idiosyncratic interpenetration of realism and fantasy, a worldly mind, rationality, and clarity of observation, and on the other hand by folly, outlandishness, and fallacy. He also points to the grotesque and tragicomical, silent film-like elements.

Fernando Bermejo-Rubio (2012) argued that the story is often viewed unjustly as inconclusive. He derives his interpretative approach from the fact that the descriptions of Gregor and his family environment in &quot;The Metamorphosis&quot; contradict each other. Diametrically opposed versions exist of Gregor&#x27;s back, his voice, of whether he is ill or already undergoing the metamorphosis, whether he is dreaming or not, which treatment he deserves, of his moral point of view (false accusations made by Grete), and whether his family is blameless or not. Bermejo-Rubio emphasizes that Kafka ordered in 1915 that there should be no illustration of Gregor. He argues that it is exactly this absence of a visual narrator that is essential for Kafka&#x27;s project, for he who depicts Gregor would stylize himself as an omniscient narrator. Another reason why Kafka opposed such an illustration is that the reader should not be biased in any way before reading. That the descriptions are not compatible with each other is indicative of the fact that the opening statement is not to be trusted. If the reader isn&#x27;t hoodwinked by the first sentence and still thinks of Gregor as a human being, he will view the story as conclusive and realize that Gregor is a victim of his own degeneration.

Volker Drüke (2013) believes that the crucial metamorphosis in the story is that of Grete. She is the character the title is directed at. Gregor&#x27;s metamorphosis is followed by him languishing and ultimately dying. Grete, by contrast, has matured as a result of the new family circumstances and assumed responsibility. In the end – after the brother&#x27;s death – the parents also notice that their daughter, &quot;who was getting more animated all the time, [...] had recently blossomed into a pretty and shapely girl&quot;, and they want to look for a partner for her. From this standpoint Grete&#x27;s transition, her metamorphosis from a girl into a woman, is the subtextual theme of the story.

== Translations of the opening sentence ==
&quot;The Metamorphosis&quot; has been translated into English more than twenty times. In Kafka&#x27;s original, the opening sentence is &quot;&quot;. In their 1933 translation of the story – the first into English – Willa Muir and Edwin Muir rendered it as &quot;As Gregor Samsa awoke one morning from uneasy dreams he found himself transformed in his bed into a gigantic insect&quot;.

The phrase &quot;ungeheuren Ungeziefer&quot;, describing the creature into which Gregor Samsa metamorphoses, has been translated in at least sixteen different ways. These include the following:
* &quot;gigantic insect&quot; (Willa and Edwin Muir, 1933)
* &quot;monstrous kind of vermin&quot; (A. L. Lloyd, 1946)
* &quot;monstrous vermin&quot; (Stanley Corngold, 1972; Joachim Neugroschel, 1993; Donna Freed, 1996)
* &quot;giant bug&quot; (J. A. Underwood, 1981)
* &quot;monstrous insect&quot; (Malcolm Pasley, 1992; Richard Stokes, 2002; Katja Pelzer, 2017; Mark Harman, 2024)
* &quot;enormous bug&quot; (Stanley Appelbaum, 1996)
* &quot;gargantuan pest&quot; (M. A. Roberts, 2005)
* &quot;monstrous cockroach&quot; (Michael Hofmann, 2007)
* &quot;monstrous verminous bug&quot; (Ian Johnston, 2007)
* &quot;a vile insect, one of gigantic proportions&quot; (Philip Lundberg, 2007)
* &quot;some kind of monstrous vermin&quot; (Joyce Crick, 2009)
* &quot;horrible vermin&quot; (David Wyllie, 2011; unnamed translator, 2023)
* &quot;some sort of monstrous insect&quot; (Susan Bernofsky, 2014)
* &quot;some kind of monstrous bedbug&quot; (Christopher Moncrieff, 2014)
* &quot;huge verminous insect&quot; (John R. Williams, 2014)
* &quot;a kind of giant bug&quot; (William Aaltonen, 2023)

In Middle High German, &quot;Ungeziefer&quot; literally means &quot;unclean animal not suitable for sacrifice&quot; and is sometimes used colloquially to mean &quot;bug&quot;, with the connotation of &quot;dirty, nasty bug&quot;. It can also be translated as &quot;vermin&quot;. English translators of &quot;The Metamorphosis&quot; have often rendered it as &quot;insect&quot;.

What kind of bug or vermin Kafka envisaged remains a debated mystery. Kafka had no intention of labeling Gregor as any specific thing, but instead was trying to convey Gregor&#x27;s disgust at his transformation. In his letter to his publisher of 25 October 1915, in which he discusses his concern about the cover illustration for the first edition, Kafka does use the term &quot;Insekt&quot;, though, saying &quot;The insect itself is not to be drawn. It is not even to be seen from a distance.&quot;

Vladimir Nabokov, who was a lepidopterist as well as a writer and literary critic, concluded from details in the text that Gregor was not a cockroach, but a beetle with wings under his shell, and capable of flight. Nabokov left a sketch annotated &quot;just over three feet long&quot; on the opening page of his English teaching copy. In his accompanying lecture notes, he discusses the type of insect Gregor has been transformed into. Noting that the cleaning lady addressed Gregor as &quot;dung beetle&quot; (), e.g., &quot;Come here for a bit, old dung beetle!&quot; or &quot;Hey, look at the old dung beetle!&quot;, Nabokov remarks that this was just her friendly way of addressing him, and that Gregor &quot;is not, technically, a dung beetle. He is merely a big beetle.&quot;

<doc id="10868" wikidata="Q5432" url="?curid=10868" title="Francisco Goya">
<text>Francisco José de Goya y Lucientes (; ; 30 March 1746 – 16 April 1828) was a Spanish romantic painter and printmaker. He is considered the most important Spanish artist of the late 18th and early 19th centuries. His paintings, drawings, and engravings reflected contemporary historical upheavals and influenced important 19th- and 20th-century painters. Goya is often referred to as the last of the Old Masters and the first of the moderns.

Goya was born in Fuendetodos, Aragon to a middle-class family in 1746. He studied painting from age 14 under José Luzán y Martinez and moved to Madrid to study with Anton Raphael Mengs. He married Josefa Bayeu in 1773. Goya became a court painter to the Spanish Crown in 1786 and this early portion of his career is marked by portraits of the Spanish aristocracy and royalty, and Rococo-style tapestry cartoons designed for the royal palace.

Although Goya&#x27;s letters and writings survive, little is known about his thoughts. He had a severe and undiagnosed illness in 1793 that left him deaf, after which his work became progressively darker and more pessimistic. His later easel and mural paintings, prints and drawings appear to reflect a bleak outlook on personal, social, and political levels and contrast with his social climbing. He was appointed Director of the Royal Academy in 1795, the year Manuel Godoy made an unfavorable treaty with France. In 1799, Goya became &quot;Primer Pintor de Cámara&quot; (Prime Court Painter), the highest rank for a Spanish court painter. In the late 1790s, commissioned by Godoy, he completed his &quot;La maja desnuda&quot;, a remarkably daring nude for the time and clearly indebted to Diego Velázquez. In 1800–01, he painted &quot;Charles IV of Spain and His Family&quot;, also influenced by Velázquez.

In 1807, Napoleon led the French army into the Peninsular War against Spain. Goya remained in Madrid during the war, which seems to have affected him deeply. Although he did not speak his thoughts in public, they can be inferred from his &quot;Disasters of War&quot; series of prints (although published 35 years after his death) and his 1814 paintings &quot;The Second of May 1808&quot; and &quot;The Third of May 1808&quot;. Other works from his mid-period include the &quot;Caprichos&quot; and &quot;Los Disparates&quot; etching series, and a wide variety of paintings concerned with insanity, mental asylums, witches, fantastical creatures and religious and political corruption, all of which suggest that he feared for both his country&#x27;s fate and his own mental and physical health.

His late period culminates with the &quot;Black Paintings&quot; of 1819–1823, applied on oil on the plaster walls of his house the Quinta del Sordo (&quot;House of the Deaf Man&quot;) where, disillusioned by political and social developments in Spain, he lived in near isolation. Goya eventually abandoned Spain in 1824 to retire to the French city of Bordeaux, accompanied by his much younger maid and companion, Leocadia Weiss, who may have been his lover. There he completed his &quot;La Tauromaquia&quot; series and a number of other works. Following a stroke that left him paralyzed on his right side, Goya died and was buried on 16 April 1828 aged 82.

==Early years (1746–1771)==

Francisco de Goya was born in Fuendetodos, Aragón, Spain, on 30 March 1746 to José Benito de Goya y Franque and Gracia de Lucientes y Salvador. The family had moved that year from the city of Zaragoza, but there is no record of why; likely, José was commissioned to work there. They were lower middle-class. José was the son of a notary and of Basque origin, his ancestors being from Zerain, earning his living as a gilder, specialising in religious and decorative craftwork. He oversaw the gilding and most of the ornamentation during the rebuilding of the Basilica of Our Lady of the Pillar (&quot;Santa Maria del Pilar&quot;), the principal cathedral of Zaragoza. Francisco was their fourth child, following his sister Rita (b. 1737), brother Tomás (b. 1739) (who was to follow in his father&#x27;s trade) and second sister Jacinta (b. 1743). There were two younger sons, Mariano (b. 1750) and Camilo (b. 1753).

His mother&#x27;s family had pretensions of nobility and the house, a modest brick cottage, was owned by her family and, perhaps fancifully, bore their crest. About 1749 José and Gracia bought a home in Zaragoza and were able to return to live in the city. Although there are no surviving records, it is thought that Goya may have attended the Escuelas Pías de San Antón, which offered free schooling. His education seems to have been adequate but not enlightening; he had reading, writing and numeracy, and some knowledge of the classics. According to Robert Hughes the artist &quot;seems to have taken no more interest than a carpenter in philosophical or theological matters, and his views on painting ... were very down to earth: Goya was no theoretician.&quot; At school he formed a close and lifelong friendship with fellow pupil Martín Zapater; the 131 letters Goya wrote to him from 1775 until Zapater&#x27;s death in 1803 give valuable insight into Goya&#x27;s early years at the court in Madrid.

==Visit to Italy==
At age 14 Goya studied under the painter José Luzán, where he copied stamps for 4 years until he decided to work on his own, as he wrote later on &quot;paint from my invention&quot;. He moved to Madrid to study with Anton Raphael Mengs, a popular painter with Spanish royalty. He clashed with his master, and his examinations were unsatisfactory. Goya submitted entries for the Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando in 1763 and 1766 but was denied entrance into the academia.
Rome was then the cultural capital of Europe and held all the prototypes of classical antiquity, while Spain lacked a coherent artistic direction, with all of its significant visual achievements in the past. Having failed to earn a scholarship, Goya relocated at his own expense to Rome in the old tradition of European artists stretching back at least to Albrecht Dürer. He was an unknown at the time and so the records are scant and uncertain. Early biographers have him travelling to Rome with a gang of bullfighters, where he worked as a street acrobat, or for a Russian diplomat, or fell in love with a beautiful young nun whom he plotted to abduct from her convent. It is possible that Goya completed two surviving mythological paintings during the visit, a &quot;Sacrifice to Vesta&quot; and a &quot;Sacrifice to Pan&quot;, both dated 1771.

In 1771 he won second prize in a painting competition organized by the City of Parma. That year he returned to Zaragoza and painted elements of the cupolas of the Basilica of the Pillar (including &quot;Adoration of the Name of God&quot;), a cycle of frescoes for the monastic church of the Charterhouse of Aula Dei, and the frescoes of the Sobradiel Palace. He studied with the Aragonese artist Francisco Bayeu y Subías and his painting began to show signs of the delicate tonalities for which he became famous. He befriended Francisco Bayeu and married his sister Josefa (he nicknamed her &quot;Pepa&quot;) on 25 July 1773. Their first child, Antonio Juan Ramon Carlos, was born on 29 August 1774. Of their seven children only one, a son named Javier, survived into adulthood.

== Madrid (1775–1789) ==

Francisco Bayeu (Josefa Bayeu&#x27;s brother), 1765 membership of the Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando, and directorship of the tapestry works from 1777 helped Goya earn a commission for a series of tapestry cartoons for the Royal Tapestry Factory. Over five years he designed some 42 patterns, many of which were used to decorate and insulate the stone walls of El Escorial and the Palacio Real del Pardo, the residences of the Spanish monarchs. While designing tapestries was neither prestigious nor well paid, his cartoons are mostly popular in a rococo style, and Goya used them to bring himself to wider attention.

The cartoons were not his only royal commissions and were accompanied by a series of engravings, mostly copies after old masters such as Marcantonio Raimondi and Velázquez. Goya had a complicated relationship with the latter artist; while many of his contemporaries saw folly in Goya&#x27;s attempts to copy and emulate him, he had access to a wide range of the long-dead painter&#x27;s works that had been contained in the royal collection. Nonetheless, etching was a medium that the young artist was to master, a medium that was to reveal both the true depths of his imagination and his political beliefs. His etching of &quot;The Garrotted Man&quot; (&quot;El agarrotado&quot;) was the largest work he had produced to date, and an obvious foreboding of his later &quot;Disasters of War&quot; series.
Goya was beset by illness, and his condition was used against him by his rivals, who looked jealously upon any artist seen to be rising in stature. Some of the larger cartoons, such as &quot;The Wedding&quot;, were more than 8 by 10 feet, and had proved a drain on his physical strength. Ever resourceful, Goya turned this misfortune around, claiming that his illness had allowed him the insight to produce works that were more personal and informal. However, he found the format limiting, as it did not allow him to capture complex color shifts or texture, and was unsuited to the impasto and glazing techniques he was by then applying to his painted works. The tapestries seem as comments on human types, fashion and fads.

Other works from the period include a canvas for the altar of the Church of San Francisco El Grande in Madrid, which led to his appointment as a member of the Royal Academy of Fine Art.

==Court painter==
In 1783, the Count of Floridablanca, favorite of King Charles III, commissioned Goya to paint his portrait. He became friends with the King&#x27;s half-brother Luis, and spent two summers working on portraits of both the Infante and his family. During the 1780s, his circle of patrons grew to include the Duke and Duchess of Osuna, the King and other notable people of the kingdom whom he painted. In 1786, Goya was given a salaried position as a painter to Charles III.

Goya was appointed court painter to Charles IV in 1789. The following year he became First Court Painter, with a salary of 50,000 reales and an allowance of 500 ducats for a coach. He painted portraits of the king and the queen, and the Spanish Prime Minister Manuel de Godoy and many other nobles. These portraits are notable for their disinclination to flatter; his &quot;Charles IV of Spain and His Family&quot; is an especially brutal assessment of a royal family. Modern interpreters view the portrait as satirical; it is thought to reveal the corruption behind the rule of Charles IV. Under his reign his wife Louisa was thought to have had the real power, and thus Goya placed her at the center of the group portrait. From the back left of the painting one can see the artist himself looking out at the viewer, and the painting behind the family depicts Lot and his daughters, thus once again echoing the underlying message of corruption and decay.

Goya earned commissions from the highest ranks of the Spanish nobility, including Pedro Téllez-Girón, 9th Duke of Osuna and his wife María Josefa Pimentel, 12th Countess-Duchess of Benavente, José Álvarez de Toledo, Duke of Alba and his wife María del Pilar de Silva, and María Ana de Pontejos y Sandoval, Marchioness of Pontejos. In 1801 he painted Godoy in a commission to commemorate the victory in the brief War of the Oranges against Portugal. The two were friends, even if Goya&#x27;s 1801 portrait is usually seen as satire. Yet even after Godoy&#x27;s fall from grace the politician referred to the artist in warm terms. Godoy saw himself as instrumental in the publication of the Caprichos and is widely believed to have commissioned &quot;La maja desnuda&quot;.

==Middle period (1793–1799)==
&quot;La Maja Desnuda&quot; (&quot;La maja desnuda&quot;) has been described as &quot;the first totally profane life-size female nude in Western art&quot; without pretense to allegorical or mythological meaning. The identity of the &quot;Majas&quot; is uncertain. The most popularly cited models are the Duchess of Alba, with whom Goya was sometimes thought to have had an affair, and Pepita Tudó, mistress of Manuel de Godoy. Neither theory has been verified, and it remains as likely that the paintings represent an idealized composite. The paintings were never publicly exhibited during Goya&#x27;s lifetime and were owned by Godoy. In 1808 all Godoy&#x27;s property was seized by Ferdinand VII after his fall from power and exile, and in 1813 the Inquisition confiscated both works as &#x27;obscene&#x27;, returning them in 1836 to the Academy of Fine Arts of San Fernando.

In 1798 he painted luminous and airy scenes for the pendentives and cupola of the Real Ermita (Chapel) of San Antonio de la Florida in Madrid. His depiction of a miracle of Saint Anthony of Padua is devoid of the customary angels and instead treats the miracle as if it were a theatrical event performed by ordinary people.

At some time between late 1792 and early 1793, an undiagnosed illness left Goya deaf. He became withdrawn and introspective while the direction and tone of his work changed. He began the series of aquatinted etchings, published in 1799 as the &quot;Caprichos&quot;—completed in parallel with the more official commissions of portraits and religious paintings. In 1799 Goya published 80 &quot;Caprichos&quot; prints depicting what he described as &quot;the innumerable foibles and follies to be found in any civilized society, and from the common prejudices and deceitful practices which custom, ignorance, or self-interest have made usual&quot;. The visions in these prints are partly explained by the caption &quot;The sleep of reason produces monsters&quot;. Yet these are not solely bleak; they demonstrate the artist&#x27;s sharp satirical wit, as in &quot;Capricho&quot; number 52, &quot;What a Tailor Can Do!&quot;

While convalescing between 1793 and 1794, Goya completed a set of eleven small pictures painted on tin that marked a significant change in the tone and subject matter of his art, and drew from the dark and dramatic realms of fantasy nightmare. &quot;Yard with Lunatics&quot; is a vision of loneliness, fear and social alienation. The condemnation of brutality towards prisoners (whether criminal or insane) is a subject that Goya assayed in later works that focused on the degradation of the human figure. It was one of the first of Goya&#x27;s mid-1790s cabinet paintings, in which his earlier search for ideal beauty gave way to an examination of the relationship between naturalism and fantasy that would preoccupy him for the rest of his career. He was undergoing a nervous breakdown and entering prolonged physical illness, and admitted that the series was created to reflect his own self-doubt, anxiety and fear that he was losing his mind. Goya wrote that the works served &quot;to occupy my imagination, tormented as it is by contemplation of my sufferings.&quot; The series, he said, consisted of pictures which &quot;normally find no place in commissioned works&quot;.

Goya&#x27;s physical and mental breakdown seems to have happened a few weeks after the French declaration of war on Spain. A contemporary reported, &quot;The noises in his head and deafness aren&#x27;t improving, yet his vision is much better and he is back in control of his balance.&quot; These symptoms may indicate a prolonged viral encephalitis, or possibly a series of miniature strokes resulting from high blood pressure and which affected the hearing and balance centres of the brain. Symptoms of tinnitus, episodes of imbalance and progressive deafness are typical of Ménière&#x27;s disease. It is possible that Goya had cumulative lead poisoning, as he used massive amounts of lead white—which he ground himself—in his paintings, both as a canvas primer and as a primary colour.

Other postmortem diagnostic assessments include Susac&#x27;s syndrome or may point toward paranoid dementia, possibly due to brain trauma, as evidenced by marked changes in his work after his recovery, culminating in the &quot;black&quot; paintings. Art historians have noted Goya&#x27;s singular ability to express his personal demons as horrific and fantastic imagery that speaks universally, and allows his audience to find its own catharsis in the images.

==Peninsular War (1808–1814)==
The French army invaded Spain in 1808, leading to the Peninsular War of 1808–1814. The extent of Goya&#x27;s involvement with the court of the &quot;intruder king&quot;, Joseph I, the brother of Napoleon Bonaparte, is not known; he painted works for French patrons and sympathisers, but kept neutral during the fighting. After the restoration of the Spanish King Ferdinand VII in 1814, Goya denied any involvement with the French. By the time of his wife Josefa&#x27;s death in 1812, he was painting &quot;The Second of May 1808&quot; and &quot;The Third of May 1808&quot;, and preparing the series of etchings later known as &quot;The Disasters of War&quot; (&quot;Los desastres de la guerra&quot;). Ferdinand VII returned to Spain in 1814 but relations with Goya were not cordial. The artist completed portraits of the king for a variety of ministries, but not for the king himself.

Although Goya did not make his intention known when creating &quot;The Disasters of War&quot;, art historians view them as a visual protest against the violence of the 1808 Dos de Mayo Uprising, the subsequent Peninsular War and the move against liberalism in the aftermath of the restoration of the Bourbon monarchy in 1814. The scenes are singularly disturbing, sometimes macabre in their depiction of battlefield horror, and represent an outraged conscience in the face of death and destruction. They were not published until 1863, 35 years after his death. It is likely that only then was it considered politically safe to distribute a sequence of artworks criticising both the French and restored Bourbons.

The first 47 plates in the series focus on incidents from the war and show the consequences of the conflict on individual soldiers and civilians. The middle series (plates 48 to 64) record the effects of the famine that hit Madrid in 1811–12, before the city was liberated from the French. The final 17 reflect the bitter disappointment of liberals when the restored Bourbon monarchy, encouraged by the Catholic hierarchy, rejected the Spanish Constitution of 1812 and opposed both state and religious reform. Since their first publication, Goya&#x27;s scenes of atrocities, starvation, degradation and humiliation have been described as the &quot;prodigious flowering of rage&quot;.

His works from 1814 to 1819 are mostly commissioned portraits, but also include the altarpiece of Santa Justa and Santa Rufina for the Cathedral of Seville, the print series of &quot;La Tauromaquia&quot; depicting scenes from bullfighting, and probably the etchings of &quot;Los Disparates&quot;.

==Quinta del Sordo and Black Paintings (1819–1822)==
Records of Goya&#x27;s later life are relatively scant, and ever politically aware, he suppressed a number of his works from this period, working instead in private. He was tormented by a dread of old age and fear of madness. Goya had been a successful and royally placed artist, but withdrew from public life during his final years. From the late 1810s he lived in near-solitude outside Madrid in a farmhouse converted into a studio. The house had become known as &quot;La Quinta del Sordo&quot; (The House of the Deaf Man), after the nearest farmhouse that had coincidentally also belonged to a deaf man.

Art historians assume Goya felt alienated from the social and political trends that followed the 1814 restoration of the Bourbon monarchy, and that he viewed these developments as reactionary means of social control. In his unpublished art he seems to have railed against what he saw as a tactical retreat into Medievalism. It is thought that he had hoped for political and religious reform, but like many liberals became disillusioned when the restored Bourbon monarchy and Catholic hierarchy rejected the Spanish Constitution of 1812.

At the age of 75, alone and in mental and physical despair, he completed the work of his 14 &quot;Black Paintings&quot;, all of which were executed in oil directly onto the plaster walls of his house. Goya did not intend for the paintings to be exhibited, did not write of them, and likely never spoke of them. Around 1874, 50 years after his death, they were taken down and transferred to a canvas support by owner Baron Frédéric Émile d&#x27;Erlanger. Many of the works were significantly altered during the restoration, and in the words of Arthur Lubow what remain are &quot;at best a crude facsimile of what Goya painted.&quot; The effects of time on the murals, coupled with the inevitable damage caused by the delicate operation of mounting the crumbling plaster on canvas, meant that most of the murals suffered extensive damage and loss of paint. Today, they are on permanent display at the , Madrid.

==Bordeaux (October 1824 – 1828)==
Leocadia Weiss (née Zorrilla, 1790–1856), the artist&#x27;s maid, younger by 35 years, and a distant relative, lived with and cared for Goya after Bayeu&#x27;s death. She stayed with him in his Quinta del Sordo villa until 1824 with her daughter Rosario. Leocadia was probably similar in features to Goya&#x27;s first wife Josefa Bayeu, to the point that one of his well-known portraits bears the cautious title of &quot;Josefa Bayeu (or Leocadia Weiss)&quot;.

Not much is known about her beyond her fiery temperament. She was likely related to the Goicoechea family, a wealthy dynasty into which the artist&#x27;s son, Javier, had married. It is known that Leocadia had an unhappy marriage with a jeweler, Isidore Weiss, but was separated from him since 1811, after he had accused her of &quot;illicit conduct&quot;. She had two children before that time, and bore a third, Rosario, in 1814 when she was 26. Isidore was not the father, and it has often been speculated—although with little firm evidence—that the child belonged to Goya. There has been much speculation that Goya and Weiss were romantically linked; however, it is more likely the affection between them was sentimental.

Goya died on 16 April 1828. Leocadia was left nothing in Goya&#x27;s will; mistresses were often omitted in such circumstances, but it is also likely that he did not want to dwell on his mortality by thinking about or revising his will. She wrote to a number of Goya&#x27;s friends to complain of her exclusion but many of her friends were Goya&#x27;s also and by then were old men or had died, and did not reply. Largely destitute, she moved into rented accommodation, later passing on her copy of the &quot;Caprichos&quot; for free.

Goya&#x27;s body was later re-interred in the Real Ermita de San Antonio de la Florida in Madrid. Goya&#x27;s skull was missing, a detail the Spanish consul immediately communicated to his superiors in Madrid, who wired back, &quot;Send Goya, with or without head.&quot;

==Goya&#x27;s influence on modern and contemporary artists and writers==

Goya is often referred to as the last of the Old Masters and the first of the moderns. Among the 20th-century painters influenced by Goya are the Spanish masters Pablo Picasso and Salvador Dalí who drew influence from &quot;Los caprichos&quot; and the &quot;Black Paintings&quot; of Goya. In the 21st century, American postmodern painters such as Michael Zansky and Bradley Rubenstein draw inspiration from &quot;The Dream of Reason Produces Monsters&quot; (1796–98) and Goya&#x27;s &quot;Black Paintings&quot;. Zanksy&#x27;s &quot;Giants and Dwarf Series&quot; (1990–2002) of large-scale paintings and wood carvings use imagery from Goya.

Goya&#x27;s influence has extended beyond the visual arts:

* The Spanish composer Enrique Granados wrote a suite for solo piano in 1911 based on Goya&#x27;s paintings called &quot;Goyescas&quot;, and later wrote an opera of the same name based on the suite.
*Spanish author Fernando Arrabal&#x27;s novel &quot;The Burial of the Sardine&quot; was inspired by Goya&#x27;s painting.
* Russian poet Andrei Voznesensky&#x27;s &quot;I Am Goya&quot; was inspired by Goya&#x27;s anti-war paintings.
* The video game Impasto was based on the works of Goya.
In 2024, an extensive exhibition of Goya&#x27;s etchings was held at the Norton Simon Museum in Southern California.

<text>Frequentist probability or frequentism is an interpretation of probability; it defines an event&#x27;s probability as the limit of its relative frequency in infinitely many trials (the &quot;long-run probability&quot;).
Probabilities can be found (in principle) by a repeatable objective process (and are thus ideally devoid of opinion). The continued use of frequentist methods in scientific inference, however, has been called into question.

The development of the frequentist account was motivated by the problems and paradoxes of the previously dominant viewpoint, the classical interpretation. In the classical interpretation, probability was defined in terms of the principle of indifference, based on the natural symmetry of a problem, so, for example, the probabilities of dice games arise from the natural symmetric 6-sidedness of the cube. This classical interpretation stumbled at any statistical problem that has no natural symmetry for reasoning.

==Definition==
In the frequentist interpretation, probabilities are discussed only when dealing with well-defined random experiments. The set of all possible outcomes of a random experiment is called the sample space of the experiment. An event is defined as a particular subset of the sample space to be considered. For any given event, only one of two possibilities may hold: It occurs or it does not. The relative frequency of occurrence of an event, observed in a number of repetitions of the experiment, is a measure of the probability of that event. This is the core conception of probability in the frequentist interpretation.

A claim of the frequentist approach is that, as the number of trials increases, the change in the relative frequency will diminish. Hence, one can view a probability as the &quot;limiting value&quot; of the corresponding relative frequencies.

== Scope ==
The frequentist interpretation is a philosophical approach to the definition and use of probabilities; it is one of several such approaches. It does not claim to capture all connotations of the concept &#x27;probable&#x27; in colloquial speech of natural languages.

As an interpretation, it is not in conflict with the mathematical axiomatization of probability theory; rather, it provides guidance for how to apply mathematical probability theory to real-world situations. It offers distinct guidance in the construction and design of practical experiments, especially when contrasted with the Bayesian interpretation. As to whether this guidance is useful, or is apt to mis-interpretation, has been a source of controversy. Particularly when the frequency interpretation of probability is mistakenly assumed to be the only possible basis for frequentist inference. So, for example, a list of mis-interpretations of the meaning of p-values accompanies the article on -values; controversies are detailed in the article on statistical hypothesis testing. The Jeffreys–Lindley paradox shows how different interpretations, applied to the same data set, can lead to different conclusions about the &#x27;statistical significance&#x27; of a result.

As Feller notes:
== History ==

The frequentist view may have been foreshadowed by Aristotle, in &quot;Rhetoric&quot;,
when he wrote:
Poisson (1837) clearly distinguished between objective and subjective probabilities.
Soon thereafter a flurry of nearly simultaneous publications by Mill, Ellis (1843)
and Ellis (1854), Cournot (1843),
and Fries introduced the frequentist view. Venn (1866, 1876, 1888) provided a thorough exposition two decades later.
These were further supported by the publications of Boole and Bertrand. By the end of the 19th century the frequentist interpretation was well established and perhaps dominant in the sciences. The following generation established the tools of classical inferential statistics (significance testing, hypothesis testing and confidence intervals) all based on frequentist probability.

Alternatively,
Bernoulli
understood the concept of frequentist probability and published a critical proof (the weak law of large numbers) posthumously (Bernoulli, 1713).
He is also credited with some appreciation for subjective probability (prior to and without Bayes theorem).
Gauss and Laplace used frequentist (and other) probability in derivations of the least squares method a century later, a generation before Poisson.
Laplace considered the probabilities of testimonies, tables of mortality, judgments of tribunals, etc. which are unlikely candidates for classical probability. In this view, Poisson&#x27;s contribution was his sharp criticism of the alternative &quot;inverse&quot; (subjective, Bayesian) probability interpretation. Any criticism by Gauss or Laplace was muted and implicit. (However, note that their later derivations of least squares did not use inverse probability.)

Major contributors to &quot;classical&quot; statistics in the early 20th century included Fisher, Neyman, and Pearson. Fisher contributed to most of statistics and made significance testing the core of experimental science, although he was critical of the frequentist concept of &quot;repeated sampling from the same population&quot;;
Neyman formulated confidence intervals and contributed heavily to sampling theory; Neyman and Pearson paired in the creation of hypothesis testing. All valued objectivity, so the best interpretation of probability available to them was frequentist.

All were suspicious of &quot;inverse probability&quot; (the available alternative) with prior probabilities chosen by using the principle of indifference. Fisher said, &quot;... the theory of inverse probability is founded upon an error, [referring to Bayes theorem] and must be wholly rejected.&quot;
While Neyman was a pure frequentist,
Fisher&#x27;s views of probability were unique: Both Fisher and Neyman had nuanced view of probability. von Mises offered a combination of mathematical and philosophical support for frequentism in the era.

==Etymology==
According to the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot;, the term &quot;frequentist&quot; was first used by M.G. Kendall in 1949, to contrast with Bayesians, whom he called &quot;non-frequentists&quot;.
Kendall observed
:3. ... we may broadly distinguish two main attitudes. One takes probability as &#x27;a degree of rational belief&#x27;, or some similar idea...the second defines probability in terms of frequencies of occurrence of events, or by relative proportions in &#x27;populations&#x27; or &#x27;collectives&#x27;;
:12. It might be thought that the differences between the frequentists and the non-frequentists (if I may call them such) are largely due to the differences of the domains which they purport to cover.
:&quot;I assert that this is not so&quot; ... The essential distinction between the frequentists and the non-frequentists is, I think, that the former, in an effort to avoid anything savouring of matters of opinion, seek to define probability in terms of the objective properties of a population, real or hypothetical, whereas the latter do not. [emphasis in original]

&quot;The Frequency Theory of Probability&quot; was used a generation earlier as a chapter title in Keynes (1921).

The historical sequence:
# Probability concepts were introduced and much of the mathematics of probability derived (prior to the 20th century)
# classical statistical inference methods were developed
# the mathematical foundations of probability were solidified and current terminology was introduced (all in the 20th century).
The primary historical sources in probability and statistics did not use the current terminology of &quot;classical&quot;, &quot;subjective&quot; (Bayesian), and &quot;frequentist&quot; probability.

==Alternative views==

Probability theory is a branch of mathematics. While its roots reach centuries into the past, it reached maturity with the axioms of Andrey Kolmogorov in 1933. The theory focuses on the valid operations on probability values rather than on the initial assignment of values; the mathematics is largely independent of any interpretation of probability.

Applications and interpretations of probability are considered by philosophy, the sciences and statistics. All are interested in the extraction of knowledge from observations—inductive reasoning. There are a variety of competing interpretations;
All have problems. The frequentist interpretation does resolve difficulties with the classical interpretation, such as any problem where the natural symmetry of outcomes is not known. It does not address other issues, such as the dutch book.

* Classical probability assigns probabilities based on physical idealized symmetry (dice, coins, cards). The classical definition is at risk of circularity: Probabilities are defined by assuming equality of probabilities. In the absence of symmetry the utility of the definition is limited.

* Subjective (Bayesian) probability (a family of competing interpretations) considers degrees of belief: All practical &quot;subjective&quot; probability interpretations are so constrained to rationality as to avoid most subjectivity. Real subjectivity is repellent to some definitions of science which strive for results independent of the observer and analyst. Other applications of Bayesianism in science (e.g. logical Bayesianism) embrace the inherent subjectivity of many scientific studies and objects and use Bayesian reasoning to place boundaries and context on the influence of subjectivities on all analysis. The historical roots of this concept extended to such non-numeric applications as legal evidence.

* Propensity probability views probability as a causative phenomenon rather than a purely descriptive or subjective one.
