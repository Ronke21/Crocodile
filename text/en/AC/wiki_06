<text>The film industry in Germany can be traced back to the late 19th century. German cinema made major technical and artistic contributions to early film, broadcasting and television technology. Babelsberg became a household synonym for the early 20th century film industry in Europe, similar to Hollywood later. Early German and German-speaking filmmakers and actors heavily contributed to early Hollywood.

Germany witnessed major changes to its identity during the 20th and 21st century. Those changes determined the periodisation of national cinema into a succession of distinct eras and movements.

==History==

===1895–1918 German Empire===

The history of cinema in Germany can be traced back to the years of the medium&#x27;s birth. Ottomar Anschütz held the first showing of life sized pictures in motion on 25 November 1894 at the Postfuhramt in Berlin. On 1 November 1895, Max Skladanowsky and his brother Emil demonstrated their self-invented film projector, the Bioscop, at the Wintergarten music hall in Berlin. A 15-minute series of eight short films were shown – the first screening of films to a paying audience. This performance pre-dated the first paying public display of the Lumière brothers&#x27; Cinematographe in Paris on 28 December of the same year, a performance that Max Skladanowsky attended and at which he was able to ascertain that the Cinematographe was technically superior to his Bioscop. Other German film pioneers included the Berliners Oskar Messter and Max Gliewe, two of several individuals who independently in 1896 first used a Geneva drive (which allows the film to be advanced intermittently one frame at a time) in a projector, and the cinematographer Guido Seeber.

In its earliest days, the cinematograph was perceived as an attraction for upper class audiences, but the novelty of moving pictures did not last long. Soon, trivial short films were being shown as fairground attractions aimed at the working class and lower-middle class. The booths in which these films were shown were known in Germany somewhat disparagingly as &quot;Kintopps&quot;. Film-makers with an artistic bent attempted to counter this view of cinema with longer films based on literary models, and the first German &quot;artistic&quot; films began to be produced from around 1910, an example being the Edgar Allan Poe adaptation &quot;The Student of Prague&quot; (1913) which was co-directed by Paul Wegener and Stellan Rye, photographed by Guido Seeber and starring actors from Max Reinhardt&#x27;s company.

Early film theorists in Germany began to write about the significance of &quot;Schaulust&quot;, or &quot;visual pleasure&quot;, for the audience, including the Dada movement writer Walter Serner: &quot;If one looks to where cinema receives its ultimate power, into these strangely flickering eyes that point far back into human history, suddenly it stands there in all its massiveness: visual pleasure.&quot; Visually striking sets and makeup were key to the style of the expressionist films that were produced shortly after the First World War.

Cinemas themselves began to be established landmarks in the years immediately before World War I. Before this, German filmmakers would tour with their works, travelling from fairground to fairground. The earliest ongoing cinemas were set up in cafes and pubs by owners who saw a way of attracting more customers. The storefront cinema was called a &quot;Kientopp&quot;, and this is where films were viewed for the most part before the First World War broke out. The first standalone, dedicated cinema in Germany was opened in Mannheim in 1906, and by 1910, there were over 1000 cinemas operating in Germany. Henny Porten and Asta Nielsen (the latter originally from Denmark) were the first major film stars in Germany.

Prior to 1914, however, many foreign films were imported. In the era of the silent film there were no language boundaries and Danish and Italian films were particularly popular in Germany. The public&#x27;s desire to see more films with particular actors led to the development in Germany, as elsewhere, of the phenomenon of the film star; the actress Henny Porten was one of the earliest German stars. Public desire to see popular film stories being continued encouraged the production of film serials, especially in the genre of mystery films, which is where the director Fritz Lang began his illustrious career.

The outbreak of World War I and the subsequent boycott of, for example, French films left a noticeable gap in the market. By 1916, there already existed some 2000 fixed venues for movie performances and initially film screenings were supplemented or even replaced by variety turns. In 1917 a process of concentration and partial nationalisation of the German film industry began with the founding of Universum Film AG (UFA), which was partly a reaction to the very effective use that the Allied Powers had found for the new medium for the purpose of propaganda. Under the aegis of the military, so-called &quot;Vaterland&quot; films were produced, which equalled the Allies&#x27; films in the matter of propaganda and disparagement of the enemy. Audiences however did not care to swallow the patriotic medicine without the accompanying sugar of the light-entertainment films which, consequently, Ufa also promoted. The German film industry soon became the largest in Europe.

===1918–1933 Weimar Republic===

The German film industry, which was protected during the war by the ban on foreign films import, became exposed at the end of the war to the international film industry while having to face an embargo, this time on its own films. Many countries banned the import of German films and audiences themselves were resisting anything that was &quot;German&quot;. But the ban imposed on German films involved commercial considerations as well – as an American president of one of the film companies was quoted, &quot;an influx of such films in the United States would throw thousands of our own... out of work, because it would be absolutely impossible for the American producers to compete with the German producers&quot;. At home, the German film industry confronted an unstable economic situation and the devaluation of the currency made it difficult for the smaller production companies to function. Film industry financing was a fragile business and expensive productions occasionally led to bankruptcy. In 1925 UFA itself was forced to go into a disadvantageous partnership called Parufamet with the American studios Paramount and MGM, before being taken over by the nationalist industrialist and newspaper owner Alfred Hugenberg in 1927.

Nevertheless, the German film industry enjoyed an unprecedented development – during the 14 years which comprise the Weimar period, an average of 250 film were being produced each year, a total of 3,500 full-feature films. Apart from UFA, about 230 film companies were active in Berlin alone. This industry was attracting producers and directors from all over Europe. The fact that the films were silent and language was not a factor, enabled even foreign actors, like the Danish film star Asta Nielsen or the American Louise Brooks, to be hired even for leading roles. This period can also be noted for new technological developments in film making and experimentation in set design and lighting, led by UFA. Babelsberg Studio, which was incorporated into UFA, expanded massively and gave the German film industry a highly developed infrastructure. Babelsberg remained the centre of German filmmaking for many years, became the largest film studio in Europe and produced most of the films in this &quot;golden era&quot; of German cinema. In essence it was &quot;the German equivalent to Hollywood&quot;.

Films about an exaggerated version of Japanese culture that included &quot;geishas, samurai, and Shinto shrines&quot; were popular in Germany during this era.

Due to the unstable economic condition and in an attempt to deal with modest production budgets, filmmakers were trying to reach the largest audience possible and in that, to maximize their revenues. This led to films being made in a vast array of genres and styles.

One of the main film genres associated with the Weimar Republic cinema is German Expressionism which was inspired by the expressionist movement in art. Expressionist movies relied heavily on symbolism and artistic imagery rather than stark realism to tell their stories. Given the grim mood in post-World War I, it was not surprising that these films focused heavily on crime and horror. The film usually credited with sparking the popularity of expressionism is Robert Wiene&#x27;s &quot;The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari&quot; (1920), produced by Erich Pommer. The film tells the story of a demented hypnotist who is using a sleepwalker to perform a series of murders. The film featured a dark and twisted visual style – the set was unrealistic with geometric images painted on the floor and shapes in light and shadow cast on walls, the acting was exaggerated and the costumes bizarre. These stylistic elements became trademarks of this cinematic movement. Other notable works of Expressionism are Friedrich Wilhelm Murnau&#x27;s &quot;Nosferatu&quot; (1922), a classic period-piece horror film that remains the first feature-length film adaptation of &quot;Bram Stoker&#x27;s Dracula&quot;, Carl Boese and Paul Wegener&#x27;s &quot;The Golem: How He Came Into the World&quot; (1920), a Gothic retelling of the Jewish folktale, and &quot;Metropolis&quot; (1927), a legendary science-fiction epic directed by Fritz Lang. The Expressionist movement began to wane during the mid-1920s, but perhaps the fact that its main creators moved to Hollywood, California, allowed this style to remain influential in world cinema for years to come, particularly in American horror films and film noir and in the works of European directors such as Jean Cocteau and Ingmar Bergman.

Despite its significance, expressionist cinema was not the dominant genre of this era. Many other genres such as period dramas, melodramas, romantic comedies, and films of social and political nature, were much more prevalent and definitely more popular.

The &quot;master&quot; of period-dramas was undoubtedly Ernst Lubitsch. His most notable films of this genre were &quot;Madame DuBarry&quot; (1919) which portrayed the French Revolution through the eyes of the King of France&#x27;s mistress, and the film &quot;Anna Boleyn&quot; (1920) on the tragic end of King Henry VIII&#x27;s second wife. In these films, Lubitsch presented prominent historic personalities who are caught up by their weaknesses and petty urges and thus, ironically, become responsible for huge historical events. Despite modest budgets, his films included extravagant scenes which were meant to appeal to a wide audience and insure a wide international distribution.

As the genre of expressionism began to diminish, the genre of the New Objectivity (die neue Sachlichkeit) began to take its place. It was influenced by new issues which occupied the public in those years, as the rampant inflation caused deterioration in the economic status of the middle class. These films, often called &quot;street films&quot; or &quot;asphalt films&quot;, tried to reflect reality in all its complexity and ugliness. They focused on objects surrounding the characters and cynically symbolized the despair felt by the German people, whose lives were shattered after the war. The most prominent film maker who is associated with this genre is Georg Wilhelm Pabst in his films such as: &quot;Joyless Street&quot; (1925), &quot;Pandora&#x27;s Box&quot; (1929), and &quot;The Loves of Jeanne Ney&quot; (1927). Pabst is also credited with innovations in film editing, such as reversing the angle of the camera or cutting between two camera angles, which enhanced film continuity and later became standards of the industry.

Pabst is also identified with another genre which branched from the New Objectivity – that of social and political films. These filmmakers dared to confront sensitive and controversial social issues which engaged the public in those days; such as anti-Semitism, prostitution and homosexuality. To a large extent, Weimar cinema was playing a vibrant and important role by leading public debate on those issues. Pabst, in his film &quot;Diary of a Lost Girl&quot; (1929), tells the story of a young woman who has a child out of wedlock, is thrown out into the street by her family and has to resort to prostitution to survive. As early as 1919, Richard Oswald&#x27;s film &quot;Different from the Others&quot; portrayed a man torn between his homosexual tendencies and the moral and social conventions. It is considered to be the first German film to deal with homosexuality and some researchers even believe it to be the first in the world to examine this issue explicitly. That same year, the film &quot;Ritual Murder&quot; (1919) by Jewish film producer Max Nivelli came to the screen. This film was the first to make the German public aware of the consequences of anti-Semitism and xenophobia. It portrayed a &quot;pogrom&quot; which is carried out against the Jewish inhabitants of a village in Tsarist Russia. In the background, a love story also evolves between a young Russian student and the daughter of the leader of the Jewish community, something that was considered a taboo at the time. Later on, in an attempt to reflect the rapidly growing anti-Semitic atmosphere, Oswald confronted the same issue with his film &quot;Dreyfus&quot; (1930), which portrayed the 1894 political scandal of the &quot;Dreyfus affair&quot;, which until today remains one of the most striking examples of miscarriage of justice and blatant anti-Semitism.
The polarised politics of the Weimar period were also reflected in some of its films. A series of patriotic films about Prussian history, starring Otto Gebühr as Frederick the Great were produced throughout the 1920s and were popular with the nationalist right-wing, who strongly criticised the &quot;asphalt&quot; films&#x27; decadence. Another dark chapter of the Weimar period was reflected in Joseph Delmont&#x27;s film &quot;Humanity Unleashed&quot; (1920). The film was an adaptation of a novel by the same name, written by Max Glass and published in 1919. The novel described a dark world consumed by disease and war. The filmmakers decided to take the story to a more contemporary context by reflecting the growing fear among the German public of political radicalization. They produced what was to become the first fictional account of the events of January 1919 in Berlin, the so-called &quot;Spartacist Uprising&quot;. This film is also considered one of the anti-Bolshevik films of that era.

Another important film genre of the Weimar years was the Kammerspiel or &quot;chamber drama&quot;, which was borrowed from the theater and developed by stage director, who would later become a film producer and director himself, Max Reinhardt. This style was in many ways a reaction against the spectacle of expressionism and thus tended to revolve around ordinary people from the lower-middle-class. Films of this genre were often called &quot;instinct&quot; films because they emphasized the impulses and intimate psychology of the characters. The sets were kept to a minimum and there was abundant use of camera movements to add complexity to the rather intimate and simple spaces. Associated with this particular style is also screenwriter Carl Mayer and films such as Murnau&#x27;s &quot;Last Laugh (1924).&quot;

Nature films, a genre referred to as &quot;Bergfilm,&quot; also became popular. Most known in this category are the films by director Arnold Fanck, in which individuals were shown battling against nature in the mountains. Animators and directors of experimental films such as; Lotte Reiniger, Oskar Fischinger and Walter Ruttmann, were also very active in Germany in the 1920s. Ruttman&#x27;s experimental documentary &quot;&quot; (1927) epitomised the energy of 1920s Berlin.

The arrival of sound at the very end of the 1920s, produced a final artistic flourish of German film before the collapse of the Weimar Republic in 1933. As early as 1918, three inventors came up with the Tri-Ergon sound-on-film system and tried to introduce it to the industry between 1922 and 1926. UFA showed an interest, but possibly due to financial difficulties, never made a sound film. But in the late 1920s, sound production and distribution were starting to be adopted by the German film industry and by 1932 Germany had 3,800 cinemas equipped to play sound films. The first filmmakers who experimented with the new technology often shot the film in several versions, using several soundtracks in different languages. The film &quot;The Blue Angel&quot; (1930), directed by the Austrian Josef von Sternberg and produced by Erich Pommer, was also shot in two versions – German and English, with a different supporting cast in each version. It is considered to be Germany&#x27;s first &quot;talkie&quot; and will always be remembered as the film that made an international superstar of its lead actress Marlene Dietrich. Other notable early sound films, all from 1931, include Jutzi&#x27;s adaptation to Alfred Döblin&#x27;s novel &quot;Berlin Alexanderplatz&quot;, Pabst&#x27;s Bertolt Brecht adaptation &quot;The Threepenny Opera&quot; and Lang&#x27;s &quot;M,&quot; as well as Hochbaum&#x27;s &quot;Raid in St. Pauli&quot; (1932). Brecht was also one of the creators of the explicitly communist film &quot;Kuhle Wampe&quot; (1932), which was banned soon after its release.

In addition to developments in the industry itself, the Weimar period saw the birth of film criticism as a serious discipline whose practitioners included Rudolf Arnheim in &quot;Die Weltbühne&quot; and in &quot;Film als Kunst&quot; (1932), Béla Balázs in &quot;Der Sichtbare Mensch&quot; (1924), Siegfried Kracauer in the Frankfurter Zeitung, and Lotte H. Eisner in the &quot;Filmkurier&quot;.

===1933–1945 Nazi Germany===
The uncertain economic and political situation in Weimar Germany had already led to a number of film-makers and performers leaving the country, primarily for the United States; Ernst Lubitsch moved to Hollywood as early as 1923, the Hungarian-born Michael Curtiz in 1926. Some 1,500 directors, producers, actors and other film professionals emigrated in the years after the Nazis came to power. Among them were such key figures as the producer Erich Pommer, the studio head of Ufa, stars Marlene Dietrich and Peter Lorre, and director Fritz Lang. Lang&#x27;s exodus to America is legendary; it is said that &quot;Metropolis&quot; so greatly impressed Joseph Goebbels that he asked Lang to become the head of his propaganda film unit. Lang fled to America instead, where he had a long and prosperous career. Many up-and-coming German directors also fled to the U.S., having a major influence on American film as a result. A number of the Universal Horror films of the 1930s were directed by German emigrees, including Karl Freund, Joe May and Robert Siodmak. Directors Edgar Ulmer and Douglas Sirk and the Austrian-born screenwriter (and later director) Billy Wilder also emigrated from Nazi Germany to Hollywood success. Not all those in the film industry threatened by the Nazi regime were able to escape; the actor and director Kurt Gerron, for example, perished in a concentration camp.

Within weeks of the &quot;Machtergreifung&quot;, Alfred Hugenberg had effectively turned over Ufa to the ends of the Nazis, excluding Jews from employment in the company in March 1933, several months before the foundation in June of the &quot;Reichsfilmkammer&quot; (Reich Chamber of Film), the body of the Nazi state charged with control of the film industry, which marked the official exclusion of Jews and foreigners from employment in the German film industry. As part of the process of &quot;Gleichschaltung&quot; all film production in Germany was subordinate to the &quot;Reichsfilmkammer&quot;, which was directly responsible to Goebbel&#x27;s Propaganda ministry, and all those employed in the industry had to be members of the &quot;Reichsfachschaft Film&quot;. &quot;Non-Aryan&quot; film professionals and those whose politics or personal life were unacceptable to the Nazis were excluded from the &quot;Reichsfachschaft&quot; and thus denied employment in the industry. Some 3,000 individuals were affected by this employment ban. In addition, as journalists were also organised as a division of the Propaganda Ministry, Goebbels was able to abolish film criticism in 1936 and replace it with &quot;Filmbeobachtung&quot; (film observation); journalists could only report on the content of a film, not offer judgement on its artistic or other worth.

With the German film industry now effectively an arm of the totalitarian state, no films could be made that were not ostensibly in accord with the views of the ruling regime. However, despite the existence of anti-semitic propaganda works such as &quot;The Eternal Jew&quot; (1940)—which was a box-office flop—and the more sophisticated but equally anti-semitic &quot;Jud Süß&quot; (1940), which achieved commercial success at home and elsewhere in Europe, the majority of German films from the National Socialist period were intended principally as works of entertainment. The import of foreign films was legally restricted after 1936 and the German industry, which was effectively nationalised in 1937, had to make up for the missing foreign films (above all American productions). Entertainment also became increasingly important in the later years of World War II when the cinema provided a distraction from Allied bombing and a string of German defeats. In both 1943 and 1944 cinema admissions in Germany exceeded a billion, and the biggest box office hits of the war years were &quot;Die große Liebe&quot; (1942) and &quot;Wunschkonzert&quot; (1941), which both combine elements of the musical, wartime romance and patriotic propaganda, &quot;Frauen sind doch bessere Diplomaten&quot; (1941), a comic musical which was one of the earliest German films in colour, and &quot;Vienna Blood&quot; (1942), the adaptation of a Johann Strauß comic operetta. &quot;Titanic&quot; (1943) was another big-budget epic that arguably inspired other films about the ill-fated ocean liner. The importance of the cinema as a tool of the state, both for its propaganda value and its ability to keep the populace entertained, can be seen in the filming history of Veit Harlan&#x27;s &quot;Kolberg&quot; (1945), the most expensive film of the Nazi era, for the shooting of which tens of thousands of soldiers were diverted from their military positions to appear as extras.

Despite the emigration of many film-makers and the political restrictions, the period was not without technical and aesthetic innovations, the introduction of Agfacolor film production being a notable example. Technical and aesthetic achievement could also be turned to the specific ends of the Nazi state, most spectacularly in the work of Leni Riefenstahl. Riefenstahl&#x27;s &quot;Triumph of the Will&quot; (1935), documenting the 1934 Nuremberg Rally, and &quot;Olympia&quot; (1938), documenting the 1936 Summer Olympics, pioneered techniques of camera movement and editing that have influenced many later films. Both films, particularly &quot;Triumph of the Will&quot;, remain highly controversial, as their aesthetic merit is inseparable from their propagandising of Nazi ideals.

=== 1945–1989 East Germany ===
East German cinema initially profited from the fact that much of the country&#x27;s film infrastructure, notably the former UFA studios, lay in the Soviet occupation zone which enabled film production to get off the ground more quickly than in the Western sectors. The authorities in the Soviet Zone were keen to re-establish the film industry in their sector and an order was issued to re-open cinemas in Berlin in May 1945 within three weeks of German capitulation. The film production company DEFA was founded on 17 May 1946, and took control of the film production facilities in the Soviet Zone which had been confiscated by order of the Soviet Military Administration in Germany in October 1945. A joint-stock company on paper, the majority interest in DEFA was actually held by the Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED) which became the ruling party of the German Democratic Republic (GDR) after 1949, formally placing DEFA as the state-owned monopoly for film production in East Germany. A sister &quot;company&quot;, Progress Film, had also been established as a similar monopoly for domestic film distribution, its principal &quot;competition&quot; being Sovexportfilm, which handled distribution of Soviet films.

In total, DEFA produced some 900 feature films during its existence as well as around 800 animated films and over 3000 documentaries and short films. In 1946 DEFA produced &quot;The Murderers are Among Us&quot;, which was the first German film released after World War II and created the groundwork for the so-called Trümmerfilme, or rubble films, which were filmed amidst the rubble of structures bombed during World War II. Early on, production of East German film was limited due to strict controls imposed by the authorities which restricted the subject-matter of films to topics that directly contributed to the Communist project of the state. Excluding newsreels and educational films, only 50 films were produced between 1948 and 1953. However, in later years numerous films were produced on a variety of themes. DEFA had particular strengths in children&#x27;s films, notably fairy tale adaptations such as &quot;Drei Haselnüsse für Aschenbrödel (Three Hazelnuts for Cinderella)&quot; (1973), but it also attempted other genre works: science-fiction, for example &quot;Der schweigende Stern (The Silent Star)&quot; (1960), an adaptation of a Stanisław Lem novel, or &quot;red westerns&quot; such as &quot;The Sons of the Great Mother Bear&quot; (1966) in which, in contrast to the typical American western, the heroes tended to be Native Americans. Many of these genre films were co-productions with other Warsaw Pact countries.

Notable non-genre films produced by DEFA include Wolfgang Staudte&#x27;s adaptation of Heinrich Mann&#x27;s &quot;Der Untertan&quot; (1951); Konrad Wolf&#x27;s &quot;Der geteilte Himmel (Divided Heaven)&quot; (1964), an adaptation of Christa Wolf&#x27;s novel; Frank Beyer&#x27;s adaptation of Jurek Becker&#x27;s &quot;Jacob the Liar&quot; (1975), the only East German film to be nominated for an Oscar; &quot;The Legend of Paul and Paula&quot; (1973), directed by Heiner Carow from Ulrich Plenzdorf&#x27;s novel; and &quot;Solo Sunny&quot; (1980), again the work of Konrad Wolf.

However, film-making in the GDR was always constrained and oriented by the political situation in the country at any given time. Ernst Thälmann, the communist leader in the Weimar period, was the subject of several hagiographical films in the 1950s (&quot;Ernst Thälmann&quot;, 1954), and although East German filmmaking moved away from this overtly Stalinist approach in the 1960s, filmmakers were still subject to the changing political positions, and indeed the whims, of the SED leadership. For example, DEFA&#x27;s full slate of contemporary films from 1966 were denied distribution, among them Frank Beyer&#x27;s &quot;Traces of Stones&quot; (1966) which was pulled from distribution after three days, not because it was antipathetic to communist principles, but because it showed that such principles, which it fostered, were not put into practice at all times in East Germany. The huge box-office hit &quot;The Legend of Paul and Paula&quot; was initially threatened with a distribution ban because of its satirical elements and supposedly only allowed a release on the say-so of Party General Secretary Erich Honecker.

In the late 1970s, numerous film-makers left the GDR for the West as a result of restrictions on their work, among them director Egon Günther and actors Angelica Domröse, Eva-Maria Hagen, Katharina Thalbach, Hilmar Thate, Manfred Krug and Armin Mueller-Stahl. Many had been signatories of a 1976 petition opposing the expatriation of socially critical singer-songwriter Wolf Biermann and had had their ability to work restricted as a result.

In the final years of the GDR, the availability of television and the programming and films on television broadcasts reaching into the GDR via the uncontrollable airwaves, reduced the influence of DEFA productions, although its continuing role in producing shows for East German television channel remained. Following the Wende, DEFA had ceased production altogether, and its studios and equipment was sold off by the Treuhand in 1992, but its intellectual property rights were handed to the charitable &quot;DEFA-Stiftung&quot; (DEFA Foundation) which exploits these rights in conjunction with a series of private companies, especially the quickly privatized Progress Film GmbH, which has issued several East German films with English subtitles since the mid-1990s.

===1945–1989 West Germany===
====1945–1960 Reconstruction====

The occupation and reconstruction of Germany by the Four Powers in the period immediately after the end of World War II brought a major and long-lasting change to the economic conditions under which the industry in Germany had previously operated. The holdings of Ufa were confiscated by the Allies and, as part of the process of decartelisation, licences to produce films were shared between a range of much smaller companies. In addition, the Occupation Statute of 1949, which granted partial independence to the newly created Federal Republic of Germany, specifically forbade the imposition of import quotas to protect German film production from foreign competition, the result of lobbying by the American industry as represented by the MPAA.

Amidst the devastation of the &quot;Stunde Null&quot; year of 1945 cinema attendance was unsurprisingly down to a fraction of its wartime heights, but already by the end of the decade it had reached levels that exceeded the pre-war period. For the first time in many years, German audiences had free access to cinema from around the world and in this period the films of Charlie Chaplin remained popular, as were melodramas from the United States. Nonetheless, the share of the film market for German films in this period and into the 1950s remained relatively large, taking up some 40 percent of the total market. American films took up around 30 percent of the market despite having around twice as many films in distribution as the German industry in the same time frame.

Many of the German films of the immediate post-war period can be characterised as belonging to the genre of the &quot;Trümmerfilm&quot; (literally &quot;rubble film&quot;). These films show strong affinities with the work of Italian neorealists, not least Roberto Rossellini&#x27;s neorealist trilogy which included &quot;Germany Year Zero&quot; (1948), and are concerned primarily with day-to-day life in the devastated Germany and an initial reaction to the events of the Nazi period (the full horror of which was first experienced by many in documentary footage from liberated concentration camps). Such films include Wolfgang Staudte&#x27;s &quot;Die Mörder sind unter uns (The Murderers are among us)&quot; (1946), the first film made in post-war Germany (produced in the soviet sector), and Wolfgang Liebeneiner&#x27;s &quot;Liebe 47 (Love 47)&quot; (1949), an adaptation of Wolfgang Borchert&#x27;s play &quot;Draußen vor der Tür&quot;.

Despite the advent of a regular television service in the Federal Republic in 1952, cinema attendances continued to grow through much of the 1950s, reaching a peak of 817.5 million visits in 1956. The majority of the films of this period set out to do no more than entertain the audience and had few pretensions to artistry or active engagement with social issues. The defining genre of the period was arguably the (&quot;homeland film&quot;), in which morally simplistic tales of love and family were played out in a rural setting, often in the mountains of Bavaria, Austria or Switzerland. In their day were of little interest to more scholarly film critics, but in recent years they have been the subject of study in relation to what they say about the culture of West Germany in the years of the &quot;Wirtschaftswunder&quot;. Other film genres typical of this period were adaptations of operettas, hospital melodramas, comedies and musicals. Many films were remakes of earlier Ufa productions.

Rearmament and the founding of the &quot;Bundeswehr&quot; in 1955 brought with it a wave of war films which tended to depict the ordinary German soldiers of World War II as brave and apolitical. The Israeli historian Omer Bartov wrote that German films of the 1950s showed the average German soldier as a heroic victim: noble, tough, brave, honourable, and patriotic while fighting hard in a senseless war for a regime that he did not care for. The &quot;08/15&quot; film trilogy of 1954–55 concerns a sensitive young German soldier who would rather play the piano than fight, and who fights on the Eastern Front without understanding why; however, no mention is made of the genocidal aspects of Germany&#x27;s war in East. The last of the &quot;08/15&quot; films ends with Germany occupied by a gang of American soldiers portrayed as bubble-gum chewing, slack-jawed morons and uncultured louts, totally inferior in every respect to the heroic German soldiers shown in the &quot;08/15&quot; films. The only exception is the Jewish American officer, who is shown as both hyper-intelligent and very unscrupulous, which Bartov noted seems to imply that the real tragedy of World War II was the Nazis did not get a chance to exterminate all of the Jews, who have now returned with Germany&#x27;s defeat to once more exploit the German people.

In &quot;The Doctor of Stalingrad&quot; (1958) dealing with German POWs in the Soviet Union, Germans are portrayed as more civilized, humane and intelligent than the Soviets, who are shown for the most part as Mongol savages who brutalized the German POWs. One of the German POWs successfully seduces the beautiful and tough Red Army Captain Alexandra Kasalniskaya (Eva Bartok) who prefers him to the sadistic camp commandant, which as Bartov comments also is meant to show that even in defeat, German men were more sexually virile and potent than their Russian counterparts. In &quot;&quot; (&quot;Dogs, do you want to live forever?&quot;) of 1959, which deals with the Battle of Stalingrad, the focus is on celebrating the heroism of the German soldier in that battle, who are shown as valiantly holding out against overwhelming odds with no mention at all of what those soldiers were fighting for, namely National Socialist ideology or the Holocaust. This period also saw a number of films that depicted the military resistance to Hitler. In &quot;Des Teufels General&quot; (&quot;The Devil&#x27;s General&quot;) of 1954, a Luftwaffe general named Harras loosely modeled after Ernst Udet, appears at first to be cynical fool, but turns out to an anti-Nazi who is secretly sabotaging the German war effort by designing faulty planes. Bartov commented that in this film, the German officer corps is shown as a group of fundamentally noble and civilized men who happened to be serving an evil regime made up of a small gang of gangsterish misfits totally unrepresentative of German society, which served to exculpate both the officer corps and by extension Germany society. Bartov wrote that no German film of the 1950s showed the deep commitment felt by many German soldiers to National Socialism, the utter ruthless way the German Army fought the war and the mindless nihilist brutality of the later Wehrmacht. Bartov wrote that German film-makers liked to show the heroic last stand of the 6th Army at Stalingrad, but none has so far showed the 6th Army&#x27;s massive co-operation with the &quot;Einsatzgruppen&quot; in murdering Soviet Jews in 1941.

Even though there are countless film adaptations of Edgar Wallace novels worldwide, the crime films produced by the German company Rialto Film between 1959 and 1972 are the best-known of those, to the extent that they form their own subgenre known as Krimis (abbreviation for the German term &quot;Kriminalfilm&quot; (or &quot;Kriminalroman&quot;). Other Edgar Wallace adaptations in a similar style were made by the Germans Artur Brauner and Kurt Ulrich, and the British producer Harry Alan Towers.

The international significance of the West German film industry of the 1950s could no longer measure up to that of France, Italy, or Japan. German films were only rarely distributed internationally as they were perceived as provincial. International co-productions of the kind which were becoming common in France and Italy tended to be rejected by German producers (Schneider 1990:43). However a few German films and film-makers did achieve international recognition at this time, among them Bernhard Wicki&#x27;s Oscar-nominated &quot;Die Brücke (The Bridge)&quot; (1959), and the actresses Hildegard Knef and Romy Schneider.

==== 1960–1970 cinema in crisis ====
In the late 1950s, the growth in cinema attendance of the preceding decade first stagnated and then went into freefall throughout the 1960s. By 1969 West German cinema attendance at 172.2 million visits per year was less than a quarter of its 1956 post-war peak. As a consequence of this, numerous German production and distribution companies went out of business in the 1950s and 1960s and cinemas across the Federal Republic closed their doors; the number of screens in West Germany almost halved between the beginning and the end of the decade.

Initially, the crisis was perceived as a problem of overproduction. Consequently, the German film industry cut back on production. 123 German movies were produced in 1955, only 65 in 1965. However, many German film companies followed the 1960s trends of international co-productions with Italy and Spain in such genres as spaghetti westerns and Eurospy films with films shot in those nations or in Yugoslavia that featured German actors in the casts.

The roots of the problem lay deeper in changing economic and social circumstances. Average incomes in the Federal Republic rose sharply and this opened up alternative leisure activities to compete with cinema-going. At this time too, television was developing into a mass medium that could compete with the cinema. In 1953 there were only 1,000,000 sets in West Germany; by 1962 there were 7 million (Connor 1990:49) (Hoffman 1990:69).

The majority of films produced in the Federal Republic in the 1960s were genre works: westerns, especially the series of movies adapted from Karl May&#x27;s popular genre novels which starred Pierre Brice as the Apache Winnetou and Lex Barker as his white blood brother Old Shatterhand; thrillers and crime films, notably a series of Edgar Wallace movies from Rialto Film in which Klaus Kinski, Heinz Drache, Karin Dor and Joachim Fuchsberger were among the regular players. The traditional Krimi films expanded into series based on German pulp fiction heroes such as &quot;Jerry Cotton&quot; played by George Nader and &quot;Kommissar X&quot; played by Tony Kendall and Brad Harris. West Germany also made several horror films including ones starring Christopher Lee. The two genres were combined in the return of &quot;Doctor Mabuse&quot; in a series of several films of the early 1960s.

At the end of the 1960s softcore sex films, both the relatively serious &quot;Aufklärungsfilme&quot; (sex education films) of Oswalt Kolle and such exploitation films as &quot;Schulmädchen-Report (Schoolgirl Report)&quot; (1970) and its successors were produced into the 1970s. Such movies were commercially successful and often enjoyed international distribution, but won little acclaim from critics.

====1960–1980 New German Cinema====
In the 1960s more than three-quarters of the regular cinema audience were lost as consequence of the rising popularity of TV sets at home. As a reaction to the artistic and economic stagnation of German cinema, a group of young film-makers issued the Oberhausen Manifesto on 28 February 1962. This call to arms, which included Alexander Kluge, Edgar Reitz, Peter Schamoni and Franz-Josef Spieker among its signatories, provocatively declared &quot;Der alte Film ist tot. Wir glauben an den neuen&quot; (&quot;The old cinema is dead. We believe in the new cinema&quot;). Other up-and-coming filmmakers allied themselves to this Oberhausen group, among them Rainer Werner Fassbinder, Volker Schlöndorff, Werner Herzog, Jean-Marie Straub, Wim Wenders, Werner Schroeter and Hans-Jürgen Syberberg in their rejection of the existing German film industry and their determination to build a new cinema founded on artistic and social measures rather than commercial success. Most of these directors organized themselves in, or partially co-operated with, the film production and distribution company &quot;Filmverlag der Autoren&quot; established in 1971, which throughout the 1970s brought forth a number of critically acclaimed films. Rosa von Praunheim, who formed the German lesbian and gay movement with his film &quot;It Is Not the Homosexual Who Is Perverse, But the Society in Which He Lives&quot; (1971), also plays an important role.

Despite the foundation of the &quot;Kuratorium Junger Deutscher Film&quot; (Young German Film Committee) in 1965, set up under the auspices of the Federal Ministry of the Interior to support new German films financially, the directors of this New German Cinema were consequently often dependent on money from television. Young filmmakers had the opportunity to test their mettle in such programmes as the stand-alone drama and documentary series &quot;Das kleine Fernsehspiel&quot; (The Little TV Play) or the television films of the crime series &quot;Tatort&quot;. However, the broadcasters sought TV premieres for the films which they had supported financially, with theatrical showings only occurring later. As a consequence, such films tended to be unsuccessful at the box office.

This situation changed after 1974 when the &quot;Film-Fernseh-Abkommen&quot; (Film and Television Accord) was agreed between the Federal Republic&#x27;s main broadcasters, ARD and ZDF, and the German Federal Film Board (a government body created in 1968 to support film-making in Germany). This accord, which has been repeatedly extended up to the present day, provides for the television companies to make available an annual sum to support the production of films which are suitable for both theatrical distribution and television presentation. (The amount of money provided by the public broadcasters has varied between 4.5 and 12.94 million euros per year. Under the terms of the accord, films produced using these funds can only be screened on television 24 months after their theatrical release. They may appear on video or DVD no sooner than six months after cinema release. Nevertheless, the New German Cinema found it difficult to attract a large domestic or international audience.

The socially critical films of the New German Cinema strove to delineate themselves from what had gone before and the works of auteur film-makers such as Kluge and Fassbinder are examples of this, although Fassbinder in his use of stars from German cinema history also sought a reconciliation between the new cinema and the old. In addition, a distinction is sometimes drawn between the avantgarde &quot;Young German Cinema&quot; of the 1960s and the more accessible &quot;New German Cinema&quot; of the 1970s. For their influences the new generation of film-makers looked to Italian neorealism, the French &quot;Nouvelle Vague&quot; and the British New Wave but combined this eclectically with references to the well-established genres of Hollywood cinema. The New German Cinema dealt with contemporary German social problems in a direct way; the Nazi past, the plight of the &quot;Gastarbeiter&quot; (&quot;guest workers&quot;), and modern social developments, were all subjects prominent in New German Cinema films.

Films such as Kluge&#x27;s &quot;Abschied von Gestern&quot; (1966), Herzog&#x27;s &quot;Aguirre, the Wrath of God&quot; (1972), Fassbinder&#x27;s &quot;Fear Eats the Soul&quot; (1974) and &quot;The Marriage of Maria Braun&quot; (1979), and Wenders&#x27; &quot;Paris, Texas&quot; (1984) found critical approval. Often the work of these auteurs was first recognised abroad rather than in Germany itself. The work of post-war Germany&#x27;s leading novelists Heinrich Böll and Günter Grass provided source material for the adaptations &quot;The Lost Honour of Katharina Blum&quot; (1975) (by Schlöndorff and Margarethe von Trotta) and &quot;The Tin Drum&quot; (1979) (by Schlöndorff alone) respectively, the latter becoming the first German film to win the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. The New German Cinema also allowed for female directors to come to the fore and for the development of a feminist cinema which encompassed the works of directors such as Margarethe von Trotta, Helma Sanders-Brahms, Jutta Brückner, Helke Sander and Cristina Perincioli.

German production companies have been quite commonly involved in expensive French and Italian productions from Spaghetti Westerns to French comic book adaptations.

==== 1980–1989 popular productions ====
Having achieved some of its goals, among them the establishment of state funding for the film industry and renewed international recognition for German films, the New German Cinema had begun to show signs of fatigue by the 1980s, even though many of its proponents continued to enjoy individual success.

Among the commercial successes for German films of the 1980s were the &quot;Otto&quot; film series beginning in 1985 starring comedian Otto Waalkes, Wolfgang Petersen&#x27;s adaptation of &quot;The NeverEnding Story&quot; (1984), and the internationally successful &quot;Das Boot&quot; (1981), which still holds the record for most Academy Award nominations for a German film (six). Other notable film-makers who came to prominence in the 1980s include producer Bernd Eichinger and directors Doris Dörrie, Uli Edel, and Loriot.

Away from the mainstream, the splatter film director Jörg Buttgereit came to prominence in the 1980s. The development of arthouse cinemas (&quot;Programmkinos&quot;) from the 1970s onwards provided a venue for the works of less mainstream film-makers like Herbert Achternbusch, Hark Bohm, Dominik Graf, Oliver Herbrich, Rosa von Praunheim or Christoph Schlingensief.

From the mid-1980s the spread of videocassette recorders and the arrival of private TV channels such as RTL Television provided new competition for theatrical film distribution. Cinema attendance, having rallied slightly in the late 1970s after an all-time low of 115.1 million visits in 1976, dropped sharply again from the mid-1980s to end at just 101.6 million visits in 1989. However, the availability of a back catalogue of films on video also allowed for a different relationship between the viewer and an individual film, while private TV channels brought new money into the film industry and provided a launch pad from which new talent could later move into film.

===1990–Modern Germany===

Today&#x27;s biggest German production studios include Babelsberg Studio, Bavaria Film, Constantin Film and UFA. Film releases such as &quot;Run Lola Run&quot; by Tom Tykwer, &quot;Good Bye Lenin!&quot; by Wolfgang Becker, &quot;Head-On&quot; by Fatih Akin, &quot;&quot; by Tom Tykwer and &quot;The Lives of Others&quot; by Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck, have arguably managed to recapture a provocative and innovative nature. Movies like &quot;The Baader Meinhof Complex&quot; produced by Bernd Eichinger achieved some popular success.

Notable directors working in German currently include Sönke Wortmann, Caroline Link (winner of an Academy Award), Romuald Karmakar, Dani Levy, Hans-Christian Schmid, Andreas Dresen, Dennis Gansel and Uli Edel as well as comedy directors Michael Herbig and Til Schweiger.

Internationally, German filmmakers such as Roland Emmerich or Wolfgang Petersen or Uwe Boll built successful careers as directors and producers. Hans Zimmer, a film composer, has become one of the world&#x27;s most acclaimed producers of movie scores. Michael Ballhaus became a renowned cinematographer.

Germany has a long tradition of cooperation with the European-based film industry, which started as early as during the 1960s. Since 1990 the number of international projects financed and co-produced by German filmmakers has expanded.

The new millennium since 2000 has seen a general resurgence of the German film industry, with a higher output and improved returns at the German box office.

The collapse of the GDR had a large effect on the German cinema industry. The viewer count increased with the new population&#x27;s access to western movies. The movies produced in the United States were the most popular, due to the fact that the market was dominated by them and the production was more advanced than Germany&#x27;s. Some other genres that were popular consisted of Romantic Comedies, and Social Commentaries. Wolfgang Petersen and Roland Emmerich both established international success.

Internationally, German productions are benefitting from streaming. Their global market share is rising. Domestically, the German movies improved their market share of about 16% in 1996 to around 30% in 2021., so the movie culture is partly recognized to be underfunded, problem laden and rather inward looking.

==Film financing==
The main production incentive provided by governmental authorities is the Deutscher Filmförderfonds (DFFF) (German Federal Film Fund). The DFFF is a grant given by the Staatsministerin für Kultur und Medien (Federal Government Commissioner for Culture and the Media). To receive the grant a producer has to fulfill different requirements including a cultural eligibility test. The fund offers 50 million euros a year to film producers and or co-producers and grants can amount to up to 20% of the approved German production costs. At least 25% the production costs must be spent in Germany, or only 20%, if the production costs are higher than 20 million euros. The DFFF has been established in 2007 and supported projects in all categories and genres.

In 2015, the Deutsche Filmförderungsfond was reduced from 60 million euros to 50 million euros. To compensate, Finance minister Gabriel announced that the difference will be made up from the budget of the Bundesministerium für Wirtschaft und Klimaschutz (Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action). For the first time in Germany high-profile tv series and digital filmmaking will be funded at a federal level in the same manner as feature films. Funding is also increasingly flowing to international co-productions.

In 1979, the German states also began to establish funding institutions, often with the intention of supporting their own production locations. Today, film funding by the federal states makes up the largest share of film funding in Germany. A total of more than 200 million euros in grants are distributed annually, with an upward trend.

The history of film funding began in Germany with the founding of the UFA GmbH (1917), which was to produce pro-German propaganda films - equipped with funds from industry and banks. During the period of National Socialism (1933–1945), the state indirectly promoted the financing of film projects by establishing the Filmkreditbank GmbH (FKB) (Film Credit Bank).

After the end of World War II, many feature films were initially supported by federal guarantees. However, film funding in its current form did not develop until the 1950s, when television began to supplant motion pictures. In 1967, a film funding law was passed for the first time. The Berlin-based Filmförderungsanstalt (FFA) (Film Funding Agency) was the first major funding institution to be founded in 1968.

Critics accuse film funding in Germany of being institutionally fragmented, making it virtually impossible to coordinate all measures, which would ultimately benefit the quality of productions. They also say that a blanket distribution of grants stifles the incentive to produce films that recoup their production costs.

<doc id="10616" wikidata="Q5356840" url="?curid=10616" title="Frivolous litigation">
<text>Frivolous litigation is the use of legal processes with apparent disregard for the merit of one&#x27;s own arguments. It includes presenting an argument with reason to know that it would certainly fail, or acting without a basic level of diligence in researching the relevant law and facts. That an argument was lost does not imply the argument was frivolous; a party may present an argument with a low chance of success, so long as it proceeds from applicable law.

Frivolous litigation may be based on absurd legal theories, may involve a superabundance or repetition of motions or additional suits, may be uncivil or harassing to the court, or may claim extreme remedies. A claim or defense may be frivolous because it had no underlying justification in fact, or because it was not presented with an argument for a reasonable extension or reinterpretation of the law. A claim may be deemed frivolous because existing laws unequivocally prohibit such a claim, such as a Good Samaritan law.

In the United States, Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and similar state rules require that an attorney perform a due diligence investigation concerning the factual basis for any claim or defense. Jurisdictions differ on whether a claim or defense can be frivolous if the attorney acted in good faith. Because such a defense or claim wastes the court&#x27;s and the other parties&#x27; time, resources and legal fees, sanctions may be imposed by a court upon the party or the lawyer who presents the frivolous defense or claim. The law firm may also be sanctioned, or even held in contempt.

==US Federal statutes and rules of court penalizing frivolous litigation==
In the United States Tax Court, frivolous arguments may result in a penalty of up to $25,000 under . Similarly, section 7482 of the Internal Revenue Code provides that the U.S. Supreme Court and the U.S. Courts of Appeals may impose penalties in which the taxpayer&#x27;s appeal of a U.S. Tax Court decision was &quot;maintained primarily for delay&quot; or where &quot;the taxpayer&#x27;s position in the appeal is frivolous or groundless.&quot; A common example, as shown below, is an argument based on tax protestor claims.

In a noncriminal case in a U.S. District Court, a litigant (or a litigant&#x27;s attorney) who presents any pleading, written motion or other paper to the court is required, under Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, to certify that, to the best of the presenter&#x27;s knowledge and belief, the legal contentions &quot;are warranted by existing law or by a nonfrivolous argument for the extension, modification, or reversal of existing law or the establishment of new law&quot;. Monetary civil penalties for violation of this rule may in some cases be imposed on the litigant or the attorney under Rule 11.

In one case, the Seventh Circuit Court issued an order giving such an attorney &quot;14 days to show cause why he should not be fined $10,000 for his frivolous arguments&quot;. A similar rule penalizing frivolous litigation applies in U.S. Bankruptcy Court under Rule 9011.

The U.S. Congress has enacted section 1912 of Title 28 of the U.S.C. providing that in the U.S. Supreme Court and in the U.S. Courts of Appeals where litigation by the losing party has caused damage to the prevailing party, the court may impose a requirement that the losing party pay the prevailing party for those damages.

Litigants who represent themselves (&quot;in forma pauperis&quot; and &quot;pro se&quot;) sometimes make frivolous arguments due to their limited knowledge of the law and procedure. The particular tendency of prisoners to bring baseless lawsuits led to passage of the Prison Litigation Reform Act of 1995, which limits the ability of prisoners to bring actions without payment.

==Court treatment of frivolous arguments==
An example of a Court&#x27;s treatment of frivolous arguments is found in the case of &quot;Crain v. Commissioner&quot;, 737 F.2d 1417 (1984), from the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit:

==Impact upon filing attorney==
Filing a claim that is ultimately deemed frivolous can be highly damaging to the attorney so filing. Most frivolous lawsuits that are successful are filed without an attorney. Attorney Daniel Evans writes:

==Examples==
===&quot;Washington v. Alaimo&quot;===
In &quot;Washington v. Alaimo&quot; the court listed more than seventy-five frivolous &quot;motions&quot; (a request for a court to issue an order), all of which required the attention of the Court, including the following:
* &quot;Motion to Behoove an Inquisition&quot;
* &quot;Motion for Judex Delegatus&quot;
* &quot;Motion for Restoration of Sanity&quot;
* &quot;Motion for Deinstitutionalization&quot;
* &quot;Motion for Publicity&quot;
* &quot;Motion to Vacate Jurisdiction&quot;
* &quot;Motion for Cesset processus&quot;
* &quot;Motion for Nunc pro tunc&quot;
* &quot;Motion for Psychoanalysis&quot;
* &quot;Motion to Impeach Judge Alaimo&quot;
* &quot;Motion to Renounce Citizenship&quot;
* &quot;Motion to Exhume Body of Alex Hodgson&quot;
* &quot;Motion to Invoke and Execute Rule 15—Retroactive Note: The Court&#x27;s School Days are Over&quot;
* &quot;Motion for Skin Change Operation&quot;
* &quot;Motion for Catered Food Services&quot;
* &quot;Motion to Kiss My Ass&quot;

Washington, an inmate from Georgia, was eventually prohibited from filing any future lawsuits or motions in any district court unless he first posted a contempt bond of $1,500. To be deemed frivolous, a litigant&#x27;s arguments must strike beyond the pale.

===&quot;Pearson v. Chung&quot;===
In 2005, in &quot;Pearson v. Chung&quot;, Roy Pearson, a Washington, D.C. judge, sued a dry cleaning business for $67 million for allegedly losing a pair of his pants. This case has been cited as an example of frivolous litigation. According to Pearson, the dry cleaners lost his pants (which he brought in for a $10.50 alteration) and refused his demands for a large refund. Pearson believed that a sign saying &quot;Satisfaction Guaranteed&quot; in the window of the shop legally entitled him to a refund for the cost of the pants, estimated at $1,000. The $54 million total also included $2.0 million in &quot;mental distress&quot; and $15,000 which he estimated to be the cost of renting a car every weekend to go to another dry cleaners. The court ultimately ruled against Pearson, whose judgeship was subsequently not renewed due to this case and several other actions he filed during his divorce, which were found to demonstrate a lack of &quot;judicial temperament&quot;.

===Jonathan Lee Riches===
In 2010, federal prosecutors asked a judge to help them stop Jonathan Lee Riches from filing any more lawsuits, arguing that his frequent filings were frivolous.

===Gloria Dawn Ironbox===
In July 2013, the Human Rights Tribunal of Ontario dismissed a complaint laid by a man posing as Gloria Dawn Ironbox, a fictional feminist attorney on television series &quot;Family Guy&quot;. The claimant alleged that a marketing scheme by A&amp;W Restaurants was &quot;heteronormative&quot;, &quot;phallocentric&quot; and promoted &quot;cross-sectional hegemony&quot;. Citing feelings of distress and alienation over the lack of &quot;LGBT&quot; representation in A&amp;W naming conventions, he demanded $50,000 in damages for injury to dignity and self-respect as well as an order requiring A&amp;W to adopt naming conventions which include non-traditional families. One such product the claimant demanded was the &quot;Pillow Biter&quot;, described by the claimant as &quot;a large, dark slab of meat stuffed firmly between two, white, clenched buns&quot;.

===Sirgiorgio Sanford Clardy===
In January 2014, Sirgiorgio Sanford Clardy, who is serving a 100-year prison sentence for a beating of a prostitute and her customer, filed a $100 million lawsuit against Nike, in which he claimed that Nike was partially responsible for the assault he committed. Clardy said that Nike should have placed a label in his Jordan shoes warning consumers that they could be used as a dangerous weapon. He was wearing a pair when he repeatedly stomped the face of a client who was trying to leave a Portland hotel without paying Clardy&#x27;s prostitute in June 2012. This lawsuit gained &quot;considerable attention across the nation and the world&quot;.

===&quot;Romine v. Stanton&quot;===
In March 2016, James Romine, one-half of the independent video games developer Digital Homicide Studios, sued video game critic James Stephanie Sterling for criticizing the games published under his studios&#x27; name, seeking $10 million in damages for &quot;assault, libel, and slander&quot; to Romine&#x27;s business. He claimed that Sterling&#x27;s coverage of his studio&#x27;s game &quot;The Slaughtering Grounds&quot; as &quot;Worst Game of 2014 Contender&quot; was not protected under fair use law because he did not believe it was &quot;fair&quot; criticism. An additional lawsuit for $18 million was filed against 100 users on the Steam gaming platform for criticizing their games and business practices, which he had interpreted as &quot;harassment&quot;. The judge issued a subpoena against Valve to disclose the identities of those 100 users. This resulted in Valve removing all published games from Digital Homicide Studios. In addition, Romine filed the lawsuit as an individual and not as a corporation, so such criticism was protected under the right to freedom of speech. The case was dismissed with prejudice in February 2017. This case is also an example of abuse of DMCA takedown requests on YouTube.

===&quot;Erik Estavillo vs Twitch, Inc&quot;===
In June 2020, Erik Estavillo filed a lawsuit against Twitch, claiming that the streaming platform was responsible for his sex addiction, with damages of $25 million, which was to be split between him, Twitch Prime subscribers, and COVID-19 charities. He claimed that Twitch&#x27;s &quot;twisted programming and net code&quot; made it &quot;nearly impossible to use Twitch without being exposed to sexual content&quot;. Other claims included him &quot;chafing his penis every day with [a fleshlight]&quot; and causing a fire by ejaculating on his computer monitor. The filing contained pictures of the female Twitch streamers (such as Amouranth and Pokimane), who he wanted banned from the platform. Estavillo had previously sued Blizzard, Microsoft, Sony, and Nintendo. All of these lawsuits were dismissed with prejudice. This case was dismissed as frivolous in January 2021.

<text>A fiddle is a bowed string musical instrument, most often a violin. It is a colloquial term for the violin, used by players in all genres, including classical music. Although in many cases violins and fiddles are essentially synonymous, the style of the music played may determine specific construction differences between fiddles and classical violins. For example, fiddles may optionally be set up with a bridge with a flatter arch to reduce the range of bow-arm motion needed for techniques such as the double shuffle, a form of bariolage involving rapid alternation between pairs of adjacent strings. To produce a &quot;brighter&quot; tone than the deep tones of gut or synthetic core strings, fiddlers often use steel strings. The fiddle is part of many traditional (folk) styles, which are typically aural traditions—taught &quot;by ear&quot; rather than via written music.

Fiddling is the act of playing the fiddle, and fiddlers are musicians who play it. Among musical styles, fiddling tends to produce rhythms that focus on dancing, with associated quick note changes, whereas classical music tends to contain more vibrato and sustained notes. Fiddling is also open to improvisation and embellishment with ornamentation at the player&#x27;s discretion, in contrast to orchestral performances, which adhere to the composer&#x27;s notes to reproduce a work faithfully. It is less common for a classically trained violinist to play folk music, but today, many fiddlers (e.g., Alasdair Fraser, Brittany Haas, and Alison Krauss) have classical training.

==History==
The medieval fiddle emerged in 10th-century Europe, deriving from the Byzantine lira (, , ), a bowed string instrument of the Byzantine Empire and ancestor of most European bowed instruments.

Lira spread widely westward to Europe; in the 11th and 12th centuries European writers use the terms &quot;fiddle&quot; and &quot;lira&quot; interchangeably when referring to bowed instruments.

The violin in its present form emerged in early 16th-century northern Italy. The earliest pictures of violins, albeit with three strings, are seen in northern Italy around 1530, at around the same time as the words &quot;violino&quot; and &quot;vyollon&quot; are seen in Italian and French documents. One of the earliest explicit descriptions of the instrument, including its tuning, is from the &quot;Epitome musical&quot; by Jambe de Fer, published in Lyon in 1556. By this time, the violin had already begun to spread throughout Europe. The fiddle proved very popular among both street musicians and the nobility; the French king Charles IX ordered Andrea Amati to construct 24 violins for him in 1560. One of these instruments, the &quot;Charles IX&quot;, is the oldest surviving violin. 

Over the centuries, Europe continued to have two distinct types of fiddles: one, relatively square-shaped, held in the arms, became known as the viola da braccio (&quot;arm viol&quot;) family and evolved into the violin; the other, with sloping shoulders and held between the knees, was the viola da gamba (&quot;leg viol&quot;) group. During the Renaissance the gambas were important and elegant instruments; they eventually lost ground to the louder &quot;viola da braccio&quot; family.

==Etymology==
The etymology of &quot;fiddle&quot; is uncertain: it probably derives from the Latin &quot;fidula&quot;, which is the early word for &quot;violin&quot;, or it may be natively Germanic.

The name appears to be related to Icelandic and also Old English . A native Germanic ancestor of &quot;fiddle&quot; might even be the ancestor of the early Romance form of &quot;violin&quot;.

In medieval times, &quot;fiddle&quot; also referred to a predecessor of today&#x27;s violin. Like the violin, it tended to have four strings, but came in a variety of shapes and sizes. Another family of instruments that contributed to the development of the modern fiddle are the viols, which are held between the legs and played vertically, and have fretted fingerboards.

==Ensembles==

In performance, a solo fiddler, or one or two with a group of other instrumentalists, is the norm, though twin fiddling is represented in some North American, Scandinavian, Scottish and Irish styles. Following the folk revivals of the second half of the 20th century, it became common for less formal situations to find large groups of fiddlers playing together—see for example the Calgary Fiddlers, Swedish Spelmanslag folk-musician clubs, and the worldwide phenomenon of Irish sessions.

Orchestral violins, on the other hand, are commonly grouped in sections, or &quot;chairs&quot;. These contrasting traditions may be vestiges of historical performance settings: large concert halls where violins were played required more instruments, before electronic amplification, than did more intimate dance halls and houses that fiddlers played in.

The difference was likely compounded by the different sounds expected of violin music and fiddle music. Historically, the majority of fiddle music was dance music, while violin music had either grown out of dance music or was something else entirely. Violin music came to value a smoothness that fiddling, with its dance-driven clear beat, did not always follow. In situations that required greater volume, a fiddler (as long as they kept the beat) could push their instrument harder than could a violinist. Various fiddle traditions have differing values.

===Scottish, with cello===
In the very late 20th century, a few artists successfully reconstructed the Scottish tradition of violin and &quot;big fiddle&quot;, or cello. Notable recorded examples include Iain Fraser and Christine Hanson, Amelia Kaminski and Christine Hanson&#x27;s Bonnie Lasses, Alasdair Fraser and Natalie Haas&#x27; Fire and Grace, and Tim Macdonald and Jeremy Ward&#x27;s &quot;The Wilds&quot;.

===Balkan, with &quot;kontra&quot;===
Hungarian, Slovenian, and Romanian fiddle players are often accompanied by a three-stringed variant of the viola—known as the &quot;kontra&quot;—and by double bass, with cimbalom and clarinet being less standard yet still common additions to a band. In Hungary, a three-stringed viola variant with a flat bridge, called the &quot;kontra&quot; or &quot;háromhúros brácsa&quot; makes up part of a traditional rhythm section in Hungarian folk music. The flat bridge lets the musician play three-string chords. A three-stringed double bass variant is also used.

==Styles==
To a greater extent than classical violin playing, fiddle playing is characterized by a huge variety of ethnic or folk music traditions, each of which has its own distinctive sound.

===Europe===

====Great Britain====
* English folk music fiddling, including
**Northumbrian fiddle style, which features &quot;seconding&quot;, an improvised harmony part played by a second fiddler.
**Lakeland or Cumbrian fiddling has a repertoire largely based upon hornpipes but also incorporates reels and jigs.
* Scottish fiddling, including:
**Shetland fiddling, which includes trowie tunes said to come from peerie folk. The style is characterised by &quot;ringing strings&quot; and syncopated rhythms.
**A North East (particularly Aberdeenshire and Moray) tradition strongly influenced by baroque violin technique with staccato and Scotch snap bowing techniques and double stops.
**A Scottish Borders tradition with a repertoire heavy in hornpipes and with heavy use of double stops.
**A Highland tradition, highly influenced by the ornamentation and mixolydian scale of the Great Highland Bagpipe, as well as smoother bowing than other Scottish fiddle styles and a swinging of the 6/8 jig rhythm.
**A West Highland and Hebridean Tradition, very closely related to the Highland tradition with major influence from the Gaelic song tradition.
**An Orkney tradition with simpler bowing and ornamentation but with tunes featuring accidentals.
* Welsh fiddling (Welsh &quot;Ffidil&quot;; see Ar Log), a recently revived tradition.

====Ireland====
* Irish folk music fiddling including:
**Donegal fiddling from the northwest in Ulster, which features mazurkas and a Scottish-influenced repertoire including Strathspey and Highland Fling dances. Fiddlers tend to play fast and make heavy use of staccato bowing and may from time to time &quot;play the bass&quot;, meaning a second fiddler may play a melody an octave below where a first fiddler is playing it.
**Sligo fiddling from northern Connacht, which like Donegal fiddling tends to be fast, but with a bouncier feel to the bowing.
**Galway fiddling southern Connacht, which is slower than Sligo or Donegal traditions, with a heavier emphasis on ornamentation. Tunes are occasionally played in Eb or Bb to match the tonality of flat pipes.
**Clare fiddling from northern Munster, which tends to be played near the slower Galway tempo yet with a greater emphasis on the melody itself rather than ornamentation.
**Sliabh Luachra fiddling from the southwest in Munster, characterized by a unique repertoire of polkas and slides, the use of double stops and drones, as well as playing the melody in two octaves as in Donegal.

====Nordic countries====

* Norwegian fiddling (including Hardanger fiddling; see also Bygdedans and Gammaldans), including traditions from:
**Røros and Nord-Noreg styles, both using the standard fiddle.
**Finnskogen, using the standard fiddle, but featuring some flatted notes influenced by Finnish folk music.
**Voss and Telemark styles, both using the Hardanger fiddle.
**Setesdal, which uses both standard and Hardanger fiddles.
* Swedish fiddling (including Låtfiol playing; see also Spelmanslag and Gammaldans), including traditions from:
**Jämtland
**Dalarna
* Finnish fiddling, including the regional styles of:
**Kaustinen
**Ostrobothnia, heavily influenced by Swedish fiddling.

====Continental Europe====

* Austrian fiddling
* French fiddling, including an old tradition from Corrèze and a revived one from Brittany
* Hungarian folk music traditions
* Italian fiddling
* Klezmer fiddling
* Polish fiddling
* Mainland Portuguese and Azorean fiddling
* Romanian fiddling

<doc id="10622" wikidata="Q382616" url="?curid=10622" title="Flugelhorn">
<text>The flugelhorn (), also spelled fluegelhorn, flugel horn, or flügelhorn, is a brass instrument that resembles the trumpet and cornet, but has a wider, more conical bore. Like trumpets and cornets, most flugelhorns are pitched in B♭, though some are in C. It is a type of valved bugle, developed in Germany in the early 19th century from a traditional English valveless bugle. The first version of a valved bugle was sold by Heinrich Stölzel in Berlin in 1828. The valved bugle provided Adolphe Sax (creator of the saxophone) with the inspiration for his B♭ soprano (contralto) saxhorns, on which the modern-day flugelhorn is modelled.

==Etymology==
The German word &quot;Flügel&quot; means &quot;wing&quot; or &quot;flank&quot; in English. In early 18th century Germany, a ducal hunt leader known as a &quot;Flügelmeister&quot; blew the &quot;Flügelhorn&quot;, a large semicircular brass or silver valveless horn, to direct the wings of the hunt. Military use dates from the Seven Years&#x27; War, where this instrument was employed as a predecessor of the bugle.

==Structure and variants==

The flugelhorn is generally pitched in B♭, like most trumpets and cornets. It usually has three piston valves and employs the same fingering system as other brass instruments, although four-valve versions and rotary-valve versions also exist. It can therefore be played by trumpet and cornet players, although it has different playing characteristics. The flugelhorn&#x27;s mouthpiece is more deeply conical than either trumpet or cornet mouthpieces, but not as conical as a French horn mouthpiece.

Some modern flugelhorns feature a fourth valve that lowers the pitch by a perfect fourth (similar to the fourth valve on some euphoniums, tubas, and piccolo trumpets, or the trigger on trombones). This adds a useful low range that, coupled with the flugelhorn&#x27;s dark sound, extends the instrument&#x27;s abilities. Players can also use the fourth valve in place of the first and third valve combination (which is somewhat sharp).

A compact version of the rotary valve flugelhorn is the oval shaped kuhlohorn in B♭. It was developed for the German Protestant trombone choirs.

A pair of bass flugelhorns in C, called fiscorns, are played in the Catalan cobla bands that provide music for sardana dancers.

==Timbre==
The tone is fatter and usually regarded as more mellow and dark than the trumpet or cornet. The sound of the flugelhorn has been described as halfway between a trumpet and a French horn, whereas the cornet&#x27;s sound is halfway between a trumpet and a flugelhorn. The flugelhorn is as agile as the cornet but more difficult to control in the high register (from approximately written G5), where in general it locks onto notes less easily.

==Use and performances==
The flugelhorn is a standard member of the British-style brass band, and it is also used frequently in jazz. It also appears occasionally in orchestral and concert band music. Famous orchestral works with flugelhorn include Igor Stravinsky&#x27;s &quot;Threni&quot;, Ralph Vaughan Williams&#x27;s Ninth Symphony, and Michael Tippett&#x27;s third symphony. The flugelhorn is sometimes substituted for the post horn in Mahler&#x27;s Third Symphony, and for the soprano Roman buccine in Ottorino Respighi&#x27;s &quot;Pines of Rome&quot;. In HK Gruber&#x27;s trumpet concerto &quot;Busking&quot; (2007) the soloist is directed to play a flugelhorn in the slow middle movement. The flugelhorn figured prominently in many of Burt Bacharach&#x27;s 1960s pop song arrangements. It is featured in a solo role in Bert Kaempfert&#x27;s 1962 recording of &quot;That Happy Feeling&quot;. Flugelhorns have occasionally been used as the alto or low soprano voice in a drum and bugle corps.

Another use of the flugelhorn is found in the Dutch and Belgian &quot;Fanfareorkesten&quot; or fanfare orchestras. In these orchestras the flugelhorns, often between 10 and 20 in number, have a significant role, forming the base of the orchestra. They are pitched in B♭, with sporadically an E♭ soloist. Due to poor intonation, these E♭ flugelhorns are mostly replaced by the E♭ trumpet or cornet.

The 1996 film &quot;Brassed Off&quot; features a flugelhorn performance of Rodrigo&#x27;s Concierto de Aranjuez, Adagio, as a key moment. The solo is played by Paul Hughes.

==Notable players==

Joe Bishop, as a member of the Woody Herman band in 1936, was one of the earliest jazz musicians to use the flugelhorn. Shorty Rogers and Kenny Baker began playing it in the early fifties, and Clark Terry used it in Duke Ellington&#x27;s orchestra in the mid-1950s. Chet Baker recorded several albums on the instrument in the 1950s and 1960s. Miles Davis further popularized the instrument in jazz on the albums &quot;Miles Ahead&quot; and &quot;Sketches of Spain&quot;, (both arranged by Gil Evans) though he did not use it much on later projects. Other prominent flugelhorn players include Donald Byrd, Freddy Buzon, Freddie Hubbard, Tom Browne, Lee Morgan, Bill Dixon, Wilbur Harden, Art Farmer, Roy Hargrove, Randy Brecker, Hugh Masekela, Feya Faku, Tony Guerrero, Gary Lord, Jimmy Owens, Maynard Ferguson, Terumasa Hino, Woody Shaw, Bobby Shew, Guido Basso, Kenny Wheeler, Tom Harrell, Bill Coleman, Thad Jones, Arturo Sandoval, Lee Loughnane of the rock band Chicago, Roddy Lorimer of the Kick Horns, Mike Metheny, Harry Beckett, Till Brönner and Ack van Rooyen. Most jazz flugelhorn players use the instrument as an auxiliary to the trumpet, but in the 1970s Chuck Mangione gave up playing the trumpet and concentrated on the flugelhorn alone, notably on his jazz-pop hit song &quot;Feels So Good&quot;. Mangione, in an interview on ABC during the 1980 Winter Olympics, for which he wrote the theme &quot;Give It All You Got&quot;, referred to the flugelhorn as &quot;the right baseball glove&quot;.

Pop flugelhorn players include Probyn Gregory (Brian Wilson Band), Ronnie Wilson of The Gap Band, Rick Braun, Mic Gillette, Jeff Oster, Zach Condon of the band Beirut, Scott Spillane of the band Neutral Milk Hotel, Terry Kirkman of the band The Association, Annie Chappell and Rashawn Ross of the Dave Matthews Band. Marvin Stamm played the flugelhorn solo on &quot;Uncle Albert/Admiral Halsey&quot; by Paul and Linda McCartney.

Classical flugelhorn players include Sergei Nakariakov and Kirill Soldatov.

<text>Folk music is a music genre that includes traditional folk music and the contemporary genre that evolved from the former during the 20th-century folk revival. Some types of folk music may be called world music. Traditional folk music has been defined in several ways: as music transmitted orally, music with unknown composers, music that is played on traditional instruments, music about cultural or national identity, music that changes between generations (folk process), music associated with a people&#x27;s folklore, or music performed by custom over a long period of time. It has been contrasted with commercial and classical styles. The term originated in the 19th century, but folk music extends beyond that.

Starting in the mid-20th century, a new form of popular folk music evolved from traditional folk music. This process and period is called the (second) folk revival and reached a zenith in the 1960s. This form of music is sometimes called contemporary folk music or folk revival music to distinguish it from earlier folk forms. Smaller, similar revivals have occurred elsewhere in the world at other times, but the term folk music has typically not been applied to the new music created during those revivals. This type of folk music also includes fusion genres such as folk rock, folk metal, and others. While contemporary folk music is a genre generally distinct from traditional folk music, in U.S. English it shares the same name, and it often shares the same performers and venues as traditional folk music.

== Traditional folk music ==

=== Definition ===
The terms &quot;folk music&quot;, &quot;folk song&quot;, and &quot;folk dance&quot; are comparatively recent expressions. They are extensions of the term &quot;folklore&quot;, which was coined in 1846 by the English antiquarian William Thoms to describe &quot;the traditions, customs, and superstitions of the uncultured classes&quot;. The term further derives from the German expression &quot;Volk&quot;, in the sense of &quot;the people as a whole&quot; as applied to popular and national music by Johann Gottfried Herder and the German Romantics over half a century earlier. Though it is understood that folk music is the music of the people, observers find a more precise definition to be elusive. Some do not even agree that the term folk music should be used. Folk music may tend to have certain characteristics but it cannot clearly be differentiated in purely musical terms. One meaning often given is that of &quot;old songs, with no known composers,&quot; another is that of music that has been submitted to an evolutionary &quot;process of oral transmission... the fashioning and re-fashioning of the music by the community that give it its folk character.&quot;

Such definitions depend upon &quot;(cultural) processes rather than abstract musical types...&quot;, upon &quot;&quot;continuity&quot; and &quot;oral transmission&quot;...seen as characterizing one side of a cultural dichotomy, the other side of which is found not only in the lower layers of feudal, capitalist and some oriental societies but also in &#x27;primitive&#x27; societies and in parts of &#x27;popular cultures&#x27;&quot;. One widely used definition is simply &quot;Folk music is what the people sing.&quot;

For Scholes, as well as for Cecil Sharp and Béla Bartók, there was a sense of the music of the country as distinct from that of the town. Folk music was already, &quot;...seen as the authentic expression of a way of life now past or about to disappear (or in some cases, to be preserved or somehow revived),&quot; particularly in &quot;a community uninfluenced by art music&quot; and by commercial and printed song. Lloyd rejected this in favor of a simple distinction of economic class yet for him, true folk music was, in Charles Seeger&#x27;s words, &quot;associated with a lower class&quot; in culturally and socially stratified societies. In these terms, folk music may be seen as part of a &quot;schema comprising four musical types: &#x27;primitive&#x27; or &#x27;tribal&#x27;; &#x27;elite&#x27; or &#x27;art&#x27;; &#x27;folk&#x27;; and &#x27;popular&#x27;.&quot;

Music in this genre is also often called &quot;traditional music.&quot; Although the term is usually only descriptive, in some cases people use it as the name of a genre. For example, the Grammy Award previously used the terms &quot;traditional music&quot; and &quot;traditional folk&quot; for folk music that is not contemporary folk music. Folk music may include most indigenous music.

==== Characteristics ====

From a historical perspective, traditional folk music had these characteristics:
* It was transmitted through an oral tradition. Before the 20th century, ordinary people were usually illiterate; they acquired songs by memorizing them. Primarily, this was not mediated by books or recorded or transmitted media. Singers may extend their repertoire using broadsheets or song books, but these secondary enhancements are of the same character as the primary songs experienced in the flesh.
* The music was often related to national culture. It was culturally particular; from a particular region or culture. In the context of an immigrant group, folk music acquires an extra dimension for social cohesion. It is particularly conspicuous in immigrant societies, where Greek Australians, Somali Americans, Punjabi Canadians, and others strive to emphasize their cultural identity. They learn songs and dances that originate in the countries their grandparents came from.
* They commemorate historical and personal events. On certain days of the year, including such holidays as Christmas, Easter, and May Day, particular songs celebrate the yearly cycle. Birthdays, weddings, and funerals may also be noted with songs, dances and special costumes. Religious festivals often have a folk music component. Choral music at these events brings children and non-professional singers to participate in a public arena, giving an emotional bonding that is unrelated to the aesthetic qualities of the music.
* The songs have been performed, by custom, over a long period of time, usually several generations.

As a side-effect, the following characteristics are sometimes present:
* There is no copyright on the songs. Hundreds of folk songs from the 19th century have known authors but have continued in oral tradition to the point where they are considered traditional for purposes of music publishing. This has become much less frequent since the 1940s. Today, almost every folk song that is recorded is credited with an arranger.
* Fusion of cultures: Because cultures interact and change over time, traditional songs evolving over time may incorporate and reflect influences from disparate cultures. The relevant factors may include instrumentation, tunings, voicings, phrasing, subject matter, and even production methods.

=== Tune ===
In folk music, a &quot;tune&quot; is a short instrumental piece, a melody, often with repeating sections, and usually played a number of times. A collection of tunes with structural similarities is known as a tune-family. &quot;America&#x27;s Musical Landscape&quot; says &quot;the most common form for tunes in folk music is AABB, also known as binary form.&quot;

In some traditions, tunes may be strung together in medleys or sets. Studies demonstrate that specific traditional music patterns from European musical heritage follow mathematical sequences helping traditional songs survive through oral passing of melodies between generations.

=== Origins ===

Throughout most of human history, listening to recorded music was not possible. Music was made by common people during both their work and leisure, as well as during religious activities. The work of economic production was often manual and communal. Manual labor often included singing by the workers, which served several practical purposes. It reduced the boredom of repetitive tasks, it kept the rhythm during synchronized pushes and pulls, and it set the pace of many activities such as planting, weeding, reaping, threshing, weaving, and milling. In leisure time, singing and playing musical instruments were common forms of entertainment and history-telling—even more common than today when electrically enabled technologies and widespread literacy make other forms of entertainment and information-sharing competitive.

Some believe that folk music originated as art music that was changed and probably debased by oral transmission while reflecting the character of the society that produced it. In many societies, especially preliterate ones, the cultural transmission of folk music requires learning by ear, although notation has evolved in some cultures. Different cultures may have different notions concerning a division between &quot;folk&quot; music on the one hand and of &quot;art&quot; and &quot;court&quot; music on the other. In the proliferation of popular music genres, some traditional folk music became also referred to as &quot;World music&quot; or &quot;Roots music&quot;.

The English term &quot;folklore&quot;, to describe traditional folk music and dance, entered the vocabulary of many continental European nations, each of which had its folk-song collectors and revivalists. The distinction between &quot;authentic&quot; folk and national and popular song in general has always been loose, particularly in America and Germany – for example, popular songwriters such as Stephen Foster could be termed &quot;folk&quot; in America. The International Folk Music Council definition allows that the term can also apply to music that, &quot;...has originated with an individual composer and has subsequently been absorbed into the unwritten, living tradition of a community. But the term does not cover a song, dance, or tune that has been taken over ready-made and remains unchanged.&quot;

The post–World War II folk revival in America and in Britain started a new genre, Contemporary Folk Music, and brought an additional meaning to the term &quot;folk music&quot;: newly composed songs, fixed in form and by known authors, which imitated some form of traditional music. The popularity of &quot;contemporary folk&quot; recordings caused the appearance of the category &quot;Folk&quot; in the Grammy Awards of 1959; in 1970 the term was dropped in favor of &quot;Best Ethnic or Traditional Recording (including Traditional Blues)&quot;, while 1987 brought a distinction between &quot;Best Traditional Folk Recording&quot; and &quot;Best Contemporary Folk Recording&quot;. After that, they had a &quot;Traditional music&quot; category that subsequently evolved into others. The term &quot;folk&quot;, by the start of the 21st century, could cover singer-songwriters, such as Donovan from Scotland and American Bob Dylan, who emerged in the 1960s and much more. This completed a process to where &quot;folk music&quot; no longer meant only traditional folk music.

=== Subject matter ===
Traditional folk music often includes sung words, although folk instrumental music occurs commonly in dance music traditions. Narrative verse looms large in the traditional folk music of many cultures. This encompasses such forms as traditional epic poetry, much of which was meant originally for oral performance, sometimes accompanied by instruments. Many epic poems of various cultures were pieced together from shorter pieces of traditional narrative verse, which explains their episodic structure, repetitive elements, and their frequent &quot;in medias res&quot; plot developments. Other forms of traditional narrative verse relate the outcomes of battles or lament tragedies or natural disasters.

Sometimes, as in the triumphant &quot;Song of Deborah&quot; found in the Biblical &quot;Book of Judges&quot;, these songs celebrate victory. Laments for lost battles and wars, and the lives lost in them, are equally prominent in many traditions; these laments keep alive the cause for which the battle was fought. The narratives of traditional songs often also remember folk heroes such as John Henry or Robin Hood. Some traditional song narratives recall supernatural events or mysterious deaths.

Hymns and other forms of religious music are often of traditional and unknown origin. Western musical notation was originally created to preserve the lines of Gregorian chant, which before its invention was taught as an oral tradition in monastic communities. Traditional songs such as &quot;Green grow the rushes, O&quot; present religious lore in a mnemonic form, as do Western Christmas carols and similar traditional songs.

Work songs frequently feature call and response structures and are designed to enable the laborers who sing them to coordinate their efforts in accordance with the rhythms of the songs. They are frequently, but not invariably, composed. In the American armed forces, a lively oral tradition preserves jody calls (&quot;Duckworth chants&quot;) which are sung while soldiers are on the march. Professional sailors made similar use of a large body of sea shanties. Love poetry, often of a tragic or regretful nature, prominently figures in many folk traditions. Nursery rhymes, children&#x27;s songs and nonsense verse used to amuse or quiet children also are frequent subjects of traditional songs.

=== Folk song transformations and variations ===

Music transmitted by word of mouth through a community, in time, develops many variants, since this transmission cannot produce word-for-word and note-for-note accuracy. In addition, folk singers may choose to modify the songs they hear.

For example, around 1970 the song &quot;Mullā Mohammed Jān&quot; spread from Herat to the rest of Afghanistan, and Iran where it was recorded. Due to its repetitive refrain and the predictability of the second half of each verse, it allowed for both its popularization, and for each singer to create their own version of the song without being overly-concerned for a melody or restrictive poetic rhythm.

Because variants proliferate naturally, there is generally no &quot;authoritative&quot; version of song. Researchers in traditional songs have encountered countless versions of the Barbara Allen ballad throughout the English-speaking world, and these versions often differ greatly from each other. The original is not known; many versions can lay an equal claim to authenticity.

Influential folklorist Cecil Sharp felt that these competing variants of a traditional song would undergo a process of improvement akin to biological natural selection: only those new variants that were the most appealing to ordinary singers would be picked up by others and transmitted onward in time. Thus, over time we would expect each traditional song to become more aesthetically appealing, due to incremental community improvement.

Literary interest in the popular ballad form dates back at least to Thomas Percy and William Wordsworth. English Elizabethan and Stuart composers had often evolved their music from folk themes, the classical suite was based upon stylised folk-dances, and Joseph Haydn&#x27;s use of folk melodies is noted. But the emergence of the term &quot;folk&quot; coincided with an &quot;outburst of national feeling all over Europe&quot; that was particularly strong at the edges of Europe, where national identity was most asserted. Nationalist composers emerged in Central Europe, Russia, Scandinavia, Spain and Britain: the music of Dvořák, Smetana, Grieg, Rimsky-Korsakov, Brahms, Liszt, de Falla, Wagner, Sibelius, Vaughan Williams, Bartók, and many others drew upon folk melodies.

=== Regional forms ===
While the loss of traditional folk music in the face of the rise of popular music is a worldwide phenomenon, it is not one occurring at a uniform rate throughout the world. The process is most advanced &quot;where industrialization and commercialisation of culture are most advanced&quot; but also occurs more gradually even in settings of lower technological advancement. However, the loss of traditional music is slowed in nations or regions where traditional folk music is a badge of cultural or national identity. Ethnomusicologists notes that the Intangible Cultural Heritage program organized by UNESCO stands among the principal measures implemented by governments which protect regional music traditions from disappearing.

=== Early folk music, fieldwork and scholarship ===
Much of what is known about folk music prior to the development of audio recording technology in the 19th century comes from fieldwork and writings of scholars, collectors and proponents.

==== 19th-century Europe ====
Starting in the 19th century, academics and amateur scholars, taking note of the musical traditions being lost, initiated various efforts to preserve the music of the people. One such effort was the collection by Francis James Child in the late 19th century of the texts of over three hundred ballads in the English and Scots traditions (called the Child Ballads), some of which predated the 16th century.

Contemporaneously with Child, the Reverend Sabine Baring-Gould and later Cecil Sharp worked to preserve a great body of English rural traditional song, music and dance, under the aegis of what became and remains the English Folk Dance and Song Society (EFDSS). Sharp campaigned with some success to have English traditional songs (in his own heavily edited and expurgated versions) to be taught to school children in hopes of reviving and prolonging the popularity of those songs. Throughout the 1960s and early to mid-1970s, American scholar Bertrand Harris Bronson published an exhaustive four-volume collection of the then-known variations of both the texts and tunes associated with what came to be known as the Child Canon. He also advanced some significant theories concerning the workings of oral-aural tradition.

Similar activity was also under way in other countries. One of the most extensive was perhaps the work done in Riga by Krisjanis Barons, who between the years 1894 and 1915 published six volumes that included the texts of 217,996 Latvian folk songs, the &quot;Latvju dainas&quot;. In Norway the work of collectors such as Ludvig Mathias Lindeman was extensively used by Edvard Grieg in his &quot;Lyric Pieces&quot; for piano and in other works, which became immensely popular.

Around this time, composers of classical music developed a strong interest in collecting traditional songs, and a number of composers carried out their own field work on traditional music. These included Percy Grainger and Ralph Vaughan Williams in England and Béla Bartók in Hungary. These composers, like many of their predecessors, both made arrangements of folk songs and incorporated traditional material into original classical compositions.

==== North America ====
The advent of audio recording technology provided folklorists with a revolutionary tool to preserve vanishing musical forms. The earliest American folk music scholars were with the American Folklore Society (AFS), which emerged in the late 1800s. Their studies expanded to include Native American music, but still treated folk music as a historical item preserved in isolated societies as well. In North America, during the 1930s and 1940s, the Library of Congress worked through the offices of traditional music collectors Robert Winslow Gordon, Alan Lomax and others to capture as much North American field material as possible. John Lomax (the father of Alan Lomax) was the first prominent scholar to study distinctly American folk music such as that of cowboys and southern blacks. His first major published work was in 1911, &quot;Cowboy Songs and Other Frontier Ballads&quot;. and was arguably the most prominent US folk music scholar of his time, notably during the beginnings of the folk music revival in the 1930s and early 1940s. Cecil Sharp also worked in America, recording the traditional songs of the Appalachian Mountains in 1916–1918 in collaboration with Maud Karpeles and Olive Dame Campbell and is considered the first major scholar covering American folk music. Campbell and Sharp are represented under other names by actors in the modern movie &quot;Songcatcher&quot;.

One strong theme amongst folk scholars in the early decades of the 20th century was regionalism, the analysis of the diversity of folk music (and related cultures) based on regions of the US rather than based on a given song&#x27;s historical roots. Later, a dynamic of class and circumstances was added to this. The most prominent regionalists were literary figures with a particular interest in folklore. Carl Sandburg often traveled the U.S. as a writer and a poet. He also collected songs in his travels and, in 1927, published them in the book &quot;The American Songbag&quot;. Rachel Donaldson, a historian who worked for Vanderbilt, later stated this about The American Songbird in her analysis of the folk music revival. &quot;In his collections of folk songs, Sandburg added a class dynamic to popular understandings of American folk music. This was the final element of the foundation upon which the early folk music revivalists constructed their own view of Americanism. Sandburg&#x27;s working-class Americans joined with the ethnically, racially, and regionally diverse citizens that other scholars, public intellectuals, and folklorists celebrated their own definitions of the American folk, definitions that the folk revivalists used in constructing their own understanding of American folk music, and an overarching American identity&quot;.

Prior to the 1930s, the study of folk music was primarily the province of scholars and collectors. The 1930s saw the beginnings of larger scale themes, commonalities, and linkages in folk music developing in the populace and practitioners as well, often related to the Great Depression. Regionalism and cultural pluralism grew as influences and themes. During this time folk music began to become enmeshed with political and social activism themes and movements. Two related developments were the U.S. Communist Party&#x27;s interest in folk music as a way to reach and influence Americans, and politically active prominent folk musicians and scholars seeing communism as a possible better system, through the lens of the Great Depression. Woody Guthrie exemplifies songwriters and artists with such an outlook.

Folk music festivals proliferated during the 1930s. President Franklin Roosevelt was a fan of folk music, hosted folk concerts at the White House, and often patronized folk festivals. One prominent festival was Sarah Gertrude Knott&#x27;s National Folk Festival, established in St. Louis, Missouri in 1934. Under the sponsorship of the Washington Post, the festival was held in Washington, DC at Constitution Hall from 1937 to 1942. The folk music movement, festivals, and the wartime effort were seen as forces for social goods such as democracy, cultural pluralism, and the removal of culture and race-based barriers.

The American folk music revivalists of the 1930s approached folk music in different ways. Three primary schools of thought emerged: &quot;Traditionalists&quot; (e.g. Sarah Gertrude Knott and John Lomax) emphasized the preservation of songs as artifacts of deceased cultures. &quot;Functional&quot; folklorists (e.g. Botkin and Alan Lomax) maintained that songs only retain relevance when used by those cultures which retain the traditions which birthed those songs. &quot;Left-wing&quot; folk revivalists (e.g. Charles Seeger and Lawrence Gellert) emphasized music&#x27;s role &quot;in &#x27;people&#x27;s&#x27; struggles for social and political rights&quot;. By the end of the 1930s these and others had turned American folk music into a social movement.

Sometimes folk musicians became scholars and advocates themselves. For example, Jean Ritchie (1922–2015) was the youngest child of a large family from Viper, Kentucky that had preserved many of the old Appalachian traditional songs. Ritchie, living in a time when the Appalachians had opened up to outside influence, was university educated and ultimately moved to New York City, where she made a number of classic recordings of the family repertoire and published an important compilation of these songs.

In January 2012, the American Folklife Center at the Library of Congress, with the Association for Cultural Equity, announced that they would release Lomax&#x27;s vast archive of 1946 and later recording in digital form. Lomax spent the last 20 years of his life working on an Interactive Multimedia educational computer project he called the Global Jukebox, which included 5,000 hours of sound recordings, 400,000 feet of film, 3,000 videotapes, and 5,000 photographs. As of March 2012, this has been accomplished. Approximately 17,400 of Lomax&#x27;s recordings from 1946 and later have been made available free online. This material from Alan Lomax&#x27;s independent archive, begun in 1946, which has been digitized and offered by the Association for Cultural Equity, is &quot;distinct from the thousands of earlier recordings on acetate and aluminum discs he made from 1933 to 1942 under the auspices of the Library of Congress. This earlier collection—which includes the famous Jelly Roll Morton, Woody Guthrie, Lead Belly, and Muddy Waters sessions, as well as Lomax&#x27;s prodigious collections made in Haiti and Eastern Kentucky (1937) — is the provenance of the American Folklife Center&quot; at the library of Congress.

=== National and regional forms ===

==== Africa ====

Africa is a vast continent and its regions and nations have distinct musical traditions. The music of North Africa for the most part has a different history from Sub-Saharan African music traditions.

The music and dance forms of the African diaspora, including African American music and many Caribbean genres like soca, calypso and Zouk; and Latin American music genres like the samba, Cuban rumba, salsa; and other clave (rhythm)-based genres, were founded to varying degrees on the music of enslaved Africans, which has in turn influenced African popular music.

==== Asia ====
Many Asian civilizations distinguish between art/court/classical styles and &quot;folk&quot; music. For example, the late Alam Lohar is an example of a South Asian singer who was classified as a folk singer.

Khunung Eshei/Khuland Eshei is an ancient folk song from India, a country of Asia, of Meiteis of Manipur, that is an example of Asian folk music, and how they put it into its own genre.

===== Folk music of China =====

Archaeological discoveries date Chinese folk music back 7000 years; it is largely based on the pentatonic scale.

Han traditional weddings and funerals usually include a form of oboe called a suona, and apercussive ensembles called a chuigushou. Ensembles consisting of mouth organs (sheng), shawms (suona), flutes (dizi) and percussion instruments (especially yunluo gongs) are popular in northern villages; their music is descended from the imperial temple music of Beijing, Xi&#x27;an, Wutai shan and Tianjin. Xi&#x27;an drum music, consisting of wind and percussive instruments, is popular around Xi&#x27;an, and has received some commercial popularity outside of China. Another important instrument is the sheng, a type of Chinese pipe, an ancient instrument that is ancestor of all Western free reed instruments, such as the accordion. Parades led by Western-type brass bands are common, often competing in volume with a shawm/chuigushou band.

In southern Fujian and Taiwan, Nanyin or Nanguan is a genre of traditional ballads. They are sung by a woman accompanied by a xiao and a pipa, as well as other traditional instruments. The music is generally sorrowful and typically deals with love-stricken people. Further south, in Shantou, Hakka and Chaozhou, zheng ensembles are popular. Sizhu ensembles use flutes and bowed or plucked string instruments to make harmonious and melodious music that has become popular in the West among some listeners. These are popular in Nanjing and Hangzhou, as well as elsewhere along the southern Yangtze area. Jiangnan Sizhu (silk and bamboo music from Jiangnan) is a style of instrumental music, often played by amateur musicians in tea houses in Shanghai. Guangdong Music or Cantonese Music is instrumental music from Guangzhou and surrounding areas. The music from this region influenced Yueju (Cantonese Opera) music, which would later grow popular during the self-described &quot;Golden Age&quot; of China under the PRC.

Folk songs have been recorded since ancient times in China. The term Yuefu was used for a broad range of songs such as ballads, laments, folk songs, love songs, and songs performed at court. China is a vast country, with a multiplicity of linguistic and geographic regions. Folk songs are categorized by geographic region, language type, ethnicity, social function (e.g. work song, ritual song, courting song) and musical type. Modern anthologies collected by Chinese folklorists distinguish between traditional songs, revolutionary songs, and newly invented songs. The songs of northwest China are known as &quot;flower songs&quot; (&quot;hua&#x27;er&quot;), a reference to beautiful women, while in the past they were notorious for their erotic content. The village &quot;mountain songs&quot; (&quot;shan&#x27;ge&quot;) of Jiangsu province were also well known for their amorous themes. Other regional song traditions include the &quot;strummed lyrics&quot; (&quot;tanci&quot;) of the Lower Yangtze Delta, the Cantonese Wooden Fish tradition (&quot;muyu&quot; or &quot;muk-yu&quot;) and the Drum Songs (&quot;guci&quot;) of north China.

In the twenty-first century many cherished Chinese folk songs have been inscribed in the UNESCO Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity. In the process, songs once seen as vulgar are now being reconstructed as romantic courtship songs. Regional song competitions, popular in many communities, have promoted professional folk singing as a career, with some individual folk singers having gained national prominence.

===== Traditional folk music of Sri Lanka =====

The art, music and dance of Sri Lanka derive from the elements of nature, and have been enjoyed and developed in the Buddhist environment. The music is of several types and uses only a few types of instruments. The folk songs and poems were used in social gatherings to work together. The Indian influenced classical music has grown to be unique. The traditional drama, music and songs of Sinhala Light Music are typically Sri Lankan.
The temple paintings and carvings feature birds, elephants, wild animals, flowers, and trees, and the Traditional 18 Dances display the dancing of birds and animals. For example:
* Mayura Wannama – The dance of the peacock
* Hanuma Wannama – The dance of the monkey
* Gajaga Wannama – The dance of the elephant

Musical types include:
* Local drama music includes Kolam and Nadagam types. Kolam music is based on low country tunes primarily to accompany mask dance in exorcism rituals. It is considered less developed/evolved, true to the folk tradition and a preserving of a more ancient artform. It is limited to approximately 3–4 notes and is used by the ordinary people for pleasure and entertainment.
* Nadagam music is a more developed form of drama influenced from South Indian street drama which was introduced by some south Indian artists. Phillippu Singho from Negombo in 1824 performed &quot;Harishchandra Nadagama&quot; in Hnguranketha which was originally written in the Telingu language. Later &quot;Maname&quot;, &quot;Sanda kinduru&quot; and others were introduced. Don Bastian of Dehiwala introduced Noorthy firstly by looking at Indian dramas and then John de Silva developed it as did Ramayanaya in 1886.
* Sinhala light music is currently the most popular type of music in Sri Lanka and enriched with the influence of folk music, kolam music, nadagam music, noorthy music, film music, classical music, Western music, and others. Some artists visited India to learn music and later started introducing light music. Ananda Samarakone was the pioneer of this and also composed the national anthem.
The classical Sinhalese orchestra consists of five categories of instruments, but among the percussion instruments, the drum is essential for dance.
The vibrant beat of the rhythm of the drums form the basic of the dance. The dancers&#x27; feet bounce off the floor and they leap and swirl in patterns that reflect the complex rhythms of the drum beat. This drum beat may seem simple on the first hearing but it takes a long time to master the intricate rhythms and variations, which the drummer sometimes can bring to a crescendo of intensity. There are six common types of drums falling within 3 styles (one-faced, two-faced, and flat-faced):
* The typical Sinhala Dance is identified as the Kandyan dance and the Gatabera drum is indispensable to this dance.
* Yak-bera is the demon drum or the drum used in low country dance in which the dancers wear masks and perform devil dancing, which has become a highly developed form of art.
* The Daula is a barrel-shaped drum, and it was used as a companion drum with a Thammattama in the past, to keep strict time with the beat.
* The Thammattama is a flat, two-faced drum. The drummer strikes the drum on the two surfaces on top with sticks, unlike the others where you drum on the sides. This is a companion drum to the aforementioned Dawula.
* A small double-headed hand drum is used to accompany songs. It is primarily heard in the poetry dances like vannam.
* The Rabana is a flat-faced circular drum and comes in several sizes. The large Rabana - called the Banku Rabana - has to be placed on the floor like a circular short-legged table and several people (traditionally women) can sit around it and beat on it with both hands. This is used in festivals such as the Sinhalese New Year and ceremonies such as weddings. The resounding beat of the Rabana symbolizes the joyous moods of the occasion. The small Rabana is a form of mobile drum beat since the player carries it wherever the person goes.

Other instruments include:
* The Thalampata – 2 small cymbals joined by a string.
* The wind section, is dominated by an instrument akin to the clarinet. This is not normally used for dances. This is important to note because the Sinhalese dance is not set to music as the western world knows it; rhythm is king.
* The flutes of metal such as silver &amp; brass produce shrill music to accompany Kandyan Dances, while the plaintive strains of music of the reed flute may pierce the air in devil-dancing. The conch-shell (Hakgediya) is another form of a natural instrument, and the player blows it to announce the opening of ceremonies of grandeur.
* The Ravanahatha (ravanhatta, rawanhattha, ravanastron or ravana hasta veena) is a bowed fiddle that was once popular in Western India. It is believed to have originated among the Hela civilisation of Sri Lanka in the time of King Ravana. The bowl is made of cut coconut shell, the mouth of which is covered with goat hide. A dandi, made of bamboo, is attached to this shell. The principal strings are two: one of steel and the other of a set of horsehair. The long bow has jingle bells

==== Australia ====

Indigenous Australian music includes the music of Aboriginal Australians and Torres Strait Islanders, who are collectively called Indigenous Australians; it incorporates a variety of distinctive traditional music styles practiced by Indigenous Australian peoples, as well as a range of contemporary musical styles of and fusion with European traditions as interpreted and performed by indigenous Australian artists. Music has formed an integral part of the social, cultural and ceremonial observances of these peoples, down through the millennia of their individual and collective histories to the present day. The traditional forms include many aspects of performance and musical instruments unique to particular regions or Indigenous Australian groups. Equal elements of musical tradition are common through much of the Australian continent, and even beyond. The culture of the Torres Strait Islanders is related to that of adjacent parts of New Guinea and so their music is also related. Music is a vital part of Indigenous Australians&#x27; cultural maintenance.

Folk song traditions were taken to Australia by early settlers from England, Scotland and Ireland and gained particular foothold in the rural outback. The rhyming songs, poems and tales written in the form of bush ballads often relate to the itinerant and rebellious spirit of Australia in The Bush, and the authors and performers are often referred to as bush bards. The 19th century was the golden age of bush ballads. Several collectors have catalogued the songs including John Meredith whose recording in the 1950s became the basis of the collection in the National Library of Australia.

The songs tell personal stories of life in the wide open country of Australia. Typical subjects include mining, raising and droving cattle, sheep shearing, wanderings, war stories, the 1891 Australian shearers&#x27; strike, class conflicts between the landless working class and the squatters (landowners), and outlaws such as Ned Kelly, as well as love interests and more modern fare such as trucking. The most famous bush ballad is &quot;Waltzing Matilda&quot;, which has been called &quot;the unofficial national anthem of Australia&quot;.

==== Europe ====

===== Celtic traditional music =====

Celtic music is a term used by artists, record companies, music stores and music magazines to describe a broad grouping of musical genres that evolved out of the folk musical traditions of the Celtic peoples. These traditions include Irish, Scottish, Manx, Cornish, Welsh, and Breton traditions. Asturian and Galician music is often included, though there is no significant research showing that this has any close musical relationship. Brittany&#x27;s Folk revival began in the 1950s with the &quot;bagadoù&quot; and the &quot;kan-ha-diskan&quot; before growing to world fame through Alan Stivell&#x27;s work since the mid-1960s.

In Ireland, The Clancy Brothers and Tommy Makem (although its members were all Irish-born, the group became famous while based in New York&#x27;s Greenwich Village), The Dubliners, Clannad, Planxty, The Chieftains, The Pogues, The Corrs, The Irish Rovers, and a variety of other folk bands have done much over the past few decades to revitalise and re-popularise Irish traditional music. These bands were rooted, to a greater or lesser extent, in a tradition of Irish music and benefited from the efforts of artists such as Seamus Ennis and Peter Kennedy.

In Scotland, The Corries, Silly Wizard, Capercaillie, Runrig, Jackie Leven, Julie Fowlis, Karine Polwart, Alasdair Roberts, Dick Gaughan, Wolfstone, Boys of the Lough, and The Silencers have kept Scottish folk vibrant and fresh by mixing traditional Scottish and Gaelic folk songs with more contemporary genres. These artists have also been commercially successful in continental Europe and North America. There is an emerging wealth of talent in the Scottish traditional music scene, with bands such as Mànran, Skipinnish, Barluath and Breabach and solo artists such as Patsy Reid, Robyn Stapleton and Mischa MacPherson gaining a lot of success in recent years.

===== Central and Eastern Europe =====

During the Eastern Bloc era, national folk dancing was actively promoted by the state. Dance troupes from Russia and Poland toured non-communist Europe from about 1937 to 1990. The Red Army Choir recorded many albums, becoming the most popular military band. Eastern Europe is also the origin of the Jewish Klezmer tradition.

The polka is a central European dance and also a genre of dance music familiar throughout Europe and the Americas. It originated in the middle of the 19th century in Bohemia. Polka is still a popular genre of folk music in many European countries and is performed by folk artists in Poland, Latvia, Lithuania, Czech Republic, Netherlands, Croatia, Slovenia, Germany, Hungary, Austria, Switzerland, Italy, Ukraine, Belarus, Russia and Slovakia. Local varieties of this dance are also found in the Nordic countries, United Kingdom, Republic of Ireland, Latin America (especially Mexico), and in the United States.

German Volkslieder perpetuated by Liederhandschriften manuscripts like &quot;Carmina Burana&quot; date back to medieval Minnesang and Meistersinger traditions. Those folk songs revived in the late 18th century period of German Romanticism, first promoted by Johann Gottfried Herder and other advocates of the Enlightenment, later compiled by Achim von Arnim and Clemens Brentano (&quot;Des Knaben Wunderhorn&quot;) as well as by Ludwig Uhland.

The Volksmusik and folk dances genre, especially in the Alpine regions of Bavaria, Austria, Switzerland (&quot;Kuhreihen&quot;) and South Tyrol, up to today has lingered in rustic communities against the backdrop of industrialisation—Low German shanties or the Wienerlied (&quot;Schrammelmusik&quot;) being notable exceptions. Slovene folk music in Upper Carniola and Styria also originated from the Alpine traditions, like the prolific Lojze Slak Ensemble. Traditional &quot;Volksmusik&quot; is not to be confused with commercial &quot;Volkstümliche Musik&quot;, which is a derivation of that.

The Hungarian group Muzsikás played numerous American tours and participated in the Hollywood movie &quot;The English Patient&quot; while the singer Márta Sebestyén worked with the band Deep Forest. The Hungarian &quot;táncház&quot; movement, started in the 1970s, involves strong cooperation between musicology experts and enthusiastic amateurs. However, traditional Hungarian folk music and folk culture barely survived in some rural areas of Hungary, and it has also begun to disappear among the ethnic Hungarians in Transylvania. The táncház movement revived broader folk traditions of music, dance, and costume together and created a new kind of music club. The movement spread to ethnic Hungarian communities elsewhere in the world.

===== Balkan music =====


Balkan folk music was influenced by the mingling of Balkan ethnic groups in the period of the Ottoman Empire. It comprises the music of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Greece, Montenegro, Serbia, Romania, North Macedonia, Albania, some of the historical states of Yugoslavia or Serbia and Montenegro and geographical regions such as Thrace. Some music is characterised by complex rhythm.

A notable act is the Mystery of the Bulgarian Voices, which won the Grammy Award for Best Traditional Folk Recording at the 32nd annual ceremony.

An important part of the whole Balkan folk music is the music of the local Romani ethnic minority, which is called tallava and brass band music.

===== Nordic folk music =====


Nordic folk music includes a number of traditions in Northern European, especially Scandinavian, countries. The Nordic countries are generally taken to include Iceland, Norway, Finland, Sweden, Denmark and Greenland. Sometimes it is taken to include the Baltic countries of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania.
The many regions of the Nordic countries share certain traditions, many of which have diverged significantly, like Psalmodicon of Denmark, Sweden, and Norway. It is possible to group together the Baltic states (or, sometimes, only Estonia) and parts of northwest Russia as sharing cultural similarities, although the relationship has gone cold in recent years. Contrast with Norway, Sweden, Denmark and the Atlantic islands of Iceland and the Faroe Islands, which share virtually no similarities of that kind. Greenland&#x27;s Inuit culture has its own unique musical traditions. Finland shares many cultural similarities with both the Baltic nations and the Scandinavian nations. The Sami of Sweden, Norway, Finland and Russia have their own unique culture, with ties to the neighboring cultures.

Swedish folk music is a genre of music based largely on folkloric collection work that began in the early 19th century in Sweden. The primary instrument of Swedish folk music is the fiddle. Another common instrument, unique to Swedish traditions, is the nyckelharpa. Most Swedish instrumental folk music is dance music; the signature music and dance form within Swedish folk music is the polska. Vocal and instrumental traditions in Sweden have tended to share tunes historically, though they have been performed separately. Beginning with the folk music revival of the 1970s, vocalists and instrumentalists have also begun to perform together in folk music ensembles.

==== Latin America ====

The folk music of the Americas consists of the encounter and union of three main musical types: European traditional music, traditional music of the American natives, and tribal African music that arrived with slaves from that continent.

The particular case of Latin and South American music points to Andean music among other native musical styles (such as Caribbean and pampean), Iberian music of Spain and Portugal, and generally speaking African tribal music, the three of which fused together evolving in differentiated musical forms in Central and South America.

Andean music comes from the region of the Quechuas, Aymaras, and other peoples that inhabit the general area of the Inca Empire prior to European contact. It includes folklore music of parts of Bolivia, Ecuador, Chile, Colombia, Peru and Venezuela. Andean music is popular to different degrees across Latin America, having its core public in rural areas and among indigenous populations. The movement of the 1970s revived the genre across Latin America and brought it to places where it was unknown or forgotten.

 (Spanish for &#x27;new song&#x27;) is a movement and genre within Latin American and Iberian folk music, folk-inspired music, and socially committed music. In some respects its development and role is similar to the second folk music revival in North America. This includes evolution of this new genre from traditional folk music, essentially contemporary folk music except that that English genre term is not commonly applied to it. Nueva cancion is recognized as having played a powerful role in the social upheavals in Portugal, Spain and Latin America during the 1970s and 1980s.

Nueva cancion first surfaced during the 1960s as &quot;The Chilean New Song&quot; in Chile. The musical style emerged shortly afterwards in Spain and areas of Latin America where it came to be known under similar names. renewed traditional Latin American folk music, and with its political lyrics it was soon associated with revolutionary movements, the Latin American New Left, Liberation Theology, hippie and human rights movements. It would gain great popularity throughout Latin America, and it is regarded as a precursor to Rock en español.

Cueca is a family of musical styles and associated dances from Chile, Bolivia and Peru.

Trova and Son are styles of traditional Cuban music originating in the province of Oriente that includes influences from Spanish song and dance, such as Bolero and contradanza as well as Afro-Cuban rhythm and percussion elements.

Moda de viola is the name designated to Brazilian folk music. It is often performed with a 6-string nylon acoustic guitar, but the most traditional instrument is the viola caipira. The songs basically detailed the difficulties of life of those who work in the country. The themes are usually associated with the land, animals, folklore, impossible love and separation. Although there are some upbeat songs, most of them are nostalgic and melancholic.

==== North America ====

===== Canada =====

Canada&#x27;s traditional folk music is particularly diverse. Even prior to liberalizing its immigration laws in the 1960s, Canada was ethnically diverse with dozens of different Indigenous and European groups present. In terms of music, academics do not speak of a Canadian tradition, but rather ethnic traditions (Acadian music, Irish-Canadian music, Blackfoot music, Innu music, Inuit music, Métis fiddle, etc.) and later in Eastern Canada regional traditions (Newfoundland music, Cape Breton fiddling, Quebecois music, etc.)

&quot;Knowledge of the history of Canada&quot;, wrote Isabelle Mills in 1974, &quot;is essential in understanding the mosaic of Canadian folk song. Part of this mosaic is supplied by the folk songs of Canada brought by European and Anglo-Saxon settlers to the new land.&quot; She describes how the French colony at Québec brought French immigrants, followed before long by waves of immigrants from Great Britain, Germany, and other European countries, all bringing music from their homelands, some of which survives into the present day. Ethnographer and folklorist Marius Barbeau estimated that well over ten thousand French folk songs and their variants had been collected in Canada. Many of the older ones had by then died out in France.

Music as professionalized paid entertainment grew relatively slowly in Canada, especially remote rural areas, through the 19th and early 20th centuries. While in urban music clubs of the dance hall/vaudeville variety became popular, followed by jazz, rural Canada remained mostly a land of traditional music. Yet when American radio networks began broadcasting into Canada in the 1920s and 1930s, the audience for Canadian traditional music progressively declined in favour of American Nashville-style country music and urban styles like jazz. The Americanization of Canadian music led the Canadian Radio League to lobby for a national public broadcaster in the 1930s, eventually leading to the creation of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) in 1936. The CBC promoted Canadian music, including traditional music, on its radio and later television services, but the mid-century craze for all things &quot;modern&quot; led to the decline of folk music relative to rock and pop. Canada was however influenced by the folk music revival of the 1960s, when local venues such as the Montreal Folk Workshop, and other folk clubs and coffee houses across the country, became crucibles for emerging songwriters and performers as well as for interchange with artists visiting from abroad.

===== United States =====

American traditional music is also called roots music. Roots music is a broad category of music including bluegrass, country music, gospel, old time music, jug bands, Appalachian folk, blues, Cajun and Native American music. The music is considered American either because it is native to the United States or because it developed there, out of foreign origins, to such a degree that it struck musicologists as something distinctly new. It is considered &quot;roots music&quot; because it served as the basis of music later developed in the United States, including rock and roll, contemporary folk music, rhythm and blues, and jazz. Some of these genres are considered to be traditional folk music.
* Cajun music, an emblematic music of Louisiana, is rooted in the ballads of the French-speaking Acadians of Canada. Cajun music is often mentioned in tandem with the Creole-based, Cajun-influenced zydeco form, both of Acadiana origin. These French Louisiana sounds have influenced American popular music for many decades, especially country music, and have influenced pop culture through mass media, such as television commercials.
* Appalachian music is the traditional music of the region of Appalachia in the Eastern United States. It derives from various European and African influences, including English ballads, Irish and Scottish traditional music (especially fiddle music), hymns, and African-American blues. First recorded in the 1920s, Appalachian musicians were a key influence on the early development of Old-time music, country music, and bluegrass, and were an important part of the American folk music revival. Instruments typically used to perform Appalachian music include the banjo, American fiddle, fretted dulcimer, and guitar. Early recorded Appalachian musicians include Fiddlin&#x27; John Carson, Henry Whitter, Bascom Lamar Lunsford, the Carter Family, Clarence Ashley, Frank Proffitt, and Dock Boggs, all of whom were initially recorded in the 1920s and 1930s. Several Appalachian musicians obtained renown during the folk revival of the 1950s and 1960s, including Jean Ritchie, Roscoe Holcomb, Ola Belle Reed, Lily May Ledford, and Doc Watson. Country and bluegrass artists such as Loretta Lynn, Roy Acuff, Dolly Parton, Earl Scruggs, Chet Atkins, and Don Reno were heavily influenced by traditional Appalachian music. Artists such as Bob Dylan, Dave Van Ronk, Jerry Garcia, and Bruce Springsteen have performed Appalachian songs or rewritten versions of Appalachian songs.
* The Carter Family was a traditional American folk music group that recorded between 1927 and 1956. Their music had a profound impact on bluegrass, country, Southern gospel, pop and rock musicians. They were the first vocal group to become country music stars; a beginning of the divergence of country music from traditional folk music. Their recordings of such songs as &quot;Wabash Cannonball&quot; (1932), &quot;Will the Circle Be Unbroken&quot; (1935), &quot;Wildwood Flower&quot; (1928), and &quot;Keep On the Sunny Side&quot; (1928) made them country standards.
* Oklahoma and southern US plains: Before recorded history American Indians in this area used songs and instrumentation; music and dance remain the core of ceremonial and social activities. &quot;Stomp dance&quot; remains at its core, a call and response form; instrumentation is provided by rattles or shackles worn on the legs of women. &quot;Other southeastern nations have their own complexes of sacred and social songs, including those for animal dances and friendship dances, and songs that accompany stickball games. Central to the music of the southern Plains Indians is the drum, which has been called the heartbeat of Plains Indian music. Most of that genre can be traced back to activities of hunting and warfare, upon which plains culture was based.&quot; The drum is central to the music of the southern plains Indians. During the reservation period, they used music to relieve boredom. Neighbors gathered, exchanged and created songs and dances; this is a part of the roots of the modern intertribal powwow. Another common instrument is the courting flute.
* African-American folk music in the area has roots in slavery and emancipation. Sacred music—a capella and instrumentally-accompanied—is at the heart of the tradition. Early spirituals framed Christian beliefs within native practices and were heavily influenced by the music and rhythms of Africa.&quot; Spirituals are prominent, and often use a call and response pattern. &quot;Gospel developed after the Civil War (1861–1865). It relied on biblical text for much of its direction, and the use of metaphors and imagery was common. Gospel is a &quot;joyful noise&quot;, sometimes accompanied by instrumentation and almost always punctuated by hand clapping, toe tapping, and body movement.&quot; &quot;Shape-note or Sacred Harp singing developed in the early 19th century as a way for itinerant singing instructors to teach church songs in rural communities. They taught using song books in which musical notations of tones were represented by geometric shapes that were designed to associate a shape with its pitch. Sacred harp singing became popular in many Oklahoma rural communities, regardless of ethnicity.&quot; Later the blues tradition developed, with roots in and parallels to sacred music. Then jazz developed, born from a &quot;blend of ragtime, gospel, and blues&quot;
* Anglo-Scots-Irish music traditions gained a place in Oklahoma after the Land Run of 1889. Because of its size and portability, the fiddle was the core of early Oklahoma Anglo music, but other instruments such as the guitar, mandolin, banjo, and steel guitar were added later. Various Oklahoma music traditions trace their roots to the British Isles, including cowboy ballads, western swing, and contemporary country and western.&quot; Mexican immigrants began to reach Oklahoma in the 1870s, bringing beautiful canciones and corridos love songs, waltzes, and ballads along with them. Like American Indian communities, each rite of passage in Hispanic communities is accompanied by traditional music. The acoustic guitar, string bass, and violin provide the basic instrumentation for Mexican music, with maracas, flute, horns, or sometimes accordion filling out the sound. Other Europeans (such as Bohemians and Germans) settled in the late 19th century. Their social activities centered on community halls, &quot;where local musicians played polkas and waltzes on the accordion, piano, and brass instruments&quot;. Later, Asians contributed to the musical mix. &quot;Ancient music and dance traditions from the temples and courts of China, India, and Indonesia are preserved in Asian communities throughout the state, and popular song genres are continually layered on to these classical music forms&quot;

== Folk music revivals ==
&quot;Folk music revival&quot; refers to either a period of renewed interest in traditional folk music, or to an event or period which transforms it; the latter usually includes a social activism component. A prominent example of the former is the British folk revival of approximately 1890–1920. The most prominent and influential example of the latter (to the extent that it is usually called &quot;&quot;the&quot; folk music revival&quot;) is the folk revival of the mid 20th century, centered in the English-speaking world which gave birth to contemporary folk music. See the &quot;Contemporary folk music&quot; article for a description of this revival.

One earlier revival influenced western classical music. Such composers as Percy Grainger, Ralph Vaughan Williams, and Béla Bartók made field recordings or transcriptions of folk singers and musicians.

In Spain, Isaac Albéniz (1860–1909) produced piano works reflect his Spanish heritage, including the &quot;Suite Iberia&quot; (1906–1909). Enrique Granados (1867–1918) composed &quot;zarzuela&quot;, Spanish light opera, and &quot;Danzas Españolas&quot; – Spanish Dances. Manuel de Falla (1876–1946) became interested in the cante jondo of Andalusian flamenco, the influence of which can be strongly felt in many of his works, which include &quot;Nights in the Gardens of Spain&quot; and &quot;Siete canciones populares españolas&quot; (&quot;Seven Spanish Folksongs&quot;, for voice and piano). Composers such as Fernando Sor and Francisco Tarrega established the guitar as Spain&#x27;s national instrument. Modern Spanish folk artists abound (Mil i Maria, Russian Red, et al.) modernizing while respecting the traditions of their forebears.

Flamenco grew in popularity through the 20th century, as did northern styles such as the Celtic music of Galicia. French classical composers, from Bizet to Ravel, also drew upon Spanish themes, and distinctive Spanish genres became universally recognized.

Folk music revivals or roots revivals also encompass a range of phenomena around the world where there is a renewed interest in traditional music. This is often by the young, often in the traditional music of their own country, and often included new incorporation of social awareness, causes, and evolutions of new music in the same style. , a similar evolution of a new form of socially committed music occurred in several Spanish-speaking countries.

== Festivals ==
===United States===
It is sometimes claimed that the earliest United States folk music festival was the Mountain Dance and Folk Festival, 1928, in Asheville, North Carolina, founded by Bascom Lamar Lunsford. The National Folk Festival (USA) is an itinerant folk festival in the United States. Since 1934, it has been run by the National Council for the Traditional Arts (NCTA) and has been presented in 26 communities around the nation. After leaving some of these communities, the National Folk Festival has spun off several locally run folk festivals in its wake including the Lowell Folk Festival, the Richmond Folk Festival, the American Folk Festival and, most recently, the Montana Folk Festival.

The Newport Folk Festival is an annual folk festival held near Newport, Rhode Island. It ran most years from 1959 to 1970 and from 1985 to the present, with an attendance of approximately 10,000 people each year.

The four-day Philadelphia Folk Festival began in 1962. It is sponsored by the non-profit Philadelphia Folksong Society. The event hosts contemporary and traditional artists in genres including World/Fusion, Celtic, Singer-Songwriter, Folk Rock, Country, Klezmer, and Dance. It is held annually on the third weekend in August. The event now hosts approximately 12,000 visitors, presenting bands on 6 stages.

The Feast of the Hunters&#x27; Moon in Indiana draws approximately 60,000 visitors per year.

===United Kingdom===
Sidmouth Festival began in 1954, and Cambridge Folk Festival began in 1965. The Cambridge Folk Festival in Cambridge, England is noted for having a very wide definition of who can be invited as folk musicians. The &quot;club tents&quot; allow attendees to discover large numbers of unknown artists, who, for ten or 15 minutes each, present their work to the festival audience.

===Australia===
The National Folk Festival is Australia&#x27;s premier folk festival event and is attended by over 50,000 people. The Woodford Folk Festival and Port Fairy Folk Festival are similarly amongst Australia&#x27;s largest major annual events, attracting top international folk performers as well as many local artists.

===Canada===
Stan Rogers is a lasting fixture of the Canadian folk festival Summerfolk, held annually in Owen Sound, Ontario, where the main stage and amphitheater are dedicated as the &quot;Stan Rogers Memorial Canopy&quot;. The festival is firmly fixed in tradition, with Rogers&#x27; song &quot;The Mary Ellen Carter&quot; being sung by all involved, including the audience and a medley of acts at the festival. The Canmore Folk Music Festival is Alberta&#x27;s longest running folk music festival.

There are multitudes of folk festivals across Canada. Canso, Nova Scotia, has hosted the Stan Rogers Folk Festival the last weekend of July each year since 1997. The town of Wolfville hosts the Deep Roots Music Festival in September of each year. The Celtic Colours Celtic music festival is held each fall around the time that tree leaves are changing their colours, on Cape Breton Island, with venues across the island. Lunenburg, Nova Scotia has hosted the Lunenburg Folk Harbour Festival since 1986.

===Other===
Urkult Näsåker, Ångermanland held August each year is purportedly Sweden&#x27;s largest world-music festival.

<text>A fullerene is an allotrope of carbon whose molecules consist of carbon atoms connected by single and double bonds so as to form a closed or partially closed mesh, with fused rings of five to six atoms. The molecules may have hollow sphere- and ellipsoid-like forms, tubes, or other shapes.

Fullerenes with a closed mesh topology are informally denoted by their empirical formula C&quot;n&quot;, often written C&quot;n&quot;, where &quot;n&quot; is the number of carbon atoms. However, for some values of &quot;n&quot; there may be more than one isomer.

The family is named after buckminsterfullerene (C60), the most famous member, which in turn is named after Buckminster Fuller. The closed fullerenes, especially C60, are also informally called buckyballs for their resemblance to the standard ball of association football (&quot;soccer&quot;). Nested closed fullerenes have been named bucky onions. Cylindrical fullerenes are also called carbon nanotubes or buckytubes. The bulk solid form of pure or mixed fullerenes is called fullerite.

Fullerenes had been predicted for some time, but only after their accidental synthesis in 1985 were they detected in nature and outer space. The discovery of fullerenes greatly expanded the number of known allotropes of carbon, which had previously been limited to graphite, diamond, and amorphous carbon such as soot and charcoal. They have been the subject of intense research, both for their chemistry and for their technological applications, especially in materials science, electronics, and nanotechnology.

==Definition==
IUPAC defines fullerenes as &quot;polyhedral closed cages made up entirely of n three-coordinate carbon atoms and having 12 pentagonal and (n/2-10) hexagonal faces, where n ≥ 20.&quot;

==History==
===Predictions and limited observations===
The icosahedral cage was mentioned in 1965 as a possible topological structure. Eiji Osawa predicted the existence of in 1970. He noticed that the structure of a corannulene molecule was a subset of the shape of a football, and hypothesised that a full ball shape could also exist. Japanese scientific journals reported his idea, but neither it nor any translations of it reached Europe or the Americas.

Also in 1970, R.W.Henson (then of the UK Atomic Energy Research Establishment) proposed the structure and made a model of it. Unfortunately, the evidence for that new form of carbon was very weak at the time, so the proposal was met with skepticism, and was never published. It was acknowledged only in 1999.

In 1973, independently from Henson, D. A. Bochvar and E. G. Galpern made a quantum-chemical analysis of the stability of and calculated its electronic structure. The paper was published in 1973, but the scientific community did not give much importance to this theoretical prediction.

Around 1980, Sumio Iijima identified the molecule of from an electron microscope image of carbon black, where it formed the core of a particle with the structure of a &quot;bucky onion&quot;.

Also in the 1980s at MIT, Mildred Dresselhaus and Morinobu Endo, collaborating with T. Venkatesan, directed studies blasting graphite with lasers, producing carbon clusters of atoms, which would be later identified as &quot;fullerenes.&quot;

===Discovery of ===
In 1985, Harold Kroto of the University of Sussex, working with James R. Heath, Sean O&#x27;Brien, Robert Curl and Richard Smalley from Rice University, discovered fullerenes in the sooty residue created by vaporising carbon in a helium atmosphere. In the mass spectrum of the product, discrete peaks appeared corresponding to molecules with the exact mass of sixty or seventy or more carbon atoms, namely and . The team identified their structure as the now familiar &quot;buckyballs&quot;.

The name &quot;buckminsterfullerene&quot; was eventually chosen for by the discoverers as an homage to American architect Buckminster Fuller for the vague similarity of the structure to the geodesic domes which he popularized; which, if they were extended to a full sphere, would also have the icosahedral symmetry group. The &quot;ene&quot; ending was chosen to indicate that the carbons are unsaturated, being connected to only three other atoms instead of the normal four. The shortened name &quot;fullerene&quot; eventually came to be applied to the whole family.

Kroto, Curl, and Smalley were awarded the 1996 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for their roles in the discovery of this class of molecules.

===Further developments===
Kroto and the Rice team already discovered other fullerenes besides C60, and the list was much expanded in the following years. Carbon nanotubes were first discovered and synthesized in 1991.

After their discovery, minute quantities of fullerenes were found to be produced in sooty flames, and by lightning discharges in the atmosphere. In 1992, fullerenes were found in a family of mineraloids known as shungites in Karelia, Russia.

The production techniques were improved by many scientists, including Donald Huffman, Wolfgang Krätschmer, Lowell D. Lamb, and Konstantinos Fostiropoulos. Thanks to their efforts, by 1990 it was relatively easy to produce gram-sized samples of fullerene powder. Fullerene purification remains a challenge to chemists and to a large extent determines fullerene prices.

In 2010, the spectral signatures of C60 and C70 were observed by NASA&#x27;s Spitzer infrared telescope in a cloud of cosmic dust surrounding a star 6500 light years away. Kroto commented: &quot;This most exciting breakthrough provides convincing evidence that the buckyball has, as I long suspected, existed since time immemorial in the dark recesses of our galaxy.&quot; According to astronomer Letizia Stanghellini, &quot;It’s possible that buckyballs from outer space provided seeds for life on Earth.&quot; In 2019, ionized C60 molecules were detected with the Hubble Space Telescope in the space between those stars.

==Types==
There are two major families of fullerenes, with fairly distinct properties and applications: the closed buckyballs and the open-ended cylindrical carbon nanotubes. However, hybrid structures exist between those two classes, such as carbon nanobuds — nanotubes capped by meshes or larger &quot;buckybuds&quot;.

===Buckyballs===

====Buckminsterfullerene====

Buckminsterfullerene is the smallest fullerene molecule containing pentagonal and hexagonal rings in which no two pentagons share an edge (which can be destabilizing, as in pentalene). It is also most common in terms of natural occurrence, as it can often be found in soot.

The empirical formula of buckminsterfullerene is and its structure is a truncated icosahedron, which resembles an association football ball of the type made of twenty hexagons and twelve pentagons, with a carbon atom at the vertices of each polygon and a bond along each polygon edge.

The van der Waals diameter of a buckminsterfullerene molecule is about 1.1 nanometers (nm). The nucleus to nucleus diameter of a buckminsterfullerene molecule is about 0.71 nm.

The buckminsterfullerene molecule has two bond lengths. The 6:6 ring bonds (between two hexagons) can be considered &quot;double bonds&quot; and are shorter (1.401 Å) than the 6:5 bonds (1.458 Å, between a hexagon and a pentagon). The weighted average bond length is 1.44 Å.

====Other fullerenes====

Another fairly common fullerene has empirical formula , but fullerenes with 72, 76, 84 and even up to 100 carbon atoms are commonly obtained.

The smallest possible fullerene is the dodecahedral . There are no fullerenes with 22 vertices. The number of different fullerenes C2n grows with increasing &quot;n&quot; = 12, 13, 14, ..., roughly in proportion to &quot;n&quot;9 . For instance, there are 1812 non-isomorphic fullerenes . Note that only one form of , buckminsterfullerene, has no pair of adjacent pentagons (the smallest such fullerene). To further illustrate the growth, there are 214,127,713 non-isomorphic fullerenes , 15,655,672 of which have no adjacent pentagons. Optimized structures of many fullerene isomers are published and listed on the web.

Heterofullerenes have heteroatoms substituting carbons in cage or tube-shaped structures. They were discovered in 1993 and greatly expand the overall fullerene class of compounds and can have dangling bonds on their surfaces. Notable examples include boron, nitrogen (azafullerene), oxygen, and phosphorus derivatives.

===Carbon nanotubes===

Carbon nanotubes are cylindrical fullerenes. These tubes of carbon are usually only a few nanometres wide, but they can range from less than a micrometer to several millimeters in length. They often have closed ends, but can be open-ended as well. There are also cases in which the tube reduces in diameter before closing off. Their unique molecular structure results in extraordinary macroscopic properties, including high tensile strength, high electrical conductivity, high ductility, high heat conductivity, and relative chemical inactivity (as it is cylindrical and &quot;planar&quot; — that is, it has no &quot;exposed&quot; atoms that can be easily displaced). One proposed use of carbon nanotubes is in paper batteries, developed in 2007 by researchers at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. Another highly speculative proposed use in the field of space technologies is to produce high-tensile carbon cables required by a space elevator.

==Derivatives==
Buckyballs and carbon nanotubes have been used as building blocks for a great variety of derivatives and larger structures, such as
*Nested buckyballs (&quot;carbon nano-onions&quot; or &quot;buckyonions&quot;) proposed for lubricants;
*Nested carbon nanotubes (&quot;carbon megatubes&quot;)
*Linked &quot;ball-and-chain&quot; dimers (two buckyballs linked by a carbon chain)
*Rings of buckyballs linked together.

==Heterofullerenes and non-carbon fullerenes==
After the discovery of C60, many fullerenes have been synthesized (or studied theoretically by molecular modeling methods) in which some or all the carbon atoms are replaced by other elements. Non-carbon nanotubes, in particular, have attracted much attention.

===Boron===
A type of buckyball which uses boron atoms, instead of the usual carbon, was predicted and described in 2007. The structure, with each atom forming 5 or 6 bonds, was predicted to be more stable than the buckyball. However, subsequent analysis found that the predicted Ih symmetric structure was vibrationally unstable and the resulting cage would undergo a spontaneous symmetry break, yielding a puckered cage with rare Th symmetry (symmetry of a volleyball). The number of six-member rings in this molecule is 20 and number of five-member rings is 12. There is an additional atom in the center of each six-member ring, bonded to each atom surrounding it. By employing a systematic global search algorithm, it was later found that the previously proposed fullerene is not a global maximum for 80-atom boron clusters and hence can not be found in nature; the most stable configurations have complex geometries. The same paper concluded that boron&#x27;s energy landscape, unlike others, has many disordered low-energy structures, hence pure boron fullerenes are unlikely to exist in nature.

However, an irregular complex dubbed borospherene was prepared in 2014. This complex has two hexagonal faces and four heptagonal faces with in D2d symmetry interleaved with a network of 48 triangles.

 was experimentally obtained in 2024, i.e. 17 years after theoretical prediction by Gonzalez Szwacki &quot;et al.&quot;.

===Other elements===
Inorganic (carbon-free) fullerene-type structures have been built with the molybdenum(IV) sulfide (MoS2), long used as a graphite-like lubricant, tungsten (WS2), titanium (TiS2) and niobium (NbS2). These materials were found to be stable up to at least 350 tons/cm2 (34.3 GPa).

Icosahedral or distorted-icosahedral fullerene-like complexes have also been prepared for germanium, tin, and lead; some of these complexes are spacious enough to hold most transition metal atoms.
==Main fullerenes==
Below is a table of main closed carbon fullerenes synthesized and characterized so far, with their CAS number when known. Fullerenes with fewer than 60 carbon atoms have been called &quot;lower fullerenes&quot;, and those with more than 70 atoms &quot;higher fullerenes&quot;.
In the table, &quot;Num.Isom.&quot; is the number of possible isomers within the &quot;isolated pentagon rule&quot;, which states that two pentagons in a fullerene should not share edges. &quot;Mol.Symm.&quot; is the symmetry of the molecule, whereas &quot;Cryst.Symm.&quot; is that of the crystalline framework in the solid state. Both are specified for the most experimentally abundant form(s). The asterisk * marks symmetries with more than one chiral form.

When or crystals are grown from toluene solution they have a monoclinic symmetry. The crystal structure contains toluene molecules packed between the spheres of the fullerene. However, evaporation of the solvent from transforms it into a face-centered cubic form. Both monoclinic and face-centered cubic (fcc) phases are known for better-characterized  and  fullerenes.

==Properties==

===Topology===
Schlegel diagrams are often used to clarify the 3D structure of closed-shell fullerenes, as 2D projections are often not ideal in this sense.

In mathematical terms, the combinatorial topology (that is, the carbon atoms and the bonds between them, ignoring their positions and distances) of a closed-shell fullerene with a simple sphere-like mean surface (orientable, genus zero) can be represented as a convex polyhedron; more precisely, its one-dimensional skeleton, consisting of its vertices and edges. The Schlegel diagram is a projection of that skeleton onto one of the faces of the polyhedron, through a point just outside that face; so that all other vertices project inside that face.

The Schlegel diagram of a closed fullerene is a graph that is planar and 3-regular (or &quot;cubic&quot;; meaning that all vertices have degree 3).

A closed fullerene with sphere-like shell must have at least some cycles that are pentagons or heptagons. More precisely, if all the faces have 5 or 6 sides, it follows from Euler&#x27;s polyhedron formula, &quot;V&quot;−&quot;E&quot;+&quot;F&quot;=2 (where &quot;V&quot;, &quot;E&quot;, &quot;F&quot; are the numbers of vertices, edges, and faces), that &quot;V&quot; must be even, and that there must be exactly 12 pentagons and &quot;V&quot;/2−10 hexagons. Similar constraints exist if the fullerene has heptagonal (seven-atom) cycles.

===Bonding===
Since each carbon atom is connected to only three neighbors, instead of the usual four, it is customary to describe those bonds as being a mixture of single and double covalent bonds. The hybridization of carbon in C60 has been reported to be sp2.01. The bonding state can be analyzed by Raman spectroscopy, IR spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy.

===Encapsulation===
Additional atoms, ions, clusters, or small molecules can be trapped inside fullerenes to form inclusion compounds known as endohedral fullerenes. An unusual example is the egg-shaped fullerene Tb3N@, which violates the isolated pentagon rule. Evidence for a meteor impact at the end of the Permian period was found by analyzing noble gases preserved by being trapped in fullerenes.

===Research===
In the field of nanotechnology, heat resistance and superconductivity are some of the more heavily studied properties.

There are many calculations that have been done using ab-initio quantum methods applied to fullerenes. By DFT and TD-DFT methods one can obtain IR, Raman and UV spectra. Results of such calculations can be compared with experimental results.

Fullerene is an unusual reactant in many organic reactions such as the Bingel reaction discovered in 1993.

===Aromaticity===
Researchers have been able to increase the reactivity of fullerenes by attaching active groups to their surfaces. Buckminsterfullerene does not exhibit &quot;superaromaticity&quot;: that is, the electrons in the hexagonal rings do not delocalize over the whole molecule.

A spherical fullerene of &quot;n&quot; carbon atoms has &quot;n&quot; pi-bonding electrons, free to delocalize. These should try to delocalize over the whole molecule. The quantum mechanics of such an arrangement should be like only one shell of the well-known quantum mechanical structure of a single atom, with a stable filled shell for &quot;n&quot; = 2, 8, 18, 32, 50, 72, 98, 128, etc. (i.e., twice a perfect square number), but this series does not include 60. This 2(&quot;N&quot; + 1)2 rule (with &quot;N&quot; integer) for spherical aromaticity is the three-dimensional analogue of Hückel&#x27;s rule. The 10+ cation would satisfy this rule, and should be aromatic. This has been shown to be the case using quantum chemical modelling, which showed the existence of strong diamagnetic sphere currents in the cation.

As a result, in water tends to pick up two more electrons and become an anion. The &quot;n&quot; described below may be the result of trying to form a loose metallic bond.

==Reactions==

===Polymerization===
Under high pressure and temperature, buckyballs collapse to form various one-, two-, or three-dimensional carbon frameworks. Single-strand polymers are formed using the Atom Transfer Radical Addition Polymerization (ATRAP) route.

&quot;Ultrahard fullerite&quot; is a coined term frequently used to describe material produced by high-pressure high-temperature (HPHT) processing of fullerite. Such treatment converts fullerite into a nanocrystalline form of diamond which has been reported to exhibit remarkable mechanical properties.
===Chemistry===
Fullerenes are stable, but not totally unreactive. The sp2-hybridized carbon atoms, which are at their energy minimum in planar graphite, must be bent to form the closed sphere or tube, which produces angle strain. The characteristic reaction of fullerenes is electrophilic addition at 6,6-double bonds, which reduces angle strain by changing sp2-hybridized carbons into sp3-hybridized ones. The change in hybridized orbitals causes the bond angles to decrease from about 120° in the sp2 orbitals to about 109.5° in the sp3 orbitals. This decrease in bond angles allows for the bonds to bend less when closing the sphere or tube, and thus, the molecule becomes more stable.

===Solubility===

Fullerenes are soluble in many organic solvents, such as toluene, chlorobenzene, and 1,2,3-trichloropropane. Solubilities are generally rather low, such as 8 g/L for C60 in carbon disulfide. Still, fullerenes are the only known allotrope of carbon that can be dissolved in common solvents at room temperature. Among the best solvents is 1-chloronaphthalene, which will dissolve 51 g/L of C60.

Solutions of pure buckminsterfullerene have a deep purple color. Solutions of are a reddish brown. The higher fullerenes to have a variety of colors.

Millimeter-sized crystals of and , both pure and solvated, can be grown from benzene solution. Crystallization of from benzene solution below 30 °C (when solubility is maximum) yields a triclinic solid solvate ·4. Above 30 °C one obtains solvate-free fcc .

===Quantum mechanics===
In 1999, researchers from the University of Vienna demonstrated that wave-particle duality applied to molecules such as fullerene.

===Superconductivity===

Fullerenes are normally electrical insulators, but when crystallized with alkali metals, the resultant compound can be conducting or even superconducting.

===Chirality===
Some fullerenes (e.g. , , , and ) are inherently chiral because they are D2-symmetric, and have been successfully resolved. Research efforts are ongoing to develop specific sensors for their enantiomers.

===Stability===
Two theories have been proposed to describe the molecular mechanisms that make fullerenes. The older, &quot;bottom-up&quot; theory proposes that they are built atom-by-atom. The alternative &quot;top-down&quot; approach claims that fullerenes form when much larger structures break into constituent parts.

In 2013 researchers discovered that asymmetrical fullerenes formed from larger structures settle into stable fullerenes. The synthesized substance was a particular metallofullerene consisting of 84 carbon atoms with two additional carbon atoms and two yttrium atoms inside the cage. The process produced approximately 100 micrograms.

However, they found that the asymmetrical molecule could theoretically collapse to form nearly every known fullerene and metallofullerene. Minor perturbations involving the breaking of a few molecular bonds cause the cage to become highly symmetrical and stable. This insight supports the theory that fullerenes can be formed from graphene when the appropriate molecular bonds are severed.

==Systematic naming==
According to the IUPAC, to name a fullerene, one must cite the number of member atoms for the rings which comprise the fullerene, its symmetry point group in the Schoenflies notation, and the total number of atoms. For example, buckminsterfullerene C60 is systematically named (-&quot;I&quot;h)[5,6]fullerene. The name of the point group should be retained in any derivative of said fullerene, even if that symmetry is lost by the derivation.

To indicate the position of substituted or attached elements, the fullerene atoms are usually numbered in a spiral path, usually starting with the ring on one of the main axes. If the structure of the fullerene does not allow such numbering, another starting atom was chosen to still achieve a spiral path sequence.

The latter is the case for C70, which is (-&quot;D&quot;5h(6))[5,6]fullerene in IUPAC notation. The symmetry &quot;D&quot;5h(6) means that this is the isomer where the &quot;C&quot;5 axis goes through a pentagon surrounded by hexagons rather than pentagons.

In IUPAC&#x27;s nomenclature, fully saturated analogues of fullerenes are called &quot;fulleranes&quot;. If the mesh has other element(s) substituted for one or more carbons, the compound is named a &quot;heterofullerene&quot;. If a double bond is replaced by a methylene bridge , the resulting structure is a &quot;homofullerene&quot;. If an atom is fully deleted and missing valences saturated with hydrogen atoms, it is a &quot;norfullerene&quot;. When bonds are removed (both sigma and pi), the compound becomes &quot;secofullerene&quot;; if some new bonds are added in an unconventional order, it is a &quot;cyclofullerene&quot;.

==Production==
Fullerene production generally starts by producing fullerene-rich soot. The original (and still current) method was to send a large electric current between two nearby graphite electrodes in an inert atmosphere. The resulting electric arc vaporizes the carbon into a plasma that then cools into sooty residue. Alternatively, soot is produced by laser ablation of graphite or pyrolysis of aromatic hydrocarbons. Combustion of benzene is the most efficient process, developed at MIT.

These processes yield a mixture of various fullerenes and other forms of carbon. The fullerenes are then extracted from the soot using appropriate organic solvents and separated by chromatography. One can obtain milligram quantities of fullerenes with 80 atoms or more. C76, C78 and C84 are available commercially.

==Applications==

===Biomedical===
Functionalized fullerenes have been researched extensively for several potential biomedical applications including high-performance MRI contrast agents, X-ray imaging contrast agents, photodynamic therapy for tumor treatment, and drug and gene delivery.

==Safety and toxicity==

In 2013, a comprehensive review on the toxicity of fullerene was published reviewing work beginning in the early 1990s to present and concluded that very little evidence gathered since the discovery of fullerenes indicate that is toxic. The toxicity of these carbon nanoparticles is not only dose- and time-dependent, but also depends on a number of other factors such as:

* type (e.g.: , , M@, M@)
* functional groups used to water-solubilize these nanoparticles (e.g.: OH, COOH)
* method of administration (e.g.: intravenous, intraperitoneal)

It was recommended to assess the pharmacology of every new fullerene- or metallofullerene-based complex individually as a different compound.

==Popular culture==
Examples of fullerenes appear frequently in popular culture. Fullerenes appeared in fiction well before scientists took serious interest in them. In a humorously speculative 1966 column for &quot;New Scientist&quot;, David Jones suggested the possibility of making giant hollow carbon molecules by distorting a plane hexagonal net with the addition of impurity atoms.

<doc id="10632" wikidata="Q5432186" url="?curid=10632" title="Fallacies of definition">
<text>Fallacies of definition are the various ways in which definitions can fail to explain terms. The phrase is used to suggest an analogy with an informal fallacy. Definitions may fail to have merit, because they are overly broad, overly narrow, or incomprehensible; or they use obscure or ambiguous language, contain mutually exclusive parts, or (perhaps most commonly) are circular.

== Circularity ==
If one concept is defined by another, and the other is defined by the first, this is known as a circular definition, akin to circular reasoning: neither offers enlightenment about what one wanted to know. &quot;It is a fallacy because by using a synonym in the &quot;definiens&quot; the reader is told nothing significantly new.&quot;

A straightforward example would be to define &quot;Jew&quot; as &quot;a person believing in Judaism&quot;, and &quot;Judaism&quot; as &quot;the religion of the Jewish people&quot;, which would make &quot;Judaism&quot; &quot;the religion of the people believing in Judaism&quot;.

== Incongruity: overly broad or narrow ==
A definition intended to describe a given set of individuals fails if its description of matching individuals is incongruous: too broad (excessively loose with parameters) or too narrow (excessively strict with parameters). For example, &quot;a shape with four sides of equal length&quot; is not a sufficient definition for &quot;square&quot;, because squares are not the only shapes that can have four sides of equal length; rhombi do as well. Likewise, defining &quot;rectangle&quot; as &quot;a shape with four perpendicular sides of equal length&quot; is inappropriate because it is too narrow, as it describes only squares while excluding all other kinds of rectangles, thus being a plainly incorrect definition.

If a cow were defined as an animal with horns, this would be overly broad (including goats, for example), while if a cow were defined as a black-and-white quadruped, this would be both overly narrow (excluding: all-black, all-white, all-brown and white-brown cows, for example) and overly broad (including Dalmatians, for example).

== Obscurity ==
Definitions can go wrong by using ambiguous, obscure, or figurative language. This can lead to circular definitions. Definitions should be defined in the most prosaic form of language to be understood, as failure to elucidate provides fallacious definitions. Figurative language can also be misinterpreted. For example, &quot;golden eyes&quot; in a biography may lead the reader to think that the person was fictional.

An example of obscurity is Samuel Johnson&#x27;s definition for oats: &quot;A grain, which in England is generally given to horses, but in Scotland supports the people.&quot; The thing defined (oats) should be pointed out rather than remain obscure.

==Mutual exclusivity==
The definition completely excludes what is being defined. For example, a cow might be defined as a flying animal with no legs. In reality a cow has legs and cannot fly, but this example claims to define a cow using a definition that is opposite to what a cow actually is. &quot;Cow&quot; and &quot;flying animal with no legs&quot; are mutually exclusive to each other: they cannot refer to the same thing.

== Self-contradictory requirements ==

Definitions may fail by imposing conflicting requirements, making it impossible for them to apply to anything at all. For example, a cow being defined as a legless quadruped. These requirements may also be &quot;mutually exclusive&quot;.

== Definist fallacy ==
The definist fallacy is a logical fallacy, coined by William Frankena in 1939, that involves the definition of one property in terms of another.

<doc id="10633" wikidata="Q2138" url="?curid=10633" title="Fredericton">
<text>Fredericton (; ) is the capital city of the Canadian province of New Brunswick. The city is situated in the west-central portion of the province along the Saint John River, also known by its Indigenous name of Wolastoq, which flows west to east as it bisects the city. The river is the dominant natural feature of the area. One of the main urban centres in New Brunswick, the city had a population of 63,116 and a metropolitan population of 108,610 in the 2021 Canadian census. It is the third-largest city in the province after Moncton and Saint John.

On 1 January 2023, Fredericton annexed parts of five local service districts; revised census figures have not been released.

An important cultural, artistic, and educational centre for the province, Fredericton is home to two universities, The University of New Brunswick and St. Thomas University, the New Brunswick College of Craft and Design, New Brunswick Community College and cultural institutions such as the Beaverbrook Art Gallery, the Fredericton Region Museum, and The Playhouse, a performing arts venue. The city hosts the annual Harvest Jazz &amp; Blues Festival, attracting regional and international jazz, blues, rock, and world artists. The city also hosts the Garrison Night Market through the summer months which showcases many local vendors and artists and musicians. Fredericton is also an important and vibrant centre point for the region&#x27;s top visual artists; many of New Brunswick&#x27;s notable artists live and work there today. Fredericton has also been home to some great historical Canadian painters as well, including Goodridge Roberts, and Molly and Bruno Bobak.

As a provincial capital, its economy is tied to the public sector; however, the city also contains a growing IT and commercial sector. The city has the highest percentage of residents with post-secondary education in the province and the highest per capita income of any city in New Brunswick.

==History==

There is archaeological evidence of a camp in the area 12,000 years ago, and the Wolastoqiyik farmed several kilometres upriver.

Colonists from the Kingdom of France in the late 1600s built Fort Nashwaak on the north side of the Saint John River, as the capital of Acadia. It withstood a British attack in 1696, but the capital was later moved to Port Royal (Annapolis Royal). In 1713, Acadians escaping the British takeover of Nova Scotia settled the site, naming it Pointe Ste-Anne. It was destroyed in 1758 when the population of about 83 were exiled during the expulsion of the Acadians.

It was in 1783, when United Empire Loyalists arrived from New England, that the history of modern Fredericton began. The following year, New Brunswick was partitioned from Nova Scotia and became its own colony. Pointe-Ste-Anne was renamed &quot;Fredericstown&quot;, after Frederick, second son of King George III. It became the capital of the new colony, being considered to have a better defensive position than larger Saint John.

The streets were laid out in the typical grid pattern of the time, with the names reflecting loyalist tendencies: Charlotte, Brunswick, George, King, and Queen.

In 1785, it became the shire town of York County. In 1790 the New Brunswick Legislative Building was constructed. As a centre of government, it attracted educational institutions, with King&#x27;s College (now the University of New Brunswick) being the first English-language university in Canada, and religious institutions, with Christ Church Cathedral being built as the seat of the Anglican Diocese of Fredericton in 1853.

It was a British garrison town from 1784 to 1869, and the military compound is preserved as a National Historic Site of Canada.

With the New Brunswick Equal Opportunity program in the 1960s, county councils were abolished, and government services were centralized provincially in Fredericton, increasing jobs and population.

==Geography==

The Saint John River runs through Fredericton. The city&#x27;s downtown core lies on the flat low-lying ground on either side of the river, with most of the city&#x27;s post-war suburban development occurring on the gently sloping hills of the river valley.

At an altitude of about above sea level, Fredericton is nestled in the Pennsylvanian Basin. It differs markedly from the geologically older parts of the province. There are prominently two distinct areas in the region that are divided around the area of Wilsey Road, in the east end of the city. In the west side, the bedrock underneath the earth is topographically dominant, whereas the other is controlled by Pleistocene and recent deposits leading to the rivers (resulting in the area being shallow and wide). Fredericton and its surroundings are rich in water resources, which, coupled with highly arable soil, make the Fredericton region ideal for agriculture. The Saint John River and one of its major tributaries, the Nashwaak River, come together in Fredericton. The uninhabited parts of the city are heavily forested.

=== Climate ===
Fredericton has a warm-summer humid continental climate (&quot;Dfb&quot; under the Köppen climate classification system), with short, warm summers and long, cold winters. The city has high humidity and precipitation year-round; on average, Fredericton receives approximately of precipitation per year.

==Demographics==

In the 2021 Canadian census conducted by Statistics Canada, Fredericton had a population of 63,116 living in 28,478 of its 29,892 total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

At the census metropolitan area (CMA) level in the 2021 census, the Fredericton CMA had a population of 108,610 living in 46,357 of its 48,761 total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of 102,690. With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

The 2021 census reported that immigrants (individuals born outside Canada) comprise 7,790 persons or 12.6% of the total population of Fredericton. Of the total immigrant population, the top countries of origin were United Kingdom (765 persons or 9.8%), China (645 persons or 8.3%), United States of America (570 persons or 7.3%), Syria (505 persons or 6.5%), Philippines (500 persons or 6.4%), India (460 persons or 5.9%), Egypt (300 persons or 3.9%), Iran (245 persons or 3.1%), Lebanon (205 persons or 2.6%), and Democratic Republic of the Congo (180 persons or 2.3%).

=== Ethnicity ===
In 2021, Fredericton was 82.5% white/European, 3.5% Indigenous and 14.0% visible minorities. The largest visible minority groups were Black (2.9%), South Asian (2.9%), Arab (2.5%), Chinese (1.8%) and Filipino (1.0%).

Fredericton accepted the highest number of refugees from the Syrian Civil War per capita of any Canadian city.


=== Language ===
English is spoken as a mother tongue by 80.2% of residents. Other mother tongues spoken are French (6.1%), Arabic (2.1%), Chinese languages (1.4%), Spanish (0.7%), Russian (0.6%), and Persian languages (0.5%). 1.4% of the population listed both English and French as mother tongues.

=== Religion ===
According to the 2021 census, religious groups in Fredericton included:
*Christianity (32,295 persons or 52.2%)
*Irreligion (25,150 persons or 40.7%)
*Islam (2,305 persons or 3.7%)
*Hinduism (820 persons or 1.3%)
*Buddhism (225 persons or 0.4%)
*Sikhism (190 persons or 0.3%)
*Judaism (160 persons or 0.3%)
*Indigenous Spirituality (15 persons or &lt;0.1%)
*Other (670 persons or 1.1%)

Those who declare a religion are predominantly Protestant. Fredericton has a synagogue, a mosque, a Hindu temple, a Unitarian fellowship, and a Shambhala Buddhist meditation centre.
==Economy==
The Government of New Brunswick and the universities are the primary employers. The policies of centralizing provincial government functions during the 1960s led to an expansion of the population.

The 1960s also saw an expansion of the University of New Brunswick due to increased post-war university enrolment, as well as the construction of Saint Thomas University. The Law School, now the University of New Brunswick Faculty of Law moved from Saint John to the Fredericton area.

The city has been investing actively in IT infrastructure. The City of Fredericton won the &quot;Judges Innovation Award&quot; at the 2004 Canadian Information Productivity Awards due to their &quot;Fred-eZone&quot; free municipality wide Wi-Fi initiative. This and other innovations by the city&#x27;s utelco, e-Novations, led Intel to do a case study on their successes. Fred-eZone spans much of the city&#x27;s downtown and parts of surrounding residential areas, as well as peripheral commercial areas such as Fredericton&#x27;s Regent Mall.

The statue depicts a nude Cherub and is a beloved fixture of downtown Fredericton. The famed statue has had some trouble since its historic arrival in 1885.

<text>Free software, libre software, libreware sometimes known as freedom-respecting software is computer software distributed under terms that allow users to run the software for any purpose as well as to study, change, and distribute it and any adapted versions. Free software is a matter of liberty, not price; all users are legally free to do what they want with their copies of a free software (including profiting from them) regardless of how much is paid to obtain the program. Computer programs are deemed &quot;free&quot; if they give end-users (not just the developer) ultimate control over the software and, subsequently, over their devices.

The right to study and modify a computer program entails that the source code—the preferred format for making changes—be made available to users of that program. While this is often called &quot;access to source code&quot; or &quot;public availability&quot;, the Free Software Foundation (FSF) recommends against thinking in those terms, because it might give the impression that users have an obligation (as opposed to a right) to give non-users a copy of the program.

Although the term &quot;free software&quot; had already been used loosely in the past and other permissive software like the Berkeley Software Distribution released in 1978 existed, Richard Stallman is credited with tying it to the sense under discussion and starting the free software movement in 1983, when he launched the GNU Project: a collaborative effort to create a freedom-respecting operating system, and to revive the spirit of cooperation once prevalent among hackers during the early days of computing.

== Context ==

Free software differs from:
* proprietary software, such as Microsoft Office, Windows, Adobe Photoshop, Facebook or FaceTime. Users cannot study, change, and share their source code.
* freeware or gratis software, which is a category of proprietary software that does not require payment for basic use.

For software under the purview of copyright to be free, it must carry a software license whereby the author grants users the aforementioned rights. Software that is not covered by copyright law, such as software in the public domain, is free as long as the source code is also in the public domain, or otherwise available without restrictions.

Proprietary software uses restrictive software licences or EULAs and usually does not provide users with the source code. Users are thus legally or technically prevented from changing the software, and this results in reliance on the publisher to provide updates, help, and support. (&quot;See also vendor lock-in and abandonware&quot;). Users often may not reverse engineer, modify, or redistribute proprietary software. Beyond copyright law, contracts and a lack of source code, there can exist additional obstacles keeping users from exercising freedom over a piece of software, such as software patents and digital rights management (more specifically, tivoization).

Free software can be a for-profit, commercial activity or not. Some free software is developed by volunteer computer programmers while other is developed by corporations; or even by both.

=== Naming and differences with open source ===
Although both definitions refer to almost equivalent corpora of programs, the Free Software Foundation recommends using the term &quot;free software&quot; rather than &quot;open-source software&quot; (an alternative, yet similar, concept coined in 1998), because the goals and messaging are quite dissimilar. According to the Free Software Foundation, &quot;Open source&quot; and its associated campaign mostly focus on the technicalities of the public development model and marketing free software to businesses, while taking the ethical issue of user rights very lightly or even antagonistically. Stallman has also stated that considering the practical advantages of free software is like considering the practical advantages of not being handcuffed, in that it is not necessary for an individual to consider practical reasons in order to realize that being handcuffed is undesirable in itself.

The FSF also notes that &quot;Open Source&quot; has exactly one specific meaning in common English, namely that &quot;you can look at the source code.&quot; It states that while the term &quot;Free Software&quot; can lead to two different interpretations, at least one of them is consistent with the intended meaning unlike the term &quot;Open Source&quot;. The loan adjective &quot;&quot; is often used to avoid the ambiguity of the word &quot;free&quot; in the English language, and the ambiguity with the older usage of &quot;free software&quot; as public-domain software. (&quot;See Gratis versus libre.&quot;)

==Definition and the Four Essential Freedoms of Free Software==

The first formal definition of free software was published by FSF in February 1986. That definition, written by Richard Stallman, is still maintained today and states that software is free software if people who receive a copy of the software have the following four freedoms. The numbering begins with zero, not only as a spoof on the common usage of zero-based numbering in programming languages, but also because &quot;Freedom 0&quot; was not initially included in the list, but later added first in the list as it was considered very important.
* Freedom 0: The freedom to use the program for any purpose.
* Freedom 1: The freedom to study how the program works, and change it to make it do what you wish.
* Freedom 2: The freedom to redistribute and make copies so you can help your neighbor.
* Freedom 3: The freedom to improve the program, and release your improvements (and modified versions in general) to the public, so that the whole community benefits.

Freedoms 1 and 3 require source code to be available because studying and modifying software without its source code can range from highly impractical to nearly impossible.

Thus, free software means that computer users have the freedom to cooperate with whom they choose, and to control the software they use. To summarize this into a remark distinguishing &quot;libre&quot; (freedom) software from &quot;gratis&quot; (zero price) software, the Free Software Foundation says: &quot;Free software is a matter of liberty, not price. To understand the concept, you should think of &#x27;free&#x27; as in &#x27;free speech&#x27;, not as in &#x27;free beer. (&quot;See Gratis versus libre.&quot;)

In the late 1990s, other groups published their own definitions that describe an almost identical set of software. The most notable are &quot;Debian Free Software Guidelines&quot; published in 1997, and &quot;The Open Source Definition&quot;, published in 1998.

The BSD-based operating systems, such as FreeBSD, OpenBSD, and NetBSD, do not have their own formal definitions of free software. Users of these systems generally find the same set of software to be acceptable, but sometimes see copyleft as restrictive. They generally advocate permissive free software licenses, which allow others to use the software as they wish, without being legally &quot;forced&quot; to provide the source code. Their view is that this permissive approach is more free. The Kerberos, X11, and Apache software licenses are substantially similar in intent and implementation.

== Examples ==

There are thousands of free applications and many operating systems available on the Internet. Users can easily download and install those applications via a package manager that comes included with most Linux distributions.

The Free Software Directory maintains a large database of free-software packages. Some of the best-known examples include Linux-libre, Linux-based operating systems, the GNU Compiler Collection and C library; the MySQL relational database; the Apache web server; and the Sendmail mail transport agent. Other influential examples include the Emacs text editor; the GIMP raster drawing and image editor; the X Window System graphical-display system; the LibreOffice office suite; and the TeX and LaTeX typesetting systems.

== History ==

From the 1950s up until the early 1970s, it was normal for computer users to have the &quot;software freedoms&quot; associated with free software, which was typically public-domain software. Software was commonly shared by individuals who used computers and by hardware manufacturers who welcomed the fact that people were making software that made their hardware useful. Organizations of users and suppliers, for example, SHARE, were formed to facilitate exchange of software. As software was often written in an interpreted language such as BASIC, the source code was distributed to use these programs. Software was also shared and distributed as printed source code (Type-in program) in computer magazines (like &quot;Creative Computing&quot;, &quot;SoftSide&quot;, &quot;Compute!&quot;, &quot;Byte&quot;, etc.) and books, like the bestseller &quot;BASIC Computer Games&quot;. By the early 1970s, the picture changed: software costs were dramatically increasing, a growing software industry was competing with the hardware manufacturer&#x27;s bundled software products (free in that the cost was included in the hardware cost), leased machines required software support while providing no revenue for software, and some customers able to better meet their own needs did not want the costs of &quot;free&quot; software bundled with hardware product costs. In &quot;United States vs. IBM&quot;, filed January 17, 1969, the government charged that bundled software was anti-competitive. While some software might always be free, there would henceforth be a growing amount of software produced primarily for sale. In the 1970s and early 1980s, the software industry began using technical measures (such as only distributing binary copies of computer programs) to prevent computer users from being able to study or adapt the software applications as they saw fit. In 1980, copyright law was extended to computer programs.

In 1983, Richard Stallman, one of the original authors of the popular Emacs program and a longtime member of the hacker community at the MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, announced the GNU Project, the purpose of which was to produce a completely non-proprietary Unix-compatible operating system, saying that he had become frustrated with the shift in climate surrounding the computer world and its users. In his initial declaration of the project and its purpose, he specifically cited as a motivation his opposition to being asked to agree to non-disclosure agreements and restrictive licenses which prohibited the free sharing of potentially profitable in-development software, a prohibition directly contrary to the traditional hacker ethic. Software development for the GNU operating system began in January 1984, and the Free Software Foundation (FSF) was founded in October 1985. He developed a free software definition and the concept of &quot;copyleft&quot;, designed to ensure &quot;software freedom&quot; for all.
Some non-software industries are beginning to use techniques similar to those used in free software development for their research and development process; scientists, for example, are looking towards more open development processes, and hardware such as microchips are beginning to be developed with specifications released under copyleft licenses (&quot;see the OpenCores project, for instance&quot;). Creative Commons and the free-culture movement have also been largely influenced by the free software movement.

===1980s: Foundation of the GNU Project===
In 1983, Richard Stallman, longtime member of the hacker community at the MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, announced the GNU Project, saying that he had become frustrated with the effects of the change in culture of the computer industry and its users. Software development for the GNU operating system began in January 1984, and the Free Software Foundation (FSF) was founded in October 1985. An article outlining the project and its goals was published in March 1985 titled the &quot;GNU Manifesto&quot;. The manifesto included significant explanation of the GNU philosophy, &quot;Free Software Definition&quot; and &quot;copyleft&quot; ideas.

===1990s: Release of the Linux kernel===
The Linux kernel, started by Linus Torvalds, was released as freely modifiable source code in 1991. The first licence was a proprietary software licence. However, with version 0.12 in February 1992, he relicensed the project under the GNU General Public License. Much like Unix, Torvalds&#x27; kernel attracted the attention of volunteer programmers.
FreeBSD and NetBSD (both derived from 386BSD) were released as free software when the &quot;USL v. BSDi&quot; lawsuit was settled out of court in 1993. OpenBSD forked from NetBSD in 1995. Also in 1995, The Apache HTTP Server, commonly referred to as Apache, was released under the Apache License 1.0.

== Licensing ==



All free-software licenses must grant users all the freedoms discussed above. However, unless the applications&#x27; licenses are compatible, combining programs by mixing source code or directly linking binaries is problematic, because of license technicalities. Programs indirectly connected together may avoid this problem.

The majority of free software falls under a small set of licenses. The most popular of these licenses are:
* The MIT License
* The GNU General Public License v2 (GPLv2)
* The Apache License
* The GNU General Public License v3 (GPLv3)
* The BSD License
* The GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL)
* The Mozilla Public License (MPL)
* The Eclipse Public License

The Free Software Foundation and the Open Source Initiative both publish lists of licenses that they find to comply with their own definitions of free software and open-source software respectively:
* List of FSF approved software licenses
* List of OSI approved software licenses

The FSF list is not prescriptive: free-software licenses can exist that the FSF has not heard about, or considered important enough to write about. So it is possible for a license to be free and not in the FSF list. The OSI list only lists licenses that have been submitted, considered and approved. All open-source licenses must meet the Open Source Definition in order to be officially recognized as open source software. Free software, on the other hand, is a more informal classification that does not rely on official recognition. Nevertheless, software licensed under licenses that do not meet the Free Software Definition cannot rightly be considered free software.

Apart from these two organizations, the Debian project is seen by some to provide useful advice on whether particular licenses comply with their Debian Free Software Guidelines. Debian does not publish a list of licenses, so its judgments have to be tracked by checking what software they have allowed into their software archives. That is summarized at the Debian web site.

It is rare that a license announced as being in-compliance with the FSF guidelines does not also meet the Open Source Definition, although the reverse is not necessarily true (for example, the NASA Open Source Agreement is an OSI-approved license, but non-free according to FSF).

There are different categories of free software.
* Public-domain software: the copyright has expired, the work was not copyrighted (released without copyright notice before 1988), or the author has released the software onto the public domain with a waiver statement (in countries where this is possible). Since public-domain software lacks copyright protection, it may be freely incorporated into any work, whether proprietary or free. The FSF recommends the CC0 public domain dedication for this purpose.
* Permissive licenses, also called BSD-style because they are applied to much of the software distributed with the BSD operating systems. The author retains copyright solely to disclaim warranty and require proper attribution of modified works, and permits redistribution and modification, even closed-source ones.
* Copyleft licenses, with the GNU General Public License being the most prominent: the author retains copyright and permits redistribution under the restriction that all such redistribution is licensed under the same license. Additions and modifications by others must also be licensed under the same &quot;copyleft&quot; license whenever they are distributed with part of the original licensed product. This is also known as a &quot;viral&quot;, &quot;protective&quot;, or &quot;reciprocal&quot; license.

Proponents of permissive and copyleft licenses disagree on whether software freedom should be viewed as a negative or positive liberty. Due to their restrictions on distribution, not everyone considers copyleft licenses to be free. Conversely, a permissive license may provide an incentive to create non-free software by reducing the cost of developing restricted software. Since this is incompatible with the spirit of software freedom, many people consider permissive licenses to be less free than copyleft licenses.

== Security and reliability ==

There is debate over the security of free software in comparison to proprietary software, with a major issue being security through obscurity. A popular quantitative test in computer security is to use relative counting of known unpatched security flaws. Generally, users of this method advise avoiding products that lack fixes for known security flaws, at least until a fix is available.

Free software advocates strongly believe that this methodology is biased by counting more vulnerabilities for the free software systems, since their source code is accessible and their community is more forthcoming about what problems exist as a part of full disclosure, and proprietary software systems can have undisclosed societal drawbacks, such as disenfranchising less fortunate would-be users of free programs. As users can analyse and trace the source code, many more people with no commercial constraints can inspect the code and find bugs and loopholes than a corporation would find practicable. According to Richard Stallman, user access to the source code makes deploying free software with undesirable hidden spyware functionality far more difficult than for proprietary software.

Some quantitative studies have been done on the subject.

===Binary blobs and other proprietary software===
In 2006, OpenBSD started the first campaign against the use of binary blobs in kernels. Blobs are usually freely distributable device drivers for hardware from vendors that do not reveal driver source code to users or developers. This restricts the users&#x27; freedom effectively to modify the software and distribute modified versions. Also, since the blobs are undocumented and may have bugs, they pose a security risk to any operating system whose kernel includes them. The proclaimed aim of the campaign against blobs is to collect hardware documentation that allows developers to write free software drivers for that hardware, ultimately enabling all free operating systems to become or remain blob-free.

The issue of binary blobs in the Linux kernel and other device drivers motivated some developers in Ireland to launch gNewSense, a Linux-based distribution with all the binary blobs removed. The project received support from the Free Software Foundation and stimulated the creation, headed by the Free Software Foundation Latin America, of the Linux-libre kernel. , Trisquel is the most popular FSF endorsed Linux distribution ranked by Distrowatch (over 12 months). While Debian is not endorsed by the FSF and does not use Linux-libre, it is also a popular distribution available without kernel blobs by default since 2011.

The Linux community uses the term &quot;blob&quot; to refer to all nonfree firmware in a kernel whereas OpenBSD uses the term to refer to device drivers. The FSF does not consider OpenBSD to be blob free under the Linux community&#x27;s definition of blob.

== Business model ==

Selling software under any free-software licence is permissible, as is commercial use. This is true for licenses with or without copyleft.

Since free software may be freely redistributed, it is generally available at little or no fee. Free software business models are usually based on adding value such as customization, accompanying hardware, support, training, integration, or certification. Exceptions exist however, where the user is charged to obtain a copy of the free application itself.

Fees are usually charged for distribution on compact discs and bootable USB drives, or for services of installing or maintaining the operation of free software. Development of large, commercially used free software is often funded by a combination of user donations, crowdfunding, corporate contributions, and tax money. The SELinux project at the United States National Security Agency is an example of a federally funded free-software project.

Proprietary software, on the other hand, tends to use a different business model, where a customer of the proprietary application pays a fee for a license to legally access and use it. This license may grant the customer the ability to configure some or no parts of the software themselves. Often some level of support is included in the purchase of proprietary software, but additional support services (especially for enterprise applications) are usually available for an additional fee. Some proprietary software vendors will also customize software for a fee.

The Free Software Foundation encourages selling free software. As the Foundation has written, &quot;distributing free software is an opportunity to raise funds for development. Don&#x27;t waste it!&quot;. For example, the FSF&#x27;s own recommended license (the GNU GPL) states that &quot;[you] may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.&quot;

Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer stated in 2001 that &quot;open source is not available to commercial companies. The way the license is written, if you use any open-source software, you have to make the rest of your software open source.&quot; This misunderstanding is based on a requirement of copyleft licenses (like the GPL) that if one distributes modified versions of software, they must release the source and use the same license. This requirement does not extend to other software from the same developer. The claim of incompatibility between commercial companies and free software is also a misunderstanding. There are several large companies, e.g. Red Hat and IBM (IBM acquired RedHat in 2019), which do substantial commercial business in the development of free software.

== Economic aspects and adoption ==


Free software played a significant part in the development of the Internet, the World Wide Web and the infrastructure of dot-com companies. Free software allows users to cooperate in enhancing and refining the programs they use; free software is a pure public good rather than a private good. Companies that contribute to free software increase commercial innovation.

The economic viability of free software has been recognized by large corporations such as IBM, Red Hat, and Sun Microsystems. Many companies whose core business is not in the IT sector choose free software for their Internet information and sales sites, due to the lower initial capital investment and ability to freely customize the application packages. Most companies in the software business include free software in their commercial products if the licenses allow that.

Free software is generally available at no cost and can result in permanently lower TCO (total cost of ownership) compared to proprietary software. With free software, businesses can fit software to their specific needs by changing the software themselves or by hiring programmers to modify it for them. Free software often has no warranty, and more importantly, generally does not assign legal liability to anyone. However, warranties are permitted between any two parties upon the condition of the software and its usage. Such an agreement is made separately from the free software license.

A report by Standish Group estimates that adoption of free software has caused a drop in revenue to the proprietary software industry by about $60 billion per year. Eric S. Raymond argued that the term &quot;free software&quot; is too ambiguous and intimidating for the business community. Raymond promoted the term &quot;open-source software&quot; as a friendlier alternative for the business and corporate world.

<text>The free software movement is a social movement with the goal of obtaining and guaranteeing certain freedoms for software users, namely the freedoms to run, study, modify, and share copies of software. Software which meets these requirements, The Four Essential Freedoms of Free Software, is termed free software.

Although drawing on traditions and philosophies among members of the 1970s hacker culture and academia, Richard Stallman formally founded the movement in 1983 by launching the GNU Project. Stallman later established the Free Software Foundation in 1985 to support the movement.

== Philosophy ==
The philosophy of the Free Software Movement is based on promoting collaboration between programmers and computer users. This process necessitates the rejection of
proprietary software and the promotion of free software. Stallman notes that this action would not hinder the progression of technology, as he states, &quot;Wasteful duplication of system programming effort will be avoided. This effort can go instead into advancing the state of the art.&quot;

Members of the Free Software Movement believe that all software users should have the freedoms listed in The Free Software Definition. Members hold the belief that it is immoral to prohibit or prevent people from exercising these freedoms, and that they are required in creating a community where software users can help each other and have control over their technology. Regarding proprietary software, some believe that it is not strictly immoral, citing increased profitability in the business models available for proprietary software, along with technical features and convenience.

The Free Software Foundation espouses the principle that all software needs free documentation, as programmers should have the ability to update manuals to reflect modifications made to the software. Within the movement, the FLOSS Manuals foundation specializes in providing such documentation.

== Actions ==
=== Writing and spreading free software ===
The core work of the free software movement is focused on software development. The free software movement also rejects proprietary software, refusing to install software that does not give them the freedoms of free software. According to Stallman, &quot;The only thing in the software field that is worse than an unauthorised copy of a proprietary program, is an authorised copy of the proprietary program because this does the same harm to its whole community of users, and in addition, usually the developer, the perpetrator of this evil, profits from it.&quot;

=== Building awareness ===
Some supporters of the free software movement take up public speaking, or host a stall at software-related conferences to raise awareness of software freedom. This is seen as important since people who receive free software, but who are not aware that it is free software, will later accept a non-free replacement or will add software that is not free software.

A lot of lobbying work has been done against software patents and expansions of copyright law. Other lobbying focuses directly on the use of free software by government agencies and government-funded projects.

=== Asia ===

==== China ====
In June 1997, the Society for Study, Application, and Development of Free Software was established under the China Software Industry Association in Beijing. Through this organization, the website freesoft.cei.gov.cn was developed, though the website is currently inaccessible on IP addresses located in the United States. The use of open-source software Linux in China has moved beyond government and educational institutions and has extended to other organizations such as financial institutions, telecommunications, and public security. Several Chinese researchers and scholars have claimed that the existence of FOSS in China has been important in challenging the presence of Microsoft, which Guangnan Ni, a member of the Chinese Academy of Engineering stated, &quot;The monopoly of (Microsoft Windows) is even more powerful in China than other places in the world&quot;. Yi Zhou, a professor of mathematics at Fudan University, has also alleged that, &quot;Government procurement of FLOSS for a number of years in China has compelled Microsoft to cut its prices of Office software substantially&quot; 

==== India ====
Government of India had issued Policy on Adoption of Open Source Software for Government of India in 2015 to drive uptake within the government. With the vision to transform India as a Software Product Nation, National Policy on Software Products-2019 was approved by the Government.

====Pakistan====

Free and Open Source Software (Foss) is crucial for countries such as Pakistan which is set up by Union of Information Technology. For the case of Pakistan, Pakistan Software Export Board (PSEB) aids in the creation and advocate of FOSS usage in various government departments in addition to curbing illegality of copying that is software piracy. Promotion of adoption of FOSS is essential however it comes with problems of proprietary anti competition software practices including indulging in bribing and corruption by government departments. Pakistan works on the introduction  of usage of open type  basis of source Solutions in the curricula  in schools and colleges. This is because of FOSS uniqueness in terms of political, democratic and social varieties of aspect regarding  information communication and technology. 
=== North America ===

==== United States ====
In the United States, there have been efforts to pass legislation at the state level encouraging the use of free software by state government agencies.

On January 11, 2022, two bills were shown on the New Hampshire legislating floor. The first bill called &quot;HB 1273&quot; was introduced by Democratic New Hampshire representative Eric Gallager, the bill prioritized &quot;replacing proprietary software used by state agencies with free software.&quot; Gallager stated that to an extent, the proposed legislation will help distinguish &quot;free software&quot; and &quot;open-source software&quot;, this will also put these two into state regulation. The second bill called &quot;HB 1581&quot; was proposed by Grafton Republican representative Lex Berezhny. The bill would&#x27;ve restored a requisite forcing &quot;state agencies to use proprietary software&quot; and as Lex put it, &quot;when it is the most effective solution.&quot; He also said that requisite was happening between 2012 and 2018. According to the Concord Monitor, the state of New Hampshire had an already &quot;thriving open source software community&quot; with a view of &quot;live free or die&quot; but they had difficulty getting that notion with the state.

=== South America ===

==== Peru ====
Congressmen Edgar David Villanueva and Jacques Rodrich Ackerman have been instrumental in introducing free software in Peru, with bill 1609 on &quot;Free Software in Public Administration&quot;. The incident invited the attention of Microsoft, Peru, whose general manager wrote a letter to Villanueva. His response received worldwide attention and is seen as a classic piece of argumentation favouring use of free software in governments.

==== Uruguay ====
Uruguay has a sanctioned law requiring that the state give priority to free software. It also requires that information be exchanged in open formats.

==== Venezuela ====
The Government of Venezuela implemented a free software law in January 2006. Decree No. 3,390 mandated all government agencies to migrate to free software over a two-year period.

=== Europe ===
Publiccode.eu is a campaign launched demanding a legislation requiring that publicly financed software developed for the public sector be made publicly available under a Free and Open Source Software licence. If it is public money, it should be public code as well.

==== France ====
The French Gendarmerie and the French National Assembly utilize the open source operating system Linux.

==== United Kingdom ====
Gov.uk keeps a list of &quot;key components, tools and services that have gone into the construction of GOV.UK&quot;.

== Events ==

Free Software events happening all around the world connects people to increase visibility for Free software projects and foster collaborations.

==Economics==
The free software movement has been extensively analyzed using economic methodologies, including perspectives from heterodox economics. Of particular interest to economists is the willingness of programmers in the free software movement to work, .

In his 1998 article &quot;The High-Tech Gift Economy&quot;, Richard Barbrook suggested that the then-nascent free software movement represented a return to the gift economy building on hobbyism and the absence of economic scarcity on the Internet.

Gabriella Coleman has emphasized the importance of accreditation, respect, and honour within the free software community as a form of compensation for contributions to projects, over and against financial motivations.

The Swedish Marxian economist Johan Söderberg has argued that the free software movement represents a complete alternative to capitalism that may be expanded to create a post-work society. He argues that the combination of a manipulation of intellectual property law and private property to make goods available to the public and a thorough blend between labor and fun make the free software movement a communist economy.

== Subgroups and schisms ==
Since its inception, there is an ongoing contention between the many FLOSS organizations (FSF, OSI, Debian, Mozilla Foundation, Apache Foundation, etc.) within the free software movement, with the main conflicts centered around the organization&#x27;s needs for compromise and pragmatism rather than adhering to founding values and philosophies.

=== Open source ===
The Open Source Initiative (OSI) was founded in February 1998 by Eric Raymond and Bruce Perens to promote the term &quot;open-source software&quot; as an alternative term for free software. The OSI aimed to address the perceived shortcomings and ambiguity of the term &quot;free software&quot;, as well as shifting the focus of free software from a social and ethical issue to instead emphasize open source as a superior model for software development. The latter became the view of Eric Raymond and Linus Torvalds, while Bruce Perens argued that open source was meant to popularize free software under a new brand and called for a return to basic ethical principles.

Some free software advocates use the terms &quot;Free and Open-Source Software&quot; (FOSS) or &quot;Free/Libre and Open-Source Software&quot; (FLOSS) as a form of inclusive compromise, which brings free and open-source software advocates together to work on projects cohesively. Some users believe this is an ideal solution in order to promote both the user&#x27;s freedom with the software and the pragmatic efficiency of an open-source development model. This view is reinforced by fact that majority of OSI-approved licenses and self-avowed open-source programs are also compatible with the free software formalisms and vice versa.

While free and open source software are often linked together, they offer two separate ideas and values. Richard Stallman has referred to open source as &quot;&quot;a non-movement&quot;, as it &quot;does not campaign for anything&quot;&quot;.

&quot;Open source&quot; addresses software being open as a practical question rather than an ethical dilemma – non-free software is not the best solution but nonetheless a solution. The free software movement views free software as a moral imperative: that proprietary software should be rejected, and that only free software should be developed and taught in order to make computing technology beneficial to the general public.

Although the movements have differing values and goals, collaborations between the Free Software Movement and Open Source Initiative have taken place when it comes to practical projects. By 2005, Richard Glass considered the differences to be a &quot;serious fracture&quot; but &quot;vitally important to those on both sides of the fracture&quot; and &quot;of little importance to anyone else studying the movement from a software engineering perspective&quot; since they have had &quot;little effect on the field&quot;.

== Criticism and controversy ==

=== Principle compromises ===
Eric Raymond criticises the speed at which the free software movement is progressing, suggesting that temporary compromises should be made for long-term gains. Raymond argues that this could raise awareness of the software and thus increase the free software movement&#x27;s influence on relevant standards and legislation.

Richard Stallman, on the other hand, sees the current level of compromise as a greater cause for worry.

=== Programmer income ===

Stallman said that this is where people get the misconception of &quot;free&quot;: there is no wrong in programmers&#x27; requesting payment for a proposed project, or charging for copies of free software. Restricting and controlling the user&#x27;s decisions on use is the actual violation of freedom. Stallman defends that in some cases, monetary incentive is not necessary for motivation since the pleasure in expressing creativity is a reward in itself. Conversely, Stallman admits that it is not easy to raise money for free software projects.

=== &quot;Viral&quot; copyleft licensing ===
The free software movement champions copyleft licensing schema (often pejoratively called &quot;viral licenses&quot;). In its strongest form, copyleft mandates that any works &quot;derived&quot; from copyleft-licensed software must also carry a copyleft license, so the license spreads from work to work like a computer virus might spread from machine to machine. Stallman has previously stated his opposition to describing the GNU GPL as &quot;viral&quot;. These licensing terms can only be enforced through asserting copyrights.

Critics of copyleft licensing challenge the idea that restricting modifications is in line with the free software movement&#x27;s emphasis on various &quot;freedoms&quot;, especially when alternatives like MIT, BSD, and Apache licenses are more permissive. Proponents enjoy the assurance that copylefted work cannot usually be incorporated into non-free software projects. They emphasize that copyleft licenses may not attach for all uses and that in any case, developers can simply choose not to use copyleft-licensed software.

=== License proliferation and compatibility ===

FLOSS license proliferation is a serious concern in the FLOSS domain due to increased complexity of license compatibility considerations which limits and complicates source code reuse between FLOSS projects. The OSI and the FSF maintain their own lists of dozens of existing and acceptable FLOSS licenses. There is an agreement among most that the creation of new licenses should be minimized and those created should be made compatible with the major existing FLOSS licenses. Therefore, there was a strong controversy around the update of the GNU GPLv2 to the GNU GPLv3 in 2007, as the updated license is not compatible with the previous version. Several projects (mostly of the open source faction like the Linux kernel) decided to not adopt the GPLv3 while almost all of the GNU project&#x27;s packages adopted it.

<text>Food is any substance consumed by an organism for nutritional support. Food is usually of plant, animal, or fungal origin and contains essential nutrients such as carbohydrates, fats, proteins, vitamins, or minerals. The substance is ingested by an organism and assimilated by the organism&#x27;s cells to provide energy, maintain life, or stimulate growth. Different species of animals have different feeding behaviours that satisfy the needs of their metabolisms and have evolved to fill a specific ecological niche within specific geographical contexts.

Omnivorous humans are highly adaptable and have adapted to obtaining food in many different ecosystems. Humans generally use cooking to prepare food for consumption. The majority of the food energy required is supplied by the industrial food industry, which produces food through intensive agriculture and distributes it through complex food processing and food distribution systems. This system of conventional agriculture relies heavily on fossil fuels, which means that the food and agricultural systems are one of the major contributors to climate change, accounting for as much as 37% of total greenhouse gas emissions.

The food system has a significant impact on a wide range of other social and political issues, including sustainability, biological diversity, economics, population growth, water supply, and food security. Food safety and security are monitored by international agencies, like the International Association for Food Protection, the World Resources Institute, the World Food Programme, the Food and Agriculture Organization, and the International Food Information Council.

==Definition and classification==
Food is any substance consumed to provide nutritional support and energy to an organism. It can be raw, processed, or formulated and is consumed orally by animals for growth, health, or pleasure. Food is mainly composed of water, lipids, proteins, and carbohydrates. Minerals (e.g., salts) and organic substances (e.g., vitamins) can also be found in food. Plants, algae, and some microorganisms use photosynthesis to make some of their own nutrients. Water is found in many foods and has been defined as food by itself. Water and fiber have low energy densities, or calories, while fat is the most energy-dense component. Some inorganic (non-food) elements are also essential for plant and animal functioning.

Human food can be classified in various ways, either by related content or by how it is processed. The number and composition of food groups can vary. Most systems include four basic groups that describe their origin and relative nutritional function: Vegetables and Fruit, Cereals and Bread, Dairy, and Meat. Studies that look into diet quality group food into whole grains/cereals, refined grains/cereals, vegetables, fruits, nuts, legumes, eggs, dairy products, fish, red meat, processed meat, and sugar-sweetened beverages. The Food and Agriculture Organization and World Health Organization use a system with nineteen food classifications: cereals, roots, pulses and nuts, milk, eggs, fish and shellfish, meat, insects, vegetables, fruits, fats and oils, sweets and sugars, spices and condiments, beverages, foods for nutritional uses, food additives, composite dishes and savory snacks.

==Food sources==
In a given ecosystem, food forms a web of interlocking chains with primary producers at the bottom and apex predators at the top. Other aspects of the web include detrovores (that eat detritis) and decomposers (that break down dead organisms). Primary producers include algae, plants, bacteria and protists that acquire their energy from sunlight. Primary consumers are the herbivores that consume the plants, and secondary consumers are the carnivores that consume those herbivores. Some organisms, including most mammals and birds, diet consists of both animals and plants, and they are considered omnivores. The chain ends with the apex predators, the animals that have no known predators in its ecosystem. Humans are considered apex predators.

Humans are omnivores, finding sustenance in vegetables, fruits, cooked meat, milk, eggs, mushrooms and seaweed. Cereal grain is a staple food that provides more food energy worldwide than any other type of crop. Corn (maize), wheat, and rice account for 87% of all grain production worldwide. Just over half of the world&#x27;s crops are used to feed humans (55 percent), with 36 percent grown as animal feed and 9 percent for biofuels. Fungi and bacteria are also used in the preparation of fermented foods like bread, wine, cheese and yogurt.

===Photosynthesis===
During photosynthesis, energy from the sun is absorbed and used to transform water and carbon dioxide in the air or soil into oxygen and glucose. The oxygen is then released, and the glucose stored as an energy reserve. Photosynthetic plants, algae and certain bacteria often represent the lowest point of the food chains, making photosynthesis the primary source of energy and food for nearly all life on earth.

Plants also absorb important nutrients and minerals from the air, natural waters, and soil. Carbon, oxygen and hydrogen are absorbed from the air or water and are the basic nutrients needed for plant survival. The three main nutrients absorbed from the soil for plant growth are nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium, with other important nutrients including calcium, sulfur, magnesium, iron boron, chlorine, manganese, zinc, copper molybdenum and nickel.

===Microorganisms===
Bacteria and other microorganisms also form the lower rungs of the food chain. They obtain their energy from photosynthesis or by breaking down dead organisms, waste or chemical compounds. Some form symbiotic relationships with other organisms to obtain their nutrients. Bacteria provide a source of food for protozoa, who in turn provide a source of food for other organisms such as small invertebrates. Other organisms that feed on bacteria include nematodes, fan worms, shellfish and a species of snail.

In the marine environment, plankton (which includes bacteria, archaea, algae, protozoa and microscopic fungi) provide a crucial source of food to many small and large aquatic organisms.

Without bacteria, life would scarcely exist because bacteria convert atmospheric nitrogen into nutritious ammonia. Ammonia is the precursor to proteins, nucleic acids, and most vitamins. Since the advent of industrial process for nitrogen fixation, the Haber-Bosch Process, the majority of ammonia in the world is human-made.

===Plants===
Plants as a food source are divided into seeds, fruits, vegetables, legumes, grains and nuts. Where plants fall within these categories can vary, with botanically described fruits such as the tomato, squash, pepper and eggplant or seeds like peas commonly considered vegetables. Food is a fruit if the part eaten is derived from the reproductive tissue, so seeds, nuts and grains are technically fruit. From a culinary perspective, fruits are generally considered the remains of botanically described fruits after grains, nuts, seeds and fruits used as vegetables are removed. Grains can be defined as seeds that humans eat or harvest, with cereal grains (oats, wheat, rice, corn, barley, rye, sorghum and millet) belonging to the Poaceae (grass) family and pulses coming from the Fabaceae (legume) family. Whole grains are foods that contain all the elements of the original seed (bran, germ, and endosperm). Nuts are dry fruits, distinguishable by their woody shell.

Fleshy fruits (distinguishable from dry fruits like grain, seeds and nuts) can be further classified as stone fruits (cherries and peaches), pome fruits (apples, pears), berries (blackberry, strawberry), citrus (oranges, lemon), melons (watermelon, cantaloupe), Mediterranean fruits (grapes, fig), tropical fruits (banana, pineapple). Vegetables refer to any other part of the plant that can be eaten, including roots, stems, leaves, flowers, bark or the entire plant itself. These include root vegetables (potatoes and carrots), bulbs (onion family), flowers (cauliflower and broccoli), leaf vegetables (spinach and lettuce) and stem vegetables (celery and asparagus).

The carbohydrate, protein and lipid content of plants is highly variable. Carbohydrates are mainly in the form of starch, fructose, glucose and other sugars. Most vitamins are found from plant sources, with the exception of vitamin D and vitamin B12. Minerals can also be plentiful or not. Fruit can consist of up to 90% water, contain high levels of simple sugars that contribute to their sweet taste, and have a high vitamin C content. Compared to fleshy fruit (excepting Bananas) vegetables are high in starch, potassium, dietary fiber, folate and vitamins and low in fat and calories. Grains are more starch based and nuts have a high protein, fiber, vitamin E and B content. Seeds are a good source of food for animals because they are abundant and contain fiber and healthful fats, such as omega-3 fats. Complicated chemical interactions can enhance or depress bioavailability of certain nutrients. Phytates can prevent the release of some sugars and vitamins.

Animals that only eat plants are called herbivores, with those that mostly just eat fruits known as frugivores, leaves, while shoot eaters are folivores (pandas) and wood eaters termed xylophages (termites). Frugivores include a diverse range of species from annelids to elephants, chimpanzees and many birds. About 182 fish consume seeds or fruit. Animals (domesticated and wild) use as many types of grasses that have adapted to different locations as their main source of nutrients.

Humans eat thousands of plant species; there may be as many as 75,000 edible species of angiosperms, of which perhaps 7,000 are often eaten. Plants can be processed into breads, pasta, cereals, juices and jams or raw ingredients such as sugar, herbs, spices and oils can be extracted. Oilseeds are pressed to produce rich oils⁣sunflower, flaxseed, rapeseed (including canola oil) and sesame.

Many plants and animals have coevolved in such a way that the fruit is a good source of nutrition for the animal, who then excretes the seeds some distance away, allowing greater dispersal. Even seed predation can be mutually beneficial, as some seeds can survive the digestion process. Insects are major eaters of seeds, with ants being the only real seed dispersers. Birds, although being major dispersers, only rarely eat seeds as a source of food and can be identified by their thick beak that is used to crack open the seed coat. Mammals eat a more diverse range of seeds, as they are able to crush harder and larger seeds with their teeth.

===Animals===
Animals are used as food either directly or indirectly. This includes meat, eggs, shellfish and dairy products like milk and cheese. They are an important source of protein and are considered complete proteins for human consumption as they contain all the essential amino acids that the human body needs. One steak, chicken breast or pork chop contains about 30 grams of protein. One large egg has 7 grams of protein. A serving of cheese has about 15 grams of protein. And 1 cup of milk has about 8 grams of protein. Other nutrients found in animal products include calories, fat, essential vitamins (including B12) and minerals (including zinc, iron, calcium, magnesium).

Food products produced by animals include milk produced by mammary glands, which in many cultures is drunk or processed into dairy products (cheese, butter, etc.). Eggs laid by birds and other animals are eaten and bees produce honey, a reduced nectar from flowers that is used as a popular sweetener in many cultures. Some cultures consume blood, such as in blood sausage, as a thickener for sauces, or in a cured, salted form for times of food scarcity, and others use blood in stews such as jugged hare.

==Taste==
Animals, specifically humans, typically have five different types of tastes: sweet, sour, salty, bitter, and umami. The differing tastes are important for distinguishing between foods that are nutritionally beneficial and those which may contain harmful toxins. As animals have evolved, the tastes that provide the most energy are the most pleasant to eat while others are not enjoyable, although humans in particular can acquire a preference for some substances which are initially unenjoyable. Water, while important for survival, has no taste.

Sweetness is almost always caused by a type of simple sugar such as glucose or fructose, or disaccharides such as sucrose, a molecule combining glucose and fructose. Sourness is caused by acids, such as vinegar in alcoholic beverages. Sour foods include citrus, specifically lemons and limes. Sour is evolutionarily significant as it can signal a food that may have gone rancid due to bacteria. Saltiness is the taste of alkali metal ions such as sodium and potassium. It is found in almost every food in low to moderate proportions to enhance flavor. Bitter taste is a sensation considered unpleasant characterised by having a sharp, pungent taste. Unsweetened dark chocolate, caffeine, lemon rind, and some types of fruit are known to be bitter. Umami, commonly described as savory, is a marker of proteins and characteristic of broths and cooked meats. Foods that have a strong umami flavor include cheese, meat and mushrooms.

While most animals taste buds are located in their mouth, some insects taste receptors are located on their legs and some fish have taste buds along their entire body. Dogs, cats and birds have relatively few taste buds (chickens have about 30), adult humans have between 2000 and 4000, while catfish can have more than a million. Herbivores generally have more than carnivores as they need to tell which plants may be poisonous. Not all mammals share the same tastes: some rodents can taste starch, cats cannot taste sweetness, and several carnivores (including hyenas, dolphins, and sea lions) have lost the ability to sense up to four of the five taste modalities found in humans.

==Digestion==
Food is broken into nutrient components through digestive process. Proper digestion consists of mechanical processes (chewing, peristalsis) and chemical processes (digestive enzymes and microorganisms). The digestive systems of herbivores and carnivores are very different as plant matter is harder to digest. Carnivores mouths are designed for tearing and biting compared to the grinding action found in herbivores. Herbivores however have comparatively longer digestive tracts and larger stomachs to aid in digesting the cellulose in plants.

==Food safety==
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), about 600 million people worldwide get sick and 420,000 die each year from eating contaminated food. Diarrhea is the most common illness caused by consuming contaminated food, with about 550 million cases and 230,000 deaths from diarrhea each year. Children under five years of age account for 40% of the burden of foodborne illness, with 125,000 deaths each year.

A 2003 World Health Organization (WHO) report concluded that about 30% of reported food poisoning outbreaks in the WHO European Region occur in private homes. According to the WHO and CDC, in the US alone, annually, there are 76 million cases of foodborne illness leading to 325,000 hospitalizations and 5,000 deaths.

From 2011 to 2016, on average, there were 668,673 cases of foodborne illness and 21 deaths each year. In addition, during this period, 1,007 food poisoning outbreaks with 30,395 cases of food poisoning were reported.

<text>Floating Point is an album by John McLaughlin, released in 2008 through the record label Abstract Logix. The album reached number fourteen on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Top Jazz Albums chart.

Regarding the recording, McLaughlin commented: &quot;while this CD features predominantly Indian musicians, we are in quite another form compared to the group Shakti... The music is for the most part &#x27;Jazz-Fusion&#x27; if a label has to be put on it. But with the musicians involved in this project, it has also a &#x27;world&#x27; kind of atmosphere.&quot; Concerning the album title, McLaughlin remarked: &quot;Every now and then a group of musicians will gel together in such an incredible way, and at that point it&#x27;s like you lose normal gravity... you&#x27;ve got your own gravity happening and you&#x27;re kind of like floating with the other guys.&quot;

==Reception==

Michael G. Nastos of AllMusic called the album &quot;a surprisingly fine effort, ebbing and flowing from track to track, with McLaughlin&#x27;s high-level musicianship shining through, same as it ever was.&quot;

In a 5-star review for DownBeat, Ken Micallef commented: &quot;this brilliant collective plays as a
single unit, not a band of hired studio guns... This is a case of Indian musicians using their extraordinary skills to explore U.S. fusion, giving the now 70-year-old guitarist an amazing platform for compositional/improvisational development. This is a landmark recording, marked by detail, subtlety and extraordinarily moving performances.&quot;

John Kelman in All About Jazz wrote &quot;One of the most fluent, evocative and powerful albums in a career filled with high points,&quot; and concluded: &quot;McLaughlin&#x27;s Indian friends may not have jazz in their blood the way it is in the guitarist&#x27;s, but by approaching unmistakably western-informed music with an eastern mindset, they make &quot;Floating Point&quot; an album that, in McLaughlin&#x27;s lengthy discography, is one of his most successful fusion records&quot;.

Writing for The Guardian, John Fordham awarded the album 5 stars, and stated: &quot;this boiling new set sounds as if it&#x27;s driven at least as much by cutting-edge Indian crossover musicians as by McLaughlin himself... this is 99% an absolute cracker, and not just for guitar nuts either.&quot;

<text>A fantasy sport (also known less commonly as rotisserie or roto) is a game, often played using the Internet, where participants assemble imaginary or virtual teams composed of proxies of real players of a professional sport. These teams compete based on the statistical performance of those players in actual games. This performance is converted into points that are compiled and totaled according to a roster selected by each fantasy team&#x27;s manager. These point systems can be simple enough to be manually calculated by a &quot;league commissioner&quot; who coordinates and manages the overall league, or points can be compiled and calculated using computers tracking actual results of the professional sport. In fantasy sports, as in real sports, team owners draft, trade, and cut (drop) players.

==History==

===Early simulations===
The history of fantasy games can be traced to the 19th century. The tabletop game &quot;Sebring Parlor Base Ball&quot;, introduced in 1866, allowed participants to simulate games by propelling a coin into slots on a wooden board. Later games featured outcomes determined by dice rolls or spinners. In 1930, Clifford Van Beek designed the board game &quot;National Pastime&quot;, which contained customized baseball cards of Major League Baseball (MLB) players. After rolling a pair of dice, participants would consult the card of the MLB player &quot;at bat&quot; to determine an outcome, which could range from a single, double, triple, or home run to a strikeout, putout, walk, or error. Players with better statistics in the previous season were more likely to receive favorable outcomes; this allowed &quot;National Pastime&quot; to become one of the first games to try to simulate the performances of real-life MLB players.

An example of such games was APBA, which was first released in 1951 and also contained cards of MLB players with in-game outcomes correlated to their stats from past seasons. Participants could compose fantasy teams from the cards and play against each other or recreate previous seasons using the statistics on the cards. Individual player cards and dice roll simulations were also emulated in the Strat-O-Matic game, which was first released in 1961. Daniel Okrent, who would later be credited with developing modern fantasy baseball, was an avid Strat-O-Matic player, telling &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; in 2011 that &quot;if there hadn&#x27;t been Strat-O-Matic, I still think I would have come up with rotisserie, but unquestionably it helped.&quot;

In 1961, another early form of fantasy baseball was coded for the IBM 1620 computer by John Burgeson, then working for IBM. A user would select a team from a limited roster of retired players to play against a team randomly chosen by the computer. The computer would then use random number generation and player statistics to simulate a game&#x27;s outcome and print a play-by-play description of it.

While some of these fantasy games produced outcomes based on the performances of real athletes, they were not designed to be played out over the course of a season, nor did they take current statistics into account, relying instead on those from previous years.

===The first leagues===
In the 1950s, Oakland, California businessman and future limited partner in the Oakland Raiders Wilfred &quot;Bill&quot; Winkenbach developed a fantasy golf game in which participants would select a roster of professional golfers and compare their scores at the end of a given tournament, with the lowest combined total of strokes winning. He also created a baseball game in which players drafted hitters and pitchers, comparing their real-life statistics against each other. These early experiments, however, failed to spread to the general public.

In 1960, sociologist William A. Gamson developed the Baseball Seminar league, in which participants would draft rosters of active MLB players and compare results at the end of the season based on the players&#x27; final batting averages, earned run averages, runs batted in, and win totals. Gamson would go on to play the game as a professor at the University of Michigan, where another competitor was Bob Sklar. One of Sklar&#x27;s students was Daniel Okrent. According to Alan Schwarz&#x27;s &quot;The Numbers Game: Baseball’s Lifelong Fascination with Statistics&quot;, Sklar told Okrent about the Baseball Seminar league.

Two years later, in a New York City hotel room during a 1962 Raiders cross-country trip, Winkenbach, along with Raiders public relations employee Bill Tunnel and &quot;Oakland Tribune&quot; reporter Scotty Stirling, developed the rules that would eventually be the basis of modern fantasy football. The inaugural league was called the Greater Oakland Professional Pigskin Prognosticators League (GOPPPL), and the first draft took place at Winkenbach&#x27;s home in Oakland in August 1963. One of the league&#x27;s original members, Andy Mousalimas, owned a sports bar in Oakland called the King&#x27;s X, where the first public fantasy football league was founded in 1969. The idea spread by word of mouth when the patrons of other Bay Area bars visited the King&#x27;s X for trivia contests.

===Rotisserie League Baseball===
Modern fantasy baseball was developed and popularized in the 1980s by a group of journalists who created Rotisserie League Baseball in 1980. The league was named after the New York City restaurant La Rotisserie Française, where its founders met for lunch and first played the game. Magazine writer-editor Daniel Okrent is credited with introducing the rotisserie league concept to the group and inventing the scoring system. Players in the Rotisserie League drafted teams of active MLB players and tracked their statistics during the season to compile their scores. Like the Baseball Seminar league, rather than using statistics for seasons whose outcomes were already known to simulate in-game outcomes, team owners would have to make predictions about the statistics that MLB players would accumulate during the upcoming season.

Rotisserie baseball, nicknamed &quot;roto&quot;, proved to be popular despite the difficulties of compiling statistics by hand, which was an early drawback to participation. Okrent credits the idea&#x27;s rapid spread to the fact that the initial league was created by sports journalists, telling &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; in 2008 that &quot;most of us in the league were in the media, and we got a lot of press coverage that first season. The second season, there were rotisserie leagues in every Major League press box.&quot; According to Okrent, rotisserie baseball afforded sportswriters the opportunity to write about baseball-related material during the 1981 Major League Baseball strike, saying &quot;the writers who were covering baseball had nothing to write about, so they began writing about the teams they had assembled in their own leagues. And that was what popularized it and spread it around very, very widely.&quot;

===Growth and early participants===
Before the advent of the Internet, fantasy sports grew through print publications, such as magazines and newspapers. In 1987, &quot;Fantasy Football Index&quot;, the first national magazine dedicated to fantasy football, was launched by Ian Allan and Bruce Taylor. &quot;Fantasy Sports Magazine&quot; debuted in 1989 as the first regular publication covering more than one fantasy sport.

In 1990, a pair of nationwide fantasy games, Dugout Derby and Pigskin Playoff, were launched in a variety of newspapers across the United States, including the &quot;Arizona Republic&quot;, the &quot;Hartford Courant&quot;, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, and the &quot;Miami Herald&quot;. Players chose their teams by calling a toll-free phone number and entering four-digit codes for each of their player selections. The games served as an early version of today&#x27;s daily fantasy sports by rewarding each week&#x27;s highest-scoring participants with prizes.

In 1993, the magazine &quot;Fantasy Football Weekly&quot; was launched. Also that year, &quot;USA Today&quot; added a weekly fantasy baseball columnist, John Hunt. Hunt started a league among sports personalities called the League of Alternate Baseball Reality, which first included Peter Gammons, Keith Olbermann and Bill James, among others.

===Internet expansion===

The growth of the Internet during the 1990s brought a &quot;broad demographic shift in fantasy sports participation&quot; because it enabled fantasy sports participants to instantaneously download tabulated statistics, rather than having to search for box scores of individual games in newspapers and keep track of cumulative statistics on paper.

In 1995, ESPN launched its first entirely Internet-based fantasy baseball game, with other major sports and entertainment companies following suit in the ensuing years. In October of that year, a fantasy hockey website was released by Molson Breweries as part of the company&#x27;s &quot;I am Online&quot; marketing strategy centered around its I am Canadian advertising campaign. The site focused on music, entertainment and hockey in general in addition to fantasy competitions. It allowed users to register accounts and participate in fantasy leagues of nine teams. The site included updates of National Hockey League (NHL) statistics and provided content from the Hockey Hall of Fame.

CBS Sports began offering fantasy football leagues in 1997, the same year that the fantasy news website now known as RotoWire was launched. In July 1999, Yahoo began offering its fantasy football product for free, a decision that gave the site an advantage over its competitors. The creators of &quot;Fantasy Football Weekly&quot; launched Fanball.com later that year. While some sites abandoned a paid model in the wake of Yahoo&#x27;s decision, some smaller sites, such as RotoWire, began offering paid products as they started losing business to larger competitors. CBS, which had transitioned to a free model for its league commissioner services, switched back to a paid model before the 2002 MLB season.

A trade group for the industry, the Fantasy Sports Trade Association, was formed in 1998. Now known as the Fantasy Sports &amp; Gaming Association (FSGA), the organization estimates that in 2003, there were 15.2 million fantasy sports players in the United States and Canada.

During the first decade of the 2000s, fantasy sports started to become a mainstream hobby. In 2002, the National Football League (NFL) found that while the average male surveyed on its website spent 6.6 hours a week watching the league on television, fantasy players surveyed said they watched 8.4 hours of NFL football per week. &quot;This is the first time we&#x27;ve been able to demonstrate specifically that fantasy play drives TV viewing,&quot; said Chris Russo, the NFL&#x27;s senior vice president at the time. As a result of the survey&#x27;s findings, the league made fantasy offerings more prominent on its website and produced television ads for fantasy football featuring active players. Prior to these developments, fantasy sports were largely viewed negatively by major sports leagues, with Russo later recalling that &quot;there were concerns about whether it would be right for the fans or could it be construed as gambling.&quot; However, leagues began to embrace fantasy sports as their value towards increasing fans&#x27; consumption of sports became more evident.

====Daily fantasy sports====
Daily fantasy sports are accelerated versions of the traditional fantasy format in which contests are conducted over shorter periods than a full season, often lasting one week or even a single day. Daily fantasy games are typically subject to an entry fee, a portion of which funds a prize pool that is distributed among the game&#x27;s winner or winners.

In June 2007, Fantasy Sports Live, one of the first daily fantasy sites, was launched. In November 2008, NBC launched a daily fantasy site called SnapDraft, and FanDuel was founded in 2009 as a spin-off of a Scottish prediction market company. DraftKings was founded in 2012.

Following venture capital investments from various firms, including from professional sports leagues such as MLB and the National Basketball Association (NBA), DraftKings and FanDuel launched an aggressive marketing campaign prior to the 2015 NFL season. At its peak, the two companies collectively ran an ad on national television in the United States once every 90 seconds. In addition to receiving direct investments from sports leagues, the two companies have reached sponsorship deals with several leagues and teams. In November 2014, DraftKings entered into a multi-year sponsorship deal with the NHL. In April 2015, after the NFL began to allow daily fantasy providers to sign multi-year team sponsorship deals, FanDuel reached deals with sixteen teams for placements on team-oriented digital properties, radio broadcasts, and within their stadiums. DraftKings has also received investments from Jerry Jones and Robert Kraft, who own the Dallas Cowboys and New England Patriots, respectively.

The legality of daily fantasy sports has been questioned, with critics arguing that they more closely resemble proposition wagering on athlete performance than a traditional fantasy sports game. However, following the 2018 United States Supreme Court decision in &quot;Murphy v. National Collegiate Athletic Association&quot;, which allowed states to legalize sports betting, questions surrounding the legality of daily fantasy sports, as well as fantasy sports in general, within the United States have largely been settled.

As of May 2023, while 33 US states have operational legalized sports betting, 45 states have legalized daily fantasy sports. As of May 2023, DraftKings and FanDuel operate daily fantasy contests in 44 states each. Only one state, Montana, has officially banned online fantasy sports.

==Industry overview==

===Size of the industry===

In May 2015, Australian market research firm IBISWorld reported that fantasy sports comprised a $2 billion industry in the United States, experiencing 10.7% annual growth and employing 4,386 people in 292 businesses.

According to the Fantasy Sports Trade Association, in 2017, the size of the fantasy sports industry reached $7.22 billion, per research by Ipsos. The study estimated that there were 59.3 million fantasy sports players in the United States and Canada as of that year.

===Industry growth===

The Fantasy Sports &amp; Gaming Association estimates that the number of fantasy sports players in the US and Canada grew from 500,000 in 1988 to 15.2 million in 2003, declining slightly over the next few years before growing to 29.9 million in 2008 and 62.5 million in 2022. In 2015, &quot;Forbes&quot; estimated that the number of yearly non-betting fantasy sports users had grown 25% since 2011. This growth encouraged hundreds of millions of dollars in investments into emerging daily fantasy sports leagues, such as FanDuel and DraftKings.

Outside of North America, the fantasy industry has also experienced a recent period of growth. The development of daily fantasy sports has encouraged growth in European markets. ESPN Super Selector launched in 2001 for fantasy cricket and had 500,000 users during the 2003 Cricket World Cup. By 2017, there were 40 million fantasy sports players in India. In 2019, the number had grown to 90 million, and in 2020, an estimated 100 million Indians participated in fantasy sports. The market leader in fantasy sports in India, Dream11, signed a four-year sponsorship deal for the IPL in 2019.

===Trade associations===

The Fantasy Sports Trade Association was formed in 1998 to represent the growing industry in the United States and Canada. Now known as the Fantasy Sports &amp; Gaming Association, the organization aims to support fantasy sports, sports gambling in general, and its associated businesses and participants.

The Fantasy Sports Writers Association was formed in 2004 to represent the growing numbers of journalists covering fantasy 
sports exclusively. The Fantasy Sports Association was formed in 2006 as a rival trade group. However, the organization folded in 2010.

===Demographics===
According to the Fantasy Sports &amp; Gaming Association (FSGA), an estimated 62.5 million people played fantasy sports in the US and Canada in 2022. The FSGA estimated that 19% of American adults played fantasy sports in 2023, compared to 13% in 2014. A 2023 FSGA survey found that 64% of fantasy sports players were male, 48% were between the ages of 18 and 34, and 84% had a college degree or higher. A 2015 analysis found that 89.8% were white and 51.5% were unmarried.

According to the FSGA, the most popular fantasy sport in the US and Canada is gridiron football, which is played by approximately 79% of fantasy participants. The next most popular sports are basketball (32%), baseball (22%), ice hockey (12%), association football (11%), and college football (11%).

Research has shown that fantasy players are also generally stronger consumers of alcoholic beverages, fast food, airline travel, video games, sports periodicals, athletic shoes, and cell phones relative to the general population. The FSGA reported in 2019 that fantasy players were also far more likely to use Instagram or Snapchat, visit a sports bar, and get food delivered than the general population.

===Fantasy sports television programming===

Due to the popularity of fantasy sports, major sports networks such as ESPN, NFL Network, and Fox Sports have created dedicated weekly fantasy programming to analyze player performance and predict outcomes in relation to particular scoring systems. ESPN&#x27;s on-demand streaming platform ESPN+ offers a fantasy program called &quot;The Fantasy Show&quot; hosted by long time staff writer Matthew Berry. &quot;The Fantasy Show&quot; utilizes puppets and comedy to present statistical information about NFL players. ESPN also aires a show on Sunday mornings during the NFL season called Fantasy Football Now. &quot;Fantasy Football Now&quot; airs live on Sunday mornings during the NFL season, a time when fans are making last-minute roster moves and need the latest news from around the league. Providing the latest info are analysts Matthew Berry, Field Yates and licensed physical therapist Stephania Bell, who gives injury updates.

NFL Network aires &quot;NFL Fantasy Live&quot; as an hour long program containing a consistent weekly segment list that viewers can count on to help them manage their team. &quot;NFL Fantasy Live&quot; is hosted by Cole Wright and features Michael Fabiano, Adam Rank, Marcas Grant, Akbar Gbaja-Biamila, Graham Barfield and statistics analytics expert Cynthia Frelund. Fox Sports Net aires Fantasy Football Hour on a weekly basis during the NFL season hosted by Katy Winge and features industry experts Brad Evans and Nate Lundy.

==Legal issues in the United States==

Fantasy sports are generally considered to be a form of gambling, though they are far less strictly regulated than other forms of sports betting. Unlike traditional sports betting, fantasy sports are generally viewed as &quot;games of skill,&quot; rather than &quot;games of chance,&quot; thus exempting them from gambling bans and regulations in many jurisdictions.

===Federal law related to fantasy gaming===

The Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act of 2006 (UIGEA), was enacted as part of the &quot;American Values Agenda&quot; of 2006 and was added as an amendment to the unrelated SAFE Port Act. The UIGEA generally prohibits funds transfers to businesses engaged in unlawful internet wagering. However the UIGEA does not itself define unlawful internet wagering, and expressly refrains from altering the legality of any underlying conduct other than funds transfers.

While the act does not alter the legality of any particular activity permitted or prohibited under other laws, it does contain some express exemptions to its funds transfer prohibitions. One of these exemptions from the UIGEA prohibitions is for fantasy sports that meet certain criteria. Specifically, fantasy sports that are based on teams of real multiple athletes from multiple real world teams, that have prizes established before the event starts, that use the skill of participants to determine the outcome, are exempted from the definition of a bet or wager that is the basis for requiring banks to identify and block funds transfers. According to Congressman Jim Leach, an author of the UIGEA, exemptions, particularly one for fantasy sports, were included to relieve the burden of enforcement on banks and the UIGEA does not make fantasy sports legal.

Because the UIGEA exempted fantasy sports from its definition of a bet or wager, there is a misconception that fantasy sports were made legal by the UIGEA. However the UIGEA is not a criminal gambling statute, and it specifically does not alter any criminal gambling laws and thus does not make fantasy sports legal. Federal criminal gambling statutes are found in Title 18 of U.S. Code, such as the Federal Wire Act 18 U.S. Code § 1084 (which prohibits interstate sports wagering) and the Illegal Gambling Business Act 18 U.S. Code § 1955 (which prohibits the interstate conduct of wagering activity prohibited under state law). By contrast, the UIGEA is found in Title 31 with other anti-money laundering and financial crimes statutes.

===State laws related to fantasy gaming===

Whether state laws can regulate fantasy sports conducted across state lines depends on whether fantasy sports are a form of sports wagering under federal law. This is because the Federal Wire Act prohibits the conduct of sports wagering in interstate or foreign commerce. With regard to intrastate sports wagering, in 2018 the United States Supreme Court in &quot;Murphy v. National Collegiate Athletic Association&quot; struck down the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act, which had prohibited states from authorizing any wagering, lottery, betting, sweepstakes or other wagering scheme that is based directly or indirectly on games in which professional or amateur athletes participate or on the performance of any athletes in such games.

Where states have not expressly authorized fantasy sports contests, usually general gambling laws prohibit lotteries or wagering if three elements are present: an entry fee (known as &quot;consideration&quot;), a prize (a &quot;reward,&quot; in legal terms) and chance. Whether fantasy sports are legal under these laws hinges on the definition of &quot;chance&quot; that the state applies. For some states, if skill dominates the outcome of the event, then the contest is legal, and passes what is called the &quot;dominant factor test.&quot; Other states with a stricter definition of chance, called &quot;any chance test,&quot; have made fantasy football illegal.

Several states have clarified that paid fantasy sports contests are games of skill and exempt from gambling laws, beginning with Maryland in 2012.

One exception is the state of Nevada, which has an exemption in PASPA to allow for sports betting. The Nevada attorney general issued an opinion that found Daily Fantasy Sports to be a form of sports wagering, similar to the current wagering offered by Nevada Sports Books. The opinions states that Daily Fantasy Sports are not illegal in Nevada; however, a sports pool license is required to conduct the activity in Nevada.

Several Attorneys General have also issued opinions that Daily Fantasy Sports are a form of sports wagering. A Florida state attorney general&#x27;s opinion in 1991 called into doubt the legality of fantasy football contests, but companies have operated in the state without any legal action. Since then nine other AGs have issued options, statements or formal opinions that equate DFS with gambling.

However, several other Attorneys General have issued opinions that DFS are legal games of skill. In August 2015 in Kansas, due to uncertainty with the state&#x27;s Racing and Gaming Commission position, the state&#x27;s attorney general issued an opinion that daily fantasy sports was a skill game and thus permitted under state law. Kansas Gov. Sam Brownback signed legislation a month later authorizing fantasy gaming. The Attorneys General of West Virginia and Rhode Island have also issued opinions that clarified the legality of DFS and paid fantasy sports.

As of January 2022, online fantasy sports are legal in 49 of the 50 US states. The only state with a ban on online fantasy sports that is codified in statute is Montana. As of January 2022, daily fantasy sports are legal in 45 US states, with 23 of those states explicitly passing legislation legalizing the practice.

===Legal cases related to use of player statistics===

There have been other legal cases involving fantasy sports and the use of professional athletes&#x27; statistics for purposes of scoring.

====STATS, Inc. vs. NBA====

In 1996, STATS, Inc., a major statistical provider to fantasy sports companies, won a court case, along with Motorola, on appeal against the NBA in which the NBA was trying to stop STATS from distributing in game score information via a special wireless device created by Motorola. The victory played a large part in defending other cases where sports leagues have tried to suppress live in-game information from their events being distributed by other outlets. The victory also accelerated the demand for real-time statistics amid the growth of the fantasy sports industry.

====CDM vs. MLBAM====

The development of fantasy sports produced tension between fantasy sports companies and professional leagues and players associations over the rights to player profiles and statistics. The players associations of the major sports leagues believed that fantasy games using player names were subject to licensing due to the right of publicity of the players involved. Since the player names were being used as a group, the players had assigned their publicity rights to the players association who then signed licensing deals. During the 1980s and 1990s many companies signed licensing deals with the player associations, but some companies did not. The issue came to a head with the lawsuit of Major League Baseball Advanced Media (MLBAM), MLB&#x27;s Internet company, vs. St. Louis-based CBC Distribution and Marketing Inc., the parent company of CDM Sports. When CBC was denied a new licensing agreement with MLBAM (they had acquired the rights from the baseball players&#x27; association) for its fantasy baseball game, CBC filed suit.

CBC argued that intellectual property laws and so-called &quot;right of publicity&quot; laws don&#x27;t apply to the statistics used in fantasy sports. The FSTA filed an amicus curiae in support of CBC, also arguing that if MLBAM won the lawsuit it would have a dramatic impact on the industry, which was largely ignored by the major sports leagues for years while a number of smaller entrepreneurs grew it into a multibillion-dollar industry, and a ruling could allow the MLBAM to have a monopoly over the industry.

&quot;This will be a defining moment in the fantasy sports industry,&quot; said Charlie Wiegert, executive vice president of CBC. &quot;The other leagues are all watching this case. If MLB prevailed, it just would have been a matter of time before they followed up. Their player unions are just waiting for the opportunity.&quot;

CBC won the lawsuit as US District Court Judge Mary Ann Medler ruled that statistics are part of the public domain and can be used at no cost by fantasy companies. &quot;The names and playing records of major-league baseball players as used in CBC&#x27;s fantasy games are not copyrightable,&quot; Medler wrote. &quot;Therefore, federal copyright law does not pre-empt the players&#x27; claimed right of publicity.&quot;

The 8th Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the decision in October 2007. &quot;It would be strange law that a person would not have a First Amendment right to use information that is available to everyone,&quot; a three-judge panel said in its ruling. The Supreme Court upheld the circuit court&#x27;s decision by declining to hear the case in June 2008. In 2009, CBS Interactive won a lawsuit against the NFL Players’ Association over whether CBS had a First Amendment right to use players’ names and playing records in its fantasy sports offerings without paying licensing fees.

<text>In several forms of football, a forward pass is the throwing of the ball in the direction in which the offensive team is trying to move, towards the defensive team&#x27;s goal line. The legal and widespread use of the forward pass distinguishes gridiron football (American football and Canadian football) from rugby football (union and league) from which the gridiron code evolved, in which the play is illegal.

Illegal and experimental forward passes had been attempted as early as 1876, but the first legal forward pass in American football took place in 1906, after a change in the rules. Another rule change on January 18, 1951, established that no center or guard could receive a forward pass, and a tackle may only do so if he announces his intent to the referee beforehand that he will be an eligible receiver, called a tackle-eligible play. The only linemen who can receive a forward pass are the ends (tight ends and wide receivers). The rules regulate who may throw and who may receive a forward pass, and under what circumstances, as well as how the defensive team may try to prevent a pass from being completed. The primary passer is the quarterback, and statistical analysis is used to determine a quarterback&#x27;s success rate at passing in various situations, as well as a team&#x27;s overall success at the passing game.

==Gridiron football==

In gridiron football, a forward pass is usually referred to simply as a pass, and consists of a player throwing the football towards the opponent&#x27;s goal line. This is permitted only once during a scrimmage down by the offensive team before team possession has changed, provided the pass is thrown from behind the line of scrimmage; a pass is legal as long as some part of the passer&#x27;s body is behind the line of scrimmage. The person passing the ball must be a member of the offensive team, and the recipient of the forward pass must be an eligible receiver and must touch the passed ball before any ineligible player. An illegal forward pass can incur a yardage penalty and the loss of a down, although it may be legally intercepted by the opponents and advanced.

If an eligible receiver on the passing team legally catches the ball, the pass is completed and the receiver may attempt to advance the ball. If an opposing player legally catches the ball – all defensive players are eligible receivers – it is an interception. That player&#x27;s team immediately gains possession of the ball and he may attempt to advance the ball toward his opponent&#x27;s goal. If no player is able to legally catch the ball it is an incomplete pass and the ball becomes dead the moment it touches the ground. It will then be returned to the original line of scrimmage for the next down. If any player interferes with an eligible receiver&#x27;s ability to catch the ball it is pass interference which draws a penalty of varying degrees, depending upon the particular league&#x27;s rules.

The moment that a forward pass begins is important to the game. The pass begins the moment the passer&#x27;s arm begins to move forward. If the passer drops the ball before this moment it is a fumble and therefore a loose ball. In this case anybody can gain possession of the ball before or after it touches the ground. If the passer drops the ball while his arm is moving forward it is a forward pass, regardless of where the ball lands or is first touched. At some levels of play, a video replay may be required for the game&#x27;s officials to conclusively determine if a play is a fumble or a forward pass.

The quarterback generally either starts a few paces behind the line of scrimmage or drops back a few steps after the ball is snapped. This places him in an area called the &quot;pocket&quot;, which is a specific protective region formed by the offensive blockers up front and between the tackles on each side. A quarterback who runs out of this pocket is said to be scrambling. Under NFL and NCAA rules, once the quarterback moves out of the pocket the ball may be legally thrown away to prevent a sack. NFHS (high school) rules do not allow for a passer to intentionally throw an incomplete forward pass to save loss of yardage or conserve time, except for a spike to conserve time after a hand-to-hand snap. If he throws the ball away while still in the pocket then a foul called &quot;intentional grounding&quot; is assessed. In Canadian football the passer must simply throw the ball across the line of scrimmage – whether he is inside or outside of the &quot;pocket&quot;—to avoid the foul of &quot;intentionally grounding&quot;.

If a forward pass is caught near a sideline or endline it is a complete pass (or an interception) only if a receiver catches the ball &quot;in bounds&quot;. For a pass to be ruled complete in-bounds, either one or two feet must touch the ground within the field boundaries after the ball is first grasped, depending on the league rules. In the NFL the receiver must touch the ground with both feet, but in most other codes – CFL, NCAA and high school – one foot in bounds is sufficient.

Common to all gridiron codes is the notion of control: a receiver must demonstrate control of the ball in order to be ruled in &quot;possession&quot; of it, while still in bounds. If the receiver handles the ball but the official determines that he was still &quot;bobbling&quot; it prior to the end of the play, then the pass will be ruled incomplete. Similarly, if the receiver fails to continue to control the ball after falling to the ground, the pass may be ruled incomplete.

===Early illegal and experimental passes===
The forward pass had been attempted at least 30 years before the play was actually made legal. Passes &quot;had been carried out successfully but illegally several times, including the 1876 Yale–Princeton game in which Yale&#x27;s Walter Camp threw forward to teammate Oliver Thompson as he was being tackled. Princeton&#x27;s protest, one account said, went for naught when the referee &#x27;tossed a coin to make his decision and allowed the touchdown to stand&#x27; &quot;.

The University of North Carolina used the forward pass in an 1895 game against the University of Georgia. However, the play was still illegal at the time. Bob Quincy stakes Carolina&#x27;s claim in his 1973 book &quot;They Made the Bell Tower Chime&quot;:

In a 1905 experimental game at Wichita, Kansas, Washburn University and Fairmount College (what would become Wichita State) used the pass before new rules allowing the play were approved in early 1906. Credit for the first pass goes to Fairmount&#x27;s Bill Davis, who completed a pass to Art Solter.

1905 had been a bloody year on the gridiron; the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; reported 19 players had been killed and 159 seriously injured that season. There were moves to outlaw the game, but United States President Theodore Roosevelt personally intervened and demanded that the rules of the game be reformed. In a meeting of more than 60 schools in late 1905, the commitment was made to make the game safer. This meeting was the first step toward the establishment of what would become the NCAA and was followed by several sessions to work out &quot;the new rules&quot;.

The final meeting of the Rules Committee tasked with reshaping the game was held on April 6, 1906, at which time the forward pass officially became a legal play. &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported in September 1906 on the rationale for the changes: &quot;The main efforts of the football reformers have been to &#x27;open up the game&#x27;—that is to provide for the natural elimination of the so-called mass plays and bring about a game in which speed and real skill shall supersede so far as possible mere brute strength and force of weight.&quot; However, the &quot;Times&quot; also reflected widespread skepticism as to whether the forward pass could be effectively integrated into the game: &quot;There has been no team that has proved that the forward pass is anything but a doubtful, dangerous play to be used only in the last extremity.&quot; John Heisman was instrumental in the rules&#x27; acceptance.

In Canadian football, the first exhibition game using a forward pass was held on November 5, 1921, at McGill University in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, between the McGill Redmen football team and visiting American college football team the Syracuse Orangemen from Syracuse University. The game was organized by Frank Shaughnessy, the head coach of McGill. McGill player Robert &quot;Boo&quot; Anderson is credited with the first forward pass attempt in Canadian football history.

The forward pass was not officially allowed in Canadian football until 1929.

===First legal pass===

Most sources credit Saint Louis University&#x27;s Bradbury Robinson from Bellevue, Ohio with throwing the first legal forward pass. On September 5, 1906, in a game against Carroll College, Robinson&#x27;s first attempt at a forward pass fell incomplete and resulted in a turnover under the 1906 rules. In the same game, Robinson later completed a 20-yard touchdown pass to Jack Schneider. The 1906 Saint Louis University team, coached by Eddie Cochems, was undefeated at 11–0 and featured the most potent offense in the country, outscoring their opponents 407–11. Football authority and College Football Hall of Fame coach David M. Nelson wrote that &quot;E. B. Cochems is to forward passing what the Wright brothers are to aviation and Thomas Edison is to the electric light.&quot;

While Saint Louis University completed the first legal forward pass in the first half of September, this accomplishment was in part because most schools did not begin their football schedule until early October.

In 1952, football coach Amos Alonzo Stagg discounted accounts crediting any particular coach with being the innovator of the forward pass. Stagg noted that he had Walter Eckersall working on pass plays and saw Pomeroy Sinnock of Illinois throw many passes in 1906. Stagg summed up his view as follows: &quot;I have seen statements giving credit to certain people originating the forward pass. The fact is that all coaches were working on it. The first season, 1906, I personally had sixty-four different forward pass patterns.&quot; In 1954, Stagg disputed Cochems&#x27; claim to have invented the forward pass:
Stagg asserted that, as far back as 1894, before the rules committee even considered the forward pass, one of his players used to throw the ball &quot;like a baseball pitcher&quot;.

On the other hand, Hall of Fame coach Gus Dorais told the United Press that &quot;Eddie Cochems of the [Saint] Louis University team of 1906–07–08 deserves the full credit.&quot; Writing in &quot;Collier&#x27;s&quot; more than 20 years earlier, Dorais&#x27; Notre Dame teammate Knute Rockne acknowledged Cochems as the early leader in the use of the pass, observing, &quot;One would have thought that so effective a play would have been instantly copied and become the vogue. The East, however, had not learned much or cared much about Midwest and Western football. Indeed, the East scarcely realized that football existed beyond the Alleghanies ...&quot;
Once the 1906 season got underway, many programs began experimenting with the forward pass. On September 26, 1906, Villanova&#x27;s game against the Carlisle Indians was billed as &quot;the first real game of football under the new rules&quot;. In the first play from scrimmage after the opening kicks, Villanova completed a pass that &quot;succeeded in gaining ten yards&quot;. Following the Villanova-Carlisle game, &quot;The New York Times&quot; described the new passing game this way:

Another coach sometimes credited with popularizing the overhead spiral pass in 1906 is former Princeton All-American &quot;Bosey&quot; Reiter. Reiter claimed to have invented the overhead spiral pass while playing professional football as a player-coach for Connie Mack&#x27;s Philadelphia Athletics of the original National Football League (1902). While playing for the Athletics, Reiter was a teammate of Hawley Pierce, a former star for the Carlisle Indian School. Pierce, a Native American, taught Reiter to throw an underhand spiral pass, but Reiter had short arms and was unable to throw for distance from an underhand delivery. Accordingly, Reiter began working on an overhand spiral pass. Reiter recalled trying to imitate the motion of a baseball catcher throwing to second base. After practice and experimentation, Reiter &quot;discovered he could get greater distance and accuracy throwing that way&quot;. In 1906, Reiter was the head coach at Wesleyan University. In the opening game of the 1906 season against Yale, Reiter&#x27;s quarterback Sammy Moore completed a forward pass to Irvin van Tassell for a thirty-yard gain. &quot;The New York Times&quot; called it &quot;the prettiest play of the day&quot;, as Wesleyan&#x27;s quarterback &quot;deftly passed the ball past the whole Yale team to his mate Van Tassel&quot;. Van Tassel later described the historic play to the United Press:

The football season opened for most schools during the first week of October, and the impact of the forward pass was immediate:
* On October 3, 1906, the &quot;Des Moines Daily News&quot; reported &quot;probably the first use&quot; of the &quot;long forward pass&quot; in the University of Missouri&#x27;s 23–4 win over Kirksville Normal School.
* On October 4, 1906, Princeton opened its season with a 22–0 win over Stevens. Press accounts indicate that Princeton put the forward pass to good use, as &quot;old-time football gave way to the new game&quot;.
* On October 4, 1906, the Carlisle Indians beat Susquehanna University 40–0, as &quot;the forward pass was used for a number of good gains&quot;.
* On October 4, 1906, Harvard defeated Bowdoin 10–0 &quot;in a hard-fought contest that was featured by a newfangled and daring forward pass that Crimson worked in the closing minutes of play&quot;.
* On October 4, 1906, Williams College defeated the Massachusetts Agricultural College, scoring the game&#x27;s only touchdown on a forward pass by Waters.

Some publications credit Yale All-American Paul Veeder with the &quot;first forward pass in a major game&quot;. Veeder threw a 20- to 30-yard completion in leading Yale past Harvard 6–0 before 32,000 fans in New Haven on November 24, 1906. However, that Yale/Harvard game was played three weeks after St. Louis completed 45- and 48-yard passes against Kansas before a crowd of 7,000 at Sportsman&#x27;s Park.

===New style of play===

The forward pass was a central feature of Cochems&#x27; offensive scheme in 1906 as his St. Louis University team compiled an undefeated 11–0 season in which they outscored opponents by a combined score 407 to 11. The highlight of the campaign was St. Louis&#x27; 39–0 win over Iowa. Cochems&#x27; team reportedly completed eight passes in ten attempts for four touchdowns. &quot;The average flight distance of the passes was twenty yards.&quot; Nelson continues, &quot;the last play demonstrated the dramatic effect that the forward pass was having on football. St. Louis was on Iowa&#x27;s thirty-five-yard line with a few seconds to play. Timekeeper Walter McCormack walked onto the field to end the game when the ball was thrown twenty-five yards and caught on the dead run for a touchdown.&quot;

The 1906 Iowa game was refereed by one of the top football officials in the country, West Point&#x27;s Lt. Horatio B. &quot;Stuffy&quot; Hackett. He had officiated games involving the top Eastern powers that year. Hackett, who would become a member of the football rules committee in December 1907 and officiated games into the 1930s, was quoted the next day in Ed Wray&#x27;s &quot;Globe-Democrat&quot; article: &quot;It was the most perfect exhibition ... of the new rules ... that I have seen all season and much better than that of Yale and Harvard. St. Louis&#x27; style of pass differs entirely from that in use in the east. ... The St. Louis university players shoot the ball hard and accurately to the man who is to receive it ... The fast throw by St. Louis enables the receiving player to dodge the opposing players, and it struck me as being all but perfect.&quot;

Hackett is the only known expert witness to the passing offenses of both Cochems&#x27; 1906 squads and that of Stagg, who dismissed any special role for the St. Louis coach in the development of the pass. Hackett was an official in games involving both teams. As Wray recalled almost 40 years later: &quot;Hackett told this writer that in no other game that he handled had he seen the forward pass as used by St. Louis U. nor such bewildering variations of it.&quot;

&quot;Cochems said that the poor Iowa showing resulted from its use of the old style play and its failure to effectively use the forward pass&quot;, Nelson writes. &quot;Iowa did attempt two basketball-style forward passes.&quot;

&quot;During the 1906 season [Robinson] threw a sixty-seven yard pass ... and ... Schneider tossed a sixty-five yarder. Considering the size, shape and weight of the ball, these were extraordinary passes.&quot;

In 1907, after the first season of the forward pass, one football writer noted that, &quot;with the single exception of Cochems, football teachers were groping in the dark.&quot;

Because St. Louis was geographically isolated from both the dominant teams and the major sports media (newspapers) of the era, all centered in and focused on the East, Cochems&#x27; groundbreaking offensive strategy was not picked up by the major teams. Pass-oriented offenses would not be adopted by the Eastern football powers until the next decade.

But that does not mean that other teams in the Midwest did not pick it up. Arthur Schabinger, quarterback for the College of Emporia in Kansas, was reported to have regularly used the forward pass in 1910. Coach H. W. &quot;Bill&quot; Hargiss&#x27; &quot;Presbies&quot; are said to have featured the play in a 17–0 victory over Washburn University and in a 107–0 destruction of Pittsburg State University. Coach Pop Warner at Carlisle had quarterback Frank Mount Pleasant, one of the first regular spiral pass quarterbacks in football.

===Knute Rockne===
Knute Rockne and Gus Dorais worked on the pass while lifeguarding on a Lake Erie beach at Cedar Point in Sandusky, Ohio, during the summer of 1913. That year, Jesse Harper, Notre Dame head coach, also showed how the pass could be used by a smaller team to beat a bigger one, first utilizing it to defeat rival Army. After it was used against a major school on a national stage in this game, the forward pass rapidly gained popularity.

The 1919 and 1920 Notre Dame teams had George Gipp, an ideal handler of the forward pass, who threw for 1,789 yards.

John Mohardt led the 1921 Notre Dame team to a 10–1 record with 781 rushing yards, 995 passing yards, 12 rushing touchdowns, and nine passing touchdowns. Grantland Rice wrote that &quot;Mohardt could throw the ball to within a foot or two of any given space&quot; and noted that the 1921 team was the first at Notre Dame &quot;to build its attack around a forward passing game, rather than use a forward passing game as a mere aid to the running game.&quot; Mohardt had both Eddie Anderson and Roger Kiley at end to receive his passes.

===Increase in popularity===

From 1915 to 1916, Pudge Wyman and end Bert Baston of Minnesota were &quot;one of the greatest forward-passing combinations in the history of the gridiron&quot;.

In the 1921 Rose Bowl, California&#x27;s Brick Muller completed a touchdown against Washington &amp; Jefferson which went 53 yards in the air, a feat previously thought impossible.

In a 1925, 62–13 victory over Cornell, Dartmouth&#x27;s Andy Oberlander had 477 yards in total offense, including six touchdown passes, a Dartmouth record which still stands.

The 1925 Michigan team was coach Fielding H. Yost&#x27;s favorite and featured the passing tandem of Benny Friedman and Bennie Oosterbaan.

Yost disciple Dan McGugin coached Vanderbilt and was one of the first emphasize the forward pass. His 1907 team beat Sewanee on a double pass play Grantland Rice cited as his biggest thrill in his years of watching sports. McGugin&#x27;s 1927 team was piloted by Bill Spears, who threw for over a thousand yards. According to one writer, Vanderbilt produced &quot;almost certainly the legit top Heisman candidate in Spears, if there had been a Heisman Trophy to award in 1927&quot;. McGugin disciple and former quarterback Ray Morrison brought the pass to the southwest when he coached Gerald Mann at Southern Methodist.

===First pass in a professional game===
The first forward pass in a professional football game may have been thrown in an Ohio League game played on October 25, 1906. The Ohio League, which traced its history to the 1890s, was a direct predecessor of the NFL. According to Robert W. Peterson in his book &quot;Pigskin The Early Years of Pro Football&quot;, the &quot;passer was George W. (Peggy) Parratt, probably the best quarterback of the era&quot;, who played for the Massillon, Ohio Tigers, one of pro football&#x27;s first franchises. Citing the Professional Football Researchers Association as his source, Peterson writes that &quot;Parratt completed a short pass to end Dan Riley (real name, Dan Policowski)&quot; in a game played at Massillon against a team from West Virginia. Since the Tigers &quot;ran up a 61 to 0 score on the hapless Mountain Staters, the pass played no important part in the result&quot;.

According to National Football League history, it legalized the forward pass from anywhere behind the line of scrimmage on February 25, 1933. Before that rule change, a forward pass had to be made from 5 or more yards behind the line of scrimmage.

Forward passes were first permitted in Canadian football in 1929, but the tactic remained a minor part of the game for several years. Jack Jacobs of the Winnipeg Blue Bombers is recognized, not for inventing the forward pass, but for popularizing it in the Western Interprovincial Football Union (one of the forerunner leagues to the modern Canadian Football League) in the early 1950s, thus changing the Canadian game from a more run-dominated game to a more passing-dominant game.

===Change in ball shape===
Specification of the size of the ball for the American game came in 1912, but it was still essentially a rugby ball. Increased use of the forward pass encouraged adoption of a narrower ball, starting with changes in the 1920s which enhanced rifled throwing and also spiral punting. This had the consequence of all but eliminating the drop kick from the American game.

==Rugby football==
In the two codes of rugby (union and league), a forward pass is against the rules. Normally this results in a scrum to the opposing team, but on rare occasions a penalty may be awarded if the referee is of the belief that the ball was deliberately thrown forward.

In both codes of rugby the direction of the pass is relative to the player making the pass and not to the actual path relative to the ground. A forward pass occurs when the player passes the ball forward in relation to himself. (This applies only to the movement of the player, not to the direction in which the passer is facing, i.e. if the player is facing backwards and passes toward their team&#x27;s goal area, it is not forward; and conversely, if the player passes toward the opponent&#x27;s goal area, it is forward.) In rugby league, the video referee may not make judgements on whether a pass is forward.

The garryowen, as well as the cross-field kick, while not as reliable as the forward pass and more difficult to execute successfully, can provide some of the function that a forward pass does in American and Canadian football.

==Other football codes==
In some other football codes, such as association football (soccer), Australian rules football and Gaelic football, the kicked forward pass is used so ubiquitously that it is not thought of as a distinct kind of play at all. In association football and its variants, the concept of offside is used to regulate who can be in front of the play or be nearest to the goal. Historically some earlier incarnations of football allowed unlimited forward passing, and present-day Australian rules football and Gaelic football do not have an offside rule.

<text>Telecommunications in Fiji include radio, television, fixed and mobile telephones, and the Internet.

==Radio and television==

* Radio stations: 
** state-owned commercial company, Fiji Broadcasting Corporation, operates 6 radio stations - 2 public broadcasters and 4 commercial broadcasters with multiple repeaters; 5 radio stations with repeaters operated by Communications Fiji, Ltd; transmissions of multiple international broadcasters are available (2009);

===Media control===
Under the military government&#x27;s Media Decree, the directors and 90 percent of the shareholders of locally based media must be citizens of, and permanently reside in Fiji. The Media Industry Development Authority of Fiji is responsible for enforcing these provisions. The authority has the power to investigate journalists and media outlets for alleged violations of the decree, including powers of search and seizure of equipment.

A code of ethics contained in the Media Decree requires that all stories run by the media be balanced, with comment obtained from both sides where there is any disagreement on the facts. This requirement enables government departments and private businesses to prevent stories from being published by not responding to media questions, thus making it impossible for the media to fulfill the decree&#x27;s requirement for comment from both sides. However, media sources report that if the story is positive toward the government, the balance requirement could be ignored without consequence.

=== Labasa-Savusavu Fiber Project ===
Launched in 2023, Telecom Fiji&#x27;s $4.1 million Fiber Project is designed to expand the underground fiber optic network from Labasa to Savusavu, with the aim of improving internet services in Fiji&#x27;s Northern regions.

The project&#x27;s significance lies in its potential to address the limitations of the existing microwave link-based connectivity in Vanua Levu, which is vulnerable to disruptions, particularly during natural disasters. By reinforcing the communications network with fiber optic technology, the initiative is expected to contribute to the resilience and economic development of the Northern Division.

===Internet censorship and surveillance===

The government in a parliament sitting on March 15, 2018, passed a bill known as the Online Safety Bill to the Standing Committee on Justice, Law and Human Rights that was tabled in the Parliament of Fiji to enforce tougher restrictions on those that may share explicit photos of individuals on social media or spread anti- government remarks as well.

Currently, there are no government restrictions on general public access to the Internet, but evidence suggests that the government monitors private e-mails of citizens as well as Internet traffic in an attempt to control antigovernment reports by anonymous bloggers.

The country has operated under a military-led government since 2006 and has had no constitution or functioning parliament since 2009. A series of decrees have been issued, including the Public Order Amendment Decree (POAD), the Media Decree, and the Crime Decree.

By decree all telephone and Internet service users must register their personal details with telephone and Internet providers, including their name, birth date, home address, left thumbprint, and photographic identification. The decree imposes fines of up to F$100,000 ($56,721) on providers who continue to provide services to unregistered users and up to F$10,000 ($5,672) on users who do not update their registration information as required. Vodafone, one of two mobile telephone providers, also requires users to register their nationality, postal address, employment details, and both thumbprints.

The POAD gives the government the power to detain persons on suspicion of &quot;endangering public safety or the preservation of the peace&quot;; defines terrorism as any act designed to advance a political, religious, or ideological cause that could &quot;reasonably be regarded&quot; as intended to compel a government to do or refrain from doing any act or to intimidate the public or a section thereof; and makes religious vilification and attempts to sabotage or undermine the economy offenses punishable by a maximum F$10,000 ($5,672) fine or five years’ imprisonment. The Media Decree prohibits &quot;irresponsible reporting&quot; and provides for government censorship of the media. The Crimes Decree includes criticism of the government in its definition of the crime of sedition, including statements made in other countries by any person, who can be prosecuted on return to Fiji. The government uses the threat of prosecution under these provisions to intimidate government critics and limit public criticism of the government. Journalists and media organizations practice varying degrees of self-censorship, with many reportedly fearing retribution if they criticize the government.

In May 2007 it was reported that the military in Fiji had blocked access to blogs critical of the regime.

In 2012 police investigated former University of the South Pacific (USP) professor Wadan Narsey, a prominent Fijian economist and long-time critic of the military government, for alleged sedition in writings published on his personal blog.

The POAD permits military personnel to search persons and premises without a warrant from a court and to take photographs, fingerprints, and measurements of any person. Police and military officers may enter private premises to break up any meeting considered unlawful.

==Fiji Infantry Regiment==

The Fiji Infantry Regiment is the main combat element of the Republic of Fiji Military Forces. The regiment was formed with the foundation of the Fijian armed forces in 1920. The regiment, as it is today, goes back to 1978 following Fiji&#x27;s independence.

== Fijian Navy ==

The Republic of Fiji Navy was formed in 1975, following the government&#x27;s ratification of the United Nations Law of the Sea convention. The Navy is responsible for maritime needs in border control, such as watching over Fiji&#x27;s exclusive economic zone and organising task and rescue missions. It currently operates 9 patrol boats. Military aid is received from Australia, the People&#x27;s Republic of China, and the United Kingdom (although the latter has suspended aid as a result of the 2006 military coup against the civilian government).

Speaking at 30th anniversary celebrations on 26 July 2006, Commander Bradley Bower said that the greatest challenge facing the navy of a maritime country like Fiji was to maintain sovereignty and the maritime environment, to acquire, restore, and replace equipment, and to train officers to keep pace with changing situations.

In January 2019 five of Fiji&#x27;s naval vessels were operational. In 2020, Australia provided two new s to replace the three vessels it provided over thirty years ago In December 2019, Fiji took delivery of , boosting the number of operational vessels to six. The Guardian-class patrol boat was officially handed over to Fijian officials, in Henderson, Australia, on 6 March 2020.

Northern Air operates search and rescue flights for the Navy. 

===Equipment===

3 x (Australia, displacement 162 t, length , width draught , power 2 x , maximal speed , crew 17-man, armament machine guns 1 x 12.7 mm). These boats replaced discharged s FNS &quot;Kula&quot;, &quot;Kikau&quot; and &quot;Kiro&quot;, gained 1975 – 1976 from the United States Navy.

==History==

=== Political intervention ===

Fiji&#x27;s military has a history of political intervention. In 1987, soldiers were responsible for two military coups, and in 2000, the military organised a countercoup to quash George Speight&#x27;s civilian coup. Since 2000, the military has had a sometimes tense relationship with the Qarase government, and has strongly opposed its plans to establish a Commission with the power to compensate victims and pardon perpetrators of the coup. Among other objections, the military claims that its integrity and discipline would be undermined if soldiers who mutinied in the 2000 upheaval were to be pardoned.

On 4 August 2005, Opposition Leader Mahendra Chaudhry called for more Indo-Fijians, who presently comprise less than one percent of the military personnel, to be recruited. (Specifically, as of October 2007, Fiji&#x27;s military had 3527 full-time members, of whom only 15 were Indo-Fijians.) This would help guarantee political stability, he considered. He also spoke against government plans to downsize the military. Military spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Orisi Rabukawaqa responded the next day by saying that the military was not an ethnic Fijian body, that it stood to serve the entire nation, and that there was no colour bar in its recruitment or promotion. He said that many Indo-Fijians had been reluctant to commit themselves to a military career because of the slow progress of promotion, often preferring to be discharged and to use their record as a stepping stone to a successful career in some other field. Nevertheless, he appreciated the Indo-Fijian contribution to the military, and noted the success of Lieutenant Colonel Mohammed Aziz, the head of the military&#x27;s legal unit who was a pivotal figure in the court martial of soldiers who mutinied in 2000. Ironically the rate of promotion of indigenous Fijian officers had been very rapid after the 1987 coup, and subsequent expansion of the Republic of Fiji Military Forces.

On 26 August 2005, the government announced plans to study ways to reduce the size of the military. Military engineers would be transferred to the Regional Development Ministry, said Home Affairs Minister Josefa Vosanibola, and the reduction of the military forces would coincide with an increase in the numbers of the police force.

On 26 September 2005, Rabukawaqa revealed that the military had decided to curtail certain operations to stay within its budget. The cuts would affect maritime patrols, search and rescue operations, training and exercises, School Cadet training, and the deployment of military engineers to rural areas. These cuts would be made to ensure that activities accorded a higher priority, such as peacekeeping operations in the Sinai Peninsula and Iraq, officer cadet training with the New Zealand Defence Forces, and the prosecution of soldiers charged with mutiny, would not be affected, Rabukawaqa said.

The next day, Lesi Korovavala, chief executive officer of the Ministry of Home Affairs, told the Fiji Village news service that the military had undertaken the reductions on its own initiative, in consultation with the department, an explanation corroborated by Lieutenant Colonel Rabukawaqa.

On 5 December 2006, the Fijian army staged a third coup d&#x27;état. On 7 February 2008, the head of the RFMF and post-coup interim Prime Minister Voreqe Bainimarama stated: &quot;Qarase [...] does not understand the role of the Military and as such is misinforming the nation. [...] [I]f there are practices and policies which have potential to undermine the national security and territorial integrity of Fiji, the RFMF has every right under the Constitution to intervene.&quot; In August 2009, with Bainimarama still controlling the government as prime minister and the constitution abrogated, Epeli Nailatikau, a former military commander, was appointed acting president on the retirement of Iloilo.

===Operations===

Fiji committed troops to the United Nations Assistance Mission for Iraq. Australia agreed to transport those troops.

Fiji sent 54 individuals to Australia, to help fight wildfires there.

=== Fiji Air Wing ===

The Air Wing of the Republic of Fiji Military Forces, founded in 1987, had a base at the airport in Nausori, but was abolished in 1997. Yehonatan Shimʻon Frenḳel writes that the &quot;Air Wing was formed after the 1987 coup, when the French provided two helicopters as part of its military aid package.&quot; Frenkel goes on to say that the air wing was disbanded after both helicopters crashed and after subsequent revelations of huge debts incurred as a result of the aircraft.

==== Aircraft ====

The two helicopters were:

Helicopter AS-365 N2 Dauphin crashed off the coast of the main island in July 1994; a smaller AS-355F-2 continued in service until mid-1997 and in 1999 was sold to France.

The Air Wing did not have its own roundel or ensign and its only marking was the national flag used as a fin flash.

<text>Fiji has experienced many coups recently, in 1987, 2000, and 2006. Fiji has been suspended various times from the Commonwealth of Nations, a grouping of mostly former British colonies. It was readmitted to the Commonwealth in December 2001, following the parliamentary election held to restore democracy in September that year, and has been suspended again because of the 2006 coup, but has been readmitted a second time after the 2014 election. Other Pacific Island governments have generally been sympathetic to Fiji&#x27;s internal political problems and have declined to take public positions.

Fiji became the 127th member of the United Nations on 13 October 1970, and participates actively in the organization. Fiji&#x27;s contributions to UN peacekeeping are unique for a nation of its size. A nation with a population of less than one million, it maintains nearly 1,000 soldiers overseas in UN peacekeeping missions, mainly in the Middle East.

Since Fiji&#x27;s independence, the country has been a leader in the South Pacific region, and has played a leading role in the formation of the South Pacific Forum. Fiji has championed causes of common interest to Pacific Island countries.

Since 2005, Fiji has become embroiled in a number of disagreements with other countries, including Australia, China, New Zealand, South Korea, the United States, and Vanuatu.

The country&#x27;s foreign relations and diplomatic missions are maintained by its Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation.

==Diplomatic relations list==
List of countries which Fiji maintains diplomatic relations with:
==Bilateral relations==

== Fijian missions abroad ==

Fiji maintains direct diplomatic or consular relations with countries with historical, cultural, or trading ties to Fiji; Ambassadors stationed in such countries are often accredited to neighbouring countries. Fiji maintains embassies in Belgium (taking care of Fiji&#x27;s relations with the entire European Union), China, Japan, South Korea, and the United States; and High Commissions in Australia, India, Malaysia, Papua New Guinea, the United Kingdom and New Zealand (in keeping with the Commonwealth practice of calling missions in fellow-commonwealth countries High Commissions rather than Embassies). Fiji also has a Permanent Mission to the United Nations.

== Foreign reaction to Fijian legislation ==
Australia and New Zealand have both expressed concern over legislation currently before the Fijian Parliament (as of June 2005), which proposes to establish a Reconciliation and Unity Commission, with the power (subject to presidential approval) to compensate victims and pardon persons convicted of crimes related to the coup d&#x27;état which deposed the elected government in 2000.

On 30 August 2005, the then Commonwealth Secretary-General Don McKinnon called on the Fijian government to ensure that the legislation reflected the views of its citizens. He emphasized, however, that the Commonwealth did not have a position on the bill.

<doc id="10664" wikidata="Q25040" url="?curid=10664" title="Goal line (gridiron football)">
<text>The goal line is the chalked or painted line dividing the end zone from the field of play in gridiron football. In American football the goal lines run parallel to the end lines, while in Canadian football they run parallel to the dead lines. In both football codes the distance is measured from the inside edge of the end line to the far edge of the goal line so that the line itself is part of the end zone. It is the line that must be crossed in order to score a touchdown.

If any part of the ball reaches any part of the imaginary vertical plane transected by this line while in-bounds and in possession of a player whose team is striving toward that end of the field, this is considered a touchdown and scores six points for the team whose player has advanced the ball to, or recovered the ball in, this position. This is in contrast with other sports like Association football and ice hockey, which require the puck or ball to pass completely over the goal line to count as a score.

If any member of the offensive team is downed while in possession of the ball behind his own team&#x27;s goal line, this is called a safety and scores two points for the defensive team.

If, during the course of play, a loose ball travels past the goal line and is recovered within the end zone, then it is a touchdown if recovered by the team that scores in that end zone, or a touchback if recovered and downed by the opposing team

In the event of a kick recovered in one&#x27;s own end zone, the entirety of the ball must pass the goal line in order for the ball to be considered a touchback, and to not be in the field of play.

<doc id="10667" wikidata="Q1545990" url="?curid=10667" title="Tackle (football move)">
<text>Most forms of football have a move known as a tackle. The primary purposes of tackling are to dispossess an opponent of the ball, to stop the player from gaining ground towards goal or to stop them from carrying out what they intend.

The word is used in some contact variations of football to describe the act of physically holding or wrestling a player to the ground. In others, it simply describes one or more methods of contesting for possession of the ball. It can therefore be used as both a defensive or attacking move.

== Name origin ==
In Middle Dutch, the verb meant to grab or to handle. By the 14th century, this had come to be used for the equipment used for fishing, referring to the rod and reel, etc., and also for that used in sailing, referring to rigging, equipment, or gear used on ships. By the 18th century, a similar use was applied to harnesses or equipment used with horses. Modern use in football comes from the earlier sport of rugby, where the word was used in the 19th century.

== Association football ==
Unlike other codes, tackles in association football have to be predominantly directed against the ball rather than the player in possession of it. This is achieved by using either leg to wrest possession from the opponent, or sliding in on the grass to knock the ball away. A defender is permitted to use their body to obstruct the motion of a player with the ball, and this may be part of a successful tackle. Pulling a player to the ground in the style of tackle common to other codes is completely absent from the game (this would be considered &quot;violent conduct&quot; and result in a red card (dismissal)).

Although some contact between players is allowed, the rules of association football significantly limit the physicality of tackles, explicitly forbidding contacts which are &quot;careless, reckless or [use] excessive force&quot;. Almost all tackles where the tackler&#x27;s legs make contact with the opponent before the ball are considered illegal, and heavy contact after initially touching the ball may also be penalised.

Illegal tackles are fouls and are punished with a direct free kick (or penalty if committed within the penalty area) for the opponent&#x27;s team. Such incidents are common, with dozens of occurrences in a typical match. In most cases these fouls are not considered misconducts, however yellow cards (cautions) may be delivered for more egregious fouls that constitute &quot;unsporting behaviour&quot;. If a foul tackle endangers the tackled player&#x27;s safety, it is likely to be considered as &quot;serious foul play&quot; by the referee and punished with a red card (dismissal).
Tackles that involve lunging at an opponent with both legs, regardless of whether the ball is won, are generally considered to constitute serious foul play and hence result in a sending-off. This explicitly includes &quot;scissoring&quot; (tackling with legs apart, so as to trap the opponent&#x27;s leg or legs in between), which is likely to be punished with a sending-off (red card), as it poses a high risk of severe knee injury to the player being tackled. Tackling with &quot;studs up&quot; is considered dangerous. A &quot;studs up tackle&quot; is made when a player lunges into a tackle with a leg or both legs outstretched exposing the soles of their boots. Referees are encouraged to at the very least caution (yellow card) players who commit such challenges.

Additionally, an illegal tackle which is also a professional foul is considered misconduct.

The most spectacular form of tackle in association football is the slide tackle, wherein a tackler slides, leg extended, along the ground, aiming to hit the ball away. This form of tackle carries a high risk of committing a foul.

&quot;Diving&quot; in association football involves tackled players exaggerating the physicality of tackles, so as to gain favourable decisions from the referee.

== Australian rules football ==
In Australian rules football, the move commonly described as a &quot;tackle&quot; is similar to in rugby and involves wrapping, holding or wrestling a player who has possession of the ball to the ground. Tackling players not in possession of the ball is not allowed, this is considered “holding the man” and penalised with a free kick to the opposition.

As there is no offside rule in Australian rules football, players can be tackled from any direction, and are often blindsided. For this reason, the sport allows players to shepherd and bump their opponents within 5 metres of the ball, to protect the ball carrier.

A tackled player must immediately dispose of the ball legally, by kicking or handballing, but not by throwing or dropping the ball. If this is not done, a holding the ball free kick will be awarded to the tackler. If the ball is knocked free by the tackler, pinned to the player by the tackler, or the player unsuccessfully attempts a kick or handball, a free kick will only be awarded if the ball carrier is deemed to have had a prior opportunity to dispose of the ball prior to being tackled. If a player has not had prior opportunity to dispose of the ball and a tackler knocks the ball free during a tackle then no free kick is paid and the game continues.

A tackle must only contact below the shoulders and above the knees, and a player is able to be thrown to the ground, so long as the tackle is deemed not to be reckless or likely to cause injury. There are also rules outlawing pushing in the back making tackling more difficult. Tripping, by both hand or foot, is not allowed and can be a reportable offence.

Players wear little to no padding to cushion the impact of tackles, however players generally wear mouthguards to protect their teeth.

=== Types of tackles in Australian rules ===

There are many types of tackles in Australian rules football:
* perfect tackle – when a player lays a tackle on an opponent that has had prior opportunity to dispose of the ball and in the process makes it impossible for their opponent to dispose of the ball. For example, if a tackler pins an opponent&#x27;s arm, then the opponent cannot possibly handball, and if they pin both arms, then it is nearly impossible to legally execute a kick. A player is almost always rewarded for a perfect tackle (except in the case of a slam tackle – see below).
* gang tackle – when the player in possession is tackled by more than one opponent at the same time.
* high tackle – any tackle which infringes on the opponent&#x27;s neck or head. This includes any tackle which slips above the A/C joint. This is illegal and the penalty is a free kick.
* coathanger – slang for high contact to the head, usually by a stiff arm, which causes a player to land flat on their back. It is often accidental due to the high pace of the game. The penalty may be a free kick if deemed accidental or a reportable offence which may result in suspension.
* diving tackle – when a player leaves the ground in attempting to tackle
* slinging – a player &quot;slung&quot; to the ground in a tackle
* broken tackle – when a player is able to break free of a tackle
* spear tackle – also known as a dangerous throw in rugby, it is a reportable offence and may result in suspension
* push in the back – Any tackle which forces the player forward, into the ground, or both, from behind. This is an illegal tackle and the penalty is a free kick.
* &quot;bump&quot; or hip and shoulder tackle is a legal Aussie rules tactic for both dispossession of the player with the ball and also impeding players involved in a contest but not in possession of the ball. The difference between a bump and a tackle is that arms are not used in a bump, which must be made side-on using the hip and or shoulder. Not all bumping is legal, however. Aggressive head on bumping or &quot;charging&quot; of a player with the ball is often described as &quot;rough play&quot; and is a reportable offence, this is particularly so if a player is deemed to have their head down over the ball in an attempt to picking it up off the ground when the bump is applied or contact is made above the shoulders. Standing ground against an oncoming player, however, is legal.
* slam tackle – relatively new term for a tackle which results in an opponent&#x27;s head being deliberately slammed to the ground. It is often associated with the pinning of the arms of an opponent so that they cannot cushion the impact of their head on the ground. Although tolerated in days gone by in recent years, in 2009, the AFL branded this a dangerous type of tackle. Incidents in the professional AFL involving Byron Pickett and Darren Milburn have come under particular scrutiny.
* wing tackle or Chicken wing tackle – when one arm is pinned in a tackle. After sustaining severe damage from this type of tackle during the 2009 AFL season, Brent Harvey called for this type of tackle to be banned.

=== Other tackling methods ===
Although the term &quot;tackle&quot; is used in Australian rules to exclusively describe wrapping, holding or wrestling a player in possession, there are also several other ways of contesting possession in Australian rules that other sports would describe as a &quot;tackle&quot; and that also involve a degree of contact.

Other defensive actions are generally categorised as &quot;one percenters&quot;. The defensive tactic of punching away (commonly known as spoiling) from a player is allowed. &quot;Smothering&quot;, which involves using the arms or body to get in the way of an opponent&#x27;s kick as it leaves their boot, is similar to a &quot;charge down&quot; in rugby football.

== Gaelic football ==
Gaelic football defines tackling as wresting the ball from an opponent&#x27;s hands. Bumping is allowed on the player with the ball, but a player cannot be grabbed.

==Gridiron football==

In American football and Canadian football, to tackle is to physically interfere with the forward progress of a player in possession of the ball, such that his forward progress ceases and is not resumed, or such that he is caused to touch some part of his body to the ground other than his feet or hands, or such that he is forced to go out of bounds. In any such case, the ball becomes dead, the down is over, and play ceases until the beginning of the next play.

A tackle is known as a quarterback sack when the quarterback is tackled at or behind the line of scrimmage while attempting to throw a pass. A tackle for loss is a tackle that causes a loss of yardage for the opposing running back or wide receiver. This happens when the quarterback is sacked, when either a rusher or a receiver is tackled behind the line of scrimmage, or when the ball is fumbled behind the line of scrimmage and was picked up by an offensive player who does not manage to move past the line before being tackled. When a player who does not have the ball is taken down, it is generally referred to as a block.

Tacklers are not required to wrap their arms around the ball carrier before bringing him to the ground; in fact, the ball carrier is often &quot;tackled&quot; by the defender taking a running start and hitting the ball carrier to knock them to the ground. Tackles can also be made by grabbing the ball carrier&#x27;s jersey (or even hair, should it be long enough and allowed to dangle freely from beneath the helmet) and pulling him to the ground. As mentioned above, the referee can declare that a play is dead if the ball carrier&#x27;s forward progress has been stopped, even if he has not actually been taken to the ground.

To protect players from potentially catastrophic injury, there are some restrictions on tackles and blocks. At no time may a defensive player tackle an offensive player by grabbing the facemask of their helmet; doing so incurs a 15-yard penalty and the victimized team is awarded a new set of downs. Although spear tackles are allowed in gridiron football, a player may not use his helmet to tackle an opponent as the technique can cause serious injury to both players (more often the tackler, due to the force of reaction on the tackler, which is apt to be beyond the limit that the neck can handle) and also warrants a 15-yard penalty as well as a fresh set of downs if committed by the defending team; this is known as &quot;spearing the player&quot;. A similar penalty is assessed to any player attempting to make contact with his helmet against another opponent&#x27;s helmet, which is known as a helmet-to-helmet collision. Grabbing a ball carrier by the pads behind his neck and pulling him down is known as a &quot;horse collar&quot;, a method which has been made illegal at all levels of American football.

It is also illegal to tackle a player who has thrown a forward pass (generally a quarterback) after he has released the ball; doing so is called &quot;roughing the passer&quot; and incurs a 15-yard penalty and a fresh set of downs for the team with the ball. However, in the NFL a player can continue forward for one step, which means that often a player who is committed to attacking the quarterback will still make a tackle. Place kickers and punters are afforded an even greater protection from being tackled.

Once the play is ruled complete, no contact is permitted; a player who makes contact with an opponent after the play is charged with &quot;unnecessary roughness&quot; and his team is assessed a 15-yard penalty.

Blocks that occur in the back of the legs and below the knees, initiated below the waist, or clotheslines are also generally prohibited and players who use them are subject to much more severe penalties than other illegal tackles. However, a player who plays on the line &quot;can&quot; block below the knees (cut block) as long the block is within five yards of the line and the player they block is in front of them and not engaged by another blocker (chop block).

In the National Football League (NFL), tackles are tracked as an unofficial statistic by a scorekeeper hired by the home team. Though the statistic is widely cited, the league does not verify that the counts are accurate.

On November 12, 2022, Carlton Martial of Troy recorded his 546th tackle to break the Division I FBS record for most tackles in a career.

== International rules football ==
International rules football is a hybrid game between Australian rules football and Gaelic football.
Tackling in International Rules is subject to similar rules as Australian rules football, but with some subtle differences. Tackling is only allowed as low as the waist, whereas it is allowed down to the knees in Aussie Rules. One handed tackling has been banned in International Rules since the 2008 International Rules Series.

==Rugby football==
===Rugby league===
In rugby league the ball-carrier can be tackled by any number of defenders from any direction. The initial contact in the tackle must be made below the ball carrier&#x27;s neck or it will be deemed a high tackle and penalised. A tackle in rugby league is completed when any of the following occurs:
*The attacking player&#x27;s ball or the hand or arm holding the ball comes into contact with the ground while still held by one or more defenders.
*Although still on his feet, the attacking player&#x27;s forward momentum has ceased while still held by one or more defender.
*Being held by a defender, the attacking player makes it evident that he has succumbed to the tackle and wishes to be released in order to play-the-ball.
*A defender places a hand on the attacking player lying on the ground.

Once the tackle is completed, the ball-carrier must be allowed to get to his feet to &#x27;play-the-ball&#x27; and the defensive team must retreat 10 metres (except 2 markers, facing the tackled player). Spear tackles are illegal in rugby league, with most tackles in which the defender is lifted &#x27;above the horizontal&#x27; bringing about penalties in the modern game. A stiff arm tackle is an offence. A 2012 New Zealand study found that over 659 tackles are made per game in professional rugby league. Of all the rugby league positions, averages the most tackles.

===Rugby union===
In rugby union, a player must be brought to ground for a tackle to be completed. The tackled player must release the ball, but the ball is not dead and a &quot;ruck&quot; forms to contest possession of it. If the ball carrier is not brought to the ground a &quot;maul&quot; will usually form. High/reckless or stiff arm tackles laws once dictated any contact made above the shoulders was an offence. Now, even if contact starts below the shoulders, if the head is involved in any reckless tackle it results in the offending player being given a yellow card and therefore sin binned. World Rugby now defines a reckless tackle as being any contact where the tackler &quot;knew or should have known that there was a risk of making contact with the head of an opponent, but did so anyway&quot;

== Non-tackling variants ==
For various codes of football, variant codes have been developed which substitute out the tackling element, making the game less physical. In these games, either a being touched by an opponent or, in some codes, having a tag on the player&#x27;s person removed, has effects similar to a tackle in the parent code.
==Other uses==
Other non-football games that feature ball-tackling or similar concepts include hurling, hockey and shinty, while tackling of people is featured in games like kabaddi. With the increasing popularity of football in the late 19th century, tackling had been integrated into field-based chasing games such as British Bulldog (game), Pom-Pom-Pull-Away and British Bulldog. For younger boys, these children&#x27;s games became essential for the acquisition of football skills.

== Tackle types ==
Some illegal tackle moves result in a penalty play, however others may be &quot;reportable&quot; offences — that is, the option exists for an official to penalise a player&#x27;s conduct individually rather than during the game refer it to a tribunal for deferred penalty.

;Notes
==Controversial techniques==
* spear tackle (dangerous throw) – (illegal in both rugby codes and Australian rules)
* high tackle (illegal head-high tackle) – rugby league and Australian rules (see also coathanger)
* grapple tackle – a controversial rugby league tackling technique similar to a chokehold.
* chicken wing tackle – banned in rugby league
* horse-collar tackle – banned in gridiron football by the NFL, the NCAA, and the CFL. This tackle involves the defender reaching his hand inside the ball carrier&#x27;s collar, grabbing the collar (and usually, the collar of the shoulder pads), and pulling player straight down or backwards and down. The tackle has the potential to cause severe injuries to the tackled player&#x27;s neck, legs and ankles. It is considered an &quot;equipment tackle&quot;, meaning the protective equipment used by the players is what is used to make the tackle (similarly, a face-mask tackle is considered an &quot;equipment tackle&quot;). The horse-collar was made infamous by Dallas Cowboys free safety Roy Williams when he performed it on Philadelphia Eagles wide receiver Terrell Owens.

<doc id="10668" wikidata="Q7203108" url="?curid=10668" title="Play from scrimmage">
<text>A play from scrimmage is the sequence in the game of gridiron football during which one team tries to advance the ball, get a first down, or score, and the other team tries to stop them or take the ball away. Once a play is over, and before the next play starts, the football is considered dead. A game of American football (or Canadian Football) consists of many (about 120–150) such plays.

==Specifications==
The term is also used to denote a specific plan of action, or its execution, under a particular set of circumstances faced by either team. For instance, the offensive team may be faced with one or two downs left in a possession and still ten or more yards to go to earn a new set of downs. In this instance, they may decide to employ a forward pass. Well in advance of the particular game, a number of different kinds of forward pass plays will have been planned out and practiced by the team. They will be designated by obscure words, letters and/or numbers so that the name of a play does not reveal its exact execution to outsiders. The team&#x27;s coach, or perhaps the quarterback, will choose one of the planned forward passing strategies, and tell the team, during the huddle which one has been chosen. Because of planning and practice, each player is expected to know what his role in the play is to be, and how to execute it. This will be the offensive play.

Conversely, the defensive team will know that the offense has to cover a good deal of ground in a single play, will expect a forward pass, and will know from earlier study something of the propensities of the offense they face. The defensive captain is likely to call out a specific formation or defensive play, to anticipate and counteract the expected action by the offense.

==The play==
The play will begin with the snap of the ball (typically but not exclusively to the quarterback), and it will end when the effort by the offensive squad to advance the ball has either succeeded in scoring, or has been frustrated by the ball being downed before the aim of the offensive play is accomplished, or by the defensive squad having managed to come into possession of the ball without first downing it. In the event of change of possession during a play, the team newly in possession of the ball may try to advance it toward their opponent&#x27;s goal, which the team formerly in possession will naturally resist. Change of possession during a routine play may occur by interception or by fumble (often collectively referred to as &quot;turnovers&quot;).

Change of possession may also occur in other ways. A change of possession can occur &quot;on downs&quot;, if the offensive team fails to achieve a first down or a touchdown in a specified number of consecutive attempts, known as &quot;downs&quot; (four in American football; three in Canadian football). Another way is through a change of possession play, when the offensive team (having perhaps surmised the unlikelihood of scoring or of achieving a first down within the allowed consecutive attempts to do so) kicks the ball away in what is known as a punt. A touchdown (and subsequent conversion attempt, whether successful or not) or successful field goal attempt will be followed by a kickoff. Kickoffs and field goal attempts are not considered true change of possession plays. An unsuccessful field goal attempt will usually also result in a change of possession (without a kickoff), but is usually not counted as a turnover.

<doc id="10669" wikidata="Q117321337" url="?curid=10669" title="Football player">
<text>A football player or footballer is a sportsperson who plays one of the different types of football. The main types of football are association football, American football, Canadian football, Australian rules football, Gaelic football, rugby league, and rugby union.

It has been estimated that there are 250 million association football players in the world, and many play other forms of football.

==Career==
Jean-Pierre Papin has described football as a &quot;universal language&quot;. Footballers across the world and at almost any level may regularly attract large crowds of spectators, and players are the focal points of widespread social phenomena such as association football culture.

Footballers usually begin as amateurs and the best players progress to become professional players. Normally they start at a youth team (any local team) and from there, based on skill and talent, scouts offer contracts. Once signed, some learn to play better football and a few advance to the senior or professional teams.

===Pay===
Pay in some top men&#x27;s leagues is significantly higher than in other jobs. Players in the Premier League earn an average of $3 million per year. In the wealthiest clubs in European football leagues, men earn an average $7.19 million per year. The best players of those clubs can earn up to $260 million per year.

However, only a fraction of men&#x27;s professional football players are paid at this level. Wages may be somewhat more moderate in other divisions and leagues. For example, the average annual salary for footballers in Major League Soccer (MLS) is $530,262 as of May 2023.

Average salaries in women&#x27;s leagues are far lower. For example, players in the National Women&#x27;s Soccer League (NWSL), which started in 2012, earn an average of $54,000 per year as of May 2022. For the first time in 2022, the NWSL guaranteed players a living wage. The minimum salary in 2023 is $36,400 to ensure players do not need second or third jobs to survive.

===Post-retirement===
A minority of retired footballers continue working full-time in football, for instance as football managers. A 1979 study reported that former first-team ballplayers were over-represented as top-ranking executives in their companies and had greater income mobility than second-teamers and reserves. However, some experience chronic health issues, see below.

==Skills and specialties==
===Association football specialties (positions)===

In association football, there are four traditional types of specialties (positions): goalkeepers (goalies), defenders (full-backs), midfielders (half-backs), and forwards (attackers). Special purpose positions include such performers as sweepers, stoppers, second forwards (under-attackers), wingers, insiders, etc.
* Goalkeepers: good reflexes, communication with defence, one-on-one ability, command of the penalty area and aerial intelligence.

* Centre-backs: good heading and tackling ability, height, bravery in attempting challenges, and concentration.

* Full-backs: pace, stamina, anticipation, tackling and marking abilities, work rate, and team responsibility.

* Central midfielders: stamina, passing ability, team responsibility, positioning, marking abilities.

* Wingers: pace, technical ability like dribbling and close control, off-the-ball intelligence, creativity.

* Forwards: finishing ability, composure, technical ability, heading ability, pace, off-the-ball intelligence.

===American football===

The American football teams&#x27; positions are categorized by a form of play where each of them has its spectrum of positions. Those are offensive, defensive, and special teams.

===Australian football===
==Psychological aspects of performance==
Research shows that association football players who take less than 200 milliseconds after the referee blows their whistle to make a penalty kick are significantly less likely to score than those who take over a second.

==Health issues==
An Irish 2002 study of association and Gaelic football players characterized players as &quot;lean and muscular with a reasonably high level of capacity in all areas of physical performance&quot;. The opposite is the case for American football, where obesity could be the cause of grave health problems.

A 2000 study documented injuries sustained by Czech [association] football players at all levels:

 Patellar tendinitis (knee pain) is considered an injury that comes from overexertion, which also happens to other athletes of virtually every sport. It is a common problem that football players develop and can usually be treated by a quadriceps strengthening program. Jumping activities place particularly high strains on the tendon and with repetitive jumping, tearing and injury of the tendon can occur. The chronic injury and healing response results in inflammation and localized pain.

Although levels of depression and pain in retired football players are on par with the societal average, some players suffer from post-retirement chronic injuries. Head injuries are a particular concern.

===Life expectancy===
Studies have long shown former American football NFL players have a longer life expectancy than the general public or males with a similar age and race distribution, but a higher rate of cardiovascular issues. A study comparing the deaths of former Major League Baseball players found baseball players lived longer still, perhaps suggesting a &quot;healthy worker&quot; bias where NFL athletes lived less long than they would otherwise have, despite their longer than average life expectancy. A 2009 review of the evidence in the American Journal of Medicine concluded the existing evidence &quot;did not suggest an increased mortality&quot; but does &quot;suggest increased cardiovascular risk..., particularly the heavier linemen.&quot;

In association football, a 2011 German study found that German national team players lived 1.9 years less than the general male population.

A 1983 study of rugby players found that the life expectancy of All Blacks was the same as for the general population.

Australian rules footballers have lower death rates than the general population.

===Head===
American football players are prone to head injuries such as concussions. In later life, this increases the risk of dementia and Alzheimer&#x27;s. Professional American football players self-reporting concussions are at greater risk for having depressive episodes later in life compared with those retired players self-reporting no concussions.

Probably due to the repeated trauma associated with heading balls, professional association football has been suggested to increase the incidence of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. In a 1987 study of former Norwegian association football national team players, one third of the players were found to have central cerebral atrophy, &quot;i.e.&quot; brain damage. A 1999 study connected soccer to chronic traumatic head injury (CTHI):

===Knee===
Anterior cruciate ligaments are particularly vulnerable in most types of football due to injuries that can be sustained during tackles.

===Hip===
An increased incidence of osteoarthritis in the hip joint has been found in retired football players.

===Muscles===
A 2012 study of association football injuries found that 19% of all injuries were muscle injuries, of which 54% affected the thigh muscles.

===Sleep and psychological functioning===
In a 2009 study, association football was found to be associated with favourable sleep patterns and psychological functioning in adolescent male football players.

The rate of suicide among NFL vets has been found to be 59% lower than in the general population.

===FIFA response===
In 2012, FIFA released a paper intended to identify key risk factors for association football players.

== Longevity and factors of mortality ==
In 2015, a systematic review of a sample of fifty-four peer-reviewed publications and three articles on elite athletes’ mortality and longevity, resulted in major longevity outcomes for the elite athletes (baseball, football, soccer, basketball, and cycling) &quot;compared to age and sex-matched controls from the general population and other athletes.&quot; The span longevities were influenced by factors like the type of sport, the playing position, the race, and the energy system.

=== International level ===
An observational study held from professional footballers -active (during their career) and recently retired (post-career, aged more than 45 years)- in 70 countries between 2007 and 2013, elaborated on data from the World Footballers&#x27; Union (FIFPro), recorded 214 deaths of which 25% was caused by accidents, 11% by suicides and 33% by a suspected cardiac pathology (on an overall 55% of deaths caused by some sort of disease).

Clinical evaluation, ECG, and echocardiography are required for the athletes as pre-participation tools in order to prevent sudden cardiac deaths in people aged less than 35. To evaluate the risk of myocardial fibrosis, may use and recommend the additional use of late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) with pre- and post-contrast and extracellular volume fraction (ECV) images. Even encouraged, it wasn&#x27;t yet made mandatory.

=== North America ===
In 2015, 205 deaths among North American professional athletes who were registered as active at the time of their decease were analysed. Data were collected for the four major sports: National Basketball Association (NBA), National Football League (NFL), National Hockey League (NHL), and Major League Baseball (MLB). The NFL and NBA active players had &quot;a higher likelihood of dying in a car accident&quot; and a significantly higher likelihood of dying from a cardiac-related illness compared to the NHL and MLB active populations.

In 2013, a study on 3,439 retired athletes of the National Football Leagues with at least five credited playing seasons between 1959 and 1988 did not show a statistical correlation between suicide mortality and professional activity, particularly football-related compared with the general control sample. No stratification was reported between speed and non-speed position players.

=== Italy ===
Until the 2000s a very limited number of formal studies has been published on mortality from all causes in soccer players, despite the high interest of the public to the matter.
An extended study held in Italy between 1975 and 2003 on a total of 5.389 players, aged 14–35 years, highlighted that, while the mortality for cancer and cardiovascular diseases among the football players cohort was significantly lower than the general Italian population, the &quot;mortality rates for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and car accidents were significantly higher than expected, and for ALS the risk is 18 times than expected.&quot;

<doc id="10671" wikidata="Q9358" url="?curid=10671" title="Friedrich Nietzsche">
<text>Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche (15 October 1844 – 25 August 1900) was a German philologist, philosopher, poet, cultural critic and composer who became one of the most influential of all modern thinkers. He began his career as a classical philologist, turning to philosophy early in his academic career. In 1869, aged 24, Nietzsche became the youngest professor to hold the Chair of Classical Philology at the University of Basel. Regarded as one of most influential intellectuals of modern history, Nietzsche’s works and views have earned him enduring influence and admiration. Having had health problems that plagued him most of his life, he resigned from university in 1879, after which he completed much of his core writing in the following decade. In 1889, aged 44, he suffered a collapse and afterward a complete loss of his mental faculties, with paralysis and vascular dementia. He lived his remaining years under care of his family until his death, in 1900.

Nietzsche&#x27;s work spans philosophical polemics, poetry, cultural criticism, and fiction while displaying a fondness for aphorism and irony. Prominent elements of his philosophy include his radical critique of truth in favour of perspectivism; a genealogical critique of religion and Christian morality and a related theory of master–slave morality; the aesthetic affirmation of life in response to both the &quot;death of God&quot; and the profound crisis of nihilism; the notion of Apollonian and Dionysian forces; and a characterisation of the human subject as the expression of competing wills, collectively understood as the will to power. He also developed influential concepts such as the &quot;&quot; and his doctrine of eternal return. In his later work, he became increasingly preoccupied with the creative powers of the individual to overcome cultural and moral mores in pursuit of new values and aesthetic health. His body of work touched a wide range of topics, including art, philology, history, music, religion, tragedy, culture, and science, and drew inspiration from Greek tragedy as well as figures such as Zoroaster, Arthur Schopenhauer, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Richard Wagner, Fyodor Dostoevsky, and Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. 

After his death, Nietzsche&#x27;s sister Elisabeth became the curator and editor of his manuscripts. She edited his unpublished writings to fit her German ultranationalist ideology, often contradicting or obfuscating Nietzsche&#x27;s stated opinions, which were explicitly opposed to antisemitism and nationalism. Through her published editions, Nietzsche&#x27;s work became associated with fascism and Nazism. 20th-century scholars such as Walter Kaufmann, R. J. Hollingdale, and Georges Bataille defended Nietzsche against this interpretation, and corrected editions of his writings were soon made available. Nietzsche&#x27;s thought enjoyed renewed popularity in the 1960s and his ideas have since had a profound impact on 20th- and early 21st-century thinkers across philosophy—especially in schools of continental philosophy such as existentialism, postmodernism, and post-structuralism—as well as art, literature, music, poetry, politics, and popular culture.

== Life ==

=== Youth (1844–1868) ===

Born on 15 October 1844, Nietzsche grew up in the town of Röcken (now part of Lützen), near Leipzig, in the Prussian Province of Saxony. He was named after King Friedrich Wilhelm IV of Prussia, who turned 49 on the day of Nietzsche&#x27;s birth (Nietzsche later dropped his middle name Wilhelm). Nietzsche&#x27;s great-grandfather, (1714–1804), was an inspector and a philosopher. Nietzsche&#x27;s grandfather, (1756–1826), was a theologian. Nietzsche&#x27;s parents, Carl Ludwig Nietzsche (1813–1849), a Lutheran pastor and former teacher; and (&quot;née&quot; Oehler) (1826–1897), married in 1843, the year before their son&#x27;s birth. They had two other children: a daughter, Elisabeth Förster-Nietzsche, born in 1846; and a second son, Ludwig Joseph, born in 1848. Nietzsche&#x27;s father died from a brain disease in 1849, after a year of excruciating agony, when the boy was only four years old; Ludwig Joseph died six months later at age two. The family then moved to Naumburg, where they lived with Nietzsche&#x27;s maternal grandmother and his father&#x27;s two unmarried sisters. After the death of Nietzsche&#x27;s grandmother in 1856, the family moved into their own house, now Nietzsche-Haus, a museum and Nietzsche study centre.
Nietzsche attended a boys&#x27; school and then a private school, where he became friends with Gustav Krug and Wilhelm Pinder, both of whom came from highly respected families. Academic records from one of the schools attended by Nietzsche noted that he excelled in Christian theology.

In 1854, he began to attend the Domgymnasium in Naumburg. Because his father had worked for the state (as a pastor) the now-fatherless Nietzsche was offered a scholarship to study at the internationally recognised Schulpforta. The claim that Nietzsche was admitted on the strength of his academic competence has been debunked: his grades were not near the top of the class. He studied there from 1858 to 1864, becoming friends with Paul Deussen and Carl von Gersdorff (1844–1904), who later became a jurist. He also found time to work on poems and musical compositions. Nietzsche led &quot;Germania&quot;, a music and literature club, during his summers in Naumburg. At Schulpforta, Nietzsche received an important grounding in languages—Greek, Latin, Hebrew, and French—so as to be able to read important primary sources; he also experienced for the first time being away from his family life in a small-town conservative environment. His end-of-semester exams in March 1864 showed a 1 in Religion and German; a 2a in Greek and Latin; a 2b in French, History, and Physics; and a &quot;lackluster&quot; 3in Hebrew and Mathematics.

Nietzsche was an amateur composer. He composed several works for voice, piano, and violin beginning in 1858 at the Schulpforta in Naumburg when he started to work on musical compositions. Richard Wagner was dismissive of Nietzsche&#x27;s music, allegedly mocking a birthday gift of a piano composition sent by Nietzsche in 1871 to Wagner&#x27;s wife Cosima. German conductor and pianist Hans von Bülow also described another of Nietzsche&#x27;s pieces as &quot;the most undelightful and the most anti-musical draft on musical paper that I have faced in a long time&quot;.

While at Schulpforta, Nietzsche pursued subjects that were considered unbecoming. He became acquainted with the work of the then almost-unknown poet Friedrich Hölderlin, calling him &quot;my favorite poet&quot; and writing an essay in which he said that the poet raised consciousness to &quot;the most sublime ideality&quot;. The teacher who corrected the essay gave it a good mark but commented that Nietzsche should concern himself in the future with healthier, more lucid, and more &quot;German&quot; writers. Additionally, he became acquainted with Ernst Ortlepp, an eccentric, blasphemous, and often drunken poet who was found dead in a ditch weeks after meeting the young Nietzsche but who may have introduced Nietzsche to the music and writing of Richard Wagner. Perhaps under Ortlepp&#x27;s influence, he and a student named Richter returned to school drunk and encountered a teacher, resulting in Nietzsche&#x27;s demotion from first in his class and the end of his status as a prefect.
After graduation in September 1864, Nietzsche began studying theology and classical philology at the University of Bonn in the hope of becoming a minister. For a short time, he and Deussen became members of the Burschenschaft &quot;Frankonia&quot;. After one semester (and to the anger of his mother), he stopped his theological studies and lost his faith. As early as his 1862 essay &quot;Fate and History&quot;, Nietzsche had argued that historical research had discredited the central teachings of Christianity, but David Strauss&#x27;s &quot;Life of Jesus&quot; also seems to have had a profound effect on the young man. In addition, Ludwig Feuerbach&#x27;s &quot;The Essence of Christianity&quot; influenced young Nietzsche with its argument that people created God, and not the other way around. In June 1865, at the age of 20, Nietzsche wrote to his sister Elisabeth, who was deeply religious, a letter regarding his loss of faith. This letter contains the following statement:
Hence the ways of men part: if you wish to strive for peace of soul and pleasure, then believe; if you wish to be a devotee of truth, then inquire...

Nietzsche subsequently concentrated on studying philology under Professor Friedrich Wilhelm Ritschl, whom he followed to the University of Leipzig in 1865. There he became close friends with his fellow student Erwin Rohde. Nietzsche&#x27;s first philological publications appeared soon after.

In 1865, Nietzsche thoroughly studied the works of Arthur Schopenhauer. He owed the awakening of his philosophical interest to reading Schopenhauer&#x27;s &quot;The World as Will and Representation&quot; and later admitted that Schopenhauer was one of the few thinkers whom he respected, dedicating the essay &quot;&quot; in the &quot;Untimely Meditations&quot; to him.

In 1866, he read Friedrich Albert Lange&#x27;s &quot;History of Materialism&quot;. Lange&#x27;s descriptions of Kant&#x27;s anti-materialistic philosophy, the rise of European Materialism, Europe&#x27;s increased concern with science, Charles Darwin&#x27;s theory of evolution, and the general rebellion against tradition and authority intrigued Nietzsche greatly. Nietzsche would ultimately argue the impossibility of an evolutionary explanation of the human aesthetic sense.

In 1867, Nietzsche signed up for one year of voluntary service with the Prussian artillery division in Naumburg. He was regarded as one of the finest riders among his fellow recruits, and his officers predicted that he would soon reach the rank of captain. However, in March 1868, while jumping into the saddle of his horse, Nietzsche struck his chest against the pommel and tore two muscles in his left side, leaving him exhausted and unable to walk for months. Consequently, he turned his attention to his studies again, completing them in 1868. Nietzsche also met Richard Wagner for the first time later that year.

=== Professor at Basel (1869–1879) ===
In 1869, with Ritschl&#x27;s support, Nietzsche received an offer to become a professor of classical philology at the University of Basel in Switzerland. He was only 24 years old and had neither completed his doctorate nor received a teaching certificate (&quot;habilitation&quot;). He was awarded an honorary doctorate by Leipzig University in March 1869, again with Ritschl&#x27;s support.

Despite his offer coming at a time when he was considering giving up philology for science, he accepted. To this day, Nietzsche is still among the youngest of the tenured Classics professors on record.

Nietzsche&#x27;s 1870 projected doctoral thesis, &quot;Contribution toward the Study and the Critique of the Sources of Diogenes Laertius&quot; (&quot;Beiträge zur Quellenkunde und Kritik des Laertius Diogenes&quot;), examined the origins of the ideas of Diogenes Laërtius. Though never submitted, it was later published as a (&#x27;congratulatory publication&#x27;) in Basel.

Before moving to Basel, Nietzsche renounced his Prussian citizenship: for the rest of his life he remained officially stateless.

Nevertheless, Nietzsche served in the Prussian forces during the Franco-Prussian War (1870–1871) as a medical orderly. In his short time in the military, he experienced much and witnessed the traumatic effects of battle. He also contracted diphtheria and dysentery. Walter Kaufmann speculates that he also contracted syphilis at a brothel along with his other infections at this time. On returning to Basel in 1870, Nietzsche observed the establishment of the German Empire and Otto von Bismarck&#x27;s subsequent policies as an outsider and with a degree of scepticism regarding their genuineness. His inaugural lecture at the university was &quot;&quot;. Nietzsche also met Franz Overbeck, a professor of theology who remained his friend throughout his life. Afrikan Spir, a little-known Russian philosopher responsible for the 1873 &quot;Thought and Reality&quot; and Nietzsche&#x27;s colleague, the historian Jacob Burckhardt, whose lectures Nietzsche frequently attended, began to exercise significant influence on him.

Nietzsche had already met Richard Wagner in Leipzig in 1868 and later Wagner&#x27;s wife, Cosima. Nietzsche admired both greatly and during his time at Basel frequently visited Wagner&#x27;s house in Tribschen in Lucerne. The Wagners brought Nietzsche into their most intimate circle—which included Franz Liszt, of whom Nietzsche colloquially described: &quot;Liszt or the art of running after women!&quot; Nietzsche enjoyed the attention he gave to the beginning of the Bayreuth Festival. In 1870, he gave Cosima Wagner the manuscript of &quot;The Genesis of the Tragic Idea&quot; as a birthday gift. In 1872, Nietzsche published his first book, &quot;The Birth of Tragedy&quot;. However, his colleagues within his field, including Ritschl, expressed little enthusiasm for the work in which Nietzsche eschewed the classical philologic method in favour of a more speculative approach. In his polemic &quot;Philology of the Future&quot;, Ulrich von Wilamowitz-Moellendorff damped the book&#x27;s reception and increased its notoriety. In response, Rohde (then a professor in Kiel) and Wagner came to Nietzsche&#x27;s defence. Nietzsche remarked freely about the isolation he felt within the philological community and attempted unsuccessfully to transfer to a position in philosophy at Basel.
In 1873, Nietzsche began to accumulate notes that would be posthumously published as &quot;Philosophy in the Tragic Age of the Greeks&quot;. Between 1873 and 1876, he published four separate long essays: &quot;David Strauss: the Confessor and the Writer&quot;, &quot;On the Use and Abuse of History for Life&quot;, &quot;Schopenhauer as Educator&quot;, and &quot;Richard Wagner in Bayreuth&quot;. These four later appeared in a collected edition under the title &quot;Untimely Meditations&quot;. The essays shared the orientation of a cultural critique, challenging the developing German culture suggested by Schopenhauer and Wagner. During this time in the circle of the Wagners, he met Malwida von Meysenbug and Hans von Bülow. He also began a friendship with Paul Rée who, in 1876, influenced him into dismissing the pessimism in his early writings. However, he was deeply disappointed by the Bayreuth Festival of 1876, where the banality of the shows and baseness of the public repelled him. He was also alienated by Wagner&#x27;s championing of &quot;German culture&quot;, which Nietzsche felt a contradiction in terms, as well as by Wagner&#x27;s celebration of his fame among the German public. All this contributed to his subsequent decision to distance himself from Wagner.

With the publication in 1878 of &quot;Human, All Too Human&quot; (a book of aphorisms ranging from metaphysics to morality to religion), a new style of Nietzsche&#x27;s work became clear, highly influenced by Afrikan Spir&#x27;s &quot;Thought and Reality&quot; and reacting against the pessimistic philosophy of Wagner and Schopenhauer. Nietzsche&#x27;s friendship with Deussen and Rohde cooled as well. In 1879, after a significant decline in health, Nietzsche had to resign his position at Basel and was pensioned. Since his childhood, various disruptive illnesses had plagued him, including moments of shortsightedness that left him nearly blind, migraine headaches, and violent indigestion. The 1868 riding accident and diseases in 1870 may have aggravated these persistent conditions, which continued to affect him through his years at Basel, forcing him to take longer and longer holidays until regular work became impractical.

=== Independent philosopher (1879–1888) ===

Living on his pension from Basel along with aid from friends, Nietzsche travelled frequently to find climates more conducive to his health. He lived until 1889 as an independent author in different cities. He spent many summers in Sils Maria near St. Moritz in Switzerland, and many of his winters in the Italian cities of Genoa, Rapallo, and Turin and the French city of Nice. In 1881, when France occupied Tunisia, he planned to travel to Tunis to view Europe from the outside but later abandoned that idea, probably for health reasons. Nietzsche occasionally returned to Naumburg to visit his family, and, especially during this time, he and his sister Elisabeth had repeated periods of conflict and reconciliation.

While in Genoa, Nietzsche&#x27;s failing eyesight prompted him to explore the use of typewriters as a means of continuing to write. He is known to have tried using the Hansen Writing Ball, a contemporary typewriter device. In the end, a past student of his, Peter Gast, became a private secretary to Nietzsche. In 1876, Gast transcribed the crabbed, nearly illegible handwriting of Nietzsche&#x27;s first time with Richard Wagner in Bayreuth. He subsequently transcribed and proofread the galleys for almost all of Nietzsche&#x27;s work. On at least one occasion, on 23 February 1880, the usually poor Gast received 200 marks from their mutual friend, Paul Rée. Gast was one of the very few friends Nietzsche allowed to criticise him. In responding most enthusiastically to &quot;Also Sprach Zarathustra&quot; (&quot;Thus Spoke Zarathustra&quot;), Gast did feel it necessary to point out that what were described as &quot;superfluous&quot; people were in fact quite necessary. He went on to list the number of people Epicurus, for example, had to rely on to supply his simple diet of goat cheese.

To the end of his life, Gast and Overbeck remained consistently faithful friends. Malwida von Meysenbug remained like a motherly patron even outside the Wagner circle. Soon Nietzsche made contact with the music-critic Carl Fuchs. Nietzsche stood at the beginning of his most productive period. Beginning with &quot;Human, All Too Human&quot; in 1878, Nietzsche published one book or major section of a book each year until 1888, his last year of writing; that year, he completed five.

In 1882, Nietzsche published the first part of &quot;The Gay Science&quot;. That year he also met Lou Andreas-Salomé, through Malwida von Meysenbug and Paul Rée.

Salomé&#x27;s mother took her to Rome when Salomé was 21. At a literary salon in the city, Salomé became acquainted with Paul Rée. Rée proposed marriage to her, but she, instead, proposed that they should live and study together as &quot;brother and sister&quot;, along with another man for company, where they would establish an academic commune. Rée accepted the idea and suggested that they be joined by his friend Nietzsche. The two met Nietzsche in Rome in April 1882, and Nietzsche is believed to have instantly fallen in love with Salomé, as Rée had done. Nietzsche asked Rée to propose marriage to Salomé, which she rejected. She had been interested in Nietzsche as a friend, but not as a husband. Nietzsche nonetheless was content to join with Rée and Salomé touring through Switzerland and Italy together, planning their commune. The three travelled with Salomé&#x27;s mother through Italy and considered where they would set up their &quot;Winterplan&quot; commune. They intended to set up their commune in an abandoned monastery, but no suitable location was found. On 13 May, in Lucerne, when Nietzsche was alone with Salomé, he earnestly proposed marriage to her again, which she rejected. He nonetheless was happy to continue with the plans for an academic commune. After discovering the relationship, Nietzsche&#x27;s sister Elisabeth became determined to get Nietzsche away from the &quot;immoral woman&quot;. Nietzsche and Salomé spent the summer together in Tautenburg in Thuringia, often with Nietzsche&#x27;s sister Elisabeth as a chaperone. Salomé reports that he asked her to marry him on three separate occasions and that she refused, though the reliability of her reports of events is questionable. Arriving in Leipzig (Germany) in October, Salomé and Rée separated from Nietzsche after a falling-out between Nietzsche and Salomé, in which Salomé believed that Nietzsche was desperately in love with her.

While the three spent a number of weeks together in Leipzig in October 1882, the following month Rée and Salomé left Nietzsche, leaving for Stibbe (today Zdbowo in Poland) without any plans to meet again. Nietzsche soon fell into a period of mental anguish, although he continued to write to Rée, stating &quot;We shall see one another from time to time, won&#x27;t we?&quot; In later recriminations, Nietzsche would blame on separate occasions the failure in his attempts to woo Salomé on Salomé, Rée, and on the intrigues of his sister (who had written letters to the families of Salomé and Rée to disrupt the plans for the commune). Nietzsche wrote of the affair in 1883, that he now felt &quot;genuine hatred for my sister&quot;.

Amidst renewed bouts of illness, living in near-isolation after a falling out with his mother and sister regarding Salomé, Nietzsche fled to Rapallo, where he wrote the first part of &quot;Also Sprach Zarathustra&quot; in only ten days.
By 1882, Nietzsche was taking huge doses of opium and continued to have trouble sleeping. In 1883, while staying in Nice, he was writing out his own prescriptions for the sedative chloral hydrate, signing them &quot;Dr. Nietzsche&quot;.

He turned away from the influence of Schopenhauer, and after he severed his social ties with Wagner, Nietzsche had few remaining friends. Now, with the new style of &quot;Zarathustra&quot;, his work became even more alienating, and the market received it only to the degree required by politeness. Nietzsche recognised this and maintained his solitude, though he often complained. His books remained largely unsold. In 1885, he printed only 40 copies of the fourth part of &quot;Zarathustra&quot; and distributed a fraction of them among close friends, including Helene von Druskowitz.

In 1883, he tried and failed to obtain a lecturing post at the University of Leipzig. According to a letter he wrote to Peter Gast, this was due to his &quot;attitude towards Christianity and the concept of God&quot;.

In 1886, Nietzsche broke with his publisher Ernst Schmeitzner, disgusted by his antisemitic opinions. Nietzsche saw his own writings as &quot;completely buried and in this anti-Semitic dump&quot; of Schmeitzner—associating the publisher with a movement that should be &quot;utterly rejected with cold contempt by every sensible mind&quot;. He then printed &quot;Beyond Good and Evil&quot; at his own expense. He also acquired the publication rights for his earlier works and over the next year issued second editions of &quot;The Birth of Tragedy&quot;, &quot;Human, All Too Human&quot;, &quot;Daybreak&quot;, and of &quot;The Gay Science&quot; with new prefaces placing the body of his work in a more coherent perspective. Thereafter, he saw his work as completed for a time and hoped that soon a readership would develop. In fact, interest in Nietzsche&#x27;s thought did increase at this time, if rather slowly and imperceptibly to him. During these years Nietzsche met Meta von Salis, Carl Spitteler, and Gottfried Keller.

In 1886, his sister Elisabeth married the antisemite Bernhard Förster and travelled to Paraguay to found Nueva Germania, a &quot;Germanic&quot; colony. Through correspondence, Nietzsche&#x27;s relationship with Elisabeth continued through cycles of conflict and reconciliation, but they met again only after his collapse. He continued to have frequent and painful attacks of illness, which made prolonged work impossible.

In 1887, Nietzsche wrote the polemic &quot;On the Genealogy of Morality&quot;. During the same year, he encountered the work of Fyodor Dostoyevsky, to whom he felt an immediate kinship. He also exchanged letters with Hippolyte Taine and Georg Brandes. Brandes, who had started to teach the philosophy of Søren Kierkegaard in the 1870s, wrote to Nietzsche asking him to read Kierkegaard, to which Nietzsche replied that he would come to Copenhagen and read Kierkegaard with him. However, before fulfilling this promise, Nietzsche slipped too far into illness. At the beginning of 1888, Brandes delivered in Copenhagen one of the first lectures on Nietzsche&#x27;s philosophy.

Although Nietzsche had previously announced at the end of &quot;On the Genealogy of Morality&quot; a new work with the title &quot;The Will to Power: Attempt at a Revaluation of All Values&quot;, he seems to have abandoned this idea and, instead, used some of the draft passages to compose &quot;Twilight of the Idols&quot; and &quot;The Antichrist&quot; in 1888.

His health improved and he spent the summer in high spirits. In the autumn of 1888, his writings and letters began to reveal a higher estimation of his own status and &quot;fate&quot;. He overestimated the increasing response to his writings, however, especially to the recent polemic, &quot;The Case of Wagner&quot;. On his 44th birthday, after completing &quot;Twilight of the Idols&quot; and &quot;The Antichrist&quot;, he decided to write the autobiography &quot;Ecce Homo&quot;. In its preface—which suggests Nietzsche was well aware of the interpretive difficulties his work would generate—he declares, &quot;Hear me! For I am such and such a person. Above all, do not mistake me for someone else.&quot; In December, Nietzsche began a correspondence with August Strindberg and thought that, short of an international breakthrough, he would attempt to buy back his older writings from the publisher and have them translated into other European languages. Moreover, he planned the publication of the compilation &quot;Nietzsche contra Wagner&quot; and of the poems that made up his collection &quot;Dionysian-Dithyrambs&quot;.

=== Mental illness and death (1889–1900) ===
On 3 January 1889, Nietzsche suffered a mental breakdown. Two policemen approached him after he caused a public disturbance in the streets of Turin. What happened remains unknown, but an often-repeated tale from shortly after his death states that Nietzsche witnessed the flogging of a horse at the other end of the Piazza Carlo Alberto, ran to the horse, threw his arms around its neck to protect it, then collapsed to the ground. In the following few days, Nietzsche sent short writings—known as the &quot;Wahnzettel&quot; or &quot;Wahnbriefe&quot; (literally &quot;Delusion notes&quot; or &quot;letters&quot;)—to a number of friends including Cosima Wagner and Jacob Burckhardt. Most of them were signed &quot;Dionysus&quot;, though some were also signed &quot;der Gekreuzigte&quot; meaning &quot;the crucified one&quot;. To his former colleague Burckhardt, Nietzsche wrote:I have had Caiaphas put in fetters. Also, last year I was crucified by the German doctors in a very drawn-out manner. Wilhelm, Bismarck, and all anti-Semites abolished.Additionally, he commanded the German emperor to go to Rome to be shot and summoned the European powers to take military action against Germany, writing also that the pope should be put in jail and that he, Nietzsche, created the world and was in the process of having all anti-Semites shot dead.
On 6 January 1889, Burckhardt showed the letter he had received from Nietzsche to Overbeck. The following day, Overbeck received a similar letter and decided that Nietzsche&#x27;s friends had to bring him back to Basel. Overbeck travelled to Turin and brought Nietzsche to a psychiatric clinic in Basel. By that time Nietzsche appeared fully in the grip of a serious mental illness, and his mother Franziska decided to transfer him to a clinic in Jena under the direction of Otto Binswanger. In January 1889, they proceeded with the planned release of &quot;Twilight of the Idols&quot;, by that time already printed and bound. From November 1889 to February 1890, the art historian Julius Langbehn attempted to cure Nietzsche, claiming that the methods of the medical doctors were ineffective in treating Nietzsche&#x27;s condition. Langbehn assumed progressively greater control of Nietzsche until his secretiveness discredited him. In March 1890, Franziska removed Nietzsche from the clinic and, in May 1890, brought him to her home in Naumburg. During this process Overbeck and Gast contemplated what to do with Nietzsche&#x27;s unpublished works. In February, they ordered a fifty-copy private edition of &quot;Nietzsche contra Wagner&quot;, but the publisher C. G. Naumann secretly printed one hundred. Overbeck and Gast decided to withhold publishing &quot;The Antichrist&quot; and &quot;Ecce Homo&quot; because of their more radical content. Nietzsche&#x27;s reception and recognition enjoyed their first surge.

In 1893, Nietzsche&#x27;s sister Elisabeth returned from Nueva Germania in Paraguay following the suicide of her husband. She studied Nietzsche&#x27;s works and, piece by piece, took control of their publication. Overbeck was dismissed and Gast finally co-operated. After the death of Franziska in 1897, Nietzsche lived in Weimar, where Elisabeth cared for him and allowed visitors, including Rudolf Steiner (who in 1895 had written &quot;Friedrich Nietzsche: A Fighter Against His Time&quot;, one of the first books praising Nietzsche), to meet her uncommunicative brother. Elisabeth employed Steiner as a tutor to help her to understand her brother&#x27;s philosophy. Steiner abandoned the attempt after only a few months, declaring that it was impossible to teach her anything about philosophy.
Nietzsche&#x27;s insanity was originally diagnosed as tertiary syphilis, in accordance with a prevailing medical paradigm of the time. Although most commentators regard his breakdown as unrelated to his philosophy, Georges Bataille wrote poetically of his condition (&quot;&#x27;Man incarnate&#x27; must also go mad&quot;) and René Girard&#x27;s postmortem psychoanalysis posits a worshipful rivalry with Richard Wagner. Girard suggests that Nietzsche signed his final letters as both Dionysus and the Crucified One because he was demonstrating that by being a god (Dionysus), one is also a victim (Crucified One) since a god still suffers by overcoming the law. Nietzsche had previously written, &quot;All superior men who were irresistibly drawn to throw off the yoke of any kind of morality and to frame new laws had, if they were not actually mad, no alternative but to make themselves or pretend to be mad.&quot; (Daybreak, 14) The diagnosis of syphilis has since been challenged and a diagnosis of &quot;manic-depressive illness with periodic psychosis followed by vascular dementia&quot; was put forward by Cybulska prior to Schain&#x27;s study. Leonard Sax suggested the slow growth of a right-sided retro-orbital meningioma as an explanation of Nietzsche&#x27;s dementia; Orth and Trimble postulated frontotemporal dementia while other researchers have proposed a hereditary stroke disorder called CADASIL. Poisoning by mercury, a treatment for syphilis at the time of Nietzsche&#x27;s death, has also been suggested.

In 1898 and 1899, Nietzsche suffered at least two strokes. They partially paralysed him, leaving him unable to speak or walk. He likely suffered from clinical hemiparesis/hemiplegia on the left side of his body by 1899. After contracting pneumonia in mid-August 1900, he had another stroke during the night of 24–25 August and died at about noon on 25 August. Elisabeth had him buried beside his father at the church in Röcken near Lützen. His friend and secretary Gast gave his funeral oration, proclaiming: &quot;Holy be your name to all future generations!&quot;
Elisabeth Förster-Nietzsche compiled &quot;The Will to Power&quot; from Nietzsche&#x27;s unpublished notebooks and published it posthumously in 1901. Because his sister arranged the book based on her own conflation of several of Nietzsche&#x27;s early outlines and took liberties with the material, the scholarly consensus has been that it does not reflect Nietzsche&#x27;s intent. (For example, Elisabeth removed aphorism 35 of &quot;The Antichrist&quot;, where Nietzsche rewrote a passage of the Bible.) Indeed, Mazzino Montinari, the editor of Nietzsche&#x27;s &quot;Nachlass&quot;, called it a forgery. Yet, the endeavour to rescue Nietzsche&#x27;s reputation by discrediting &quot;The Will to Power&quot; often leads to scepticism about the value of his late notes, even of his whole &quot;Nachlass&quot;. However, his &quot;Nachlass&quot; and &quot;The Will to Power&quot; are distinct.

=== Citizenship, nationality, and ethnicity ===
General commentators and Nietzsche scholars, whether emphasising his cultural background or his language, overwhelmingly label Nietzsche as a &quot;German philosopher.&quot; Others do not assign him a national category. While Germany had not yet been unified into a single sovereign state, Nietzsche was born a citizen of Prussia, which was mostly part of the German Confederation. His birthplace, Röcken, is in the modern German state of Saxony-Anhalt. When he accepted his post at Basel, Nietzsche applied for annulment of his Prussian citizenship. The official revocation of his citizenship came in a document dated 17 April 1869, and for the rest of his life he remained officially stateless.
At least toward the end of his life, Nietzsche believed his ancestors were Polish. He wore a signet ring bearing the Radwan coat of arms, traceable back to Polish nobility of medieval times and the surname &quot;Nicki&quot; of the Polish noble (szlachta) family bearing that coat of arms. Gotard Nietzsche, a member of the Nicki family, left Poland for Prussia. His descendants later settled in the Electorate of Saxony circa the year 1700. Nietzsche wrote in 1888, &quot;My ancestors were Polish noblemen (Nietzky); the type seems to have been well preserved despite three generations of German mothers.&quot; At one point, Nietzsche became even more adamant about his Polish identity. &quot;I am a pure-blooded Polish nobleman, without a single drop of bad blood, certainly not German blood.&quot; On yet another occasion, Nietzsche stated, &quot;Germany is a great nation only because its people have so much Polish blood in their veins... I am proud of my Polish descent.&quot; Nietzsche believed his name might have been Germanised, in one letter claiming, &quot;I was taught to ascribe the origin of my blood and name to Polish noblemen who were called Niëtzky and left their home and nobleness about a hundred years ago, finally yielding to unbearable suppression: they were Protestants.&quot;

Most scholars dispute Nietzsche&#x27;s account of his family&#x27;s origins. Hans von Müller debunked the genealogy put forward by Nietzsche&#x27;s sister in favour of Polish noble heritage. Max Oehler, Nietzsche&#x27;s cousin and curator of the Nietzsche Archive at Weimar, argued that all of Nietzsche&#x27;s ancestors bore German names, including the wives&#x27; families. Oehler claims that Nietzsche came from a long line of German Lutheran clergymen on both sides of his family, and modern scholars regard the claim of Nietzsche&#x27;s Polish ancestry as &quot;pure invention.&quot; Colli and Montinari, the editors of Nietzsche&#x27;s assembled letters, gloss Nietzsche&#x27;s claims as a &quot;mistaken belief&quot; and &quot;without foundation.&quot; The name &quot;Nietzsche&quot; itself is not a Polish name, but an exceptionally common one throughout central Germany, in this and cognate forms (such as &quot;Nitsche&quot; and &quot;Nitzke&quot;). The name derives from the forename &quot;Nikolaus,&quot; abbreviated to &quot;Nick&quot;; assimilated with the Slavic &quot;Nitz&quot;; it first became &quot;Nitsche&quot; and then &quot;Nietzsche&quot;.

It is not known why Nietzsche wanted to be thought of as Polish nobility. According to biographer R. J. Hollingdale, Nietzsche&#x27;s propagation of the Polish ancestry myth may have been part of his &quot;campaign against Germany.&quot; Nicholas D. More states that Nietzsche&#x27;s claims of having an illustrious lineage were a parody on autobiographical conventions, and suspects &quot;Ecce Homo&quot;, with its self-laudatory titles, such as &quot;Why I Am So Wise&quot;, as being a work of satire. He concludes that Nietzsche&#x27;s supposed Polish genealogy was a joke—not a delusion.

=== Relationships and sexuality ===
Nietzsche was never married. He proposed to Lou Salomé three times and each time was rejected. One theory blames Salomé&#x27;s view on sexuality as one of the reasons for her alienation from Nietzsche. As articulated in her 1898 novella &quot;Fenitschka&quot;, Salomé viewed the idea of sexual intercourse as prohibitive and marriage as a violation, with some suggesting that they indicated sexual repression and neurosis. Reflecting on unrequited love, Nietzsche considered that &quot;indispensable ... to the lover is his unrequited love, which he would at no price relinquish for a state of indifference&quot;.

Deussen cited the episode of Cologne&#x27;s brothel in February 1865 as instrumental to understanding the philosopher&#x27;s way of thinking, mostly about women. Nietzsche was surreptitiously accompanied to a &quot;call house&quot; from which he clumsily escaped upon seeing &quot;a half dozen apparitions dressed in sequins and veils.&quot; According to Deussen, Nietzsche &quot;never decided to remain unmarried all his life. For him, women had to sacrifice themselves to the care and benefit of men.&quot; Nietzsche scholar has attempted to explain Nietzsche&#x27;s life history and philosophy by claiming that he was homosexual. Köhler argues that Nietzsche&#x27;s supposed syphilis, which is &quot;...usually considered to be the product of his encounter with a prostitute in a brothel in Cologne or Leipzig, is equally likely. Some maintain that Nietzsche contracted it in a male brothel in Genoa.&quot; The acquisition of the infection from a homosexual brothel was the theory believed by Sigmund Freud, who cited Otto Binswanger as his source. Köhler also suggests that Nietzsche had a romantic relationship, as well as a friendship, with Paul Rée. There is the claim that Nietzsche&#x27;s homosexuality was widely known in the Vienna Psychoanalytic Society, with Nietzsche&#x27;s friend Paul Deussen claiming that &quot;he was a man who had never touched a woman.&quot;

Köhler&#x27;s views have not found wide acceptance among Nietzsche scholars and commentators. Allan Megill argues that, while Köhler&#x27;s claim that Nietzsche was conflicted about his homosexual desire cannot simply be dismissed, &quot;the evidence is very weak,&quot; and Köhler may be projecting twentieth-century understandings of sexuality on nineteenth-century notions of friendship. It is also rumoured that Nietzsche frequented heterosexual brothels. Nigel Rodgers and Mel Thompson have argued that continuous sickness and headaches hindered Nietzsche from engaging much with women. Yet they offer other examples in which Nietzsche expressed his affections to women, including Wagner&#x27;s wife Cosima Wagner.

Other scholars have argued that Köhler&#x27;s sexuality-based interpretation is not helpful in understanding Nietzsche&#x27;s philosophy. However, there are also those who stress that, if Nietzsche preferred men—with this preference constituting his psycho-sexual make-up—but could not admit his desires to himself, it meant he acted in conflict with his philosophy.

== Philosophy ==
Because of Nietzsche&#x27;s evocative style and provocative ideas, his philosophy generates passionate reactions. His works remain controversial, due to varying interpretations and misinterpretations. In Western philosophy, Nietzsche&#x27;s writings have been described as a case of free revolutionary thought, that is, revolutionary in its structure and problems, although not tied to any revolutionary project. His writings have also been described as a revolutionary project in which his philosophy serves as the foundation of a European cultural rebirth.

=== Apollonian and Dionysian ===
The &quot;Apollonian and Dionysian&quot; is a two-fold philosophical concept based on two figures in ancient Greek mythology, Apollo and Dionysus. This relationship takes the form of a dialectic. Even though the concept is related to &quot;The Birth of Tragedy&quot;, the poet Hölderlin had already spoken of it, and Winckelmann had talked of Bacchus.

Nietzsche found in classical Athenian tragedy an art form that transcended the pessimism found in the so-called wisdom of Silenus. The Greek spectators, by looking into the abyss of human suffering depicted by characters on stage, passionately and joyously affirmed life, finding it worth living. The main theme in &quot;The Birth of Tragedy&quot; is that the fusion of Dionysian and Apollonian &quot;Kunsttriebe&quot; (&quot;artistic impulses&quot;) forms dramatic arts or tragedies. He argued that this fusion has not been achieved since the ancient Greek tragedians. Apollo represents harmony, progress, clarity, logic and the principle of individuation, whereas Dionysus represents disorder, intoxication, emotion, ecstasy and unity (hence the omission of the principle of individuation). 

However, Nietzsche strongly distinguishes his Dionysus from the Dionysus of the Orphic tradition, which he considers a later corruption of the original Dionysian force. To him in the pre-Homeric world, Dionysian civilizations were marked by barbarism, cruelty, and ecstatic sexual excess, unrestrained by rational or moral principles. Nietzsche associates this period with unmediated life-affirmation, where violence and eroticism intertwined as expressions of raw vitality. However, the Orphics, overwhelmed by anxiety toward this unmitigated savagery, reacted by turning away from the physical world and abstracting their gods into metaphysical ideas. In doing so, they transformed Dionysus from a figure of visceral power into a god of suffering and redemption and, in parallel, converted man from a being of flesh and instincts into a soul burdened with guilt and the need for purification. 

Nietzsche criticizes this Orphic reinterpretation as an early decline in Greek spiritual health, arguing that it marked the beginning of an anti-life tendency that would later manifest in Platonism and Christianity. He further argues that Socrates and Euripides continued the Orphic trajectory, replacing instinct, myth, and artistic frenzy with rationalism, dialectic, and moral didacticism. By doing so, they undermined the ecstatic and violent balance of Apollonian and Dionysian forces, ultimately leading to the decline of Greek tragedy.

Nietzsche used these two forces because, for him, the world of mind and order on one side, and passion and chaos on the other, formed principles that were fundamental to the Greek culture: the Apollonian a dreaming state, full of illusions; and Dionysian a state of intoxication, representing the liberation of instincts and dissolution of boundaries. In this mould, a man appears as the satyr. He is the horror of the annihilation of the principle of individuality and at the same time someone who delights in its destruction.

Apollonian and Dionysian juxtapositions appear in the interplay of tragedy: the tragic hero of the drama, the main protagonist, struggles to make (Apollonian) order of his unjust and chaotic (Dionysian) fate, though he dies unfulfilled. Elaborating on the conception of Hamlet as an intellectual who cannot make up his mind, and is a living antithesis to the man of action, Nietzsche argues that a Dionysian figure possesses the knowledge that his actions cannot change the eternal balance of things, and it disgusts him enough not to act at all. Hamlet falls under this category—he glimpsed the supernatural reality through the Ghost; he has gained true knowledge and knows that no action of his has the power to change this. For the audience of such drama, this tragedy allows them to sense what Nietzsche called the &quot;Primordial Unity&quot;, which revives Dionysian nature. He describes primordial unity as the increase of strength, the experience of fullness and plenitude bestowed by . Frenzy acts as intoxication and is crucial for the physiological condition that enables the creation of any art. Stimulated by this state, a person&#x27;s artistic will is enhanced:

In this state one enriches everything out of one&#x27;s own fullness: whatever one sees, whatever wills is seen swelled, taut, strong, overloaded with strength. A man in this state transforms things until they mirror his power—until they are reflections of his perfection. This having to transform into perfection is—art.

Nietzsche is adamant that the works of Aeschylus and Sophocles represent the apex of artistic creation, the true realisation of tragedy; it is with Euripides, that tragedy begins its &quot;Untergang&quot; (literally &#x27;going under&#x27; or &#x27;downward-way;&#x27; meaning decline, deterioration, downfall, death, etc.). Nietzsche objects to Euripides&#x27; use of Socratic rationalism and morality in his tragedies, claiming that the infusion of ethics and reason robs tragedy of its foundation, namely the fragile balance of the Dionysian and Apollonian. Socrates emphasised reason to such a degree that he diffused the value of myth and suffering to human knowledge. Plato continued along this path in his dialogues, and the modern world eventually inherited reason at the expense of artistic impulses found in the Apollonian and Dionysian dichotomy. He notes that without the Apollonian, the Dionysian lacks the form and structure to make a coherent piece of art, and without the Dionysian, the Apollonian lacks the necessary vitality and passion. Only the fertile interplay of these two forces brought together as an art represented the best of Greek tragedy.

An example of the impact of this idea can be seen in the book &quot;Patterns of Culture&quot;, where anthropologist Ruth Benedict acknowledges Nietzschean opposites of &quot;Apollonian&quot; and &quot;Dionysian&quot; as the stimulus for her thoughts about Native American cultures. Carl Jung has written extensively on the dichotomy in &quot;Psychological Types&quot;. Michel Foucault commented that his own book &quot;Madness and Civilization&quot; should be read &quot;under the sun of the great Nietzschean inquiry&quot;. Here Foucault referenced Nietzsche&#x27;s description of the birth and death of tragedy and his explanation that the subsequent tragedy of the Western world was the refusal of the tragic and, with that, refusal of the sacred. Painter Mark Rothko was influenced by Nietzsche&#x27;s view of tragedy presented in &quot;The Birth of Tragedy.&quot;

=== Perspectivism ===
Nietzsche claimed the death of God would eventually lead to the realisation that there can never be a universal perspective on things and that the traditional idea of objective truth is incoherent. Nietzsche rejected the idea of objective reality, arguing that knowledge is contingent and conditional, relative to various fluid perspectives or interests. This leads to constant reassessment of rules (i.e., those of philosophy, the scientific method, etc.) according to the circumstances of individual perspectives. This view has acquired the name &quot;perspectivism&quot;.

In &quot;Thus Spoke Zarathustra&quot;, Nietzsche proclaimed that a table of values hangs above every great person. He pointed out that what is common among different peoples is the act of esteeming, of creating values, even if the values are different from one person to the next. Nietzsche asserted that what made people great was not the content of their beliefs, but the act of valuing. Thus the values a community strives to articulate are not as important as the collective will to see those values come to pass. The willingness is more essential than the merit of the goal itself, according to Nietzsche. &quot;A thousand goals have there been so far&quot;, says Zarathustra, &quot;for there are a thousand peoples. Only the yoke for the thousand necks is still lacking: the one goal is lacking. Humanity still has no goal.&quot; Hence, the title of the aphorism, &quot;On The Thousand And One Goal&quot;. The idea that one value-system is no more worthy than the next, although it may not be directly ascribed to Nietzsche, has become a common premise in modern social science. Max Weber and Martin Heidegger absorbed it and made it their own. It shaped their philosophical and cultural endeavours, as well as their political understanding. Weber, for example, relied on Nietzsche&#x27;s perspectivism by maintaining that objectivity is still possible—but only after a particular perspective, value, or end has been established.

Among his critique of traditional philosophy of Kant, Descartes, and Plato in &quot;Beyond Good and Evil&quot;, Nietzsche attacked the &quot;thing in itself&quot; and &quot;cogito ergo sum&quot; (&quot;I think, therefore I am&quot;) as unfalsifiable beliefs based on naive acceptance of previous notions and fallacies. Philosopher Alasdair MacIntyre put Nietzsche in a high place in the history of philosophy. While criticising nihilism and Nietzsche together as a sign of general decay, he still commended him for recognising psychological motives behind Kant and Hume&#x27;s moral philosophy:

For it was Nietzsche&#x27;s historic achievement to understand more clearly than any other philosopher ... not only that what purported to be appeals of objectivity were in fact expressions of subjective will, but also the nature of the problems that this posed for philosophy.

=== Slave revolt in morals ===
In &quot;Beyond Good and Evil&quot; and &quot;On the Genealogy of Morality&quot;, Nietzsche&#x27;s genealogical account of the development of modern moral systems occupies a central place. For Nietzsche, a fundamental shift took place during the human history from thinking in terms of &quot;good and bad&quot; toward &quot;good and evil&quot;.

The initial form of morality was set by a warrior aristocracy and other ruling castes of ancient civilisations. Aristocratic values of good and bad coincided with and reflected their relationship to lower castes such as slaves. Nietzsche presented this &quot;master morality&quot; as the original system of morality—perhaps best associated with Homeric Greece. To be &quot;good&quot; was to be happy and to have the things related to happiness: wealth, strength, health, power, etc. To be &quot;bad&quot; was to be like the slaves over whom the aristocracy ruled: poor, weak, sick, pathetic—objects of pity or disgust rather than hatred.

&quot;Slave morality&quot; developed as a reaction to master morality. Value emerges from the contrast between good and evil: good being associated with other-worldliness, charity, piety, restraint, meekness, and submission; while evil is worldly, cruel, selfish, wealthy, and aggressive. Nietzsche saw slave morality as pessimistic and fearful, its values emerging to improve the self-perception of slaves. He associated slave morality with the Jewish and Christian traditions, as it is born out of the &quot;ressentiment&quot; of slaves. Nietzsche argued that the idea of equality allowed slaves to overcome their own conditions without despising themselves. By denying the inherent inequality of people—in success, strength, beauty, and intelligence—slaves acquired a method of escape, namely by generating new values on the basis of rejecting master morality, which frustrated them. It was used to overcome the slave&#x27;s sense of inferiority before their (better-off) masters. It does so by depicting slave weakness, for example, as a matter of choice, by relabelling it as &quot;meekness&quot;. The &quot;good man&quot; of master morality is precisely the &quot;evil man&quot; of slave morality, while the &quot;bad man&quot; is recast as the &quot;good man&quot;.

Nietzsche saw slave morality as a source of the nihilism that has overtaken Europe. Modern Europe and Christianity exist in a hypocritical state due to a tension between master and slave morality, both contradictory values determining, to varying degrees, the values of most Europeans (who are &quot;motley&quot;). Nietzsche called for exceptional people not to be ashamed in the face of a supposed morality-for-all, which he deems to be harmful to the flourishing of exceptional people. He cautioned, however, that morality, per se, is not bad; it is good for the masses and should be left to them. Exceptional people, in contrast, should follow their own &quot;inner law&quot;. A favourite motto of Nietzsche, taken from Pindar, reads: &quot;Become what you are.&quot;

A long-standing assumption about Nietzsche is that he preferred master over slave morality. However, eminent Nietzsche scholar Walter Kaufmann rejected this interpretation, writing that Nietzsche&#x27;s analyses of these two types of morality were used only in a descriptive and historic sense; they were not meant for any kind of acceptance or glorification. On the other hand, Nietzsche called master morality &quot;a higher order of values, the noble ones, those that say Yes to life, those that guarantee the future&quot;. Just as &quot;there is an order of rank between man and man&quot;, there is also an order of rank &quot;between morality and morality&quot;. Nietzsche waged a philosophic war against the slave morality of Christianity in his &quot;revaluation of all values&quot; to bring about the victory of a new master morality that he called the &quot;philosophy of the future&quot; (&quot;Beyond Good and Evil&quot; is subtitled &quot;Prelude to a Philosophy of the Future&quot;).

In &quot;Daybreak&quot;, Nietzsche began his &quot;Campaign against Morality&quot;. He called himself an &quot;immoralist&quot; and harshly criticised the prominent moral philosophies of his day: Christianity, Kantianism, and utilitarianism. Nietzsche&#x27;s concept &quot;God is dead&quot; applies to the doctrines of Christendom, though not to all other faiths: he claimed that Buddhism is a successful religion that he complimented for fostering critical thought. Still, Nietzsche saw his philosophy as a counter-movement to nihilism through appreciation of art:

Nietzsche claimed that the Christian faith as practised was not a proper representation of Jesus&#x27; teachings, as it forced people merely to believe in the way of Jesus but not to act as Jesus did; in particular, his example of refusing to judge people, something that Christians constantly did. He condemned institutionalised Christianity for emphasising a morality of pity (&quot;Mitleid&quot;), which assumes an inherent illness in society:
In &quot;Ecce Homo&quot; Nietzsche called the establishment of moral systems based on a dichotomy of good and evil a &quot;calamitous error&quot;, and wished to initiate a re-evaluation of the values of the Christian world. He indicated his desire to bring about a new, more naturalistic source of value in the vital impulses of life itself.

While Nietzsche attacked the principles of Judaism, he was not antisemitic: in his work &quot;On the Genealogy of Morality&quot;, he explicitly condemned antisemitism and pointed out that his attack on Judaism was not an attack on contemporary Jewish people but specifically an attack upon the ancient Jewish priesthood who he claimed antisemitic Christians paradoxically based their views upon. An Israeli historian who performed a statistical analysis of everything Nietzsche wrote about Jews claims that cross-references and context make clear that 85% of the negative comments are attacks on Christian doctrine or, sarcastically, on Richard Wagner.

Nietzsche felt that modern antisemitism was &quot;despicable&quot; and contrary to European ideals. Its cause, in his opinion, was the growth in European nationalism and the endemic &quot;jealousy and hatred&quot; of Jewish success. He wrote that Jews should be thanked for helping uphold a respect for the philosophies of ancient Greece, and for giving rise to &quot;the noblest human being (Christ), the purest philosopher (Baruch Spinoza), the mightiest book, and the most effective moral code in the world&quot;.

=== Death of God and nihilism ===
The statement &quot;God is dead,&quot; occurring in several of Nietzsche&#x27;s works (notably in &quot;The Gay Science&quot;), has become one of his best-known remarks. On the basis of it, many commentators regard Nietzsche as an atheist; others (such as Kaufmann) suggest that this statement might reflect a more subtle understanding of divinity. Scientific developments and the increasing secularisation of Europe had effectively &#x27;killed&#x27; the Abrahamic God, who had served as the basis for meaning and value in the West for more than a thousand years. The death of God may lead beyond bare perspectivism to outright nihilism, the belief that nothing has any inherent importance and that life lacks purpose. While Nietzsche rejected the traditional Christian morality and theology, he also rejected the nihilism which many thought was the only alternative to it.

Nietzsche believed that Christian moral doctrine was originally constructed to counteract nihilism. It provides people with traditional beliefs about the moral values of good and evil, belief in God (whose existence one might appeal to in justifying the evil in the world), and a framework with which one might claim to have objective knowledge. In constructing a world where objective knowledge is supposed to be possible, Christianity is an antidote to a primal form of nihilism—the despair of meaninglessness. As Heidegger put the problem, &quot;If God as the supra sensory ground and goal of all reality is dead if the supra sensory world of the ideas has suffered the loss of its obligatory and above it its vitalising and upbuilding power, then nothing more remains to which man can cling and by which he can orient himself.&quot;

One such reaction to the loss of meaning is what Nietzsche called &quot;passive nihilism&quot;, which he recognised in the pessimistic philosophy of Schopenhauer. Schopenhauer&#x27;s doctrine—which Nietzsche also referred to as Western Buddhism—advocates separating oneself from will and desires to reduce suffering. Nietzsche characterised this ascetic attitude as a &quot;will to nothingness&quot;. Life turns away from itself as there is nothing of value to be found in the world. This moving away of all value in the world is characteristic of the nihilist, although, in this, the nihilist appears to be inconsistent; this &quot;will to nothingness&quot; is still a (disavowed) form of willing.

Nietzsche approached the problem of nihilism as a deeply personal one, stating that this problem of the modern world had &quot;become conscious&quot; in him. Furthermore, he emphasised the danger of nihilism and the possibilities it offers, as seen in his statement that &quot;I praise, I do not reproach, [nihilism&#x27;s] arrival. I believe it is one of the greatest crises, a moment of the deepest self-reflection of humanity. Whether man recovers from it, whether he becomes a master of this crisis, is a question of his strength!&quot; According to Nietzsche, it is only when nihilism is &quot;overcome&quot; that a culture can have a true foundation on which to thrive. He wished to hasten its coming only so that he could also hasten its ultimate departure. Heidegger interpreted the death of God with what he explained as the death of metaphysics. He concluded that metaphysics has reached its potential and that the ultimate fate and downfall of metaphysics was proclaimed with the statement &quot;God is dead.&quot;

Scholars such as Nishitani and Parkes have aligned Nietzsche&#x27;s religious thought with Buddhist thinkers, particularly those of the Mahayana tradition. Occasionally, Nietzsche has also been considered in relation to Catholic mystics such as Meister Eckhart. Milne has argued against such interpretations on the grounds that such thinkers from Western and Eastern religious traditions strongly emphasise the divestment of will and the loss of ego, while Nietzsche offers a robust defence of egoism. Milne argues that Nietzsche&#x27;s religious thought is better understood in relation to his self-professed ancestors: &quot;Heraclitus, Empedocles, Spinoza, Goethe&quot;. Milne plays particularly close attention to Nietzsche&#x27;s relationship to Goethe, who has typically been neglected in research by academic philosophers. Milne shows that Goethe&#x27;s views on the one and the many allow a reciprocal determinism between part and whole, meaning that a claimed identity between part and whole does not give the part value solely in terms of belonging to the whole. In essence, this allows for a unitive sense of the individual&#x27;s relationship to the universe, while also fostering a sense of &quot;self-esteem&quot; which Nietzsche found lacking in mystics such as Eckhart.

With regard to Nietzsche&#x27;s development of thought, it has been noted in research that although he dealt with &quot;nihilistic&quot; themes (&quot;pessimism, with nirvana and with nothingness and non-being&quot;) from 1869 onwards, a conceptual use of nihilism first took place in handwritten notes in mid-1880. This period saw the publication of a then popular work that reconstructed so-called &quot;Russian nihilism&quot; on the basis of Russian newspaper reports (N. Karlowitsch: The Development of Nihilism. Berlin 1880), which is significant for Nietzsche&#x27;s terminology .

=== Will to power ===
A basic element in Nietzsche&#x27;s philosophical outlook is the &quot;will to power&quot; (), which he maintained provides a basis for understanding human behaviour—more so than competing explanations, such as the ones based on pressure for adaptation or survival. As such, according to Nietzsche, the drive for conservation appears as the major motivator of human or animal behaviour only in exceptions, as the general condition of life is not one of a &#x27;struggle for existence.&#x27; More often than not, self-conservation is a consequence of a creature&#x27;s will to exert its strength on the outside world.

In presenting his theory of human behaviour, Nietzsche also addressed and attacked concepts from philosophies then popularly embraced, such as Schopenhauer&#x27;s notion of an aimless will or that of utilitarianism. Utilitarians claim that what moves people is the desire to be happy and accumulate pleasure in their lives. But such a conception of happiness Nietzsche rejected as something limited to, and characteristic of, the bourgeois lifestyle of the English society, and instead put forth the idea that happiness is not an aim &quot;per se&quot;. It is a consequence of overcoming hurdles to one&#x27;s actions and the fulfilment of the will.

Related to his theory of the will to power is his speculation, which he did not deem final, regarding the reality of the physical world, including inorganic matter—that, like man&#x27;s affections and impulses, the material world is also set by the dynamics of a form of the will to power. At the core of his theory is a rejection of atomism—the idea that matter is composed of stable, indivisible units (atoms). Instead, he seemed to have accepted the conclusions of Ruđer Bošković, who explained the qualities of matter as a result of an interplay of forces. One study of Nietzsche defines his fully developed concept of the will to power as &quot;the element from which derive both the quantitative difference of related forces and the quality that devolves into each force in this relation&quot; revealing the will to power as &quot;the principle of the synthesis of forces&quot;. Of such forces Nietzsche said they could perhaps be viewed as a primitive form of the will. Likewise, he rejected the view that the movement of bodies is ruled by inexorable laws of nature, positing instead that movement was governed by the power relations between bodies and forces.

Other scholars disagree that Nietzsche considered the material world to be a form of the will to power: Nietzsche thoroughly criticised metaphysics, and by including the will to power in the material world, he would simply be setting up a new metaphysics. Other than Aphorism 36 in &quot;Beyond Good and Evil&quot;, where he raised a question regarding will to power as being in the material world, they argue, it was only in his notes (unpublished by himself), where he wrote about a metaphysical will to power. And they also claim that Nietzsche directed his landlord to burn those notes in 1888 when he left Sils Maria. According to these scholars, the &quot;burning&quot; story supports their thesis that Nietzsche rejected his project on the will to power at the end of his lucid life. However, a recent study (Huang 2019) shows that although it is true that in 1888 Nietzsche wanted some of his notes burned, this indicates little about his project on the will to power, not only because only 11 &quot;aphorisms&quot; saved from the flames were ultimately incorporated into &quot;The Will to Power&quot; (this book contains 1067 &quot;aphorisms&quot;), but also because these abandoned notes mainly focus on topics such as the critique of morality while touching upon the &quot;feeling of power&quot; only once.

=== Eternal return ===
&quot;Eternal return&quot; (also known as &quot;eternal recurrence&quot;) is a hypothetical concept that posits that the universe has been recurring, and will continue to recur, for an infinite number of times across infinite time or space. It is a purely physical concept, involving no supernatural reincarnation, but the return of beings in the same bodies. Nietzsche first proposed the idea of eternal return in a parable in Section 341 of &quot;The Gay Science&quot;, and also in the chapter &quot;Of the Vision and the Riddle&quot; in &quot;Thus Spoke Zarathustra&quot;, among other places. Nietzsche considered it as potentially &quot;horrifying and paralyzing&quot;, and said that its burden is the &quot;heaviest weight&quot; imaginable (&quot; das schwerste Gewicht&quot;). The wish for the eternal return of all events would mark the ultimate affirmation of life, a reaction to Schopenhauer&#x27;s praise of denying the will-to-live. To comprehend eternal recurrence, and to not only come to peace with it but to embrace it, requires &quot;amor fati&quot;, &quot;love of fate&quot;. As Heidegger pointed out in his lectures on Nietzsche, Nietzsche&#x27;s first mention of eternal recurrence presents this concept as a hypothetical &quot;question&quot; rather than stating it as fact. According to Heidegger, it is the burden imposed by the &quot;question&quot; of eternal recurrence – the mere possibility of it, and the reality of speculating on that possibility – which is so significant in modern thought: &quot;The way Nietzsche here patterns the first communication of the thought of the &#x27;greatest burden&#x27; [of eternal recurrence] makes it clear that this &#x27;thought of thoughts&#x27; is at the same time &#x27;the most burdensome thought.&#x27;&quot;

Alexander Nehamas writes in &quot;Nietzsche: Life as Literature&quot; of three ways of seeing the eternal recurrence:

# &quot;My life will recur in exactly identical fashion:&quot; this expresses a totally fatalistic approach to the idea;
# &quot;My life may recur in exactly identical fashion:&quot; This second view conditionally asserts cosmology, but fails to capture what Nietzsche refers to in &quot;The Gay Science&quot;, p. 341; and finally,
# &quot;If my life were to recur, then it could recur only in identical fashion.&quot; Nehamas shows that this interpretation exists totally independently of physics and does not presuppose the truth of cosmology.

Nehamas concluded that, if individuals constitute themselves through their actions, they can only maintain themselves in their current state by living in a recurrence of past actions. Nietzsche&#x27;s thought is the negation of the idea of a history of salvation.

=== Übermensch ===
Another concept important to understanding Nietzsche is the &quot;Übermensch&quot; (Superman). Writing about nihilism in &quot;Also Sprach Zarathustra&quot;, Nietzsche introduced an &quot;Übermensch&quot;. According to Laurence Lampert, &quot;the death of God must be followed by a long twilight of piety and nihilism (II. 19; III. 8). Zarathustra&#x27;s gift of the overman is given to mankind not aware of the problem to which the overman is the solution.&quot; Zarathustra presents the &quot;Übermensch&quot; as the creator of new values, and he appears as a solution to the problem of the death of God and nihilism. The &quot;Übermensch&quot; does not follow the morality of common people since that favours mediocrity but rises above the notion of good and evil and above the &quot;herd&quot;. In this way Zarathustra proclaims his ultimate goal as the journey towards the state of the &quot;Übermensch&quot;. He wants a kind of spiritual evolution of self-awareness and overcoming of traditional views on morality and justice that stem from the superstitious beliefs still deeply rooted or related to the notion of God and Christianity.

From &quot;Thus Spoke Zarathustra&quot; (Zarathustra&#x27;s Prologue; pp. 9–11):

Zarathustra contrasts the &quot;Übermensch&quot; with the last man of egalitarian modernity (the most obvious example being democracy), an alternative goal humanity might set for itself. The last man is possible only by mankind&#x27;s having bred an apathetic creature who has no great passion or commitment, who is unable to dream, who merely earns his living and keeps warm. This concept appears only in &quot;Thus Spoke Zarathustra&quot;, and is presented as a condition that would render the creation of the &quot;Übermensch&quot; impossible.

Some have suggested that the eternal return is related to the , since willing the eternal return of the same is a necessary step if the is to create new values untainted by the spirit of gravity or asceticism. Values involve a rank-ordering of things, and so are inseparable from approval and disapproval, yet it was dissatisfaction that prompted men to seek refuge in other-worldliness and embrace other-worldly values. It could seem that the , in being devoted to any values at all, would necessarily fail to create values that did not share some bit of asceticism. Willing the eternal recurrence is presented as accepting the existence of the low while still recognising it as the low, and thus as overcoming the spirit of gravity or asceticism. One must have the strength of the to will the eternal recurrence. Only the will have the strength to fully accept all of his past life, including his failures and misdeeds, and to truly will their eternal return. This action nearly kills Zarathustra, for example, and most human beings cannot avoid other-worldliness because they really are sick, not because of any choice they made.

The Nazis attempted to incorporate the concept into their ideology by means of taking Nietzsche&#x27;s figurative form of speech and creating a literal superiority over other ethnicities. After his death, Elisabeth Förster-Nietzsche became the curator and editor of her brother&#x27;s manuscripts. She reworked Nietzsche&#x27;s unpublished writings to fit her own German nationalist ideology while often contradicting or obfuscating Nietzsche&#x27;s stated opinions, which were explicitly opposed to antisemitism and nationalism. Through her published editions, Nietzsche&#x27;s work became associated with fascism and Nazism; 20th-century scholars contested this interpretation of his work and corrected editions of his writings were soon made available.

Although Nietzsche has been misrepresented as a predecessor to Nazism, he criticised antisemitism, pan-Germanism and, to a lesser extent, nationalism. Thus, he broke with his editor in 1886 because of his opposition to his editor&#x27;s antisemitic stances, and his rupture with Richard Wagner, expressed in &quot;The Case of Wagner&quot; and &quot;Nietzsche contra Wagner&quot;, both of which he wrote in 1888, had much to do with Wagner&#x27;s endorsement of pan-Germanism and antisemitism—and also of his rallying to Christianity. In a 29 March 1887 letter to Theodor Fritsch, Nietzsche mocked antisemites, Fritsch, Eugen Dühring, Wagner, Ebrard, Wahrmund, and the leading advocate of pan-Germanism, Paul de Lagarde, who would become, along with Wagner and Houston Chamberlain, the main official influences of Nazism. This 1887 letter to Fritsch ended by: &quot;And finally, how do you think I feel when the name Zarathustra is mouthed by anti-Semites?&quot; In contrast to these examples, Nietzsche&#x27;s close friend Franz Overbeck recalled in his memoirs, &quot;When he speaks frankly, the opinions he expresses about Jews go, in their severity, beyond any anti-Semitism. The foundation of his anti-Christianity is essentially anti-Semitic.&quot;

=== Critique of mass culture ===
Friedrich Nietzsche held a pessimistic view of modern society and culture. He believed that the press and mass culture led to conformity and brought about mediocrity, and that the lack of intellectual progress was leading to the decline of the human species. In his opinion, some people would be able to become superior individuals through the use of willpower. By rising above mass culture, those persons would produce higher, brighter, and healthier human beings.

== Reading and influence ==

A trained philologist, Nietzsche had a thorough knowledge of Greek philosophy. He read Kant, Plato, Mill, Schopenhauer and Spir, who became the main opponents in his philosophy, and later engaged, via the work of Kuno Fischer in particular, with the thought of Baruch Spinoza, whom he saw as his &quot;precursor&quot; in many respects but as a personification of the &quot;ascetic ideal&quot; in others. However, Nietzsche referred to Kant as a &quot;moral fanatic&quot;, Plato as &quot;boring&quot;, Mill as a &quot;blockhead&quot;, and of Spinoza, he asked: &quot;How much of personal timidity and vulnerability does this masquerade of a sickly recluse betray?&quot; He likewise expressed contempt for British author George Eliot.

Nietzsche&#x27;s philosophy, while innovative and revolutionary, was indebted to many predecessors. While at Basel, Nietzsche lectured on pre-Platonic philosophers for several years, and the text of this lecture series has been characterised as a &quot;lost link&quot; in the development of his thought. &quot;In it, concepts such as the will to power, the eternal return of the same, the overman, gay science, self-overcoming and so on receive rough, unnamed formulations and are linked to specific pre-Platonic, especially Heraclitus, who emerges as a pre-Platonic Nietzsche.&quot; The pre-Socratic thinker Heraclitus was known for rejecting the concept of being as a constant and eternal principle of the universe and embracing &quot;flux&quot; and incessant change. His symbolism of the world as &quot;child play&quot; marked by amoral spontaneity and lack of definite rules was appreciated by Nietzsche. Due to his Heraclitean sympathies, Nietzsche was also a vociferous critic of Parmenides, who, in contrast to Heraclitus, viewed the world as a single, unchanging Being.

In his &quot;Egotism in German Philosophy&quot;, George Santayana claimed that Nietzsche&#x27;s whole philosophy was a reaction to Schopenhauer. Santayana wrote that Nietzsche&#x27;s work was &quot;an emendation of that of Schopenhauer. The will to live would become the will to dominate; pessimism founded on reflection would become optimism founded on courage; the suspense of the will in contemplation would yield to a more biological account of intelligence and taste; finally in the place of pity and asceticism (Schopenhauer&#x27;s two principles of morals) Nietzsche would set up the duty of asserting the will at all costs and being cruelly but beautifully strong. These points of difference from Schopenhauer cover the whole philosophy of Nietzsche.&quot;

The superficial similarity of Nietzsche&#x27;s &quot;Übermensch&quot; to Thomas Carlyle&#x27;s Hero as well as both authors&#x27; rhetorical prose style has led to speculation concerning the degree to which Nietzsche might have been influenced by his reading of Carlyle. G. K. Chesterton believed that &quot;Out of [Carlyle] flows most of the philosophy of Nietzsche&quot;, qualifying his statement by adding that they were &quot;profoundly different&quot; in character. Ruth apRoberts has shown that Carlyle anticipated Nietzsche in asserting the importance of metaphor (with Nietzsche&#x27;s metaphor-fiction theory &quot;appear[ing] to owe something to Carlyle&quot;), announcing the death of God, and recognising both Goethe&#x27;s &quot;Entsagen&quot; (renunciation) and Novalis&#x27;s &quot;Selbsttödtung&quot; (self-annihilation) as prerequisites for engaging in philosophy. apRoberts writes that &quot;Nietzsche and Carlyle had the same German sources, but Nietzsche may owe more to Carlyle than he cares to admit&quot;, noting that &quot;[Nietzsche] takes the trouble to repudiate Carlyle with malicious emphasis.&quot; Ralph Jessop, senior lecturer at the University of Glasgow, has recently argued that a reassessment of Carlyle&#x27;s influence on Nietzsche is &quot;long-overdue&quot;.

Nietzsche expressed admiration for 17th-century French moralists such as La Rochefoucauld, La Bruyère and Vauvenargues, as well as for Stendhal. The organicism of Paul Bourget influenced Nietzsche, as did that of Rudolf Virchow and Alfred Espinas. In 1867 Nietzsche wrote in a letter that he was trying to improve his German style of writing with the help of Lessing, Lichtenberg and Schopenhauer. It was probably Lichtenberg (along with Paul Rée) whose aphoristic style of writing contributed to Nietzsche&#x27;s own use of aphorism. Nietzsche early learned of Darwinism through Friedrich Albert Lange. The essays of Ralph Waldo Emerson had a profound influence on Nietzsche, who &quot;loved Emerson from first to last&quot;, wrote &quot;Never have I felt so much at home in a book&quot;, and called him &quot;[the] author who has been richest in ideas in this century so far&quot;. Hippolyte Taine influenced Nietzsche&#x27;s view on Rousseau and Napoleon. Notably, he also read some of the posthumous works of Charles Baudelaire, Tolstoy&#x27;s &quot;My Religion&quot;, Ernest Renan&#x27;s &quot;Life of Jesus&quot;, and Fyodor Dostoyevsky&#x27;s &quot;Demons&quot;. Nietzsche called Dostoyevsky &quot;the only psychologist from whom I have anything to learn&quot;. While Nietzsche never mentions Max Stirner, the similarities in their ideas have prompted a minority of interpreters to suggest a relationship between the two.

In 1861, Nietzsche wrote an enthusiastic essay on his &quot;favorite poet,&quot; Friedrich Hölderlin, mostly forgotten at that time. He also expressed deep appreciation for Stifter&#x27;s &quot;Indian Summer&quot;, Byron&#x27;s &quot;Manfred&quot; and Twain&#x27;s &quot;Tom Sawyer&quot;.

A Louis Jacolliot translation of the Calcutta version of the ancient Hindu text called the Manusmriti was reviewed by Friedrich Nietzsche. He commented on it both favourably and unfavorably:
* He deemed it &quot;an incomparably spiritual and superior work&quot; to the Christian Bible, observed that &quot;the sun shines on the whole book&quot; and attributed its ethical perspective to &quot;the noble classes, the philosophers and warriors, [who] stand above the mass&quot;. Nietzsche does not advocate a caste system, states David Conway, but endorses the political exclusion conveyed in the Manu text. Nietzsche considered Manu&#x27;s social order as far from perfect, but considers the general idea of a caste system to be natural and right, and stated that &quot;caste-order, order of rank is just a formula for the supreme law of life itself&quot;, a &quot;natural order, lawfulness par excellence&quot;. According to Nietzsche, states Julian Young, &quot;Nature, not Manu, separates from each other: predominantly spiritual people, people characterized by muscular and temperamental strength, and a third group of people who are not distinguished in either way, the average&quot;. He wrote that &quot;To prepare a book of law in the style of Manu means to give a people the right to become master one day, to become perfect, – to aspire to the highest art of life.&quot;
* The Law of Manu was also criticised by Nietzsche. Nietzsche writes, &quot;these regulations teach us enough, in them we find for once Aryan humanity, quite pure, quite primordial, we learn that the concept of pure blood is the opposite of a harmless concept.&quot;

== Reception and legacy ==

Nietzsche&#x27;s works did not reach a wide readership during his active writing career. However, in 1888 the influential Danish critic Georg Brandes aroused considerable excitement about Nietzsche through a series of lectures he gave at the University of Copenhagen. In the years after Nietzsche&#x27;s death in 1900, his works became better known, and readers have responded to them in complex and sometimes controversial ways. Many Germans eventually discovered his appeals for greater individualism and personality development in &quot;Thus Spoke Zarathustra&quot;, but responded to them divergently. He had some following among left-wing Germans in the 1890s; in 1894–1895 German conservatives wanted to ban his work as subversive. During the late 19th century Nietzsche&#x27;s ideas were commonly associated with anarchist movements and appear to have had influence within them, particularly in France, Germany, Great Britain and the United States. Gustav Landauer is credited with the most in-depth appreciation and critique of Nietzsche&#x27;s ideas from an anarchist perspective. H.L. Mencken produced the first book on Nietzsche in English in 1907, &quot;The Philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche&quot;, and in 1910 a book of translated paragraphs from Nietzsche, increasing knowledge of his philosophy in the United States. Nietzsche is known today as a precursor to existentialism, post-structuralism and postmodernism.

W. B. Yeats and Arthur Symons described Nietzsche as the intellectual heir to William Blake. Symons went on to compare the ideas of the two thinkers in &quot;The Symbolist Movement in Literature&quot;, while Yeats tried to raise awareness of Nietzsche in Ireland. A similar notion was espoused by W. H. Auden who wrote of Nietzsche in his &quot;New Year Letter&quot; (released in 1941 in &quot;The Double Man&quot;): &quot;O masterly debunker of our liberal fallacies ... all your life you stormed, like your English forerunner Blake.&quot; Nietzsche made an impact on composers during the 1890s. Writer Donald Mitchell noted that Gustav Mahler was &quot;attracted to the poetic fire of Zarathustra, but repelled by the intellectual core of its writings&quot;. He also quoted Mahler himself, and adds that he was influenced by Nietzsche&#x27;s conception and affirmative approach to nature, which Mahler presented in his Third Symphony using Zarathustra&#x27;s roundelay. Frederick Delius produced a piece of choral music, &quot;A Mass of Life&quot;, based on a text of &quot;Thus Spoke Zarathustra&quot;, while Richard Strauss (who also based his &quot;Also sprach Zarathustra&quot; on the same book), was only interested in finishing &quot;another chapter of symphonic autobiography&quot;. Writers and poets influenced by Nietzsche include André Gide, August Strindberg, Robinson Jeffers, Pío Baroja, D. H. Lawrence, Edith Södergran and Yukio Mishima.

Nietzsche was an early influence on the poetry of Rainer Maria Rilke. Knut Hamsun counted Nietzsche, along with Strindberg and Dostoyevsky, as his primary influences. Author Jack London wrote that he was more stimulated by Nietzsche than by any other writer. Critics have suggested that the character of David Grief in &quot;A Son of the Sun&quot; was based on Nietzsche. Nietzsche&#x27;s influence on Muhammad Iqbal is most evidenced in &quot;Asrar-i-Khudi&quot; (&quot;The Secrets of the Self&quot;). Wallace Stevens was another reader of Nietzsche, and elements of Nietzsche&#x27;s philosophy were found throughout Stevens&#x27;s poetry collection &quot;Harmonium&quot;. Olaf Stapledon was influenced by the idea of the and it is a central theme in his books &quot;Odd John&quot; and &quot;Sirius&quot;. In Russia, Nietzsche influenced Russian symbolism and figures such as Dmitry Merezhkovsky, Andrei Bely, Vyacheslav Ivanov and Alexander Scriabin incorporated or discussed parts of Nietzsche philosophy in their works. Thomas Mann&#x27;s novel &quot;Death in Venice&quot; shows a use of Apollonian and Dionysian, and in &quot;Doctor Faustus&quot; Nietzsche was a central source for the character of Adrian Leverkühn. Hermann Hesse, similarly, in his &quot;Narcissus and Goldmund&quot; presents two main characters as opposite yet intertwined Apollonian and Dionysian spirits. Painter Giovanni Segantini was fascinated by &quot;Thus Spoke Zarathustra&quot;, and he drew an illustration for the first Italian translation of the book. The Russian painter Lena Hades created the oil painting cycle &quot;Also Sprach Zarathustra&quot; dedicated to the book &quot;Thus Spoke Zarathustra&quot;.

By World War I, Nietzsche had acquired a reputation as an inspiration for right-wing German militarism and leftist politics. German soldiers received copies of &quot;Thus Spoke Zarathustra&quot; as gifts during World War I. The Dreyfus affair provided a contrasting example of his reception: the French antisemitic Right labelled the Jewish and leftist intellectuals who defended Alfred Dreyfus as &quot;Nietzscheans&quot;. Nietzsche had a distinct appeal for many Zionist thinkers around the start of the 20th century, most notable being Ahad Ha&#x27;am, Hillel Zeitlin, Micha Josef Berdyczewski, A.D. Gordon and Martin Buber, who went so far as to extoll Nietzsche as a &quot;creator&quot; and &quot;emissary of life&quot;. Chaim Weizmann was a great admirer of Nietzsche; the first president of Israel sent Nietzsche&#x27;s books to his wife, adding a comment in a letter that &quot;This was the best and finest thing I can send to you.&quot; Israel Eldad, the ideological chief of the Stern Gang that fought the British in Palestine in the 1940s, wrote about Nietzsche in his underground newspaper and later translated most of Nietzsche&#x27;s books into Hebrew. Eugene O&#x27;Neill remarked that &quot;Zarathustra&quot; influenced him more than any other book he ever read. He also shared Nietzsche&#x27;s view of tragedy. The plays &quot;The Great God Brown&quot; and &quot;Lazarus Laughed&quot; are examples of Nietzsche&#x27;s influence on him. The First International claimed Nietzsche as ideologically one of their own. From 1888 through the 1890s there were more publications of Nietzsche works in Russia than in any other country. Nietzsche was influential among the Bolsheviks. Among the Nietzschean Bolsheviks were Vladimir Bazarov, Anatoly Lunacharsky and Aleksandr Bogdanov. Nietzsche&#x27;s influence on the works of Frankfurt School philosophers Max Horkheimer and Theodor W. Adorno can be seen in the &quot;Dialectic of Enlightenment&quot;. Adorno summed up Nietzsche&#x27;s philosophy as expressing the &quot;humane in a world in which humanity has become a sham&quot;.

Nietzsche&#x27;s growing prominence suffered a severe setback when his works became closely associated with Adolf Hitler and Nazi Germany. Many political leaders of the twentieth century were at least superficially familiar with Nietzsche&#x27;s ideas, although it is not always possible to determine whether they actually read his work. It is debated among scholars whether Hitler read Nietzsche, although if he did, it may not have been extensively. He was a frequent visitor to the Nietzsche museum in Weimar and used expressions of Nietzsche&#x27;s, such as &quot;lords of the earth&quot; in . The Nazis made selective use of Nietzsche&#x27;s philosophy. Alfred Baeumler was perhaps the most notable exponent of Nietzschean thought in Nazi Germany. Baeumler had published his book &quot;Nietzsche, Philosopher and Politician&quot; in 1931, before the Nazis&#x27; rise to power, and subsequently published several editions of Nietzsche&#x27;s work during the Third Reich. Mussolini, Charles de Gaulle and Huey P. Newton read Nietzsche. Richard Nixon read Nietzsche with &quot;curious interest&quot;, and his book &quot;Beyond Peace&quot; might have taken its title from Nietzsche&#x27;s book &quot;Beyond Good and Evil&quot; which Nixon read beforehand. Bertrand Russell wrote that Nietzsche had exerted great influence on philosophers and on people of literary and artistic culture, but warned that the attempt to put Nietzsche&#x27;s philosophy of aristocracy into practice could only be done by an organisation similar to the Fascist or the Nazi party.

A decade after World War II, there was a revival of Nietzsche&#x27;s philosophical writings thanks to translations and analyses by Walter Kaufmann and R.J. Hollingdale. Georges Bataille was also influential in this revival, defending Nietzsche against appropriation by the Nazis with his notable 1937 essay &quot;Nietzsche and Fascists&quot;. Others, well known philosophers in their own right, wrote commentaries on Nietzsche&#x27;s philosophy, including Martin Heidegger, who produced a four-volume study, and Lev Shestov, who wrote a book called &quot;Dostoyevski, Tolstoy and Nietzsche&quot; where he portrays Nietzsche and Dostoyevski as the &quot;thinkers of tragedy&quot;. Georg Simmel compares Nietzsche&#x27;s importance to ethics to that of Copernicus for cosmology. Sociologist Ferdinand Tönnies read Nietzsche avidly from his early life, and later frequently discussed many of his concepts in his own works. Nietzsche has influenced philosophers such as Martin Heidegger, Jean-Paul Sartre, Oswald Spengler, George Grant, Emil Cioran, Albert Camus, Ayn Rand, Jacques Derrida, Sarah Kofman, Leo Strauss, Max Scheler, Michel Foucault, Bernard Williams, and Nick Land.

Camus described Nietzsche as &quot;the only artist to have derived the extreme consequences of an aesthetics of the absurd&quot;. Paul Ricœur called Nietzsche one of the masters of the &quot;school of suspicion&quot;, alongside Karl Marx and Sigmund Freud. Carl Jung was also influenced by Nietzsche. In &quot;Memories, Dreams, Reflections&quot;, a biography transcribed by his secretary, he cites Nietzsche as a large influence. Aspects of Nietzsche&#x27;s philosophy, especially his ideas of the self and his relation to society, run through much of late-twentieth and early twenty-first century thought. Nietzsche&#x27;s writings have also been influential to some advancers of Accelerationist thought through his influence on Deleuze and Guattari. His deepening of the romantic-heroic tradition of the nineteenth century, for example, as expressed in the ideal of the &quot;grand striver&quot; appears in the work of thinkers from Cornelius Castoriadis to Roberto Mangabeira Unger. For Nietzsche, this grand striver overcomes obstacles, engages in epic struggles, pursues new goals, embraces recurrent novelty, and transcends existing structures and contexts.
